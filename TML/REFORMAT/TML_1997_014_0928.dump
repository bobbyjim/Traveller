Actually all you have to do is finish our equivalent of high school. 
The state which runs the universities has insured that eveyone applying
for a matematical institute is going to get a place at one of the
universities in Norway. This is not true yet for all types of study, but
it is goin that way.

Why not? The nobles has no interest in who gets the education, and

Have I said that I would fly on a starship with a INT 3 astrogator. No.
But there will certainly be astrogators in the 3I with INT3 and a really
lousy grade in Astrogation 101 at the Sylean University. Being a doctor is
in my view something different and something the state will be more keen
on controlling.

Agreed, and in a high technology empire this would be the case, again in

Sorry to have stepped on ypur toes, but what of the 25% that still managed 
to get through high school. In a nation, like Norway, all they have the
chance of doing is sorting mail or washing dishes. Therefore to give all
the chance to show that they are worth something, everybody gets the
chance for a higher education.

Just to start of. Free market economics does not in any way exclude human
rights. And as far as I have gotten understood, there is not to many 
dictators ruling in the Imperium, except for Cleon of course.

Why. But were do you draw the line. I think that higher education is
getting more and more accesible as the need for unskilled workers
decline and our social welfare increases. Why exclude big portions from 
college and universities, making them unhappy, when giving them the
chance to attend some classes will keep them happy. The right to education
can also be used to squeal social unrest. And in the 3I Cleon needs to
keep the social unrest down.

I disagree and agree. Getting a good college education depends on INT,
but attending higher education shoul, in my view, be based on EDU alone.

But still, all will have the chance to attend, which is my point. As we
have no way of knowing how college will work three thousand years from now
on an alien planet, will have to look at the qualitative prerequests for
attendance, which in my view should only be based on EDU.

Yes cope, but why should this affect attendance, just the students ability
to finish a degree and what grade he finishes with. But this is off course
also dependent on the time used, the whole hartedness of his/her attempt,
the quality of the teachers, luck and so on. A INT 1 student could still
get a great grade at college, if everything works in his/her favor, while
a INT 15 student could wash out of college during the first month.

Actually, there are a couple of organizations working to archive the world-wide
web. Needless to say they can\'t keep up with daily changes, but stuff that\'s up
for a few weeks will in fact get permanantly stored, and with modern search
engines it would be easy to find Leroy\'s page.

Tommy, everyone gets a *chance* at higher education here as well.  We have
several hundred 2 year Junior or Community Colleges scattered across the
states and most of these have an "open" admissions policy. Some states
provide this education as a state service, others charge a tuition (a
common American belief is that "anything that costs nothing is worth
nothing, or as one of our authors said TANSTAAFL), but insure that there
are grant and loan systems in place to help the students pay for their
education.  

I teach at one of these colleges, Tommy, and our mission is to provide
quality education for the *entire* community.  Like other Community
Colleges we accept any high school graduate, and in our case non-graduates
who can enter our Adult High and preparatory programs to get their high
school or equivalence degrees.  Tommy, we take it as our responsibility to
provide whatever remediation in the basic subjects the student may require
to become successful, and for some students that is very difficult.  We
provide continuing and professional development education in a large number
of subjects to the general public.  We also provide a wide variety of
technical and trade programs for students that desire a rapid path to an
employable skill.  And that\'s not all!

Community Colleges are not simply technical or trade schools, Tommy.
Through our academic programs, leading to an Associate of Arts degrees, we
act as extended rampways into upper level Universities for students who,
for whatever reason, failed to gain entrance into Universities as freshmen.

I\'ve seen countless examples of people who simply weren\'t ready for
university on graduation from high school, some aren\'t academicly ready,
more aren\'t ready socially or psychologically.  Pushing them into that
stressful and rigorous academic environment leads to early failure and
threatens to ends many people\'s educational career before it really gets
started.

At a less stressful, more personalized, Community College students that
aren\'t yet ready have a chance to get ready.  Or, and I\'ve seen this too
many times to count, older students come to us taking another chance by
*re-entering* school many years after suffering through unsatisfying
University experiences.  Our job is to help them develop the skills they
need to compete successfully in everything from new careers to university
environments, and our *hope* is to get them excited about learning.

Another important mission of our Community Colleges is to provide job
re-training for career changers.  With people changing careers several
times during their lives, it is important to provide opportunities to learn
new skills and knowledges.  Universities, with their emphasis on research
and publication, are usually not the most appropriate place for people to
acquire new skills.  At Community colleges we concentrate on the student
developing skills *much* more than basic research.  As an example of how we
differ from universities, my advancement is based on how well I *teach* not
how much I publish; most of my work day is in the classroom and the
teaching lab, not my office or research lab.  

The university has it\'s place, and it is an extremely important one, but
in the American scheme of things it isn\'t the only route to a higher
education.  Frankly, I think community colleges do a better job of
providing low cost/high quality skill based education for the common
man.  This allows universities to focus on what they do best, research,
developing new knowledge and skills, and training future researchers.

Different cultures will have different approaches to providing higher
education, and it\'s difficult to judge another culture\'s approach when you
only look at *part* of it, or don\'t completely understand it.  I don\'t
completely understand how the system in Norway, for instance, provides all
these services so I don\'t feel I should comment on it\'s quality.

Ob Traveller, I\'ve never really liked the advanced education rules, because
I don\'t think they make good pedelogical sense. ;->  Of course, Traveller
is a game not a true model of reality so I don\'t look *too* hard at any
number of rule systems.  One thing I would like to see added is more
emphasis on retraining and continuing education during Character
Generation.  Current thinking seems to be that in high tech societies
people will change careers several times in their lives, requiring
considerable re-training at each change.  I don\'t see that directly
addressed, and it probably shouldn\'t be addressed as re-entering college to
acquire new skills.  Perhaps, the re-training should be address by the
acquisition of standard suites of skills each time a new career is entered.

=====
This is an attempt to solicit opinion on standard algorithms and data 
formats that can be used to generate UWP, star system, world maps etc. 
 This will, ideally, foster greater interchange of compatible computer 
generated data between numerous TMLers.

This message starts to solicit opinion on the idea of "published" data 
formats and algorithms before we move on to documenting those formats 
and algorithms and finding a web-site home (ideally on the Traveller 
Ring) for the final information (I do not have a web site, nor am I 
likely to have one).

Background
==========
A project I have been contemplating (as have numerous other Traveller 
players/programmers I am sure) is to write a Win 95 program to assist 
with refereeing Traveller games.  

Prime examples of the sort of program I am refering to are Jo Grant\'s 
Win 3.1 "Dulinor" (aka The Traveller Suite from CORE) and the brilliant 
DOS Galactic 2.2 by Jim Vassilakos <jimv@e2.empirenet.com>.

Dulinor and Galactic are both for the PC, as will be my own effort.  
Galactic is Public Domain, as is the source code (e-thumbs up to Jim), 
but others will doutless want to write in cgi, Java or even (gasp!) for 
the Mac.

Data Formats - UWP
==================
The UWP data format for star sytems is pretty consistent between all 
the programs I have seen, and follows the definition given by Marc 
Miller in Challenge 25.

Zenopit       1010 D130546-7    Ni Po De           622 Na
Zenopit       1010 D130546-7    Ni Po De           622 Na M8 D

The first line for Zenopit is from Galactic, the second line from a 
.sec file, which includes the Stellar type data.  Galactic uses the 
bytes after the Allegiance code (Na in the case of Zenopit) for some 
economic data.

The .sec file format is seen in several archives on the www and this 
format is similar to both the Dulinor .gni format and the Galactic .txt 
format galactic includes the Section2 program to chop a .sec format 
file into the various .text files for each sub-sector).

I will follow Jim\'s example and provide a translate option to convert 
between my format and Galactic / .gni / .sec.  There is remarkably 
little difference between my file format and the Galactic one, except 
that I plan to use a large sector file (for UWP), rather than a series 
of sub sector files a separate large sector file for more detail on any 
worlds (identical to the system-by-system .loc (location information) 
files in Galactic).  My jump route data is also easily interchanged 
with the jump route data in Galactic.

Data Formats - Extensions to UWP
================================
As mentioned briefly above, Galactic uses bytes 59 to 61 for LRX data 
(life, resorces, exports), whereas .sec and .gni files store the 
stellar data - up to three stars - in bytes 59 to 74.  Fortunately, 
Galactic is well documented so that the alternate use of bytes 59 to 61 
is clear.  I expect that some people will want to create Pocket Empires 
economic codes to add to the UWP data files.

Algorithm - Extension to UWP
============================
I think it would be a good idea to have (at the very least) an agreed 
format for the PE economic data in a UWP file.  I think it would be 
even better it there was a reproducable algorithm (based on the UWP, 
hex number and my height in cm) that means that any TMLer could 
generate the same PE data for each planet in a .sec file.  This would 
allow adventures to be set using the same "economic" data, so that an 
adventure set on grain exporting Planet X was the same grain exporting 
planet in my universe.  People who use there own universe could 
generate PE data differently, but I see an advantage in computer 
programs all aooffering "the TML way" as an alternative, even if it is 
not the only method.

Algorithm - Naming
==================
Galactic uses text files with lists of Aslan / Vargr / Vilani / etc 
words in them to choose planet names.  Dulinor uses random name 
generation using Vilani letter frequency tables (I assume these are 
from p94 of the MT Referee\'s Companion).  I propose to use letter 
frequency tables, like those published at: 

www.interlog.com/~dmci104/GamingClub/Traveller/languages.html

It would be good if we had an agreed algorithm so that, for example, we 
can generate names for the numerous un-named sub-sectors and, 
occasionally, un-named worlds in some of the .sec files available on 
the web.

Algorithm - random number generation
====================================
There are various methods available that would allow reproducible 
"random" numbers to be generated from a 32-bit seed, a UWP + hex 
number, or whatever.

Is anyone out there able to suggest suitable replacement algorithm(s) 
for the  random number generators in QuickBasic, Pascal (Delphi in my 
case), C++, etc?  

My original (1987 to 1889) attempt at a sector generator stored a 
32-bit seed with each system.  This was used to generate the same 
system data (number of orbits, UWP of all other bodies in the star 
system, WBH data, imports/exports, planetary surface maps, encounter 
tables, etc) on each visit to the system.  Planet positions were 
calculated based on the (game) date and the (seed-generated) positions 
at year 0, day 0.  This approach (would have) allowed me to 
significantly reduce the data file size, while still having consistent 
data from visit to visit by the players.  I say "would have" because I 
never finished the program, as I was stuck in the days of monochrome 
graphics and no access to the TML.

What my program will do (tentative feature list)
================================================
The brilliant Galactic 2.2 has stolen most of my thunder, but I don\'t 
mind :-).  All of the features of Galactic 2.2 are reproduced in my 
program, plus a few more goodies (undoubtedly planned for Galactic 2.3)

My progam will be written in Delphi 3.0 for Windows 95 (or NT) with 
lots of pointless floating toolbars and pop-up menus to show off how 
clever I am :-)

Display Universe
- - show available sectors on a map like the old "known space" map that
  GDW distributed back in the early CT days.  Users can generate new
  data to fill in unknown sectors, or import data from other sorces
  (like Dulinor, Galactic, a web site I missed, etc)
- - Zoom in to Sector level

Display existing sector data files
- - hex grid or "staggered squares" of Atlas of the Imperium
- - show X-boat routes (as Galactic)
- - show trade routes (like Imperiallines in The Traveller Adventure)
- - hex data includes GG and base symbols (as Dulinor)
- - zoom into subsector level (same feature list)
- - zoom into system (one hex) level

Edit sector data
- - easy click-and-drag method to add X-boat routes
- - generate X-boat routes (similar to Galactic "homebrew" method)
- - regress/progress UWP to another Milieu
- - <others I have in a paper file somewhere>

Display system data
- - UWP + stellar data + WBH data + PE economic profile
- - star system map (as in The Long Way Home)
- - star system map (elliptial orbits showing position of planets,
  100 diameter jump limits)
- - planet-to-planet travel times

Trade Data
- - generate prices for speculative cargoes players have to sell
- - generate speculative cargoes available for purchase
- - generate passngers and freight to next destination

Patrons and rumors
- - look in (referee written) file to see which patrons or rumours fit
  the current location (e.g. wine shipments from Ag world), remind
  referee and players of previous contacts on this world.
- - editor to enter those patron and rumor details easily

Print out (if Delphi printing is as simple as I think
- - print out one subsector + UWP on a page (CT Supplement 3)
- - print out four subsectors on a page (4 pages = large sector map)
- - print out one sector on a page (Atlas of the Imperium)

Screen and print out displays can show (or not)
Starport
GG, Water present
Hi Pop (name in uppercase)
X-boat routes
etc

This allows the referee to prepare a player hand out with missing 
information that the players will be able to write on this as they 
explore and survey the systems in detail.

Some people like the idea of using a computer while playing Traveller, 
others believe it detracts from the role playing.  I\'m all in favour of 
computers during SF games (I think it adds to the "feel" and allows the 
referee to access all sorts of data he might otherwise not have 
available).  I also like the idea of a list of cargoes flashing up on 
the screen with (for the players) an annoying wait while they find out 
what is available.


I await the TML response!

    'body' => 'Most of the discussion about the \'anomalous\' RoM tech levels has been about
whether it is plausible or whether it conforms to Traveller canon. My
concern is somewhat different; whether it makes for an enjoyable campaign.
A campaign with lots of advanced relic technology lying around for the
taking makes some kinds of adventures, like treasure hunting and skirmishes
with powerful individuals, very plausible. Certainly a campaign like this
can be interesting. I am certain of this because there has already been a
Traveller campaign like this, The New Era.

One of my hopes for Traveller was that it could be used for many different
kinds of adventures; space opera, interstellar warfare, trade and commerce,
exploration of the unknown, or intrigue in a complex interstellar
civilization. The enormous scale of the Third Imperium, in both time and
space, would seem to make this easy. Consider the enormous social,
political, and economic changes here on Earth over the last 500 or so
years. The potential for different campaign environments in Traveller
should be even greater; there could be eras of military conquest, of
peaceful economic expansion, of socal stagnation, of civil war, of
corporate dominance, or widespread balkanization. In one era the emperor
could be the embodiment of respect and loyalty, in another a mere
figurehead, a military dictator, a corrupt autocrat, an elected bureaucrat,
an alien overlord, an idealistic psionicist, a pragmatic businessperson,
the possibilities are endless.

The effects of changing tech levels could also strongly affect the campaign
environments. In one era huge battleships could rule space, while in
another squadrons of fighters dominate. Referees could run whatever kind of
campaign they prefer, all during the millenia-long history of the Third
Imperium.

Unfortunately, this is not what is happening. The society, environment, and
technology of all Traveller milieus are all very similar. The nobility,
scout service, navy, megacorporations, psionic institutes, alien
governments, Traveller\'s Aid society, and social infrastructure seem to
have had no significant changes in over one thousand years. The various
Imperia seem to have learned nothing about the Ancients, human prehistory,
the origins of psionics, or to have founded any completely new institutions
in many millennia

Now I have no opinions on whether this is \'realistic\' or \'canon\' at all, my
concern is that this tends to make Traveller very limited and
steriotypical. Many interesting adventures and campaigns just won\'t fit
anywhere in Traveller. Several referees have said Milieu 1100 is "the best"
setting because it incorporates every canon Traveller setting.
Unfortunately, they are right.

I agree Milieu 0 has a few new ideas; Pocket Empires has rules for new
campaign settings which have never been well described before. However
mostly it is a rehash of CT society in a TNE setting. There should be
something unique about Milieu 0 if it is to remain a viable campaign
setting after the release of later milieus. Can anyone suggest institutions
or background material that would make Milieu 0 unique? There was a thread
a while ago about a secret noble society (the "Templars") which had
campaign potential until it exploded in a burst of hyperbole. In my
campaign a major theme is accusations of corruption and disloyalty in the
Scout service. Any other ideas?

IIRC only sort of, and more because of the (then) current attitude 
towards non-approved (i.e. non-christian) writings than because of 
the autual loss of the books themselves. However the book burnings 
did set back literature a long, long way, and some works have been 
lost for ever.

Nope, it wasn\'t a Caliph, or any other sort of Arab, Infidel , etc. 
but a Roman (Eastern, or Byzantine, admittedly) and very Christian 
Emperor, and it was because the books were non-christian, the authors 
having had the bad sense to be mainly pre-christian Greeks. 
Supposedly his orders were to only burn the books that were on a list 
of banned texts, but the men carring them out were over-zealous and 
set fire to the whole library, along with various students and 
librarians who objected.

I\'m not involved in this debate, but Dave you are making an excellent
point.  Whether or not the devices could be duplicated, knowledge of what
did and did not exist would help guide the recovery of technology.

The point that "greek fire" can\'t be duplicated is well taken, but not
conclusive.  We *can* produce chemicals with similar effects, even if we
can\'t produce the original item.

All of the features listed under these headings sound great, especially
the patron rumour section.  Will this be big enough that you could
attach an entire adventure written on one planet?  

Also, in the star mapping section, could you draw lines between the star
systems as kind of a map of where the players have gone?

With the zooming feature.  It should go:

Universe --> Domain --> Sector --> Subsector --> System --> World Map

Perhaps even going furhter than that to a choice of referee prepared
maps of this planet\'s surface (ie. a city made for an adventure, etc.). 
Perhaps a program included to automatically generate a city or
wilderness area when you zoom in furhter than the world map.

If I had a laptop computer, I\'d be using it at every game session I went
to.  The program sounds great, especially if you can get it done well
(which I\'m confiden you can).  My only question, as Dave Golden said
already is when?

   Yes, but there are a number of problems with the assumptions in that

   Even in the wildest predictions by the most extreme (yet still sane)
ecologists, the oceans of Terra would not rise the amount indicated. 
Why?  Even at our current rate of global warming (1 degree per 200
years) cheap, affordable fusion power would cause any man-made causes to
dwindle to basically zero before the end of the next century.  Global
terraforming and ecological management would clean up any remaining
damage and bring temperatures back down to the normal 12.5 degrees
centigrade (*not* 15 as was reported in Book 6: Scouts and elsewhere).

   The Nile Valley, Florida, and a lot of other places DGP claimed were
flooded simply would not be.

>  The pyramids are a major tourist site, and extra sectret passages have 
> been discovered using densitometers (including a hollow Sphinx).

   Much as modern Italians started making pizzas because American
tourists were disappointed when they couldn\'t find it when they visited
Italy, a number of historical sites on Terra would be recreated so that
tourists from other worlds would not be disappointed when they visited
Earth.

   The fact is that the Great Pyramids and the Sphinx are in *mortal*
danger in the late 20th century from pollution, the ravages of tourists,
weathering, and the increased humidity levels around the site where
these great monuments are located.  The Sphinx in fact is probably only
still around today because it spent many centuries buried in the sand,
protected from the environment.  While the Egyptian government is
currently taking steps to preserve them, it is highly unlikely that the
original Pyramids and Sphinx will be around in the 57th century.

   My explanation of the cover of TD 13:

   In the background are detailed replicas of the original Sphinx and
Great Pyramids which were built in the early 23rd century.  The project
was begun by a reclusive billionarie and amateur Egyptologist Akeem
Mohamed Ali Banadar.  Banadar hoped to turn the site of the ruins of the
original structures (which were virtually destroyed by the ravages of
weathering and pollution during the 20th and early 21st centuries) and
some adjacent land into an amusement park and museum.  Half way through
the costly project (which is rumored to have cost Banadar most of his
fortune), it was abandoned, and taken over by regional authorities. 
Some 50 years later, the project was finally completed and opened to the
public.  Constructed using techniques that simulated the results
achieved by the original builders, the structures do in fact contain
some 15 percent of the original stones.  While some weathering of the
new structures has taken place over the centuries, preservation
techniques developed in the 24th century and refined since the Imperial
era will insure that the replica structures will be around for many more
centuries to come.

   Also in the background we can see the some of results of terraforming
process that was begun on Earth in the early to mid-22nd century.  Egypt
is now a green, lush land where a great deal of agricultural production
takes place.  Production in the Nile Valley frequently exceeds that of
the Mississippi Valley on an annual basis.  The Great Archology of Cairo
can be seen in the far distance--its current population is around 5
million.

   It depends on how much slipage you are talking about.  From TL 12 to
10 would be possible, if the tech level of the world depended upon
imports from other worlds.  Given that the Rule of Man had a more or
less integrated economy by -1776, it is possible that such slippage
would occur.

   Larger scale collapse, from TL 16 to TL 10 or so would probably only
happen if there were some kind of collapse of the planet\'s society,
brought on by nuclear war or perhaps some kind of superweapon....

   Gee, maybe Leroy was right and the RoM did achieve TL 16, only to be
knocked down by Virus!  History has a way of repeating itself you know.

   More diffficult today for sure, but history is filled with examples
of peoples who knew how to construct something (the Romans, the Mayans,
the Egyptians, etc.) and later lost that knowledge.  Sometimes that
knowledge was later recovered (through the studying of copies of old
manuscripts as happened during the Renaissance), or new methods
developed that were better than the original (i.e. napalm is better than
Greek Fire).

I quite like this as a way to model the Traveller conan universe, but 
again Fusion+ rears its (exceedingly) ugly head. As a unique never 
before discovered invention it pretty much has to be the result of a 
stroke of genius by one (or a few) individuals.

 If Fusion+ is discoverable by normal means the TL12 RoM must have 
found it, after all their technological tradition descends from ours 
(or something pretty close), and we place a very high emphasis on 
mass and volume efficiency, which is even more important in a space 
vessel. So unless the Terrans developed a K\'Kree style dislike of 
small ships I just can\'t see them missing such a vital piece of 
minaturization tech, unless it\'s only discoverable by a massive 
\'accident\', in which case the theory of massive investment for hi-TL 
advancement is flawed.

   Due to recent studies, we have pretty much figured it out.  Same for
Greek Fire, by the way.  Thing is, we could build the Great Pyramids
today using less people, *but* at significantly higher cost.  So high a
cost, it just isn\'t an economically viable project (though the crude
imitation of one built as a casino with modern materials in Las Vegas
does good business).

   And people wonder how Virus could be so devastating?  There\'s your
answer.  It\'s not what it does to starships, but what it does to the
infrastructures of worlds that makes it a true superweapon.

   The farther a society falls, the more you have to resort to cataclysm
to explain it.  When it is the Romans going from TL 2 to 1 or the Mayans
going from TL 1 to 0 that one thing but the fall from 14 to 10 would be
hard to justify with just a simple economic depression (or even the fall
of an empire).

   Fine, but this doesn\'t justify TL 14 as of yet.

   Nice try, but I see no reason why this system doesn\'t make the best,
highest quality TL 12 vacc suits in Known Space instead of the TL 14
models you say are possible.

   True enough, but it didn\'t strike equally hard everywhere, and
explaining away significant drops in TL gets to be challenging in that
kind of environment.  Aside from the canon material, a drop from TL 12
to 10 or 11 is just a heck of a lot easier to rationalize.

Two anecdotes regarding the Pyramids -- I have always been puzzled with
people who hold to  the notion that the Ancient Egyptians needed some kind of
supernateral assistance to build the Pyramids, but make no mention of the
Romans (a couple of thousand years later, and with the benefit of iron
tools), who had a couple of enginering feats that boggle the imaginations of
the few who know about them.

#1. In a city called Baalbek, in what is now Lebanon, there is a temple built
upon three large (1000+ short tons) stone slabs, which were moved 50 miles or
so from mountain quarries. The largest stone is something like 1200 tons, and
was moved in one chunk.

#2. In the 16th century, Italian engineers engaged in the construction of St
Peters relocated a 600-ton obelisk about a mile. They were about to attach a
plaque prclaiming it to be the engineering feat of all time until it was
pointed out to them that the obelisk had been moved from _Egypt_ 1400 years
earlier -- Taken down, put on a barge, sailed down the Nile, across the Med,
up the Tiber, and re-erected in beautiful downtown Roma, all without so much
as a crack. This was all accomplished with muscle, rope,
levers/wedges/pulleys/inclined planes and a _lot_ of ingenuity...same things
the Egyptians used.

Nobody ever says the Romans had ETs helping them (Its the sort of thing Pliny
the Elder would have mentioned, I think...ghod knows he talked about
everything else). Frank said that\'s because it is the sort of thing you
expect of the Romans.

   The fire I believe you are talking about happened in 391 A.D. and was
the result of a mob of *Christians* storming the place, not Moslems (who
weren\'t even around yet) as someone else said.

   We owe a debt of gratitude to the Moslems for preserving many of the
works by the Greeks and Romans related to mathematics and the sciences. 
Of course the minarets they installed on Hagia Sophia in Constantinople
(now Istanbul) are a bit of an eye sore (not to mention what they did in
turning other Christian churches into Mosques), but then I speak from
the pro-Byzantine perspective....

   On balance we know what we know about the Greeks and Romans because
of the preservation efforts of the Moslems, the Byzantines, and the many
Roman Catholic monks who spent their lives transcribing ancient
documents.  While the loss of the Library at Alexandria was a tragic
loss, pieces of the knowledge contained there could be found elsewhere.

Regards,

Harold

P.S.  I recall that a while back, some archeologists found buried in the
basement of the Library numerous scrolls which the Christian fanatics
missed.  Not all was lost apparently.

   I place the whole thing in the same category as "space fighters
didn\'t exist until fusion plus", even though they are featured
prominently in the game Imperium.  If you examine the evidence too
closely this stuff falls apart, so those who support it would rather
resort to relativism in an attempt to fog the issue enough so that the
masses will accept it.

   We of course know better.

   Carl tended to exaggerate.  By the time the Library was burned, far
more knowledge had already been lost.  Compare the artwork of 150 AD to
that of 350 AD.  The later stuff is much more primitive.  Knowledge of
architecture was also being lost as well (thanks to the Roman caste
system).  Having watched Cosmos, I can tell you that Carl had the Greeks
building starships by now.  Horse crap.  The Greeks were long past their
prime by 350, and only the Byzantine revival under Justinian the Great
saved them from total collapse.  The fact that they held on until 1453
was due to a combination of luck, convenience, and the impregnable walls
of Constantinople (impregnable until a mercenary bombard maker named
Urban built canon for the Turks large enough to blast the walls down),
not Greek virtue.

No way. We have superconductors in our ships doing that (I think DGP called
them metaconductors and supposed they\'re developed at TL9+ as room temp
SC). the problem is that SC cannot take any amounts of current - too much
and they lose their SC ability. Add to price, volume etc but do NOT require
more power as if we\'re using SC either next to no loss or a cable burnout
and thus no power.
The stuff mined in "Uraqaydn of the seven pillars" was supernova created
duodecimates from the mythical isotopical island of stability thet made
manufacturing room temp SC cheap and durable. From the top of my head that
is.

I think we have two separate questions here:

Q1: What music (kind) would the Imperium use as an anthem?
A1: Lots of musical theory this and that abolish the twelve tone scale,
atonal, subsonic thudding, blab blab. Could be pretty interesting perhaps -
at least for music theory buffs but to me it is as dull as those FF&S
discussions must be for natural science challenged.

Q2: What music should I play to make my players feel they\'re listening to
the Imperial anthem?
A2: Darth Vaders march (or is it Imperial march) from Empire soundtrack.
Brian Eno Atmospheres for serene deep space feel and Pink Floyd Set the
controls for the heart of the sun after getting clobbered in space battle.

In all honesty Mike, I view the 2000cr as TL8 SPB Credits, for recharge
and
regular maitinance. So the higher tech and better port, the lower the
cost.
Liners and Merchantmen on regular routes use the 2 week recharge as

Whilest, Private ships and Explorers buy stocks ahead of time. The rate
in 
my games has 500cr and .1m^3 per week after the 1st 2 weeks. This covers
food and sudries plus common replacement parts.

There is a researcher in The Traveller adventure who is searching for
pyramids. The ref may put them wherever he feels like according to the book
(in the Aramis subsector). There\'s a library data note about pyramids in
the earlier CT materials that state something about them being evident here
and there (I think Marc and others were toying with the idea that the earth
pyramids were built by the Ancients before deciding on the <real> truth
about the Ancients).

There was a creepy horror adventure dealing with Zhodani and researchers in
an underwater pyramid in one of the JTAS. Then of course we have the older
Imperial palaces before they took flight that were assemblies of pyramids
supposedly there for making gravassisted infantry assault harder. If I
remember correctly the ship in one of Horde/Chamax plague looked like a
pyramid at first sight but upon closer investigation resembled a 1950s They
came from beyond this or that movie saucer.

The largest problem with fusion is its availability and cheapness. When
every country on earth got fusion the waste heat (ALL produced power will
be waste heat eventually) warmed the earth much more than the puny changes
that the Co2 gasses ever did here. Another big problem is urbanization
which decreases the earths albedo by darkening the ground (asphalt and most
roof material are darker than the average earth).

I\'m not saying you\'re wrong, just throwing some bones to the flock.

The reason RoM never discovered Fusion+ was that cold fusion was so heavily
discredited during the 20th century that no researcher dared try it later
on - especially when normal fusion worked so well. Most Solomani
researchers who even knew about the cold fusion thing thought of it as the
search for the ether between 19th and 20th century.
The cold fusion idea got adopted by the UFO, Ley lines, abductions, ghosts,
spoonbending community who thought the large multinational fusion
industries together with BIG science hid the wonders of cold fusion from
the people of earth lest they\'d lose theor cashcows.

I\'m joking a bit but as from a 3d Imperium point of view the Solomani were
mostly laughing stock militaristic idiots that won the interstellar war by
bio warfare but their propaganda machine later changed that to mesonguns
etc.

Fusion+ is a strange beast. There are significant hints in M:0 that do
indicate that Fusion+ could be a recovered RoM technology, nothing
definite, but the history of its development allows for that possibility
(hows about that for sitting firmly on the fence). As to fighters, there
are ways other than Fusion+ to get small power plants, fission springs
to mind. The fighters in Imperium are described as "small craft
designed for tactical combat. They are incapable of either sublight
movement or hyperspace jumps...." They cost the same as scouts
to produce In combat terms they sit between destroyers and scouts.
My take on them would be a SDB type vessel. Their high screen
factor certainly would support this, basically they\'re a scout with
no jump drive and more weapons and screens.

I\'d slightly disagree; I think Russia/USSR\'s problem was not lack of 
technology but lack of mass production technology.  To take the 
example of aircraft, the Soviets produced arguably the best fighter 
aircraft of the \'30s (a stressed-skin monoplane like WW2 fighters, 
the name of which utterly escapes me) and suffered not from lack of 
technology but lack of infrastructure and technological integration.

In other words, they could have wonderful aircraft but lousy 
electronics -- like importing radios in WW2 for their Sturmovik 
ground attack aircraft, the lack of unit-level radio gear in their 
tank squadrons, etc..  Actually, tanks are another good example: the 
T34 was a brilliant design which could be built OK.

Having said which, I think the broad thrust of your point is 
absolutely correct, and I\'m open to correction on matters of detail 
8-)

    Oh really? <evil grin> I\'ll give you an example.  Recently I tried to find
a simple timeline or chronology of human history on the web.  From the Early
1400\'s onwards would have been sufficent, and I know there must be a couple
somewhere out there on the web.  Unfortunately all your search engines couldn\'t
find one, and I went through ALL of them. ;)
    Remember, the web is being indexed as we go along creating it and it\'s not
doing all that great a job of it either.  Your search engines depend on the
information telling them they exist.  But in the situation of the Long Night
we\'re talking about there being just raw data in many cases.  No indexes, no
organization, just the Data surviving and sometimes that\'s corrupted too. ;)

> Next example?
    Sure you have 10^11 PAGES of raw data.  Everything from gardening books to
medical texts to childrens books to anti-grav test data.  There is no
organization, no index, no rhyme or reason as to how it\'s stored, it just is.
How Long do you think it\'s going to take to go through it all, identify and
organize it all?  (Hint: The National Archives of the US has over a million
pages of documents from the 1940\'s and onwards they STILL haven\'t reviewed in
the past 40 years of continuous work so be very generous in your estimates.)

You know, I mnust be clueless, because I fail to understand why it isn\'t 
possible for a culture using TL 12 computers to _mechanically_ sort through 
and discard most of this vast mass of data before any human has to search 
through the rest. And that\'s if the data is really as jumbled as you imply
in your example. In \'reality\' we\'re talking about data that has already 
been organized. Take your average library (a much better example than your
warehouse) and burn the filing system. Now give me a few months to go over
the shelves and I\'ll provide you with an overview of how the books in that
library is organized.

So please explain to me how it can take someone 450 years to dig out "lost"
information.

Well, here it is you who fail to grasp my point. I don\'t dispute that 
proprietary information can be lost. What I dispute is the notion that 
information can be spread across an interstellar empire the size of the RoM 
for several centuries and still remain propritary. The day Coca Cola wants
to sell colas on Dingir they _have_ to share the big secret with someone on
Dingir. Read what _I_ wrote. I don\'t dispute that information can be lost.
I dispute that it can be lost _everywhere_ once it has been sufficiently
disseminated. And I claim that for the RoM as a whole to be TL X, the TL X
information has to be _widely_ disseminated.

Free market ecomomics does not *include* human rights -- the 
political tensions in the major economic powers reflect the need to 
balance the demands of the market and human rights (in the broad 
sense, i.e. social provision on the basis of need).  They may exist 
or not.

I\'m not saying that people need to be excluded from a college 
education -- I\'m saying that they will exclude themselves.  There is 
a difference between a college education and learning skills as a 
worker, too (trust me, I\'m a doctor 8-) and in fact a problem here in 
the UK is there are too many people with degrees and too few skilled 
workers.  A technophilic society like the 3I will need a lot of 
skilled technicians.

I repeat: I believe that the majority of such training (whether by 
day relaease to college, structured learning by computer, company 
seminars or tranked DeepTeach) is best reflected as skills gained 
during character generation rather than a formal period of college 
education in the traditional degree sense of the word.

Even if it is possible for a low INT, low EDU character to attend 
school, who pays?  Not the government -- they\'d rather subsidise the 
education of the average skilled worker "in partnership with 
industry" which is a lot cheaper per capita and brings greater 
economic benefit.  Often not the family -- low EDU is partly a factor 
of not being able to afford a good education -- unless the nobility 
are involved.  And loan companies would only do it if they saw a 
decent return on their investment, which is unlikely: the jobs will 
go preferentially to the higher-EDU/INT candidates, and the 20% of 
unskilled jobs will go to the least able fraction of the population.

I think high INT should certainly be an alternative route in.  Low 
INT really ought to be a massive penalty tho\': how many colleges will 
take INT 2 candidates for astrophysics?  How many INT 2 18 year olds 
will apply?

My point is that part-time skills classes are not the same as 
attending college (in RL or in the Traveller systems), and will be 
far more common -- and usually sponsored by industry.  The student as 
seeker after knowledge will be limited to bright scholarship kids 
and the well-off, and only they will have the opportunity to learn 
in comparative freedom.

One reason for this in T4 would be the Vilani influences on Sylea: 
the apprenticeship/caste system would probably have survived in some 
form, which would weight things towards a skill training by employers 
model.

We do have some cultural details -- there\'s a nobility, high 
technology, autonomous local (world) governments, and a rule of 
market forces.

There are some knowledge-based subjects where this might be true, 
although even there a certain amount of sophisticated thought is 
required -- historical argument does have its subtleties, for 
instance.  Astrophysics and molecular quantum mechanics require a 
certain amount of INT to understand the basic concepts, full stop.  
(I think it was Asimov who wrote that he breezed through maths up to 
tensor calculus and then couldn\'t do any more.  Higher maths may just 
be INT F material.)  Some of this is training, but not all IMO.

You could send an INT 1 individual to college for 4 years, and they 
could spend the time very profitably, learning some facts here and 
there (+1 Edu), some basic skills (Writing-1, Admin-1, Mechanic-1) or 
whatever, but they\'re not going to learn the abstract reasoning that 
a degree in whatever subject implies, IMO.

	Well, time to run the numbers:

Bertha Bedridden: 223777

x: 2+2+2=6.  6/3=2.
DL(raw): 2+2=4
Therefore Bertha\'s max number of damage dice is 4.

Bob Subormal: 456777

x: 2+3+3=8. 8/3= 2.666.  Therefore x=3.
DL(raw): 3+2=5
Therefore Bob\'s max number of damage dice is 5.

Joe Blow: 777777

x: 3+3+3=9.  9/3=3.
DL(raw): 3+2=5
Therefore Joe\'s max number of damage dice is 5.

Edna Exceptional: A9A777

x: 4+3+4=11.  11/3=3.666.
DL(raw): 3.666+1.914=5.58
Therefore Edna\'s max number of damage dice is 6.

Steve Steroidcase: DBC777

x: 4+4+4=12.  12/3=4.
DL(raw): 4+2=6
Therefore Steve\'s max number of damage dice is 6.

	This strikes me as a little high, so perhaps if the final max
damage dice were DL-1 this would normalize.  This would give Bertha a max
DD of 3, Bob and Joe max DDs of 4, and Edna and Steve max DDs of 5.

	This seems to be a little more in line.  3 DD strikes me as being a
bare minimum, really.  Let\'s examine the case of each of these being shot
by a 5 damage dice ACR:

It strikes me that someone as feeble as Bertha shouldn\'t really be able to
stay on their feet after getting shot by a 5 DD ACR regardless (let alone a
10 DD FS 6.66 GME :>).   Assuming minimal damage rolls (snakeyes), Bertha
is guaranteed to be dropped and assuming average rolls (working out to 3
points per die) will die on the spot.  Try shooting some senior citizens
with an M-16 sometime to test this.  This seems realistic to me.

	Bob and Joe will probably be felled by an ACR round too, assuming
average rolls.  Bob stands a good chance of getting severely wounded, and
will probably die a lot of the time.  Even snakeyes on a damage roll will
badly cramp their style and might drop Bob. A max damage roll (6 points per
die) will kill both of them dead, which is as it should be.  I honestly
don\'t think that average or below-average physical specimens should be able
to shrug off getting shot by an assault weapon.

	Looking at the two high-end characters, under the revised numbers
Edna will likely go down after an average ACR hit, but a minimal hit won\'t
slow her down too badly.  A max damage hit will just barely kill her.
Steve OTOH can almost shrug off a minimal damage hit, has a 1 in 3 chance
of staying on his feet after an average hit, but is guaranteed to be felled
(but not killed on the spot) by a max damage roll.  This sounds good to me.

	If you\'re using something like Glenn\'s hit location table, as I am,
which models the post-injury effects of getting shot, I think that this
modification to the rules would produce realistic results.  Using double
and triple damage called shots (such as called shots to the head say) will
also add a significant amount of lethality to the process :).  Getting shot
in the heart or head with, say, an ACR round ought to seriously mess
someone up, and I think that this would be the result using this rule.

	So, to restate my modified maximum damage dice house rule:

*******

In order to determine the maximum number of damage dice from a
non-explosive slug hit applicable to a given character, perform the
following calculation:

1) [sqrt(STR)+sqrt(DEX)+sqrt(End) all rounded up]/3=x.

2) x+sqrt(x) rounded up = DL(raw)

3) if DL(raw)<3 then DL=3

4) if DL(raw) is equal to or greater than 3, Dl(raw)=DL

5) DL-1= the maximum number of damage dice that can be rolled against that
character.

Use in conjunction with the called shots rule and Glenn Grant\'s hit
location table to model effects of shots hitting vital organs and
post-impact injury effects.

*******

I would hazard a guess of "wherever a race first started building
permanent structures." (I mean first as in when they first do so on
their homeworld, not interstellar colonies).  A pyramid is the
easiest way to make something tall if you don\'t have advanced
materials (as any kid making a sand castle knows).  The first ones would 8
be earthen mounds, then, later stone.

I don\'t know about _easy_, but the fact is that they were built by
people with simpler materials than we now have, so it wasn\'t all
that hard (though I\'m sure it was quite challenging).

They were built in mesoamerica, too, BTW (in jungle, no less (not a
"dry heat")).  :-)

The bottom line is that we know that they were built, and we know
what limitations they had on materials----so we could redo it if we
chose to (though it might really end up an issue of how willing
modern people would be to kill off workers doing it by hand).

   Re: The relatively high GNP\'s of China and India compared to the US.

   Remember that in PE, GNP is defined in terms of manufacturing
   capability, not the ability to make money.  PE excludes `cultural
   costs\' like news and entertainment media, beauty solons, video
   arcades, RPG companies and high finance from the `productive\'
   economy.  The US Government includes all such economic activity in
   the GNP\'s it measures for the countries of the world.

   Classic example: The baskets that a Somali woman weaves for her
   village without recompense are not counted in Somalia\'s GNP, but the
   salary of an air force officer manning a missile silo waiting for
   WWIII not to start is counted in the US\'s GNP.  Which individual is
   more economically productive?

   If you subtract out the US\'s consumerism (ie divide by the `culture\'
   factor, which would be quite high for the US), I would not be
   surprised to learn that China and the US really do outproduce us, not
   in dollars, obviously, but in `RU\'s\'.

   I had always thought that the Christian mob attacked Hypatia because
   she backed the Jews in a power struggle/riot which had torn the city
   apart at that time, not because they feared ancient knowlege.  In
   fact, many of the most influential orthodox bishops at that time had
   studied under Hypatia at Alexandria; her death was a great blow to
   the church in the view of its leaders.

   Also, I seem to recall that the Library was wacked for the /last/
   time by the Mongols, much later than the 5th century,  though perhaps
   I\'m confusing Alexandria with some other place on this point.

Not to get into a debate about global warming...but there are certainly
predictions by sane atmospheric scientists/climate modellers (not
ecologists!) that predict warming higher than 1 degree per 200 years -
1 degree C per 50 years is probably about the median of the high
predictions. (Balanced by the no-warming-at-all predictions, of 
course.)

>cheap, affordable fusion power

Aha! Now we have an explanation! In T4, although the Terrans get
fusion power early in the 21st century, they don\'t get fusion reactors
small enough to power individual vehicles until TL12 - so there\'s a
couple more centuries of burning fossil fuels in vehicles of all
sorts. (Electric vehicles will also be popular - but it\'s surprisingly
hard to design a battery-powered grav vehicle with CSC or FFS.) 
That\'ll help a little. Also note that global climate change temperature
estimates are just that, global - you can have much higher (or lower)
local climate changes; possibly enough to change rainfall patterns
enough to raise the Nile, for example.

Newsweek had a great article on this idea about two or three years ago. I
don\'t recall the specifics, but it involved the eventual manned mission to
Mars.

It\'s extremely expensive to send a team of people to Mars with enough fuel
for a round trip, so someone devised a plan by which an unmanned craft
would be sent first. This craft would land on Mars and immediately begin
extracting methane from Mars\' atmosphere to build up a fuel supply in a
large tank of some sort.

The manned mission would then take off for Mars with just enough fuel for a
one-way trip. They would arrive at Mars, take "one small step," do whatever
experiments they wanted to do, and refuel their craft with the fuel that
the first craft extracted from the Martian atmosphere. Then they\'d return
home.

I forget what the savings were but I do recall they were significant. I
like the fact that NASA\'s being much more cost-conscious these days. Not
only does it save taxpayers\' money, but being efficiency minded can only
help to develop better spacecraft.

I recall that the article estimated the first manned mission to Mars
occurring some time in the 2020s, but last night I heard that the first
manned mission could be as soon as 2011!

And yes, Mark, your synopses were appreciated!

I saw a show on TV a few years ago where a bunch of people got 
together to do exactly that: using nothing but their own sweat and
some ropes and logs, they were able to move huge blocks of rock
far enough to prove that the pyramids could have been built that way.

I disagree to some extent.  Perhaps there is a more detailed way of looking
at this question.  I am willing to bet for example that many Naval and
Military vessels are built with swift repair in mind.   Electronics will
all be in prepackaged "modular" form similar to the way modern PCs are
usually made.  Also, SSDS and other construction "sets" do not include any
cost of actually assembling the ships, so we must assume that the cost of
assembly is part of the cost of the components.

Now, that\'s not to say that the particular ship that is being repaired is
going to be compatible with the parts the starport or spaceport has in
stock.  Also, some parts (hull plates, twisted bulkheads, etc.) may need to
be fabricated or repaired in place.

Making it up as I go along, how\'s this for a guesstimate;

Basic Chance that the starport has a specific replacement part for the ship
being repaired (Radios, sensors, laser focussing elements, fusion plant
heating antenna, etc.) To be used when there is a reason to doubt;

Roll 2D, on 7+ it has the part.

Modifiers (negative = lesser chance);
Per 5 years of ship age since manufacture;  -1 (Including 1st 5 years)
A class starport +1
B class starport  no modifier
C class starport -3
D class starport -6
Location of repair is location of manufacturer +4
Within 5 parsecs of mfgr +3
Within 10 parsecs of mfgr +2
Within 20 "   "    "    "    "  +1
Further than 40 Parsecs of mfgr -1
Mfgr is not from the Imperium (assumes reparis happen within Imperial
borders) -3
(add to distance modifier, if applicable)
Same part has been reparied or replaced since vehicle mfgr: Use age of part
rather than age of ship to determine die modifier.

So, A 40 year old ship has lost its Radio to battle damage.  Age gives a -8.
They go to an A class starport within 10 Pc. of the ships builder. +1 for A
Stp, +2 for range to builder.
The Radio is original and Imperial, so the Roll of a 9 has 8 subtracted and
three added for a final result of 4:  The part is unavailable.

Let\'s assume they rolled an 12 (final result of 7, but a 12 would always
succeed anyway).

Price uses the same roll with the following additional modifiers;
(Ex-)Military Vessel; +2

Result is % of new "cost" to be paid for the part (Exclusive of
insallation) Per the construction rules of your choice.
Modified Roll          Result
- ----                     ----
2-                      300%
3                       200%
4                       175%
5                       150%
6                       130%
7                       120%
8                       110%
9                       105%
10                     100%
11                      95%
12                      90%
13+                    80%

You could easily end up with a +6 on a new ship (even a new one gets a -1
for being 0-5 years old) at an A class starport within 5 pc of the
manufacturer.  At 80% you are paying for a part currently being
manufactured in quantity somewhere nearby.  The "cost" in the construction
rules includes the cost of assembling the ship, so this is relatively
consistent.

If the ship was made by a Megacorp like Ling Standard, I would say you were
never more than 5 Pc away from the Manufacturer unless you were well off
the Xboat route.

Of course, even in the first example an A class starport is going to have
radios, but in this case the ship will need it\'s communications \'net
replaced, the ancient EMS array modified to suit or replaced, and any
components affected by such a replacement either modified or replaced.
Alternatively, a source for used parts may be sought, or a jury-rigged
solution using the skill level of one of the players (The starport
technician can\'t do something like that for liability reasons...without a
suitabe bribe anyway).

As always, These things have to fit well with the plot.

   In all seriousness, both the Germans and Soviets had nuclear programs
prior to the Americans.  The Soviet effort had the plug pulled on it by
Stalin, who wanted to use the resources elsewhere.  The German effort
was hampered by Allied commando raids, lack of resources, and a bit of
hard luck.  Had things happened differently, it was not out of the
question that the Germans could have had the Bomb a year before the
Allies--I won\'t even go into what would have happened next....

   No knock on the people working on the Bomb for the Americans--they
went from third place to first starting with a bunch of theory in 1942
and finishing the project with low level mass production three years
later.  It\'s just that atomic weapons were a natural development as
Terra transitioned from TL 5 to TL 6.

   That\'s where ecological management would come in.  With a world
government, global management of the environment is no longer a
political football that is played with but never fully implemented. 
Besides, I think you may not be taking into account just how much more
power fusion produces.  While there would be proportionately more waste
heat, you need much smaller plants to produce the same amount of
energy--in fact, there may even be a *reduction* in the total amount of
waste heat versus hydrocarbon plants.

   Roof top gardens, simple changes in the color of roofing materials,
and greater population densities made possible by archologies would take
care of all that.

The main problem I have with this format is that it doesn\'t allow for
long world names.  This is solved in comma- or tab-delimited formats,
but they are of course harder for a person to read.  An example from the
net 1st Survey data (with single spaces replacing tabs for transmission
purposes):

ant 1006 Shiplishkair. E586000-5 Ba S 004  G9 VI

[Note the blank column before the stars, presumably for allegiance.]

The algorithm I came up with when reading files - which should be able
to cope with a variety of these formats - is:

1.  Try and get past comments and other material at the start, one line
    at a time:

    a.  If it\'s empty except for whitespace ignore it.
    b.  If it starts with #, $, @ ignore it (or attempt to parse it for
        (sub)sector name/trade route/personal code/etc).

2.  Try and recognise format (if this fails, ignore this line and go
    back to 1):

    a. Look for 4 digits in a row (hopefully this is the hex location).
    b. If this has a tab either side of it, take a guess that it\'s 1st
       Survey-style data; if it\'s at the start of the line but has a tab
       after it, guess it\'s like 1st Survey without sector codes.
    b. Otherwise, guess it\'s standard name/loc/uwp/base/etc format, but
       don\'t assume column widths.  Check location is not at the start
       and is followed by some sort of whitespace - hopefully a tab or n
       spaces (likely n=1).
    c. Check uwp field matches 7 alphanumerics (an\'s), \'-\', then another
       an; then (optionally) another \'-\' and four more an\'s for EE; then
       the delimiter.  If we guessed 1st Survey and this fails, try
       instead as name/loc/uwp/etc but tab-delimited.
    d. [Abbreviating to save typing]  Check Base has 0 or 1 chars; PBG 3
       digits; allegiance 0, 1 or 2 chars.  If space-delimited, note
       column position for each field.
    e. [NEW] Check "stars" field for valid stars or LRX data.  This is
       easy provided \'I\' and \'V\' aren\'t valid X codes.

3.  Assume all following lines match this pattern, unless they are empty
    or begin with a #.  Do whatever you want with this information...

I know this looks yucky, but it should handle the output from all
existing programs I know of - or rather, all the ones that produce text
files.

I think it should match the published material, and be tacked onto the
end of the UWP.  In the case of column-based formats, simply move all
later columns up five spaces.

This is a particular instance of the RNG query (below), combined with a
ruling on the exact rules followed...such as the Infrastructure /
Population Question.

Apart from good ol\' RNG, this poses the question of how you decide which
language to use?  Allegiance is often a good indicator, but not always.

Sysgen had quite a complicated way of modifying languages slightly based
on location, to (sort-of) generate dialects.

As far as basic mechanism goes, what\'s wrong with the Sysgen algorithm?
to get a (16-bit) random number with a 32-bit seed:

        seed = seed * 1103515245L + 12345L

and read the top 16 bits.

I haven\'t done any analysis of the results this produces, but even if
it\'s not good statistically something similar will do the job in all
those languages (assuming they can handle 32-bit arithmetic).

As for seeding it:  in sysgen this was based on the X & Y coords of the
world (eleven bits each), plus the Z-coord added to a magic number (ten
bits), coded as XXXXXXXXXXXYYYYYYYYYYYZZZZZZZZZZ.  This could thus cope
with just over 2000 * 2000 * 1000 systems.  For the "default" traveller
universe, you just need to decide on the co-ordinates of Reference and
you\'re away, adding the "local" x and y to the base; variants could be
given different z-coords.

Since sectors and subsectors have different needs to systems, you can
use the top-left hex of the (sub)sector as the location, assign a
different magic number, and you\'re away.

The problem, of course, when reading a .sec file (for instance) is
deciding what coords to assign to it.  I don\'t have an answer to that.

This is getting too long, and my lunchbreak should have been over quite
some time ago, so I\'ll leave it there for now.

first attempt with the revised process - and have a go using Glenn
Grant\'s life events at the same time.  I\'m going to follow the summary
chart exactly (but with optional extras), rather than use any
alternative rules (such as for allocating stats).  Unfortunately, I
didn\'t write down the actual dice rolls, so can\'t include them.

1.  Basic Characteristics:
    586939 (genetic 4635)
    Not what I would have chosen, but we\'ll see where it leads.

3.  Birthworld:
    HiTech (AB) - starport B, Na Ni Ast Va
    Looking in M0, I selected Erani (2501 B000699-B Na Ni Ast Va 100) as
    the only suitable world.  Because I like to flesh out worlds and it
    often sparks ideas, I then expanded this a bit - see separate post.

    At this point, I decided to roll for childhood life events:
     0-2:  [Parent] lose your position
     3-5:  [Parent] become celibate for a long period
     6-8:  [Parent] get into trouble with the law
     9-11: are caught up in political upheaval or revolution
     12:   start or end an affair
     13:   get pregnant, or get someone pregnant
     14:   move in together with someone, or move out
     15:   are affected by a new law or crackdown
     16:   a relative dies (and perhaps leaves an inheritance)
     17:   find yourself deeply in debt

    Oof!  A bit of a rough ride, there.  For some reason I now decided
    that I wanted the character to be female.

4.  Homeworld:
    Looking at the life events, I decided to keep her on her birthworld.

5.  Homeworld Skills:
    Craftsman-1, Navigation-2, Vac Suit-1

6.  Education:
    With that UPP, she\'s not ideally suited to any particular career, so
    I decided to try out the waiver rules to get her into university
    despite her low Edu (which I rationalise by saying her family
    problems meant she didn\'t concentrate at school).
    She is admitted, majoring in Linguistics.  Unfortunately, she
    doesn\'t persevere, and drops out after only one year - I decided she
    didn\'t concentrate, so roll on the table and get Art-1.  Life event:
     18:   encounter discrimination or intolerance [neat...]

    Determined to make something of herself, she successfully enrolls in
    NOTC.  She graduates with Admin-1 and Ship Tactics-1.  Life events:
     19:   have a major failure [what, another one?]
     20:   question your sexual lifestyle, role, or orientation

7.  Service:
    Automatic enrollment in Navy as O1.

    Term 1: Injured, End-3 (eek!), recovered fully (phew!).  No award.
    I decide to give her the nickname "Lucky"...
    Promoted to O2.  5 rolls, plus Ship Tactics - I don\'t know what she
    wants to do yet, so I roll once on each table except Physical,
    gaining Carousing, Communications, Cryptography, Pistol and Ship\'s
    Guns.  Life events:
     21:   try a new sport or recreational activity
     22:   become a volunteer for charity, development, or community
     23:   are caught up in political upheaval or revolution
     24:   encounter an important person from your past

    Term 2: *Just* continued.  Injured, Dex-1, recovered (heh, good
    nickname).  No award; no promotion.  Gravitics, Pistol, Recruiting,
    and Ship\'s Boat, plus Ship Tactics.  Life events:
     25:   become celibate for a long period
     26:   get a new job or assigment
     27:   try a new drug
     28:   change your home

    Term 3: Continued.  No injury; promoted O3.  Gravitics, Hunting,
    Instruction, Medical, Recruiting, plus Ship Tactics.  Life events:
     29:   become a victim of crime or conspiracy
     30:   perform a major rite of passage
     31:   are caught up in a feud or other factional conflict
     32:   are publicly accused of a crime

    Term 4:  Failed to continue (fits with those last life events!) -
    mustered out.  Cr50,000, +1 Int, +1 Edu, 10 High Passages.

10. Cold Sleep Weeks.
    Couldn\'t find the table!  Assume none.

11. Determine Birthdate.
    Assume for the sake of argument the (first) political upheaval was
    joining the new Imperium.  When does Erani join?  Birthday is 229.

I\'ll give a complete write-up (including my interpretation of her life
history) of the final character in a separate message, when I can fit in
typing it up.

This is one of the options I am considering.  It is a lot easier to do 
this when a .loc (location information) file is based on one star system 
(as in Galactic) rather than one file per Sector (as I currently propose). 
 The programming is not too difficult, but the file format starts to get 
more fussy and thus subject to error.

My current prefered choice is to have a file called, say, patrons.txt that 
contains a list of adventures and their locations.  Here are some example 
to explain what I mean:

SM1811="Across the Bright Face",<filename>,<map file>
Ag+HiPop="Harvest Run",<filename>,<map file>

In the first entry SM is the short code for Spinward Marches, and this is 
obviously CT Double Adventure 1 set on Dinom (Hex 1811 = Lanth 0201).  A 
little flag will pop up near the world to indicate "I know of an adventure 
set here", and the referee/user can then look at the list.  there may be 
only one enty, or there may be several (depending on how many entries in 
patrons.txt match the current location).  Usually the Referee will 
recognise the patron or adventure from the short name (in "" marks) and 
may decide that none are realy suitable at the moment.  Or he may say 
"excellent, I remember expanding that from 76 patrons".  He can then 
quickly look in the referenced <filename> to see if there are any rumours 
he can use to start laying the foundations of the adventure.

In the second entry, the referee had a bright idea about high value "first 
fruits" from the harvest of an Ag world.  As she fleshed out the adventure 
she realised that the world should have a HiPop to make things work.  The 
adventure did not fit in immediately, and not wanting to loose this in the 
future, she created a brief description of the adventure in a file and 
made an entry in patrons.txt.  When the players are on (or possibly just 
near) a Ag+HiPop world the referee is reminded of that bright idea from so 
long ago, and this time it fits in perfectly with some other part of the 
overall plot ...


This is one of the areas where I have not finished my thinking, as this 
concept can relatively easily be extended to assist PBEM referees and 
"solo" games, where the PC user can follow numerous adventures and 
sub-plots written by eager TMLers (those who have played the 
MegaTraveller computer games can probably see how a trading and 
astrogation program can become a solo RPG).  Although these features are 
very unlikely to be in the first version of my program, I like to plan 
ahead, as it often saves effort to leave various hooks in the code or data 
file to easily allow the feature to be added later.

    'body' => 'Hi folks,

I was having an email conversation with some gaming friends over the
weekend.  We were talking about the Mars Pathfinder mission and I mentioned
the National Space Society and the Space Studies Institute. "Are you
serious, or did you make them up?, one asked and from others I got the
email equivalent of a blank stare.  It surprised me that these intelligent
people, very interested in space, science, and science fiction had never
heard of these important organizations.

The following is off subject..a little..for this list, but just in case
some of you have never heard about NSS or SSI, I thought I\'d post short
blurbs about each.  

The National Space Society (http://www.nss.org) has a membership of over
25,000 worldwide.  It is an independent educational, grassroots nonprofit
organization dedicated to the creation of a spacefaring civilization. 
NSS\'s vision is people living and working in thriving communities beyond
Earth.  It\'s mission statement is, to promote change in social, technical,
economic, and political conditions to advance the day when people will live
and work in space.  Membership is $25 per year and includes a subscription
to _Ad Astra_, the leading magazine promoting space exploration.  Call
1-800-376-ORBIT or visit the internet homepage at www.nss.org or more
information.

My Opinion:  EVERYBODY interested in space should be a member of NSS. For
citizens of the United States, it\'s an absolute *must!  NSS is the
organization that represents *our* interests before Congress and has enough
standing to be who NASA calls on when they need "grassroots" efforts.  The
officers of NSS have been called before Congress to testify on behalf of
space development and science projects.  NSS has been the leading
organization providing grassroots political support to keep the space
station and Mars missions in the budget.  The latest efforts have been to
support for Lunar Exploration Mission and for the "Commercialization of
Space Act" before Congress.  Through their political action committee,
SpacePAC, they support candidates friendly to our goals, and "educate"
those who aren\'t.  I\'ve been a member since 1977, going all the way back to
one of the precursor organizations the L-5 Society.  I *heartily* recommend
them to anyone interested in expanding mankind\'s presence in space.

The Space Studies Institute is a non-profit, international, research and
educational organization founded in 1977.  It is dedicated to opening the
high frontier of space.  SSI was founded by Doctor Gerald O\'Neill, noted
Princeton physicist and author of _The High Frontier_.  SSI\'s goals include
using the material wealth and solar energy of space to improve the human
condition both of those who live on Earth and those who live in space, and
to expand the ecological range of humanity throughout the solar system and
ultimately, perhaps, throughout the galaxy.  To this end SSI has conducted
and is conducting pioneering research into advanced space propulsion, the
extraction and processing of nonterrestrial materials for engineering
purposes, and the identification and location of lunar and asteroidal
resources.  Since Dr O\'Neill\'s untimely death a couple of years ago, Dr
Freeman Dyson has become SSI\'s Board Chairman.  Membership is offered at
four levels: Corporate Membership, Senior Associate Membership (dues range
from $500 to 100 annually), Regular Membership (dues are $25 annually), and
Senior Citizen/Student Membership (dues are $15 annually).  If you are
interested in the future in space, contact SSI by letter, phone, FAX or
Email:

       Space Studies Institute 
       PO Box 82 
       Princeton, NJ 08542 
       Phone:  609-921-0377 
       FAX:    609-921-0389 
       Email:  ssi@ssi.org
           
My Opinion:  If you have read O\'Neill\'s _High Frontier_ then you know what
vision guides this organization, and if you haven\'t read _High Frontier_ go
get a copy TODAY!  SSI isn\'t a political or grassroots oriented group like
NSS, it\'s dedicated to research, research, research!  Examples of SSI
research over the years include building working mass drivers, lab-level
demonstrations of mineral extraction from lunar soils. conceptual studies
of solar sails, laser launch and propulsion systems, "beanstalks", "walking
sticks", solar power satellites, and mission concepts including the basis
for what became the successful Clementine Mission to the moon and the
proposed Lunar Prospector Mission.  My membership in SSI is my way of
directing a little money to the basic research that needs to be done in
order to develop the technologies that we need to live in space.  It isn\'t
glamorous, but it is important.

Do we have any other NSS or SSI members on the list that would care to
testify?

Star Trek timelines on the web than real-world ones - which reflects much
more the biases of web creators rather than failings of the search engines.
I\'m actually inclined to suspect that there isn\'t in fact a general history
timeline on the web (at least for free), although

http://www.hyperhistory.com/

has charts that come close (but low-resolution in time.)

There\'s a nice pre-1500 timeline at 
http://www.wsu.edu:8080/~dee/Directory.html

Anyway, my main point is that the apparent lack of what s.johnson was 
looking for is a failing of the web, not the search tools.

  Well, there is. If you look at the Volume Factor entries, there are 4
values for each hull config and size. These match the different materials. 
The increasing strength of the higher tech materials is \'factored\' (sorry 
couldn\'t resist) into the Volume Factor value.

  The one step left out is to multiply the armour USP by 10 to get the final 
value. This makes it a bit less costly.

Hans,

   I don\'t see any point in attempting to discuss a point where you are
complaining about a system you won\'t let me include for reference of the
discussion.  You can attack it--but you won\'t even accept its basic
precepts.  Seems your basic complaint is that you\'re version isn\'t what
is being published.  But then, that\'s always been the case for a lot of
us. :)

Willing to discuss on the facts, not one particular variant,

We could use a \'named\' storage method, one of the older ones, where each
field is preceed by a standard name: "name"=3D"zenopit";"hexloc"=3D"1010";=
 ...
This would be extracted by a parser routine and loaded as needed. Tabs would
not be mandatory; description would be embedded in data so that you could
tell what you have; local or private reader code could be built as
individuals desired. We could also use the older .DIF format where the
record descriptor preceeded the data in the files. I have to go digging in
my shed; somewhere is an ancient Visicalc manual with the sections on .DIF
and how it was organized. I think most spreadsheets, buried deeply in them,
can still read .DIF files.

What!?!  This is the first thing you\'ve posted that I don\'t like 
better than T4.... Being able to change careers was *awesome*. I 
loved my entertainer turned agent. She was able to use her 
entertainer career to cover her agent status.  Made for a great 
background for her. And I am currently playing a Naval character 
whose roots were in crime. She did a couple of terms as a Rogue 
before being scared straight...

There are some possibilities in the expanse of human existence this 
will limit. I can see, perhaps, not being able to switch between 
*military* careers, but between civilian careers? or from military to 
civilian? I\'d like to see those sorts of options be available to me 
as a player, and to  the players in my games.

Let me see if I got this correctly, before I decide to completely stop =
supporting IG and T4. Are you saying that in CharGen 4.1 characters can =
not change careers, that once they choose a career that they are stuck =
with it until mustering out and game play starts?

That would be me -- except it was intended to be the anthem for the
Imperial Interstellar Scout Service, rather than for the Imperium at
large.  I suppose you could dragoon it into wider usage, though.  :-)

I include below my original, completely untutored version of the anthem,
and then Tim Peter\'s excellent review of it in more formal terms.  I
haven\'t had time to integrate any of his suggestions or changes: some of
those listed are impossible, to my ear, using "Jupiter\'s" existing metrics.


SERVICE ANTHEM OF

THE IMPERIAL INTERSTELLAR SCOUT SERVICE

(Music by Gustav Holst, Terran, -2648 to -2588)

         And ever off so far,
         We shall bear Sylea\'s flame e\'er on
         Rekindle every star.

Terra\'s outskirts unto Vland,
We will bear Civ\'lization
To every being\'s hand.

Very common throughout musical literature for melodies to be borrowed from
older works.  Holst\'s music is both memorable (just ask John Williams, who
"borrows" freely from the Planets throughout the Star Wars score) and
singable.  A good choice, overall. (Unfortunately, I am remembering "Jupiter"
a tad unclearly, and I no longer possess a copy of "The Planets" to which I
can refer.  Oh well, that\'s never stopped me in the past).

So far, so good.  Each cadence (wan, on, far, star) has a good vowel sound on
which to sustain.  You should try to avoid ending lines on hard consonants,
or, even worse, schwa sounds.  A pox upon all lyricists who do not sing.

>  Fro-om Delphi unto Windhorn,
>  Terra\'s outskirts unto Vland,

>  To every being\'s hand.

Minor troubles here.  Horn, Vland/hand require very flat vowel sounds, which
are generally OK, though not preferred.  The \'shun of civilization uses the
abominable schwa, and places an unstressed syllable on the cadence.  A couple
of minor changes make it more singable.  You might try this instead,

Fro-om Windhorn on to Delphi,
To Terra and to Vland,
We will carry hope through the Night,
To every far off land.

This ends on more open vowel sounds, and is somewhat more singable.  I like
the reference to the Long Night, myself.  It also does away with unto
(another of those friggin\' schwas) but maintains the feel of your lyrics.

Race and face are fine; mother and other are unaccented syllables on cadences
and end on schwas again, and we all know how Timmy feels about them.  However
the lyrical motive is stirring, and rather effectively constructed.  Since
they are on weak cadences, and aren\'t high notes, which I believe is the
case, they can probably be left alone.  

Actually, not a bad first attempt.  There are many famous (i.e., dead)
"great" composers whose sense of prosody (the art and craft of marrying
lyrics to music) isn\'t as strong. (See "banner" in The Star-Spangled Banner,
where the second highest, and most heavily accented note of the song, is on a
goddamned schwa!)  BTW, there isn\'t a book written on this subject of which I
know, and these comments are purely my opinion, degrees and experience
notwithstanding.  Besides, nobody listens to the singers opinions, anyway.

Hope this helps.  I offer my input purely as a sounding board (hideous pun
intended).  You may use, or ignore, it as you see fit.

Chapter 15 "One Small Step" has a section on non-gravitic maneuver drives. 

They list ion drives and MPD (Magnetoplasmadynamic) drives.  I worked out
the ISPs and exhaust velocities for these drives and am wondering if I
made a mistake.  I had heard that this table in HT was actually fairly
accurate, but the figure I get for the exhaust velocity for the ion drives
listed here is 125,000 km/sec (0.4 C) and for MPD drives it\'s around
200,000 km/sec (0.67 C).  This is clearly silly for TL 7 and 8 drives. 
Did I make a mistake here?  If so, what are the correct figures? 

The relevant section of the table is:

TL Type   TT       Mass  Vol.  Fuel       Fuel Type    Pow Required 
7  Ion    0.05     15     15     0.0001   Ionizates     0.5 MW
8  MPD    0.2      10     10     0.005     Hydrogen     0.5 MW

TT= Total Thrust (1 ton of thrust = 9800 Newtons [ie it can support 1 ton
against 1 G]). 

Mass = Mass of the drive in Tons

Vol. = Volume of the drive in KiloLiters

Fuel = Fuel consumption in Kiloliters/hour

Hydrogen has a density of 0.07 Tons/KL
Ionizates have a density of 1.5 Tons/KL

Power Required = The power (in Megawatts) required to run the drive.

Me Too!

Being able to play a more rounded multi career character is quite
important to me.  Quite aside from any skill advantages that be gained
there is the background advantage to being an Ex-marine merchant.  I
would also tend to think that Nobles with experience in the Navy would
be very common.

These thoughts are good.  Many players have a varied background with
many career\'s in them especially on the TML(thats part of what makes the
TML such a dangerous place to post an uninformed opinion) and I think
that it\'s not particularly real to limit characters to one career of
experience - especially when rogues are able to cross careers with
impunity.

Take a look at Greg Porter\'s "Guns! Guns! Guns!" 3rd Edition (or 3G3).
IMHO, it uses slightly better rules for firearms design.  There are
also many examples to help clarify things, unlike FF&S.

> Accordingly, my questions are severalfold:

According to the T4 conversion rules in 3G3, RF consumes 21-50
rounds/second while VRF uses 51+ rounds/second.  Since T4 uses six
second combat turns, this translates into 121-300 rounds/turn for RF
and 300+ rounds/turn for VRF.

Note that this is based on a /sustained/ fire over the /entire/ turn.
The following quote is from 3G3: "If a weapon runs out of ammunition
during a six second combat turn, it is not reloaded to get a higher
rate of fire."  For example, an SMG with a capability of emptying its
30 round magazine in 2 seconds would have an effective ROF of 5
rounds/second, not 90 rounds/turn.

Again, according to Greg Porter\'s 3G3 T4 conversion rules, RF grants a
+2 DM and triples the damage done.  VRF grants a +4 DM and quadruples
damage.

3G3 and FF&S list receiver mass multipliers for different action types
(with the option of using a lighter receiver at the expense of
reliability in 3G3).

This one I can\'t answer, except to say that I believe I remember
seeing a rule that applied penalties to projectile weapons with a
Damage/Penitration rating in excess of 6.  3G3 makes a recommendation
that characters should use STR instead of DEX for high-recoil weapons.
I\'d add "whichever is _lower_" to that rule.

	Durn. I guess I\'m going to have to get a copy of that adventure... that\'s
actually the format I\'d dreamed up for a system generation program of my
own (which went nowhere).

	Other enhancements I\'d planned on using: different colors for the planets
to indicate atmosphere/hydrographics, indicating mainworld, circle size
scaled to planet size, orbital distance properly scaled, etc.

	Another thing that\'d be really cool, in a more detailed system
schematic--actual positions. Each planet could have its position in the
orbit specified at a given reference time, and then the program would
advance them according to the time the user/referee puts in. You\'d have the
ability to calculate travel time or comm lag between planets in their
actual positions, etc.

   Hear, hear Richard!! I too would like to see some other\'s slant on
the Milieu 0 Imperium. I feel that it\'s a bit more freewheeling than
later milieu\'s. In the T4 rule book it says that "There is no \'Prime
Directive\'." This leads me to believe that not only do civilians not
fear to interfere with likely "marks"  ..err markets, but the Imperium
itself would hesitate to seize a country, continent or world if they had
something that would benefit the Imperium!
Graft? Sure it\'s there and in spades. Scouts probably make a little cash
on the side by selling information to Corporations if they find a
likely  (exploitable) market. Then there will be privately funded
explorers, out scouting for markets and suppliers beyond the Imperial
boarders. I\'m sure they wouldn\'t be above "disappearing" rivals, There
being no \'law\' to stop them. Corporate Wars are a distinct possibility,
along with Corporate "Security" beyond the boarders shouldn\'t be
unknown, if only talked about in closed board rooms, within those
boarders, (a profitable, if dangerous time to be a mercenary).
Rivalry between wildcatters (independent exploration teams) and
Corporate sponsored explores has to be, literally, cut throat!
Humm, years ago they advertised Deep Space 9 as the "Grittier side of
the Star Trek universe", well that never really happened. But, maybe we
should be looking into the grittier side of the Traveller Universe.
Empires aren\'t formed by boy scouts, and if a few eggs have to get broke
to make that omelet, hand me the FGMP ..er, eggbeater!

I have heard some other (ancedotal) similar stories. I worked
as a co-op student at Bell Northern Research (BNR). The group 
I worked it was developing an automated test system for laser diodes.
Upper management decided one day that the BNR "Center of Excellence"
for this type of thing was to be located somewhere in England
(as opposed to its current location, Ottawa). No one in England 
could run the machinery and they couldn\'t even get skilled workers
to do it by hand, as there was no high-tech semiconductor manufacturing
in that part of England. I never figured out the rationale behind moving
everything. Anyways, moving technology is a lot harder than packing
up a bunch of machines and shipping them.

I agree. You might see recorded evidence of the TL-x Vacc suit (where
x = 13 or 14 or whatever), but that certainly doesn\'t help you build
one.

Well, my example of lost information on tapes wasn\'t meant to be a
killer argument-winning example, more like a semi-related example.
Like I said, the stuff on tapes is mostly data, like a decade\'s worth
of air pressure readings for Denver, not really useful information.
Knowledge of how to build high-tech equipment does not on magnetic
tapes reside - it\'s usually stored "upstairs" (taps head).

As has been said elsewhere in this thread, a lot of things never get
written down or never get written down and put in publically accessable
"information banks", like universities.

Hm... that\'s an intersting point. Infrastructure is an amazing thing,
in that it works both ways - it means you can bring stuff from all over
the place to your little ol\' world _and_ that stuff from your modes
tlittle 
ball of rock can be distributed all over the place in return...

For example, look at Intel. How many facilities do they have to
manufacture
Pentium chips? One, maybe two? Not many at any rate. Where do these
chips get distributed? Everywhere. Now, I\'m not sure whether you\'d
classify
Pentium chips (or Pentium Pro, Pentium II, whatever) as "mature"
technology, but my point is that even though you can find an Intel chip
in just about every country in the world, only an tiny number of 
manufacturing plants and R&D labs would have to disappear in order
to lose all knowledge of how to make those chips.

Perhaps we are arguing different points - I\'m saying that the RoM could
have had TL-13 (or maybe even higher in small spots) technology, but
that:

 - it was pretty new, appearing only briefly before the Long Night hit.
 - it was probably the first "production" models of new, formerly
    experimental technology.
 - said technology would have been manufactured in one location, or
    a few fairly close locations.
 - but in spite of these points, it could have been spread around
    quite a bit, enough so that you might find well-preserved samples
    later on, far away from their location of manufacture.

If you\'re saying that it\'s silly to think that any wide-spread, mature
technology could have been lost over the long night, I\'d agree. But have
a look - how many things that make the world go around these days would
you classify as "mature" versus "new" technology?

I agree. However, I think that this was spoiled long ago, by the
introduction of things like Cold Fusion/Fusion+, so that we have the
same
Air/Rafts in Year 0 as we have in 1100. I would have liked a Traveller 
universe that seems primitive by 1100 standards.

Well, Tl-13 (14, whatever) Vacc Suits do not TL-13 make. I suppose that
part of my argument is that it happened in isolated pockets of industry,
not across the board. Thus it was more easily lost.

Well... trade secrets persist in their own way. Why are all the US auto
manufacturers located in Detroit? Tradition? Why are all the
semiconductor
manufacturers on the west coast? Do they all like surfing that much?
It has to do with knowledge that accumulates in the people that live
and work in those industries. You lose those people and you\'ve lost a
lot
of knowledge, a lot of which isn\'t written down. If there was an
economic depression serious enough to make Intel close its doors,
it would be a looong time before you saw someone reach their level
of expertise again. That\'s the Long Night.

Hm, well, maybe we have a difference of opinion on what exactly the
Long Night was all about. I say it was a large-scale stoppage of
space travel and a total stoppage of space trade, except for small
pockets, which are what kept the TL of the Long Night period as
high as it was.

Information storage != knowledge. Putting a few German dictionaries,
Learn-To-
Speak-German tapes and a copy of "Heimat" into a time capsule will not
guarantee
good German speakers in the year 3000. Even more so for advanced
technical
disciplines which are a lot more abstract, like Vacc Suit engineering.

Hm, well, again, I just don\'t agree 100%. They\'ll probably have a lot of
the
same textbooks, yes, but as I think I said before, technology doesn\'t
just miraculously re-appear once you know about it. Vacc Suit textbooks
may
be missing seemingly insignifigant yet very important details on seam
manufacture. Also, there has to be an economic base ready to support
the industry. Our Vacc Suits are really bulky and ugly because if
there\'s
only 1 person wearing one (out of what, 8 billion?) at a time, it
doesn\'t
matter. If you know how to makea really advanced vacc suit, but one of
the key components is too expensive to manufacture because there isn\'t 
a mass market for it yet, then again, you\'re stuck. You can know
everything,
that doesn\'t make things cost effective to manufacture.

Part of what I\'m saying is that the Syleans never had technology that 
other people did have, thus never got a chance to preserve it. Not every 
planet in the universe is going to have a big university. "Everybody"
doesn\'t have to lose it either - sometimes all it takes is for one
person/
place/company to have the information and if they lose it, it\'s gone.
(No more Coke!)

Besides, during the RoM, knowledge travelled slowly. No Xboats, J-1 or 2
limit for non-military travel made for long waits for information. Like
some of the examples given of trouble transporting knowledge from one
place
to another, it would probably be easier to ship finished goods than the
information needed to make them.

Hm, well, the Vacc Suit example I keep harping on is a pretty narrow
one. What differentiates TL 12/13/14 vacc suits from one another?
According to the MT \'Imperial Encyclopedia\' (for lack of a better
reference), the basic suit drops from 2kg at TL 12 to 1 kg at TL 13
and 0.5kg at TL 14. TL 13 suits can be made self-sealing. TL 14 Vacc
Suits can be made \'tailored\', which is of little value, unless you have
to look good for a photo or something. In related technology, PLSS
durations increase while volume&weight decrease and at TL 14 heads-up
displays become available in the helmets. (Actually, the text says it
becomes
standard at TL 10, the table says TL 14. Yay MegaTraveller!)

There are certain technology niches, like vacc suits, where an otherwise
TL 12 society could produce, I think a TL 13 or TL 14 item, without
drawing on a "vast body of TL 13 knowledge". It would not be unlikely
that
these advanced items would be manufactured at a single location, as it
would likely be leading-edge knowledge in its field and not yet common,
widespread knowledge. Vacc suits also are not the kind of thing
typically
studied at university - jump drives and grav plates sure, but vacc suits
probably seem to "common" to merit study. For instance, I think that a 
lot of the knowledge and equipment that scuba divers use currently came
from Navy studies. The Navy is easily a TL ahead of the public in terms
of diving suit technology. Naval information is by no means (to my
knowledge)
public. If the Navy feels like it, they can bury the knowledge forever.

These are the sorts of items I\'m saying could exist - specialize items
which are useful enough in their niche to warrant someone spending a 
lot of time & trouble to advance, but not really so useful in a
widespread
manner that the knowledge couldn\'t be lost. (For a native english
speaker,
I have a lot of long sentences and double-negatives. Apologies)

OK Hans, I think I disagree with you because we\'re not arguing the same
point.
So, I agree with you. :) I\'m saying there could exist technology for
which
"_every_ world where it was once available" (ie. manufactured, not
imported)
was one, single world. And they _could_ lose it.

Having TL 13 items available != "reaching TL 13", depending on how you 
define it. If the Terrans had TL 13 vacc suits and TL 12 everything
else,
how would you label them? TL seems largely to be defined by what level
of Jump drive a culture has discovered - everything else is just
"noise".

   Assuming the situation has been brought under control by the time of
first contact (c. 2085), that still only means an increase in
temperature to about 13.5 degrees C, still not enough to melt the polar
ice caps (though the penguin populations in Antarctica will suffer
terribly).  That also assumes that there are no major technological
innovations during that time period that result in reductions in green
house gases and other contributors to global warming.  If Traveller is
correct, we get fusion power in 2010, and room temperature
superconductors about that same time (I\'d say a bit later, but...), thus
we know that such innovation does take place.

   There are already plans on the boards for vehicles that use
non-fusion technologies yet are virtually pollution free (at least the
kinds of gases that would contribute to global warming.  Given that the
Terrans probably don\'t have grav vehicles until TL 10 (much later in the
21st century), the typical four passenger vehicle in 2050 isn\'t a grav
one either.  Try designing a TL 9 battery powered or fuel cell powered
ground car and see what you come up with.

   Without question there will be ecological problems in the early to
mid-21st century that have to be dealt with because they aren\'t being
dealt with sufficently now.  We dump toxic waste on a regular basis
around the world in places it should not be.  There is a good chance
that another Chernobyl will take place.  Somebody needs to stop the
deforestation of the rain forests and it is not happening.  I won\'t even
address the Japanese rape of the Pacific Ocean, or the dozens of other
problems.  While global warming is a "maybe it will, then again it
probably won\'t" kind of thing, there are situations looming out there
that have a much higher probability of doing damage that could be just
as significant.

WHAT!?!?!?!?!?!

Why not?  In my school these days they tell us that in our lifetimes
we\'re liable to undergo several career changes, so why change this? 
Personally, I like the idea of career change.  

Especially true wit military careers (ie. Drafted) as the war you were
drafted for may be over, and now it\'s time to go back to civilian life.

Marc, I implore you to try and fit in career changes to T4.1

Thanks,

	Actually, it wasn\'t bad luck, even - just a misplaced decimal. The 
Germans took over the only factory in the world that produced 
deuterium (the Norwegian thing, a legend in the history of guerrilla 
warfare), but overestimated hundred-fold of how much nuclear material 
was needed for an atomic bomb. That is the main reason why they quit 
reseach and started designing other superweapons (and came up with 
some, like Me109s with an 80mm cannon. Try FFSing that and see what 
happens :) ).

Well, I\'m torn here. The part of me coding the program wishes I\'d
asked earlier as I\'ve almost got that part finished and working, but
I guess I won\'t have to repeat myself when Milieu 200(is that the
right one?) comes out and we get to be Vargr.

The part of me that plays doesn\'t like this much, as it seems to 
severely limit what characters do. I thought this was one of the 
good things that T4 chargen introduced. I don\'t think that the 
characters should be able to (usually) be able to switch between
military careers, or later reapply to the same career, but I think
that switching amongst the others should be OK, just a bit more
difficult. Running through that part of the program, I\'ve found 
most can have 2 careers, and 3 aren\'t uncommon.

Besides, what are all my half-Vargr Rogue/Scholar/Merchantmen
gonna do for a living? :)

the problems with the loss of data are that the data is spread out over
quite a distance, covered by 100\'s of separate indexes, and not well

Those lost TL12 sites have three fights:
        (1) Fight to retain knowledge (the easy one!)
        (2) Fight to retain infrastructure
        (3) Fight to retain maximum local sustainable TL

The archival problem is huge, but the easiest.

I work at a branch of the US National Archives (I\'m at the Anchorage Alaska
offices, 1 of 13 sites). The Archives does not use massive duplication of
knowledge; Nuke the main offices in DC & College Park MD, and *P*O*O*F*----
all the US patents, most of the records there, and all archived film/video
outside the smithsonian are gone... and the smithsonian will get hit,
too...

The other offices will have only regionally specific records, and copies of
the censuses and millitary records (on hard to retain microfilm rolls).

We use folder title indexes, without computer search capability.
We are text based. We can\'t even keep our E-mail working smoothly.
ANd this is a "State of the Art [TL 7.5] Archival Facility". The National
Archives and Records Administration\'s GRS-20 (Electronic Records) says to
Print them out, and store as paper.

Start to see the problems? By decentralization, sure, you never lose it
all; you may loose the key to understanding what is left, though....

The savings are huge especcially if we\'re going with chemical rocketry. The
naive thinking would be that not having to lug the fuel for the return trip
would mean half as much fuel but that is not the case - the savings are
much better.

No no, read my post: "ALL produced power will be waste heat eventually"
If the fusion reactors (who in the beginning will have really louzy
efficiencies) are 100% efficient the energy produced will still be ALL
converted to waste heat. Where do you think the powercompanies power end

Long world names, lack of extensibility (VERY important for just about any
referee), waste of diskspace (can be reduced with compression of course).
The main problem with it is WHY doing it the olf FORTRAN way today. Anybody
reading them will read them on a computer (in order to print them out etc)
and today even PC heads will use a proper word processor for that.

This isn\'t all that important to me as I will simply convert the data into
useable and be done with it but why use an old fashioned way with no real
advantages save that it has been proposed by MM and can thus be considered
canon ;)

If we imply that the Pentiums are mature (they\'re kinda hodgepodgy to me
but=8A) then if some astronomical event wiped out all Intel plants in the
world (hurray) then I bet it wouldn\'t be too hard for them to knock up a
new factory and start building them again, or Cyrix, AMD could take up the
slack. What I\'m saying is that any mature technology will be built by
several companies (there are other CPU manufacturers you know some are even
far better than the pentiums) and all these companies will store the
knowledge somewhere. Your analogy with earth today also falls down on the
fact that the reason Intel has few production plants on earth doesn\'t work
that well in interstellar space. The comm times and transport times would
make it rather impractical for SpaceIntel to work this way. If they come up
with PentiumXXVI (with an FPU that can actually access RAM) and the
transport times out to Tatooine-IV is a year its competitors (SpaceCyrix
etc) could set up a plant and sell their CPUs locally thus getting a 1 year
time to market advatage there.

All remarks in parenthesis are mostly swipes at PC heads etc and should be
considered as jokes despite them being true but totally lacking in humorous

I\'m currently involved in writing a Pocket Empires GM aid and I ran into this
problem fairly early on, as it was suggested to me that there are quite a few
formats in which the data is stored, so I wrote a ParseUPW routine that finds &
interprets the data. This is the way to go as its fairly easy to write special
case modules like ParseTabDelimetedUPW & ParseGal2dataUPW etc (oh BTW its
written as a C++ class UPW - that makes it nice & easy to change when I need
it do something else as well).

	::chuckle:: I will admit that after two hours of frustratingly
fruitless searching I wasn\'t above letting someone else find it for me! ;) But
I suspect what\'s happening here is two radically different POVs and experience
bases clashing here.

	I suspect many on this list, while being quite competent in using a
library, have never had to ORGANIZE or MAINTAIN one. ;) I have, I used my
example of a warehouse of books specifically because one summer I spent an
entire summer in exactly that situation.  Someone had bought, sight unseen,
about two dozen differing types of various Library collections and I had four
other people had to go through well over a quarter of a million books and try
and create order out of the chaos.  We still hadn\'t finished three months into
the project, we had managed to sort and catalog about 100,000 books out of the
mess.  I fact it took us the better part of the rest of the year to do it and
when we had to pack it for shipment to it\'s destination, a private school start
up.  We were tempted to kill the packers when they tried to ignore the way we\'d
set up the sequence of shipment.  Until you\'ve actually had to try and sort and
index raw data of any kind by hand, you\'ll just never understand.

	The real problem here is that I think all of you are expecting old data
to be neatly labelled and archived.  Rather like someone picked up your local
Library, building and all with the current layout intact, and then tucked it
away somewhere and left it undisturbed for a while.  Thus you expect to be able
to walk in, fire up the card catalog computers and just go find what you want.
It just doesn\'t work that way! :( Heaven knows Librarians wish and pray that it
did.  What actually happens is that the books, or data files, get scrambled up
and packed away.  The Indexes, the vital thing which make accessing INFORMATION
out of all those MOUNTAINS of RAW DATA possible get corrupted or lost.
	So when it it comes time to finally break open the boxes and start
reorganizing the book collection, or decompressing the Archives to access the
Data.  You\'ve got TONS of data and very little understanding of what\'s in all
of it.  Which means that someone who has a clue as to what it all means has to
go through all of it, book by book, data file by data file and start organizing
it all from scratch.  That is such an intensive and extensive proccess that you
would not believe what it takes unless you\'ve actually done it.
	And I\'m talking about doing it with physical books or massive lists of
data files.  Imagine how much worse this is going to get as the tech level goes
up and the ammount of raw data a society has rises exponentially.  Imagine
having to go through raw data byte by byte because it has to be recovered and
the file markers have been corrupted?  Even now the software tools we have are
inadequate to the task, and the size of the task increases daily. :\\

	This is why I can calmly state that the RoM could indeed have gotten to
TL 14 or even TL 15 on a a couple of worlds and even IF the Sylean University
system had the data files!  They might not ever realize what they had or be
able to use it.  There is a Reason why it\'s call Library SCIENCE these days.

He\'d need a little doggy vaccsuit :) and you could walk him on the hull.

I would imagine that the variety of human size and capacities (fitness
and life support wise) will make it easy to fit a little doggy on board.

By the way - make sure people are careful where they step (at least
until he\'s ship trained).

Don\'t forget that the higher you go the *fewer* block you need to move.
For the bottom layer you can move them in from almost any side. As you
go up you need the ramp and to haul them across the "work area" formed

We were *very* lucky. It seems that an early experiment by the Germans
was botched. The (wrong) result they got told them that nuclear bombs
weren\'t possible, but slower reactions such as powerplants might be.
Since that wasn\'t high on Hitler\'s list of items needed, they got lower
priority. Which meant that by the end of the war they hadn\'t quite
accumulated enough uranium to build a test reactor. Which is very good,
because the first test would have uncovered the error!

Ceres in our asteroid belt is 1000 km in diameter. Anything much bigger
is likely to either scatter the rest of the belt or attract it forming
a normal planet instead of a belt.

Grains of dust. :-)

Very. By the nature of the laws of orbital mechanics and other things,
asteroids tens to be *very* far apart. Like thousands of km.

> How many asteroids in a belt? 

Say a million or so that are big enough to be worthwhile (most of a km
across). Divide that by the area of the belt and you\'ll see why they
are so far apart.

Pretty much. Except in very special circumstances, you\'ll be lucky to
be able to see one asteroid from another.

What you need to look at is *energy*, not power (though power is a factor).
The *energy* involved in your 15,000 watts for 1.65e-9 seconds is about
25 *micro*joules. So the energy isn\'t a problem. It\'s the discharge
rate. I don\'t see any practical way for a lifeform based on carbon to
get that short a discharge rate.

What they use are a lot of semipermeable menbranes. Each develops a
potential difference of a fraction of a volt as biological processes
"pump" ions across them (using energy in the process). But since they
are "stacked" you get several hundred volts and enough current to stun
a horse.

Well, to start with, I think we need to expand the location info. 1010
is a hex, but it could have a lot of stuff in it. Here\'s what I\'m
working on:

xx--nnnn-a-b-c-d
xxy-nnnn-a-b-c-d
^ ^ ^    ^ ^ ^ ^
| | |    | | | |
| | |    | | | +-- 4th star or satellites thereof
| | |    | | +---- 3rd star or satellites thereof
| | |    | +---- secondary star or satellites thereof
| | |    +---- primary star or satellites thereof
| | +---- hex number
| +---- subsector
+---- sector

Subsector is optional, but if present indicates that hex number is
subsector based.

The coding for the stars/planets/moons is actually fairly simple:
xxy-nnnn-*	primary star
xxy-nnnn-0	object in orbit 0 of primary
xxy-nnnn-n	object in orbit n of primary
xxy-nnnn-2-*	secondary star (in orbit 2 of primary)
xxy-nnnn-8-1	moon of planet in orbit 8

I *think* that this or a variant of it can unambigously locate any body
in a system.

The two hard parts are that biological activities tend to produce low
frequency waves. So low that the wavelength is far too long to be sent
or received efficiently. To get wavelengths down to the size of (say) a
whale) you need frequencies in the megahertz, which are, shall we say,
"biologically infeasiable". 

Required power levels are a problem as well.

That was the group in "this old pryamid" and they did it in less than a
month. And they never intended to finish more than the two sides they
did.

The stones for the interior were quarried right next to the pryamids.
the quarries are there, complete with partially finishied stones. The
limestone facing was quarried across the river. And they\'d been working
stone for *centuries* before they built the pryamids, so it\'s not like
they had to learn from scratch how to shape stone or how to build things.

That "scorching desert" was *home*. It was also right next to the
breadbasket of the country. There was lots of food and water.

Actually, there was a PBS special on exactly how the pyramids were
made. "This Old Pyramid". They used only tools and techniques available
at the time the pryramids were built. And they but and finished two
sides of a 12-15 foot pyramid. Among other interesting details, they
discovered that wooden sledges over wetted wooden "ties" actually
*works* for moving large stones. It\'s not as easy as wheeled carts but
it\'s easy enough to be quite workable.

Not really. The rooms are partly *exacavated*from the pile of rocks. As
for lining things up, that take *elementary surveying, the sort of
thing the Egyptians had developed *long* before just to be able to
determine who owned which bit of land after the annual floods receded.

The Pyramids were quite a bit of work, but they weren\'t anywhere *near*
impossible at the existing tech level (TL 0?).

ps. I recommend watching "This Old Pyramid" as well as the more recent
programs where a Stonehenge style trilithon was transported and erected
and an obelisk quarried and erected. They give good insight into just
what those low TL societies could do to help (or hurt) your players.

Don\'t forget that a lot of storage media don\'t do well for long term
storage. Magnetic media fade and have bit spread (tapes also have
"print-through") So in even 50 years the media isn\'t readable even with
the correct reader. CD-ROMs are only as good as the bonding between the
plastic and the aliminum substrate. Microfilm and microfiche are better
as they are *designed* to last for 100+ years. 

But media do have to be stored properly. And the cryptography project
is a lot harder than you think. It\'s not *possible* to recover an
unknown text in an unknown encoding. You have to know *something* about
the encoding, the contents or both.

Where it is *delivered* doesn\'t matter. What matters is how big the
group that knows the "technique" is. If they all die, it\'s gone until
re-invented.

Probably *most* of the trade secrets of 50 years ago are still secret.
If someone else figured it out, they may have set up in competition
with the original company. Otherwise, the company keeps on producing
the material via the secret process, and nobody outside is the wiser.
Heck, the CocaCola formula is *still* secret after close to 100 years.

As for trade secrets that affect TL strongly, the "details" I mentioned
that get left out of textbook accounts of semiconductor manufacturing
*do* affect our current TL. And the companies aren\'t exactly spreading
the knowledge around.

Depends on the storage media *and* on the indexing method. Check out
what sort of topics the Dewey Decimal system files next to each other.
Then compare the Library of Congress indexing. Now look at more modern
"hypertext" type indexing. How to "structure" storage is one of the big
unsolved questions of library science.

Now consider that a lot of storage will be filled "linearly" (things
like periodicals) and you\'ll have to find and understand the indexing
to get the data you want.

Heck, the whole reason for progress being so in the Imperium may simply
be that it takes forever to jutapose the disparate pieces of data
required for a breakthrough. It might have been possible long before,
but nobody had all the pieces...

This requires high level AI. The computers would have to be able to
*understand* the books. Keyword analysis won\'t get you very far. And
the terminology may have changed. Computers can *assist* the humans who
will have to read all this, but they can\'t substitute for them.

See my comments about Dewey Decimal vs Library of Congress as different
methods of organizing knowledge. Different *cultures* are likely to
have different ideas as to what areas knowledge breaks down into, and
how they relate to each other.

How do you tell the difference between "real" data and articles that
were written as a joke? Consider some of the stuff that appears in the
April issues of a lot of technical and even scientific magazines. 

You have to check out anything that is beyond your current tech level.
And that takes time, as you have to dig out the data on how to
build/run the equipment. Which, likely *isn\'t* indexed into the same
section of the database.

No, they can do the same thing they do in foreign countries. They can
ship in the syrup. Or they can build a sealed module with a
"self-destruct" to mix up the syrup. Chemical companies go that far
currently!

Don\'t confuse spread of TL X *goods* with spread of the knowhow
required to build the critical components.

My players a Vargr with his Anola family and a human with her Seedspitter

	Marc: count me in as being for career changes.  Personally, whether
or not you actually implement the "no career change rule" in T4.1, I\'m
still going to allow characters to change careers.  People can change
careers.  I\'ve done it.  Letting characters change careers can add depth
and flavour to them.  Saying they can\'t is going to damage T4.1\'s
credibility.  I think that that would be the same sort of pointless,
artificial, constricting rule that really turned me off D&D years ago.

	The slant I\'m trying to give the M0 3I in my current campaign
(expect a game summary Friday AM, people) is somewhat akin to the Victorian
colonial period.  Greed and power are prime motivators; youngest sons,
fortune seekers, those who straddle the line between entrepreneur and
criminal, and the occasional decent bloke are all out there on the frontier
trying to strike it rich.  Out on the fringes human life doesn\'t quite
count for as much as it does back on Sylea (where it doesn\'t count for as
much as it does here).  The Megacorps are large and ruthless and
exploitative, and Famille Spofualm Armaments are doing great business.  The
ideology of "Empire" and the political entity nourishing it have such great
momentum that very few of its subscribers stop to question the many abuses
that occur.  Stuffy, unquestioning, jingoistic, greedy, self-righteous
conviction of rightness is the general moral tone.

	Imperial administrators tend to be decent, honest, and loyal to the
Imperium and by Imperial standards, which doesn\'t mean that they would
hesitate a second to ruthlessly crush anything that stands in their way.
The Scouts tend to be decent types, and try and minimize the effect of
getting overrun by a hegemonical steamroller on contacted cultures, but
they\'re still not Margaret Mead.

	So basically, M0 in my campaign is not a nice time in a rather
Victorian (in the political and economic sense), stuffy, sometimes quite
violent, and self-righteous way.  It\'ll eventually develop into a society
that is much more harmonious, once much of the dissent and diversity has
been eradicated, but in the meantime it\'s a situation where an economic and
military powerhouse is busily expanding and absorbing everything in its
path.

	I think that when it encounters the Hierate in M200 might be a
mellowing psychological cusp for the 3I; after that little shock they might
begin to realize that they\'re not the only game in town...

The big problem is that you know that it can be done. You don\'t need to
know how to do it in order to speedily duplicate some science feat. The 3I
guys shure knew a lot about what the RoM was capable of and thus if they
needed they could crash research the subject given that they more or less
know where to look and what to avoid. The truly hard part of science is
trying something that really shouldn\'t be possible - this is why so many
new discoveries are made by coincidence or unintentionally: One example
that comes to mind is the Michelsen Morley experiments to measure the
ether. The failure of their experiment which was totally perplexing for
scientists at the time forced them to either abandon the ether theories or
coming up with some serious fudges that made the ether fool the M & M
measurement apparatus (the fudge formulae BTW looked exactly like the
special relativity ones).

What I long windedly am saying is that it\'s pretty easy to regain lost TL
if you know that it was possible and hopefully nobody is saying that all
knowledge at Sylea University as to what was possible for RoM was lost as
well. If that is supposedly the case then they also have to restart
evolution to regain their lost brains ;)

The problem is rather that we disagree with just what is the basic precepts.

I presented an argument that a particular concatenation of facts is 
inconsistent. You counter with another, analogous, set of facts. But what
good is that when the second set of facts is also inconsistent? Wouldn\'t it
be more to the point to prove to me that I\'m wrong and that the original
set of facts are not, in fact, inconsistent? That is, if you think you can.

Let me give you an analogy. Say I was claiming that a particular planet
couldn\'t be in orbit so-and-so around this sun because it is described as
Earth-like, yet the planet would have daytime temperatures above the boiling
point of water. Would you then consider it a good counter-argument to point
out that according to canonical sources Darrian also have daytime temperatures
above the boiling point of water? (Yes, it\'s true. According to _Darrians_
and _Grand Survey_ taken together, Darrian has a basic temperature of 90 
degrees Celcius! (Unless I\'ve miscalculated three times) I just noticed that 
a few days ago...)
 
>Seems your basic complaint is that your version isn\'t what is being 
>published. 

In a sense that is true. But as you point out, in that sense it is true of 
all of us.

>Willing to discuss on the facts, not one particular variant,

If it was only one particular variant the problems would be much less. If
all we had was T4 then there would be no problems. Sylea\'s TL of 12 is
perfectly consistent with having TL 13 and 14 planets dotting Charted 
Space and with RoM reaching TL 15 or 16. The problem comes when we add
all the rest of the tidbits we know from other versions of Traveller. In
particular the fact that the Imperium dosen\'t reach TL 13 till Year 300
and the fact that in 1100 "everybody knows" that RoM didn\'t reach more
than TL 12.

I\'ve expanded the CT system into something more detailed.  Every world has
trade tables listing common exports, which are related to resources (using
WBH).  MegaTraveller tasks govern how players search for trade goods. 
Guidelines for using and creating the tables are given.

I\'d give at least one regiment Scots traditions.

Back when I was running a CT game and Azhanti High Lightning had just been

better than guns against armour (check the game rules if you don\'t believe

Ah, David, don\'t you wish you had a Mac?  :-)

Metator does almost all of that (everything except the travel times and com
lag, which is such a good idea I\'ll be including it shortly).  My schematic
has orbits down the left side of the page, with satellites branching out to
the right.  My system map shows actual orbit position.  Both use colour icons
for the worlds, with general world type (earth-like, mars-like, moon-like,
gas giant...) shown by icon, and different sized indicated by scaling the
icons.  Asteroid belts have their major settlements shown as a space habitat
(which also moves with time).

Knee jerk american patriotism response?
What Robert Flammang wrote was that ACCORDING to PE wealth is measured in
the amount of RU\'s produced. As GNP is a pretty crappy measurement of
economies which is good mainly for taxational reasons. What GNP measures is
the amount of monetary transactions taking place thus the amount of
taxeable money there is. All transactions taking place inside the state (ie
transfers from one part of the government to another) are disallowed in GNP
calculations because a government could in principle move any amount of
cash inside itself without cost and thus a noncapitalist country could
choose to produce an arbitrarily large GNP.

Why couldn\'t China build large aircraft carriers? Lack of TL perhaps but
I\'d say lack of will and the same goes for projecting their force anywhere
on the globe. I\'m not shure as to wether Chinas economy is larger than US
but I\'d certainly think so. The Chinese can probably field more infantry,
armour and aircraft than the US but would probably get clobbered because
the US military stuff was BETTER ie higher TL.

As Chinas population is so  much bigger than US they have to pay
considerably more to upkeep their infrastructure (in the real world that is
- - in PE they\'d have to pay IS in proportion to their land area or
something) and thus they have less left for research etc but this is also a
choice in preferences.

OK, again...

The RoM didn\'t have to reach TL 14 to have some TL 14 items
available. Or TL 13, or whatever. The major factor in determining
TL rating seems to be Jump drive. Just like Jump drive separates
the major races from the minor races. If you\'ve got Jump-3, you\'re
TL 12, regardless of what kind of vacc suits, walkie-talkies
and plastic wrap you produce. This effect is less noticeable as
you start moving to smaller and smaller scales, but for entire
empires in a historical context, TL is probably not that descriptive.

Well, we can chalk it up to social reasons: while they\'re excellent
innovators, the Solomani can\'t run an interstellar empire like the
Vilani can. TL 15 is accomplished as much by shipping parts on time as
it is by inventing new cool stuff. Besides, there\'s probably a lot
of "party politics" in Solomani space that ends up dragging them
down, as opposed to the very top-down, do-it-my-way-and-don\'t-screw-
around Vilani power structure.

All, "it could be", IMO, of course.

it\'s not actually completely silly for the ion drive; the whole point of ion
drives is that they accelerate extremely low-mass fuels to extremely high
velocities, with an electric field rather than by heating the fuel. 
125,000km/s does seem high, but only by a factor of 2 or so...
I\'m not sure quite what an MPD is, so I can\'t comment on that.

I do remember that the ion drive fuel consumption in FFS seemed pretty reasonable.

 know what you think.]


Erani         2501 B000699-B-2587    Ast Na Ni Va       100

History:
    Erani was colonised during the Ziru Sirka primarily because of it\'s
    metal-rich asteroids, and prospered.  By the time of the Nth
    Interstellar War the easily-extractible metal stocks were beginning
    to run low, but the war effort kept profits high.  Reconstruction
    work meant that this continued into the early years of the Rule of
    Man, but the effect gradually faded and Erani entered a severe
    economic decline.  Imaginative (for Vilani) initiatives by
    government and corporations masked the extent of the problem, but by
    -1850 the truth was self-evident.  The more keen-sighted also saw
    the problems of interstellar society in general, and the effect it
    would have on Erani; the government collapsed.

    The next thousand years was, at least from a Vilani viewpoint, a
    time of anarchy and chaos.  Different factions with conflicting
    ideas of how to restore prosperity fought for control with each
    other.  Tragedies happened; whole communities died because vital
    equipment wasn\'t being maintained.

    The first of the large communities to return to stable government
    was Khamma.  By -900 the Khammans had adopted a bureaucratic
    government structure not so distant from their Vilani roots.  Their
    example gradually spread this government across the belt, and within
    150 years all the major communities were unified.

    Even during the Chaos Time, Erani had been involved in limited trade
    with it\'s neighbours Arunde and Derku, 3 parsecs distant.  These had
    formed a coalition for the purposes of trade and colonisation, and
    in -688, Erani was invited to join.  The increased trade and support
    helped Erani out of the doldrums, and it had become a prosperous
    member of the coalition by the time it was absorbed into the Third
    Imperium.

    The vast majority of Erani\'s population live in clusters of orbital
    habitats centred on the largest asteroids in the belt, or in tunnels
    and chambers within those bodies.  Possession of the only B-class
    starport helps Khamma maintain it\'s historical preeminence, but
    Idarmi is a strong challenger; the friendly rivalry between
    communities is frowned on by the Guides, but stimulates local
    development.  There is also an intra-community division between the
    "Uppers" in the space habitats and the "Downers" within the asteroid
    bodies; this is mostly evident in the jokes they tell.

Unusual Customs:
    On their first (local) birthday, every citizen is tattooed at the
    base of the spine with a "bar code" detailing their name, citizen
    number, birthplace, parents and other information.  Until their
    eighth birthday they are not allowed to speak with offworlders, a
    custom that has built up a mystique around people from other
    systems.  To mark this change, a second tattoo is added above the
    first.

Government:         9 (Impersonal Bureaucracy)
    Government is completely undifferentiated; all aspects are run by
    councils of "Guides", initially appointed based on expertise in a
    wide variety of fields, but once on a council present for life.
    Guides are effectively a class above normal citizens, receiving many
    benefits available only to them.  This includes free education for
    them and their children, which means that about 75% of new Guides
    come from "Guide families".  Nevertheless, the Guides have so far
    governed well.  Discontent is limited, and mostly directed at the
    "life membership" aspect of Guidehood rather than the general form
    of government.
    [Note: Erani had developed into a Feudal Technocracy by 1100.]

Law:                9-7EBBA, undivided.
    Due primarily to caution on the part of the Guides, laws are fairly
    extreme across the board, especially trade laws.  However, because
    of necessary compromise as the Guide system spread across the belt,
    personal weapons are much less restricted.

Technology:         BA-BBBBC-CCCB-BC
    Erani enjoys a fairly uniform TL B, but because of the need to
    survive a harsh environment alone their environmental TL has been
    pushed to C.  Personal grav belts are available for Guides, though
    not for normal citizens.  Experimental TL C heavy weapons are being
    produced in small numbers for testing, but are not yet generally
    available to the military forces.

2) It _is_ a good game mechanic, but rather than penalize humans let\'s give

	About mines: Remember that detonation laser warheads are _deadly_
out to 10Kkm or more, and that\'s just for the smaller ones: Take a
1Mt detonation laser, add a 3Kkm PEMS array and a simple computer
and you have a cute little mine that\'ll kill or cripple just about
anything but a capital ship. Shouldn\'t be too expensive, even;
pirates might be able to jury-rig some from looted warheads.

	As for seeing asteroids from another... IMO, starships have windows 
because of tradition. TL 12+ sensors might be a wee bit more accurate 
than human eyes.

You are just the sort of person I\'m trying to agree "standards" with.  
Rather than roll some random numbers and convert them into PE data, I 
think it would be great if there was a TML-standard way of generating PE 
data from the UWP so that my PE data was the same as your PE data.

As you have not finished the program, surely you and I (at the very least) 
could agree a method to use ... it may become a de facto standard!

Writing a smart parser is possible, as is having a number of import 
filters (as used in Word, Excel etc for file formats from competing 
products).  It is even possible (by use of dll\'s) to add additional 
import filters to the program without changing the main executable.

To make these filters work well there needs to be an easy way to 
identify the format quickly:
file extension: .gni, .sec, .gal, .MM, whatever)
first line of file: Galactic2.2, TrTools, Metator, whatever

This method should indeed allow unambiguous location, but I want to 
avoid having huge great data files that store all of the information 
about a system, and instead have a consistent method of generating all of 
this data from a "standard" UWP file.  Making things internally 
consistent within my own program is no problem, but it would be nice to 
spread the consistency to include other programs that generate the same 
data.

That feature was in my original message - always been a hobby-horse of mine. 
 As you say, this will allow you to calculate travel times com lags and so 
on (part of my paper-based feature list).

One option I am toying with is including residual velocity from the start of 
a jump to the end - consider the simplified case of jumping from earth to 
Mars when the two planets are on (nearly) opposite sides of the sun.  The 
difference in orbital velocity would be large, requiring a few more g-turns 
to sort out.  If I ever sort out my understanding of the Orbital Mechanics 
textbook i have, i\'ll include refuelling at gas giants, "sling shots" and 
other neat stuff.  The program will essentially calculate a series of 
orbital manoeuvres and list minimum time, minimum reaction mass and so on 
(I\'m not a fan of Thruster Plates).  Normally these will be completely 
irrelivant, until a mishap occurs ....

I\'m only planning to include it because
(a) I love math and this sort of calculation
(b) it is my program :-)

I don\'t think space is a problem, I knew a guy who used to keep his dog in
his car, went out during break and lunch to play with him.  Also, there
are many, many people who keep animals in apartments that would not have
much more space than a medium sized starship.

The lifesupport costs tho...

Canon does not differentiate on size for lifesupport.  If you are talking
about modules being plugged in to support x number of beings for one jump,
then the cost would be the same...the partially used module would be
pulled and replaced with a new one.  (I know a GM who used that to explain
the fixed cost per week for life support)

I tend to be more forgiving, if the players want to keep track of the
costs that closely, I\'m willing to fluctuate to prices to reflect usage.
I think the dog would tend to use less, how much less will depend on the
size and disposition of the animal.  (50% to 75%)

If you were looking for the more "Empire Strikes Back" feel to your belt
perhaps your mined "rocks" could be in the planetary ring of a large gas
giant.  I\'m no expert on this but IIRC the material is much denser nin a
ring (however also quite a bit smaller).  So to the experts out there
are ring materials baseball sized? smaller?  Can chunks of rock (or ice)
be of the order of tens of meters?  If tens of meters is possible some
of the "mining" methods mentioned might work.  Is ring material so
densly packed that maneuver though it is impossible?  Are rocks of
hundreds of meters possible?  IF tens to hundreds are possible and
manuever is possible, your base could be on one of the larger rocks.

Again, I am speaking about an area of which I am ignorant--but I thought
I would put out the ideas anyway for what they are worth (most likely
nothing).

If any of this is possible it might however be closer to the
navigational mayhem effect that (at least as I understood it) you were
originally looking for.  Of coarse the idea of having to cover vast
distances to get to the next mine to disable it while its shooting at
you has its merits...especially if you make the wholesale destruction of
the mine more damaging on average than taking a few hits and disabling
it (perhaps blowing up a particularly nasty power source from long range
is not the BEST idea)

anyway, I think I\'m just rambling now....Tom be shutting up now.

As a grad student working to "get that one piece of reproducable data"

Well, I hope this one doesn\'t devolve into a flame war.  However, when I
saw the original statement about China and India GNP compared to the US, I
was forced to laugh, remembering a threat-potential seminar I participated
in back in my Army days.  Specifically, this was a sort of global wargame
used for training purposes (no cool classified stuff here!), which involved
a fictional set of countries in Europe and Asia, who closely resembled some
real-world (1988 real world) counterparts.  At the end of the session, the
officers ruling "Sind" (China) and "Hind" (India) complained that even with
their massive populations, they could not accomplish anything in terms of
R&D or creating large field armies.  The instructor listened politely, and
assigned both of the guys a couple of nasty reading assignments, with the
goal of answering their own questions.  The answer they presented to the
class the next week was that both countries had great potential with their
huge populations, but were unable to use that potential because of a lack
of infrastructure.  Their report noted that both nations actually had a
good amount of cash that could be used for infrastructure development, but
the size of each nation\'s population meant that the cost of moving either
nation to a 1960 US/Western Europe infrastructure would be several orders
of magnitude greater than the available cash.  The nations could (and are)
build infrastructure incrementally, but doing so in an incremental manner
would lose the synergistic benefits of the overall infrastructure increase
which the US and Europe received throughout the 19th century, and which was
renewed after WWII.

Since I was just a poor soldier with little macroeconomic understanding, it
took a while for this to sink in.  What I finally determined was that it is
easier to build infrastructure and population simultaneously, and harder to
build infrastructure after the population is already there, because you
have to pay for the infrastructure AND pay for the population.  So poor
"Sind" could not connect every town of 20,000 or more people with 4-lane
concrete highways in ten years, or wire and plumb 80% of the nation\'s
houses in 20 years, feats which the US and Western Europe were more able to
accomplish.  And without this basic infrastructure, it was far far more
difficult to build up the higher levels of infrastructure (the factories,
schools, hospitals, etc).  Not impossible, just harder.  The citizenry of
"Sind" are no smarter or dumber, they are just restricted by economic
reality.  In addition, the infrastructure also had a similar effect on the
GNP; less infrastructure meant that economic activity was more often
localized nad low-level, hence produced little tax revenue compared to an
interstate or international transaction.  The "hewers of wood" comment is
true in that regard; not as much value add for the economy, but still
necessary work.

That is the one big weak point about the PE economic rules, or trying to
use raw GNP numbers to determine technological or military ability.  I
suspect China could build those 13 carriers, but they would be more like
1950s carriers than 1980s carriers, and doing so would put a halt to the
Chinese merchant marine program, and probably put a halt to any
infrastructure projects requiring elaborate electronics or even advanced
metals.  Deploying this fleet would probably require major cutbacks in
civilian oil use, unless the ships were coal-fired (which is not out of the
question for a coastal force, but not too good for a global
force-projection fleet).   China has a large army, largely non-mechanized.
Mechanizing this army to US levels would not be something China could
accomplish in a reasonable amount of time without crippling their national
economy.  I\'m not talking Reagan-era deficits; I mean literally shutting
down all manufacturing tool production, or building of new farm machinery.

Infrastructure acts as a "Force Multiplier", just like artillery, armor or
air support acts as a force multiplier for infantry.  You can do a lot of
work with 10000 infantry, but you can accomplish an order of magnitude more
if that infantry has some artillery.  In PE, this gets masked by the IS
support costs being based on world size instead of population size, I
suppose.  Even so, I\'ve been having a lot of fun using PE solo, as
background info for a future campaign.

I wish I still had those reports; they were pretty interesting.  However,
the seminar was given by a private contractor, so all materials were
returned to them.

The functions are:

I have been manipulating scads of FS and M:1100 sector data, for nefarious

I usually convert them to tab delimited as quickly as possible.  It makes
it easier to read into a database program, and it makes it much easier to
read in data from random files.  My current mapping program is much more
reliable with tabs, at least.

>Apart from computer-purist reasons, why do you object to fixed position

Different people have different fixed position files.  I have a big stack
of sector data files on my drive, some of which use 15 characters for the
name, some of which use 14, and so on.

Clearly, this is just as much of a problem as getting fields out of order,
but it seems to be a more common error to have a longer planet name than
the fixed width field will take than to have a field misplaced.

I find them about the same difficulty to edit, as far as that goes.  YMMV.

In my M0 campaign, the primary guiding principle is individual drive.  It
is expected that there is a lot of good stuff out there, and if people work
their tails off, they can get some of it.  In a rather bizarre way, they
have a very meritocratic aristocracy.  On the other hand, many of the
systems and institutions have not yet worked out their exact function.

By 1100, nobles were nobles, and commoners were commoners, yet very few
people were considered truly inferior, just not noble.  While it was
possible that a nobody could become a noble, and likewise, a noble could be
stripped of power and wealth and become a nobody, these were both unlikely.
 The nobles that "ran things" were a year from the borders, and were career
politicians, while the megacorps were the economic powerhouses closely
entwined with the nobles.

In Y0, on the other hand, promotion to the nobility was fairly common, and
often for bizarre reasons.  At the least, though, those who were nobles
were considered doers, not talkers.  Imperials were fairly status
conscious, because many of them aspired to that status, yet they considered
their least to be better than anyone outside the Imperium.

My quick list of differences:

1.  Nobility has been created.  As a rough guideline, over the long haul,
approximately one person in a thousand is in some way noble and wields some
kind of direct power.  Perhaps ten times that many would have some kind of
relationship to a noble title such that they get honors at parties, but
would not be "important." themselves.  This puts even the poorest noble or
intendant at something like ten times the average income, or better, which
seems to be needed, given the basic setup of the game.

FWIW, I give people a social standing of one less than their parents until
the death of a parent, and the passage of the title.  Thus, siblings of a
current, aging, noble become very interested in whether the title will pass
to them, or to the children of the one dying.  Further, nobles and nobility
are a strata of society that are well known to the average person, and they
have even met a number of them, but it is till quite a momentous occasion,
positive or negative, to meet a real one in the flesh.

This has one final corollary - Sylea will eventually have some 30 million
holders of noble titles, which will mostly be knighthoods.  Of those,
perhaps a million of them will be recognized personally by the Emperor,
while the rest will be recognized either by the grand master of the order
of knighthood, or as an associated family title.  The Emperor desperately
wants to have all of the movers and shakers personally bound to him, and is
doing his best to recognize everyone he can that seems to be important.  As
a result, this is a society that is turning quite status conscious, but the
people where this manifests the strongest, the nobles, are not an everyday
group.

2.  The Imperium has started to expand at an insane rate.  The way I see
things, a world can really only dominate a few worlds near it without the
influence of Naval bases.  I also feel that it takes at least a few decades
to absorb a world that is anywhere near your own in population or
technology.  As a result, Sylea has taken on the policy of treading lightly
near anything that is near Sylean power, but quite freely grabbing anything
lesser which is not nailed down.  Anyone who helps this process along is
idolized.

2a.  To encourage this, they have a rather strange kind of doublethink.  A
world which is not a member world is inherently inferior to an Imperial
world.  You will likely never get knighted for discovering and
administering a world outside the borders.  On the other hand, you have a
pretty free reign, and can make a lot of cash.  The Scout service is quite
busy making the initial surveys for worlds like this, which is why few
Scouts get knighted.  Many merchants are making the money on worlds like
this that will support them when they do get knighted.

2b.  Bringing a world, even an uninhabited dust ball, into the Imperium is
a matter of great import.  This will make a career or a fortune.  The
Imperial Foreign Office is nominally in charge of all such contacts, yet
they are stretched so thin that they are willing to ignore a lot if the
world is en route to membership.  Note that they do have a move it or lose
it policy - if you are in the process of negotiating a request for
admission, and the Foreign Office takes a dislike to you, you may well find
your claim supplanted by another group on the same world.

2c.  Once a world is in the Imperium, it becomes the responsibility of the
people who brought it in and the ruling powers, as recognized by the
Imperium, to keep everything on it under control.  On the other hand, while
you have lost many of the options you had when it was outside the borders,
you have greater resources to call upon, like much better trade provisions.
 This is where much of the future power of the Megacorporations comes from
- - they can administer almost anything with their personal resources, and
thus do not bother the Imperium often.

3.  Unlike 1100, internal competition is not considered a good thing if it
interferes with Imperial progress.  While there can still be the cutthroat
and often violent disagreements that take place in 1100, they will almost
all take place beyond the Imperial borders.

It is a lot easier to have accomplishments recognized when one is first
coming into the Imperium, rather than later.  Worlds, therefore, spend a
fair amount of time as a friendly state outside the borders before asking
admission.  It is during this time, when the world is in essentially its
final form, but before it has the full protection of the Imperial Navy,
that military/mercenary actions common in 1100 can take place.

4a.  Honor is becoming more important, as Cleon feels that is the only
thing that can keep him on his throne.  The Code Duello is back, but they
have not yet worked out all of the details.  In general, this will die out
by the time 1100 rolls around, but it is quite strong in year 0.

4b.  The word of a Noble is considered good, and the clear intent of Sylean
law is that if a noble promised it, but the lawyers did not put it in the
contract, then the lawyers lose.  Non nobles are not expected to keep to
this standard, and the nobility is allowed to take that into account.
While they are not yet completely callous about human life, nobles do have
more ability to avoid bad consequences.

5a.  Hand craftsmanship is a big thing.  The economic reason is simple -
Zhunastu wants to be able to make a profit off of all of the TL1-TLA
planets they are contacting and bringing in.  As a result, they have made
all sorts of ad campaigns designed to convince Y0 citizens that they want
hand rubbed oak in their grav car, and burl knobs on laser controls.

5b.  It is considered a good thing to have find native handicrafts adorning
your possessions, and to have human servants from other planets doing
things for you.  In many cases, a robot would be better at it, but robots
are limited to doing various manufacturing tasks.

6.  It is an era where everything is in flux, thus the megacorporations
that control Sylea so thoroughly are not going to be a big factor outside
the borders.  They are ruthless, and powerful, but the Navy is more so.

7.  The Navy has a problem of divided loyalty.  The Navy was carried over
from the SF virtually intact, and is now expected to be completely loyal to
Clean.  They are not, and Clean knows it.  He also does not want to risk
civil war by bringing it up until his grasp of it is stronger.

8.  The Scouts have a fair amount of corruption and inefficiency.  They
have been given an impossible job, insufficient resources, and new people
from a diverse cultural background.  Unlike the Navy, which was primarily
Sylean, and primarily upper caste, the Scouts will take anyone who is
clever, and who can survive on a rough planet.  Over time, they will purge
themselves of the elements who do not fit in, but they have not yet had the
time to do so.

For the record, here is the time line I am using.  Note that the roughly
650 worlds in core should include something like 20 pop A, and 35 pop 9
planets.  I am going to make these between TL7 and TL C.  These are the
important worlds, as most of the population in the sector is on these worlds.

I am assuming that the Imperium can handle a doubling in size every two or
three decades, as long as none of them are TL11-12 hi pop worlds.  There
had best not be more of those being absorbed than there are currently high
tech, high pop worlds presently in the Imperium.

- -30: 19 worlds of Sylean Federation, a half dozen worlds in an independent
client state to rimward, and Shudusham as a friendly power.

0: ~30 worlds, having absorbed everything within jump three of Sylea.  In
addition, they have started to seduce the 30 some odd worlds of the
Interstellar Confederacy.  This would go better if they were not in the
middle of a shooting match with the Chanestin Kingdom.  Vland has
recognized Cleon as Emperor, but a clever lawyer might note that they have
not actually joined the Third Imperium.  This gives the 3I a lot of
information about the Vland sector from Vilani scouts, and potentially
gives them another dozen worlds, including a high pop, high tech world.

25: 100 worlds or so, scattered throughout Core.  Shudusham, the
Interstellar Confederacy, and the Chanestin Kingdom are now members,
allowing the Empire to digest up to four high pop worlds at a time.  Scouts
are scurrying everywhere in the sector, and widely outside of it.  Vland is
an actual member of the 3I, but is not aggressive about expanding through
the Vland sector.

50: 200 worlds of the Core sector are members, including 10 high tech, high
pop worlds.  The Core sector is essentially tied up, if not entirely loyal.
 25 worlds in Vland, including three HT/HP worlds are members.  Many worlds
outside Core are being aggressively courted.

75: The Vland Effort becomes aggressive, leading to 75 member worlds in
Vland, and 8 HTHP worlds.  The Lishun Main is colonized aggressively,
leading to an HTHP world, and several dozen small colonies.  450 worlds, 25
HTHP, in Core now recognize the 3I and are members.

100: Aside from a few HTHP worlds in Core, Core is entirely Imperial.
Vland has grown explosively, such that nearly all HTHP worlds in the sector
have become members, with the lesser worlds the responsibility of the
Vilani Bureaux.  (This is unusual, in that all other sectors show many more
low tech/low pop worlds becoming members before the high tech worlds.)
Lishun, Dagadushag, and Massilia will grow quickly over the next few
centuries, leading to various nasty border wars.  The Imperium will suffer
from the Marshmallow problem (crunchy outside, but soft center) for at
least the next several hundred years.

Perhaps, but I would think that the PE data is not going to derive from the
current UWP data, just like the various social factors in the UWP do not.

It does seem doable, though, to decide very carefully the exact algorithm
to generate the PE/social UPW data, and to then use an agreed upon seed and
generator to make the numbers.

Can we use a better generator than a simple LC 2^32 generator.  Most of
them seem a bit flaky to me.  Python uses a somewhat better critter with
three overlapping stacks of pseudo random numbers, and it seems to work a
bit better than the usual one I find implemented.  See below for references:

Use the first line, not an extension.  Macintosh and UNIX don\'t use
extensions (Macs have a file type in the file header, UNIX looks at the first
hundred or so bytes and applies some rules).

Could we have an extensible system?  One that defined the fields in the first
part of the file?  That way, if your software added a field that mine didn\'t
understand, mine would know enough to ignore it.

Another compatibility issue: accents and diacritical marks.  Many of my
worlds use the full range of pronunciation symbols, not just ASCII letters. 
For example: "Gense" (Gen-e accent grave-se).  How do we encode these?  My
Mac manages fine, but I suspect that it uses a modified ASCII for those
letters.  I could send you the codes, but is there an international standard
for this?

You may not have much choice.  I\'ve noticed with Metator that I spend a lot
of time fiddling with a system to make it interesting/useful/feel right.  The
first expanded system is rarely the one I finish with (let\'s hear it for the
"Expand" command!).

While it might be nice to have a standard way of generating a \'default\'
expanded system/PE, I think that we must still leave room for hand-coded
systems - which are more likely to be interesting as well.


Some Metator features we should include:

- - transport routes (start, finish, colour/meaning code)
- - labels (just a text label for an otherwise empty hex, but useful for
labelling areas)
- - anomalies (my catchall term for stuff like \'calibration points\' that isn\'t
a system but should be on the map, like black holes, x-ray pulsars,
Grandfather\'s Secret Cache...)

If they had need to, they could have.  Remember, the Chinese share a very
long border with the Russians, and have spent thousands of years keeping
barbarians out.  The US is focussed on power projection, the Chinese aren\'t.

I read a study of the PLA done in 1988.. Compared to the US Army\'s 12
divisions at the time, the PLA had 280, about half of which were armored or
mechanized.  

As for going to the moon, if Chairman Mao had declared a "goal of the
people", it would have happened.  He was too busy investing in
infrastructure and pacifying his neighbors to get involved.

   Eh?  Well now there\'s a *big* step back from reality.  Why not just

   Probably the same problem they had designing the A-10 here in
America--the recoil from the 30mm canon could have potentially caused
the plane to be forced backwards at low airspeeds (fortunately they were
able to solve the problem).

   A misplaced decimal (I had not heard that aspect of the story) would
not have stopped the Germans had circumstances been different--my point
still stands, nuclear weapons are a natural development during the early
stages of TL 6, rather than the product of one man\'s (or a small
group\'s) genius.  

   So how many kilotons (or perhaps megatons) yield would the German
bomb have produced had it been completed?  A hundred-fold more deuterium
would kick some serious tail....

I\'m a Macintosh-based programmer, although so far I haven\'t done much in
the way of Traveller software (just a small utility which I threw together
when I was regenerating some FS data so that it was semi-reasonable). I
have been thinking about writing something for Pocket Empires (I can draw a
window full of hexes =) ), but I don\'t really have the time.

This was an idea that has crossed my mind too - an easy way to write one
program and have people from both Wintel and Mac sides run it (and Unix I
believe). Of course this all depends on Micro$oft not stuffing up Java so
that it will only run "their" version of the language.

A truer notion of the important technological schism of the Jump Drive in
Traveller has never been uttered.
I couldn\'t agree more with this rationale for what distinguishes
interstellar societies.

This assumption, on the other hand, could be argued directly in reverse.
That "top-down" Vilani power structure could be seen as a detriment in
running so vast a corporate entity. Ritualistic, hierarchical, some might
even say stagnant, the Vilani are not perfect, and do their own kind of job
of mismanagement. With thier dynamic and inquisitive spirit, the Solomani
are far more likely to keep pushing the edge of any empitre they run,
instead of playing at-home power politics and letting the edges of one\'s
empire stagnate and sometimes even deteriorate. At least that\'s how I read
Traveller\'s very storied historical past. It is the Solomani who are
aggresive and a constant source of concern. Consider the first CT setting
of the Spinward Marches, a frontier exploited in part as a defense
perimeter against the dreaded telepahic Zhodani, but also arguably in
response to constant agressive Solomani pressures in the other direction.
The Vilani are a source of trmendous conservatism in Traveller, but that
doesn\'t neccesarily make them best suited for "long-term TL 15 interstellar
empire management" (a theoretical course they hopefully teach first year
Imperial Naval Officer Cadets!) :).

Wow. My first post.

Neat.

The Japanese nuclear program was a _lot_ farther along then most people
realize.  If my source is correct, they were within 1 year of having a
bomb, and were also working on the Hydrogen bomb.  Much of the Japanese
work was done at a sight in what is now North Korea.  After the war the
Soviets supposedly took every single item from the site, packed it up,
and took it home.  Naturally neither the post war Japanes (who were
antinuclear), the Soviets (who weren\'t about to admit how much of the
technology they borrowed) or the Americans (if other countries realized
how easy making nukes is there would be more nuclear proliferation) were
very eager to let this news out.

As far as we know everyone who has tried to build an atomic bomb (more
countrys then most people realize) has gotten it right the first time. 
Atomic weapons are an early TL 6 development.

On a second reading I didn\'t really make it clear which idea I liked! I
like the idea that the number of career changes a character can have is
limited by age. Not the idea that characters can only have one idea (which
I think is totally silly, my players wouldn\'t stand for, and I would end up
changing anyway). Please let me play T4.1 as close to the written version
as possible - allow characters to have *some* form of multiple careers,
whether it is limited by age (the suggestion above), or limited by what
career changes you can make (suggested earlier).

   As I\'m reading this stuff, Pam Tillis\' song "Queen of Denial" came on

   Will someone please explain to me what the attraction is of all the
handwaving, performing of bad magic tricks, rationalization and in

I agree with your arguments but cannot see what this has to do with PE.
The most powerful nations on earth has generally been dictatorships save
for the last 100 years or so. Democracies empower their people to innovate
and alter their society to fit the situation in ways dictatorships have a
hard time doing. With modern communications I\'d say democracy wins hands
down but when communication times (and cost) get prohibitive I think
feudalism and dictatorships could be better for the economy (not
neccessarily the same as good for the citizens).

The major thing here though is that PE are not pretending to be realistic
simulators of real world economies but rather simulations of pocket
empires. Traveller (the rpg you know) says feudalism is the most effective
way of controlling interstellar empires due to comm lag etc and if PE
didn\'t simulate that fact then it would be a crappy product (which it
DEFINATELY isn\'t).
Some of the complaints about PE that are valid (IMHO of course) are that it
doesn\'t as the TLs go up the transport costs etc don\'t follow and it seems
that it would be impossible to create the 3I from PE rules. Anything much
bigger than a subsector gets prohibitively expensive but I might be wrong
here.

Bitching about PE favouring dictatorships is like bitching about FF&S for
allowing me to build gravthrusters despite the fact that they break some
natural laws.

Yes and when they come home from work they take their little puppy for a

puppy?
You could of course put the dog on a treadmill with suitable moving imagery
of running rabbits or dogs of the opposite sex.

something).

Yeah yeah i didn\'t say it would be easy only that it would be a hell of a
lot easier to reproduce TL that you know will work. If a theory is 100%
correct you do NOT need to verify it.
(The only reason for doing verification is to corroborate a theory but then
a theory cannot be 100% correct - not with a finite amount of experiments
done on it.)

	Yes, I heard about that one - a gun the size of a Volkswagen Beetle
generates enough recoil to stall an A-10. It\'s still a popular joke 
in gaming circles around here. :) I heard they "solved" the problem 
by limiting the 30mm\'s RoF down to 8-round bursts.

	Agreed. Nuclear technology is pretty crucial to developing a 
spacefaring culture, nukes are just a side product. Unfortunately, 
they\'re the first applications of the new technology on many gov. 7 
worlds.

	No idea. I saw a story about the Norwegian guerrilla warfare on NBC 
Europe some time back, it was just mentioned in the passing as 
background to the story. Time to dig in the library again.

	In GURPS, the maximum damage depends on the hit location. A
characters hit points depend on his HT (or ST, as an optional rule;
bigger and stronger things are harder to kill). The maximum damage
for torso is HTx2, arms/legs HT/2, and hands and feet HT/3; anything 
over that, and you risk losing the limb permanently. There is no max. 
damage for head.

	Weapons which do more than 12 dice of damage (.50 BMG, Laser 
Rifle-13, PGMPs, FGMPs, meson guns etc.) are an exception: the impact 
is so powerful pressure effects from a, say, Barrett M-85 are enough 
to kill a person even if the bullet hits the leg. Also, explosive 
rounds are excluded.

	There is a legend of a bunch of guys playing T:2000 1st ed.. A PC 
was shot in the head and lived, and another PC had had first aid 
training. Player 2 is out for a smoke, certain that his character is 
going to die.

GM: There\'s nothing much you can do, you\'re in middle of combat and
you friend needs a full ER. 

Player 1: Well.. I\'ll try brain surgery anyway, to remove the bullet.
I\'ll use my Ka-Bar. 

GM: Madness, but if you roll 00 three times in a row you\'ll make it.

<Player 1 rolls snake eyes three times in a row> 

GM: *sigh* okay, so you dig into this guy\'s skull with your
Ka-Bar... by the way, roll against your perception. 

<Player 1 rolls against hid perception and fails miserably> 

<Player 2 comes in> 

GM: Player 2, you regain consciousness, just to see a Marauder, armed 
with an AKSU, step from behind a tree 5 meters away and take aim at 
you. Nobody else seems to notice him.

Player 2: Oh, okay, uh... I still have my M-16 in at hand?

GM: Yeah, sure, but...

Player 2, enthusiatically: So I\'ll nail the guy!

GM: Uh, your limbs aren\'t quite responding, roll d100 a couple of 
times, you see your medic friend...

Player 1: I saved your life, just using my knife to... 

<Player 2 rolls snake eyes 3 times in a row>

GM: *mouth hanging open*

Player 2: can I shoot the damn polack now?

GM: Uh, go ahead...

Naturally, he scored a critical hit. Only later Player 2 was told his 
character was under the knife at the time.

Silly, maybe, but it works.  Unarmored opponents take the full brunt
of *all* the weapon\'s effects, while troopers wearing battle dress
really only have to worry about penetrating shots.  While the plasma
"projectile" from a PCMP may indeed be very hot, it is also travelling
at over 4km/sec.  Temperature would be irrelevant since it is in
contact with the target for only a microsecond.

All is not lost, however.  I still agree that the max 3D damage rule
doesn\'t work in some instances.  Sure, PCMP "projectiles" will pass
through an unarmoured target as if he wasn\'t there (just like a
Browning .50 would).  When that target is wearing sufficient armour,
however, the "projectile" will punch through the front to attack the
target inside... but may not be able to punch through the back of the
armour to carry on down range.  What we now have is an effect greatly
feared by today\'s armoured tank crews-- hot, high velocity matter that
can\'t punch its way out and resorts to ricocheting around inside until
it\'s kinetic energy is spent.  Ouch!

Perhaps an optional rule such as:

a) subtract armour\'s armour rating from weapon damage,
b) apply remaining damage to target character, with a max of 3D,

...and...

c) if remaining damage is _not_ enough to penetrate armour\'s armour
   rating a second time, apply all remaining damage dice to target
   character.

You can even throw in some continuing damage to represent the effect
of the plasma as it slowly cools inside the armour... double Ouch!

Oops...is a non-graduate allowed to go to [N]OTC at all?
If not, perhaps the phrase "attendees at University..." in checklist
6.A.4 should be replaced with "graduates of University..."?
Could a waiver be used to get in?

For now, I\'ll use "GM fiat" to allow it (rather than reroll most of the
character), but say the skill benefits of NOTC don\'t apply because she
spent all the time catching up and avoiding getting caught out (her
later career wasn\'t exactly high-flying, so I think I can get away with
it).

Personal history:

Kiduram was born a Downer Guidechild in Idarmi, the largest and most
important community in the Erani belt.  Her mother Imdi was an
administrative City-Guide and therefore very important; her father
Kamgagarii was a somewhat lower status technical Guide.  When Kiduram
was only two, her father was convicted of gross negligence and his Guide
status was revoked.  Naturally, he had to move out; it was many years
before the child saw him again.

Imdi never recovered from the shock and shame of that event.  Betrayed,
she determined never again to put herself into such a vulnerable
position, and remained celibate for the rest of her life.  Her
determination was strengthened a few years later when Kamgagarii was
arrested for protesting against the government\'s "apathy" in the face
of Sylean expansion.  Ironically, despite his counter-productive
methods, his fears proved well-grounded.  The Derku Confederation
surrendered its independence to the Third Imperium when Kiduram was just
ten.

All this naturally took its toll on the child.  Distracted and isolated
at school, her studies suffered.  When she was twelve she started a wild
affair with a twenty-year-old Upper maintenance worker called Mugepa.
Within a year she was pregnant; her mother was furious, and insisted on
a termination, but Kiduram refused.  She moved in with Mugepa shortly
before the baby was born.  Kiduram was fourteen when the baby was born -
a boy, whom they named Akiga.

Things did not improve.  With three mouths to feed and cut off from
Guide resources, The couple struggled to make ends meet.  When Akiga was
eighteen months old, a new law was introduced to safeguard the welfare
of children whose parents "couldn\'t cope", and the baby was taken into
care.  Kiduram suspected her mother\'s influence, though this proved
unfounded.  The couple took to arguing most of the time, and it was
almost a relief when Mugepa decided to leave.

Relief was short-lived, when news reached Kiduram that her son had died
of a childhood illness aggravated by poor early nutrition.  Grief-
stricken and deeply in debt, Kiduram decided it was past time to take
better control of her life.  She accepted her mother\'s offer of
reconciliation, but not of financial support.  She was determined to
make it on her own...with just a little boost from her Guidechild status
to get her into University.

Unfortunately, her determination was not enough to overcome her lack of
practice at academic work.  Unable to concentrate, and outcast from
student society because of her father, she was dropped after the first
year.  Desperate, she used her position to gain a place in the Imperial
Naval OTC in Khamma, where her family problems would be less widely
known.

Kiduram scraped through NOTC, and at 21 entered the Navy as an Ensign.
Heading outsystem was an immense relief, and despite problems was the
happiest period of her life so far.  [I\'m not very up on military stuff,
and this is getting far too long anyway, so the next bit is vague.]

Her first time out, her crew was caught in an ambush and she suffered a
fairly major injury.  Despite making a complete recovery thanks to the
prompt action of IN medical personnel and being promoted to
SubLieutenant at least partly due to her bravery, she earned the ironic
nickname "Lucky" from her companions.  This trend continued, with her
receiving another serious injury when she was 26.  At 29, she ran
headlong into her old enemy - politics.  She ended up at cross-purposes
with a senior officer, and was caught up in a mess of conspiracy and
accusations.  Although her record was unblemished, she felt she could no
longer stay in the service, and at 33 headed out into the expanding
reaches of Imperial space as a free agent.

To take semiconductor manufacture as an example, as long as you 
retain basic awareness of physical chemistry -- including examples 
from textbooks -- you can go a long way towards refining silicon 
properly.  Zone refining (which "sweeps" impurities towards the end 
of a rod of impure Si) is the careful application of basic 
thermodynamics.  Special atmospheres might be indicated by the 
reactivity of Si.  Basic physical data will certainly be available, 
as will theoretical models of what goes on.

All the special recipes will be lost, and (more seriously) all the 
\'circuit diagrams\' for ICs will be gone too... you\'ll have to build 
up a whole new electronics industry from scratch, armed with only the 
knowledge that it is possible, some physical examples (relics) and 
the expectation of enormous profit.

It took maybe 40 years to reach current levels of technology from 
valves to chips.  Rediscovering the technology would almost certainly 
be quicker -- and might be better, too.

You\'ll never reproduce Coca-Cola, but you can reproduce a cola drink 
fairly easily, and that could become the new coke.  Might even taste 
better... Soylent Green, anyone?

There was a pretty interesting one-shot Traveller adventure in White Dwarf
(way back when it was still a gaming magazine instead of a zine for plastic
toy collectors). The players were small aliens on a scoutship that
misjumped into a backwater TL 5-6 planet engulfed in a world war. The PCs
badly needed deuterium to get out of there (so the story went) and the
engineer aboard located a deuterium factory in a rocky northern country
(Norway). The aliens were to steal some of the stuff but them unknowing
they decided to do it at the time of the resistance attacks, allied
bombings etc. Great fun to read but I didn\'t have the chance to play it and
someone borrowed it and never returned it.

Agreed, but technically Infrastructure maintainence is based on economy size
(see p45 ... essentially each infrastructure point costs 1% of manufacturing
GWP, multiplied by the "inefficiency factors"). It is building infrastructure
that is (wrongly IMHO) based on world size rather than population size.

And yes, even the (IMO unrealistic) vanilla PE is great as a background
generator.

I think one in a thousand is out by a factor of about twenty. IMO every 
noble on a planet, no matter how big, should at least know of each other.

Yes, although IMO the 3I is trying to slow down this process to a parsec
a year, thus keeping the expansion under control. This is aided by the
"Imperial zone" extending well beyond the actual border - I\'d guess that
the area within 20 parsecs is "imperialized" to one degree or another.

At my guess, all worlds within the Imperial borders are going to be colonised
to some degree. Using vailla PE you can make a 25+% profit a year from a 
low-effort colonisation (assume resources 3 ... so you export 1 of these
points, because you get infra 2 from a lo-effort colonisation. Therefore
you average 0.5 RU a turn in raw materials export income).

This is only an issue when the world is balkanised ... if you are indisputably
in control of a world, you are the person the Imperium deals with. Possibly
literally, if the Imperium or a faction therein sees you as a problem.

What happens if a noble promised it to a commoner, and the noble\'s lawyers

Yup. Gotta have some way that lo-tech worlds can earn the currency to

(oh, and btw, I consider the Zhunatsu School of Contact to be a relic of
the desperate early days of the Sylean Confederation, rather than of
an Imperium that can *always* negotiate from a position of strength).

This is also an issue with the Nobility and the Megacorps, which are the
three legs of the Imperial Triad. Cleon trod very carefully to make sure
everybody won out of the rise of the Imperium.

Mind you, it\'s easier to do when you have massive "peace dividends" from
the de-militarization of space as compared to the armed camps of worlds
of the Long Night.

Well, I\'m thinking of this more as a database "key" field. 

I want to be able to enter the data about planets and moons that are
scattered throughout the various sources. And it may be mostly used in
a database that has nothing but name and location.

My problem is that I need data files that cover everthing from sectors
on down.... right now I\'m using dBase files:

Field  Field Name  Type       Width
    1  NAME        Character     30
    2  TYPE        Character     20
    3  LOCATION    Character     15
    4  SOURCE      Character     30
    5  SOURCE_LOC  Character     20
    6  DETAILS     Character     37
** Total **                     153

Name is the name.
Type is SECTOR, SUBSECTOR, STAR, WORLD, MOON
Location is as in my example above.
Source is the book or article

Simple analysis shows that this is *far* too much dirt to move. In
fact, one of the key items in the building of the small "test pyramid"
in the show I mentioned was that they showed that it *would* work to
wrap the earthern ramp around the pyramid, having it supported on the
lower layers of the pryamid instead of having to have this *huge* ramp.

Sure, but consider a belt 5 AU in radius with a million "large" bodies.
This is much like our asteroid belt. 

5 AU means that it is 15.7 AU in circumference. or about 2.4 *billion* km.
Divide that by a million and you get a seperation of 2400 km. And
that\'s ignoring the fact that the asteroids will be varying distances
from that 5 AU radius circle!

So 10k km is an average seperation....

Doesn\'t look that far off. Ion drives *do* have huge Isps. The trick is
that the thrust is so low. Look at the table. A 15 ton ion drive only
produces a thrust of 1/20th of a ton. Which means that with *just* the
engine, no fuel, you get a max accel of 1/300th of a g. With MPD you
get 1/50th of a g as the limit. 

So neither is going to be a "super drive".

The problem is that there are *several* standards. If we stick to
8-bit, then we are "limited" to only some of the possible symbols. ISO
Latin-1 (ISO 8859-1) is the "standard" for things like Windoze. Here it
is:

19. Table of ISO 8859-1 Characters
This section gives an overview of the ISO 8859-1 character set.  The
ISO 8859-1 character set consists of the following four blocks:

00	19	CONTROL CHARACTERS
20	7E	BASIC LATIN
80	9F	EXTENDED CONTROL CHARACTERS
A0	FF	LATIN-1 SUPPLEMENT

The control characters and basic latin blocks are similar do those
used in the US national variant of ISO 646 (US-ASCII), so they are not
listed here.  Nor is the second block of control characters listed,
for which not functions have yet been defined.

Ask their neighbours if China has no desire to project its power. It is

I wouldn\'t call myself a macintosh programmer, but I program on a Macintosh
- - in Java. There was a similiar thread asking about "who\'s interested in
Java coding" - I know of Paul Dale (You\'re lurking out there somewhere I\'ll
bet) who _is_ a Macintosh programmer down under, and Ethan Henry who had
out that initial subsector browser. I don\'t know what happened to Khoene,
but he made some nice modification\'s to Ethan\'s code - he went by "Killer"
on the TML.

I\'ve half a pile of Java code, which I\'m willing to share as folks are
interested or like, and will to be a repository for the code snippets that
people are interested in using. Some of it\'s pretty complete, some of it\'s
work in progress. A great deal of the good stuff was given to me from Paul
Dale.

Ah, well, um, ah...

You could do that, sure. I guess I got carried away a bit.

Still, what separates an experimental TL-12 vacc suit from a TL-13
one and what separates an experimental TL-13 vacc suit from a TL-14
one? Not much. It is a big wig of split hairs.

Anyways, the other poster (I forget who) who said that intact or not,
it would be stupid to trust your life to a 1,000 year old vacc suit,
I\'d have to agree. :) Throwing high-TL items into adventures is like
throwing in magic items - it\'s just a gimmick. If I wanted my players
to find TL-14 vacc suits and rods of resurrection, I wouldn\'t play
Traveller.

Which brings me to another point - Marc, I don\'t like the \'only Vargr
can change careers\' rule. Makes Traveller seem more like D&D again.
Although, I am quite fond of that half-Vargr fighter/cleric/Naval Officer
I rolled up...

same thing that the humans do...there HAS to be excersise space and room
aboard starships, else people in the far future are going to be the
flabbiest couch potatoes you\'ve ever seen. A longish treadmill would do
just fine ("meet George Jetson!"). Or you could design your ship so as to
have the staterooms interior, with a long corridor encircling
them...instant jogging tracks. 

Of course there\'s far more precedence for cats on board ships of any
kind, but that\'s a flamewar of another stripe ALLtogether (which I avoid, 
by having four cats AND two dogs)

I\'ve always thought it was just once for being in that career. Some 
skills are dependent upon reaching a certain rank, or being 
commissioned. Those, too, would only be received once.

Apply a -DM (=no. terms served?) to the enlistment roll of the new career if 
you want to change jobs (why would the Navy want an ex-insurance salesman?). 
If you fail, spend a year (or maybe just 2d months?) unemployed, then try 
again (a waiver can be used to avoid this).

No one expects the Solomani Empire!

Our chief advantage is our TL 14 vacc suits, and our TL 14 storage lockers.
Wait, that\'s our TWO, two chief advantages are our TL 14 vacc suits and
storage lockers. And our TL 14 storage locker sealant. Our THREE,

I\'ve recently been combing through all my back issues of Dwarf and Dragon
magazines and reusing a BUNCH of stuff on my latest group that hasn\'t seen
the light of day in 10+ years. Man, what a good magazine! Every issue 
jammed with great stuff for Traveller, D&D, Cthulhu, Runequest, Judge
Dredd, what have you. I\'ve got them all from #32 up to #115, when they 
finally admitted that they would no longer have any articles on any game
except Warhammer and Warhammer40K. A great magazine until GW
decided they wanted to be the T$R of the east side of the pond.

I wonder who I\'d need to contact about getting permission to post some of
that stuff up on a web page? Too much wonderful stuff to let it just fade 
away...

I am in.  My stuff is currently being written in pretty much straight ANSI
C++, which also lets it work on the PC, and may let it work on the Linux
box as soon as I can find a version of gcc that handles exceptions.

I have considered Java, but I have not yet had time to learn it.  I
understand that Java Beans will alleviate many of the UI gripes that people
had with Java, and so am rather intrigued by the idea.

Cool character, John. Talk about a tough life! I wonder if I shouldn\'t try
to balance the Life Events tables a little, to make for fewer \'hard knocks\'
and more beneficial results. Or maybe "Lucky" just happened to have a
string of bad rolls. Also, a lot depends on how the results are
interpreted; being caught up in political turmoil, for instance, can be as
much a chance for positive change as negative.

Anyway, it\'s cool to see how the system worked for you.

I, too, am in favour of career changes. It doesn\'t necessarily have to
be easy, just *possible*.

I think a career limit is too arbitrary. I would favour modifiers to the
enlistment roll, cumulative for each career change. Vargr characters
would not get the modifier, characters in Vilani culture would receive
more severe modifiers.

I agree with another poster (Suz?) who stated that it could be
impossible (or at least, more difficult) for Imperials to switch
*military* careers. Switching from Army to Navy to whatever encourages
munchkinism.

May I introduce a friend of mine, who has been listening intently to
this discussion, and wishes to clear up some Terran misconceptions.
Without further adieu, Mr. Eneri Laparkikumiin:


I have been listening to comments on the Tech Level of the Ramshackle
Empire with some interest. Although I have the greatest of respect for
my Solomani colleagues, I must point out some of the growing
misconceptions offered in recent email, regarding the power structure
and decision making protocols of the Vilani people.

It is the Solomani bias which labels Vilani management "stagnant" and
"top-down" in authority. Nothing could be further from the truth. The
opinion of each member of a Vilani corporate entity carries equal
weight, regardless of seniority. The viewpoints and opinions of the
lowliest apprentice are heard, and that opinion is judged on its own
merit. The Vilani management style is consensus-driven, not mandated
from "on-high".

In matters of day-to-day management, decisions are decidedly
"bottom-up". Managers are given great leeway to solve problems that may
arise. The only caveat is that all decisions are reviewed by central
planning authorities -- decisions not in the best interests of the long
term goals of the corporation or Vilani Tradition may require a
reprimand, but only the severest of transgressions result in the
dismissal of the offending manager.

I must take offence at the first poster\'s generalization of the Vilani
as having a "top-down, do-it-my-way-and-don\'t-screw-around" power
structure. It is the pervasive Solomani bias towards individual power
and authority which colours this poster\'s perception. Each person is
encouraged to submit his or her own opinions regarding the
implementation of corporate goals. No Vilani would ever say "do it my
way!"

I grow weary of the continuing misrepresentation of the Vilani culture
as "stagnant", and this characterization being offered as the reason for
the collapse of the First Imperium and rise of Terran control. Vilani
Tradition continues to evolve, and new methods are continually
introduced after rigorous simulation of long-term effects and
discussion. The Vilani believe in the long-term management of resources,
we never lose sight of what Terrans call "the big picture". "Missing the
forest for the trees" is an alien concept to all Vilani. It is only
Solomani bigotry which labels Vilani culture as being "Stagnant".

It most certainly wasn\'t the Vilani management style which caused the
collapse of the 
Ziru Sirka. There were many factors, but as a gross oversimplification,
much can be attributed to the unexpected discovery of the Terrans, their
rapid and unprecidented technological advancement and ascendancy, and
the unrelenting disruption of our infrastructure and lines of
communication.

Thank you for this opportunity to discuss our culture and management
style. I hope that dialogue continues in future, with the goal of a more
intimate understanding of each of our people\'s culture.

I am yours sincerely,

Eneri Laparkikumiin

Changes in this version:

1) New about dialog (looks cooler, works the same)

2) High population and GWP numbers used to show up as negative on the
Sociological Report.  I fixed this by displaying the really high numbers in
millions/billions/trillions, which also eliminated superfluous significant
digits.

3) Some memory bugs were fixed, and a couple more now fail better (ie. you
get told that you\'ve run out of memory).

4) A zooming bug has been fixed.


Unfixed bugs/unimplemented features:

1) System charts and maps _still_ don\'t print properly, mainly because I
haven\'t figured out how to print colour icons yet.  Any advice from Mac
programmers here appreciated.  (I\'ve got the Inside Mac books, but their
examples don\'t work with my THINK Pascal 4.0 compiler.)

2) Military forces are just displayed as battalion and SDB factors, rather
than being expanded into units.  If anyone can come up with a decent
algorithm (I\'m not really a military bloke) I can implement it.

3) World mapping is still rather incomplete.  I\'m been partly waiting until I
get the icon problem fixed, because if I have to rewrite the display code
then I\'ll also have to rewrite this code, and I have rewriting stuff.

4) I haven\'t implemented T4 animal encounter tables yet.  If someone wants to
email me _official correct_ rules (no errata for this in the IG site, in
spite of my mailing them corrections last year) I can implement it.  

5) Mountains not yet implemented.  I plan on doing mountains based on "The
Mountain Environment" with some tinkering.  Is there actually any demand for
this?

I got that number by looking at the number of nobles in the present day UK,
plus an estimate that through most of the medieval period, roughly 99% of
the population was peasantry, while 1% was noble.  This changed
dramatically when the middle class became more important, and the
percentage dropped by a tenth.

I do agree that this is likely more nobles than there really should be, but
I got a strong feeling from the M0 materials that virtually everyone of
major importance and administrative heft had been knighted.

Given further that Social Standing determines cost of living, we again have
the problem that to be at the high side of the income curve, you have to be
a knight  We could fix this easily enough - allow people of high social
standing to be equivalent to nobility, but not titled themselves.  Perhaps
in the same family, or heirs to the same fortunes, or intendants?

Eventually, yes, but I suspect that you get more reward for colonizing a

I was a bit unclear.  The way I am playing it is:

The Imperium tries to recognize the single competent government of the
planet.  Once it has been recognized and offered membership in the
Imperium, then it can do very little to change the form of government.  In
fact, major wars can be considered internal matters, as long as they do not
view it as undue offworld interference.

If the planet is balkanized, then they can weasel a bit.

If the planet is "too low tech to be aware of the full implications of
membership", the Imperium will recognize a trading company as a partner
with the world\'s current government up through membership, and often past
it.  (This allows for colonialism.)  Note that it is considered quite
popular to pick a particular tribe or group on a TL1 planet, teach them
enough to make a good showing, and then to make them a partner with a big,
powerful company that can run pretty freely over the natives, as long as
they do not exert undue influence in the eyes of the Moot and the foreign
office.

If the world is not yet a member, they have a lot more freedom to fiddle
with internal matters.  Another Imperial group can ask to be recognized as
the official trading partner, and if the Foreign Office chooses to not
recognize your own prior claim, or chooses to say that you did not act with
due diligence, then someone else might get recognized as the appropriate
partnering company with the world government.

This is not allowed usually.  If the Noble promises it to another noble,
there are very few circumstances where they can check up, or refuse to
deliver.  It is a point of pride to deliver even if the other noble does
not, and then to make it clear to other nobles that the one who reneged is
a cad and a blaggard.

The noble is allowed, on the other hand, after promising something to a
commoner, to check up that the commoner did actually perform their side of
the bargain, and to refuse to pay up if the commoner reneged significantly.
 They must carry through, though, if the commoner makes a good faith
effort.  They even have to put a good face on it.  This balances the
ability to control damn near everything - they have to be careful what they
promise, as they have to carry through in almost every case, even if the
person they promise it to cannot force them to.

This is why a noble representative is so important - they can commit to
things to other nobles that cannot be backed out of.  They can also make a
promise to a commoner that will be interpreted fairly liberally in favor of
the commoner, as long as a good faith effort by the commoner happens.

Yep, though I view the navy as the area where Cleon\'s control is weakest.

Agreed.  I think it will be the biggest problem with the brand new agencies

If they don=92t have Universities, Institutes, and Academies, then there =
has to be something that will provide education.

I propose the following elements=85

Family or home based schooling.
Clan based training.
On The Job Training
Special Training.

Family (provides the basic education that a character begins with). Reading
writing, basic skills. There may be some sharing of training between
families. Roll half die for Family Education.

Clan based Education. Consolidated much like High School. Segregated between
boys and girls. Roll half die for education increase.

On The Job Training (Skill). Join a career. After joining and serving 1 term
to prove your worth, then apply for OJT (this being significant OJT rather
than how to clean pots). If accepted, then resolve the next term, and each
year ALSO roll 7- to get +1 Edu. At the end of the term, if you got +3 or
more Edu, you get a Ya-N (where N is the current level of Edu) which PROVES
you have an Education at that level. You also get a skill with level equal to
the Edu increase.

Which skill? OJT specifies a skill (any skill) available in the career. OJT
is in addition to, and simultaneous with the ordinary chargen career
resolution.

OJT is allowed ONCE.

Effects. It means we get relatively well qualified people early, but they are
at least committed to the career.

Success at OJT (getting a Ya-N) requires serving the next term, and gives a +
on promotion.

Special Training (Skill Name). Anyone with Ya-6+ (that=92s a degree, not the
Edu itself) can apply (some sort of roll) for Special Training (Skill Name).
This can be in any skill, and its a form of Learning By Doing, but with
greater support from knowledgeable tutors. It starts at the beginning of a
term, and the character rolls Int or less- each year (DM -1 each year of
study) to continue (if failed, then the character reverts to normal chargen
within the career for the rest of the term. For each successful year, the
character receives 1 level of the skill being studied, and +1 Edu. At the end
of the term, Special Training Ends automatically. At the end of Special
Training, the character also receives Ya-N (where N is the current Edu
level). Again, this is certification that the character has a certain Edu.

Special Training is possible any number of times, but Edu increases have to
be tempered somehow.

Success at Special Training=20
The maximum Ya-N awarded is Ya-10, even if Edu is higher.

Notice=85 an Aslan can have several Ya-Ns at various levels (Ya-5, Ya-7,
Ya-11). Ya-5 is the lowest of certificates=85 (based on family Edu 1 and Clan
Edu 1, then OJT +3 Edu).

Family Learning at Mother=92s knee can get you Edu-3; Clan learning can get you
up to about Edu-6. Thereafter, Education is available ONLY through careers.
In addition, Special Training is all in one skill. This clearly reflects the
focussed nature of Aslan education, rather than the liberal education nature
of human Edu systems.

Special Training is administered by a Kteai Reaauakh (translates as "Training
Organizations") which provides the tutors, curriculum, and testing for the
specific training (many scholars make a living as employees of a KR).

Vargr Education should probably be based on Mentors, which is why it doesn\'t
appear here.

Because....the TML is a forum where EVERYONE can share their ideas. 
Reguardless of who will win "The Great RoM TL Debate", "TaskWars", or

rules...thats fine....but as for handwaving and rationalizations on the
TML, such things are often the springboard for possible adventure ideas.
If only two people on the entire TML want to have a universe where Cleon

themselves on the TML and they should be welcome to do it.  While they
should expect to hear other ideas to the contrary, they should not be
asked to just "give it up".

Take Eris\' posts.  He may be a canon heretic, and I may not swallow all
he says, but by golly he comes up with some good ideas sometimes.

This if not a flame on Harold\'s post (though he may have some "arrows"
for me now) but it smells faintly of the "if it ain\'t the mainstream TML

ugly head quite often these days.  Harold, I would guess that you really
didn\'t expect an answer to that question...but...you did ask.

I\'ve been stretching my legs a bit in MS Excel (as users of my Vehicle
Design Spreadsheet can attest). I just had a thought -- How many people
would find an Excel add-in of Traveller Functions useful?

As an example, I whipped up equivalent functions that handle the entire
traveller spectrum of "extended" Hexadecimal Digits. 0123..ABC..XYZ

These are the functions:

Dig2Num(Digit) - Converts a single Traveller digit to a number.
Num2Dig(Num)   - Converts a number to Traveller digit.

To use, select Insert-->Macro-->Module in Excel 5.0, and copy-and-paste
in the following:

\' ---- Cut Here ----
\'
\' Converting Traveller pseudo-Hexadecimal Digits
\' ==============================================
\' Copyright 1997 by Glenn Hoppe
\'
\' Dig2Num - Converts a Traveller digit to a number.
\'
\' Num2Dig - Converts a number to pseudo-Hex digit.
\'
\' Illegal values give #VALUE! error
\'
\' Hex Digits: 0123456789ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZ
\'
\' Note: I and O by convention are skipped to avoid confusion
\'       with the digits 1 and 0.
\'
\' Traveller is (tm) FarFuture Enterprises

Function Dig2Num(Digit As String) As Integer
    digits = "0123456789ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZ"
    If Digit = "" Then
        Dig2Num = [isvalue()]
    Else
        Dig2Num = InStr(digits, Digit) - 1
        If Dig2Num = -1 Then Dig2Num = [isvalue()]
    End If
End Function

Function Num2Dig(Num As Integer) As String
    digits = "0123456789ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZ"
    If Num < 0 Or Num > 33 Then
        Num2Dig = [isvalue()]
    Else
        Num2Dig = Mid(digits, Num + 1, 1)
    End If
End Function
\'
\' ---- Cut Here ----

Now in your worksheet, you can use those functions! What other functions
could be devised? Some obvious ones:

GenWorld()          - Returns a UPP
GenSystem(UPP)      - Returns a system
GenWord(Language)   - Returns a Random word using language table
GenAnimal(UPP,Type) - Returns an animal
D(6)                - Roll d6
D(3)                - Roll d3
D(2,6)              - Roll 2d6

An add-in could be made out of the Macro sheet, so that every new
spreadsheet can access these Traveller functions. That\'d be neat, eh?

Shoot, I wish I had time to do Pocket Empires ...

Yep; a common, agreed to structure is what we need to make it possible for
each Ref\'s pet creation to be interchangable with other Refs. The American
National Standards Institute has never written one line of compiler code,
but all vendors of Cobol or Fortran compilers MUST meet the ANSI minimums to
call their products Cobol or Fortran. That\'s how DEC came up with Dibol some
years back; didn\'t meet the ANSI minimums, so couldn\'t call it Cobol.

Perhaps Traveller be one of those leading the way from paper publishing to
electronic with a base rules processor code and player / ref extensible
\'modules\' to plug in, for any setting, Imperium or not.

Excerpt from "_Spinward Struggles: A History of the Five Frontier Wars_
by Brig. Gen. Mack M. McTaggert, IMC (Ret.), Military Historian from the
University of Trin."

...One of the main reasons that the frontier conflicts were so unusual was
due primarily to the existing lines of communication. While Naval Couriers
made the information trail Coreward far faster than the X-Boat routes, this
still left a significant time gap between current fleet movements and the
orders arriving from the Core. This resulted in some unusual situations. In
the case of the Third Frontier War, for example, an armistice was signed
with the Zhodani before news of the outbreak reached the Core. At the very
least, ground commanders were free from the inevitable second guessing that
would result from such a dramatic time lag. Many a fleet commander has been
paralysed by doubt and the pressure of having to make serious strategic
decisions on the fly. It is this author\'s opinion that certain officers are
more prone to feel the pressure of this kind of situation than others. Safe
to say that the need for a clear line of command was a cultural effect that
not only resulted in slow reaction time on the part of some Naval
commanders during the Frontier Wars, but may also have been a factor in the
downfall of the First Imperium. It is perhaps fortunate for us as
decendants of a stable, thriving Imperial structure that these lessons were
learned on Earth thousands of years ago by the Romans, who understood the
need to integrate themselves with cultures on the fringe of their Empire.
While this may have led to their eventual downfall, it kept their empire
running for a long time with a minimum need for orders from on high. They
had at their disposal a most sophisticated communication network for the
time, supported by an equally sophisticated infrastructure, but they did
not need to rely on it as heavily as others have with more recent
organizational frameworks on a stellar scale. History can teach us many
lessons, and it is hoped that those in a position to do something about it
can learn from the events of the Frontier Wars that independant minded
commanders are worth their weight in gold on the edges of an Imperial
entity such as ours. Leave the bureaucracy to those suited for it, and keep
them out of the field of battle...*

Yes, I\'m still here after eight (or is it nine?) years.  I\'m also not a Mac
programmer anymore - I\'m working in computer security these days.  But, I do
think I could restart mac programming again with a *very* short warm up period.
However, for the kind of stuff we\'ll be doing, java is probably better because
it is reasonably portable and ends up looking okay on most platforms.

I don\'t post much these days because of the traumas required: I\'ve got to
subscribe to the list, post and unsubscribe again.  Our local sys admin has
setup a feed from the mailing list into a (private) local news group.
Unfortunately, there isn\'t a reverse feed for replies :-(

I don\'t remember doing much good stuff.  The Traveller program which I feel is
the best I\'ve written (TNE Utilities) wasn\'t written in java :-)

I am also willing to provide some help with programming projects, either java
or mac.  However, I am rather short of time at the moment so I don\'t know how
much I\'ll be able to do - what with my wife and daughter and another child on
the way and a recent change of jobs things are pretty hectic.

Other than Tibet, and border clashes with Vietnam and India, the Chinese
have shown no interest in doing much outside their traditional borders.
The discovery of oil in the Spratly Islands may change that, and is
probably behind the PRC\'s recent blue-water navy development program.

Remember that the PRC has tolerated a British enclave until very recently,
and still shows no sign of doing more about the existence of Taiwan (aka
Nationalist China) than insisting that it is part of China, and protesting
its recognition by the UN.

Hope you are ready for a big meal...  Chinese mechanized forces are
equipped with Type-50 APCs, a nice little battlefield taxi, similar to the
US M-113.  Standard armor is the Chinese built variant of the T-62/64
series tank.  While hardly modern, outnumbering you opponent 25-1 can and
will make a difference on the battlefield.  The PLA has a very large
artillery component, and has stockpiled ammo.  Most of the artillery is
truck-drawn.

The PLA (with it\'s naval and air components) is perfectly suited for the
role China has asked of its warriors for thousands of years.. keep the
barbarians out of the Middle Kingdom.

To bring this back to Traveller, I can see where the vast majority of
planetary defence forces would have a similar goal and organization.. since
you are always going to be on the defensive, you might build more tanks by
substituting tracks for grav, hordes of troops for a few power-armor elite.

There\'s an interesting book called _Heisenberg\'s War_ the thesis of which is
that the scientists in charge of the German A-bomb research (Heisenberg et
al...and yes, it was _that_ Heisenberg) deliberately fudged their work to
screw up the program in order to prevent the Nazis from getting the bomb, and
preventing such interesting historical what ifs as V-2s with nuke warheads...

If I remember right, you were posting about the cost of life support in
"The Long Way Home". In that case, it doesn\'t matter, since the
introduction says the ship has been set up for several months away from
Imperial space (I don\'t have my Traveller stuff here at work, so I can\'t
give a direct quote). In the general case though, I have no idea. I\'m just
glad my PCs haven\'t thought of that one yet!

I have a suggestion.  Please consider the following as a possible
replacement for your ruling on "no career changes for non-Vargr."  

Vargr are the only race that can change careers *without* *penalty*.  
All others suffer a cumulative DM -2 on Continuation/Continuance rolls for 
each career change.  (Example: A Rogue becomes a Merchant.  When rolling to 
continue as a Merchant, he has a penalty of DM -2.  Later on, he switches 
(again) to Noble.  His penalty to continue as a Noble is DM -4.)  

This option, should you decide to adopt it, allows Vargr characters to
retain their racial characteristic of "career hopping" (which is, I
presume, your rationale for your ruling), while *also* giving other
characters the *option* of small-scale "career hopping" (and as a player, I
like having options).  

Thank you.

1) There are two ships floating about in the vastness of space.  One ship
is kitted out with two huge stonking tractor beam mounts.  It grabs the
other ship with its tractors and begins its jump sequence.  Does the second
ship get \'dragged\' into J-space with the first?  All the way?  Or just
partly?  

2) (Not intending to start another TL brushfire war) Is TL16 too high a TL
for the \'Final\' years of the Third Imperium?  (This goes back to the first
question, BTW, because only at TL16 according to FF&S1 do you get an
acceptable level of force for tractors.  Mind you, I\'d love it if someone
could say, \'oh sure, it was TL18 for tractor beams.  yeah.\' :)

3) Suggest a good approximate toughness value for asteroid \'rock\' material
(using the T:TNE system).

4) (Again, trying not to restart a flame war (though pre-emptively donning
the \'didn\'t you read the !@%#%$ FAQ?!?\'-proof suit)) Does anyone think
\'Virus\' would be more workable if it were really a plague of highly
virulent nanites that hop from ship to ship and to stations and planetary

Just a thought that has been smouldering in my mind for the last week or
so. In many cases JoT as written can be very powerfull. Indeed, there was a
story about a week or so ago of a GM who had a player who had put every
skill increase he could in to JoT, and so could do almost anything. Someone
else replied that in CT a player could only have a skill level of 1 in JoT
(or that skill levels above 1 didn\'t make any difference - I can\'t remember
which), and that JoT allowed you the chance to do the task as an unskilled
roll.

In T4, the method used in CT wont work, since there is now the default
skills list. What I suggest is a mixture of the two - for every increase in
JoT in chargen, the player picks _TWO_ skills from the default skill list
which he or she has some familiarity in. These skills are treated as 0
level skills, which means that the player doesn\'t have a penalty for their
task roll for not having the skill, but they don\'t get any bonus either. If
a character later improves the skill (either in chargen or by using
experience), they don\'t pick another skill - this just means that the
character has had enough use of the skill to know more than the bare
minimum.

Optionally a character could be able to choose _any_ two skills (but I
don\'t really like that idea).

I haven\'t tried this out [since it would have to be implemented in chargen]
but at face value it seems like a good idea. It means that a character with
JoT-8 is no longer a super munchk... I mean character =) able to do
everything - they just know a bit about a lot of things. Anyone who has had
any training in the skill (ie: skill level 1) should still perform better
than the character with JoT (ignoring differences in characteristics).

What do people think?

Cheers,
Jason

Atrocity".... "Weapons which do more than 12 dice of damage... are an

     Then James Lindsay restates his penchant to make damage determination
somewhat more cumbersome than what the designers for T4 wished (at least in
spirit).  Also, let me point out to James that while lasers do pass at the
speed of light by their very nature (light amplication at varying wavelengths
from UV ones at TL9 to the Xray spectrum lasers at TL14) and thus their
kinetic energy element of damage is greater than their thermal component
(since Kinetic Energy is the product of one half the mass multiplied by the
SQUARE of the velocity), the fusion and plasma based reactions fire a bolt of
superheated plasma energy, which, though may move quite quickly, will NOT in
anyway approach the speed of light as James suggests (c is actually 3
km/sec).  The superheated energy is what counts (thermal) and not really a
time dependent thing.  
    But all this is superfluous nitpicking and a grand example of what
happens when a poor rule is established (and it in itself is not wholly
clear, as everyone seems to have their own interpretation) in the name of
game balance, when it doesn\'t make sens, and requires great mental gymnastics
to justify.  All the more reason to scrap this abomination for good in T4.1

Not necessarily, we could say the product of scientists * years * CR to
discover Fusion plus was in the trillions, and that the Vilani Imperium and
RoM simply never made the required investment. Why? Perhaps there were
other discoveries, like Meson weaponry or alternate technologies that never
panned out, which took priority.

It is not true that a never before discovered invention must be the work of
one (or a few) individuals; both the atomic bomb and the supersonic
transport were invented for the first time by a huge team of professionals.

Nor does Fusion plus need to be a unique invention. Other planets or
civilizations (like the Hive Federation) may have discovered it
independently or it could have been based on earlier research which was
never fully developed. Note that page 86 of Milieu 0 says most of Zhunastu
Industial Laboratories\' discoveries were actually based on recovered
technologies. There are all kinds of possibilities.

Add a few portholes/viewscreens along the bulkheads and you\'ve got a nice

I\'m sure a ship of *any* size is going to have an exercise area/room with
treadmills and stationary exercise equipment.

Cats are traditional for ships of all kinds, and would handle a starship as
well as they do living 24 hours a day in a house.  ;-> Small dogs should be
able to adjust too.  Big dogs would have more of a problem.

	Sad as it is, dictatorships give a head start for when you\'re 
building national economy from the scratch. Look at South Korea: In 
the early 50\'s it was just another developing nation, until people 
put a dictator (govt. A) to rule the country. Today, it\'s competing 
with Japan. The same development seems to be going on in most of the 
Pacific Rim countries, like Malesia (where you can get a 15-year 
prison sentence for illegal possession of a modem), and Singapore 
(where you\'re fined for chewing gum in public areas).

	It would seem like dictatorships send the economy soaring, human 
rights and democracy come later when Big Money is talking.

   Not really.  Because if you can produce experimental TL-12, that
implies that your current tech level is at least tech level late TL-11. 
An experimental TL-13 suit could be produced by a society late in TL-12,
which fits perfectly with the generally accepted canon (yes, I know what
Leroy et al think, including that mysterious "silent majority" that are
suppose to agree with them, but they are a minority none the less). 
Mass produced (even at low levels) TL-14 vacc suits imply that the RoM
had achieved at least low level TL-14, since we are now moving beyond
the realm of the experimental and into the realm of more mature
technology.

   I prefer to think of all this as being like the struggle to save a
historic neighborhood.  To someone who doesn\'t know the story behind all
these old buildings, they have no problem with somebody tearing down a
few (or as some people would like to do, rip out the whole thing and put
up some condos and a strip mall).  They can\'t understand why others
would care about house \'X\' or store \'Y\'.  But those of us who have lived
in the Traveller neighborhood all these years (and lived through all the
changes in game mechanics) see the T4 bulldozers and we get upset.  This
is not a matter of how many dice to use for task resolution, or whether
or not to use thruster plates.  The storyline is what holds everything,
everybody, in the Traveller community together.  The last thing we need
is yet one more reason to be driven apart.

   I agree to an extent.  Sometimes a good red herring chase after
"magical" items gives the players some perspective. 

   In a TNE session a while back, I allowed my players to have TL 15
battledress and TL 15 fusion rifles.  They thought they had hit the
jackpot, until they remembered where they were--an amusement park. 
Fortunately they didn\'t get too seriously engaged into their next
firefight when they realized what they were wearing and carrying were
props and beat a hasty retreat.

   I have no problem with people discussing variants.  You may not have
been here for it, but I was was of those a while back who was
enthusiastically posting to a topic concerning alternative endings to
the Rebellion had Virus not been released.  This despite the fact that
I\'ve also been one of the strongest supporters of the TNE setting.

   When an official publication starts making statements that don\'t jibe
with previous canon material, that\'s another thing altogether. 
Traveller did not make its reputation by contradicting background
material.  That\'s why when people go out of their way in an attempt to
present a fig leaf to cover for the apparent error, I\'m left scratching
my head.

>Take Eris\' posts.  He may be a canon heretic, and I may not swallow all

   That he does, but he doesn\'t claim to be the official voice of canon
material either.  Those that claim to be publishing official material
have the dual responsibility of making it fit with everything else and
making it entertaining.  That\'s why a lot of people would rather base
their own homegrown material loosely on the canon Traveller universe, or
pick an out of the way corner of the Imperium where they can develop
material that is canon but involves fewer cross checks with existing
stuff.

   As a variant, no problem, though explaining how they died out could
present a *big* problem.  Actually Virus works like a nanite in a lot of
ways (physically reconfiguring hardware), but isn\'t restricted to a
particular physical form.  Virus may start off as silicon but can also
be gallium arsenide, or whatever they will make computer circuits out of
in the far future.

2000 years is long enough for any semiconductor based electronics to be
worthless because the dopant atoms will have migrated across the PN
junctions. Also, any metal on metal contacts will have welded through
molecular diffusion as well. In effect *any* materials in contact for
2000 years and with a vacuum tight fit *will* "weld" into a solid piece.

And all known (and likely) flexible plastics contain volatiles. They\'ll
have evaporated over the centuries leaving the plastics rather brittle.

But even if the flexible parts have stayed flexible, the problems with
self-welding ought to make things interesting.

People *really* under-estimate the difficulties with long term storage
of items. Especially high tech ones.

You don\'t use deuterium in a fission bomb, and they wouldn\'t have tried
for a fusion bomb. The dueterium was for moderating a reactor. The most
popular (and safest) design for reactors uses heavy water as a
moderator. 

Building a bomb with a hundred times too much uranium wouldn\'t work.
You don\'t get that much extra "boom", and besides, the *pieces* would
be big enough to "catastrophically disassemble" on their own. 

About the time they got a "squib" explosion after getting a few kilos
of uranium too close, they\'d have realized they\'d goffed and gone back
and rechecked everything.

BTW, this is likely why the Germans in Turtledove\'s "World War" books
had their nuke project do a "China syndrome" on them.

Except that you can\'t be certain what stuff worked and what was just
"We\'ll have this real soon now" (like the stuff about nuclear powered
cars in the 50s).

That was my point. You *aren\'t* going to know FOR CERTAIN what the "old
timers" could and couldn\'t do. You\'ll have fact mixed with legend
(after a few generations).

I\'m assuming that the typical "fall" of civilization is a case of slow
decline. First the starships come less often, then they quit. Various
industries that depend on offworld components fail, or drop back to
something that can be supported with local tech. Exporters fail too.
This worsens the depression. By time things level out, a lot of
infrastructure has decayed beyond local capabilities of repair. 

So its not unlikely that it could be decades before they have a stable
economy, and it\'s likely to be several TLs lower. And when they start
working their way back up it could be a couple generations later. And
the folks that knew the "trick" to some of the "lost" tech are all dead.

And don\'t forget that anything depending on imported resources will go
away. Remember, if they imported balonium, then either the local
deposits were too poor to work, or they were "exhausted". That means
that the locals will have a real hard time replacing the imported
material. It could take decades to come up with a replacement or an
economical method of extraction.

Although it would make things /slightly/ more complicated, the system
I mentioned is only necessary for PCMPs.  LAAWs already include rules
for backblasts and flamethrowers have there own special rules in EA.

Wrong.  While lasers may generate detectible levels of kinetic energy,
most of the damage caused by a laser is thermal in nature.

I only agreed that lasers should be limited to a maximum of 3D of
damage because the beam focuses its damage on a small area of the
target for a *very* brief moment.  A powerful enough beam will burn a
finger-sized hole through the unfortunate victim and continue on down
range (to transmit its remaining thermal energy to other targets), all
in a blink of the eye.  Moving the weapon back and forth in an attempt
to play the beam over the target will have essentially no effect,
considering the short lifespan of the beam itself.

Wrong again.  The speed of light is 300,000 km/sec, not 3 km/sec.  A
PCMP operates at velocities much higher than conventional firearms
(FF&S states 8,000 metres per second, or 8 km/sec).  Anything moving
that fast is not going to remain within the target long enough for the
superheated plasma to cause any significant burning-- just like paper
doesn\'t instantaneously ignite (454 degrees Fahrenheit) when quickly
passed over an open flame.  As a comparison, an M-16 has a muzzle
velocity approaching 1 km/sec.

Actually, T4 handles "weapon damage" a bit better than most games.  T4
describes weapons as "having X amount of penetration" and not "causing
X amount of damage".  Conventional weapons are normally judged by how
much of a particular substance that they can penetrate.  Exactly *how*
the substance handles being penetrated is specific to that substance
(ballistic gelatin goes "Glorp!", glass goes "Smash!", and bull
elephants go "Hee Hee... that tickles!").  Greg Porter\'s 3G3 explains
this even better.

A 7.62 NATO round focuses its kinetic energy over a relatively small
area.  Whatever it strikes is forced apart to allow the bullet to pass
through, robbing the projectile of its kinetic energy in doing so.  A
human target can only offer so much resistance to such a projectile,
hence the 3D damage limit.  Obviously, there are exceptions to this
rule, like high calibre weapons.

Lasers deliver thermal energy instead of kinetic energy, but this
energy is still focused over a relatively small area.  The beam
strikes the target and begins to vapourize matter in its path.  The
harder that material is to vapourize, the more energy is drawn out of
the laser beam.  Humans are made up of mostly water, which has a
relatively low vapourization point.  A 5,000J 5mm beam will pass right
through a human being (vapourizing tissue directly in the beam\'s path
while causing additional thermal damage to the surrounding tissue) and
continue on down range.

PCMPs fire very small packets of superheated plasma at extremely high
velocities.  Each plasma packet is self-containing in nature (insert
more high energy physics stuff here) and does not spread out like shot
from a shotgun would.  Since I am not a physics major by any means, I
concede that it is possible that high enough velocities might cause
the "projectile" to literally explode on contact instead of punching a
neat little hole (I believe 5,000 m/s is the threshold for this type
of ballistic behaviour, although I could be wrong).

IMHO, damaging effects that should _not_ be subject to the max 3D
damage rule are projectile weapons whose warheads rely on something
other that raw kinetic energy (high explosives, white phosphorus,
etc.) and continuing effects like acid, fire, and the like.  Beam
lasers, if they existed, would be included also, since a computerized
weapon could dice up a target pretty easily in a 6 second combat turn.

I still prefer to handle PCMPs in the way I previously described since
it doesn\'t involve special rules for specific circumstances.  If you
don\'t want to roll for three different damage types versus an
unprotected target, feel free to simply say "yer dead" (you can also
simply add up all of the dice of damage from the three damage types
and roll them all at once).  Each PCMP in EA is already listed with
penetrating damage and explosive damage.  It doesn\'t take much math to
halve (rounding down) the explosive value to get the "backblast"
damage (you can even write it in using a pencil).

One final thought about the point I raised earlier regarding a PCMP
plasma projectile penetrating battle dress but not being able to
penetrate it a second time (in order to pass through the target):

"PCMPs could include a variable setting that allow them to effectively
adjust the final damage rating of the weapon.  This would be done by
slowing down the escaping plasma so that it did not possess as much
kinetic energy.  An intelligent soldier, aware of the class of armour
his enemy was wearing, could adjust the muzzle velocity of the plasma
so that the amount of kinetic energy falls short of the amount needed
to penetrate the target\'s armour /twice/.  In this way, the soldier
could make sure that after his target\'s armour was initially
penetrated, all of the remaining kinetic energy was passed on to the
wearer (and not out the back of the armour and down range)."

    'body' => '  Ah, a historical topic - what fun.  Despite what has been said on the
list, there was essentially no German nuclear program of any real size.
Regardless of calculations of the amount of fissile material needed, the
real killer for the Germans was the effort needed to separate the isotopes
of Uranium - that\'s a tough job, and even for the United States with lots
of money and nobody bombing the manufacturing plants, very little fissile
material was manufactured.  For example, it now appears that the entire US
stock of atomic weapons in the late 40s and early 50s was measured in the
dozens at most - hardly a big punch.

  Now, this is not to say that the threat of German atomic weapons didn\'t
scare the hell out of the Allies - they spent an enormous amount of time
and resources trying to find out what the Germans were up to.  During and
immediatly after the way, anybody who had worked in physics and spent the
war under Nazi control was questioned intensely.  What surprised the
Americans most was how limited the German program was and how little the
German government had done - the Germans were nowhere near designing a
bomb, let alone making one.

  As for Heisenberg and his fellow German scientists hampering the effort
to build a bomb, this is a very controversial topic.  I am not a
specialist in this field, but I do read the journals that do book reviews
on this area, and I must say there are good arguements on both sides. 
There is enough evidence to construct a case for Heisenberg, but it is not
totally convincing.  In particular, those who see Heisenburg as a commited
German patriot argue that much of what he and others say about resisting
is just talk, stuff made up after the war to defend his reputation.
Frankly, I don\'t know who is right.

  As for the Japanese having the atomic bomb, well, I have never seen
anything in the mainstream historical literature supporting this.  Now,
there was a rather sensational book published in the late 60s or early 70s
(I think) that claimed that not only did the Japanese have an atomic
research program in what is now North Korea (then a Japanese colony), but
that they even detonated a bomb in 1945.  According to the book, the whole
complex was shipped off by the Soviets when they occupied Korea after the
defeat of Japan.

  Frankly, I found the book very hard to believe.  Given the shape of the
Japanese economy in 1944-45, it\'s hard to see where the resources would
come from.  Moreover, given the extreme interest in anything related to
atomic weapons in the last 50 years by historians and popular journalists,
I find it hard to believe nobody else would have mentioned this.  I\'m sure
the Japanese would have had at least a few scientists working in the area,
but a bomb program?  Probably not.  However, I am no expert in this area,
and I would be happy to learn more, so bring on the references.

A few possibilities:

1)A ship "in the wild" is dependent upon its fuel resupply for the raw
materials that life support equipment needs. Just as the great majority
of "Jump Fuel" is not actually fuel, a "fuel purifier" does far more than
crack a little H out of H2O. The various gases, inerts, organics, etc. 
are separated out and shunted into the appropriate stores in the life-
support system. Most of the organics go into the recyclers as glop, 
or "space pudding" as it\'s often known. People relying upon 
wilderness "refuelling" are usually much happier w/ ocean refuelling
over gas giant skimming for that reason; the amount and quality of
organics are much higher, and often a planet w/ water oceans will
have an atmosphere much closer to human norms than that of a 
gas giant, allowing for quicker and easier LS replenishment. Why,
with this capability, do most people pay for LS  rather than just 
scoop it out of the wild? Refined "food" is like refined fuel, it\'s more
reliable, easier on your system than "glop", and much less hazardous
to have delivered by truck than by skimming. In addition:

(my personal favorite:)
2) A large part of the cost of LS is covered by the requirement for
Jump Drug, the generic term for those medicines and supplements 
that are necessary for life in space and particularly Jump Space.
The opening and closing of "bubbles" into J-Space, along with 
what appears to be the psionically active nature of J-Space itself, 
cause instabilities in susceptible individuals that the use of Jump
Drug blunt and negate. This is the cause of "Spacer Sickness" that
is only really seen these days in the occasional Scout who has 
spent a lot of time in the deep frontier, or in the stereotypical 
Belter one usually only sees in TriVid dramas such as BeltWatch
with its occasional "Old Prospector" who has gone looney from
years out in the belt away from Jump Drug. Recent studies by the
Ase Technology Institute (ATI) in its continuing search for the
Unified Handwave Theory have shown promising possible links
between J-Space, and the Inertialess Thrusters and Ultra Heat Sinks
used in many of today\'s craft; helping to explain why "Spacer
Sickness" can occur in individuals who rarely if ever actually
travel in Jump Space. (Sources at the Institute would not comment
on theories common in the popular press that the possible psionic-
active nature of J Space is evidence of it\'s use as a communications
device by the Ancients. "Those theories," one source stated, "are
often put forth by believers in \'Ghost Ships\' run by renegade
computers who roam the space between the stars.")

    'body' => 'I also am in favour of allowing career changes in T4.1, it does seem an
integral part of Traveller character generation.  I would however like
to know Marc\'s reasoning for removing it.  Perhaps if we knew what
effect he was trying to create or prevent we could come up with a good
solution.

My personal guess is that this new development is to stop people
generating characters who have had three or four completely different
careers.  It makes the characters seem unstable and flighty (only IMHO
of course), if everyone engages in career hopping it makes the system
seems a bit unlike reality, if only the occasional character does it
everything is fine.  Furthermore it is not in character for Vilani to be
so flighty and it even make Solomani seem unreliable.

It is probably not necessary to prevent people from changing career, but
merely to discourage them.  There are two ways to do this.  Make staying
in your current career more attractive and make changing career less
attractive/more difficult.

Suggestions -

To encourage characters to remain in career.  Mustering out benefits do
not apply for the first full term, only second and subsequent terms.
This means that to get any benefits you have to stay at least two terms.
For an eight term character who has had three different careers, this
would mean they lose almost half their mustering out benefits.
This is obviously quite a flexible mechanism, if you want greater
encouragement to stay \'in career\', increase the effect to no benefits
for the first two terms, perhaps in combination with an improvement in
the results on the benefits table.  Perhaps you want to accumulate
positive DM to the benefits roll for the number of terms in service (+1
for the first roll, +2 for the second roll).

As a small aside, I\'m uncertain if the rules indicate that you have to
quit your current job before trying to enlist in the next, but a lot of
people seem to think you do.  This does not seem realistic to me.  If I
want to blow off my job pushing a stylus on the merchantman Extreme
Boredom and take up the life of adventure that the Imperial Navy offers
I might just wait until I get accepted before giving my ex-boss the
finger.
Assuming this then one way to make career hopping less likely is to only
allow one enlistment attempt per term for characters currently in
employment. The unemployed (either because they actually quit or because
of injury) can try every six months.


Anbody got any other suggestions?

	Yeah, me too with this. I\'ve got the first 24 issues of White Dwarf, and
they have lots of good Traveller stuff too. Things like the Light Sabre for
Nobles and the adventure "An Alien Werewolf in London" would be well worth
giving a new lease of life to.

There is a problem here - vapourised human is mostly steam, which is 
relatively opaque to most wavelengths, so the laser pulse would be 
adsorbed and dispersed by the steam it had just created. Making a 
hole is also make harder by the velocity of a laser pulse, which is 
over long before the vapourised piece of the poor target has any 
chance to move aside.

 I suspect that laser induced wounds would 
consist of deep pocks blown out of the target, and surrounded by 
burnt and pulversed flesh. High energy lasers would also cause 
explosive tissue damage from the expansion of superheated steam.

X-Ray lasers would do damage in a beam right through the target, and 
I wouldn\'t want to be behind the target, because a lot of the 
energy\'s just going to keep going...

That may be because we haven\'t yet figured out how to break it to you and
your players that they are now probably starring in the far future version
of \'Galligan\'s Island\'. 

Life support mechanisms in Traveller for starships aren\'t simply a matter
of loading a bunch of fresh food into the fridge, topping off thei air
tanks and taking off. Starships have things like adsorption cartriges for
waste products, which are going to be really hard to deal with. I suspect
they\'re disposable, and thus very hard, or impossible to regenerate.

Imagine an activated charcoal canister made of plastic. Regenerating
activated charcoal is relatively simple...you heat it and purge it with
something inert like nitrogen for a time to flush out adsorbed materials.
But if heating it melts the casing, which is critical to a good seal in
the life support system, you start to see the problem.

Basically for life support you need to provide air, water, temperature
control and, to a lesser extent, food for a minimum of two weeks.

Temperature\'s easy, as is water (in fact water won\'t be a problem that
way...it\'ll be a problem in the other way...there\'ll be too much of it!).
Air is another thing entirely. It\'s not enough to simply provide oxygen;
you have to dispose of the CO2 (mainly) that humans generate. In normal
space this is easy...you simply vent atmosphere continuously, provided you
gan generate enough oxygen. That part is simple given electric power and
water. In jump space you can\'t vent it.

Humans also generate water as a byproduct of metabolism. This cranks the
humidity. This plays hob with the electronics aboard a starship, not a
good thing. More than likely, a dehumidifier is a permanent built in part
of the ship\'s ventilation system, so that\'s not a big problem, as long as
you have power.

What I would do in this situation is see if we can rig up, or use a
respirator that feeds O2 and regulates how much of the \'outside\' air you
breathe for each person on board ship. The regulator is the tricky part,
because as CO2 levels rise in the ship, less outside air can be allowed
in.

This will be a good thing...because after two weeks of this the air is
going to stink, really bad. 

For a good example of what this will be like for the PC\'s, read up on
running deep in WWI and WWII submarines.

Finaly, a wild card...There are probably toxic gases and other products
given off by starship machinery under the best of conditions that need
adsorbtion. Under conditions where they\'re not being adsorbed, and neither
are the various trace organics that humans give off, there will be ample
opportunity for all sorts of compunds to be sysnthesized in the atmosphere
of the ship. Energy sources abound: lights, hot surfaces, electric arcs.
You could end up with an interesting \'soup\' for an atmosphere.

All this organic matter floating around, coupled with bad or missing air
filters means molds. They can bring an even more interesting bit to the
party...what if your players start inhaling molds related to, ohhh, say,
rye musts. You know, the ones that produce ergotamine. heh heh heh. To
coin a phrase...what a long strange trip it\'ll be.

And whatever you do, don\'t let the PC\'s eat beans!! ;-)

Why? I\'m talking specifically about vacc suits. Why does having
a TL-14 vacc suit depend on having Jump-4? My point is that TL is largely
defined by what level of Jump a given society/culture/empire has reached,
which really makes no comment whatsoever on how advanced their vacc suits
are.

I don\'t remember seeing anywhere in the "Traveller Canon", of which I consider
myself a student, that says "a planet/empire/whatever may not have 
any items more than one level above their current TL". As a matter of fact,
the MT WBH states the exact opposite. According to the WBH, a planet may
have a specific niche where the niche TL is up to two (maybe more, I don\'t have
my WBH handy) levels higher than the planet\'s "overall" TL.

This is my basic argument - The RoM was, overall, TL-12. I don\'t debate
that. it is possible, however, even if it didn\'t necessarily happen,
that some planets/systems/mega-corps/naval research labs/etc could
have gotten up to TL-13 or 14 in very narrow fields, like the vacc suit.

You asked before why I\'m trying so hard to justify what\'s generally considered
an error or simply sloppy writing in that the adventure in Anomolies
contains a TL-14 vacc suit, which disrupts "canon". I\'m not really
trying to justify or defend that. I think that it was a bad idea
to put that sort of thing in a published adventure, not to mention
unrealistic, as nothing would be likely to be workable after all that
time (but who knows).

I do think, however, that in general it\'s conceivable that the RoM
could have built a few Tl-13 or 14 vacc suits in its day. I think a
more realistic adventure hook would be for the players to track down
semi-functional or broken artifacts, to be sold to people who could
analyze them (and hey, maybe they\'d work a little bit, kinda, sometimes...)
and turn a profit. Apparently somewhere in T4 (I don\'t know where,
but someone else here mentioned it) it states that a number of 
Zunhastu "new inventions" are based on recovered technology. Who\'s to say
that there isn\'t a plan for a TL-22 vacc suit, sitting on a desk in a
blow-out lab on some tiny vacuum world, finished only moments before
the airlock blew out when a ship full of nasty ol\' pirates came
crashing in, looking for loot?

Besides, worse things have happened in "canon". The adventure in the Droyne
module featured a psionic disentegrator gun. "Nail Mission" had 
TL-16 spinal mount disentegrators. If anything, the adventure in Anomolies
suffers from being unoriginal (sorry, Steve) more than being canon-breaking.

I don\'t understand what this means.

Well, sure. I never said they were "mass-produced" though. And again,
I don\'t see how having even mass-produced TL-14 vacc suits is dependent
on having Jump-5 and other TL-14 technologies.

Harold, I understand your feelings. I too have been playing Traveller
for a long time. I have no desire to drive anyone apart. I do think
that the Traveller universe is a big place, with a lot of possibilities
to justify a lot of seemingly strange things. As much as I lament it,
over time more and more conflicts are going to creep into the "canon".
FF&S has no provision for solar-powered jump drives, jump torpedoes
or any of the other strange things that have popped up in adventures
over the years. It\'s not the end of the world.

I look at the whole TL-14 vacc suit thing as a point-of-view thing
more than anything. Remember when Rats&Cats appeared (well, actually, I don\'t,
but I own a copy now) and it changed the Aslan from a major race to a
minor race? Well, it did kind of. It depends on who you ask. Do the
vacc suits in Anomolies have "TL-14" stitched on the left shoulder?
Who says they\'re TL-14? What exactly separates a TL-14 vacc suit
from a TL-12 or 13 one, specifically?? (Please, don\'t just repeat that
it needs a TL-whatever manufacturing base - what are the physical
differences between two suits of different TLs?) Do you actually have 
the players, in character, walk around saying that this hand blender
is TL-6 versus that TL-8 one? I doubt that anything less than a 
long inspection by some with Vacc Suit-3+ would be able to even
tell that a vacc suit is really TL 14 as opposed to TL 12.

Personally, while I don\'t like disturbing "canon", that\'s what\'s
kept Traveller fresh and new over its long life, when it\'s been
done well. (Not all "canon bashing" is good by any means).

Like it or not Harold, the neighbourhood has to get re-paved and get
new sidewalks once in a while. Shops come and go. Change doesn\'t
only mean bad change, there\'s a lot of good change too.

I don\'t see my position as attempting to "present a fig leaf to cover
for the apparent error". I see the "apparent error" as a springboard
to look further into the structure of the RoM and to toy with player\'s
minds when they discover the TL-14 vacc suit isn\'t quite so self-sealing
as it was a few thousand years ago...

Didn\'t someone write an article on how Traveller technology must
be semi-self repairing in order for bizzare "canon" statements like
having ancient machinery in nearly perfect working order to be true?

Anyways, maybe that\'s the miracle of TL-12+, Though, I should be
quick to say, it is by no means canon, nor is it very "hard" science.

Also, most of the planets in question have been high tech for _millenia_
by now. Easily worked deposits of ores and metals are flat out _gone_.
Probably as \'early\' as the end of the Ziru Sirrka, most medium to large
population planets in Vilani space had been mined out long ago. Without a
source of metals, you ain\'t gonna rebuild squat, folks, not if your TL
ever goes below 5 or 6 or so, the raw materials of that high tech society
are simply not available.

I\'m including recovering and recycling old waste piles in mining, as well.
Any metals left on these planets are in extremely low grade ores or deep
in the core.

    'body' => 'Dear Folks -

In digest 1539, Peter Miller <pmiller@linkeasy.net> asked:

>1)  Does the IISS have a motto? If so what is it?
My "little black books" don\'t mention a motto. Make one up, in accordance
with the prime mission of the IISS: the expansion of the empire.

>2)  What colour is the IISS sunburst?  When was this logo adopted?
a. Red. b. Presumably at the Imperium\'s foundation. The original banner was
"golden yellow sunburst against a black background, representing Capital\'s
type G star against dark space". This was changed to have "no official
colour" when the Eliyoh (a nonhuman minor race) joined the Imperium, but the
services retained their variant colours. [MT-PLAYERS, 1120]

>3)  WHen did Sylea become known as Capital?
"Capital was originally called Sylea, but its name was changed upon the
founding of the Third Imperium".[ADV-2, 1106; ADV-3, 1106; SUPP-8, 1107]

>4)  What is the major city on Sylea?
In 1104, the major cities are:
        Benca   c. 6 billion, class A starport
        Cleon   c. 4 billion, class A starport (Cleon Starport)
        Mifa Lanco      c 3 billion, class A starport
        Turthu  c. 9 billion, class B starport
        Ton Vorn        c. 5 billion, class A starport (orbital complex)
I would assume that Cleon was originally called something else.
Interestingly, it may not ever have been the biggest city. Maybe the
nobility lived here, and their larger dwellings made the city less populated.
The Imperial Palace and Moot Spire are located in Cleon. The original palace
"was begun in -7 and completed in -5 under the direction of Cleon I, the
founder of the Third Imperium. Like many similar structures of the time it
served not only as a home for the Imperial Family, but also as a military
fortress. Like a young mountain range, the palace was a collection of slopes
and angled surfaces jutting sharply into the sky. The complex had few
entrances, all of which were very low to the ground and, like much of the
building, covered with upward-pointing spikes. This shocking architecture
served the very basic purpose of making it difficult for attacking
grav-troopers to obtain entrance or even to find a safe perch." It still
stands in the Imperial Park as a tourist monument.[DIGEST-9, 1116]

>5)  What are two spaceports on Sylea?
See question 4, then make it up. The text accompanying the pic of Sylea\'s
orbital port indicates that only one starport exists in Mileau 0. Maybe one
or two spaceports exist as noble\'s playthings or private \'ports.

>6)  Does the IISS have any decorations?  If so, what?
_Scouts and Assassins_ suggests the following:
The "official" uniform of the Scouts is a dull black coverall made from
finely-woven ballistic cloth, black knee-high leather boots, a black cap,
and the insignia. The insignia is a stylised, silver, winged serpent on a
circular background. The colour of the circle denotes the pay grade. It is
worn as a patch on the left shoulder and as a belt buckle, which serves as
an ID using micro-circuitry. The insignia is also worn by "retired" Scouts.

_S&A_ also suggests that wounded Scouts receive the Silver Asteroid (SA),
that carries a monthly stipend of Cr200 - but you must pick up the money
from a Scout base each month, or lose it... causing the award to become
known as the "Tin Hemmorrhoid".

Then again, _S&A_ Scouts receive awards: the Citation for Meritorious
Conduct (CMC, Silver Comet for Gallantry (SCG), and Silver Starburst for
Exemplary Service (SSES) as well. These are equivalent to the MCUF, MCG, and
SEH.

>7)  What is the extent (ie. into what sectors) of the Imperium in 33?

21      Cleon II born
33      ?
50      Zho contact with Imperial traders
53      Cleon I dies, Cleon II ascends throne
54      Cleon II abdicates in favour of Artemsus Lentuli
60      Spinward Marches colonised
76      Pacification Campaigns
175     Julian War
c.200   Imperium expands towards Aslan territory in Reaver\'s Deep
220     Vargr Campaigns
380     Peace of Ftahalr ends Aslan Border Wars, establishes Imperial-Aslan
border
[MT-ENCYC, 1116]

Based on this and the hints in Mileau 0, make an educated guess.

That\'s an interesting question. That depends on what you subscribe to as
"canon."

Pre-TNE canon indicates that starships had a lanthanum grid over their
entire hulls that enabled ships to enter jump space. The material contained
within the grid was the material that was placed into jump space.

Though IIRC, TNE never printed anything that indicated as much, I once had
a phone conversation with Dave Nilsen at GDW in which he described some
changes to the theories of jump drive that are worth discussion:

1) That instead of the grid dictating what gets taken into jump, the
astrogator dictates what is included in the jump envelope. Therefore, if
say, a 600-ton ship tractors in a 200-ton ship and latches onto it, the
600-ton ship can then program a jump envelope that includes *both* ships.
The jump must be calculated based on the combined volume of the two ships,
however. Therefore, using the 600-ton ship\'s jump drive, the maximum
allowable jump would be based on the idea that the two conjoined starships
comprised an "800-ton ship."

Now, this was never printed, so for all intensive purposes, it ain\'t canon.
Therefore, if you want to stick with canon, lanthanum grids are still in
existence. By extrapolation of these ideas, however, you could have the
600-ton ship sync up with the computers of the 200-ton ship after the two
have been physically attached and make the 600-ton ship activate *both*
ships\' jump drives simultaneously, thereby activating both lanthanum grids
at the same time and then jumping together.

Basically, the "jump envelope" theory gives you more freedom since you jump
a selected volume of material that includes your starship. In any event, it
seems you have to be quite close to the captured ship or other object
(meteorite, satellite, or whatever) that you want to take with you.

2) While Dave\'s other theory is less germaine to this discussion, it\'s
worth mentioning. He also said that based on the facing of the jumping
ship, another ship either in visual range or with a sensor lock on the
jumping ship, could determine approximately *where* the jumping ship is
going. For example, my ship has a sensor lock on a ship in Usani system
that is making a jump to Deneb system. Based on the facing and other
characteristics of that ship, I can determine that the ship is jumping to
Deneb. I would suggest that a difficult Astrogation roll is made or some
other method is used to make this determination, however.

Having roleplayed MegaTraveller in Massilia and Diaspora sectors, I can say
that there were a *lot* of TL-16 worlds out there. TL-15 would have been
more the norm for top-of-the-line Imperial Navy ships, but yes, there would
have been a fair number of TL-16 ships out there, many of which could have
tractor beams or manipulators.

>3) Suggest a good approximate toughness value for asteroid \'rock\' material

This hasn\'t come up for me, but I would take out my old CT "Fighting Ships"
supplement, take a look at the relative toughness of the asteroid hull
described therein compared with a typical navy ship in the same book and
determine the toughness from comparing the two.

Not a bad idea, but I\'m content with Virus the way it is, so I\'m probably

The Navy uses a yellow sunburst.  The IISS sunburst is red, and the Army is
black on a red field.  The different colors for branch sunbursts came in
after 247, when it was declared that the symbol, not the color, mattered.

The "poni express" symbol wasn\'t adopted until the X-boat network was
started in 624.

  About three years ago there was an article in Military History magazine
which discussed the Japanese atomic program.  As I recall, the article
stated that the Japanese scientists had a fairly solid theoretical
background for the bomb, but the program was badly underequipped,
understaffed and underfunded, and was unable to produce much in terms of
solid nuclear material or prototypes.  The program was more or less halted
in early 1945; one of the scientists interviewed talked about his reaction
upon hearing about Hiroshima.  He was apparently one of the few people in
Japan who actually understood what had happened.  I recall the article had
a small sidebar about the German nuclear program, which mentioned the
Heisenberg sabotage claim; the Germans got a bit further with producing
nuclear material, but they were also effectively out of resources by late
1944.

  I\'l  root around in my magazine collection, but I don\'t think I have the
issue any more.  I\'m fairly sure it was from 1994 or 1995 (maybe on the
50th anniversary of Hiroshima?).

No, it won\'t get dragged at all, unless they\'re almost (or actually) in
physical contact with one another; in that case, the jumping ship will
almost certainly misjump (being within 10 diameters of the other ship),
and the \'towed\' ship might very convceivably lose a chunk of its hull and
perhaps some internal fittings, sliced away into jump by the first ship\'s
jump bubble.

Note that if the towed ship is both in contact with the towing ship, *and*
very, very much smaller than the towing ship, this might conceivably work
OK as a sort of impromptu \'carried craft in a grapple\' trick.

There were several TL 16 worlds in and near the late 3I.  No TL 16
equipment had become a standard part of Imperial government-operated
starships, however, so the towing ship would have to be a prototype, or of
private manufacture.

My copy of FFS is at home, so I can\'t give you a number, but I\'d suggest
that a nickel-iron asteroid would have toughness rougly 1/5 to 1/2 that of
steel.

This would make more sense from a raw plausibility perspective, certainly;
however, it would violate TNE canon history as to documented Virus
propagation methods.  Whether you\'re willing to toss some canon to gain
credibility is a question for you and your campaign.

There, was that value-neutral enough? :)

BTW, different topic, would anyone on the list be interested in an M:1200

Sorry, my latin sucks, but the feeling I want to get is "Sending the poor

Ok, Ok, it\'s probably not the OFFICIAL motto, but it probably IS the most

KE = 0.5mv^2 does not work for photons; the m in that equation is rest
mass, which is zero for photons.  A photon\'s energy is given by E = h nu,
where h is Planck\'s constant and nu is the photon\'s frequency.

If you\'re claiming that lasers do damage by directly apply kinetic energy
to the target (in the way bullets do), you\'re *very* wrong.  The KE
transfer from laser energy itself is miniscule for any reasonably sized
weapon laser.  Lasers do damage by superheating their target point, which
flashes explosively to vapor, damaging surrounding armor, tissue, or
whatever.  This explosion may in turn have a noticeable rocket effect,
blowing the target backward, but that\'s an indirect rather than a direct
effect of the laser.

Wow, and I thought *I* was slowing down lately. :)  That figure is low by
a factor of 100,000 -- c = 3e8 m/s = 3e5 km/s.

Absolutely.  And it\'s surprising how much such equipment you can fit into
a tiny space, with ingenuity.  One of those multi-exercise Nautilus
machines gives a good example of how many different ways you can use one
smallish steel frame with a few pads, levers, weights, and pulleys.

Cats became traditional aboard ship partly in order to keep rat and mouse
populations under control -- a role which they (or a small dog, say a
terrier or the like) could also be valuable performing aboard a starship.
You\'d have to worry about their dying from eating a poisonous alien pest,
though.

BTW, the movie _Crimson Tide_ (which I recommend, btw) features a small
(and highly obnoxious) dog aboard a US missile submarine; while boomers
are bigger by far than the typical PC group\'s ship, it does provide a nice
illustration of what having a dog aboard ship would be like.

There\'s also a 1950s (or maybe 60s?) SF story called "Allamagoosa" which
prominently features a dog aboard a naval starship, used specifically for
pest control.  I *think* Frederic Brown wrote it, but that\'s a bit hazy in
my memory.  In any case, it\'s a great story, and a good humorous adventure
idea for in-service navy campaigns.

Well, I am not much of a student of Vilani culture, but I have read
a few works that most Solomani consider seminal in the field. To
better describe the exact type of mentality seen among the Vilani that
I am attempting to describe, let me quote from "A Lieutenant\'s Diary 
- - a Journal by Lajos Henry", a somewhat distant (future) relative 
of mine.

I will sum up some of the beginning of the book to bring readers
who aren\'t familiar with this work up to speed, then I will quote
what I feel are relevant passages.

Lajos Henry was an ambitious lieutenant with the Terran Navy during
the period of the Nth Interstellar Wars. He turned 24 within days
of the Vilani High Command\'s formal surrender to Admiral Hiroshi
Estigarribia.

After the Vilani surrender, Terran officers were dispatched to every 
corner of the Ziru Sirka, to administer the hand-over of power to
the Terrans. Please, keep in mind that at this point, the Vilani
have ruled their interstellar empire for thousands of years, while
the Terrans have only had jump drive for 400 years. Many mistakes
were made...

from p.95:
"As we came out of jump, I was edgy and nervous. I could hardly
even sit still. I paced the ship, wondering how I had arrived
in this system, to take command of the system\'s mainworld  starport 
and, by extension, the whole of the system."

Lieutenant Henry is put in charge of a large, busy system, with a 
massive highport, through which hundreds of vessels move every day,
shifting cargoes, fueling and conducting day to day business. 
Though it is likely that a mistake has been made, putting a 24-year 
old Lieutenant in charge of a port bigger than anything that Terra has
ever built, the distance from Terran High Command makes it impossible
to correct.

Several months after assuming command of the highport, a POW ship 
arrives in-system, from p.212:
\'When the POW ship docked at one of the security rings,
I had no idea what to expect. I knew the ship was commanded by
an Admiral Singh, but I did not know the purpose of unloading the
prisoners here. As the iris opened, a pair of armed, but rather
relaxed looking marines stepped out, followed by a line of
twenty men, two abreast. They were wearing plain, unmarked blue
jumpers. But they weren\'t behaving like prisoners - they smiled, 
looked well-fed and even talked amonst themselves as they were
brought into the security atrium. The Admiral followed the group
and approached me. "Have twenty stateroom prepared for these
man. Put two Terran guards on each door. Assign a junior officer
to each prisoner to look after his needs". Admiral Singh turned to 
walk back to the ship. I was stunned - staterooms for prisoners?
Officers to attend to their needs? "Admiral?" It was all I could
bring myself to say. The Admiral turned and looked at me. "You don\'t
know who these men are, do you?" I shook my head dumbly. The men
chuckled amongst themselves. The Admiral pointed at one of them -
"You, Vilisharuui", he said, actually managing to pronounce the
twisted Vilani name, "How many men like Lieutenant Henry did you
command?" The man looked thoughtful for a moment. "None. I had
twelve thousand, 6 hundred Lieutenants under my command, but 
none like this man. Not one of them would question an order I gave".
The Admiral approached me again, "These men are twenty of the 
highest commanders of the Ziru Sirka, each one of whome commanded
more men than Terra has ever sent into space. You will given them 
the respect the deserve. Follow my orders, Lieutenant." He turned
and marched briskly back to his ship. It was several minutes
before I could move again to follow his orders.

....

That night, the Admiral came to visit me in my room, to brief me on
how to handle situations that he had seen occuring on other worlds,
where the new Terran rule was causing problems. I asked him how
I was to command these strange people, who looked like us, but were
so alien and unpredictable. "The Vilani, unpredictable?" He scoffed.
"No, the Vilani are many things, but never unpredictable." With that,
he took a piece of paper from my desk, wrote on it, then sealed it
in an envelope. He put the envelope on the table that sat between us.
"I have a job for you. A ship has come into orbit with a leaky
fission pile. It is on a course that will bring it right into the
station. You can\'t destroy it, because the radiation would seriously
harm the planet below. Don\'t even try to think of a solution.
Go ask each of the Vilani Admirals, in turn, what they would do.
Do not make it seem a game." He looked serious suddenly - "Make it
seem as if it were life or death. For even though there is no ship,
for you, that is what it spells. I will be sick for the rest of 
the evening. I will see you at breakfast". With that he left me
and I set to my task.

....

I went to the quarters of the first Vilani, the man Vilisharuui
Admiral Singh had talked to in the security atrium. He greeted me
politely and as I told him of my story, he listened intently and
with great gravity. He pondered the problem for a few moments
and then laid out a plan for me, talking all the while about
priorities, "the people" and using other such broad terms. I had no
doubt in my mind that the plan would work, without any undue risk.
I left his room and went to the next Vilani and the next... as I
left the room of the fifth man, I was growing tired, but that was
nothing next to my confusion. Each man had, in turn, listened to my
problem, thought and given me his solution. Each time, the 
solution had been exactly the same. There were no differences,
in strategy, tactics, or in the "priorities" each one gave.

....

By the next morning, I had gotten no sleep. I had talked to twenty
men and received the same solution twenty times. I showered, put
on my best dress uniform and went to join them and the Admiral 
for breakfast. I entered the room and without saying anything else,
I stood at the end of the long mess table and accused them all -
"You have had your sport of me. I thought that I was to learn,
but to you, it\'s just a big joke. And you, Admiral, going along
with it." They all looked at me with confusion on their faces. 
They had no idea what I was talking about. "Did you open the 
envelope?" asked the Admiral. I had, it contained the exact 
same plan that had been laid out by each of the Vilani. I 
thought that it was surely a trick played on me, for being 
so arrogant as to assume I could command this whole station. 
"We have been talking with the Admiral this very morning of 
his lesson for you". It was Vilisharuui. "But it was no 
trick. We knew nothing of it." "What else could it be? 
You all gave the same answer?" I asked, my face 
feeling as if it was growing as confused as theirs. 
"How do you think?" he replied. "We are trained men. We 
understand what is important. We know what we would 
want the Admirals to do if we were labourers working
on the ground. We know what must be done to assure the saftey
of not only the station, but of every Vilani -", he paused, "
and Terran in the highport." But they had all given the same
answer, how could this be, I asked. "How could it not be?" he 
countered. How could you run an empire if you had no idea how 
your subordinates act? How can you be an Lieutenant 
if you did not know what your Admiral needs of you? 
How can the Admiral make decisions of he does not know 
what your decisions will be? We train ourselves.
We know what to do. The Vilani are people of the Stars, not of
the earth and travel between the stars is slow. We must know,
there is no other way."

I droped into the seat beneath me, uable to hold myself up
any longer. The lack of sleep now began to eat into me. After
a minute, I stood up and left the room, without a word, or even
a salute to the Admiral. I had entered into a room that was,
I though, full of men like myself. I left, leaving behind me
strange aliens."


Well, although it is a long excerpt, I hope it makes a bit
clearer what I was getting at. The Vilani do not have a 
dictatorial power structure, yet the very nature of their 
society makes them act in a way that seems "forced" to most
Solomani. It has enabled them to efficiently rule a large
interstellar empire, but the notions of priorities are slow
to change in the Vilani. Combining these strong social
drives with the Ziru Sirka\'s "Shadow Emperors", Terrans
have a tendancy to describe the Vilani power structure as 
one that is very top-down, when yes, I agree, it is in fact,
quite the opposite. I am glad we\'ve been able to clear things
up somewhat.

The above is what I wanted to establish as having been on record for
"saying" at the start.

Now that we have compiled this info, I want to be on record for a few
things.

   While we have done our best to properly quote and document the
   sources we used, our quoting should be in NO WAY a challenge to
   the copyright of the companies and individuals who may hold the
   copyright on these materials.

   This aspect of the research came from the start of a discussion over
   a year ago on the manipulator mailing list (a mailing list I started
   to discuss HIWG Quadrant IV issues due to the announcement of Milieu
   Zero (O) being the "new direction" of things to come in the game).

   The conversations were cut short due to one participant\'s insistence
   on the Rule of Man having been unequivocly TL 12.  Now the whole story
   can be told.

   It was suggested here that I am stirring up a "canon" debate on
   TML again--that is the farthest from what I wanted to do, but then
   that is not always in my control.  On that subject, what I do want
   to still say is that fragmentary quoting of sources can lead to
   very myopic views of what is in print.  That is why I avoided a
   trickling of quoting sources and discussing them one at a time,
   without any high level view.

   We have excluded T4 references, not for any dislike of the product,
   but because we felt it necessary to defend T4 not on what T4 says,
   but what the past has "said".  In fact, we are _very_ pleased that
   T4 has stayed as true to the game as they have.

   Nor would we want any "canon" debate to restrict what those writing
   for T4 are doing.  It is a little difficult to revise Traveller in
   light of twenty years experience if your hands are tied that way.
   We have included one quote below as the exception that proves the
   rule.

   Reading over the Robots history allows one to conclude that there
   was a misfire on the publication of sources with essays, but as I
   recall, one of the complaints the "early" Digest Group had was not
   having all of the sources we do.

   Our research was not to prove finally, once and for all what the
   Tech Level of the Rule of Man was, but to thoroughly document the
   sources that reinforced some ideas.  It will be the job of the
   writer of (future) Traveller materials to synthesize this into
   material that we all know and love.

   Finally, we stand resolved to not always in the future, provide
   this form of complete documentation.  It just so happened that
   enough of a trail had been prepared, that it only took us a few
   hours to put this all together.  I\'ve learned that some on TML
   want you to put your quotes where your mouth is.  I guess I\'ll
   have to say, that in the future (if I post here), you\'ll just have
   to trust me, because I won\'t always have the luxury of time to
   "prove" what I said was the truth.  At the same time, I\'ll try
   to coin any posts carefully enough so as to not spark the emotional
   response I first received to my statements.

   A few references have been pointed out (not yet confirmed) that
   suggest a lower tech level for the Rule of Man or Terra.  The
   purpose of _this_ post is to point out the _volume_ of evidence
   that says the contrary.  We have not even touched on the Darrians
   or Sword Worlds, as they are not in our current rimward focus,
   though at my suggestion, many references were found supporting a
   basic hypothesis:  Terra was beyond TL12!  Reading these facts in
   that context may be enlightening if you are willing to consider.
   Any final work will have to reconcile all of the evidence.

   I am _not_ out to offend.  I do enjoy discussing this game, something
   I\'ve done with Marc and other friends over the years.  What I have
   to get used to, is doing it on TML, which compares with no other
   mailing list I have ever belonged.


THE "UPLIFT"

  MT Referee\'s Companion, pg.32 - Medical Technology

    TL14 "Genetic Engineering techniques culminate in the creation of
    altered, \'improved\' life forms, including sentients.

  CT Journal of the Travellers\' Aid Society #6, - Dolphins

    "When humanity left the cradle of Terra, numerous other forms went
    along.  ...  Scientists settled on using the Atlantic bottle-nosed
    dolphin, enhanced by genetic engineering (or "geneering") to create
    a new and hardier species (T. galactis) as a partner to human
    settlers of these worlds."

  MT Travellers\' Digest #13, pg. 15 - Dolphins
  
    "The Solomani in turn have brought the sciences of genetic
    manipulation and engineering (often called simply \'geneering\')
    to levels undreamt of in the Third Imperium or Zhodani Consulate.
    In addition, no other known major or minor race can match the
    achievements of Terran scientists in such matters.  (The Ancients,
    while no longer extant, were at their heyday an obvious exception
    to this claim.)

    "The first wide scale use of these technologies occured early in
    the Terran 22nd century (roughly -2400 by the Imperial calendar).
    ... In order to promote their colonization, the Solomani government
    established a semi-autonomous foundation known as GenAssist which
    was charged with the adaptation of native Terran lifeforms to 
    alien climates.  ...  Over the next several decades, under the
    guidance of Dr. Craig Carbone and, later, Dr. Victor Haerinck,
    modifications were made to the brains of several Terran lifeforms.
    By far the most sucessful of these were the improvements made to
    various cetacean races.  ...  With the full attention of the
    GenAssist sophontology program focused upon them, the Dolphins
    achieved true intelligence, and in -1988, just prior too the
    collapse of the Rule of Man, a handful of dolphin colonies were
    seeded along the rimward frontiers of what is now the Solomani
    Sphere."

  MT Solomani & Aslan, pg.17 - The Politics of Race [c.1120 Imperial date]

    "Geneered Solomani are the result of DNA manipulation or eugenic 
    breeding.  In some cases, colonists were modified for life in
    hostile environments; in others attempts were made to breed
    \'improved\' humans.  Even today, the Ministry of Genetics experiments
    with human geneering, but most geneered Solomani are the result of
    programs instituted centuries ago.  ...  Our scientists have raised
    over twenty species to sentience through genetic manipulation and
    controlled breeding."

    On pg. 20, there is a lengthy piece about Terran Confederation
    era " \'tuber\' colonies" and the aspects required to colonize hostile
    worlds.  Too much to quote here, but it clearly sets the tone that
    the above stated TL14 was clearly UNSCA (pre-Terran Confederation) 
    era available technology.  The intro to the Dolphins article in the
    JTAS issues (in fewer words) parallels the S&A reference to \'tuber\'
    colonies and hints at the same timeframe for Dolphins (and others)
    joining man into space.


TERRAFORMING

  MT Referee\'s Companion, pg. 31-32 - Environmental Engineering Technology

    TL12 "Major terraforming projects covering thousands of square
    kilometers become commonplace.  Significant advances in global weather
    control help make such terraforming projects possible."

      [Note that typical planets measure surface area in the millions,
       tens of millions, and hundreds of millions of square kilometers.
       At best this is one one thousandth of the surface, and is rooted
       in the basics of weather control. To claim that TL12 terraforming
       can accomplish TL16 terraforming feats, is like saying that cloud-
       seeding (TL8) weather control can do the job of global weather
       control (i.e. storm dissapation/prevention) at TL12.]

    TL13-14 - no terraforming mentioned

    TL15 "Complex terraforming involving an entire hemisphere becomes
    commonplace."

    TL16 "Global terraforming becomes commonplace, allowing substantial
    improvements in a world with an unfavorable global environment.  For
    example, transforming a world with an insidious atmosphere to a world
    with a standard atmosphere is globabl terraforming."

    TL17 "Total terraforming appears at Tech level 17 and beyond.  Total
    terraforming involves complete transformation of a world\'s basic
    environment to a radically different basic environment of one\'s
    choosing.  For example, transforming a barren vacuum world to a lush,
    rich world with a dense atmosphere is total terraforming."

  MT World Builder\'s Handbook, pg. 55 - Atmospheric Terraforming
  
    "Atmospheric terraforming refers to significant improvements in the
    world\'s original composition by its inhabitants.  This type of
    terraforming is the most difficult and requires the highest tech
    level; it is not surprising, then, that it is also the least common.

    If atmospheric terraforming has been conducted on the world, the old
    original atmosphere can be determined if desired.  The atmospheric
    terraforming progression, from the best atmospheric conditions to
    the worst, is untainted, tainted, exotic, corrosive, and insidious."

      [Atmospheric Terraforming is consistent with TL16 Global
       terraforming, MT RC.]
  
  MT World Builder\'s Handbook, pg. 90 - Terraforming
  
    "If a world has conducted terrain terraforming, one or more hexes
    have had their terrain type modified.  The most common type of terrain
    terraforming is to improve desert terrain into arable land (clear or
    settled) for agricultural use.  The types of terrain terraforming
    include:  from desert to prarie; from prarie to clear; from clear to
    wooded; from wooded to forest; from forest to rainforest; from rain-
    forest to forest; from forest to wooded; from wooded to clear; from
    clear to prarie (accidental); and from prairie to desert (accidental).

    "Given sufficient time, the terraforming can include more than one
    level of transformation.  An extreme (and rare) example of this would
    be to terraform desert into rainforest over a period of time.

    "The extent of the terraforming (how many hexes it includes) is up to
    the one mapping the world.  Higher tech level terraforming (tech level
    12+) tends to be more extensive."

      [It should be noted that the above examples clearly state that while
       the level of terraforming is a function of time and desire, the
       area effected is a function of tech level, thus TL12 is clearly
       able to effect only a few hexes (1-2) at best, and greater areas 
       require greater tech levels.  Note that the four examples that
       we provide here are all cases of the more extreme atmospheric
       terraforming, which is still higher yet.  The Sahara could have
       been accomplished somewhere in the range of TL13-15, but Terra,
       Mars, Hephaistos, and Ishimshulgi all required the TL16+ to
       succeed (or not succeed).]

  MT Solomani & Aslan, pg. 5 - Terra

    "Visitors to humaniti\'s homeworld leave with the impression that no
    other world could ever compare with the homeworld of our race.  The
    scars of past disasters have healed, and today, Terra is one, great
    garden.  We have made Africa\'s great northern desert, the Sahara,
    into a multi-million-hectare farmland, tended by skilled robotic care.
    Our Reforestation projects have restored the rain forests and jungles
    of South America, Africa, and southern Asia.  We have even made the
    cool Siberian plains greener than at any other time in history.

    "Terra\'s current status as a global park belies its sore shape during
    the early days of star travel.  Atmospheric pollution threatened to
    ruin our world\'s climate.  Industrial smog became such a problem
    that we built domes to enclose several cities in North America and
    Europe.  Thoughtless methods of agriculture turned once-fertile lands
    to barren flats.  Extinctions reached a peak unseen in millions of
    years.

    "Yet, we accepted our responsibility, just in time to save the tottering
    ecology.  Only the ocean level--standing 15 meters above its pre-jump
    height--and coastal outlines survive as reminders of the damage we once
    wrought by our own hands."

      [Removing taints count as global atmospheric terraforming.]

  CT Supplement 10: The Solomani Rim, pg. 38

    "Hephaistos is one of the few completed terraforming projects in the
    Imperium.  Begun during the Interstellar Wars, the project was
    abandoned and resumed several times.  The project was completed by
    the Hephaistos Company, chartered by the [Third, LG] Imperium in 632.
    The planet was opened in 835, and sections were sold to several
    colonizing groups.  Although the project is officially complete, the
    company is still engaged in work to reduce the ocean and atmosphere."

      [Note that Hephaistos is a size 9, atm 8 (dense), waterworld.]

  CT Alien Module 6: Solomani, pg. 21 [slighty different]

    "Hephaistos is one of the few terraforming projects completed by the
    Imperium.  Begun during the Interstellar Wars, the project was
    alternately abandoned and resumed several times.  The project was
    finally completed by the Hephaistos Company, chartered by the
    [Third, LG] Imperium in 632, and the planet was opened in 835 and
    sections were sold off to several colonial groups.  Although the
    project is officially complete, work still proceeds to reduce and
    fine-tune the ocean and atmosphere."

  MT Solomani & Aslan, pg. 5 - The Outer System [of Sol]
  
    "Terraforming began to change the red face of arid Mars 700 years
    ago.  The planet\'s thickening atmosphere now sports a much higher
    ratio of oxygen to carbon dioxide, and we hope to see actual rain
    within the next century.  With the return of our Solomani citizens,
    GenAssist has promised to speed completion of the terraforming
    effort."
    
      [Note that by Traveller atmospheric pressure tables (TNE) that
       Mars in 1997 AD has a trace atmosphere (UWP = 1), primarily
       Carbon Dioxide.  Scouts and S&A say that the atmosphere is
       UWP =3.  The size code for Mars is 4.]


  MT Travellers\' Digest #13, pg. 31 - Library Data of the Solomani Rim

    "This world used to have a thin atmosphere and a few oceans, before
    the Terran corporation GenAssist attempted improvements.

    "Several centuries ago, the corporation attempted to \'encourage\' a
    native lifeform which fixed nitrogen into the soil for use by the
    local plants.  The lifeform was not widespread or prolific, and
    corporate personnel were hoping to encourage it in order to expand
    the local agricultural regions.  GenAssist genetically altered the
    bacteria for prolificity.  The alterations worked, and in a few
    short years, the entire soil surface was fixing nitrogen at a 
    prodigious rate--an alarming rate.  GenAssist tried desperately to
    create an \'antidote\' lifeform, but to no avail.  In a bizzare twist
    of events, on of the \'antidote\' attempts mutated into a strain
    capable of storing oxygen in the soil.  Within a century, the entire
    atmosphere of Ishimshulgi was locked in the world\'s crust."

Agree that this seems likely, it is WAY too easy to have 3 or 4 totally

I like this a lot; the hospital I work at does not give you full vesting in

Don\'t the T4.0 rules state that one end to character generation is to quit
at a certain age, and thus if not finished with the current term to be 
considered still in the service?

the Imperium Working Group.  We were almost instant friends because
we shared one very intense interest--Stars in Traveller.  The subject
has also been the source of some disagreement between us, but for the
most part we agree.  He spent a long time applying fixes to stars in
the Solomani Rim, while I did for the stars of Spica sector.

We had attempted to get Dave Nilsen to put some fixes into to T:TNE,
but he only made minor changes, and didn\'t really address the problems.
In fact, he added new ones, but I digress.

From the first Book 6: Scouts, by GDW, we and others were encouraged
to add more detail to our campaigns using the Expanded Generation System
and the detailing of Stars and their systems.  As data was made available
on the Internet, and through the publishing of sectors from GDW and then
DGP, it became understood that the generation system produced companion
stars that were not too realistic.

The problem is fixable, but there is a lot of sector data "out there"
that has the original generated statistics for those stars.

I just got off the phone with Marc and he is interested in seeing whay
kind of response the posters of this mailing list have to say on the
subject.  If there is no interest, then you can be assured of no change.

If there is sufficient interest to warrant "fixing" that part of the
rules, then it will be up to how "you" make known your desire for change.

Some of you may be familiar with the Book 6: Scouts update web page I
maintain.  It is by no means complete, and I have a very rough draft
of a page for dealing with the rather frequent White Dwarf star system.
I also have some additional material to put up on the pages, but have
not done so at this time.

  EGS  http://ouray.cudenver.edu/~lwlguatn/SF/egs.html
  WDS  http://ouray.cudenver.edu/~lwlguatn/SF/wds.html

Let Marc know how you feel about:

  1)  Is fixing the stars in Traveller a big deal?

  2)  What should happen to the existing data in print and ftp?

      (BTW, I personally advocate not including the stellar data
       into listings, ala First Survey, if this issue is not going
       to be dealt with, as was done in the earliest days of CT,
       and T4 with the Core Subsector listing the rules book.)

  3)  How much of an Expanded Generation System is need?

       enough to do the entries in UWP files?
       enough to do the whole system as has been done in the past?

  4)  Any other opinion of relevance?


Marc and I plan to do our best to follow this thread if it takes off.
Feel free to send any response privately if that is your style.

True.  I knew lasers had dramatic explosive effects to surrounding
tissue (because of its high water content) but I forgot to take into
account the fact that the material in the beam\'s path could not get
out of the way in time before the laser pulse shut off.  Ok... so
lasers _shouldn\'t_ be included in the 3D max damage rule :)

I\'d say the latter - treat as if ship were within 100 (10?) diameters.

Most of the best stuff was by Marcus L Rowland, who can be contacted at

I now consider S&A (not to be confused with S&A) to be non-canon. According to 
MT, the Scout uniform is blue, not black, and the insignia are different. 
Neither CT or MT gave Scouts medals (although it looks like T4.1 might change 
that).

*******************************

    Then James Lindsay restates his penchant to make damage
determination
somewhat more cumbersome than what the designers for T4 wished (at least
in
spirit).  Also, let me point out to James that while lasers do pass at
the
speed of light by their very nature (light amplication at varying
wavelengths
from UV ones at TL9 to the Xray spectrum lasers at TL14) and thus their
kinetic energy element of damage is greater than their thermal component
(since Kinetic Energy is the product of one half the mass multiplied by
the
SQUARE of the velocity), the fusion and plasma based reactions fire a
bolt of
superheated plasma energy, which, though may move quite quickly, will
NOT in
anyway approach the speed of light as James suggests (c is actually 3
km/sec).  The superheated energy is what counts (thermal) and not really
a
time dependent thing

******************************

Just some quick FYI that may (or may not) affect your ideas:

1)	

c = 3x10^8 m/s  or 300,000 km/sec

2)	

While c^2 is in fact a very large number, m(photon) = 0 (or at least
immeasurabley small using todays techniques.  So you get:

E = .5mv^2 = .5*0(or very small)*(very large) = 0 (or undefined).

The classical KE equation does not work for photons and relativity must
be resorted to where

E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2  ; p = momentum

if m(photon) = 0 exactly

E = pc 

now also E = hf   (where h is Planck\'s constant: 4.136x10^(-15) eV-sec)

and c = f*wavelenth.    so......

p = h/wavelenth

The momentum transfered to your target by photons is dependent on the
photons wavelength (or the Energy deposited into you target depends on
frequency if you prefer it that way)

Just thought you might be interested....

Nowhere in your sources does it state that the Solomani terraformed entire

You are reading more into the rules than are there.  According to the WBH,
ALL forms of Terraforming recive a substantial bonus for TL12+ (WBH pgs
68-69.)  

You have yet to show in Scots, WBH, or World Tamers\' a hard rule declaring
what forms of Terraforming are prohibited until TL 16.

The Sahara desert makes up about 1.7% of the Earth\'s surface area, or about
9 hexes on a standard 500-hex world map.  This is not an "entire
hemisphere" or larger, and fits with the TL-12 description.

If you leave a natural system alone, it will repair itself.  Also, the roll
for terraforming Earth\'s atmosphere would be -2.. impossible at *any* TL.
I don\'t think it has ever been canon that Earth\'s atmosphere ever changed
from 6 to 7.  It got very unpleasant, yes, but not to the "filter masks
required" point.

In 832 the Imperium is TL 14.. or are you now saying that the Imperium was
actually TL 16, or 17..

The fact that it took over 2000 years to complete the project should tell
you something.. the Solomani overeached themselves, and started something
that couldn\'t be done at their tech level.  If they had been TL16/17, the
project would have been completed before the Long Night.

The roll for changing Mars\' atmosphere at TL12: Size=4, +1; Hyd=0, -1;
Since no pop data is given I will give it a zero effect. Tech=12, +2;
Life=No, +2.

To change Mars\' atmosphere at TL12:  4- on 2D6.  This is very doable.

Please note that we are modifying bacteria today (at TL8.)  Also, they were

Since this entire section hinges on one quote that is contradicted in
several other sources, I tend to dismiss the AI comment and go with the
TL12 low autonomous operation thread.

This is akin to the early MT Challenge article that had Varian on the
throne and Lucan as the murdered Prince.. a simple mistake.

Well, we\'ve all seen the reaction to that haven\'t we?

> Long Night moments
>  -1700  No more fusion technology on Sylea (TL 7)
>  -1526  Long Night not noticeable on Terra (TL ?)

Note that Sylea maintained TL 10 throughout the Long Night, reaching TL11
in -650 and TL12 in -150. (MT RC, pg 34)

A look at Leroy\'s evidence shows that much of it consists of conjecture,
and fails to address the issue of where it is published that the Rule of
Man reached TL16+.  Even his last second mention of Greg Porter\'s comment
in EA fails to meet his lofty claims.

The facts as I see them:

The terraforming of Terra and Mars are fully withint the limitations of
TL12.  Indeed, the Mars project is still going on at the time of the
writing of Rats and Cats.

The two global terraforming projects mentioned.. one was a complete
failure, the other required two milenia and Imperial intervention to reach
partial success.  

There is no evidence that Solomani genetic engineering reached TL17 levels.
 I will grant that the solomani were advanced where genetic engineering was
concerned, but not to the degree Leroy claims.

Except for one sentence, all Traveller materials point to the RoM having
low-functioning automonous robots.

After reading the arguements, and checking the source material for myself,
I have to say that I still find nothing that contradicts the Rule of Man
possessing Tech 12 with some early tech 13.  Possibly a medical/genetic TL
of very early 14 could be justified.

I must admit it\'s rather amusing to see an author apologizing for posting

Tough question.  I think "Yes".  The data involved is widespread, but
unfixed data "left" out there wlill not have a specific impact on specific
campaigns.

Traveller, meanwhile, has always carried the torch of "Hard" sci-fi.  This
seems a relatively easy way to bring the "canon" universe into compliance
with "hard" science.

An "errata" to First Survey (or republishing if we are in time) is all we

I advocate rules that get into as much detail as possible, in as modular a

resource data, or the economic data, or just what moons it has.

>  4)  Any other opinion of relevance?

The main problem with complying with "hard science" is that science
changes.  In six months, after the Mars lander data has been chewed over,
all our planetary theories will undergo an "axial tilt" of a sort and be
reinterpreted, altered, completely changed, or just thrown out in light of
the new data.  Taking this into consideration, the best policy is to stay a
little bit \'abstract\' in detail level for some aspects, similar to the way
PE stayed abstract with certain economic concepts that are debatable (it
also grabbed a couple by the horns, but I digress).

Good Luck!

I simply don\'t agree.  The MT Referee\'s Companion clearly states that
turning an Insidious atmosphere (such as Venus) into a standard atmosphere
is TL 16 Global Terraforming.  Doesn\'t it seem to you that doing this is a
much more extensive, higher tech feat than simply removing an atmospheric
taint?  In one base you take an atmosphere with no free oxygen, deadly
gases, no Earth- compatible life (and possibly a much higher or much lower
atmospheric pressure)and transform it into an earth-like world, complete
with earth-like like (which is necessary to maintain the oxygen
atmosphere. In the other case, you remove a single, or a small number of
unhealthy gases from an otherwise fully breathable oxygen atmosphere which
has a similar density to Earth\'s. 

Clearly the ability to remove an atmospheric taint is going to require
much less than TL 16. 

The current Solomani Confederation is clearly not TL 16 and they are
terraforming Mars *very* slowly.  Someone else suggested that the TL
limits on terraforming applied primarily to terraforming project which
were designed to be completed within a reasonable span of time (say less
than a century).  Mars and Heiphaistos are very slow projects.  It has
taken hundreds of years to change Mars so that it has *almost* gone from a
Trace atm. to a Very Thin atm. This is a very minor change compared to
turning an Insidious atm into a Standard atm. 

Also, does it not seem a bit odd to you that at TL 12 you can terraform at
most several hexes of a world, total?  Why would that be?  At TL 12 you
terraform several thousand miles and you suddenly reach some magic limit
that says you can\'t do any more? The *only* reasonable answer I can see
here is that the text refers to the fact that you can only terraform
several thousand square km *at once*.  By this logic, greening the Sahara
is quite possible, it would just take a while.  If you can turn Venus into
a new Earth at TL 16, it honestly doesn\'t make sense that greening the
Sahara won\'t take TL 14.  Quoting canon is useful, but adding in a modicum
of scientific knowledge and speculation is the only way to avoid vast
logical errors. 

I remain unconvinced.

Why invoke the necessity of the 2nd Imperium using TL 16 robots when we
have the statement (which you just quoted above) which said that
"self-programming (heuristic or self-teaching) AI software is a TL 12
development".  No, TL 12 robots are not fully volitional sentient beings,
but by the above statement and by current definitions they are clearly
AIs.  We also have material in S&A which talks about the introduction of
the Terrans AI robots being a important factor in the Terran war effort. 
To me, this implies that robots were something relatively new on Terra. 
If the Terrans were building TL 16 robots during the wars it is only
logical to assume that they had built TL 12 & 13 low and high autonomous
robots at least a century or more earlier and that robots were fairly
ubiquitous in their culture. 

I also see no logical reason the Terrans would have had to have TL 16
robots.  The Zhodani do wonders with much lower tech warbots and combat
support robots.  A TL 12 low autonomous AI robot is a wonderful tool for a
war effort (especially since one task they can be put to is making more
robots, so exponential growth of robot populations is very easy as long as
the resources last).  Finally, we have no evidence in any sources that
2nd Imerium robots were fully sentient beings and not fancy AI tools (like 
low and high autonomous robots.  

Once again, I\'m far from convinced.  In no cases are any of the quotes you
supply about either robots or terraforming unambigious enough to support
you viewpoint over the one I have just outlined. Given that there is no
reason to assume that the 2nd Imperium was TL 15 or 16, and that a number
of sources say it was not (once again excluding all T4 sources) there is
no reason assume that it was.

I agree with that - the interesting characters I\'m thinking off (supporting
the need for career changes) were:

1 term Rogue, 4 term Army
1/2 term Injured Marine, 5 term Agent

All he changes were provoked by roll failures of soem sort except for

4 term scout, 2 term merchant.

I would also not allow two ship receipts if in T4.1 (still waiting for an
rtf of the new rules to read).

Maybe limit services to Marine, Navy, Army, and not scout (as they\'re quite
a bit different).

time of the Civil War (c.600).

city called Mifa Lanco that floats above the planetary surface (but I
doubt if it is the \'capital\'; and an orbital city called Ton Vorn, which

know from something I\'m doing on the Antares Sector that the Imperium was
expanding through the subsectors to rim-spinward of the Antares
Sector, until the Pacification Campaigns (76 to 120) when they had most of
the sector.

Establish a system that does not completely divorce the generation of the
system main and secondary worlds from the stellar type. For example, there
shouldn\'t be a bunch of dense atmospheric, large worlds orbiting type M8 V
stars. It\'s just not likely to happen.

The main fix should be the removal of too many type-M dwarf stars. These
are extremely rare and Traveller makes them out to be *the* most common
stellar type of all. Right now the fix is to change them to main sequence
stars (V) from dwarves (D). The system needs to be fixed to better reflect
reality.

By all means, Marc, let\'s fix the broken Traveller stellar data once and
for all. You would do a favor to the game that the last two incarnations
failed to accomplish when there were ready and willing volunteers like
Harold and Leroy chomping at the bit to fix things.

Best,

I myself am writing a Java application (as opposed to applet) for
Traveller. Thus I avoid all the sandbox issues (although I could "sign" the
applet, I suppose).

I think java is a wonderful choice, due to the cross-platform aspects. My
program (which is nearing beta-stage for the astrogation portion) will run
on any machine that supports Java 1.1 (right now Solaris and
Win95/NT...soon Mac and other, I understand...)

More information will be posted when I\'m closer to being done :)

agree that B7 is one of the more Travellereque SF series out there?

As to the Liberator, it seems to be a TL17 or so scout ship with a limited

Unfortunately, the downside is that others can look at what you\'re
referring to. I have a small question (not flamebait, please) about the
change of the name of Sylea to Capital. 
I only have one of the three sources that Hyphen quoted (Adventure 3), and
it states that Capital has been "seat of government since (the Imperium\'s)
founding". This does not necessarily mean that the planet has been called
Capital since the foundation of the Imperium. 
As for the assertion that we should begin calling Sylea "Capital"...I
suggest that the term "Capital" would have begun as a slang term, then
entered general usage, until over time, nobody called the planet Sylea
anymore...by which time, an official name change became just a matter of
formality. Of course, in Year Zero, if you talk about "Capital", everybody
*knows* what you mean...

Funny, my copy does not say what you imply, but I did read it in the
context that you suggest, and don\'t reach whatever conclusion you are
trying to suggest.

Of course.  They worked on Atmospheric terraforming, a much higher TL.

No, you are reading more into the rules than are there.  The procedures
you refer to deal with the TL of the World being terraformed, not
the TL of the Terraformers.  Also, that reference defines "wide-scale
terraforming" as effecting at least a hex, not a whole environment.

Of course, I could estimate the tech level of the force field required
to hold out the non-terraformed atmosphere. :)

Oh, so now I have to write rules declaring that our interpretation is
valid. :)

We make no such claim about the importance of the Sahara, only to show
what _is_ possible at TL12, rather than the (rather extreme) claims I saw
here about what was possible at TL12.

Of course they didn\'t need filter masks--they were protected by their
domed cities, or didn\'t you bother to read that.

No, the proper interpretation there is that the TL15/16 Imperium could
not finish what the Terrans started.

Like I said, they had their hands full, and suddenly with a _whole bunch_
of new worlds open to them, terraforming (a slow and long draw out process
no longer made as much sense) was no longer as important as it had been.

Wrong.  That is the roll to determine if Mars\' atmosphere had changed,
quite something else indeed.

Yeah, and at TL 8, they would have as much trouble trying to do TL16
terraforming as they did at TL14.

I think "known maximum" circa 59 Imperial speaks for itself, but if you
are being stubborn about something ...  I can see the interpretation of
*known maximum* = *actual maximum*, but I don\'t agree.  I can see how it
is possible.  Afterall, there are only two realistic interpretations of
that statement.

Except that you ignore the facts about atmospheric terraforming.

I thought you called yourself a planetologist. :)  You don\'t even know how
to terraform using WBH. :)

Uh, make that atmospheric terraforming--TL16.

Agreed, we think TL14 or TL15.

Or, except for one sentence, all Traveller materials point to the RoM having

I\'m not surprised since you spent a whole two hours (counting the time
to read and digest just what I was really saying) to put up a reply. :)

Actually though, I didn\'t expect you to be influenced by the facts--I do
expect some others "out there" to be happy that I have given them some
backup for what I had claimed, and they rejoiced in.

Like I said, you can promote all this "world-bending" at TL12, but that
doesn\'t leave much fun for the sense of awe that the TI will have for us
in M1100 (or the RoM in M-1800).

Have all the fun you want to in this thread, but I am moving on.

	Well, I\'ve been too busy actually running a game to do it yet, but
wait for FSY\'s 500 Td 4G airframe saucer Ludwig-class yacht coming soon to
a TML near to you.  I just gotta decide on the laser bay vs. NPAW spinal
mount issue before I start crunching numbers..:).

     Well, the language supports applications fairly well. It takes its 
syntax straight from C. ie public void main() {...} and that\'s your 
application. I should be able to convert my Starship Assembly Line 
applet into an application in pretty short order, if there was a demand 
for it.

>Remeber if you want to write to a file it has >to be an application and

     That isn\'t strictly true. There are two ways that an applet can 
have file IO. It can be run as a trusted applet (ie. it is on the local 
classpath), and it can write out files, and for some browsers you can 
have a .hotjava/properties file with specific directories which are 
allowed to be accessed listed (See Sun\'s Java Security FAQ for more info 
on this one).

     Of course if you are writing an application, then you _know_ that 
you can write out files, there is none of the "what if I don\'t" hassles 
which you have in applets.

If by "way too much thought" you mean more thought than the adventure
writers put in, then I agree. If you mean more thought than is warranted,
then I disagree. For me, an adventure comes "crashing down" if I I catch
myself saying \'oh puh-LEASE!\' aloud when I read it. That happened to me
when I read of the TL 14 treasure hoard in Anomalies. Other posters have
remarked on the absurdities of finding TL 14 equipment from a TL 12 culture
which work perfectly after a thousand years. For me, it was the fact that
we\'ve already had this in TNE and I have no intention of turning my
campaign into a treasure hunt.

Even if you ignore the adventures, a more serious problem is the fact that
the writers and editors of the book saw no need to maintain consistency
with previously-published materials. While this is fine for an individual
referee to do, it creates headaches when the publishers do it because I
can\'t use published materials without significant alterations, or a lot of
backpedaling at the end, if I want to maintain a consistent campaign.

Agreed. "Strike!" was dramatic, well-designed, and easily fits into any
campaign. Too bad the illustrations had nothing whatsoever to do with the
adventure.  Still, I liked it better than the feature adventure, which was
another monster of the month. At least they weren\'t psionic; those things
should be banned.

"Advances in genetics lead to the development of practical limb

As a survivor of a genetically linked cancer, let me assure you that the
abilty to regrow limbs, and force grow tissue at TL 10 is genetic
manipulation.  (Which we are doing today, BTW.)

Then why is it possible to have atmospheric terraforming occuring in the
canonical Third Imperium?  It only reached TL15.

Which is exactly what was done to Earth.

No, you need to show where in Traveller it is stated that the RoM reached

According to the 1997 World Alamanc, there are 40 cities in the US alone
with over 1 million inhabitants.  79.8% of the american people live cities.
 Now, S&A states that "several cities" built domes.  Not "all" but
"several".  This is the same leap of illogic that leds people to brand all
homosexuals as AIDS carriers since some gays have the disease.

The Imperium didn\'t achieve TL15 until 1000, during the Solomani Rim War
(the infamous page 34 of MT RC.)  So where did this TL16 knowledge come from?

Spurious arguement.  If you have invested billions of
dollars/credits/whatever into a project, you don\'t give it up just because
a new frontier opens up.  You\'d go bankrupt!

Which it has, from 1 to 3.  BTW.. I just noticed something.. the article in
Rats and Cats states that the terraforming of Mars began *700* years ago..
this was written from the perspective of a Solomani commentator living
during the Rebellion!  Mars wasn\'t started on until the 400\'s Imperial!

I see.  So several sources state that yes, the solomani used low autonomous
robots, one sentence uses the phrase "artifical intellegnce" and you chose
to believe that one.  Ever hear of Occram\'s Razor?  I\'ve heard Sojourner
described as having Artifical Intellegence.  Does this mean that NASA is
using TL16 robotics on Mars?  Call the Men in Black!

No, they aren\'t.  Until now the Ziru Sirka was TL11, and the Rule of Man
was TL12.. the Imperium reached TL15, early 16 before it fell.

Even though by your own admission it shouldn\'t be possible for TL15 Earth
to be changing Mars\' atmosphere code.  Earth was an Imperial possession for
over a century.. you\'d think that they would have noticed TL16 terraforming
going on..

Now you are being deliberately insulting.  I really resent this.  Maybe
when you have a little more credibility around here, I\'ll accept you
judgements, but as for now, you don\'t know what you are talking about.

Amazing.  You\'ve managed to completely reverse my point.  Ther is only
*one* sentence in 20 years of Traveller publications that makes reference
to artificial intellegences in the RoM.. and numerous sources that say that
the robots were mere machines able to "learn" and adapt to changing
situations.

My Traveller materials sit by my desk, and I wanted to reply.. what, I

about twenty minutes to put together my reply.  What can I say?  I\'m just
that good.

OK.  Anybody who agrees with Leroy, please post.  The oldest dodge on the
net is the "silent supporter" routine.  I have seen it to many times to
believe it.  Either you have supporters who will post, or you are making
this all up.  I think I\'ve seen two people post lukewarm commentary about
some of your points.

You want space opera?  Fine, you can declare that the Ancients were really

Cutting and running. Good tactic, goes well with the "Silent Majority."

	Assuming we stick with the "jump grid" idea, the additional mass is quite
outside of the jump grid. I\'d say the attacker jumps out, leaving the

	This bunch of intrepid adventurers is presently assembled, along
with a growingly large number of fellow fortune-seekers, on Mishegaan III,
an LSP mining colony, waiting for an Imperial interdict to lift on a
cluster of main-sequence stars three parsecs away.  They\'ve incorporated,
borrowed some money with the connivance of Liontzel Huutzaa (Ling\'s Chief
Legal Officer, the only lawyer in a two-parsec radius, and such a crooked
one he bumps into himself walking around corners on a regular basis) and
bought up three  J-3 vessels of which they\'re planning on selling 2 and
keeping 1, an FSY Recollet Exploratory Trader.  However, Ling\'s unpleasant
labour relations have led to a full-scale worker revolt.  Last week, Dame
Berek\'san went to dinner with Ling\'s senior manager on the planet just in
time for a terrorist attack, and Perlis and Kehaaarl were hired by Huutzaa
to spirit away Ling\'s records and cash reserves before the revolting
workers got their hands on them.  They were in the process of loading the
records and strongboxes onto a dolly prior to making a getaway through the
ventilation system when the inevitable happened...

This week:

	We opened with Vought Hendaar (Ling\'s numero uno) chatting
pleasantly with Dame Iliana.  Sadly, they were rudely interrupted by an
explosion at the front door to his quarters, which was followed shortly by
a bunch of disgruntled and armed Rye-Ben charging in.  In the heat of the
moment, one particularly dumb Rye-Ben managed to shoot out the big
panoramic windows overlooking the spaceport, and the resulting explosive
decompression blew everybody out the window and down the crater wall...

	Shortly thereafter, Sir Loreni recieved a call from spaceport
security enquiring as to why two of his crew members had been seen entering
the colony armed to the teeth in company with Huutzaa.  Sir Loreni,
forgetting that his having been partway with them must have been recorded
by a dozen cameras, played dumb and said that he hadn\'t a clue.

	Back in Ling\'s vault, Huutzaa and two of his assistants, guarded by
Perlis and Kehaaarl, were busily loading cash and data storage modules onto
a dolly when gunfire and explosions were heard nearby.  Perlis took up a
position covering the door.  Then the decompression alarms began to sound
and the sound of airtight bulkheads sealing was heard.  Shortly thereafter
the door was blown open by a breaching charge.  Perlis hosed the first
Rye-Ben through the door down with her ACR-12.  While Huutzaa and flunkies
finished up loading the dolly, Kehaaarl spotted someone trying to pull the
downed revolutionary to safety and fired his FSA 15mm gauss anti-tank
weapon (which I will get around to posting one of these days) through the
wall roughly where the would-be rescuer\'s body would be.  Huutzaa\'s
flunkies, vigourously assisted by Kehaaarl, climbed up into the vent and
began hoisting the dolly up.  Kehaaarl then took up a position covering the
door, while Huutzaa, followed by Perlis, began climbing up the ladder.

	Then someone tossed a breaching charge in the door.  Kehaaarl dived
for safety behind a desk.  Perlis, realizing she wasn\'t going to make it up
the ladder in time, flung herself to the floor.  The charge went off; I
rolled extremely badly, and so all save Huutzaa escaped with minimal
injuries; he took 6 points and fell off the ladder.  Kehaaarl then helped
Huutzaa up the ladder (rather energetically), while Perlis covered the door
(shooting two more Rye-Ben in the process).  Kehaaarl covered her escape
and then scooted up the ladder himself (at this point the Rye-Ben had taken
a half-dozen casualties and were regrouping), hauling it up after him.
They all ran down the ventilation shaft by which they\'d entered; some
seconds later some extremely brave individual stuck his head into the vent
and had his courage rewarded with a 15mm gauss dart.

	Reaching the end of the shaft, they encountered a set of sealed
doors (automatic decompression safety measures had cut off their escape
route).  Huutzaa began to mess with the overrides while Perlis and Kehaaarl
covered his back.  One Rye-Ben actually managed to get a shot off (missing)
before getting blasted by Kehaaarl; then Huutzaa managed to get the doors
to open and they hustled the dolly out into the main ventilation shaft.
With gunfire sounding behind them, they rolled it onto the cargo elevator
they\'d ridden up and descended back into the depths of the mine.  Loading
up their TL-12 utility vehicle, they started heading back towards the
minehead, but were stopped by the fact that there appeared to be a major
firefight, complete with big explosions and gargantuan cranes plummeting
hundreds of meters down mineshafts and so forth, taking place at the
minehead.

	Then they noted that atmospheric pressure in the mine was beginning
to drop; there had been a blowout somewhere.  Consulting his handcomp,
Huutzaa decided that the next best escape route would be an emergency
egress shaft about 10 km away through the tunnels.  Perlis called Sir
Loreni to arrange for pickup.

	Back at the ship, Amr had just sauntered out towards the terminal
concourse when Sir Loreni\'s negotiations for the sale of their Locust-class
trader were interrupted by Perlis\' call for help.  However, their request
for clearance to take off was denied; spaceport control was not allowing
any departures given the state of unrest in the colony.  So they decided to
take the LAV-10 that had come with the Recollet.

	It turned out to be surplus from Baron Erghaan of Mu\'s elite
Special Riot Control Unit, upgraded with a Fusion+ power plant, and sported
a rather clumsily-retrofitted FSA OKA-SQ 5-barrel 4000 rpm 18mm shotgun in
a turret, with the ammo hopper hanging off the back.  Sir Loreni and Elo
piled into it and drove off at high speed to pick up the others, discussing
their prospects for obtaining cargo along the way and ignoring the raw
alien splendor of the Mishegaan landscape at sunset.

	Arriving at the emergency egress shaft (basically a largish
geodesic dome sheltering a cargo elevator out in the middle of nowhere) Elo
donned a respirator and entered the dome, while Sir Loreni stayed in the
getaway ca... er, LAV-10.  Seeing vehicle headlights at the bottom of the
shaft, (only about 10 m deep at this point) he called out; Perlis
responded.  Huuztaa\'s flunkies quickly loaded the strongboxes and files
onto the elevator, and they, Perlis, Kehaaarl, and Huutzaa rode up to the
top of the shaft, where Elo helped them unload the elevator.

	Suddenly, the elevator started descending again.  Elo quickly
ripped open the control panel and started messing with the wiring, causing
the elevator to jam in place halfway down; rather peeved, the Rye-Ben
Worker\'s Death-To-Ling Suppressionists Party members at the bottom of the
shaft opened fire, blowing several holes in the roof of the dome causing
decompression alarms to sound again.  The party beat a hasty retreat to the
airlock, with Elo, the last one out, thoroughly messing up the controls so
that the inner door only had one setting: shut.  They boarded the LAV-10,
Kehaaarl rapidly doffing his gun and its cassette backpack and jumping into
the gunnery station.  As they did so, a breaching charge blew a hole in the
side of the dome; Kehaaarl quickly turned the OKA-SQ onto the dome and
hosed it down with VRF shotgun fire as Sir Loreni floored it out of there;
however, he ran out of ammo after only 15 seconds or so...

	At Sir Loreni\'s insistence, Huutzaa called the spaceport
authorities and arranged to have the cash reserves picked up.  After
dropping off the strongboxes, they returned to the ship, where Huutzaa paid
Perlis and Kehaaarl rather handsomely.  Plans were made for obtaining cargo
and buying a launch, and Dame Berek\'san\'s absence was noted.  As there was
no answer at Hendaar\'s quarters, Sir Loreni called Ling\'s head of security,
Stoob Noitag.  He reached him in Lebar Eehrt (the spaceport head\'s)\'s
office; he was told that there had been a blowout in Hendaar\'s quarters
earlier and that Hendaar and Berek\'san were missing.  Noitag then told Sir
Loreni that as of fifteen minutes ago he had resigned as Ling\'s chief of
security and was looking for passage off planet.  Sir Loreni quickly
accepted his offer of double the standard rate.

	Shortly thereafter Ling\'s chief medical officer called Sir Loreni,
and offered to purchase passage out for himself and his family, again at
double the usual rate...

	And we called it there, it being late.  More in two week\'s time...

Perhaps, in M0, people would talk about \'Sylea\', or \'The capital\' (i.e..
capital of the 3I).  Then, after hundreds of years, it would become
known as just Capital.  However, I think that even those on the planet
would still call themselves Syleans and say the planet is Sylea.  It\'s
hard to change what people call themselves, even if you change the name
of the country\\planet, etc. that they\'re on.

As for a date, I\'ve been thinking, and, without access to the massive
Traveller libraries some have, I would guess around 400-600 the name
would become the standard.  In and around Core Subsector, it would
probably be called Sylea still though, as people had been calling it
that for thousands of years.

One interesting fact, do you think those on the frontier regions of the
Imperium in M1100 would know that it had indeed been called Sylea?  If
you said Sylea was the capital would they disagree?  It\'s odd what some
people don\'t know about their own countries sometimes, and when you get
to an interstellar level, who knows...

BTW, to everyone who replied to my questions, concerning my story, thank
you very much for all your help.  Right now, I\'m figuring out what I\'m
going to give the IISS as motto, and when I do, I\'ll post it
here....probably something do with stars, exploration and empire (but, I
guess that was obvious).

  Here\'s the original post someone just referred to. I\'ll avoid the
terraforming technicalities due to not having WBH, but it seems
evident that perhaps TL 16+ robots implies TL 16 computers and much
else, not least fire control, and perhaps jump drives?

  Re: medical technology. It seems reasonable that accomplishing
something due to "advances in genetics" implies use of geneering?
If not, a correct explanation and/or definition would be useful.

  If the Long Night wasn\'t noticeable on Terra, why did Terra
not exceed TL 14 until after the Solomani Rim War (i.e., Invasion:
Earth)? While no advancement might occur during the Long Night what
happened from either -1110 (Old Earth Union formed) or 200 (trade
re-established) until 588 when Terra entered the 3I? (dates from AM6).

  Sylea losing fusion tech would be TL 9, not 7, correct?

  I have to point out that this sort of attitude isn\'t really helpful,
and doesn\'t have much to do with research or even debate (kind of like
watching Colonel North on "Crossfire").

Just want to quickly back up Douglas here, S&A does indeed refer to
several cities in "North America and Europe".  Thus, this takes out many
of the world\'s largest cities, such as Tokyo, Shanghai, Beijing, Rio De
Janiero.  Many of those have some of the worst smog, etc. (Don\'t many in
Tokyo wear filter masks?).  If the atmospheric problems had been that
bad, all of the world\'s countries would have had domes over at the very
least their most populous cities.  However, all of these Asian and South
American centres are left out.

Also, I suppose ana rguement could be made that the nations didn\'t have
the money for the domes, and, if S&A had pointed out that Japan had
domes I would agree.  However, Japan is a very wealthy nation, and on
the cutting edge of technology.  one would think that if the atmospheric
problems were large enouh to cause a UWP change, then the world\'s most
cutting edge technological nation -Japan- would have had domes over it\'s
cities.

Next, a small point concerning the terraforming TL.  Not having access
to WBH (I wish), I only conjecture.  However, here is some things from
S&A to take into accunt when deciding how much \'damage control\' the
Terrans had to do after the ravages of the 19th and 20th centuries:

Solomani and Aslan, pg. 19

	"By the time our ancestors reached Mars, we were overtaxing our
planet\'s ecology with our carelessness.  Drastic global warming --a
result of atmospheric pollution-- caused sweeping changes in weather
patterns....
	While we humans fought against each other, Terra\'s wildlife fought
against the changing environment.  Widespread climate changes, along
with shinrkage of natural habitats, took a toll of Terra\'s animal and
plant populations.  Several species died out, unable to adjust to the
environmental disrption."

Sounds quite like today actually ;-\\

Anyhow, back to the arguement.  It mentions in that paragraph that
\'while we humans fought against each other\'.  Thus, alll this happened
before the Terran exploration and conquest of their solar system, as it
mentions on the same page, "Although national competition was brisk for
resources of spa, we knew no major wars".  I would conjecture then, that
by the time of the discovery of Jump Drive (2087), Humans had begun the
major work of environmental recovery, all at TL 10 (is that J-Drive?) or
below in some areas.

Like I said, I don\'t have access to all the massive lirbaries, but this
is what it hought, that the RoM did NOT ascend to TL 15+.  I can see
some TL 14\\15 areas perhaps...but TL12 was definitey the norm.  In
genetics\\medicine TL13\\14, but not the high numbers purposed by Leroy.

Thanks,

	Personally, I find the idea of a high-tech RoM very intriguing; at 
least on the fields of geneering and computers/robotics RoM could\'ve 
well reached TL 16, with TL 12 on others. I am not supporting Leroy 
per se, because high-tech RoM _is_ not canon. But, canon\'s been 
changed before - air/rafts were supposedly TL 8 vehicles. Looking out 
the window, I don\'t see any flying around. :)

	IMO, sometime in the (not-so-distant) future we\'ll have to rethink
some TL definitions again. AFAIK, cloning a sheep is TL 9 tech; so
are most of the computers you can buy at shops today. Practical 
laser weapons might be pushed way back into TL 11+, AI computers
down to TL 12-13, declare Jump Drive a variant with Stutterwarp 
being in common use in RL... :)

	I don\'t see any reason why Traveller wouldn\'t be around in one form
or another for the next 20 years, too. We just have to keep revising
it, so it stays _the_ state-of-the-art game.

	As for going out of line to patch up the mistakes made my some T4
authors, no way. It\'s going to take a whole lot more than some nice
pictures in the rulebooks (which are non-canon, btw.) to convice me
to change from my own cocktail of MT/Hard Times, GURPS and
Sterlingesque cyberpunk with some B5 flavour, to T4.

	Can\'t anybody post without the C-word anymore? :)

Based upon RSB and SSOM, Not at all, unless it pulls the other ship within

TL 16 worlds in MT were few, and far between... 1 or two per sector.. not
enough for overall commercial impact... Based upon the 1120 stats, TL16 was
above "Imperial" levels; you couldn\'t field a TL 16 force too far from a TL
16 world where it originated; TL 15 was caommon enough to be fielded quite
a distance. And, with hard times starting in 1126, and TL FALLING... well,
yes, TL 16, for imperial forces, is too high.

That\'s a tack I hadn\'t thought of... still, unreasonably virulent to have
done what is needed for TNE\'s setting to occur (Very Much IMHO)

No, Erwin, you got that bit wrong. One interrupt per character. You may not
interrupt your OWN side\'s people/etc. But you can interrupt the guy who
interrupted your pal.

>Can some kind soul out there explain the reasoning behind this
>restriction to me?

Erwin:
        It boils down to this:

        Side A has one guy, side B has 5. A tries to act, B1 interrupts
immediately. Since A is alone, no others on A may interrup B, and no other
b\'s may interrupt B1, until B1\'s done and let A move 1 square or do one
action.

More complex sit: A1, A2, A3, A4, B1, b2,  b3. b4, b5, b6

A1: 1 space, interrupted
  B1 shoots, interrupted
    A2 moves to draw a bead on b1
      B2 interrupts A2 after 1st square, and shoots
      B3 interrupts A2 after 2nd square, and shoots
      B4 wants to interrupt, but can\'t until after A2 does something
    A2 Shoots B1 dead!
      B4 now interrupts A2 before A2 can step back into cover, and steps...
        A3 interrupts B4, and shoots him dead before he can get a shot off
           WITHOUT moving to do so
      B4 now dead, has no action
    A2 now steps back into cover (1 space
  B1 also now dead has no further action
a1 steps again
  B5 now interrupts, as A1\'s next space will be into cover
     so he moves once to get a bead...
    A4 interrupts, and shoots B6, resulting in B6 being KO\'d
  B5 proceeds to shoot A1
A1, now wounded, finally gets into cover.

Combat sequening in MT is Interrupt driven. The above is a "from-memory"
rework of an explanation in TD...

 FFS p. 38, Construction materials: Stone has toughness of 0.2/cm.
However, I have no idea for the weight, or for the cost of tunneling
an asteroid. Also, the actual armor value may vary a bit here and
there. In combat, I\'d add a random modifier to the ship\'s armor value,
+-10% of the original might work fine.

	... or maybe just most European and North American people were
unwilling to give up the "freedom" of driving their hydrocarbon-
burning TL 6 ground vehicles that kept polluting the air, so domes
had to be built to keep the smog _inside_ the cities, wereas in other

I\'m deserparate. I have difficutlies in the DEI Laser sequence.
In fact I didn\'t succeed in finding the same weight than the one give in
the TNE book (mark1, mod1)

TL9 8cm DEI Rifle (SA2, SA1, small auto). The official Weight is 4.2Kg

A DEI laser need

Focal Array,
Cooling system from 50 to 80% of the total
Structure (2 Level)
RAM adapter
Bullpup stock
Optic

+ Backpack which need
Battery
HPG
Cooling from 20 to 50% of total
Container

Does anyone tried to redo this design on the official example to verify it

The Laser is non gravitic and the max pulse is 0.04MJ (SA1), so the focal
array is designed with this value. 
The cooling system total volume is 1.33Liters

As the ROF is 1 (SA1) I multiply the FA by 4

Adding, ruggetized structure, RAM adapter, bulpup stock, optics and using
80% of cooling (max allowed), It\'s no good and weight is too low.

The values are nearly correct if I double the FA again. But if I do that,
the ROF become SA2 (with 0.04MJ pulse) which is not the given figure.

Please help!

    'body' => 'I\'m very confuse about the batteries and HPG in the small weapon design
(Gauss, ETC and DEI Lasers)

I really need you opinion on those designs. Thanks in advance for help.


* About the (seems to be) correct case : DEI Lasers

Get the required energy then find the battery volume which can provide this
level of energy for a period depending on the number of shot you want.
The HPG is directly depending on the Required enregy per shot or per burst.

This sequence is OK, the battery usually take less than 10% of the volume
of the backpack (most is HPG) :-)


* About the corrected (but still broken) case : Gauss weapons

Gauss weapon are the evolution of slug wepon at TL12-13. So they would have
to be more efficient ( if not, they wouldn\'t be evolution)

Take the required energy, The reviever weight depend directly of this
figure. If you check the given array, they are coherent with the HPG table
in chapter 8. :-)

Now calculate the battery weight with the next page formula, you obtain
something usable for a pistol design (~200g usually), but totally unusable
in a portable autorifle (~3kg per 40 bullet). 
But if you recalculate the battery weight with the same system used is the
DEI laser sequence, you would find battery weight 15 times lighter
(average) :-(

It\'s Antti Lahtinen who explained me this design. Now I use it too. Gauss
pistol are real improvement of slug weapon (except for the recoil which is
usually higher because of the smaller weight. :-)

Sequence seems to be easily corrected.


* Now the Evil design : ETC slug ammo

The ETC cartrige use Energy to explode. So you need a HPG in the reciver
and battery in the feed system as for Gauss ammo.

The ETC reciver add 300g, assuming it\'s HPG, it\'s 150cm3, so at TL10
(0.08m3/MJ) this an energy of 1875J

But if you calculate the battery for one bullet, you would have a stored
energy of 27.000 J !! 15 times the Reciever energy capacity. :-(

Further more, as then TL increase the reciever energy increase (volume
doesn\'t reduce), that mean that the ETC cartridge efficiency reduce with TL
(sound stupid, isn\'t it?)

I suggest defining a required Energy for the ETC cartridge ignition and
then calculate all the figures (HPG banks and batteries) with the regular
battery and HPG sequence in chap 8.

What about 1000J to heat 1mg of material to plasma state? Sound not too
bad! and gives nearly good result in the weapon design sequence. 1000J for
10J/g material raises the Temp to 100.000K, might be sufficient, no?


- ----Other Topic----
The Gauss ammo weight is broken

The Gauss figure says 0.04*pi*r2 which is not a volume but a surface.
The mass driver says pi*r3/10 (which is tghe correct formula of a cylinder
of 5 time its diameter in length)

Let\'s calculate the limit value (2cm bore)
   Gauss ammo : 12.56g (density = 0.04g/cm3, gazeous ???)
   Mass ammo : 314g (density = 10g/cm3, good average)

If you use the Mass driver formula the regular \'mm*20mm ammo weight 2.5g
instead of 0.5g, this multiply the muzzle energy by 5 at the same velocity
(or reduce the muzzle velocity by 2.23 for the same muzzle energy)

So the barrel length has to be modified (V/45)*TLm instead of (V/100)*TLm.
Even my figure gives different value, because the Gauss ammo mass formula
is a surface calculation.

The official TL13 gauss pistol (muzzle energy near 600J) has it\'s muzzle
velocity reduces from 1500m/s to 650m/s for the same damage efficiency. I
succeeded in keeping the weapon size.

But know the Reciver weight is nearly 90g, and if build only fro HPG, its
volume is 45cm3. The length is 9cm. Assuming it\'s a parallelepiped, I
obtain a section of 5cm2 (2*2.5cm) with a density iof 2g/cm. 

Further more, the barrel takes 10cm and weight nearly 600g if I remember (I
don\'t have to figure here). As the Grip is held of the reciever, this seems
to be a very fragile structure. 

Again Antti doesn\'t seem to add the reciver length to the gun, He explained
me that he has spread the HPG aroung the gun (I hope I\'ve correctly
understood). I would personnally say that the reciver length is the length
of a bullet plus 1 or 2cm (Part of the barrel may be attached to the grip.

Why not increasing the barrel length, the feed system is direcly connected
to the barrel (or by the mean of a minimum reciever) then putting HPG
around the barrel (but not adding length)


Thanks for attention

Sigh.  Had my personal feelings with the direction Traveller was taking,
an unfortunate exchange with Loren Wiseman at GenCon (I was terribly 
fan-boy at the time, and know him a little better now), and my online 
time been free then like it is now, I would have stayed with HIWG...

I still regret walking away from this game for years...

the Rebellion setting stunk, was stunned to have him brag to myself and
others that "he" was the one who "killed" Strephon.  Hope I\'ve grown up
a little since then...]

You know, I used to envy people on this list who said this stuff...  Then
that fateful day came when my voice mail at work had this little message -
"This is Marc Miller... I was looking at your website last night..." 

Okay - perhaps I am a little fan-boyish still - I have the number, I just
can\'t bring myself to call it - I prefer e-mail, it preserves the mystique
of "separation"...

I\'ve seen this before, and the only reservation I had was your location 
for the Helix Nebula, and it\'s impact on that area of Imperial space...

Note - can we also throw the "locations of REAL stars list" into this

Revise it.  The stellar info is the first bit of info players should have

I\'d like to see WBH, but you\'ll need Roger Sanger\'s involvement there...
Actually, get him in on this - that book needs to come back into the

And a M0 version of the Starship Operator\'s Manual.

Add that "locations of \'real\' stars list" to this work, and I\'m all for
it.  Otherwise, it\'s still not what my players are looking for...

Trust me - I don\'t run Solomani Rim adventures anymore because I was
hammered on the "real stars" thing...

The official re-naming of Sylea to Capital was a profound event for Sylea;
therefore, there must have been a reason which made it necessary - an event
which required a response to show that Sylea was forever inseparable from
the Imperium...

During the Civil War, the Sylean worlds formed an autonomous state;
Emperor Cleon V, one of the longest reigning Emperors of the Flag, the 
Emperor who appointed Arbellatra Alkhaikoi Grand Admiral of the Marches
despite the actions of the last holder of that office (Plankwell), and
the man who "resubjugated the Home Worlds", was well positioned to have
done this - in fact, he is probably the one Emperor of the period other
than Olav (who had won the battle only to lose the war) and, of course,
Arbellatra, who could have ended the Civil War.

I\'ve always wanted to explore him further, make him a more tragic figure,
grand plans, perhaps a hint of a "Zhunastu" bloodline, and enough of the
bearing of Cleon I to terrify his opponents, the "radical nobles".  To 
resubjugate Sylea after its declaration of autonomy, and claim the throne,
he would need an act to rally his followers around (and they were loyal -
many nobles walked out of the Moot session which recognized his murderer
as the next Emperor).  For these reasons, I\'ve always felt that Emperor
Cleon V was the man who officially renamed Sylea to Capital; as a symbol
to Sylea that it could not step away from a troubled realm in its time
of need, and to a troubled Imperium that only one world could ever be 
the capital of 11,000 worlds.

It is significant to note that even the treasonous Dulinor, in the height
of his propaganda campaigns against the murderous Lucan during the
Rebellion, claimed to be planning his transfer of power to Capital, rather
than recognize Dlan as such.

Very intriguing....and probably very true.  That\'s an excellent point,
and, since Japan, as I stated would be cutting edge, I guess they\'d be
more apt to have electric\\natural gas cars instead of our quaint little
gasoline versions :) 

Kind an interesting thought, domes being built over cities to keep the
smog IN, not keep the air pollutants out...:)

  Frankly, I like canon debates - it helps me rather a lot to see how
others look at source material and how they rationalize it.  Reasonable
and well thought out arguementation is always welcome on this list.

  What I found most interesting about the following citations was that I
was aware of all of them, and yet I have formed a very different picture
of what they mean.  Interesting how different people\'s minds work.

  I respectfully have to disagree here.  Much of what makes Traveller
attractive to me, and I dare say many other Traveller players, is exactly
that canonical background.  By and large, the game system is clunky
compared to other RPG systems, though since I\'ve been playing it for so
many years I forgive it much.  The historical background material, on the
other hand, is at the heart of what Traveller is, and making major changes
without good reason seems counterproductive.

  You may post whatever you like, but just as academics expect footnotes
that can be checked, TML posters have come to expect folks who make
assertions to back them up with evidence.  No one on this list will
"trust" you, but they will listen to well reasoned arguements.

  Nowhere is there any mention of making dolphins sentient; while the
sources mention brain modification, they do not therefore imply that
dolphins were not intelligent before.  Moreover, Traveller dolphins remain
very similar to their wild ancestors.  They use waldo-like devices and
specialized life suffort systems on land - they are not radically
modified. 

<<<Snippage of material on tuber colonies>>>

  None of the evidence you cite proves high tech levels for genetic
manipulation.  However, other Traveller materials, especial Rats & Cats,
states that the Solomani had advanced medical and genetic technology,
beyond what other human races did, since they come from the human
homeworld. If we assume, then, that the Tech Level system is a Vilani
construct (sounds like them, does it not?), I have no problem with TL13 or
TL 14 Solomani medical and biotechnology.  After all, MT allows for
variations of more than two tech levels from the standard TL, esp. in the
form of prototypes. 

  However, this does not imply anything else about Solomani tech levels,
since we already knew that they were above their general tech level in
this area.  In fact, if we assign TL14 to Solomani medical technology,
this could be argued as proof that the overall tech level is _lower_ than
TL14, since we know this area is the one that had advanced beyond the
others.

  Please note that all of the above descriptions are of restoration,
rather than of terraforming.  Much of the Sahara, particularly that in the
coastal region of the Med, was forested as late as the Roman Empire
period.  Massive deforestation (which also took place in Greece, Italy,
and other areas of Classical civilization) changed climatic patterns and
vastly expanded the Sahara.  The same can be applied to the jungles
mentioned, whose deforestation is a more recent event.  The only exception
might be the mention of the Siberian plains, but those are just "greener,"
which may mean that intensive agriculture of the Soviet style has been
moderated and improved.

  As others pointed out, not all cities were domed, only "several," and
there is no mention of Earth having a tainted atmosphere.

  Note also that the oceans have risen by 15 meters - hardly the sign of
fully mastered terraforming.

  This is an Imperial project, completed under the Third Imperium.  There
is no indication of how far the project got under the Rule of Man - in
fact, it seems they failed, since the project was abandoned.

  As others have already ponted out, this is an entirely Third Imperium
Project - Rule of Man had nothing to do with it - and can be done at lower
tech levels.

  This is hardly good evidence - a major failure like this hardly implies
a mastery of the technology.  Anyway, although I do not have my copy of
Rats & Cats here, I think this is a project from the Imperial era, rather
than Rule of Man.  If you are using this an example that the Third
Imperium can\'t terraform, well and good, but how then did they do
Hephaistos and Mars, both Third Imperium projects?

<<<Big snippage of Robotics definitions>>>

  No comments here, other than to repeat what others have said - the one
citation you use seems to be a mistake, since it is contradicted by a
number of other sources.  Moreover, if Solomani robots were fully
artificially intelligent, would not the Rule of Man had to deal with the
question of their citizenship?  This is not a strong arguement, I admit,
but the absence of any mention is suggestive.

  Well, we all know how we feel about this.  If Marc wants to change
things, well, okay, but it just seems silly to me.  Makes things too much
like TNE, and we all know how much folks on this list loved _that_ version
of Traveller.

> Leroy and J.P.

  Well, Leroy, thanks much for your post - it was nice to see that you
accepted the challenge of others and posted your evidence.  However, you
have not convinced me.  I still think the Rule of Man was basically TL12,
with perhaps some experimental TL13 stuff.  The one exception is Medical
and Biotech, but we already knew that that was several tech levels in
advance of the general Rule of Man tech level.  Based on your citations, I
agree that the Solomani had TL14 or so in that field.  As I said before,
however, this tends to imply that the rest of Rule of Man tech was _lower_
than TL14, since we know from other sources that biotechnology was well
ahead of the rest of Terran tech.

  I hope you will continue to participate in this discussion, rather than
abandoning it as you seemed to be saying in your last post.  If your
arguements impress people, they will speak up (see the recent task debate
for confirmation) - just don\'t count on the support of the silent
majority, because there is no such thing on TML.

  One other minor point - you might want to review your posts before you
send them, especially when you are responding to arguements.  Your recent
post where you accused another list member of not knowing how to use WBH
were uncalled for, and very rude - you should consider an apology.  You
will find that TML members will argue with you until the cows come home in
a polite way, but they do not take kindly to insults and abuse.  Remember
we cannot see you and tell your tone of voice, so make sure what you write
is what you mean to say.

  Again - thanks for posting your evidence - it made for a very
interesting discussion so far, and I hope we can continue.

Isn\'t it funny how the very best TML pieces tend to come unheralded 
and unbidden from out of the blue (electrons are blue, honest)?  I do 
include Rod Elliott\'s adventure writeups in this category, since I\'m
always pleasantly surprised to see one -- short-term memory must be 
going.

power sources, maybe even weapons.  A TL14 suit implies *all* of the 
above at TL14, including commo, computer and holo-HUD.  That goes a 
long way towards implying at least a broad TL13 to make an 
experimental one.

It strikes me that there are two ways of looking at TL: what you 
*can* do, and what you *actually* do.  The Terrans were always rather 
good at exploiting technology in inventive, creative and (if all else 
failed) sheer bloody-minded ways to get the desired results.  (You can 
build pyramids at TL0, it\'s just extremely hard work!)  I\'m sure the 
Sahara can be irrigated from the edges inwards, at TL 3, but it\'ll be 
slow.  I\'m sure TL 8-10 organisms can make more Venus habitable for 
humans.  The Solomani were extremely good at applying technology.

There are certain physical limits on what can be done by technology 
- -- the minimum sizes of CPUs, efficiency of fusion powerplants, etc..
These correspond to the Vilani TL system, which defines things in 
practical, functional terms, relative to known standards.

When the Terran Confederation "absorbed" the FIrst Imperium, its 
application of technology was boosted enormously.  A star-spanning 
empire 10 000 years old has a lot of applications of technology that 
a civilisation which reached the stars only a couple of hundred years 
before won\'t have had time to develop yet, so the RoM spent a fair 
amount of effort adopting the huge range of TL11 products of the ZS 
and improving them (TL12).  Even existing TL12 technologies underwent 
a period of consolidation using ideas from the reliable Vilani 
designs.

Exceptions to this would have been fields in which the Solomani were 
pre-eminent, notably genetic engineering and robotics.  Efforts in 
computing were largely devoted to adopting the widespread Vilani 
systems, rather than development, although the military continued to 
use Terran style computers for a long time.  The drive for 
improvement in robotics became much less after the end of the 
Interstellar Wars, when the massive expansion of the Solomani 
confederation was less of a priority than the absorption of the 
existing human populations of the ZS.  This left the RoM advancing 
rather steadily compared to their meteoric climb to TL12, with the 
exception of their genetic sciences.

It is in one of those infamous MT errata I think.  After the errata
interrupts work something like:

Each "side" may only have one active interrupt at per attack or square of
movement.

For the next attack each side can interrupt again and so the restriction of
one per combat round was removed.  Note that you CAN interrupt someone on
your own side to lay down covering fire for example - so there could be two
interrupts - one per side - operating on each attack.  Also remember that
each person on each side still only gets one action per combat round no
matter how many interrupts have occured.  If you have already attacked you
can\'t interrupt.

Example (paraphrased from the errata):

Jack and Jill are in a fight with Bill and Bob in a starship corridor.
Jack has the first action for the combat round and he runs out of the
doorway he had been cowering behind down towards a crate to close from
medium to short range on Bob.  Jack heads out into the corridor for his
first square of movement.  Jill then interrupts Jack (note they are on the
same side) to lay down covering fire for him, rolls a 7 and succeeds. Bob
interrupts Jill to shoot Jack before he gets to the crate, rolls an 11 and
succeeds in interrupting.  (Jill would have been better waiting to
interrupt).   Each side now has one active interrupt and no more can occur
- - specifically Bill cannot interrupt Bob to shoot Jill (say).  The actions
are resolved - Bob, Jill, Jack.  Bob is unlucky and misses, Jill gets lucky
and Bob slumps to the floor and Jack moves his first square.

Jack now moves his second square - as it is still his action and he can
move (I forget how many) squares per round. Bill can this time interrupt,
does so and succeeds.  Jill can\'t interrupt Bill (she has no action left).
What happens to Jack is left as an excercise for the reader.

Incidentally I restrict interrupts to one ATTEMPT per side per attack or
movement rather than one SUCCESS as it means large battles flow quicker.

rationale is that mustering-out benefits are partly paid for by 
in-service contributions, which don\'t get transferred at anything

Well this is the kind of statement that provokes dissent in our 
ranks. This is the very topic we are debation here and just saying 
that something is soandso doesn\'t prove anything. You FEEL that there 
is consistancy with the past, we don\'t! The best evidence to find out 
the TL of the ROM os by looking at direct evidence not at wishiwashi 
circumstancial evidence that can be interpreted both ways. MT\'s IC 
and RC both clearly state the RoM TL was 12. That\'s the most direct 
evidence there is and there is nothing ambiguous in these statements. 
They stand alone, ad need no interpretation.
You may feel differently, and play it differently, but this is one of 
the reasons why M:0 is not consistant with what has gone before!

I remember a BBC documentary series called \'Fighter Pilot\' which followed
the progress of a group of potential RAF fighter pilots through training. Of
the 30 or so, the only successful one was in his late 20\'s and had been a
milkman before enlisting. In NZ, the miltary actually prefer their recruits to
have gotten some experience in the civilian workforce before enlisting.

Vilani Emperor?
Uhmm, I know this comes from M:0, but it sort of conflicts just a wee bit
with canon which states in several places that "All Emperors where
genetically pure Solomani until the marriage of Emperor Zhakirov to
Antiama Shiishuginsa in 679" (Library data N-Z, and AM 6 to name two).
The part Vilani Cleon and pure Vilani Artemsus of M:0 sorta fly in the
face of this fact. Now I can happily reevaluate canon to give a higher
than TL 12 RoM (I actually like that one), I can accept that Fusion+ was
not discovered until the 3rd Imperium, I can even accept that a deranged
silicon lifeform ran riot and killed civilisation. However this is somewhat
more than that. I\'d like to see someone handwave this one away :*).

PLEASE PLEASE Fix this...it has to be one of the most irritating aspects

Yes - willing suspension of disbelief is an important part of traveller,
but let\'s not push it too far.  TL4 Garden worlds orbiting white dwarf
stars may be justifiable once, but doing it 20 times in a sector is
definitely too far.

I think that corrected star data should go out in the same format as the
previous data, but with an indication that the data has been fixed. 
This makes it easy to import the corrected data into the various
programs that use it.  If it is decided to put out standard PE economics
extensions and extended system info into the official data, those files
can go out with a label of "Expanded" data.

Whole system - the information on creating the UWP extended data is out
there (in PE for example). 

>   4)  Any other opinion of relevance?

I looked quickly at the fixes at your scouts website and it looks good
to me.  I think the system should have clear levels of complexity - ie,
basic extened UWP, full system generation, socio-cultural generation.  I
would also hope that there would be clear tie-ins to PE.  I would love
to see PE economic data included in this.

I am thrilled that Marc is looking at this seriously.  It has so much

Not for day to day play.  None of my players has ever expressed any interest

Not a problem, as far as I am concerned.  People who have "old" stellar data

As you noted in some of the material on Terraforming, the high 
geneering TL was used to enhance the terraforming of Mars but it seems 
that we had a bit of good luck, as things did not of so well on 
Ishimshulgi! 

>    Within a century, the entire

While some have postulated that the setback on Ishimshulgi was due to 
RoM geneering being only "early" TL 14, I feel that the true problem 
lay in the rest of RoM tech being less advanced.

I am considerably encouraged that the release of an old Terran 
Confederation Naval PR bulletin about the commisioning a line of 
mass-produced robots as support staff for military personnel has grown 
into a justification for these robots being TL 16 AI\'s.  I think that 
if the Naval reports on the success of these robots is ever released 
there would be a serious blow to the Solomani Supremist movement.  
Fortunately, SolSec has made sure those archives are extremely unlikely 
to be discovered by the unimaginative Vilani. 
 
=====

There is an interesting article I came across in some old diaries of a 
Terran Naval officer during the early years of the RoM.  He tells the 
story of meeting twenty top Vilani commanders during their relocation 
on a POW vessel.  When questioned individually about their response to 
a world wide threat (a fission-drive ship headed for the planet, I 
believe), each of the twenty Vilani proposed identical solutions.

Identical!  I believe that Vilani sociologists are planning to use 
this to show how thorough the education of Vilani is, and how Vilani 
plan for every eventuallity.  I recommend a SolSupreme response 
pointing out that the uninspired Vilani have no concept of true 
initiative (of the type that let the vigourous and imaginative Terrans 
thrash the Vilani and so establish the RoM).  The predictable re-use of 
failed Vilani tactics in so many encounters was surely pivotal in the 
war.

   Seriously though, this issue (the meaning of TL) has been hashed to

IMO Vacc Suit manufacture isn\'t a \'narrow field\', as making a TL14 
suit would need TL14 batteries, HPGs, comms, air storage/recycling 
systems and suit materials, just for starters. We\'ve probably got a 
TL14 hand-computer (or equivilent) in there, and perhaps a laser 
rangefinder as well. I reckon that by the time you\'re able to make a 
Vacc Suit (of a given TL) there\'s probably not a lot of non-biotech 
you don\'t have.

Actually it\'s pretty darn easy -TL13+ suits have aren\'t encumbering, 
unless they\'re self-sealing (a give away in itself - self-seal is 
TL13+ tech), integral HUDs are TL14+ (a bit dumb, but there it is), 
but most importantly TL14 gives us the UHP air tank, not found at any 
lower TL. I don\'t think it\'d be too hard to look at a TL14 suit (from 
a TL12 perspective) and say "\'Man this is flash, look at those timy 
air tanks. And dig the nifty HUD..."

Thanks for the explanation. Unfortunately, it raises another question:
which Errata is correct? Maybe we need errata for the errata. 

According to your answer, the post-errata version of the interrupt rules
dispense with the "one interrupt per side per combat round" rule in
favor of the "one interrupt per enemy attack or per square of enemy 
movement" rule. This is also what William Hostman\'s reply implied.

I haven\'t seen this change in any of the errata. Is this the correct
interpretation of the interrupt restrictions?

Out of curiousity, how does T4\'s combat system handle this? Or does it
get rid of interrupts altogether?

One of the many MT Errata collections I came across mentions that the
above restriction is wrong and should be removed. Unfortunately, I
can\'t remember which Errata it was. But, in thinking about this, 
the restriction does seem silly. 

Consider: A1 and A2 are fighting B1 and B2. A1 is about to do something
stupid. A2 should be able to interrupt him if possible.

This makes sense. However, it uses another Errata item, which is one
I also use. According to the original MT rules, when A is interrupted,
his turn is _over_. He doesn\'t get to move or do anything until his
next turn.

The Errata state that B1 interrupts A and, if A is still alive and
kicking after B1\'s interrupt, A gets to finish his turn afterward.

Can\'t happen. Only one interrupt per side per turn is allowed. B3
has to wait until the next turn. 

This is why I\'m confused. Essentially, we have two restrictions that
seem to be redundant:

a) one interrupt per side per turn is allowed
b) only one interrupt is permitted per enemy attack or per square of
   enemy movement

If we play restriction a), then how can b) ever be used?

The whole story can, indeed, be told. The RoM is still TL12.

You\'ve excluded T4 references because they are what\'s on trial here -
you can\'t prove a statement by using the same statement in the proof.
I think that\'s called circular logic.

Traveller\'s revisions in "light of 20 years experience" are, I believe,
mechanical revisions. There have been no new findings that, to my
knowledge, have changed our understanding of the Third Imperium over
the last twenty years. The backdrop remains unchanged.

If you make a statement that\'s putting forward a position that you claim
is the truth, don\'t expect anyone else to accep it until you have 
proof of your claim. That\'s the way it works, not just here, but
everywhere.

Terra was TL12! Terra was also beyond TL12! 

These statements do not contradict each other. I may even provide some

Hm, well, I don\'t know what other mailing lists you belong to, so I can\'t
say. I do imagine, however, that TML requires more vigorous proof
to support arguments than you might see on other mailing lists, yes.
This is probably because TML participants consider themselves, for the
most part, to be discussing "facts" not "opinions". Opinions can never
be wrong, which makes discussions considerably less formal.

Sure. This doesn\'t mean that their overall TL was higher than
TL 12.

Out of laziness, I won\'t re-hash the arguments that other posters have
already made. Your example is proof that the Solomani did terraforming,
but not the Terrans. At any rate, it is debatable whether the terraforming
examples given do indeed represent anything signifgantly higher than
TL 12.

This is essentially sloppiness on the part of whoever wrote these
passages. In general usage, "artifical intelligence" is a broad term,
which encompases a number of meanings. Travellers "low autonomous"
robots would be artifically intelligent by modern definitions. 
Traveller is not, nor should it be, a technical text, where terms
have very exact and specific meanings. Besides, if you really want
to split hairs, the second quote says "common". The first quote 
says "The Terran Navy". I would argue that most Naval technologies,
while advanced, are by no means common.

Again, this is essentially the thesis that you\'re trying to prove,
whether or not you claim to be doing so. You can\'t prove this statement
with itself.


For me, at least, what it boils down to is this:

The RoM had a maximum of Jump-3.
Jump-3 is TL 12 technology.
Therefore, in broad terms, the RoM was TL 12.

There can be certain technological niches (god, I sound like a broken record)
where the niche TL is higher than the overall TL. You have given
good proof that Terran genetic/medical technology was probably higher
than TL 12. I don\'t think that the Terraforming examples are particularly
good, as they aren\'t either large or successful projects and terraforming
is more of an economic activity than a technological one. The examples
you gave of robotics show sloppiness of previous Traveller authors in terms of 
terminology more than anything.

The real sticking point here, is, as always, "What does TL mean"?
Can any TL 16 world produce any TL 16 device? No, we have examples
of that (Sambquis, whatever that planet is called). Can a TL 12
world do stuff at higher than TL 12? Yes, terran genetic engineering.
If I have a vacc suit with TL 14 material, a TL 12 communicator and
an experimental high-TL-12 PLSS, what TL is the whole thing considered
to be? TL is a vage concept, at best.

The overall TL of the RoM was TL 12. Anything that state otherwise is
a contradiction. This is by no means restrictive in terms of what was
available during the RoM, excepting jump drives.

I enjoyed the arguments you put together Leroy, this was a very
well-researched article, but I simply don\'t agree with your points.

Well, after a five-year engineering education and three years of programming
and doing programmer training, your mind and style of speaking tend
to move in a certain way, which doesn\'t make for the best creative writing,
as this exceedingly long run-on sentence that I\'m currently writing is
an exellent example of, showing how something that might be considered
acceptable to those who don\'t normally worry about grammar can be considered
absolutely awful be people, like my wife, who teaches english as a 
second langauge and is always correcting my grammar and pronounciation,
can consider quite bad, if not downright illiterate, whic it isn\'t,
it\'s just that I haven\'t really been trained in the right way to really
fully appreciate and utilize a decent writing style.

Oh, and lately I\'ve started writing technical books and I was just worried
that paragraph after paragraph of describing how to compile Java programs
would negatively impact my writing style.

Thanks for the positive feedback everyone. :)

When I asked Marc Miller about this (approximately a year ago) he said
basically that the uniforms for the scouts, and just about any other
Imperial service, will have changed several times over the period from
Milieu 0 to CT and MT times and beyond. So I\'m afraid other than the red
sunburst, there\'s very little canon to define what they wear. "Uniform" is
quite a vague term to most Scouts, anyway... :-)

My own scout suit (which I sometimes wear when promoting Traveller at
events) is more of a dull grey. Reasoning? It hides the dirt and creases,
looks neutral for encounters, provides reasonable camouflage in most
environments (including urban but probably excluding deserts) without
looking strictly military. Ideal for your typical scout! Badges are small so
as not to be obtrusive.

As regards black, ok, it\'s natty looking but it scares the natives and you
stand out in a crowd. Blue? Be serious. Someone took some liberty with a
book cover and suddenly the scouts are striding around in clothing more
suited to providing a beacon for guiding planes into land... ok, so it would
offer camouflage in water, but that\'s small compensation.

Reality? Operational clothing is a grey TL12 CE suit with chameleon
capability to provide all round camouflage and to allow adaptation of
apparent body colours to match local norms (or expectations) and possibly to
aid communication with beings who react to body colouring or patterning.

That may be, but the stellar generation data in Traveller is *so* broken
that it can only be improved. This is a case where changes in science are
not likely to tell us, "Oh, well Traveller was right all along." Uh-uh. Not
this time.

An interesting \'canon\' reference is the CT Introductory adventure \'The
Imperial Fringe\' and CT Supplement 7 \'Traders and Gunboats\', in which the
Scout/Courier is described as having a major air filtration problem that
requires filters after two (?) weeks and a system flush every eight (?) to
keep the smell down. The expenses are described as going on filters,
cleaning agents and chemicals. Sorry it\'s vague but the books aren\'t to
hand.

No - off the top of my head Vincennes/Deneb was a functioning TL16 society
in the borders of the 3i. TL18 is pushing it though. The write up in the
Regency Sourcebook and the MTJ both implie that Vincennes could become TL17
with very little effort. Hence the range of shops \'G\' - TL16 that are based
on Vincennes. TL16 wouldn\'t be standard or even common...

and later, the excellent combat round example he provides implies that
the rule that "only one interrupt is permitted per enemy attack or per 
square of enemy movement" is used.

Then I came across this:

Note the word "active". The great example he then cites shows that
once each side has an interrupt going, nobody else from that side can
interrupt.

While both people are in agreement that the "one interrupt per combat
round" rule is pure drivel, they differ on interrupting one\'s own
side. The examples they use also show that William doesn\'t the use 
"active interrupt" rule that David does.

I suspect that these differences come from using different Errata.

So, what\'s the general consensus out there for MT referees and players?
What are the restrictions on interrupts?

Personally, I think people should be able to interrupt their own side.
The covering fire scenario used by David is a great example of this.
I\'m interested in other people\'s opinions, though.

 There were several files and I combined these into one large (383 k) 
Excel 5 sheet for my Windows PC.


Are these your spreadsheets?  They are excellent!  The version I have 
does not include animal encounters, so they may belong to someone else.

Features: 
Star system details
     User enters up to 3 stellar codes.
     Sheet generates number of orbits and planets and satelite UWP
     for each orbit (clever programming!).  The only drawback seems to
     be that the user places the main world (and UWP) manually, but 
     thats is not a huge problem!
     
Gas Giant details     
     User enters GG size and satelite UWP.
     Sheet generates physical data such as density, orbital period
     
World details
     Just like Gas Giant details, except user enters UWP and satellite
     UWP

Temperature
     User gives UWP, orbital data.
     Sheet generates temperature profils for different lattitudes,
     seasons, etc.

Starport
     User gives UWP.
     Sheet generates number of docking bays ("berths") in Up and Down
     facilities, shuttle frequwncy, ground transport frequency
     
Census
     User gives UWP.
     Sheet generates WBH TL profile, number of very large / large / etc
     cities, SDB fleet size and number of defense battalions.
     
Obviously, the programs are intended that data from earlier stages of 
the design sequence are used in later steps (UWP from one stage is used 
when detailing startport, census data etc.

I was going to forget about a Pascal program and just use these very 
efficient spreadsheets to detail the system, but I decided that I 
wanted a few more visual features and to be able to use a "random 
seed" so that I got the same data each time I visited a system without 
having to save hundreds of 383 k spreadsheets!.

(I did work out how to use random seeds to generate reproducible dice 
rolls using the Tools / Data analysis (add-in) or equivalent RANDOM 
macro command, but it seemed like a lot of hard work to make the the 
many macros use these dice rolls rather than a simple RAND).

specifically on the issue of terraforming.  As an armchair planetologist
of more ecological bent (as opposed to my brother\'s greater emphasis on
physical parameters), the entire structure of the existing debate (and of
a good bit of the referenced canon) on this topic disturbs me greatly.

To speak of "atmospheric" terraforming, or "one-hemisphere" terraforming,
is grossly absurd.  A planet is a cohesive *system*; matter and energy are
continuously and pervasively exchanged between lithosphere, hydrosphere,
atmosphere, and space along inumerable pathways.  To put it another way,
"You can\'t change one thing."  Playing with a planet is like playing
that old game pick-up-sticks; anything you modify is almost certain to
have effects which ripple out into all other aspects of the planet, and
conversely unmodified aspects of the planet will "push back" against any
changes you make to one system.

Thus, "atmospheric terraforming" is an absurdity; you *can\'t* modify the
atmosphere significantly without also modifying oceans and land, and if
you don\'t take this into account, your terraforming will fail.  Similarly,
one-hex or one-hemisphere "terraforming" is silly; what\'s going to keep
the wrong air/water/animals/whatever out of your "safe area?"

Note that in this definition of terraforming I specifically *exclude*
projects such as bulk irrigation a la the Solomani Sahara effort;
terraforming is the process of taking an uninhabitable (or nearly so)
world and making it more suitable to an earthlike ecology.  If we allow
terraforming to include simple desert irrigation, then it\'s a TL 0
technology invented in Mesopotamia; everything since has been simple
scale-ups and efficiency improvements. 

I also strongly disagree with the MT-era assertion that terraforming small
worlds is easier than terraforming larger worlds.  Size *helps*, all other
things being equal, as there\'s a deeper gravity well to hold onto an
atmosphere.  This is for the common case of "pumping up" a low-atmosphere
world like Mars, of course, but that\'s really by far the most plausible
case; terraforming Venus is infinitely harder than terraforming Mars, and
there are likely to be enough Marses in the galaxy that nobody need bother
with the Venuses.

Ah, praise from my public :)

I try to write adventures that are challenging and don\'t require combat.
My ultimate goal is to run "Casablanca" on an occupied world during the 5FW.  

I\'m currently in a creative mood.. what would people want to see me write
for JTAS?  Sample plots, character hooks.. you tell me and I\'ll write it.

Weelll...he *does* have a 4-figure IQ, and he\'s had *300000 years* to catch

Sorry, but I was only about 12 when I started playing Traveller, and I\'m pretty 
sure I could handle picking a number between 1 and 365 without breaking into a 
sweat. Actually, the way most people did it was to convert their own birthdays 
into the Imperial format.

Or have IQs dropped over the last 15 years?

	I\'ve long used additional weight/power consumption/cost penalties

+10% weight and power consumption, and +40% cost, in addition to +1 
to all TL requirements. This makes some grav applications more

This probably isn\'t true for Pathfinder - Mars is fairly well studied and
Pathfinder has a small instrument suite compared to Viking (it\'s more of a
technology demonstrator than a full-fledged science mission.)

However, it\'s very true for science in general - especially for things like
extrasolar planets. Three years ago if Traveller\'s planet generation system
had produced gas giants in 0.05 AU orbits it would have been laughable...

Assuming you mean stellar types and not positions of known stars, then

I\'d be tempted to save it for a (bigger and better?) replacement for 
WBH, but if that\'s not going to happen within the next 12-15 months, 
perhaps it should be in the main book.  Put me down as a tentative "no".

>  4)  Any other opinion of relevance?

A few:

a. Star generation really should be based on the habitability of the
   mainworld, rather than fixed up later.

b. I\'m of the opinion that only star systems with planetary bodies are
   shown on the map, but that there lots more of no relevance to us.
   (This goes along with my belief that the 2D maps are maps of
   jumpspace connections, rather than normal space which is 3D).
   As a result, I\'m not too bothered about there being inaccurate
   proportions of star types, so long as rare types are not very common.
   I can see that this might bother other people, though.

c. To do with world generation, rather than system generation:  There
   really ought to be a conversion algorithm to get from M:1100 data to
   M:0.

d. The main reason that I think the expanded gen. can wait until it gets
   its own book is that the information produced by it is not really all
   that exciting.  It needs added detail that would take up too much
   space in the main rulebook (like customs, resources, etc).

e. If done in its own book, how about more on the ecology of worlds?

Well, first of all, I\'d like to say that I may stop contributing to
this thread soon, as I find myself repeating the same stuff over and over.
By no means is that your fault, Rupert.

If you had a vacc suit, where the suit itself was TL 14 and 
everything else was TL 12, what would you call it? My argument
is (I think this is the right term) simply a semantic one - you
and I have different idea of what constitutes a "vacc suit".

Yes, TL 13+ suits are self sealing. Yes, they are less encumbering, but
it is questionable how much you\'d actually notice it, IMO. Integral
HUDs are listed, in MT, as being either TL10+ or TL14+, depending on
whether you look at the text or the tables, so this is again, a
questionable issue.

And again, I\'m not talking about computers, communicators, HUDs or PLSS
units. I\'m talking strictly about vacc suits, which, depending on
how you want to slice things, don\'t include any of those items.
 TL 12 HUD, TL 14 suit, TL 12 PLSS, maybe a TL13 experimental communicator...
what\'s the TL?

Anyways, I\'ve devolved from intelligent argument to contradiction,
so I will stand by my position that you could have TL14 bits
popping up here and there without an overall TL 14 manufacturing
base (well, assuming you\'re at TL 12).

I feel it necessary to quote another post from the same digest:

This is the basic problem. TL has, at its core, no clear definition.
We can debate, argue, discuss and kibitz all we want, but these
discussions are essentially meaningless without some sort of definition
of what TL is. Then again, even if we defined TL, it would likely be
such a large and loose definition that it wouldn\'t be useful anyways.

I wonder what TL is necessary to engage in near-C rock dropping...?

    'body' => 'There\'s been a lot of talk about just what the TL the RoM achieved.
Here\'s my take (anoted)

We know that:
    -2431  Terrans discover J-1 (TL 9) [1]
    -2408  First Interstellar War ends, Terrans TL 10 [1]
    -2398  Terrans discover {develop} J-2 (TL 11) [1]
    -2389  Terran Navy introduces synaptic robots (TL 12) [2, 3]
    date uncertain  Terrans develop J-3 during 9th Interstellar War (TL 12)
[4, 5]
    -2235  Start of Nth Interstellar War [2, 5]
    -2204  Terran Confederation disolved, Rule of Man begins [2]
    -1776  Rule of Man collapses [2]
Just from these we get the Terrans advancing from TL 9 to TL 11 in just
33 years, not really too suprising, they just copied the Vilani. But then they
started to use elements of TL 12 within 11 years of this; most likely this was
just a case of applying existing Vilani tech in a way the Vilani hadn\'t.
However they were clearly into TL 12 in less than 165 years (they had J-3
before the beginning of the Nth Interstellar War).

Extrapolated facts: (I\'m being cautious here)
During the Rule of Man the former Vilani worlds moved to Terrans standards,
not the other way round (hence the 3rd Imperium uses Terran SI units, a
circle of 360 degrees, Galanglic becomes the \'universal\' language, base 10
numbering system, the Terran calendar and temporal system becomes the
standard; the circle and calendar are very convinicing here, the base 10 
system the least). Therefore, rather than modifing Terran systems to match
the Vilani, the Vilani moved their systems to match the Terrans.

From this, and the ingrained technological inertia of the Vilani at the time;
I think it can safely be assumed the the worlds of the former Ziru Sirka did
not advance technologically in any great degree during the Rule of Man,
therefore TL 11 to 12 can be assumed for these worlds.

However I do not feel that this is neccessarily true for the former worlds of
the Terran Confederation. Certainly the Terrans would have now more
completely absorbed Vilani technology; and most certainly they would
have not maintained their breakneck technological progress. However it is
not unbelievable that these worlds could have achieved TL 13 during the
latter period of the Rule of Man. Now if this is the case why does the 3rd
Imperium of 1100 commonly believe that they were TL 12. This can be
taken two ways.
Firstly the Rule of Man did not achieve TL 13.
  Okay, this is simple, but T4 is now indicating that the Rule of Man\'s
  technology exceeded that of the early 3rd Imperium, which we know
   was a reasonably mature TL 12 culture (achieved TL 12 in -150 [1])

The second option is that the 3rd Imerium of 1100 has some reason to
portray the Rule of Man as a technological inferior to the early
3rd Imperium.
    Why would they? To undermine Solomani claims to superiority.
    Could this be done? yes, it would be hard, but not as hard as might be
    thought. If one assumes that such a policy would have started in the
    mid 600\'s under Emperor Zharkirov, it would be very possible to have
    changed public perceptions by 1100. Even if it were started by Empress
    Margaret II in the early 900\'s it would still be quite possible, especially
    with the Solomani Rim War making it a matter of national security.

Now if one takes the second option, one can intergrate M:0 with older
canon without any radical changes. However in this case the Rule of
Man\'s maximum tech level can not go above TL 13, and this must be
restricted to the last 100 or so years of the Rule of Man (any more than
this becomes to hard to \'hide\'). Note here it is important to note that the
sources don\'t state that the Rule of Man did not achieve TL 13, just that
they did achieve TL 12. This may seem like just a minor semantic
argument, but it exactly these type of minor semantic arguments which
could have reshaped the public perceptions of the Rule of Man\'s TL in
the late 3rd Imperium.

Now for my take on it all. The Rule of Man did achieve TL 13 in its
final stages, with the exception of J-4, which they didn\'t get (the absence
of J-4 drives makes it much easier for them to be portrayed as only TL 12
at a later date). Their genetic and biological sciences were even more
advanced than this, probably TL 14. However TL 13 was restricted to
the former Terran Confederation and never became a mature TL and was
therefore easily lost during the Long Night.

Nice idea but I always found that trying to place real stars on the 2D
Traveler star maps never worked. eg. You can place all sorts of stars the
correct distance from Terra but the distances between these other stars is
often way off.

How about a possible solution to this, and other problems...

All systems mapped in Traveller have at least 1 planet/asteriod belt which I
always took to mean that stars with no significant objects orbiting them were
not even mapped (there wouldn\'t be anything for anyone to want to go there
for!)  So if a \'real\' star doesn\'t exist in the Traveller universe maybe it
just doesn\'t have any planets.

Agreed, save that one of my players is a physicist, even though she teaches
Windows 95 and such now.  She gets a bit testy whenever the world data is
just too far from what she knows, and is willing to go get current
references if it seems to egregious.

Fix it, or at least include a few references to what you think "should" be
correct.

Yep.  That is how I see it too.  Provide the correct distributions, a fix

I want to have a definite system that expands well, so that my subsector
mapper can give decent results, but as  DM, I can easily and automatically
generate full data for the fifty planets that are likely to figure in a
typical game, and have a full data sheet like those in Knightfall or other
DGP products.

Basic: UWP, PBG, resources levels, perhaps infrastructure.
Extended: Adds stellar types, number of planets, and basic info for each
Full: Includes all of the social and technological details, as well as
little goodies like trade tables, animal encounters, and social customs

Ethan makes a good point here.

If you mix and match between all the editions of the game, you can
rationalize just about anything. "Artificial intelligence" does not mean
the same thing in CT that it does in TNE, for instance. Using an obscure
reference in CT Book 8 and then trying to back it up with TNE\'s supposition
that low-autonomous AI appears at TL 13 pushes the envelope a bit.

Siding *against* tech levels in general is not a valid position. Traveller
posits tech levels and those of us who play the game have learned to live
with them.

You\'re not supporting either Douglas or Leroy with your comment. You\'re
merely stating that you think TL shouldn\'t even be an issue. So, by that
argument I guess, I should just make TL-16 stuff available in the M:0
Imperium, too. Hell, how about TL-17, or 18. What the heck!

The basic point being argued here is that Traveller has established a
linear progression throughout its history that leads to an Imperial
technical "maximum" of 15 during the CT era. There was a regression during
the Long Night and then a recovery afterwards. If you muck with the balance
of power too much, however, which IMO is what Leroy is suggesting with his
TL-16 RoM, you risk making the whole Traveller background irrelevent.

Unfortunately, the only place you\'re likely to find TL-15 artifacts in the
M:0 or earlier setting is at an Ancients site. They should be *that* rare.
If you don\'t like the tech levels available in M:0, I highly recommend you
conduct a classic, Rebellion or New-Era campaign.

"Wanting" TL-15 stuff just isn\'t a very good justification for scrambling
canonical Traveller history.

I don\'t see how you can say there\'s NO consensus. There\'s NO consensus on
*anything* in Traveller. How many different ways can you describe a
law-level 9, a government level 7 or even an atmosphere of standard tainted
(7)? Dozens of ways! Most of it\'s wide open to interpretation. Tech level
provides us with a metric by which we can determine generally what a world
can manufacture and therefore what\'s generally available there. Of course
TL-15 stuff is available on TL-7 worlds, but for whatever reason, that
world does not produce TL-15 goods itself.

In my campaign, TL is generally used as a meter to determine what is
locally manufactured. With free traders flying here and yonder with goods
from world to world, however, goods of almost any TL can be purchased on a
world of starport of C or greater with a population above the "Lo" trade
code. Perhaps at a higher price, but they\'re available.

TL is a useful statistic even if the concept itself is inherently flawed.

Just to say -

1) Leroy, thank you for posting your references.

2) Having read them, I have to state that I have come to the view that the
RoM is TL12 with limited TL13 in some areas like medical science. However...

3)...in my personal Traveller Universe, the Old Earth Union (OEU) continues
to develop against a backdrop of collapsing trade and regression, and
achieves TL13 technology. Unlike the 3i, the OEU is not expansionist to the
same degree, as they want nothing to do with those \'hidebound\' Vilani who
caused the Empire to collapse. (The seed for the xenophobia that is the
Solomani Party). They also have several largish pocket empires (such as the
Vegans) and the Aslan to handle. Most expansion is to Rimward, away from
the Vilani.

The 3i Scout service discovers evidence of the higher technology possessed
by the Solomani, and Cleon invokes his famous \'this far but no farther\'
routine on the Rimward expansion. The Imperium seeks to consolidate and
raise its technology until it feels confident to absorb (annexe!) Terra in
588. (Having seen what damage the Terran techology advantage gave against
the Vilani, the J4 vessels are all owned by the Terran Military, and not
overtly used, leading to rumours of Terran commanders being lucky and being
in the right place at the right time.)

IMO, of course.

Thanks, however, I do not see this as a "canon" debate.  I see it is a
a case of what J.P. wants me to describe as an archaeological paradigm
discussion (directed at you, as a matter of fact).  He sees it as the
same kind of reasoning as dealing with (if I have this correct) the issue
of Columbus discovered America, and therefore no artifacts found can be
pre-Columbian.  Personally, I think that is too "brainy."

It is simple.  There are scant references to the Rule of Man in the "canon"
of Traveller, and given that there are scant references, there is really
_no_ interpretation that is absolutely right.  Enter T4.  Now it is "canon"
and people don\'t like it because it doesn\'t agree with all that imagination
that _they_ supplied given a rather large hole.  This has been the story
of Traveller and it\'s subsequent generations.  Here\'s an example.

Traveller gets published in 1977.  In 1979 (according to my copy), JTAS#1
gets published.  (So does Adventure #1 Kinunir, but for this argument,
assume that JTAS was first.  It may have been, but I don\'t care.  Just
humor me.)

On Page 12 (of my minted, Marc Miller autographed copy) of Journal of the
Travellers\' Aid Society #1, "Rescue on Ruie" states:

    "Ruie (0209 - C776977-7) is a balkanized, industrialized, and
     very autonomous world on the frontiers of the Imperium.  A
     former Lost Colony, it had worked itself up to tech level 5
     by the time it was rediscovered by the Scout Service 31 years
     ago."

Now don\'t get me wrong, I am _not_ bashing Jeffery May and his fine Amber
Zone from JTAS #1.  We played it.  It was fun.  etc. etc. etc.

The arguments I have seen here that somehow there can only be _one_ Traveller
are not at all persuasive.  I just invented a fictional character.  Call
him/her Edsel Gouch.  Edsel contends that the Third Imperium is presently at
1100 and the Scouts recontacted Ruie in 1069.  (With no library data to
go on, Edsel is right.  I further assume that there was nothing in the
first three books to discount Edsel.  These assumptions are not
unreasonable.)

Edsel has to run a campaign for his players and concludes that the Third
Imperium only rediscovered Jump Drive 50 years ago, the Imperium is 20
parsecs across, and that a dozen worlds were colonized 100 years ago before
the "Fall of Man".  Now, Edsel\'s campaign runs along just fine, and then
along come these "new" resources for Traveller.  Hmmm ... major disagreement.
Edsel and all of his/her players are caught up in this debate about the
"canonality" of this Adventure 1: Kinunir, and they refuse to accept any
more work from that source (GDW).  Yet they continue to buy/read/discuss/
argue/conjecture about the GDW material in the context of Edsel\'s universe.

Whether I like the material or not, CT, MT, TNE, and now T4 are the "canon"
from which I come.  The previous three editions are all out of print, no
longer supported by the companies that produced them, and are all fair game
for having revisions applied.  I am happy that a writer is trying to
satisfy me, a CT holdout, an MT holdout, and a TNE holdout.  I am unhappy
that they can\'t do the impossible--(recursively reference the last sentence
for the rest of this one.)

At least I can\'t fault them for trying.

BTW, I did say that I was finished with this thread.  However, if someone
_can_ clearly come up with a flat out statement in the published sources
that states the RoM _was_ only TL12, I would like to see an annotated
bibliography as thorough as ours was.  The fact is, the RoM TL issue is
fair game for any writer, whether or not they ever believed it from the
start (like I did).

Also, trying to keep this short:

  1) Terra, when it started Terraforming Mars, was _not_ a member of
     the Imperium.  Membership came later when it joined in 588.  So
     Martian terraforming is _not_ Imperial, and _atmospheric_ terra-
     forming can _not_ be done at a lower level, without the force
     walls I described earlier.  What tech is it that you can atm
     terraform a single hex, and not have the atmosphere mix?  Hmmm.

  2) Japan does not necessarily retain any pre-emininence in the future
     of Terra.  There are already signs that it may be fading from
     prominence.  The argument that they wouldn\'t have domed cities
     doesn\'t hold water given a vaccum of historical fact in the
     intervening 50, 100, or even 200+ years of future history that
     we do not yet know.

  3) Ishimshulgi _is_ an Imperial project, which as several of you
     have pointed out, the Imperium was TL14 at the time it attempted
     to do Ishimshulgi.  They failed _because_ they did not possess
     the tech to do _atmospheric_ terraforming, like that done to
     Mars by pre-Imperial Terra.

Speak for yourself and a few others.  Personally, I am happy with a
consistent T4 background that is compatible with previous eras.  Note
that I did _not_ say it was the only background, but it is the one that
I can go to the store and buy off the shelf.

Let\'s see how many rise to my challenge above.  I am happy to see that
nobody is still purporting that the Rule of Man was merely TL12 and no
exceptions to that.  Funny--it sure feels a lot easier to issue those
challenges than to rise to them.

Thank you for making me feel welcome to discuss this here.  For some, it
would seem that I have stepped in on some private turf, and the guardian
at the gate is saying, "None shall pass!"

Again, I am not out to offend in any way.  A discussion of the quotes is
fair game, and (academically) I expect there to be a _full_ quoting and
a separate interpretative section, as we did.  I don\'t think this is too
much to ask from people that _demand_ sources.

You\'re a PhD (I presume).  TML strikes me as an unrefereed journal.  It
strikes me that it could (to be _really_ useful) take a lesson from the
refereed journals.  Thoughts?

Your posts always come across as well thought out, but I also notice that
you don\'t post as much either.  Unfortunately, I have no such luxury.
(Up to 120 mph now.)  Actually, (a compliment) when I read your posts,
my mind always inserts the voice of Dr. Theopolis from Buck Rogers when
scanning your words.  Very soft, reasoning voice. :)


>  Again - thanks for posting your evidence - it made for a very

I was really hoping to get people to look at the evidence and throw off
the large consensus that gets established when people chat.  I worry about
the new folks being introduced to the game for the first time (like we
were) and listening in on what gets said here.

Having more fun than I ought to,

No, but there is an increasing tendancy for kids to want it all on a plate,
with no effort of real initiative. (Ask my wife if you don\'t believe me!

Vilani culturally, without the co-operation! ;-)

I like this.  I think I will do this regardless of how the new system goes.

The way we generate characters means that I like having lots of events in a
term.  I rarely require players to roll many dice during generation,
instead, I roll the dice, and then tell the player the result of the term.
If they do not like it, then we negotiate.  This way, anything they do not
care about, like getting promoted for most character concepts, goes as the
dice say, but anything important goes according to the character concept.
I usually do not ask them the character concept first, as that way, they
can change as the dice talk.

I have found that any result they care about is meaningful to the
character, and anything else adds background color.

Interesting that this came up. I have two comments.

First of all, in my campaign, the players are about three months in game
time from hitting their first aging rolls. We use TNE rules, so there is
the physical fitness program option that gives you a nigh-impossible chance
at reducing the aging effects. They engaged me in about a half-hour
conversation about making the aging rolls less severe with the caviat that
they feel less inclined to play a character over a long period of time if
they have to suffer aging effects. I countered that they have also gained a
fair load of skill experience which has made them stronger. In short, they
may become slightly physically weaker, but they will also be wiser.

Secondly, the munchkin effect: After issuing experience for several years
of roleplaying time, characters slowly become quite formidable. We have now
completed almost a "term" (four years) of playing time with these
characters and they have become vastly improved over that time. One
character has gained *eight* levels of skill in various areas. That would
be about the equivalent of the first-term in a new career in TNE rules. My
fear is that they will slowly evolve into munchkin characters, but at the
same time, I already use an experience system that\'s more stingy than the
one suggested in the TNE main rulebook.

Just a couple of observations from a ref who still *is* running the same
group of characters after a long period of time.

Best,

Damn straight! Ecological processes are, at their heart, chemical in
nature, and ALL chemical reactions are in dynamic equilibrium. Some
reactions, to be sure, are rather heavily weighted to one side or the
other (the little one of nitroglycerin + shock or heat comes to mind), but
all are subject to equilibria.

When you start dealing with things like oceans (gigantic buffer
solutions), soil (gigantic buffer solutions, just a bit chunkier), and
biota (all SORTS of catalytic reactions), and constant input of energy
(sunlight, heat from the core) you\'re absolutely right that they
\'push back\', they push back, they change enormously sometimes, with
smaller input than you would think, and on and on. A planetary ecosphere
is probably the single most complex chemical system we will ever
encounter.

That\'s why the terraforming we\'re going to be doing for a long time will
be limited to heating the place up, or really small scale things like
making deserts where there used to be grasslands. Tucson\'s biggest health
problem at the turn of the century? Malaria, which came form the mosquitos
living in the swamps. What swamps? The ones around the rivers that aren\'t
there anymore. 

Humans have been pretty good at altering their environment for a long time
now; often with disastrous results. Look at the Mayans...most current
theories for the decline of their civilization include over-irrigation,
and depletion of farmlands as a cause.

Well, you could always do what my first dungeonmaster did with our
characters when they got that powerful...took \'em away and made them
NPC\'s. That\'s drastic, course, and it helped that he was moving 600 miles
away at the time, but at the time they were retired they were starting to
have effects on politics and suchlike over a very large area. They were
bit players on that scale, but very powerful on the PC scale. They became
the patrons of the new group of players he picked up where he went.

Besides, by that point they\'re still not munchkins, merely very powerful
player characters, who will need to be kept on a level playing field; just
rachet up the NPC\'s power and influence to match.

Force them to start playing in the planetary and subsector politics,
because the powers that be will probably not tolerate free agents of that
power; no matter how powerful the individuals, on a grander playing scale
they can be as helpless as fresh minted newbies. They\'ll be forced to
choose sides in various matters, and they may make big friends and big
enemies.

It is worth noting (again) that the Technooogy rating system in 
Traveller is (and has always been) so badly flawed as to be *almost* 
completely meaningless and *almost* completely unusable.

It *might* (if, as some have suggested) be considered applicable to a 
Vilani style conservative culture (but even *that* is stretching it), 
but it simply does *not* work for anything else.

The major reasons are twofold --

1) The attempt to "rate" technology with one number (as for the Basic 
Game) -- a completely ridiculous concept.

2) The categories into which technology is split when using the more 
detailed ("advanced") system. 

3) Rating inventions rather than capabilities (this is *very* Vilani 
and completely anti-Terran).

For example, there is no practical difference between TL4 and TL5 as 
far as Mechanical technology *capabilities* are concerned -- a number 
of excellent SF Books have been written (Harrison, Turtledove et al) 
in recent years whereby Time Travellers give the CSA Sten Guns/K-47s 
- -- and these are not fantasy, the mechanical (and related) technology 
of the 1860s is quite up to producing such items. In fact, it is my 
understanding that a Sten Gun or AK-47 (or even an M-16) is 
mechanically *simpler* to produce than, say, a Lee Enfield SMLE .303 
Bolt Action Rifle ... as that latter requires a *lot* of expensive 
and time consuming precision machining, while Sten Guns and AKs are 
basically mostly stampings.

I have previously suggested that a more sensible method of rating 
technology would be to abandon the (Vilani specific) categories that 
exist at present and adopt more reasonable ones, such as --

Energy Generation
Electrics/Electronics
Material Science
Communications
Mechanical
Production

(and probably some others, I don\'t have my notes handy).

Some of these categories would "top out" -- Mechanical, for example, 
probably doesn\'t improve once you develop precision machining -- what 
occurs thereafter are improvements in *materials* and *production*.

Even there, any such system is fraught with difficulties based on 
assumptions that really cannot be supported. One of the major ones is 
that there is a necessary progression from one TL to the next -- that 
is, the assumption (say) that to reach TL14 (either overall or in an 
individual area) you need to actually complete *all* of TLs/1-13. 
While that may be the way it historically occurred on Terra or Vland, 
does this mean (since most of the applications areas are 
technological capability rather than *necessarily* scientific 
theoretical based) that it will necessarily *always* be the case?

It seems to me that the current debate over whether the TL14 stuff 
found in Milieu 0 dating back to the RoM (and all technology debates, 
for that matter) are based on these sorts of unproven and unlikely 
assumptions.

Well, I know that a sitgnificant number on the list don\'t agree with 
me, but, hey, that\'s my 2c worth!

You know, being a 17-year old player of Traveller, and RPGs in general,
a lot of the time I see many people on this list exposing a real bias
towards younger players.  Now, while some players of a young gae may be
prone to munchkinism, and not being able to figure things out, I think
it is a gross injustic to say that all young gamers can\'t figure out how
to do a birthday.

Personally, I\'ve found through my 8 years of RPG experience that gamers
of all ages are intelligent enought o figure things out when rules
aren\'t there to cover it.  And, there is a proportion of both young and
old gamers that just want the rules to dictate everything.  

If a person roleplays in the first place it demonstrates a distinct
creativity and imagination, and initiative as well.  

You say that a good analogy is your wife\'s teaching of math.  First of
all, how many in your wife\'s class are RPG players, and second,
comapring Math and Traveller (and school and Traveller) is hardly the
same.  One is a challenge for some people, andnot for others.  Also,
Traveller is a recreational activity, and, being in school at the moment
I know that many times I\'ve a lot more willing to spend time learning
something I *want* to learn, rather than what I amn forced to learn at
school.  

In summary, in every age group of RPG players you can find those that
need rules explained, and have to have everything \'all on a plate\'. 
However, to state that it only applies to younger players of Traveller,
as I have seen time and again on this list is not only inaccurate, but
insulting.

Thank you,

    Absolutely!  From a Game persepective this is like asking if magical
treasures are a big deal in AD&D. <GAG> This is a game of star travelling
adventure.  The LEAST we can do is get this right. ;)

> 2)  What should happen to the existing data in print and ftp?
    Stick it in a canon and fire it off to somewhere that the stars never
shine? <grin> It\'s wrong, it needs to be fixed.  Personally I\'d yank it from
the printed Survey\'s and reserve this for expanded system generation.

> 3)  How much of an Expanded Generation System is need?
    I want the ability to detail everything in that Star System and expand the
UWP stats al a DGP\'s World Builder\'s Handbook.  I should be able to take a
world figure out where the tectonic plates are, how the mountain ranges and
shape of continents effect current and wind flows and how that in turn creates
the various types of terrain on the planet.  I want to be able to take the UWP
and expand it out to the point I can figure out how the government works and
the impact of Law Levels and technology on the planet.  Heck some tables for
generating some important events in the planet\'s history would be wonderful so
I\'d have to reinvent the wheel every time.  And rules on how to build the
planetary culture should be there as well.  Local naming conventions guidelines
for terrain and other thing.  In short, I want it ALL and I wouldn\'t mind
seeing a book entirely dedicated to developing all of this. ;)

> 4)  Any other opinion of relevance?
    This all needs to be put together, done well and gotten out on the shelves
ASAP!  We "old farts" on the mailing list are used to having to have to do all
of this and have tons of old Traveller resources at our disposal.  How many
times do you see people refering o copies of the Alien\'s Modules or Vilani &
Vargr or Solomani & Aslan.  All books out of print for over a DECADE!  New
players and Traveller GM\'s don\'t have these resources, and they need them or
something like them NOW!  That is IF we all want Traveller to grow and prosper,
which I presume Marc and the rest of us really want to have happen. ;)

  Say Virus _did_ propogate as canon would have it.  Would nanites be an
effective defense against it? 

2) What\'s a good displacement tonnage figure for a medium-sized asteroid?

3) What would be the most efficient means of manuevering such an asteroid
in a solar system?

4) Would you even consider building a jump engine capable of shoving that
large a chunk of rock through j-space?  (I suppose that, if the Imperials
had 50 000 dt battleriders running around, they could do just about
anything with j-engines...)

5) What kind of manufacturing capability would be required to handle the
construction of such a huge engine?

Perhaps, just as a little brain-teaser for the more historically-inclined,

	If you\'re designing asteroid hulls, there are rules for that in the new
version of FF&S. FWIW, rock tends to be around 5t/m3. Cost for tunneling is
given in MT or in the meson gun deep site rules in FF&S, but they\'re
different. Take your pick. IIRC, FF&S2 followed closer to the MT costs than
the FF&S costs, but I won\'t swear to it.

	Count me AGAINST. I\'d rather not be counted with those who ignore the
explicit statements identifying the highest TL achieved by the RoM, and
pull a bunch of obscure or casual references that can be stretched into a
possible interpretation supporting the opposite. And using the T4
references which are in question to support the T4 references which are in
question ... seems somewhat circular to me. But then logic isn\'t taught in
many schools nowadays.

	Not that I\'m arguing about the text of the references themselves. But as
others have pointed out, they\'re quite wide open to interpretation. Occam\'s
razor would slice in the direction of the interpretation that supports the
flat-out, explicit statements about the max TL of the RoM.

Yours was the best post I\'ve seen so far on the Rule of Man Tech Level
debate, and you\'re dissing them! Keep it up. 
I\'m certain that a lot of people\'s arguments about \'canon\' matching
between different eras would be unnecessary if people would just
understand the role that propaganda plays in human
societies...everybody knows the phrase \'history is written by the
winners\', and the attendant cynicism at \'official history\'; but most of
us haven\'t connected that with the fact that the West, and particularly
the USA, *are* the winners of the major conflicts of the 20th century. 

The thing that makes the Imperium such a wonderful setting for me is its 
hard-science, high-tech, almost *high-camp* insistence on a fictional 
medieval and authoritarian society, which maintains its own interests as
paramount but couldn\'t care less about individual citizens. It has to be
the most *brilliant* satire on 20th Century Western societies (not
pointing any particular finger at the USA), whether intentional or no. 

So I\'d like to see a lot more humour and, yes, *heart* in Traveller.
Let\'s forgive each other for genuine mistakes made in good faith, and
accept criticism for what it is, even if we don\'t agree with it. 

And let\'s keep on crafting a universe we all love.

EXCELLENT POST!!!!!

this is a great reading of whatever happened to Terra.. stung by the fall
of the Rule of Man, she licked her wounds and slowly rebuilt..

This gives me about 100 scernario ideas.. I urge you to write this up for
JTAS.

"Below is a chart of the tech levels achieved by the major interstellar

So Terra was TL16 when the TL13 Imperium conquered it, dropped to TL14 for
the Solomani Rim War, and then climbed back to TL15 at the same pace as the
rest of the Imperium?

The quote remains.  "Several" cities domed themselves.  Not a wit of

I don\'t think anyone ever made a sweeping declaration the the RoM was a
flat TL12.  I made the case very early on for some TL13 worlds to exist at
the beginning of Twilight, and have agreed all along that Solomani
medical/genetic technology was by far their best industry.  You however
were claiming a common TL16, with genetic skill comprable to the Ancients!

No, we just ask that you act according as we do, and back up your theories
from the start. Also, please refrain from insulting people.

I looked at the evidence, read the sources you quoted and found that not
only did they not support your conclusions, but a careful reading reveled
more support for a TL12 Terra.  Several people have agreed with the theory
that the RoM was TL12, with experimental TL14 medical knowledge.

I\'ve always assumed from my MT days when encumberance obviously had 
little to do with mass (how else could you say that the average

I see your point - when I see \'TL14 Vacc Suit\' I assume that (almost) 
all of it will be made at TL14, where (I presume) you see the Suit as 
being the actual coverall listed in the equipment lists, or something 
similar. As to your mongrel example suit - I have no idea what its TL 
is 13+-1?

There are enormous differences between a TL 12 and a TL 14 vac suit.
Moreover, a vacc suit is not a single technology. To build one you must
have advanced materials, manufacturing, environmental engineering,
computer, electronics, power, and gravitics technology; simply being
advanced in one field wouldn\'t be enough. A vac suit is not like a lump of
bonded superdense, or even a jump drive. It is a complex system of
interacting technologies.

>Who says they\'re TL-14? What exactly separates a TL-14 vacc suit
>from a TL-12 or 13 one, specifically??

From page 16 of Central Supply Catalog a TL 14 vac suit has a surface made
of smart materials which generate photoelectric energy and are
self-sealing, so their material technology is far in advance of TL 12.
Superdense layers which give an armor value of 5 are incorporated into the
material so the manufacturing technology is far in advance of TL 12. It has
water and air reclaiming facilities which operate "for as long as they care
to wear the suit" so the environmental technology is far in advance of TL
12. It contains miniaturized computers and power sources which are "beyond
current Imperium expertise". The grav modules are capable of NOE
maneuvering at 2 Gs so the grav and avionics technology are far in advance
of TL 12. TL 14 communications systems are 1/10 the size of TL 12 ones so
the electronics technology is far in advance of TL 12.

If it doesn\'t need fuel, power, or consumables, flies rings around an
air/raft, and ACR slugs bounce off it, then it\'s probably TL 14. I think
even an untrained observer would be able to notice things like this.
Recovering a working TL 14 vac suit would revolutionize TL 12 technology.

Yes, they are; the extent to which this is true is a matter of active
debate at the moment (the extreme position is the "Gaia Hypothesis"), but
all planetologists (ecologists, meteorologists, oceanologists, etc.) agree
that the global biosphere (both the hydro-, litho-, and atmosphere, *and*
the life contained in all three) constitute a system of numerous related
dynamic equilibria. 

The oxygen cycle is a very simple example; increase CO2 slightly, and
plant life increases, converting it back into O2;  increase O2 a bit, and
animal life increases, converting it back into CO2.  (Needless to say,
emitting vast quantities of CO2 from non-biological processes into the
atmosphere while simultaneously razing the equatorial rainforests and
killing vast areas of oceanic phytoplankton rather breaks this
equilibrium, but that\'s another topic...)

The oxygen cycle in turn interacts over longer timescales with the
lithosphere.  Volcanic outgassing can increase CO2, moving the system as a
whole away from equilibrium; conversely, a lack of crustal turnover can
slowly lock all free oxygen into carbonate rocks under the ocean beds,
inaccessible to life.  These in turn play off the closely related nitrogen
cycle, and so on and on.  An ecosystem is a web of balanced dynamic
systems, in equilibrium until disturbed.  If a disturbance is small, the
ecosystem will eventually regain the original equilibrium.  If large, it
may instead find a new equilibrium.

I beg to differ. The raw materials for a high tech society will probably be
even more easily available since they will already have been mined,
processed, and be sitting around for the taking in the form of abandoned
cars, buildings, railways, consumer products, and so on.

Now if a high tech society drops below the ability to support their
infrastructure or population, or cannot maintain food production,
transportation, manufacturing, health, education, or communication they
will have other problems, but raw materials ain\'t going to be one of them.

Andrew, I like the cut of your jib. Or whatever. 
I suggest an even simpler explanation, but along very similar lines to
yours; that at some time, the *official definition* of \'technological
level\' was changed to give a lot more emphasis to jump drive technology
than it had previously. That way, you could just issue an edict to all
Scout bases, AAB repositories, government departments, corporations, etc.
telling them that by Emperor\'s decree, a TL12 planet shall be one that has
*this* stuff rather than *this* stuff, giving a greater emphasis to jump
drives because you *know* that despite their outstanding computers and
robotics and their bloody *astounding* medical and genetic technologies,
the Solomani just can\'t be better than the Imperials...because the
Imperials define what \'better\' actually *means*! 

If this sounds far-fetched, try working as a government economist. 
About 18 months before an election, you get the Treasurer\'s
office on the blower, asking you what would happen to the deficit if the
official inflation estimates were to change by x percent...a few months
later, the inflation estimates come out, and guess what? 

"Oh Treasurer, what a wonderful deficit projection you have this budget." 
"Thank you, Financial Media. You may unzip me."

I agree that the Imperium is a wonderful setting, but I don\'t think it\'s a
satire of the twentieth century. If anything, it has the feel of the 18th
century, when young Western European empires had only loose control over a
large territorial claim. The limit of communications (the fastest ship) is
what it was in the pre-telegraph era. If the Imperium was a parody of the
twentieth century, then the emperor\'s eccentric antics would be instantly
beamed into everyone\'s home as entertainment. I think the attempt to invoke
a mercantilist, absolutist, high-tech parallel to the 17th & 18th century
European experience was VERY intentional, but that has nothing to do with
the twentieth century. Part of the problem with TNE and T-4 is that they\'ve
lost sight of this fact. But that\'s a whole other kettle of fish...

  Well, I have to disagree with you here.  As other have pointed out,
there are strong references in MT, including the timeline, that imply that
the max Terran TL is 12, at least as far as jump drive (there is no date
for a discovery of J4, for example).  I\'m sorry that I don\'t have my
Traveller material here in Denmark with me, so I can\'t give exact
footnotes, but the citations are in other posts.

  Now, as for T4 now being canon, well, we already have an entire book
(First Survey) rendered obsolete, as well as a major re-write of the main
rules and the replacement of the sector data in the main rules, so a minor
change to one line in EA does not seem to be out of line.  After all, MM
seems to pay attention to TML, and we can only hope he changes what (in my
and several other list members opinion) is clearly an error.
 
<<<Interesting example of using one JTAS entry for a campaign snipped>>>

  I don\'t follow you here - nothing later published in Traveller
contradicts the material in that entry, it merely expands on it.
Moreover, I think all on the TML would agree that there is considerable
room for varient campaigns, using a Traveller-like background, which is
how I would classify your example.

  By now, however, we have twenty years of Traveller material, and it is
much easier to flesh out a canon version of Traveller history (which in my
opinion is the only real reason to play the game).

  Well, my understanding is that T4 was intended as a concious effort to
take Traveller back to its CT roots, and in general that has been the case
(though I\'d argue it\'s more of a CT/MT mix).  It is certainly a rejection
of many of the changes made in TNE, both in terms of system and
technological assumptions (thruster plates, most notably).  

  Frankly, I do not think it impossible for T4 to be consistant with
previous versions of Traveller, since there is realatively little detailed
stuff on the M0 setting in CT, MT, and TNE.  As long as you get the big
picture right, there is plenty of room in T4 for new and interesting
things (I\'m looking forward to finding out more about the Imperium\'s early
opponents like the Chanestine Kingdom, for example).

  Again, someone has already posted MT references to this.  Moreover, the
general tenor of Rats & Cats and the Aliens: Solomani books, as well as
all of the examples you cite in your bibliography, convince me that the
low tech arguement makes more sense.

  Now, we do not have to agree, and I\'m sure your campaign will work well
that way, but from what I\'ve seen so far in TML posts, your arguements
have not convinced anyone else yet.

  I\'m not sure I follow you here.  The example you cite earlier about
single hex terraforming take place on worlds with existing atmosphere
(Earth, for example).  Others have already pointed out that the Martian
terraform can be done at TL12, at least according to World Builder\'s
Handbook.

  Moreover, we know Terra was not TL16+ when it joined the Imperium, and
the bulk of the Terraform took place under the Third Imperium (and was not
even finished ca. 1100).  While interesting (why the hell would they
terraform Mars, anyway?), I don\'t think it\'s an example that supports your
case.

  Again, as others have pointed out, only "some" cities had domes.  What
is important here is that we have not established that Earth\'s atmosphere
was "tainted" in the Traveller sense.  What the passages in Rats & Cats
suggest to me is minor industrial pollution, nothing more, which was
solved with the introduction of fusion.

  Aside from the fact that most of the Martian terraform was done
under the Third Imperium, I\'m not sure what you mean here, unless you are
suggesting that Terra was TL16+ while they were terraforming Mars?  That
is clearly false, given other data, as others have already pointed out.

  Well, as others pointed out, the material you posted suggested to most
folks what I think would be the consensus position - the Rule of Man was
TL12, with higher ratings in genetics and biotechnology (TL14, maybe).
Since that was what most folks already thought, the burden was on you to
convince folks otherwise.  If you had asked me last year (or even a few
months ago) what I though the tech level of the Rule of Man was, I\'d have
said 12 with 13 or 14 for medical and biotech.  I dare say most folks on
this list would agree with me, and the material you have cited so far has
not changed my mind.

  True, though I would suggest in the future that you confine your
arguements to the matter at hand, rather than make comments about folks
not knowing how to use WBH, for example.  Perhaps the reason what I write
sounds so reasonable is that you have not directed any comments like that
at me - folks tend to go off on rants when they feel personally insulted.
 
  As for others producing an annotated bibliography like yours, well, I
don\'t think there is a need - folks have shown how your material can be
easily interpreted to fit the esisting idea of Rule of Man at TL12 with
qualifiers.   In fact, since your ideas are so radical, I think it not
unreasonable to assume the burden is on you to convince us.

  Guilty - Doctorate in the History of Technology.  Actually, TML does
function (eventually) as a refereed journal - someone posts something,
others post corrections and suggestions, and usually some sort of
consensus emerges.  What most journals do is limit that discussion to who
they see as qualified in the field.  Since no schools are offering a
degree in Travellerology yet, we don\'t have a way of identifying
"qualified" vs. "unqualified" participants.

  Frankly, I think that is all to the good - the braod diversity of folks
who post here means that I learn something new constantly, especially
about biolegical and astrophysics, areas my education is weak in.  I hope
at least a few folks have learned a little something about history from me
- - I like to think so, anyway.

  Well, I actually have a life - fancy a roleplayer having a life!  I also
get the digest version of TML, so often by the time I feel like
responding, someone else already has done so, and there is no need.

  As for my voice, well, some friends have called it "California surfer
dude on speed" - my written prose is nothing like the way I actually
speak, aside from a tendency to go off on long lectures when someone pokes
my history buttons, and a weakness for using large or obscure words.  I
certainly sound _nothing_ like Dr. Theopolis.

  Well, I think what happened is that people looked at your evidence,
evaluated it, and decided thay did not agree.  Made for a good discussion
though.

  Frankly, I have never been a fan of Tech Levels in Traveller, aside from
their use as the answer to the question "What can we buy around here, Mr.
GM, sir?" (my players are very polite).  WBH has at least some added
flexibility in that regard - I tend to be much more flexible about tech
levels in my games, though by flexible I mean in minor technology, not
stuff like weapons systems, star drives, and the like.

  Ah well, enough of fighting with telnet - time for a nap (this message
took nearly four hours to do since my connection with Oregon kept breaking
- - good thing I could amuse myself with the Traveller Web Ring on my other
computer).

Fair point; but I don\'t think a table showing birthdays will be the kind of
thing that \'those people\' look for at the gaming shop, if they can find a
shop that doesn\'t shrink wrap ;-). Guns, spaceships and action, maybe....

Perhaps what we need is a starter edition of Traveller... not unlike the
version put out by WEG for Star Wars! (Not that I\'m the first to suggest
it!)

Peter,

First of all, I apologise - I should have avoided a sweeping generalisation
like that. (Especially as I started playing back when I was twelve).

Fair point.

Yes - role playing is more interesting than \'roll\' playing, and does
require the talents/abilities you describe above.

On the number of roleplayers in my wife\'s classes (say 300-400 students) I
couldn\'t tell you, but if my previous experience is anything to go by, in a
school of 1200 students we had around 15 to 20 roleplayers. (That\'s going
back 7 to 14 years ago). If you are hinting at the point \'how many younger
roleplayers do I know\' the answer is two in my present group.

I was not comparing math and Traveller as such, but rather the attitude
that I get to listen to stories about every night. The most common refrain
my wife quotes is "It\'s not fair!" or "Why do we have to work it out?". The
point that I was making is that there is an increasing tendancy amongst
younger people (and I include my own age group -mid-twenties-  in that) to
want everything laid out just so, without need for any real effort. If T4.1
starts to provide rules for absolutely everything it undermines the
roleplaying aspect of the game.

Now, Marc originally posted that he was putting a Birthday Table in to
account for younger players who were having difficulty picking a birthdate
for their character. This, to me, is pandering to those with a complete
lack of initiative and is a waste of space in the rules (IMO). Any player,
whatever age, that I have ever seen has been able to pick a number between
1 and 365...

>Thank you,

I don\'t believe that I actually stated that it \'only applies to younger
players\'. Munchinism and lack of initiative occur with all age groups.
Providing rules for every situation just undermines the roleplaying aspects
of games. My point was a sweeping generalisation on the attitudes in
society today, not a targeted condemnation of young players. If you read it
that way, I apologise for any offence given to you and any other younger
players.

However, I still stand by the opinion that standards and attitudes are
slipping generally (in the UK at least) and the willingness to put effort
in or show initiative has dropped. I base this view on seeing work
experience students at work, and feedback from my wife and her many
teaching friends. If that offends, we\'ll just have to agree to differ.

I prefer the explanation that Emperor Artemsus was using anagathics.

In MT anagathics were normally considered a TL 15 phenomenon, however
Travellers Digest #10 (DGP 1987) states in "Anagathics, the Drug of the
Ages" - by Joe Fugate Sr (pg 40-41) that cruder forms of anagathics
treatment existed at lower TL\'s.

"To begin tech level 12 anti-aging treatments
Formidable, Medical (and Edu ? or patients End ?), 1 day (hazardous,
fateful)
Referee: The cost for initial treatment is MCr 5.  Success means the
charecter will suffer no side-effects from the treatment.  On a mishap,
a side-effect has occured:

Snip of nasty side effects

This treatment is good for 30 days, subsequent treatments are
Formidable, Medical (and Edu ? or patients End ?), 1 hour (safe)
Referee: The cost is Cr 50,000. The treatment must be repeated if it
fails.

Aa TL 13 this is Difficult, Medical (and Edu ? or patients End ?), 1
day, (hazardous, fateful),Cost - 1 MCr; at TL 14 it is Routine, Medical
(and Edu ? or patients End ?), 1 hour, (hazardous)- Cost Cr 500,00, at
TL 15 true Anagathics in pill form are developed, it is Routine, Medical
(and Edu ? or patients End ?), 1 hour, (hazardous).  At TL\'s 13-15
subsequent months of treatment are Cr 20,000 a month.

It is true that canonical data indicates that the Imperium has a social
predjudice against the nobility using anagathics in Millieu 1100 but I
think that part of the reason this predjudice developed was because
early nobility _did_ use anagathics.  It is arguable that living 50% or
100% longer than their subjects is one of the things that lead to out of
touch nobles (and ultimately to the Imperial Civil War, after which the
customs discouraging noble use of anagathics were coadified.

If you are the Emperor you have nigh unlimited personal money and power,
it is not very surprising if some Emperors tried to live extended lives.
Even the riskyness of the treatment might be ignored by the
overconfident nobility we often see in the Imperium.

The world in question is Pradman/Lishun 0411 B6A587A-B
Reference \'The Flamming Eye\' pp42 (DPG)

"Atmosphere compositon unbreathable irritant gas mix."

"Pradman was first colonised circa -2200 (during the Rule of Man) as
the site of a terraforming experiment. Over the next few centuries,
the atmosphere was improved to the point it was breathable without
artificial asistance. Thousands of peple immigrated to the newly
terraformed world.
 Then the Long Night happened. Pradman\'s new improved
atmosphere was not far enough along to be self-sustaining, so it
slowly decayed over the next 1700 years to the point were it was
almost as bad as it had been before the terraforming. Scouts of the
new Third Imerium - much to their suprise - found a thriving low
tech culture on Pradman. Th locals had managed to develop a
sophisticated series of chemical and ritual protections from the
hostile environment, to the point that humans could survive, even
flourish, on the world"

Now, I\'ll try to avoid drawing to much from what is basically a fairly
minor obscure reference. However it does hint that the RoM did
experiment with terraforming to degree and was at the very least
partially successful. I don\'t think too much more can be drawn out
of it, but it does give one at least momentary pause to think.

Always happy to offer my two penn\'orth...

1. The needs of a large, full-colour map (like _Tarsus_) are different
   from a single-page B&W map.  Suggesting colours is good, since
   players can use colour on their own maps easier than shading; but the
   realities of production mean you need shading too.  Ideally, present
   a chart with the terrain name, suggested colour, and shading.  If
   possible, provide a sample map.

2. The needs of a worldmap are different from a regional map.  I think
   _World Tamer\'s Handbook_ handled this well, so I\'ll just direct you
   there (pp.19, 59-60, 78-79).  I don\'t know that you need to suggest
   colours for the more detailed terrain types, provided the "higher
   level" colours are sufficiently broad.  It\'s probably worth
   mentioning that the types used can be tailored to the individual
   world, so a worldmap of a 95% waterworld can indicate different
   depths even though that\'s overkill in other circumstances.

3. [A personal bugbear] Terrain types shouldn\'t neatly fill hexes!  They
   should go all over the place in the same way that coastlines do.
   This is especially true of mountain ranges.

4. Terrain should be divided into \'basic types\' (desert, ice, ocean)
   represented by solid areas of colour/shading; and \'features\' (city,
   starport, volcano) represented by solid black symbols.  Mountain
   ranges come somewhere in between.

5. For the shading, a balance needs to be maintained between clarity and
   looking good.  _Safari Ship_\'s map was very clear; the _Path of
   Tears_ maps looked better but the different-density dot patterns were
   not easy to distinguish.  _Tarsus_ looked too blocky.

There we are - all IMHO, of course.

As to the specific icons/colours/shadings used, I don\'t have fixed
opinions for most.  A few suggestions to be added to:

   Desert - yellow, widely-spaced dots.  Traditional.
   Ocean - blue (of course), solid shading if possible.

   Urban/Cities - black blobs.  On world maps, these will usually be
   dots or squares.
   Starports - black stars (or crossed circle).  I\'m not sure of the
   best way to distinguish quality; perhaps a combination of size and
   number of points would work.  Perhaps you don\'t need to.
   Mountains - black hats (^).
   Volcanos - black triangles pointing up.  Sort of filled-in mountains.

None of this is original, I\'m just picking the bits I like best.

Hope this starts the ball rolling,

    'topic' => 'Why redefine the RoM as TL 13? (long)',
    'body' => 'Well my objective here is to argue the subject line in the affirmative.

Why should the RoM be TL 13? All previous incarnations of Traveller
were set in or after the late 3rd Imperium; a period during which it matters
little in game and background terms whether the RoM achieved TL 12, 13,
14 or 15. The only relevance it has in these era is in the propaganda
struggle between the Solomani Confederation and 3rd Imperium. It must
be remembered that all previous material was written within that frame of
reference. Therefore until M:0, there was relatively little canon import
as to the TL of the RoM and this is reflected in the general lack of comment
on it in that material. Now as many people have pointed out, it is very
clearly implied (though never implictly stated, despite the table in the RC,
not even this unequivically states not TL 13) that the RoM was TL 12.
     [aside - Yes I know this is a seemingly meaningless semantic argument
                   but please bear with me]

So why then should this clear implication be ignored and revised to TL 13?
(Please note the revision is only to 13, not 14, 15, 16 etc.). Because the
overall thrust of the background for M:0 is that the RoM was superior to
the early 3rd Imperium (clearly and unequivically stated as TL 12). Now
it is possible to simply state that all the material published for M:0 is wrong
and the RoM was not superior; but this material, like or not, is now also
canon and so therefore whatever is done canon is going to be invalidated.
Remember that for T4 (and Traveller in general) to thrive, it must attract
new players who, by definition, do not have the extensive background
knowledge that \'seasoned\' CT, MT and TNE veterans do. Changing the
M:0 background in a radical fashion now places that at risk (just as
changing the earlier background places the continued support of those
\'seasoned veterans\' at risk). Yes I know it would have been much much
better if the M:0 material had stayed within the bounds of the earlier CT,
MT, and TNE material; but it didn\'t, so that unfortunatly, is that.

Therefore, in my oh so humble opinion, the best option is to reconcile the
new M:0 material with the older M:1100 material in the most believable
fashion with the minimum of change to either body of material. Bearing
in mind at all times that this is a game and that background is not a holy
book chiselled in stone for all eternity.

How to do this? I think I have postualted a workable solution already on
a number of occasions. To restate (in simple terms): the RoM did in fact
reach TL 13 in a limited geographic (astrographic?) region (namely, the
former Terran Confederation) near the end of the RoM, with the very
important exception of Jump drives (and gravitic tech) which remained
at TL 12. Then later when the Solomani movement and the 3rd Imperium
went their seperate ways, the 3rd Imperium \'doctored\' the records or
shifted the definition of TL 13 to prevent a propaganda victory for the
Solomani. (If desired, I\'ll repost my justifcation and reasoning for this
senario)

Pluses of this solution:
This change \'fixes\' most of the supposed canon violations in the published
M:0 material (I\'ll address the ones it doesn\'t later) and has minimal impact
on the earlier M:1100 material. I feel it can even add to the background of
M:1100 a little by adding a good conspiracy to play with.
The region of higher tech is limited enough and the period is short
enough to severly restrict the number of TL 13 items outside this limited
region and even in it.
It is a believable and possible senario and fits well with Cleon\'s \'don\'t go
past Massilia\' edict (from PE) as this is exactly where the higher tech
RoM worlds would have been.
It keeps high tech worlds out of the M:0 campaign area.

Minuses of this solution:
It does conflict with earlier material. However I feel the conflict is minor,
taking an ill defined period and redefining it in a believable manner to deal
with these conflicts. I would say it is no worse as a plot device than the
Virus or Ancients/Grandfather.
It opens up the possibility of large numbers of higher tech relics turning
up in adventures. This should not really be a problem, as realistically,
after 1700 years a TL 13 device is going to be just as broken and useful
(or more accurately, useless) as a TL 12 one; and the region of higher
tech is outside the M:0 campaign area. Again no worse than the Virus or
Ancients should have been. However, the examples of the Virus and
Ancients do show that care is neaded in this respect.
It does not address all the conflicts. This I will address now.

The conflicts it doesn\'t address (that I\'m aware of) are the TL 14+ weapons
in EA, the current manufacture TL 13 equipment in CSC; and lastly, the
dreaded EVA-14 in CSC and Anomolies (there is also the pure Solomani
Emperor of CT, MT verses the part Vilani of M:0, but I can\'t explain this
one away yet).

The TL 14+ weapons:
EA clearly implies that these are just theoretical studies by the late RoM as
to what might be possible at higher TL\'s. The phrase "Maximum Second
Imperium technology" in the TL 15 blurb? Take a pen and draw a line
through it; then hope for a contrite "opps" from IG :*) (treat it the same as
the AI robots in RC).

The current manfacture TL 13 equipment in CSC:
Harder than the EA\'s TL 14+ weapons. Here postualte the occasional late
TL 12 world in or near the 3rd Imperium (like the occasional TL 16 one
in M:1100). A bit chuncky as a solution I\'ll admit, but workable.

The Dreaded and Infamous EVA-14 (also known as the TL 14 vacc suit):
This is harder yet, in fact my solution is down right inelegant and requires
suspension of disbelief.
During the Long Night a pocket empire briefly achieved TL 14, I\'ll call
it the Diaz-Ek\'Mkana Empire. Explorers from this Empire roamed
through much of the former RoM during it\'s brief accendancy. For a
variety of reasons (xenophobia is one I can think of off the top of my
head, give me time and I\'ll come up with some more) they did not seek
to contact local inhabitants to any great degree. However they did
establish the occasional base on airless worlds and in deserted regions
(there\'s my explaination of \'Lock and Loot\') before their collapse.
Since they were basically ephemerial, they were not recognised as
a seperate entity by early 3rd Imperium archologists, who attributed
the occasional traces of them to the RoM in error.
Okay, so it\'s not a \'good\' or \'nice\' example of handwaving, but it does
work IMO.

Right, I\'ll now go and dig out my asbestoes underware and invite
comments :*). However I have to get back to the production of the
ISBA newsletter, so my responses may be a little slowish.

 I agree with that - the interesting characters I\'m thinking off (supporting
 the need for career changes) were:
 
 1 term Rogue, 4 term Army
 1/2 term Injured Marine, 5 term Agent
 
 All he changes were provoked by roll failures of soem sort except for
 
 4 term scout, 2 term merchant.
 
 I would also not allow two ship receipts if in T4.1 (still waiting for an
 rtf of the new rules to read).
 
 Maybe limit services to Marine, Navy, Army, and not scout (as they\'re quite
 a bit different).
 
 Dom >>

I have a few friends who have had careers in 2 branches of the military.  In
every case I am personally knowledgable of it was first terms as an enlisted
man and then separation followed usually by a few college terms to finish a
degree then a commission in a different branch of the service. 

 I think perhaps if the player decides to stop after a few terms and
voluntarily switch, he can have a successful second career in whatever branch
they choose.  It is a fact that if you are "mustered" out of one branch you
will not get into another branch of the service, at least in the U.S.  With
this in mind I think if they fail a roll and get the boot that they will not
be able to have a second career, at least in any formal branch of service,
perhaps they could continue in a Pirates or Hunters type of career.  

There were several supplements for CT that had some of that type of thing.
Anything like that gonna be available for T4.1?

Agreed 100%.

It is *well established canon* that Solomani medical tech is superior to Imperial 
- - it\'s 16 in the classic era, so I can believe it reached 13 (*possibly* even 
early 14) towards the end of the ROM *IN THAT AREA ONLY*. ISTR that computer tech 
is good, too. That might have reached 13. However, I\'ve seen no convincing 
evidence that the ROM ever reached higher than 12 in any other area, and there 
are many references that explicitly state their TL was 12.

Many people seem to agree, but I\'m not sure what the consensus is. To save 
bandwidth here, email me with the Subject "ROM TL Vote = n", where n is the max 
effective TL you believe they achieved (*rare experimental* items may be 1 level 
above this).

	Can\'t say I\'ve seen any, but I rarely buy any gaming magazines
these days - too much CCGs and boring gothic punk stuff.

	Talking about magazine covers, there\'s a quartely gaming mag
published in Finland that regularly has a Traveller-related cover.
Too bad they also accept adventures for translated games (2300AD and
T:2000, but not Traveller in any form).

	Also, "Spin", a zine published by Turku SF Society, tends to have
similar illustrations. *grin* *picks dried gouache from under

An issue of Arcane (don\'t remember the number) at my local game store
had a two-age spread on the new Traveller.  It was pretty old though, as
it talked of the products as \'forthcoming\' I believe.

Didn\'t someone mention Shadis having some Traveller stuff in it?

I think that I\'ll be using the "To Infinity and Beyond" as the motto for
the IISS in my short story, as first propogaed this question.  However,
should I put \'with regards to Buzz Lightyear\'? :-)

True enough..I agree with that point about Math (being a person who just
can\'t stand th subject afterall <g>).  And, if T4.1 or any RPG for that
matter gives rules for everything, it stops the creativity and
imagination that are supposed to go into games.  Hence the reason I have
never utilizied an Encounter Reaction table in my life....why not juts
pick the reaction you think this NPC would have?!!

I agree with this.  It\'s not too difficult to understand the Traveller

Alright then.  We will agree to disagree...and not get an arguement
started. Thanks for replying Don, I\'m glad we cleared this up...back to
Traveller! :-)

In 247 a race whose vision centered in the far-IR joined the Imperium.  The
then-standard gold sun on a black field was invisible to them so the
Empress Porfiria [201(245)326] declared that it was the symbol, not the
colors that mattered.  Soon afterward the services adopted their
"traditional colors.

The only analogue to The scouts I\'ve been able to find in history has been
the government financed explorers & "Indian Scouts" of the american old
west in the Imperium\'s formative years, with a shift in style to a more
CIA-like operation later on.
I don\'t think your typical scout of any era would be to worried about a
uniform, motto\'s, etc.
These are the individuals who don\'t like to be around other people a whole
lot, or discipline.
Think about the highest award a scout can get: a 1 man starship.
I think it most likely that scouts would have, perhaps, a single set of
"dress blacks" for formal occasions, and wear fatigues during their normal
working day.

Still easily enough done, just have them roll 5D everytime (under the system
on the Ref\'s Screen), one die at a time, and write them down as they are
rolled. Then, if for ex it is a formidable task, just add up the first 3
rolled for
the attempt. This allows you to maintain the secrecy factor and adds a 
level of trepidation and fear for the players as they roll the dice, and
really
is not as cumbersome in practice as it sounds; I tried it this last week with
my group and it ran well once they understood what I was doing. With 
5 dice in your hand and dropping them one by one, the roll is as quick as
you can call them out. And you get great responses as they are rolled:

"Ok, I got a 2, a 1, great!, a six, a five, and a six, Oh @%@##! God, I
hope it
was a lot easier than I think it is!" The task (opening a door with a lock he
was unfamiliar with) was Formidable, so his roll was a 9, and with a 7 Dex
and a 3 skill, he did OK, but was sweating bullets there for a bit. (I usually
use a T4/KB2 variant, but we were testing this out and didn\'t feel like
rolling *seven* dice every time; there would probably have been a few
coronaries around the table at the numbers :) ).

Excellent historical analogy, that I\'ll admit I hadn\'t thought of.  If
you think about it, the 17-19th century \'frontiersman\' really fits into
the scout mold.  Although they\'re government-funded, they operate alone,
and with their own rules really.  Great point Druid!

But, I still think that they\'d have some uniform that they wear for
formal occasions, and have decorations\\medals they can receive.  I
created one for a story called the \'Shining Star\' (really goofy name,
but I couldn\'t think of much...) which was awarded upon retirement for a
career of excellent work.

As to the motto, I think the scouts would appreicate this piece of the
service, and would probably adopt it, along with some sort of personal
maxim or motto to go by.  Along with the \'To Infinity and Beyond\' IISS
motto (well, the TML version at least) many would probably have less
savoury ones that they personally go by.  I see a scout as a gruff,
rugged individual who doesn\'t much like people, and prefers his own
company above that of others, save his close and personal friends. 
Dislikes bureaucracy, and governmental interference, and prefers to
operate without having to meet the administrators \'back home\'.  That\'s
probably why the greatest reward they can get is their own ship.  That
way, a scout could free himself from bureaucratic bonds and go where he
wanted, when he wanted, and not worry too much about the administrative
parts of ship owning (ie. he doesn\'t make payments, can re-fuel for free
at scout bases).  The way a scoutship is handed out to ex-scouts was
almost definitely thought up by an ex-scout in the Imperial bureaucracy.

This also depends. By its very nature, hexes are intended to compartmentalize

The fact that most people do not speak it is exactly why the motto
should be in a dead language.  It sounds better that way and will very
very slightly increase the esprit de corp of the service if they have a
cool sounding motto whose exact meaning is obscure to nonmembers.  This
is presumably a part of why some current services and institutions have
their mottos in Latin.

Now it does not have to be Latin but could be some other dead language.
English might be a good choice in the "real" Imperium but does not make
a good choice for the game, since that is in English anyway (except for
translated or written in non anglophone countries of course). I suggest
that we handwave this away by suggesting that English is not used for
the motto for the exact same reason that old high Vilani is not used -
the Third Imperium is trying to avoid publically taking sides on the
"Who is better - the Vilani or the Terrans question ?" because whatever
side they pick they will upset people who believe otherwise and thus
reduce their empirebuilding ability.

Latin is a Terran tongue but it is not so obviously a Terran tongue _to
a Galanglic speaker_ as English is, therefore it is easier to get away
with using it for your motto.  Galanglic is descended from English (with
some other languages such as Spanish, Vilani, Chinese etc) and therefore
a Galanglic speaker will recognize English when they see/hear it.  A
well educated Galanglic speaker may well be able to understand some of
it, at least in written form.  I have always envisaged the relationship
between English and Third Empire Galanglic as being somewhat like the
relationship between Latin and French, Spanish, Italian, etc  or like
the relationship between Old English and Modern English. 

Since I dont speak/read Latin and have very little Spanish or French I
cannot confirm how easy it is for a native Spanish, French, Italian, etc
speaker to understand Latin.  I will say that as a well educated native
English speaker I had few problems understanding Chaucer (Middle
English) but that Beowulf in the origional (Old English) was almost
impossible to understand except for a few stray words. 

In the end however  we should use Latin because it just looks/sounds
cooler than using English does.

My vote would be no.  The game is fiction, why cloud it with the 
harsh reality that somethings just don\'t work out?

We don\'t all love the universe being crafted, Michael. I detest M0 as it\'s
come out. I couldn\'t care less about it. I will NEVER run M0. I await
M1100, M1050, M600, and M200. Hopefully, it will be better than M0 has
been. Just like I probably won\'t ever run M1200 if it is the post virus
M1200...

        Which is why I avoid posting on M0 issues. The RoM thing, though
represents a major tweak to the environment, that I hope won\'t be
promulgated in later Millieu books.

I also am not fond of the rules mechanics as they sit in T4.0... Some of it
is great, some totally broken... and I will get t4.1, so as to see if MM&IG
fixed enough for me to use the system for M1050.

As for the mistakes, Heart, and Humor... I agree with you.

Phil, your whole argument on this matter is interesting reading... but ...

1) Technology does progress in linear and branching paths historically.

2) overall, most technologies  in a given area will be of similar and
interrelated precurser technologies; you can\'t make pentiums, current era
TV, digital watches, or Automaitc Fuel Injection without micro-chips or
micro-tube technology.

side note: I read (about a year ago) that some lab is developing micro-tube
technology, primaritly for CRT flat-screen (1mm or so thin!, with each
pixel a separate tube!)

3) Tech Levels, especially as broken down in WBH, are a usefull gaming
extrapolation.

Looking at my rulebook (PH, p68, 3rd printing):

Interrupt Task
 >to interrupt another unit\'s turn:
 >Routine, Movement speed (Safe)
 >Referee:If this task is successful, it becomes the interrupting unit\'s turn.
- ->**The interrupted units turn is considered spent for the combat round.** A
 >Failed interrup roll doesn\'t count as a spent turn. Ignore Mishaps.

the marked line (** marks mine) is immediatly obviously typoed if you read
the full detailed example at botom of same page, as after Aybee interuppts
NPC1, no other interupts of Dur are possible until both (a) NPC1\'s
interrupt is over and (B) Dur takes some other action.

I instead penciled in the following correction to make sense of the
examples in both magazines and the PM, RM, and RC.

- ->**The interrupting units turn is considered spent for the combat round.** A
                 ^^^

and the restrictions
 >Interrupts are subject to these restrictions:
1>- A unit may not interrupt the turn of it\'s own side
2>- Only one active interrupt is permitted per side
3>- only one interrupt is permitted per enemy attack or per square of enemy
 >movement.

item 1 is no interrupting friendlies. Soo, you have to wait for your pal to
finish, the guy he interrupted to do something, then you can try to
interrupt him.

Item 2: I read as no "Tag-Team" (shared) interrupts. So fred and julie
can\'t share an interrupt, even if they are both in deep TP communication.

Item 3 I think has been hased to death...

Also, Erwin, I think maybe (if needed) this might be better by private
e-mail... or on X-boat, if only it were still around.... (Sigh, wish for
the old days)

OK. Let\'s ignore world generation rules for a minute. I\'m pretty sure you can
create a world while ignoring the dice-driven generation system. Once you
have done that, do another, and another, and another. You may be able to do
it, but after the 17th or so, it would be nice to fall back on the dice for
some answers.

Now look at birthdays. If the rule is... generate a date from 1 to 365, the
possible answers are:

just a minute while I program my spreadsheet / computer, random function.

I\'ll roll pick my own birthdate.

I roll these dice and get an answer.

I\'ll start with 1 and every new character I do will increment up.

I\'ll use today\'s date.

Etc. 

After a while, it is helpful to have a chart that gives a universal answer
that everyone can agree on.

This discussion boils down to

A. I\'m the referee. I\'ll decide the system. If that is your argument, then
remember the designer/writer is the one that puts the reference system into
print.

B. This is a waste of one page and two paragraphs in the game book. Use it
for something else. If that is your argument, then you are second guessing
the writer/designer on what is important. Frankly, the entire T4 book does
not sufficiently explain what things mean (for example, you learn what a
character is byy generating characters; there should be some text just
explaining what a character is and how to play him/her/it).

C. Characters shouldn\'t have birthdates. They didn\'t before; no one paid any
attention to them. Again, the designer is setting an agenda wherein age is
important; birthdates are important; players and referees need to pay
attention to them.

D. This dumbs down the system. If that is the case, remember you aren\'t the
only one playing. We need new players, new buyers if Traveller is going to
survive. This is one way to make the system intelligible to them.

Frankly, I think the Birthday system is neat. It defines a basic piece of
character background, but removes the choice from the player. Sometimes, two
players both have the same birthday. Some players are born on holidays.
There\'s a part of the calendar that means something to the player when it
comes up. There are hooks on which events or situations can be hung.

Or is that page of chart absolutely necessarily needed for something else
that isn\'t going to be in T41 otherwise. If that is the case, tell me what
that one page should be.

Casual Encounter - Xen Xanfried, Scout

Xen Xanfried, a 5 term scout,, born in 1074, is a tall, warm fellow, with a
love of drink, women, and song. His long blond hair is kept in a single
braid which hangs down to his belt line, and is woven with gold chains. Xen
is usually encountered in some seedy starport bar, starting fights with
marines, or just associating with slime. Almost always found in his TL15
tailored vacc-suit (IISS issue), he is also seldom without "Betsy", his 4mm
Gauss pistol.
        Xen has several hobbies, some of which would be the end of him if
he ever got truly caught at them. He is a small time drug runner, part time
con-man, and student of euphoria.
        When encountered, Xen will ususally be pursuing one of the above,
or more, and throwing parties aboard his surplussed Type A-2 Serpent
Scout/Survey vessel, an Aerodyne version of the Type S, with minimal survey
sensors added on, and no air-raft. The craft, Dubbed "Amy" is fitted with
an experimental TL16-17 AI, which has developed emotions, and a severe
crush on Xen. Play this up... he thinks of Amy as a non-exclusive wife, and
while he complains bitterly about her jealousy, controlling attitude, and
overprotectiveness, truly is starting to fall in love with her. He will not
maintain any long-term relationships with  women, but will engage in
promiscuous behavior given the opportunity. He always carries a box of
condoms... and will even share them if the need arrises.
        Xen also can be encountered anytime a Deus Ex Machina is needed...
he is a patron of the underdog, and really is a humanitarian at heart,
albiet a sociopathic one. If he needs to, he will kill with no remorse nor
second thought. He will defend anyone who he feels is in need, at risk to
his own life. He will also befriend anyone, at any time, for any reason, so
long as they are not a Marine (Imperial or otherwise).
        Xen has but one lasting friend, a Court-Duke from regina (IE,
career noble, without lands or position), by the name of William Hamford.
Hamford, as he is known by Hamford or "Hammie" amongst his friends, hooked
up with Xen as an escape from the social pressures of the life of a
Courtier, and upon retirement, they ran off. Hamford has two hobbies: Jump
Physics and Cocktail parties.
        Both gentlemen share a warped, and (usually) harmless sense of
humor. Xen is often found teasing people about his IISS emblems done in
greek (cost him some kCr15), and Xen\'s personal motto is "The Universe, my
playground"
        In 1117, they set off from Deneb to Capitol, with the self
appointed mission of executing Lucan, and putting Dulinor on the throne;
they will keep this quiet, and will subtly and frequently probe peoples
loyalties. They will quickly dissassociate with supporters of Lucan and
Margaret, both of whom they consider to be dangerously unstable.

after 1114, Hamford will accompany Xen almost everywhere.
After 1117, They tried to wipe amy\'s personality... And Amy became
Amy/Angie, developiong a second independant, psychotic personality called
Angie. Amy is usually dominant, and both are aware of each other. Angie has
the hots for Hamford, and keeps trying to convice the two scoundrels to
build a robotic remote body so that she can be "a real woman" to hamford.
Amy, being rather forgiving and motherly, forgave Xen, but not Hamford, for
the wipe attempt; Amy is simply too proffessional to do anything about it,
though.

Angie: 000832, Same skills

Both are in the one TL 16 computer mounted; the other computers are TL15.
THe difference in mental stats is due to differences in the personality
programs, and access permissions to certain hardware. Amy set the general
knowledge database to hereself only; all access to it goes through Amy.
Angie develops a separate database for herself, and lacks good knowledge of
"correct social behaviour"

To quick convert these fellows to T4, add one to all listed skills, and add
perception 3 to both.

Too true... However, there is a degree program in Role-Playing in (IIRC)

No one was ever suggesting you do such a thing. Douglas\' post was
specifically about "canon" Traveller, referring only to published material.
Leroy\'s claim was that the Rule of Man had TL 15+ in the published
material. This is what Douglas refuted, he never said anything about
individual referees\' campaigns. If you want a TL 15+ RoM, fine. Or better
yet, play TNE. That has TL 15+ artifacts and lots of ready published source
material.

One idea I kicked around was a society which used apprenticeship instead of
schooling. Parents, the creche, or whatever, would raise children until
they were old enough to follow instructions and then farm them out to
businesses and institutions as unskilled labour. The kids would earn enough
wage for upkeep while learning practical, business, and social skills.
Apprentices may be able to change jobs regularly, or be shuttled around
like corporate resources to gain wider life experiences. They would gain
cultural or academic knowledge by working for historians, researchers, or
lecturers.

Notable social effects of such a system would include a blurring of child
and adult roles, and a significant proportion of unskilled personnel in all
fields of endeavor including business, politics, the military, even as
starship crews.

Thanks for your post on Artemsus using anagathics. You\'ve raised some nice
points, but...
Do you really think that somebody could live to 183 using TL12 anagathics?
Even if they could, given the hideous range of side effects, would they
still be capable of running an empire for the last 40 or so years of that? 

And before your DGP reference I throw another - the reference to the
\'long-lived Vilani\' (Vilani & Vargr), which I am pretty sure grew directly
from the reference to the \'*natural* longevity of the Lentuli line\'...
Again, I emphasise *natural* longevity...though Artemsus was possibly
augmented by anagathics as well. 

I do remember the quote that stated that the Imperial family and high
nobility were exclusively Solomani until (?later than M:0 anyway?); but
this single reference sounds to me a lot like the kind of hot air about 
\'racial purity\' that plagues Terra in the late 20th century. I suggest that 
Occam\'s Razor cuts on the side of Artemsus being Vilani,
and \'Solomani supremacy\' being vapour. 

But I\'m enjoying the discussion, and I\'d still like somebody to suggest a
Terran nationality for Artemsus\' father, *Djugashvili*
Lentuli...that vicious dictator <hint,hint, hint>

OTOH, the family name (as you allude to below <G>) is definitely not Vilani

"Hordes of slavering fans", isn\'t that Roll 5 on the Material benefits table?

The possibility should be there, but remote.  I think that some mechanism
tied to failing a continuance roll would work.  (i.e., you get
court-martialed, your Captain goes bankrupt, etc..)

Sabmiqys is populated by a "race" of robots.. all that is left of a species
that travelled to the stars and brought back a plague.  The robots (which
are TL17 and are artificially intellegent) were ordered to refuse
permission to land to any ship.  The first few Sylean Scouts to show up
watched in horror as their companions\' ships just exploded.  They had never
seen a planetary meson site in action.

Eventually, contact was made, but the Sabmiqys robots want nothing to do
with us, and tend to kill out of hand annoying interlopers.  Their overall
TL is 17, but their space travel TL is only 8.  They just don\'t care about
anything beyond far orbit.

The five people mention are probably the IISS crew manning the interdiction
station.

It\'s possible that the Lentuli line were more than a little Vilani, hiding
behind Solomani attitudes and customs.  Look at some of the Emperors of
that line.. Martin II was 142 before he ever took the throne!  It\'s
possible that Cleon III and IV were manipulated onto the throne in a
Solomani Restoration attempt; only they got a homocidal maniac in the first
case and an ineffectual, confrontational Emperor in the second.

	Well, I\'ve never assumed that "mustering out" benefits were things handed
to you as you went out the door of your career. I\'ve always ruled that the
cash represented money _and_ equipment (i.e. the stuff you bought right
after chargen) that you\'d accumulated over the course of your career.
Likewise weapons, etc. So when you rolled to get Cr60,000 on the mustering
out table, that didn\'t mean the last thing military pay did was hand you a
wad of cash and warn you not to let the door hit your rear. It meant that,
over your however many terms, you\'d accumulated up to Cr60,000 worth of
belongings. Likewise, the +Soc, weapon, etc. benefits.

	As for "actual" mustering out benefits, defined as a benefit explicitly
received when departing a career, in reward for services rendered, yeah,
I\'d say you can wind up with nothing. If I leave the Air Force now (after
two terms), I get diddly--I lose all I\'ve invested in a retirement(*), get
no separation pay, no kiss goodbye, and they won\'t let me take home an F16. 

	On the other hand, I\'ve picked up a master\'s degree, quite a bit of
technical education, and I\'ve managed to buy a house, a car, and a computer
(not necessarily in that order). But the character generation doesn\'t
produce those benefits on a term-by-term basis. Instead, at the end of
chargen, I\'d get Cr Whatever. With that, I (the player) would purchase
equipment, a vehicle, etc. But that would represent things I (the
character) had picked up over the course of chargen, even though I (the
player) had \'bought\' it all at a point in the process \'after\' my career.

	But I really do ask that multiple careers be allowed. Probably _not_
military-to-military. But military, then civilian certainly. TNE did this,
and kept it under control (IIRC) by increasing your chances of ending
chargen each time you changed careers.

(*) Yes, I know. There\'s no explicit deduction from my pay for retirement.
But it\'s considered part of my benefits package whenever Congress thinks
about a pay raise (\'gee, when you consider the future value of his
retirement, he\'s being quite well paid\'), and I\'m not allowed to deduct any
IRA contributions because I\'m considered as making a contribution to an
employer-sponsored pension fund. Go figure. Not that I\'m complaining, mind
you. I\'m probably making half what I could working for LockMart ...

I need more adventures to run while the ship is in jump. My players are
going on a 4-jump journey and I need something to occupy them.

I suppose the steriotypical jump adventure would be a murder mystery a\'la
the Orient Express. I have never tried this because I can\'t believe any
murderer stupid enough to commit the crime on board a cramped sealed
environment with no way to escape or hide evidence would be smart enough to
elude capture for more than a few hours. In my campaign a character once
stole a pocket comp while in jump. The captain simply locked all the
hatches and did a total sweep of every cubic centimetre of the ship,
starting at the forward avionics nacelle.

The ideal jump adventure would take about a week to resolve (obviously),
not require any fatalities (in case all the crew are player characters),
and somehow emphasize the fact the player is completely cut off from
outside help.

"To Infinity and Beyond" would be a fun motto to use in a campaign, but I
don\'t think it would be a good choice for a published story. First of all
it is a direct steal from "Toy Story", using it in a published work may
cause problems with Disney\'s legal department and may be seen as lacking in
imagination by readers. Second, while it may sound hunorous the first few
times you hear it, it will begin to sound trite and dated over time. The
Ithklur write-up in the old Hivers alien used a similar style of humor and,
while it was funny the first time I read it, it just sounds foolish in an
actual campaign and is incomprehensible unless you have a lot of mid-80\'s
american cultural knowledge.

Finally, "To Infinity and Beyond" really doesn\'t make a good motto for
anything. It sounds bombastic and naive, an effect Disney no doubt intended
to lampoon the all-american white-bread astronaut image. If your short

BUT - Why (in 20th C Earth) Latin at all?  Because it\'s ancient and that
(seems to) lends a bit of class - of antiquity - to the slogan.  Somebody
(Forget who - sorry!) earlier posted a note about why we\'re not
experimenting with bizarre music types for the Imperial March (Sorry -
Emporer\'s Fanfare).  It\'s because we (generally) accept that our players
simply want to play Traveller - NOT learn an odd language (how similar
would you say Galanglic is to 20th C English?  Not very, I suspect...) How,
then, to make a slogan seem classy and ancient? Latin gives the impression
of antiquity - it\'s, in Traveller terms, the analog, expressed in 20th C
terms, of an ancient language/dialect.

Besides, maybe the Syleans had a thing about Latin...  ;^)

Uniforms? Maybe left over form the last time the scout in question was
TAD
to regular military. I always envisioned the scout being very informal,
the
only "Uniform" would be things like Vacc Suits and equipment. (bought in
Bulk) Other than that, Scouts in the field would have a credit line to 
equipement purchase.

   Here\'s the problem: create too many exceptions to the rule, and
eventually there is no rule.  It is canon that the RoM achieved TL 12. 
We can, through some minor hand waving justify the *possibility* that
there were some worlds in the rimward that achieved early TL 13 just
before the Long Night began.  They would be the exception to the rule. 
Start allowing for mass produced TL 14 vacc suits, (and as Leroy has
suggested) TL 16 computers, and TL 17 terraforming and pretty soon
everybody who wants to hand over some high tech gear to their players
can justify it by using the magic words, "though the tech level of the
Rule of Man was only 12, they were so highly advanced in fields \'X\',\'Y\',
and \'Z\' they managed to construct a working prototype of \'A\', which is a
TL 21 \'B\'.  Traveller rapidly devolves into AD&D with laser rifles from
there, as players concentrate on locating "magic"items for their own use
or to sell for gold pieces (aka credits).  A TL 12 RoM is but the
figament of the imagination of old fart Traveller players who refuse to
throw their old books away and buy new ones.

   Never put in WBH, but it *should* of been, was the following
statement: "max tech level of any kind can never exceed the following
levels if you are planning on using this world in the canon Traveller
universe: Vilani Imperium - 11,  Rule of Man - 13, Third Imperium -
16."  This must be done or the numbers in WBH get ridiculously high,
blowing canon GDW material out of the water.

   Like I said magic items.  The only magic items are suppose to be
Ancients technology, and *that* is supposed to be technology so beyond
the player characters that tinkering with it (or making part of your
personal cache of goodies) is just an all around bad idea.

   Whenever Leroy is backed into a corner as being part of an
outnumbered minority, he tends to cite the "silent majority" who are out
there agreeing with him but refuse to speak up.

   My impression was that the adventure states that these are items
which are available in quantities larger than a few on the open market.

   See above.  Also, vacc suits fall into the larger realm of "Space
Technology" which would also include jump drives.

   And recall what I have said: variant stuff is fine, so long it is
recognized as such.  I make a *huge* distinction between canon and
non-canon material when I get into storyline debates.

   FF&S doesn\'t strictly prohibit them either.  In fact, it is in FF&S
that the artifical "100 DT Limit" was dropped, making jump capable
vessels below 100 DT possible (thus also jump torps, though I would rate
them as a tremdous waste of money).

>I look at the whole TL-14 vacc suit thing as a point-of-view thing
>more than anything. 

   This is part of what I mean by Relativism.  Someone said the vacc
suits are TL 14, so what?  I say they are TL 12.  Bob over there calls
them TL 9.  Tower of Babel time...

   Either the suits are of the same, less or greater tech level than the
ones sitting in the locker in my TL 12 Engineering Department.  By
calling them "TL 14 Vacc Suits" instead of "higher tech vaccsuits" there
is an understanding that the people calling them this know what their
exact tech level is and is they are stating it, whether "they" are
Imperial scientists giving them a rating, or the writer stating
something for the benefit of the audience.

   We are talking about changing the character of the neighborhood, not

   Hey, I could run a total munchkin campaign where everybody is

way reall life works.  Besides, the players in my group have well over
50 years of gaming experience between them, if I don\'t throw them some
change-ups and mis-direction, the game is going to get boring really
fast for them.

The U.S. Army\'s dress blue uniform\'s pants are a a medium blue in color
while the jacket is so dark as to be almost black. The uniform grew out
of that in common use during the late 1800\'s; the jacket was typically
rolled up and stored out of the sun while the pants faded over time.

I like the idea of the black uniform. The dark grey fits as well, that
uniform has just been in use a bit longer.

Career changes need to be possible during character generation;
restricting a character to one career just isn\'t realistic, nor in the
spirit of generating an "adventurer". So far I\'m on Flyer (2 terms),
College (1 term), Army (1 term, and in the 2d). So far no ill efects,
other than my "mustering out benefits" won\'t be nearly what they might
have been if I\'d pursued a steadier course.

   Leroy believes that someone who is truly opened minded about this
topic agrees with him.  Hmm...but isn\'t it possible to be open minded
about the evidence and not agree with Leroy?  I guess he believes
otherwise.

   I am please they have managed to spell \'Imperium\' correctly.  From a
strictly canon perspective, there is a great deal *not* to be pleased
about, otherwise there wouldn\'t be so many people upset by what they
have read so far, and this "debate" would be taking place.

   As I have stated previous, writing official material in the past has
proven more difficult because it must be entertaining while at the same
time sticking with previous canon (ask Dave Nilsen and Loren Wiseman
about the Regency Sourcebook).  Those who find that their creativity is
too stifled by that fact should consider writing variant or "off the
beaten path" (official but not part of the usual regions) work.

interpretation of them) do nothing to clarify what the answer should be,
and future writers need guidelines that *clearly* spell out what the
limits are, which is why I suggested that Marc Miller look at the stuff
posted here, examine the primary sources, and make up his own mind about
the subject so that he can make an offical ruling.

   Nice name toss.  I\'ve spoken with Marc, Loren, Frank, Dave (at great
length), yourself, Terry Mcinnes, Chuck Kallenbach, and numerous other
Traveller current and former authors of an official and unofficial
status.  Others on this list have done so as well.  No one here is
overly impressed with status, power, rank, position, who you know, or
who you don\'t know.  They *are* impressed by the ability to demonstrate
knowledge in a timely fashion and by people who can produce reasoned
opinions about some subject related, in whatever vague way, to
Traveller.

   Try late TL 8.  Actually we\'ve been doing this for centuries, which
helps to explain the wide variety of everything from dogs to roses.  As
for the creation of sentience, I see no problem with manipulating
Dolphins (which fall just below the line already) at TL 12.  Now making
a lab rat sentient, *may* take TL 14.  There is no evidence that this
was taking place during the RoM.

   General Note: In my studies of MT Solomani & Aslan, I have discovered
storyline "mines" which if taken to their logical conclusion can lead
you beyond the realm of established canon.  I take the material in S&A
with a grain of salt for this reason.

   Horse crap.  While ozone depletion was a concern five years ago,
man-made ozone depletion is being brought under control.  Within 20-40
years this will be a non-issue.  Acid rain is a problem, but only
because of what it does to vegetation.  This too is being brought
gradually under control.  On the whole, air pollution levels will
improve, not worsen, as we approach the middle of the next century.

>   Industrial smog became such a problem that we built domes to enclose

   The air quality in the United States is improving each year and looks
to continuing improving well into the future.  The dome over New York
that appears in one illustration is at best comical.  Somebody took the
Greenpeace propaganda leaflets a little too seriously before writing
this bit.

>   Thoughtless methods of agriculture turned once-fertile lands to barren flats.  

   Soil management practices here in the U.S. have improved greatly over
the last 30 years.  While it is still possible that Iowa will become a
desert, there would have to be major climatic changes before this would
take place.

>   Extinctions reached a peak unseen in millions of years.

   This part unfortunately ring true, no thanks to the government of
Brazil, those who still believe that a panda\'s liver will help their sex
life, and people who would rather have strip malls instead of parks.

   Total and complete horse crap, for reasons that I have detailed on
this list before.  Less polluting forms of energy (fusion, super
batteries, fuel cells, "clean" hydrocarbon fuels) severely curb global
warming and help bring it under control.  No polar ice cap melt, thus no
dramatic raise in ocean levels.

>      [Removing taints count as global atmospheric terraforming.]

   We\'ve cleaned up the skies over Los Angeles dramatically
already--does that mean we\'ve achieved TL 16?  No, TL 12 I guess then. 
Again, DGP\'s bold predictions concerning Earth don\'t hold water (pardon
the pun), thus this example is irrelevant.

   For those who are interested, my Solomani Rim star fixes will be

in Traveller Chronicle #10.

   Leroy refers to the elimination of subdwarfs altogether and white
dwarfs as possible primary stars.  Dave did this I believe for reasons
of simplicity.  While subdwarf star systems undoubtably exist, but their
nature is still a major source of controversy.  White dwarf star systems
are less controversial, but require extra work to do them correctly.

"  In 247, the Eliyoh (a nonhuman minor race) joined the Imperium. To
that race the symbology was unimpressive. The Eliyoh vision cenetered in
the far infrared, which resulted in distinction between the official

declared that the symbol would have no official color.
  The original banner in the Imperial throne room is still black with a

   I don\'t know how many TL 6 cars you have in Finland, but they are an
endangered species in the U.S.  The vast majority of people here outside
of Alabama (I\'m kidding) own TL 8 cars, which pollute which less than
their TL 6 counterparts.  By 2020, TL 9 cars will have virtually no
pollution and be owned by everyone except collectors who can afford to
pay the outrageous amount required for a few liters of hydrocarbon fuel.

   The empty-headed quotes made by the current Vice-President of the

Errata 3 removes this restriction noting that restriction 2 keeps
interrupts sufficiently in check.  Note there are VERY few instances when
you want to interrupt your own side.  Generally you can wait for the enemy
to interrupt your friend and interrupt THEM to lay down covering fire.

Never thought of that one! :)  I simply read it to say \'Once your side has

True... It is still relevant though...

I read this restriction to mean the original unit\'s turn has to be
completed before any more interrupts can occur.  e.g. NPC1 interrupts Dur,
Aybee interrupts NPC1.  No more interrupts can occur until Aybee, NPC1 and
Dur have had their turn (in that order and which is exactly the same as
what William said...).  Specifically when Aybee has finished his turn, Fred
(who is on Aybee\'s side) CANNOT interrupt NPC1. Nor can NPC2 (who is on
NPC1\'s side) interrupt Dur when NPC1 is finished.  (Got that?  Good then
explain it to me :))

In MT TL 12 anagathics _if effective_ have the same effect that higher
Tl anagathics do, the charecter automatically succeeds at 2 aging saving
throws.  The only problems with the TL 12 variety is that they are very
hard to use (The Emperor has _the_ best Doctors), and Expensive (not a
problem for Emperors) and have hideous side effects.  If a charecter
manages to avoid the side effects (which is admitedly statistically
unlikely)(or has them covered up...) they can live just as long as
someone using TL 15 anagathics.

It is true that using MT aging rules an anagathics user will not
statistically be expected to live for 183 years (even with very high
starting stats), but using the MT aging rules a charecter _not_ using
anagathics (and with average 7777?? stats) will live for only about 69
years asuming statistically expected results on the aging table.  This
suggests to me that the MT aging rules are somewhat broken.  I vastly
prefer the T4 aging rules, which give a charecter with average (7777??)
stats a statistical life expectancy of 100 years.

Who says they _were_ running things ?  Perhaps that is another benefit 
(to the staff) of Emperors on Anagathics, they get so weird that your
palace power plays are unnoticed.

The "natural" longevity of the Artemsus line could have been the line
used to cover up the anagathics use, especially in Milieu 1100 library
data where anti noble anagthic use predjudice existed and the details of
the Emperors Anagathic use were lost.

It does not seem unlikely to me that people were supposed to believe
that the high nobility were pure Solomani, after all Millieu 0 states
that Terrans were socially dominant on Sylea. The odds that they all
actually were Solomani seems a bit less.

To me Occam\'s Razor would go something like this:

Milieu 0 says that 80% of the population of Sylea are primarily racial
Vilani.  Therefore a Sylean could easily be Vilani.  Vilani are socially
inferior to Solomani.  Therefore a Vilani might try to pass as Solomani.
_But_  the genetic difference between Solomani and Vilani are fairly
easy to detect (blood type etc, to say nothing of genetic ID).  At TL 12
a government type 9 probably has socialized medicine.  Therefore they
have medical records on everyone.  Therefore a Vilani\'s efforts to pass
would have a high probability of failure.

Of course we could say that since Anagathics users or Vilani (even from
long lived bloodlines) are unlikely to live to be 183 it is logical to
believe the Artemsus was both Vilani _and_ an anagathic user.

If we want a conspiratorial Traveller universe we could say that the
Emperor Artemsus had clones made of himself (but younger) and that the
Emperors advisors had the Emperor killed and a clone (after cosmetic
surgery to age them) put in his place.  This process could have even
happened several times. Perhaps these clone Emperors were ruled by their
advisors in much the same way that child Emperors of Japan were puppets
of the Shogun during some historical periods.

I always felt insulted and patronised by "Starter Editions", the 
implication being that I was too young and/or stupid to understand the 
real thing. YMMV, of course.

The animal encounter terrain types are split into:

Prairie, Rough, Broken, Mountain,
Forest, Jungle, River, Swamp, Marsh,
Desert, Beach, Surface, Shallows, Depths,
Bottom, Sea cave, Sargasso, Ruins, Cave,
Chasm, Crater 

I assume these are WBH terrain types, and they look to cover terrain 
types for "livable" planets.  I would like to see the temperature 
extreme terrain types (as seen in various Traveller adventures) 
covered as well - Dinom in "Across the bright face" fits into the list 
of terrain types above, but I recall some ice & snow terrain types in 
another adventure which I can\'t find at the moment as well as the FASA 
maps of waterworlds and burning hot planets.   (Say, did you ever play 
the MetaGaming mini-game with crustals (rock islands) floating on 
molton lava? :-) just a thought).

There should definately be the "hatched" pattern for urban/cities 
(the underlying terrain type can be seen between the hatches) as seen 
in Invasion Earth and Across the Bright Face - this is a wargaming 
standard and much better than soild black.  The huge multi-hex urban 
areas stretching into the sea in Invasion Earth conjures up all sorts 
of images for me from favourite SciFi books and films.

I see your point, and it could make for some interesting roleplaying
opportunities.

However,

[and I\'m going off T4 and the excerpts that have hit the TML from your
WFW97 file here, as my Mac won\'t read WFW97 :-( ]

the present character generation system doesn\'t account for all the junk
that you tend to accumulate as you pass through a career (eg car, tools,
PC, electrical equip, clothes). I\'ve always assumed that the MO benefits
represent (at least in some part) these things.

But there\'s an evil streak in me that smiles at the thought of a player
starting with no money and a 10KCr debt! But I suppose that it shouldn\'t be
that often, and should be linked to,say, a failed continuance roll.

A very good point, especially as all the Lentuli line (8 Emperors and Empresses
out of 11 who ruled for 419 of the first 475 years of the 3rd mperium) seem to
have this longevity. As an aside, the Zhunastu Dynasty produced 3 Emperors,
two of whom ruled for only a year each.

Regretably its not just a single reference. I\'ve found four seperate sources
which give genetically pure Solomani Emperors until Margaret I (born 684,
proclaimed Empress 688, died 736). They are: Supplement 10 - Solomani Rim,
Supplement 11 - Library Data N-Z, Alien Module 6 - Solomani, and the
Imperial Encyclopedia. So unless there was massive doctoring of the records
at some later date (not that I\'m against the occassional conspiracy myself :*) )
the pure Solomani nature of the early Emperors looks pretty much rock solid.
So I\'d have to say the razor falls on the side of anagathics.

>But I\'m enjoying the discussion, and I\'d still like somebody to suggest a

Did you know that that particular region (Georgia) has an unusally high
proportion of centinarians?

Yes - I agree. I recently detailed up some systems in a subsector, and I
was quite happy for the first six, but after that my creativity was
somewhat drained and I fell back to Rob Prior\'s excellent Metator program
to expand and detail the system to give me some inspiration. (It\'s faster
and neater than doing it the dice way ;-) )

I would find a formula more useful - one of the reasons I prefer building

Not having seen the new character generation material I can\'t comment from
strength here (oh for a Word 6 or RTF version!), but 1 page!? Most of the
buyers of the game won\'t have seen the rulebook in detail before they get
it home. Now, the things that really interested me when I bought Traveller
the first time were the starships, guns and the character generation thing
(coming from D&D), a SciFi system at last!

The second time (MT) the sidebars with loads of snippets on the universe
attracted me, and still do. All the games I play these days have lots of
background material (besides Traveller, Elric!, Cyberpunk, Ars Magica.) in
the main rules. That is what made me want to go and buy more supplements...

I\'ll take the birthday situation either way - I really can\'t comment
without try the new rules.

>Or is that page of chart absolutely necessarily needed for something else

General historic background snippets on the Imperium, RoM and Vilani, in
sidebars covering everything to 1129. Put lots of M0 stuff in as well, but
allow the rules to cover the broad sweep to TL16. This will allow the main
rules to seem relevant in any Milieu. The background is Traveller (to me),
not the rule-set. However, a rule set that works and hangs together is
important, and we can only advise you our feelings on your plans for that.

My final question would be to ask you if you envisage the character
generation system being used often enough to give a lack of inspiration. If
you envisage the players doing the generation with refereee present, that
shouldn\'t be a problem. If you envisage the referee generating all the
characters, and having to do it often, the table is more valid. At present,
I have 4 to 6 players on a regular basis, and have only had to generate a
new character twice in four months (real time).

All the best

I am against this, although I agree it is probably more realistic.  
If you do want to add this sort of thing, put it in a life events 
table in "expanded" character generation, balanced by benefits 
such as contacts.  It could be phrased as (for example)

  1: A disaster strikes the base where you are stationed, destroying
     many people\'s possessions.  Reduce by one the number of rolls 
     when mustering out of your current career.

Roll similar things often enough, and you end up with no benefits...

After the discussions on the TML and after reading some errata, I\'ve
scrapped this one. You should be able to interrupt your partner a) if
he\'s doing something dumb or b) if you want to put down covering fire
or otherwise assist him.

Interesting. I read this one as "if your side has an interrupt going
already, then your side can\'t do another one this round". For example:

A1 makes a move
  B1 interrupts him and does something evil
    A2 interrupts him

Now, B2, according to how I interpret that restriction, can\'t interrupt
A2 because the B side already has an interrupt going. I found that
restriction silly and have scrapped it.

I must disagree. I am discussing an Traveller topic and want opinions
from
other Traveller players/referees. This list isn\'t, after all, a T4 list.
But thanks for the thoughts on the interrupts!  :-)

Hey thanks! I didn\'t know where the errata were. I just picked them up
in my travels along the way.

Excellent point. Why fire at them if they\'re not firing first?

With this example, if I understand things correctly, Fred can\'t
interrupt
NPC1 until after he\'s either attack (which ends NPC1\'s turn) or moved
one square from where he was when interrupted. Note that NPC1\'s turn may
not be over after he\'s moved that square, since he can probably move 
many squares in a turn.

So, things might work like this:

Dur goes
  NPC1 interrupts him and begins moving 10 meters
    Aybee interrupts him, does something
  NPC1 moves the first square of the 10 meters
    Fred interrupts him, does something
  NPC1 moves the remaining squares of the 10 meters because there\'s
nobody
       left to interrupt him
Dur finishes turn

What do you think? Am I missing something?

I was going to say "perhaps just do it for worldmaps", but on reflection
I\'ll stick to my guns - IMO it *is* generally applicable.

I think the idea of hexes as compartments is a wargaming approach.  I
imagine PCs pouring over orbital images and saying, "hm, it looks like
we can keep to the savannah for the first 175-200km, but after that
we\'ll have to cut through this jungle - that\'s going to slow us down",
rather than "9 hexes open, then 3 hexes jungle - look up the movement
rates in the ATV operator\'s manual".  To me, having hex compartments
encourages the second image.

The hexes are useful for players to have, even if they are not
compartments.  They make it easier to guess how far terrain lasts -
"looks about three and a half hexes" - and that little bit of added
uncertainty in how long the journey should take is no bad thing, surely?

Another point: they already need to do this for coastal hexes, so it\'s
not a new technique to learn, just broadening the application.

OTOH, as a programmer I can understand why computer mapping software
would want to use filled hexes... ;-)

BTW, although I called it a bugbear, this is not make-or-break - I\'m not
going to boycott a product just because the maps don\'t conform to my
ideal!

Thanks for listening,

No negative benefits (unless they can be plot related?).  But I really liked
the idea of basing your mustering out rolls on (terms - 1) in each career. 
Thus, you can career-hop but you don\'t leave with much.  A perfect decision
for character generation: evaluate the trade-off and choose one.

The exception to this might be stopping a career to go to school, then
re-entering the same career.  I would view this as educational leave, so
although you don\'t get benefits for the academic term, you don\'t lose your
career benefits.  But leaving a career for another, then re-enting the first
career _would_ cost you benefits.

    'body' => 'Hi,

I thought I\'d share my views on Aslan Education. Given the structure of Aslan society, it will 
probably be split into Male and Female education. Here\'s my ideas on both:


MALE: Basic Education: Clan based, mainly from much older males in the Clan

School Education: Non-existent, apprenticeships train \'teenage\' males.
        
University Education: Establishments associated with the Chosen Career of a male Aslan educate 
him further, e.g. an Aslan wishing to become a military pilot will try for entry to a \'college\' 
associated with one of his Clan\'s Naval Bases. Vassal Clan members are also eligible for this, 
and the possibility of entry also exists for members of other Clans who are allies or owed favours 
by the owning Clan. If wishing to become a merchant pilot the Aslan can be trained outside of the 
Clan system altogether - a female controled Corporation can provide for training to suitable 
candidates. In Clans Corporations also provide on the job training too. There is also the 
possibility of the Clan specializing in a certain field, like assasination who would provide their 
males with equivalent training  to a \'college\'.

Female: Basic Education: Clan based, in \'schools\' associated with the Clan.

School Education: For most, Clan based. Very talented Aslan may be funded, or sponsored to 
go to a Corporation that specialized in education. Also, a Clan may specialise in a certain field, 
providing excellent education in certain areas.

University Education: Unless a member of a large clan, a vassal thereof, or a member of a minor 
Clan who\'s female specialise in Higher Education, this is covered by Corporations that specialise 
in Educational Fields.

You should have played with some sneakier players ... one game at the (UK) 
Games Workshop in the "good old days" had a character smuggle a ton of 
illicit cargo onboard.  Now, we all know there is no way to hide an extra 
ton on a small (200 T merchant).  I did not know if the extra ton was from 
a passenger or a crew member (the cargo had been loaded while I was 
"diverted" in Startown).

The captain/owner was useless at organising the search (he was much more 
interested in his new aquarium that filled one entire wall of his 
stateroom) and delegated the task to me (I had discovered the mass 
discrepancy during take-off). We needed to find the cargo before we 
jumped, as we had no idea what it might be, and the captain refused to 
turn back based on a 0.5% power imbalance in the grav unit ... the thing 
was coming up for annual maintenace, so how I could believe such a small 
variation was beyond him.

The first sweep of obvious areas found nothing, so I started a more 
detailed search, spliting the job up to trustworthy PC teams.  No joy.

Just before jump I worked out who the likely culprit was, cross-checked 
that against the areas his team had searched and went to "double check".  
I never did find the extra ton, because on my way to double check I 
tripped over a pile of Credits in a brown envelope.  The 0.5% discrepency 
had to wait while I checked to see if anyone had lost these Credits.  
Fortunately, no-one claimed them, so I got to kepp them.  By then we were 
in jump and my duties took me elsewhere ....

The cargo was some extremely valuable wine, it was being stored in the 
out-of-use low berths that were used as large refrigerators to keep the 
wine at an ideal 4 Celcius.  The wine had, I suspect, both a suspicious 
origin and almost certainly an equally suspicous future.  Volvo (the 
smuggler) was also ship\'s doctor and, until then, a man of apparenttly 
unlimited integrity ... but that was all a sham as we later events in the 
campaign showed.

from more of a danger and recruiting perspective.  The scouts have really 2
key jobs, one is more typical of the frontier scout and one is more typical
of an undercover infiltrator.  The first one doesn\'t require much in the way
of uniform for the work they do aboard ship cataloging systems.  The real
undercover work doesn\'t come until later, and by a specific direction.  These
teams would be trained for undercover ops and have a plethora of disguises,

IMHO, terrain filling the whole hex comes under the category of \'acceptable 
fudge\' - it\'s obviously a simplification, but it makes life easier and there 
are no major problems with it.

Actually, I think it *does* work. Picture the scene: some arrogant, 
upper-class twit from the Imperial Burocracy comes over to Scout HQ, sighing 
and tutting at the untidy \'uniforms\' and general lack of respect, and 
announces that the IISS needs a motto.

"Huh. We don\'t need no stinking motto."
"Nonsense. Every other service has one, and you\'re not going to be the 
exception. It\'ll give you pride, and unity, and that sort of thing. Think of 
one. I\'ll be back in a week."

The Scouts mutter and complain for a while, until one - with an interest in 
ancient Solomani history - brings out an old holovid he found...

A week later, the bureaucrat returns.

"Well?"
"We thought of one: \'ad infinitum et ultra\'"
"What does that mean?"
"It\'s Latin. Loses a bit in translation, but it\'s about going to the stars."
"Well that sounds appropriate."
"Yeah, and it\'s a famous Solomani saying."
"Really? Excellent! I\'ll go and inform the Emperor immediately!"

He leaves, the Scouts collapse in hysterics.

Yes, whodunits in jump are a cliche...but they\'re also a lot of fun! There\'s 
a write-up of one I ran on my Traveller web pages, but a quick summary is:

Situation: Hiver-sponsored peace conference between the Solomani, Imperials, 
and Vegans during the 2nd Rim War (1119). The only neutral territory they can 
agree on is a Hiver-owned (but human-crewed) liner in jump. PCs are SolSec 
agents, part of the Solomani delegation. A couple of days into the 
conference, murders and/or \'accidents\' start happening to members of the 
Imperial and Vegan delegation, and all the evidence points to one of the 
PCs...who claims to have no memories of the killings, despite waking up at 
the scene of one, covered in blood, holding the murder weapon...

What\'s *really* happening: Of course, it\'s all a Hiver plot! They don\'t 
*want* peace, because by the time the humans have finished blowing each other 
up they\'ll be so weak that they won\'t be a threat to the Hivers for decades 
at least (and they might be ready for a bit of manipulation...) They 
suggested their own peace conference before anybody else purely so they could 
ruin it, thus convincing the various sides that the others couldn\'t be 
trusted, and so hopefully prolonging the war longer than it would otherwise 
have lasted. Hidden away in a secret compartment (actually one of the 
turrets, which had all been welded shut for the trip), with a direct link to 
the ship\'s computer, was a powerful psionic assassin, who was really behind 
the murders. He could teleport to and from the murder scene, was telepathic, 
and had access the ship\'s security system, so he was effectively untraceable 
and omnipotent.

In all my 15 or so years of gaming, I have never needed a chart to determine a 
PC\'s birthday, and I\'ve never seen an argument over it. Even when I was 12. And 
I\'ve never seen any rules for it in any other game (although I have a feeling 
C&S had some).

Yep, this is most of my argument. This is the most pointless, trivial rule I 
can think of, and you\'re wasting a whole page on it?! *Anything* wold be more 
useful. Including a blank page. IMHO, of course.

Well, no, they always had them, and they did pay attention to them, just not 
very much. Maybe once a year.

Perhaps if you could explain *why* they\'re now so important we might 
understand.

The game survived 20 years without it. I hardly think this is the \'killer rule\' 
that will wipe every other game off the map.

Well, you would :-)

I totally agree. I just don\'t think it requires a whole page to pick a number 
between 1 and 365.

How about a copy of the Imperial Calendar, with all the important dates marked 
on it, with just a comment underneath saying that players should pick a date at 
random and the ref should mark it on the calendar.

	Then somewhere along the line, something is getting sliced out:

>>>> MAIL From:<sinbad@dfw>
><<< 550 <sinbad@dfw>... Sender domain not found in DNS (see RFC 1123,

	Right here, _somebody_ is telling the AOL mail host that this message is
coming from "sinbad@dfw" To try and avoid some spam, the AOL host is trying
to lookup "dfw" to see if it\'s a valid domain. It\'s not, so AOL is
rejecting the message as being invalid.

	Furthermore, the message you sent me did NOT have the correct return
address. All it had was "sinbad@dfw"--here\'s the main headers:

>To: gdw-beta@qrc.com
>From: Sam Thomas <sinbad@dfw>
>Subject: Re: Where is AOL?
>Cc: "David J. Golden" <goldendj@pcisys.net>

	The X-Sender: header does _not_ contain the return address--the address in
brackets in the From: header is the return address. All I can suggest is
that somewhere your email setup is still wrong, because it\'s missing the
".net" at the end. I suppose, theoretically, your ISP\'s mail host could be
hiccupping, but that would be unlikely.

	The result is that if I just press "reply," the faulty address gets used.
My ISP\'s mail program can\'t contact "dfw" so the message would get returned
to me, I\'d notice the missing ".net" and try again--that\'s how I got
through yesterday (because that\'s exactly what happened yesterday).

	As for why worldnet.att.com is getting in here:

><<< HELO Sam.worldnet.att.net

	I\'d bet that "dfw.net" gets its net services from AT&T. Try doing a "whois
dfw.net"--I\'ll bet that there\'s an att.net name server in there somewhere.

	Good luck!

	*heh* hydrocarbon fuel already costs outrageous amounts of money.
At least Mercedes-Banz has put pretty much effort into fuel cell research

Your *impression*? With all the "cite your sources" talk on this list, you\'ve

least borrow a copy from someone. :/

However, speaking of sources... where does the adventure state that the
hi-tech items are available to the open market? Heck, I think I\'ve even said
here on the list (at least twice) that they *weren\'t* available on the open
market. (If there\'s a mention of where such items are available/were

like to know about. It might have been added in editing, but I know that I
didn\'t write any such paragraph. [I still have not seen the printed version
of "Anomalies.].)

Yep, that might be hand-waving...but no more so than those who want 1,000
different solar systems to identical tech levels and refus to allow for
localised innovations and differences [both up and down] in certain areas of
technological achievements.

Once again, the anthology was named "Anomalies." The answer to the question,
"are those airheads trying to up the overall tech level of the Second
Imperium?" is evident in the title of the collection.

It appears to me that the evidence appears to be falling on the side of
Artemsus possessing mostly Solomani lineage, but with the
family line having some kind of freak geneline that enhances longevity.
Later doctorings of family and official histories led to the \'pure Vilani\'
claim...

Please allow me to explain. We have the evidence of Solomani Georgian
descent in *Djugashvili* Lentuli\'s name, and the unusual fact that 20th
century Georgians (Central Asian, *not* USA) have a very high proportion
of centenarians (quite healthy ones too, AFAIK). The Georgians are also,
coincidentally, very Vilani-like in appearance, being quite dark-skinned
and dark-haired (refer Vilani & Vargr, DGP).

However, there are also references to the Lentuli line being \'pure Vilani\'
and therefore enormously long-lived. How about this: during the Long
Night, a family of Vilani of very high social status but *way* down on its
luck intermarried with a wealthy upstart Solomani family - probably merchants 
of Georgian origin. A Georgian family with a history of longevity since 
pre-spaceflight Terra...

The resulting family line possessed *all* or many of the genes for
longevity (longevity is most likely linked to many genes, rather than just
a few). However, given that this is unlikely to have happened by chance...

It looks to me as though the Lentuli family have been *selectively
breeding themselves for longevity!!!* They have chosen Vilani, Solomani
and who knows what other genelines, carefully canvassing family trees for
longevity. They have engaged in a 2000-year-plus campaign of genetic
selection for a single purpose...political, social and economic dominance.
Which they damn near achieve in the first half of the Third Imperium. 

Now to achieve this, they have probably had to use a little more than just
selective breeding. Could the Lentuli family have maintained, in secret,
genetic technologies from the Rule of Man? (not wanting to reignite a 
particular flamewar)...Which they have then used on *themselves* over the
centuries to enhance their own longevity to an unimaginable degree? 

A family so obsessed with longevity would, of course, have
investigated anagathics, and found them either:
a) incredibly useful, perhaps incorporating them into their own
genetic program ie incorporating breeding for anagathics tolerance; or 
b) utterly useless, since all such anagathics do is reproduce the many
effects of *natural* longevity? My opinion tends towards b)...because
anagathics would also obscure the signs of natural aging, and thus
potentially pollute the carefully-tended Lentuli geneline.

Prejudice against nobles using anagathics would of course be encouraged by
the Lentuli family, which would be eager to maintain its own *natural*
advantage. But they would have to conceal their own genetic manipulations
from the disgust of both the Vilani *and* Solomani!  

Which brings us back to the pure Solomani vs. pure Vilani point...what
would be the best way for the Lentuli family to disguise their efforts at
self-improvement?
Why, none other than to insist that their longevity (which by the time of
the Sylean Federation would have become pretty bloody obvious), was in
fact because the Lentuli family was pure Vilani. Of course, Vilani family
records and AAB data could prove otherwise, but in the face of 2000 years
of Lentuli tampering and natural information entropy, the trail would be
confused at best. A *damn* good idea for a campaign, if I do say so
myself...

In the final analysis, just as on 20th century Terra, claims of \'racial
purity\' are utter rubbish. Go far enough back, and a family
member comes from the wrong side of the fence...or an adulterous affair
that is never discovered...or a family covers up their \'shame\' in a period
of intolerance...

One last thought. Who knows how long the Lentuli breeding program has gone
on? The program *may* predate spaceflight, and the \'long-lived Georgians\'
we see today may in fact be the early results of such a program. Which
means that the program could have begun in the 19th or 18th centuries,
with the beginnings of genetic theory, or even earlier, when somebody came
up with the idea of applying animal husbandry techniques to human
families. This could go back a *long* way...

Plenty of food for thought here, I think. If you can\'t find any adventure
seeds in this, you are clinically dead from a role-playing perspective.

Unfortunately know. But I have seen enough for me to begin laughing
hysterically whenever somebody on the news mentions economic forecasts,
official statistics, or even census data. There are just too many points
at which fuzziness can enter the equation, and the underlying theories are
pretty dodgy in *so* many places. 

I think we can take a lesson from this back to our discussions of
Technological Levels, don\'t you...?

Actually, as I organize things, there are *3* jobs for the Scouts: Survey,
Exploration, and...um.."something else."  Exploration and "something else"
are in the same department, but officially it\'s just exploration..if you
get my drift.

Anyway, here\'s how I describe the Scout Service in my games.

Scout Service

1.  Survey Department - Called the "Clean Team" by the Explorers, the
Survey Department Ships jump into new systems, do a quick survey and move
on.  They tend to be mainly scientists and technicians, skilled in remote
sensing and data analysis.  Long time members of this department tend to be
somewhat "space happy" loners that associate mainly with each other.  They
are the ones that usually get the ships on retirement and sail off into the
unknown.

2.  Exploration Department - Called the "Passengers" by members of the
Survey Department, the Explorer teams are the Scouts that actually land on
planets to do detailed studies of "interesting" planets.  Some teams
specialize in low-tech or unoccupied planets, they tend to be "rough and
ready" frontiersman types with all the skills of the explorer and
knowledges of university professors.  Other teams specialize in exploring
higher tech systems and they are more diplomatic and urbane, but are just
as tough as the frontiersman types.  All these folks tend to be the sort
that go on wild benders when they are off duty, and take an almost perverse
pride in the amount of trouble they get into.  They seldom get, or even
want a ship on retirement, but they are more than ready to go exploring
with anybody.

    2a.  Section Thirteen - Not called *anything* by anybody..in public!
    Members of Section 13 are specialists in deep recon, infiltration,
    and intelligence gathering missions on hostile planets.  If they are
    involved in "blacker" activities, you don\'t what to know about it.
    If these people exist and *if* they actually retire you don\'t want
    to know about that either..but if they did they would be passing as
    a more conventional scout.  If they existed.  ;->

The only reason for friendly interrupts I came up with was something like:
your buddy is about to charge through a curtain of superheated steam (which
he can\'t see) in the engine room - you interrupt to throw the emergency
cutoff.

Mark,

Personally I like the idea of hexless (and gridless) maps. Coming from a
war game background I originally fell into the hex grid thinking, but on
reflection the idea of uncertainty that comes from using "aerial photo
recon" is more attractive. I can picture the players studying the maps
with rulers, etc. to map out a route (as in John\'s post above). It gives
more of the \'feel\' of exploring the unknown. To aid in location the same
2 sided scaling system seen in most street maps could be used.

As for the look of the terrain, I vote for a realistic view. Take any
Rand-McNally atlas and draw the maps in a similar style. Again this adds
to the "feel" of aerial photos. Details such as highways, cities, etc.
can be added by line drawings and hash marks or be "photo realistic" by
porting in available area photos (color corrected and airbrushed, etc.).
This would give your world maps a realism not seen in other games and
add to Traveller\'s "Hard Science" feel.

All of this is, of course IMHO. You will do what you think is best for
your game. I thank you for listening.

Offically by 1100 there are 7 Offices(deptartments) to the scouts service
 1. Survey Office
 2. Detached Duty Office (includes the intellgence branch)
 3. Communication Office
 4. Exploration Office
 5. Administation Office
 6. Operations Office ( includes the Security Branch )
 7. Technical Office

Since the the grand survey was not completed til 420 and not mention was
made to its start date, It is reasonable to assume that it does not yet
exist in the early part of M:0 until sometime in the 300\'s. Since The
X-boat service was not established until 624 , the Communcication office
would not be in existance until then. 

That still leaves 5 Offices divided into field and Bureaucracy. 

In regards to scout uniforms, the only thing I know for sure is that by
1100 the standard field duty uniform is the Tailored Vacc Suit. No mention
is ever made of what color although the B&W pics always show it as some
sort of dark color. Of course I\'m sure that change came about about TL14
when they become available. I would think that they have gone through
several changes in uniforms as times change much the same as any other
branch of the military or civial service has done.

In much the same way as they are in thermal equilibrium, yes.  That 
is to say, there is an overall equilibrium -- the actual "value" of 
which can vary -- but local deviations are possible.

It therefore follows that you can derive a thermodynamic quantity 
like chemical potential ( mu_i = partial dG / dn_i, where n_i is the 
concentration of species i ) which describes an ecosystem.  Ow, my 
head hurts.

Also ecosystems are probably chaotic strange attractors (now, there\'s 
a D&D monster for you!) so in theory that perishing butterfly can 
flip us from one stable equilibrating system to another, very 
different one.  Or increasing the CO2 content of an atmosphere.  Or a 
nuclear winter.

Dom, Et al,

        Thank-you VERY much for the praise... Peter has played several who
encountered Xen at one time or another...

In my version of m1100, he\'s actually one of eight clones; kept apart by
the IISS, these eight have become aware of each the others... #7 is
homosexual, and #1 is QUITE homophobic... IISS HQ created Xen as a project
to create the "ultimate" scout... well... He\'s ultimate, but not as a
scout, except maybe as a "scout\'s Scout" (in the sense of "A Man\'s Man").
#6 and #7 are in Domain of xdeneb, the "Real Zen" (#8) left the DD and,
after killing Lucan, wound up in a cryo-berth after Amy/Angie got Virused,
and became Amy, Angie, Martha, Sue, and Freddie.... Xen and Hamford
sabotaged the PP from the outside (Venting fuel), signalled a distress
call, and mugged the piratical respondent, who had quite a few goodies, and
some warning about Virus... Hamford and Xen reawaken in 1222, in vilani
space, and make their way (courtesy of some Regency scouts meeting the
"Legendary" (as in thrown out of every bar on regina and Mora at least
twice) Xen, and counting upon Scout comeraderie) back home to regina.

        Another Xen (sans hamford, as there is only one of him) encounters
the RC, and gets "Retired" to a university as a relic... He dies trying to
escape, in 1213.

I wrote Xen up much based upon the original character, rather than how he
is as an NPC in my useage... He\'s more believeable thisaway...

That is perfectly legal under both interps shown.... Mine allows for deeper
layers of interrupts. My definition of active interrupt is two people
acting at the same point; since no action can be taken while interrupted, a
character who has been interrupted is not an active interrupt, but an
interrupted interrupt (or, for clarity, a paused interrupt) so your friend
could interrupt the guy who made your interrupt turn paused...

More factors to consider:
 it when the first interrupt happens... I have the interrupt occur BEFORE
the action is resolved (the action is committed to be done, and announced,
then intterupts are allowed), so you can potentially stop ANY action.

You cannot interrupt someone you cannot percieve... important to not
percieve rather than see... especially in shipboard action or when psionics
are involved.

As for interrupting members of your own side, I allow it only if the
interrupt is to do somthing to THEM; you cut yourself off from the tactical
pool for doing it, though. A small price to pay.

I also allow refreshing the tactical pool, too...

        To refresh your side\'s tactical pool
        Difficult, Tactics, Int, 2 seconds x time roll [doing this for non-mt
        types]
        Referee: Becomes fatefull if hasty. on a success, restore points equal
        to the number of persons involved in the discussion who have tacctics.
        On a crit success, refresh pool to full. On a superficial mishap, lower
        own pool to 0. On a minor mishap, own pool goes to 0, and add 1d to
        oppsing side\'s tactical pool. on a major mishap, as minor, but 2 dice.
        On a Destroyed, as major, but also reduce own morale by 1d until
pool is
        successfully refreshed.

Sure, I may have little to show for two terms of college (to get 1 BA!),
and a failed "survival" throw in the Army (served 0.25 years!, and spent
rest of year trying to get life back on track), but I have a couple
thousand in computer equipment, a few thou more in games, another 2-4
thousand in non-game books, easily $3000 in clothes, $1000 in weapons &
armor(Sword >$400, Daggers, 2 ~$100 each, Gambeson at $100, Helm @ $75,
Sgeign Dubh @ $30, several bokken, a mace, a few rattan "swords"), and
easily another $2000 worth of SCA garb, and my kilt ($500, last I
checked)... so I\'m $18,000 in debt... Were I to acution everything I owned
off, I could probably come out about even (and naked, but, hey!)

I can see halving benefits for all but the final career... it\'s what you\'ve
got left from that time frame and life-style.

This is true with a couple of provisos: firstly, nitpicking, at the 
molecular level reactions aren\'t an equilibrium process; secondly, 
more critically, dynamic equilibrium is a state at which chemical 
processes arrive eventually, all things being equal.  The key word is 
eventually: the timescale for the conversion of diamond to graphite 
is extremely long, for instance.

It therefore follows that you can incrementally wreck an ecosystem by 
polluting it faster than it can equilibrate away the pollutant, or 
some byproduct thereof.  Similarly, if you can establish a local 
environment which progressively disturbs equilibrium in a direction 
you want -- a grove of trees. say -- this can be the focus for a 
progressive improvement of the global environment, all things being 
equal.

Which they aren\'t on Earth.  Sigh.

Well, for one thing, you really should add more subtypes to some of these.
"Desert" actually covers several terrain types. Dune "seas" are a lot
different from "hardpan" which is different from ....

Also Prairie is both steppes and tundra. And maybe a few others. 

What animal encounters should be based on are biomes. They are a sort
of ecological community type. Somewhere I have a list of the ones on
earth. They tend to be based on climate. So you get something quite
like tundra if you go far enough up a mountain.

So terrain *and* climate add up to the biome.

Medium asteroid would be around 10 km. Lets assume a cube for ease of

cubic meters. Each cubic meter weighs 1 ton time the density of the
material. So for rock, figure around 4-5 trillion tons *mass*. For
nickel-iron, it\'s about 8 trillion tons.

For *displacement* it\'s it\'s around 70 billion tons.

Actually, what they tend to wear are *surgical masks*. No *real*
filtering except for some particulates. Heck, I wear a "filter mask"
when pollen (or house dust) is bad. But that\'s because I have an allergy.

There are filters and filters. The kind I wear is just for particules
(paint, dust, pollen). A "true" filter mask (for tainted atmospheres)
will be more like the ones the ERT uses in case of chemical spills.
They use cartridges that absorb and neutralize the chemical in
question. 

The big difference is that a "real" filter mask has a cartridge
lifetime of minutes or hours. The sort I use (and folks in Tokyo use)
can be used for days or weeks.

They\'ve shown a strong interest in *Russian* territory. Especialy
resource rich areas like Siberia. There\'s a reason the Soviets kept a
lot of troops on the border with China!

Grabbing Taiwan wouldn\'t get them much. They\'d probably destroy much of
the industry during an invasion, and without that, Taiwan is pretty
worthless. What China needs is "easy" resources.

Not so minor detail. The metallurgy of the time (Civil War) is not up
to manufacturing the steel for the barrel and receiver of an AK-47. And
the chemical technology doesn\'t know how to make smokeless powder. That
took about 40 years of experimentation in the real world, though they
might be able to speed things up a bit with samples.

Actually, by the time you get to energy levels capable of drilling a
hole through a person, the laser pulse concentrates so much energy on
so small an area that the surface of the target *explodes* into vapor.

Again, I suggest that you check out real lasers. The vaporizing
material will blast out a crater.

Now, *this* suggestion I like. Give, say, a half-page to the calendar, 
give the comment above, and then an \'info box\' about birthday (and 
possibly nameday, if it exists) traditions in the Imperium. (Only a 
brief note would be needed to detail Solomani traditions, obviously. 
;-) Adding a bit about how the Emperor\'s birthday is celebrated could 
also be appropriate.

It\'s just the kind of irrelevant detail I like in a game. Particularly 
if an adventure nugget centered - somehow - around a birtday 
celebration is given later. (Perhaps a terrorist group plotting to 
disturb the celebration of the Emperor\'s birthday? Or, less overdone, 
perhaps a passenger aboard the player\'s ship is about to become 50 (or 
any other age that tends to result in excessive celebration), and has 
decided to go off-planet on vacation rather than suffer the birthday 
party his practical-joker friends are likely to throw. Of course, they, 
not being the easily thwarted kind, have come up with an absolutely 
*hilarious* surprise for him...)

No no, you\'ve got it all wrong, the Templars are just a front to hide the real

by hinting at another grand conspiracy. Look I have the proof right here,

I\'d look very closely at the records of the RoM for Lentuli tampering.
Now just why did the RoM fall again :*).

But they didn\'t come close to achieving dominance, they did achieve
dominance. A 420 year reign, with only a one year interuption; that
looks like dominance to me. And lets have a look at that ineruption.
Porfiria was a clear heir after Martin II\'s death, so why did she stand
aside in favour of Cleon III? Mayhap some nobles were getting a
little too close to the truth and mayhap they didn\'t survive Cleon\'s
reign :). But of course all ths begs the question, was Cleon I in on
the plot or just a dupe?

As most everyone seems to agree, in the field of geenering the RoM was
way in advance of anything seen before or until the late 3rd Imperium
(TL 14, maybe TL 15; though I\'ll tread carefully here). If the Lentuli had
been able to maintain these technologies (a big if, I\'ll admit), they could
have had access to very advanced general medical techniques which
would increase their lifespans, access to advanced genetic techniques
which would allow for selective breading; and finally access to anagathic
techniques considerably better than the TL 12 of Sylea if they chose to
use them.

I\'d disagree here. They way I\'ve always though of anagathics is that
they slow down the aging process by enhancing the accuracy of cell
duplication within the human body. Thus they don\'t obscure the signs
of natural aging, they just delay them. Thus when you stop taking
anagathics, the years do not catch up on you. I\'d say that they did
use them, but carefully, since someone who simply does not show
any signs of aging would stand out like a sore thumb (imagine if you
will the Emperor who everyone knows is 120 but still looks like a
20 year old, a bit obvious).

Well a simple DNA test might show a lot, but who\'s going to walk up
to the Emperor (or earlier his chief advisor) and ask :*). I don\'t think that
the Lentuli would have come out and said they were Vilani. I think they
would have made no comment on it and just let this opinion form by itself
(with suitable subtle behind the scenes prodding of course). This would
make it much easier for them to overcome the anti-Vilani prejudice of
the early Imperium when they did take over. "Vilani, no of course not,
I\'m pure Solomani, what ever gave you that idea."

Must say, I really like this. A neat packaged solution with *heaps* of
role-playing potential. And every game needs at least one grand
conspiracy IMO. As to hooks, just look at the period after the fall of the
Lentuli. No Emperor gets to die in their bed for another 150 years. The
Civil War was the Lentuli attempt to regain power. At first they try subtle
methods (the assassinations of Cleon IV, Jerome and Jaqueline I), but
that doesn\'t work, so bring on the Civil War.

I like this idea!  Marc, pay attention to this one.

If this is too awkward for the main T4.1 rulebook (because you haven\'t had
time to think about other milieu in enough detail yet), then consider putting
in some indication as to which stats will change depending on milieu.  (Yes,
_I_ think that it\'s obviously the social ones, but as a high school teacher I
think you should specify it if you are aiming at the \'young gamer\' market:
most of my students are still at the \'rules lawyer\' stage, without enough

This is a deficiency in the generation system, or more precisely a deficiency
in Real Life (TM).  

Metator follows the Scouts system almost exactly.  This means that stars are
placed, then gas giants, empty orbits, and planetoid belts.  Then the main
world is placed, in the habitable zone if possible.  The only reason this
would be impossible is if the orbit is empty or occupied by a star (if it has
a gas giant the mainworld is placed as a moon, and planetoid belts are never
placed in the habitable zone).

That being said, for hot/cold stars, the \'habitable zone\' often isn\'t,
especially if the planet has a non-Terran albedo.  This means that you can
get a \'habitable\' world with an average temerature of 400 degrees Celcius! 
This is the generation system, not the program.  As a design decision, I
decided to stick as close to the system as possible.

Once Metator is finished, I plan on writing a different program that will
create as realistic systems as possible, using real science and ignoring game
rules.  This is, however, a long-term project.  Don\'t hold your breath :-)

Quoting from Book 6: Scouts:

Largely due to the efforts of the Scouts, the Sylean Federation rapidly
turned into an empire - the Third Imperium. The Sylean Federation Scout
Service became the Imperial Interstellar Scout Service: the IISS.

With the passage of time, however, the missions of the Scout Srvice have
evolved into different pursiuts. The original assignment of recontact soon
tunred into one of acutal discovery and exploration of new, unknown worlds.
[snip]

In order to handle the great diversityh of missions assigned to it, the Scout
Service is organized into offices. These offices are themselves further
divided into branches (or sometimes services), each responsible for a
specific mission or duty... Placed in authority over the several offices is a
central command structure (called Headquarters) which provides overall
control of tye scout service. Because Headquarters controls the operations of
the entire Scout Service throughout the Imperium, it is concerned primarily
with policy and administrative detail, rather than with the accomplishment of
specific missions, and is rarely more than a distance office providing
instructions and direction to the service.

The offices of the Scout Service are divided into the Bureaucracy (a standard
structured establishement) and the Field (an informally structured group of
individuals who accomplish many of the goals of the service). The Bureaucracy
is strict and governed by regulations, the Field is unconventional and
flexible.

end quote

The Field comprises the Exploration, Communications, and Survey offices.  The
Bureaucracy comprises Administration, Detached Duty, Technical Services, and
Operations.

The Field has no ranks per se, just job titles.  The Bureacracy has ranks.

This is a good idea.  I could live with either way of creating tables, but I
like this.  

Possibly we should stick with a fixed version of the existing terrain-based
tables, but use the biome for things like encounter frequency?

This sounds really useful.  But I would just say that characters must have a
birtday, either chosen by the player or randomly selected.   

You should also indicate how the important holidays are observed, including
any movable/midweek holidays.  (Personally, I like the idea of the Imperium
keeping holidays firmly attached to the original commemorative date, rather
than following the current custom of moving them to the closest weekend so
that people can go to the cottage.)

Thank you all for your kind words.  I have enjoyed the TL discussion about
the Rule of Man.  Sometimes I am slow to catch on, but hey everyone has their
weak points and strong points. :)

I finally found the reference of relevance you all must have been using to
base arguements on a low-tech pre-history of the Third Imperium.  Rather
shrewd I must say.  It reminds me of an adventure J.P. wants to write.

On page 190 of T:TNE, Tech Level Decline table.  The decline of the world\'s
tech level is determined by the number of pips on dice (or a die) and that
amount is subtracted _directly_ from the world\'s tech level, all due to a
thing called Virus.

  Starting
  Tech Level    Decline

    0-8           1D6-3
    9-A           1D6
    B-D           2D6
    E+            3D6

By pushing the tech levels down, you\'ve actually HARDENED the Imperia
(including the Third) against Virus--_very_ clever strategy, and _very_
forward thinking. :) <G>

J.P. wants to get a crack squad of Zhodani commandoes and raid Dlan to
off _all_ of Duilinor\'s ancestors.

In this spirit, I propose that we _all_ interpret the "Terrans discover J-3"
reference to mean that Terrans learned how to build large enough fuel tanks
to do J-1 three times sucessively, and we trim another die off the decline
table.  Starting at A (the maximum Vilani/RoM tech), a 1D6 roll means at
worst, worlds will be down to TL4 after Virus, and many will retain the
ability to do Jump drives at TL9.

</FRIVOLITY>

If you are fuming at this, just consider it a late 4/1/97 post, because I
really am laughing right now.  But I am sure I am not the only one. :)

Sure, but it wasn\'t during the RoM either. In fact, this terraforming
project occurred over 2,000 years later. So, again, what does this have to
do with the RoM?

Let\'s keep perspective here. No one ever *had* major issues with the
Terrans achieving TLs above 12 in certain areas. It was your absurd theory
that they had access to TL 16 that drew so much flame.

There\'s nothing more frustrating that having a discussion with someone who
constantly tries to bend the material of his argument so that it seems he\'s
never strayed from his original position.

Not unless they were TL-17 artificially intelligent nanites. Virus is able

It would be impossible to install a lanthanum grid into an asteroid

Humans have been pretty good at altering their environment for a long time

theories for the decline of their civilization include over-irrigation, and
depletion of farmlands as a cause. 

Kinda blowin\' ta hell the "enlightened primitive peoples at one with nature"
 theories.  Actually most studies of collapsed civilizations seem to point a
strong causal finger at environmental overuse and subsequent collapse as a
reason for the fall. This includes Rome, Egypt and a variety of Medieval
African kingdoms

On a side note, I stand corrected. Tech has been lost. But, in compensation,
usually by the time it is noticed, it typically has been passed by or
replaced by a superior technology. The only losses have been through lack of
communication. 
I read an article from a teacher wherein he states that the head
administrator of his school told him he could not fail anybody, could not
single people out (read: help slower people catch up) and was expected to
take acting lessons to make his classes more entertaining. Like someone said
here on the TML, we are turning into Vilani without cooperation.

I agree. In my world, "weekends" per se don\'t exist. That is, there 
isn\'t a set couple of days, Imperium-wide, which most people have off.
On some worlds people work seven days a week and take a month off.
On others, people work three days and then take one day off. My point
is that, although membership in the Imperium means working with the 
Imperial calendar, local customs still prevail when it comes to work
time.

Not sure if this was a request for suggestions but here are a few
anyway:-

The Life support malfunctions just as the party enters jump (not enough
to immediately kill them, but enough so that they spend the jump running
arround trying to keep the system active) - kind of like in Apollo 13
where they had to use the lander\'s life support to keep them alive, but
it was only specked for two people.

Medical emergency - how about one of the players (or NPC) falls sick
soon after entering jump space, the individual is isolated quickly, but
soon others become infected.  The nature of the illness is up to the
referee, but it could life threatening, or could just make people
paranoid!

Hijacking is always a posibility, and so is a sabateur (though why
anyone would sabotage the ship which is keeping them alive requires a
good explanation).

Cargo Hazzard (could be a leeking container containing hazardous
chemicals, could be an illegal animal been transported in a cage instead
of a low berth).

Perhaps someone suicides (which looks like murder).

Malfunction in the VR entertainment suite provides an unusual adventure.

A Malfunction in the low berths causes everyone to be defrosted early,
leaving massive space problems and Life support overloads.

Mind due if one of these occured on every jump I made as a player I
would become a little bit suspicious, the likely hood of those such
events is prety small.

Hope these Ideas help.

Could you dig it up? I\'m quite interested in doing something more universal
and useful than the standard animal enc system esp regarding animal types
and activities. BTW I liked the T2300 pyramid system which at least forced
the ref to invent some plants to go with his Player Eating animals.

If not Latin, how about Vilani?  That seems to be like "latin" in the 3I. 
 Especialy in M:0.  And whats cool is that it isn\'t as dead as latin, but 
its not the \'common\' tounge either.

Maybe the TravLang group can help us out with this one?  :-)

With cheap power ANYTHING can be recycled but then there would probably be
no NonInd worlds in Traveller nor interstellar empires so leave that aside.
The idea that resources can be used up is totally ignored in PE and one
might say that they did it for reasons of simplification. Well it
simplifies some things but complicates others: why are ther NonInd planets
at all? What are the disadvantages of having all ypour pop on one big ball
with good resources? Why do PEs explore at all except for the fun of
killing each other off? Are there anybody out there that thought about this
and came up with fudges/solutions/answers?

Assembled by the small Martian ship construction cooperative known as
Phobos Yards, this custom designed pleasure yacht is a one of a kind
original initially designed as a mobile home and office for the Marquis of
Melanor.  The hull of the ship is a small iron-based asteroid recovered
from the nearby main belt in the Terran system. Perhaps the most
interesting features of the ship are the rooms and corridors where the
original rough, irregular surfaces of the asteroid have been preserved.
This was intentional and designed to evoke the dungeon-like feel of the
strange and mysterious underground passages beneath the Terran Mad Ludwig\'s
famous castle (which captured the Marquis\' imagination when he first saw
them).  Hence the name of the ship class. The following areas have not been
left "natural," for obvious reasons: Bridge, Engineering Deck, Cargo Hold,
Sick Bay, Hangar, Crew Staterooms, and most access areas. The remainder of
the ship, which includes most passageways, all the Staterooms, and the
special custom rooms detailed below, are of tunneled out iron rock. Control
panels, lights, fixtures, and other interfaces are tastefully set into the
rock walls, and blend into the surroundings to heighten the effect.

The Ludwig is a pleasure craft, wholly unsuited for travel in frontier
environments. To begin with it is unstreamlined, and has no facilities for
fuel scooping or purification. Access to a type A or B starport with
refined fuel is almost a necessity. This serves the purposes of the ship\'s
owner ideally, since he has no intention of using the vessel as anything
other than a mobile base from which to entertain and conduct his business.
Being a noble, his business rarely takes him out of the established
spacelanes. For planetside landings, the Yacht carries in its spacious
hangar a well appointed 30-ton Ship\'s Boat (The _Lippizaner_) that sees to
the Marquis\' needs quite well. The ship is unarmored, and only very lightly
armed with a light laser (fore) and sandcaster (aft). It has been designed
using TL-11 technology, so that it can be repaired and maintained on the
Marquis\' home planet.

There are two main features of the ship which stand out from regular
vessels, and they are described below:

Conference Room/Dining Hall/Ballroom

Taking up the entire top deck of the ship (w/ the exception of the elevator
which provides access) is a large room (30m x 20m). The walls (up to about
8\') have been carved out of the rough iron of the asteroid, and the top of
the room is a large, sealed dome, attached onto the "top" of the asteroid,
which provides spectacular space vistas in all directions. The dome can be
darkened when in Jumpspace. The room is used both as a Dining Hall and
Ballroom (the solid wood floor is perfect for this purpose). (Ref\'s Note:
The combination of spectacular vistas and the beautifully appointed antique
surroundings provides a juxtaposition which should get just about any ref\'s
descriptive juices flowing).

Grotto

One of the large staterooms has been converted into a beautiful secluded
grotto, complete w/ small waterfall and pool (all connected to the ship\'s
life support system). This area also has a large collection of tropical
plants, and appropriate wildlife noises can be pumped through the intercom.

The entire ship is decorated with splendid reproductions of Terran Baroque
and Rococo furniture and art. The Dining Hall features an ornate dining
table w/high backed chairs which seats up to 15 people comfortably. The
Louis XIV style is dominant, but other items are also present. Mirrors and
artwork decorate many of the rough-hewn walls, making the effect a most
astonishing one. Sconces w/ flickering florescent flames adorn the walls of
many passageways. The main stateroom features an ornate four poster bed and
matching dresser made of cherry.

There is a well appointed kitchen for serving special meals. (Design note:
This is in lieu of the Sick Bay, which is little more than a workstation,
automated medical assistant and medicine cabinet). Needless to say, the
crew are well taken care of and serve the Marquis with unquestioned loyalty.

Finally, when not in use, the cargo bay can be converted into a small
fencing venue, complete w/ spectator\'s seats and automated judging/scoring
system.

Note: There has been some talk about setting a whodunnit mystery abord a
starship recently. In my opinion, this ship would be ideal for the purpose.
Where mysteries are concerned, setting is everything...

But when I started playing Traveller it had two advantages - 1) it was
available in the UK at the time and (2) it was cheaper than the full
version. At the age of 12 the latter was very important!

Yes, I\'ve been very frustrated in trying to make sense out of the stellar
data produced by various sources and the rules themselves. The bias towards
white dwarfs all over the place shure needs fixing.

I need as much data as possible as I like realism in the deep space parts

UWP with stars, gGGS and belts is OK.

Leroy note a real world(tm) nebula that may be located in core sector somewhere.
PLEASE make this canon and sprinkle texts here and there with references like:

"As she viewed the land soon to become hers she notice for the first time
just how beautiful it was; illuminated by the core nebula the fields
shimmered weakly in strange colors like jewels. As she reluctantly returned
to the ballroom smiling at her guests she thought once again about ways to
inconspicuously killing her old father, the Duke"

Do not use it as a plot for Trecky adventures though.

On the other hand, some careers cannot be started late, while others can
be.  Losing a job is not equivalent to a failure to reenlist for a
businessman, but it is for a Navy man.

Yep.  Military careers had the right feel for a muster-out and a pension.

On the other hand, you had been paid a salary, and had saved (or not) some
amount of cash and things.  Since the system does not cover that, mustering
out is a fair way of handling it.

I might prefer one, though, that gave salaries and had percentages taken
away.  For example, a person with a total skill in the area equal to the
number of terms or the rank they hold gets a given salary.  If they live
normally, they have some money, some stuff and some debt.  The balance
between these would vary with world and culture, of course.

If they live carefully, they keep a higher percentage, but should probably
keep playing this miserly lifestyle, while if they live profligate, then
they have less cash, but might have more stuff or a higher perceived SS.

Yep.  That is a pain.

I believe it was Millennium\'s End that had a deal where you determined your
career each year, and then got a blob of skills and a blob of cash and
stuff each year.  Some careers had a chance to lose money as well as gain,
and could result in taking a term or two of the "jailed criminal" career.

>For realism sake, do we include negative MO benefits as well?

Perhaps, perhaps, but it would have to be carefully done.  I kind of like
the idea of getting some amount of stuff on a yearly basis, and the higher
the potential reward, the higher the risk.  Someone who saves carefully,
will have a nice, safe nest egg.  Someone who invests aggressively will
have either a much bigger one, or a much smaller one.  The charts can
reflect that by giving cash benefits based on an average, with potential
negatives, I suppose.

- - As we sat there waiting for Leroys long awaited revelations of his
perpetuum mobile machine we wondered at what direction humanity would move
now that we had infinite power at our hands. When he finally showed up he
apologized for his machine not working right due to vortexes in the ley
lines and told us that the experiment workesd flawlessly just a couple of
hours ago and that he was backed by powerful organizations who choose to
remain in secret. Leroy told us that despite all heartless debunkers he
siply ignored them and wanted to move on to greater things. His film of the
device had been stolen from his hotelroom the night before by unknowns
(Leroy hinted at government agents).

After the lights went on the awe started to wear off and as we drove home
an irritating feeling cropped up: was this all there was to it? What about
the proof that the pamphlet promised - heck it was even printed on the
ticket that "Our entire worldview would change forever" -

I like Leroys stuff on Traveller astronomy and I hope he doesn\'t take
offense in poking parodying him a bit but it felt like he was begging for
it.
I put a smiley here     ;)

Sound of semi terrorized player wimpering

Will treats this charecter like a wandering monster from Dungeons &
Dragons, or like a Demon - if you say his name, he may appear.  Every
time someone mentioned his name Will would roll to see if he would show
up in the adventure....

Which was why he could show up anywhere, even right after you had seen
someone put about 4 shots through his head.  His ship Amy seemed to
misjump at least 30 to 40% of the time, always in the direction the
story needed to take him.... At least one of my charecters was quite
convinced that Amy the Computer knows how to cause a controlled misjump.

Yes, I\'m sorry if I didn\'t introduce that paragraph clearly.  The regions

**Plot Spoiler Warning**



   In "Guns of the South" a historical novel by Harry Turtledove (one of
my favorite books by the way), the South is eventually able to come up
with gunpowder similar to that found in the bullets for the AK-47, and
make rounds that work in the weapon (Lee was worried about being
dependent on his "benefactors", for good reason).  However, it was also
explained that the new bullets would tend to dirty up the internals of
the weapon much more quickly than the original bullets, and would not
be completely smokeless.



   After the war ended, the North was able to take captured AK-47s and
make crude copies of them (along with the bullets).  While the new
weapons probably weren\'t as accurate or well machined as the original,
they were good enough to give the North a tremendous advantage, over 
their other neighbors, which they used to conquer Canada (nothing like 
a quick victory to help the masses forget a defeat).



   Back in the real world, gun makers on the Pakistan frontier in the
1980s were able to make copies of the AK-47 for the Afghan Resistance,
even though they were working in conditions that probably weren\'t much
more technologically advanced than those during the American Civil War. 
They did however have access to modern bullets.



   Having a piece of advanced technology (or should I say,
technologically beyond your current capabilities) in your hands allows
you to take all kinds of shortcuts and avoid technological blind alleys
that would otherwise slow your progress--so long as that technology is 
not so far advanced that its functioning appears magical.  This would 
explain at least part of the reason why the Terrans advance so rapidly 
from TL 9 to 11, but then slow dramatically as they crossed TL 12, even
though they had access to Ancients sites during the RoM.



   What is not explained in T4 is why the Syleans were not able to take
advantage of the relic technology that is apparently still around after
over 1500 years to advance their technological level.  Conspiracy
theories don\'t cut it, *but* Vilani influence and misinterpretations of
history would.  If, as I postulated some time back, historians of the
early Third Imperium ran across legends and stories that made them 
believe that the RoM had a tech level far in excess of what it actually 
was (TL 16-17, even 20-21 if credit is given to the humans of the RoM 
instead of the Ancients for some archeological sites), it is entirely 
plausible that they would conclude that one of the primary reasons for 
the fall of the Second Imperium was **unchecked technological 
development**.  Certainly the still rather conservative populace (many 
of ethnic Vilani descent) would accept such an explanation if it were
made into a coherent story backed up by believeable theories.  

   Only much later would the myth of a TL 15-16 RoM would be dispelled, 
and technological development on a faster pace be encouraged (the less
than 150 years it takes some worlds in the Third Imperium to get from TL
15 to 16).  Ironically, some of Leroy\'s supposed justifications for a TL 
16 RoM work quite nicely as the basis for the proposed canon RoM myths.

   A compromise?

Harold

Borrowing shamelessly from Andre Norton\'s Plague Ship...  How about some
of the crew and passengers (if any) come down with a new and potentially
deadly disease.  The medic can\'t isolate the agents responsible, the
patients are slowly getting worse, and the disease is spreading.  At this
point the PCs may also start to worry about being locked up in quarantine
for years, even if they survive. 

In the book, the "disease" turned out to actually be caused by bites from
several quite small, hard to locate (and hard to catch/kill) alien
critter.  However, the creatures left no obvious bite marks and stayed
hidden from the crew (in the book the critters were around a foot tall,
bipedal and insect-like) you could also make them able to change color to
add even more fun.  In the book, it also turned out that a rival company
had placed the critters on the ship, a good book, and a fun adventure...

Just as a side note...

Until an unfortunate accident recently, the adventuring party centered
around a scientist charactor who had his \'own\' lab ship.  Actually, the
lab ship belongs to the university that sponsered the PC, but he was also
saddled with two additional scientists with thier own agendas.

One of these scientists is a J-Space expert, and prior to jumping out the
first time, the previous captain of the lab ship strongly recommended to
the new that the lab be powered off during jumps!

Anyway, I was able to use the additional NPCs as foils for a number of
adventures.

Is it logical to mandate a fixed date for this one for EVERY world
in the Imperium? Or is this just for Imperium-wide institutions like
Naval Academies.

What about cultures where schooling isn\'t done in an institution,
where it might be done in the home? What about cultures where schooling
isn\'t done at all?

On agricultural worlds, this date might cause conflicts if the children
are needed to help with harvesting crops and the local year doesn\'t
have the same length as the Imperial one.

>         271     Thanksgiving

This one I find odd. In Canada and in the U.S. this holiday exists
because we\'re basically settlers from afar. Europe and Asia, to the
best of my knowledge, do not celebrate this one.

I figure that this holiday, if celebrated at all, would vary depending
upon the world you\'re on.

See my points above regarding the beginning of the school year.

Does this means that this entire week is a holiday? Damn, my characters
just went through the end of 1106 and I only gave 001 as a holiday.


The way I see it (YMMV), the Imperium has a "hands-off" policy to
local planetary culture, as long as the security of the realm isn\'t
threatened. Therefore there should be very few dictated holidays
from the Iridium Throne. Local holidays will almost always prevail over
Imperial ones. 

Having said that, I can still see 001, the Emperor\'s birthday and
Armed Forces day being used.

Ah well, just my two bits. 

As always, comments are appreciated and solicited.

Which is of course exactly the attitude that the Lentuli want to foster. 

Back on the selective breeding and genetics angle: 
I suggest that the Lentulis would keep a particular interest in new human
minor races, trying to select new genelines that they could add to their
own. They would have an ongoing programme seeking out the families
of Vilani super-centenarians for any they\'d missed (maybe aged 150+ as a
baseline?).

Quite correct, at least they don\'t celebrate it in Europe.  When we
first moved to Canada (I was 1 year old) we celebrated our first
Thanksgiving in a McDonalds, cause my parnets had no idea what it was
:-)

The only reason we celebrate it is because it\'s in recognition of the
first harvest in the New World by the Pilgrims of the Mayflower, and,
help from the Natives, etc.  Of course, even here in the North America
the date varies from October 13th in Canada, to the date of November
27th in the USA (never understood that, harvest is over by then...can
anyone Americans please tell me....), so I can\'t really see it being
standard throughout the Imperium.

Perhaps during the RoM, some Solomani bureaucrat on Sylea was from North
America, and introduced the holiday to Sylea.  It\'s been celebrated ever
since, and most have forgotten why, but Cleon, being brought up as a
good Sylean included it in his list of Imperial Holidays, the official
writeup of the holiday?

- --Imperial Holidays--
Thanksgiving (271):  A traditional Sylean holiday, first recorded during
the Rule of Man (Second Imperium) over 1500 years ago.  A day of thanks
for the year gone by, including a festive feast, and sometimes a
celebratory party of some sort.  As a favourite holiday of Cleon I
during his upbringing, this holiday was introduced to the Imperium when
the official calender of the Imperium was created in 1.  As such, it has
spread throughout Imperial dominated space as a standard holiday.

- -note:  Solomani sources dictate that the holiday originated on Earth,
but this information cannot be confirmed, and is thought to be some form
of Solomani propoganda.

Going with the description I gave, I can see the Imperium including
Thanksgiving.  I also see the calender as being a very important tool of
the Imperium.  They don\'t have that much to show their power of the
realm, but a calender is a very important item, and I can see strict
control being maintained, possibly in the Imperial Office of Calender
Control or whatnot.  In this Bureau, member planets would submit a
calender, and register holidays, etc. with the Imperial Office.  This
way, member planets get their own holidays, while the Imperium keeps
it\'s control over the dating system.

Shionty Belt has a large percentage of anti-matter.  It is interdicted for
safety reasons.  At least, that\'s the offcial story.

 In regards to scout uniforms, the only thing I know for sure is that by
 1100 the standard field duty uniform is the Tailored Vacc Suit. No mention
 is ever made of what color although the B&W pics always show it as some
 sort of dark color. Of course I\'m sure that change came about about TL14

I understand that the the Operations Branches all have tailored vacc suits
(do they give them to the bearucrats too, like the "leather bomber jackets"
of the USAF for morale? no offense intended)
But it seems unlikely that they live in the ding dang thing all the time,
that would be like me wearing my flight suit everywhere I went, on and off
duty.  (I do know a few guys like that ;-> , but most are young and think
they are irresistable)   Seems more likely that they would have some sort of
utility uniform for shipboard working.  Or are the ships so unreliable that
they could have a rapid decompression at any given moment(unlikely).

find it of some use. Remember that I am not a programmer, the last time
I actually wrote code was in a Comp Sci class in college back in 1985;
so I\'m having to learn a lot as I go. The last time I coded, OOP was just
Alley\'s last name :)

I\'d advise doing some reading on ecology. That\'s where I got my list,
from a pocket intro to ecology. But it\'s buried in storage along with
most of my library. :-(

Also a number of Native American civilizations. For example, it\'s
thought that the Anasazi culture and several others in the Southwest
and Mexico failed when either a climate change or a major failure in
irrigation structures occured. 

Low tech cultures that are within the first few generations of
irrigated agriculture are *very* vulnerable to "systems failure". They
usually have one dam that\'s been enlarged slowly over the years and if
it fails after the population hits a certain size odds are that there\'s
no way to build it up again in time to save them.

If Marc wants to stick with the Birthday generation chart he is using
now, perhaps the Calender should be the page facing this chart.

But using the Imperial calender the same day of the year is always on
the same day of the week.  So all the Imperium has to do when
designating a holiday in the first place is put it on a day that many
people on many planets are more likely to have off anyway, perhaps
Sixday or Sevenday.

Naturally this will not work for The Emperors Birthday (which will fall
on a random day of the week) but that is obviously an important enough
day that the Imperium will want to encourage its member states to let
people have the day off, as a "nation-building" kind of thing.

Triskedeskaphobes should note that using the Imperial Calender the 13th
is _always_ on a Fiday :)

Literal (official) translation:  Having reached out to the infinte all
around us, let\'s not stop there!

Notes:  Tone markings were omitted for the sake of clarity for Galanglophones.

The prefix /na-/ is a distributive, refering to a plurality of items
scattered here and there, rather than considered as a group.

The verbal suffix /-g(a)-/ is a "dimensional" affix, indicating movement or
activity that is increasing in intensity, or epxanding outwards from a
center.

The reduplication of the verbal root /LAAR/ indicates the imperfect aspect,
here perhaps signifying a continuous, habitual, or repeated action.  /LAAR/
itself means "to halt, to stop, to quit pursuit" and is closely related to
the root /LAR/ (4th tone) meaning "to practice self-control."  The verbal
suffix /-sha-/ basically indicates motion or action directed away from the
point of reference (usually taken to be the speaker); more idiomatically,
it often carries a formal or polite nuance of distancing the speaker from
the action in question.  The phrasing of this element should also be
considered in the context of the Vilani regard for "knowing one\'s limits."


Idiomatic back-translation from Vilani:  We\'re scattered out all over the
place, and let\'s just keep charging on blindly!

NB:  The usual Vilani abbreviation of this phrase, Na.Su.Su., happens to be
homophonic with the colloquial descriptive term /nasusu/.  As defined in
the standard glossary of Vilani slang:  "to possess a superabundance of
narcissism and machismo, suitable for public mockery."

Personally, I like this idea. Character generation needs to have the
possibility for a negative outcome each term so there is a disincentive to
stay in character generation until you\'re 50. Because aging rolls don\'t
start to meet characteristic increases until the late 40s, most Traveller
characters start out around the same age. There should be some tradeoffs in
character generation so younger characters have some advantage. I\'m not
saying they should be better, but there should be at least some advantage
(aside from Psionics characteristics, which do not play a significant role
in my campaign).

I agree completely. With gridless maps the referee can use whatever grid or
measuring system she or he prefers. Personally, I would measure area with
some taut string and photocopy some hex paper on transparencies for
measuring area. A gridless system is far more versatile than breaking
everything into discrete hexes, and works for areas smaller than 1 hex is
size.

Xen does misjup a lot... courtesy of the MT rules for misjups, most are not
dangerous. What peter fails to realize it that, when we ran under MT, 7%+
of the jumps the players mader were ALSO misjumps of one kind or another...
By MT stock rules, you\'ll have a 3/36 (~9%) chance of misjump, with 91 % of
misjumps being merely mild time variations from the "167" standards so
only1% of traffic actually goes off course, assuming casual use of
unrefined fuel, and passable maintenance.

And, since one PC decided that Xen could do a Controlled Misjump, he set
off to learn how to himself... Intentionally misjumping the ship more than
once. Good thing MT\'s misjump rules are so forgiving... something lacking
in T4\'s...

Sorry, but what\'s Thanksgiving? Not being a (North) American, I\'m not
certain how to interpret this?

I\'d be inclined to put in a few other Imperial holidays if you think it
appropriate, plus some text to say that perhaps these holidays such as the
Mid-Year Break have tended to change name over the years, reflecting the
names of great Imperial heros, e.g. "Cleon Day", "Admiral XYZ\'s Day", etc.

Perhaps Thanksgiving should be renamed as a general Religious Day, where
every religion across the Imperium is permitted to be practiced without
suppression by the local government, perhaps called "Freedom Day" or
somesuch generality? Perhaps it\'s a day on which Imperial pardons are handed
out to reformed criminals, and other such niceties. Needless to say the
degree to which it\'s enforced across the Imperium is limited, but it could
make for some interesting adventure hooks?

Anyone else got any views on what could be regarded as Imperium-wide
holidays? (It might be worth noting in the text for T4.1 that obviously
every world has its own set of holidays, etc. in addition to those given).

I much prefer a square grid system with grids in 1000 km, 100 km, 10 km etc
Please avoid the wargameish hexes though. the only reason for using hexes
would be that it was a tradition from the Vilani or somesuch (Hiver?) to
use hexes as mapgrids. The grids should only be guides for measurements and
terrain should compleately ignore the grids - no single terrain per
hex/square please.

Please can we have Tuday 45 as Valentine\'s day?  I\'d like the 
Valentine\'s rose to be canonical in some sense.

(It needn\'t be an Imperial holiday as such, but would be widely 
observed.)

Aren\'t school years likely to depend on local factors?  Lower TL 
worlds might have graduation just before the harvest, close schools 
for the winter, etc. -- and local years which are longer or shorter 
than 365 standard days might also interfere.

Indeed, will all schools be structured by year?  High tech flexible 
learning might be structured by ability, with a 7 year old rated at 9 
for languages (and learning mostly with nine year olds) but at 6 for 
maths.

What about Halloween (all Imperial kids dress up like aliens) and spring
break (all horny Imperials teenagers go to Vland to get drunk & pregnant).

Try the field branch mostly, although some of the operation office would

almost never wear one.

Well as I stated its a field uniform, which is fairly light and in many
respects looks like some sort of ships jumpsuit. I\'m sure that they have
many other types of uniforms and could have a shipboard uniform. Well in
the naval service, I can think of at least 6 uniforms that I owned; 2
dress, 2 working dress, 1 Utility , and 1 engineering smock/coveralls( a
shipboard only uniform. ). I do agree that in their off duty time they
would wear something else.

I can see it now... the Duke on the balcony, the crowd below chanting 
"Release Barabbas!  Release Barabbas!"  (Or possibly Roger...)

I\'d really love to run that particular adventure, but it would take a 
very mature group of players and I can\'t see it being published.  If 
it were reasonably subtle, the players mightn\'t catch on until near 
the end 8-)

I\'d say Holiday would be *the* day for such things; the Holiday 
pardons go well with the honours list.

For purely selfish reasons, Valentine\'s day (I\'ll repost the 
reasoning behind it if people want, but basically it was adopted by 
the Vilani under the RoM).  I can see Nobles treating it as a 
splendid custom.

Perhaps one Vilani-influenced holiday -- my preference would be to 
link Holiday with a Vilani "contemplation of empire" tradition.  
Something to emphasise that the 3I isn\'t just Terrans in Spaaaace.

What would the Imperium want to commemorate/emphasise?  Peace, trade, 
iteself of course, jobs, prosperity and the like.  A world would 
commonly celebrate the day it joined the 3I as a holiday -- many 
choose to join on Holiday, and the original worlds of the Sylean 
Federation will observe Holiday as "the day we founded the Imperium".

A science festival and a trade festival would be appropriate, but I 
don\'t have any good ideas for them.

T4\'s Starships says (pg 5)

"The Empire observes several standard holidays throughout the year. 
Apart from Holiday (Day 001), four other days are recognized as
Imperial-wide Holidays, all of which fall on a Oneday.  The Emperor\'s
(Cleon ?) Birthday is celebrated in Oneday 051.  Empire Day, celebrating
the achievments of the Imperial Military, is Oneday 114. Standard
Religious Holiday, for all religions to observe their most holy day, has
been standardized to fall on Oneday 184.  Finally Harvest Revel is held
on Oneday 282 to give thanks for the many blessings of the Imperial
Throne.  Differing regions and planets have other holidays added on, but
these are the Imperial decreed holidays that are observed regardless of
location."

You may want to make sure that the dates you use in T4.1 match those in
Starships.  This seemed to be one of the few things in Starships didn\'t
mess up. On the other hand if you are going to put these dates in the
T4.1 rulebook, then you can take them out of the new version of
Starships.  

I do suggest that you remove the Standard Religious Holiday listed as
occuring on Oneday 184 as it seems unlikely that the religions would not
protest this sort of thing very strongly, and some planets (Religious
Dictatorships) might avoid joining the Imperium soley to avoid this
government meddling in religion.

strangely enough I\'ve been working on this problem for a entirely different
reason. The best possible solution is for GMs/players to be able to tunnel into
any given hex and see that hex made up of other hexes, simple really. The the
onus is on the GM to make sure that the hexes at that level are defined (for
instance its unnecessary to define smaller hexes if the larger hex is all water
or all desert but if the terrain changes within that hex at a higher
resolution then they are defined at that higher resolution. also this makes
maps rather more dynamic as once the balance of terrain types swings from water
to land (for instance). the super cell above it becomes all land too.

Anyway suffice it to say I\'m working onb this at the moment and when I\'ve
finished my actual work :-) I\'ll create a traveller version.

Technology, if anything, advanced substantially from the Roman to the
Medieval period. I\'m sure Dr Clark will correct me if I\'m wrong,
but Lynn White\'s "Medieval Technology and Social Change" is still
pretty much holding up as a standard work, and is a damn good
read to boot (if apparently wrong in some matters of detail).

Whether or not long-distance trade collapsed after the end of the
Western Roman Empire is a hotly debated point. What I will say
is substantial evidence exists for trade across the North Sea,
between Constantinople and the Frankish Kingdoms and a large
trade in "tourism" through the movement of pilgrims to and
from the holy places of Christendom between the 5th and 10th
centuries.

Ian Whitchurch

PS I know it\'s bad form not to actually cite alleged evidence,
but I cant find the needed volume of Braudel ... I know the
first work about the continuity of trade during the "dark ages"
was Henri Pirenne\'s Mahomet et Charlemagne, in the late 19th
century. The rise of the view of the "Middle Ages" *as a time
of progress* can be dated from this book, IMO.

I am sure there are many many people in the growing Imperium who, when
confronted with the need to adopt the Imperial calendar posed the same
questiuon (perhaps substituting Imperial for "(North) American"). And without
official guidance, it may be that the holiday has different meanings on
different worlds (or in different regions).

For Tuday 045  to be Valentine\'s day, you\'ll have to enlist the support of
the greeting card companies.

As to school years, you see the great problems for calendar reform across
interstellar distances. The Imperium dictates few things, but calendar reform
is one of them. For those in the Imperium, this IS how they do things. At
least, this IS how the reports are filled out on Sylea. Locally, I\'m sure the
principals and administrators just do as they always have and then date the
diplomas 328-XXX.

Initially there will be conservative resistance to change. But a school year
needs to be about a year long. A system with a physical year half as long
would probably have twice as many grades teaching half as much each.

Just like a kid finishing High School a semester early and having to wait to
June for the diploma. Or someone in independent study having to wait until
the standardized tests are administered before he can actually get credit.
Schools are built around bureaucracies rather than for the needs of students
to get on with their lives.

secular, because the slightest foray into religion brings heat that they
would not want (like this probably will) in their formative stages. They
would probably begin entering into official religions once they were secure,
and had people believing in the ideals rather than just the economic
advantages.

Andy,

Who says that an Imperial Thanksgiving is directly related to the
North American holiday?  

Maybe we\'re all supposed to give thanks that the Imperium has come 
to being and included our world in its sphere of control, er, um, 
protection :-)

Or perhaps it is directly related and through the years has just 
devolved into a general day of thanks for what we have and has 
nothing whatever to do with religion at all. With its origins so lost 
in the mists of time no one remembers how it came to being.

The name portrays a simple concept, a day of giving thanks. How it is 
interpreted from there is up to the referee... at least until 
canonical references dictate otherwise.

Regardless, I\'m sure it isn\'t the celebration of pilgrims and three 
ships crossing an ocean on some planet to escape religious 
persecution.

>         271     Thanksgiving

This one I find odd. In Canada and in the U.S. this holiday exists
because we\'re basically settlers from afar. Europe and Asia, to the
best of my knowledge, do not celebrate this one.

I figure that this holiday, if celebrated at all, would vary depending
upon the world you\'re on. 
- ----end quote----

Thanksgiving as a harvest festival was originally an American custom that
migrated to Canada (although I should note that we celebrate a different day
up here).  England (and France) have Harvest Festivals, at least locally
celebrated in rural communities (speaking from experience).


I see the school days as representing Imperial academies, and possibly
Imperially-supported local universities.  In an effort to standardize, the
Imperium may well ride roughshod over local customs (or some planetary
givernors might).  Hmmm.

Adventure idea: players are on a world which has just converted everything to
Imperial calendar, under orders from insensitive Imperial governor.  School
is in session - in the middle of local hurricane season (when all sensible
people used to remain in shelters).  Players must help rescue schoolchildren,
and then convince governor that not everything can be changed.  Plot twist:
players discover that governor has no opinion on subject, but enthusiastic
planetary government decided to throw away all local institutions so that
planet would not be regarded as \'hicks\' - players must convince local
government that Imperium doesn\'t care about local caledars as long as
citizens can convert to Imperial for offworld transactions.  (Hint: play on
hero status, and shamelessly use Imperial citizenship as \'authority\')


What I would like to see on the Imperial holiday list would be some
commemorative battles and major events.  For example, up here we still have
Victoria Day (although that has become just a long weekend, almost no one
honours the dead queen anymore).  But the equivalent of the D-day landings,
Hiroshima, and so on would at least be remembered.   This would be an easy
way of introducing Imperial history.

I think we should avoid Amerocentric and Terracentric holidays in the
Imperial calendar. Adding days like Thanksgiving tends to perpetuate the
\'Minnesota-in-space\' syndrome that can detract so much from the atmosphere
of a game set amongst thousands of alien stars in a time when our present
culture will be dead and forgotten.
     You should also remember that public holidays are a subtle instrument
of the state - a means of reinforcing a particular cultural vision,
ideology, religion or whatever. With this in mind I think imperium-wide
holidays will tend to be limited to days such as Holiday, which celebrate
an event of universal political and cultural significance to the worlds of
the Third Imperium. The start and end of school years will be local
affairs.
     By the way, did you know that in Britain the monarch has two
birthdays? One is his/her own birthday and this changes from monarch to
monarch. The other is the Official Birthday which is a public event and
takes place on the same date every year. Cleons official birthday is much
more likely to be a cause for a public, imperium-wide holiday than the end
of the school year.

While many of my parents send their kids to school when they are _extremely_

Well, I\'ve delved back through my Library Data references and, well, *gasp*
could I be WRONG??! The best I can come up with is the MT Encyc which says
Capital has been the seat of government since the founding of the Third
Imperium - no mention of the name change. My Amiga is still packed away (we
moved house a month ago) so I can\'t check the HIWG references; this _may_ be
where I got the reference from. However, that would still make it
unsubstantiated.

So! where does that leave us? Well, I better fix my web Library Data, for
one. ;-)  And yes, the fact that Mileau 0 calls the planet Sylea does seem
to be a give-away...

I like Michael Barry\'s idea that the term "Capital" found initial usage in
slang. I also like Andrew Boulton\'s idea, that the _official_ name change
occurred when Artemsus Lentuli took over as the third Emperor. That really
sounds quite plausible. You can just see Art "weeping" over poor old Cleon
I\'s grave and promising the citizenry that he, Artemsus, will keep the
"wonderful legacy left to us" alive and well - with a nod and a wink to the
nobility, of course.

As Andrew says, the city now known as "Cleon" was probably renamed at the
same time.

BTW, the excerpts from _Scouts and Assassins_ were not meant as "canon"
references; that\'s why I said "S&A _suggests_...." This has not been a
"canonical" reference for Scouts ever since GDW wrote Book 6, even if it had
some neat ideas. ;-)

However, for those who think that different domains may have different
uniforms, or that uniforms change over time [insert "Star Trek" reference
here], or otherwise like throwing their players a variant to keep them
awake, it\'s a suggestion.

Douglas, of the RCCC, is correct (presumably the anti-matter is left over
from whatever destroyed the planet).

However, he will be forced to undergo a retraining course as he failed to
pick up that the system is called _Shionthy_!  ;-)

(It\'s available in my Library Data pages, BTW - including rules for avoiding
the antimatter).

A given Imperial world will use two calendars. One, its local calendar,
will use units of local days and season-cycles (what we call years).
This assumes that the world has a decent-sized agricultural sector
of the economy. Seasons become all-important then. Weeks and months
are units of convenience only.

Now, this world is also a member of the Imperium. Therefore it deals
with offworld citizens and Imperial institutions. A common frame of
reference is needed and that\'s why the Imperial calendar is a standard.

The locals will use the local calendar in all situations except those
where the Imperium is involved. Then they will convert the local date
and time into the Imperial date/time system. Naturally, hand computers, 
watches and other instruments which have clocks will be able to 
instantly flip back and forth between the two systems.

For example, let\'s say we have a world with a sidereal year of 200 days.
Its day (measured from sunrise to sunrise and averaged over the year)
is 20 hours. After a few hundred years, I\'d say that the local populace
will be quite used to this cycle. Their crops grow by it. Their 
livestock live by it. Humans, by nature, prefer to do outdoor things
in the daylight, so they plan by it.

Why on earth (pardon the pun) would they stick by the Imperial calendar?
Yes, indeed, it\'s 3:00 AM (Imperial), the sun is shining, yet all the
businesses are closed for the "night". It\'s harvest time, but it\'s 
also Holiday, so farmer Jones (Vilani: Jiiiinnnegggi?) can\'t find anyone
to hire? 

Embassies, consulates, Imperial military installations, interstellar
merchant lines, passenger liners and starports would use the Imperial
calendar. The local government offices and shops whose customers 
primarily use the Imperial calendar would use both systems. Most local
citizens would use the local calendar and would never need to convert.

Thoughts, anyone?

Yes maybe, but the guys (me included) buying the IG products will think
that the game designers were lazy when they couldn\'t come up with original
holidays no matter what the designer thought. I\'d say most Imperial
holidays will be less abstract and more concrete celebrating achievements
of the Imperium/emperor precursors to the Imperium: The official conclusion
of the Grand Survey, the emperors coronation. The passing of the first
Imperial credit (trade festivals on lots of planets) etc.

Just say NO to yanks in space!

There\'s a novel by Larry Niven which involves a protosun of antimatter
that is passing through the galaxy at abt 0.8c ... you get a lot of
strange effects there. I think the novel was a part of _Neutron Star_ but
I won\'t swear on it. In any case, folks, bring your anti-rad suits... it\'s

How about a holiday in each sector celebrating the founding of the
first output in that sector? You could have Spinward Marches day,
Deneb day, and so on.

Actually, say no to Terrans in space, as far as cultural holidays go.

Anders\' obviously tongue-in-cheek response to this debate echos my own.
(And I\'m a Yank! <g>)

We\'re talking about a civilization 2500 years in the future. Taking a look
2500 years *backward* from here, did the Ancient Greeks, Assyrians or
Egyptians celebrate Armed Forces Day or Thanksgiving? And furthermore, how
can you mandate when school starts and stops or when the "mid-year" break
occurs. I know there\'s the "Officer of Calendar Compliance" but you\'re
going to have local holidays, some of which will have religious or other
cultural significance that the Imperium won\'t be able to remove.

I have a player in my Regency campaign group who described his character as
Scottish Solomani and Zhodani descent. I told him that the likelihood of
him maintaining an uninterrupted line of Scottish blood, especially as far
away as the Regency, was next to none over the 3700-year (Regency occurs in
year 1200) intervening period. Let\'s not forget that things have changed
over this period of time.

While dates 001-365 and reservation of date 001 as "Holiday" are mandated
per the old Supplement 8, Library Data, the rest of the calendar year
should be left alone for the individual cultures to determine. Otherwise
you risk turning the Imperium into a culturally biased macrocosm of the
20th century United States. If there\'s one thing I\'ve always liked about
Traveller, it\'s that it makes an attempt to not cater to any one
20th-century nationality or culture. I don\'t want to see "Yanks in Space"
any more than our British, Norwegian, Danish or other nationals on this
list.

Best,

of the class is given here.  Price includes approx. Mcr 8 to construct
and equip the Dining Salon, Kitchen, Rec. Room, Pool and Hot Tub
chamber.  There\'s also a few tons left over (40m^3 or so) which has
been put to widening passeges, adding decorated alcoves, and generally
making life more comfortable on board for the passengers. 



Wandering Star Charters

Mail Code Sylea-Botania 38312


Gentleperson, 


Thank you for your inquiry regarding our luxury charter craft. 
Currently we have available several vessels of the _Eastern Star_ Class
luxury Yacht built by the Goodenuf Construction Company of Sylea.  The
vessel which seems to fit your schedule is the _Rising Star_, a 500 ton
luxury liner.  I have appended a description below.  Please contact me
soon with your intentions since the liner\'s schedule must be set well
in advance to assure our low prices.  


Speaking of prices, the _Rising Star_ is available, fully crewed, for a
cost of Mcr 1 for each two weeks (Four week minimum, round trip
required).  There is a strict list of available destinations due to
potential problems outside Cleon\'s Imperium, but any destination within
the Imperium which has no travel restriction is quite acceptable.


The Rising Star


Built in the Year 26 by the Goodenuf Construction Company, the _Rising
Star_ is truly a Jewel in the Wandering Star line of vessels.  The
custom package fitted in this vessel includes a multi-purpose
recreation room, a specialized swimming pool which can be configured
for constant flow lap swimming, a steamy hot tub, and a celestial main
dining salon, with incredible views of the stars (while in normal
space, of course).  All staterooms are two rooms; a bedchamber and a
parlor, and are luxuriously appointed.


Layout and Configuration


The ship\'s sleek lines have been commented on since the first of the
class was built.  The smooth manta-shaped body is equipped with a
Starcaster(TM) maneuver drive capable of 3 standard gravities of
acceleration, and the Mark II Quick-hop Hyperdrive carries the vessel 2
parsecs per jump, and double redundant Zhunastu Fusion+(TM) power
plants provide.


The forward section of the vessel\'s hull reveals the now-famous Dining
Salon observation windows on the lower half of the hull, with the
Ship\'s bridge occupying a small bulge on the upper half.  Two light
laser turrets are mounted port and starboard of the center section on
the upper hull towards the aft of the vessel, while the main armament,
a single heavy laser emitter, is mounted flush with the dorsal hull in
the center so as not to interfere with the ship\'s landing operations.


Hull sections taper to either side of the main portion of the hull,
acting as atmospheric control surfaces and giving the ship a
streamlined look. A long tapering aft hull section contains drives and
the 40 ton ship\'s boat hangar.  An additional hangar for a vehicle of
up to 12 tons is available for Guest\'s vehicles and can accommodate
either ground or grav vehicles (A luxury speeder is also available for
an additional fee).  A 35 ton cargo bay with a ventral loading hatch is
available for guest use, and can also accommodate vehicles.


Internal accommodations justify the reputation of the vehicle class. 
Each passenger stateroom suite has two rooms, a bedchamber and parlor. 
The bedchambers are draped in rich fabrics from different sections of
the Imperium, covering the walls and ceiling and giving the illusion
that guests are in some noble mansion, rather than traveling through
space.  Oversized canopy beds are made up fresh daily (or more often if
you wish).  Deep-stained hardwoods make up the dressers, bedframe, and
other furniture, while elegant flagstones and beautiful handmade rugs
cover the floors.  


A stone fireplace adorns each parlor, along with large comfortable
chairs and divans in a styles from Vilani times.  The fireplace gives
off a gentle warmth and flickering light of real flame, but requires no
manual feeding.  A wet bar gives instant access to whatever snack or
beverage the guest wishes to have on hand, while a fully stocked bar
and kitchen is available at all times in the main dining salon.  Access
terminals are ingeniously hidden until needed for work.  A large oaken
table is set against one wall which can be employed as work surface or
dinner table if the guest takes meals in.


We hope, though, that the guests will attend dinner in the main Dining
Salon each night.  Our expert Chef prepares an incredible meal each
evening in his well appointed kitchen.  The room in which this meal is
served makes all occasions special.  Up to 17 ebony high backed chairs
(one for each passenger assuming double occupancy staterooms plus one
for the Captain) can be set around the solid Obsidian table, on which
the gleaming blue stylized tableware positively sparkles, and the solid
crystalline glasses gleam with an inner light.  the room is paneled
with rare vlandian deep-rose quartz, and a gentle golden light is
emitted from frosted-glass sconce fixtures around the room, as well as
the electric blue crystalline chandelier overhead.  


Backlit glass cabinets along one wall of the room display the ships
service; bowls of rare crystal, plates and flatware of different new
and ancient style in materials that make the most jaded visitors gawk,
serving dishes of the finest silver, rare liquors and fine vintage
wines from all over the Imperium and beyond are displayed for your
appreciation.


What draws the eyes however, especially in orbit, is the wall of glass
that makes up the front wall of the salon.  Polarized crystal viewports
look out on whatever vista is  presently displayed, and can be
conveniently blacked out in jumpspace or during a burningly bright
reentry.  The windows angle from your feet outward, giving a falling
sensation any who stand by the glass.  The view is broken only by
narrow structural supports, necessary for safety reasons.  Generally
dinner is served by the light of the stars or the light reflected off
the orb of whatever planet lies below.  When this light enters the
salon, the chandelier fractures it into a million beams which throw
ever-changing beautiful patterns on the walls and ceiling of the
chamber.


When not dining, guests can still be entertained and kept in shape in
the 12 meter by 6 meter exercise pool.  In exercise pool mode a
constantly adjusting current is maintained to keep the swimmer in place
as she or he completes their desired distance swim.  It can even be
adjusted so that when the swimmer reaches the end of the 12 meter
length of the pool they have actually swum a simulated Olympic sized
pool length.  At its deepest end, the pool is 2 meters deep.


Near the pool is a hot tub, the relaxing heated tub provides a gentle
means of easing muscles overworked in the exercise room just to
starboard, and has the option of operating in zero gravity with a
breathing apparatus, an experience that has to be felt to be believed. 
Aquatic scenes decorate the ceramic interior of the tub, hand painted
and custom made for the ship.


The aforementioned exercise room has many standard high tech resistance
and weightlifting equipment, and a small games court which can be
configured for a number of games (Some take the entire exercise room,
and other equipment is stowed when used for this purpose).  Gravity is
fully adjustable, so those incredible slam dunks are now easy, no
matter what shape you are in.  And if you want a real workout, add 30%
to the gravity and see how hard roto-ball can really be.  This double
height room is the mirror image of the pool section, and is at the same
level as the bottom of the pool, but on the opposite side of the ship.


A fully stocked sick bay staffed by a full time doctor is on board to
meet any medical need.  In addition we have spared no expense in making
sure our passengers are delivered safely.  Three laser and a defensive
sandcaster are carried, and at 3G acceleration, there is only a very
small likelihood that our well trained gunners would have anything to
shoot at.  Sensors, communications and other equipment are all
state-of-the-art Imperial technology, not backwater imitations. Our
components are manufactured for us to exacting specifications, not
"cookie cutter" standard components which have been outsourced to
who-knows-where.  You will meet and get to know your captain during
your journey, so you can be confident about how the ship is being
handled.  A full staff of 6 stewards and a chef see to your every
need.


We hope you will join us as we cruise among the stars of the Imperium!



Design Notes


Designed using SSDS by way of Andrew Akins design template (The
"Starship Assembly Line").


Obviously this ship is built for ambiance, not to make money (not the
usual way, anyway).  


Glean what you can from the text regarding shape and layout.  I
envision a shape like a flattened horseshoe crab, with drive sections
to either side of  the ship\'s boat hangar, which sort of overhangs the
stern cargo hatch.  The reference to "atmospheric control surfaces" was
more fanciful than factual since the vessel is streamlined only, not an
airframe.  The shape I envision does, however, somewhat resemble a
flying wing.


The pool and rec room each occupy 490 m^3  I would be interested to
hear if anyone thinks this is insufficient.  The hot tub is between the
two and occupies 22m^3.  It should also have an airlock, but the design
does not include one.  The dining salon occupies 252m^3 at the bow of
the vessel.  It should be considered a serious vulnerability in battle.
 I added 40m^3 to the Kitchen, theorizing that most shipboard galleys
are tiny efficient little affairs unworthy of the attention of a chef.


Gunners double as stewards (wouldn\'t the passengers love to hear that?)
when not gunning.  3 stewards are also on the crew and are full time. 
They will all be able to cook, but one is the master chef (no extra
salary is figured into the cost though).  The doctor is also employed
as a passenger liaison, and the Captain is expected to dine with the
passengers.


A standard (but well furnished) 40 ton pinnace is docked in a hangar on
the aft dorsal portion of the craft.  Forward of and beside this are
crew quarters, with the bridge at the bow of the upper deck.  To the
right and left of this central "spine" are the oversized rec room and
pool, with the hot tub room beneath the spine.  Beneath the Bridge
itself is the dining salon.  Outboard, in front of, and behind the
\'big\' rooms are the passenger staterooms which often have one square
meter observation ports when possible.


Each passenger stateroom is actually one large stateroom and one small
stateroom.  They are either single or double occupancy, as desired by
passenger.  


This vessel costs almost 400,000 credits per week to operate (including
mortgage)!  Obviously this expense is either going to be paid by a very
rich owner, or some profitable run must be found where the passengers
pay 50,000 per week (single occupancy) for transportation, and the ship
runs full all the time.  I had the idea of a luxury charter service. 
This allows rich nobles to travel in style without actually buying a
vessel.  Rather than paying passage (and being unable to control what
riffraff occupies the other staterooms), they rent the whole vessel by
the month.  In any case, low operating cost is obviously not a
priority.

Somehow, I can\'t picture Vland as being a hot Spring Break destination.  A

Hmm...

Term 1: university. made the honours roll (but only just!)
Term 2: probably counts as bureaucrat. Blew the survival roll for the last 
year and retired.

IIRC Starter came out after Deluxe* (which is the one I bought), and 
wasn\'t significantly cheaper. Plus, if you like it, you\'ll want to get 
the proper version later, which means you\'ll end up paying more in the 
end. Of course, if you *don\'t* like it, you won\'t have wasted as much 
money, but who wouldn\'t like Traveller...?

*T4 needs a deluxe version - boxed, w/scenario, full-colour sector map, 
etc.

The PE rules seem heavily geared towards TL 11-12 because there\'s ltlle
provision for decreased transport costs at higher TL and as far as I can
tell you\'d never manage an empire the size of a sector efficiently let
alone the Imperium.
Perhaps some alterations of the transport formula (was it 1 + Parsecs/2?)
for different TLs.

I\'m fiddling around with a compleately different set of rules for governing
small empires with less calculations and realism(+) and more geared towards
producing the canon TL increases, empire sizes, population distributions
etc.
(Any Leroyish RoM TL hikes would automatically generate an encounter with
Yaskoydroy with a hangover ;)

Yes I agree but curiously enough the problem of "Terrans in space" seem to
coincide with "Yanks in space" to a large degree. My good and friendly
nature prohibits me from delving on shortcomings in historal and cultural
education amongst those suffering from the above mentioned syndromes ;)

Yep, CORPS figures your stating funds based on your highest applicaple

"Rifle" is an appropriate skill), and then you get double that amount in
goods.

I for one like hexes because they provide a more uniform "distance

to the opposing corner is only 1.26 times the total distance of the hex
as measured from face to opposing face.  For a square corner to corner
goes up to 1.41 times--almost double that for the hex.  This fails to
address other reasons why others do not like hexes, but explains one of
the reasons I do.  Maybe gridless maps, with an overlay transparency of

answer.

It well might.  I have downloaded the brief intro for core, but I have not
yet decided whether to snag the whole thing.

Last week, we started a PE game.  In order to set it up, I ended up having
the entire family do a bidding war for the major stats a\' la Amber.  I
updated the four stats a bit - Physical, Lore, Interpersonal, and Military,
but other than that, ran it fairly straight.  The setup was surprisingly
fun, but I have not yet had a chance to play a full session.

I think I will use the Castle Falkenstein skill system for the next set of
characters.  It was easy to explain, easy to use, but required a whole lot
of DM interpretation, which I do anyway.

	1) Does this mean if they have already gotten a degree they can\'t

It is really funny that this got turned into silent supporters routine.
Also notice that in any attempt at an unbiased poll, pollsters do not
stand around outside debate halls to poll people, unless the point of
the poll is to see who won the debate.  Voting here persuades me very
little, and we should stop offending the rest of the world where
government is not always the American system, not that the American
system really votes on anything at a high level.

Several people (seemingly very rational people) posted enthusiastically
when I posted what I did.  I have stated for the record that I ran a
campaign where Terra returned to the former glory of it\'s past, and
returned to TL16.  Others have posted in the same spirit, which pleases
me that there were a few who wanted to stand up and take some of rotten
tomatoe tossing with me. :)

For me, the bottom line is having fun.  A good referee can easily handle
high tech in a campaign, and GOD knows I have to reign in J.P. a lot when
I set up. :)

Would I allow a TL14 vacc suit to appear anomalously?  RESOUNDINGLY YES,
and I have run a campaign long enough that I wouldn\'t need some TL16
theory of the RoM to explain it.  I have _always_ taken the published
domain of the Traveller universe as a challenge to incorporate with mine.
At the same time, I wouldn\'t accept the lack of TL14 vacc suit showing
up as lack of proof that the RoM was higher tech.

Hell, by the time the MT Rebellion era was getting its footing with the
Digest issue on Capital, my CT campaign was going strong in _1180_ Imperial
dating!!

I have digressed.  Silent Supporters.  Indeed.  If I hadn\'t seen the
(so far) resounding agreement on the "Stars in Traveller" post that Marc
asked me to start, I wouldn\'t have thought it possible for more than 4
people on TML to agree about anything! :)

Hey, I only said it was an interesting compilation.  It proved to be an
excellent exercise in learning about TML.  I was interested only in the
fact that the notion "of Traveller\'s history, is accepted by some, as
not exactly cast in stone."

I first brought up the least little bit of thread on this on the HIWG
manipulator list over a year ago now.  You can ask Harold Hale, Steve
Bonneville, or Scott Galliand if you don\'t believe me.  This was a
notion of "what might have been" and it was put out by myself and J.P.
at the time, just based upon what was in print in the past.

Interestingly enough, this was _before_ any notion of a high tech level
RoM in the T4 pages, because none had yet been released.  Like it or not,
a high tech RoM is in the canon, and now that T4 is the latest canon, it
is _more_ canon than ever before.  I just wanted to point out how much
support there was for it, and it is _perfectly_ valid as a plot device.

A high tech RoM should be no offense to anyone for several reasons,

  1)  it all happened a long time ago and should be of little
      consequence to anyone with a lick of sense refereeing a
      campaign; I don\'t know anyone who runs a campaign with
      every piece of rules anyway, witness the discussion that
      proved beyond a shadow of doubt about how much terraforming
      you can do at TL 12.

  2)  if RoM was TL16 max, I would probably recommend never running
      a milieu set in it, unless you had great experience keeping
      tech within the bounds of the campaign;  anyone who ever ran
      a late-CT/early-MT campaign in the Spinward Marches has
      Darrian or Deneb to deal with;  as Mark Clark posted, it was
      a player amusement park on Darrian, but the G-shops of Deneb
      would give a referee a thing or two to think about; impossible,
      NO.

  3)  You could always do what I have always done with something I
      disagreed with, either just plain don\'t use it, or put a spin
      (ala Clinton, Hale, et al) and redefine it.

>I like Leroys stuff on Traveller astronomy and I hope he doesn\'t take

>I put a smiley here     ;)


If you can\'t laugh at yourself, you take yourself way too seriously. :)

If you can\'t laugh at someone else, they take themselves way too
seriously.

As I have said before, it is very difficult to offend me.  First, you
have to be someone I know and respect to be able to offend, and then I
ignore all the emotion, and just get to bottom of it.

BTW, respect is earned, not automatically given.  That could be why I
heard so much intolerance of intolerance, but I place no pecking order on
places like TML, HIWG list, or any internet chat site.  Everyone has a
right to opinion, but nobody should make Traveller a living hell.  This
is all about having fun, and little about who offended who.  All of that
poppycock smacks of political correctness.  A friend, whom I quoted in
a paper I did last year on PC, said:

   "There is a notion on college campuses of a right from being
    offended.  There is no such right.  If someone tells me,
    \'I\'m offended\', I reply, \'So?\'"


Flames to /dev/null or \'who am i\'@localhost

Again, I have digressed.  I would not let any post taint my opinion of
anyone, though I have had a thorough lesson in watching the politics
of TML unfold.  I am very interested in fixing the Astronomy aspect of
Traveller, and I would not allow anything to distract me from that goal.

>interview with Marc Miller in one of the Digests; Portraying the Solomanis

Interestingly, it seems trendy to psycoanalyze the writers of past pieces
of Traveller material.  But, when the facts are put in print, not every
purchaser of the game has that insight.  Nor does that have any real
meaning.  These are the things that are always paramount on my mind.

While I\'ll probably go to bat with your assumption concerning a Scots blood
line in the Regency, I\'m afraid I cant agree concernign other areas of the
Imperium.
Many worlds, particularly in Rimward areas of the Imperium, are described
as having a cultural flavor much like those who settled it.

Huy Braseal in the Solomani Rim comes to mind.  A strongly anti-Solomani
world  ( in the Imperium in the 1100\'s ), which has so strong a Scots bent
that they still wear kilts.  There are other examples of this throughout
the Rimward areas.

But, I must agree, that being in the Regency, it would be unlikely.

BTW, what exactly would a Scots/Zho be like??

No good - Remember the reason that was given for not using
English (as contrasted with Galanglic)?  Primarily, that it would
be too recognizable?  That applies to Vilani, as well - we have
definitely a whole planet and probably an entire cultural region,
which used Vilani routinely for several thousand years before the
rise of the Third Imperium.

It\'s extremely likely that Third Imperium Galanglic is a mishmosh
of whatever English had become by the time of the RoM, plus
Vilani, and plus regionally prominent languages in the various
regions, forming dialects.  Someone who was monolingual in
Galanglic would probably be able to decipher a large amount of
"Classical" Vilani.

Languages do that kind of thing.  Remember that English as we

  Volume dropped off to almost nothing, currency circulation
(esp. gold), ditto. Land routes were a poor attempt to replace
oceanic trade, and explains why some routes maintained traffic
or were created whole.

  The essential point, that of traffic drop-off below the
level needed to sustain the Roman world-economy, is 
accepted/promulgated pps. 101-103, The Identity of France,
vol. II. Actually, it sounds a _lot_ like the rationale
for the fall of the RoM, which otherwise makes very little
sense outside the humanities.

The Athenian Class Trader is the first ship design by the Auroran firm
of E.P. Aquana and Offspring. It was designed for the first RCSA ship
design competition, for a survivable Wilds Trader that would be
attractive to Free Traders. We liased with many Free Traders and
Coalition Corporations as to their \'ideal\' small trader, and this is the result.

The hull is of 250 displacement tons, a bit larger than ordinary
traders. Then again, those traders were designed for the Old Imperium,
not the Wilds. Of disc configuration, it catches the eye because of
many features, firstly it\'s airframe design. If this ships contragrav breaks 
down in the wilds it is still capable of safely refueling at gas giants
and landing. It also has a beefed up internal structure - to counter
turbulence and to enable the ship to set down at sea under stormy
conditions - Waterworlds are no obstacle to this ship. As one gets
closer something peculiar is noticed - it has three large cargo
hatches. The fact is that one of these 
hatches is for the passenger pod that is carried near the front of the
ship. A Free Trader wishing to run cargo can purchase the ship without
the pod, and lug lucrative items about in the 73 displacement ton hold
- - almost as impressive as that of a Subsidised Merchant. Anyone wishing
to run a mixed load just leaves it in, cutting cargo to 53 tons, but
adding staterooms for 9 more medium passengers. Other pods are being
designed, including a 19 berth low passenger pod, a shop pod, a lab
pod, and a vehicle pod. If the owner wants to carry more pods he can, 2
more can be fitted behind the other cargo hatches. This does 
however leave the remaining 13 tons of the bay inaccessable. These pods
are built to TL-8 standards, meaning they can be built and supported at
a large amount of facilities in the Coalition - and the Wilds. One last
thing might catch your eye before you enter the ship - at the end of
the wing root, a small \'pepperpot\'. This is the dispenser for the
ship\'s decoys - 15 carried in each dispenser. It adds about 3/4 of a
million credits to the price of the ship - but 
they\'ll help bring her back safe.

While going inside you\'ll notice the thickness of the hull, armoured to
a reasonable level. The hull is also constructed to TL-8 standards to
allow it to be manufactured at any of the Coalition\'s shipyards. The
power plant is designed to TL-10 standards and the comms to TL-9 for a
similar reason. Looking around it seems much like any other ship, but
unlike most ships this one comes with weaponry installed. One AurTech
TL-11 80Mj Laser sits at the apex of the ship. This reliable weapon is
overpowered so it can fire off a shot every 20 
seconds - handy if some Teddie\'s fired a couple of missiles at you
whilst you\'re running for the Jump radius. An Eosian Sandcaster fills
out the weaponry in the dorsal position. A small hangar fills out the
requirements for owners that want a air raft. After that there\'s
nothing else to say about the ship - it hauls cargo, people, and will
get you there and back safely. Simple. It\'s flexiblity, with it\'s pod
design, ensures that no matter what the economic climate in our 
Coalition in the future, the Athenian will be making good money in it.

Designed in 1201 the Pandora was the first commercial vessel designed at
Hiver Tech. Originally dismissed as, "to expensive to be practical," the
Pandora quickly found acceptance among the intelligence operatives of RCES.
With it\'s characteristically "bland exterior" and uncommonly rugged design
the Pandora has been utilized with great success on a number of particularly
sensitive intelligence gathering operations.

With it\'s respectable sensor package, electronically masked hull and
moderate performance characteristics the Pandora is able to act as a mobile
listening post for the Reformation Coalition while still maintaining a
respectable profit margin due to the size of it\'s hold. While it\'s offensive
capabilities are somewhat limited with it\'s complement of Hokhok missiles
and retractable Plasma turret the Pandora begins to live up to it\'s
namesake. Finally, the Pandora\'s hold has been specially designed to
function as either a cargo hold or an adapter for specially designed
multi-mission pods displacing up to 50 tons.

The first Pandora was completed in late 1201 and four more were finished by
the middle of 1202. Currently, RCES plans to expand it\'s fleet of Pandora\'s
to ten by the end of 1203.

The Hokhok Missile was designed to be mounted in the specially designed
belly slings of the Pandora Class Wild\'s Freighter.  Powered by the
newly developed TL13 Fusion power plant, the Hokhok has been able to
acheive a number of G-Turns vastly superior to it\'s contempararies.
Originally conceived as an armed intelligence drone the Hokhok was
quickly modified into an effective search and destroy weapon.  Small
enough to pass unnoticed in many systems and possessing respectable
stealth capablities the Hokhok is utilized to covertly listen in on
ground transmissions while the Freighter maintains a descrete distance
and then once the Freighter has decided to land the Hokhok is often
left behind to provide high cover.  With its triple warhead system the
Hokhok is often simply used as a delivery system for the two smaller
warheads thus allowing the larger missile to be simply recovered and
utilized again when the time is right.
The Hokhok\'s only drawback is it\'s hefty price tag, at close to 4.5 MCr
a unit they have yet to be widely embraced by any service.  However, a
number of these missiles were recently purchaces by RCES and modified
for as yet unknown duties.

Sojourner Wilds Trader

The Sojourner is KeeEEka Strongwall\'s entry into the Coalition\'s competition
for a new Wilds Trader.  It is the first ship designed by the shipyard, and 
if it is chosen, the shipyard hopes that it will be just the first in a 
long line of Schalli designed and built ships. While it is built by Schalli,
it is designed for use by humans.  

TeeCLEEEoo Blackfin, the chief designer of the Sojourner, designed the ship
to succeed in the unique situation that the Wilds present.  The ship is
heavily armored, not so much for space battles, but in case a
local planetary leader tries to steal the ship. The Jayhawk Far Trader
is so lightly armored, that it barely protects against small 
arms fire. The Sojourner\'s hull is five times as thick and is capable of
withstanding light anti-tank weapons, grenade launchers, anti-aircraft guns,
mortars, recoilless rifles and some artillery pieces.  The ship also is 
capable of protecting itself.  It has a belly turret with four VRF gauss
guns mounted in it,  each gun has 60,000 rounds of ammunition in the turret.
The VRF Gauss guns are built on Fija, and are standard RC issue, which is
also compatible with relic Imperial models. This will make it easier
to acquire spare parts if an break down occurs. An autocannon was 
contemplated, but in the Wilds it might be hard to acquire additional
ammunition.  Standard dart ammunition can be manufactured in the
Sojourner\'s machine shop.  The ship also mounts a standard Tl-12 120 Mj
laser turret. The turret is capable of firing a shot every 18 seconds 
(4 combat rounds) if used in ground combat.  It also has a standard 
sandcaster, capable of protecting the ship against hostile Vampire and 
pirate ships. Its sensor\'s are also much improved from those in the
Jayhawk.  In the Wilds, it is essential to know if potential enemies
are laying about.

The ship has a 12 ton vehicle bay and comes with a standard TL-8 Tracked 
ATV.  These ATV\'s are built on Lucifer, and imported to Aubaine. For a small
upgrade fee, the ATV can be upgraded to a wheeled ATV, or even an airraft.
The Sojourner has state of the art TL-12 machine shop, and electronic shop.
These shops have a dual use; they can replace many of the minor parts on the
ship in case of a malfunction. They can also be used to repair relic 
technology on Wilds worlds.  This way the ship can earn additional revenue
between jumps, either by acting as a mobile fix-it shop, or by buying 
broken equipment, repairing it and then selling it to someone else.
The shops come with a extensive library of parts and equipment
that can be built with the available tools. This will also help rebuild
the wilds worlds, so that they will be in better shape when the RC contacts
them.  

The Sojourner provides ample means for a Captain to make a profit, it has
20 staterooms, usually nine of these go to the crew, but individual captains
can decide to double up crew members to provide more space for passengers.
It can also carry 89 tons of cargo, which is almost double that of the 
Jayhawk Far Trader.  This should provide enough space, that the owners
will have no problem paying off their mortgages.  An exact economical plan
can\'t be worked out because most Free Traders will be buying cargo on 
speculation, and the exact profit/loss ratio  can\'t be worked out in advance.
 
The ship has a fairly simple appearance.  It is a smooth box, with a 
rounded nose, a HEPlaR thruster is mounted on either side of the ship
at the rear.  The quad-gauss gun is mounted in a belly turret, under the 
nose of the ship.  The sandcaster turret is also a belly turret located
mid-ships, while the laser turret is located directly above this on the
top of the ship.  Access to the cargo bay and ATV bay is from the rear,
via a roll down ramp.  When on the ground the ship rests on four landing
feet, during flight these fold up into the hull.  

Inside the ship is fairly simple.  The ship is laid out with two levels,
the top deck, contains the cockpit, crew and passenger lounge, staterooms 
and jump drive. Fuel for the jump drives and HEPlaR drives is located in 
several compartments in the bottom deck. The fuel is compartmentalized to
minimize losses in case of battle damage.  Most of the cargo bay is 
located on the bottom deck, but at the rear of the ship it expands into
the top deck, to allow the storage of taller cargos.  The ATV is also
stored on the bottom deck, at the rear of the ship.  

Staterooms are fairly spartan, and lack many of the high tech features
that are common in some ships, such as holographic projection screens,
variable form furniture etc.  It was thought that these items didn\'t improve
the functionality of the ship, and would be rather difficult to maintain
in the Wilds.  Each Sojourner does come with an extensive collection of
technical manuals and informational holovids, in addition to many 
entertainment videos.  The passenger\'s lounge holovid unit, can be dismounted
and used to display videos on remote locations.  It was thought that some
crews might want to show  videos to residents of the Wild. This could be
either as entertainment or as a training seminar.  It should be noted
that the library collection was chosen to put the best face possible on the
Coalition.

My ship is intentionally designed to be upgraded by its owner(s) as time
goes by.  Also, I detailed the damage charts to the N-th degree, as you
can see.  

The basic version ("1/A") is only MCr 58.41 and gives jump-1 and 1 G
performance.  The ultimate version ("3/B") is MCr 85.21 and gives jump-3
and 2 G performance.  Owners who want "longer legs" (a higher jump number)
and improved fuel performance can install the next larger jump drive, and
those wanting faster acceleration can install a larger fusion plant, in
either case, without changing the ship\'s architecture (because of the
reserved space in the engineering section), negating the need for a naval
architect.  

I detailed the damage charts to this extreme so as to quicken the
determination of damage locations.  

I visualize this ship as being very similar (externally) to the classic
jump-1 Beowulf-class free trader.  

Including the collapsible fuel bladders increases the ship\'s versatility.
Also, if the ship wants to carry more passengers, the electronics crew
could "hot bunk", freeing up one more stateroom.

NOTES: 

1) Values listed for Price and Mass do *not* include any Shuttles.  
2) The exact performance (range) and fuel use of the jump drive, as well 
  as the power and fuel use of the maneuver drive, vary according to the 
  displacement tonnage, as shown below.  

    Tonnage    Jump Range & Fuel             Maneuver Power & Fuel 
    100 tons   3 pc.; 280 m^3 (93.333/pc.)   50 MW; 6.25 m^3/G-turn 
    150 tons   3 pc.; 420 m^3 (140/pc.)      75 MW; 9.375 m^3/G-turn 
    200 tons   2 pc.; 420 m^3 (210/pc.)      100 MW; 12.5 m^3/G-turn 
    250 tons   1 parsec; 350 m^3             125 MW; 15.625 m^3/G-turn 
    300 tons   1 parsec; 420 m^3             150 MW; 18.75 m^3/G-turn 

3) Relic high-tech jump drives could be installed to improve range (and 
  fuel economy; at 100 tons displacement) and mass.  (Imagine salvaging 
  TL-15 Jump-4 drives from the classic 100-ton Express Boat.)  

    Tech Level   Mass   Range       Fuel Use 
    TL-13        (-0)   4 parsecs   350 m^3 (87.5 m^3 per parsec) 
    TL-14        -42    5 parsecs   420 m^3 (84 m^3 per parsec) 
    TL-15        -84    5 parsecs   420 m^3 (84 m^3 per parsec) 

4) Turret sockets on the Shuttles are treated as being at locations 6, 
  7, 8, and 9, respectively, when docked; thus, they can all fire into 
  arcs 1, 2, 3, and 4.

Price: MCr 18.084                       Target Size: Very Small (VS) 
Configuration: Box SL                   Tech Level: 12/11 
Mass (Loaded/Empty): 641.586/218.086 tonnes 

ENGINEERING DATA: 

Power Plant: TL-11/12 50 MW Fusion plant (3.046 MW surplus; 
  50 MW/hit), one year duration 
Jump Drive: None 
Maneuver Drive: 1 G/HEPlaR (25 MW); Contra-Grav Lifters (5 MW) 
G-Turns: 16 (3.125 m^3 each) 
Fuel Tankage: 50 m^3, plus 7.5 m^3 reserved for power plant; 
  6x 70 m^3 collapsible fuel bladders capable of holding an 
  additional 420 m^3 in the cargo hold 
Maintenance Points: 29 

ELECTRONICS: 

Controls: Flight deck with 1x workstation 
Avionics: TL-12 Flight Avionics 
Computers: 2x TL-12 Model Standard (0.4 MW each) 
Communications: 1x TL-12 30,000 km Radio (1 hx; 1 MW) 
Sensors: 1x TL-12 30,000 km Active EMS (1 hx; 11 MW) 

ARMAMENTS: 

Hardpoints: 1x Turret Socket (Loc: 10; Arcs: 2, 3, 4) 

ACCOMMODATIONS: 

Airlocks: 1 (0.001 MW) 
Life Support: Extended (0.14 M); G-Compensators (up to 3 Gs; 3.5 MW)

  4x Adequate Seats 
Cargo: 420 m^3 (30 d.t.; see Fuel Tankage above); 2x Large Cargo Hatches 
Small Craft and Launch Facilities: None 

NOTES: 

1) When docked with a _Tycoon_ Modular Trader, the Shuttle provides the 
  25 MW needed by the _Tycoon_ for the maneuver drive\'s increased power 
  usage.  
2) Whenever a laser turret is installed, it is customary to plan for 
  "overpowering" the weapon, as this is easily achieved whenever the 
  Shuttle is docked with a _Tycoon_ Modular Trader.  (The Radio, Active 
  EMS, and CG Lifters on the Shuttle are unneeded and thus powered down, 
  freeing a total of 17 MW with which to "overpower" the laser weapon.)

When we at Apogee Ship Design first started to design a Far Trader to
replace the venerable Jayhawk, we first looked at ways we might
improve the design to make it a better trader.  However we soon
realised that very few major improvements could be made over the basic
design of the Jayhawk, forcing us to step back and rethink the aims
of our design.  This lead us to the conclusion that the main failing
of most Far Traders currently available is their survivability, and
this lead us to design the Iguana.

These are dangerous times, particularly beyond the borders of the
Coalition, so the Iguana has been designed to survive, even at the
cost of its cargo.  The Iguana\'s first line of defense against any
would be attackers is its standard sandcaster turret, and laser
barbette capable of giving almost all similarly sized ships second
thoughts.  If that doesn\'t prove sufficient then the Iguana is still
capable of turning tail and running.  Since the Iguana\'s cargo is held
externally, in two large fifty displacement ton cargo modules
specifically designed to fit the Iguana, these can be dropped to
improve the performance characteristics of the ship, doubling its
acceleration and improving its jump capability to allow a three parsec
jump, or an emergency one parsec jump on less than one hundred litres
of fuel.

Another advantage the Iguana has over its competition is its
flexability.  Since the individual captain can determine the type of
modules he purchases for his ship he can decide whether to make it a
pure cargo hauler, or a passenger liner, or a mix of the two.  The
modules can also be used to make loading and unloading the ship
faster, since they each contain contra-grav lifters, and enough
batteries to maintain the contra-grav, life support and artifical
gravity for over an hour, they can easily be moved about the starport
to positions where they are easier to unload.  It would even be
possible for a group of Free traders to form a cooperative and
purchase several extra modules allowing even more rapid turn around
times.

It should be noted that we recommend that no captain ever use a module
from an unrecognised source.  Whilst we have made every effort to
prevent Virus infection from a compromised module, the designers will
take no responsibility for any captain who accepts a module which has
been infected by Virus.  The anti-virus methods employed to prevent
this kind of infection can basically be split into three sections,
voluntary conection, limited connection, and isolation.  The first
ensures that no connection can be made between the ship and the
modules until a switch has been thrown on both sides.  This will then
connect the module to a disposable "canary" until the ship\'s switch is
thrown again.  The second is a very limited protocol on the limited
connections between the ship.  If any variance is detected on either
the power, or contra-grav control line, these connections will be
broken off. The third guard is that both these connections are
isolated inside the ship, in particular the power connection is to a
small self contained 21MW fusion plant.

The only problem with using the Iguana in the replacement ship scheme
is its relative cost, but this could be offset fairly easily by
retaining part ownership of the ship when exchanging it.  A fifteen to
twenty percent share would probably not be seen as too excessive by most
Free traders bringing in old ships for new, and would bring immediate
material gain to the Coalition.

The Iguana is fairly uninteresting to look at, a blunt nose slopes
back to a slightly rounded box, about nine meters wide and high, and
almost eighteen meters long, disturbed only by the large indented
rectangles the modules sit in.  Under the nose is the entrance to the
small vehicle bay, whilst above it is the cockpit.  Behind the vehicle
bay is the ships internal fuel tanks, and above that the crew quaters,
and the cross corridor which connects to the two hatches the modules
connect to.  Further back the barbette sits mounted on the centre line
of the ship and dorsally mounted. Just behind that is the ventrally
mounted sandcaster, and behind these the engine room.  Finally,
between the jump drive and the engines themselves, below the engine
room is an airlock, exiting the port side of the ship.

The modules themselves vary little in their appearance, being
themselves slightly rounded boxes, a little over seven meters square
and fourteen meters long, and with a hatch centrally on each side, and
one underneath to allow for later designs to carry them piggy back.
The only difference is the modules designed to carry cargo have a
large cargo hatch at one end, and those designed to carry passengers
have an airlock.  Which end this is, is up to the captain when he
connects the module.

Notes:  

It is virtually impossible for the ship to collect modules again after
they have been dropped, however it is possible for a ship with
grapples, or a large enough hanger to recover them.

A larger version is currently being designed with a main body of two
hundred tons, and able to connect to four of the modules, to exchange
for the ex-subsidised merchants and liners still in use.  However this
project had been put on hold whilst finishing the Iguana.  Further
details will be forthcoming.

A second version that\'s still at the concept stage is of a \'Lancer
varient of the main body with upgraded weapons, sensors, and
maneuverability, that could be sold to \'Lancers and used for covert
missions.  These ships would look essentially identical to the Iguana
(or the larger version if it\'s decided the Iguana isn\'t large enough),
and could even use the same modules, and thus appear as a normal
trader.  With this in mind all the modules have internal bracing to
allow up to 3G maneuvering.

I don\'t disagree that a grid system of some tiype can be used. It has
been for years when rapid location is needed, (ie. in milatary mapping,
etc). Go look in your neighborhood fire house. However these all use a
system of Alphnumerics listed along two sides (top or bottom AND one
side) of the map for cross-reference. (as I mentioned). My main point
was rather than use terrain fitted conveniently into hexes or squares,
create realistic looking maps, simulair to the PHOTOS your SatScans
would diplay. Why have little "^"s for mountains that end at the edge of
a hex or square. Make the maps look realistic then overlay them with
what every grid system you or your players feel comfortable with.

I figure most groundside bases will have TWO sets of clocks (Left is local,
right is imperial {Cleon/Sylea/Capitol time}, both with dates upon them.
Most worlds will use a local calendar and clock where convinient (IE,
within the 16-30 hour limits). On worlds where daylight is never seen (Too
far out, all pop underground, etc), and on orbital stations and colonies,
and aboard shipping, the Sylea Standard Time references will be used. Most
startowns will have SST displays for convinience, and most towns with any
off-world or imperial connections will also have at least a cetral clock
(Usually local above SST).

as most comm techs will tell you, operating on two different time schedules
is not too hard (Z aka UCT aka GMT vs Local). As a mission communicator for
the Civil Air Patrol, I had to tell p[iltos local times, and jot down Z
times for all instructions. As well as run all the logs on Z times. ANd we
were Z+8 or Z+9 dependant upon Daylight Savings Time.

ObTraveller: As we know, nationalism, regionalism, excessive 
patriotism, racism and the like continues even in the age of Traveller, 
but how big a part does it take in your games?

In my current campaign (Milieu 0), I\'m trying to (hopefully subtly ;-) 
encourage the players to feel superior to the \'natives\' they encounter, 
*they* are after all Citizens of the Imperium, while the natives are 
mere, well, *natives*. I am, of course, doing this to set them up for a 
fall later. ;-)

On a related topic, what ethnical/racial stereotypes exist in the 
Imperium? (Both Milieu 0 and later.) Some are obvious, like the 
Pedantically Bureaucratic Vilani, and the Recklessly Hasty Solomani, 
but how about others? (And are my two samples really the likely 
stereotypes for said groups?)

Forgive me in believing in democracy.  We recently had a very close
election here in San Francisco, a multi-million dollar stadium referendum
passed by fewer than 2000 votes in a city of 750,000.  The stsdium
opponents claimed that they had the support of people who didn\'t vote.
Should we have overturned the election on their word?

Also recently, Marc asked us if we supported a revision to the task system.
 This lead to the largest outpouring of messages I\'ve ever seen on the TML.
 So TMLers are not afraid of stating their opinions, even if it\'s just "I
agree with opinion X."

I will also remind you that *you* were the one who kept referring to the
silent supporters you had, telling us of the adoring horde hanging on your
words.  I just called you on it.  Well, where did they go?

Remind me of their names and the digest these messages appeared in.  I\'d
like to look these enthusiastic messages, since I can\'t recall them.  I
suppose I could go through the archieves...

I\'ve run a campaign that had Earth at TL17.  I didn\'t call it the Third
Imperium though, it was the Restored Catholic Empire.

Oh, we agree on many things.  The task system needed revision, the stellar
codes should be brought more in line with scientific knowledge, and that
your theory was flawed.  I\'ve been shown to be wrong before, and accepted
my errors.  Why can\'t you?

No you came out and said you had proof that the Rule of Man had achieved
Tech Levels ranging from TL16-19 to Ancient levels.  If you insist, I have
that post saved and can quote you directly.  The bit that Anders has in
quotation above is a direct quote from one of your early posts.  Could you
at least admit that you said what you said?

And the end result was that everyone except you agreed that the evidence,
as presented by you, gave more credence to the late TL12 theory.  Excuse

Nice dodge.  Since Milieu:0 is set at the dawn of the new age, what
happened to the previous empire is very important.  It will affect what
could have and did happen near the beginning of Twilight.

Actually, it was Vicennes that was TL16.  It was (as is in my current
campaign) far enough away from the Spinward Marches to make TL16 gear very
rare.  Even when you can get it, TL16 isn\'t much of an improvement of TL15.

Hate to tell you, but I am not smiling, and I\'m the guy who devouts half

I have made many friends here, and can say that our shared participation on

well, when we played Traveller as kids!  I did not make these friends by
being imperious and rude.

How noble.  What politics?  The TML is divided into two groups.. us
loudmouths who post a great deal, and those who lurk.  We follow a few
simple rules, similar to those you find in any social setting, and have a
great time.  I\'m not aware of my making Traveller a nightmare for anyone
(my players might disagree after they find that hulk this weekend...)

The nice thing about the TML is the wide variety of people who read it, not
just from a educational/Traveller experience, but a cultural standpoint.
Since we are from all walks of life, and all parts of the globe, I can gain
insight into things by reading what Anders or Carlos or Michael Barry has
to say..

That\'s how we work, this have never been about dictating to one another.

Or he could be a Solomani with a few obscure Vilani forefathers  --  that
just happened to contribute their longevity to him. After all, what race
is a man who has 11 Solomani and 4 Vilani great-great-grandparents? (Hey,
one of them contributed twice ;-).

I\'m not protesting this, but there is at least one precedent for something
similar that I know of. In Denmark the 4th friday after Easter is a holiday
called \'Store Bededag\' -- Great Prayer Day. It dates back several centuries
to a Danish statesman who noticed that there were all these half holidays 
where people were supposed to offer prayers to various saints. He removed
all these \'small\' prayer days and rolled them into one (full) holiday.
And the clergy accepted this.

Besides, an official empire-wide holiday dedicated to all religions wouldn\'t
prevent the various religions from celebrating their own special holidays,
merely provide those who were flexible enough to use it with an extra
convenience.

	Nor will it work very well with "local" calendars based on the mainworld\'s
actual orbital period. I\'d strongly wager that most worlds have the "real"
calendar they use for day-to-day stuff, and only think about the Imperial
calendar where they interface with the Imperium.

I always had a problem with that.  If the belt was made up

their military ships (at least).

Well, except that it makes sense for a non-religous Imperium for the
same reasons it is celebrated in a US that has seperation of church
and state.

Thanksgiving is besically the secularization of similar religous
festivals.  Presumably the date it occurs at is an Solomani
influence.

Quoting "Solomani & Aslan", Page 23 (The Solomani Calender):

"The Third Imperium established it\'s calender according to the rotation
and revolution of Capital.  Fortunately for us Solomani, Capital has a
24 hour rotation, and a 364.97 day revolution.  The Solomani calender
and that of the Third Imperium are vitrually identical."

News Item, Imperial Yacht Club Newsletter, IY 16-322:

Famille Spofulam Yards Launches New Yacht

	Recently, I was given the opportunity of touring the first
production model of Famille Spofulam\'s latest yacht offering.  Greeted by
Hengabar Spofulam at Famille Spofulam\'s orbital HQ, I was treated to the
usual Spofulam wet bar and buffet before being ushered onto the antiseptic
floor of Production Line #3 to tour the prototype, which is to be used as a
corporate yacht by FSY.

	This reporter\'s first reaction upon viewing FSY\'s latest, sitting
incongrously next to the hulking black form of a Bludgeon-class patrol
cruiser, was: "It\'s a baby Caligula!".  Indeed, the Imelda-class yacht
(named after an ancient Terran queen renowned for her love of luxury and
lavish tastes) is outwardly very similar to FSY\'s well-known 1000-ton
megayacht; it has an airframe saucer hull with prominent vertical
stabilizers evoking early space-age Terran ground craft styling, in default
hull colour settings of hot pink and chrome.  Although the Imelda is
somewhat sleeker than the Caligula, the family resemblance is pronounced.

	The Imelda\'s performance and specifications are pure Spofulam; 4G
T-plate maneuver drives, a 3-parsec jump drive, a hull stressed to 10G\'s
for atmospheric operations and heavy armour are what we\'ve come to expect
from Hengabar\'s boys and girls.  The only exception is the rather prosaic
95 Mj laser/sandcaster armament suite.  Scoops, a purification plant and a
hangar for a 20-ton launch reflect the Spofulam concern for spaceworthiness
and functionality; the Imelda is capable of more than just the Highport to
Highport run.  In general, this is a fast, long-ranged and capable craft.

	While the exterior and performance specs are fairly standard for a
Spofulam vessel. the interior decor reflects a new departure from FSY\'s
trademark blond wood and indirect lighting motif.  Rather than striving for
simplicity, maximum ergonomic efficiency, and richness of material, FSY\'s
interior designers have gone for all-out opulence in the newly popular
Restoration style; an ornate fusion of First and Second Imperium motifs
expressed in Sylean materials.  The result, the product of months of work
by noted designer Chonpohl Ghohltyeh, is stunning: the panelling is of
burled green Lartsa-wood, with obsidian tile floors inlaid with green and
white nephrite.  Fixtures are crafted of Iridium-plated gold engraved with
both Imperial Sunbursts and Ziru Sirkaa and Rule of Man heraldry, and the
furnishings are upholstered in the finest butter-soft Noggah skin, dyed to
match the panelling.  Ghohltyeh\'s services are available for those wishing
to create their own decors, albeit for an additional fee.

	Mr. Spofulam led me in through the hangar, as the passenger
airlocks were not yet fully completed.  The hangar is situated right aft,
between the two vertical stabilizers.  At the moment empty, the hangar is
designed to accomodate an Imperial-standard 20td launch, with space enough
to permit maximum ease of on-board service.  After a perfunctory
explanation of the hangar facilities, I was led forward, detouring through
the somewhat smaller (20td) cargo hold, into the working areas of the ship,
on the lower deck.

	The lower deck is laid out in a rather simple manner; right aft is
the hangar, which connects to the cargo hold as well as to the central
engineering area.  A rather nice touch in the hangar area is the large and
luxuriously appointed passenger grav shaft leading directly up to the main
corridor on the passenger deck; this permits passengers to disembark in
style and proceed to the passenger areas without having to tour through the
working areas of the ship.

	Forward of the cargo bay lies the engineering spaces; the J-3
Famille Spofulams Subsystems Jump Drive hulks immaculately in the center in
a large compartment, where the two engineering workstations are situated.
Access hatches to the spaces containing the twin 10,000 ton-rated Spofulam
Gravitics maneuver drives (mounted aft, outboard of the vertical
stabilizers) are situated at the rear of the jump drive compartment.
Likewise, access hatches for the 600Mw Zhunastu Fusion Systems power plant
(to portside of the jump drive compartment), and purification plant (to
starboard of the jump drive compartment) radiate from the jump drive
compartment.

	Forward of the jump drive compartment is an access hatch leading to
a compartment holding a grav shaft to the passenger areas, and connecting
to the sickbay and 5-workstation bridge.  From here on, Ghohltyeh\'s hand
became evident; the decor changed from workmanlike Spofulam
engineering-area industrial chic to Restoration-style splendour; the
sickbay is as much of a work of the desinger\'s creative mind as it is one
of medical engineering.  Like the sickbay, the bridge has Lartsa-wood
panelling on all non-instrument surfaces, and is laid out around a massive
owner\'s chair, with power swivel, an endless range of adjustments, a
refreshment center in one arm and a comm/computer panel in the other, and
upholstered in what must have been the hides of the softest baby Noggahs.

	Returning to the grav shaft in the hangar, Mr Spofulam led me up to
the passenger deck.  The grav shaft opens up onto a luxuriously-appointed
corridor leading forwards.  Discreet panels at the aftermost end of the
main corridor lead to the crew quarters and galley and stewarding areas.
The accomodations are luxurious, even for the crew; all crew save gunners
and the two junior stewards have large staterooms to themselves.  While not
up to the standard of accomodation of the passenger areas, not even the
most work-to-rule member of the Spacers Guild could find anything to
complain of here: the staterooms are all done in traditional Spofulam blond
wood and indirect lighting.  After a brief tour of the crew areas, which
connect to engineering via twin grav shafts to port and starboard, I was
led back into the main corridor and into the passenger areas.

	  The double-width doors at the end of the corridor open inwards,
to the tune of Famille Spofulam\'s corporate anthem, to reveal an immense
(300M^3) oval lounge divided into dining, recreational, and lounging areas
by artfully placed and shaped planters filled with a variety of Terran,
Sylean, and Vilani vegetation.  The Imelda\'s passenger areas are centered
around this space: eight staterooms are provided for the comfort of the
owner\'s guests, five of which are standard 4td large staterooms, and three
of which FSY has termed "MegaStaterooms"; vast and opulent 150M^3 spaces
containing every possible amenity.

	Even these are beggared by the master\'s stateroom, which at 216
M^3, or 15 displacement tons, is quite simply immense, with huge panoramic
viewports set in the ceiling.  The furnishings are of course quite
spectacular; a large canopied bed, sunken coversation pit, immense wet bar
carved from a simple lump of black jade, and amazingly, a fireplace crowned
with an actual working ancient Terran "Lava Lamp", one of only four known
to be in existence.  However, these are all minor details compared to the
Imelda\'s most noteworthy feature; 66M^3 of the master\'s stateroom are taken
up by what has to be the single most gigantic \'fresher ever installed on a
private vessel, situated dead forwards. Resembling more a tropical
greenhouse than it does a sanitation facility, it holds a hot tub, a sauna,
and several large planters filled with a variety of Sylean, Terran, and
Vilani tropical plants.  Terran bats and parrots and other exotic flying
life forms fly from plant to plant, their cries echoing pleasantly from the
walls.  Most remarkable, however, is the massive alabaster-and-Iridium
toilet, situated at the very front of the vessel, facing huge panoramic
windows dead forwards.

	FSY expects to begin semi-custom production of the Imelda-class
early next year, at the rate of "one or two" a year.

The above quote has some weird koan/paradoxity.
I do agree that most americans have a sense of humor but some seem to

Vargr: All Vargr are criminals and pirates (they actually manage to govern
an entire and in some cases several solar systems with tech levels much
higher than Terra today). Most Vargr are working in normal day to day jobs,
taking care of children, researching etc.

The Zhodani: All Zhos are plotting the downfall of the Imperium through
backstabbing, psionic evilness and other cowardly means. Most proles work,
have kids, watch holo etc and the major difference for them compared to
Imperials is that they probably have no locks on their doors and can go out
at night without fear of getting robbed.

Belters: All belters, booze, take drugs, work alone in junkyard spaceship
when they aren\'t claimjumping or pirating. The stereotype is based on the
american (and others) goldrush but take a look at mining companies today:
They may not be environmentally friendly but they shure run a tight ship
and behave like big business. There was a writeup of Glisten on the list
that propagated this myth by portraying more or less the entire pop (9) to
be a bunch of rowdy drunks. BTW all my belter PC have been drug using
drunkards with criminal bent and pracy as a hobby but that\'s beside the
point.

Yes, where is the catholic church in M0 and 3I? Lots of interesting
adventures could be spun around pope assasination plots, theft of relics,
pope banning research into jumpgate for weird reasons, the church
laundering credit for the Interstellar Coke Cartels etc.

On could spin an adventure around Vargr scholars researching some relics
that the church knows are forgeries and cloak and dagger stuff from that.
To have cool and balanced scientific Vargr in opposition to weird,
crackpot, fanatic Solomani could be an intersting twist.

way, for example - not all of them raped, pillaged, and plundered.

  As for Lynn White\'s "Medievil Technology and Social Change," I\'m afraid
I must report many of its conclusions have been rejected by scholars in
the field.  Oddly, this does not include most historians of technology -
few of them work in period before 1800, and so White\'s work has maintained
its status.  A new book by Dr. Alan Marcus of Iowa State University coming
out this year will lay out the failings in White\'s work (as part of a
larger survey of the history of technology before the Industrial
Revolution), so perhaps they\'ll stop reprinting White at last.

Guess.

Let\'s put it this way, it was given an extensive going-over by a 
number of knowledgeable people (and some others like me) which was 
roughly half completed when it went to IG for typesetting and 
printing.  How much correction took place after the submission I 
don\'t know, but as sent to IG it wasn\'t anywhere near ready.  This 
wasn\'t Dave & Guy\'s fault...

IMHO, of course.

Second: As a measure of chrome, AM 6 gives the Imperial date 292-940

        (allowing for that 400 years in the Solomani Calendar are 97
        days longer than 400 Imperial years) I get 001-0 (the founding
        of the 3rd Imperium) as Thursday, 11th January 4569 AD. From
        this one can work out a precise date (including day of week)
        for any date in the Imperial calendar. The points to remember
        is that the day of the week will advance by one day per year,
        except in leap years (remember a century is only a leap year if
        divisable by 400 not 4) when it will advance by two days.
        Therefore, every 400 years the day of the week of a date will
        regress by one. i.e. if a particular date falls on a Thursday,
        400 years later it will fall on a Wednesday. Incidentally
        Strephon was assassinated on Friday, 19th Febuary 5685 AD.
        Pity GDW didn\'t make Strephon\'s assassination 307-1116, that
        will be Friday, 13th August 5685AD.

If anybodies interested, I\'ll try to write a program converting Imperial
dates into Solomani dates.

    'body' => 'While fixing a bug in my chargen program, I\'ve found that it is really
damn hard to keep a character from living forever if you are determined
to do so. Much thanks to Roderick Elliott for noticing this while creating
a character that bore an amazing resemblance to Yaskodray\'s mythical
Lost Grandchild :)  in an effort to see if you could really die from aging.

In large part, it is closely related to the recent Skills vs Stats War in that
it points out a large problem in making Stat increases, particularly End,
so damn easy to get. If a player starts with a high End, and spends several
terms getting +1\'s to bring it up to 15 or so, aging cannot keep up with 
the character quick enough to keep lowering the stats, especially if a
couple of rolls are spent boosting Str and Dex as well. And if one of the
stats (other than End) is actually lowered to 0, it is just about impossible
to fail a Difficult roll against a very high End.

Now I realize that a ref is highly unlikely to allow such a character to 
exist without VERY good justification, and only munchkinish players or
those with a particular desire to play a very peculiar character would
go through the process to this length, but it remains a hole in the rules.
Is there an absolute maximum age that a character (not on anagathics)
can reach, regardless of high stats? I\'ve arbitrarily chosen one (sufficiently
high that I don\'t *think* it will effect anyone\'s character generation), 
but I\'d like a consensus before I put it to rest, or an actual age if it is 
somewhere in the Canon and I can\'t find it. I also have noticed that
the T4.1 file doesn\'t have any aging rules in it (other than a reference
that aging starts after term 6[!]), so I don\'t know what changes might
be planned for that.

Speaking of holes, what are the conditions for players having second
careers that y\'all use? The Boss has stated that in T4.1, only Vargr
will be allowed more than 1 career. While I think that is a bit extreme,
I feel that the current system makes it *far* too easy to have 3 or 4
careers under one\'s belt as well. A few questions:

	1) Under the current system, a character who *voluntarily* 
leaves a service with a commission may later re-enlist (with the correct
rolls) in the same service. I am assuming that characters that either
are injured or fail to reupped can not later come back into the same
service. Is this an appropriate assumption?

	2) A character cannot voluntarily serve more than 7 terms in the
same service. Does this count non-sequential terms, or just sequentially?
E.g., Kevin Bacon (a good Vlandish name) serves 4 terms in the Scouts,
leaves for 2 terms in the Entertainers, then comes back for another 3
terms in the Scouts. At this point, must he mandatorily retire, having 
served a total of 7 terms? Or is he considered to have served only 3?
How many terms is he allowed for pension and mustering out, 3, 7, or
some other number?

	3) How do y\'all handle "automatic eligibility"? As it stands now,
a character with the right rolls placed in Stats, or just lucky enough not
to lose too many points might serve 4 or 5 terms in a career, and then 
still be automatically eligible forex the Army after leaving the first career.
Is it likely that a character 34 or 38 years old would still be so attractive
to another service? Should automatic eligibility be revoked in a career
(other than Nobles) if not chosen as a first career?

*Wheww* that\'s all I can think of for now. More annoying questions to
come as matters proceed :)

P.S. Interesting sidenote: My spell checker kicks out "Roebuck" and
"Ordering" as alternatives for "Roderick". How long have you been 
getting kickbacks from Sears, and how much are they paying you? :)

Once you\'ve tanked up, feel free to move on. Your purification plant
will process the fuel later. Note that you should wait until you
have enough refined fuel for the power plant, which powers the maneuver
drive.

They\'re called baffles. I also made this assumption because at least
one of the combat systems for Traveller has damages like \'Fuel-1\'.
This means 10% of fuel is lost, which implies that baffles exists
(or else the rest of the fuel would escape through the same hole).

Alex,

Well from what I have heard it did not get very much broad playtesting less
than one week. It was rushed into completion not by choice of the
designers. Sound familar, the last one was Starships. I will be interested
in looking before I buy on this product you should be too.

Here is a very simple solution to Holidays:

You try to have at least one every thirty days or so. The Imperium gets to
name 3, the domain gets to name 3 and the rest are planetary.

How could the imperium agree on any given holiday when the countries of one
lousy planet cannot?
We share the continent with both the Mexicans and Americans, but the
Mexicans have no Thanksgiving, and even Canada and the USA celebrate on
diffferent days. Then there is Independence Day, Canada Day and Cinqo de
Mayo. We do not celebrate those in the other countries (except in areas near
the borders). The closest things to universal holidays on Earth are May Day
(most of planet outside North America), Christmas, or something very
similiar (most of planet except East Asia) and New Years Day (just on
diffferent days all over the planet)

I don\'t even have Galanglic as that common. There are loads of English
(modern Galanglic equivalent) speakers all over this planet but that doesn\'t
mean you are always going to find one. Or they may speak english, but
pretend not to, just to annoy you. 

As far as racism in the Third Imperium, officially, there is none.

It should be quite good. It was written by some very qualified people who
have put a fair amount of playtesting (playtesting for T4?! What a novel
concept!) into the design rules.

They didn\'t get to eliminate the ridiculous "Fusion Plus" but they did get
to clarify some major design issues. I think we\'ll all be pleased.

Strange, many of the Starter Editions I have seen were IMHO much better
games than the \'advanced\' edition. The starter editions were more enjoyable
because they was designed to make an enjoyable game rather than explaining
all the detailed rules for character generation and combat and then
requiring the players to come up with adventures themselves.

Perhaps the problem is your perception that a starter edition was not the
"real thing". What exactly is your distinction between a "Starter Edition"
and the "real thing"? Is the T4 rule book alone a "Starter Edition"? How
about the main rules plus all the supplements? Or do you need all the
adventures and JTAS articles to have the "real thing"? How much money do
you have to spend before you no longer feel insulted?

The distinction in my mind is that a "Starter Edition" is a complete game
with no extra work or purchase required before you can start playing. It
should have all characters, maps, counters, encounters, and so on
pre-generated so one can start playing immediately. Ideally the adventures
and rules should be introduced in stages so you don\'t have to learn
everything before you can start the first scenario. The starter editions of
RPGs I have played were not some kind of watered-down rule set, but
complete games enjoyable in themselves.

The MTJ article on BattleDress showed the Marine assult armor with a skirt

I\'ve been doing some work on what the traditional churches have been doing
since the RoM.  This comes form one of my players, whose PC is a rabbi!
For simplicities sake I\'ve written in a great reconcilliation among the
Christian churches, leaving a slightly more liberal Catholic Church.  (I do
not want to deal with fundamentalists in Traveller.)

Doing this has also caused me to write on the Church of the Stellar
Divinity.. does anyone have any information about this group beyond what
appears in DA6?

First, that\'s EASY to explain...you want your fleet\'s fuel supply line
based entirely on a belt containing an unknown amount of antimatter way
off in the Spinward Reaches? And you\'re off in, sayyyy Alpha Crucis?

A second point; maybe the physicists can answer. Exactly how do you find
out that that chunk of stuff in front of your ship is antimatter? "Ping"
it with matter and look for the flash? Will the NMR of antimatter be
different than that of matter?

I will agree, yet disagree.

I would say that Americans are a diverse enough group, just like any other
nationality, that "most" Americans will poorly fit any sweeping statements.

That said, I think it is safe to say that among those who are verbal about
their nationality, disparaging statements about their country or
countrypersons made in jest are not always received in the spirit they are
given.

Obtrav;  Are Vargr nationalistic about the Vargr extent in general?  or
only about their specific slice thereof?  Perhaps they have a better sense
of humor than I expect, but I bet they take any non-vargr opinion of any
Vargr group in a non-humorous fashion (same caveat about
over-generalization I made above applies).

Yes, but the majority of responses were *against* your theories. In fact,
the data that you provided gave more proof *against* a general TL of 13 or
higher for the RoM. You seem unwilling to face the fact that your theory is
unpopular and poorly supported. Any argument that uses your data as proof
of a RoM of TL 16+ is pure sophistry. You\'ve used this "silent majority"
tack before, and quite frankly, it\'s getting old.

You are deluded. I don\'t mean this as an insult, but merely a statement
based on the fact that you\'re making claims which have not been validated.
I know you think you\'re cozied up to Marc on all this, but I have not seen
a single post from him that says, "By God, yes! Leroy\'s right! The RoM
*was* TL-16+ in several areas and we\'re going to completely throw canon to
the wolves and reshape the Traveller background according to Leroy\'s
vision!"

Until I see that, your stuff ain\'t canon. And if I *do* see it, I will
finally stop my crusade to adhere to canon as much as possible on the
grounds that IMHO, the game would be heading in a horribly wrong direction.
And I won\'t be alone.

That\'s just it: the whole premise of T4 is the development of several
milieus that enable Traveller players to conduct campaigns in several
settings in various historical periods. If you quarantine certain
historical periods, you degrade the premise of the game.

That should be easy, since your ideas are just a variant and have no basis
in canon.

If you consider this message a flame, then so be it. You\'re not the real
audience for my comments anyway. I address you since you are the author of
the post, but my real concern is that by some bizarre stretch of the
imagination, your theories might be remotely considered to become canonical
information. That would be a travesty and I won\'t stand by to watch that
happen without having said my piece.

Some reasons for not concentrating on a single, industrial planet:

(1) Prestige.  Empires tend to be judged on a "never mind the quality,
    feel the width" basis - "Their empire is HUGE!"

(2) Undesirables.  You want somewhere to put people you don\'t want "at
    home".

(3) The pioneering spirit.  Perhaps the masses don\'t actually like being
    huddled, and would rather go somewhere with fewer facilities but
    more opportunity.

(4) Dangerous experiments.  Who wants to try out nuclear bombs in their
    own (hemi)sphere?

(5) Military bases.  Staging posts, observation posts - this is actually
    catered for slightly in the PE rules.

(6) Defense.  You don\'t want your whole empire taken out by one
    relativistic rock, do you?

Not *entirely* serious,

A friend of mine is very close to dropping IG altogether, because of the
persistent calls by Melody.

She apparently left something like three calls on the office voice mail
about this, and he gets called once couple of weeks about other products he
has not yet purchased.  He would have avoided giving them a phone number at
all, except that it is required for credit card orders.

It could be because he did a web order, but if that is so, why not send an
email?  It is less intrusive and cheaper.

He thought of asking if there was a special sucker field in the database,
and whether it could be cleared for his entry.

I am not nearly as annoyed, as the only call I have gotten from them in the
last few months was checking up on an error of theirs.  This, I consider a
good call.

[other idea snipped]

I think it would be good for "shock" value in my own campaign.  Yes, I
can\'t wait to see the expressionon on the face of one (ex-catholic) player
when the "Agents" who are following them around are revealed to
be...Priests of the Order of Saint Carlotta, the secret intelligence branch
of the Catholic Church, attempting to acquire that relic or piece of
technology or...well, whatever.

I envision the Archbishop of Regina (I\'m playing in 1100) as a
machiavellian prince of the church with a hand in everything that goes on,
influencing social events and politics on many worlds.

Having watched Tim Curry play Cardinal Richelieu (sp?) in (latest remake
of) The Three Musketeers last night (Boy did they alter that story...people
lived whom I though were supposed to die!), I am inspired to have a
powerful arch-villian in the ecclesiastical red.  (But an archbishop would
be purple, right?  Maybe the Cardinal of Aramis could be the villian then).

Definite shock value and future possibilities.

   No one is trying to rob anyone of fun, or insist that you drop your
version of "reality" because it isn\'t canon.  When however you insist
that your version of "reality" is the *canon* one, you can expect a
portion of slings, arrows, and even laurels depending upon how well you
justify your position, and how controversial it is.

   This reminds me of the guy back in my college days who, as a group
psychology experiment, dressed up in Nazi garb (no Leroy I\'m not calling
you a Nazi) and walked around the Quad in the middle of campus on a
Wednesday afternoon during Spring Term (the busiest time of year on the
busiest day), pausing briefly to spray paint a Nazi symbol on the
sidewalk.  He was lucky that all he got was shoved around a bit and
escorted off by Campus Security.  Several of us (Army and Air Force ROTC
cadets, who rarely cooperated on anything) were just about to pick the
little weasel up and toss him into a nearby trashcan.

   If all this was to you Leroy was an "exercise", I would recommend
that you find some other place to work out.  If on the other hand you
were only interested in the gathering of evidence, then you should have
said that from the very beginning.  As it is, no one around here had any
doubt as to you true feelings on the subject, as you clearly stated them
in previous posts.  

   History for purposes of canon is ***not*** relative.  If \'A\' is \'A\',
it is stated as such, if for story purposes it might be \'B\' or \'C\'
that\'s fine, so long as no definative statements are made.  I feel you
are slipping into the same trap that Frank and Dave did back in TNE,
where not even the referee could be trusted with "The Truth".  That
isn\'t cricket.

   On the other hand, perhaps you are attempting your own brand of spin
control here....

   As if T4 can be trusted as a canon source.  Wait until the errata
clears.  There have been some major malfunctions made in T4 up to this
point, why should this be any different?

   Note how Leroy is now falling back on the patented, "well that\'s not
what it says now" defense, even though it was agreed by everyone
participating in these discussions that what T4 had to say is
irrelevant.

   Nice insult Leroy, you nearly slipped it in past my radar.  If there
is a spin doctor, PhD in our midst, *you* are clearly it, not me.  If
there is someone here whose past performances have demonstrated that
they belong in the same sentence will Bill Clinton (aka Herr
Slickmeister), *you* Leroy are the one.

   Figuring out what someone meant is a basic part of reading.  Proper
literary analysis demands it.  Do I care what Marc Miller has for
breakfast every morning or how he feels about his mother?  Hell no. 
That\'s not relevant to the discussion.  Knowing that Frank Chadwick and
Dave Nilsen were heavily influenced by H. Beam Piper when they created
the Reformation Coalition setting for TNE *is* relevant however.  So is
a knowledge of the overall intent of the author or authors who create a
work.

   There can be no question that previous GDW authors did not intend for
the Second Imperium to have a technological level equal or superior to
that of the Third Imperium.  End of topic.  The only question at this
point is, where **below** the Third Imperium does the RoM fall.

  I would also rate his Ogle/Leer skill at at least 3, given the amount

An old professor of mine by the name of Bert Hall at the University of
Toronto just recently published an article entitled _Lynn White\'s Medieval
Technology and Social Change After Thirty Years_  reflecting on the impact
of his article and the more recent scholarship responding to it. He was a
student of White\'s in California. I think the article is in one of last
year\'s issues of _Technology and Culture_ (where else). The consensus is
that his work hasn\'t held up, although whose would after thirty years.

I actually think that White\'s article _The Historical Roots of Our
Ecological Crisis_, written in _Science_ thirty years ago, still remains
quite poignant. Depressing, but poingnant.

Any idea what this Marcus guy has to say about the whole affair?

I think you mis-read the misprint.  Alien Module 6, poge 11 says that the 
Sphere was dissolved in 940 but then gives the date as 292-950.  The History 
box on p12 gives 940 as the year as well.  The MT Encyclopedia (p7 and p37) 
implies that there may have been a 10 year spread between "friction" (940) and 
re-integration (950) which may expalin having two dates.  Unfortunately the 
Ecyclopedia gives 950 = 5468 AD while Alien module 6 gives 950 = 5471 AD.

MT Referee\'s Companion p45 states that Imperial 1120 = Terran 5641, which would 
favour 950 = 5471 AD being the "calibration" date. 

Using Excel 97 (which claims to work up to Friday, 31st December 9999) I have 
written a tiny spreadsheet that gives the dates as:


292-940  Monday 13th March 5471
001-0    Tuesday 9th January 4531
132-1116 Wednesday 22nd August 5646
206-588  Thursday 13th March 5119
229-679  Saturday 13th March 5210

If we use 292-950 as the "calibration" date, and work out when the other 13/Mar 
days are we get:

292-950  Monday 13th March 5471
001-0    Saturday 11th January 4521
132-1116 Sunday 24th August 5636
204-588  Thursday 13th March 5109
227-679  Monday 13th March 5200
which implies:
263-1120 Tuesday 1st January 5641 (MT Ref Companion p 45)

Then again, we have the MT Encyclopedia p7 which matches
292-950  Friday 13th March 5468 (or possibly 940 = 5458 is the key year)
cunninly incompatable with:
263-1120 Tuesday 1st January 5641 (MT Ref Companion p 45)
cunninly incompatible with:
MT Encyclopedia p37 which again gives 940 as the year the autonomous region 
(Solomani Sphere) was revoked,

Here at SolSupreme we offer to all our members a HandComp program to calculate 
and store all of your important Terran dates.  No longer will you need to worry 
about forgetting important anniversaries on the correct (Terran) dates.  A 
little-used feature allows you to be notified of anniversaries using the 
Imperial calendar.

Your for only Cr9, or free with life membership.

For those who use our genealogy records to trace your family tree back to 
pre-jump Earth, the program is compatable with all dates from 1900 (Terran) 
onwards.  The next update, for Excel 4532, will allow for dates back to 1 
(Terran) to be compatable with the Caledonian "Mac" genealogy data and the 
Templar database.

I had not realised there was this 10-year discrepancy in the Solomani dates ... 
I was planning to include Imperial/Vilani/Zhodani/Aslan dates in my 
up-coming Win 95 program (based on the Alien Modules which mostly gave 
"calibration" dates to allow such conversion).  I\'m sure the TML will find the 
true conversion dates in due course!  Here is my stab at it:

Aslan   201-3644 = Imperial 000-0    (MT Ref Companion p42) ??? misprint for
Aslan   201-3644 = Imperial 001-1111  ???
Aslan   ddd-3644 = Imperial ddd-1111 (Alien Module 6 p2)
Aslan   ddd-3642 = Imperial ddd-1110 (MT Encycolpedia p7)
This data is all consistent (approximately) if we assume the misprint (000-0 is 
not a valid date, I believe).


Droyne  1401/ccc = Imperial ddd-1111 (Alien Module 7 p 2)


Solomani (see main part of message) - three years to choose from


Vilani  3882.ddd = Imperial ddd-1120 (MT ref Companion p 45)
Vilani  3931.ddd = Imperial ddd-1110 (MT Encycolpedia p7)
Completely inconsistent!


Zhodani 3471.1 Dranzhrin = Imperial 289-1112 (Alien Module 4 p3)
Zhodani 3474.3 season/dd = Imperial ddd-1120 (MT ref Companion p 45)
Zhodani 3470.2 season/dd = Imperial ddd-1110 (MT Encycolpedia p7)
This data is all consistent (approximately)

Perhaps Don McKinney <dmckinne@csci.csc.com> can come to the rescue with his

Yep, works for me (only call it *Imperial* Standard Time).

Hi, a few weeks ago, I posted a write up for Coaise/Thoezennt/Old
Expanses in Y:1200.  It was a planet ruled by two competing Virus, who
pitted their people against each other in a series of wars, for the
sake of the amusment/intellectual excercise of the Virses.

I forgot to send along teh robot enforcers that the Viruses use.  None
of the people know that the Keepers are robots, they think that they
are chosen from the people to serve the Westlord/Eastlord.

The robots were built using the system in Vampire Fleets.

Sadly, Marc doesn\'t seem to like those. Let me run my ideas up the 
flagpole and see who salutes them...

001  Holiday. 
     On which we celebrate the founding of our glorious Third Imperium.
009  School Year starts. 
     This only officially applies to Imperial schools (eg the Imperial 
     Naval Academy), but many other schools (especially on Sylea) also    
     follow the Immperial School Year.
034  Imperial Forces Day.
     On which we give thanks to all the brave members of the Imperial
     Forces (Army, Navy, Marines, and Scouts), and remember those who died 
     in the service of the Emperor.
051  Emperor Cleon\'s Birthday.
     On which we celebrate the birth of our Emperor, and, in return, he
     bestows honours upon the greatest of his subjects.
090  Quarter Day.
     A simple public holiday marking the end of the first quarter.
121  Workers\' Day.
     On which we remember the workers - the tiny cogs who keep the great
     Imperial machine running smoothly.
181  Mid-Year Break.
     A simple public holiday marking the end of the second quarter.
184  Standard Religious Holiday.
219  Family Day.
272  Three-Quarter Day.
     A simple public holiday marking the end of the third quarter.
328  School Year Ends (Graduation).   
     This only officially applies to Imperial schools (eg the Imperial 
     Naval Academy), but many other schools (especially on Sylea) also    
     follow the Immperial School Year.
359  Year End Break (to 365).
     A week-long celebration of the Empire, leading up to Holiday and the 
     new year.

Worlds generally also celebrate the day they joined the Imperium - 
traditionally, this is 001, but not in all cases - and, in the case of 
colony worlds, the day they were founded.

BS!  You are confusing the unsubscribes from the HIWG list with a silent
majority.  When people unsubscribe, I take that as someone who was convinced
to not hang around anymore.  Leave that baggage on the HIWG list, TML is
rattled enough.

Actually, I haven\'t even bothered to ask what Marc thought on the subject.
Nor would I--after all, I have _some_ manners. :)

Like I said, I am _perfectly_ happy with what T4 says.  I\'m just one of the
few who are willing to take a reentry flame without an ablat shield on it.
Afterall, if TML must "think" something, it "must" be right, right?

Actually, they did.

Almost all of the enduring, powerful holidays in our civilization, and in
most world civilizations past and present, are tied strongly to the
seasonal calendar.  There are 8 \'special\' points in this calendar; the two
equinoxes, the two solstices, and the four points halfway between these
(the \'cross quarter\' points).  I\'ve listed these for the northern
hemisphere, together with well-known holidays corresponding:

Vernal Equinox  (03/20)         Easter (floating, 0-34 days following VE)
  CQ 1          (05/01)         May Day (05/01)
Summer Solstice (06/21)         US Independence Day (7/4)
  CQ 2          (08/02)         (none)
Autumnal Eq.    (09/21)         US Labor Day (early September)
  CQ 3          (11/01)         Halloween (10/31)
Winter Solstice (12/21)         Christmas (12/25)
  CQ 4          (02/01)         Ground Hog Day (2/2)

I suggest that Independence Day would not be nearly so large nor popular a
holiday if it hadn\'t absorbed the cultural energy of Midsummer\'s Day.

The Catholic calendar of saint\'s days was specifically crafted to co-opt
\'pagan\' celebrations on the seasonal days; for example, 6/21 is St. John\'s
Day, a major feast day coincidentally atop the Summer Solstice.

So, while the Greeks undoubtedly gave them different names, they did
almost certainly have holidays at the same seasonal points as we do, and
these likely had similar characters, given how tied the seasons are to
cycles of planting and harvest, death and rebirth.

Now, of course, a multiplanetary society won\'t have this common reference
point of seasons to keep their holiday calendars coherent.  But that\'s a
separate question.

While reading the Regency Sourcebook,  I had an idea for a radical sect
of the CSD. I was going to make them a fring element on Parvid (see
Divine Intervention), but since I decided to play in the RC and not the
Spinward Marches, I moved them to Luhtala/Old Expanses.  Feel free to
move them somewhere else.

Church of Stellar Divinity
The Church of Stellar Divinity is widespread throughout the 
Imperium, it believes that Stars are divine beings and need to 
be worshiped.  If a believer is faithful, after his death, his 
spirit will merge with the stars.  On Parvid/Spinward Marches a heretic
branch of the church sprang up. This branch believes that the stars are at 
war with each other, and that people from other planets are 
followers of another star, and must be destroyed.  The branch of 
the church that existed on Luhtala, took this heresy one step 
farther and believes that it is the duty of all believers to help 
fight the war against the other stars.

Before the Collapse, the group was actively seeking to locate a 
working copy of the mythical star trigger. With such a device, 
they could destroy entire stars, and help Lutala\'s star, Amicron, 
win supremacy.

One possible adventure plot is for the Church to fly in to an 
enemy star system and fire canisters of radioactive waste in to a 
star.  They realize this won\'t destroy the star, but feel that it 
might weaken the star enough so Amicron might take advantage of 
its momentary weakness.

The Church also wants to make a device in which they could 
actually enter the atmosphere of the star and commune directly 
with Amicron.  For a possible design see the novel Sundiver by 
David Brin. I don\'t think a device is practical at Traveller tech
levels, but it doesn\'t stop some wackos from trying anyway.

Well, I didn\'t agree with the poster\'s position on TL, and I
also don\'t believe in designing game systems by popular
acclamation, but he has a point.  A point that holds true in
every gaming list I\'ve been on.

The argument is that a majority of the list supports a certain position.
However, the fact is looking at only people who volunteer an opinion
is notorious for being a poor way of measuring either what people
believe or even what they would vote if a formal election is held.

With antimatter you only need to refuel every decade or so.  Compared
to refueling every jump, this is vast improvement, (not to mention
that fact that you free up all that space).

Exactly.   In fact, you just look for that radiation that occurse
when it interacts with interplanetary dust.

    'body' => 'In the Scott Universe, Scouts have three missions - survey, contact, and
administration.  Of those three, the first is divided into known worlds and
unknown worlds.  During early M0, unknown world survey missions are
possibly the best known function, but known world survey missions are the
most important.  As the Imperium ages, the X-boat network gradually takes
over as the best known function of the Scout service.  Contact missions are
the ones that have the most glamor among the scouts themselves, and they
have become quite adept in a short time at protecting their contact
missions from other potential Empire builders.  While the extent of their
survey and contact missions require administration work, most Scouts, and
many members of the public, think that they are completely superfluous.
Few people are as bitter as a long term scout Administrator.

When a ship jumps, it creates a small bubble of real space inside jump
space.  The bubble is quite stable, save at the boundary of jumpspace -
jumpspace gradually breaks down the structure of real space and the things
in it, which is why one needs to pump such tremendous quantities of fuel
into it.  Further, this gives pilots, astrogators, and engineers something
to do during the jump - they are rather busy making sure the calculations
work out.

In an idea universe, this process is entirely predictable.  In the real
world, it is not.  Minor fluctuations in the type and quantity of dust in
the area where one jumps from or two can cause dramatic jump bubble
fluctuations, as can impure fuel.  If you do not have an accurate chart,
you will face roughly the same kinds of difficulties faced someone running
with unrefined fuel.

To prevent this kind of loss, most planets of TL9 or better spend a fair
amount of time and money charting out the area within 100 diameters of
their world.  As a military defense, they often only provide data on
certain well known places, which means that most pirates, who cannot afford
a small scout wing, will tend to cluster in the same rough places that the
merchant ships will be jumping in to.

The Imperium does not like depending on local talent for mapping, and so
funds the scout service well to have ships nearly everywhere plotting all
sorts of approach corridors for a system.  In addition, all of those scout
couriers perform an automatic sample and scan on arrival into a new system,
which gives scout bases a tremendous quantity of raw data on a large number
of systems.

Further, the Scouts will often place an automatic beacon at a few
judiciously chosen points which samples the information and broadcasts a
select subset of it to ships leaving.  I have theorized that the Scouts use
transponders of passing ships to carry this information to other systems as
well, but I have not implemented this as yet.  People might be unhappy
about carrying information for the Scouts for free.  (Note: I usually make
purchasing this information from the Scouts a major money sink for players,
instead of life support, as this can be roughly proportional to the size of
the vessel with little handwaving.)

This does bring up one question - the scouts visit these places long before
anyone else.  How do they deal with the complete lack of such information?

1.  Sensors and trained operators carefully examining the entry point.

By doing a more careful and detailed than usual survey of your jump entry
point, you do not need as much data on your exit point.  It is usually wise
to take about a week or so before making a jump from an unfamiliar system
without a standard Imperial beacon to make sure that you are going to get a
good jump.

2.  Long distance observation of the jump exit point.

A week\'s survey of the exit point from a parsec away can also reduce the
risk, though not as well as a good survey of the entry point.  The entry
point is by far more critical, but every little bit helps.

3.  An educated guess based on old data.

The data does drift, but it tends to remain approximately correct for
several months.  Further, if you have enough data about the system in
general, produced by a recent large scale survey, you can predict how the
data will drift.  The combination of lots of data and lots of computing
power is what allows large starports to produce course tapes that reduce
the risk, even for vessels without a Scout-grade sensor rig.

Yes, I despise background graphics.  The exception are documents and forms

Of course, I also dislike it on web pages for much the same reason.

I spoke a bit soon.  I just got my call.

I did ask, and she said that the decision to go with telemarketing rests
with Courtney Solomon.

At least they picked a friendly person to do the telemarketing.  I am still
not terribly vexed, at least not enough to cancel the Internet pre-order
plan yet.

My associate who was ticked before has said it all hinges on the quality of
FFS.  If it is down to the standards of some previous products, he will
drop the plan and ask them not to call him, while he will keep it if it is
good.  Until they call again.

Note: he commented that IG had caused a loss of innocence.  Previously, he
always felt it very important to get every supplement for a new game, just
to have them all.  After getting Starships, the first printing of the
rulebook, First Survey, and M0, he decided to wait until he heard at least
three good reviews about anything before buying it.

(M0 would have been a good supplement, save that it depended on a map which
was changed after the text was written.)

A vote!  A chance to vote on something!  oboyoboyoboy!  Put me down for
TL12, with the odd bit of research at a different level, and perhaps a
small boost in eco, in return for a drop in grav.

A note: I am writing a program to go through and regenerate in place the FS
data.  I am now thinking that TL should be much more homogenous across the
Imperium, if anyone cares to make it so, and the benefits mean that
someopne almost certainly did want it.

I have not yet come up with hard and fast rules, but I am thinking that
perhaps the rule should be that anyone within one merchant jump of a high
tech, high pop world will have a TL within three of it, unless something
unusual is happening.  (Unusual in my lexicon is about 10%, while unlikely
is about 5%, and exceedingly rare is about 1%.)

Beyond which, merely *having* antimatter is only the first problem
involved in M/AM propulsion.  Storing the stuff aboard a ship is verrrry
tricky as well.  Granted, with TL-15 grav control it\'s much easier than it
looks from TL-8.  But if the power goes out, you are *toast*.  A Fuel-1
hit against a fusion ship means you\'re a bit low on gas; the same hit on a
M/AM ship means you turn into a flash of radiation detectable from nearby
star systems. :)

NMR should be identical, if I\'m figuring correctly.  Pinging with normal
matter would be the trick.  In fact, just the normal \'background\' of
normal matter -- solar wind particles, pieces of normal-matter asteroid
dust, and such -- should be quite adequate to keep AM objects in the belt
\'glowing\' detectably.  Scan the system for 511 keV photon sources, and
you\'ll locate all the significant chunks of antimatter.

Note by the way that this \'glow\' is *far* outside the visible range.  The
Mk I eyeball couldn\'t tell the difference between a normal and an AM rock,
unless enough normal matter were hitting the latter to heat it up and
create visible thermal (blackbody) radiation.

That was my writeup of Glisten you\'re referring to, and my intent
was not to portray them as a bunch of rowdy drunks.  I _did_
assume a strong streak of anarchism running through the entire
culture, top to bottom, but that\'s just my bias; at the time, I
was going through a phase of believing that the US government was
out of control.  I\'m still not convinced it isn\'t, but that
discussion is for another list at another time.

Also, in any kind of report written for tourists, by tourists
(even "professional" tourists), what will be noticed is what\'s
_different_ from the run-of-the-mill that you can find at home.
The RICE papers, regardless of official intent, would naturally
follow that pattern.  In all probability, if a New Yorker were to
visit Glisten, s/he\'d probably find it to be a lot like Midtown
Manhattan, with funny clothes ("in color combinations that even a
Vargr might find in questionable taste"), and a strange
arrangement for providing public services.

Now, my writeup of Nutema is an unabashed "Stereotypical Texans
in Space" ripoff of H. Beam Piper\'s "Lone Star Planet" (published
in some areas as "Planet for Texans"), with enough names changed
and extras added (hopefully consistently) to provide the guilty
with a single fig leaf.

I was wondering about this, too.  I even went so far as to
inquire of a Roman Catholic friend as to how the Church hierarchy
would maintain itself on planets that were cut off from contact
with the Vatican.  Still waiting for an answer; if there\'s
interest, I\'ll post when I get it.

if H2 (having 2Hs) is 2g(H2)/mole and water having 2 Hs also has

How about a low powered Meson Communicator? Or a very low power PA

That\'s fairly on track. Scheduled freight and passenger lines would use
"Imperial Time/Calendar" for scheduling. The military certainly would.
Anything high tech would make automatic conversions on the computer screen
when asked or when necessary.

Any world without a natural calendar (ie, vac world, asteroid belt, etc)
would probably be on Imperial time.

What I like about this discussion is the plot ideas. Thoughtless bureaucrats
implement imposed Imperial calendar without regard to harvest or natural
cycles. Devious bureaucrats motivated by local concerns work to sabotage
adoption because it shuffles local holidays. Imperial Office of Calendar
Compliance sticks its nose into all sorts of affairs in order to make sure
new members of the Imperium are truly loyal and adopting the calendar.

BTW, Thanksgiving is also a Jewish holiday (different time of the year).

CSC. 

One of my main problems with vehicles from MT is that they were *huge*. 
The Kankurur was originally 10 DSP (the size of a 40 ft long, 18 wheeler
truck) This seems rather excessive to me.  This version is 4 DSP and is
the size of a large mobile home, which seems much more reasonable. 

I have two versions of the Kankurur listed here, one with Contra Grav, and
another with Thruster plates.  The Thruster plate version seems more
reasonable to me, since it allows longer voyages and more versatile usage
(good qualities for a scout exploration vessel). When question arose I
used the WBH deckplans in prefrence to the written description when
designing this version of the Kankurur

Both versions are listed below, the stats for the Thruster version are
printed inside <...>, the stats for the Contra Grav version are printed in
[...]. Only drive volume and power requirements, fusion plant (and fuel)
volume, and cargo volume differ between the two versions. 

I replaced the Meson Communicator with a Maser since this saved most of
the cost of the vehicle and over 2 DSP of volume

	Well, a funny side effect was that before the program stopped
making aging rolls, his INT had fallen to about 3.  What with the +1
physical, EDU, and SOC results on the career tables, by age 221 (after
multiple 7-year stints in the Nobles, he re-enlisted in the Army and just
kept going) or so when he was felled in his prime by a bug in the app, his
UPP looked like FFF3FF.  His Language score was about 12, his carousing 10,
he had fencing out the wazoo... but he was as dumb as a piece of 2X4.
Under KB v.2.0, he would have been an utter menace to society... just not a
very bright one :).

	This has revealed an interesting flaw in the chargen system;
basically, you can rack up an insane score on skills if you get lucky or
keep it up long enough.  Frankly, I have no idea what Fencing 12 is
supposed to represent.  And, under any task system that multiplies stats,
it results in an insanely high target number.

	I suggest capping skills at 6, and adding a roll every time you get
a skill; you have to roll higher than your rating in that skill in order to
add to it.  This would have a seriously munchkin-proofing effect; it\'d be
easy to get up to 3 or so, but after that it would be progressively harder
to get up to the stratospheric skill ratings.   Marc, what do you think?

You forgot one catagory, zen there is no TL, all is illusion.
Or in other words I support both sides of this argument. At least until
we came come down to a solid Defintion of TL.

My personal view is that some TL 14 worlds could have existed during the
ROM, but the highest "comonly" available Tech ran around the 12.5 mark.

IMNSHO, TL controls locally manufactured tech, in most cases. Truely 
Isolated worlds it would be the limit of gear available.

Yep that has been my take on belters. Hell, I live Nevada within twenty

Not only that, but you have to deal with the difference betwen the
length of the day (24 hours) and the length of the sol (local solar
day). The day is an imperial standard. The sol is purely local. 

Thus the planets have no *choice* but to have a local calendar using
sols. The length of the local year may or may not be really important,
but it\'s probably of *some* importance. So the local calendars will
vary all over the place.

BTW, I\'m not making up the term "sol". They use it with the Viking and
Mars Pathfinder data. On Mars the sol is around 24 hr 47 min.

So due to the difference, one thing that is going to happen is that the
time during jump will likely have you shifting the day/night cycle on
board from that of the departure point to that of the destination. The
idea is to have the shipboard time at least *resemble* the local time. 

Otherwise you have things like it being 3am ship\'s time at noon local
time. 

I\'m still looking for a good term to use for the subdivisions of a sol
(ie the equivalent of hours). Feel free to make suggestions.

It\'s far cheaper to just throw rocks, and it doesn\'t contaminate the
real estate.

Bounce a low power electron beam off of it. Normal matter will get a
bit warm. Antimatter will react by releasing *lots* of gamma rays (due
to electron/positron annihilation).

So a modified PAW (even a man portable unit) should be sufficient to ID
antimatter from a distance of a km or so.

The year, being standard for a whole bunch of worlds, doesn\'t *have* to
match the local year, and you can avoid charges of favoritism that way.

Also, I suspect that the Imperial and Solomani calendars are *not* in
synch. As I recall they have different leap year rules. So they likely
differ by several days after a mere few hundred years.

Harnessing chunks of "natural" antimatter for power is a *major* pain.
Consider a chunk of antimatter rock. Unless you can refine it, you have
a mix of different elements, which makes it hard to get a controlled
reaction with normal matter.

Read Jack Williamson\'s SeeTee stories for more examples of why working
with "natural" antimatter is such a pain.

Well, you have to realize that "simultaneous" is a meaningless concept
when dealing with widely seperated events. So synchronizing is not a
simple thing.

Since the duration of a jump is not constant (and, if I recall
correctly, the duration onboard and as measured "outside" don\'t have to
match either) you can\'t use ship\'s clocks to synchronize. 

Pulsars are ok for distance, but not so good for timing. I suspect that
the only way to get really accurate time synchronization is to exchange
radio/laser signals between the two star systems. Done properly this
will give the distance and the time.

Luckily, it takes a lot of time to explore and develop a world. So the
fact that reliable timing propogates at light speed isn\'t a handicap.

Actually, seasons tend to be important even *without* much

Just remember that the day isn\'t likely to be that "even". It\'s more
likely to be 19.7 hours, and 200.3 days (actually "sols").

This is why I figure that there will be a *local* time unit that goes
evenly into the sol. We can assume a standard name for it, which
everyone knows means "local hour" just like "sol" means "local day".

You need to be able to divide up the day evenly to make time zones and
work shifts work out without major hassles.

There\'s a comic (originally from Comico) called "Evangeline". The
original promo art had a lady in a nun\'s habit and the same lady in a
jumpsuit with a pistol (typical James Bond pose). And the caption "She
really is on a mission from God". Evangeline is a nun. She\'s also an
agent of the Church, and can, if necessary kill as coldly as anyone in
the spy business.

They *really* changed the storyline. And they dropped one element that
is the *most* adaptable to Traveller. That warrant from the Cardinal:

	"By my hand, and for the good of the state, what the bearer has
	 done has been done."

A true "carte blanche". A similar Imperial Warrant signed by some high
noble could be a *very* valuable bit of loot from an adventure. It
gives the *ultimate* "get out of jail free" card. The big stress on
most players would be "do we really want to waste it on *this*?"

I can see players going thru all sorts of contortions to avoid
"wasting" the warrant. :-)

There are references (somewhere) to the belt containing *antimatter*
asteroids. That\'s a good reason for a red zone. Both because of the
hazard, and because the Navy wants to figure out how to use the
antimatter.

Why not go the whole distance and instead of basing the archbishop on Tim
Curry in "The three musketeers" (hated that one) base the Archbishop on Tim
Curry in Ridley Scotts "The Legend" - now that\'s an archvillain!

is that most (my) PC have as much wit and charm as a stick of dynamite.

When did the Imperials actually encounter the Droyne? It must have been
quite a shock to find a nonhuman race scattered on different planets
generally lacking in jumptech.

I don\'t know about anyone else, but I *love* this idea, please use it.
Other than the current emperor\'s birthday and the date of the founding of
the Imperium, how about all other holidays are numbered.  Each individual
world then get to decide what to name each of these holidays (as in
Holiday No. 6:  TreeRat Migration Day, Holiday No. 8:  Solomani Rim War
Victory Day).  Everyone gets their favorite local holidays, but the
Imperial Calendar remains unsullied by local preferences and
idiosyncracies. 

This method of naming holidays is both fun and truly captures the spirit
of living in a truly *Vast* Imperium + it has that nice Vilani touch to 
it :)

Yes Liquid H2 is 14 times lighter than Water (for the same volume). And
then there is more H2 in on Liter of water than in one liter of H2. 

>Is water truely a beter way to store large quanities of H2 in less space
>than LH2 (neglecting that H2 in the water has no "fuel" value----just
>talking about the quantity of H atoms stored in a given space)????

I\'ve also thought of that, but using water has some drawback:
14m3 of H2 weight 1T
1m3 of H2O weight 1T and has 1/9T of H2

So there is 1.55 times more H2 in H2O than in H2 (for the same volume)

imagine you needed 1400m3 of H2 (100T), you would need 900m3 of water
instead. But the trouble is that the weight for the same "efficiency" in 9
times higher. 

That is to say that you would have to recalculate the needed tonnes of
thrust to push your ship. The fuel consumption would be higher then.

Further more, you would need a fuel purification plant sufficiently large
to provide the correct rate of LH2 to the Propulsion device. 

Last remark : The jump fuel HAS to be Liquid H2 (and well refined), so you
would have to wait to get the required jump fuel volume for the jump. 

The only solution if you want to use this design is

Jump fuel tank filled with refined H2
G-turn tanks filled with water.
Fuel purification plant sufficiently large G-turns fuel
Thrust energy and fuel consuption recalculated with the loaded mass

  Well, I just went over to the library (it\'s one door down here in

there.  I\'d love to know where it is published, though, since it sounds
interesting.

  I agree - makes it hard to see how we can change our social behaviour
with respect to the environment, given how deep seated our actions seem to
be.

> Any idea what this Marcus guy has to say about the whole affair?

  As I recall from talking with him, the book is a survey that makes use
of the most recent scholarship on a wide variety of things.  The section
that addresses White\'s work is based on several studies from the late
1970s and early 1980s that show some of the causal relationships that
White cites can\'t be true, since either the chronology is off or the
events described didn\'t happen.  My notes on all this are back in Oregon -
remind me after September 15 and I\'ll dig the stuff out and post
references.

Is that canon? I believe that an White Dwarf article way back had something
on jump relativity errors and also that there\'s beem some talk about it in
Challenge but as far as I can tell (isn\'t there a net acronym for that?)
nothing from Digest or GDW. The "Strider incident" article in Challenge
gave the refs several options on what the girl really was and one variant
was that she had suffered a severe jump relativity error.

This might be an simple plotdevice to transport PC into another era (out of
TNE perhaps ;) but I don\'t like it especially not for normal jumps as time
dilation and such smells relativity theory and jumping has NOTHING to do
with speed. The same goes for stutterwarp by the way.

Anyone got any sources or ideas here?

The Edict 319 (or whatever the number) was more or less just that and
Norris spent the early parts of 5FW tracking it down so that he could use
it on the incompetent Santanochev and relieve him of his command.
Q: How does the Imperium handle such document so they look cool, official
and pompous yet "impossible" (as in impossible task) to forge. Please no
electronic credit cards stuff - I want some high tech noble rings marking
sigills or whatever.

BTW What ever happened to poor Santanochev after the war?

The benefits are all for the lower-tech world as its TL approaches 
that of the higher.  That may mean that the Vilani control of 
technology artificially slowed the technological growth of new 
colonies, simply to have markets for high-tech goods.  After all, if 
most worlds are TL11, there\'s going to be very little demand for 
manufactured goods, and interstellar shipping will be a luxuries 
trade only.  There will be exceptions -- asteroid worlds will have to 
sell their goods low to echange for vital supplies -- but in general 
a homogeneous TL will reduce trade.

There was also the Vilani use of TL as power: only the Vilani could 
be allowed TL11, and "subject races" would be discouraged from 
scientific experimentation.  This also would act against the 
trickle-down of TL from high to low.

Finally, if you can import the TL11 goods you need, why spend all 
that money on research?  Many world governments, given the choice, 
would choose public spending over technology every time.

I think all these mitigate against the spread of technology in 
Traveller, but obviously the extent of the effect is debatable...

Thanks Peter.

Now, does the handwaving extend to the years being in sync? In other words,
are the various solstices in sync...

Yes and no.

LH2: 0.07*1000g H/l * 1 mol / 1.008g H = 70 mol H / l
H2O: 1000g H2O/l * (2 mol H / 18.016g H2O) = 111 mol H / l

So, water *is* a more compact way of storing H2 than LHyd, but not to 
the tune of 10 times. 

Energy taken to release the H2 is minimal compared to fusion
powerplant output per mol: energy of an O-H bond in H2O is roughly
428 kJ/mol, so it takes twice that to dissociate an H2O molecule. If
we assume we get no energy back from the 2H -> H2 and 2O -> O2
processes (i.e. we only get heat, not work), then 1 mol H requires
428 kJ to produce.  In an hour a 1 MW powerplant produces 3600 MJ =
8500 mol (say) = 8.5 tonnes of H2.

The FF&S draft gives 0.01 MW to purify 1 m^3 LH2 in 6 hours at TL8. 
I would calculate that as 0.01 * 6 * 8.5 tonnes = 0.51 tonnes = 7
m^3, assuming zero overhead for pumps etc..  Later purification 
plants are more efficient and manage 0.005 MW/m^3 / 6 hours.  This 
also includes refining the fuel once the H2 is produced, if you take 
the position that jump LH2 has to be pure protium, with no deuterium 
or tritium.

So, let me get this straight: you\'re saying that if someone 
unsubscribes to a list where there\'s a discussion of RoM TL, they 
must agree with you, otherwise they\'d stay and debate it?

If I accept "convinced not to hang around anymore" as a reason for 
unsubscribing to a list, that could mean:

a) Convinced view A is correct
b) Convinced view not-A is correct
c) Fed up of the whole argument

or probably lots of other things.  I cannot believe you are asserting 
anything so ludicrous as "everyone who unsubscribed must have agreed 
with me", so could you please explain this?

Nick

P.S. On the basis of Leroy\'s evidence, I\'d agree with a TL12 RoM, 
maybe shading into TL13 in some areas (certainly experiments) and TL 
13-14 in genetic and perhaps medical technology.

Cardsharks said - "What I like about this discussion is the plot ideas.
Thoughtless bureaucrats implement imposed Imperial calendar without regard
to harvest or natural cycles. Devious bureaucrats motivated by local
concerns work to sabotage adoption because it shuffles local holidays.
Imperial Office of Calendar Compliance sticks its nose into all sorts of
affairs in order to make sure new members of the Imperium are truly loyal
and adopting the calendar."

I second that emotion. When the Julian Calendar was replaced by the
Gregorian calendar in the early 18th century here in Britain and Ireland
there were massive demonstrations and even civil disturbances. Country
dwellers felt that the city dwellers and parliaments were imposing a
calendar that bore no relation to the rythms of their lives - replacing
popular holidays, market days, and festivals that were an established part
of rural life.
     There are even stories - largely apocryphal, but often reported by
less careful historians - that there were riots in Dublin, Ireland, because
less educated memebers of the public were convinced that the calendar
adjustment had actually robbed them of 11 days of their lives. Imagine the
chaos that could ensue from this kind of misconception and the trouble the
Imperium would have clearing up the confusion (and the debris).

Anytime you distend spacetime you may get time travel ala wormholes. 
A lot of cosmological work being done right now into these geometries
for instant space and time travel.  All theoretical and probably more
fringe than the average physicist.

So jumping may not take yoiu close to the speed of light, but it does do
something with space, brigning in the prospect of gravity and general
relativity.

	I remember my father telling me that he once read somewhere that hundreds
of years ago, there were riots when the calendar was changed. People
thought they were not going to live as long because a calendar change
showed on record that someone lived a few weeks or something shorter than
they actually did! Conversely, changing the calendar to move the dateline
forward could also have its own problems. Changes such as these could cause
all sorts of various unpredicatable situations. 

	I can see it now; Imperial officials tell the low-tech populace that it is
now next week, due to a re-alignment of the calendar, and Duayle the farmer
leads a revolt. His produce has just ripened, and he was due to take it to
market tomorrow, but market day was now technically last week - although it
never really took place due to the calendar changing - and the next big
market day isn\'t for three weeks. His produce will have turned well rotten
by then, so he has to sell it locally at vastly reduced prices, almost
ruining him. Any pohn-beets that are left go red to indicate that they have
become poisonous, and Duayle uses the juice from them to poison the local
Imperial governor because he is so aggrieved at what has happened.

	The governor, being an off-worlder, doesn\'t carry the chemical in his
bloodstream that would have adversely reacted with Duayle\'s pohn-beet
poison, and so laughs off the attack. He sentences Duayle to one week in
prison, but as the current week was ruled as being last week, Duayle gets
off. What a laugh!

	More often than not, it\'s way much more work trying to get a 
commercially published adventure up and running than making up your 
own. Every time I buy an adventure, I find that I\'m forced to rewrite 
50% of it: Not only because I\'m using a different game system, but 
because most adventures are location-specific. So, time to dig those 
sector maps and start looking for matching worlds closer to the PCs.

	Even worse, most published adventures tend to concentrate on flashy 
maps and illos, but at the table boil down to something closer to 
Duke Nukem.

	Of course there are exceptions - the Argon Gambit was one of the
best adventures I\'ve ever thrown at my players (Thanks for finding it 
for me back then, Paul!).

	Again, IMO, the best adventures are the ones you write specifically 
for your group, set on worlds of your choice, in a subsector you feel 
comfortable with, in your favorite time period. Think mass 
production versus custom made. Of course it takes time, but if your 
group gets together, say, once a month, you have more than enough 
time to do it all yourself. It only takes an hour to work a nice 
coloured world map.

	Hmmm.. I\'m starting to realize why I always leave a gaming store
empty-handed (It\'s because they don\'t have Solomani & Aslan and Best
of JTAS #1 *wink wink nudge nudge*).

	To me the idea of a starter edition Traveller sounds odd. "Starter 
edition" = T$R ripping off 12-year olds, "Traveller" = an intelligent 
game for adults who have patience to work a while to get what they 
want.

	What was it Leroy said something about instant gratification? :)

(Yow and end to lurking! Something I _know_ about!)

This would actually be the same way they did during the past 2000 years- 
1) Municipality/Small continent - Bishop           =   Baron
2) High pop Continent/Small World - Archbishop     =   Count
3) High pop World  - Archbishop                    =   Earl
4) Sector  -  Cardinal                             =   Duke
5) Universe ;\'> - Pope                             =   Emperor

This structure was taken directly from the Roman Imperial government and
worked quite well untill the black death of the 14th century seriously
messed up the social structure underlying it. (see Barbra Tuchman\'s "A
Distant Mirror" for more detail on that.) 

In all probability, by that time, there will have been some kind of
realinement between the sects of Christianity. I doubt that it\'ll ever
merge compleatly into one (it never has been, why start now?), but a UN
kind of governing body w/ the pope as SecGen I could see quite easily.
Also, church hierarchies have always been political; if you introduce
any of them to your campaign, you\'ll get lots of interesting fodder for
nuggets...

Because both Meta and Ator would feel insulted if put under the same

	A medieval-type scroll made of high-strenght plastics, with 
molecular-level "text" (public verification keys) spread here and 
there. Feels like pergament, stands up to almost any kind of 
punishment. The basic text of the document is written on it, the same

private-key signed TL 13 holochips imbedded in "paper".

	Any naval base, embassy etc. has an extensive database of 
high-ranking nobility\'s public keys, so verifying authenticity is 
easy. Just boot that PDGP (Pretty Damn Good Privacy)... :)

	Depends on whether or not you have access to a gravisonic polarizer

to freeze-dry it gently in the airlock. If neither, your Jewish
chicken soup might just start _thinking_ about how good you would

Well, let\'s see - I\'ve found several problems with the MT Ref Comp sources,
as not matching up with either Imp Ency, or the earlier CT sources.

940 is the correct year for the dissolution of the autonomous region.
 
As a standard practice, I use Imperial Dating for everything.  Honestly,
given that the MT Imp Encyclopedia listing was done via a spreadsheet,
I\'d use that data to rebuild it, and generate everything from the Imperial
Dates given...

Brian McNett <brianmc@aol.com>

I\'m starting a mailing list for people interested in creating 3D 
Starmaps. I\'ve started the mailing list because there are several people 
who have expressed interest in my current starmap project, and keeping 
them updated as a group is more practical than doing so individually. 
Also, I see a shortage of reliable, up-to-date tools for creating and 
manipulating such maps in 3D on the Apple Macintosh, and wish to 
encourage others to help create such tools.

I\'ve also started this list partly at the behest of Winchell Chung, whose 
3D Starmap page is a fine place to get started:

<http://www.clarke.net/nyrath/starmap.html>

However, the Mac tools are a bit dated, and Winch and I\'d both appreciate 
some input toward correcting this situation. Don\'t give Winch a tough 
time about all the PC stuff on the site! Winch works as a Mac programmer 
- -- he\'s one of the good guys!

You may subscribe to the list by sending a message to <brianmc@aol.com>, 
and including the words:

subscribe 3D Starmap

Somewhere in the body of the message. You will recieve an automated 
response explaining how to post to the list, and some basic rules and

it.

to unsubscribe, send a message and include the words:

I had a pre-print copy of the article, so I wasn\'t sure where it was to be
found. I did some digging, and it appears that the article was to be
printed in a book called _Technological Change_ Ed., Robert Fox. (London:
Harwood). I guess it was printed this year, but I\'m not sure.

Makes you wonder how realistic all this interstellar history in Traveller
is. It\'s certainly optimistic and would probably need to be accompanied by
social and cultural changes that made these people all but unrecognizable
to us. Unfortunately, that\'s a level of realism that makes games
impractical (and largely meaningless).

Why not use SI prefixes?

hour equivalent = decisol
minute = millisol
second = microsol

for Terra (1 sol = approx. 24 standard hours)

1 hour = 0.417 decisol
1 minute = 0.694 millisol
1 second = 11.57 microsol

Of course, metric time isn\'t nearly as handy to divide as base 60
minutes/seconds, and 24 hours per day.

Alternatively, how\'s this entymology:

1 sol = 24 sol-hours -> solours -> solars
1 solar = 60 sol-minutes -> solinutes  -> solmints
1 solmint = 60 sol-seconds -> solsecs (hmmmm...)

On second thought, hows this:

Sol - Solor - Solit - Solec

Only if you hold to the idea that ALL the hydrogen fuel during jump is
consumed to generate power. Given the various jump theories floating about
that indicate that the hydrogen is used to create a bubble of normalspace
around the ship, you still need \'fuel\'.

As for fuelling powerplants and suchlike, though, you\'re correct.

for those people\'s campaign that run more to \'Red Dwarf\' than \'Serious
sociopolitical analysis in Space\' certainly.

I can see it now...the ancient Solomani tradition of Holiday 11, with it\'s
honorable and ancient traditions rising from the mists (and myths) of
time...which was actually invented by one A.J. Rimmer during his all-too
brief promotion to Space technician third class in charge of marking in
the calendar, and decided that the calendar just didn\'t look right, needed
a touch of mauve there, and invented a new holiday. 

Was that the summer replacement series of (way too many years ago) with
Richard Benjamin as the captain of a garbage colletor ship?

Well, you\'ve messed up the calculations; a liter of H2 liquid is NOT the
same number of moles as a liter of water, liquid.

1 Mole H2 = 2g which is the molar equivalent of 1 Mole H2O = 18g

therefore 1 l LH2 = 0.07 g/l = 0.07g H2/ 2G/Mole =
0.035 moles H2
while 1l H2O = 1000 g/l = 1000 gH2O / 18 g/mole = 55.5 moles H2O = 55.5
Moles H2

yes, H2O is a Mah-velous way to store H2. We can only presume that the
reason that H2 is standard vs H2O is that the \'fuel purification\' process
produces lH2 at a very slow rate compared to the rate at which it needs to
be dumped for the ship to jump.

Better yet, store the stuff as lNH3, liquid ammonia:

lNH3 = 1.5 Moles H2

1l NH3 = 0.68 g/ml * 1000 ml = 680 g/l / 17 g/Mole = 40 moles NH3 *1.5
moles H2 = 60 moles H2 / l NH3. The only drawback is that ammonia is a
corrosive material, but since we send thousands of tankloads of lNH3
around the country daily with few mishaps, it could be done.

   In CT, the years of Gregorian and Imperial calendars were (on
   average) exactly in sync.  (MT, in a fit of other unnecessary changes
   to canon designed to make calculations more difficult, changed this.) 
   Since the Imperial calendar seems to have no leap years, this means
   that (in CT), the Imperial and Gregorian days do not match, although
   they are pretty close.  In MT, who knows? Maybe nothing matches.  MT
   gives many scattered (and very detailed) references to calendars in
   various books; it would not surprise me at all if these references
   contradicted one another. At any rate, they are way too complicated
   for me to want to bother using them; I\'ll just stick with the old
   CT/Gregorian conversion.

   `Simultaneous\' is not meaningless for widely separated events if they
   move in the same rest frame.  Since special relativity is very well
   understood, it should be trivial for two worlds to lock onto a signal
   from a pulsar and then correct for the velocity difference between
   them.  Since these velocity differences are liable to be small
   relativistically speaking, the habitants of one world should have
   little trouble speaking of simultaneous events on other worlds.

Yes and no - the benefits feel greater to the low tech world all the way
along, but for most of the period of tech level growth from zero to that of
the high tech world, it benefits the high tech world out of proportion to
what it costs them.  Figure - training a hundred doctors to the point of a
medical tech takes a few years, and uses fairly cheap resources.  This then
builds a very powerful caste of healers that need high tech medicines, and
that can convince kings and lords to buy these drugs.

You are quite correct, though, that you do not want the low tech world
getting to the point where it becomes competition.

I envision a deliberate Imperial program to bring worlds up to "reasonable
standards" early on.  Any world that is not specifically prevented from
having this happen should probably be brought up to 2-3 tech levels below
the Imperial average.  After all, Earth would be a hell of a market for
Sylea today, and a hell of a competitor if they were dumb enough to let us
get too much higher.  They want us to be a good market for TL12 fusion plus
and grav vehicles, but they do not want us producing lots of goodies that
someone might want instead of fusion plus and grav cars.

I have no problem with that, I just think that they would want the tech
levels to hover about TL8-9, if TL11 was what the Vilani Empire ran at.

Good point - I will make sure that the high tech worlds stay on top, by
making the surrounding worlds only come up to a marketable tech level.
After all, no matter how much a TL0 culture wants Pepsi, they are not going
to produce enough to justify shipping to the place.

True, true.  I do think, though, that the tech level spread on neighboring
worlds should be closer than they now are.  It seems (to me) that two TLs
or so is a good target.  This gives your military a clear advantage (about
a factor of ten in my rules), your economy greater strength (about a factor
of two in production), but makes them a good enough market to sell to. 

...

True, but if you are too low, you cannot afford the TL11 goods you need.
When the "blaster" (laser) your bodyguard should have is something near the
annual product of your duchy, you have a problem.  This would motivate them
to improve for quite some time.

Once they get technology to the level where you can afford to buy most of
the high tech goods you want, then the need is much less.  Further, the
grants, loans, and technology investments that were formerly given to you
by the clever merchants (in exchange for land and so on) dry up about this
point.

>I think all these mitigate against the spread of technology in 
>Traveller, but obviously the extent of the effect is debatable...

I\'d be glad to debate it, but I suspect our conclusions would be similar in
broad, different in fine.  You raise some good points as to why there
should be a significant spread, and I hope I have been convincing that the
spread will be near that supposed ideal much of the time, because it is in
the high tech world\'s interest for it to be.

This leaves the huge question of what the ideal spread actually is and
should be.

agreed. Vargr should be able to switch easier. Culturally vilani never
switch. Solomani I allow to switch 1 time in CGen, even under MT. Imperial
(not culturally vilani, solomani, or some other significant minor race with
CGen mods) I would allow 1 switch if it made sense... I assume this later

I allow anyone who voluntarily left (I.E., didn\'t fail re-enlist or
survival) to re-up so long as they can make 5 terms by the end of their 9th
term. More flexible with non-(para-)military. And when those injured out
try to go back, first they must make the CT/MT "Waiver" throw: 8+ on 2d, no
mods.

I\'d limit it to 7 terms plus any extras for manditory reenlistment in any

No auto eligibility for those over 18. But a +1 to the target # (under t4).

CT & MT\'s Aging rules tended to have a Life Expectancy of about 70 years;
However, obviously, solomani should be longer lived, as should Vliani. V&V
game me a method for determining Blood Purity; I modified it to suit my
needs. Note that (IIRC) the average expected lifespan for any +1 aging save
character is about 100 years under CT/MT aging tables.

Under MT, in S&A, I noticed that Solomani Aging Saves were 1 point easier
than Imperial. Vilani are +0 to +5. Sooo, I use the following table
(adapted from V&V, and modified):

**Ref\'s should be liberal with these mods; give the benefit of the doubt IF

*** Initial PS only. I allow Imperial PC\'s to be members of the Solomani
Party, should they choose. They then have both a Soc and A Party Stat.
Since imperial careers do not allow for improvements of the party stat, it
will NOT go up duing initial CGen. All members of the Party are at least
Creols, and must treat final rolls (on the table above) of 9+ as 8.

Now, with all this gibberish up, It relates to the Lentuli Line. Obviously,
Terrans are hardier stock than most hominids in imperial space, by MT
Rules. So are Vilani. Why?

Terrans: they are fully compatable with their native environment, thus it
tends to throw more at them during evolutionary time. Selection for the
healthiest individuals. And healtier persons are GENERALLY longer lived.

Vilani: DUe to the need for specialized food preparation (V&V, p.2), a long
and involved proccess (except for canibilani), it can be assumed that the
shugilli who lived longer learned better, and thus were more prosperous
(less starved). It can be assumed that their families prospered, and
probably interbred with the rest of the population, thus dragging the whole
population upwards, and appretices would then train longer, become better
shugilli, and raise the overall health of the community, as well as
spreading the selected for genome through the population more thoroughly.

The reasons for Putting the two races at opposite ends is as follows:

1) Terrans probably do not have the selected genome for vilani aging; I
figure it is a semi-recessive trait. (Now we see who\'s kept up on their
genetics) (Semi-recessive traits are ones that, IIUC/IIRC are composed of
several recessive genes, but will manifest with only partial duplication to
trigger)

2) Vilani are selected for natural longevity by genetic design; Solomani
gain longevity by selection for overall health, and resistance to
pathogens. Most of those pathoges being absent on Vland, Vilani genotypes
do not have as highly developed immune systems responses; those ceased
being selected for once they were placed on Vland. 9800 years is time to
see changes starting (that\'s the time from Vilani spaceflight to M0,); the
300,000 years of isolation on vland is more than enough to support major
evolutionary change.

3) It makes for good story-lines

In M0, it seems that the aging saves have been modified to give the basic
system an expected lifespan of ~100 years (according to peter). Also, M0
assumes most of the syleans are Solomani, Vilani, or a creole thereof.

Yes, it is _much_ easier.  We can store small amounts now.  It

Well, that is why you would have an emergency "warp core ejections"
system with an auxilary power supply (just like in Star Trek :-).
The fact is that you can easily make up an emergency system that
can keep it going in case of minor damage and an eject it if
the power system is so badly damaged it\'s not coming back
on line.

Very nice, Volker. Thanks for the handy Ancients resource.

Two small issues:

1) I hate to act territorial, but I sort of coined the use of the term
"Domain of Deneb" last April as the title of my own page located at :

http://www.cris.com/~Cgriffen/traveller/deneb.shtml

I don\'t object to your use of the term (how could I since I hold no legal
license to the name!) but there could be some brand confusion if people use
our sites frequently. Just a thought.

2) You might want to make the Imperial Sunburst in the upper lefthand
corner a non-scrolling region. A scroll bar appears next to it which is
slightly misleading. All a scroll attempt does is drop you down about three
or four pixels.

Nice work!

Best,

Not quite true IIRC. They are known about, but nobody has yet realised 
they are a major race (either way, they - and Chirpers - have already 
been mentioned in T4 products, so it\'s not like you\'re introducing 
anything new).

When did the 3I encounter the K\'Kree & Hivers? They *are* on the table, 
which surprised me.

NOTES
The Schattenfalke-Class Jump Transport provides stealthy transportation for
commando teams and covert operatives. The design maximizes TL-13 stealth
capabilities using a sub-100-ton hull, EM masking, EMS jammer and decoys.
Schattenfalkes are currently constructed only at top-secret naval yards on
Anduril/Sword Worlds (Spinward Marches: 1026 A985855-D). Fuel scoops
covering 20% of the ship\'s surface fill the tank in 0.36 hours. The ship
also has a fuel purification plant (0.946 MW; 378.815 cubic meters in 12
hours). Displacement tons and volume without the decoys is 95 tonnes and
1330 cubic meters, respectively. The ship\'s laser is remote-controlled from
the MFD.

   Technically, a cardinal is not part of the church\'s government
   hierarchy per se; he\'s just a bishop, priest or deacon who happens to
   have been appointed to a very important college.  Today, most
   cardinals are archbishops, which means they do have positions in the
   government hierarchy, but as archbishops, not cardinals.  The various
   ranks of bishops are Assistant, Suffragan, Diocesan, Metropolitan or
   Archbishop, Primate, Patriarch, and Pope.

   A workable interstellar schema might be to have the first four ranks
   as they are today, with primates heading subsector-sized terratories
   and patriarchs heading sectors, domains, or nonterratorial bodies
   (like special rites).  Regular episcopal appointments might be
   handled by the primates, who would take over what are today the
   pope\'s major duties.

  We know that there is no \'D\' in Vilani, but that the way the
  Vilani pronounce \'R\' is similar (but not quite identical) to
  the way Solomani pronounce \'D\'.

  We know that most of the sector names from the Imperial Core
  are Vilani names.

  That means that there are at least three erroneous sector
  names.

  Dagudashag    - this should be Ragurashag.
  Mendan        - this should be Menran.
  Amdukan       - this should be Amrukan.

  And at least one planet that became prominent is also
  erroneous:

  Usdiki        - this should be Usriki.

  I note that if I pronounce _every_ maybe-Vilani word that I
  see that has either an \'R\' or a \'D\' in it as though it _were_
  Vilani, I am thoroughly convinced that a Solomani with a South
  Asian (Indo-pak) background would have _no_ trouble
  identifying the words as having \'R\', not \'D\'.

Well, I was never a big fan of this theory, however, in any
case it makes  a difference with maneuver drives, etc.
 
In fact, misjumps are no longer fatal.  At 6 G\'s you can probably
get to a nearby star before yoru provisions run out, and even
if you can\'t, you just hop in a low birth for the trip.

>Please define the term "pocket universe" and its implications.

The way I look at it, each block of technology is ruled by a small set of
technologies.  We are in the age ruled by energy-dense fossil fuels and
mechanization.  The Imperial era is in the era rules by jump drive, grav
vehicles, and fusion power.  The Ancient era runs from TL16-TL21, and is
ruled by antimatter power, AI machines, and pocket universes/teleportation.
 The TL22-30 era is ruled by universal gates, limitless power for each
living being, and awesomely large scale projects.  As Gurps Ultra Tech put
it, **POOF**, you are healed, dead, or inside a structure of arbitrary size
and complication.

Pocket universes were discussed at length in Secret of the Ancients, I
believe, in which Marc Miller finally described in detail exactly how the
Grandfather did his teleportation magic.

The idea is that teleportation is a really groovy power for an individual
or race to have, but that it has minor physics problems, even worse than
for a jump drive.  For example if momentum is conserved and you teleport
dramatically eastward/westward, your momentum will be suddenly very
different from your surroundings, which can lead to psion hurtling into the
air, or slamming into the earth.  If energy is conserved, and you teleport
upwards, you have a higher energy, which has to come from somewhere.
Likewise, a Psion who teleports a dozen km straight down has the energy of
a satchel charge or small artillery shell.  (12000*9.8*100kg results in
roughly 12Mj, or about a 3 kg bomb.)

Add one other factor to this mix.  We already know that there is at least
one alternative space - jump space.  Traveller canon insists that entry
into jump space takes a week to exit, and has some range limitations.  If
teleportation matter transmission used jump space, then we have the
possibility of less than a week being needed for a jump.

In order to settle "how it works", Marc stated that the Ancients, who had
matter transport, did it by opening a gate to a pocket universe, shoving
what they wanted to move into it, and then opening a second gate to where
they wanted it to go.  The transit was instantaneous, and energy and
momentum were conserved, though entropy was not.

A pocket universe is a chunk of our own space time which has been
completely separated from our own.  There are a fair number of naturally
occurring ones, but they are not big, and they do not contain stars or
other energy sources.  IIRC, he said that it was a TL21 task to separate a
chunk of space yourself and turn it into its very own universe.  If you do
not want to do that, and instead want to create one from scratch, it is a
much harder task.  TL25 or so?

Why would you want to pinch one off, or create one from scratch?

1.  Most pocket universes do not contains stars.  If you are going to spend
any significant time there, it would be nice if there were a clean power
source fueled for a billion years.

2.  The distance that you can move in a teleportation is limited to the
size of the pocket universe you are in.  Thus, the bigger the universe, the
farther you can go in one instantaneous hop.  I assume that a Psion with
teleportation jumps through a bunch of them when making a hop, and that
there are a fair number available.  Unfortunately, there is some effort
required, so it would be very, very convenient of the Psion could hook up
with a really big pocket universe, and thus make it easier to make a long
jump.

By pinching it off yourself, you get to make it as large as you need it,
and you can put whatever you need inside of it.

The Grandfather needed to go hide, and so moved a dozen stars and an area
about the size of a subsector as one big pocket universe.  He left a number
of gates here and there, from which he can emerge and look around.  If all
of his gates get destroyed, there is a hint that he could build more.

End of stuff form Secret of the Ancients and other references.

I have ruled that Psionics is, in general, powered by gating energy in from
jump space, from the near area through a pocket universe gate, or from the
personal resources of the psion.  Of these, the pocket universe is by far
the most useful, _if_ there happens to be one nearby with a decent energy
differential from where you now are.  Races that focus on Psionics discover
that the amount of energy they can direct becomes limitless, once they can
put a universe nearby with a big power supply in it, and another one that
they can use to teleport arbitrary distances.

Thus, if you have a universe that is 50M across, you can connect as many
times as your hardware can handle, as long as all of the connecting
receivers can fit within the boundary.  Further, if one of the gates goes
into jump space, only other receivers on that same vessel can connect to
the pocket universe.  You cannot use it to enter/exit a ship currently in
jump space, at least at the TL the Ancients were at when they started to
plaster each other with monster energy beams.

Each time you connect to such a thing, you make it harder for someone else
to do so at the same time, and that connecting to the center is far easier
than connecting to the outside.  Further, the easiest connections skate
around the boundary of it without ever entering the pocket universe, which
is why early TL17-18 devices do not put anything there, they just instantly
transfer things to other places.  Most people at TL17 are convinced that
this is just like jump space - it always takes zero time for a teleport,
instead of a week for a jump.

In my own universe, the big secret of TL18 is the ability to leave things
in the pocket universe.  If it is possible to store jump fuel in such a
place, and to have it remain connected to the vessel when it hits jump
space, then you can just plop a gas giant into your pocket universe, and
stop worrying about fuel.  I figure this starts to happen at TL18.  The
pocket universe can be accessed from only one receiver, and it is bound to
that one at construction.  Pocket universes are also used for longer
distance instantaneous teleportation.

About TL 19 or so, I receivers are good enough to send simple things over
interstellar distances, such as fuel, power, and information.  You are
still cut off in jump space, but you can bring along your gas giant worth
of fuel, and a small AM plant to run things while you are out of touch.
Planets start to get connected virtually with zero time links.  It still
takes time to move things, as interstellar teleportation is limited.
Further, technology has revealed how to scramble someone else\'s links, and
so warships have independent power supplies.

At TL21+, you can use a pocket universe to connect complicated machinery to
a ship in jump space.  In addition, interstellar teleportation becomes
practical, but can still be interfered with.  This means that your "ship"
is only as big as the life support area you want to be able to walk around
in, with all of the nasty power plant, drives, screens, and so on being at
home where experts on the ground can maintain it.  This is about the end of
the starship as we know it.  You can put big, nasty weapons on your planet,
and send out ships that are essentially just receivers.  As long as the
enemy cannot jam you, you can do fearsome damage from a tiny vessel.
Jamming technology becomes the order of the day, with AIs far smarter than
their creators trying to outthink each other.

Sometime after this, they finally figure out secure interstellar
teleportation without prepared receivers, and there is an end to jump
vessels entirely.  All transport becomes instantaneous, and weaponry that
can rattle space time becomes commonplace.  Right about then, each living
person becomes a minor godling by any standard of previous people.

>How can I use this "artifact" for an adventure?

I used it in the form of teleportation, and also to have rooms bigger
inside than out.  I also used it to store things from any time in the last
million years or so.  I have not yet sprung the godling thing on the
players yet, because it truly is a campaign killer, unless there is some
reason for them to not interact with the being again.

I am thinking that this could explain why Grandfather is hiding out in a
pocket universe - he realized that he was a near godling, and that someone
else at the core had gotten there first.  He is hoping that either the
critter at the core would wipe out the Imperium, and figure it was safe, or
that the third Imperium could be used as a catspaw.

My one sure rule for Ancient encounters - the Ancients do NOT make any kind
of sense, and they should stay that way.

=46or convenience:
DAY refers to standard Imperial day
SOL refers to local planetary day
YEAR refers to standard Imperial year
ANO refers to local planetary orbital period about star.

Imperial Dating System: (CT)
DAY =3D 24 hours, divided into 60 minutes, divided into 60 seconds.
YEAR =3D 365 DAYs, numbered 001 to 365.  001 is a holiday, called
HOLIDAY; does not have a day name attached.  Other days have a
day name attached in a cycle of seven; names are Oneday, Twoday,
Threeday, Fourday, Fiveday, Sixday, Sevenday; elided to Wonday,
Tuday, Thriday, Forday, Fiday, Sixday, Senday.  Cycle always
comes out "perfect"; any given numbered day will occur on the
same named day every year.  Dates written "ddd-yyyy"; ddd is day
number, yyyy is year number.  001-0001 is date of founding of
Third Imperium

Vilani dating system: (?)
SOL =3D 32 hours, divided into _dran_, "day", asterise to asterset
and _dir_, "night", asterset to asterise.  Other divisions
probable but not documented.
ANO =3D 1,000 half-SOLs. ANO begins with dran and counts
sequentially, alternating dran and dir.  Dates written
"yyyy.ddd"; yyyy is ANO, ddd is number of dran or dir (ddd odd is
dran, ddd even is dir). 0001.001 is date of founding of First
Imperium.

NOTE: MTA1 gives SOL of "just under" 32 hours and ANO of "about"
360 SOLs, and divides SOL into 4 quarters or 10 tenths; the tenth
is divided into 100 mils.  No equivalent dating is given.
Intercalary SOLs are inserted at the end of every tenth ANO, but
since an exact measurement of the ANO and SOL are not given, the
details can\'t be determined.

Solomani Dating System: (?)
SOL =3D DAY
ANO =3D 365 SOLs in most years; complex rule for inserting
intercalary SOLs 97 times in 400 ANOs.  ANO divided into 12
"months" of varying but roughly equal numbers of SOLs, each month
named; SOLs start count from 1 each month.  Dates written "month
d, yyyy"; month is name of month, d is day within month, yyyy is
year.  Month names in order from start of year: January,
=46ebruary, March, April, May, June, July, August, September,
October, November, December.  January 1, 0001 is date held to be
traditional date of religious initiation of significant religious
figure on Terra.

Zhodani dating system: (AM4)
SOL =3D 27.02 hours, subdivisions probable but not documented.
ANO =3D 244.44 SOLs.  Divided into six "seasons", each 40 SOLs
long.  Each SOL in season named, also numbered.  Four SOLs not
part of season, individually named. ANOs grouped by three (called
"olympiad"); intercalary day inserted every third olympiad.
Dates written as "oooo.y season dd"; oooo is olympiad number; y
is year number within olympiad; season is name of season; dd is
number of day within season.  Translated season names, from start
of ANO (named SOLs in ALL CAPS): SUNBRIGHT, Rain, MOON DAY, Heat,
SUNFLIGHT, Waning, Harvest, THANKSGIVING, Chill, Thaw.  In ANO 3
of each olympiad, OLYMPIAD DAY inserted between Chill and Thaw;
in ANO 3 of each third olympiad, DOUBLE OLYMPIAD DAY inserted
between OLYMPIAD DAY and Thaw.  Definite equivalent date given;
3471.1 Sunbright corresponds to Imperial 289-1112.

Aslan dating system: (AM1)
SOL =3D 36 hours; divisions: 1 SOL into 16 parts, each into 8
parts, each into 64 parts, each into 8 parts.
ANO =3D 212.2 SOLs, individually named; use sequential numbering.
Intercalary SOL added every 5 ANOs.  ANO 3644 corresponds to
Imperial year 1111, but no exact DAY/SOL correspondence given.
Written date format not given; recommend "yyyy (ddd)"; yyyy is
ANO number; ddd is SOL number within ANO.  ANO 1 SOL 1 date of
initiation of present Aslan governmental structure.

K\'kree Dating System: (AM2)
SOL =3D 28.6 hours; Divided into 4 "watches", Divided into 10
parts, each subdivided into 10 parts, each further subdivided
into 10 parts, and each divided into 10 parts.
ANO =3D 368 SOLs, ten parts of 37 SOLs, SOLs numbered sequentially
in part.  Part #4 only contains 35 SOLs.  ANO 7713 corresponds to
Imperial year 1110, but no DAY/SOL correspondence given.  No
written date format given; recommend "yyyy.p dd"; yyyy is ANO
number, p is part number, dd is SOL number in part.

Vargr Dating System: (AM3)
There being no single dominant polity among the Vargr, no
standard clock or calendar has been implemented.  Use Imperial
system, or local system to referee\'s liking.

Droyne Dating System: (AM5)
No information on Droyne timekeeping has been supplied.  Use
dominant system in area of Droyne encounters.

Hiver Dating System: (AM7)
SOL =3D approximately 30 hours, divided into 6 intervals.  Other
divisions said to exist, but are not detailed.
ANO =3D 143 SOLs, sequentially numbered from start of ANO.  Written
format "yyyy/ddd"; yyyy is ANO number; ddd is SOL number.
0001/001 is date of selection of capital of Hive Federation.
Hiver ANO 1401 corresponds to Imperial year 1111; no DAY/SOL
correspondence given.

Darrian Dating System: (AM8)
No information on Darrian timekeeping has been supplied.  As
Darrian culture is strongly influenced by Solomani culture, and
maintains cordial relations with the Imperium, either Solomani or
Imperial systems may be used.

NOTE: The two unknown sources were actually the same; I
distinctly recall seeing _something_ that had all of the
calendars laid out graphically, side by side, and provided useful
information about all of them.  My recollection says that it was
a GDW publication, for either CT or MT.  FWIW, the Solomani
system is just a continuation of our current system, which I
assume everyone knows the details of.

In Solomani & Aslan, page 7 "The Terran Star System" has the following:

Orbit		Name		UWP		Remarks
4		Mars		F43056a-F	Co Ml

Also, the book states this (page 5)

"Terraforming began to change the red face of arid Mars 700 years ago
[note - 4938 AD].  The planet\'s thickening atmosphere now sports a much
higher ratio of oxygen to carbon dioxide, and we hope to see actual rain
within the next century.  With the return of our Solomani citizens,
GenAssist has prmised to pseed completion of the terraforming effort."

All of that is in the Rebellion Era, around 1116-1118 I believe,

Didn\'t MT have a rules, or table that said that if your TL was 17+ 
you needed less Jump Fuel? I always assumed that was because of 
anti-matter power plants.

Isn\'t it that Vilani has no /t/?  The syllable generation table in _Vilani
and Vargr_ shows initial and final /d/ and /r/, but no /t/.

My thought is that the Vilani /r/ is a tap, rather than a trill, and placed
in a alveolar or retroflex position -- so to a native American English
speaker, it might sound more t-ish than not.  /d/ likewise, being
articulated farther back on the roof of the mouth than the Western European
/d/s, and more like the retroflex /d./ of South Asian languages.  Which
also means that some Solomani transcribers could well confuse the Vilani
/r/ and /d/ -- they\'re pretty similar in sound.

At the end of the Final War, Yaskodray (*the* Ancient) pinched off several
universes.  These were small, one or two parsecs across, and served as a
convinent hiding place for him as he watched the rest of us.

There was an adventure published (12; Secret of the Ancients) which took
the PCs to Yaskodray\'s home pocket.

Unless you a running a high power campaign, the characters won\'t ever have
access to a PU.  Almost no-one in the Imperium even imagines their existence.

>How can I use this "artifact" for an adventure?

See above.. I recommend avoiding them.  PUs are like the astral plane in
AD&D, too much power that unbalances the regular game.  Remember that
creating a pocket universe is about TL35 by all sources.

	There may be. I\'ve only received two phone calls, quite widely spread, and
made it clear each time I won\'t order anything sight-unseen. I won\'t even
shop in a game store which shrink-wraps its books. I insist on browsing
through anything and considering a wide variety of factors before buying.

	OK, one caveat--I did order the signed T4.1, just like I ordered the
signed T4 (which continues its attempts to self-destruct--I don\'t know if
it\'s the cover rejecting the contents, or vice-versa).

	"Pocket Universe"--The \'super-Droyne\' Grandfather, among his other
incomprehensible technologies, developed the ability to manipulate the very
fabric of space itself. Part of this was the ability to "pinch off" a
portion of our universe into its own separate bubble universe. Among other
things, he used this to create hiding holes for himself, some of his
equipment, and several worlds of Droyne who supported him in his quest to
kill his Grandchildren.

Why stop there?  Electronic paper!

Looks like paper, feels like paper, acts like paper.  When fed into the
proper machine can even
be erased and re-written!  What cannot be re-written is the triple
private key encryption (ala message above) stored in the micro-thin
computer in the center. The keys can be verified with
(again) the proper machine...

***************************************
Well, you\'ve messed up the calculations; a liter of H2 liquid is NOT the
same number of moles as a liter of water, liquid.

1 Mole H2 = 2g which is the molar equivalent of 1 Mole H2O = 18g
***************************************

Just to let you know that I\'m not completely hopeless--I just want to
explain that my calculations were not in error even if my approach to
solving the problem was.  knowing that 1 mole(H2O) = 18g I said, OK then
in 1 mole of (H2O) the is 2g of H,  which is why I said 2g(H)/mole for
water.  All this is neither here nor there....I guess its just in the
world view I would rather be guilty of a bit of sloppy thinking as
oppossed to looking like I don\'t how to turn atomic weights into g/mole
(which has to be one of the easiest calcs science has to offer :-})

***************************************
yes, H2O is a Mah-velous way to store H2. We can only presume that the
reason that H2 is standard vs H2O is that the \'fuel purification\'
process
produces lH2 at a very slow rate compared to the rate at which it needs
to
be dumped for the ship to jump.
***************************************

This is good to know and changes my way of thinking about fueling (I
held before that you could not leave your source while refining as X
amount of unrefined source would provide <X amount of refined product).
I was wrong and I thank everyone on the list who helped set me straight!

***************************************
Better yet, store the stuff as lNH3, liquid ammonia:

lNH3 = 1.5 Moles H2

1l NH3 = 0.68 g/ml * 1000 ml = 680 g/l / 17 g/Mole = 40 moles NH3 *1.5
moles H2 = 60 moles H2 / l NH3. The only drawback is that ammonia is a
corrosive material, but since we send thousands of tankloads of lNH3
around the country daily with few mishaps, it could be done.
***************************************

Would ammonia then tend to be the "source" that one would look for when
gas giant skimming or would straight hydrogen be the way to go....by
this I mean: would it be better to find an ammonia rich GG, get so many
tons of ammonia (knowing that this many tons of ammonia will refine to
just the right amount to fill your tanks), and then refine as you
procede to your jump point......OR.......Can you purify and liquify H2
fast enough during the skim (this is my thinking:  The H2 you will be
skimming is gas.....some of the volume of gas you skim will actualy be
impurities that you will vent overboard, reducing the amount of gas in
the ship.  You will then liquify the H2 which then takes up less space. 
So it seems that if you only fill your tanks with the bulk gas from the
GG and then start our for the jump point, your tanks will not even be
half full by the time you purify and liquify.)  The only "outs" I see in
this is if some dense storage medium (as water or ammonia) is skimmed
and refined on the way to jump point or if the purification machinery
can purify and liquify the whole load while remaining in the GG\'s
atmosphere.  If I am wrong in this too please correct me....I find this
really interesting.  Also, opinions on which method is used and its
consequences to gameplay

Thanks a heap!!!

What other science fiction universe is discussing this sort of thing in
detail?

So, if Baron Dinsha dies on 098-198 on Sylea and his wife dies on 098-198 on
Darkhamaar many many parsecs away, isn\'t it important for the probate court
to know who died first (even by a second) in order to determine inheritance?

If the Imperial proclamation giving Baron Dinsha authority to do something is
promulgated on 098-198 (I\'m in a rut here) and he does something within that
authority after that date, is it legal even if he hasn\'t received the
evidence of his authority (and he doesn\'t know he has that authority yet)?

Why add generic holidays like the infamous "Holiday No. 11" (or 3/4 day) when
they could be named and mean something? like Armed Forces Day, etc?

I object to a standard Religous Holiday. I think the religious calendar is a
separate consideration. If you instituted such a day, how many religions
would actually use it? Would Jews decide to celebrate passover on that day?
Probably not. Would Christians decide that Easter now fell on 181? Probably
not. What about Ramadan?  Probably not.

From a game standpoint, I am ignoring most of religion. From a government
standpoint, I think Cleon knows better than to open that bag of worms and
risk rejection of his calendar.

Looking at GDW\'s AM 5: Droyne, I find SS N of Dagudashag, and in SS J of
Massilia are Droyne worlds... Really close to the borders of M0 Imperial

I wondered that myself.

3. On the alien interaction table, it isn\'t listed which is telepath and
which is target.

4. There is no entry for READING a hiver\'s mind. Hivers are not psionic,

I cannot shake the mental image....  Imperial troops dug in, cautiously

When we were discussing the Grand Unified Conspiracy Theory <tm> a few

linked *exceedingly* powerful telepaths with instantaneous interstellar
communication.  The problem is, this was designed to be used by the

I can see an easier fix... nor more than two rolls per table per term.
Assuming you roll skills. (I require players to roll all but one of their
skill reciepts per term... that last one they may pick or roll). None of my
players have really concentrated their skill rolls on one particular table,
especially the Pers Dev.

The aging rules, too, can cause problems, as in 1.25 terms, you can gain 5
skills/atts, and lose up to 3 to 4 points. All the way out. And, at 35-39,
the aging save is 3+??? Really??? I think not steep enough for play
ballance. T4\'s aging rules, while providing good expected ages, need a cap
on how much you can per unit time per attribute and/or skill, not caps on
skill levels.

Now, by limiting to two rolls on pers dev per term, we get a max physical
gain of +2 per term (yes, I know, there are some bonuses available
elsewhere), or +2.5 per aging interval, and a max loss of 4 per aging
interval. Gee, lookit Arnold Swartzenegger....

In my humble opinion, strongly shaped by many afternoons hanging with the
priests, deacon-brothers, and brothers (My father was the permanent
diocesan deacon assigned to an otherwise Dominican parish) discussing
philosophy, religion, and the Catholic curch:

Catholocism will probably be around, with not the 22 rites of today, but
probably some 200+ rites. (See notes and terms, below) Each christian sect
that the church encounters, and has the same dogma (See terms, below) will
be invited so seek union. Usually, this results in a new rite within the
church, and a scism within said religion. Because of the difference of
rites, the church can be seen better (currently) as 22 diferent religions
with common dogma, all united under the Pope.

Just for reference here are the ranks within the church
Hierarchs:
        Pope
        Other Patriarchs
        Cardinal (including Cardinal, and Deacon-Cardinal)
        Arch Bishop/Metropolitan
        Bishop/Eparch
        Auxilary Bishop
Regular Clergy (Priesthood/Presbyterate):
        Monsignor/Archpriest/ProtoPresbyter
        Priest/Presbyter
Deaconate:
        Arch Deacon
        Deacon
        Sub-Deacon
Non-ordained Clergy
        Brothers, Sisters, Nuns, Lay Ministers

Not all rites use the all the ranks. Almost all the rites have both ranks
of the priesthood, and all rites use Bishop, Archbishop/Metropolitan.
Almost all rites have Deacons, many have Archdeacons and subdeacons; Note
that I refer to common useage; ALL priests have been Deacons (for at least
a few months) during the seminary, and most have been Sub-deacons. All
hierarchs are also Priests.

Many hierarchs have never served as lower ranked hierarchs; theynare almost
all priests before consideration; the few deacons who have been elevated to
the hierarchy have been ordained as priests during the elevation. In
theory, a layperson could be elected pope, they would be ordained then
installed. It hasn\'t happened in 1800+ years.

Roles of the Clergy:
Deacons: Assist the priesthood during the Divine Liturgy, Teach, and
sometimes Preach (depending upon rite, and the local bishop). Note that
Deacons are ordained to Read the gospels and be Euchaistic Ministers.
Deacons cannot lead the Divine Liturgy, nor hear confessions. They cannot
consecrate the Eucharist, but may lead Euchaistic services with previously
consecrated Eucharist.

Priests: Consecrate the Eucharist during the Divine Liturgy, Preach, Teach,
counsel, and administrate. Hear Confessions. Perform last rights.

Hierarchs: Administrate, and keep the parishes and dioceses they are
responsible for teaching the correct theology AND dogma.

Abbots, Priors, Abbesses, Prioresses, Mother General, Mother SUperior:
these are all titles for those who run an abbey, priory, nunnery, or
cloister, be it male or female population. Abbots and Priors are usually
priests, as well, but not always. They are the administrative and spiritual
leaders of these communities.

Vicar Genereral & Vicar: Someone acting for another; usually a priest
acting as the "1st officer" to a bishop or archbishop.

Some other Notes:
The two largest rites are the Roman and Byzantine Rites. Byzantine Rite
Catholocism is very very conservative, and looks to keep the ways of the
church (except for language in daily and weekly liturgies) as they have
been. Byzantine Catholocism has 24 recensions (ethnic sub-rites) which
share a common theology, set of liturgies, and liturgical musics, but
different languages and layouts.

Roman Catholocism is the one that is OFFICIALLY designated to be the rite
which will change to keep up with the times. Right now, this has caused
some problems, namely (Ex-)Archbishop Lefevbre and his followers. Rome is
still working on doing exactly what Lefevbre wanted: creating a new Rite
which adheres to the pre-vatican II expression of Roman Catholocism.

The church keeps on expanding, too: In the works at the Vatican, the
approval process is ongoing for 3 new rites. One is an African rite, which
will be tailored around the african expression (ne, recension) of Roman
Catholocism. The other two are for some of the groups working on Re-union
with Rome: Episcopalian and Lutheran Rites. These two, as Episcopalian and
Lutheran Priests, Parishes, and in at least one case a whole diocese,
trickle over to catholocism, they will be able to maintain their
theological and liturgical identities.

Age of the Catholic Church as a Whole. Catholics trace their religious
lineage of leadership back through St. Peter the Apostle, and through the
Apostles, to Judaism. Different rite have differing views on the "Old Law",
that of the old testament. Also, the early formations of what would become
the catholic church had Deacons, Priests, and Bishops as early as 100 AD,
based upon some roman historians, and records of the various sects.
Orthodoxy also traces it\'s roots back then. Many catholic historians and
theologians place the orthodoxy scism around 300 AD; the official
excomunications were around 1000 AD, by which point, the Byzantine rite had
been readmitted! Some really good historical ideas in church histories,
excellent for fantasy settings, and even useable in traveller.

In traveller, some suggestions:

Most Rites will have:
        1) Married Priests (Most rites do now... Only 2, including the romans,
                do not)
        2) Married Deacons (All current rites have married deacons)
        3) Females in the Priesthood and Deaconate
        4) VERY conservative outlooks on Right vs Wrong. The 10 Commandments
                are in the Bible.
Many Rites will have Some female hierarchs; I think that, in another 3000
years, we may see an Acknowledged female pope. We might also see some
maried Hierarchs.

Each planet with a catholic presence will tend to have one rite present,
some will have 2, or (Rarely) 3 or more. Each such planet will have a
"Nuncio", who is the papal representative, and most with significant
populations will have a cardinal (but he goes to Rome)

Most rites currently present or in the works will be present amongst the
stars, and will have a patriarch as their head. Small rites (1 planet or
smaller) will have an Archbishop as their head. Cardinals don\'t run
things... they go to rome. Most rite with a patriarch will also have a
cardinal or two, or more, depending upon size and influence. Most off-earth
rites will have the patriarch roughly in the center of their rite\'s
strongest areas.

Many rites will have a Senior Archbishop for a given world, and then normal
structure there-down.

Normally, a Bishop has a small city and it\'s surrounds, and this is called
a Diocese; An arch-bishop has a diocese of his own AND had "feudal vassal"
dioceses under him. Auxillary Bishops are assigned to run sections of large
diocese, or to function as administrators, and the ready replacement for
the Bishop.

Any worlds cut off from contact with rome will appoint a Synod of Bishops,
and eventually a Patriarch... So, early in M0, the Patriarch of Sylea (and
the Sylean Rite) should be looking for other worlds to reunite with.
Patriarchs for Ecumenical Councils. These EC\'s can do almost anything the
pope can do. They can do almost anything the college of cardinals can do,
except elect a pope. Some would elect a "demi-pope",

Religious profiles should be done by RITE or Order, not for the whole
shebang, because each can be quite varied. Here are some Guidelines,
though:
        God View: 4-8, with individuals rangine 3-9. If dualist, then the
        second, evil deity is Satan. If Rational Poly Theists, they will be
        generally an ignorant society, converted recently, or backsliders

        Spiritual aim: 6-7, with some persons at 1

        Devotion Required: 6 (weekly), although technically, to be catholic
        it is only 12 (annually) as a minimum.

        Organizational Structure: 1-4, although some groups will technically
        be in the range of 0-8, depending on contact with rome and local
        factors

        Liturgical Formality: Most will be 6-8, with wome groups being in
        the 3-10 range

        Missionary Fervor: 3,6,9, or A. A Theologian, in response to a Traveller
        inspired question (an Aslan wanting to convert!) wrote to rome with the
        following question:
                Dou you have to be human to be a member of the Catholic Church?
        and got the following response:
                "...you must be a Reasoning, Intelligent being, capable of
                understanding the Sacraments.
                "Why do you ask?"
                [signed]"John Paul II"
        [from a letter from Pope John Paul II to Fr. John Fearon, OP. quoted
        from memory. Fr. John showed this to myself and the player who had
        origionally asked the question, who just happened to be Jewish. Fr.
John
        though it was an "Interesting Question, deserving of an answer."]
        Certain groups, however, would fall into the 4 or 7 ranges (tolerant of
        some other races).

        Number of Adherants: Varies, but any rite would be at least code 4
        (tens of thousands) and most recensions (ethnic sub-rites) would be
code
        4. Some rites could get as high as code C (trillions), and in M1100,
        I suspect the Roman and Byzantine Rites would push the C Scale.

As for Recognizability, Most Byzantines would probably recognize the
Byzantine Rite of the 4000\'s to 5000\'s, as the Byzantines are fixated on
preserving the rite as it has been.  Most Romans would probably NOT
recognize the Roman Rite of the Imperial Era, but would recognize that it
is similar.


Also, Don\'t expect to see too many Roman Catholics in the Marches... I
figure that we\'ll see Lutheran Catholics (Sword Worlds), and probably
Denebian and Moran Rite catholics. I figure that there will also be a few
others around, and, wherever there are catholics, there go 5 orders as
well:
Dominicans      (OP)    Order of Preachers
Jesuits         (SJ)    Society of Jesus
Fransican       (OFM)   Order of Friars Minor &
                (SSSF)  School Sister of St. Francis
                (PC)    Poor Clairs founded by St. Francis
Holy Cross      (CSC)   Congregatio Sacta Cruces
Benedictine     (OSB)   Oder of St. Benedict
