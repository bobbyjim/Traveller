   Let it be known that Dave and Guy will be held blameless if it comes
out looking like MegaErrata (MegaTraveller to some).  Even if they
turned something in to IG that looks like it was generated by a 6 year
old with a box of crayons and a black marker, it is up to IG to do the
final editing and determine if something is ready to be taken to the
printers.

   This is beginning to sound like the starship design system debacle in
the main T4 sourcebook.  God I hope not.  My prayers are with both Dave
and Guy.

   My order would be as follows:

3) An officially licensed publication other than GDW says so (later
versions taking precendence over older ones).

4) An author published by GDW says so (precedence given to actual GDW
employees).

5) An author published in an officially licensed resource says so.

6) A concensus of a Traveller fan organization (i.e. HIWG) says so.

7) A concensus of an Internet mailing list (i.e. TML) says so.

8) An unofficial (or declared unofficial by GDW) publication says so.

9) Rumor has it at the local gamestore...

   I did not put T4 into this list because Marc Miller is currently
rewriting it, thus the current set of books could end up being a

Waitaminit Andrew, when you posted your question you asked for the
*maximum* TL achieved by the RoM, not the average. The average TL would be
completely different from the average of suggested maximums.

And if this is the way you decide what the TL should be what\'s to stop
certain people from voting for a TL of 33 to get an "average" of 15?

Yes indeedy!  A very knotty problem, and likely to cause many hordes 
of lawyers to bill many hours and kill many trees.   However, unless 
the Baron is dumb as a post, a good will should dispense witj most of

I would say yes -- the action is in fact authorized by the proper 
authority, even if the person is not aware of that fact.   
Authorization is the key, not knowledge, IMO.

Dr. Clark,

   J.P. asked me to relay a post.

   J.P. considers it an anomaly that western culture is so myopic in its
worldview.  (I am not surprised in any way, shape or form.)  While trade
slowed in the Med during the period you mentioned, the Southern Sung were
trading with India, West Africa, Indonesia, and quite probably Northwest
Australia.  At the same time, accounts in Chinese literature give reference
to voyages to the West coast of North America (no archaeological proof here).
It doesn\'t sound to me like long distance trade on the planet was curtailed
in the period under discussion.

Good point that technology creates new demands.

It\'s a good vision, but it will be somewhat blurred by other factors: 
for instance, my hypothetical banana republic at TL6/7 would be 
offering serious tax breaks to industrial concerns to relocate to my 
world, controlling high tech imports (just for the elite) and 
brutally repressing the peasants a bit.  I\'d either gain TL as 
companies flocked cautiously to the world, without a ceiling, or 
remain isolationist in order to improve my control over the masses -- 
adding some feudal technocracy to my non-charismatic dictatorship, as 
it were.

There\'s also the question of who the TL8/9 worlds trade with, if most 
of their neighbours are of similar TL.  They too would press for 
worlds 2-3 TLs lower to export *their* goods to, partly offsetting 
the cost of high TL imports.  The political pressure would be 
immense, in many cases.

I suppose what I\'m saying is that a "trickle-down" trade 11 to 9 to 7 
to 5 allows more people to benefit from trade.  The high tech gain 
because they don\'t need to invest so deeply (and make the starships 
by which trade operates), the mid tech can offset the cost of high 
tech by importing resources cheaply from low TL planets, and low TL 
planets can afford to buy from mid TL more cheaply than from high TL.

Pre-Industrial TLs would be a prime taget for improvement always.

Except once we have the technology we can compete in some areas: 
software, for instance, or entertainment (using the high TL media).  
But broadly agreed.

I think they\'d be keener to cap the TL at 8 or 9 than make sure 
everyone was at TL 8 or 9, especially in the later years of 
stagnation.  The Vilani were aware of the effect of "subject" races 
without inhibitions on scientific research getting their hands on 
high TL gear -- they kept J2 a military secret for many years as a 
result -- and would have acted to minimise TL advancement outside the 
old regions of Vland.

One thing you might consider is some modification of this based on 
likely trade routes.  If two worlds are on a jump-1 main, they will 
have very good reason to trade directly.  If one world is low-TL and 
a jump-1 main bypasses it, there will be much less incentive to 
cultivate that world.

I\'d entirely agree that a couple of TLs is enough difference.

I imagine trade sanctions keep the treat of "nationalising" this

Points well made and taken; in broad, as you say, I agree.

I suspect a mixture of TLs, partly for political reasons, partly for 
economic ones.

And of course the Long Night would throw major spanners into the 
works, and the 3I was more technocratic, so worlds had major 
advantages in spending money on research rather than developing 
markets.

seems like a good idea, but unless you are hell bent on extracting some
raw materials from them (which the higher levels of Traveller tech make
rather silly given fusion and such), they just will not have the money to
buy the stuff you are making.

  For examples, take a look at the trade patterns of any large
industrialized country today (Europe, North America, Japan).  The majority
of their trade, both import and export, is with other industrialized
nations, not the third world.

  Now, what this means for Traveller tech levels, I haven\'t a clue, but I
think most folks would agree that Traveller tech level variations between
planets is one of the odder things about the game.  Must be some
explanation other than economics, esp. for M1100.  Perhaps resource
exhaustion, but with fusion recycling is so much easier than flying to
another system in an expensive starship and buying new ingredients.

Presumably no one in the 3rd Imperium would bat an eye. First of all, they
may not even realize that the \'Andorites\' of Andor are the same species as
the \'Fliegers\' of Fliegerwelt and the Droyne of [some Droyne world somewhere
else]. If they did, they would  just assume that these had been moved around 
during the Siru Zirka or the RoM and simply lost their jump drive technology 
later. Once they found out that these aliens had lived on their planets for 
300 to 400,000 years, they would assume that they had been scattered by the 
Ancients just as humans had been (and I bet there are one or two other alien 
races that have been relocated by individual Ancients (plus a few more 
gengineering experiments (in my universe there is a species derived from
otters on a world in Urnian))).

What makes the scientific community conclude that the Droyne are a major race 
is the discovery that identical coyn sets appear on a number of different 
Droyne worlds simultaneously around -75,000. The conclusion is that one 
Droyne culture invented jump drive, spread the coyns, and then lost the jump 
technology again later. There are some problems with that theory (mainly 
because it isn\'t true), but that\'s the best explanation anyone can come up 
with (The truth is far to far-fetched to even be suspected, much less 
credited; remember that most of what we, the Traveller players and referees 
know about the Ancients is unknown to the people of Xharted Space  -  in 1110 
the theory that the Droyne and the Ancients are the same is just beginning to 
percolate through the scientific community Behind the Claw).

Btw. according to an article by Marc Miller in an issue of _Different Worlds_
the discovery that Droyne are a major race is made in 790.

anyone.

The trends in religion are towards more prescriptive and more 
inclusive styles: "fundamentalist" religions become more rigid if 
anything and "liberal" ones much less so.

In Christianity the effect is to slow the pace of change in the Roman 
Catholic church to almost zero (in the opinion of friends who are RC) 
and make evangelical/charismatic groups very conservative within 
their core beliefs.  This is often held to be a reaction to the 
changing and frightening world (rather patronisingly, sometimes).

Liberal or syncretist elements are increasingly less rigid and less 
effective, and many are moving towards Humanism.  I ascribe this to 
the fact that Humanism\'s ethical basis in the West is derived from 
Christianity, and has developed the logical implications of it far 
beyond what the churches would countenance.  This is not to say that 
Humanism\'s ethical take is better, just that it is the driving force 
behind the modification of modern ethics.  To take a recent debate in 
the UK, gay elements in the Anglican (Episcopalian) church have 
borrowed their ethical standpoint from Humanism, while the opposing 
traditionalist/fundamentalist lobby employ a more prescriptive 
reading of the Bible and tradition.

Similar divisions exist in other major religions, including Judaism 
(orthodox/reform) and Islam ("We\'re not all terrorists"/"We should 
be militant"), and I think the process of division is a fundamental 
one.

In Traveller then, what will we have?  A few crackpot sects, for 
sure, but presumably some faiths which aren\'t so ludicrous.  Given 
the proliferation of some ethical values throughout the Imperium, one 
could assume a kind of "background" religion, which is:

o There may or may not be a God (probably only one if any)
o Good and evil are not always relative terms
o There are certain activities (slavery, murder) which are always 
  unacceptable and wrong

This would represent the default ethical position of an Imperial 
citizen (and coincidentally a late 20th century Brit), but have 
limited force in modifying behaviour.  Note the similarity between 
what the Imperium condemns in law and what Western Europe condemns... 
it\'s canon 8-)

Liberals would hold stronger beliefs (or lack of them!) along similar 
lines, usually quite general ones like "good relationships are 
fundamental to human life"; they would be more keen on applying them 
than the average citizen.

Fundamentalists could hold almost any belief, with strong adherence, 
and could be seen to violate "standard" conceptions of right and 
wrong.

	Not neccessarily.  People have this habit of finding strange and
unusual ways of dying in circumstances that beggar belief and really
complicate things for their legal representatives and cause endless
hilarity to law students (ask me about _Trans-Quebec Helicopters_ v. _Heirs
of Lee_ or Hydro-Quebec_ v. _Girouard_ sometime).  So, the civil law (I
dunno about the common law, but I\'d be surprised if it didn\'t have a
similar rule) came up with a rule that if two people died in such a way as
to make it impossible to determine who died first, they\'re deemed to have
died on the same date.  It\'s at art.616 para. 1 for those of you with
copies of the Civil Code of Quebec.

	This of course is assuming that for some insane reason the good
Baron died intestate.  I know zip-all about Imperial tax law, but here on
Earth your average High Net Worth Individual generally has an estate plan
done up so tight that it can not only handle, but even derive tax benefits
from, an alien abduction.

	Given the dating uncertainty inherent in life in the Imperium, I\'d
suspect that there\'d just be a rule that barring evidence that local
versions of Imperial time are badly out of sync, the Imperial time and date
of death is deemed to be the time of death for successions purposes.

	Not perfect, but it would keep the poor SOB\'s at the Office of
Calendar Compliance from being ritually humiliated during cross-examination
too often :).

	Hm.  Interesting.  Depends on what exactly was being proclaimed?
Just going on gut feelings, if it were empowering him to attack the Zhodani
or something like that and he didn\'t wait for it, I suspect he\'d be in
trouble.  But if it were just regular legislation, I imagine that action in
accordance with it would be OK if it were after the date it came into
force...

	Acting outside of one\'s powers without knowledge that one is
empowered to do so strikes me as being the kind of thing a well-run
Imperium would seek to prevent.

Well, once again the TML has judged a product in 10 or so messages prior to
anyone on the list actually receiving said product.

I hope I\'m not dangling flame bait by politely suggesting we wait until
someone has the item in hand prior to reviewing it.  With all due respect
to the playtesters who were not allowed enough time, even they did not
*see* the final product.

I also want to point out that with the designers actually being on the
list, the feedback-errata loop will be very short.

You\'ve made a few errors here, as far as I can see.

You split water in hydrogen and oxygen by electrolysis.

Using decade-old A level chemistry I worked out the
following -

One Faraday is equivalent to 96487 Joules. If we are =

disassociating H2O by electrolysis, then one Faraday =

deposits one mole of Hydrogen at the  electrode. =

This means that 3,600,000,000 Joules ( 1 MJ per second =

i.e. one MW, for one hour ) evolves =

3,600,000,000 / 96487 =3D 37310.7 moles
of Hydrogen. Using 1.008 grams for a =

molar weight of H we get 37609.2 =

grams of Hydrogen. This is 0.537 m3 of Liquid =

Hydrogen per MW per hour.

Since Hydrogen accounts for 1/9th of water by mass, =

this 37609.2 grams must account for 1/9th of the =

input water. Thus we had 338482.8 grams or say =

338.5 kg of water to start with. That\'s 0.338 m3.

So to process 1 m3 ( 1000kg  ) of water requires =

1 MW for 2.95 hours and evolves 1.586 m3 of Liquid =

Hydrogen massing 111.11 kg ( i.e. 1000/9 ) and 888.8
kg of Liquid Oxygen with a volume of =

0.778 m3 for a total volume of 2.36 m3 of products.

> In an hour a 1 MW powerplant produces 3600 MJ =3D
> 8500 mol (say) =3D 8.5 tonnes of H2.

No way ! 8500 moles of Hydrogen is not 8.5 tonnes. =

1 mole of Hydrogen is 1.008 g, so it\'s
about 8.5 kg. But this figure is wrong anyway, =

so it doesn\'t matter :-)

> The FF&S draft gives 0.01 MW to purify 1 m^3 LH2 in 6 hours at TL8. =


0.01 MW for 6 hours is 0.01 x 6 x 3,600,000,000 =

Joules. That\'s 216,000,000 Joules total. This is equivalent to =

2238.6 mol of Hydrogen, or 2256.6 grams. This is about  =

0.03 m3 of Liquid Hydrogen, substantially
less than FF&S.

Is this correct ? Can FF&S ][ be so wrong ? If so, I will think long
and hard before buying it.

> I would calculate that as 0.01 * 6 * 8.5 tonnes =3D 0.51 tonnes =3D 7

Again, your 8.5 tonnes figure is incorrect. It should be 8.5 kg =

by your calculations. This renders this calculation meaningless.

The most comprehensive reference I\'ve found is a Library Data entry in the
_Beltstrike_ boxed module:

"SHIONTHY (Regina 0706 X-)))742-8): The large belt dominating this system is 
believed by many authorities to be the result of the destruction of a large
world by the Ancients. The presence of quantities of anti-matter in the belt
suggests a mechanism. Because of the anti-matter, Shionthy Belt is dangerous
to enter (the explosion resulting from contact with even a microscopic
particle can cause severe damage) and has been interdicted by the Imperium.
Before interdiction, Shionthy had already acquired a population of belters
searching for fragments of anti-matter, worth several million credits per
gram. Imperial law allows established populations to remain in a system
after interdiction and, despite periodic disasters  --  in addition to the
dangers of anti-matter, asteroids occasionally collide with each other in
this young belt  --  the population has grown. The inhabitants sell their
finds to the Imperium, which, despite the humanitarian concerns which led to
interdiction, finds the present arrangement too valuable to abandon."

_Secret of the Ancients_ has a map room in an Ancient base showing a planet
in the Shionthy system where the belt is now. There is a referee\'s note
stating: "Based on this evidence, it is logical to conclude (correctly)
that Shionthy was converted to an asteroid belt during the Final War."

I thought I had caught you out here, but it seems not. _SotA_ speaks of three 
star systems previously located in hexes 0507, 0606, and 0707 in Regina 
Subsector that was pinched off by Grandfather into his residental pocket 
universe, but upon checking I find that none of them were Eskaloyt, the
Droyne homeworld. One of the systems were given to the Droyne faction that 
had supported Grandfather, but that dosen\'t mean that it was Eskaloyt. So 
Eskaloyt was another planet in the Shionthy System than the one that was 
destroyed and was tilted into a different pocket universe than Grandfather\'s 
Pad, is that right? Interesting. I\'ve always thought that Eskaloyt was either
destroyed or identical to Andor.

Not to normal iron & steel.  Sure, copper (as used in power and control 
cables) gets corroded as do a few other materials, but I would not 
describe ammonia as corrosive.

Mind you, I might describe ammonia as "corrosive" to humans (particularly if 
inhaled), which is may be what you are thinking off.

Liquid Ammonia (LAM, perhaps) can be conveniently stored at around -33 C at 
atmospheric pressure.

(I used to designed ammonia plants for a living)


I used to favoured ammonia as a storage mechanism for hydrogen - M-drives 
use the hydrogen as fusion fuel, the nitrogen as reaction mass (along with 
lots of other ammonia).

These days, if I start playing Traveller again, I would probably postulate a 
synthetic-zeolite storage medium.   Apparantly, in R&D on hydrogen-powered 
cars, you can store more hydrogen in tank filled with activated carbon than 
in an empty tank (well, empty except for the hydrogen!).  This is to do with 
hydrogen absorbing strongly on the carbon so that the atom density is higher 
than a high pressure gas can give you.  If we also take in some of the "cold 
fusion" theory about hydrogen absorbing strongly onto Palladium elctrodes, 
we could postulate a suitable lightweight material that can absorb hydrogen 
strongly.

I know traveller "canon" refers to L-Hyd, but I have yet to be convinced of 
the wisdom and practicallity of storing hydrogen at a few dergees above 
absolute zero on a starship.  I have never let that stop me from using L-Hyd 
as the strage mechanism in all of the Traveller games I\'ve been involved in 
.. most PCs see it like refueling at the gas station and seldom give it a 
second thought until they want a nasty way to deal with hijackers ("I flood 
the passenger deck with L-Hyd").

You\'d probably vent it to space. There\'s enough oxygen on board 
already. The problem with breathing recycled air has more to do
with getting rid of carbon dioxide than with replenishing used
oxygen.

B gets one hex (based on some world selection process). That hex generates an
income.
C gets a barony (of several) hexes and an income from those hexes.
D+ gets an override from knights and baronies under him/her.

I\'d like input on 

1. How much income does a hex produce to a noble? Cr1 per sq km? Cr10 per sq
km?

2. Can that income be enhanced by development, etc? How?

3. How many hexes do other nobles get?

I envision many land grants being given to nobles on worlds well beyond the
Imperial borders, and the noble needing to go to that grant and survey it (or
have someone survey it). Until surveyed, the land produces no income; once
surveyed (and developed) etc.

Ideas. Thoughts. Comments?

I would say Baron Dinsha would be doing very little after that date,
except being buried of course :)

But seriously, I agree that it\'s legal, but is it a wise thing to do?
He would be acting on the assumption that he will be getting that authority,
I think thats a very dangerous assumption to make.

For example Baron Dinsha is waiting for the Emperor\'s permission to colonise
a new planet (or whatever), he sends a message asking for the Emperors 
permission that he knows will arrive on a certain date. The baron assumes
that he will gain the Emperors permissions and so starts his colonisation
a few days after the Emperor received the message. 
Legal? yes. 
Wise? Well, what if the Emperor finds out about the what the baron did,
I wouldn\'t be happy if I was emperor and a lowly baron had the nerve to
assume that I would give him permission.

Hmmmm, sounds like a good plot to me, the PC\'s could be sent with the message 
to the Emperor (or another powerful noble) and then sent back with a reply.
The 
Emperor then finds out about the Barons actions and decides to take action 
against him, but the real reason the Baron wanted to move so quickly was to 
provide food for the starving population of a nearby planet.
A squadron of navy cruisers complete with a detachment of marines arrive to 
remove the baron and the other "illegal" trespassers. Will the PC\'s fight,
surrender or even try and convince the Marine commander that the baron is 
right? 

I\'m off to write this down somewhere.........

3 (Earth) orbit their star(s) in 365 days (rounding off) while those in orbit
1 (Mercury) orbit their star(s) in 88 days (if my memory is still working).

Why am I concerned about this? Well, I like to add a bit of seasonal variance
in climate (weather hazards) whenever possible. If this is already covered in
a previously released book, please forgive me. It\'s not in any that I own.

which is actually a web page with instructions and an archive
of the material. I skimmed a couple months of postings yesterday 
and was amused at the topics they were discussing...

 - how exactly does the handwaving interstellar drive work?
 - say, couldn\'t you just drop a big rock real fast on a planet
    instead of using expensive troops, bombs, etc?
 - say, how do those damn maneuver drives work without reaction mass?

etc, etc. Luckily for them were only ever a handful of Star Frontiers
books published (and I think I have most of them, oddly enough...) so
they don\'t get to enjoy long debates on what is and isn\'t "canon".

Anyways, the only other item of note was the presence of one 
Pierre Savoie (did I spell that right?) who may be familiar to
readers of rec.games.frp.misc, but I don\'t think I\'ll get into
that...

Anyways, kind of interesting, but of course, Traveller is way

But GDW\'s AM 5 is set in 1100. Were those worlds Droyne worlds in Year
0, or were they colonized later?

Or maybe those worlds in M:0 were filled with Chirpers who received
coyns and casted later?

Or maybe no one bothered to check who\'s living on those worlds, or even
realized that Droyne were anything more than a minor race?

Or they didn\'t even realize the Dagudashag Droyne and the Massilia
Droyne were the same species?

That\'s a good one. I\'m sure that most, if not all, races have their own
"Contact Day" celebrations.

The Vilani could well have a holiday celebrating the founding of Ziru
Sirka. I\'m sure they\'d rather forget the Ramshackle Empire.

I bet many Vilani at the founding of the "Third" Imperium, actually call
it the "Second". Ultra-orthadox Vilani don\'t recognize it as being a
successor to the First at all.

The Vilani, being on the whole a traditional lot, may have many holidays
of varying importance. Maybe every day is some holiday or day of
reflection upon some aspect of Vilani tradition. On most, work goes on
as usual. Some holidays are specific to a particular trade or social
class. Each individual may have personal days of celebration and
reflection.

Galanglic translation often omits the word "day", or prefixes the word
with "day of". In the Vilani language either an affix or a tone denotes
whether the word refers to the day or the concept. Here are some of the
most important Vilani holidays, in roughly decending order of
importance:

General Holidays (Celebrated by Most)

(Day of) Founding - One of the most important Vilani holidays,
Celebrating the founding of the Bureaux.

Contact - The day upon which Vilani reflect upon the awe and wonder of
discovering that they are not alone.

Shugili - A day of reflection and comemmoration of the most influential
class of workers, without whom the Vilani people would have surely
perished.

Memorial - A day of remembrance of those who gave their lives for the
good of the Vilani people. Perhaps each war has its day of remembrance.

Ziru Sirka - The founding of the first interstellar empire is an
important source of cultural pride.

Gods\' Death - The actual day is lost in antiquity, but the
tradition-minded Vilani are sure to comemmorate the day upon which the
machines which menaced early Vilani finally ground to a halt.


Trade Specific (Celebrated by a Trade)

First Worker - Celebrates the mythical or semi-mythical first
practitioner of the trade.

Many other holidays celebrating important people or events in the
practice of the trade. (A "Jump Day" might fall here for the Engineering
profession)


Personal Holidays (Celebrated by the Individual, and his circle of
friends and relatives)

Vocation - More important than any other day in a Vilani\'s life is the
day s/he chose a Vocation, the lifelong commitment to a trade.

Birthday - (Why not?)

Other various day celebrating Parents, Children, Ancestors (in general),
specific famous Ancestors, the Family, etc.

The clever bastard Norris did just that when dubbing himself archduke

between and Norris simply igored the error.

I calculate the length of the year for each planet/moon (act tually my
HyperCard stack does it for me - Mac users wanting it can drop me a line).
Then I calculate the planetary positions based on Year 1000 with a random
0-360 degrees added and noted to give each planet a consistent year. I
generally calculate planetary positions not for seasons but for travel time
and tactical considerations during intrasystem travel.

Referees new to this should bear in mind that while being realistic it
takes away some plotline freedom (Jung managed to flee in an old chemical
rocket OTV as the planets at the time were in perfect Hohmann positions).
The advantage is that it gives more realsim and continuity to Traveller and
by adding constraints to me (the ref) it actually adds plotline hooks (the
PCs enter a system and find that most planets line up towards the sun - The
ref starts spinning on Doomsayers cults running rampant on the world
hindering starport traffic etc).

In your example you imply that knights (soc = 11) get income. I don\'t
think this is the case. Are knights awarded fiefdoms?

In the old Trillion Credit Squadron book there were rules on calculating
the tax revenue generated by a planet. Unfortunately I\'m at work 
(and, strangely enough, don\'t have my Traveller stuff here). I remember
that the revenue came down to a simple formula. I\'ve always thought
that system was elegant.

I suggest implementing a similar system. How about a formula like this:

    Annual Income Per Hex = size x hydro x pop x gov x TL x (soc - 11)

where the first five variables are from the UWP and soc is the noble\'s
social standing.

For example, if I\'m a Baron (SS = 12) on a world with UWP A867987-8, my
annual income amounts to Cr32,256.

Here is my logic, strange as it may seem.

Size, hydro and pop are variables because they directly affect the 
population density, which must affect revenue generated for a hex.
Tech Level is there because higher TL worlds should generate more
revenue per hex than lower ones would.

Government is present because, arguably, lower governments have less of
a "need" for nobles and will be less inclined to pay for one. I find
it easier to believe that a charismatic dictatorship would pay for a
noble (maybe just to pay him to never visit and to mind his own 
business) than a company/corporation.

Social standing is a factor so that higher level nobles get more money.

I\'m sure there is room for improvement in this formula, so my TL15
fireproof Battle Dress is on now.

> 2. Can that income be enhanced by development, etc? How?
> 

The TL factor included in the above formula takes this into account.

> 3. How many hexes do other nobles get?
> 

How about:

	B doesn\'t get hexes because knights, ASAIK, don\'t get fiefdoms.
	C gets one hex.
	D gets 10 hexes.
	E gets 100 hexes.
	F gets 1000 hexes.

Excellent idea. To extend this further: once surveyed, the land may
still not generate revenue. If it is unpopulated, it must be developed
first. If it is populated, there should be a chance that force may 
be necessary to convince the local population that they need a noble.

Thanks for the info Volker, but to save a little bandwidth, the item goes
for 250 German Marks, which, using an exchange rate of 1.79 (last time I
checked) gives USD $447.50.

It is also important to note that, unless you are attending GenCon, they
will not ship outside Europe.  There is a note that, since they will be at
GenCon, a deal can be made to meet up there.  I suppose anyone willing to
spend $450 on a game supplement would be going to GenCon...or would spend
the extra $220 or so for an airline ticket.

That said, the book contains all the alien modules from Classic Traveller
(8 in all) plus Alien Realms.  Each is about $12 cover and more like
$20-$30 for the rare ones, so if you got them all the \'hard way\' you\'d
likely  pay well over $150 USD or so after much searching, if you could
find them all.

Actually, that\'s true, but there\'s more to it than that. Observe the
following quote from MT library data on the Sword Worlds:


"In peacetime, the Confederation government maintains a pool of high
ranking military officers (selected from the military forces of all
member worlds) who are trained in large unit command and staff
operations. 


"During time of war, all military forces are confederalized and placed
under a single unified command. For ground forces, divisions will be
commanded by generals from the individual worlds, corps, and higher
organisations by Confederation officers. The component forces of a
division will be from the same world whenever possible. For naval
forces, individual ships are under the command of local officers,
squadrons and fleets by Confederation officers."


The Sword Worlds military is separate and yet unified. Disunity would
be even less of a problem in the New Era. The only remaining "free"
Sword Worlds in 1202 are those who were members of the Narsil-dominated
state. While disunity may not be a problem, however, resources and
diminished military strength will be. Thus, any attempt at liberating
their occupied comrades will best be accomplished by guerilla tactics.
That doesn\'t mean, however, that some degree of conventional war won\'t
be used.

An email to <TravLang@earth.execnet.com> with "subscribe TravLang <your

much nonexistent these days.  I\'ll try and post an updated sketch of Vilani

	Thank you Mark, I was just getting ready to make precisely this 
point.  U.S. trading partners in order of volume are Europe, Canada, 
Japan, and Mexico.  Note that the first three are all the same TL as the 
U.S.  While standard economic texts describe the engine of trade to be 
"comparative advantage" (I grow cheap rice you grow cheap corn, let\'s 
swap) in the modern world this is often not the case.  Germany, U.S., and 
Japan are all wealthy industrialized nations and as such they all produce 
cars.  By the logic of comparative advantage, they have no reason to 
trade.  But in fact the trade in automobiles between these three nations 
is quite brisk.
	If you want to look at the _growth_ in trade, then developing 
countries definitely jump to the top of the list.  But that growth come 
precisely because their economies are rapidly growing as they catch up in 
levels of technology and infrastructure.

	If TL means the TL of locally produced goods, then it may be that 
the world has no reason to invest in higher tech production because of 
the ease with which it can import high tech goods from elsewhere?  Maybe 
some worlds stay backwaters because all their best and brightest leave 
for the high-tech worlds, the resulting brain-drain leaving the 
homeworld ill-prepared for serious TL advance?  Most likely its just an 
artifact of the world generation system.  In any case, its not nearly as 
bad as the hi-pop hell-hole adjacent to the low-pop garden world problem.

*grin* OK, amend that to simply "Marc speaking ex cathedra."  As this was

It\'s not neccesarily odd, if you see the Imperium as a governing body with
only very loose control over the "territory" it lays claim to, and if you
keep the parrallel between the Imperium and European Empires of the 17th,
18th and 19th century, then technological disparity becomes an issue of
logistics and control. The Imperium has enough on its hands to try and keep
a reliable and regular communications route (and then only along the main
lines of travel), enforce the peace in interstellar space (and then only in
the most serious and important circumstances), maintain a presence on key
worlds, and continue the exploration and cataloging of "what\'s out there."
Technology transfer is neither high on its list of priorities nor
neccesarily in its best interests. The level of involvement and connection
each world has to the interstellar community is highly variable, and as a
result, their technological development is also widely divergent.

Not everybody wants to "catch up." Surely there are plenty of cultures
which would just rather "tune-out."

World Tamer\'s Handbook (GDW, for TNE) has some good rules about improvement
and land values for production. (mine is buried at the moment, but if my
FLGS is any clue, there should be some copies lying about.

That said, I run (in M1100) that most fiefs are in the extrality zones, and
that 1/3rd of income gets passed up to one\'s immediate lord. Barons and
Viscounts who have high volume starports  in their fiefs can make QUITE a
killing. more opn that when the M1100 setup starts, or I get demands for
more.

Problems like this can pop up today. The church where I went as a kid,
is about 300 yrs old.  There is a debate going, on when did the church
actually start.  The church is in Connecticut in the US, which used to
be an English colony, so the church needed permission from the King of
England to start up. Did it start
when they asked for a charter, when the king granted the charter, or
when the church got the charter.  

The only reason this is actually being debated is because they wanted
to know when to start the birthday celebration, in the end they
compromised and are going to have a three year long celebration to
cover all possible dates. :)

From what I remember in a university course, the church used to
allow priests to marry and have children. Then the families of
said priests began getting a little too powerful for the pope\'s
liking, since the priest\'s children would often become priests too.
So, one of the pope\'s simply declared that priests couldn\'t marry
and that ended the "problem".

I took that course several years ago and my memory may be faulty.
I just remember it because it was the first time that I ever thought
of the Catholic church as just another institution where internal
politics ended up dictating external actions.

If I offended any Catholics, it was purely unintentional. Feel free
to correct me if my memory is hooped.

The Star Frontiers FTL driver worked in this handwave manner:

1.  accelerate to 10% of the speed of light.
2.  engage drive. ("Enter \'The Void\'")
3.  decelerate into target system.

It\'s a \'true\' jump drive--near instantaneous travel, but requires about
a week of acceleration per LY or so.  The Void is the StarFrontiers
version of J-space--somewhat unpleasant to travel through (nasuea, et
al).

Star Frontiers didn\'t let much science get in the way.  Starships used
nuclear fission drives (that\'s right, fission) that \'burned\' fuel
pellets.  Larger ships used an entire pellet in a voyage, smaller ones
could make several jumps with the same about of fuel.

As for dropping rocks instead of using troops...

*SLAP SLAP SLAP SLAP SLAP*

That\'s for putting all of those poor United Planetary Force ground
troops, the arms manufacturers and the hypercort manufacturing industry
out of work.   Besides, the Sathar have a HUGE military budget to spend
too, and near-cee rocks are just too unglamorous a weapon to get
procured...

Finally, reaction mass??  Why, all of the reaction drives on the
frontier use those fancy Vrusk-Dralasite designed drives that uses
unobtainioum whiz-bang sprockets.  Yep, pour in whatever you
want--kerosene, H20, H2, He3, CH3CH2OH-- and watch that baby go.
Seriously, you could make Star Frontiers as gear head as you wanted to.
The blanks were not filled in.

Star Frontiers: Knight Hawks (the coolest name for a space combat
system, I still think) used 3 kinds of STL drives:  Chemical, Nuclear
and Ion.  Chemical drives need lotsa fuel, although it was never really
stated what.  Nuclear drives used something, I\'m sure, but again it was
never really stated beyond the "Fuel Pellets".  Ion drives were said to
be able to use just about anything that could be powdered (Mercury,
Carbon, bits of asteroid--seriously!!).

Ah and the weapons-- there were Assault Rockets (unguided missles fired
at ships 10000km away) and Torpedos (ICBMs in space), Electron and
Proton cannons, Laser batteries and laser cannons... sigh.

Unrealistic as you could get, but spaceship combat was pretty simple.

Not quite related to your problem, but IMHO there should be DMs based on TL

Actually, Norris had one of those blank "The bearer of this document has

Richelieu so badly...

He was ALSO acting on his foreknowledge that Strephon had been
assasinated.

Finally, he got away with it...which is the final arbiter of the extent
of _any_ use of authority.

If the Imperium does not own its member worlds but merely controls the
spaces between them, as was the case in Milieu 1100, how can it give
away these lands ?  Is the Imperium merely giving out feudal control,
including the power of taxation, over lands which are owned/controlled
by the people/governments of the planets or do the nobles actually
receive ownership of the land ?

One hex is a _lot_ of land.  In my map from Invasion Earth 1 hex of land
on Earth is approximately equal to the following areas - France & the
low countries, Iberia, Japan, 15% of the contiguous USA, half of Alaska,
etc.  A lot of valuable areas are much less than half a hex the British
Isles being a prime example.  Some valuable areas are too small to even
see on this scale such as Manhatten Island, Hong Kong, etc.

It is a lot easier for a PC to begin as or become a Knight than a higher
noble, are you sure you want a system that will give a Knight such a
valuable fief (and thereby taking away an improtant reason to
adventure)  perhaps Knights should receive a "token" fief of value MCr 1
or so, its physical size would vary based on the value of the land in
the area).  On another note I was always under the Impression that there
were (relatively) a lot of Knights in the Imperium.  Are there really so
few Knights that each one can have a fief this big ? 

My suggestion would be that
Knights (Soc B) may get a small fief worth not more than MCr 1 ( a few
sq km perhaps), some Knights will not have a fief.

Barons (Soc C) get a fief of 1 hex, or maybe 1,000,000 sq km to make it
simple. They also have a Knightly fief.
  
Marquis (Soc D) have a fief of an entire planet and receive income from
all the Barons and Knights under them. They also have Baronial and
Knightly fiefs.

Counts (Soc E) have a fief of several worlds and receive income from the
Marquis under them.  They also have Marquis, Baronial, and Knightly
fiefs.

Dukes have a fief of one subsector and recieve income from the Counts
under them.  The also have Counts, Marquis, Baronial, and Knightly
fiefs.

> C gets a barony (of several) hexes and an income from those hexes.


> D+ gets an override from knights and baronies under him/her.

I was always under the impression that nobles with high titles also had
all the lesser titles.  In Milieu 1100 Norris was Archduke of the Domain
of Deneb, Duke of Regina, Count Aledon, Marquis of Regina, Baron Yori,
and Knight OEG, OC, ODM. (Regency SB pg 9) If the higher nobles have the
lesser titles too they shoulg get the income from them _and_ an override
from the lesser nobles under them this may more properly reflect the
income they will receive.

> I\'d like input on

> 1. How much income does a hex produce to a noble? Cr1 per sq km? Cr10 per sq
> km?

Does the noble have feudal ownership of the land or just the right to
tax it ?  If he owns it and can sell it he can make a _great_ deal of
money.

The real question is what is on the land.  If you are the noble holding
the hex that includes a large and wealthy city (Tokyo, New York, Los
Angeles, etc) than some parts of your land are going to be worth
hundreds of thousands of credits an acre or more (1 sq km = aprox 250
acres).  Therefore each km square would be worth Mcr 50 or so.  If the
noble taxed this land at a rate of 10 mils (1% of value/ year) this
would bring in an income of MCr 0.5 per sq km. 

If the land does not include a city it is still valuable.  On a size 8
world a Knight (or if my suggestion is implemented, a Baron) will have a
fief of about 1,000,000 sq km.  If its land had an average value of even
Cr 10 per acre (pretty cheap) this equals Cr 2,500 per square km or Mcr
2,500 for the whole fief if the noble owns it.  If the noble merely has
the right to tax it, and does so at a rate of 1% per anum he/she will be
earning Mcr 25 per year.  I begin to see how those nobles can afford to
buy their yachts.

> 2. Can that income be enhanced by development, etc? How?

This really sounds like the start of a Pocket Empires tie in.  How about
saying something like "You can use Pocket Empires to cover the fiefs of
Nobles within the Imperium, as well as Pocket Empires without it, by
simply saying that one half (or one third ?) of all the income produced
by the territory goes to higher nobles and the Imperium itself."  If
this material is going to go in the T4.1 book that would probably be
enough, 

> 3. How many hexes do other nobles get?

See above.

If this planet is uninhabited this sounds perfect but if this planet has
a population I\'m not so sure this will work.  If a Noble were to show up
on a planet not in the Empire and tell its people "This is my planet,
you owe me money." they would not react very well.  (For a real world
example see the British Empire).  If the Empire was to say something
like "When this planet enters the Empire you will be the Marquis of it,
go persuade it to join." this would have a lot of benefits

1) It will increase the rate of growth of the Empire
2) It will get ambitious Nobles off of Sylea where they might start a
treasonous plot.
3) It will discourage them from leaving to start their own Pocket
Empire, which the Empire will just have to conquer/absorb in 100 years
or so anyway.

4)  It would make a really great adventure !

Does anyone out there want to write up an adventure for Milieu 0, which
would require Traveller 4.1, the redone Milieu 0, the NYR Nobles book
and Pocket Empires, maybe for release in March 98 or so ?  This
adventure would be set circa year 20 and would have a party of 5
charecters or so. They would be the Noble (a noble) , her husband (a
Noble, Diplomat, or Merchant), their ner do well son (a Noble or Naval
officer), the Nobles chief political advisor (a Diplomat), and the
Nobles chief Military advisor (a retired Marine officer) ? For the truly
adventureous there could be a rival pary of adventurors representing the
current government of the world. I have some ideas but this would be a
bit much for me.

I rule that all inheritance is done by a strict and formal procedure which
does not pay much attention to the actual time and order of death, unless
certain rare invalidating conditions happen.  (Example: Imperial
displeasure, legal hanky panky.)

A primary reason for this is that the succession on a world in the fringes
_cannot_ wait a year while the patent is confirmed.  There must be a way to
either confirm it in advance, or to allow the noble to act before
confirmation.  Further, the death of a high noble cannot bring things to a
halt while the successor journeys to Core.  (Being absent for a month is
one thing - some fringe nobility might be absent for two years on such a
trip.  If the noble can be gone that long, then they do not really control
much of anything.)

For example, Alven is married to Brit.  Alven has child Xavier, while Brit
has child Yolande, both by previous marriage.

Alven is a Count, while Brit is the associated Countess.  I festoon a noble
title with several associated single generation titles, thus the Count has
several associated Baronial titles which represents his recognized heirs,
and which have a noted and specific order of succession.  Further, the
Countess becomes a Surviving Countess as soon as the Count dies.  This
title will not pass, but will allow her to retain her social standing.
Surviving Countess titles do not have any other associated titles, just
like she had no associated titles when Count Alven was still alive.

The Count\'s heir is a Baron, thus Xavier will usually be titled Baron
Xavier as soon as Count Alven decides on him as his heir.  When Xavier
inherits, he will become Count Xavier, and the Baron title will lie fallow
until such time as he chooses or begats an heir.

Now, life gets interesting - you do not want just one heir, as heirs die.
For important titles, say a Count or a Marquis, you want to have at least
three or four, plus an algorithm for finding more.  You may have,
therefore, several such Baron and Knight titles to hand out to your
kinfolk.  Since it is really difficult to take back a title, you might want
to give a "third in line" title to you chosen heir, and leave first and
second fallow until you are "sure."  Adventure hook - someone else claims,
rightly or wrongly, to have a higher title than the recognized heir.
Preventing this is why a wise Noble designates a real heir early, and if
they get out of line, has them shot.  Most nobles are not this cold blooded
at this early date.  Give them a few generations.

Lets stir the pot a bit more - Brit is a Baroness in her own right, which
is not related to her marriage to Alven.  Brit likely has a knighthood or
two to give out to recognize her heirs, though the titles are not as high,
and the benefits are not nearly as good as those her husband the Count
controls.  Regardless, she may have titled Yolande as Sir Yolande.

Finally, what happens if Alven makes Brit an heir by giving his wife a
title in the succession line?  Well, the obvious.  If Alven dies and Brit
has the highest title, then she becomes the Countess, not a Surviving
Countess.  She may choose to retitle Xavier in favor of Yolande, which
might involve disowning Xavier entirely, or giving him a demotion.  Neither
is going to make Xavier happy, even if she leaves him in the succession.

Most would look a bit askance at her passing the Countess title to Yolande
in favor of Xavier, but they would let it pass, as if the Count had not
wanted it that way, he should not have titled Brit as a higher heir than
Xavier.

It would be considered quite rude for Brit to pass her Barony out of the
family, unless it was joining a higher title.  Swapping Yolande and
Xavier\'s positions would not go over well.

It would be considered quite legit and reasonable for her to make Baron
Xavier her heir as well, and thus concentrate the power of the two titles.
Were Xavier her own child as well as Count Alven\'s, this would even be
considered the most appropriate thing to do by a fair number of people.
That this leaves Yolande out in the cold is the stuff of good adventures.
It would also be considered quite reasonable for her to leave her title in
her own bloodline.

Assume Alven dies, and Brit inherits.  She then does the title swap, such
that Yolande gets the County, and Xavier gets the Barony.  Because this is
surprising, it is going to come under scrutiny, and thus exactly when she
got the power to do this becomes important.  Primarily, it depends on the
time of official notification.  I use the OCC as the official event timers
of the Imperium, and thus the arbiters of such events.  The second part of
your post relates to this:

One other point - the Emperor has the power to cast down nobles under
certain circumstances, while the Moot can refuse that noble the right to
sit in the Moot.  When a title inherits, though, if it follows the usual
paths, and the Emperor has had time to act on the titles given to the
offspring which made them the heir, then it becomes very difficult
politically for the Emperor to prevent inheritance.

>If the Imperial proclamation giving Baron Dinsha authority to do something is
>promulgated on 098-198 (I\'m in a rut here) and he does something within that
>authority after that date, is it legal even if he hasn\'t received the
>evidence of his authority (and he doesn\'t know he has that authority yet)?

Any authority or power within a region is centered on the title seat.  Your
authority is derived from that place, and changes in your authority are
determined from when the declaration of those changes reaches the seat, not
when it is proclaimed.  The official time lag is determined by an official
transit time, as determined by the OCC.  Note that as long as a message is
sent, you do not have to receive it for it to have power.

This can be important, because if you have a high jump ship, you can get
word of what is coming before you officially are told.  OTOH, if the
message is lost, you can get in big trouble exercising authority you no
longer have.

One final point - certain messages bear a warrant, and it is their arrival
which transmits the orders to you.  These are unusual, and are done only
for a few reasons, like treason.

Example: Count Alven\'s domain is 30pc from Sylea.  The OCC uses an official
speed of roughly J2.5, with a far more complicated pattern based on mains
and official word.  Since the Xboat net does not yet exist, the pattern is
really up to the OCC, and various courier ships sent out with official
notification.  As a result, a message from the Moot or the Emperor
officially takes something like 12 jumps, or 18 weeks.

On 001-300, the Emperor names Alven commander of a fleet in the area in the
Emperor\'s name, and directs him to take command immediately.  126 days
later, the Emperor will assume that Alven has taken charge.  If, on
110-300, Alven takes over, the Emperor will be a bit displeased.  Alven
might choose, assuming some kind of power vacuum, to try some kind of self
appointed acting command, which earns no Imperial Ire, as long as the
Emperors will has not been made clear yet.  On 110, it has not been.

If he has not taken command on or about 128-300, the Emperor will be a tad
displeased.  Some slack is allowed, as that noble might just be off planet
at the time.

Now, let\'s say the noble in question is sitting in the moot.  If the
Emperor uses his Imperial rank and oath of fealty to order the noble to
take a command,  the noble will take command on the date that the order
reaches his domain seat.    The Emperor will usually put an "earliest
convenience" notation on the order, so if he gets the message a week
earlier, he can name himself an acting commander pending official orders.
He might even have the official orders in his possession, but they do not
go into effect until 128 days have passed.

This convention, by the way, is completely separate from what the Emperor
can order as the head of the armed forces - he can immediately order
someone to be placed in charge, with none of this acting nonsense.  On the
other hand, the force is then that of military courtesy, not feudal power.

All nobles are really two people - the noble who owes fealty to the
Emperor, and the person who might be subject to various other restrictions.
 A soldier ordered by the commander must act as soon as the orders are
given, while a noble tasked with something by the Emperor is responsible
for doing it when the orders reach the seat of power.  On the other hand,
if those two personae conflict, the noble must settle it correctly.  In the
eyes of the Emperor, this means going with feudal authority.  Courts tend
to go with the Emperor on such issues.

Why is there a difference?

Nobles are acting as representatives of Imperial might, and their authority
comes from the Emperor himself.  Honor becomes very important under these
circumstances, as they represent the Emperor, and he has a public image of
honorability.  For example, if the Emperor orders a Count to take charge of
a squadron and to harass the enemy, the noble should feel like he has a
mandate.  If the same Count is placed in command of the same squadron
through official Naval channels, then he does not have an Imperial mandate.

This is why nobles will stay primarily at their title seat, rather than at
the moot - if you sit in the moot, then a power given to you may not be
exercised for quite some time after you first hear of it, and people have a
chance to work against you.  Further, you are a long way from the events
that supposedly give you power.  Admittedly, they have just as long if you
are home as if you are at the moot, but the orders you work under do not
have a delay that affects you when you are on your home world.

To prevent the moot from being entirely a Sylean affair, important nobles
can recognize an heir with the "direct succession" title.  For example, if
Count Alven wants to sit in the moot, he will name Xavier the Baron, will
recognize him as Count in Waiting, and will then board ship for Sylea.

By doing this, he loses much direct control over his finances.  The Count
in Waiting keeps essential control of the resources of the County until the
title is revoked, or the Count sends an official notification of his
desires and intentions.  By convention, these notifications are short and
vague, as the Emperor does not want the Imperium run entirely from Sylea,
but he does want more than figureheads in the moot.

In this way, experienced nobles who do not thrive on the daily exercise of
power will migrate to Sylea, where they help set the overall course of
Imperial policy.

   True.  There still are.

   Not true.  By the renaissance, practically all clergy were required
   to take oaths of celibacy before ordination.  These requirements were
   made nearly universal by the Cluniac Reforms, and made marriage
   impossible for clergymen who took the oath.  (Keep in mind that
   Catholics make a distinction between marriage and cohabitation. 
   While an outlaw cleric may have a lover; that is not the same thing
   as having a wife.  An oath of celibacy will render invalid any
   attempt at a marriage.)

> Then the church finally decided to start obeying its own  rules

   That comment sounded a little snide to me.  These rules have changed
   with time and place, and have made married clergy more and less
   common depending on era and location.  Few fair-minded persons
   believe that changing a rule constitutes `finally deciding to start
   obeying\' it.

That will depend enTIREly on what those km\'s do...1 square km of , say
Hong Kong can generate a LOT more income than 1 square km of Montana. It
also depends on what is generating those Cr\'s. Are they sales taxes,
grazing fees, selling the water rights, mineral rights, rent? If rent are
you doing a residential or commercial development? Are you establishing a
mine? Are the lands already occupied by people who _might_ not appreciate
a new landlord?
 
> 2. Can that income be enhanced by development, etc? How?

Of course, this is standard real estate rules, you own land..want to get
more out of it? Develop it. The exact rules will depend on the \'quality\'
of the hexes in question. Arid land on a low-tl planet with few mineral
resources with no water isn\'t going to be worth squat.

> 3. How many hexes do other nobles get?

More to the point, how are these hexes allocated...Obviously if all nobles
of a certain level get X hexes, some are more equal than others....

Well _that\'s_ great way to get people out of your hair...Cleon: "I
pronounce you Sir Lancelot. You now have a fiefdom 45 parsecs away from
Sylea...go tend your property, Sir Knight!" What with the costs of
surveying and development, you\'ll keep \'em too busy to foment palace
troubles...

If you want to be REAL sadistic, set up a system like feudal Japan..."The
Emperor wishes your presence at court for X months of the year, that He
might enjoy your counsel", but you have huge development projects going on
four different planets...You either have to have very good subordinates,
or spend a lot on commuting costs.

This can be a giant problem, and possibly a very lucrative business, if
you have a number of nominally wealthy (in land) nobles, without the
resources to do the developments...a developer with a bit of capital could
clean up exploiting the fiefdoms of nobles who can\'t otherwise capitalize
on their fiefs.

The real wealth of the Imperium comes from the overlooked "controls the
space between the inhabited worlds."  IF the Imperium owns the trade
routes and all those nice semi-unclaimed raw materials floating around
out there, that is a lot of MCr.

This is where something like the Pocket Empires economic stuff
will come into play.  Productivity of land is going to be a
function of (in PE terms) population and infrastructure (and
possibly other labor-multiplying factors as well) - a hex of
vacant land on a pop-0 world is not going to generate as much
income as a hex containing New York City.

Note that we ignore the _type_ of income (agricultural products,
information, tax revenue, tithe or kind); we\'re interested in
only the value.

>2. Can that income be enhanced by development, etc? How?

Absolutely; development in this case means infrastructure, and
infrastructure is a multiplier - a farmer with a certain amount
of TL8 infrastructure will get a higher yield for less labor than
a subsistence farmer at TL2 on the same land, for example.  The
story of civilization is really nothing more than the story of
the creation of multipliers, so that one person could support
more than just himself.


>3. How many hexes do other nobles get?

It\'s a little difficult to judge; the Traveller system doesn\'t
quite match up to any real-world system with which I am familiar.
I\'ve taken Traveller "count" as British "viscount" and Traveller
"marquis" as British "earl".

Traveller Estates (Knight\'s fief) typically consist of one hex;
in cases where the income is particularly rich or poor, it may
consist of partial or multiple hexes.  Regardless of physical
size, the income from an Estate is guaranteed to be sufficient to
provide an override to the Baron, and thence to maintain the
knight as befits his station.

Traveller Baronies consist of roughly two dozen Estates.  The
Baron will directly hold one of them, usually the one that is
most centrally located in terms of transportation/ accessibility
not terrain.  A Barony\'s income from overrides is guaranteed to
be not less than the greater of total income of the richest
Estate it encompasses or sufficient to provide an override to the
Count, and thence to maintain the Baron as befits his station.

Traveller Counties consist of roughly two dozen Baronies,
regardless of income.  The Count of a County will also directly
hold one of the Baronies within it, which may or may not be the
most prestigious or generate the highest income.  A County is
guaranteed to have a total income from overrides of the greater
of no less than twice the income of the Barony that generates the
highest income or sufficient to provide an override to the
Marquis, and thence to maintain the Count as befits his station.

Traveller Marquisates should be _no_more_ than an entire world,
and most will be less; a world generating average income should
probably have around two dozen Marquisates.  The income of
Marquisates has no fixed relationship with the number or income
of its subordinate Counties.  The Marquis of a Marquisate will
also directly hold one of the subordinate Counties; generally,
this will be the one with the highest income or prestige.  Some
Marquises prefer the title "Earl" or "Lord".  A proper Marquisate
should generate sufficient income to provide an override to the
Duke, and thence to maintain the Marquis as befits his station,
but "white elephant" Marquisates have been known to exist.

Traveller Duchies should _never_ be less than an entire world,
and may be more; the importance of the fief should be
proportional to its income.  While a Duchy will be composed of
several Marquisates, there is no fixed relationship between the
number or income of the Marquisates and that of the Duchy.  The
Duke of a Duchy will also directly hold one of the subordinate
Marquisates; this will _always_ be the one with the highest
income or prestige.  During expansionistic periods in Imperial
history, the Governor of an absorbed/colonized planet was
typically the seneschal of the Duke to whom the planet was
awarded.  A proper Duchy should generate sufficient income to
provide an override to the Archduke/Emperor, and thence to
maintain the Duke as befits his station; as with Marquisates,
there are some "white elephant" Duchies.

I\'m new on this list, and also very new to Traveller. I actually bought TNE
(NOT T4) some days ago, and I am wondering about some of the rules. I well
aware of that many of my questions are rather stupid, but anyway I haven\'t
figured it out by myself yet.

First, there\'s the damage/penetration rules. If a weapon which do 4(D6)
damage has a pen.val. of 2-nil, is it right that 2D6 damage get through if
it hits flak jacket at short range? I guess so.

If the above is right, does this mean that all plasma-weapons do no damage
at short/normal range if they hit AV 1? This seems a little odd to me, and
I wondered if I just missed something.

Are there many changes in the system between TNE and T4? If there is a list
or an upgrade to the TNE rules or something I would really want to get it.
You can send it to me personally.

In the book it says that strangles can be blocked. Does this mean that they
can be blocked each round, or just until the attacker succeds in a strangle
(and therefore "holding" the target)? I would think that when one
successful strangle has been done, the only way for the defender is to do
an escape.

Well, that\'s it. I\'m sorry for my stupid questions, but I guess you could
be just the right guys to ask.

Good!  This has been an area that Traveller left a bit vague previously.  I
am glad to see you address it.

We need the answers to three questions before we can address the
lands/income issue.

1.  What fraction of the population is noble
2.  What fraction of the land is held in fiefdoms
3.  What fraction of the income is given to the noble to spend

According to character generation, roughly 1/12th of the population is
noble.  Of those nobles, the majority are knights which do not have an
explicit fief.

According to my most recent almanac from the UK, they have roughly 0.1% of
the population ennobled - of the millions of people in the UK, there are
several thousand nobles, all listed.

This means that on Sylea, the thirty billion people will result in
something like 30 million nobles on Sylea alone.

This does not seem to be the way people think about nobles in Traveller,
thus we need a better model.  If they are more like the members of the
Forbes 500 list than people making more than US$112,000, then we might have
something.

Assume: wealth and nobility are not always related, but often are.  Nobles
above the rank of knight represent the upper 0.001% of society, thus Sylea
has 300,000 nobles whose rank is above knight.  If we use this model,
anyone above the rank of knight is clearly in the idle rich category, with
the equivalent of millions of dollars a year of income.  Knights are in the
CEO of major corporation range, if my us dept. of census numbers are any
indication.

There might be millions of knights, but this is less of a problem, as they
do not require land, and they likely do not get the respect that others do.
 For example, I allow local masters of orders of knighthoods to award
memberships in their orders without having to clear it with the Emperor
first.  I realize this is a break from canon, but the alternative has the
Emperor just assigning titles all day long.  (As an exercise, work out how
many nobles the Emperor must confirm in a day, assuming several million
nobles in the Imperium, and an average life span of 80 years.)

It does seem like the total number of nobles should either be proportional
to wealth, or to population, and of those, I like population.  Smaller
planets should not lead to nobles with smaller fiefs directly, only through
population.  This is, of course, just my opinion.

>Size	 Diameter 	 Circumference 	 Hex 	 HexArea 
>0	 -   	 -   	 -   	 -   
>1	 1,600 	 5,027 	 144 	 15,469
....

I would rather state that a noble gets an area of economic importance
roughly in proportion to his or her rank.  I suspect this should be divided
into two categories - developed and undeveloped.  A noble willing, or
forced, to take a domain beyond the borders will get a fairly large chunk
of land.  Nobles with fiefs in settled, developed areas, will get much
smaller ones.

I suggest against basing it on the size of the planet, since population and
value are not really based on that.   is not correlated with planet size in
the present rules.  Instead, it should be likely be either a flat land grant.

The Imperium taxes the planets directly, and I suspect the nobles.

Nobles give up 1/3 of their income to their superiors.

>B gets one hex (based on some world selection process). That hex generates an
>income.

If we instead say that a C-grade noble is in charge of one major city and
the surrounding area to 50 km., OR gets an undeveloped grant of 1000km,
then it seems more reasonable.  This should produce an income of a GCr or
so, of which most has to be given up or plowed back in.

A D-grade noble might get 500Km, or a continent on an undeveloped planet.

E gets a cut from everyone below, or might own an entire planet outright.
Of course, they might have to support numerous lesser nobles on that planet.

F is much the same, but might have interests on several planets in the
system, with some of that taken up by lesser nobles who owe fealty to them.

Note: this is assuming a feudal system.  If everyone owes allegiance
directly to the Emperor, then the fiefs will likely not be very different
in size - any rank of Baron or above owns a 100Km estate, but the higher
the grade, the better developed it is.

>1. How much income does a hex produce to a noble? Cr1 per sq km? Cr10 per sq
>km?

A hell of a lot.  Supposedly, land goes for hundreds to thousands a square
foot  per month in downtown areas.  On the other hand, an unimproved square
km of dirt with some kind of resources could bring in (in Nevada oil
country) $50K/month, assuming a dozen wells, and only one hit.

Land used only for crops is less obvious, but still should be bringing in
at least a few thousand dollars per square km, else it is hard to justify.

Once we know what it is worth and how much it brings in, we have to decide
how big the noble\'s take is.

>2. Can that income be enhanced by development, etc? How?

Probably.  I am working on some rules for my own happiness, but those are
going slowly - too many other projects.

>I envision many land grants being given to nobles on worlds well beyond the
>Imperial borders, and the noble needing to go to that grant and survey it (or
>have someone survey it). Until surveyed, the land produces no income; once
>surveyed (and developed) etc.

Yep.  This would be how the nobles get divided.  One problem, of course, is
that those nobles are then unavailable to do ruling things on Sylea.  As
the Empire matures, it will need to give land grants locally to nobles
brought in.

>Ideas. Thoughts. Comments?

Looks like you are on the right track.  Do be sure to figure out what
income level each rank should have in general, and then we can likely work
out how many of them there are, and how big an estate they have.

No, it was much more basic than that (he says, remembering his 
Medieval History courses twenty odd, some of them *very* odd, years 
ago). The church very early on cottoned on to the idea that one\'s 
stay in Purgatory (or access to heaven, depending on the period) 
could *theoretically* be reduced/increased by "buying" help -- extra 
masses said in ones name, charitable deeds done (through the local 
church, of course) to counterbalance the nasties etc. Since the dark 
Ages and Middle Ages were relatively cash poor, this inevitably 
meant that a lot of the offerings made were in the form of *land*.

Now, you\'re a Priest and you have a family -- when you do, you want 
to provide for them after your death. There the problem arises, was 
the land left to you *personally*, and therefore could be left to 
your offspring, or was it left to the church as a whole (i.e. the 
local Bishop, Archbishop, Cardinal, Pope etc.) and therefore *not* 
your property and not inheritable.

Needless to say, the upper levels of the church hierarchy took the 
(understandable, given the milieu) attitude that it was *theirs*. 
This undoubtedly caused a great deal of ill-feeling and opposition -- 
so one of the easiest ways to do away with it was to require that all 
Priests be celibate and not marry ... and take a vow of poverty (in 
theory) so they could not alienate property that the church believed 
rightly belonged to *it*.

This was made easier by the fact that the church (Orthodox, Catholic, 
and other variations) had rapidly become very anti-woman after its 
split from Judaism, and women were seen as corrupters of men and 
inherently evil (especially outside of wedlock), so there was a long 
tradition of unmarried priests being somehow more "holy" than the 
married ones.

Of course, there were a lot of other factors involved -- for 
example, the Orthodox churches have never had the same attitude 
towards married priests *at the low end of the scale*. They 
*expected* Village Priests to be married (to help prevent them from 
sinning), but required those wishing to pursue higher office to be 
unmarried (or, at least, celibate). Most of the Nestorian and other 
breakaway heretical churches had similar attitudes as well.

There are other factors associated with empty space that must be
considered as well.

The Milky Way consists of perhaps a 5000 LY thick galactic disk 
populated not only with stars, but star stuff.  Gas and dust nebulae, 
protostars, possibly even a very large number of brown dwarfs.  Rifts 
are actually regions of nebulosity, not stellar deserts (contrary to 
canonical Traveller\'s definition). There are even stars inside of them, 
hidden or obscured by the gas and dust, occuring with perhaps no less 
than the normal frequency.  So why would these regions be obstacles if 
there are still stars there?  Because they aren\'t easily charted and 
explored.  Hence, they aren\'t astrogatable.  Visible wavelengths are 
greatly attenuated, requiring the use of elaborate and expensive sensor 
apparatus to penetrate the rifts to obtain necessary astrometric and 
gravimetric data (this from motion studies of the target system, not 
gravitometer readings).

My guess is that a fast expanding civilization will grow around rift regions 
rather than through them, and only after time and great effort will they be 
finally charted.

Worlds not-catalogued would be a different matter.  The target
system would have to be analyzed extensively by the ship\'s sensor suite, 
not only for such as electromagnetic phenomena and gravitic factors. 

Now, the basis assumptions of jump drive are that you enter jumpspace
and about 168 hours later, exit the same at your destination.  The actual 
physics of this matter have yet to be examined in excruciating detail, 
but I\'ll take a shot in another post if anyone\'s interested.

Obviously, gravity has a big effect on the quality and outcome
of the basic jump.  Not just initial and terminal gravity, but 
gravitational shear stresses between origin and destination.  There 
would also be effects from non-local disruptions along a given jump 
"route."  Additionally, not all stars are moving at zero velocity
with respect to our region\'s "Local Standard of Rest."  In fact,
none of them are.  So your destination could be going a a considerable
fraction of the speed of light relative to your origin.  Ooops!
There\'s definitely a need for big maneuver drives and elaborate
velocity matching maneuvers both prior to and after jump.  (ie., lots
of maneuver time).  This velocity shear is even a problem with 
stutterwarp units (which would all retain the initial velocity of 
the system of their construction with respect to the local frame of 
rest).

One of the basic services provided by the IISS would be the assembly 
(and sale) of an extensive jump astrogation database ("Navigation 
Programs 1-6?").  Such a tool would allow safe astrogation between 
most of its catalogued worlds.   Rift penetration routes and Rift 
"corridors" (regions of relative transparency amid opaque nebulae) 
would be closely guarded military secrets or commercial bottlenecks.  
Of course, the Scouts can\'t do much about the velocity shear problem, 
except to encourage big M-drives). The astrogation data would be 
quite valuable to commercial and private interests not willing to 
outfit ships with elaborate sensor apparatus.  It is my opinion 
that this subtle tool, this commercial incentive, is the true means 
by which the Imperium attracts worlds and encourages trade.  The 
Imperium builds high quality roads, establishes commercial sea routes 
and protects them, and voila! - trade ensues, and the Imperium 
taxes the trade as much as it can without strangling it.  Nothing 
is ever new under the sun, even if the sun is Sylea\'s.

Another consideration for the "Imperial Revenue Service":

In the region that will eventually become the 3I, there are actually 
more than 11,000 stars.  A lot more, at least an order of magnitude
more.  To give you an idea, the Near Star Map of 2300AD (derived 
from the Gliese catalog) incorporated roughly 771 star systems within 
50 LY of earth.  This data is a low count of the near stars, that is, 
it does not and cannot account for stars too dim to be seen even 
though they are quite close (ie. we could have very close neighbors 
that are effectively invisible.)

Assuming standard canonical dimensions, the old Near Star Map roughly 
approximates the extent of the Solomani Rim Sector (although it\'s about
10-15 LY too small in radius). 

Extrapolating based on the assumption that average stellar densities 
in the Local Fluff hold throughout the Local Bubble and Loop I region 
that comprises the Imperium, there are perhaps 210,000 stars in 
within 100PC of earth (again, this is a low estimate). The Local Bubble 
extends about 120 PC out from Sol (about 390 LY).  This is roughly 
half the region covered by the Imperium and effectively bounds the 
Solomani Sphere.   

A similar "Vilani Sphere" comprises the nucleus of the Coreward extents 
of the Imperium, with its center roughly at "Reference".  These regions 
are of similar volumes, noting that the Vilani Sphere does not incorporate 
the Ley, Empty Quarter, Antares, Lishuun, Vland, Amdukan, Mendan, and 
Meshan regions of prior Vilani settlement.  As a rough estimate, the 3I 
may incorporate well in excess of 450,000 star systems.  My best guess 
(at this moment) places the actual number of systems at close to 600,000 
star systems. Maybe more, maybe less considering stellar densities, clusters,
and error in observable data and initial assumptions.

And most of these systems are rocks.  All except for 11,000 of them or so.
Dull, boring lifeless...empty...empty of everything except debris.  Valuable 
debris.  Heavy and light metals.  Fissile materials.  Rocks.  Antimatter 
rocks.  Intelligent semiconductor rocks.  And the Imperium owns all of these 
lifeless systems that don\'t qualify as "worlds."  After all, if the IISS
finds it and decides: 

	"Wot?!...Why that\'s not a world, its an exploitation zone!" 

Who is to argue?

Sternmetal Horizons and LSP and company will be very pleased and even eager 
to cough up the cash to pay for exploitation rights.  Except unlike Uncle 
Sam, Uncle Cleon probably won\'t give this sort of thing away.  The taxation 
credits alone will buy thousands of TL16++ RoM Dreadnoughts.

If you look at todays\' European nobility, while relatively wealthy, they\'re
just nowhere near as rich as your average industrialist.  Modes of
production shift; while several generations ago real estate (immoveable
property) was the primary source of wealth, these days incorporeal
immoveables (corporate securities and so forth; chunks of society\'s
economic engine) are the primary source of wealth.

	My take on the nobility of the 3I is that in many cases they just
have _fantastic_ stock portfolios; like the landowners in mediaeval times,
they simply control most of the major means of production.  This doesn\'t
mean that I don\'t see them holding land... just that relatively speaking,
their importance comes more from their importance as shareholders in the
megacorps and other corporations.  Let\'s face it... between rent from 100
peasants and a chunk of Microsoft, I\'ll take the chunk of Microsoft; it\'s
probably worth more, will probably increase in value, and is more easily
transferable.

	So basically, you don\'t want to look at how much land a noble holds
to determine her net worth; you want to figure out where her ancestors put
their money, and how much of Tukera does she own.

	An interesting idea here would be that much of a noble family\'s
wealth is tied up in bulletproof perpetual trusts; any given generation
gets income from it, and can pump some money back into it, but can\'t blow
it all on wine, pretty boys, and Famille Spofulam MegaYachts and grav
bikes.  I have this vision of noble families\' wealth being these vast
accumulations of capital that almost have a life of their own, and in
relation to which the nobles themselves are almost subservient; their
primary purpose from an economic point of view is simply to provide
titularies to all this wealth...  The noble himself doesn\'t really matter;
what does matter is that the astronomical sums belonging to him have
someone to attach to.

because the Imperium does not own worlds, it owns the space between 
the worlds. It may recognize a landowning individual with a title,
or the Emperor may "let out" part of his personal lands in a feudal
contract, but the Imperium per se should not own much land on it\'s member
planets.

The exception is Imperial Installations such as starports. This could be
a compromise - the Imperial land grants are starport facilities ...

A second exception could be the Imperium accepting land in lieu of
taxes, and then choosing to grant those lands in a feudal/profit
sharing basis. This raises the thorny issue of Imperial taxes ... I
assume the Imperium sets a tax rate as a proportion of GWP, and
independantly audits GWPs thru MoJ or someone. The Navy etc would then
contract with corporations to buy starships and so on, hire people to
work for them, pay pensions etc, which would serve to return the income
to the member worlds of the Imperium.

I guess I can summarize the issue in the question "Are Nobles rich because
they are nobles, or a Nobles noble becasue they are rich ?".

If it is the first, how does the Imperium (which does not claim to own
worlds) make it\'s Nobility rich ? If the second, then how does the 
Emporer judge who to make noble (I guess two out of good character,
rich and great deeds would do it).

 It is a lot easier for a PC to begin as or become a Knight than a higher

 valuable fief (and thereby taking away an improtant reason to
 adventure)  perhaps Knights should receive a "token" fief of value MCr 1
 or so, its physical size would vary based on the value of the land in
 the area).  On another note I was always under the Impression that there
 were (relatively) a lot of Knights in the Imperium.  Are there really so
 few Knights that each one can have a fief this big ?

Some won\'t get Lands as a MO benefit.

   Ahhh, from the database of the Imperial Navy (Fifth Frontier War), here is
some background concerning the Order of Battle for the Sword World Navy at
the onset of the Fifth Frontier War.
    The Sword World Confederation Navy (SWCN) was organized as stated by
others of the TML, member world navies confederated during a time of crisis.
 In the case of the FFW, it was organized at times in up to no more than  two
fleets (Joyeuse and Gram).  The admirals, in order of seniority, were Admiral
Riksdattar (4+1), Eyolfsson (4+2), and Tryggvesson (2+2), with the latter
(junior) admirals seemingly more capable.  The Sword Worlds contributed six
plus corps of troops for ground action.  Its naval order of battle consisted
of one tanker, and two assault transport squadrons. Its bite consisted of 4
frontline (for the Sword Worlders) and two other batrons, and seven lightly
armed crurons.
    It should be noted that the Sword Worlders suffered technologically as
well versus both its Imperial Colonial, and regualr Imperial Navy
counterparts.
    The Sword World Navy initated action in the FFW shortly after the initial
Zhodani incursion into the Regina sector.  While the Imperial response was
mobilizing, the SWCN performed an act of "perfidious" betrayal by attacking
Lanth, and even threatening Rhylanor.  This threat, however, was rather
short-lived as the 193rd Imperial Fleet dealt a severe blow to a Sword World
fleet attempting to land troops on Lanth (001-1108).  Lanth would be
threatened again by the SWCN, but was once again crushed by the 193rd
Imperial Fleet on 096-1109.  The worlds of Gram and Joyeuse, leaders of the
faction favoring war against the Imperium, were crushed by the losses, and as
the coalition collapsed, the Sowrd Worlds settled for peace under Imperial
terms, withdrawing from the Outworld Coalition.
   Just a little history.
    FYI.. the SWCN symbol is a downward pointing sowrd crossed by two sword,
one with its blade pointed to the left, the other to the right.

Leroy,

One thing bothers me. For monthes I\'ve been reading about "J.P.

	Simple enough, I remember playing Knight Hawks with my 10-year old

one bit. :)  Sometimes I wish Traveller was that simple, or that I 
could happily ignore everything scientific and just have fun with the 
game.

	This occurred to me when I (again) started wondering what "real" 
stars (mostly big, bright ones) might be in the Neworld sector (my 
campaign location). When I realized Aldebaran must be about 100 
light-years too close to Earth I nearly panicked and started thinking 
about a three-dimensional map of Traveller universe with every star 
accurately in place... And ended up with a migraine.

	Which approach do people on the list like better? Canonical 
("Aldebaran is the next sector Rimward of Solomani Rim"), Scientific 
("Aldebaran _is_ 260 light-years from Earth, so it\'s one whole sector 
too close") or Conspiratorial approach ("I know Aldebaran is too 
close to Earth. So do they. But if I don\'t tell them I know maybe 
they keep their mouths shut too.")?

	Where\'s my "Zebulon\'s Guide to Frontier Space"?!

I have moved my initial response to a "P.S." at the end of this 
message, as it got a bit non-TML, so this has become a TL/trade issue!

One commodity that low tech worlds can offer is people - a Filipino 
nanny, or a Bangladeshi road sweeper.  A society on one world may 
consider robot domestic help unacceptable, and prefer to employ women 
(or men, let\'s be equal opportunity) as nannies, gardeners, chauffeurs 
and so on - it may be cheaper, more prestigious or both.

I don\'t recall the exact figures, but I remember an article in Time 
magazine (or a similar publication) in the 80\'s that looked at the 
importance of expatriate workers to the economies of the Philipines, 
Bangladesh and several other countries.  Even Britain made it onto the 
league table (as a supplier of expats to richer countries).



Simon




Slavery is a relative term IMO.  I would consider the jobs of Filipino 
nannies in many (mainly) Arab families to be modern slavery; some of 
the slaves in ancient Rome quite liked their "jobs", I believe.

A few decades before the UK and US ended slavery, there were relatively 
few people in those countries who considered slavery unacceptable.

If murder is "always" unacceptable, can we find a rational explanation 
for the Police-run death squads that killed street children (to "tidy 
up" the streets) in the run up to the World Economic Summit a few years 
ago.

That is the same as FFS version 1
  
If we take Andy\'s figures (and they look OK to me), we have a factor of 
33 between FFS and Andy.

Let us start handwaving.  The FFS data could be taken to refer to 
purifying fuel from a gas giant, and the plant needs either (1) 33 x 
more time, or (2) 33 x more power for ocean refuling.

FFS 0.01 MW x 6 h = .06MWh / kl
x33 = 2 MWh/kl = 28 MWh/T

This gives us a few options, I will consider only two:

(1) Refueling at a GG is the way to go - it typically needs 6 hours to 
purify the fuel = time to fly to 100 Diameters anyway.  Ocean refuling 
takes 200 hours (8 days) - curse those ship designers!

(2) The purifaction plant can take 33 x more power when needed.  
Unfortunately the power requiremnet is so high for ocean refueling that 
the ship cannot actually fly and purify at the same time ... you can 
lay on the beach while the water is split into H2 and O2, or wait until 
you are in orbit and do it there.


Let us take the Lintula Sunrise, from "Long Way Home", UK printing:

Power = 400 MW
Fuel purification = 10 T/h

10 T/h x 28 MWh/T = 280 MW ... quite a large part of the 400 MW 
available.

I will use option (2), as I\'ve always pictures the ship lying 
helplessly in the water during refuelling (one of the reasons I always 
liked the cover of the MT Referee\'s Companion, with the tentacles of a 
huge sea creature reaching for that hapless crew member)

Once again, science leads to more adventure possibilities!

I suspect that shipping raw materials will make perfect economic sense 
in the Imperium.  

(1) Even if your fusion recycler acts like a vast mass spectrometer 
that separates all of the component atoms out neatly, what are you 
going to do with them on a green, high tech, non-industrial world?

(2) on a high tech industrial world, it may still be cheaper to bring 
in raw materials and chemical intermediates than collect everything to 
a central recycling facility and then re-distribute the recovered 
material - just look at the poor recycling of tin, aluminium and other 
"easy" materials now.

Sure, some worlds will be good recyclers, but I\'ll bet that there are 
plenty of profligate worlds.

Here in the UK, our coal mining industry is virtually non-existant in 
1997 - it is cheaper to get most of our energy from oil, gas and cheap 
imported coal (open cast instead of deep mined).  If we can use 
multi-million Credit tankers to sail for weeks between the oil fields 
and the end-users, I\'m sure our high tech counterparts can use 
starships in a similar way.

Besides, those raw materials will be very cheap, because the low tech 
world will be desperately trying to pay for those high-tech imports.  
(Psst!  Anyone want to buy some UN food aid so I can get guns?)

The Imperium does not lay claim to the inhabited worlds-much like the
percent of nobles that is about .01% of all the rocks out there. There
are literally billions of rocks it does own.  Planetary government
doesn\'t leave the surface of the worlds, so space and those empty rocks
ARE the Imperium.  They obtain and parcel out the "new lands" to the
noble and corporate exploiter alike.

Sort of like the US Forest Service selling trees off its land, but I\'m
sure the Imperium always makes a huge profit.  I see this as one of its
major  sources of income.

Because 10 is a *lousy* divisor for setting up shifts and the like.

I expect that the number of "local hours" will vary from world to
world, but certain numbers are far more likely than others.

We\'ve kept the 24 (and 60) divisions because they are *useful*. They
are much easier to divide up into smaller chunks than base 10.

Sorry, but the orbital period depends not only on the size of the orbit
but also on the mass of the star. There are formulas for this in the
supplements that go in for detailing star systems.

It should be in Book 6 Scouts, Grand Survey, etc. 

You need the star size and type as well as the orbital radius.

Actually, as I heard it, there were *real* grounds for rioting. The

Trouble is, how do you get the times synchronized that well? Assuming
that there *is* some means of synchronization, then the authorities
would go by the Imperial Date and Imperial Standard Time.

We\'d need to check some legal precedents from the age of sail. We do
have things like the battle of New Orleans being fought *after* the
peace treaty had been signed, but before the combatants had gotten word
of it.

Personally, I\'d say that that the Baron does not have the autority
until he receives his copy of the proclamation. That produces the
maximum consistency in the way things work. Otherwise you have
officials using authority that they *hoped* had been granted by that
time.

What about the second, third, etc children of a noble?  Do all of 
them get a fief? or only the first Child? I have always thought of 
adventurers being the other children of nobles that don\'t receive 
land but only the title and an inheritance.

Back to your question about land.  I don\'t think a typical knight 
would have anything close to a hex.  How about shifting you table 
down one level.  Knights get a fractural hex, Barons a hex, etc.

This is personal fiefs that they actually own.  Most nobles will have 
other assets as well.  You might want to add additional tables for 
Dwellings (castle, keep, royal reserve, etc), Corporate or Capital 
Assets (factories, transportation lines, etc), Political table 
(allies, enemies) , Taxation table (Noble receives a percent from 
special taxes) , and maybe a military table (household guard, lift 
regiment, etc).  A noble would get a number of rolls on these tables 
equal to (something like):
Knight d6-4
Baron d6
Count d6+2
Marquis 2d6
Duke  3d6

Each of the tables (land, dwelling, etc) would have a DM depending on 
the noble\'s rank. Knights -3, Barons -1, Marquis +1 and Duke +3.  
This way a Baronary might be larger than a Count\'s fief, this would 
reflect that the ancestors of the Baron has managed their estate 
better than the Count\'s.

Just some ideas.  Who is writing the Nobles books?  Stu and Joe?

The key word here is \'member\'. The Emperor doesn\'t give land grants one
MEMBER worlds. Outside the Imperium, the situation is entirely different.
That\'s where these grants of nobility are coming from; for inhabited
worlds, the nobles are typically co-opted from the ledership of that
world, or as someone else has said in this vein recently, the emperor
probably makes the ruling noble out of the person who brings the system
into the Imperial fold.

Where is this 33 figure coming from? Electrolysis of water is trivially
easy, and with a MW of power, you can easily electrolyse a lot of water,
very quickly. Electrolysis of water ALSO gains you a great advantage over
scooping gas giant...it is a greatly purifying step, particularly if
you\'re distilling it first, again a trivial matter if  you have a spare
MW. The cost in power and time for \'fuel purification\' IMO, is in
separating out the trace impurities. With water, those impurities will
be quite different from the hydrogen, salts and oxygen mainly, and the
electrolysis takes care of the oxygen. With scooped fuel, you have a
mixture of gases with quite similar physical properties; distilling
hydrogen from a mixture of hydrogen, helium, and a host of other trace
gases is difficult and time consuming.

I think the RoM should remain TL 12. It matters greatly in Milieu 0 what
tech level the RoM achieved because the Third Imperium is a direct
descendant of the RoM. Sylea was a major system in the RoM and any
technology it had Sylea would have access to. Other posters have made this
point in much more detail than I am able to, pointing out inconsistencies
of a high RoM TL with CT, MT, Triplanetary, the Frontier Wars, and many
other cases. Obviously claiming the RoM had widely achieved TL 13 will have
major canon-breaking effects. Moreover, it is totally unnecessary to make
this claim.

Not exactly true; the overall thrust of the background for M:0 is that
OUTSIDE TECHNOLOGY was superior to the early 3rd Imperium. It is possible
for published material and M:0 to remain consistent, so long as you
remember that the data published in M:1100 has one thousand years of
historical, technological, and cultural research over M:0 behind it.
According to T4 canon, there are caches of TL 14+ equipment which are
attributed to the RoM. From the M:1100 perspective, the RoM had an overall
TL of 12. These can both be valid if we assume that the TL 14+ equipment in
M:0 was actually from a different civilization which no longer exists in
M:1100.

I agree. In my humble opinion the best way to do this is propose another
planet which, like Sylea, was colonized by Terrans during the RoM but,
unlike Sylea, did not regress technologically during the Long Night. Over
the centuries it was able, perhaps with Ancient relics to study, to advance
to TL 14 by M:0. As the Third Imperium expands into the remnants of the RoM
it uncovers evidence of this advanced planet. The only point of similarity
between Sylea and the advanced planet are their common RoM heritage.
Therefore, the Third Imperium identifies them as evidence of a
high-technology RoM.

>The conflicts it doesn\'t address (that I\'m aware of) are the TL 14+ weapons
>in EA, the current manufacture TL 13 equipment in CSC; and lastly, the
>dreaded EVA-14 in CSC and Anomolies

True, the theory that the RoM achieved TL 13 does not explain these. But
neither does the claim that the RoM achieved TL 14 or even TL 15. As you
point out, the TL 13 equipment in CSC is of current manufacture and not
from the RoM. The TL 14 equipment in Anomalies are not thousand-year old
relics, they are new, working technology. The seals are fresh, the
consumable material uncontaminated, the power packs newly charged. As other
posters have pointed out they are contemporary and cannot be from the RoM.
However, my theory explains all these weapons, manufacture, and anomalies.

How about a slightly more elegant solution. During the RoM, entire sectors
are thrust into political and economic chaos as the Terrans destroy the
cultural and economic infrastructure of millenia. As interstellar commerce
collapses from the onslaught of pirates and renegade Terran warships,
planets are cut off from their supplies and information. Fusion reactors
and jump drives are cannibalized for spare parts, then fall into disrepair
as replacement parts and technical information no longer arrives.
Technological development slows, then reverses. Planets all over the RoM
slide into the Long Night.

Except one.

One planet, perhaps due to distance, cultural isolation, or advanced
infrastructure, survives the fall of the RoM. Not only does it survive the
Long Night, it prospers. It has the technology and resources not only to
survive the loss of contact with other planets, but to progress. With a
population in the tens of billions, over many centuries it is able to make
the staggering investments necessary to increase to TL 14. For a variety of
reasons, such as a lack of worthwhile worlds nearby and a democratic
government which cannot be responsive to distant colonies, it is not
expansionistic and never becomes a pocket empire (or any form of empire).
However, it does mount the occasional long-range exploration expedition and
resuppy base (my explaination of \'Lock and Loot\').

The Third Imperium\'s first contact with this secret enclave is the
occasional scout report of mystery starships maneuvering at 5 Gs and rare
advanced artifacts with Terran markings found by far-travelling free
traders. At first these are explained as relics of an advanced RoM.
However, the evidence of recent manufacture and inconsistencies in the
reports spawn new theories: theories of an advanced pocket empire; of
secret technology under development far from Imperial news media; that the
RoM never fell and still surrounds the tiny Third Imperium; of a mysterious
\'shadow planet\' of high technology; that Sylea itself is being manipulated
by an advanced alien race which follows its own version of the "Zhunastu
School of Contact"; or a malevolent \'parallel Imperium\' run by opponents of
Cleon who base their power on control of high technology rather than the
nobility.

Any one of these alternatives is far more interesting and has more campaign
potential than "The RoM left a bunch of self-repairing high-tech toys for
dungeon delvers to find and then disappeared". My personal favorite is the
\'shadow planet\' theory, not only because it explains all the anomalies
without breaking canon, but because it addresses my biggest complaint with
Milieu 0.

Milieu 0 is disappointingly unoriginal. All the themes and background
details; the Third Imperium, the Ancients, Psionic Institutes, Pocket
Empires, TL 15 relics, have all been done before by other Traveller
products. However, in no earlier version of Traveller did the Third
Imperium face an opponent of significantly greater technological
development. The Zhodani, Sword Worlds, Solomani Confederation, and so on
were all of comparable technology. The Ancients and Darrians were not
strictly opponents. Adding a single, highly controlled source of technology
significantly in advance of Imperial norms can add an element of
originality to M:0, if done carefully.

Making only a single planet, rather than an entire pocket empire, have high
technology also allows the setting to have some interesting features. All
the interstellar governments in traveller are authoritarian, presumably
because of the necessity to retain control over places with a significant
communications lag. If the high-technology enclave is a single planet it
can be run by a government type, like an athenian democracy, inappropriate
to a large empire. In fact this is very likely, explaining why the enclave
did not expand into space significantly. Since the Third Imperium did not
achieve TL 14 itself for many centuries we know there could not have been
significant trade or communication between the early Imperium and the
high-technology planet. Also, no matter how imposing they may have seemed
in M:0, we know that by M:1100 this single powerful planet had no
significant effect on the Third Imperium and is probably known only to
historians.

Currently in my campaign my players have encountered no functioning
advanced-tech relics. I felt they were too cliche and unbalanced the game.
However, I realize they are now canon and made my best attempt to explain
them in a logical fasion which adds new campaign adveture potential. A
single TL 14 planet existing in M:0 explains the high-tech equipment and
anomalies, is consistent with canon, and provides campaign potential which
makes M:0 a unique campaign setting.

    'from' => 'Simon Early sre@taz.compulink.co.uk',
    'body' => 'Here are some of my thoughts on nobles.

When a plant joins the Imperium, one of the ways it can pay for things 
is by land grants.  A few million sq km of virgin territory can be 
exchanged for access to technology (the Imperial Data Package in 
M:1100) or for a cut of the taxes from mining the asteroid belt - the 
land is worth little to the low tech plant, but hard currency from 
Belters is worth having.

These land grants can then be turned over for exploitation by 
Megacorporations or Nobles.  Imagine a noble being given a land grant 
of virgin territory.

(1) He might offer exploration and mineral rights to SternMetal 
Horizons and others, as was done to exploit the north sea oil and gas 
reserves.  In return, the noble is given a % of the value of extracted 
minerals (either as cash or stocks & shares)

(2) The new monorail link between city A and B could pass through the 
nobles lands.  The noble, an avid fan of SimCity 5431, decides to set 
aside a large tract of his land as the route for the monorail in 
exchange for stock in the start-up consortium bidding to build the 
monorail link.  (compare withe the Channel Tunnel project).

(3) Trake grows very well here, with the likelyhood of some vintage 
years.  The noble offers his land to the sons of a local vineyard so 
that they can start up their own business.  The noble arranges for high 
tech earth-movers to be shipped in for the six-months irrigation 
project.  Again, the noble owns a percentage of the vineyard.

.. you get the idea.


Now, each square km of land may produce nothing or (in an urban area) a 
MCr or more of rental income - if the noble owns the houses / offices / 
etc.  A new noble is likely to be given "untouched land", which 
provides him with no income.  He can use that land, in the ways given 
above, to generate income or as a place to invest his own money.

Take TAS membership as a reference point for investmnet:
TAS membership = 1 MCr = 50,000 Cr/year in High passage and intangible 
benefits = 5%.  (I know High passage is "worth" Cr 10,000, but past 
debate has settled on this 5% figure I believe).

Allow investment in a nobles own land to provide a higher (average) 
level of income - say 2D6% per year?

Allow the noble to sell exploitation rights to others, which will net 
him income based on the following table:

Agri-investment:
     Investment Level (by others)
     1-2 = low      2-3 = Med      4-6 = high
     ========================================
y1   1 per km2      1 per km2      nil
y2   5              10             nil
y3+  10             20             50

Industrial Investment
     Investment Level (by others)
     1-2 = low      2-3 = Med      4-6 = high
     ========================================
y1-3 nil            nil            nil
y4-8 20             20             nil
y9+  50             50             200

After 20 years the industrial investment income may be reduced if old 
plants are not replaces (beacuse it\'s cheaper on that new barony two 
planets away).

either: Roll 3- for each km2 for plant to shut down,
or: assume 5% reduction each year on large industrial areas.

There might be a limit of (say) 1000 km2 for industrialisation in any 
world hex.

Resource Exploitation Investment (sell rights to others)
     Resouce Richness Level
     1-2 = low      2-3 = Med      4-6 = high
     ========================================
y1-3 nil            nil            nil
y4-8 nil             50            100
y9+  nil            100           1000

After 20 years the resources may start to run out.

either Roll 4- for each world hex for income to cease.

I favour working in either km2 or in 20 km (346 km2) "mapping hexes" 
used in World Tamers and world mapping threads passim.



If the players want even more detail than this, give them a copy of the 
Wolrd Tamers Handbook from TNE which considers colony management in 
monthly turns. 


PS: Marc, your km2 per world hex is slightly different from the figures 
in World Tamers handbook, p20.  But I believe that "Marc on the TML" 
has higher ranking canon than TNE data :-)

get an Estate.  I take it that many will, as traditionally,
feudal relationships required provision of armed forces to the
superior by the subordinate; there was sometimes a requirement
that a knight bring with him a levy of several ordinary
men-at-arms.  In the Traveller context, levies would be handled
(generally) on a world-wide basis, by the "civil government"
rather than the feudal hierarchy - although the noble will be the
head of that level of the civil government as well, thus blurring
the distinction.  In many cases, the noble fief will not be "real
land", but rather the right to tax the inhabitants thereof.

Second, there are actually two classes of nobles in the Imperium:
Those who are recognized by the Imperium, and those who are not.
The Soc code in the UPP doesn\'t distinguish between these. =20

Those who are not recognized by the Imperium may be locally
enfeoffed nobles (i.e., Joe Bftsplk is the Bigyump of Podunkia;
on the planet of Moosylvania, a Bigyump occupies the social
position of a Baron, but the title is not recognized off-planet),
or they may be socially/politically prominent citizens who are
otherwise untitled (i.e., Donald Trump is probably at the same
level of social pecking order as a Count; the Kennedys that have
gone into politics (most of the men) are probably the equivalent
of Marquises or better; Bill Gates is probably an American
"Duke").  When one of these nobles/pseudonobles travels
off-planet, their perceived Soc _may_ change - it depends on how
they act while they\'re in a given area - if Bill Gates goes to
Sylea, and behaves as is expected of a Count, and can maintain
himself as befits a Count, he will probably be treated as a Count
in terms of the social circles he moves in, and the respect
accorded him - even though he holds no seat in the Moot, and
lacks many of the traditional privileges of a Count.  The vast
majority of "noble" ranks probably fall into this category -
i.e., they are not recognized by the Imperium.

The remaining minority are those who _are_ recognized by the
Imperium - the ones who actually hold a seat in the Moot (whether
they actually go to Sylea and vote it or not).  These are the
nobles who receive the fiefs that have been discussed elsewhere
in this skein.  These are the nobles whose titles are recognized
and valid wheresoever shall run the authority of the Emperor of
the Third Imperium Restoring the Rule of Man over a Grand Empire
of the Stars.  These are the nobles who, other than knights,
should probably be _DAMN_ rare as adventurers, because they\'ll
have obligations to their fiefs and to the Imperium that will
probably take up most of their time.

I\'ll look it up. My formula was:

World Size in Miles times 1.6 for Diameter in Kilometers.
Diameter in Kilometers times 3.14159 for Circumference.
Circumference divided by 35 for hex size (diameter) edge to edge.
A hex is composed of six equilateral triangles with side equal to diameter/2.

There are 492 hexes on a world (of which 20 are really pentagons).

IIRC, The Spinward Marches Campaign showed two additional fleets, one of
which invaded Lunion, the other probing ineffectivly against the Darriens.

This caused me so many headaches.. I\'d get Tryggvesson to pin down
Santocheev somewhere, and the Gram Fleet would show up with that pompus
fool Riksdatter in charge!  

Wasn\'t there an Imperial admiral who was 0+3?

Their aveage troop TL was 10-11, so I imagine their ship\'s were about the

doubtful to both. Droyne, according to AM5 tend not to be interested in
colonization, and even less so in contact with other droyne worlds.

I couldn\'t give a rat\'s ass whether they are recognized by M0\'s
inhabitants. I\'m upset for a twofold purpose:

1) There are droyne in the vicinity, and Psionics doesn\'t list them, but
does list hivers and k\'kree, and Zho\'s......

2) The book sabatoges those who want to use it for OTHER THAN M0.

C\'mon, guys... don\'t sabatoge those who DON\'T use M0. Because of two
errors, I won\'t buy Psionic Institutes; I borrowed it to see whether it was
worth spending money on. (Error #1 was not labelling psionic and target on
the alien interaction table.)

That declaration was somewhere around 1200 AD, and applied only to the
"western church" (the Roman Rite); the Byzantines never stopped, nor did
the Maronites (in what is not Iran and Iraq, mostly Iraq), nor the Coptics,
nor the ... (etc....)


And it came to a head (according to church sources) when a particular
priest\'s sons claimed the parish as familial property, even though they
WERN\'T priests (er even deacons) themselves.

The pope didn\'t remove/suspend anyone\'s faculties, just barred ordaining
any more married men. In the 1970\'s. the Pope allowed ordaining married
(permanent) Deacons in the Roman Rite; My dad is one.

Note also, that even though the Byzantine rite as a whole never barred
married clergy, within the US, they stopped in the 1850\'s or so, due to
pressure from the Roman Rite bishops. They are now starting to reverse that
trend. The Ukranian Rite refused to give up THEIR married priesthood at
about the same time.

	In keeping with the mythological nomenclature for SDBs, this ship 
class has been named Medusa because the "gaze" of its spinal PAW disables 
vessels without fiber-optic computers.  The ship is intended for customs 
and system defense work.  The PAW is not really intended as a serious 
combat weapon, but for disabling ships that do not respond to 
communications without having to destroy them.  The Medusa carries a 
squad of Marines and 2 Virus specialists which can then ferry across to 
the target vessel to inspect it.  The Marines and Virus specialists can 
also be used to inspect incoming trading vessels that may be harboring 
Virus or carrying more mundane contraband.
	The ship is by no means a mere customs cutter.  It carries 10 
powerful 650Mj X-Ray laser barbettes.  Each one does nearly as much 
damage as a blast from a 200 kiloton detonation laser and at short range 
can cut through the armor of even battleships.  The ship is also 
well defended by a 120AV which will limit the damage from turret lasers 
to only minor hits.  The Medusa\'s 6 sandcasters provide even further 
protection.
	It was decided that the Medusa should be as large as the design
specs would allow so as to conserve on the valuable relic technology used
in its construction.  The relic sensors provide the ship with excellent
coverage; the relic computer is necessary for the use of the sensors and
reduces the required crew.  The backup TL-12 computer is fiber optic so
that the Medusa does not become a victim of its own ploy.  The launch is 
likewise equipped with a fiberoptic computer.

OK, so the Imperium doesnt grant noble estates, but recognises non-noble

(do the numbers on Cattle Class - bunks and low-grade food is 
almost as cheap as low passage). Oh yeah, life is cheap too *grin*.

PS Colonise everywhere in PE. It costs 2 RU and your infra-2 small
colony produces income equal to (on average) half their resource
value minus infrasructure (two) in RU in Resource Export income.
Call the system resources five, thats 1.5 RU - 7500 Megacredits
per annum. Pretty good for 500 people huh *grin*. A quick fix is
to multiply colonisation costs by the Infrastructure Atmosphere
Modifier plus one. Or just trash the Resource Trade rules, or
require that Resources Imported = Resources Exported, within a
Free Trade Zone.

I have been mulling over the possibility of running a Traveller IRC game. 

It would be using T4 rules, set at sometime in some subsector (undecided
right now).

I am an experienced GM but new to IRC, so expect a learning curve.

I could run it pretty much anytime on the weekends and after 8 on weekdays
(the exact time and day will be decided by the player\'s schedules).

I will create the characters based on what each player wants (if you want a
30 year old pilot I will make sure that\'s what you get).

Players must not have read or played "Memory Alpha", the adventure in the
GM\'s screen. Unfamiliarity with the old classic traveller adventures is a
plus, I will probably run some of them.

I\'m looking for 3 or 4 players to start out with.

If your interested send me an e-mail with a general description of the type
of character you would want and when you would be free to play.

I personally don\'t envision nobles getting "land grants" at all. I thought
the Third Imperium only ruled the space between planets and the member
worlds ruled themselves. If this is the case, the only way nobles are going
to get land is by buying it. This is not unlikely, though, since I always
envisioned nobles getting their wealth from corporate ownership. Isn\'t that
the way Cleon got his wealth? Milieu 0 describes Cleaon\'s businesses and
shares in megacorporations, it doesn\'t mention his land holdings. I\'m sure
he has them, they just aren\'t where he gets his money or power.

In my campaign, nobles\' power is economic, and comes from their positions
as major shareholders and members of corporate boards.

Brilliant idea, Roderick. Wealth tied up in non-liquid investments like
starships , starports, and corporations on distant planets could have this
effect. They may also hve considerable funds tied up in long-term contracts
and multi-century leasing arrangements. I like this.

	Thanks.  Gotcha.  Just out of curiosity, what are the actual,
official definitions of damage and pen?  Pen I can see as being x cm of

What does 1 point of damage represent?  How do you go from a given amount
of pen to a point of damage?

Yes, electrolysis is very easy. But 1 MW doesn\'t get you very far -

Every cubic metre of GG atmosphere above the cloud tops
on Jupiter yields about 21 g of hydrogen, which means you only have
to scoop for about 3km to get enough H2 for 1m3 as liquid. If you are
travelling at say, 300 metres per second, then that\'s 10 seconds flight
time.
Gathering the atmosphere is thus easy.

Purifying it is not so simple. 90% of each cubic metre of "raw" atmospher=
e =

is H2, but the rest is mostly Helium. Since H2 and He have similar
diffusion
rates, you have to fractionally distillate the atmosphere to get the H2.
That
takes time and energy.

For ocean refuelling, electrolysis neatly handles most impurities except
those that discharge at the electrode more readily than H2 and O2.

Depends on what country and what age you\'re talking about. In a true feudal 
society some knights would have fiefs (the origin of knights were people who
owned enough land to maintain a horse and armor), others would be maintained 
by a higher noble. In other kinds of setup a knighthood could merely be an 
honor bestowed on someone without the need for upkeep. In post-feudal England, 
for example, a landed knight is called a baronet.

A few square km on a planet several subsectors from the Imperial border
might not be worth anywhere near as much as that.

Those given knighthoods merely to fit them into Imperial society would not get 
anything. Those given knighthoods to reward them for something might get a 
lifetime income of, say, Crimp20,000.

Even if the planet is uninhabited there will be problems. It costs money to
develop a planet. Thus any noble given an uninhabited planet would need to
own a lot somewhere else in order to finance it (Mind you, this is not meant
as an objection; on the contrary, such a setup would be perfect for a PE- or
WTH-style campaign. I merely point out that if someone has _only_ the planet 
then he has problems (Hmm... I suppose he could borrow money at high interest 
rates...)).

This line of reasoning is the prime reason why I worked out the house rules
described in another post. The notion of having 2-3 nobles in each averaged 
sized scool class dosen\'t appeal to me. Remember that nobles \'enjoy high 
standing in their home community\'. That wouldn\'t be the case if they were as 
common as 1 in 12. ("Hey! Don\'t throw that brick, you\'re bound to hit a 
noble!" "So what?")

I agree 100% The true source of power and income is people. Land and factories
are only worth anything if you have people to work them. Mind you, the
relationship is not 1-to-1. Unemployed people is a drain rather than a source.
But on the level of abstraction we\'re dealing with in connection with Imperial
nobles, people is a pretty good measure of power (and TL, of course; and
infrastructure...)

>The Imperium taxes the planets directly, and I suspect the nobles.

I once had a notion that I\'d like to bring forward here: That the main income
of the Imperium comes from the companies they licence for interstellar trade.
Simply put, the price of getting a Limited Interstellar Charter is to give
the Emperor a 2% share of the company (with no compensation; the Emperor can,
and often does, buy more stock in promising companies, but the 2% is for 
free). This is called "The Emperor\'s Share" and is almost never sold (Of all
the companies and corporations I\'ve seen where stock ownership has been 
detailed, only one has not had at least 2% owned by the Imperial family).
Anyway, the dividend the Emperor recieves from all these companies would pay
for a lot of Imperial functions. That means the Emperor dosen\'t need to get
money from his vassals; all he needs is they govern well in his name.

I believe the female equivalent of a Knight is a Dame.


Are you determined to stick to Social C to H being Imperial titles? After all,
in the original rules it was clear that the titles PCs got from the CharGen
system were planetary titles (there were two more levels above duke, prince 
and king, and these were used by actual rulers of worlds). I always considered
it a mistake when that changed. First of all, the gap between the lowest serf 
in the Imperium and the Emperor is IMO much too great to be spanned by a mere 
17 social classes  -  particularily when the non-nobles take up the first ten. 
It creates an overlap between local planet-bound nobles and Imperial nobles.
There\'s an entire slice of society left out of the system. It leaps directly 
from the upper middle class to the Imperial knight with no room for minor 
nobles. Because an Imperial noble is not a minor one. Well, possibly some
Imperial knights are more minor than others. But an Imperial baron on a high-
population world can easily rule more people than an Old Earth emperor. And
never forget that any player who rolls a high starting social status has a 
good chance of winding up as social status D or E (given a judicious choice 
of career and average luck with the die rolls). I don\'t know about you, but I
don\'t really think that Imperial dukes make for proper PCs, unless you play
them as behaving most un-duke-like. I can think of a lot of Traveller
adventures that wouldn\'t work with a PC that had a dozen loyal retainers and
I can\'t really think of a single one (except perhaps for the mercenary
tickets ;-) that would work for someone with a few hundred henchmen. To me an
Imperial noble is a patron, not an adventurer. (_Generally_ speaking. Of
course there can be exceptions. But how many Imperial dukes would you expect
to be bumming around on Free Traders on any given day? Not many...).

I wrote an article on this subject that was published in _The Traveller
Chronicle_ #9. You\'re welcome to mine it for ideas, if you like, or even to 
lift from it directly. If you don\'t have a copy, I can send you an ascii 
version. It\'s too long to post here, but I can give you the gist.

Basically, it claimed that it can be very difficult to compare the precedence
of powerful men from different worlds because 1) comparable levels may easily  
have different names on different worlds (Grand Director, Speaker for All the 
Tribes, Commander of a Thousand Sails, Lord High Syndic, etc.), 2) the same 
titles can indicated vastly different power levels on different worlds (Duke 
of Troura, sovereign a ruler of a few thousand square kilometers of Tirem, 
Duke Lionel du Nord, Regent of the Rheltan Highlands, powerful vassal of the 
King of Caledonia, Duke of Regina, Duke of Deneb, etc.), and 3) some names can 
be misleading (Captain of Alell, ruler of a planet, the Astrogator, his Heir 
Apparent, the Purser, Minister of Agriculture, etc.). It then went on:

"The Imperium had solved this problem by creating the Imperial Office of Arms
(IOA). This was ostensibly an Imperial department for the registration of
heraldic coats of arms and equivalent devices, but in reality their most
important function was to evaluate local titles, offices, and positions and 
translate them into equivalent Imperial social positions. On the
recommendation of the IOA the holder of a given title, office, or position
automatically recieved a knighthood in an appropiate Imperial order. This
just as automatically gave him or her a fitting position in Imperial society.

There were a large number of Imperial orders of knighthood. Some of these,
like the Most Valorous Order of the Emperor\'s Guard (E.G.), the Most Courtly
Order of the Starship and Crown (S.C.), the Most Illustrious Order of the 
Arrow (O.A.), and the various orders of the domains were used to reward 
individuals for service to the Imperium; they were not normally used just 
to grade local planetary dignitaries. For this purpose the most commonly 
used were the Most Excellent Order of the Third Imperium (T.I.), the Most 
Distinguished Order of the Golden Sun (G.S.), and the Most Exalted Order of 
the Star of Sylea (S.S.) (The last should not to be confused with the Most 
Noble Order of the Domain of Sylea (D.S.))."

There was some more about just how the IOA graded a position (The most
important factor was how many people a noble "represented") and some guide-
lines for character generation and for adapting existing characters to the 
system. I\'ll include the tables to give you the main idea:

All modifications are guidelines only. Positions that reach 24 and above will 
almost invariably recieve an Imperial noble title (So the ruler of a planet

Imperial marquis, propably more).

(I introduced \'Freeholder\' and \'Scion\' (with explanations of why they were
hardly ever used) so that if people wanted to stick to the official 17 classes 
of Social Standing, they could still use the material by simply halving the 
numbers (rounding up). That would cause Imperial nobles to have the correct 
Social Standing according to the official system. People would still have to 
device some new way to roll Social Standing for their characters, since now 
the minor nobles would occupy the levels from 7 to 11, so if they rolled SS 
with two dice, they\'d have a society with more than half of the population 
nobles.)
	  
>1. How much income does a hex produce to a noble? Cr1 per sq km? Cr10 per sq
>km?

There\'s an old area measure called a barrel of land. It was, IIRC, the amount
of land needed to produce one barrel of wheat (or something). Estates were
measured in barrels of land for tax purposes. The thing is, a barrel of land
measured differently in counties with lean, sandy earth than in counties with 
fat, moist loam. The value of land depends on what you can get out of it (Or
what you can sell it for, but that depends on what the buyer expects to be
able to get out of it, so in the end it comes down to the same thing). And I
expect there will be plenty of Industrial and Merchant nobles with very little
land but huge stock portfolios. 

I suggest you turn the question around and decide on the income of the noble 
first. To use the system I propose above, take a nobleman with Social 16, the
lowest level with a true fief. He would have a \'base\' of 1000 to 9000 people, 
say 5000 on the average. Say the average yearly production of a person is 
10,000 credits. That would make 5000 people produce about 50,000,000 credits 
pa. Say further that a noble gets about 1% of the production on \'his\' fief
(wether in the form of direct taxes, dividends, rents, apanage, or whatever). 
That would give him 500,000 credits pa, which is about 50 times more than 
an average income. Does that sound reasonable?

Looking at the social levels below 16, an income of 10 times the average for
a squire (SL 12) sounds appropiate. The levels in between (13, 14, and 15) 
would then get 20, 30, and 40 times the average.

Then let\'s say that solid, low-risk investments like land and gilt-edge bonds
gives a return of 2% pa. That means a noble\'s fief, wether it be farmland,
tennement buildings, factories, Megacorporation stock, or whatever, is worth 
50 times his annual income. Afterwards you can decide just what form these 
holdings take, be it a borough of a big Sylean city or an entire planet in the
back of beyond, but the basic value would be about the same.

Of course, not all nobles would have the precise average holding. Some would
be poorer than their peers and others would be richer. How about rolling 2D-2? 
On a result of 1 to 9 the noble gets a fief and income equal to the number 
rolled multiplied by the amounts listed with his social level on the table 
below. On a 0 he rolls again and multiplies by the amounts listed with the 
next lower social level. Similarily a result of 10 lets him throw again at the 
next higher level (Theoretically you could keep going up and down on the table 
as long as you kept rolling 2\'s and 12\'s, but in practise only a few rolls 
would be necessary).

	    Yearly     Value of
	    income       fief 

SL 12        20,000       1 MCr
SL 13        40,000       2 MCr
SL 14        60,000       3 MCr
SL 15        80,000       4 MCr
SL 16       100,000       5 MCr
SL 17       200,000      10 MCr
SL 18       400,000      20 MCr
SL 19       800,000      40 MCr
SL 20       1.6 MCr      80 MCr
SL 21       3.2 MCr     160 MCr
SL 22       6.4 MCr     320 MCr
SL 23      12.8 MCr     640 MCr

The reason why the numbers only double with each level above SL 16 is that
the (for example) 10,000 people of a SL 17 noble\'s fief has to support not
only him, but a number of SL 16 nobles as well.

>2. Can that income be enhanced by development, etc? How?

An abstract system would just allow a noble to invest some of his yearly
income. A noble with a 20 MCr fief would get 400,000 credit. If he only used
half for his expenses, he could invest 200,000 credits and get 404,000 credits
the next year. A more detailed system a la _World Tamer\'s Handbook_ would give
the basis of some great campaigns.

I think we are all still too influenced by the classic European concept of 
feudalism, where land was the direct source of power. There\'s only two ways a
land grant on a faraway world can be immidiately valuable: If the land already
has people living on it (and there are big moral and practical problems if 
that is the case) or if there is a quick, cheap way of getting people to work 
the land. Don\'t forget that moving people between star-systems is a non-
trivial expense.

The crucial question seems to me to be just what kind of feudal system the 
Imperium is. A classic feudal system gives vassals power, in the form of land,
in exchange for fealthy. A feudal technocracy would give vassals power, in the
form of industrial holdings, in exchange for fealthy. But whatever form it
takes, the main point is that the overlord _owns_ whatever it is that gives
the power and the vassal merely administers it (Which is why a feudal system
tends to run into problems when the vassal\'s family has been in possesion
long enough to think he owns it). Anyway, what kind of power does the Emperor 
give his vassals in exchange for fealthy?

I suggest that it is the power of government. And if that is the case, we get
around the problem of ownership of land or stock for Imperial nobles. An
imperial noble isn\'t rich because he is a noble, he has been made a noble
because he was rich. And his \'fief\' is the governance of a continent or a
planet or several planets, not the continent or the planets themselves. That
is what the Emperor has given him and what he can take back again, if he so
chooses.

Of course, the system is unlikely to be quite than clear-cut. Any planet may
have a nobility of it\'s own that _is_ based on land or industry ownership and
any noble given the governance of a planet is apt to invest heavily in that
planet, so established nobles would propably have extensive holdings in their
areas. And then there is the question of public lands. If a noble is given the
governance of a brand new planet then the distinction between govenment lands
and his own private lands is apt to become _very_ blurred. However, land alone
is only worth anything if someone is willing to buy it from you, and with all
the real estate lying around in M:0, unworked land is not going to be worth
anything as much as it is on Earth today.

Finally, there are three whole other groups of nobles than the one that gets
the power in exchange for fealthy. There are the Court Nobles, who are given
a noble title in order to give them some standing with other nobles, and the
Reward Nobles, who get a pat on the back for long and faithful service. 
Granted, most of these would be in the form of knighthoods, but people like 
the Emperor\'s closest advisers would propably get noble titles. And then there 
are the relatives of a \'real\' noble who gets an empty title because their 
parent or spouse is a noble (This class, especially younger children, would be 
the most likely source of Imperial noble travellers, but even they would be 
rare. Remember, Imperial nobles are the equivalent or more of Old Earth 
emperors, and children, even younger children, of emperors seldom bum around 
on tramp ships.)

Anyway, Court Nobles would have an income from the job they were performing,
Reward Nobles would propably get a lifetime pension, but no fief, and
relatives wouldn\'t get anything.

People *like* holidays - the more excuses the Emperor gives them for 
avoiding work and having a party, the more they\'ll love him (up to a 
point, obviously).

Had your PCs been filmed committing a huge number of crimes (including 
possession of obscene firepower and use of illegal psionic powers)? It must be 
10 years since I ran it, but IIRC they tried to murder the host of the show...

    'body' => '  I can\'t speak for the United Kingdom, but widespread opposition to
slavery in the USA dates to well over 100 years prior to its formal
abolition in 1865 (last in the Northern states like Delaware that still
had slavery, by the way, since the Emancipation Proclamation freed those
in the defeated Confederacy before the Constitution was amended to
prohibit slavery).  Most Northern states had either ended slavery or
provided for gradual abolition (by purchase or making all those born after
a certain date free) around the time of the American Revolution.

  Northern states constituted a majority of the population as well - the
oddities of American government organization on the national level
prevented that from being decisive (each state gets the same number of
votes in the Senate, the upper legislative body, regardless of
population).

  Now, it is correct to say that most Americans did not believe that
Blacks were equal to Whites even in 1865 - we\'ve still got some oddball
scientists saying that now.  However, slavery was opposed on moral and
religeous grounds well before the Civil War - it was sectional politics
and the oddities of the American Constitution that preserved it for as
long as it lasted. 

  Now, as for the general question of slavery in the Imperium, well, we
have "canonical" references in this regard (getting tired of that word). 
Question is, why does the Imperium oppose it?  Opposition to slavery on
our own planet is recent and comes from a specific group - Europeans of
the Christian persuasion.  One might note that more slaves were exported
from Africa to the middle east than to the Americas - it was to end the
African slave trade that the British first established the Atlantic
blocade and then joined with other European nations in the carving up of
Africa in the 19th century.  Imperialism in Africa was sold to the public
back at home as a way to end the slave trade, particularly the overland
route to the Middle East. 

  This has some interesting implications for M0, I think - this might be a
nice way for Cleon to sell his policy.  "Those planets that fell victum to
the Long Night have degenerated so far that they even have resorted to
_SLAVERY_!  The Horror!"  Great way to whip up a moral crusade to go out
and expand the Empire, don\'t you think?

	How about giving away the authority to establish and control an
extraterritorial area on a world\'s surface or in orbit for the purposes of
fomenting and encouraging interstellar trade (i.e. the starport)! A fiefdom
of the Regina Downport will probably generate quite a bit of revenue,
whereas the fiefdom of Glisten significantly less so.

	And you have to decide how much the traffic will bear... too high a tax,
and you\'re _discouraging_ trade instead of encouraging.

    No, no, NO!  If you want a proper Richelieu think Charleton Heston! ;) Now
THAT\'s a menacing religious figure.  Besides, for my money the three Salkind
movies with Charleton Heston, Michael York, Oliver Reed, Richard Chamberlin,
Faye Dunaway, Raquel Welsh and Christopher Lee.  Were the best adaptions of
Dumas\'s novels ever made IMO! ;) Go rent them if you don\'t already have them in
your video library.

The T4 rulebook is the "real thing" (how do I know? It doesn\'t say "Starte 
Edition" on the front...) An SE would lose most or all of the character, 
world, and ship design rules, replacing them with a few examples instead. 
Presentation would be better (not a bad thing), but there\'d be less depth.

The main problem with Traveller (probably the one thing I\'d change if I 
could), is that it\'s set too far in the future. Not just a few hundred years 
- - like Star Trek, B5, 2300, etc - but a few *thousand*. Technology and 
society will most likely have changed more than we can imagine.

Zhodani Nobles: arrogant, no sense of humour.

Vargr: certifiably insane party animals! Will generally f*ck, steal, or 
blow up anything that\'s not nailed down. No taste in clothes.

Scouts: see above :-)

Aslan males: stupid, even less sense of humour than the Zho\'s, and 
*dangerous* (quote: "The Aslan just shredded the Engineer." "Why?" "He 
finally found out what \'psychotic\' means..."

Imperial Nobles: upper-class twits with more money than brains.

Imperial Marines: [sound of battle dress, followed by fusion gun]

Hivers: Just too damn sneaky and devious.

Droyne: Cute, but usually impossible to understand.

INI/SolSec/MoJ: MIBs. Avoid at all costs.

IRIS: As above, only more so.

How many \'Christians\' now celebrate Christmas/Easter for religious reasons, and

121 would be around May 1..<g>

Actually, I suggest "Labour Day" to honor all those that labour in support
of our glorious Imperium.  It combines the Terrian traditions of "May Day"

I rather like the idea of basing it on area - that way, you can give some

the same as that friend of yours who owns a plot outside Sylea Down...

As others have said, land grants should begin at C.

ICBW, but the way I\'ve always run it is that a Noble gets a plot of land, which 
he *owns* and can exploit as he wishes, plus a larger area (usually 1 or more 
worlds), which he oversees (in the name of the Emperor) and represents in the 
Moot. These worlds should also be determined here (one or more of them will 
contain his estate(s)).

> 1. How much income does a hex produce to a noble? Cr1 per sq km? Cr10 per sq
> km?

Work out GDP as per PE. Divide by no. of hexes. Allow 1%(?) of this to be kept 
by the Noble.

> 2. Can that income be enhanced by development, etc? How?

See PE :-)

> 3. How many hexes do other nobles get?

C = 1
D = 5
E = 25
F = 125
G = 625
H = 3125

> I envision many land grants being given to nobles on worlds well beyond the

What right does the Emperor have to grant land *outside* the Imperium?

That someone decided to use archic titles to quantitfy measures of wealth is
a happenstance. Like the Kentucky \'Colonels\' who never held military rank,
but always seem to have financial resources.
 
Making someone a Knight of the Imperium would then entail transferring
assets valued at 10,000 MCr to Knight. Those assets may be in stock in
Imperial Business Machines or in a title to a 5 square km area in the
business district on Regina, either way, the Knight is rewarded, and may be
contractually bound by the trasnfer agreement as to what s/he can or must do
with the assets in question.

If you have enough wealth to buy every square kilometer of a planet and then
charge the inhabitants rent to live there, you are as much a Baron as the
medivel varity that got \'rents\' from everyone, free or serf, within the
boundaries of their land.

But your processing system has to dump the waste (unwanted material) faster
(*) than you scoop it, or you will over-pressure the fuel tanks, and
"bang".

So you may be able to scoop very fast, but all the other gases have to be
accounted for in a buffer store. How do you process this separation in
time? A slower rate may be preferable to avoid problems associated with the
.


(*) or at least as fast.

Just thinking about the practicalities of scooping large volumes of gas
giant atmosphere in short periods, and processing them. It may be
completely off track.

	Ok... back in 1971, David Lee was a McGill engineering undergrad.
He got a summer job working for a company that did soil sampling, who had
contracted with Hydro-Qu=E9bec, Quebec\'s hydro-electric utility, to do some
work on a massive hydro-electric project up north in James Bay.

	Mr. Lee\'s and the crew he was part of were based at this base camp
way hellandgone up in the boonies.  Every day, helicopters belonging to
another Hydro contractor, Trans-Quebec Helicopters, would fly them out to
the various sampling sites, they\'d take soil samples, and at the end of the
day be flown back to base camp.

	Anyhow, late one afternoon, the soil samples having been taken, Mr.
Lee, with a backpack loaded with samples, headed towards the waiting
helicopter, whose rotors were turning, to be ferried back to base camp.  He
approached the helicopter from the rear, ducked under the tail boom, and
somehow managed to stick his head into the tail rotor.  Poor Mr. Lee was
instantly decapitated.

	However, he had been wearing a hard-hat.  And his hard-hat-encased
head severely damaged the helicopter; it was out of service for several
weeks.  So Trans-Quebec Helicopters sued Mr. Lee\'s estate for the damage to
the helicopter and lost profits while it was out of service.

	 They won.  Basically, they established that Mr. Lee had acted
faultily, ignoring basic safety precautions and several previous warnings,
and that his negligence had caused the damage to the helicopter.  In Quebec
civil law, civil liability is not tort-based; you just have to prove fault,
damage, and a causal link between the two (sort\'ve like the tort of
negligence, IIRC).  So they collected.

	It makes brilliant sense, although intuitively, the whole thing is
kinda horrible...

    'topic' => 'Nobility, Landgrants and the Imperial Government',
    'body' => 'The question of how the Imperium handles land grants is trickier than it
first appears, for several reasons. On the game mechanics side there is
the question of whether players should be allowed to roll up characters
as powerful as Imperial Nobility. Then, in game terms, there is the
mechanism the Imperium (or the Emperor) grants land, and how much is
granted.
Last there is where does the land come from, and I feel this part of the
question relates t how the Imperium is governed.

On the game mechanics, I handle nobility in my campaigns in two way,.
"working" nobility, that is nobility actually involved in the government
are ALWAYS NPC\'s. The power inherent in that category is not meant for
human players (at least not mine!). These characters cannot be rolled up
by players, and a PC\'s Soc. score doesn\'t elevate the character to this
occupation. PC\'s that are rolled as Nobility (CT) or that receive a Soc.
score granting noble rank are 1) the issue of \'working\' nobles, in line
to receive the title, 2) Younger issue of \'working\' nobles, not directly
in line for the titles, but you never know... The titles issued to these
PC\'s are "honorary", they carry respect, sometimes awe, but not real
authority. "mustering out" benefits are either allowances, or (in the
case of younger issue) can be inheritances. Land grants are not an issue
in these cases.

A third type of PC noble is the "dispossessed", possibly by some action
in the PC\'s past or by political intrigue. In these cases the benefits
received are  "what they got away with". The titles aren\'t real, but
SPACE is big and... well, you get it. Land grants aren\'t a consideration
in this case either.

I have mentioned the above on the assumption that Marc asked the
original question about land grants with the idea of a Character
Generation System for Nobles in mind. As you can see, if this is the
case, I oppose full blooded, working PC Nobles. I think that any
character with the power of a "working" noble doesn\'t belong in
Traveller, may be a game played on a grander scale ( a take off of
Pocket Empires?) or something, but in a normal PC party see it as being
totally unbalancing.

Now to more important issues, how does it really work in the Imperium!

How does the Imperium govern 1000\'s of worlds, each with it\'s own form
of government? Does an Imperial noble or governor issue orders to the
elected president of a world (Gov. # 4) or to the CEO of the controlling
comany/corperation (Gov. # 1), who odes he give the orders to if there
is no government (Gov. # 0)? If the Imperial nobles are doing this then
all of the Government numbers on the UWP\'s should be changed to 6-
Captive.

In my conception of the Third Imperium the Imperial government operates
in a "hands-off" fashion as far as the planet\'s internal governance. The
Imperium\'s concern is the space between worlds and the traffic through
it. That requires a fleet to police and protect. Fleets cost money, and
lots of it. Therefore when a planet enters the Imperium it agrees to be
taxed to support the Imperium. That is the responsibility of the
Nobility, to see that the Imperial government receives the taxes it
needs.

When a noble receives a "grant" he/she receives a specified territory
over which he or she has the responsibility of assessing and levying the
proper taxes. The local government, if there is one, has the
responsibility of collecting the actual taxes and delivering them into
the nobles hands. In the case of a lack of local government, the noble
must maintain his/her own tax collectors. Naturally the noble\'s
authority to assess the tax rate is backed up by the Emperor (and the
Empire\'s Fleets). In return for this the noble receives a specified
percentage of the levy to maintain himself (herself), his/her staff, and
family. Obviously it is in the interest of the noble to see that the
territory of his/her grant is productive!

In the rare cases that a noble overtaxes a territory several things can
happen. The local government can petition to next highest ranking noble,
someone higher in the chain can discover that the noble is collecting a
higher percentage than his/her grant allows, civil unrest in the
territory, or the productivity of the area can fall off. Any of these
things can cause the unpleasant occurrence of an Imperial "fact finding"
investigation, with the unpleasant repercussions that usually follows.

So the grant isn\'t actually a land grant, it\'s more like an
administrative region. The Emporer (or His/Her representitive) issues
the grant, specifying the extent of the territory, and the percentage of
income.

With this in mind the extent of the territories are flexable. Typically
I use the following guidelines:

Knight/Dame = typically a several thousand square kilometers, villages,
states or, possibly countries depending ofn the governmental make-up on
an agricultural planet, a city or two on an industrail planet.
Baron/Baroness = can call a continent to a planet his fief, dependant on
the wealth of the territory involved.
Count/Countessa = usually a multi-Baronial system or and extremely rich
planet.
Marquis/Marquese = control the taxation of sub-sectors, or VERY rich
solar systems.
Duke/Duchess = sectors are the feif for a noble of this rank, on
occation, usually if there is a MAJOR trade route involved, a
Duke/Duchess will receive a sub-sector as a grant.
Archduke/Archduchess = are in charge of non-specific territories,
typical very wealthy, important or hard to control areas that require
special attention.

An interesting side line to this system is the absentee grant holder. In
a number of cases the noble receives his or her grant, forms a staff of
trusted administrators and sends them to the granted territory. In the
meanwhile the noble stays near the Imperial court and collects his/her
grant.

A noble\'s "household" will consist of a large number of administrators
and accountants. Most will have a bodyguard contigient, as would any
rich person, as well as personal staff, maids, butlers, cooks, etc.

Well, that\'s how I see it. Thanks for listening.

The Imperium directly rules the space between the stars. Its vassal states

   The convention was well attended, and is the second largest such
event in the U.S., GenCon being the largest.  The facilities at the
Columbus, Ohio site were superior in many respects to those at GenCon,
particularly when it came to the gaming areas.  The vendor area was
somewhat smaller than GenCon\'s, though it was not insignificant by any
means.  All of the major game producers had some kind of booth, and
there were a number of smaller producers on hand as well.  My
understanding is that the organizers of Origins have committed to be in
Columbus every year until at least 2002, for those who would like to
attend next year.

   IG did not have an official prescence at the convention, nor were
there any IG staff present (at least I didn\'t encounter any).  There was
one Traveller game on the schedule.  The referee used the T4 mechanics
with some modifications to run a post-Collapse scenario.  Everyone
participating had fun.

   I think it would be to IG\'s advantage to send someone to this
convention next year.  I\'m puzzled as to why they didn\'t this time
around, since the convention is so large.

It is (IMHO of course) typical for the technologically conservative to

Remember that the Vilani has had jump so long that most people doesn\'t
think about jump-drives as technology anymore. Do you think book/reading

Some t4.1 product like this would appeal to me. A full rules edition, with
rules in one booklet, Charts, Tables, etc in another, and a third with a
decent introduction to Traveller, a couple of GOOD t4.1 compliant
adventures (CLEANED UP FAR BETTER THAN T4\'s adventures in the hardcover),
and a starter subsector or two, with a price tag of $20. Yes, make them all
the cheapest damned things you can put out, but in a NICE box, and include
the required number of dice, and a few blank character sheets. Maybe a
sheet of "Cardboard Heros", too! (1 sheet, 8.5x11" cardstock, 4-color

<b>Telepathic Skills:</b>Any human or Ithklur psionic attempting to use
Telempathy, Project Emotion, Project Thought, or Probe on a hiver
automatically subtracts two stages of success. This is due to the
difficulty in understanding a mind that has developed along a very alien
evolutionary path (see page 249 of the basic rules).
<i>telempathy:</i>other than the loss of two stages of success, this skill
works with hivers as describe on pages 249-250 of the basic rules.

<i>Probe:</i> Psions attempting a probe of a Hiver\'s mind will encounter
the same difficulties in understanding an alien mind as are involved in
Telempathic Contact and must subtract two stages of success.
<i>Assault:</i> Assaults do not require the sophistication of probes, and
need not take the alien nature of the mind into account. This skill works
with hivers as described on pages 251-252 of the basic rules.

Since it shows that two stages of success are lost, effectively, it
increases the difficulty. It does not prevent the attempt. In fact, it
explicitely ALLOWS the use of telepath against Hivers.

In order to get minor nonhuman races into the Imperium I think the absolute
conviction that slavery is wrong sends a strong message from the Imperium.
Think about it from an alien perspective: The green skinned licard kings
come in their migthy spaceships and ask us (with a slight undertone of
threat) to join their glorious empire. All their emperors have been humans
but they say they\'ll be nice to you. Your younger population has read a lot
of pulp-SF and warns against the ensuing slavery but the Imperium at least
upholds the absolute principle of NO slavery.

Think about it; Would you want to join an interstellar empire totally alien
to you that says slavery is a local matter that has to be decided on a case
base case basis - I think not.

One of the sickest comments on the list. Do you even for a moment believe
that the creators of our universe has resorted to such crude methods?
Bring on the blueshifted asteroids, accelerated with heplars and
thrusterplates with american flags all over them created at TL 17 by RoM.
On the other hand - those frac-c rocks might be pretty harmless as you\'ll
get no more than 3D6 of damage from them - the rest is blowthrough ;)

    'body' => '1) What is the difference between Basic and Standard Life Support?

Basic life support: lights, heat, canned air/filtering. Short-duration
Standard life support: Basic life support, plus the ability to purify
and recycle both air and water. Moderate duration (weeks).  I am told
there will be an Extended Life Support/More variety of life support in
FF&S.

2) Do you need life support if you are in a G-Tank?

Yes. All the habitable spaces of a ship must be provided with life
support; it\'s not "included" in the G-tank or anything else. Most
standard designs simply provide life support for the entire volume of
the hull.

Someone else responded: "Only if you want to stay alive." :)

3) How many lasers can you put in one turret? (Couldn\'t you put up to 3
in a turret before?)

One. 

Another another was, create your own in FF&S and stick as many in a
turret as you can.


4) Why does armor take up internal volume?

Because armor consists of matter, and all matter occupies volume. You
pick
an overall volume for the hull, and everything goes inside it. 

	If you choose, you can put the armor on the outside, but then
the overall
volume of the hull goes up and you have to recalculate everything,
because
jump drives and maneuver drives depend on the TOTAL volume of the hull.
We
considered an idea like this during FF&S2 design, but it\'s much simpler
the
other way. 

5) A suggestion on finding the Armor Rating:  According to the Errata
at: 
http://www.spirit.net.au/~jamesd/Trav/SSDS/Errata.html, 

	Both SSDS and CSC are superseded by FF&S2. Sorry, folks, but
there were
some major disconnects between the two systems which could NOT be fixed
without invalidating something. SSDS armor was created for the
abominable
ship combat system created for the original T4. CSC\'s armor rating
system
was irreparably broken, and couldn\'t be salvaged either. Guy Garnett did
some fancy magic to keep penetration and armor values the same for
personal
equipment, but FF&S2 uses a linear armor system similar to FF&S.

Note:  The different material toughness factors are already figured into
the volume factor.  So, TL 14-16 hulls are assumed to be made out of
Bonded SD.

 
6) Are there more efficient thrusters for later tech levels (15+)?

Not in SSDS nor in the first volume of FF&S2

Another answer was "Ask the Ancients." :)
 
7) What does the Accomodation: bunk allow for?

Just that--a bunk and a small storage area for personal effects.
 
8) When would you need launch tubes?

	If you wanted to rapidly launch ships out of a hangar. A normal
launch
port (IIRC) can only launch one ship every so often. You could put lots
and
lots of launch ports on the ship, but that eats up all your surface
area. A
launch tube is optimised for pumping out lots of ships.

Another answer was:

	Launch tubes allow you to launch fighters or whatnot faster than

a simple launch port.  In Traveller: The New Era, you could launch one 
ship per half-hour from a launch port and 10 from a launch tube (IIRC).

A third answer was:
Launch Ports: 1 boat per round.
Launch Tubes: 40 boats per turn.
Source T4.0 rule book page 119.



9) How would you create a fixed arc laser (sort of like a spinal mount
laser)? 

	Buy FF&S2 <G>. Or pull out your copy of FF&S--all the weapons in
SSDS were
designed using FF&S, and FF&S2 is heavily derived from FF&S, although we
tried to add a *few* improvements without adding too many more bugs.
 
>10) Can you fire a ship\'s weapon multiple times/round?

	Most weapons already fire multiple times in a *ship* combat
round. For
simplicity, you don\'t roll for each shot, the combat systems (all of
them,
I think) assume that multiple shots give you a better chance of having
at
least one shot hit. The Rate of Fire, or ROF, for a weapon is the number
of
shots it fires in a 30-minute combat round.

Another answer was:
	Your weapon is already firing multiple times/round.  If you mean

can it fire at more than one target, that depends on the combat system 
you\'re using.


And last, but not least, some comments:

As an SSDS Newbie, I think I need to warn you of a few things:
	- SSDS was created EXTREMELY quickly. The GDW-Beta list was only
given a
single week, and playtesting was severely lacking.
	- Other early T4 works broke the ground rules under which SSDS
and future
design systems were supposed to be created, hence the disconnect between
SSDS and CSC (for example)
	- FF&S2 should be available Real Soon Now, and tries to create a
single,
consistent design system for all vehicles, whether land, air or space.


One last thing(really this time!), a couple of examples of figuring
ships armor:

  Lets take the example of a TL12 200td Streamlined disc with an armour
value of 40.

  Volume Factor: 0.77
  Armour Level:  40
  Material Cost: 0.014
  Mat. Density:  15.0

  Armour Vol= 0.77*40 = 30.8 m^3
  Armour Mass= 30.8 * 15 = 462 t
  Armour Cost= 30.8 * 0.014 = 0.4312 MCr

  This of course has to be added to the internal structure figures
(which are
calculated the same way) and airlocks to get the hull cost, mass and
volume.

  Now, for comparison, lets take a TL8 version of the same hull.

  Volume Factor: 1.80 (Note the difference to the figure above)
  Armour Level:  40
  Material Cost: 0.008
  Mat. Density:  8.0

  Armour Vol= 1.80*40 = 72 m^3
  Armour Mass= 72 * 8.0 = 576 t
  Armour Cost= 72 * 0.008 = 0.576 MCr

  Then we have to get the USP. Look up the USP table. A value of 40
translates to a base USP of 2. Multiply this by 10, and we have a final
USP of 20.

  So what have we got. An armour with a USP of 20 at TL12 (Superdense)
weighs 
25% less and costs 34% less than its TL8 (Composite Laminate)
equivalent. The 
TL8 version will also have less room for \'stuff\' in the final hull.

<OOC MODE ON>

Ok, so you want to know what happens when you jump in jump.  This question 
has baffled the minds of Old Fogies and relative newcomers alike.  Basic 
answer is this:

GM\'s Perogative or \'When the GM Smiles it\'s Already Too Late!\'

This is where the GM can have some fun, J-space is mostly unknown ground, 
damn little cannononical references to how \'exactly\' jumpsapce works and 
what it is.  It is only known that j-drives work.  Although MT\'s Starship 
Operators Handbook does give an interesting description of J-space, but it 
does state that not even the best J-space physicist understands what exactly 
is going on, one reason why there is the J-6 limmit?

Anyway, when you fatutz(good Yiddish word, means to screw arround with) with 
the  drive, however it is done, you are inviting a misjump.  You can have 
the standard CT/MT effect of a missjump: BOOM!, Jump 6d6 parsecs in a random 
direction, or arrive ealier or later than expected.  There are also other 
\'wierder\' X-Files,MIB,FNORD! Effects you can whip up.  ;->  (The GM is 
smiling!  We\'re doomed!)

Sure, have the effects exponent themselves.  The PC\'s discover a new Jump 
meathod.  Unfortuneately, it was a fluke, and cannot be repeated in any lab. 
 An unkown variable (power, grid configuration, a small particle of 
\'something\' hit the grid at some time, whatever) was what caused the 
success.  You can be realy E-vil and have the ship go boom next time they 
try the experiment.

How about they open a rift to one of Grandads Pocket Dimensions?  And they 
have to find a way out, but not they way they came!

One word: Wormhole

Two Words: Time Travel!  This I actualy did to a smartass engineer character 
who did exactly what you stated, he hooked up 2 j-drives together. 
 Unfortuneately the year was 1137 and the world was Trin...

Neadless to say the virus got into his j-drive and caused a massive 
missjump, he jumped to j-3 space, then to j-9 space then to j-27...etc...The 
virus program caused a recursive loop that just sucked more fuel from the 
HePlar Tanks untill the time barrier was broken.  And soon he was slingshot 
70 years into the future.

Hey, I know this was handwavy, but what better and spectacular way could you 
have old MT characters come into your new TNE game?

You sure you dont want to play in my up and comming (eventualy) IRC game? 
 The Planet X Adventure? ;->

And now for a "me too" post: Stephen\'s right on this one. The early 70s
versions of the Three Musketeers were excellent. I nearly wretched when I
saw the cast for the Disney remake a few years back. When Chris O\'Donnell,
who played D\'Artagnan in the remake, was asked if he had read Dumas\' novel,
The Three Musketeers, he replied, "No, but I love the candy bar." There
went my respect for him.

Related topic: I had a history professor in college who referred to
historical figures by the actors who played them in movies as sort of an in
joke. I recall suppressing my laughter as some of the students struggled to
find any references to "Cardinal Charlton Heston" in their European History
texts! <g>

The ships jspace bubble suffers and imbalance and breach due to hull
grid asymmetry, allow a dreaded JUMPSPACE INCURSION.  Mutations occur,
causing one of the crew to turn into a monster who then terrorizes the
rest of the crew.  They finally kill the monster by activating the 2nd

They decide not to try that again;)

>I\'m no expert on vehicle propulsion systems, so maybe someone can tell me what would happen if my characters had no choice but to put something like hi-grade aeroplane fuel into a current car with a standard combustion engine.

High grade aviation fuel is known as JetA in the biz, with an additive
called PRIST thrown in for anti-icing for temperqatures in the 40,000\'
range of -50F.  It is basically kerosene with additives, and from what I
remember that doesn\'t work too well in an internal combustion engine.

However, in every airplane I\'ve flown, there are provisions for
so-called  alternate and "emergency" fuels.  These are always petroleum
based, and are usually avgas or even common automotive gasoline.  Even
the big jets can fly on these for limited periods of time.  However
there are side effects.

Primarily the damn stuff may not light off or may have odd effects on
start(read "engine torch" or explosion.)  Once you have the engine
going, it may not burn the fuel evenly because the fuel density is
different and it isn\'t the stuff the fuel control was designed to meter.
You are also susceptible to flameout due to poor performance, especially
during throttle changes, and due to the fuel icing up because you forgot
to poor a can of PRIST in with the stuff.  These fuels also foul the
engine after extended periods of usage.  

As for kerosene in cars, I dunno.  However if the car is powered by a
jet turbine or like device (THX1138) it will probably perform like
above.  The root problem is the fuel control system isn\'t designed to
use any fuel-it must have "its" fuel for peak performance.  Even an
inherantly more energetic fuel probably will just make the thing work
worse-it can\'t harness the extra energy cause the hardware isn\'t
designed to.

BTW, as I understand it, avgas and gasoline are A LOT more refined than
Jet A or JP8(current USAF fuel.)  Any other suggestions from the
braintrust of the TML?

Um, well, I was looking at an upper bound for thermal splitting, but 
electrolysis is probably easier...

Well, *this* decade Faraday\'s constant F = 96485 C / mol -- it\'s the 
charge carried by 1 mole of electrons.

The energy consumed in an electrochemical reaction is therefore:

number of moles x F x energy per coulomb

the latter term of course being the electrode potential for the 
reaction i.e. the voltage you need to slap across the cell to get 
your reaction to go.  If you use the autoionisation of water to help 
you, you can get away with 0.4 V potential, I believe, if you use a 
standard hydrogen electrode and a sensible cathode at which to do

4OH- -> 2H20 + O2 + 4e-   (E\\std = 0.4 V)

OTOH, standard enthalpy of formation of water = -285.83 kJ / mol
(at 298K, 1 atm, admittedly)

i.e. Delta H for H2 (g) + 1/2 O2 (g) -> H20 (l)

so if we just assume a 100% efficient reaction (ha!) at 1 MW for 6 
hours, amount of H2 n is

n = 10^6 J/s * (6 * 60 * 60) s / 285.83 x 10^3 J/mol

  = (2.16 x 10^10 / 2.8583 x 10^5) mol

  =  7.557 x 10^4 mol H2

  = 152.3 kg H2

  = 2.1 m^3 of L-hyd/6 MW-hours

*cough* No, it isn\'t, is it?  Oooops.  Sorry, TML.


> > The FF&S draft gives 0.01 MW to purify 1 m^3 LH2 in 6 hours at TL8.

I now make that 1/2.13 = 0.469 MW.  And this is, please note, the 
absolute minimum energy for the reaction, assuming it all comes from 
the powerplant.  It\'ll work better at higher temperatures/lower 
pressures.



> Is this correct ? Can FF&S ][ be so wrong ? If so, I will think long
> and hard before buying it.

No-one\'s ever noticed it before, because we\'ve all blithely assumed 
that since the energy gained from fusing hydrogen >> energy to 
electrolyse it, power won\'t be a problem.  How embarassing.

If we consider a H2/O2 fuel cell which does this reversibly, it would 
require 6*2.13 m^3 H2 per MW-hour output; FF&S 2 has a TL7 hydrocarbon 
fuel cell use 3 m^3 of (much denser) hydrocarbon per MW-hour, which 
is very much in the same ballpark.



There is a possible way out.  If we assume really, really good 
catalysts, you might be able to do this kind of thing at the 
temperature of (say) your fusion powerplant cooling system.  But then 
we\'ve just invented a fuel cell which can be charged by the hot 
fusion exhaust...

While Drac made the occasional point, he went far beyond just complaining
about the fundies and misinformation.  He attacked anyone who professed
even the slightest religious belief, made false claims of harassment to
ISPs, and called for a purging of religious players from gaming.  

As anyone who reads r.g.f.m knows, I enjoy a good flame war, but Savoie
went beyond the bounds of anyone\'s acceptable behavoir.

The British Empire abolished slavery in ~1830; presumably there was 
widespread opposition to it for some time before then.

How does it compare to the book? I thought that was okay, but rather 
derivative (specifically, of /A For Andromeda/ and some of the bits that ACC 
left out of /2001/ (see /The Lost Worlds of 2001/)).

Some are, some aren\'t. The Prince of Wales makes a fairly comfortable income 
from the Duchy of Cornwall. I *think* his mother is still the world\'s richest 
woman.

One point you\'re ignoring is *why* give them land? Money. A noble keeps a 
fraction of the tax generated by his land. If he wants more money, the 
easiest way is to develop the land. Both he *and the Emperor* then receive 
more money. Plus, jobs are created, trade improves, and the Imperium grows a 
little bit more powerful.

I heard on the news today(!) that somebody is selling Pluto, too.

Actually, I think the TML should buy up the whole solar system!

Presumably, one condition of joining the Imperium is that a world turns

True, but then Terra is an above-average world - larger, Rich, and HiPop. 
An average world is size 5, thin atmosphere, with a pop of 500,000 and not 
much of a Starport. Much less desirable.

Hee hee hee! This reminds me of a "I swear it\'s true\' story of a friend of
mine. He and his brother owned this old crapped out Ford station wagon
with a flathead engine (this dates it to about the early to mid-60\'s).
Along comes an idiot, wants to drag race them for pink slips. Why not,
thinks my friend. That night he and his brother dump a copuple of boxes of
mothballs into the gas tank of their old wagon, giving it enough time to
dissolve.

The next day they go to the race, and lo and behold, thier old flat has
become this fire breathing (literally) monster drag car. They got the
idiots car, sold this \'amazing\' hotrod for $500, and got the hell out of
there. They later heard that the engine died comletely about a half mile
later. 

All it had to do was last a quarter mile...;-) 

Jet fuel, however is another story entirely. since it\'s closer to kerosene
than gasoline, dumping it into an IC engine of the wrong type means it
won\'t run at all. You might be able to get a diesel to run on it, and
almost certainly get a two stroke to run (I have done this), but a modern
4-stroke is right out. 

Dropping high test Aviation gasoline into a car is another thing entirely.
If it is a high performance vehicle that naturally liks high octane fuel,
it may well do ok, as there\'s little difference between this and stuff
like 120, 130 and 150 octane racing gas. In a normal car you\'ll probably
have severe precombustion problems, and in worst cases you\'ld probably
blow your heads pretty quickly.

Dropping diesel into a gasoline powered car is a way to completly $@#!$ up
your fuel system, as a number of angry customers of a gas station near me
found out, when a tanker operator accidentally put diesel into the
unleaded tank at the station.

Cost that tanker company thousands and thousands of dollars.

There have been attempts, notably by the military, to develop a
\'universal\' fuel, with varying results. They had one, called JP-8, I
believe (or maybe it was only a universal aviation fuel, but I\'m pretty
sure they were running trucks on it, too) which has some nasty lung
toxicity associated with the inhaled vapors.

Speaking as a practising (trying hard ;-) !) Christian, I\'ve always found
Easter is a more \'religious\' festival than Christmas, which has become an
orgy of consumption and commercialism.

Not quite the charge sheet you describe - I think the charges were
\'extortion\', \'attempted murder\', \'conspiracy to commit an act of piracy\' oh
yes - criminal damage....... but not the psionics. In 14 years of playing
Traveller, I\'ve only had one or two psionic players... (strange but true!).

In the UK this is happening at present (since the Church of England Synod
voted to allow women priests). Several members of the Anglican Clergy have
been accepted into the RC faith since, and are married.

Slavery was bad for business and the new economy based on heavy industry
and wage relationships, rather than agriculture and reciprocal work
relationships.  For this reason, the industrializing nations led the
movement to abolish slavery in the 18th and 19th centuries.

Same here. I\'ve been playing since 1981 and have seen exactly one
psionic character. That one was an NPC I deliberately threw into a
scenario. She was stuck in a jail with the PC\'s and teleported
out. Imagine the look on their faces when they saw that!

Why waste money on these things, they are just a joke, they have

Its the same thing with paying some company to name a star after

do it for you, just do it yourself.

   I\'ve always handled this discrepancy by saying that fiefs are
   actually starports.  The noble then gets his income by taxing trade
   that passes through that starport.  The fief\'s income is then used
   to:

   A) Maintain the starport and all its many facilities.
   B) Keep up a government bureaucacy at the starport offices/manor.
   C) Maintain some armed forces as per the lord\'s feudal obligation
   	obligations to his liege.
   D) Provide a personal salary to the lord, which varies according to
   	his rank.

   I like this arrangement because it gives the noble character some
   real power, but keeps it in a fairly limited sphere (inside the
   extrality line) so that he is not all-powerful everywhere he goes. 
   It also gives the character some significant resources, but keeps
   them tied up in the starport\'s infrastructure. (His liege may take a
   dim view of his requisitioning starport military personel and
   equipment for `adventures\'.)  So outside the starport, the lord\'s

I agree with Stephen and Chris that the Heston/York/Reed/Welsh/etc version
was the best I\'ve seen, but I also think Curry did a very good job as
Richelieu in the Disney version.  Of course, when was the last time Disney
ever didn\'t screw up a story\'s plot.

This is more of a slogan that discribes the Imperium approach

"Psionics and Society" (programme 3 in the series "Psionic Institutes"),
first broadcast 023-044 at 16:30IST on the IG EduTainment Channel:

Dear sirs,

While I appreciate your efforts in bringing the vexing Psionic Question
to the attention of a largely-oblivious Imperial public, I must protest
most strongly about the biased nature of this programme.  The
EduTainment Channel\'s charter specifies that it must "make every effort
to [...] present a balanced picture"; your presentation failed to
conform to this policy.  In particular I would like to bring to your
attention the following points:

1. The 4 1/2 minute "History of Psionics" section early in the program
   was blatantly pro-psionic.  This is self-evident; the final sentence,
   stating "The promise that psionics holds is bright, and the benefit
   to mankind, without end", is just one example of many.

   This in itself is fine, provided that other views are given equal
   standing.  *However*, labelling the response "An Alternative View"
   and allocating it only 3 minutes clearly demonstrates the true
   intention of the programme makers.

2. This response - the *only* anti-psionic piece given significant
   airtime - was chosen from pre-recorded works of a radical fringe
   group.  The Thought Protection League does *not* represent the
   opinions of the normal, rational majority who oppose psionics.  I can
   only conclude that the programme makers chose this piece in order to
   set up a "straw sophont" position, since they considered their pro-
   psionic arguments too weak to defeat a rational opponent.

   Please note that no material was presented from the viewpoint of
   Psionics Now!, your own extremist wing, which could have made the
   pro-psionic position look bad.

3. Why does Shela Jeshop continue to be invited on these programmes as
   an objective authority in these matters?  Her own bias should be
   obvious, for instance when she says of the Psionics Club\'s attempts
   to promote psionics, "*Unfortunately*, [...] progress has been very
   slow." [Emphasis mine]

   Her accusations of Psilence "spin-doctoring" to present only negative
   views of psionics are particularly ironic, given the overwhelmingly
   pro-psionic slant of the media today.

4. Towards the end of the programme a brief piece on "the Psychological
   Effects of Accepting Psionics" was presented.  I have a great deal of
   respect for Dr. Cycyowski, and sympathise with the frustration he
   must have felt as his article was butchered on air in an attempt to
   squeeze it into less than a minute.  I was not surprised to see that
   no mention was made of his later works, wherein he presented the
   results of further research demonstrating the vanishingly small
   chance of so-called "balanced" societies developing.

If necessary I can present a more detailed list for your perusal.  I
hope that the remaining programmes in the series will redress the
balance, but I am not hopeful.

I remain,

Yours faithfully,

Dr. G. Nisaka

Couple that with this months scientific american...there\'s an article in

I passed this question to to Professor Davros. His response was that, most
likely, the artificial gravitational anomaly producing the first jump effect
would stablize such that the effect would become self sustaining. He called
it \'pocketing\'.

The other result, of lesser probability, is that the second jump effect
would simply move whatever is inside it to some random location totally
irrelevant to either the initiation or termination points. \'Wheresoever the
theoretical gods so will it\'.

    'body' => 'Having just completed a set of characters using the new T4.1 Character
Generation table, I feel that I am able to say that I have changed my
mind about the utility of skills breaking the 6 barrier.

Without using the current task system (or the proposed one) yet, I\'m not
sure that the system will balance but the range increase is ideal.

We used to play traveller as having 6 as a skill max and so being an
expert was not too hard and you could still be well rounded with plenty
of highish (range 2 to 4) skills.

Now, however, we find that 10 or higher is the _BEST_ you can be and
that the 2 to 4 range is still fairly common.  This seems to mean that
previously players tended to be expert in one or two fields (and I mean
expert) with a few at a professional level.  Meaning that they could get
jobs doing these things (A really Good Engineer could often hire on a
perfectly adequate Pilot).

Now an expert tends to be restricted to one area and may be professional
quality at one ot two other things but tend towards adequate for
personal use at ecerything else.  Meaning a really Good Engineer could
fly a ship but would find his piloting qualifications lacking in the
open job market.  He can fly perfectly well but is not really job
quality in a competitive sense.  Of course, nothing stops him from being
hired because he interviews well (sigh!) because he can fly well.

To use a generated example we rolled up a Doctor/Merchant using T4.1

After Attending University and Medical School this doctor had a skill of
10 in medical, 3 in computer and a smattering of other skills.
Attending Technical School (which maybe should be called Advanced
Engineering College or something) saw a few point of electronics and
some other stuff.

Just using the skills I have mentioned, Computer 3, Electronics 3, and
medical 10 we can see that this guy is a really Good Doctor but is not a
computer programmer in a comercial sense but he can certainly cut code
and try the odd hack.  His electronics skill means he could be expected
to build and repair prostetic devices (even Cyberware) but would make
the finest cyber eye available (merely a well implanted one).

As an aside, it would be nice to see a set of rules (ah la Space Opera)
that gave good guidelines to using teams to develop or build devices.
After all because a Cyber Eye is available at TL X doesn\'t mean that
one\'s been built yet (take Fusion Plus as an example) or that they are
commercially available.  While a medical 10 character can\'t build one he
might be able to enlist the aid of a high Electronics professional to
gain assistance.

They didn\'t show up at Dragon*Con either.  Dragon*Con is the *largest* 
sci-fi convention in the Southeast US, with the *best* publicity (i.e., 
*highest* amount of media coverage).  It\'s been advertised/covered in 
newspapers, magazines, and radio.  It\'s attendance is measured in the
*thousands* (about 8k, last time I asked them).  

The funny thing is, when I sent a message to IG asking if they\'d be here,
they said "Yes."

In part you are right Deadeye, JetA or JP8 is kerosene with a number of
additive, but there is also a High grade aviation fuel for reciprocating
engines (props). In the case of Jet a standard automotive engine
probably wouldn\'t run, spark plugs don\'t fire hot enough to start
combustion, a deisil engine on the other hand would probably run
alright. In teh case of aviation fuel (prop type), a normal auto engine
will run, VERY well... for a short time. Then it\'ll need to be torn down
for an overhaul. At the least the valves will be burnt, probably you\'ll
find pistons with holes n them, bearing problems etc. Av fuel burns much
hotter than normal gasoline.

No!  No!  You *almost* have it right, the time travelling aliens did spirit
"The King" away, but the Pyramids were built by Jim Morrison, not Elvis. 
They were supposed to be large breasts, but he got carried away and
couldn\'t stop.  Ancient Egyptian teenagers kept sneaking into them to make
out, so he stuck a few dead bodies in them an spread the mummy rumors. 
Elvis, OTOH, went into genetic research.  He\'s the one who developed the

I think this is still a good rule of thumb.  If Med-3 is a doctor, Med-6
is super-ER-trauma-brain surgeon.

I tend to disagree, albeit slightly.  In using the task system in the T4
book with the campaign I started last week, high characteristisc trump
high skills.  The guy with a C stat and skill-1 is more likely to be
succesful at difficult tasks than the guy with a 7 stat and a skill-4.

Ok, I\'m new to the list, and I don\'t know exactly what T4.1 is (is that
T4 plus errata?) but I don\'t see you you can get Med 10, even if picking
your skills in college and med school.     Medical is a Science cluster
skill.  Unavailable as a background skill.  College give 4 skills, which
could all be Med, giving Med-4.  Medical School gives 4 skills, which
could all be Med, resulting in Med-7.
     The Med benefit of "Minimum Medical-3 skill" is a _minimum_ for med
school greaduates.  My interpretation of that means, that anyone who
graduates Med school gets Med-3, i.e., they are a competent doctor, even
if that character did not roll (or pick) Med skill as part of their "one
per year" skills.  This means that you could get 4 non-Med skills
(spread between Research and Administration) and still get Med-3.
However, I think this benefit should only accrue to those who roll their
skills, otherwise players would pick 4 non-Med skills and end up with
Med-3 anyway.  Sure, if you roll Med 4 times, you might think you
\'wasted\' three rolls, but thats the danger and benefit of rolling
(potentially, Med-3 Research-2 Admin-2, potentially, Med-4).

Again, by my interpretation of the Med School benefit, this isn\'t
possible.  All university and med school slots would have to be Medical
and while Computer-5 is conceivable from background skill and common
skills, nowhere is there any potential for a technical skill like
electronics.

   Incorrect.  True enough, attempts were made to restrict the growth of
slavery throughout American history (the articles creating the Northwest
Territories, constitutionally mandated ending of the Slave trade with
Africa in 1800, the Compromise of 1850), and some states did ban slavery
within their borders.  **However**, the vast majority of people in the
North (the Northeast and Midwest U.S.) had no particular problem with
someone in the South (Southeast and South Central U.S.) owning slaves. 
As far as the majority of the population of the South was concerned,
slavery was a Constitutionally guaranteed right (true, which is why a
Constitutional amendment had to be passed later to abolish it), and
slaves the personal property of their masters which could not be
deprived from them by the central government.

   Widespread opposition to the institution of slavery in the U.S. dates
from the release of the book "Uncle Tom\'s Cabin" by Harriet Beecher
Stowe in 1852.  The book thrust into the public eye the worst of the
abuses that were occurring to slaves at the time.  While its "Oliver
Stone" treatment of the issue has since been criticized, it drove the
point home for many people in the North that slavery, regardless of its
justifications or where it was being practiced, was wrong.  After 1852,
abolitionists grew dramatically in political power, frightening
Southerns and causing further division within the country.  With the
election of Abraham Lincoln, a known abolitionist, to the U.S.
Presidency in 1860, the South concluded that in order to protect slavery
(the basis for much of its agriculture-based economy), it had to attempt
secession from the U.S.  The result was the American Civil War.

Amazing the folks you meet on this list.  I\'ve got a problem-our T-37\'s
keep flaming out during the winter months due to fuel control problems.
It is titanically dangerous, because depending on the phase of flight
you can end up dead( especially with a no nothing solo student alone and
unafraid when he/she/it should be.  The tweet\'s ejection seats ain\'t to
great, and I was wondering if you had a take on the JP-8 problem.  Right
now guidance has us retard only one of our throttles below 65% at a
time, just in case one dies:/

In my understanding, the flamout/relight problem occurs because JP-8\'s
flash point is higher than JP-4.  It also causes smoke on start up that
occasionally causes our crew chiefs to mutate into hideous monsters. 
Which we despose of with jump drives.  And electricity.

A little clarification here,  Catholic Church has a sub-organization 
called rites,
vast  majority of  Catholics you encounter are latin-rite, with 
celibate priests.
However, there are other rites such as Ukrainian, Marionite(as in 
Lebanon)
and one in Iraq, whose name escapes me at the moment,(basically 
orthodox
in ritual, Catholic in  theology) that have always had married 
priests. To handle
married  former  Anglican/Episcopalian  priests, and a few parishes 
that
defected over the last decade or so, a special "Anglican" rite was 
created,
that allows for a married priesthood in that rite.

Getting back to traveller,   Depending on  how the 19th Vatican 
Council came
down on the issue of Non-Solomani Human Salvation, there could be a 
Vland
Rite, with rituals more meaningful to Vilani.

Of course, if the  later Council of Dragusharr,  came out in favor of 
the possible
salvation of  all  sophonts,  we might even have a Vargr Rite,  which 
brings to
mind an open midnight mass under a FULL moon, with gregorian chanting 
 taking
a whole new direction----   :-)

	*Nod* In 10 years of playing Traveller, I\'ve had only one psionic PC 
in my group - and even he was only a mere Telepathy-6 or something. 
Came handy in one adventure though.

	He was playing hide and seek in an abandoned farmhouse against 3
crack hitmen (armed with ACRS IIRC), and he only had his 9mm Magnum
and 6 rounds. Too bad for the bad guys, he used psionics to detect
lifeforms, then pinpoint them, and shot them in the head one by one, 
right through walls.

	That was ugly. :)

None of the above. Fuel is expended, and ship misjumps badly. At best, it
totals the second JDrive.

According to MTJ, anything which jumps from within a ship in J-Space
catastrophically misjumps, never to be found again.

Now, linking them together, amking a Staggering Engineering/Computer task,
and triggering them together, you\'d get J3... (EFG) (each is 2% of hull; J3

T4.1 is a beta set of documents that Marc Miller has made available to

I used to agree completely but having a longer range for experienced
enables a professional rating to be attained without being one or two
levels of the best possible.  An open ended range may cause Munkinism
but also allows the creation of those special exceptional characters
with very high skills in something (the famous for it type) while still
letting normal people succeed when they try harder stuff too.

Yeah - Stats should not rule skills - but thats another thread and I do
_NOT_ want to get involved.  I want to keep what little support I can

The new Med school in T4.1 gives a level of Med every year of attendance
(5 years) and also has medical appear three times or so in the skill
rolls table.  So it certainly is very different from the original T4.

Medical School and University are different in T4.1 (Better? - I do not
know but I think so) The electronics skill came from a quick visit to
Technical School (which requires a BSc or BA to attend - Should be
called something else) which is predominantly technical type skills.

    'body' => 'Nobles are a curly one.  After all what is too much and what is too
little.

The idea of players tending towards being Honour Nobles seems best
(especially at the start of a campaign) but the rewards of serving the
Imperium can be great.

And being an Honour noble still makes you part of the Imperial Nobles so
some form of Income or reward is deserved even for these Honour Nobles.

Part of all Nobles responsibilities should be the Imperium itself.  The
worst sin a Noble can commit is to let the side down (Actually to be
caught letting it down).

As these are Imperial Nobles I think that should be held seperate from
the Constitutional Monarchies and the such that rule worlds themselves
(although they me be a part of such but not in their Imperial Capacity -
i.e. the King of Such and Such is also an Imperial Baron).

As Archdukes control (or administer) an entire domain a Duke should be
responsible for perhaps the administration of a subsector and be
responsible for the collection of Imperial Taxes and Levies (somebody
has to) in his region.  This is a responsiblity passed down to his
Counts, Marquis, Barions and Knights of the subsector.  The senior Duke
in a Sector is also the Sector Duke and has additional duties such as
the overseeing of the Imperial Navy Sector Fleet.  These Nobles incomes
would be fairly large but they have to pay for lots of stuff themselves
and pass a fairly large portion of the tax take up the line.

An Honour Noble may be provided with a stipend of Cr5,000 per month
times [Soc - 9] to maintain standards and be required to pledge
alliegience to the Emperor and perform some ceremonial duties as
required (not too onerous - it is the next to ultimate reward the
imperium can bestow).

An Imperial Noble has to collect taxes and levies for the Imperium.
Each level of Imperial Noble is assigned a fief based on
population(tax).
A knight may have a fief thats a portion of a planet (or a local
government on a balkanised world) with a population around 5 or 6.
While a Baron\'s fief may have an entire world with 1/2 of it subdivided
into Knights fiefs and the remained administered by him, with a
population of around 7 or 8.
A Marquis may have two worlds, or one larger world of pop 9 and would
have some Barons and Knights Subinfeudinated under him.
A Count would have a large pop 10 world or two or three pop 9 worlds.
The Duke Personally holds the same as a Count but also takes
responsibilty for the entire subsector.
The Sector Duke(senior subsector duke (in terms of fief or Imperial fiat
- - not age)) and Domain Archduke are responsible for administering
Imperial Funds (at the direction of the Emperor) and funding all
Imperial requirments.

Factored all costs in and simplifying I woudl think that Imperial (or
Landed) Nobles would get in the pocket as it were around 0.1% of the Tax
take of the fief(excluding sub fiefs) to spend on their own adgenda.  A
formula based on POP digit and TL would be best if Pocket Empires isn\'t
used. 

With regards to pocket empires,over time the Noble ranking of a lord
will increase as his fief increases in population.  In fact each major
holding could be considered a pocket Empire with a portion of it\'s tax
take being syphioned off to Imperial Funds and personal pockets of the
Noble (fractions of an RU personally normally).  The Imperium is able to
supply money to a fief for units or facilities that are to be imperial
at no extra cost for off planet investment.

SUMMARY

Imperial Nobles are collectors of Imperial Tax and administrators of
Imperial Power.  Each to their own but all have at least the
responsibility to collect Imperial Levies as set by the Emperor in their
fiefs.  Usually, their cut is sufficient to live a life of luxury and
often they have significant lands and properties on their fiefs.  This
is not required and their personal holdings may be spread over several
worlds and subsectors.  However their responsibility is not spread at
all unless they hold other fiefs.

Count Halth may hold two Baronies, three knighthoods and Honour Noble
Duke status earned in the Imperial Navy in addition to his countship.

Depending on his current duties he would have different titles.  With
any of his land holdings (Countship, Barony, of Knighthood) he would be
known as Count Halth.  However for public events such as Grand Balls and
the such he would be Duke Halth.

The trick of course, is to know what title to use and keeping upto date
as a Noble can bestow a title he holds onto another either in perpetuity
(or until stripped by a council of peers) or just for the life, or
duration of appointment, of the holder.

Remember the Imperium is going to get pretty damn big and the Emperor
just doesn\'t have the time to administer all the little bits so he will
have to parcel it out to underlings.  The final arbiter of all Noble
Titles and the only creator of such things would be the Emperor (perhaps
along the lines of "Archduke....create two thousand knighthoods in your
domain...reserve 500 for me to dispense and dispose of the others
yourself." - perhaps not.)



The life of a minor noble can be tricky indeed.

I\'ve looked at a series of simply formula\'s but they get pretty complex
to keep a Dukes Income relatively low (say MCr 200 per year) while a
Knight can earn a reasonable living ( say MCr 0.35 per year).

The abolition of slavery in the British Empire, while not actually 
trivial, came at a time when slavery was relatively uncommon in 
Britain itself and <cynicism> called other things elsewhere in the 
Empire </cynicism>.  It was more important that the ban extended to 
dealing in slaves, thus making it illegal to supply e.g. the US 
market.

The individual whose name is associated with the abolition, William 
Wilberforce, was one of the notable Christian social reformers of the 
19th century in Britain.

Folks, 

I\'m not much of a conventioneer, but what do you think of picking some
medium sized convention next summer for us to focus on?  Really, have a
strong Traveller presence?  GenCon is too big and so is Origins, but
something like Dragon*Con might be about the right size.

What do you think?

Ha! I know *humans* that like to stick their heads out of the window while

However, that\'s not saying much for Easter, really, is it?

Still, it could be worse: no-one\'s suggested a Pentecost Barbecue 
yet.  (Actually better for St, Lawrence\'s day, whenever that is: St. 
L. was allegely martyred on a griddle, his final words being "This 
side is done, turn me over and eat!"  Apocryphal but a wonderful 
line.)

Ash Wednesday is usually fairly religious, if downbeat...

Haven\'t the faintest idea... if so, they would be refinements on the 
charge of the electron, presumably:  F = e N_A which Atkins Physical 
Chemistry 3rd Edition (1986) -- and the 4th edition IIRC -- give as

e = 1.60219 x 10^-19 C
N_A = 6.02205 x 10^23 /mol

and F = 96 484.6 C/mol

which is (broadly) consistent.

  This seems a bit optimistic. By no stretch was there significant
public outcry against slavery until after the Napoleonic Wars. Slavery
was determined to be illegal under British law _in the UK_ in 1772,
but there was no outcry against the American South or Russia, etc.,
until much later.

  The connection between modes of production and slavery seems
forced. Slavery is hardly a reciprocal relationship, and there
is little evidence to suggest that most aspects of an early 
manufacturing economy couldn\'t be run using slaves. The Russian
move to eliminate serfdom was part of broader economic reforms
and political maneuvering. Relatively skilled heavy industry
would not have to be the underpinnings of an export economy
in this period.

So, a new world cedes to the Imperium perhaps 1% (5 hexes) of the mainworld
surface, 20% of each of the secondary worlds (either specifically, or as
options if the worlds are unsurveyed or unsettled). It gets half of each
planetoid belt.

The Imperium doesn\'t want all. It does want some, so that when it encourages
development, other areas are developed as well. There is enough incentive for
everyone.

Ceding land can be as

Starport. The holder is the ultimate owner/stockholder for the local Starport
authority.

Land. The holder actually owns the land. I expect feifs like this can\'t be
sold, but can be leased long-term.

Fees in lieu of taxes. The land generates fees (property taxes that go to the
holder) which are then use for maintenance, support of the holder, and some
to the Imperium.

Rights. Mineral or exploitation rights that can also be sold or leased out.

The precise mix is negotiable depending on local circumstances.

Not every noble has lands. And some lands aren\'t worth very much. And the
idea is that most nobles will work to improve or exploit their lands and
everyone (locals, the noble, the Imperium) will benefit.

     The absorbtion of new worlds by the imperium in M0 and the enoblement
of their leaders may work like the policy of Surrender and Regrant, pursued
by late Tudor government in Ireland as a means of bringing the Gaelic
nobles into the British fold.
     Basically, Surrender and Regrant worked like this - O\'Neill of Ulster
is a Gaelic lord, ruling large tracts of land and with many vassals owing
him fealty under Irish Brehon law. Elizabeth I wants to subdue Ulster and
reign as sovereign, and the easiest way of doing this is to make a deal
with O\'Neill. The deal is, if O\'Neill presents himself at court, renounces
his title as \'The O\'Neill\' of Ulster and the Gaelic system under which he
held that position, and swears fealty to Elizabeth and all of her heirs and
successors, she will make him Earl of Ulster under her legal system and
regrant him all of the lands he currently rules over under her sufferance.
     O\'Neill has avoided inevitable conflict with an overwhelming military
power and Elizabeth has gained Ulster with a minimum of cost and bloodshed.

Footnote: This is not the way things turned out in 16th/17th century
Ulster. There was much cost incurred and blood shed by both the Gaels and
the Englishry before O\'Neill and others submitted to Surrender and Regrant.
O\'Neill and the other Gaelic nobles then chaffed under the constraints
imposed on them under English law and in the end they fled to Europe never
to return - this was romantically labelled \'the flight of the earls\'. The
English immediately brought in their own nobles and citizens to colonize
Ulster (this was known as the Ulster Plantation).

Diffusion rates in *what*? I\'ve read of purifying tritium after long
storage by diffusing it thru palladium. That seperates the tritium from
the He3 formed by decay.

Like chlorine? NaCl solution electrolyzes into H2 and Cl2 leaving
behind NaOH. Other salts will do similar things.

Well, signal strength gets to be a big issue. I figure that you\'d need

If you use the fact that hydrogen will diffuse thru *solid* materials
(especially under pressure), you can likely have a scoop that narrows
to a throat where a high pressure is reached (encouraging diffusion)
and then widens out again letting the gasses escape. 

You\'ll have a constant flow of hydrogen and *no* buildup of other gasses.
The flow rate of hydrogen will depend on the pressure, and the
diffusion rate (which can be pretty high for some materials. The fact
that the gasses in the channel get heated by the compression (and thus
heat the walls of the channel) will *help* the diffusion!

Y\'know, I think I\'ve just come up with a *workable* scoop design!

I\'ve decided to use "lun" (pronounced "loon"). It stands for "Local
UNit" but also makes one think of "lunar" the way "sol" makes you think
of "solar". True, the size relationship is backwards, but it still
makes for a memory aid.

That gives us this these units:

Imperial	local

year		ano
month		month
day		sol
hour		lun
min		centilun or minute which works better

Since there are no scientific or engineering units based on month, it\'s
ok to have the meaning be uncertain. But year, day, hour, and second
are all apt to cause *real* trouble if the sizes aren\'t fixed.

And if the length of the local day is such that *three* shifts make the
most sense? Or six? Those get messy. 

Being able to pick the number of luns in a sol makes it easier to match
local conditions.

At best it\'d knock like crazy (the fuel will "pre-detonate", that is,
explode while the piston is still mocving up on the compression
stroke). You might even break it. It\'ll also run a lot hotter. Which
will overload the cooling system.

Internal combustion engines are *very* picky about fuel. One trick that
*will* work, but that your players may not know about is that household
heating oil and diesel fuel are the same thing! Several times we ran
out of heating oil at one house and had to go buy a couple of ten
gallon cans at the service station to hold us over until the oil
company could refill the tank.

If you get a little diesel mixed with your gasoline, the engine will
smoke badly and run poorly if at all. Also tends to put bad carbon
deposits in the engine.

External combustion engines (steam) are less picky. Ditto for
turbines. As long as the fuel "injectors" are adjustable enough to
handle the fuel, it\'ll work.

Heck, if you have a "hot fusion" reactor, you can *thermally* "crack"
water into hydrogen and oxygen. Use the water as a step in cooling the
reactor and at even *low* plasma temps water dissociates.

Actually, electrolyzing water that has a significant amount of salt in
it gets you hydrogen and *chlorine* with NaOH being left behind! That
can be a *real* pain to deal with, as you wind up with a *solid* (or at
least *highly* concentrated solution).

Not really. For example, there is a ceramic that acts as a *solid*
electrolyte, and passes oxygen *through* itself, generating electricity
in the process. You can purify hydrogen letting it diffuse thru
palladium. Heat the palladium a bit, pump a vacuum on one side and have
the gas mixture on the other. The hydrogen will diffuse thru.

I\'m sure that something that does this fairly rapidly can be found.
Heck, a lot of the research into storing hydrogen in zeolites and the
like amounts to discovering materials that\'ll do just this!

So getting the hydrogen seperated is easy. Seperating the isotopes
could be handled by repeated diffusion (protium will diffuse fastest,
tritium slowest)

	Well, yeah.  Exactly.  Civil law civil liability works much like
common law negligence writ large; assault, trespass, and so forth are all
seen as being faulty, or ngeligent, behaviour and the fine distinctions
between them are seen as basically irrelevant.  Legal niceties aside, I\'ve
found that laypeople tend to be either horrified or amused by that one...

Actually, by the time we reach the TNE/T4 era, Traveller starships require
only moderate amounts of fuel (tens of cubic meters) to power starship
plants for a few years. This is certainly more reasonable than the CT/MT
requirements, which were very very very large. Whether it\'s more accurate
than GURPS depends on the details of your fusion reactor and how 
efficient it is - though GURPS values seem too low even for perfect fusion
reactors.

There is no truth to the rumor that Vargr like to drive cars with their heads

1850s.  While it is true that _Uncle Tom\'s Cabin_ was a major literary
success, popular opposition to slavery dates to well before it\'s
publication.  Note that the American Constitution contains a clause that 
forbids the Congress from banning the slave trade for 20 years, a cluase
inserted at the insistance of Southern delegates - when the time limit was
up, the trade was immediatly banned.

  Now, the question here is how do we define "widespread."  Given that
debates about the expansion of slavery were central to American political
life from 1800 on, I\'d have to say that opposition to the institution of
slavery was widespread in the North (and to a lesser extent in the South
early in the 19th C, before social pressure silenced opposition).

  Now, as to how Northerners felt about slavery in the South, well, that\'s
a harder one to answer.  Since we don\'t have opinion data from polling,
It\'s hard to say exactly, but given the extrordinary efforts made by those
in the South to prevent debate (censorship of abolishionist literature, a
gag rule about the discussion of slavery in the Congress, and so on), it
seems there was a strong strand of anti-slavery sentiment that Southerners
thought would lead to the banning of slavery thoughout the USA.

  It is correct to say that radical opposition to slavery increases in the
1850s, due to revelations about the conditions of slavery, but to say that
this is the first evidence of such popular opposition is clearly wrong.

  To get back to Traveller, this has a couple of applications.  First, as
far as history goes, there is always room for interpretation.  When you
tell your players about Imperial history, make sure that they all don\'t
see things the same way, or that they come across folks who see the past
in a different light.  Was the Rule of Man good or bad?  How exatly did
the Terrans defeat the First Empire?  Making the answers multiple and
subject to discussion makes for a more rounded view of the setting, and
more importantly allows room for conflict and character definition.

  Second, the mention of _Uncle Tom\'s Cabin_ sets up the idea of the use
of literature and motion pictures in the game.  How nice to change society
not by the sword but by the pen, and having a character expose some great
evil by portraying it in a work of fiction sounds like a nice plot twist.

Yes, isn\'t that a reasonable upper bound for the cost of splitting 
out a mole of H from H2O, assuming you don\'t get back any of the 
energy from cleaving the bond in a usable form?

It makes all the difference in the world - they are different
quantities!  96485 J is the energy required to pass a mole of 
electrons through a potential difference of 1 volt.  

Oh, perhaps you mean the difference between 96485 and 96487 -- yes, 
that *is* pretty negligible, as you say.

Higher temp. increases the entropy of H2 and O2 gases over liquid 
water, which in turn decreases the EMF needed for the electrolysis.
Assuming one lets the H2 and O2 bubble away, pressure won\'t be a 
factor.

I was actually thinking of a thermal cracking of water at this point, 
since electrolysis is so darned expensive in power.

Oh, you\'re still talking about electrolysis.  Um, well, what you use 
as an electrode can rather alter the EMF of a half-cell, which is why 
electrode potentials should be given with the electrode type.

But I was thinking solid-state, pass-it-over-and-maybe-heat-it-a-bit

I dunno, we\'re always looking at ways of cooling ship emissions and I

often)...

required for a jump.

A possible theory is that is not used for fuel at all. It is used to
create a NormalSpace bubble in JumpSpace.  If we assume some sort of
attraction/repulsion (N-Space is attracted to N-Space), the bubble is
pulled back into N-Space a week after entering J-Space.  You would have
to have more material to go farther in J-Space.  (The material would
lose cohesion over time maybe?)

I\'m picturing something like a thrown football, with the ship basically
inside the ball. :)

This is a great adventure hook.  Anybody know what the secret of GPS,
the Global Positioning System, is?  Its accurate timekeeping.  The
system would be usless without some of the best clocks ever built.  It
may be relative but it is relative to US.  And therefore not
meaningless.

Controlling an accurate, non-drifting time source information is
critical to commerce and war.  Technologically everything runs off it,
so your "prime source" had better be a good one.  

My Traveller campaign, we originally used Reference as the focus. 
However, Reference was not the DGP version, rather a very young pulsar
(less than 2000 years old.)  It had a definate spindown rate, albeit
small, and was used as a central 3D astrographic pint as well as a
timeclock.  No better signal than that.

Otherwise the Imperial Standard time broadcast with heavily defended/not
so well defended repeaters could be used.  

Now, what about spectral shift of the signal due to relative stellar
velocities?  That would affect its time component, skewing the
"universal" time.  Any suggestions?

Challenger\'s fuel was LHyd.  The hull didn\'t help them much:(

Realistically, current space vehicles actually have relatively thin
hulls to save on weight.  I\'d guess a ship that can survive gas giant
refueling pressures can easily survive a large explosive pressure wave.
That\'s what I\'ve assumed in gameplay.

The missile hits the hull, explodes and creates a hole. If the world\'s
atmosphere contains significant portions of oxygen, then the fuel
tank section would be exposed to that oxygen and to the energy created
by the explosion.

The liquid hydrogen would be heated to gaseous temperature (assuming,
of course, that the ambient temperature is high enough) and would
react explosively with the oxygen. However, because the fuel tank has
baffles (that\'s why you only lose 10%, not all of your fuel), the
explosion would be relatively small and would quickly fizzle as the
hydrogen is consumed.

I\'d say that the result would be intense flames, a scorched hull
and perhaps a slight alteration in ship course.

I had an artist friend do some illustrations for my old MT game, mostly
equipment/ship illos.  I gave the stats/description for a Vargr warship,
and he bvrought me the drawing the next week.  When I enquired what a
blister on the side of the ship was, he replied that\'s where the pilot
sticks his head out the window!

I kept it.

You will know peace and happiness from reading this book, and will achieve
oneness.  If you have already achieved oneness, this will help you along
with achieving twoness.

Pilgrams will come to your door on the rumor you possess this book, your
players will not kvetch about buying your sodas, and will put up with the
triple pepperoni pizza you are so fond of.

Oh, and it\'s also one of the best looks at the people behind the whole

Chris Foss artwork.  (3 out of 4 ain\'t bad)

See you tomorrow Suz.... :)

The target world is balkanized world, you wish to take over control.

3.It states that if you take over a world you get half of its resources

4.If world is taken by the Tech Offensive do you have to take each
government as in the balkanized example.

5.If a world is taken using the Tech offensive Meta Task what is the Target
world\'s government code the same as before or what like a six?

6.Under the Technology Offensive page 73 under Special Conditions:
This meta task can only be attempted if the TPE is atleast 2 levels lower
than that of the PE, or if the TW Tech Level is at least 4 levels lower
than that of the PE.

This refers to TPE(Target Pocket Empire) and TW (Target World) but the
results are all referring to TW. From the above quote it would seem that
you could use a PE of say one world and attempt a take over of a TPE of say
3 worlds.

8.What effect would the TPE Tech level have on a task against a single
world in that TPE?

        I think that a direct hit would lead to an explosion at the point of
impact, which would be the skin of the target- er, trader.  The result would
be a lot of expensive hardware scattered across many miles of planetary
surface.  There wouldn\'t be a leak, per se- the explosive force would hole
the tank, then heat, oxygen, and hydrogen would mix- and boom, all in a
millisecond or so.
        I can see one way around the problem.  AAM\'s often have proximity
fuses, detonating the warhead within a certain distance of the target.
(There is a British AAM designed specifically to detonate on proximity, then
the explosion drives a number of steel darts into the target in a
shotgun-like pattern.)  The proximity fusing allows for an increased chance
of getting a hit with the missle, and damages the target with concussion,
shrapnel, and heat.
        Suppose then, that the wild trader in question only receives a
proximity hit.  Shrapnel could hole the tank (with a lessened chance of
detonating the fuel), or it might simply sever the fuel feeds (leading to a
very rapid leak of pressurized fuel).  Alternately, the concussion of a near
hit might rupture one or more fuel seals, which begin to leak under
pressure.  If you wanted to be especially cruel, the seals could be inside
the hull, leading to pressurized hydrogen leaking INTO the ship\'s spaces.
Not to mention the fun of keeping the ship under control while flying in an
atmosphere.

It\'s amazing how many people independently came up with that
explanation. It must be a good one :)

There was a thread a while back called "Hydrogen Bubbles" which
discussed this theory. Check the TML archives or email me for details.

If I ever get any <expletive deleted> spare time, I\'ll update my
Jumpspace site to include this theory, because I think it\'s a good
explanation for the vast fuel usage, and the requirement for Hydrogen.

The Challenger\'s hull was nowhere near as strong as a Traveller
starship hull. A standard Traveller starship hull takes 40 hits
(MT rules) before a breach. That\'s 40d6! The Shuttle, after all,
ain\'t made of bonded superdense alloys!

Besides, the Challenger didn\'t explode. It was engulfed in a fireball,
yes, but that\'s an entirely different thing from a physics point of
view. If you engulf your Traveller starship in a firewall, you could
hold contests to see which crewmember stops yawning first!

Well, to be fair, Challenger\'s LHyd was sitting next to a LOx tank that
got punctured at about the same time, with two giant solid-fuel torches
strapped to the side for good measure.

Much of what happens is dependent on the speed at which the starship is
flying, and the altitude at which they are flying. If the tank is simply
holed by the AAM, you\'ll have a huge leak of H2 into the atmosphere, which
still needs an ignition source to set it off. Near the leak, the H2
concentration is too high, it won\'t ignite until enough air has diffused
into the H2 stream to reach combustible levels.

Of course once that\'s set off you\'ll have a giant torch in the sky, but as
long as the ship can keep flying faster than the flame front, it won\'t
explode.

If the tank explosively decompresses,, on the other hand, the structure
of the ship is probably damaged to the point of it\'s being unable to fly.

In any case, I\'d much rather NOT be on that ship ;-)

LOL!!!

It must feel funny to have 200+ fans hanging on every word, waiting for
canon pronouncements from on high...

Call me a heretic, but even though Marc is the orginator of Traveller, I
have gotten the impression that he does not want the entire
responsibility of hammering out the Traveller universe to rest on his
shoulders. I give his comments the same weight as any other published
source...

I applaud his efforts to encourage feedback on what he\'s working on, and
the manner in which he allows fan written and supported material to be
disseminated without hoary copyright lawyers breathing down our necks.

When you finalise the T4.1 release can you put in a few pages on conversion
of current T4 characters to the rules? It should make things a lot easier
for any new refs who have just started playing, and want to use the new
rules, but don\'t want to change/abandon existing  player characters.

A section on converting from CT/MT and TNE would be nice too... ;-)

Wild tangent-Lets go with the theory that jumping in JumpSpace takes you
to a different JumpSpace.  The likely cause for explosion is that you
don\'t have a sufficient "Bubble of Matter" to protect you.  Instead of
Hydrogen, maybe a different type of material is necessary for cohesion
in this separate realm?

If this is the case, here\'s a jump scenario:

1) Activate Jump-3 engine (Hydrogen bubble is created)
2) Activate second Jump-3 engine
  a) Material X bubble is created
    -Option 1) More of Material X is required (has to cover the volume
of the H2 bubble)
  b) Second H2 bubble is created
    -Option 2) H2 bubble has to be recreated upon re-entering
(normal)JumpSpace. (Or else ship is shredded wheat.)

We can extrapolate that since JumpSpace^2 is further from NormalSpace,
it would have the effect of squaring the Jump number. (A jump 3 becomes
a jump 9, jump 4-Jump 16, etc)

We\'ve been discussing the possibility for some time that *all* the human

I disagree, mostly because of play balance.

In space combat, a laser blast certainly has as much oomph at point of
contact as a AA missile would.  It likely has a heck of a lot more, so it
is not unreasonable to assume that fuel breaches into the inside happen
regularly.  (Note: a civilian laser turret is a 75Mj laser, which is
something like 75 times a tank\'s main gun!)

If the hull could not protect, at least partially, from such a blast, then
almost any fuel hit would be a disaster for the vessel.  For whatever
reason, they are considered more of a free hit, so we need to come up with
a reason for that to be the case.  I have two possibilities:

1.  The LHyd is stored in a gelatinous matrix that can release it
reasonably fast, but not immediately.  As a result, a fuel tank hit leaks
out to space over the course of minutes.  In addition, the matrix prevents
the tank from getting any air in it.

In atmosphere, therefore, a hit would produce a hell of a plume, some
serious scorching, and a flare visible for miles.  It could damage the
ship, and if it was a big hole, it might release enough to cause a good bang.

Alternative 2:  When the fuel leaks out, it is not mixed with air.  It will
mix fairly rapidly, but the ship is (hopefully) moving fast enough to avoid
at least some of the fuel-air explosive effects.  After all, if I recall,
you can escape the area of effect of a propane tank valve blowing off, as
long as you are in a vehicle moving away when it is touched off.  IIRC,
FAEs are not big on overpressure at any given point, but do produce a wide
area of effect at a reasonably high pressure (anyone know for sure?), so
the blast would cause a serious jolt, significant scorching, but not ship
destroying concussion.

Alternative 2.5: the armor is mostly inside the fuel tank to prevent this,
so everyone inside gets pummelled severely, but the ship will survive.

Why would the presence of a large flame make the ship explode? Are ships
that delicate? Remember that the ship will be in the flame for a second
or two at most, since it\'s flying forward, so I expect there to be
some charring and that\'s about it.

If the section of the fuel tank that was hit explosively decompresses,
the ship will jerk (Newton\'s Third Law) as the hydrogen vents.
I doubt that would cause structural damage.

Of course everything depends on how you define "widespread opposition."
To be polite about it, and its difficult, I think that the above view is
overly-narrow and superficial.  There have been abolitionists in North
America since the 1600s.  How "widespread" their "opposition" was is
subject to wide lattitudes of interpretation.

7 people voted: Idiot/Savant, Jon Goff, John Macphearson, Chirs Lloyd,
Jyrki Paajanen, Eamon Watters and myself.

I totaled up the votes for each ship and divided by the number of
voters, to account for the fact that the designers didn\'t vote for
their own ships. First place got one point, and 6th place got 6 points,
and who ever got the lowest score won.

The totals are:

Athenian Class Trader                      2.17
Iguana class Far Trader                    3.0

So the winnner is the Sojourner by Me.  Hmmm that looks funny,  with me
being the vote counter and all. I didn\'t cheat, but it might look funny
to someone else.  I have all the votes if anyone wants to look at them.
 In the next contest, I could take my ship out of voting contention if
anyone wants.  

All in all, I think the contest went pretty well, we got some pretty
neat ships out of it.  It wasn\'t alot of work, so I am willing to keep
on doing it until people get sick of it.  I don\'t think we will start
the next one for a few weeks to give people a break. 

I think the rules did pretty well, the only rule I\'d like to add is
that designer\'s should send me the ship in pure ASCII, I can read MIME
encrypted Word files, but it is a pain in the neck. Also Franklin Cain
sent in two designs, and I figured since we had so few designs, it
wouldn\'t matter, but does anyone have a problem with that.  

Well  I\'ll get the designs up on the BARD pages soon, I have just the
Virtue and the Tycoon to turn into HTML.  If anyone has any comments
about the voting feel free to send them to me.

If you use the fact that hydrogen will diffuse thru *solid* materials

You\'ll have a constant flow of hydrogen and *no* buildup of other

The flow rate of hydrogen will depend on the pressure, and the
diffusion rate (which can be pretty high for some materials. The fact
that the gasses in the channel get heated by the compression (and thus
heat the walls of the channel) will *help* the diffusion!

Scott, that\'s pretty much the way I play it.  Some people hold out for the
"jump fuel" being used in a fusion reaction, but others of us see it as
injection material.

Over the course of approximately a week the injection material dissipates,
and the cohesion of the bubble collapses popping the ship back into normal
space.  I have the ship actually change position instantaneously, but it\'s
trapped in "j-space" until the bubble collapses.

>You would have to have more material to go farther in J-Space. 

Well, my take on how this all works goes like this.  

First, what is refined "jump fuel," and why should you use it?

Refined jump fuel is *pure* hydrogen with all impurities filtered out.
Unrefined jump fuel is hydrogen that hasn\'t been completely filtered.
Actually, ANY material will work as jump fuel, but because of the way it is
going to be used you want a very uniform homogeneous gas, and hydrogen is
what jump drives are tuned to use.  If you don\'t have a completely
homogeneous injection fluid, ie impurities, you will have problems with
random "clumping", "hot spots", and alignment problems with the ship\'s
controls, and will risk various kinds of misjumps.

What is the "jump process?"

The ship injects the "jump fuel" through a jump coil located at the nose of
the ship.  This injection medium forms an American/Canadian/Rugby football
shaped jump bubble around the ship closed by the "jump ring" located at the
ship\'s stern.  This isn\'t a bubble of N-space, it\'s a bubble of J-space. 
The ship, itself, is protected within it\'s jump grid, described below.

As the ship continues to pump "jump fuel" through the coil a gravity lens
is formed in front of the ship within the bubble.  The Astrogator uses
special sensors to look through the lens and locate the jump coordinates of
the ship\'s destination, locks a gravity pulse generator on those
coordinates and emits a strong pulse at the target destination. This forms
a small temporary wormhole just large enough for the ship and it\'s
surrounding bubble to fit through.  The injection material of the lens
deforms into an elongated tube (or fold if you think about it a different
way) extending from the present location to the destination. The ship\'s
jump bubble inverts through the wormhole translating the ship
instantaneously from here to there.  When the inversion occurs the bubble
exists totally outside of N-space, and is invisible to all N-space sensors. 
The amount of "jump fuel" needed depends on the volume of the bubble needed
to enclose the ship\'s volume and the distance of the tube through the
wormhole.  Conveniently this works out to whatever version of the rules you
happen to be using.  ;-> The injection material dissipates at random along
the path such that after approximately a week there is too little of it to
maintain the bubble and the the ship pops back into N-space, along with the
rest of the jump fuel, in a blinding flash and a big jog on any nearby
gravity sensor or densometor.

While the ship is in J-space it must maintain power to the "jump grid"
located in the hull of the ship.  The jump grid creates a bubble of N-space
within the bubble of J-space.  Loss of this jump grid means that J-space
intrudes into the ship proper with deadly effects.

Powering the jump grid, the jump coil and ring and the gravity pulse all
takes electrical energy drawn from the ship\'s powerplant.  In my version,
none of the jump fuel supplies power and there is no separate "jump drive
power plant."  

Where can you jump from and to, and how do you figure it out?

To jump out, your ship has to be in a very low gravity environment, or
beyond what I call the "hyperlimit" (minimum 100 diameters from any massive
object), in order for the jump bubble, gravity lens and wormhole to form. 
Trying to jump inside the hyperlimit results in unpredictable results
ranging from wasted fuel and energy, to misjumps, to various levels of
destruction of equipment.

When you jump in, your ship will appear at the destination\'s
"hyperlimit."  Minor misjumps could put you closer or farther away.
Extremely good jumpmaps, high astrogation skill, and good rolls could allow
you to position your exit closer to your destination, and of course, the
opposite is also true.  

Because of the restrictions on where you can jump from, microjumps within a
system range from hopeless to impossible to perform, and jumps to truly
empty locations are not possible.  Jumps to "empty hexes" are actually to
dark bodies located in those hexes.  These dark bodies are *extremely* hard
to sense, develop coordinates for, or even lock onto if you already have
their coordinates, so jumping to "empty hexes" isn\'t a common occurrence.
Under special circumstances can be done.

Jump coordinates are determined from "The Book" of jump maps, and/or from
analysis of sensor readings by the Astrogator.  The jump coordinates of
bodies in "charted space" change fairly quickly, so "The Book" has to be
updated every year or so to avoid misjumps.  A book that is several years
out of date is next to useless.

Uncharted systems require time and Astrogation skill to determine jump
coordinates, and can only be done while the ship is in a jump bubble. This
means that explorers will go through the jump process up to, but not
including emitting the gravity pulse, and use the Astrogational sensors to
read the coordinates of various gravity sources.  Greater distances take
longer to accurately read and require better sensors to make the readings.

Obviously, better jump sensors also allow locking onto sources at greater
distances. Therefore it is the quality of these sensors that really
determine jump-ratings, ie jump 1, 2, 3, etc.  

Doing this sort of charting means that a ship will be stuck in j-space for
a week after making these readings.  The ship will have to expend another
dose of injection material next week to actually make the jump, and see if
their readings were correct.  This makes survey work slow and somewhat
dangerous.  And it has to be done continually, even within charted space to
keep The Book up-to-date.

This is how *I* do things, anyway. Questions or comments?

   before anyone even thinks of trying this out.

It seems that there was an experiment in Switzerland dealing with
"twinned" photons, separated by several miles (yes, folks, you
read that correctly - miles).  These "twinned" photons maintained
a "connection" of some sort; they did a "T"-maze kind of
experiment, where the direction that a photon would appear to

determined.  In every case, both "twins" chose the same direction

happened simultaneously, to within time limits that could not

   ISBA REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS
   New THUDDD Competition Announced
   
   A syndicate of leading corporations offering goods and services to the
   exceedingly wealthy, in conjunction with the Imperial Ship Builders
   Association (ISBA), announces a new THUDDD ship-design competition.
   The winning entrant in this competition, and perhaps other entrants as
   well, will receive lucrative contracts to produce limited runs of
   their vessels over the coming decade; these vessels will serve in
   *highly* visible roles, and could potentially provide a good deal of
   free publicity for the firms involved.
   
   The vessel to be produced is a yacht, 300-500 dt, atmosphere-capable,
   minimum performance J2/M1, only minimal weaponry (or none at all).
   This is intended as a toy for the wealthy, or as a vessel of state for
   political or corporate leaders.
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
  Notes and commentary
  
   The distinguishing feature of this THUDDD competition is that rather
   than the numeric design side, the emphasis will be on the textual
   description of the craft, exterior and interior. Create a vivid
   picture in the reader\'s mind of opulence and luxury; describe the
   spaces and how they connect to one another such that role players will
   feel that they have really been on board.
   
   The limit for this descriptive section is 2000 words. I had considered
   accepting graphical deckplans and other images, but in the end decided
   this would leave out those without the tools or skill to create them.
   However, you may embed links to such in the text of your entry, and I
   will make the links into operational HTML hyperlinks.
   
   Also, in the interests of fostering right-brain-oriented entries to
   this THUDDD, I have provided a sample 400 dt yacht with no
   description, which others are free to borrow, rename, possibly modify,
   and detail. Note that there is a more-than-ample cargo volume on my
   sample vessel, much of which could easily be reallocated to other uses
   in derived designs.

   New to the industry, Kosher Shipyards hopes to build a long line of
   followers by offering products geared toward the more demanding
   consumer. In our first model, the Sluce yacht, we offer a solidly
   constructed craft, built on solid engineering. It hosts a certain
   amount of versatility in respect to travel, while still being properly
   refined. Join us, will you, on a tour of the Sluce, a proper
   gentelman\'s transport.
   
   As you first spot the Sluce winging its way in for the spaceport\'s
   runway, you are struck by the sleek appearance of its flowing swept
   wing design. As they taper out from the sleek stretched disk hull, the
   trailing edges of the wingtips extend well beyond the rear of the
   body. While it rolls to a stop on the tie down ramp It\'s flowingly
   grained metallic body seems to float effortlessly along the ground.
   
   As you enter the Sluce you are taken aback to find yourself on a glass
   encased fly bridge in the very belly of the craft. The entire interior
   of the bridge is worked in obsidian panels and teak trim with the
   seating encased in supple butter soft tan leather. The crew stand
   there, alert in all black uniforms with silver pinstriping, ready to
   meet you as you enter. It is here also, that you realize the windows
   of the craft are photo reactive. You next work your way up the
   stainless steel circular staircase to the passenger quarters. As you
   look down the long stained Hardwood floor of the corridor you notice
   five dark mahogany doors on each side and a stairway leading down at
   the rear. In the other direction is a stairwell leading up, widening
   as it goes.
   
   Your guide beckons you to enter one of the staterooms and you follow
   his suggestion. Inside the entire room is covered in solid tiger
   stripe maple panels over an inch thick each. The floor is covered in a
   single custom hand woven persian rug imported directly from the
   Solemani. As you peer into the private bath you discover the entire
   room to be carved from a single block of green marble with the
   fixtures of solid titanium almost seamlessly threaded into place.
   
   Your guide next beckons you up onto the promenade. You ask him what
   the doors to the rear are for and he waves it off saying, "Crew
   quarters, no more." As you proceed up the sprawling stair case and
   onto the promenade you realize that you stand atop a giant fish tank
   spanning the entire floor. As you look in you see an amazing
   assortment of exotic fish swimming along. You next notice the bar off
   to your right, formed in blued steel and black leather to match the
   rest of the furniture that surrounds you. Above lies the roof of the
   ship, all glass and now tuned black as welder\'s visor.
   
   Your guide leads you next through a steel door next to the bar and
   down a short hardwood stair case to the dining chamber. The oak
   hardwood that made up the stairs now lies out before you to form an
   oval room. The walls, upholstered in dark maroon leather, stretch half
   way up to meet the domed ceiling. It hovers majestically above you,
   layered with ceder slates and crossed with polished brass beams coming
   into a single point from which an ornate brass chandelier hangs. Below
   the chandelier is an extraordinary maple table with seating for
   twenty. Next to the table stands Peire, your chef in his spotless
   white suite.
   
   As you make your way to the sales office with the guide he mentions
   some of the nicer amenities of the ship in case they hadn\'t caught
   your eye. He talks about the stainless steel lined cargo bay for easy
   cleaning and how the state room\'s entertainment facilities are fitted
   directly into the ship\'s internal structure to maximize free space. He
   also mentions the cigar humidor\'s included in each stateroom and the
   built in galley wine rack, as well as the ceder lined closets.
   
    Designers comments:
    
     * I realize that FF&S is not intended to be the primary system here,
       however it\'s the only one that I\'m familiar enough with to produce
       a craft (It\'s also the only I have at current) and I hope this
       design is satisfactorily wrought.
     * Why no weapons? Simple, this is a toy, not a raiding, trading or
       privateering vessel. That is why the only defensive system
       included is a nuclear damper screen. It was the only thing short
       of a sand caster that would be effective at this small of a size
       and still leave room for the needed luxuries. I opted against the
       sand caster for volume and ascetic purposes. I should note that I
       felt the biggest problem that a ship of this nature faces in
       defense is pirates, which is why the model comes with a defense
       locker carrying sixteen 10 gauge ETC semiautomatic shotguns as a
       mater of courtesy.
     * A maximum speed of 3 Gs was chosen because this is a luxury vessel
       and should not be able to exceed its G compensation rating.
     * The collapsible fuel tanks were included in the event that the
       owner would like to press out for a jump longer than 3 parsecs if
       they were not carrying to much cargo. In fact, if fuel is also
       pumped away from the HEPlaR supply and Fusion plant, up to three
       consecutive jumps up to 9 parsecs can be achieved (admittedly with
       highly exhausted reserves).
     * The reason for the excessive number of computers was to cut crew
       and reduce the number of maintenance points. The less crew and
       maintenance points the better. No rich man or woman want\'s to pay
       or house excess crew on his yacht. Also, when a person that
       wealthy want\'s to use their toy they certainly don\'t want to hear
       that it\'s undergoing it\'s annual inspection.
     * Why the sensors and communication suite I chose? The
       Communications suite has a AU1000 range because if these guys get
       in trouble they want to reach out and talk to some one. The laser
       com was just intended as a back up. The nav aids I simply figured
       would be useful in landing and the same goes for the TFA avionics.
       The passive EMS range of only KM120,000 was chosen because I felt
       that a yacht, a ship that should have proper aesthetic appearance,
       wouldn\'t look right with a folding array and I couldn\'t fit a
       larger system on without using one.
     * I opted against smaller craft on board because this one is capable
       of landing as it is. Any smaller craft the owner would likely want
       to use to move around the planet could probably fit and drive(or
       fly) nicely out of the cargo hold once the ship had landed.
     * I included the low births because accidents, misjumps and the
       such, happen and a properly equipped luxury vehicle should be
       equipped to deal with them.
     * I chose such a large cargo store for two reasons. In the first
       place, anyone who has driven around the country on long multi day
       trips knows that there is absolutely never enough space in the
       trunk/hatch/storage compartment. Fiends of mine have small cabin
       cruiser boats and they say the same thing. I figure the wealthy
       have this problem more than anyone because they have a heck of a
       lot more, and bigger in the case of vehicles, stuff to bring with
       them. Secondly, it allows for good versatility of trip duration
       when combined with the collapsible fuel bladders.

   Assembled by the small Martian ship construction cooperative known as
   Phobos Yards, this custom designed pleasure yacht is a one of a kind
   original initially designed as a mobile home and office for the
   Marquis of Melanor. The hull of the ship is a small iron-based
   asteroid recovered from the nearby main belt in the Terran system.
   Perhaps the most interesting feature of the ship are the rooms and
   corridors where the original rough, irregular surfaces of the asteroid
   have been preserved. This was intentional and designed to evoke the
   dungeon-like feel of the strange and mysterious underground passages
   beneath the Terran Mad Ludwig\'s famous castle, which captured the
   Marquis\' imagination when he first saw them. Hence the name of the
   ship class. The following areas have not been left "natural," for
   obvious reasons: Bridge, Engineering Deck, Cargo Hold, Sick Bay,
   Hangar, Crew Staterooms, and most access areas. The remainder of the
   ship, which includes most passageways, all the Staterooms, and the
   special custom rooms detailed below, are of tunneled out iron rock.
   Control panels, lights, fixtures, and other interfaces are tastefully
   set into the rock walls, and blend into the surroundings to heighten
   the effect.
   
   The Ludwig is a pleasure craft, wholly unsuited for travel in frontier
   environments. To begin with it is unstreamlined, and has no facilities
   for fuel scooping or purification. Access to a type A or B starport
   with refined fuel is almost a necessity. This serves the purposes of
   the ship\'s owner ideally, since he has no intention of using the
   vessel as anything other than a mobile base from which to entertain
   and conduct his business. Being a noble, his business rarely takes him
   out of the established spacelanes. For planetside landings, the Yacht
   carries in its spacious hangar a well appointed 30-ton Ship\'s Boat
   that sees to the Marquis\' needs quite well. The ship is unarmored, and
   only very lightly armed with a light laser (fore) and sandcaster
   (aft). It has been designed using TL-11 technology, so that it can be
   repaired and maintained on the Marquis\' home planet.
   
   There are two main features of the ship which stand out from regular
   vessels, and they are described below:
   
    Conference Room/Dining Hall/Ballroom
    
   Taking up the entire top deck of the ship (w/ the exception of the
   elevator which provides access) is a large room (30m x 20m). The walls
   (up to about 8\') have been carved out of the rough iron of the
   asteroid, and the top of the room is a large, sealed dome, attached
   onto the "top" of the asteroid, which provides spectacular space
   vistas in all directions. The dome can be darkened when in Jumpspace.
   The room is used both as a Dining Hall and Ballroom (the solid wood
   floor is perfect for this purpose). (Ref\'s Note: The combination of
   spectacular vistas and the beautifully appointed antique surroundings
   provides a juxtaposition which should get just about any ref\'s
   descriptive juices flowing).
   
    Grotto
    
   One of the large staterooms has been converted into a beautiful
   secluded grotto, complete w/ small waterfall and pool (all connected
   to the ship\'s life support system). This area also has a large
   collection of tropical plants, and appropriate wildlife noises can be
   pumped through the intercom.
   
   The entire ship is decorated with splendid reproductions of Terran
   Baroque and Rococo furniture and art. The Dining Hall features an
   ornate dining table w/high backed chairs which seats up to 15 people
   comfortably. The Louis XIV style is dominant, but other items are also
   present. Mirrors and artwork decorate many of the rough-hewn walls,
   making the effect a most astonishing one. Sconces w/ flickering
   florescent flames adorn the walls of many passageways. The main
   stateroom features an ornate four poster bed and matching dresser made
   of cherry.
   
   There is a well appointed kitchen for serving special meals. (Design
   note: This is in lieu of the Sick Bay, which is little more than a
   workstation, automated medical assistant and medicine cabinet.)
   Needless to say, the crew are well taken care of and serve the Marquis
   with unquestioned loyalty.
   
   Finally, when not in use, the cargo bay can be converted into a small
   fencing venue, complete w/ spectator\'s seats and automated
   judging/scoring system.

depending on the buyer\'s desires and budget)

    Notes:
    
     Space is full of utterly beautiful sights...
     and now, you can own one of them.
     
   Xanadu... a star yacht like no other, blending graceful, sweeping
   lines, the newest jumpdrive technology, and unparalleled elegance in
   interior design.
   
   Xanadu... a ship that catches the eye as you first board her, and your
   heart after you\'ve sailed aboard her.
   
   You enter her through huge, spacious locks port and starboard for\'ard,
   specially designed for this class, which allow you to enter in comfort
   and grace, unlike the conventional cramped passenger locks of most
   run-of-the-mill vessels. Before you is the foyer, leading into the
   heart of luxury. Each Xanadu\'s internal appointments and decor are
   custom tailored to your esthetic; whether you love Erte or
   Yishmanaggu, Yoshinagu or Kinsolving, Wright or Hepplewight, the
   furnishings and fittings will be carefully crafted by artisans who
   will meet your every desire in the finest materials.
   
   From the foyer, your guests can go fore or aft, port or starboard.
   Whichever stateroom they choose, they will have luxurious furnishings,
   an outer stateroom with gorgeous views of space, and nearness to all
   the necessities of luxury travel. Stewards\' spaces, stowage, wine
   racks, humidors, all these amenities have been placed in the
   centerline of the ship, to ensure that none of your friends need
   endure the indignity of an inner cabin.
   
   Your party will dine, socialize, and marvel forward... at the Grand
   Lounge, a gracious space 3 times the size of the grandest stateroom,
   whose forward face is a sweeping expanse of specially reinforced,
   transparent superdense hullplate. Your in-system parties can truly be
   held among the stars aboard Xanadu. (Jumpspace need hold no terrors;
   all ports aboard a Xanadu have an inner liquid-crystal sandwich layer,
   which can opaque the ports and provide any number of "views" when the
   outside is aesthetically unpleasant.)
   
   Your short-range travel needs await you amidships. Gleaming, spotless
   hangar bays can be found past guests\' spaces, holding a specially
   designed ship\'s boat and air raft/skimmer, both of which have
   hulllines which evoke and echo those of the Xanadu. (Their basic cost
   is included in the purchase price.) The interior fittings are, like
   all the accomodations for your friends, custom designed to be
   reflections of your taste. Your souvenirs and sporting needs can be
   offloaded diectly into the cargo bay, aft of the hangar spaces. Your
   ship\'s crew spaces are conveniently located just sternwards of the
   cargo bay, so you can be sure that help with those bulky items is but
   a comm call away. (High-order automation interlinkages keep crewing at
   a minimum, so you and your guests can travel in greater comfort, room,
   and luxury.)
   
   If desired, our architects at E and HT will be pleased to discuss your
   personal needs for further customization of the Xanadu. More guests,
   at a lower jumpdrive rating? Perhaps some defensive capacity, in case
   you have...special security needs? Our staff loves a challenge... the
   challenge of meeting your needs, then exceeding your dreams.
   
   Xanadu... the Fast Yacht from Earneau and Hao Tse.
   
   You deserve yours.

    Notes:
    
   The Phoenix P-300YL is designed as a casual runabout for the descreet
   and discerning client. As with all Phoenix designs, the P-300YL is
   constructed using only tried and tested componentary using well
   established modular construction methods, married with individualised
   artistic flare; allowing the client to customise his or her vessel to
   their individual tastes. The P-300YL is specifically tailored to meets
   the needs of the up and coming young noble family who are unwilling to
   spend the extravegant sums required for other more traditional yachts.
   
   The P-300YL is fitted with a standard MCI 9000b/12 jump drive giving
   it a range of 2 parsecs and carries 60 tons of jump fuel internally.
   The P-300YL is fully streamlined permitting atmospheric operations and
   is capable of wilderness refueling from gas giants or local oceans;
   and it\'s onboard Mitre VML(ter) fuel purification plant permits a full
   load fuel to be processed in 20 hours 50 minutes (at a throughput rate
   of 3 tons per hour). In system maneuver is provided by six MCI TG62-a
   gravitic thruster units. Each unit provides up to 700 tons thrust
   giving a sustained acceleration of 1G. Power for these and other
   onboard systems is provided by a set of five coupled Simmens EG-Q27/i
   50Mw fusion reactors. The 2500 Kg of L-Hyd fuel dedicated to the
   reactors provides for up to one year\'s continuous operation.
   
   The P-300YL is fitted with a Matsui ASC-12bis integrated avionics,
   sensor and communication package. This provides civilian standard
   avionics, along with improved civilian standard sensors and
   communications. The ASC-12bis allows for any individual component to
   be removed and replaced should the need arise. The ASC-12bis features
   advanced avionics exceeding all civil aerospace regulations; AEMS and
   PEMS sensors; 30,000 km range radio; and a 1000AU range tight beam
   maser communicator. The advanced electronics of the P-300YL removes
   the need for a dedicated bridge.
   
   Given the nature of the likely persons to be carried, the P-300YL
   comes with a standard Phoenix PL(C)-2 laser turret and a Phoenix
   PS(C)-7 sandcaster turret; allowing for adequate self defence in the
   case of hostile encounters.
   
   The P-300YL is fitted with a hanger for the transport and launching of
   auxilary craft. However no craft are included with the design,
   allowing for the client to choose craft to meet their individual
   requirements. The hanger itself can carry any standard spacecraft or
   vehicle up to 20dT. Routine maintaince and repairs can be conducted so
   long as the total displacement of carried craft does not exceed 10
   tons. It is envisaged this this hanger will primarily be used for the
   transport of vehicles for the use on the worlds visited.
   
   The standard crew list for the P-300YL is as follows:
       Captain
       Purser
       Pilot
       Astrogator
       Engineer
       Electronics operator
       Chef
       Laser gunner
       Sandcaster gunner
       3 stewards

   The Captain and Purser are provided with large staterooms as befitting
   their status, whilst the remaining crew members are provided with
   comfortable small staterooms for the individual use. A 10 ton
   dedicated cargo area is also provided and if neccessary this can be
   augmented from the space allocated for customisation (up to a total of
   25.4 tons). The remainder of the ship is given over to the needs and
   comfort of it\'s passengers.
   
   Particular attention has been paid to asthesetic considerations
   throughout the P-300YL. The P-300YL\'s interior may be customised to
   the clients individual tastes. Several standard options are available
   (Pre-industrial Terran sailing ship, mid-Vilani classical, Sylean
   minimalist, Kuriish Modern etc.) and Phoenix has entered into a
   contract with Vierani of Ginna for the commission of individual
   designs to suit the needs of any client. Exotic natural fittings are
   used throughout the P-300YL such as panelling from the Taragi Tree of
   Daer Map, Crympolin leather upholstery, Bakerlight Turtle door
   fittings, Limbern Crystal chandoliers, Xustonwood flooring etc.
   
   The main personnel entry point to the P-300YL has been deliberately
   designed to be restrictive and cramped, opening on to a wide spacious
   corridor lined with artworks specially commissioned from leading
   artists such as Dev Anraki, Zonto u\'Quer and Shariik Shankirlii (to
   name but a few), so as to create a dramatic contrast upon boarding.
   This corridor leads on to the formal reception area. This is designed
   as a classical library/study, with a small bar for the preperation of
   light refreshments for guests.
   
   Running off the reception area is a promanade. One side of this is
   fitted with broad windows allowing dramatic vistas of the vastness of
   space or local scenary (if the P-300YL is grounded). During jump these
   windows are shuttered by holographic screens, shielding occupants from
   exposure to jump space. A prominant feature of the promanade is a
   diverse collection of flora from the far corners of the Imperium.
   
   Both the promanade connects to the main recreation area of the
   P-300YL. This is tasteful designed and decorated (to the clients
   specifications) to allow for a wide variety of recreational pursuits.
   This area is ideal for entertaining guests in a formal or informal
   setting. It connects to both the formal dinning room and the fully
   equiped modern kitchen, allowing the host to hand over the running of
   social functions to the Purser and therefore freeing his or her mind
   from such distracting and tedious details. If it is required the
   partition between the recreation area and dinning room can be removed
   to allow for major functions.
   
   For their comfort passengers and guests are provided with individual
   accommodations. The P-300YL is fitted with six standard large
   staterooms and two larger double sized staterooms for the use of the
   owner and prominent guests. These staterooms are all individually
   designed and decorated by Vierani of Ginna and no two staterooms on
   any P-300YL will be alike. Again clients may select from a wide range
   of standard themes or specify a custom theme to suit their individual
   tastes. All staterooms (as well as the kitchen and Captain and
   Purser\'s staterooms) are connected by a pnuematic tube message system
   in addition to a descreet emergency intercom.
   
   In addition to these accommodations, no less than fourteen small
   staterooms are provided adjacent to the crew quarters for the
   accomodation of the valets maids, chauffers etc. of the passengers and
   guests. Further to this the P-300YL has ten low berths to allow for
   the transport of equestrian and sporting animals.
   
   To allow for individual clients requirements, 15.5 tons of space has
   been set aside for customisation. This space can be utilised to
   provide anything from additional accommodations, a formal ballroom,
   laboratories for clients to pursue academic interests, trophy rooms
   for safari\'s, or anything else the client might desire. (Please
   discuss your individual requirements with your local Phoenix
   represenative).
   
   The P-300YL comes with the modest price tag of Mcr 93.3 (including MCr
   3.75 for fittings and the suchlike), and requires 42 weeks to build.

    Wandering Star Charters
    
   Mail Code Sylea-Botania 38312
   
   Gentleperson,
   
   Thank you for your inquiry regarding our luxury charter craft.
   Currently we have available several vessels of the _Eastern Star_
   Class luxury Yacht built by the Goodenuf Construction Company of
   Sylea. The vessel which seems to fit your schedule is the _Rising
   Star_, a 500 ton luxury liner. I have appended a description below.
   Please contact me soon with your intentions since the liner\'s schedule
   must be set well in advance to assure our low prices.
   
   Speaking of prices, the _Rising Star_ is available, fully crewed, for
   a cost of Mcr 1 for each two weeks (Four week minimum, round trip
   required). There is a strict list of available destinations due to
   potential problems outside Cleon\'s Imperium, but any destination
   within the Imperium which has no travel restriction is quite
   acceptable.
   
      The Rising Star
      
   Built in the Year 26 by the Goodenuf Construction Company, the _Rising
   Star_ is truly a Jewel in the Wandering Star line of vessels. The
   custom package fitted in this vessel includes a multi-purpose
   recreation room, a specialized swimming pool which can be configured
   for constant flow lap swimming, a steamy hot tub, and a celestial main
   dining salon, with incredible views of the stars (while in normal
   space, of course). All staterooms are two rooms; a bedchamber and a
   parlor, and are luxuriously appointed.
   
      Layout and Configuration
      
   The ship\'s sleek lines have been commented on since the first of the
   class was built. The smooth manta-shaped body is equipped with a
   Starcaster(TM) maneuver drive capable of 3 standard gravities of
   acceleration, and the Mark II Quick-hop Hyperdrive carries the vessel
   2 parsecs per jump, and double redundant Zhunastu Fusion+(TM) power
   plants provide.
   
   The forward section of the vessel\'s hull reveals the now-famous Dining
   Salon observation windows on the lower half of the hull, with the
   Ship\'s bridge occupying a small bulge on the upper half. Two light
   laser turrets are mounted port and starboard of the center section on
   the upper hull towards the aft of the vessel, while the main armament,
   a single heavy laser emitter, is mounted flush with the dorsal hull in
   the center so as not to interfere with the ship\'s landing operations.
   
   Hull sections taper to either side of the main portion of the hull,
   acting as atmospheric control surfaces and giving the ship a
   streamlined look. A long tapering aft hull section contains drives and
   the 40 ton ship\'s boat hangar. An additional hangar for a vehicle of
   up to 12 tons is available for Guest\'s vehicles and can accommodate
   either ground or grav vehicles (A luxury speeder is also available for
   an additional fee). A 35 ton cargo bay with a ventral loading hatch is
   available for guest use, and can also accommodate vehicles.
   
   Internal accommodations justify the reputation of the vehicle class.
   Each passenger stateroom suite has two rooms, a bedchamber and parlor.
   The bedchambers are draped in rich fabrics from different sections of
   the Imperium, covering the walls and ceiling and giving the illusion
   that guests are in some noble mansion, rather than traveling through
   space. Oversized canopy beds are made up fresh daily (or more often if
   you wish). Deep-stained hardwoods make up the dressers, bedframe, and
   other furniture, while elegant flagstones and beautiful handmade rugs
   cover the floors.
   
   A stone fireplace adorns each parlor, along with large comfortable
   chairs and divans in a styles from Vilani times. The fireplace gives
   off a gentle warmth and flickering light of real flame, but requires
   no manual feeding. A wet bar gives instant access to whatever snack or
   beverage the guest wishes to have on hand, while a fully stocked bar
   and kitchen is available at all times in the main dining salon. Access
   terminals are ingeniously hidden until needed for work. A large oaken
   table is set against one wall which can be employed as work surface or
   dinner table if the guest takes meals in.
   
   We hope, though, that the guests will attend dinner in the main Dining
   Salon each night. Our expert Chef prepares an incredible meal each
   evening in his well appointed kitchen. The room in which this meal is
   served makes all occasions special. Up to 17 ebony high backed chairs
   (one for each passenger assuming double occupancy staterooms plus one
   for the Captain) can be set around the solid Obsidian table, on which
   the gleaming blue stylized tableware positively sparkles, and the
   solid crystalline glasses gleam with an inner light. the room is
   paneled with rare vlandian deep-rose quartz, and a gentle golden light
   is emitted from frosted-glass sconce fixtures around the room, as well
   as the electric blue crystalline chandelier overhead.
   
   Backlit glass cabinets along one wall of the room display the ships
   service; bowls of rare crystal, plates and flatware of different new
   and ancient style in materials that make the most jaded visitors gawk,
   serving dishes of the finest silver, rare liquors and fine vintage
   wines from all over the Imperium and beyond are displayed for your
   appreciation.
   
   What draws the eyes however, especially in orbit, is the wall of glass
   that makes up the front wall of the salon. Polarized crystal viewports
   look out on whatever vista is presently displayed, and can be
   conveniently blacked out in jumpspace or during a burningly bright
   reentry. The windows angle from your feet outward, giving a falling
   sensation any who stand by the glass. The view is broken only by
   narrow structural supports, necessary for safety reasons. Generally
   dinner is served by the light of the stars or the light reflected off
   the orb of whatever planet lies below. When this light enters the
   salon, the chandelier fractures it into a million beams which throw
   ever-changing beautiful patterns on the walls and ceiling of the
   chamber.
   
   When not dining, guests can still be entertained and kept in shape in
   the 12 meter by 6 meter exercise pool. In exercise pool mode a
   constantly adjusting current is maintained to keep the swimmer in
   place as she or he completes their desired distance swim. It can even
   be adjusted so that when the swimmer reaches the end of the 12 meter
   length of the pool they have actually swum a simulated Olympic sized
   pool length. At its deepest end, the pool is 2 meters deep.
   
   Near the pool is a hot tub, the relaxing heated tub provides a gentle
   means of easing muscles overworked in the exercise room just to
   starboard, and has the option of operating in zero gravity with a
   breathing apparatus, an experience that has to be felt to be believed.
   Aquatic scenes decorate the ceramic interior of the tub, hand painted
   and custom made for the ship.
   
   The aforementioned exercise room has many standard high tech
   resistance and weightlifting equipment, and a small games court which
   can be configured for a number of games (Some take the entire exercise
   room, and other equipment is stowed when used for this purpose).
   Gravity is fully adjustable, so those incredible slam dunks are now
   easy, no matter what shape you are in. And if you want a real workout,
   add 30% to the gravity and see how hard roto-ball can really be. This
   double height room is the mirror image of the pool section, and is at
   the same level as the bottom of the pool, but on the opposite side of
   the ship.
   
   A fully stocked sick bay staffed by a full time doctor is on board to
   meet any medical need. In addition we have spared no expense in making
   sure our passengers are delivered safely. Three laser and a defensive
   sandcaster are carried, and at 3G acceleration, there is only a very
   small likelihood that our well trained gunners would have anything to
   shoot at. Sensors, communications and other equipment are all
   state-of-the-art Imperial technology, not backwater imitations. Our
   components are manufactured for us to exacting specifications, not
   "cookie cutter" standard components which have been outsourced to
   who-knows-where. You will meet and get to know your captain during
   your journey, so you can be confident about how the ship is being
   handled. A full staff of 6 stewards and a chef see to your every need.
   
   We hope you will join us as we cruise among the stars of the Imperium!
   
    Design Notes
    
   Designed using SSDS by way of Andrew Akins design template (The
   "Starship Assembly Line").
   
   Obviously this ship is built for ambiance, not to make money (not the
   usual way, anyway).
   
   Glean what you can from the text regarding shape and layout. I
   envision a shape like a flattened horseshoe crab, with drive sections
   to either side of the ship\'s boat hangar, which sort of overhangs the
   stern cargo hatch. The reference to "atmospheric control surfaces" was
   more fanciful than factual since the vessel is streamlined only, not
   an airframe. The shape I envision does, however, somewhat resemble a
   flying wing.
   
   The pool and rec room each occupy 490 m^3 I would be interested to
   hear if anyone thinks this is insufficient. The hot tub is between the
   two and occupies 22m^3. It should also have an airlock, but the design
   does not include one. The dining salon occupies 252m^3 at the bow of
   the vessel. It should be considered a serious vulnerability in battle.
   I added 40m^3 to the Kitchen, theorizing that most shipboard galleys
   are tiny efficient little affairs unworthy of the attention of a chef.
   
   Gunners double as stewards (wouldn\'t the passengers love to hear
   that?) when not gunning. 3 stewards are also on the crew and are full
   time. They will all be able to cook, but one is the master chef (no
   extra salary is figured into the cost though). The doctor is also
   employed as a passenger liaison, and the Captain is expected to dine
   with the passengers.
   
   A standard (but well furnished) 40 ton pinnace is docked in a hangar
   on the aft dorsal portion of the craft. Forward of and beside this are
   crew quarters, with the bridge at the bow of the upper deck. To the
   right and left of this central "spine" are the oversized rec room and
   pool, with the hot tub room beneath the spine. Beneath the Bridge
   itself is the dining salon. Outboard, in front of, and behind the
   \'big\' rooms are the passenger staterooms which often have one square
   meter observation ports when possible.
   
   Each passenger stateroom is actually one large stateroom and one small
   stateroom. They are either single or double occupancy, as desired by
   passenger.
   
   This vessel costs almost 400,000 credits per week to operate
   (including mortgage)! Obviously this expense is either going to be
   paid by a very rich owner, or some profitable run must be found where
   the passengers pay 50,000 per week (single occupancy) for
   transportation, and the ship runs full all the time. I had the idea of
   a luxury charter service. This allows rich nobles to travel in style
   without actually buying a vessel. Rather than paying passage (and
   being unable to control what riffraff occupies the other staterooms),
   they rent the whole vessel by the month. In any case, low operating
   cost is obviously not a priority.

   News Item, Imperial Yacht Club Newsletter, IY 16-322:
   
    Famille Spofulam Yards Launches New Yacht
    
   Recently, I was given the opportunity of touring the first production
   model of Famille Spofulam\'s latest yacht offering. Greeted by Hengabar
   Spofulam at Famille Spofulam\'s orbital HQ, I was treated to the usual
   Spofulam wet bar and buffet before being ushered onto the antiseptic
   floor of Production Line #3 to tour the prototype, which is to be used
   as a corporate yacht by FSY.
   
   This reporter\'s first reaction upon viewing FSY\'s latest, sitting
   incongrously next to the hulking black form of a Bludgeon-class patrol
   cruiser, was: "It\'s a baby Caligula!". Indeed, the Imelda-class yacht
   (named after an ancient Terran queen renowned for her love of luxury
   and lavish tastes) is outwardly very similar to FSY\'s well-known
   1000-ton megayacht; it has an airframe saucer hull with prominent
   vertical stabilizers evoking early space-age Terran ground craft
   styling, in default hull colour settings of hot pink and chrome.
   Although the Imelda is somewhat sleeker than the Caligula, the family
   resemblance is pronounced.
   
   The Imelda\'s performance and specifications are pure Spofulam; 4G
   T-plate maneuver drives, a 3-parsec jump drive, a hull stressed to
   10G\'s for atmospheric operations and heavy armour are what we\'ve come
   to expect from Hengabar\'s boys and girls. The only exception is the
   rather prosaic 95 Mj laser/sandcaster armament suite. Scoops, a
   purification plant and a hangar for a 20-ton launch reflect the
   Spofulam concern for spaceworthiness and functionality; the Imelda is
   capable of more than just the Highport to Highport run. In general,
   this is a fast, long-ranged and capable craft.
   
   While the exterior and performance specs are fairly standard for a
   Spofulam vessel. the interior decor reflects a new departure from
   FSY\'s trademark blond wood and indirect lighting motif. Rather than
   striving for simplicity, maximum ergonomic efficiency, and richness of
   material, FSY\'s interior designers have gone for all-out opulence in
   the newly popular Restoration style; an ornate fusion of First and
   Second Imperium motifs expressed in Sylean materials. The result, the
   product of months of work by noted designer Chonpohl Ghohltyeh, is
   stunning: the panelling is of burled green Lartsa-wood, with obsidian
   tile floors inlaid with green and white nephrite. Fixtures are crafted
   of Iridium-plated gold engraved with both Imperial Sunbursts and Ziru
   Sirkaa and Rule of Man heraldry, and the furnishings are upholstered
   in the finest butter-soft Noggah skin, dyed to match the panelling.
   Ghohltyeh\'s services are available for those wishing to create their
   own decors, albeit for an additional fee.
   
   Mr. Spofulam led me in through the hangar, as the passenger airlocks
   were not yet fully completed. The hangar is situated right aft,
   between the two vertical stabilizers. At the moment empty, the hangar
   is designed to accomodate an Imperial-standard 20td launch, with space
   enough to permit maximum ease of on-board service. After a perfunctory
   explanation of the hangar facilities, I was led forward, detouring
   through the somewhat smaller (20td) cargo hold, into the working areas
   of the ship, on the lower deck.
   
   The lower deck is laid out in a rather simple manner; right aft is the
   hangar, which connects to the cargo hold as well as to the central
   engineering area. A rather nice touch in the hangar area is the large
   and luxuriously appointed passenger grav shaft leading directly up to
   the main corridor on the passenger deck; this permits passengers to
   disembark in style and proceed to the passenger areas without having
   to tour through the working areas of the ship.
   
   Forward of the cargo bay lies the engineering spaces; the J-3 Famille
   Spofulams Subsystems Jump Drive hulks immaculately in the center in a
   large compartment, where the two engineering workstations are
   situated. Access hatches to the spaces containing the twin 10,000
   ton-rated Spofulam Gravitics maneuver drives (mounted aft, outboard of
   the vertical stabilizers) are situated at the rear of the jump drive
   compartment. Likewise, access hatches for the 600Mw Zhunastu Fusion
   Systems power plant (to portside of the jump drive compartment), and
   purification plant (to starboard of the jump drive compartment)
   radiate from the jump drive compartment.
   
   Forward of the jump drive compartment is an access hatch leading to a
   compartment holding a grav shaft to the passenger areas, and
   connecting to the sickbay and 5-workstation bridge. From here on,
   Ghohltyeh\'s hand became evident; the decor changed from workmanlike
   Spofulam engineering-area industrial chic to Restoration-style
   splendour; the sickbay is as much of a work of the desinger\'s creative
   mind as it is one of medical engineering. Like the sickbay, the bridge
   has Lartsa-wood panelling on all non-instrument surfaces, and is laid
   out around a massive owner\'s chair, with power swivel, an endless
   range of adjustments, a refreshment center in one arm and a
   comm/computer panel in the other, and upholstered in what must have
   been the hides of the softest baby Noggahs.
   
   Returning to the grav shaft in the hangar, Mr Spofulam led me up to
   the passenger deck. The grav shaft opens up onto a
   luxuriously-appointed corridor leading forwards. Discreet panels at
   the aftermost end of the main corridor lead to the crew quarters and
   galley and stewarding areas. The accomodations are luxurious, even for
   the crew; all crew save gunners and the two junior stewards have large
   staterooms to themselves. While not up to the standard of accomodation
   of the passenger areas, not even the most work-to-rule member of the
   Spacers Guild could find anything to complain of here: the staterooms
   are all done in traditional Spofulam blond wood and indirect lighting.
   After a brief tour of the crew areas, which connect to engineering via
   twin grav shafts to port and starboard, I was led back into the main
   corridor and into the passenger areas.
   
   The double-width doors at the end of the corridor open inwards, to the
   tune of Famille Spofulam\'s corporate anthem, to reveal an immense
   (300M^3) oval lounge divided into dining, recreational, and lounging
   areas by artfully placed and shaped planters filled with a variety of
   Terran, Sylean, and Vilani vegetation. The Imelda\'s passenger areas
   are centered around this space: eight staterooms are provided for the
   comfort of the owner\'s guests, five of which are standard 4td large
   staterooms, and three of which FSY has termed "MegaStaterooms"; vast
   and opulent 150M^3 spaces containing every possible amenity.
   
   Even these are beggared by the master\'s stateroom, which at 216 M^3,
   or 15 displacement tons, is quite simply immense, with huge panoramic
   viewports set in the ceiling. The furnishings are of course quite
   spectacular; a large canopied bed, sunken coversation pit, immense wet
   bar carved from a simple lump of black jade, and amazingly, a
   fireplace crowned with an actual working ancient Terran "Lava Lamp",
   one of only four known to be in existence. However, these are all
   minor details compared to the Imelda\'s most noteworthy feature; 66M^3
   of the master\'s stateroom are taken up by what has to be the single
   most gigantic \'fresher ever installed on a private vessel, situated
   dead forwards. Resembling more a tropical greenhouse than it does a
   sanitation facility, it holds a hot tub, a sauna, and several large
   planters filled with a variety of Sylean, Terran, and Vilani tropical
   plants. Terran bats and parrots and other exotic flying life forms fly
   from plant to plant, their cries echoing pleasantly from the walls.
   Most remarkable, however, is the massive alabaster-and-Iridium toilet,
   situated at the very front of the vessel, facing huge panoramic
   windows dead forwards.
   
   FSY expects to begin semi-custom production of the Imelda-class early
   next year, at the rate of "one or two" a year.

No more (or less) so than the stereotypes that men are taller and stronger
than women, or Tahitians more relaxed and less repressed than Swedes. 
Everything is a bell curve; I\'m a tall guy, but there are many thousands
of women in the world taller than I am.  Nonetheless, if I imagine a
"generic" woman, she\'s much shorter than I am.  And 99% of the time, this
stereotype holds in reality. 

Similarly, there are probably Vargr who favor subtle Edwardian decor, wear
beige clothing, and couldn\'t care less about shiny gadgets...but they\'re
in a minority.  If a party knows nothing about an NPC they are to contact
other than that it\'s a Vargr, they will assume that said NPC will be
highly status-conscious, \'badly\' dressed (in human terms!), and prone to
sudden enthusiasms and (perhaps) anger.  And again, a good portion of the
time they\'ll be right. 

That\'s why the human mind is so good at forming and applying stereotypes; 
it allows us to organize our experiences and make predictions quickly and
effortlessly, without a lot of conscious logic.  However, the downside is
that when the stereotypes fail, resulting damage can be great.  If the
party above decides to run a con on the Vargr involving a shiny,
impressive gadget that really does nothing useful, and the particular
Vargr is the sort I describe above...and, say, Electronics-4...the party
is in for a very rude awakening. 

It\'s really quite amazing the way stereotypes shape our society.  I
attended a small engineering college, which shared a large campus with
several specialized liberal-arts colleges.  Needless to say, we engineers
labored under a terrible weight of stereotyping as "the geeks" -- which
was to a large extent perfectly true, of course.  But one small cultural
response was fascinating.  It was taboo at my school to wear a calculator
on your belt.  Doing so would have been incredibly convenient at times --
you ended up needing one throughout the day, and putting it on your belt
would have meant one less thing in your backpack or hands.  However, this
was (by tacit but universal agreement) judged to be playing right into the
geek stereotype, so almost nobody did so...and those who did were
considered ubergeeks by us slightly-less-geeky geeks.

Pondering this makes me wonder whether Vargr (or other nonhumans) doing
business with the predominantly human 3I might not consciously adapt their
behavior toward human norms, just to prove they\'re not "those *crazy*
Vargr" (or whatever), but rather less unusual or threatening "acceptable"
members of an otherwise off-putting race.

	Ship re-enters normal space many parsecs away, several centuries
later, inverted in all three dimensions?

	Got that out of a book I\'m reading right now called _Pheonix in
Flight_ by two people whose names I forget.   Kinda readable...

	Or... the second drive pinches a jump bubble out of the first
bubble... and a week later re-enters jumpspace way hellandgone out
somewhere, where there\'s no jump bubble to protect it.  Boom, and it
re-enters normal space as subatomic particles spread over parsecs...

	Or... it just pops the ship into yet another dimension where the
laws of physics/reality make jumpspace look staider and more normal than
your grandmother\'s wednesday night bridge game; the ship re-enters normal
space warped and totally buggered up on the subatomic scale with the crew
dead and distorted in strange and horrible ways, or just totally insane.

	Or... the ship jumps out of jumpspace; the jump bubble re-enters
our universe on schedule, but empty.  In some other dimension, ship and
crew become a new big bang; a brand new universe is suddenly created.  Over
billenia, galaxies form, life occurs, civilizations arise, the stuff of
infinite epic tales occurs, and entropy eventually rules as heat death
takes place.

PI, IMHO, is one of the best works yet by IG. It\'s given me insight not
only in M0 development of psionics but also helped in the development
of TNE Regency-based adventures _and_ brought home some of the problems
the Zhodani had to deal with. Yep, that\'s right, folks...I said the
Zhos.

There was a time in the ancient past (around -6800 in Zho years) in which
the Zhodani were ruled by _non-psionic_ nobility who had the upper hand
over psionic nobles. Check out GDW\'s Alien Module 4 (hey, Marc! Are
these AMs ever going to be republished?).

And now, a Traveller trivia question:
Which race dabbled with psionics _without_ Zhodani assistance?
A hint - this race has made at least one major contribution to the
background setting of Traveller.

Let\'s see if anyone can ID this race, state the source and proof of
the dabbling, and ID one of the major contributions.
It\'s a toughie, I\'ll admit.

This sounds like the Einstein-Rosen-Poldolsky "paradox" which has
generated a lot of controversy and theoretical research over the 
past 62 years (the original paper was published in 1935).

The controversy surrounds the exact nature of the "meaning" of
the experiment.  It apparently holds clues to the "quantum
interconnectedness" of the universe, whatever that means.  This,
along with multiple parallel universes are both rather hot topics
in theoretical physics today.  There also seems to be an interest in
exotic theory & technologies, like "gravitics," "vacuum energy,"
and FTL comms. (Some of this is new enough that it still is shrouded
in a lot of bad pseudoscience, but the legitimate research is there.
Cosmologists like Kip Thorne are actually designing time machines
using exotic matter and wormholes (both in short supply recently).  
We\'ve had a "practical" design for a time machine since th 1930\'s
(practical as long as you have a handy infinitely long neutronium
cylinder spinning at c/2, that is...)

BTW, the EPR paradox forms the foundation of a quantum teleportation
theory advanced (for real) last year.

As an added note,

Back in 1995, a team of researchers transmitted Mozarts 40th symphony 
at 5.7 times the speed of light through the boundary layer of a
microwave 
waveguide. The effect is due to quantum tunneling.  

Still, nothing to indicate that the Traveller universe is anything less 
than feasible.

There is actually a strong argument as to why there might be no explosion 
at all. A number of decades ago auto manufacturers started experimenting 
with hydrogen gas as an auto fuel. One of the first concerns was exactly the 
issue of the car becoming a huge fireball if it were in an accident. Anyway 
a chemist came up with a fairly lo-tech solution. My chemistry is a bit 
rusty, so bare with me -- if you put powdered metal hydride inside of the 
tank, the compound will inhibit the natural tendency of hydrogen to oxidize. 
I recall reading that the tanks survived being shot with incendiary rounds.
Now a natural question is why wasn\'t this done for the shuttle -- perhaps
weight or cost? I don\'t know the answer. The point is that it is possible to
chemically reduce the chance of a secondary hydrogen explosion provided the 
initial explosion doesn\'t completely tear apart the ship.

Suddenly, it all becomes clear.  The history of known space, past and
future, is encoded in the lyrics of Elvis (abbreviated Hebrew-Latin for
"God Sees") Presley ("Pres," for "prescient," and "ley" for law, as he is
the law-giver).  Thus, he is "The God Who Sees Future Law," that is, whose
view encompasses and defines what Shall Be. 

Consider:

"Hound Dog" - Clear documentation of the creation of the Vargr ("nothin\'
but a hound dog"), whose constant complaining ("cryin\' all the time") and
imperfect loyalty made them "no friend of mine [Yaskodray]." 

"Heartbreak Hotel" - Consider that merely by changing "baby" to "babies"
(and grandbabies), its opening verse

  Now since my baby left me I\'ve found a new place to dwell:
  down at the end of Lonely Street at Heartbreak Hotel.
  I\'m so lonely, I\'m so lonely,
  I\'m so lonely that I could die.

perfectly and evocatively describes the aftermath of the Final War, with
Yaskodray finding "a new place to dwell" (his pocket universe) after his
babies leave him (having been on the receiving end of TL-30 weaponry).
Note the special poignancy in the fact that these "babies" were created by
him to relieve his loneliness, which has now returned.

"Viva Las Vegas" - Yaskodray\'s well-known penchant for planetary
modification -- and his boundless energy -- are well captured in the lines

  How I wish that there were more 
  Than the twenty-four hours in the day 
  \'Cause even if there were forty more 
  I wouldn\'t sleep a minute away 

There is more, much more...just what ancient artifact is "Blue Suede
Shoes" warning us away from, and how significant is the parallel to the
Eden myth?...but I\'d best stop now, as there is a mysterious knocking at
my door...

   It appears that IG needs to hire a consultant to tell them which
conventions are worth attending and which ones aren\'t.  Anyone want to
volunteer?  :-)  Seriously, the overall inexperience of the IG
headquarters staff concerning these matters is showing.  I\'m surprised
that those in a position to know didn\'t pass along the information
already.

   I was under the impression that Marc was handling the T4.1 revision. 
As for the cost, as they say, "you have to spend money to earn money."

   If I were a RPG game manufacturer, attendence both GenCon and Origins
would pretty much be mandatory.  I would also pick several of the
Dragon*Con-sized events to send representatives--you pretty much want to
make sure you hit each region of the country at least once.  As for
international events, that would depend upon my travel budget.  Going to
a convention in Europe can get very expensive.

   Update: I was informed today by my friend John Muncy that he managed
to track down the IG booth on Saturday.  It was not there the two days I
looked through the vendor area (Thursday and Friday).

   He spoke with an individual, Matt Geisler, who tipped him to IG\'s
prescence.  Matt had contacted IG back before the convention and asked
them if they were going to be at Origins and if they would like him to
run a game there.  While they were positive about Matt running a game
(he was the one running the post-Collaspe, T4 mechanics game I told you
about in my last post), they were apparently fuzzy on one detail: they
didn\'t know what Origins was or when it was being held.  IG\'s
participation appears to have been organized at the last minute from
Matt\'s description.

   John spoke with two individuals at the IG booth on Saturday.  From
his description it was small but overall looked pretty good.  All the IG
published materials appeared to be on display.  The two individuals in
the booth answered some of his questions regarding T4, but didn\'t have
any responses to any of his more pointed remarks (John is a dedicated
TNEer who has just plain gotten tired of investing in new game
systems).  I don\'t believe he asked about T4.1, nor did the IG personnel
at the convention say anything about it (can\'t say I blame them there). 
His overall impression is that the IG personnel at Origins were the two
unfortunate individuals who happened to be standing around the water
cooler when Courtney came by looking for somebody to put on a plane to
Columbus.

   I wish I had been able to meet with the IG personnel on Saturday, but
like I said, circumstances did not permit it.  I may have made a special
trip to Columbus on Sunday morning had I known they were going to be
there--they certainly weren\'t listed in the on-site convention
literature, so I hold myself blameless.  Now that IG can find Origins on
a map, perhaps their presentation will be better next time around.

about using non-optimuim fuels in relation to a Traveller vehicle. The
post was sloppy (no excuse, I just winged it without thinking :^(  !) At
any rate I did look at the books after the error of my ways was pointed
out to me and found a little information.

The following is quoted from the API (American Petroleum Institute)
Flyer entitled Facts About Oil
Page 28
"Gasoline

    Motor and aviation gasolines are blends of straight-run gasoline
(obtained by primary distillation), natural gasoline (one of the liquids
processed out of natural gas), cracked gasoline, reformed gasoline,
polymerized gasoline and alkyl ate.
    To these gasoline blends, refiners add a wide variety of chemicals,
called additives, to further improve the quality of the fuel.
    Antiknock compounds are one such gasoline additive. Their purpose is
to reduce or eliminate the "knock" or "ping" that occurs when the fuel
is not being properly burned in the engine. The measure of  gasoline\'s
resistant to engine knock is it\'s octane number. This is determined by
comparing a gasoline with fuels of known composition and knock
characteristics under specified conditions. Two different types of tests
conducted in single cylinder laboratory engine yield antiknock measures
calls Research or Motor Octane Number...
    The octane number found on gas station pumps is, "... derived by
adding the Research and the Motor Octane Numbers and then dividing by
two..." commonly expressed as (R+M)/2
        "...Over the years, the octane numbers of gasoline have
increased as automotive engineers have developed cars with higher
compression ratios. In 1935, regular-grade gasoline had a Research
Octane Number of 72. By 1976, it had risen to 93.3. Premium gasolines
rose during the same period from Research Octane of 78 to almost 100."
    "... And, because smaller cars can operate with lower octane
gasoline, octane numbers have moved downward..." since 1976.

Continuing from the same source...
Aviation Gasoline
    "... In 1918, specifications were set up for a suitable aviation
gasoline that was distinctly different from the fuel consumed in
automobiles..."
    After WW1, "... Researchers realized that the key was a standardized
fuel of high anti-knock characteristics. Refiners... developed an
aviation gasoline with an octane number of about 87. In 1934, an
aviation fuel of 200 octane was developed."

Continuing from the same source...
Jet Fuels
    " When research first began on jet fuels, commercially available
kerosene was used because of it\'s relatively low volatility... Today\'s
commercial jet airliners still depend on highly refined kerosene for
most of their fuel supply."
    " Military jets require a somewhat more complex fuel to withstand
the sever conditions... To meet the military\'s fuel requirements,
scientists have developed carefully compounded blends of kerosene and
gasoline."

Continuing
Diesel Fuels
    " In 1892, Dr. Rudolph Diesel of Germany patented the engine that is
today one of our most powerful workhorses.
    " The diesel engine is fundamentally different from the gasoline
engine. A diesel\'s ignition is caused by the heat of compressed air in a
cylinder, while the spark plug performs that function in a gasoline
engine.
    " Early diesel engines were massive, built to withstand tremendous
heat and pressures... and they used almost any oil as fuel.
    "...Just as modern diesel engines have become specialized, the
diesel fuels that run them are highly refined for their specialized
uses. Modern diesel fuels are manufactured in several grades, ranging
from heavy oils to light kerosene type oil."

Continuing
Fuel Oils
    "...Fuel Oils are generally classified as either distillates or
residuals.
    " Distillates are the lighter oils..." used for home heating.

Some of the properties of the various fuels...

Gasolines examples: Unleaded Gasoline (various grades), Straight Run
Gasoline, Aviation Gasoline
- -are volatile liquids
- -have a boiling range of approximately 24C (75F) to 221C (430F)
- -have a flash point of -40C (-40F)

Kerosene examples: Straight Run Kerosene, Light Gas Oil, Jet A, JP-5,
JP-8, Heating Oil No.1, Diesel Fuel No.1
- -is combustible and moderately volatile
- -has a boiling range between 160C (320F) and 290C (554F)
- -has a flash point generally above 38C (100F)

Distillates  examples: Intermediate Gas Oils, Light Catalytic Cracked
Distillate, Light Cracked Gas Oil, Diesel Fuel No.2, Marine Diesel Fuel,
Home Heating Oil No. 2
- -are combustible
- -have a boiling range of approximately 163C (325F) to 357C (675F)
- -have an flash point generally above 60C (140F)

    So if the engine of the vehicle is a standard automotive engine
Gasolines (including aviation gasoline) will run. Due to the high octane
of the aviation gasoline, unless it is cut with normal gasoline, the
engine  is tuned to operate on it (compression ratio, carburetors,
injectors etc. adjusted) it will operate at a higher horsepower, with
the adverse effects of increased heat, probable pre ignition, and long
term damage to the internal components of the engine.

    If it is a diesel engine either the kerosene family, or the
distillates will probably work. The various products will have an effect
on the horse power generated by the engine. Heavier fuels (in the
distillate family) may require that the fuel injector porting be
adjusted.

    Not yet mentioned are the various additives, Gasolines in particular
have a number of agents (proprietary to each refiner) that enhance the
self-cleaning abilities of the fuel. Straight Run gasolines (direct from
the refining process) will probably tend to foul fuel injectors and
spark plugs in the long run. Distillates will have the same tendency if
used in diesel engines, (as an aside the gentleman who spoke of using
kero in his home heater, this is expensive but probably a good thing,
the kero will tend to clean the ports in the heater\'s burner, and won\'t
clog the filters at anything near the same rate, but it costs, the price
of the additional refining steps, and supply and demand).

At any rate that\'s as much as I\'m going to go into this tonight.
Specific (non-proprietary) details are available on request ;^). Hope it
helps.

PS. Any of the three fuels will operate quite nicely in a gas operating
turbine, providing the fuel injection is set up to atomize the liquid.
And I personally think that the Traveller vehicles will operate on
electrical motors, the will operate in anything but volatile atmosphere,
and considering fusion+ (hand wave) are probably more efficient for
exploration purpose. Now adapting those laser power packs to take the
place of that fuel cell, that\'s someone else\'s problem!

	In an earlier campaign I had the Aslan misinterpreting the meaning 
of some of the texts stamped on the side of the \'original\' jump 
drive. Thinking they were poems of some sort or spells of fortune or 
something quite crucial to the operation of the ship (at least from a 
male Aslan viewpoint), they faithfully reproduced the inscriptions.

	The\'s why all Aslan military starships still have their jump drives

	I\'ve interpreted the massive fuel requirements so that most of the 
"fuel" required by fusion reactors are not hydrogen, but liquid 
nitrogen, argon, etc. used as coolant, which needs to be replenished 
annually. Very little of actual fuel (deuterium) is needed.

Isn\'t there a blue glow coming from the maneuver drives.  Could this be
Elvis\' veiled way of warning us to stay away from thruster plates and stick
with reaction drives.  Just what is the hidden dange of t-plates? Could
they have a hidden environmental impact? Could they be guiding some unknown
enemy riding on the Empress Wave toward our section of space?

Eris,

ps. Notice how my name has the 3 outlying letters of Elvis\' holy name, and

Elvis\' chief prophet Roy Orbison.  Could there be a hidden meaning in my

   This depends upon the definition of \'popular\'.  Yes, there were
people from the "masses" who campaigned against it, but they were a
minority.  A *loud* minority, but a minority.  Note that this is not the
same as saying that farmers in Ohio (a mid-Western state) would have
bought slaves if they could have afforded them.  Opposing slavery in
your region is not the same as being opposed to it as an institution
throughout the country.  Indeed, while people in the U.S. tend to think
nationally first today, this was not the case prior to the American
Civil War.  Remember, Robert E. Lee resigned from the U.S. Army to join
the Confederate Army because Virginia voted for secession.  He
considered himself a Virginian first and an American second.

   While it is true that some politicians hoped that slavery would die
out after the importation of slaves was banned (some were still smuggled
in, btw), the clause did nothing to prevent slave traders from buying
slaves in North Carolina (or any other slave state) and selling them in
another state or territory in which slavery was permitted.  It also
didn\'t address the issue of ownership, which went unquestioned.

   A young Abraham Lincoln had occasion to travel to the South (in the
mid-1840s if memory serves me correctly), and while there saw what
slavery was all about.  Like most people in Illinois he hadn\'t given
much thought to it, but after his return, he became an abolitionist.

   I don\'t define "widespread" as something that was debated amongst the
intellectual elite.  Lucretia Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stanton held the
first (for the U.S.) Women\'s Rights Convention in 1848, but the masses
don\'t give the issue much thought for another 50 years.  Opposition to
the Vietnam War began almost as soon as it started, but it wasn\'t until
after the Tet Offensive that the opposition became widespread.  William
Lloyd Garrison may have begun publishing an abolitionist newspaper in
1831, but its circulation wasn\'t all that large outside of the local
region in which it was published.  It is important to remember that
there is a period of time (sometimes lengthy) between the appearance of
a movement and the moment when that movement becomes significant.

   We know based upon the diaries, papers, and other primary evidence
from that era.  The South prior to 1850 is concerned with limitations
being placed on the spread of slavery.  Southerns in part supported the
Mexican War because of the prospect that it would open vast new areas of
land to the expansion of slavery.  After 1850, and particularly after
1852, the debate begins to shift toward the whole concept of slavery and
whether or not it should be allowed to continue.  That is why the other
steps you mention were put into place.

   See my comments above.  The appearance of a movement doesn\'t make it
widespread.

   One further note: I can approach the issue of slavery with the
detachment of a mostly Caucasian male whose ancestors have their roots
firmly planted in Appalachia and never owned slaves for a reason--I fit
the profile.  Slavery was an abomination that should have never been
allowed to take root and continue in a country that prided itself as a
beacon for freedom and liberty in a world that had little of either. 
Enough said.

   There would be dramatic regional differences on how people both
inside and outside the early Third Imperium would view their place in
the universe and how history unfolded.  We still see this even in 1117
when Vilani and Solomani discuss the Rule of Man.

   The problem is, what internal evils confront the Third Imperium?  And
assuming that they exist, how do you expose them without fear of
reprisal?  Remember, the U.S. had the First Admendment--what does the
Third Imperium have?

    'body' => 'I have played this game since the beginning.  I am surprised that nobody
ever challenged my statement that I have been a Traveller fan since 1974.

That was my first experience at role-playing, and I wanted a Sci-Fi
setting.  Needless to say, when Traveller was released, I was happy,
and bought a copy as soon as possible.  My first character was a
Baron, poor with few credits to his name.

I\'m sure everyone remembers those first subsectors rolled up before
one appeared in print (Adventure 1: Kinunir?).  I even had friends
that rolled up neighboring Jewell or Lanth subsectors, only to "move"
when the rest of the Spinward Marches slowly appeared.

What\'s the point Leroy?

Well, most of my friends in gaming, from the University of Colorado\'s
Strategic Games Society (where I met J.P. in 1975), quickly learned a
strategy of adapting to Traveller.  Of course, I helped develop this
methodolgy.  It was very basic--read and buy all that you could, study,
study, and study.  Know the universe of Traveller inside and out.

Differing strategies were applied by different individuals, but we all
had one goal in mind--make our campaigns bullet-proof from having new
material "walk all over" the spare-time work we had done.  I even
killed off Strephon in 1109, as a means of trying to establish my own
interpretation of Traveller\'s universe.  I fractured the rimward areas
of the Third Imperium, and had factional fighting going on, with the
Domain of Sol a major player (4-5 years pre-MT).  Sound familiar?  <G>

The CUSGS spawned a number of Traveller campaigns.  I can think of
four without even trying.  The point of all of this is that we were
serious gamers.  In fact, when I read some of the things about Marc
and Frank\'s start at Bloomington, I felt an immediate sort of affinity
with these guys at GDW.  I was one of the first to order Triplanetary.
Some of you may remember the 4" x 4" x 30?" box it came in.

We got good at laying out our campaigns to allow us to stay in "synch"
with the published universe, yet had a degree of independence, so that
we were not waiting around for something new to come out and find out
that we had guessed wrong, or chose something that was going to be
published over, as it were.  This design philosophy works.

I am writing all of this because it took me awhile to reach an
understanding about why a few were so adamant about the notion of past
published evidence for a high tech level RoM.  It was (at first) a little
shocking to see the lengths which some would go to try and hush me up on
this subject.  I seldom encountered this on the HIWG list, but they are a
group of budding writers after all, and are always trying to figure new
angles on things.

When you are thinking about writing for the Traveller universe, there
is a rather cumbersome burden you might feel, about doing it right.  That
is why I have been so vocal about how I see just _how_ compatible the guys
doing T4 stuff are.  They have done a good job of backward compatibility
and should be commended for it.

In the earliest days, many people contributed to the development of the
Traveller Universe.  Ideas on background and technology surfaced and were
rewritten in different forms one or two supplements later.  Referee\'s had
to be quick on their feet, but it was good for the collective thinking
behind a consistent universe.  The creative ferment was thick with rich
ideas and worlds to conquer.  This time, now, is the same for T4.

The discussion over the past month, that I started on this list has shown me
that it is not a subject to be taken lightly, but at the same time, it is
something that can _not_ be done by consensus.  Perhaps TML has been
around as long as Traveller.  I\'ve had e-mail for about 17 years now, but
I never ventured out onto the network until the past five or so years.

TML is a new experience for me, and I am glad I "came over" here.  Until
now, I had dealt only with people whose primary interest was chewing fat
over the "facts" of the Traveller universe, and do not take it personally
when you tell them, "Yeah, except that on page n of book Y, it says ..."
I tend to not like the condescending approach of telling someone, "Yes,
that is a really excellent point, but I do have a problem with the
interpretation that Jump fuel is not expended by the Jump drive."  I\'ve
been around the game long enough to know when I\'m being shortchanged on
the rules--you practically have to have that skill to referee.

In the past few years when I ventured out onto the net, I came to the
conclusion that there were a lot of people who did not let e-mail come
between their conclusion and yours, and so perhaps I expected a little
more rawhide from the TML.  I have to actually say that all those times
Doug Berry told me he was offended by something I wrote, that I figured
it was an emotional imbalance ruse.  If that was the case then so be it.
If that was not the case, I am truly sorry for any offense.

At the same time, I am not perfect either (surprise :).  One of my last
posts had forgotten a smiley face when I made the "Clinton, Hale, et al"
comparison.  That was from a joke that Harold apparently forgot from a
month ago when he intended to post his Netscape bookmarks of astronomy
references to the HIWG list.  Accidentally, his whole list went out,
but fortunately for Harold, only I and Bryan Borich know what was on
that list. :)  Anyway, was intended to be a reminder (for Harold) of a
really funny and somewhat recent moment, not an insult.  (Harold and I
think the same of Clinton, so I know how much it would offend him if I
had really meant to compare the two.)  For that slipup Harold, I do
apologize.  It was only intended as a joke and somehow that colon didn\'t
make it into the final version.

I never intended to come across as if I were "stomping on anyone\'s face."
But at the same time, when I focus on discussing Traveller, I really
concentrate on that and probably loose all manners.  Just let me say that
before you go finding offense in something I may have posted here, before
you go off "retaliating", remind yourself that I have no intention of doing
so, and while perception is a form of reality, you and I both know that it
is _only_ as real as we make it.  If you still persist in believing that I
am going out of my way to offend you, write me offline and point it out.
We can discuss it like gentlemen.

We can clear the air and get on with things.  I am approachable and (I
think) reasonable.  At the same time, don\'t blame me for what the game\'s rich
and diverse background has provided.  The intended outcome is the development
of a sense of wonder--the true, original spirit of Traveller.

Recently, a friend wrote me concerning what had transpired on TML about the
RoM TL discussion.  He was concerned that I was "canonizing" a high tech
for the RoM.  The Tech Level of the RoM has already been decided.  I am just
helping people to see a possible interpretation of the track record for the
facts that support this current, and in my opinion correct, background
revelation.  Many of you may have already established a precedence in your
campaigns for a lower tech level RoM.  The stuff referee\'s are made of is
explaining to players how the universe has changed, but not in so many words,
and not letting them know there was a change--just a change in _their_
perceptions.  If we do not allow a new writer (not necessarily me) to come
along, and fill in some holes, we are condemning our game to stagnation.

J.P. reminds me that his birthday, April 1st (why do I have two players with
that birthday?), became known as April Fool\'s Day (or All Fools Day) when
certain stick-in-the-muds refused to accept moving New Year\'s Day back
from April 1 to January 1 as part of the Gregorian Calendar reforms.  That is
what I was trying to show with my Edsel Gouch example.  We old Traveller
afficionados don\'t want to find ourselves in a similar position in
relationship to new changes in the game.

The friend offline informed me that he had read my JTAS articles as a
13-year old first learning Traveller.  (I will save him potential
embarassment by not mentioning his name, since I didn\'t permission to
quote him here.)  This reminded me of just how long I have been doing things
for this game and my campaign.  I have to try and remember that many of you
are not the friends I have played, discussed, argued, and shared a _love of
the game with_.  I am used to a lot of give and take in these kinds of
discussions, so please forgive me if I occasionally forget that I consider
issues about the game first.

If, and that is a big IF, I have a chance to develop a RoM sourcebook for
T4, my experiences and love of the game will be drawn entirely upon to try
and live up the spirit and attitude I have tried to share with you here.

There is an old Hiver proverb that goes, "If it can be insulted, it can be
manipulated."  I try very hard not to be manipulated, so my being insulted
is right out!

Under TNE, however, with it\'s 1stere per year fuel requirements for
scoutship PP\'s, such fuel useage indicates far TOO much energy if all JFuel

If we use this JumpSpace^2 theory we still will have a maximum distance
of Jump 36 (6^2), interestingly enough jump 36 is the maximum distance a
misjump may cover.  You may be on to something here, however it needs
further amplification to explain all those jump 11, jump 17, & other
strange jump numbers a misjump may produce.

of MT starships (those design rules take a *long* time ... )?  Anyone 
willing to sell or photocopy(!) any of this stuff?

  IIRC, doesn\'t the hydride actually comprise the hydrogen all being

    'body' => 'Travellers often deal with cultures on different planets and with different 
technologies.  Yet it\'s amazing how varied two cultures can be, despite 
being on the same planet and possessing the same technologies, e.g. Japan 
and America.  Certain cultures favour informality (e.g. Britain and, even 
more so, the Netherlands), others are more attached to authority and 
centralisation (Russia, much of Africa).  Some countries value the 
individual (USA, France), while others value the team (China, Hungary).

Here are a few ideas to help put together the makings of a culture that 
will excite and interest players: rituals; symbols; modes of education; the 
rules of \'savoir-vivre\'; values; heroes; myths; religion ...

Various studies have classified cultural differences.  For example, the 
criteria of Masculinity-Femininity, i.e. the way by which a society 
structures the roles of men and women and, possibly more interestingly, the 
relative importance of "masculine values" (work, career, knowledge ... ) or 
"feminine values" (thoughtfulness, quality of life ... ).  Cultures with a 
high Masculinity include the USA, with its high work ethic but poor social 
security, and cultures with a high Femininity include the Netherlands, 
where there is a stronger emphasis on quality of life.  Other criteria 
include Power Distance (degree of hierarchy), the degree of Individualism 
and the degree of Uncertainty.  Alien behaviour from non-aliens may 
surprise players more than Vagr behaving badly.

Assuming your players aren\'t the PGMP-zapgun squad, you could stir interest 
by encouraging players to reduce incomprehension and non-violent conflict.  
Openness, curiosity, prudence and careful observation will aid adaptation to 
a new culture.  Learning to pay attention to and follow local customs and 
behaviours, before even attempting to understand them, may be an interesting 
subplot to an adventure.

I hope this sparks off a few ideas and responses,

William,

As I said, this is *my* interpretation of how the jump drive works, and by
now you should know I care very little about "canonical" dogma when it

automatic weapons at late TL3/early TL4. So I sat down with G3G (since I
prefer it to the FF&S sequences for early weapons) and came up with the ENL
Libertad. Its a weapon which could be produced in late TL3, though its more
properly an early TL 4 weapon. The cartridge has a muzzle energy of 531j
(about the same as a modern 9mm parabellum). The biggest problems with it are
going to be the huge quantities of smoke it would produce during automatic
fire and the fouling caused by the black powder propellant. Despite its
difficulties, it would still come as a nasty suprise to complacent high tech
characters.

           The ENL Libertad
The Libertad is a unique weapon. It is manufactured in a variety of small
workshops on Jakob for the Ladian National Army (Ejercito Nacional de Ladia
or ENL) and is the closest this organisation comes to having a standard issue
weapon. Given the circumstances of it\'s manufacture, most examples show a
suprising degree of craftmanship and reliablity. The weapon itself is a
triumph of TL 3 engineering, the equal of many TL 5 or 6 designs. It is a
bullpup combat rifle firing 6mm cased black powder ammunition from a
detachable 40 round magazine. The Libertad can fire in either semiautomatic
or full cyclic (400rpm) modes, using a simple slam fire blowback action. The
coarse nature of it\'s black powder propellant leads to a considerable amount
of fouling. This problem is alleviated to a degree by the inclusion of deep
cleaning groves in the action. However the Libertad will still foul if used
for extended periods without adequate cleaning (decrease reliability by one
step for each 80 rounds fired without cleaning). It should also be remembered
that the black powder propellant will produce considerable amounts of smoke,
which will rapidly obsure visibility. This will be particularly noticeable
when using cyclic fire.

The Libertad is virtually unavailable off Jakob, where it\'s possession (or
that of any other firearm) is a summary capital offence. However it has been
estimated that several hundreds of thousands of these weapons have thus far
been manufactured and some have made it off world, were they command high
prices amongst collectors. It is rumoured that Konig Arms is intending to
start production of a reproduction in the near future to capitalise on this
market.

Weapon: ENL Libertad
Action: Blowback - singleshot, cyclic (400)
Ignition: Percussion
Tech Level: 3
Calibre: 6mm ENL cased
Penetration: 3
Range: short
Malfunction: reliable (see notes below)
Shots: 40
Mass: 3.4kg
Reloads: 0.5kg
Length: 72.8cm
Cost: Cr 160 (Cr 800 plus off world)
Incidentals: 40 rounds ball: Cr 3.6 (0.4kg)
             empty 40 round magazine: Cr 10 (0.1kg)

Whilst the Libertad is theoretically a reliable weapon, the nature of it\'s
manufacture leads to considerable variety in quality. For each weapon throw
1D; a 1, 2 or 3 indicates a reliable weapon, a 4 or 6 indicates an unreliable
weapon, whilst a 6 indicates a very unreliable weapon.

     **Leader article**
The need for regulation of starship armarment

Much has been made recently of the efforts by the ISBA to develop a consitant
code of practice for the armarment of starship. Indeed some have decried it
as "an established cabel seeking to secure it\'s dominance" (Dame Sylia Lath,
104-20, as reported in the Times of Sylea). Others have asked why a new code
is required, claiming that the regulatins in place are adequate. In truth
neither of these views is accurate. The new code does nothing to assist those
currently in the market or hinder those who seek to enter it. In fact it will
assist the new players in the growing shipbuilding industry by giving them a
consistant and universal base to work from, nothing hinders entrenuprial
spirit more than uncertainty. And that is most assuredly what we have today,
a hodge podge of local regulations and limitiations which are a moras even
the most experianced lawyers and bureacrats struggle to understand. What is
legitimate and acceptable on one world may indeed be cause for criminal
prosecution on another. Currently there is nothing to stop an unscrupulous
ship owner from purchasing military control systems on one world and adding
sophisticated weaponry on another.

The new code of practice (shortly to be presented to the Moot for enactment
into Imperial law) acts to end the current illogical and confusing situation.
It sets out realistic and enforcable limits on the armarment of ships without
restricting those who have legitimate reason to need advanced and
sophisticated weapon systems. Let us ever forget that there are cases were
ships will require weaponry better than that which is required in the well
patrolled spacelanes within the Imperium; it would be a foolish Captain who
would venture into the lawless regions without the Imperium without adequate
precautions.

Therefore let us embrace these new regulations as a sign of the growing
maturity of the new Imperium. No longer do ships require massive firepower to
fend off the depredations of piracy. Now the Imperial Navy can guarantee the
security of the space lanes and must be regarded as the most effective weapon
carried by any civilian ship.

(The full text of the Draft Code of Practice is included as an addendum to
this issue of the newsletter)

     **News**

124-20: GSbAG announced today that its quarterly profit was up 4.2% on its
performance in the previous quarter. Shariik Harla, Vice President of GSbAG
attributed the strong growth to the rapidly expanding civilian market. "With
the increase in interstellar trade there has been noticeable growth in the
construction of merchant vessels. Our figures clearly reflect this, as do the
improved profit margins of many other companies. I think we can expect strong
growth in all areas associated with the shipbuilding industry for the
forseeable future."

137-20: The Phoenix Corporation today announced it was entering into a long
term purchasing contract for drive systems with Michaelson Coil and Impeller
LIC, for the supply of drive systems for ships constructed in Phoenix yards.
Phoenix, who had previously relied on Zimm Gravitics LIC drive systems,
strenously denied that the change of supplier had any relation to the ongoing
BSSHTS investigations into Zimm over the loss of the Tukera liner "Granier".
Sir Jermani Danjo CEO of Phoenix stated "We have always found Zimm products
to be of the highest quality and have no doubts as to the reliability of the
units already installed. The move to MCI drives is simply a commercial
decision, to put it bluntly, they came up with a better deal."

145-20: In resposne to wide spread industry debate, the  Civilian Disarmament
Committee of the ISBA issued it\'s prelimanary report on a unified code of
practice regarding the armarment of civilian vessels. The draft document (see
full text attached) calls for the division of both offensive and defensive
systems into four catergories based on the relative power of the weapons.
Whilst the code of practice has no legal standing as yet, it is widely
expected that they will soon be introduced to the Moot as the Civilian
Spaceways Safety Bill.

170-20: In a highly publicied accident today, an X-Tech reseach craft fitted
with an experimental plasma weapon system was destroyed during a test firing.
There have been no reports as to casualties as yet, but informed sources
indicate that the craft was an uncrewed robot drone. X-Tech has yet to
formally comment on the incident, but it is widely believed that they are
looking into the possibility of sabotage.

175-20: The board of the ISBA announced today a major upcoming event, the
First Core Secror Rally. Whilst remaining tightlipped as to the exact nature
of the event Sir Josph Califor, Coordinator of the ISBA stated "Whilst it is
still in the planning stages as yet, this will be an exciting opportunity for
the industry to show its new maturity and technical prowess. We at the ISBA
feel sure this event will capture the publics imagination as nothing before
and we hope to make the event a regular occurance".

     **Stockmarket report**

Most companies associated with the ship construction industry are making a
good showing in the market currently. Anylists attribute this to the
continuing growth of the sector. The recent announced aquisition programs by
the Imperial and several local Navies have seen significant gains for
companies heavily involved in military contracting. GSbAG\'s recently
announced strong second quarter profit growth is a good example of this and
has seen it climb 55 points over the last month alone. However, it is felt
the the success or failure of the industry ultimately rests on the civilain
sector. Most companies involved in this area have posted very healthy second
quarter profits, leading to Zirunkariish upgrading the credit rating of
several of the leading players over the past few months. Cautious investors
are still shying away from companies engaged in cutting edge technologies
such as X-Tech, but many feel that these offers exciting prospects for the
future and are now adding them to their portfolio\'s.

Ce Acatl Corporation is very pleased to submit its entry for the third ISBA
THUDDD Competition: the CP-5R "Tlaxcala" class Patrol Cruiser. Tlaxcala
(tlahsh-CAH-lah) was a region of prestellar Terra noted for its proud warrior
tradition; we have attempted to live up to this reputation with our vessel,
a worthy addition to any navy or corporate security force.

A patrol cruiser must be capable of fulfilling a wide variety of operational
roles.  Chief among these are:

* Commerce escort, customs, and anti-piracy duty
* Search and rescue
* Coordination with larger fleets in system defense and interdiction

The Tlaxcala performs admirably in each of these roles. In battle, this
vessel is both deadly and tough. Its primary armament is a devastating 1.3
gigawatt Thompson-Simmons bay laser, capable of crippling (or destroying
outright) most pirate vessels at multi-lightsecond ranges. As short range
backup offensive and point-defense weaponry, two independent 30 megawatt
T-S turret lasers provide that added measure of confidence any ship captain
going into combat desires. Twin Dohetti sandcasters and tough hull armor let
the Tlaxcala shrug off any fire from the bad guys. Finally, an industry
standard missile turret designed expressly for this vessel, linked to an
ample missile armory, gives the Tlaxcala the added punch to deal with larger
targets...and a fully integrated master fire director makes sure those
punches land *hard*. Finally, the standard crew complement includes four
ship\'s troops, to be employed as escorts during customs inspections, as 
boarders, or as security aboard prize vessels.

None of this does any good if you can\'t find the enemy, of course -- and
that\'s why the Tlaxcala mounts an advanced active/passive sensor suite
(conforming to Imperial Navy standards) to help you flush even the
stealthiest quarry from cover. This capability is an important asset in
search and rescue operations as well, as is the military-grade long-range
redundant commo suite -- critical for coordinating with larger fleets. If a
ship is in the system...lying in wait for helpless freighters, or drifting
with a blown powerplant and a malfunctioning radio...you\'ll find it in time
with the Tlaxcala.

And get there in time, too. With a CAC J2 drive, and 4G maneuver capability,
this ship has the legs to get you to the action fast enough to make a
difference.  Fuel scoops and an on-board purifier let you operate away from
civilization indefinitely, for those long patrols.

The Tlaxcala comes equipped with a two-bed state-of-the-art sickbay, to
handle both routine medical situations while on prolonged duty and
combat-related injuries. To stabilize more seriously traumatized patients for
transport to a hospital, a 4-person emergency low berth is also provided.

A minimal 20-Std hangar is provided, but no small craft are shipped with the
vessel. We suggest a 20-Std fast pinnace, two 10-Std launches or fighters, or
four 5-Std fighters. Our sales department will be happy to discuss the
options with you, and can provide assistance in arranging a coordinated
purchase plan that suits your needs.

With all three command crew in large staterooms, and the 21 other crew in
single-occupancy small staterooms, one large and one small stateroom remain
unoccupied. These can be used by visiting personnel, as additional storage
space, or as briefing rooms. More rooms can easily be freed up by imposing
double occupancy on some or all of the crew.

Finally, the price of the Tlaxcala is attractively low -- both in terms of
initial purchase price, and cost of ownership.  Ce Acatl Corporation is
committed to full compliance with Imperial and ISBA standards in ship design
and construction, and to the use of off-the-shelf standard components
wherever practical. This standardization benefits our customers in two ways:
Low vessel unit cost, and easy acquisition of replacement parts.
Additionally, the craft can be operated and maintained by any
Imperially-certified crew without special training.

The Ce Acatl "Tlaxcala" -- fast, versatile, powerful, inexpensive. Don\'t
launch your next patrol with anything less!

The -Terrapin- is an 80m cylinder, flared slightly at the aft for better
control when wilderness refueling. The ship devotes over a third of its gross
displacement to cargo storage, enough to prove profitable on any run. But
there is more to the -Terrapin- than carrying freight!
   
The -Terrapin- is equipped with powerful Quinn-Arturo "Phase III" jump
drives, allowing jump 3. Standard thrusters grant constant acceleration of
1g, and can be overdriven for brief periods if necessary. Power is provided
by a custom-designed X-tek Fusion plant, and is fueled for one year\'s
operation at full load.
   
The electronics suite has been designed with the idea that most places the
- -Terrapin- travels will not have local travel control. Active EMS sensors are
accurate out to 10 LS, passive sensors to 5. This allows early detection of
any threat, to allow the maximum decision time for the Captain.
Communications are routed through either a .3 Mw maser array, or broadcast by
the 1 Mw radio system. Defensive EMS systems include a standard EMS jammer
(120k km radius) and a strong area jammer (90k km radius.)
   
If the worst comes, this turtle has teeth! Mounting twelve Isher Artifact
L-1013 95 Mj laser turrets, organized into four batteries by Navy standard
FDC-11A2 master fire direction centers, the ship can bring effective fire on
its enemies. (Note: no allowance has been made for direct turret control. All
weapons are operated from the MFC.) While these powerful beams slice at your
foe, you can feel secure, guarded by thick armor, 6 sand casters, a *15 Mw*
nuclear damper, and a 2 Mw meson screen. It isn\'t a warship, but the
- -Terrapin- can certainly hold her own in a fight.
   
Interface operations will normally be carried out be the -Terrapin Transit-
shuttle, included in the purchase price.

The ship has a crew of 49, including a full squad of security personnel and
berths for a five person research/science section. The science section is
intended to include such personnel as linguistic sophontologists, historians,
and others to assist in making contact with worlds that may not have seen a
Starship since Twilight. -Terrapins- have ten small staterooms for
passengers. When no passengers are boarded, the spare rooms are designed to
be used for extra berthing space to relieve stress, or as crew recreation
facilities. Also standard are thirty low passage berths. Workshops are
provided, capable of fabricating any but the largest, most complex parts.
Technical specifications are provided in both computer and hard format to aid
repairs, and most systems having self-diagnostic/repair aid programs. A
general purpose laboratory can be found on "C" deck. This small facility is
not designed for in-depth research, but will suffice for most inquiries. The
ship\'s sick bay can accommodate up to 16 patients in a pinch, though 10 is
standard.
   
A word about cost. Many designers prefer to work with modular components,
accepting "close enough" as a substitute for workmanship, and then claim that
the savings in cost justifies the act. Don\'t be fooled. When you are 50pc
from the nearest help, close enough isn\'t good enough. Trans-C goes to the
trouble of designing to the most exacting tolerances because we feel your
life is worth it. Don\'t you agree?

Description:

Of average height and Weight Josphanoer Cailfor graying hair shows that he
has reached middle age. Josph though is still quite physically fit due to his
daily exercise. He is considered handsome to most though it steams more form
his presence then his physical appearance his piercing blue eyes are just one
example of this.

Biography:

Born on the desert world of Zimiin of Donko and Cythan Cailfor, Josphanoer
Cailfor or Josph to friends was undisciplined child and teenager. Josph
though was not a thug--his rebellion was that of a thrill seeker. He took up
Grav Vehicle racing at an early age and hasn\'t stopped.

While in College Josph  bounced back and forth finally settling on studying
Gravitics, the key to his only love racing. In his junior year Josph began
work as a page for the Zimiin Representative to the Moot.It was during this
period that Josph first meet and worked for Djugasuili Lentuli. Upon his
graduation in year 0 he went to work for Lentuli in the Bureau for Installer
Affairs.

For 12 years he worked in the Department of Technology Assessment, of the BIA
being posted to several worlds to help with technology transfer problems
especially in Gravitics. In his 9th year Josph was shot in the back and
paralyzed while trying to help fellow hostages escape from anti Imperium
terrorist. For his actions he was knighted into the Order of the Cross of
Arlea and retired from the BIA. He spent three years recuperating from the
injury.

After leaving the BIA, Sir Josph applied his skills to the world of commerce,
and became a successful businessman, involved in numerious projects until he
was invited by Talili Reycal (CEO of the newly established Founder Ship
Works) to become the fleedling companies chief negotiator. During this
period, Sir Josph became convinced of the pressing need for greater
cooperation and organisation within the shipbuilding industry. The outcome of
which was the creation of the ISBA.

Currently Sir Josph remains as the chief negotiator of Founder Ship Works;
but he also holds the post of coordinator of the ISBA. Sir Josph retains his
love of grav racing and maintians his own highly successful team from his
private funds. He is also frequently seen on the amatuer circuit, were he has
won numerous trophies. He was a close freind of fellow racer Corlan Cardell
and was frequently seen with him before his tragic and untimely death 8
months ago.

     **Addendum - Report from the Civilian Disarmament Committee**

To: The Imperial Shipbuilders Association
From: Alyn, Baron Wardn, President of Aurelian Industries
Re:  Report from the Civilian Disarmament Committee

Honored Imperial Citizens, Fellow Shipbuilders, Competitors...

I bring to you this day the results of the two-week study by the Civilian
Disarmament Committee, chaired by my humble self.  My colleagues on the
committee went to great effort to accomodate your concerns and comments, and,
even though some of these comments were diametrically oppossed to each other,
we have tried to make this document reflect the will of the entire
organization.

The proposal, which my sources tell me will be introduced before the moot as
the Civilian Spaceways Safety Act, has been reviewed by our legal staff, and
even a few trustworthy interested parties outside of this august body. It
represents our one true chance to influence Imperial law in an area very
important to us all; influence in a manner that will allow our industry to
thrive, but will prevent chaos and destruction in the glorious spacelanes
of our Empire.

Class I - Unregulated Equipment
          Availability - This equipment is available without restriction to
any ship-owning Imperial Citizen or any Non-Citizen with valid entry papers
for his or her vessel. This equipment is also available to non-shipowning
persons, subject to the local laws governing such equipment.
          Transferrability - This equipment may be freely transferred within
the Imperium by the legitimate owner to any ship-owning Imperial Citizen or
any Non-Citizen with valid entry papers for his or her vessel, or to
non-shipowning persons, subject to the local laws governing such equipment.
This equipment may also be transferred freely outside of the Imperium,
subject to the local laws governing such equipment.

Class II - Regulated Equipment
          Availability - This equipment requires a permit, issued and
monitored by the Imperial Starport Authority. This permit requires an annual
fee equal to 1% of the purchase price of the permitted equipment. Each peice
of Regulated Equipment requires a separate permit, and each permit is subject
to an annual renewal. Ships with Regulated Equipment are subject to
spot-inspections by Imperial authorities to verify the status of the permits
and associated equipment. Permits for Regulated Equipment are available to
ship-owning Imperial Citizens with no Imperial convictions outstanding, or to
Non-Citizens with a ship with a valid registration from an Imperial
member-state or client-state. Permits are generally not issued for
non-shipowners.
          Transferrability - Regulated equipment may be transferred within
the Imperium to other ship-owning Imperial Citizens, but the transferee must
first obtain a permit for the transferred Regulated Equipment. Permit fees
are non-refundable. Regulated equipment may not be transferred to
non-Imperial citizens without a waiver from the Imperial Starport Authority.
Permit holders are accountable for Regulated Equipment, and face possible
jail terms and/or fines equal to up to ten times the value of the Regulated
Equipment if such equipment is illegally transferred or used in a crime
against the Imperium.

Class III - Registered Equipment
          Availability - This equipment requires a permit similar to the
Class II permits, but also requires the ship owner to obtain this permit from
the Imperial Navy. This process requires the permit-seeker to prove the
necessity of the equipment in question, and generally involves an extended
investigation by the Imperial Navy. Registered Equipment permits are
available ONLY to Imperial Citizens, and only those with spotless records
with the Imperium. Because of the additional invesitgation efforts the Navy
requires, these permits require an annual fee equal to 5% of the
purchase price of the permitted equipment.
          Transferrability - Registered Equipment may only be transferred to
the manufacturer or to an Imperial agency. Permit holders are accountable for
Registered Equipment, and are subject to imprisonment, large fines and/or
ship seizure if such equipment is illegally transferred or used in a crime
against the Imperium.

Class IV - Restricted Equipment
          Availability - This equipment is restricted to Imperial vessels,
and is otherwise available only via a Ducal or Imperial Warrant. In the
extremely rare instances where such allowances are made, the ship is
required to be registered as an Imperial Fleet Reserve Vessel (subject to
emergency callup), and the equipment in question must still have Class III
permits.
          Transferrability - This equipment may not be transferred.  As the
equipment is either part of an Imperial vessel or based on an Imperial
Warrant, misuse of the equipment would effectively be an act of treason,
and punishable by death.

Class V - Prohibited Weapons
           Availability - Unavailable to non-Imperial vessels or persons.
           Transferrability - Non-Transferrable to non-Imperial vessels or
persons.

Appeared briefly in Southampton\'s Virgin but I went to buy it yesterday and
they\'d sold out.  No more for 2 weeks.  :-(\'s

Yes, but there are ways around this surely.

Andy Lilly seems to be doing a great job of promoting Traveller at the Euro
Gen Con last year and this year (yet to happen).

He also encourages BITS members to attend (and run Traveller games if
possible) many of the smaller events around the country.

Surely this could become a formalized arrangement if IG were serious about
representation but didn\'t want the expense?

(Actually, for all I know it may already be.  Sorry Andy - I\'m sure you can
speak for yourself.)

I think I can understand your sentiment here, ennobled, landed PCs are not
the stuff of Travelling tramp traders, mercenary Mercenaries and other
types of previously published adventures.

But Traveller is so much bigger than that.  I\'m convinced that the range of
possible adventures (even within MWMs Imperium) has only just been
scratched.

That\'s one of the reasons I found Pocket Empires so refreshing - it was
Traveller on an entirely different scale - but still Traveller.  Just as
Trillion Credit Squadron allowed space battles on a different scale and
World Builder\'s Handbook took scouting to new levels, there are facets of
Traveller we\'ve not yet explored.  (At least not in published rule books,
I\'m not counting home brewed adventures).

How about _Megacorporations_ - a kind of Pocket Empires for the traders
amongs us?
Or _Sword and Blaster_ for the detailing of duels (perhaps an update to En
Garde? [1])
Or some detailing of computers and how they work in Traveller?
Or...

....I\'m sure there\'s much more but limited imagination early in the morning
fails me!


I would certainly agree with you that landed nobles shouldn\'t become
regular parts of adventures all the time, but *an* element for use when the
mood strikes should be perfectly natural.

I\'m all for the *option*.

This might explaon why there are so many J1 designs floating around in

The EPR paradox is merely a paradox if one subscribes to the Copenhagen
interpretation of Quantum Mechanics but the Copenhagen interp. is only an
INTERPRETATION - it doesn\'t affect quantum mechanics math or physics one
iota.

>Back in 1995, a team of researchers transmitted Mozarts 40th symphony

No they didn\'t.

They merely transmitted the Mozart this and that with a phase speed of 5.7
c. The communication speed was below c as usual. There has been some more
or less layman speculation about using phase speed as FTL commo but anybody
doing the math will see that it doesn\'t work.

Quick now; how fast does the "end" of a lightbeam travel that is emitted
from a lighthouse with a light rotating at 1 round per second? The speed
will be pi()*beamlength*2, the beam length is c*t - thus the beam end
travels at more then lightspeed after 1 second and will continue to
accelerate forever.

How come nobody finds this bit of trivia as interesting as the phasespeed
one quoted? They are more or less the same phenomena but the latter is
easier to understand.

I\'m sorry if I sound a bit condescending but the above references are as
valid as the Roswell bullshit, cropcircles etc but tend to have followers
with slightly more schooling in science. They are perfect RPG props for
X-files adventures, GURPS atomic horrors etc but doesn\'t fit the hard SF
nature of Traveller (with thrusterplates, HEPLAR, gravfocussing and other
totally accurate scientific predictions ;)

	I\'ve found an old Travellers\' Digest (issue 16 IIRC) to be of far 
greater help than WBH when detailing various cultures. The article 
"Aspects of Culture" features over a dozen "cultural statistics", 
such as equality of sexes, value of life (both human and alien), work 
ethic etc.. Actually I have copies of the pages tacked over my desk. 
Been there for years, yet prove themselves useful every single time 
we play. :)

What an absolutley wonderful idea. I\'m sure the emperor will leap at 
this wonderful opportunity to fill his coffers with the monies from 
this really neat revenue gathering exercise. The Nobles and megacorps 
will be happy too, as these fees will put a lot of the more marginal 
small para-military operators out of business, thus increasing 
Mega-corporate influence in the imperial fringes.

There was no published MT literature on robots.  I have somewhere in my
collection a playtest draft of MT robot rules, by Rob Prior (?) downloaded
from GEnie long ago.  Anyone know its copyright status?  I seem to recall
that it required use of the CT Book 8: Robots rules.  The main point in it
was an increase in programming cost for higher skill levels for robots,
and an integration of some of the MT vehicle design rules. 

On Aliens, there were two DGP alien books, _Solomani and Aslan_ and 
_Vilani and Vargr_ (known affectionately as Cats and Rats and Cogs and Dogs
respectively.)  There may have also been a few bits and pieces in the MT
Journal, but I don\'t remember much about them.  The CT Alien books are
fairly adaptable.  The CT Darrian book was one of the last CT products.

For MT ship designs (plus other vehicles) you can find the archives of my
old designs on Jo Grant\'s web page.  There were two or three hundred designs
of all sorts, from the electric bicycle to a million displacement ton
battleship.  Some of the ships wouldn\'t actually work very well in combat,
but I think that most of the merchant ship designs were pretty reasonable.
A fellow named Scott (2-G) Kellogg did a slew of designs, too, which can be
fished out of the TML ftp archive at the University of Western Ontario if
it still exists.  Has anyone copied over the old TML archives to some easily
accessed web site?

seems pretty alarming to me). Never heard from IG, though. Since
they can apparently overlook a (nearly) free contact of ~2500
potential new Traveller fans and potential customers... I hope they

  Nicely put, I think - one of the things we have to deal with as
Traveller geeks is that things change over time, and that what is written
about the Traveller "past" often changes as new stuff comes along.

  However, I do think a certain degree of consistancy is in order.
Traveller today is very different from Traveller ten or twenty years ago -
the existance of that shared history and all that published stuff means
you don\'t have to make it up new every day like D&D - it\'s there already,
so you might as well use it.

  As for your comment about it being impossible to reach consensus on TML
or on some other forum, I have to disagree with you.  Some issues, like
the task debate, do have no ready resolution, but that often is because
the folks involved have fundmentally different assumptions (like should
skills or stats count for more?).  Other subjects do have a resolution,
because often we can point to one or another source that clears things up
to the point we can agree.  The Rule of Man tech level debate is an
example of that, I think - aside from yourself, we agreed that a tech
level of 12-low 13 was about right, with perhaps +1 in medical and
biotech.

  Now, if you mean consensus in the sense that _everyone_ agrees, well,
that might be hard, esp. since you seem convinced of your own
interpretation.  However, if we mean consensus in the sense of what _most_
or _almost all_ folks agree on, then I think we can achieve consensus -
just may not be one you or I specifically approve of.

  Central to my dislike of making the Rule of Man some really high tech
thing is that it makes M0 too much like TNE.  Don\'t get me wrong, I loved
TNE to death, Virus and all.  But chasing high-tech goodies works as a
plot-line once, and once only.  M0 should have its own flavor. 

   Anyway, those TL14 vac suits were an Anomaly, and they should stay that
way.

Actually, a MW-hour won\'t electrolyse that much hydrogen -- about .35 
m^3 is what I remember was calculated.

I did the calculations for the reaction

H2O(g) -> H2(g) + 1/2 O2 (g)

and assuming heat capacity at constant pressure is reasonably 
constant with temperature (didn\'t have enough data for water to do 
otherwise...) the temperature at which water spontaneously 
dissociates to H2 and O2 is a little under 4000K.  If anyone has an 
experimental number for this, I\'d be really interested...

I suspect that scooped water would be distilled before purification 
proper would begin to eliminate this problem.

True AFAIK (although the other junk may clog up the surface of the 
palladium pretty quickly and inhibit the process).

I suspect that it\'s possible to use the different probabilities of 
adsorption of H2 and D2 on metal surfaces to do the same job.  (See 
N.S. Munn & D.C. Clary, J. Chem. Phys. 105 (1996) 5258.)

H2 diffusion in Pd is mentioned in Munn & Clary, Chem. Phys. Lett.
266 (1997) 437.  There are some references to experimental work in 
there somewhere...


Fuel scooping:

In response to Dom\'s question about needing an enormous buffer stage 
between fuel scoop and holding tanks, I would agree with Leonard that 
it\'s probably not necessary.  I would envisage the 
compression of fuel to be accomplished by the ship\'s velocity 
relative to the atmosphere -- got to be pretty fast to collect all 
that fuel -- and combined with venturi-like nozzles to provide Joule 
cooling.  You may not quite be able to get LHyd straight off, but I\'m 
sure you can do a fair fraction of the work required.

Also, black powder isn\'t as fouling as this post would indicate. one of
the tests that the Army conducted on BP Cartridge rifles in the 1870\'s
was a continuous fire test: firing the thing until you couldn\'t shoot it,
or 1000 rounds, whichever came first. The Sharps .45-70 lost out to the
Remington because the cartridge eventually jammed in the breech, and the
person conducting the test broke off the ejection lever. By grabbing the
stock of the gun, and sticking his boot under the ejection lever and
pushing.

However, this brings up the point that guns like this could get around
such problems by using \'caseless\' ammo: paper cartriges were in very
common use from the early 1800\'s on through to the invention of brass
cased ammunition. No worries about jammed cartriges, and more importantly
for an underground insurrection, reloads can be made where ever you can
get some powder, paper and time.

Remember, although these little tidbits may sound like they don\'t hold
water, somewhere out there is the "blackbody radiation" problem of the
21st century. 

Experimental findings showed a discrete, stepped progression of
radiation from "black body" objects in the early 20th century, when
theory predicted a smooth output.  Gave rise to the basics of quanta,
the photon, if I recall right.

Better to explain what things mean rather than say "No, it doesn\'t." 
The actual results, math and meaning of many experiments are not
available to the layman, and misinterpretation often results.  As I
recall, this experiment was dealing with tunneling, and I considered it
a mathematical deal.  That doesn\'t mean something isn\'t happening we
don\'t have the "right angle" to pick up on, or use in the future.

If the "lighthouse" analogy is correct, then pusuit of the issue seems a
bit silly.  So why was it reported in magazines as being a sort of FTL?
Obviously someone thought something was there or was trying to gain
headlines(or grants.)  

We know all there is to know, all we need to work out is the details.

It is not my interpretation.  I just wanted to point out that there is
a way of looking at things to be consistent with T4.  I like using this
interpretation for playing T4 because "consistency is the bugaboo of good
pilots" as we used to say playing Fight in the Skies at the CUSGS.

Yeah, one of the dangers inherent in a bad fly by wire code.  That was a
fairly complex safeguard put into the system, but basically amounted to
the airplane thinking it knew better than the pilot what to do in any
given situation.

Your aviation industry is going more towards this direction, and it is
not just Airbus.  The first F-22 test aircraft crashed due to an
overcontrolling FBW code problem.  Maybe pilots will be obsolete in the
future with AI systems, but until then I advise keeping one around just
in case with a set of manual controls:)

My copy arrived a few weeks ago. It\'s good, but not great. If you intend to

Dom,

I used the MacLink Plus v8.1 Document Converter utility that came with
System 7.6.1, and that seemed to convert them fairly well to a Word 5.1
format for Mac.

My apologies, but I must reiterate that they did, and I must add that
the effect is unrelated to phase speed and instead depends on the
instantaneous trasmission of information by quantum tunneling of
microwave photons through the inner waveguide boundary layer, not
through the waveguide cavity itself.  The experiment was repeated
several times with varying results.  As I am no longer current in
physics (I am a naval engineer), I\'m afraid I can\'t tell too much more
without getting some facts wrong.  

But you are correct, the phase speed ideas are old and still effectively
useless for any sort of FTL communications.  That\'s why I didn\'t memtion
them.  This is something completely distinct and purely inexplicable as
far as classical physics is concerned.

Condescending, yes.  Correct, no.  Besides, the speed of light is
variable in vacuum depending upon the Casimir exclusion in effect in
that region (another surprise straight out of Quantum Mechanics.)

Now up on the Pan-Imperia web page is the newest version of Beginnings,
my Chargen program for T4. This is v0.92, and will take a character all the
way through mustering out. If y\'all will give it a good test drive, kick the 
tires and all, and let me know about any bugs and such, I can get the code
firmed up and start working on prettying up the interface a lot, and then
get started roughing out some of the changes that The Boss has presented
to us in the T4.1 file.

The link on the page has the wrong file name listed, but it will get you the
correct file; I just haven\'t had time to update the page text yet.

New to version 0.92 :

        1) Fixes the "Immortality" bug in which aging rolls stopped after age
        75, and aging crises had no effect. Rolls now must be taken against
        Endurance with an assumed +2 modifier for medical help. I now
        guarantee the character will eventually die :)

        2) Re-enabled the ability to store a character as a disk file rather
        than only printing them out for those who like to import the character
        into a editor for formatting.

        3) Removed the ability to draft characters after the first term. This
        has helped with the "Immortality" problem.

        4) Have eliminated "automatic eligibility" for careers after the first
        term. This strikes me as more realistic, as the Army ain\'t gonna
        necessarily want you when your 42, as well as closing another loophole
        for the "Immortal Ensigns". 

        5) Finally came up with an official name for the program :) Welcome
        to "Beginnings."

        6) Characters can now only serve 7 (voluntary) terms *total* in any
        one service regardless of attempts at reenlistment. This prevents
        characters from serving 3 terms, leaving, re enlisting, serving 4
        terms, leaving, re enlisting, serving 3 more terms, etc., closing
        another immortality loophole.

        7) Characters may no longer reenlist in a career that they have been
        injured in or rejected in.
                       
        8) Fixed the bug crashing the program when the wrong type of input
        was given, e.g. typing a letter when a number was expected.

        9) Implemented the ability of Scholars to take a stint in college in
        lieu of a career term.

        10) Implemented rolls for mustering out.

        11) Variety of cosmetic fixes, color changes, etc.

Thanks in advance for testing it out, and I hope it\'s as much fun for y\'all
to use as it was for me to code it!

Interruptions should not be allowed while one is typing away at a console.

Strike that last paragraph above that I wrote.  It doesn\'t even make sense
to me.

Yes, it is my interpretation, but it is an interpretation made with the
experience of fact fitting.  I guess there are several passages in T4 that
seem _very_ clear to me, and not to others.  It is quite possible that I
am reading them with too much bias, _and_ it is quite possible that others
aren\'t reading them with enough bias, _or_ both is the case.

I will guarantee you all that if it ever becomes important enough for me
to _really_ know what the "truth" is, I will flat out ask Marc.  Please
don\'t take this as another call to Marc to post his opinion on the matter.
He _really_ is busy and it _really_ is not an important enough question to
ask at this time.

Let\'s look at it from another angle.  Until the Travellers\' Digest adventures
took their little sidetrip to Kusyu, the Aslan were a Major Race.  If all of
these intriguing adventure ideas had been discussed in advance, I doubt that
anyone would have ever seen it in print.  Yet today, it is pretty much
canonical (I hate using that word now, and I am not trying to offend someone
who did not buy into that plot twist, I didn\'t for a long time.)

Again, I want to see more holes filled in.  I find it enjoyable that I can
meet someone new from somewhere else, and talk a consistent talk with them,
irrespective of their age (i.e. were they raised on CT, MT, TNE, or T4).

While perhaps things were off to a shaky start with IG, it is very clear to
me that their product is maturing.  Whenever I tell Marc that it bothers me
to see someone bashing T4, he says, "I bash T4."  Well that is fine, and
even makes sense.  Afterall, if he didn\'t think that way, he wouldn\'t be
doing his best to fix it.  I guess I have come out of the New Era into this
one with a realization that we have lucked out one more time, and someone
is publishing our game.

Time to get back to solving differential equations as applied to a leaky
sandbag (mass-spring systems).  (If anyone wants to tutor me over the next
two weeks until finals, I could post more often here. :)

You are talking about a TL 10-13 electromagnetic reactor here.  At high
TL\'s the Imperium is able to make superdense materials-implying
manufaturing sources of VERY high artificial gravity.  Use a gravity
point, something like a singularity but not as deep, to just throw in
whatever you get out of the gas giant.  Use nuclear dampers to
strengthen the strong nuclear force.  The hydrogen will fuse, depending
on the gravity, and the rest wont.  Dump your exhaust overboard.  Using
the energy efficiently is another matter.

Well, I just got it for my birthday (as well as LWH, The Babylon
Project, GURPS Mecha and GURPS Reign of Steel - an SFRPG bonanza 8-).
I\'m about two-thirds of the way through it, and so far I\'d rate it about
the same as Alien Archive - not quite as good as M0 or (my favourite)
PE, but better than any of the other supplements I\'ve seen for T4.
YMMV.

Oh, it\'s not quite true to say there\'s been nothing about it on the
list - my "Psionics & Society: Right of Reply" was a veiled comment on
the third chapter.  I *really* like the way Traveller doesn\'t pretend to
offer an objective view of social/political matters!  The "alternative
view" sections are fun (if a more instant-gratificationist way of doing
things than the old days).  I did feel the anti-psionic view was poorly
represented, but (after an initial grump) I\'ve decided that\'s fine - I
just read it as a pro-psionic media slant.  When we get to the Psionic
Suppressions, I will want to see some *reasoned* arguments against
psionics...partly because I can\'t think of many (other than the problems
of transition), and I want somebody else to do my thinking for me! ;-)

I\'ll try and comment some more when I\'ve finished reading it.

	Hehe. hehhee. Bwahahahaahaa!

	Somebody my gf knows from IRC works for the Finnish Air Force and 
slipped a military secret a while back fnord. He\'s one of the guys 
who customize F/A-18 Hornet (FAI\'s latest acquisition) fly-by-wire 
systems or weapon systems or something...

	Anyway, they go around from one hangar to the other, carrying their 
military-gray top-secret laptops... settle them on a table next to 
the plane to be updated... and boot Windows 95 !!!

	Just something you should be aware of when you read a 747 was shot 
down by a Finnish Hornet. It wasn\'t the pilot\'s fault, the software 
decided the big slow thing was trying to take over its airspace 
market share. :)

You all know there\'s a real, yes, "real", church of Elvis in the US,
don\'t you?  Its in Nashville I think and started up about 4-5 years
ago.  Its actual name is something like "First Presbyterian Presly
Memorial Church" or something like that.  I kid you not.  Before it
opened up, I predicted, and still do, that one day there will be an
Elvis Presley University.  It will begin humbly as a music school, then
gradually expand into a full-bachelor-degree-granting-university, albeit
small.  Its motto will be TCB "Takin\' Care of Business" and the symbol
will be a bolt of lightning with TCB on top.  The mascots will of course
be the Flying Elvi.  Precilla could buy a small college today and change
the name.

I want to read the future history of how the Solomani royal blood line
traces its roots to the Elvis.  Particularly messy were the infighting
between those descended from Lisa Marie versus those believeing that the
descendants of Michael Jackson and Lisa\'s first husband had the higher
claim because of the Salic Law principle that doesn\'t let women transmit
the heriditary claim.  (See Henry V).  I will omit any discussion about
links between Lisa Marie\'s  (and her First Husband\'s) membership in the
Church of Scientology and links to Feudal Technocracy ;-)  Suffice to
say that the Church of Elvis and the Church of Scientology didn\'t get
along very well.  Can you say "Jihad?"

There\'s a great short story, very short, by Greg Bear I think (in the
anthology Bears Make Fire or something like that) about the invention of
a ship that reaches light speed.  (Forgive the poor memory of physics if
I state this wrong).  So, as the ship reaches light speed, its mass
approaches infinity and the whole of the universe collapses on the ship,
creating a Big Bang.  "Again" it says.  :-)

   I have to agree with this, basically.  However, I do have some
particular desires, but they may be peculiar to me and my players.

One basic traveller book is not enough.  I don\'t need/want multiple
copies of the info, but I need it broken up so that one person can
create a character while another equips his character and I review
encounter or combat rules.  What I would like to see is a group of books
(kind of like the old book/releases) that are regular 8.5" x 11" but on
the thin side, preferably with holes for three-ring binders, covering
separate areas:  character generation; star system/world generation;
starship design/combat; combat rules/equipment; regular equipment;
history/background/library data.

As it is, my 3 week old hardcover\'s spine is almost completely undone
and the supplements with the so-called "perfect-binding" are losing
pages.  Shortly, I am going to separate all pages from spines, run \'em
through the three-hole-punch and put them in separate small binders
(with errata included at appropriate places ;-)

"Cardboard Heroes" is also an excellent idea.  In fact, my players make
them already.

And why should I have to pay extra for a referee screen?  $12 US is too

On the face of it, no - after all, you don\'t start working for your employer 
until you finish school/uni/etc. OTOH, graduates start work on a higher salary 
than those without a degree, so they *should* leave with more money. And in the 
case of the academies, it could be said that you\'re working for them while you\'re 
there.

The concept is called "hadrogravitics" and utilizes compact, spherically 
(maybe cylindrically) symmetric gravitic fields to collapse a fusile 
bubble nearly to the point of fusion. Fusion is possible using gravitic 
compression alone, (almost like a nuclear powered diesel engine).  But 
the problem is ensuring that the fusion density profile is uniform 
throughout the containment field, otherwise fuel wastage and
innefficient 
parallel reactions occur.  These can be suppressed via design, alternate 
field geometries, and the use of nuclear damper nodes.  Damper nodes act
much like moderators and poisons in modern fission reactors to either 
enhance or retard the basic reaction.

Higher TLs allow for the production of even higher strength fields as
well as more effective nuclear damper initiation and damping.

How can the resulting fuson energy be harnessed?  Well, depending on
the TL:
							Maximum
							Thermal	
TL 	Cycle/Conversion System				Efficiency

6-8	Rankine and Brayton cycle heat engines. 	 40-55%

9-12    MHD and photoelectric arrays as "topping" 	 70%

	methods.  

13-15	At higher Imperial TLs (13+) possibly via 	 75%+
	direct conversion from energetic reacting 
	mass on a quantum vacuum (Heisenberg) level. 

Advanced designs allow the use of more energetic "advanced" fuel
cycles. Projected maxima for combined Rankine-MHD systems

	-Hadronics-

Hadrons are the class of particles that participate in the strong
nuclear interaction.  They include both the mesons and baryons.  
Baryons are fermions that participate in the strong nuclear 
interaction, and fermions are elementary particles with an antisymmetric 
wave function and spin of one half.  Hadronics is the engineering 
discipline related to the study of these particles, their interactions,
and the practical applications of the same.  It is a subdiscipline of 
the Engineering and Physical science of Quantum Partonics.

Hadronic weapons utilize advancements in nuclear field manipulation 
and gravitic technologies to produce destructive effects.  Although
not weapons, the category of Hadronic devices also includes Nuclear
Resonance Dampers and Drivers along with their derivative devices. 
Under this criterion, some advanced TL 13+ fusion reactors can also be 
considered Hadronic devices.

The synergy of hadronic and gravitic technologies allows the creation 
of new classes of nuclear fusion reactors and weapons.  By 
generating enormous but localized spherically, symmetrical gravitational 
fields, these devices demonstrate the ability to compress advanced
fuels into stellar fusion parameters.  Additional manipulation of 
electron quantum states and nuclear field resonances transforms 
hadronic systems into nuclear fusion ignition devices.   Constructed
properly, the concept yields either a reactor or a detonation weapon
of unparalleled destructive potential given the simplicity and
resultant low cost.  Additionally, GH reactors can be configured to 
initiate catastrophic nuclear detonation, and require extensive 
safeguards to prevent this from occurring unintentionally.

Ah, yes, #1594, the "All Craig" issue of the TML Digest; that last "Racial
stereotyping" post was by me, also. :)

I wish I knew what to do about this.  Posting such huge quantities of data
via email offends my sensibilities as well; I consider my web-based
version of THUDDD (http://www.cinenet.net/users/cberry/thuddd.html) the
primary THUDDD resource, and in fact generated the email version by
"printing" the web page from Lynx and doing a tiny amount of editing on
the results.  My preference would be to place the ship designs on the web
only, and use email to the TML only for announcements, ballots, and
results.

I proposed exactly this when I took over the THUDDD last May; however,
several people on the TML apparently lack web access, and strongly
requested that the data appear on the TML.  For their benefit, I have
continued to post it.

Would it perhaps be better to go to web presentation of the data,
supplemented by direct email to anyone needing it, on request?  Would
anyone object to that?  I fear this might reduce the already smallish
response to the competitions -- is this fear justified?  Comments and
suggestions are more than welcome.

   Interesting Topic.  I think you\'d have 2 types of bounty hunters -
Imperially licensed and non-licensed because you\'d have two types of
fugitives: fugitives from Imperial law and fugitives from member world
law.

Imperial warrants would issue (or an Imperial bounty would be available
for) fugitives from imperial law.  These are probably laws that either
interfere directly with the Arms of the Imperium (its agencies, etc.) or
that interfere with the Laws of Imperial Space (piracy, etc.).  I think
only an Imperially-licensed bounty hunter should be able to collect
rewards on these fugitives.  This license should give some protection
from or immunity to member world laws that might interfere with capture
of the fugitive, at least to whatever extent is "reasonably necessary to
effectuate capture."  [Can you tell I\'m a law student?] :-P

Member-world bounties would normally have no standing on other member
worlds.  Thus, fugitives from one world may find refuge on another.
Same for bounty hunters; authority on one world doesn\'t translate to
another.  However, harboring fugitives might be bad for business for
most worlds, depending on the number and type of fugitives.  Some might
turn a blind-eye to both the fugitive and the bounty hunter, as long as
business isn\'t interfered with.  Some might actively work against the
bouty hunter.  In general, I think the higher the law level, the more
likely a member-world is to co-operate with the bouty hunter, although
the  weapons and methods allowed may be heavily restricted.  (A
very-high law world may not allow the bounty hunter to do anything but
wait for the domestic authorities to capture the fugitive).

Its conceiveable that the Imperium itself might \'harbor\' fugitives from
the laws of a member-world, and a bounty hunter might be working against
the interests of the Imperium in trying to bring the fugitive to the
member-world\'s idea of justice.

I think a good thing to create for such a campaign, and all perhaps, is
a list of High Crimes that are forbidden on all member-worlds and in
Imperium Space.  Such things might include Genocide, Imperial Treason,
Mass Destruction (of a population center, say).

  TC,

I guess my problem with rolling-up a Noble PC stems from the fact that I
see that more as a JOB than an adventure. As I said there are several
types of nobles that I can see in a traveller game, mostly "powerless"
ones, but a set of rules to roll them up should be available, but
limited. One a PC becomes a Landed noble the action moves to level that
takes it from a normal game group into something else.
I reffed games where a player managed to do some serious work (CT) with
the Merchant Prince rules and establish his characters in what amounted
to a Minor-Mega-Corp (!?). The character was used often after that as a
hook into other a adventures, and as an off stage patron, meanwhile the
player continued to uses the Merchant Prince info and a LOT of hand
waving by me, to play the character as the CEO of his corporation. We
had fun but I am sure that stock transactions would have bored the other
players to death.
On the other side I once played a character that became, through some
judicious use of fire power, the head of what amounted to a mafia
family. It bored me after a while because I wound up giving the other
players instructions, then they had the fun of carrying them out. My
character, admittedly, more by my view of his place n the scheme of
things, stayed back most of the time. Eventually I rolled up a thug and
let the GM have the character as an NPC.
I totally agree with you that some type of PE supplement can be a LOT of
fun, maybe when Nobles generation rules are created it could be a
supplement including high level rules for noble gaming (similar to
Trillion Credit Squadron or Merchant Prince\'s trade rules), (HINT! HINT!
HINT! subtle ain\'t I?). Of course, I\'m also sure that the talent
involved in this game probably has any number of ways of fitting a Noble
in an on-going campaign, and it\'s just my personal prejudice showing. I
just felt the need to voice my opinion, (something I do more often than
I should, but not enough to satisfy me ;^) !)

Sci-fi games are games first, fiction second, and science is priority
number 1734 or so. Often the game or campaign effects of a technology are
decided first and the science is concocted afterward to explain the effects.

GURPS has rules for a variety of different campaigns and science fiction
technologies. The "house" starship design system includes a large number of
modular components which can be assembled together. The advantage of this
method is that it is very easy to build a starship with only simple
calculations because each component has little effect on the performance of
other components. Also, GURPS Space adventures are usually
character-oriented in the sense that the technology and mechanics of the
campaign play a supporting and not central role. Since the power plant is
self-contained and does not require refueling, players can treat it as part
of the background and do not concern themselves with the minutae of its
behavior and operation.

Traveller, in comparison, is much more technically-oriented, with detailed
rules for the individual components of a starship which all have
interrelated mass/volume/power/surface area requirements. The advantage of
this method is that referees can customize the performance of ships for
specific purposes or constraints. Traveller adventures often involve an
amount of background detail, where players need to deal with things like
the maintenance and economics of their ships.

As an aside, I don\'t agree that starships in Traveller "require huge tanks
of LHyd to power a reactor for a relatively short period of time." While
jump drives require enormous amounts of fuel, power plants require only a
few cubic meters per year.

Scientific accuracy is a very dodgy thing in science fiction. First of all,
the principles in the story may be unknown to current science and therefore
not amenable to accuracy checks. Second, the principles are often described
vaguely enough so a variety of different scientific principles may be
invoked. For example, the GURPS reactor may use some form of mass
conversion technology, so a few kilograms of fuel could last years. On the
other hand, power plant inefficiency could increase fuel requirement by
orders of magnitude.

A physics text could probably give you this information, however FF&S has a
general description of the relevant reactions in chapter 8. Remember that
the the equation for the nuclear reaction is only a small part of a fusion
power generation system. You also have to consider the proportion of
deuterium in the fuel, conversion to electrical power, the intensity or
variability ot the output, and the combined efficiencies of all the
component stages.

There is a good article in an early White dwarf (in the range 70 to 80) on
Bounty Hunting. (Not too hand unfortunately). It detailed bounty hunting as
a profession, and described that the process was enabled under a limited
form of Imperial Warrant.  Bounty Hunters also had their own ship (a type H
Hunter) which was a modified Type S with some interesting \'additions\'.

One does have to admit that TNE/FFS2 fuel requirements are certainly much
more physically reasonable; the old-fashioned requirements for really, really
huge amounts of fuel were moderately ludicrous (ever try to calculate the
energy yield of fusing a tonne of hydrogen?)

And even in CT there was a pretty big discrepency between jump drive fuel
requirements and power plant; if one assumes jump drive built-in plants
and the main plant have the same fuel efficiencies (mass of fuel per unit
power), the jump plant is generating power 144 times as rapidly as a 
convential power plant. The discrepancy goes down if you assume jump plants
burn their fuel  even more inefficiently than normal plants, but one is 
then left wondering why you can\'t ever design a starship that uses a 
conventional power plant (or batteries!) to power its jump. And then there
are references in HG to the main power plant charging the capacitors for
jump...Jump-fuel-for-power is in the disputed, contradictory area of 
Canon. 

(And *please* don\'t mention the Annic Nova.)

I agree with Anders - it\'s a neat result, but it doesn\'t demonstrate
FTL *communication*. It\'s not like they sent (for example) on-off binary
pulses at the speed of light; instead, they sent a part of a complex
signal (the symphony) that when recombined with the other part transmitted
normally, interefered to reproduce the symphony when the relative delays
were adjusted as is the FTL leg actually had travelled faster than light.
This is ambiguous for a whole bunch of reasons - not least because the
symphony is lacking in information at frequencies comparable to the 
travel times. It\'s certainly not clear that you could use this to send
information, but only to send a signal that only makes sense when you
recombine it with a signal that travels slower than light.

Most apparent FTL paradoxes are like this - like phase speeds, or 
Anders\' lighthouse, or the EPR paradox; there are relatively straightforward
proofs that you can never use the EPR "action at a distance" to transmit
information - you can only notice the correlations when you compare the
results from both ends after the fact.

The Droyne more than dabbled in psionics long before the Zhodani. 
Sources are rampant in the canon -- start with the Droyne Alien Module. 
Probably the most important contribution of the Droyne to the Traveller
background is the dissemination of humans around known space.

No -- but there will be niche for bounty hunters to execute warrants
issued by other member worlds, to collect classic bounties ("Wanted Dead
or Alive:  Cr25,000 Reward") issued by member worlds, and to hunt down
people sought by persons or entities who lack authority to issue
warrants, but can afford to pay for a kidnapping.  

The Imperium doesn\'t have very many laws and won\'t have very many arrest
warrants.  Those few will be executed by Imperial officers, who are
authorized to seize fugitives on member states, pursuant to the member
state\'s treaty with the Imperium.  Fugitives who travel outside the
Imperium can be pursued by Imperial forces, but the Imperium might find
it cost effective sometimes to hire local bounty hunters.

> What sort of treaties and

The member states of the Imperium have treaties with each other
regarding extradition.  The member states have treaties with the
Imperium that allow the Imperium to pursue fugitives from Imperial law
on the member state, and the Imperium probably pledges not to interfere
with the legitimate extradition of fugitives back to the member state,
as long as the peace of the realm is not seriously threatened.  

The Imperium doesn\'t allow member states to have their own "foreign
relations", i.e., relations with non-Imperial powers, so the Imperium
itself has treaties with non-Imperial worlds and empires regarding
extradition.

The MoJ bureaucracy is not so bloated as to be licensing bounty
hunters.  The MoJ might do the actual drafting of Imperial warrants, but
they would be issued by an Imperial Court (part of the judicial branch,
not the executive).  MoJ agents would already be empowered to pursue
fugitives into member states.  The member state would have to grant that
authority to the Imperium as a cost of membership.

The MoJ will certainly have a counter-intelligence/security/anti-crime
department that will be in charge of collecting and disseminating
information.

Member worlds would use bounty hunters to project influence but these
guys (and gals) would have very little legal protection on a different
world that the one that issued the bounty.  Perhaps if he hasn\'t
actually broken the law of that world (excluding any that would affect
the hunted, such as battery and assult - most of the hunted wouldn\'t

Beating the hunted is OK (sort of) but bombing a cafe to stun him is
not.  Any action that causes colateral effect is illegal.

The above only applies to Member world sponsored Bounties.  Anyone else
can put out a bounty but this bounty has no more legal standing than
individual worlds allow.
Some member worlds may not allow any captured individual to leave while
others give approved bounty hunter similar powers to the police.

I thought that one was so low it sucked in a tree or some such and the
computer compensated by reduceing power in the other engine and
basically just sunk into the ground because there was insufficent power
to fly and the pilot trying to pull up would have stalled.

In fact I though that crash was a prime example of how fly by wire is

I read in The Standard Ship Design System (beta) that 1.0m^3 of fuel has

	I dont think that Traveller PP need deuterium, but I think
	that they burn LHy using the C-N-O katalysator chain.

	Evidence : 

	- Your fuel is LHy (as canon ;-)
	- If its impure your PP can explode (to much C or N)

	My interpretation of Jump-Space and Jump-Fuel ist :

	- If a ship is far away enough from gravity, the jump drive
	  creates an event horizon around the ship.
	- This event horizon is then visible like a black hole tunneling
	  in Jump-Space for about a week, until it hits the next gravity.
	- From the outside this jump bubble is now only single point size,
	  from the inside its filled with the ship and surrounded by a bubble
	  of photons creating a "temporary pocket univers".
	  You need these photon to extend space inside the jump bubble,
	  that the ship will not collapse under its own gravity. The deeper
	  I wanna push the bubble into jump space, the more energy I need
	  to hinder the bubble to become a real black hole.
	- When this jump bubble hits gravity the photons tunnel though
	  the event horizon and the jump bubble collapses. This is visible
	  with human eyes even on bright day\'s, and looks like a far star
	  is burning nova for some minutes.
	  This dos no harm to the ship, as from the inside the first
	  photons are one light week away when tunneling out. And any
	  energy is directed away from the center.

   People strongly disagreed with your position, but no one here was
trying to "hush you up".  They *did* become very impatient, and I can\'t
say that I blame them.  You made certain assertions and then didn\'t back
them up, at least not until significantly later.

   Should we lavish gifts on them for spelling \'Imperium\' correctly? 
Really, the evidence does not back up this statement.

   It has come to the point, with me at least, where I am beginning
think in terms of *two* seperate games when I talk about the primary
subject of this mailing list.  One game is \'Traveller\', a game produced
by GDW which has a common storyline and three different sets of game
mechanics (CT/MT/TNE) that take its common universe up to the Imperial
year 1202.  The other is \'Marc Miller\'s Traveller\', a game produced by
IG that uses many common story and mechanical elements from \'Traveller\',
but is sufficently different so as to constitute a *seperate* game. 
Just as \'Traveller: 2300\' was not \'Traveller\', neither is \'Marc Miller\'s
Traveller\'.  While we have become accustom to calling \'Marc Miller\'s
Traveller\' "T4", that designation is a rather unfortunate one, because
it increases the expectations older players have to levels that IG seems
unable to comply with.

   The alternative to thinking of \'Marc Miller\'s Traveller\' as a
seperate game is continued frustration as it becomes increasingly
difficult (nay impossible) to reconcile everything under the \'Traveller\'
name.

   Reinventing the wheel may work if you are Dilbert\'s boss, but it only
causes anxiety, frustration and even anger for the rest of us.  Over 90
percent of the storyline bugs had been worked out in Traveller when GDW
closed its doors for the last time (the Regency Sourcebook and other
later publications were of valuable assistance in that regard).  Now,
new ones have developed as a result of T4.

   You make an excellent case here for treating \'Marc Miller\'s
Traveller\' as a unique game with its own seperate storyline, apart from
the rest of Traveller.  Doing so makes the whole canon debate about the
RoM\'s tech level moot.  Writers will no longer be tied down by what
Supplement 9 says, or what "Solomani and Aslan" says.  They would be
free to do whatever they want in explaining how their Third Imperium
came into being.  

   Certainly you and others who believe in Relativism with regard to the
canon storyline would be able to comment here in peace.  That\'s a major
bonus right there.  :-)

Harold

I am unaware of this aspect of the research.  In fact, I do not remember
the article that I read mentioning this particular reliance on 
interference effects (I read it over a year ago and wasn\'t able to keep
a copy).  I do remember that the most important aspect of the research
was that photons tunneling through mass barriers negotiated the entire
length of the barriers instantaneously. 

The FTL aspect is relative to the length of the material tunneled
through,
much like jump dirve "speed" depends on the length of jump.  Do you have
a more recent description of the experiment?  If it did depend on
phase interference effects then you and Anders are quite correct,
and I must apologize, as it may indeed have no more value than a 
curiosity of mathematics.

The article I read, however, seemed to indicate that the effects were
more than merely a "phase velocity"-like curiosity.  In fact, the
ability to transmit a signal at seemingly faster than the speed of light
even if through a solid only) has profound implications for FTL
comms and casuality. It may imply a major new area of understanding in 
physics as a whole.

Also, considerable controversy still surrounds the EPR argument, and
while under the Copenhagen interpretation it seems to be a paradox,
all such theoretical systems are founded on mutable underlying 
assumptions.  If the assumptions are proven to be wrong, things
thought previously to be possible may become quite possible.
In fact, it has recently been advanced as the theoretical basis of 
"transporter" arrangement of sorts.  Modern quantum mechanics
is revealing greater inconsistency in our traditional mode
of viewing the nature and limitations of reality.  The very
concept of quantum computing is one of the areas which may lead
us into an unchartable future.  It is certainly strange, but 
is nonetheless seriously debated.

As best as I recall, there is a fair amount of work out there that seems to
indicate that this will not break SR, as no outside information can be
encoded.  This is still an amazing large scale demonstration of an effect
thought to be going on at small scales.  Further, it is an effect that
theoretically has been predicted for a while (1939, I believe), but that,
in the paraphrased words of Alain Aspect, one of the first to investigate
it, would likely not be done on a macroscopic scale in his lifetime.

It will be interesting to see the long term implications of a superluminal
effect, even if it is an effect that cannot transfer information.

I took a class by that title in college and it was one of the most
interesting I have ever had.  I try to use the "pocket empires" of our little
planet to build a cultural ideal for a planet.  I generally think of my
traveller planets as being fairly homogenous (except for origin planets)
being made up of decendants of colonists.  The larger the population the
harder it becomes to maintain that homogenaity(sp?) and they begin to
balkanize generally.  Lots can happen in the thousands of years of colonizing
and just about anything you can think of is probably possible for a cultural
basis.  Just my 2 credits worth.

1) CT Book 8, Robots, is compatable with MT.

2) there were 2 alien modules for MT specifically, and the CT ones need
little change. The 2 for MT are _Vilani & Vargr_, and _Solomani & Aslan_.

3) Alien Module 8 for CT is subtitled _Darrians_

4 Library of MT vehicle designs: two of them. One is _101 vehicles_ by DGP,
the other is the Dean Files, found on the WWW. Statships of the military
bent are in Fighting Ships of the Shattered Imperium. Since MT\'s strarship
combat is the same as High Guard, you can also use CT Supplement 9:
Fighting Ships. You might wanna grab Supplement 7: Traders and Gunboats;
most of the MT stats are in Imp Encyclopaedia.

I quite agree.  I just felt (and I don\'t think you were disagreeing with
this) that the \'something else\' could be Traveller too.  (And wouldn\'t we
like rules for it!)

Now this does sound fun.  (See my suggestion for a supplement along the
lines of _MegaCorporations_.)  Did the \'serious work\' include anything
postable to TML?  I\'m sure we\'d love to see it.

I wonder if there\'s a game of Traveller going/gone on that doesn\'t involve
a lot hand waving at times to cover points not covered by rules etc.  Seems
a valid response to the fact that the rule books *can\'t* cover
*everything*.  (And would we want them to try?)  It can be as much fun for
players and refs \'winging it\' as having systems to cover the eventualities
the adventure involves.  Perhaps more stressful for the referee though!

Hmm, and how energy does this require ? I suspect somewhat more

Chlorine, while unpleasant is not a problem. Swimming pools have low amou=

of chlorine in them and they are relatively safe. Ok, we\'re dealing with
higher amounts here, but then our average starship crew ain\'t going swimm=

D2O can also be obtained from water by fractional distillation ( it boils=

at 101 degrees Celsius, as opposed to H2O\'s 100 degrees. ) I expect that
T2O has a higher boiling point, but I am not sure.

Does anyone have any figures / maths to work out how much energy is requi=
red
to cool Hydrogen from a given temperature to LHyd using the Joule-Thomson=

effect ? I know the rapid expansion of the Hydrogen gas lowers the
temperature, but this has to be done several times, to do the job

cycled gas. How much ?

Timothy.Collinson@solent.ac.uk kindly noted:

>He also encourages BITS members to attend (and run Traveller games if

Yes, and I\'d like to thank the BITS members who are making this possible;
without their help there\'s no way I\'d ever get to more than a couple of
conventions throughout the year. I think we will have managed about 8
conventions (some very small) over the past year and a bit.

>Surely this could become a formalized arrangement if IG were serious about

This would be a very good idea. Then again, I tried to get IG to bring me
and Jo Grant over for GEN CON, but they couldn\'t reconcile the costs with
the benefits. Words such as "bother" and "oh dear" were exchanged at this
end. Maybe they\'ll fund us to go to Essen, which, as pointed out by Volker, is:

>Essen would be a good optin to consider in Germany (Biggest Games

If there are any UK people out there who are interested (or anyone else who
can attend EURO GEN CON, then here\'s some waffle:

**** BEGIN BLATANT PUBLICITY ****

BITS WILL BE THERE! Yes, we\'ll be running the same sort of stand as last
year, with loads of tables for us to run demos on, there\'ll be THREE
tournaments, and there should be space for you guys (BITS members) to run
your own Traveller games.

So, I\'ll be needing an extra load of help this year, because my trusty
helpers from last year (Jo and Lesley Grant) can\'t make it. I need help
running demos, promoting Traveller, selling stuff, running tournaments,
standing at our stand and simply talking about Traveller, etc., etc. THAT
MEANS YOU! I\'d really appreciate any time that any of you could take to
help. (i.e. if you don\'t help, there won\'t be any tournaments, demos, etc.).
I\'ll also be offering some small incentives (freebies, reduced prices, etc.)
to those who help for a substantial period of time.

If you\'d like to brighten up your role-playing life, then come to EGC! Meet
interesting people like  myself (?!), play Traveller (and lots of other
RPGs) with a new bunch, or even with your usual gaming buddies. The trade
stands and second-hand stalls are probably *THE* place to acquire those
Traveller books that you\'ve always wanted, plus there will be several NEW
101 books published by BITS! As I said, you can bring your entire RPG group
if you like and use one of our tables to play Traveller throughout the event
- - anything at all that promotes Traveller. We should also have a demo of our
proposed Traveller Collectable Card Game for those of you who would like to
try it out.

        WHY SHOULD I GO?

You mean apart from it being *the* (UK) RPG event of the year? Apart from
sharing a campus with 3,000+ other gamers? (Ok, so that\'s not such a
persuasive argument) ;-)

        TOURNAMENTS

Traveller has three tournament slots. Thursday afternoon and Saturday
afternoon will be RPGA-approved tournaments (if you\'re not an RPGA member
don\'t worry, you still get the same prizes if you win!). Prizes? Yes, of
course there are prizes! Sunday morning we\'re hoping to run a fun
tournament, based loosely on a certain Red Dwarf TV series...

        NEW BITS PRODUCTS

Three more BITS 101 books should be available (101 Travellers, 101 Species
and 101 Rendezvous), along with the Traveller Bibliography, the Senate
Election Game and (if I have time) an alpha version of our Traveller
Collectable Card Game.

I think all of us at CORE who have had a hand in many of the IG products to
date would admit that it\'s been difficult knowing quite how to place all the
\'generic\' products with regard to their Milieu. This has been particularly
troublesome for the Aliens book which we\'ve just completed. The manner in
which I handled this for the Vargr was to write from two view points in the
historical sections - one from the 100s or 200s, and another from about
1100. Without compromising the possibilities for later adventures (the
Milieu 200 supplement, etc.) the 1100 viewpoint did include information that
was available at that time, which was not apparent in the earlier years (for
example, knowledge of the links between the Vargr and the Ancients).

I guess we\'ll just have to wait and see what the readership (including the
TML) think of our efforts...

Andy :-)

P.S. The Vargr choice of colour schemes et al. may be tasteless or not,
depending upon your interpretation of what I\'ve written... (Gods forbid we
should contradict canon) :-)

>The target world is balkanized world, you wish to take over control.
>1.If you attack it using Military Meta task do you attack each government
>separately?

Only if you divide the appropriate factors for the task between the
governments, i.e. subdividing the planet\'s military forces to each. I would
imagine that you\'d need some form of successful propaganda exercise
beforehand to ensure that the other governments didn\'t interfere as you took
out their compatriots in turn. For simplicity, I\'d attack the entire planet
as a whole. When under military attack, planetary unity can suddenly arise,
thus you\'ll be fighting them all anyway. You might give yourself a slight
bonus to the task roll given that the various military forces might not be
so well coordinated.

>2.To subdue the planet do you have to have troops subduing each government?

As above, probably most simple to count the whole world as one unit. If you
don\'t, then having defeated one of several governments, you also have to
decide which resources, population, etc. are available for that particular
government to decide what GWP benefit you gain from having annexed it, etc.
Plus any governments you failed to take over would no doubt be mounting
covert or open resistance to get you off the world again (knowing that if
they don\'t, you\'ll turn on them sooner or later).

>3.It states that if you take over a world you get half of its resources

From memory I thought the intention was you got half the resources
immediately, and the full resources became available after 2 years.

See thoughts for military take over above.

>5.If a world is taken using the Tech offensive Meta Task what is the Target

It should stay as before. Initially, one might think that - for example - a
religious dictatorship which oppresses its people and keeps technology for
themselves would be unstable after such a Tech offensive. However, it might
be that your offensive actually involved propping up such a government with
high tech goods, rather than being a humanitarian distribution of the high
tech to the greater populace.

>6.Under the Technology Offensive page 73 under Special Conditions:

I believe (perhaps David Burden can correct me) that the effect is only ever
a single target world. The reason the TPE is referred to is that if a TPE
has practically as good a tech as you, then even if the TW TL is lower, the
TPE could support the TW against your tech imports (they\'d be forced to
supply the goods from within the TPE rather than letting your goods in).

All above answers subject to being passed through a double Jump field (i.e.
it\'s anybody\'s guess whether they make sense or not).

I haven\'t either. But I *do* have 2.54 cm = 1 inch memorized.

5280 * 12 * 2.54 = 160934.4 cm = 1.609344 km

I also have pi memorized as 3.1415926. But my calculator has a pi key...

I\'ve already shown how you might be able to get a decent rate of
seperation of hydrogen from gas gaint atmosphere (via diffusion thru
specialized materials). 

The *real* problem is getting the stuff liquefied quickly.

On the other hand, I don\'t really see that there\'d be much *reason* to
to deal with "local" units to that degree of accuracy. Timeclocks don\'t
resolve down to the second either.

And after the experiments that pretty much killed the "hidden

An addition to my own post. The 1.60934 figure is using the same number
of significant figures as your value for pi. The *exact* number is
1.609344. When dealing with metric <-> English length conversions, just
remember that the inch is *defined* as being 2.54 cm.

Also, the gallon is 231 cubic inches and the ounce (weight) is 28.35 grams.

Damn! I\'d forgotten that. Is it possible to design a channel such that
you *do* get a higher pressure region with a constant flow? If not,
then I guess we change it to a straight pipe.

This kind of experiment is old hat. They\'ve been doing them over
shorter distances for years. The trick is that the phenomenon is
*totally* useless for transmitting information. You can\'t "modulate"
them usefully due to the very nature of the effect.

There are several other FTL effects, all equally useless for
transmitting information (for example "phase velocity" can be very FTL,
but can\'t be used to send info). 

Relativity doesn\'t forbid FTL, it forbids sending material or
information FTL. The FTL phenomena known all involve no transfer of
info.

It\'s actually quite *easy* to figure the amount of fuel needed... 

First you decide how efficient the reactor is. Then you decide which
fusion reaction you are using. Add up the atomic weights of the input
and subtract the atomic weights of the output (for example 4H->He means
that you\'d add up the atomic weight of 4 hydrogen atoms, and subtract
the atomic weight of one helium atom). (you need to use the atomic
weights that are carried out to 4 or more places)

Next you divide the difference by the starting weight (ie the 4H in my
example). This tells you what percentage of the mass you feed into the
reactor is turned into energy. 

Let\'s say the figure is .1% (roughly correct). At 85% efficiency that\'d
mean that you get .085% of the mass converted to energy.

Now you need to ask how much power the reactor is supposed to put out.
Let\'s say 1 megawatt. That\'s one million joules per second. E=mc^2
tells us:

1e6=m*(3e8)^2
1e6=m*(9e16)
1e6/9e16=m
11.11e-12=m

divide by .085% (.00085) gives 13e-9. That\'s in kilograms. 13e-6 grams.

So you need about 13 micrograms of fuel per second for a one MW reactor
at 85% efficiency using a reaction that converts .1% of the mass to
energy. 

So in 200 years it\'d use 82 kilograms of fuel.

Civilized systems will have GPS on the mainworld and on other "well
developed" worlds. Heck, GPS should be easy enough to install in orbit
(given the tech level required for jump drive) that it may even be
installed as a matter of course shortly after contact is set up with
new worlds, even low tech ones.

In civilized systems you\'ll also have some sort of grid of beacons
distributed around the system to act as a nav grid for it. So after
jumping in, your nav system checks for the signals from the nearest SPS
(System Positioning System) beacons and tells you where you are.

They don\'t need defending as they are too useful to the *enemy*.
Besides, for the interstellar references, it does no good as the
signals won\'t stop showing up in other systems until *years* after you
destroy them.

Easy. The velocity causes the apparent pulse rate to shift. But it also
causes the *frequency* to shift by the same amount. So you just compare
the frequency to a local frequency standard and that gives you the
pulse rate difference.

I think this would depend a lot on whether the weapon was designed at 
TL3, as well as manufactured, or whether it was designed at TL7+, for 
low TL manufacture, because early primer, aside from being rather 
corrosive tended to blow a fair bit.

IIRC the firearm\'s calibre is quite important, and fouling becomes a 
much greater problem at .30 and smaller.

True, but it\'d be tricky making an automatic weapon for paper 
cartridges, especially at TL3-4.

Some other problems I see with a black-powder assualt rilfe (mind you 
I think it\'s a cool idea): fouling would be serious if a gas system 
was used, and a bullpup blowback would be very dangerous, especially 
with black powder. This pretty much leaves us with a recoil system, 
and they\'re heavy (makes for low recoil, though). BTW guncotton is 
really easy to make, and can be turned into a smokeless propellant, 
so if anyone has had access to any TL4+ chemistry texts there\'s no 
need to use black powder.

I was reading the latest issue of Soldier of Fortune (did you know there\'s

BLAM stands for "Barrel-Launched Adaptive Munition," and the description
is much like that I gave before (a two-part projectile with piezoelectic
"tendons" that flex to control aerodynamic attitude).  Velocity is given
as up to 6,000 feet per second (about 2,000 m/s).  It\'s intended for use
against satellites, ground targets, and theater balistic missiles, as well
as air to air combat.  Versions on fighters would use a lower velocity for
air-to-air (3-4,000 fps), while the higher velocity would be mounted on a
large fighter (F-15) or bomber (B-1) for shooting down satellites.

  Cost per round would be firly low, estimated as as little as $400 per
round.  Air to ground versions would incorporate GPS for guidence
 - idea is to fire them from AC-130 gunships, with a range of up to 50
miles.  This version would cost more - $8-10,000 each.  That\'s still
fairly cheap compared to missiles.
 
  The U.S. Air Force has already done preliminary tests, which demonstrate
the guidance system can survive the stress of launch - no estimate on how
long a time needed before it will be tested full-up.

Also the first Maxim guns and Lee-Metfords used 0.303 black powder rounds.
As did the early Mannlicher and Mausers. Most nations did not go over to
smokeless powders until the 1890\'s.

Paper cases have some very real problems. Most obvious is what happens when
they get wet. Less obvious is that to withstand the stress of an automatic
action you would have to use a fairly heavy cardboard tube. This involves
the use of a binding agent (glue). Such a case would not completely combust.
At the very least it will leave considerable residue, less obviously it
will also leave smoldering embers in the breach which could ignite the next
round before the action is closed (during the Napoleonic period the RN used
flannel charge bags in preferance to paper for exactly this reason). A
primer blowout is nothing compared with ignition with the action open. Also
there is a very real jamming problem with paper cartridges. The historical
paper rounds were designed to be used with manual action single shot weapons.
The fastest manual action (the SMLE rifle IIRC) can achieve perhaps 2 rounds
a second and is not very abrupt. An automatic action is going to be firing
around 5 to 7 rounds a second and is very abrupt (especially blowback). If
your cartridge warps on feeding, you have a jam (or a discharge from an
incompletely closed bolt).

systems in Mega-Traveller and T4, so I have little recourse but to ask
assistance from this group.

	My problems are as follows:

	1. In T4 I cannot find the Jump Drive Potential table, am I supposed to
use an other table like it was the J potential table, or do I need to look
somewhere else. If I have to look somewhere else, is it on the internet or
in the rules book or both?

	2. In Megatraveller, when designing a starship using the referee\'s manual,
the CP section has me a little confused.  When you calculate the CP for a
given section (Hull, Loco, electronics, etc.) The formula given is:
CP=(Pr/100000)xTL  Now the way I see it the price/100K is to convert your
total price for the section into Kcr is that right?  Or does it conver the
price into Mcr?  I had assumed that the prices throughout the design
process as being in Cr, and so I had converted the prices to Mcr
automaticly.  Now that I am at this point I don\'t know if I had done the
pricing correctly or not.

	3. In Megatraveller, when you purchase a computer, what is the CP
Multiplier for, and how do I determine the number of inputs that I need? 
Ex. A scout/curiour panel=holodynamic linked x 181.  Where does the  x 181
come from?

I make it Delta H = +325 kJ/mol, compared to +286 kJ/mol at sensible 
temperatures for electrolysis.

However, it requires much less *work* than electrolysis, because it\'s 
spontaneous i.e. no external work is required.  You can recover a 
proportion of the difference in energies by exchanging heat between 
the high-temperature H2/O2/H2O) mixture and the water about to be 
cracked.  Plus you don\'t have the inefficiencies of generating the 
electricity.

> Incidentally, does anyone know anything about
> photolysis ? Apparently you can split water with sunlight somehow ...

Sure, but it\'s not very efficient because a lot of energy is lost as 
heat.  Also the trick is getting enough to split that you get 
measurable amounts of H2 and O2 gas... which is hard in bulk water.

Well, it might depend on the electrode system, but chlorine may not

Ugh.  That\'s a very small difference, and the vapour pressure of D2O 
at 100 C must be very high -- this would be really inefficient.  
Diffusion methods or centrifuge techniques would be favourite, 
surely?

Inversion temp. for H2 is 202K, so we get Joule heating above this 
temperature at all pressures.  Practical use would be below 50 atm 
pressure, down to about 50K.

Easiest thing to do would be to calculate total work done in 
compressing/cooling H2 and then multiply by some factor to represent 
the inefficiency.  A mixture of reversible and irreversible processes 
gives something like 12.7 kJ/mol for this -- maybe as little as
6 kJ/mol.  This latter figure is roughly 0.0075 MW-hour per m^3 of H2.
It all depends on the intake pressure/temperature of H2, which I 
guessed at 10 atm and 200K.

Hmm...Thats a little different than how I figure it out...

The mass change for a 2H1 + 3He2 --> 4He2 + 1H1 reaction is 1.960E-5 kg
per mole

7kg = 1392.1 moles

1.960E-5 kg --> 1.762E+12 Joules
  minus 20% for maintaining the reaction(I\'m guessing 20%, I know 20% is
correct for
  a deuterium + deuterium fusion reaction)

  ~~1.409E+12 J

so, whatever efficiency you want, say 85%, would give you

  ~~1.198E+12 J

7kg would give you  ~~1.668E+15 J       ( 1.198E+12 * 1392.1 moles )

divide that by the number of seconds you want the reactor to last then
by 1 million watts
per MW will give you the PP rating in MW

1.668E+15 J  /  31,536,000 s / 1,000,000 watts / 1 MW ~~ 52.88 MW Power

Yeah-its called a compressor and is the first stage of a jet engine. 
Involves as many as 1 to 16 stages of compressor blades designed to
drive pressure up.  After that you burn it, blow it across a turbine
with sucks off energy to drive a shaft which drives the compressor.

The price sould be in Mcr then divided by 100k times TL to get CP\'s

You use  the CP Multipler to reduce the number of control panels will need.
IE if your ship needs 1000 CP\'s and your are using a X type control with a
value of 10 and the CP mulitplier of 2 then the two together give you a
value of 20 so 1000/20 gives you 50 type X control panels needed.

I\'m sorry for being condescending and bullheaded but could you please
direct me to where info regarding this phenomena can be gotten. My source
for the phase speed bullshit is FAR older than 1995 (early eigthies I
think) so if some new discoveries were made that REALLY transmitted
INFORMATION at 5.7 c I will publicly state that I\'m a bullheaded moron, I
will even change my tagline to include "The bullheaded moron" if I find the
actual experiments credible.

Could someone please direct me to sources  for this truly unbelievable
scientific achievement?

Thanks Bruce, could you give me sources to this (despite the obvious flwas
such experiments are generally good read, especially the experts reactions
be it pro or con - Remember the astrophysical relativistic cannonball thing
in the eighties when matter thrown out from some stellar object seemed to
exceed c until relativistic corrections were made on angular calcs).

Also, on another note, do you still(?) have your comm range/power figures
that you calculated for the FF&S2 ? I\'d like to fiddle around a bit with
this and the new 100 000 km plus space combat ranges to see if anything
useful might come up.

Thanks to you too. It\'s good to have some backing in this area as it is soo
much easier to get c-breaking experiments in print than proof to the
contrary. The funniest part of these breaking-fundamental-laws-of-nature
stories is that the journalists/readers doesn\'t get suspicious over the
lack of interest by the scientific community. This is probably due to the
fact that most weird-science diggers are also conspiracy theorists at heart
- - if the science community is silent they take is as PROOF that the
experiments are sound.

As I said, perceptions can take on a realistic tone, until experience
sets the reference frame.  I was new to TML, and it _is not_ like any
other list I have been on.  You should know better than anyone, that I
don\'t let others set my schedule.  Just a stubborn side of me. :)

Hey, perhaps the list encourages more careful posting, but someone with
my experience at analyzing the game has a long, rich tradition of
"knowing" the Traveller Universe.  I do understand that something as
provocative as what I was saying does need an explanation of the reasoning
behind it.  Even having said all that, the emotional aspects of the list
were something I absolutely could not have forseen.

I see that whole thing as just an unpleasant non-communication experience.
I didn\'t know (or even imagine that) at the outset that whole discussion
that it would boil down to people here not seeing that I had a different
approach to looking at published events.  And, only since Mark Clark\'s
comments on this thread, did I see that anyone was taking serious any
notion that _I_ was deciding these kinds of things.  I said from the
outset that "I was interested" in the subject.  I\'ve learned a lot more
from all of it, and I think a few people have clearer notions about the
"pre-history" of Traveller M:0 onward.  So I guess it was not all a waste
of time.

This is like I pointed out in my Edsel Gouch\'s Traveller campaign example.
He stopped reading and playing the "published universe" after _Rescue on
Ruie_ in JTAS #1.  And nobody is twisting his arm to do otherwise, however,
he should realize that he made some choices with his campaign setting that
just don\'t apply to those who chose to go forward.

That attitude can be applied in a chronological sense as well.  Someone
who does not like the Rebellion can refuse any "canon" after 1117.  Same
with Virus--no "canon" after 1129 (late).  It is just a matter of each
and every referee\'s/player\'s choice.  Some even use the published timeline
as something going on somewhere else, and their hard work is the total
focus of their universe.  All perfectly fine and even excellent.

You could take your argument to extend to every single book/product for
the game, but that doesn\'t make any of the totally consistent universe any
less valuable to others.  There are some who are getting their first intro
to Traveller through T4 and they don\'t necessarily benefit from our biased
views, and ancient history. :)

If they find some classic products from dealers like myself, and pick it up
and see how it all fits together, they benefit from knowing that they have
jumped into a pool whose temperatures vary with depth, the color differs
from one part of the pool to another, and the reflections and colors of the
clouds and sky change from different angles, depending upon where one
sits/swims; and that is no different than all of the rest of us and our
collective experience since 1977--Traveller is the Mother, Traveller is the
Father. :)

>name.

I think it is an attitude choice that each and every one of us have, and
have full control over.  Take my Aslan Major/Minor race aspect.  At the
time the TD ish came out, I didn\'t like the twist on a Major race, something
that was clearly "canon" before.

Over time, I thought about it.  My characters, though in close proximity
to Kusyu, had never travelled there.  The Aslan presence in my campaign
was not in the least impacted by it.  As Aslan perspective in S&A points
out, something like, "look only to our Hierate to decide if we are major
or not."

I finally concluded that it just didn\'t matter, and I didn\'t necessarily
want this long list of explanation about what I agreed with and didn\'t
agree with on the published timeline, when it came to meeting a Traveller
player "new" to me.  And the simple truth is, it just didn\'t matter to my
campaign what the perception was.  The Aslan Hierate does speak for itself,
irrespective of the conclusions of some Imperial sophontologist\'s fixation
with Jump drive as the only way to judge things.

The Major/Minor race attitude of the Imperium was a fun plot device, and
certainly added color to help us fill in the dominant Imperial dogma.

There is also something to seeing an idea which has been realized in the
sum total setting of its own published context, versus that single idea
in the vaccuum of everything but the past to judge it.  This is the
domain of writing!

Maybe Marc should have let TNE wither on the vine for a few years without
GDW, to give everyone that same perspective a lot of us felt when TNE
finally appeared.  But I am happy he did not.

As for the "anxiety, frustration, and even anger for" some of you, I have
shown _a_ way that you can have your cake and eat it too.  I am not offended
if some did not like it, but hey, that\'s just me.

No, that\'s your case given the view of reality I\'ve presented.  I don\'t
think it is a necessarily bad view, but I concede it is mine.  I have not
had as much fun with thinking, planning, researching, studying, and figuring
out the past history of relevance to a Traveller subject since the earliest
days.  I definitely owe Marc a debt of gratitude for bringing all of this
back again.

Yeah, maybe there are problems, but someone (especially me) who wants to
have fun, will not let the "little" things get in the way.  We are born
improvisers--that is perhaps the vernacular definition of role-playing.

Come on, the game is afoot!

Something happened at Roswell, NM... The current USAF story is the BS...

1) The dummy program cited started in the mid 50\'s, not in 47.

2) The dummies illustrated weren\'t in service til 57, acording to several
USAF rocketry texts I\'ve read.

3) There are large ammounts of stuff held in classified storage in the US
National archives (50+ cubic feet) under the series title "Roswell
1946-1950"
Saw this in a locator file. Where a patron pointed it out to me. And the
citizens are NOT allowed to look at it.

Beware, Anders, the TRUTH is out there... if only the governments believed
we\'re adult enough to handle it. (God, I sound like a commercial for
X-Files.)

If there was nothing happening at roswell, then Why is there so much
stored? (I admit, 50 feet isn\'t too much, but for an incident that is
supposedly nothing, it is QUITE a lot... about half as much as Bluebook
has.

Yes the MoJ seems to be the FBI for the 3I.

As for CIA, I would have to go with the Bureau of Interstellar Affairs (BIA)
These are your Men and Women In Black. Your \'double 0\'s\' etc...

Just look at what these guys get into(From M:0 Book)
They Spy on Pocket Empires.
They \'persuade\' worlds to join 3I
Assasination Attemps of PE leaders who have become a \'threat to security\'
Non stellar worlds are monitored with sursats, to \'observe for possible 
inception\'
Encourage uprisings and coup-detat\'s on non-member worlds.

Sound familiar? (FNORD!)

These guys are worse(better?) than Naval Inteligence, who are just simply 
military in nature.

Oh, and even though they say they don\'t engage in secret psioinic reserch, 
you gonna believe that? (FNORD!)

Of course you are not cleared for any of this information. ;-)

You must be careful though--I\'ve done this electrolysis with salt water
before (I\'m sure we all have in high school physical science) and what
you don\'t see in the 1 hr lab is that this chlorine REALLY does a
corrosion number on the electrode (copper in this case).  I think you
could get around this by using some more inert electrode (platinum
perhaps?) but then the chlorine is going to try and react with
something.  Again this doesn\'t make things totally unworkable...line the
inside of the tanks with the same non-corrosive plating.  This could
lead to some interesting shipboard problems it the tech at the last
starport didn\'t repair that hole from the fuel hit properly (I suppose
we could say that hulls are non-corrosive--but IMHO withstanding by
withstanding vacuum, high (ocean bottom) pressures, extremely low temps
(distant space), extremely high temps (gas giant & near star ops), the
hull is already doing quite a job and should not me made invincible to
corrosion--I\'m all for resistant but not non-corrosive.)  In addition,
remember that even if your tank lining is flawless, you are going to
have lines that carry this stuff away to be dumped and Cl is VERY bad
for you health in relatively small quantities (although higher I guess
than your average swimming pool) and a pretty unhappy way to
go--drowning in your own mucus.

Of course if you purify the water first and then add just a little bit
of sulfuric acid you get the H2(g) and O2(g) as everyone has said
earlier.  You then must protect against that but I believe it would be
much easier because 1) I think more materials are resistant to it and
2)the concentration required is very small.  (also I am unsure as to
whether electrolysis can be done without H2SO4 if enough power is
supplied--but I do know at least that H2SO4 catalyses the reaction so it
can be done at lower voltages--i.e. a 1.5 volt battery and pure H20 get
you nowhere as pure waters resisance is to high, but a 1.5 volt battery,
water, and H2SO4 or NaCl produce results.  Again--I\'m not sure , but it
would seem that at high enough voltage it can be done without a
catalyst.  I imagine that this is the method that has been being refered
to in previous electrolysis posts as no catalyst was ever mentioned.

I apologize for this if the reason people didn\'t post about the catalyst
was because it is painfully obvious to everybody....

Hmm. Ceding parts of the system sounds a bit too much, considering how 
useful it is in a space-faring civilization. I\'m not even sure that 
\'ceding\' is the right word anyway, I always assumed that whatever fief a 
noble held, they got some income from it, but did not control the lives of 
the inhabitants in any way - they were still citizens of world X and the 
imperium, not Baron Flibble\'s serfs.

Planets themselves would want to have nobles associated with them anyway, 
to represent them in the moot. What possibly happens is that a world is 
allowed a noble of rank n, where \'n\' depends on the importance of said 
world. The planet\'s government is asked if it wishes to have one of it\'s 
citizens elevated to represent them, or maybe even elected. If the planet 
assents the Imperium drops their Imperial Taxes by X percent for a 
period of time to cover the cost of acquiring territory on the planet for
the noble, then title of the purchased land is given to the noble on the 
understanding that he represents the planet(or town, continent, whatever).

On planets with a long noble presence the local royalty will probably be 
co-opted as Imperial Nobility. 

In 1100 with the nobility well established most nobles will be that - 
nobles, but in Milleau 0 there will be a larger percentage of \'appointed\' 
nobles - those who are selected to represent a government.

There\'s an article in Traveller\'s Digest 9 or 10 on Nobles in the third 
Imperium, I haven\'t had time to browse through it, but it may be worth 
referring to - as it is pretty much canon.

I\'m actually running a noble character in my current MT game, a son of 
the Count of Shibashiim, in Core sector. As a Baron he represents one of 
the systems industrialized moons, but only recieves income through his 
father. He has the honour of representing the people on the moon, but 
gains no income directly from it. This would handle the problem of \'what 
land do we give our son/daughter?\' It doesn\'t matter - for they won\'t 
really own it - neither will the Noble parent.

Good incentive to go out into the galaxy and tame it for the empire - 
Mother\'s threatening to cut off the stipend and the Imperium\'s supporting 
colonization missions into the wilds.

   If you mean the contract dispute that she had with the producers,
yes.  Apparently she wanted to take some episodes off this coming season
and they said forget it.

   No telling who is at fault or exactly what the real story is.  I\'d be
curious as to whether this is a case of SAS (Spoiled, Short-Sighted
Actor Syndrome) or if management blew it.

    'body' => 'Being a Traveller GM since 1977, I had to develop my own organizational
infrastructure for the Imperium, which I use today. Anything involving
justice or law enforcement comes under the Ministry of Justice (MOJ).
The MOJ includes the Imperial Police Force, the MOJ Special Branch, The
Imperial Marshal Service, the Imperial Courts, as well as an
Inspectorate.

The Imperial Police (ImPol) operates much like a national police force
and has a good reputation. It has an enforcement division for general
crime-fighting; a security division, charged with the protection of
witnesses and the Imperial Courts; and a Criminal Intelligence Division
(CID) which collects intelligence and conducts surveillance against
criminal and terrorist organizations.

The MOJ Special Branch operates much like the FBI or Scotland Yards
Special Branch. It does the hardcore investigative work involving crimes
conducted on Imperial property or against Imperial officials.

The Inspectorate has a mandate from the Emperor and is staffed with
investigators who have noble rank themselves. They investigate criminal
activities involving other nobility or even members of the royal family
(in theory anyway). It also serves an Internal Affairs function when
other Imperial law enforcement personnel are involved in crimes.

In my universe the Imperial Courts fall under this Ministry also. The
Imperial Judges and Attorneys are appointed by the Emperor as
recommended by the Minister of Justice. They have a fair reputation and
are mostly honest. 

I also created the Imperial Marshal Service which functions more like
the Texas Rangers of the old west or the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
Found on frontier or back worlds (generally Imperial protectates or
"reserved" worlds) and mostly operating alone, or with a partner and
occassionally with a trusty genetically-enhanced smart-horse and
smart-dog. They\'re not as fond of the technology and many resort to
carrying lever-action rifles and quickdraw revolvers. Many are also
stationed on Imperial outposts or mining colonies, much like in the
movie "Outland". These are a rugged breed of men not much on the social
graces and with a strong sense of honor and duty to the law.

I\'ve also developed the Ministry of Security which oversees the Imperial
Secret Service (ISS), the Imperial Guard and the Imperial Psi Corps
(Yes, I developed this organization many years before B5).

The Imperial Secret Service performs much of the same duties of any
intelligence organization (like the CIA, KGB or Gestapo) and has
developed a negative reputation. Their activities are classified as is 
their organizational structure.  

The Imperial Guard has several branches and roles. Its personnel are
born into the Guard and their loyality to the Emperor is unquestionable.
The Palace Guard protects the Palace and the Emperor and his family. The
Emperor\'s Black Guard is an large elite military fighting force used by
the Emperor for special operations. They have their own starships and
the latest in weapontry and technology. They could be likened to the
German SS divisions of WWII.

The Imperial Psi Corps are another secret organization with a questional
rep. The Emperor has given them license to use Psionics for the
protection of the Imperium.

Just thought I\'d drop my Cr2 into this conversation. In a recent
adventure I did I in the M0 era (year 15) I had the Imperial Security
Agency (ISA) involved.  What I figured them to be is anagalous to the
United States\' CIA, that is, there job is in assessing external threats
and spying outside the Imperium\'s territory (is that analogy correct?).

I had them as a direct descendent of the Sylean Security Bureau (SSB),
and had them have strong ties to the IISS as well.  They often use
outsiders (ie. PCs) as scouts in their security missions without letting
the PCs in on the whole truth.  For example, in my adventure an Imperial
Recontact Team had gone missing, and the ISA wanted it kept quiet.  They
hired PCs to go to a planet and survey the area for radio signals,
knowing that hey would detect the Recontact Team.  Thus, withotu
informing the characters, the ISA got the team back as it wanted.

Haven\'t really done much more on them, as I used that quickly as an
adventure hook, and since my campaign has moved out of Imperial space
(way out) it\'s of no use now.

Thanks.

This would be how the pool of "true" Land Holding Nobles is increased.
If a world is populated then the grant can only happen as the world is
integrated into the Imperium as the Nobles are the force that bind the
Imperial Worlds together and all worlds must have noble representation
(In some worlds case they have many nobles while others just as sizable
have only one).
If a world is unpopulated then the act of granting a noble exploitation
rights to an area creates a new member world and the colony is started.

For example:
A company wishes to exploit a world - they petition the emperor (they
are an Imperial Company with several Nobles on the board) and win
permission.  They could (with the emperors permission) establish fiefs
for the Nobles on the board, or they could enoble another member of the
board, or they could increase the size of the board with a new noble, or
they could come to some sort of deal and pay a noble a fee for the
exploitation of his fief.
In any case the government type is 1 and the colony is up and running.
Later in the colonies life it is taken over by a religious dictatorship
:( but the noble continues to get his income based on levies etc... and
passes on the Imperial Percentage or the Imperial Navy is ordered to
"Sort It Out".

To summarise:
A nobles income is seldom from a fief in the term used in the past, but
rather is a cut of the Imperial Levies and Taxes for the region the
noble is responsible for.  A nobles standing is improved if the Taxes
and Levies are Improved (i.e POP, and TL increase, or trade is
improved[and taxed]).
While Nobles may have estates in the 100\'s of kilometers they create
personal income as related to the investment that the noble has
personally made, rather than the cut the noble gets for administering
that part of the Imperium.

No! (To Leroy: Are you reading the same T4 books I am??? They are all at

Just like TNE was sufficiently different from CT/MT that it was not truly
compatable, T4 is also likewise incompatable with BOTH ct/mt and TNE. Not
that I inherently dislike any of the 4 editions, but T4 is barely the same
feel as any previous editions.

Agreed. Here\'s where I beg MM to do a reprint editions of MT (with the
erratta applied) in two volumes (PM/IE/COACC, RM/RC/RebSB/HT)...
<grovelling on floor> Please???</grovelling>

seriously, though, the cannon is too intricate for those barely familiar
with it (as several IG types admitted at various points early on) to be
able to add to it in any consistent manner. So Marc, scrub it all before
you break it all.  CT, MT, and TNE survive. If only through the love of
their players. T4 is developing a different audience, as did Traveller
2300...

Well, I would guess that the amounts would be a matter of negotiation.
Getting 20% of secondary worlds (which could be significant in pop
and economic value) and 50% of a planetoid belt (which can be very
significant in value)  would seem a bit steep for a system that is
joining voluntarily (or at least with out big opposition).

Basically, I believe that a lot of the careers should have their own
book for grandeouse (eek! sp?), and larger than single character
adventures.  Pocket Empires is obviously aimed at the noble family, and
noble careers, as is the upcoming Nobles book.  The product listing also
has Imperial Squadrons which supposedly will detail fleets constructio,
fleet batles etc, obviously an expansion of the Navy class.  

What\'s being ignored here is the need for a mass scale ground combat
system, to complement the Army career, plus come kind of book, perhaps
named "Syndicates" to complement the running of an organized crime
bureau.

So:

PE & Nobles for the Noble career
Imperial Sqaudrons for the Navy
"Megacorporations" for the Merchant
"Syndicates" for the Rogue

Personally, I can\'t see any large scale things for the scholar career,
except perhaps detailing lab work, etc. on a much bigger scale than a
single person.  Even so, I can\'t see that being that exciting, IMHO. 
The same goes for Agents and Entertainers, I don\'t think the running of
an acting troupe of police agency is too Traveller-esque.

However, I do think both the "Syndicates" and "Megacorporations" ideas
could work, perhaps within the same volume, which would detail both
legal and illegal means of business. 

Is IG planning a mass combat system ala Seeker, etc. to complement the
Army though?  This work work best is it, along with the upcoming
Imperial Squadrons to supplement PE\'s combat system?

Thanks,

   You have landed in the middle of the Traveller and Marc Miller\'s
Traveller (T&MMT) equivalent of New York City.  In your first few days
here, you managed to piss off several taxi drivers, get mugged, and
nearly run over by a truck because you weren\'t paying attention (maybe
you were too busy staring at all the tall buildings).  Welcome to New
York, have a nice f----ing day.

   I think you are missing my point.  The published universe of Marc
Miller\'s Traveller is not the same universe as the Traveller we all know
and love up until Feb. 1996.  While there are similarities, there are
also many differences in terms of game mechanics and storyline. 
Disconnecting the two eliminates many conflicts.

   I understand why you feel it necessary to try to patch them together
Leroy, but it isn\'t going work.

   Someone new to Marc Miller\'s Traveller will likely become confused by
the contradictory information in the old books.  These contradictions
will grow over time as the writers of MMT diverge further and further
from Traveller canon.

   Traveller is indeed the "father" of Marc Miller\'s Traveller, but just
as a son is not his father, so MMT is not Traveller.  Call it the next
generation if you must, but it is *different*.

   You are talking about a very minor issue (no pun intended).  The
revelation that the Aslan copied a jump drive instead of inventing it
did nothing to the Aslan Hierate, nor did it change the unfolding of
future events.  "Secret of the Ancients" was the same way.  The PCs get
to meet Grandfather and get to experience a taste of *really* high
technology.  This means exactly diddley-squat to the big picture.  Game
balance was maintain.  Fusion Plus (a MMT invention) on the other hand
totally changes game balance and re-writes history.  A TL 15 Rule of Man
totally changes game balance and re-writes history.  There are other
things, but you get the idea.

   Funny you should mention TNE, because despite of how it made the
future turn out for the Third Imperium, despite the introduction of
Heplars and everything else, it did not invalidate a single event prior
to 1130.  The same thing can\'t be said of Marc Miller\'s Traveller.

   Marc chose to take the basic concepts of his old game and develop a
new one from it.  I do not begrudge him that--it is his right as the
copyright holder.  In his shoes, I may have even made some of the same
choices (though I would also have done many things differently).  But it
is important to remember that it is a *new* game, and not the same one
we "old farts" remember.

   I\'m afraid not.  If you chose to spend your time trying to glue
together MMT and Traveller, I wish you well (though your time would be
better spent on developing projects for MMT).  The rest of us from the
Old Guard would do well to continue to develop Traveller amongst
ourselves, and borrow from Marc Miller\'s Traveller those things which we
like.  Borrowing is also a Traveller tradition after all.

   The current cost of Marc Miller\'s Traveller is $302.40 and that
figure will go up considerably after GenCon in August.  I look at the
CT, MT, and TNE books on my shelf (God knows how much I spent on them
all) and realize that MMT invalidates many of them (eventually probably
all of them).  I read and participate in the clashes between those that
follow the "new" canon versus the "old" canon.  Rumors of rewriting
history after 1129 crop up.  I don\'t want to use D6 for task
resolution.  I ask why.

   Making the disconnect solves the problem.  My wallet is safe.  My
Traveller collection is still valid.  I don\'t worry about what the new
books rewrite.  I create my own ending to the TNE storyline and share it
with other TNE fans for debate and criticism.  I use my D20s.  I am at
peace.  I am having fun.

   That is what it\'s all about, right Leroy?  Having fun, not just doing
things because someone with ulterior motives tells you to?

Harold

But you do have Hydrogen at 4000K which must be =

at a more reasonable temperature generated by
electrolysis. Even if you do exchange heat =

energy ( I suspect that you are neglecting
the energy required to get the water to =
4000K in the first place, and have only
calculated your figures using the extra =

So with electrolysis I get cool products, =
and with thermal dissociation, I get =
high pressure high temperature products. =
I think the former would be easier
to handle, wouldn\'t they ?

Is this 0.0075 MW per hour per cubic =
metre of LHyd produced, or 0.0075 MW =

gaseous hydrogen at 10
atm and 200K ?

What are the equations for calculating =

And where did you get the figures =

percentage of hull for drive. Fuel space is 10% of hull per Jn.

CP=(Pr/100,000)xTL=MCr * TL * 10

Pr is Price in Cr, TL is highest TL in that section or the ship or the
design\'s overall TL (You choose, but I figure many TL 14 & 15 ships will
have several areas using TL 13 or lower for ease of mainetnance). MCr is
Price in MCr. CP is FINAL CP REQUIRED for the section

181 holodaynamic (Holographic) linked panels, inputing 271.5 CP to the
computer, which multiplies them by the CP Multiplier to find final CP out.
But, for building, I teach a reversed approach, as follows.

OK, a ship needs CP equalliung the required CP from all sections listed on
RM 81,. Lets say, for example, a ship had a total CP requirement (CPR) of
3000.

Next, pick a computer. Divide CPR by the CP Multiplier. The result is panel
cp needed (PCPN) If PCPN is greater than the listed maximum CP Input for
the computer, get a bigger computer. Also, remeber that you need 3
computers what match each other.

Examples:
<A>     CPR=3000
        Model   CPMult  Max CPIn        PCPN
        1       10      5000            300

     CPR = 60000
        Mod     CPM     MxCPIn  PCPN
        1       10      5000    6000    Not meaty enough
        1/bis   15      7500    4000    Useable
        2       15      10,000  4000    Useable

Next, install panels (Step 8 Bridge, Substep 4, RM p 81) whose CP equals
PCPN or more. Generally, it is better to ballance out more panels and more
powerful computers, as Computer Model # has many combat effects. Linked
panels are the only ones that matter here, as well as add-ons.

If not installing a computer, all CPR must be met or exceeded with Basic
Mechanical, Enhanced Mechanical, or Electronic (NOT ELECTRONIC LINKED)
controls.

Ah, but the key word is "dabbled". I considered stating the question as
"this humaniti race" but thought that might give it away. The race I was
thinking of is...the Darrians! For those of you who have the AM #8,
check out the advanced Navy character generation skill charts near the
back of the supplement. Skill #4 under "Special Arm" is Telepathy.

I never understood why the Zhodani didn\'t subvert the Darrians to gain
access to the remnant TL16 technology even though they must have
discovered the Star Trigger was initially a hoax through the use of
psionic covert agents. Not until I ran across this, that is. Kinda
difficult to infiltrate a branch of a foreign military which uses
Telepathy even if you\'re telepathic.

The Darrian major contributions are, of course, TL16 technology in
the Spinward Marches and the Star Trigger.

	Crossing rifts in space has always been a problem. Ships that can\'t jump
across voids have to circumnavigate a route around any rift in order to
find their way across it.

	Then, on page 81 of Pocket Empires, in the \'War\' section, it mentions deep
space depots that can be built in empty star hexes to support and refuel
ships to help them reach worlds that would otherwise be beyond their jump
range.

	So, unless I\'ve got something wrong here, stellar empires can be noted as
being able to construct deep space resupply stations to enable ships to
reach out further than they ever could. Also, the PE rules state that a
pocket empire would at least have difficulty in attacking another pocket
empire that\'s far away enough. Yet, with a line of these resupply bases
PE\'s can attack slightly further out than I originally thought.

	I can\'t really remember reading anything at all in all the Traveller books
I\'ve got about deep space supply depots. Is this something I\'ve missed?
What references are there about them? Surely various empires would have
built these depots to cross rifts, saving time and money. The possibilities
here would be endless when you consider the DS9 and B5 type stations that
your players could come across.

        In all my campaigns, Psionics has been only a rumour, totally
unavailable to players. In my first campaigns, I even stated that psionics
did not exist, but, later, it was though to explain the Zhodani...
nevertheless, for me it\'s quite clear that, if the referee wants to,
Traveller campaigns can easily be psionics-free.

Well, about 100K higher, which is pretty trivial given that the heat 
capacity of H2 is 28.824 J/K/mol at constant pressure.  Hence to cool 
the equivalent of 1 m^3 of LH2 (1/14 tonne) by 100K requires the 
removal of 100 MJ of heat (not 200 -- heat capacity is for 1 mol H2).
Electrolysis costs 10 000 times the molar heat capacity i.e. 100 MJ 
is approximately 1% of the energy required for electrolysis.

O2 and H2O(g) have similar heat capacities, so if you cool the whole 
lot indiscriminately it may take more like 250 MJ / m^3 LH2.  If you 
have to cool it 400K that\'s still only 10% of the cost of 
electrolysis.

"Whole lot" here I use to mean the reaction mixture, which will be 
roughly 40/40/20 water / H2 / O2.

Sigh.  OK, you want numbers with that?

Heat capacity of H2O(g) at constant pressure = 33.58 J/K/mol
ditto of liquid H2O = 75.29 J/K/mol
enthalpy of vaporisation of H2O = 40.656 kJ/mol at 373K, 1 atm

For water starting at 298K (25 C) and ending as 4000K steam, all at 1 
atm pressure,

(75 * 75.29 + 40656 + 3627 * 33.58) J/mol = 168.1 kJ/mol

which is something like 60% of the energy of electrolysis.  However, 
there are three points to make:

i) a proportion of this heat can be recovered from the products
ii) if done at constant volume, the work done in expanding the steam 
is zero and this saves up to R \\Delta T = 8.314 J/K/mol * 3627 K
 = 30.1 kJ/mol
iii) if you have high-pressure, high-temperature steam and expand it 
through a throttle, it is possible to use the Joule-Thomson effect to 
heat the steam.  The effect of this is to simultaneously decrease the 
pressure and increase the temperature, which leads to an efficient 
conversion of steam into H2 and O2.  How much this will help I don\'t 
know, not having any data on the J-T coefficient for water, but it\'s 
a possible way to improve efficiency.

Total energy cost for the process is

Low pressure, high temp. products, I\'d say -- high p inhibits the

Lower T and p are both easier, yes...

Oh, sorry, per m^3 of liquid H2.

Well, if we assume ideal gases (no data for anything else),
work done *by* compression w is:

against const. external pressure p_ex,  w = p_ex \\Delta V

reversible, const. T, w = nRT ln (V_final / V_initial)

adiabatic (e.g. mechanical compression of gas w/out other heating)
 w = - C_V \\Delta T where C_V is the heat capacity at constant volume
(roughly equal to C_p - R)

minus sign means expansion decreases T

Creative use of the above 8-).  IIRC I assumed reversible, isothermal 
compression followed by adiabatic expansion cooling.  These are 
somewhat ideal numbers, therefore...  also used 20K as boiling point 
of H2.

	Um...I think you still can actually. You can access almost anything via
email on the InterNet. If you check out "Doctor Bob\'s Guide to Offline
Internet Access" it\'ll tell you how to retrieve any type of file that
normally resides on Web or FTP sites. I know it works because I\'ve used it
in the past.

	Retrieving by email sometimes makes sense. If your ISP\'s connection to the
net is having a bad day and is pretty slow and you want to download a large
file, you can send email commands to \'get\' a file via email. The fle will
then arrive at your ISP\'s server, and you can then retreive it via email
when it\'s ready. Because your connection to this file is just to your ISP,
it\'ll come down at pretty much full speed without having to go through all
them nasty slow servers that makes up the connection to the files original
physical location. Or that\'s the way I perceive it as working anyway.

	The Doctor Bob document will tell you how to do it. It\'s a few years old,
but it may still have enough in it to be of use. Anyone who wants it, I\'ll
send it to you, it\'s too long to post here.

	Sorry this isn\'t too Traveller related, but it does help some people get
Traveller files, if it still works that is.

	its usual to provide http for users, and ftp for the staff
	(doing upload/deletes/etc). The only reson a user would prefer
	ftp, is that many ftp servers offer a tar.gz download of

I disagree, though I am not too big on canon, it does make compatibility
with all the books I own kind of nice. :)

  (If you are LOL right now having heard that from me, consider that
   pre-conceived notions about my approach to canon may be wrong.  I
   had a pre-conceived notion about TML that canon is the Mother and
   canon is the Father.  I may have been wrong there, but that is how
   I chose to start the discussion of RoM TL.

   BTW, until Marc posted his use of LOL, I was using an older, less
   suitable interpretation of "Little Old Lady", so now I am "laughing
   out loud." :)

I think _any_ Traveller adventure/booklet/idea/era/amber zone/ship\'s locker
etc. is exactly _what we_ make of it.

This is actually an occassion when IG didn\'t violate exisitng Canon.  In
DGP\'s Traveller\'s Digest # 19 mentions fuel depots being used by the Aslan
to cross the Riftspan Reaches rift.  It\'s a natural enough idea that I\'d
expect that every major race has used it (especially early on when Jump 1
was the maximum).

Is a noble without property really a noble? One of the obligations 
of medieval aristocracy was to \'live nobly\' (a vague term, but 
everyone seemed to know what it meant). If a family was unable to 
maintain its social position and was reduced to living in a mud 
hut it would forfeit its noble status. So if the father squanders 
the fortune, the son can only petition the Emperor to succeed to 
the title if he can convince a council of his peers (other 
subsector nobles) that he will be able to live in a suitably grand 
manner.

On the subject of noble property, vast amount of MegaCorporation 
stock, according to old Supplement 8, was in the hands of noble 
families -- 8% of LSP, 35% of General Products. Now was this 
because the founders of the MegaCorps were able to buy themselves 
titles, or did the noble families accept stock in exchange for 
granting the MegaCorps exploitation rights/market concessions in 
their fiefs?

My thought is that Academy schooling counts to muster out (Military Academy,

This is caused by the compression of ranks at the lower enlisted level.. (E1

True; similarly, "mains" direct the large fraction of J1 traffic.  Mains
and voids are the key "terrain" of Traveller astrography.

Yes, analogous to the way otherwise unihabited and resource-poor islands
in mid-Pacific were used to project US force against Japan during WWII.

Yes, though like any such long logistics arm, it makes an especially
tempting target for your enemies.  Break any one link and everyone
"downstream" is suddenly in deep trouble.

This is only mentioned canonically in TNE, which puts it outside the Holy
Church\'s jurisdiction according to some on this list. :)  The Regency
Sourcebook (RSB) called such stepping-stone bases "Calibration Points"
(CP), and marked the positions of (secret) military ones in the Regency.
It also mentioned that others might easily exist, both secret and public.
It certainly seems a natural thing to build, if a base on some
interstellar iceball will cut 2 months off the passage between hi-pop
worlds A and B -- and the company that builds it can get rich selling fuel
and supplies to the traffic.

Non-canonically, but right here on the TML, Command X\'s "Planet X" is
actually such a way-station, located in a deep-space hex just coreward (as
I recall) of Sylea.

I\'ll leave it to those with broader CT/MT collections to inform us if
deep-space refuelling stations were ever mentioned before TNE.

=46olks, this is a brief reminder for everyone.

travlang@earth.execnet.com is the address of the list, not the
address of the listserver.  You would send to
travlang@earth.execnet.com if you wanted to post a message to the
list.

To _subscribe_ to the list, you must send your message to
maiser@earth.execnet.com - maiser is the list server program
address.  Include a body line of=20

subscribe travlang Your Name

and the subject is irrelevant.  Remember, list control commands
are sent to _maiser_, not travlang.

The reason that you will get the "restricted" error if you try to
post without being subscribed is because I made the judgement
call to so restrict the list - most of the lists I am a member of
have converted from unrestricted to restricted because of spam; I
resolved that TravLang would _not_ have that problem from the
get-go.

	But, if the empire was big enough, some bases could be well within its
borders and therefore be very far away from where a first offensive would
take place.

	Also, would it not be reasonable to assume that some races would have such
an outlook on life etc that they may build these bases no matter what? For
instance, forgive me for foregeting my history here ;-) but how long were
the Solomanis in space before they encountered the Vilani? They could have
built bases unaware that such a strong star-faring race was so close to
them so figured on them being worth building.

	Yes, some corporations would surely become rich enough to be able to build
these things. Also, couldn\'t a deep space depot take the form of several
large super tankers permanently moored around say a few powerful ships and
few other ships for admin and R & R? Jump tankers could be continually
jumping backwards and forwards between here and a near star system with a
gas giant to refuel the moored tankers.

	And as for secret bases, wouldn\'t there be a few Ancient ones lying around
somewhere? Just imagine the sight of finding a million ton hulk of metal
floating in a non-star hex, totally alien, no lights, no signal emissions,
just asking to be explored...

	I only ever played CT and now T4, and have a few New Era bits but haven\'t
read them yet, so any decent references detailing space stations would be
most helpful.

The only other references I recall are those from TNE. In the Regency
Source
Book, such refueling locations were called "calibration points". These
points
ranged from "a natural source of hydrogen, typically a comet nucleus or
other
icy body" to the rare rogue planet to space stations with all the
comforts of
a major starport.

The really great thing about deep space stations is that they\'re so
blasted
difficult to find if you don\'t have exact coordinates. They\'re great for
commerce raiding, hit and run raids, and, if discovered, for slowing
down
and/or tying up enemy forces. Even a small comet can be used to trash at
least one capital ship if its location is "leaked" after a number of
heavily
shielded tactical nukes with proximity fuses are buried in it (been
there,
done that).

I used to love to play bounty hunter characters as well as run campaigns
with them involved.  Sometimes the bounty hunters in campaigns I ran
were NPCs used to move the story line along.

One interesting twist I threw at some players in one of my campaigns was
the problem of getting a fugitive that they were going to bring to
authorities on a world other than the one they were on off world.
Basicly smuggling them out.  Of course, if they were caught they would
be arrested themselves and held for kidnapping as the warrant that they
were "serving" on the fugitive was not valid on that world...

Anyway, strictly speaking bounty hunters can get real boring if you
aren\'t carefull how you run the campaigns with them in them.  There is a
real temptation to make them become a vehicle of "Monty Haul\'ism."  

My rule of thumb as a ref was to always make the bad guys at least as
tough if not tougher than the players that were chasing them, or
whatever the situation was.

Hmmm... maybe I should publish some of my older campaigns....

Personally, I\'d like to see more background material on Imperial law,
Imperial courts, punishment, etc. The last few posts dealing with
bounty hunters, et al piqued my interest (I kicked butt in the MT2
computer game). After all, these are the things that can affect an
adventure the most. ;-)

I\'d also like to see material that covers aspects of daily life
within the Imperium, such as banking, intrasystem travel
regulations and requirements, military/civilian communications
protocols, the M0 equivalent of the Internet, yadayadayada...

Although DGP covered some of this in their Travellers\' Digests,
info of this type with an M0 spin could help newbie players more
easily immerse themselves in the role-playing aspects of the game
while giving us "old farts" (and proud of it) additional background
material to pull from (not to mention providing Imperium Games
another boost to the old cash flow).

   As scary as it might seem, we agree totally except for this one
passage.

   While it is true that TNE\'s mechanics are sufficently different from
CT/MT that they are for the most part not compatible (afterall, much of
TNE\'s mechanics come from Twilight:2000), the official timeline is the
same in all three versions.  The only real difference is *where* on that
timeline the action is taking place.  I could just as easily run a TNE
campaign occuring in the year 1108 as I could a MT campaign occuring in
the year 1202 or a CT campaign occuring in the year 1119.

>5. The Promotion roll is also too easy.

   In the modern U.S. Army (that is, c.1980 to the present), the average
officer *in peacetime* can expect to get promoted from 2LT to 1LT after
18 months, Captain after four years, Major after ten to twelve years,
hopefully reaching "full bird" Colonel about the time he or she gets his
20 years in.  After that, making general is a matter of politics and
luck.  Promotions can come much slower (or not at all) if you get some
unfavorable officer evaluations.  On the other hand, promotions can come
*much* faster in wartime, or if you are seen as a "fair haired boy" on
the career fast track.  Making Brigadier General (one star) is not
unheard of before age 40.

   Assuming that the Third Imperium of MMT is a rapidly expanding power,
you could expect to make rank pretty easy, since good officers don\'t
have to wait for the ranks above them to thin before getting promoted.

>6. Enlisted promotion is too rapid in first term.

   For enlisted types in the U.S. Army, if you don\'t make E-5 (Sergeant)
by your 5th year of service, it\'s because you\'ve done something *really*
bad.

   Again, an expanding military would make promotions easier to obtain
for enlisted types as well as officers.

7. Because of (5), officers get 1 extra skill per term.

  Computers, definitely computers. The computers in all of the editions
of Traveller have been under rated. Something along the line of a (and I
hate to say this!) cyberpunk set of rules for programming and using
computers. IIRC Traveller 2300 had a couple of good ideas in this line.
Let\'s face it looking at what most of us are using now, I don\'t buy the
limits on ship board computers for a second. By the 3I I\'d expect the
computers to be able to handle most of the functions on their own.
*********
A Noble steps on his yacht, blonde on his arm. The lights snap on as
they pass through the access hall from the small boat bay. Temperature,
humidity, light level, etc. adjusts to the Nobles preferences.
"Hello, (Baron, Marquis, Duke, etc.). How are you today?"
"Fine, Ship. Listen, take us once around the moons of ----. Oh, and
hold all calls." he leads the blonde toward the onboard swimming pool.
Elsewhere in the ship the maneuver drives light up. The ship\'s computer
connects to e the planetary databanks and confirms it\'s own calculations
of the locations of the various bodies in the current solar system,
calculates a course, downloads it to the network and various agencies
involved, then begins to implement it. At the same time it adjusts the
temperature of the water in the pools, switches on the Noble\'s favorite
music, and begins a 3-D projection of a tropical island beach around the
walls of the pool room.
"Oh, Ship, a couple of Mai Tai\'s please."
Promptly a small extension unit (robot) mixes the drinks to the specs
stored in the computer, then trundles on nearly silent wheels, to the
poolside. Meanwhile the ship executes several course adjustments. All
without another person aboard.

The other ideas I was throwing around were a 20-ton fighter and a

I\'d personally expect this kind of thing to be in the M0 Campaign book. 
For instance, it should mention how on-planet communications are done in
M0.  Do they have phone booths?  Or are they vid-phones?  Do they have
an internet, etc.

Many Traveller adventures I\'ve run have been on planet, and I\'ve often
had to adlib the material to cover life on a planet outside of the
starport.  This may be in some old stuff I don\'t have, but it\'d be nice
to know what things are like in M0.

Thanks

Unless you screw up you will usually get promoted.  In most of the 
militaries now if you don\'t get promoted you are kicked out.  A 20 
year career as an officer gets you to the O5 and fast track guys O6 
in 20-22 years.

Any promotion (enlisted or officer) should receive the extra skill 
bonus.

Yeesh!  The RCCC goes on vacation for *three days*, and look what happens..
cigarette burns on the couch, tastefully dressed Vargr, and now pi is equal
to 3!!!

Well, since Marc said it.. *ahem*

BY DECREE OF HIS MARCNESS, PI SHALL BE THREE, AND THREE SHALL BE THE NUMBER
OF PI.  TWO SHALL NOT BE THE NUMBER, UNLESS FOLLOWED BY THREE.  FIVE IS
RIGHT OUT!

Yet when I, along with a few others, pointed out to you how the list
worked, we were brushed off with "you have to wait until *I\'m* ready."

I\'ve played the game since it\'s release.  My nickname in High School was
traveller!  I have spent many enjoyable hours re-reading old supplements to
get a better feel for the setting.  I would wager that my understanding of
the Traveller experience, both rules and backround, rivals yours.

It wasn\'t your theory, it was your attitude.  You were dimissive,
condescending, and rude.  I\'m a great believer in the Golden rule, so I
assumed that you were threating me the way you wished to be treated.

We took your evidence and refuted it point-for-point.  That\'s not a
difference of opinion, that\'s using what you had to show your mistakes.  We
had a discussion about how the Imperium would handle rebellious worlds..
some thought that genocidal tactics would be employed, others thought that
a more "velvet fist" approach would be more useful.  No one attempted to
announce that they were right, and that everybody else was wrong.

*Sigh*  You announced that you had evidence that the RoM was at a very high
TL.  You stated that this would change our worldview.  Only when you were
proven wrong did you start saying that you were just trying to start
discussion.. I find it hard to take you seriously when you lack the courage
to admit that you were mistaken.

Yes, but he isn\'t posting to the TML.  I could jump around and demand
recognition for my old Restored Catholic Empire game, but it won\'t fly.  (I
may put the backround on a web page someday..)  We have to operate in a
common milieu to get anything done.  Imagine a THUDDD if I posted a design
that had an AI computer at TL12 and force fields since that\'s the way *my*
game runs, while Roderick is using realistic engines and weapons for his
campaign.  Traveller Canon gives us a common ground on which to base
discussions and debate.

Absolutley.  In my upcoming FFW game, the Sword Worlders will be far more
active (and sucessful) in Lunion than in canonical history.. up to a point.

Right, just throw 20 years out the window.  Why not use resources like the
AAB and Traveller Library Data pages to compile everything we know about
the Imperium and its enviroment?  TLs, names, history.. It\'d be quite a
project and probably a load of fun.

Remember that according to that adventure, only a tiny minority know about
the true story of the Pathfinder crash and the copied j-drives.  99.9% of
all Aslan *know* that they developed jump drives on their own, and are a
Major Race.

OK. We get an Imperium which does not rule systems, but rather the space between
systems, but they demand territory on your world as a condition of joining.

To me, this just doesnt mesh. Why does the Imperium *want* land on planets ???
Forty square miles for a starport, sure, but a signifigant proportion of
the worlds surface ? Isnt this creating a running sore for anti-Imperial
sentiment, and a sitting target for local resistance ("The damned Imperials
in their enclave ... they are sucking the wealth out of the planet. Lets burn
them in their holes !").

IMO joining the Imperium is an offer you cant refuse for a PE in M0. For a start,
they have nuke dampers and meson screens, and you dont. Therefore, if it
comes to war, you die. And they are about thirty times bigger than you are.

But what the Imperium doesnt want is worlds that join resentfully, and see
themselves as exploited. Taxes are a fee-for-service thing, and the service
is every pirate within a dozen parsecs knowing the IN patrols your system
with bigger and better ships than they can dream of. But signing over a
large chunk of your surface is going to be a political nightmare - look at
PNG as an example, where the compensation to landowners of mineral resources
caused a rebellion on Bouganville. Sure, if you join the Imperium, everyone
will benefit - but if you happen to live in Kansas, which was one of the
provinces ceded to the Emperor as a condition of joining, then are you
going to be happy with the Imperium, those bastards who stole your house ?

Please, Marc, make Nobles buy their own lands, or have the ability to slice
off a small chunk of the tax take. Dont require worlds to cede large chunks
of their surface to the Imperium, to be given to some oik with a title.

(standard Fusion plus rant deleted ... any world approached by the Imperium
to join will have been within the range of Imperial Traders for 10 years
or so ... they will already have as many Fusion plus units as they want and
can afford. Anyway, thruster plates, nuke dampers and meson screens are far
far more useful TL12 technologies for a TL11 world to have).

I disagree. A lot of noble families in the RW lived in strained
circumstances. In such a case, I would imagine a lot of younger
sons becoming career officers in the Navy and Marines, and hoping
to marry an heiress, and thus rescue the family finances.

My guess is that they in effect bought titles ... I\'m sure Cleon
ran short of cash and votes at times, and had favours done for him
by the major shareholders of the other megacorps ... remember, the
3I is a wholly-owned subsiduary of ZI, GsBAG, LSP et al :)

I disagree. Where 1/3 of skills on the Career table for a Merchant are Buisiness,
6 skills a term should get you Trader-8 in 5 terms, and that is assuming the
occasional roll on other tables. But this is a matter for GMs to police.

Essentially, they are the old Traveller ratings doubled (1 used to be trained,
2 professional, 3 expert and 4 damn good ... see the breakpoints for DMs
in High Guard for Pilot, Fleet Tactics etc).

Agreed. Although one could argue that the roll for NPCs should be a lot higher.

True, but sizes of military units are getting smaller, and thus the proportion
of higher officers is getting higher.

Beyond The Pale.  Here\'s the post-game summary:

The Cast:

Amr Santayema: a young and clever merchant, played by the TML\'s own Ross
Coburn, who the dudes at the Sylean Atmosphere Surfing Club would find
like, totally guava and gnarly in the extreme.

Lt Kehaaarl: An Aslan ex-marine.  Visualize Catbert, Evil H.R. Director, on
steroids and bad acid.  Played by Jason Jones, who has just subscribed to
the TML.

Sir Loreni Vilash: Vilani merchant from a poor family whose trading acumen
led him to a knighthood.  Currently just trying to make a living in the
middle of a revolution, and whose player missed this session and so will be
figuring prominently as another object lesson next game.

Perlis Dalal: a muscular female ex-scout, who\'s going to have to keep one
eye out for vengeful Rye-Ben for the rest of her life.  Played by the TML\'s
Glenn Grant.

Elo Lezaar, a highly geeky Vilani ex-Navy sensors and electronics tech.  He
mumbles, collects meditation rugs and gravitationally abuses bees, and is
played by TML\'er Sebastien Normandin.

Lt. Kurek: A tall, blond, shades-wearing former Navy gunner who\'ll be
manning the nuke damper and serving margaritas to the passengers.



	This bunch of intrepid adventurers is presently assembled, along
with a growingly large number of fellow fortune-seekers, on Mishegaan III,
an LSP mining colony, waiting for an Imperial interdict to lift on a
cluster of main-sequence stars three parsecs away.  They\'ve incorporated,
borrowed some money with the connivance of Liontzel Huutzaa (Ling\'s Chief
Legal Officer, the only lawyer in a two-parsec radius, and such a crooked
one he bumps into himself walking around corners on a regular basis) and
bought an FSY Recollet Exploratory Trader, which they named the Versailles.
However, Ling\'s unpleasant labour relations have led to a full-scale worker
revolt and they\'ve recently become involved in saving Ling\'s treasury from
the Rye-Ben Anti-Ling Defense League and getting many of Ling\'s key
personnel off-planet one step ahead of the lynch mob.

This week:


	After getting back to the ship after their hair-raising adventures
saving Ling\'s corporate bacon and blasting a bunch of poor oppressed miners
fighting for their rights, everybody retired to their quarters to sleep.
As day dawned, Sir Loreni stepped off the ship to be what was a simple
meeting lining up some cargo <low, sinister chuckles>, leaving the rest of
the party on board.  Shortly thereafter, Perlis was called by Lt. Kurek,
who had recently arrived on-planet and who had heard that the Versailles
was looking for another gunner.  As he looked competent and since she was
majority shareholder, Perlis hired him on the spot and then went back to
sleep.

	He arrived at the ship shortly thereafter, carrying several
ominous-looking high-tech suitcases.  Lt. Kehaaarl, who was curled up in a
ball on his quarters floor, sleeping, was awakened by his comm, which
patched him through to the airlock camera.  After verifying Lt. Kurek\'s
credentials, he went down to greet him.

	Meanwhile, Elo went through his morning routine of hygiene,
meditation, and switching the gravitational orientation of his beehive.
Sauntering into the crew lounge, he encountered Kehaaarl and Kurek, who
were having a manly/Aslanly bonding kind of conversation over the
Versaille\'s armament suite.  He joined in, but was shortly interrupted by a
comm ping from Leilei Vuushilipaarki, their engineer, who wanted some help
with some maintenance work on the purification plant.  He headed down to
engineering, and spent the next little while disassembling centrifuge
frombotzers and eliminating a nasty harmonic vibration in one of the sewage
titrators.

	We then switched to poor Amr.  The day before, he\'d recieved an
offer from the shady merchant who\'d sold him his spurt gun to repurchase
said weapon at something of a premium.  His mercantile soul never being
able to turn down a good deal, he\'d gone to meet the dealer, where he\'d
been Blurred by unknown assailants.  However, at the moment this was all
beyond his recall, as he awoke with dirt in his nostrils and the taste of
blood in his mouth.  He opened his eyes, and recieved a double eyeful of
more dirt for his pains.  Raising his arm, he realized that although
somewhat buried, he wasn\'t buried very deeply at all.  Hearing a voice say
something in an unknown language, he raised his head, and was promptly
whacked on it with a TL-12 Manual Personal Earthmoving Device, losing
consciousness again (those of you familiar with Vampire:The Masquerade will
recognize a strange and entirely intentional resemblance to the Sabbat\'s
Creation Rites).

	When next he awoke, he was face-down on some deckplating; stirring,
he was greeted by the sight of eight or so armed Rye-Ben United
Ling-Loathing Association members;  their leader informed him that if he
wanted to live, he\'d fly their ship (a 1,000 td 1G in-system ore hauler)
out of there for them.  Shortly thereafter, as he began warming up the
drives, more Mishegaan Anti-Suppressive Fascist League members entered,
carrying in the unconscious Dame Berek\'san and Vought Hendaar (Ling\'s local
chief executive), who looked like they had suffered from explosive
decompression and anoxia.  During his pre-flight routine, Amr set the ore
hauler\'s nav and landing lights flashing signal GK in Imperial Dot&Dash
code.

	Meanwhile, the terrorist leader had hooked a video cam up to the
comm board and began transmitting notice that they had hostages on board
and would shortly be violating the departure ban; reprisals against the
hostages would be taken if any interference was attempted.  The camera was
then switched off and the Rye-Ben promptly shot the unconscious Hendaar
repeatedly.  Their leader then ordered Amr to take off; at first Amr took
off under minimum thrust, but after a warning from Engineering that he was
dogging it, one of the Rye-Ben began to remove all the earwax from Amr\'s
left ear with the muzzle of his weapon, and Amr wised up.

	Back on the crew lounge of the Versailles, meanwhile, Kehaaarl and
Kurek noted the signal flashing on the departing ore hauler\'s lights.
Shortly thereafter, a heavily armed privateer lifted off, following it.
After some discussion, they contacted spaceport security, who informed them
that a hijacking was in progress.  Realizing that Amr had been gone for far
too long, they passed his description on to spaceport security, who
confirmed that Amr was indeed a hostage onboard.

	Meanwhile, onboard the ore hauler, Amr was antangonizing a bunch of
heavily armed terrorists when suddenly, the entire ship shook as a pulse
from a PA gun hit it, taking out its power plant and frying most of the
electronics onboard.  Curses, swearing, and confusion ensued, with Amr
trying to regain control of the vessel.  A second pulse hit.  Amr quickly
realized that the ore hauler had not yet achieved escape velocity, and
would begin to re-enter Mishegaan III\'s atmosphere in approximately 25
minutes.  Meanwhile, the terrorists ordered him to stay put as they exited
the bridge, dragging Dame Berek\'san with them and putting slaplocks across
the hatch once out so that Amr\'s only route out was though the bridge
airlock.

	Gathering his wits about him, Amr proceeded to the airlock;
thankfully, inside were two vac suits, two rescue bubbles, and two Personal
Re-Entry Kits.  He quickly suited up.  As his suit radio was incapable of
raising the starport, he hauled a rescue ball into the bridge and inflated
it, but quickly realized that he didn\'t have time to try and use its radio.
Firing up his hand comp and calculating trajectories, he realized with
horror that due to Mishegaan III\'s very thin atmosphere, he would not be
able to land using a PRK; the aerobraking and parachute wouldn\'t slow him
enough.  The only way down safely (and that term was to be used lightly)
was to take two PRK\'s; he would have to deorbit and do a long aerobrake
using the first kit, passing deep into Mishegaan III\'s atmosphere, and
travelling most of the way around the planet before re-exiting the
atmosphere briefly, changing PRK\'s with only two minutes worth of safety
margin, re-entering again, and landing using the PRK\'s de-orbit thruster.
He quickly strapped on the first PRK, tethered the second closely to him,
and jumped.  As he drifted away from the ore hauler, activating the PRK\'s
foam dispensers, he saw that the escape pods were gone and that the entire
aft section was blackened and slagged.  Then, several tens of kilometers
retrograde and down, he saw a series of bright flashes.

	Amr then began his de-orbit burn.  As he began to drop swiftly away
from the wrecked ore hauler, he was very conscious of the fact that on the
first aerobraking run, he would dip to within 6 kilometers of the
surface...  wracking his brains over what he\'d learned of Mishegaan\'s
geography, and hoping that his treajectory didn\'t take him through any
mountan ranges, he began re-entry.

	Some time later, the crew of the Versailles noted what appeared to
be a very bright meteor streaking by, upwards from the horizon, and
disappearing as it exited the atmosphere.  Shortly thereafter, as Amr
emerged from the plasma stream surrounding his PRK and began strapping on
the second one, he began hollering for help on his suit radio.  After a
brief exchange with the Versailles ("that was YOU?") had occurred, Perlis
quickly called spaceport control for permission to depart, which was
initially denied.  A brief discussion ensued, with the result that they
decided to ignore the departure ban.

	However, this rather unwise decision was quickly rendered moot by
the fact that spaceport control put out a general evacuation alarm; the
Rye-Ben Ling Must Eat Itself Front had tunneled under the spaceport tarmac
and emplaced a large fission device.  General panic ensued; however, as the
Versailles\' thrusters and power plant were already warmed up, they were
able to floor it out of there very quickly, boosting for a low,
forced-parabola trajectory at maximum thrust that would have them matching
speeds with Amr with about two minutes to spare before his second
atmosphere surfing run.

	As they took off, Lt. Kurek recalled that they had a nuclear
damper, with a 30,000 km range, on board.  He ran for the gun station.  In
the meantime, Elo began sensor scanning for the bomb... but his player
rolled a critical failure.  Mistakenly identifying an innocent Free
Trader\'s powerplant emissions as the bomb, he relayed the targeting
coordinates to Kurek, who locked on with the damper and shut down their
power plant just as they were lifting off; confusion, foul language, and
panic ensued on board that ship as it crunched back down rather heavily on
its landing legs.

	Shortly thereafter, Kurek realized that they\'d targeted some
no-doubt totally traumatized innocent cargo ship.  Elo began another scan
for the bomb, locating it in a tunnel right under the tarmac.  Kurek
quickly retargeted, damping the bomb (and those poor stressed-out bozos in
the Free Trader floored it out of there like bats out of hell).  However,
thirty seconds away from rendevous with Amr, he realized that the bomb was
about twelve seconds away from dropping out of his line of sight, at which
point he wouldn\'t be able to damp it anymore as the general unified
handwaving theory clearly states that dampers don\'t work very well through
kilometers of rock.  He informed Perlis, who initiated a radical course
change, swinging the Versailles into an upward trajectory that would keep
it above the spaceport\'s horizon.

	Amr\'s heart sank as he saw the blue glow of the Versailles\'
thrusters suddenly swing onto the new trajectory; when told why he
stoically braced himself for another hell-on-the-half-shell ride.  However,
the re-entry, parachute deployment, and studly use of the PRK\'s de-orbit
thruster to brake him to a halt a few meters above the surface, at which
point he jumped for it, all went smoothly.

	Meanwhile, back on the Versailles, Elo noted that the bomb\'s
detonator had just gone off, as the radiation from the bomb suddenly became
more intense, but diffuse, as the detonator blew the bomb apart but with
the damper preventing actual fission from taking place.  He informed Kurek,
who switched the damper off.  They went to pick up Amr.

	Glenn rolled two sixes and a five, almost making a critical
failure; it would have been extremely amusing to have Amr escape from
hijackers, surviving not one but two PRK re-entries, only to be squashed
flat by his own ship.  However, he didn\'t and Amr boarded, to be greeted by
a round of applause in the crew lounge.  Although almost in a state of
shock, he prescribed himself a stiff drink.  The Versailles lifted off
again, heading for the spaceport.

	However, upon arrival in the crater in which the spaceport and
Ling\'s mining colony were situated, they were greeted with a nuclear
fireball as a second nuke, emplaced in the mining colony, detonated;
shortly thereafter, the shock wave hit them.  The nuke destroyed the mining
colony outright and severely damaged several of the spaceport buildings.
This turn of events rather startled them, but ELo quickly began a sensor
sweep of the area.  He quickly turned up a platoon of starport security
troops hiding behind one of the less damaged buildings, pinned down by fire
coming from the fuel dump/refinery.

	After some discussion as to whether they wanted to actually kill
any more people than strictly neccessary, let alone blow the refinery
sky-high, they decided to approach around the crater, landing behind the
building, and pick up the security troops there.  This proceeded
flawlessly, fourteen Imperial troops  and two of their wounded comrades
boarding through a cargo hatch.  The Versailles then boosted for orbit.

	Discussion with the leader of the spaceport security team revealed
that the attack had come shortly before the nuke detonation, and that Sir
Lebar Eerht and Sir Loreni had last been seen in the concourse, where they
had been cut off by the fighting.

	Shortly thereafter, Elo detected a jump pulse; the vessel in
question turned out to be an Imperial courier.  Some minutes after its jump
in-system, the courier made a broad-band inquiry into what the hell was
going on and why weren\'t the spaceport and colony responding?  When
informed that there was something of a revolution going on and that nukes
had been used, there was some consternation aboard the courier.  However,
they then proceeded to announce in the name of his Imperial Majesty, the
Interdict on the nearby cluster was immediately lifted.

	This news was rather displeasing to the Versailles; not only did
they not have a cargo, but their captain was back down on the ground in the
middle of an ongoing war.  Discussion ensued, and transfer of the troops
onto one of the Imperial vessels that had just arrived was negotiated.  The
fact that there was an armed privateer that had apparently callously shot
down the ore hauler and killing Dame Berek\'san was passed on to the
authorities.  However, the privateer\'s credentials proved to be in order.
And we called it there.  More in two weeks!

Owning property and living in a suitably grand manner were essential roles
for European Nobility. In the "estates" formulation typical of a stratified
and hierarchical feudal state, the noble serves the very functional role of
"economic driving force". In a pre-Industrial society, the noble\'s
lifestyle in essence drove economic production, and developing land for
some practical economic use was an important responsibility of the
Nobility. Warfare also placed a significant demand (without a doubt, the
most significant demand) on a nobleman\'s resources, and he was also
doubtless the most important consumer of luxury goods in any realm.

If this is to be translated to Traveller terms, then first it should be
decided what function the Nobility serves in the Imperium. Is it a largely
symbolic function? (which the aristocracy increasingly became in
Industrialized countries on our world) Or does it play a larger roll in the
economic function of the Empire. If the former is the case, then Noble
holdings could be quite small, largely irrelevant in land terms, and likely
mostly tied up in business investments and a few luxury items (perhaps a
few ships culled from this month\'s THUDDD...) :) If, on the other hand, the
Nobility plays a significant role in the Imperial economy, then noble
landholdings should be significant, and a noble\'s goals would be
conceptually similar to their medieval counterparts. They would seek to
develop and add value to the lands granted them, both in an effort to
improve their financial situation, and also to increase their status at
court. Presumably, this "kind" of noble would play a significant role in
Imperial affairs, and more powerful nobleman would control not only large
chunks of the Imperium, but also the attendant military presence in a given
region. This would mean that resources were not always used in a manner
that always best suited the purposes of the Imperium at large.

Also, it should be noted that if a comparison with historical Nobility is
to be made, then a given level of power would not always be directly
related to a given title. European history in the feudal era is rife with
examples of the highest raking nobles (A King) requiring the support of
lower ranking nobleman (A Duke, perhaps)--who sometimes possessed greater
military power--in order for the region to maintain solvency.

In Traveller terms, perhaps this means that, for example, The Duke of
Regina, who defends the very edge of the Imperium by holding sway over a
significant military forces given his noble station, also holds sway over a
disproportionate say in the political affairs of the Spinward Marches. In
fact, perhaps the region\'s stability depends on his cooperation more than
any of the other Dukes in the region, and as such his word carries greater
weight in the Emperor\'s eyes. This sort of assumption is valid all the way
through the noble hierarchy, such that it is impossible to say that x noble
of a certain rank should control y resouces and have z influence at the
Imperial court.

Charts and detailed calculations concerning noble holdings shouldn\'t be so
arbitrary, since this doesn\'t really represent what is in essence a far
more fluid social structure than it initially appears to be on the surface.
There should be instances where a title doesn\'t always represent the same
level of power. And for ease of role-playing, for individual PCs this
should be resolved on a case by case basis, perhaps using general
guidelines, but not simply resorting to consulting a few charts. Each noble
should be unique, since if they are carbon cut-outs with arbitrary levels
of power, then their whole purpose and funtion in the game--to provide a
varied and complex political background for an interstellar Empire with an
old-fashioned feudal structure underneath all that tech--is lost.

It\'s also possible that by very careful observation after jumping into
an "empty" hex you could find a comet or even a "small" moon made of
ice. Refine the fuel on the spot.

It\'d take a *long* time to use up even a comet (say 10km) much less a

Whoa!

Doug, I usually agree with you and in *general* I do on the above
paragraph, but...;->

Let\'s be very clear on the difference in "demand recognition for" and
present as an alternative.  I agree that those of us that use alternative
tech/backgrounds/rules shouldn\'t try to codify our alternatives into
official Traveller lore.  I also believe, and I hope you agree with me,
that we should be allowed (even encouraged) to post our ideas, alternatives
and speculations to the list.

For instance, I\'d like to see your notes on the Reformed Catholic Empire. 
It\'s not official?  No, but so what. a good story, is a good story.  ;->

Well, actually that\'s not completely true. There are free services 
available that send you the webpages you ask for by mail. The one I 
occasionally use doesn\'t handle frames or any other new-fangled stuff, 
but if it looks okay on Lynx, it looks okay in mail.

To try it out, send a message to www@kfs.org with the urls you want in 
the body of the mail.

	I like the SDB: it\'d be fun to do something low-tech for once, and
we always seem to get more entries if it involves something armed :).

Please, please, please! No Book per Career!!  I hate it when games
companies do that.  Witness TSR\'s huge assortment of class-type books
filled with useless drivel and bad artwork.  "The AD&D Guide to
Left-handed Half-Elven Rangers with Huge Cat familiars."  Please, god,
no!

Better is books on certain topics that may interest/affect multiple
character types.  Business: Merchants, Rogues, Nobles, Agents
(industrial espionage), Entertainers (consider the size of the
entertainment industry);
Exploration: Scouts, Scholars, Agents, misc.
Large-scale combat (Space and Ground): Navy, Army, Marines, Scouts.

[snip]

> "Megacorporations" for the Merchant
> "Syndicates" for the Rogue

These should be one book.

On Scholars, Entertainers and Agents:  the first two certainly don\'t
merit their own books, but Agent is a catch-all that could be/should be
in most all of the other subject areas.

However, I would support a large number of books, if they were *Small*
and *cheap*.
Talking $12 a book per career at most.

I\'ll leave it to those with broader CT/MT collections to inform us if
deep-space refuelling stations were ever mentioned before TNE.

Craig,

Arrival Vengeance had deep space refueling in it, and I\'ve always inferred
that the Imperial Naval Couriers bypass Corridor from the MT source
material. (Hence Norris\' advance warning of Strephon\'s death.

Bruce,

I\'ve only done it in High Guard, but the costs to maintain large capacities
of fuel in deep space are expensive. I looked at supporting a CruRon (4 x
75kdt cruisers at J4 capacity) for J2 stand off raids (yes, I use jump
governers in my games), and you needed a 400,000 te tanker (albeit at TL12)
to do so. I would think that the costs of such bases would be expensive
even for a MegaCorp.

For the military and their \'Nemesis\' cruisers it\'s a different matter!

This one makes most sense to me. But any Masq M-O benefits are "illegitimate"
(that is to say, they cannot be enforced or fully documented if questioned).
So the character might have TAS, but if it were questioned someone might find
irregularities. Noble lands would be ultimately founded on defective papers,
etc. A ship would be in his hands and being used, but the papers and
ownership are ultimately defective. All this traces back to the Masquerade.

The biggest difference other than the mechanics was the abandonment of

Your interpretation is correct. You get one level of automatic skill upon
enlistment, not every term.

similarly, you get 1 level when commissioned or when promoted, not every
term.

Based on the automatic eligibilities, the norm is 1 skill per year (4 per
term) (from the tables) and probably 1 automatic skill per term (from
enlisting, being commissioned, promoted as an officer, etc). or about 1.25
skills per year overall.

My take on experience (and I want to revise it to this) is that after
character generation and while role-playing a character receives 1 new skill
on his birthday, and 1 new skill (in addition) every 4 years. See my previous
post on experience.

But that means that in those careers with ranks, everyone gets +1 skill for
showing up, and +1 skill for enlisted promotion (+4 in the first term).

Everyone gets promoted as enlisted; its automatic. Giving a skill for that
really inflates skill levels.

Life isn\'t fair. Some people get more from their background than others.
That\'s why we also allow the player to decide his/her homeworld is different

   have almost the same EDU. I think EDU should be used as learning
   ability, so e.g., University shoold only give +1 to EDU.

I have tweaked the prerequisites for Edu to make it harder to get. But if you
go to University, you probably get a basic level of Edu. Honors get\'s you a
little more.

Terms are still the breakpoint.

commission.

 - How is honors determined in quick system?

The player/referee decides ("This guy has honors from University")

 - Please add more careers, from CT, MT (+COACC), Challenge, TNE(?),
   PE, TML...

Maybe at some future time.

 - It only specified in Eneri example, that character may have any
   education before he has to join Army/Navy, if he took (N)OTC.

That example has changed numerous times. In the current iteration, he has
joined the Army (via OTC).

 (extract) 5. Degree: Eneri does not meet the Int prerequisite for
University; he applies for a waiver, rolls 7, and the prerequisite is waived.
He applies at the University and is accepted. He perseveres but does not
achieve honors. He rolls twice for skill and receives Biology-2. He then
selects a major of Social Science (Archeology) and graduates with a BS and
Archeology-2, and Edu stays at 7.
	He also enrolls in OTC and receives Admin-1 (Bureaucracy) and Tactics-1 (he
must join the Army when he finishes his education).
	Eneri applies for Grad School, is accepted and perseveres, but again does
not receive honors. He continues his major (Social Science /Archeology),
takes Archeology-2, advances to Edu 8, and receives an MS.

 - How about giving bonus to promotion roll, if it failed last term? 50 year
old lieutenants are silly.

I think they are too. In the 1880\'s the US Army had quite a few (no wars, no
promotion, etc). Silly yes. Possible yes. If that happens to you, what
explanation do you create for the character: persecution, discrimination?
incompetence? lack of ambition?

 - I think skill increases should decrease in later terms as in TNE.
Otherwise, it\'s possible to create too skilled characters.

You just said you are giving your character +1 skill per term for a hobby
skill. I would delete that first.

 - Pension should more depend on career and rank.

Pension is for some slight cash flow for characters. I wanted to avoid
creating actuarially correct 401(k) plans for each career.

 - Skill-10:s are too much.

A. See the discussion of skill versus characteristics.
B. Skill-10 represents a singleminded pursuit of a specific area of knowledge
(to the exclusion of almost all else) for 10 years. 

 - Changing careers should be allowed, people do it all time.

Then jury is still out on this one. Some people want to change careers every
term (or every year). I have to say that this system let\'s you change
careers... when you muster ouyt and start adventuring, you have just changed
careers.

 - If character\'s are generated completely randomly, characters (especially
young) do not get skills that they\'d supposedly get in basic training... All
marines get Cutlass, but they might not get Gun Combat? And not even Env
Cbt-0?

I had basic training. It didn\'t teach me hand-to-hand or gun combat. Some
people come out of their career with a lasting knowledge of some areas, and
not in others.

 - Is there any good reason to rename many skills (hmmm, I recognize  many
from CT/MT...)?

Yes. We renamed Charisma to Interact. There were reasons for other renamings.

Mr. Berry, what is wrong in not being prepared for something that I
didn\'t even expect, let alone along with the way that I was misinterpreted?
It took me a few weeks of introspection, along with some offline chats
well after the whole episode, to figure out the underlying autonomous
response I had to all of this.  Even when Mark Clark had hinted at the
notion that we don\'t all think alike, it didn\'t immediately figure in.

I am (was) so used to thinking about Traveller one way, and TML does it
a far different way. That\'s all.  No biggie, I am learning about TML\'s
way, but I see nothing so superior about it that I will give up my way.
That\'s fair, because I am _not_ asking anyone to give up their way.

If they want to learn from what I had (have) to say, so be it.  If they
don\'t, that is fine too.  Don\'t hate me for it.

>We took your evidence and refuted it point-for-point.  That\'s not a
>difference of opinion, that\'s using what you had to show your mistakes.

Yet when I didn\'t see the interpretations of the rules that you cited,
that makes me wrong.  Nice (double) standard there.

Tell you what, I\'ve been thinking about taking some questions to you
offline about terraforming (because terraforming rules was not what
I was interested in discussing), since you say that you have been
using WBH for 10 years or so.  Would you care to put "list presence" and
ego aside, and have that discussion?

First off, all of these things I said that you all have been fond of quoting
have never been tempered with the proper context.  I placed it in the frame
of "having an open mind."  If I had said "proof of a high tech RoM" then
all of this category of response to what I said would be acceptable.

No matter how many people wrongly think I said something, doesn\'t put the
words (meaning) into my mouth.

That doesn\'t prevent the referee and players from knowing about it.

I really shouldn\'t write when I\'m that tired.  I objected to Leroy\'s
declaration that what he had was canon.  I have no problem with divergent
or alternate settings, but for purpose of discussion here, we need to have
a common ground.  We have overturned pieces of canon.. remember the fighter
debate?  

I love seeing peoples\' ideas and settings, reading the adventure logs, and
grabbing THUDDD designs.  What I object to is anyone other than Marc Miller
attempting to define what Traveller is for me, and even then I might not
listen to Marc!

	IIRC, it wasn\'t that the plane wouldn\'t let the pilot pull the nose out of
the trees. It was that the pilot was flying too slow, and couldn\'t.
Although the digital flight control system was built to automatically
respond to imminent stall (too slow), the pilot was flying too low. And
since landing is basically an imminent stall at low altitudes, the FCS
assumed the pilot knew what he was doing, and didn\'t intervene. Meanwhile,
the pilot "knew" the FCS would keep him out of trouble, so he pushed the
envelope.

	Shows what happens when _any_ user relies on an automated system with less
than full understanding of how it\'s designed.

Here\'s a nice old one, from Alien Module 6 - Solomani:

  "The range of the jump-1 drives first developed by UNSCA was 
insufficient to reach the nearest star - Alpha Centauri. It took 
several years before a US Space Force team based on Luna tried a 
mission which, in several trips, established an intermediate 
stopover and refuelling point about one parsec out. For various 
scientific reasons, the mission was to Barnard\'s star..."

And the rest is history, as they say.

Hi Anders!

The information is publicly available, and was published in an American
Physics Journal (Physics Today, I think).  It was in late 1995 or early
1996.  As I remember it, there were no phase speed or interference
effects
discussed, although at the conference I mentioned, several of the
physicists debated whether you could call the 40th symphony a true
"signal"
(since we already "know" its content before it arrives.)  In any case,
the tunneling effect was the real important key, but I haven\'t heard any
follow-up information on it at all since then.  

Please, please don\'t feel like I was at all upset with your posting!
I\'ve just heard the phase speed argument so many times that I wanted
to emphasize that this is probably not what you were thinking about. 
But
even if I have given you the correct reference, there is absolutely no
need to apologize to anyone.  Especially me! I\'m actually quite elated 
to be able to discuss and debate these issues with well-informed, 
technically proficient people.  I\'ll try to find the exact reference 
and get back to you, as I regret I was unable to keep the actual 
article.

	In fact, according to the CT Solomani Alien Module, this is 
precisely how the J-1 Terrans made their J-2 journey to Barnard -- deep

Hang on, didn\'t somebody already right that, about a Vilani who replaced

You have to distinguish between two types of CPs (I\'ll use the TNE
abbreviation for convenience): internal and external.

Internal CPs are of the type you posit above.  They are used to make
transportation inside an empire easier, and aren\'t very vulnerable to
attack.  However, they also aren\'t very useful in launching an attack,
other than making it possible to get all your assets to one spot on your
border somewhat more quickly.  A good analogy here is the US interstate
freeway system, which was actually sold to Congress partly in terms of its
military-deployment advantages.

External CPs are placed outside the empire, and are used to launch deeper
attacks into enemy space.  These are the type your original PE question
seemed to address.  If kept secret, they can be devestatingly effective; 
what\'s more, the simple *possibility* of their existence forces your
opponent -- and you -- to approach defense much more conservatively, which
in turn can limit the ability to attack.  However, if the enemy does find
your CP, it\'s a small, high-value, and isolated target; and so much the
more if it\'s early in a *chain* of CPs.

Actually, the Solomani ran into the Vilani practically as soon as they
left Sol System.  However, the circumstances you describe might well have
occurred elsewhere.

That\'s almost certainly the wrong way to do it.  Interstellar space is
peppered with small, icey bodies, which would be comets if they ever
happened to fall near a star.  Each contains a bazillion tons of water,
methane, ammonia, and other hydrogen-rich ices.  Thus, it makes enormously
better sense to land a refinery on such a body and produce fuel in situ.
Even when this body is tapped out (not likely within a century or so), you
just move the whole operation to another similar body, one of which is
sure to exist within 100 AU or so.

A sight many of us have imagined. :)  David Brin\'s "Uplift" series of
novels includes this idea, by the way.

You\'ve spotted the same pattern I did. :)  However, there is one further
oddity -- though the current (yacht) THUDDD attracted fewer entries than
any previous one, it\'s also drawing more voters by a wide margin than the
previous (exploratory trader) THUDDD.  Still not sure what this is telling
us...

depots to j3 or so apart. With no income generated by local exports to help
defray the operational costs, who ever runs them will have to either raise
prices on what will be purely pass thru traffic, or will have to have really
deep pockets lined from some other source. 

Military opertions don\'t have to show a profit, so a government supported
Naval depots every 3 parsecs or so across the Great Rift to shorten response
time between the Imperium and the Spinward Marches makes sense. How many
Naval bases allow civilian freighters to tank up on Naval fuel reserves just
so the civilian could take a short cut?

One contributing reason as to why Mains of J1 routes are still profitable in
a J6 world is that you can carry more salable cargo on a J1 ship than on a
J6 ship. Doesn\'t Pocket Empires have a declining value to trade the further
the trade has to travel? I know PE says that the trade tables are good up to
about 80 worlds, but I didn\'t mark the section of effects of distance on

	I\'ve always felt the opposite; I dislike, hell, I hate the TNE

method is much better.  I think that the Injury gives a unique
opportunity to flesh out a character in interesting ways.  4.1 does this

by awarding medals.  But I wanted a little more.  So, I made up
something with the help of my brother.

I think a list of possibilities from failed injury rolls would be
interesting.  Say a Injury Results table for each career with Prison/POW

and physical injury on each.  Others: Merchant goes bankrupt, Noble is
revealed as a Bastard (What do you call an illegitmate female?),
Entertainer involved in Scandal, Scout gets lost, Military gets
*de*-moted, Scholar gets proven wrong, Agent gets cover blown or too
popular to do job, Rogue\'s masquerade gets revealed, etc.  Some injuries

force you to muster-out, some don\'t.  Some are physical injuries, some
are financial/professional/etc.


Here\'s the story on  what we made:  Prisoner/POW.

Rogues who fail to pass an injury roll go to Prison.  Yes, Prison.  But
isn\'t prison dangerous?  Exactly!  Might a PC learn some dangerous
skills in prison?  Exactly!

We expanded the basic idea of a prison for criminals into one that
includes prisoners of war (both captured military and civilians caught
behind lines for espionage, etc. - its a 10- roll that military become
POWs and Civilians become criminal prisoners - failure means a military
person in the stockade or civilian in POW camp).

Prisoners have to make an injury roll for physical injury (no medals or
anything else - like being sent to prison from prison - available).

Instead of commission/promotion, there is Escape/Exhonerated,
the former for POWs, the latter for criminals.  Then roll one-die to
determine which year this happens.  For civilians, the character has
been completely vindicated (although I should probably allow a
a civilian to escape, too, but of course, they would be wanted ;-).
POWs return to safe lines.  There are DMs for Soc, Military Rank,
and prison terms served.  This roll is optional.  (Some people like to
stay in prison ;-)

Next come the skills and benefits.  All civilian prisoners suffer
immediate -2 Soc but gain Streetwise-2 automatically.  All POWs and
prisoners get 1 skill/year; POWs get +1 skill/term because of the more
structured envirionment.  Military career PCs terms count towards
mustering out.

Finally, instead of continuance is Parole/Release.  This has a DM for
terms served.  (I may add one for Law skill).  The criminal prisoner has

a record but has served his time.  The POW has either been traded in a
prisoner swap or the war is over.  The PC then returns to the previous
career.  There are no mustering out rolls at all.

Overall, I like it but it needs some tweaking.  The Parole/Release roll
isn\'t hard so most characters don\'t spend more than one term in prison.
I\'ve assumed for playability\'s sake that the crimes committed for
civilian prisoners are not serious enough to warrant death or long-term
committment.

Perhaps I should post it here??  I could put it on my webpage, but
that\'ll take a few days.  Of course, I can email it on request.

Just some ideas and I welcome your comments.

Yes, there will be a niche for bounty hunting. I would 
think the Imperium as the Metropole would establish that a duely

Though, even with a valid "Hunting License" the party in question, 
would be limited to sidearm, and be libel for the the misuse of such.
( Read reasonable use of force )
The method for the issuing of a warrent probally the "world where the
crime took place would, request that the MOJ to issue a warrent. The MoJ 
would judge the merrit of the request and act accordingly.

Probably not, just Imp. Licensed acting on a MoJ Warrent. A non-Licensed
Hunter would tread all over the member worlds soverinty. Out side the
Imperium this would not be a problem, inside one big hassle.

No, a bounty would apply to any person who captures said fugitives.

Yes a Imperial License would allow more lattude in such things
as weapon restrictions. And give the holder a legal standing, in cases
were the local goverment were to become involved. (As I said before
reasonable force, as for being a law student anyone who is involved
in Law Enforcment has had this beat in to their heads)

Yes, the exception proves the rule. ( Also read, Goddamned Spooks )

I would add kidnapping, Murder, and certain Grand Larceny Crimes.

It tells you nothing about the *plot*, so it\'s not a spoiler. If I\'d 
said, "Ivanova dies in the last ep of season 4[1]," *that* would be a 
spoiler. The character could be recast.

If I\'d announced CC\'s *death*, would that be a spoiler?


[1] I made that up, BTW. I\'ve only seen up to 401.

How big is the European market compared to the US one? It may be worth the 
expense. Alternatively, let groups like BITS do the work for you.

Basically, CC wanted 4 eps off during Season 5, so she could make a film. 
Exactly what happened next depends on who you ask, but basically the two 
parties failed to come to an agreement, and the deadline for her signing on is 
now past. JMS blames her, she blames the studio. Either way, a new character 
is being brought in to replace Ivanova for at least the first few episodes 
(they have to be written *now*), and probably the entire season.

(Institutes) has some very nice examples, which really bring the earlier
rules material to life.  My personal favourite is the Ladies\' Homemaker
Society - wonderful name!  Unfortunately, there are quite a few typos in
the Institutes\' stats - mostly in the UIDs - and the format is not
consistent, which makes the chapter less useful for reference.

Here\'s a checklist for Institute generation, including a few ideas of my
own.  New or modified stages are marked with a *.  As always, GM fiat
should be used instead of random rolls whenever desired.

All comments welcome.


WORLD DETERMINATION:

 1.   Pick a world, or roll up a UWP.

 2.   Roll for UAP (pp.15-16).

*3.   If Pocket Empires is available, determine Plurality of Opinion:

        (2D + Unity - Self-Determination) / 2

      [This gives a result of -4 to 15, mode 4.5 - if you want to record
       this as a digit, an alternative is to add 4 to this number and
       make it 0-19 (0-K) instead.  Obviously the table values would
       need adjusting, too.]

        < 0: Almost everybody agrees with the UAP.
        0-2: There are a number of minority groups with differing
             opinions, but they have little influence or popular
             support.
        3-6: Different pressure groups represent a wide range of
             opinions.
        7-9: The population is severely divided on the issue of
             Psionics.
        10+: There is almost no agreement.  The UAP represents at best
             an average, but is likely to vary depending on the survey
             methods used.

*4.   Roll for presence of Psionic Institutes (p.17).  Note the margin
      of success for each type found to exist (for example, rolling 3
      against a target number of 5 yields a margin of 2).

*5.   Determine the number of Institutes.  For each type of Institute
      represented on the world, roll 2D and add the margin:

           -7:  1 Institute.
         8-12:  2 Institutes.
        13-15:  1D+1 Institutes.
        16-19:  1D+2 Institutes.
          20+:  2D+1 Institutes

      [This is a bit too complicated.  Anyone with a better suggestion?]


INSTITUTE DETERMINATION:

 6.   Generate the UID and Specials (pp.18-20):

   a. Student Population Digit (SP, p.18).

   b. Student to Instructor Rating (IR, p.18).

   c. Amenities Rating (AM, p.18).

   d. Overall Quality (QI, p.19).

*  e. Special Ability.  Roll 2D.  On a 12, the Institute teaches a
      special ability - roll on the Special Ability Matrix (p.22) to
      determine which.

*  f. Number of Departments (ND, p.19).  If the Institute teaches a
      Special Ability, a roll of 0 or less means it is the only ability
      taught.  Otherwise, follow the normal rules.

   g. Quality of Individual Departments (p.19).  Don\'t forget the
      Special Ability Department if one exists.

 7.   Roll for tuition cost (p.21).

*8.   Determine number of campuses.  Look up the appropriate type and
      SP, and roll 2D.  A roll of equal to or lower than the number on
      the matrix indicates more than one campus. A "----" indicates
      combinations that don\'t exist, or that are always confined to a
      single campus.

        Type/SP Matrix:
             SP0  SP1  SP2  SP3  SP4  SP5  SP6
        ----
         CI  ----   6-   7-   8-   9-  10-  11-
         EI  ----  ----   2-   3-   4-   5-   6-
         GI  ----   3-   4-   5-   6-   7-   8-
         SS  ----   4-   5-   6-   7-  ----  ----

      If more than one campus is found to exist, add 1D to the amount by     
      which the roll succeeded:

          1-4:  2 campuses.
          5-6:  1D+1 campuses.
          7-8:  1D+2 campuses.
         9-10:  2D+1 campuses.
        11-13:  1D*5 campuses.
        14-15:  2D*5 campuses.

      [Again, this is a bit too complicated.  Any better ideas?]

 9.   Write Institute History.  GM creativity required.

10.   Write Institute Physical Description.  GM creativity required.

11.   Determine Notable Faculty Members.  GM creativity required.

Book 8: Robots, also made clear some of the emerging assumptions about
computer power for MT. A TL 12 computer is capable of QUITE a bit of
processing power. I once sat down and figured out just how much was in a
model 1, 2, and 3... and they all came out with at least low autonomous,
and were capable of understanding spoken word at TL 9+.

We aren\'t as strong a lobby as we once were. Truth be told, I am a

leave the Timeline intact, even though it %&*^ed up the 3I. T4, however, is
changing the background, slowly now, but it seems to me, at an ever
increasing pace... it should become freed of the baggage to develop how it
wants to, and to shut us cannonists up... ;-)

Bring it up to 1000 tons.  That should give us a wide variety of designs.
Also, think about a price cap for the entire system; we\'ed might work
smarter if faced with a budget.

mean not valid?!  He WALKED ON THE GRASS!!!  That\'s a major FELONY here!!"

Picture what would happen at the other end of things also.. "He\'s wanted

you for kidnapping!  I don\'t care about your Imperial Bounty Hunter
License, this isn\'t the starport, you follow *our* laws here!"

Once again, if the Imperium is licensing these guys, they are basically
saying "go forth, and do what you have to."

In NA, bounty hunters are private citizens who usually work for bail
bondsmen.  They are not licensed, nor do they have any authority beyond
that of a private citizen.  They simply have the skills to track down bail
jumpers.

In the Imperium, a local jurisdiction might publish a wanted list as a
matter of public record, complete with rewards offered.  A bounty hunter
would then be on his own tracking down the fugitive.  If the bounty hunter
breaks the law on whatever planet he\'s on, he may find himself being hunted.

For Imperial fugitives, the Navy/scouts would be able to control the choke
points (starports) fairly well.  They just inform the locals that fritz the

Exactly.  If Fred the Pirate attempts to hijack me, and I knock him cold,

But Imperial authority doesn\'t go past the starport gate.  Much in the same
way the FBI has to be invited to take part in most cases, the Imperium
cannot run roughshod over its allegedily sovergn members.

(1) Since thruster plates wor very poorly outside a solar system, they\'re
somewhat inefficient to assemble and use; it will typically take a couple
of days for a ship to rendezvou with one once it comes out of jump.

(2) Like most fixed installations, they\'re fairly vulnerable, especially
to hypervelocity missile attacks; if your enemy knows where they are,
they\'re dead.

The exception to both these are stations built on a pre-existxing planetoid
or (most desirable) free planet, which is why such things are so valuable...

AN interesting way to get perspective on such things is to toss them into
FFW as a variant - give each side one or two (set up completely hidden)
which can refuel (say) 2 squadrons, and can themselves be refuelled by a tanker,
but are destroyed by any enemy unit in the same hex.

hehe....  that reminds me of a side plot to a campaign of mine that I
pulled to give me time to set up the next part of the "script."  I had
one of my PC\'s captured by a bounty hunter.. "damn... Rory didn\'t show
up for breakfast this morning... anybody seen him???   Yeah... He as on
his way back to the hotel at about 2AM this morning from that bar we
were in last night... haven\'t seen him since." 

It was, on the bounty hunter\'s part, a case of mistaken identity. 
However, this did not matter as will become clear later in this story. 

The PC party then went through the drill of figuring out what happened
to their freind and then chasing the bounty hunter and their friend
through 4 parsecs of space (maybe more, this was 12 years ago) to rescue
him.  

The Prosecutor on the world that their freind was taken to was in
political hot water and needed a sensational conviction of a criminal to
divert attention from a scandal he was facing.  The hapless PC was
railroaded through the planet\'s "justice system" and found guilty even
though he was the wrong guy, had never been to that planet before, the
evidence was shoddy, etc. etc. etc.

The PC party ended up staging a jail breakout of their freind and
hauling tail off the planet with the planetary Navy\'s system defense
force hot on their tails. (Shades of Han Solo and "The Millenium Falcon"
episodes on Star Wars)   

As a result they all now truly fugitives from justice as a result of
this side adventure.  Eventually within the campaign I contrived a way
for them to clear their names, though I don\'t remember how.

	Hm what about designing a SDB/battle-tender or a fighter/carrier
	combination. A SDB does\'nt make much sense without a tender.

	So they\'ll set a price limit for a fleet of BT/SDB\'s lets
	say they want a BT/Ron for 4000 MCr (Tl10) with minimum
	local production (ship yard subvention) of 80%. The contest
	is public and Imperial companies try to design fleets
	to increase export by 800 MCr ! But of course these designs
	have to match ISBA (isba@goldinc.com) Class I equipment
	export restrictions.

	What do others think about designing a fleet with :

	Local production: 80% TL 10 components

	Imported Imperial class I equipment : Turret and barrbet lasers,
	   military controll systems, non meson comuncation systems,
	   sandcasters, sensors. (TL12)

	Imported TL11 equipment: MDF, missiles, bay weapons, spinal
	  mount weapons, stelth, EMM.

	For a complete price of 5000 MCr dividet into :

	3200 MCr local production
	 800 MCr imported technology
	1000 MCr investment for bringing local production partly
		 to TL11 for jump drive and thusterplate production.

	This fleet THUDDD would need 2 ballots :

	- Buyers vote : The PEs military has to decide which company
	  should build the fleet.
	- Senates vote : Imperial senate has a veto as the PE is only
	  ~20-50 parsecs away (do we have a canon M0/TL10 PE ?).

	IMHO THUDDD should swith between civilian and military ships.
	(the even and odd the THUDDD ;-) Last time we had the Yacht
	(civilian) next THUDDD should be a military ship and the
	Lab Ship afterwards.

Saddly, my nearly complete set of CT books went into storage several
years ago, when I was relocated temporarily. When I got back to them
water had leaked into the storage unit and that, plus 2-3 boxes of
classic sci-fi, were the victims 8^<. The storage company made
settlement and I managed to carefully recover some of them. Robots was
not among the survivors, and I only vaguely remember it.

I have just started to read (rather than skim) Central Supply Catalog. I
see it mentions a companion bot, and some computer design information.
Maybe I\'ll have enough (sigh! is there ever?) time to finish reading
that and see what kind of equiptment can be designed from that book.
From some of the comments that I\'ve seen on the list though, I\'m not
sure...

I\'ll get to it, just as soon as I finish these 500 ton freighter deck
plans I\'ve been working on for the last 3 weeks...

   One would think that with a last name like Berry, you\'d want to

Sounds great. Offhand, I\'d say it might be nice to have a little more room
at the low end. Perhaps anywhere from 200-800 tons. Some planets may not
want to put all their eggs in one big basket, so to speak. 400 tons seems
an ideal size for an SDB, at least to me.

A fellow list member mentioned that there was no tech level chart with
examples of what is possible in all the various technological fields at a
given tech level in the T4 rulebook. I remember this being a very useful
reference in the old CT rulebook (It was in Book 1, and in subsequent
versions of the CT rules). Has it been put in any of the new supplements
put out by Imperium Games (I don\'t have very many of them), and if not, why
not.

For those new to Traveller, it would give a very good idea of relative
tech, and it would be unfortunate if it was left out of whatever revised
edition is currently in the works.

I always thought that this was an American thing, because the New 
Zealand Army only has automatic promotion (barring a stuffup) to 
major, with all promotions after that by merit. IIRC this is based on 
the British Army\'s system, so they\'re probably similar.

We New Zealanders have always found the US NCO rank system strange 
(most of my army military friends would say stupid), because we don\'t 
have automatic promotions for enlisted ranks at all.

I have a friend in the British Army. He\'s either late in his \'second term\' 
or early in his third, and he\'s only a L/Cpl, and he doesn\'t consider that 
particularly unusual.

I agree, but I think 1 free promotion/year is excessive.

I\'d like to see the upper limit set at a good round 1000 tons; at lower
tech levels, the most mundane things take up incredible amounts of room.
You design too much stuff at TL12+ and you get spoiled -- you forget
what an utter godsend thrust plates and (slightly) more efficient power
plants are...

Additionally, I\'d like to see a set of design requirements somewhat more
specific than \'system defence boat.\' That covers an extraordinarily
broad array of roles. What does the client want? Are we building it for
the Emperor so he can arm his client states? or are we just putting
together a representative sample of what a typical low-tech pocket
empire might be able to field? Is it to be a purely military craft,
designed to stave off full-blown planetary invasions (read: Missile
Boat)? or will it also be called upon to perform various law-enforcement
duties: chasing smugglers & the like? I don\'t want to build just a
stereotypical ho-hum budget non-jump-capable warship... I like seeing
how big a gun I can pack into how small a package; and at lower tech
levels, that\'s a REAL challenge....

One last thing: what design system are we using? and can we mix & match
now that QSDS is un-broken (design a QSDS hull, then drop
FF&S-spreadsheet-designed/converted weapons in it: things like that)?
The last THUDDD I participated in was the scout/survey vessel. I tried
to design it employing SSDS, and worked myself into such a blathering
rage trying to figure out the crew complement that I almost didn\'t make
it.... Never Again... 

Or are we waiting for FF&S 2?

I *really want* T4 to be Traveller.

IMHO, what we need ASAP is a M0 edition of the Imperial Encyclopedia. 
This would be a vital aid to consistency for both new players/refs *and 
new writers.*

The character receives skills for every year up to (and including?) the 
injury.

CT had a book for most careers, and that worked pretty well.

An updated Mercenary/Striker would be nice, with TO&E for different 
cultures and TLs (what is standard equipment for an Imperial Marine? 
What is a TL4 army likely to be armed with?) and a mass combat system.

But why would anyone *not* want to go? Officers get an extra m/o roll and an 
extra skill per term.

I\'d make the roll harder but the DMs better.

Giving enlisted characters about a million skills in the first term.

At least in T4.1, Ship/Fleet Tactics is available for Navy characters.

CT Supplement 8, Library Data (A-M) (GDW 1981) gives a map of the whole
region surrounding the Imperium, an area 16 sectors across by 8 sectors
down.  I presume that thuis is the map you have.  The Atlas of the
Imperium (GDW 1984) gives the names of 35 sectors in a grid 7 across by
5 down.  The Rebellion Sourcebook (GDW 1988) gives these names with two
extra rows one at the top and one at the bottom.  The first row only has
the right hand three sectors named (the map title covers the left
four).  Starting from the top the names given are:

1.?,  ?,  ?,  ?,  Meshan,  Mendan,  Amdukan
2. Spinward Marches,  Deneb,  Corridor,  Vland,  Lishun,  Antares, 
Empty Quarter
3. Trojan Reach,  Reft Sector,  Gushemege,  Dagudashag,  Core, 
Fornast,  Ley Sector
4. Riftspan Reaches,  Verge,  Ilelish,  Zarushagar,  Massilia,  Delphi, 
Glimmerdrift Reaches
5. Hlakhoi,  Ealiyasiyw,  Reaver\'s Deep,  Daibei,  Diaspora,  Old
Expanses,  Hinterworlds
6. Staihaia\'yo,  Iwahfuah,  Dark Nebula,  Magyar,  Solomani Rim,  Alpha
Crucis,  Spica
7. Aktifao,  Uistilao,  Ustral Quadrant,  Canopus,  Aldebaran, 
Neworld,  Langere

I know that there are more sectors that have been named (the alien
modules generally have further sectors named) but these are the ones to
which I have instant access, e.g. Vanguard Reaches and The Beyond are
the two to the left of Trojan Reach (line 3 above should start VR,  TB, 
TR).

Subsector names are more difficult to track down but it is possible
through the DGP info.  I will try and come back in a few days.


Hope this has been of help

I agree that every character should be unique as well. Not all nobles have
property, and the MO tables will reflect that. In fact, in the Imperium, not
all nobles are rich (or filthy rich) or even hold any reasonable power. The
purpose of the chargen and MO tables is to provide some information by which
a character can be fleshed out by the ref and the player.

rates are about:

	95% from O1 to O2 
	90% from O2 to O3 
	70% from O3 to O4.

These figures are approximate.  I\'ll look up the actual numbers
if anyone is interested.

There are also no automatic enlisted promotions.  Promotion 
rates are about 95% from E1 to E2 to E3 and it drops off 
from there.

Since Congress won\'t allow us to cut bases and infrastructure, 
we are cutting operating forces (people and ships) instead.  
This has a negative effect on all aspects of operations 
and we will be a hollow force in about ten years, maybe 
sooner.

A major effect of the drawdown is the attenuation of 
enlisted promotions to the higher paygrades.  Selection 
rate to Chief Petty Officer is extremely low.  My ship 
had one (only one out of about thirty), E6 make it to 
E7 this year, and only three last year.  And we have some
great people.

At the moment, retention of senior Lieutenants is less 
than 20% (some say less than 10%) across the Naval 
Line (the combat arms - Surface, Sub, and Aviation).  
I don\'t know about Special Warfare or other units.  I 
understand that The Air Force is having similar problems 
with pilot retention. 

This information may be useful in modelling the effects 
of a contraction in the military.  Conversely, promotion 
rates will expand if the kiltary expands (war or dynamic 
exploration with a heavy militray component cause this).

Survival probablities will genarally fall with increasing
promotion and decoration probabilities.

   I was looking up something, and came across this tidbit.

  Astrogator\'s Guide to Diaspora, GDW, 1992, for MT, pp. 13-14.

     "CARL\'S WORLD"

     "First claimed and settled during the Terran expansion
      by geologist-prospector-entrepreneur Carl Sickles ..."


     "He began planning to gradually convert the world to a
      planet sized amusement park, continent by continent,
      as each was exhausted of its mineral wealth.  Today,
      [LG c.1124], 3300 years later, mining still continues,
      but several large theme areas have been created,
      including a small continent devoted entirely to
      genetically engineered dinosaurs from Terra\'s Mesozoic

  Given that I see either possible interpretation of this to
mean that it could have been done c.-2200 (RoM), or in the
period of the Third Imperium, I don\'t want to get into that
whole thing again.

  But I am curious, what is the Traveller Tech Level needed to make this
"Jurassic Park" (the Jurassic is the early Mesozoic)?

  Just something to chew on. :)

  (BTW, in the same source, different page, Orcas (on Sufren) are also
mentioned in the genetic engineering uplift along with the dolphins,
probably part of the 20+ species mentioned in Solomani & Aslan.  Someone
may have mentioned that before.)

In my game, there are several organisations, whose jurisdictions overlap 
somewhat.

At the top are the Nobles. They are the only people authorised to try other 
Nobles, other criminals may appeal to them in certain cases, and all other 
organisations report to them (specifically, to the Sector Duke). All Imperial 
Judges are Nobles.

The Ministry of Justice deals with crimes committed in space, on Imperial 
property, or those involving more than one world. 

Local planetary law-enforcement agencies deal with crimes committed on their 
world.

The Imperial Navy deals with smuggling and piracy. Once caught, the 
perpetrators are handed over to the MoJ.

The IISS Security Branch deals with non-military intelligence gathering 
(internal and external).

The Office of Naval Intelligence (aka Imperial Naval Intelligence) deals with 
military intelligence gathering (internal and external).

examples:

1. Crime committed on world A: dealt with by local authorities.

2. Crime committed at Starport on world A: investigated by MoJ, judged by an 
Imperial Judge (normally a Knight or Baron), if found guilty may appeal to 
planetary noble.

3. Piracy in system A: caught by Navy, then handed over to MoJ (see above).

Enlisted promotions in the US Army are fairly automatic through the first
three grades (Private, Private-2, Private First Class).  Promotion to E-4
is decided on by your commanding officer, and even then he can decide
wether to make you a Specialist 4th Class (SP4, or a sort of super=private)
or a Corporal (an actual NCO, with the perogatives and duties thereof.) To
make Sergeant (E-5) or higher, you have to stand Promotion Boards, and have
an opening for that rank in your military specialty.

Typically, you can make Sergeant in about 5 years, Staff Sergeant (E-6) in
7-8, Sergeant First Class in about 12, Master (or First) Sergeant in about
18, and Sergeant Major after 20 years of service.

	Interesting. How fast do comets travel, and how long would it take a 1g or

Why not state that the Imperial services maintian and up or out policy, and
each term in an "O" rank without promotion results in a -1 to the
re-enlistment roll (ie a penalty).

Many people are suggesting that we use a fixed budget, a la Trillion
Credit Squadron, and let people build N of whatever design they want with
that money.  The problem is that I want to design one ship per THUDDD, and
the TCS model calls for an integrated fleet -- it\'s not a choice between
200 and 1000 ton vessels, but rather possibly some of each, and comparing
just these two would be an apples-and-oranges proposition.

I do agree that 500-1000 tons makes more sense than 500-800.

It sure is!  Obviously, the requirements will be more detailed when the
RFP goes out in early August.  Though it breaks the THUDDD/ISBA model a
little bit, what I hoped to do was design ships indigenous to low-tech
PEs, rather than Sylean craft.  I may change the \'frame story\'
accordingly...hmmmmm...

What I\'m picturing here is a purely military craft, designed to hold off
the forces of that mad dog Cleon and his pack of Quislings. :)  Or the PE
next door, for that matter.  The two optimizing points will be cost and
military capability; however, if you can demonstrate its usefulness in
peacetime (catching smugglers and whatnot), all the better.

See the THUDDD rules at http://www.cinenet.net/users/cberry/thuddd.html .
Basically, the answer is yes, you can drop FFS components into QSDS
designs.

> Or are we waiting for FF&S 2?

Like a three-year-old waiting for a candy bar. :)  But in terms of THUDDD,
no, we\'re using FFS 1 until 2 comes along and invalidates everything.

A bit off topic, but huh?  The San Francisco area has lost at least five
Navy facilities in the last 5 years.  (Treasure Island, NAS Alameda, NAS
Moffit Field, Hunter Point Naval Shipyard, and the Concord Naval Weapons
Station.)

Considering we\'ve lost about 10,000 jobs over this, I have to say that
Congress is indeed closing Naval bases.

Medical and genetics technologies are IMHO, an underveloped area in
Traveller. The MT Referees Companion lists the following tech level 
milestones for medical technology:

0	Mystical medecine
1	Diagnosis of Disease
2	Understanding of crude anatomy
	Internal anatomy
3	Crude surgery
4	Early vaccination
	Antiseptics
5	Mass vaccination	
	X-ray diagnosis
6	Understand viruses	
	Crude prosthetics
7	Organ transplants
	Medical slow drugs
8	Artificial organs
	Slow drugs
9	Limb regeneration
	Cryongenic suspension
10	Antiviral vaccinations
	Growth quickening
11	Nerve refusion
	Artificial eyes
12	Broad antitoxins
	Enhanced prosthetics
13	Cloned body parts
	Reanimation
14	Genetic engineering
	Memory erasure
15	Anagathics
	Pseudobio prosthetics
16	Brain transplants
	Crude memory transfer
17	Selective memory erase
	Intelligent antibodies
18	Partial memory transfer (dupe)
	Non-cryo suspend
19	Adv bioengineering
20	Total memory transfer
21	Total rejuvenation

At TL 14, the RC states that "genetic enngineering techniques culminate 
in the creation of altered, "improved" life forms, including sentients.

At TL 19, the RC states that "Advanced bioengineering is developed, 
allowing living organisms to be directly manipulated into variant life 
forms."

This would definitively place the technology used on Carl\'s World
between 14 and 19, probably at the lower end.  Please note that the
Jonkereen also fall into this category.

IMO, the geneering techniques required to re-engineer sauropods and 
such from mosquito spit is probably about 14.  this is consistent with 
the premise that the RoM enjoyed highly advanced biomedical technology,
if the project occured then

Oh, I don\'t dispute that. I quite agree that a shared http/ftp server 
is a better idea. 

As an aside, technically, there\'s nothing stopping someone from making 
a email-ftp upload service available. In fact, I suppose someone\'s 
already got one. Though, most likely only to their own site.

  Wouldn\'t a small run be much more economical on CD-ROM, whether it

Totally agree. The only plausible explanation is that people don\'t

Okay, I\'ve got a little book here, "The British Army - A Pocket Guide", which 
has a "sample career" in the back (which is almost certainly a little 
generous). Let\'s compare...

Year  BA     Traveller (Marines)
1     Pvt    Marine
2            Pvt
3            L/Cpl
4     L/Cpl  Cpl
5     Cpl    Sgt
6-8
9     Sgt    GSgt
10-12
13    CSgt   Sgt1C
14-15
16    CSM
17           MSgt
18-20
21           SgtMaj
22    RSM

Interestingly, it seems to work out the same in the end. Traveller adds a new 
grade at the start, plus another flavour of sergeant, which helps to explain 
all the extra promotions, but I still don\'t like the huge leap at the start. 
How about moving one of those to the 2nd term?

1  Marine
2  Pvt
3  
4  L/Cpl
5  Cpl
6
7  Sgt
8
9+ as above

Hi Doug,

I acknowledge that California in particular has been deeply 
affected by the previous round of cuts, but I am speaking 
with regards to the next round of cuts to be implemented over
the next several years due to the findings of the QDR.
Congress has refused to cut any more bases due to the 
perceived impact on constituent economies.  So the next 
round of cuts are coming directly out of force structure, 
meaning people and equipment procurement.  In case you 
didn\'t know, the current US military is in no way capable
of fighting Desert Storm again.  The force structure and 
experience has been largely eroded and the available
forces are quite a bit smaller than they were in 1990-1991. 

On a positive note, there is a lot of high quality
planning for this smaller future force structure. 
Good systems are under procurement and in planning. 
The military of 2015 will be an interesting one 
much more like that of 2300 AD than today\'s.  

The current situation isn\'t nearly as bad as the 
post-Vietnam Navy, but it\'s getting there.  The general high 
public opinion for the military has put it constantly under 
the spotlight, so that any problems become a public forum 
for discussion about social change in the US. The military 
is a hotbed of social engineering and I\'ve seen at least
one career (the best commanding Officer I\'ve ever seen) 
destroyed by a false accusation of private misconduct by 
a civilian. 

There is a serious danger of losing the ability to fight
to administration in support of superfluous social
programs in the military.  For example, I spend most of 
my time doing admin instead of real engineering or tactical 
training. I guess this is the price of peace.  In any case, 
to meet all of the legal requirements imposed by various 
general orders and instructions, a panel working on the 
2015 Navy has found that we would have to work 82 hour 
long days, 7 days a week, 365 days a year.  One might 
think that this is self imposed, but the structure 
mandating these requirements is not capable of removing 
the requirements once they are enacted. The bureaucracy
is too inefficient.

One of my superiors sees about a 150 combatant fleet by 2015, 
this compared to the present fleet of about 350. In reality
this translates to constant deployment without time for major 
overhaul and training.  It may be possible to do this, but
not with the current administrative requirements.

So why am I staying in?  Well, for now it\'s because I simply
love driving ships and leading men.  The combat training can 
be fun, but because of the massive attrition it seems like
we are losing people faster than we can train them.  It\'s
frustrating and I fear sometimes that I won\'t be able to
accomplish the job when called, meaning victory in COMBAT.

Take care and keep writing of guardian of the canon!

What if your charecter conception is that the charecter was an enlisted
person and not an officer ? I had this same problem with MT as well.  I
generated a charecter who was a naval officer and determined that both
his parents had also been in the navy.  Slightly later I had a bit of
extra time and decided to roll up both of his mothers (This charecter
was the genetic product of two women via artificial means.)  I started
them both out as E1\'s.  Both charecters made their way up through the
enlisted ranks, attended OCS and achieved promotion all the way to O10,
Grand Admiral. I did run these charecters through a large number of
terms (because I had deceided that the parents of my 34 year old
charecter had just retired) but did not mess with the results in any
way.  My initial charecter conception, that of a Naval academy officer
son of proud enlisted parents had to change to that of the son of two
mustang Grand Admirals.

Easy promotion has always been a feature of the MT (and CT advanced)
charecter generation system.  Depending on branch and assignment Naval
charecters tend to have a promotion chance of better than 50% (usually a
7+) per year (not counting training).  Since each officer may only
receive 1 promotion per 4 year term what this means is that a naval
officer has less than 1 chance in 16 (0.5^4) of not being promoted each
term.  I agree that the roles are a little easy but this is not a _new_
feature.

Yes it did.  As I pointed out at the end of my post, I\'d support this if
the books were kept small and inexpensive, as they were in CT.  What I
fear though is the US$22 perfect-bound, gloosy-covered book that is
filled with lots of useless drivel because the financial types want to
keep the price-point up.  Keep the books small and efficient and in the
US$10 range and I\'ll but \'em.

Agreed.  (Although I don\'t know what TO&E is).  BTW, Central Supply

But inaccurate? Perhaps not.  ;-)   A hostile takeover is paper piracy.
Both deal with running large financial organizations.  Hell, I\'d throw
the Nobles in with them since Nobles are basically \'legal\' mafioso.
Also, given the different law levels of member worlds of the Imperium,
what is a legal commodity on one planet may be contraband on another.
Since the Imperium rules only the space between the stars, what do they
care if Corporation Z manufactures and markets a \'mildly\' addictive
narcotic derivative on planet Alpha that would be illegal on Sylea?

Finally, as a matter of logistics, wouldn\'t you want all the game
machanics of running _any_ financial enterprise in one book?  Its all
just "business" after all.  ;-)

	But basically, success of these designs (i.e. them actually being

	If we just put bang/buck in as a voting category, this will
motivate the designers to make effective SDB\'s, without fettering their

gladly.  She is currently travelling for pleasure and could be found
most anywhere in the Spinward Marches or Deneb Sectors heading towards
the Imperial core.

Tarlineal is one of the few people in Imperial history to have received
a Starburst for Extreme Heroism while serving as a Grand Admiral.  Late
in the Fourth Frontier War her Depot/Deneb based support unit was near
the front lines at Lysen/Spinward Marches 1307. The Lysen system was
very lightly defended at the time as most of the fleet assets normally
deployed there were attacking the Zhodani Naval base at Cipango/Spinward
Marches 0705. While she was in the staff briefing area of the Vaughan, a
badly dammaged Plankwell class Dreadnought which had been seperated from
its BatRon, arranging repairs with its commander, a line branch Grand
Admiral, Zhodhani Teleport Commandos invaded the ship.  They achieved
almost complete tactical surprise and it was later discovered that due
to the dammage to the Vaughan their ship had been able to approach far
too closely. 

They quickly killed the line Grand Admiral.  Tarlineal opened up a live
secondary plasma feed line and used it like a PGMP to kill much of the
squad.  She then took command of the ship and lead the ships crew in
repelling the borders before they could blow up the already dammaged
ship.  While badly injured from this combat she lead the repair crew
which managed to bring the Vaughan\'s spinal mount on line in only half
an hour and drove the Zhodani BatRon, which outmassed her ships by over
2 to 1 and was almost undammaged, from the system.

Her actions unquestionably saved the ship from destrucion and the
strategic system from Zhodani capture.  She received a medical
discharge, a SEH, and a Baroncy for her actions.

[Canon Purists please note that this particular battle is not canonical
but nor is it contradicted by anything canonical that I have seen.]

Tarlineal is usually accompanied by her wife Dutchess Grand Admiral Dr
Khakuuki Esarkhankur Imperial Navy (Medical) retired.  Tarlineal has 3
children whom she loves but rarely sees.

In most miltary organizations, those first three grades are essintialy the
same rank with higher pay.

The only difference between being a Private (E-1) and Private First Class
(E-3) was that my pay was higher.  I was still addressed as Private Berry,
I had no authority, and still did peon work.  Those early promotions are
designed to reward competance, and to encourage soldiers to think about
staying in.

The happiest day of my life was the day I made Corporal and found myself in
charge of a motor pool detail, rather than working on one...

Some interior Planetary Defence Forces will have 50 year old Lieutenants;
look at the USMC prior to WWII, where most Marines were in their late
twenties before they made Sergeant.  Where there is no room for
advancement, there will be no promotions.

officer grades 1-3&5 are identical to the Navy grades, with the addition of
the word "force" to designate the holder as a Marine.

The high end NCO ranks require some expalnation.. A Ship\'s Sergeant is the
senior NCO of eith a Marine Company or any detachment smaller than a
Battalion.  A Master Gunner is a Marine serving in a technical position
without command authority.

Fleet Sergeants are diferent from Command Fleet Sergeants in that the
CF/SGT is the senior NCO of a Battalion or larger unit.. There is an
unoffcial rank of Regimental Fleet Sergeant for the CF/SGT of a Regiment.
Master Fleet Sergeant is the rank given to senior NCOs of entire fleets or
subsectors.  There is one Sector Master Fleet Sergeant per sector, and the
Force Master Fleet Sergeant has his office on Sylea.

It\'s not so much a question of the tech level involved as it is the lack of
information available.  Jurassic Park suggested that the blood of dinosaurs
could be found in insects embedded in amber.  The DNA that, to date, has
contained only a few kb(kilobase pairs) and these pairs are only fragmentary
at best.  Without a framework within which to put this information, the DNA
is, essentially, useless.  The means of extracting DNA will improve but the
problem remains the same DNA decays at a fairly constant rate without an
"intact" sample we are left to our imaginations as the only recourse.
 Unless, of course, those rumours of "Nessie" are, in fact, true.

   What I really want is for Phoebe Cates to leave her no talent husband

   I know what you mean though.  You had hoped that Marc Miller\'s
Traveller would be something that would be compatible with the version
of Traveller you now own.  What you are finding out though is that MMT
*replaces* all previous versions of Traveller instead.  The intent is to
assimilate rather than to supplement.

   I hate to tell everyone I told you so, but...

>IMHO, what we need ASAP is a M0 edition of the Imperial Encyclopedia.

   Any new version of the Imperial Encyclopedia would likely reflect
reality as Marc Miller\'s Traveller sees it, not the reality presented in
the original work.

   Let\'s also get something straight.  I am not "T4" bashing.  I\'m sure
that whatever Marc Miller comes up with in the way of a game is going to
be wonderful.  Certainly if I were justing starting out in gaming this
would be an excellent time to jump on board the MMT bandwagon.  The next
few supplements appear to show some real potential.

   But what is being developed is not GDW\'s Traveller.  It is something
new (I\'m sure Leroy would say \'new and improved\').  So long as everyone
keeps that in mind, there will be a lot less verbal violence around
here.

BTW, I just told J.P. about this find (actually, I remembered the
reference, I just forgot that it was a world settled pre/early RoM
times.  He concurs with what Traveller says about this.

OK, that at first seems to match previous findings, so no surprise in
that regard.

A question.  If we (Terra/Third Imperium) managed to find a dinosaurod
cell that was viable, and we placed it in an ostrich egg, is that good
enough to give us the equivalent dinosaur from the one cell, despite a
non-sauroid egg as host?

Second question.  If we can do this with dinosaurs at TL14, what is
different from doing the total rejuvenation at TL21?  I can imagine a
good cloned body, with no RNA, but that is just TL20 total memory
transfer, right?  So why do we have to wait to TL21 for total rejuv.?

I don\'t necessarily disagree here.  I just want to follow through on all
reasoning before I make up my mind on claims made here.

On at least one post, someone said that Marc Miller had been quoted as
saying it was TL15, and to be fair, someone at DGP had said that it was
TL13.  Those numbers should be included in any proper tally. :)

Didn\'t someone say that there were 300+ people on this list?  That is
_not_ a call for voting again.  Besides, if it really were canon, how
could voting on it make it so?  I am serious about this.  I am willing
to listen to views of canonists and non-canonists alike.

It seems to me that the big flaw of canonism is that it is also dependent
upon rules interpretation, which is not always consistent among people
discussing _any_ game.

You know, I think I now understand why _nobody_ (except Harold in one
note on another subject), ever responded to my "What is Canon?" thread.
I also think that were lurkers to decide to risk having their opinions
known (and toasted, and I don\'t mean the kind with wineglasses), we could
identify a myriad of canon frames of reference, in the Einsteinian sense.

Thoughts?

(And now for some humor for the troops in the trenches.)

I\'m beginning to feel more and more like canon is the bad tasting meal
you are obliged to eat when visiting a friend\'s house. :)

As that old song goes, "Canon to the left of me, canon to the right--
here I am, stuck in the middle with you." :)

Huh? Excuse me, but why the hell didn\'t you 1) just create them by hand,
or 2) ignore rolling for Commission? This is the perfect example of when
*NOT* to roll up a character\'s (or NPC\'s) background. You want his 
mothers to be enlisted characters? Fine, MAKE them enlisted characters.
No chart is *forcing* you to give them commissions.

My tone isn\'t directed at you, Peter, it\'s a product of the "chart for every-
thing" syndrome that is creeping into Traveller once again. This is why I
was so opposed to the Birthday chart being in the book instead of the 
simple instruction to pick a number between 1 and 365. It\'s why, although
I like the background detail charts that were posted recently and 
appreciate the work that went into them, I dislike the concept... what\'s 
next, charts to tell us what our characters\' favorite colors are? A table
detailing what they had for breakfast this morning?

Agreed, because Traveller characters are that cut above the rest of the
downtrodden masses in the Imperium. Therefore, promotion comes 
easier than it does in Real Life(tm). If someone doesn\'t want an officer, 
then don\'t roll on the commission table. I\'m going to put that option into
Beginnings in the next version out. 

It\'s also why I don\'t have a problem with such a high chance of becoming
a Noble in chargen; this *isn\'t* the table that normal people in the 3I get
to roll on when they are born, this is the table for Travellers!  :)

I agree that you can never go back. However, it may be in the best
interest of Traveller to look into reformating and printing (CD or
otherwise) much of what has be already done. It represents a huge
resource that any new player would find invaluable. Remove game rules,
etc, and keep the adventures, history, etc. This is what makes Traveller
so unique in the market place, it very long history and brand. Why not
build on it. Heck, why are you not using that angle now? Traveller: the
longest running space RPG on the market! 

In addition, I do a ton of work in with different types of print
production and with the changes in digitial technology it is very
possible to do short run print jobs. Or why not go to a Just In time
print capability? 

I would look into both a CD as a resource, and a simple two color short
run resource guide for non-computer people.

I realise that some general guidelines (and attendant tables) are
neccesary, but this thread produced so much specific debate about hexes and
hierarchies that I felt that a case needed to be made for the unique nature
of each member of the nobility (they are, after all, not that common,
otherwise they\'d be "commoners" :) ). Perhaps the intended spirit of these
charts as guidelines could be noted nearby in the revised rules text. It
might encourage a little more creativity in this very important part of the
game.

Marc,

Are you intending on putting examples like this one in the main rulebook,
with explainations such as your post? I feel that it would be VERY worth
while, especially for new players (who we all want introduced to
Traveller). Perhaps it could be part of a FAQ section after all the
character careers. The one example currently there doesn\'t really cut it
(IMHO anyway).

Also in the FAQ section you could/should answer questions like multiple
careers (if you decide they aren\'t allowed in the standard rules),
automatic skills (this one had me wondering until I saw the other post
recently - as far as I know it isn\'t clear in the current T4 rules either),
and many other things which I\'m sure the TML could come up with. T4.1 has
to be as friendly to new GMs as possible - if you are going to have a whole
page just to choose a number between 1 and 365, you could devote at least 1
page (and preferable several) to questions and answers.

Regards,
Jason

PS: T4.1 looks like it is going to be excellent - keep up the good work!

Traveller is basically founded on the US Army rank structure. They call a new
recruit Recruit E1, and they advance him to Private E2 after about 6 weeks.
Private First Class E3 comes to many within a few months, and virtually
everyone after a year.After two years, they make you E4 (Usually they call it
Specialist 4th Class). Thereafter promotions come about 1 per term.

What this does is bunch a lot of military training and skills into the first
term for enlisted people. Technically, I would think its worth while spending
your first term as an enlisted person. Go for Commission in Term2.

I don\'t know about anyone else, but, to me this description sounds like
you take a living being (like your character) drop it in a vat and it
comes out with wings, horns, gills, or even as an entirely different
species.  This is purely Ancient level tech which no one in the 1st, 2nd,
or 3rd Imperium has ever come close to.

The Jonkereen were geneered not bioengineered, so TL 14. Unless the folks
on Carl\'s world were dropping adult goats into vats and bioengineering
them into dinosaurs creating dinosaurs form lizard DNA would be TL 14, and
creating them from partial dinosaur DNA would be even easier (perhaps TL
12)? 

IMHO, the geneering techniques required to re-engineer sauropods and such
from mosquito spit is probably about 14. 

At TL 14 you could make dinosaurs out of lizard or bird DNA.  If you have
large segments of dino DNA you have a *big* head start on the process and
could almost certainly do it earlier. 

Since we are doing *lots* of genetic engineering now (TL 8) I\'d say that
TL 14 means you can create animals (or people) made to order.  The old DGP
TD articles on medicine sated this pretty clearly (by 1100 a few companies
had even sold off a bunch of geneered FFFF (Str, End, Dex, Int) humans to
various buyers.

Question: If the corrected FS data is going to be in M0 Campaign, which
is due to come out this week, shouldn\'t all of the rewrite be done by
now?  am I missing something here?  What exactly is going to be
corrected in M0 Campaign?

And this wouldn\'t just be useful from a "fan-wanting-everything\'
perspective.  It\'d give people a chance to read those extremely rare
products (i.e. Alien modules!), as well as putting all of Traveller\'s
\'canon\' into an easily accessible form.  This would promote the
conintuance of a consistent history in T4 and not make it, like some
have suggested a \'different Traveller\'.

Marc; please urge IG to consider this product.

Kind of on this topic, I\'d love to see a Traveller 20th anniversary
edition of the T4 rules presented in three little black books.  The
front of the box would be identical to the original CT except for a fold
foil stamp number:

 ----
|      #0001     |
|    1977-1997   |
|    TRAVELLER   |
 ----

Or something similar.  To avoid confusion over the contents, have the
back printed with a new \'blurb\' explaining that the contents fof the
T4.1 book have been reprinted in three little black books ala the
origninal CT volumes.  Also, just make them have text inside like the
originals.

Hell, I\'d buy it!

Perhaps it should read something like this:

TL 19 Genetics - "Advanced bioengineering is developed, allowing
non-sentient living organisms to be directly manipulated into variant
lifeforms.  The process is instituted in a normal lifeform, and takes
several generations to manifest itself fully."

This would lower the power of the genetics to effect only non-sentient
creatures, so that nothing on the scale of the Ancient large-scale
manipulation of huamsn can be done.  Also, by adding the \'takes several
generations\' it is not a \'drop it in a vat\' scenario.  Comments?

Thanks,

   I think Andrew is looking for what the general concensus on the
subject is.  Those that really give a rat\'s butt have probably voted by
now.  The consensus would seem to be TL 12-13.

   If you want to talk *Traveller*, there is a great deal of consensus
on a wide variety of issues dealing with the background material. 
That\'s why Canonists find MMT a bit more than frustrating--it doesn\'t
agree with Traveller on some pretty basic issues.  Imagine trying to
debate American History with someone from a parallel universe, where
there was no Spanish-American War (thus no American control of the
Phillipines, T. Roosevelt never becomes President, etc.) and George
Patton was elected President of the U.S. instead of Eisenhower.

   Relativism is a MMT concept, not a Traveller concept.  If GDW said
it, that was that, no matter what anyone else said (including DGP). 
While there are a wide variety of variant Traveller campaigns being run
by people out there, I doubt if any of those running them consider them
anything but a variant, and not just another interpretation of the
official storyline.

>I\'m beginning to feel more and more like canon is the bad tasting meal

   As in real life, if you don\'t like the food, go eat at a restaurant
down the street, or make your own food at home!

... and allegedly 2% of US citizens think they\'ve been abducted by 
aliens.  (I suspect that what the survey actually shows is 2% of 
Americans fulfil criteria which are consistent with but do not imply 
the standard "abduction story" which is now public folklore anyway.)

On a visit to the FBI museum, my g/f Catharine[*] asked about X-files 
and the FBI guide said, rather wearily, that they didn\'t exist.  So 
shurely they must? 8-)

On Leroy\'s question of what could be done with an intact dinosaur cell, I\'d 
have thought that depends on the cell.  During the growth of most higher 
animals, cells differentiate themselves (some become eye cells, others skin 
cells, etc).  So you\'d probably have to find a cells that has not yet 
differentiated itself, such as a fertilised egg cell.  Of course, 
sufficiently advanced technology may be able to reverse or alter cell 
differentiation, e.g. changing a skin cell into an eye cell, in which case 
any cell might do.

As Scott said, the first problem is getting all the DNA intact.  Here are 
some more complications.  Parts of the cell\'s machinery called mitochondria 
(which produce energy for the cell) have their own separate nucleic acid.  
Still, you could maybe use mitochondria from another animal, because they 
are "highly conserved", i.e. haven\'t changed much with evolution.  The next 
complication is that, although DNA tells a cell what proteins to assemble, 
the final form of the proteins if affected by other cell machinery (e.g. by 
glycosylation, for any technoheads out there).  You could have a go by 
playing with dinosaur DNA in a non-dinosaur cell.  But to create a truly 
authentic dinosaur, you\'d need more than just the DNA.

Don\'t see that this should ruin a good plot.  I can\'t imagine players, on 
seeing a Velocoraptor look-alike, saying: "Don\'t worry, it\'s not 
authentic!"

It\'s an adventure, and a good one at that...
It was written by the folks from DGP for GDW, and contains the hunt 
for an incedibly ancient treasure (a city of the race the Ancients 
were researching, the Primordeals) It is set in Massilia sector, and 
is supremely laid out, presented in the Nugget format and contains 
smaller parts that could be used seperatly as well. Add to that that 
it is set between the fronts of Margaret and Lucan (with Agents of 
Dulinor as well), you have an exiting Rebellion-era adventure.

The comet won\'t *have* a tail that far out. Remember, the tail is
caused by the solar wind pushing on material that is evaporating as the
comet warms up. And it\'s warming up due to the increased sunlight as it
gets closer to the star.

The velocity will be neglible as far as orbital velocity goes. Thjat
far from a star orbital velocities are measured in *meters* per second.
Random velocity components may be larger. But it shouldn\'t be any worse
than matching the velocity difference between star systems.

Considering that comets are around 5-10 km in diameter, you\'d probably
"dig in" and melt the ice (water, methane, ammonia, maybe even hydrogen
ice).

FF&S, or Fire Fusion and Steel, was, in some people\'s opinion (including
mine) just about the most valuable product in the Traveller:The New Era
line for us old fogies who were still playing "Classic" traveller or
Megatraveller.

It is (or was, since its out of print) a relatively complete hard-science
fiction set of design rules for all manner of vehicles and weapons.  There
were design tables and sequences for Mass Drivers, Lasers, Small Arms
(Chemical, gauss and Electro-Thermo-Chemical[ETC] propelled rounds), CPR
Guns, Electronic components, missiles, all kinds of vehicles, and, of
course, starships.  There were also smallish sections on alternative
technologies...including the alternative of returning to "Classic"
traveller technologies (TNE had no "reactionless" thrusters, which meant
that space combat became a contest of economic usage of limited fuel
resources).

My own copy is dog-eared and well worn at the edges.  Especially the Gun
design section.  The other sections were not as useful unless you were
playing the TNE rules in toto.  I adopted the personal combat rules since
that altered the backgroung hardly at all (although I did add in Fusion and
Plasma guns).

By the way, if anyone has a copy of FF&S (original) for sale, or will trade
for a few Challenge magazines, let me know.

Re: taking several generations for full manifestation.  Taking 
generations for changes applies to genetic breeding programs, so you\'d 
be right if talking about this.  You wouldn\'t have to wait if you used 
genetic engineering: you just splice those genes right in and hey 
presto!  There are obviously one or two other factors to consider (e.g. 
gene promoters and start/stop instructions) but you can get an instant 
result.

Incidentally, most characteristics are probably affected by both genes 
and environment.  So I doubt you could get an FFFF (Str, End, Dex, Int) 
by genetics alone.  Training, the right nutrition, etc would have to 
accompany the genetic manipulation.  Not that this should be a problem

DEEP SPACE DEPOTS

Bruce E J Lewis <bruce@legend.ftech.co.uk> asked about Deep Space...

>I can\'t really remember reading anything at all in all the Traveller books
>I\'ve got about deep space supply depots. Is this something I\'ve missed?

These exist in various canon sources, as pointed out by other TML members,
from CT to TNE. The majority of such stations are secret military bases and
are thus rarely mentioned. Such bases do contravene the principle of having
to have a large gravity well as a jump destination (which has sometimes been
called \'canon\'). I decided they were a useful plot and gaming device for PE
(and Traveller in general) and thus they appeared in the war rules.

>What references are there about them? Surely various empires would have
>built these depots to cross rifts, saving time and money.

As a general point, they should be extremely expensive to build and run;
unfortunately the war rules underwent a number of changes just before we
submitted PE to IG, so I can\'t recall offhand the precise details.

MEGACORPS AND CAREER-SPECIFIC BOOKS

Steve Daniels <blueboy@bu.edu> and Peter Miller discussed career-specific
books...

CORE/BITS were intending to bring out a series of such books this year.
However, our efforts have been somewhat diverted towards work for IG, hence
the limited output this year. These books were also suggested to IG in our
product proposal last year and we are currently talking to IG about 1998
products.

>However, I would support a large number of books, if they were *Small*
>and *cheap*. Talking $12 a book per career at most.

This was our intention with the BITS books (which are about 4.50 UKP, i.e.
6-7$US in the UK, and 36-40 A5 pages). However, our proposals to IG were/are
to amalgamate multiple careers into larger books, to make them cost effective.

WORLD DESIGN BOOK

s.johnson107@genie.com said:

>    Howabout something for those of us who are world building fanatics?
>Something al la World Builders Handbook, only in greater detail and with
>sections allowing/showing how to detail the planetary history would be nice.

Another one of our proposals to IG (which seems to be a likely candidate for
1998) is a World Design Book, which updates the Scouts and TNE systems and
includes a much wider range of RPG-related details (on technologies,
cultures, mercantile considerations, etc.) than the WBH. Each section of the
book would concentrate upon a particular aspect of the system or world
generation process and would allow you two levels of detail - the first
simplistic level would allow a referee to generate just enough waffle to
satisfy the players with superficial details (for example, how many asteroid
belts in the system or how many starports and their general level of
facilities); the second level would go into greater detail (for example, the
composition of the asteroid belts and details of mining therein; or the
precise number and nature of berths at the starport, and the detailed level
of service, shops, engineering facilities, etc. available). The book would
have more textual explanations of aspects of the star system and world
cultures (rather like FF&S explained various technicalities in sidebars and
sections) so that the book would be of use to the less technical/scientific
referees (which could not really be said of previous such books). For
example, it would tell you just how far about your average asteroids were... :-)

I count (in CT) approximately 6 rules books, 13 Adventures, 13 Supplements, 6
Double Adventures, 6 Alien Modules, several board games, and who knows what
else. MegaTravellers has at least six 96 page books. TNE has (a lot) of books
and modules.

The choices (for creating a CD-ROM) are:

Scan every page as an image.
Scan every page and convert to text.
Scan every page and convert to text, then edit.
Scan every page and convert to text, then edit, and remove some of the
material.
Scan every page and convert to text, then make it hypertext.

Each additional step of work calls for a higher budget.

Centurion, E7 Sergeant Major, E8 Regimental Sergeant Major(RSM), E9 Sergeant
Major of Sector(SSM), E10 Imperial Sergeant Major(ISM).

Monitor leads a squad;  Sergeant attatched to platoon, Centurion attatched to
Company, Sergeant Major to a battalion, RSM leads regiment, SMoS leads sector
NCOs, ISM is the voice for all NCOs within Marines.

O1 Lieutenant, O2 Senior Lieutenant, O3 Captain, O4 Major, O5 Force

O6 Colonel, O7 Brigadier, O8 Major General, O9 Lieutenant General, O10
Colonel General, O11 Star Marshal.

Lieutenant leads a platoon, Captain heads a company, Force Commander heads a
battalion, Colonel commands a regiment, Brigadier commands a brigade(a
regiment plus attatched units, i.e. independant action), Major General
commands a division (although I prefer the name legion), Lieutenant General
commands a corps, Colonel General is the peacetime commander of the Marines,
Star Marshal is the wartime commandant of the Marines(after requisite
inflation in the size of the Corps).

I\'m hoping that BITS will (at last!) publish my Traveller Bibliography at
Euro Gen Con at the end of August.

If so, you will be able to buy - in one handy volume - details of every
Traveller item ever published with information as to how it fits into the
scheme of things as well as loads of other facts and figures no discerning
Traveller would be without. <ok, so I\'m biased!>

Even I\'m looking forward to it as my rough drafts are invaluable for
reference!

Woo-hoo! Me too! This one has _lots_ of really good, vague, yet
obvious-when-you-read-between-the-lines kind of evidence.
That and Hivers starting the Rebellion.

My new theory on jumpspace: Gradnfather wanted to collect a lot
of energy... so he designed a device that allows you to travel
FTL, but sucks up a lot of energy... and dumps it into a "energy sink"
universe that provides all the energy for his own "real" toys.

At the same time, please consider giving Roger Sanger permission to reprint
the old Traveller\'s Digest issues, and perhaps other DGP supplements.  The
old Traveller books had some really neat stuff in them, and having a select
portion of them available would add another several dozen books worth of
info to the Traveller line with far less effort than writing new stuff.

Game stores will often shelve according to when they last got new stuff, so
any "new" thing that comes out for T4 will sell the things that are already
in print.  According to Gamesmanship, they figure that a new item will
usually sell at least one old item.

ranks have an associated minimum Social Standing? Is it reasonable for 
the Grand Admiral of the Fleet to have a Soc of 1?

There are two ways of looking at this. First, in society as 
class-conscious as the Imperium[1], a scummy little Soc-1 peasant will 
have a much harder time getting promotions than a Soc-10 gentleman, who 
plays golf with the Baron every other weekend. From this point of view, 
you can be promoted as long as your Soc is >= the minimum for the rank. 
If you receive a further promotion, you get a +1 Soc instead. Next 
time, since your Soc has increased, you may be promoted.

The alternative way of looking at it is that the Soc increase is a 
normal side-effect of the promotion - a higher rank means better pay, a 
better standard of living, and more respect from those around you. In 
this case, if your Soc is too low, you receive a +1 Soc in addition to 
the promotion.

My suggested limits are Soc = N+4, where N is the officer rank 
number[2]. 

Navy example:

O1 Ensign          5
O2 SubLieutenant   6
O3 Lieutenant      7
O4 Lieutenant Cdr  8
O5 Commander       9
O6 Captain         A
O7 Rear Admiral    B (Knight)
O8 Vice Admiral    C (Baron)
O9 Admiral         D (Count)

[1]Is it? It has an active Nobility, plus Soc is one of the characters 
defining characteristics, so the evidence is yes. 

[2]Yes, this raises high-ranking officers to the Nobility. This feels 
right to me. Real World example? I can\'t find a single British officer 
above O6-equivalent who isn\'t either a Knight or a Lord.

I do not want to see TCS. I do think that the design parameters should
include a sentance "Total Cost should not exceed MCr. XXX.XX per unit."

It\'s like when the Navy (or AF) has a fighter design contest.  *They* have
the role developed, the designers need to fit the requirements...including
budgetary.  If the design comes in under budget, hooray for the designer,
but its competing against over budget but more capable designs.

The SDB needs to be "small, cheap, with a 30+ day endurance, and
deployable/effective in numbers against an invading fleet."  I would use
the CT SDB as a guide for cost limitations and mission parameters.  The
SDB, by the way, is *not* a revenue cutter, although it will serve as such
in a pinch.  The SDB should be a dedicated defensive vessel.

Incidentially, my favorite "SDB" is the 10-15kton "Battle Rider" type
design, with the biggest spinal mount it can carry, just enough other
weapons and defenses to get her in range, and manuvering characteristics of
a fighter.  Now *that\'s* the way to defend a system.

That\'s the way it is now.  I tried to get the ranks to match up between the
Navy and Marines to cut down on the confusion.  If you are a Navy rating,
and told to go find Capt. Nelson, you won\'t be confused when the officer in
question is wearing LTs pips.  Also, I just like the sound of "Force
Lieutenant Van Rijn, reporting as ordered."

I\'m a former grunt myself, but this adds a little bit of flavor.  These are
just suggestions, feel free to use, modify or ignore as you wish.

True, I was just being a completeness fanatic here.. if you do decide to
use this, just the generic Ship and Fleet Sergeant designations would be
needed; the extended ranks could go into whatever military expansion is
planned.

I\'ve been having some trouble getting in contact with IG via their
\'sales\' and other addresses.  The \'sales\' address messages are bounced
backt o me, and I haven\'t got responss from the others.  I\'m trying to
ask for some information on ordering T4.1, so if anyone knows what\'s
going on, I\'d appreciate it.

Actually, if someone here can answer my questions, I was wondering how
much delivery of T41 to Canada is, and when I could expect it to arrive.

Thanks,

I started to use the above system today, and generated a merchant
character. This threw up two questions:

1) Why does it get easier to get promoted as you move up the ranks? (I
assume that a positive DM increases the target number eg 7- becomes 9-). I
would have thought that it would become progressively harder to get
promoted as you moved up the structure, but I\'ve never served in the
merchant navy to comment from strength.

2) How do you roll the \'7\' to get a free-trader? The text on MO benefits
doesn\'t appear to explain, and merchant specific text also seems to miss
this out.

It was interesting to see that the highest possible skill I could have got
after 4 terms and an ED8 was Business-6 (which I actually split evenly...).
That was using random generation of skills as well...

I like what I\'ve seen of the rewrite so far...

and now w/o further ado...I present to you The Commander.

bprankard goes behind a green curtain, suddenly there is a loss of power 
akin to a \'jump dim\' and a man dressed in a black military uniform appears, 
you know immediately that this is the infamous Commander X!

Greetings fellow sentients!

This thread on deep space staions intreage me, for obvious reasons. 
 Although it is not published, and therefore not canon (gasp, am I mearly a 
figment of someones overactive imagination, it can\'t be!) Planet X as it is 
commonly refered to is indeed a refurbished military deep space garrison.

How did I manage this, first of all being a noble helped out.  Being able to 
put a high stake on such a project don\'t come cheap.  The next thing I did 
was make sure the station was in a good location, it just so happens that 
Planet X connects the Sylean Main with the Zimiin Cluster, much to Josph 
Callifor\'s (Founder Shipworks, Co-Founder of ISBA) delight!  Being at a J-1 
nexus means trade, big trade, and big bucks. Since there are no resources in 
deep space (I don\'t care what you read in the popular fiction, comets and 
rogue planetoids as few and far between in deep space!) trade is an absolute 
neccesity, everything must be imported.

For import, you need something to export to pay for everything, thats where 
the shipbuilding industry comes in.  Military contracting seemed the best 
approach, even with the Zhunastu Corporation as a competitor.  An agreement 
was reached, Zhunastu Industries would research basic energy production and 
propulsion, and my company would use existing technology and produce new 
experimental military tactics and weapons.  Thus the name X-TEK, which 
originaly ment, eXperinental TEKnologies group. (Pay attention, this is a 
trivia question on Imperial Jeopardy!)

Military Contracting was a start, but the people who would soon visit the 
\'floating starport\' would want to buy more than just starships, and not 
eveyone can buy military hardware.  So diversification came into effect. 
 From experimental military hardware came civilian applications.  Sensors 
and optic systems, communications and personal saftey equipment.  Grav 
Vehicles have become a very popular sell.

It is obvious that the government of such a station would be corporate, 
after all it is a starport.  Eveyone who lives there is a corporate 
employee.  Mind you I run my business like a well oiled machine, or a naval 
ship.  Can\'t keep an old Sol Naval man from his leadership training! :)

Now I noticed there were concerns of navigation, a station isnt going to be 
big enough to have its own gravity well.  You are going to need nav bouys, 
evenly spaced out, and broadcasting a frequency and common comm ranged to 
direct the flow of traffic.  Even though you publidh and broadcast exact 
co-ordinates to your base, even the best nav can\'t zero in all the time. 
 and since there is nothing to nav by in deep space, you need artificial 
landmarks.  A Spacial Positioning System (SPS) if you will.

To recap, how do I do it?  First make sure you got the creds(and the guts!) 
do begin such an endevour.  Second, build your station in a deep space 
location where it is on a main, or better yet connects 2 mains into one. 
 Thirdly, keep in mind that this is a starport and as such business is your 
main concern, if you\'re military then don\'t wory, the tax credits will pay 
for it! :)  As a business you need a commodity, in my case the station is a 
shipyard and starport.  Also make sure people can nav to your station, it 
awfuly dark out there. Last but not least, cater to everybody!  You WILL 
need the extra credits!

Thank you for leting me discuss deep space stations on this forum.  If I 
manage to keep at least one young upstart from making little more than a 
deep space \'mom & pop\' operation (refuling and gift shop, in IISS terms a 
Class D Starport, in ancient Solomani a \'tourist trap!\')  and reeking 
finacial ruin, so much the better.

My work here is done, for now.  Now where did I put those insanely delicious 
cookies...

The lights fade to black, The Commander is gone, replaced by the guy from 
behind the curtain.

Thats the show, hope you enjoyed it.  And remeber you get 5cr off of \'Purest 
Green\' at Callahan\'s Irish-Vilani Pub and Grill with your ticket stub.

Well, yeah, okay, you can pick whatever numbers you like if you know what you want

end up with an officer.

On one hand, you could say books 4-7 were small and cheap. On the other, 
you could say they were priced consistently with the rest of the rules.

I\'m not sure anyone knows at this time.  Perhaps, perhaps not.  Largely,
this will depend on just how closely birds and dinosaurs are related.

What do dino-geneering and rejuvenation have to do with each other? In the
first case you recreate an organism from DNA fragments, or possibly create
a critter which looks much like a dinosaur from lizard & bird DNA. 
Rejuvenation is putting a living person in a vat and making them younger. 
Modifying an adult living being directly is a whole lot harder than
genetically engineering an egg cell. 

Also, total memory transfer involves electronically recording personality
and memories and replaying them into a new, young, body.  This is a whole
lot better than cloning and body and doing a brain transplant.  With the
option you are suggesting (cloning and brain transplant) you get a nice
young body and an old brain. I\'d rule that you would still make Int aging
rolls based of the age of the old body.  With total memory transfer you
get a new, young, body and a new, young, brain.  You could even end up
transferred into an alien body.

Why would we ever want to do that?  This has been clearly defined as fully
within the range of TL 14 genetic engineering.  The Solomani have uplifted
several species, just like the Ancients did.  Heck, the 3I genetically
engineered humans into several radically different forms (See DGP\'s TD #
12 & GDWs adventure Knightfall for examples). Hopefully, you are not
suggesting the 2nd Imperium reached TL 19. 

Just because the Ancients did something doesn\'t mean it *has* to be TL
19+.  The Ancients had genetic engineering which they used to modify
humans and create the Vargr.  The 3I could do the same thing, but they
have laws about modifying sentients.  The Ancients also had TL 19 advanced
bioengineering devices like vats where you could walk in human and walk
out a Vargr.  Such things seem like perfectly reasonable Ancient tech. 
Why would we want to limit Advanced bioengineering to be less powerful
than TL 14 genetic engineering.  My only question is that with current
advances in RW biotechnology I\'m wondering why it takes the #I until TL 14
to learn how to do genetic engineering, this seems more likely to be
developed at TL 11 or 12.  I *like* the "drop in a vat" option for TL 19.

I\'m trying to get away from the rank of Captain in the Marines.  Since the
main role of the Imperial Marine Force is to serve as shipboard troops, why
have a rank that mirrors a far more senior Naval rank?

By making the first three levels of officer ranks almost identical in name
between the Navy and Marines, you increase understanding of where you stand
in relation to the other guy.  A Navy Lieutenant will know that he is
outranked by the Senior Force Lieutenant across the room, while their might
be som,e confusion if a Marine Lieutenant (O-1) were intoduced to a Navy
Lieutenant (O-2) while in civies.  (This actually happened to me, I was
assigned to escort a Captain wearing civies.. I found out later he was a US
Navy Captain.. it does affect how you treat people!)

That\'s very good -- the Darrians were certainly dabblers in psionics,
but it\'s not as mainstream, routine, and dominant in their culture as in
that of the Zhodani and Droyne.

In my universe -- and probably in the canon -- the Darrian subsector is
one of the real hotbeds of spy vs. spy activity between Zhodani and
Imperial agents, lobbyists, agents provocateurs, contract hit sophonts,
etc., and it has been for a very long time.  The Darrians of course have
peepers in high places, so only the most sincere (or brainwashed)
diplomats are worth sending.

I posted my thoughts on law and justice in the Third Imperium (ca.
1100s) in several long posts quite some time ago (last fall?).  I don\'t
recall in which digest numbers they appear, but I think that it was
during a more general discussion of feudal technocracy and the political
economy of the Imperium.  The posts were fairly well received and you
can probably find them in the digest archive.  If I have time I\'ll try
to find them in my files, but I won\'t repost them.  

Marc is welcome to use them in published materials as long as I\'m listed
as a contributor or author.  

> protocols, the M0 equivalent of the Internet, yadayadayada...

MO equivalent of the Internet doesn\'t exist because there\'s no FTL
communications.  Each member state of high enough technology level has
some sort of internet.  The X-Boat system must be able to feed into and
from that system where it exists, so there has to be some standardization.

I have to admit that I\'m sufficiently sad (in the British sense of the 
word ;-) that I\'d buy whatever version you came up with, pretty much 
regardless of the cost. (Who? Me? Fanboy? ;-)

What I\'d probably do with the material - unless it was done for me - 
would be to point a Glimpse (or similar search engine) at it so as to 
be able to *find* the stuff I need in the text mass. So, plaintext or 
html is what I\'d like most. Html has the added benefit that it\'d be 
able to retain at least some of the formatting. Of course, I don\'t know 
if any OCR programs support it natively.

Either way, even though OCR programs are better these days than when I 
last used one, at least minimal editing/proofreading is neccessary. A 
bare minimum would be running a spell checker over the text. (And 
*geez* would that be a chore, what with all the Zhodani, Vilani, etc, 
words in the text. ;-)

One thought could be to offer an \'amnesty\' for those who have already 
done some of the work, ahem, \'privately\', for their own campaigns, if 
they sent in the scanned files they have. Or outright ask for help from 
traveller fans with scanners. It worked reasonably well for SJG when 
they wanted to put up issues of Roleplayer and ADQ on the web.

Oh, one final thought before I hit the sack, I\'d definitely want the 
TASJ and Challenge articles on the CD as well. While I have most 
issues, it\'d be *real* handy to have them on the web. (Actually I\'d 
want the Twilight:2000 articles as well, but that\'s another topic. ;-)

Yes, instead of whinning whos piont is right.
Why not sit down and hammer out some ROUGH guidelines.
Starting with Imperial history and then the true story.
(Y\'all know, PC and true history)
Then we can kludge most of the rest after that.

Yep, I fired that one off rather quickly.
I don\'t even agree and I wrote it.

Here is a Change on my origenal Idea.

The imperium establishs certain crimes as Imperial. Piracy, Treason, 
Murder 1, (including mass etc.) Etc.
Only these few Crimes and no other.

These Warrents are served by agents working for a Imperal agency, with
acompaning documentation, ie. a Imp. weapons permit, etc.

Yes and no, in most states the conntract between the Bondsman and the
client severly curtails the clients civil rights. The Bounty hunter
does not have as many limitations as a Cop would in apperhendind the
jumper. (thou escalation of force is a good line to follow)
Also the relationship is intresting in the fact that it is a Civil and
not a Crimmenal.

Yes, but certain crimes can all be considered offenses against the
Imperium,
and these are the ones a warrent would be issued.

Any Ideas on which crimes exactly?

I agree with this in principle, but think it should be possible, albeit
unlikely for a character of low social standing to make Grand Admiral. 
People have done it, risne through the ranks and thus it should be
possible.

Perhaps the Navy and Army should have DMs for promotion according to
social standing as the Marines do (in T4.1):

ie.

Navy promotion: 9- DM +1 if Edu 9+
                   DM +1 per social standing over A
Army promotion: 9- DM +1 if Edu 9+
                   DM +1 per social standing over A 

Example:  A 7788AC Naval character attempting to get promoted needs to
roll 9- with DM+3 (+1 for Edu A, +2 for SOC C).

Well?

Both of these sound like great ideas, but the problem I have, and the
problem I\'m having with most of the released T4 materials thus far is
their M0-centric ideas.  I know that the current milieu is M0, but when
they release further milieux are we going to have to buy, say a new
Aliens book (I\'m kind of jumping to conclusions, but how M0-centric is
Aliens), or a new whatever.

I think the problem stems from the attempt to write a book
\'in-character\', like in Emperor\'s Arsenal.  All the equipment in TLs13+
was \'conjectural\', etc. and didn\'t allow for people to have a full
selection of equipment up to say, TL17.  What I wanted was a textbook
like book of weaponry, instead of the in-character Army field guide we
got.

For some source books which are intended to be used throughout
Traveller\'s genres, the "in-character" outlook has to be dropped, or at
least changed for each tech level.  For instance, in the upcoming
Emperor\'s Vehicles, perhaps the chapters up to TL12 would be written in
M0 characters, while above that could be written as if by a M11000 guy. 
This would make us not have to release different versions of the same
book for each Milieu.

Anyhow, more on topic for the subject of new T4 books, I\'d like to see
the above ones Scott mentioned, especially the Imperium source book,
which would be very useful, if written well.  Also, as I\'ve said in
other threads, I would love something \'Mercenary\'-liked for T4 with Mass
combat, etc.  Perhaps it could be presented either in a book with
pullout cardboard \'troops\' an maps (pullout so that it is not necessary
to wrap the book in plastic), or in a small boxed set with plastic
figures and maps.  Besides this, I\'d also like to the "Megacorporations
& Syndicates" mentioned elsewhere.

Thanks,

I thought it was:  "I\'m Eneri the Eighth I yam/we\'ve been fighting the

This is how I do it, too, and it gives some good opportunities for
inter-service rivalry.  Getting the PCs stuck between the Navy and
Scouts can be a good push.  (E.g., the Navy hires the PCs as independent
contractors to do some investigation that the Scouts perceive as part of
their turf.  The Scouts think that the PCs are a foreign power, a
criminal organization, or Naval personnel exceeding their authority, and
respond appropriately.  This happens on a world far from the
administrative centers.)

Well, I own about 1/2 of the CT material (you should include at least the
Traveller Journals in that total), a small bit of the MT stuff, and none of the
TNE stuff, so *any* form of representation of the material would be a very
welcome reference source for me. I could easily live with the material in 
the form of .gif files if the resolution is high enough that they are totally 
legible. I especially like the idea presented of scanning them as .pdf files.
This would preserve the form of the material, but make them much easier
to use without much work on IG\'s part. This is definitely a "nice to have"
type of project rather than a "core of T4" project, so the budget costs
should be kept down. But for those of us who for whom time, financial,
and other constraints did not allow us to get the original material when
it was published, this would be a very nice way of filling in the holes in
our background materials.

Of course, nano-tech is a broad spectrum of things.  So is genetic

Basically, I\'m reading about really cool nanotech and bitek (bio-tech)

Since only 2% of Americans respond to surveys, this means that 100% of
survey respondants claim to have been abducted.  In my experience, that
seems about right.

Yeah! Let me know the price and I\'ll order it now! This is the way to a

I also noticed that someone mentioned Acrobat as an alternative. This
would be about one step below hypertext on my wish list!

Anything that can make this happen is a GOOD THING! Since losing my
originals of MT, and the fact that I never really followed MT, I keep
seeing references to things on this list that I\'d love to have. This
would do it all in a format that is ideal when writing and reffing
games! Please! Please! Pretty Please!

One of the things I saw as a positive to TNE was... the VIRUS! It
allowed computers artificial intelligence on a level Traveller never
approached before. I began writing the back round for a TNE, (post
virus) campaign that revolved around a "Pocket Empire" that was working
hard to CO-EXIST with the virus. The ship(s) would be characters in
their own right. It seemedd to me that they would provide the perfect
defense against having your ship "inhabitated" out from under you. Kind
of like a vaccine.
Now I know we\'re talking a big jump in TL, and I\'m not trying to start
that kind of debate. I just think that even expert system computers
could be a lot more flexable and powerful than are depicted in CT,MT, or
T4.

Hello,
  I begin to realize that not all of this stuff is on somebody\'s
hard drive. Life before desktop publishing must\'ve been fun.

  I believe the major cost element for producing the actual CD\'s
is pre-production and computer set-up; the actual CD (with case
and labelling?) should be around $2.00 (at least in the music
industry). I believe the previous poster is in publishing, so
obviously he would possess much more accurate info.

  Of course, the cost of getting material from paper or film
to disk seems to be where the problem is here. I don\'t know
how much time would be required to properly transfer graphics
or tables, but converting text (scan/OCR/double-check) can be
pretty fast. Re-editing, if necessary, and redoing the formatting
could possibly be the major text manipulation costs.

  I assume the financial barriers to eventually setting this up
would be the higher end tasks such as formatting and mastering
for production. If it were legal I could happily scan/OCR all
my books (except for the thick, bound ones) in about an hour or
two per LBB, but that wouldn\'t get me the convenience of buying
it in one package (and at far less cash cost than I could earn
in one hour per LBB).

  If all the CT books were on CD, I\'d cheerfully pay $50 or 60
bucks for it, or $20/disk for a 3 or 4 disk set - and I already
have all but one LBB. I may be crazy, but I have the money, and
that\'s the final issue if it does reach production. I suspect
there are enough Traveller fanatics around to justify it from
a business viewpoint, and the margin on mail-order sales would
be quite remarkable (relevant in the reasonable belief that
perhaps most customers for such a product would be those on
this list - at least initially).

  Sorry about the long, and not necessarily useful exposition.

        Yours truly,
                Steven Hudson

Scan in the images only; I would be happy with that. Not to mention that
there are packages available for converting images to text. Gives me the
ability to choose the segements I want for my image of the Imperium, and

Marc,

IMHO, just scan the material into images, then have something like an
autogenned set of HTML pages.  This offers the convenience of going to a
specific page without a great deal of overhead.  Store the images in uniquely
named files and match the images with pages.  Accepting that scanning the
pages is a great deal of manual work, the rest of the process could be fairly
well automated.  Given a standard naming convention, once the images are
scanned and a format is defined, the members of the list could help with the
assembly process (Yes, that means I\'m volunteering to help with the HTML)
then forward the results to you for compilation.

My two cents.

The thought was that the Star Trigger remained as a deterrent to overt action
by Zho against Darrians. Even if the Zho took over Darrian, could they be
sure they had caught a squadron of Star Triggers?

Better not to take the chance.

Remember that most modern bounty hunting is for bail-jumpers... people who

Mow, it remains to be seen what enabling legislation and treaty agreements

Reread Foundations of Traveller in the basic T4 book. I use that as a
reference. That said, I want to retain what has gone before as cannon, and
find ways to blend it in to what we\'re doing today. 

Sometimes logical extensions of poorly thought out previous material make it
illogical or untenable, and we have to find ways to disable it.

	I\'ve tried to scan TNE sector files, using professional
	equipment from ArtCom, and tried about a dozend diffent
	OCR system, but especialy those gray/white tables are
	very difficult. So I asked here (about a year ago) and
	got most wanted from the UseNet folk.

	Stoned idea :

	Perhaps the only low budget solution would be to make
	it open to the net and let the fans do the work.

	Scan the books and put them on a ftp/web server as hires
	GIF+OCR prescan. Give anybody a PERSONAL login on this
	server. Anytime somebody dowmloads a new page, he has to
	make the lectors job, and upload a edited version of
	the prescan.  If he dos\'nt, his download will become
	restricted to already lectored pages.

	This would be the job for only two regular people.

	Or even more "geruillia marketing": Make old Traveller
	books open to the Gutenberg project. A SciFiRGP partly
	under GPL would have a big impact to game industry.

        PROGRAM NAME: "GALACTIC" [v2.3] {July 1997}
        GAME SYSTEM: Traveller/MegaTraveller
        AUTHOR: Jim Vassilakos  (jimv@empirenet.com)
        FUNCTION: Sector Viewer/Generator
        SIZE: 3,153,415 Bytes
        OPERATING SYSTEM: IBM (MS-DOS)
	      (but windows will also run dos-applications)
        COMMENTS: Allows user to randomly generate sectors, displays
	      the maps in VGA, translates the UWP code to English,
	      and keeps campaign notes in text files which can be
	      accessed directly from the map. The maps all mesh
	      seemlessly. Includes lots of official and non-official
              sectors. Even includes world mapping and star system
              mapping software. Note, you must use the "-d" option
	      when unzipping:

                  >>>>>>>>    pkunzip -d gal23.zip    <<<<<<<<

Oh, and make sure you\'re using pkunzip 2.04g to do the unzipping.
If you have trouble getting Galactic, unzipping it, or whatever,
let me know. I\'ll be happy to postal you a set of floppies.

For those who have been using version 2.2, here\'s some of the new
stuff:

  * Jens Maskus contributed the Gateway Sector (originally by DGP)
  * idiot@sans.vuw.ac.nz contributed the Dagudashaag Sector (borrowing
    world names from work by v.m.patel@bradford.ac.uk) as well as the
    Core Sector (though this one is still largely in need of world names)
  * Lewis Roberts contributed updates to his TNE galaxy
  * Added automated jump route creation (F6) to subsector map
  * Added star system map creation (F9) to subsector map
  * Added dump-to-bitmap feature (F10) to various maps using
    SAVESCR v0.6 by Aaron Zabudsky <zabudsk@ecf.utoronto.ca>
  * Created galdata\\galhooks.dat file to control the calling of
    various subprograms by Gal. You can modify this file to hook
    programs that you have written into Gal, adding entirely new
    features to the software.

Due to overwhelming demand, the program is also available in
three diskette-(1.44meg)-sized chunks. Read the help file
at my homepage for info on how to deal with this version.

Hope you enjoy the program. If you find any bugs, please let
me know. I\'m going on vacation and will be gone until August
21st (no email... no nothing), but I hope to find a big pile
of email when I get back letting me know what you like, what
you hate, and what needs fixing :-)

Quick and Dirty Date Table
Rolling a random date for a year (eg. Birthdate) with standard dice at 
first seems easy. eg. roll percentile + (d3*100). Where d3 is d6/2 
dropping fractions. But this method skews dates, as the d3 is 
0,1,1,2,2,3. There is half the probability for a date less than 101 then 
for dates from 101 to 200. Even if d4-1 is substituted for d3, there is a 
greater probablility of a date 300-365 than there should be, as each roll 
of d4 is equally probable. If there were 400 days in a year, this would 
not be a problem.
Inspection of probability of dates, assuming equal probability for each 
date, gives:
                           Fraction of 
Dates     No. of Days    total (Approximate)   Fraction of 33
1-100         100              3/11              9/33
101-200       100              3/11              9/33
201-300       100              3/11              9/33
301-365        65              2/11              6/33
Total         365             11/11              33/33

So, all we need is an 11 sided die. Well, in this universe they are 
difficult to make, but knowing the probability table for 2d6:
die	Probability
2 or 12      1/36
3 or 11      2/36
4 or 10      3/36
5 or 9       4/36
6 or 8       5/36
7            6/36
Total       36/36

The following table may be used, simply add d100 to the value rolled on 
this table. Reroll d100 rolls greater than 65 when 300 is rolled on this 
table.
roll	# of days	Probability
3 or less	  roll again	        0 (you rolled it again)
4                0            3/33
5-6            100            9/33
7                0            6/33
8-9            200            9/33
10+            300            6/33
With this method each date will have (approximately) the same 
probability. Were there 366 days in a year, this method would be exact.

HEXADECIMAL NUMBERS CHART

This may seem picky, but you *really* should change the HEXADECIMAL NUMBERS
chart to TRAVELLER NUMBERS.  Everything is fine as long as your chart
doesn\'t go beyond F, but when you use G, H, J, etc you are no longer using
hexadecimal notation.  You could explain that in "Universal Profile System"
the first 16 numbers follow the hexadecimal notation and then continue with
letters in a similar fashion.  You should not refer to the chart as a
hexadecimal number chart, though.

A second concern on the same chart concerns the missing "I."  Sure, "I" and
"L" can be confused, but please don\'t skip "I."  It\'s used in sector charts
after all, and it\'s a perfectly nice little letter.  ;->


SCHOOL PREREQUISITES

EDU 6 is listed as Associate (I assume as in Associate Degree, ie 2 years
beyond High School).  I don\'t have a problem with that, within your system,
but I it raises some problems for me when it comes to the school
prerequisites.

University, Military Academy and Merchant Academy all have an EDU PreReq of
6+.  I suggest that should be dropped to EDU 5+ (High School Graduate) for
AT LEAST University and Merchant Academy.  Virtually all HS grads (assuming
HS graduation means what it should mean) can get into *some* sort of
college, and after some preparatory work can succeed at University level
work.  The Merchant Academy should be similar.

The Imperial Military Academy (currently 6+) probably should be more
restrictive EDU 5+, but why isn\'t the Imperial Naval Academy (currently 5+)
just as restrictive?  The Officer class of the Navy is going to need the
technical skills based on EDU every bit as much as the Army.

Personally, I\'d make the Military and Naval Academies Edu 6+ and Universtiy
and Merchant Academy Edu 5+.


TITLES

I\'ve got a problem with the official title for a PhD being "Professor."
Professor is (or should be) a rank in the SCHOLAR career.  [BTW, if you
included ranks for *any* of the careers in the file you sent me, they
didn\'t survive my conversion to Word 6 or RTF formats.]  I don\'t know if
you\'ve listed a career sequence for Scholars anywhere, but as an example,
I\'m listing *one* possiblity below..

    Undergraduate Student   -  working toward BS/BFA/BA
    Graduate Student        -  working toward MS/MFA/MBA
    ----
    Graduate Assistant      -  Masters and working toward PhD
    Instructor              -  Masters or PhD
    Associate Professor     -  PhD and "tenure"
    Assistant Professor     
    Professor
    ----
    Department Chairman     -  now you\'re getting into Admin positions
    Dean                    -  oversees a school within a college
    Provost                 -  oversees a college within a university

[If this this looks like University is *part* of the Scholar career, it
should! ;->]


WAVERS

Let me get this clear..*higher* SOC\'s have a better chance of succeeding on
a waver roll, that\'s cynical, but *OH* so true.  Frankly I\'d allow the
waver system to be applied to all careers, not just Scholar.  Doing this
would allow a general bumbler to become General Bumbler, if he/she has the
proper connections and a high enough social ranking.  Now, we wouldn\'t want
to *play* such a person...maybe ;->..., but it fits many of our favorite
NPC\'s to a tee.

I don\'t think so. You wouldn\'t be able to do text searches and whatnot 
unless the page was generated from the original postscript. In Acrobat, 
the letters are drawn on the screen using embedded or installed fonts, 
the text exists within the doc.

If you were to scan a page, you would get a bitmap. Sure, the .pdf would 
put it into a browsable format and add its own compression, but it would 
be no different than a GIF or JPEG. You would still need some sort of OCR 
to be able to edit and copy text...

That\'s the way I understand it...

Frankly, this is closer to the way I see things working. In a completely
egalitarian society competency matters, class doesn\'t, but the Imperium
(and social structures like it) aren\'t completely egalitarian. I can see
where a character\'s social class would put a limit on how far they could
advance.  

If the PC is SOC 5, let\'s say, then O5 is as far as they will normally go.
However, we need to take *exceptions* into account so...a SOC+1 might be a 
skill choice (but we\'d have to put a strict limit on how many SOC+1\'s a
player could choose), or maybe WAVERS could apply to promotions as well. 
Our SOC 5 PC makes his Promotion roll to O6, but before he can actually
advance he has to succeed on a WAVER roll (<= SOC) as well, and because of
the cumulative -DM on Waver attempts many low and medium SOC PC\'s will get
"stuck in rank" never really having a chance to advance to the Flag level.
In a more egalitarian society, you\'d make the SOC limitation less severe by
either not including the cumulative -DM\'s on WAVER attempts or dropping the
SOC limitation completely.

As for British Army\'s O6+ officers all being SOC B+, the question is are
they B+ because of their rank or in their rank because they are B+?  I\'d
guess it\'s more the latter than the former.  I\'m just guessing here, but I
bet you won\'t find many "cockney" accents in the Officer corps of the
British Military, and at Flag rank I\'d be surprised if you find *any* at
all. ;->

It\'s a little different in the US, but rising through the ranks from
private soldier to Flag rank is still rare enough to arouse comment.

Doug,

I like to play with structures too. ;->

There should be only one Captain aboard a ship, and that is it\'s commanding
officer.  Non-commanding officers aboard ship with the rank Captain are
given an honorary promotion while aboard so as to eliminate *any* confusion
over just who is Captain.  The Marines *should* use something like you
listed, but because Marine forces are most usually stationed aboard ship I
suggest dropping the Captain rank from their structure completely.  In
fact, how about dropping Captain as a *rank* in the Navy as well?  Take a
look at the following...

- -- 
     Imperial Marine Force     Imperial Army       Imperial Navy
- ----

O2  Force 1st Lieutenant      1st Lieutenant      Sub Lieutenant

O4  Force Major               Major               Senior Lieutenant
O5  Force Lieutenant Colonel  Lieutenant Colonel  Lieutenant Commander

O7  Force Brigider General    Brigider General    Commadore
O8  Force Major General       Major General       Rear Admiral
O9  Force Lieutenant General  Lieutenant General  Fleet Admiral
O10 Force General             General             Sector Admiral
O11                           Field Marshall      Admiral
O12                           Marshall            Grand Admiral

I\'d suggest dropping Captain from the army as well, but that would
probably cause a war.  ;-> Anyway, in the navy, Captain would define a
*position*, ie commander of a ship, not a rank.  By O3 naval officers
could begin to command ships, and would all be called Captain aboard
their own ships.  They would hold consistent ranks within larger force
structures that define their relationships with officers aboard *other*
ships.

Well, I don\'t have *that* book, but my favorite is the "skin suit" idea
that came from..I think..Larry Niven. 

It\'s the year 20??, and you are a "belter" looking for a new environment
suit, so you wander down to the local nanotech shop.  There you buy a
specially tailored starter-nano "skinsuit" from a technician that has been
uniquely targeted to your DNA.  Once you apply the "dab of goo", it uses
dead skin and ambient heat to build a thin "skin" of nanites over your
entire body.  Because it is targeted to your uniquely any that is rubbed
off just dissolves.  In use, the nanite "skin" is normally transparent, or
displays a pattern of your choice, allowing you to see, breath, eat, and
take care of other business as if it wasn\'t there, but all the while the
community of nanites are hard at work.  They thicken, thin and change
flexibility as outside air pressure change to maintain a normal internal
pressure.  They allow more or less heat to escape to keep your body
temperature at a comfortable level.  They provide a natural shade over your
eyes when light levels exceed set limits.  I seem to remember that they
also recycled CO2 to extend oxygen supplies. You just wear it *all* the
time either under your normal clothes or *as* your normal clothes.

The limitation was material and energy.  Because it used your body for
material and energy, and if it was internal as well as external (why not)
the nanites would have access to all the minerals and energy your body
produced, I could see it "eating you up" if you were in a low
resource/energy environment.  (It would pay to be *fat* so you could extend
your resources in emergency situations. ;->)

I don\'t know how reasonable it is, but it\'s a *neat* concept.  ;->

My second favorite nanite application is the "nanite wrap."  Seed an
airless rock of a planet/moon with some "habitat maker nanites" and wait a
few months.

The nanites replicate from materials in ground soil and solar energy
spreading rapidly across the surface.  After completely covering the
surface and linking into an airtight wrap the second stage begins.  Now the
nanites begin to break oxygen, nitrogen and carbon dioxide out of the soil
as the "wrap" slowly expands lifted by the airpressure.  After a while
there are is a partial-bar of pressure trapped inside the globe spanning
wrap floating hundreds of meters above the surface.  The "wrap" would be
tailored to absorb solar energy on it\'s outside and transfer heat and light
to the inner surface in just the right amounts to create "comfortable"
light and temperature levels.  Ships could slowly move through the wrap
allowing it to maintain it\'s seal, so that wouldn\'t be a problem.  Fast
moving hits, like Meteor strikes, would knock holes in the wrap, but the
nanites "seeking to maintain their link" would quickly close them before
major pressure drops could occur (remember this wrap covers an entire moon
or planet to hundreds of feet there\'s so much atmosphere under that wrap
that it would take a *long* time for it to dissipate even through a large
hole.).

	I\'d go for the third option. I don\'t see much point in removing
some material (game rules etc.); if you\'re going to publish a
CD-ROM, you don\'t pay for printing and page count doesn\'t matter 
that much. Removing the extra material might really become more 
expensive.

	IMO something like .PDF (Acrobat Portable Document Format) would be
ideal. The software is freely available for most platforms, .PDF
documents are easy to print out (I hate to have to use a computer to
look up something when running a game, I always print hardcopies of
everything), and you can easily make the paes look just like the 
originals.

Anything that made this simple to do and relatively affordable would be
great in my eyes. I could even live without the MT stuff. :) I suspect that
most people are like me, and have suffered from a degradation in their
collections of CT materials over the years. Just about everybody who played
the old game wouldn\'t mind something like this to fill in the gaps.
Legibility would seem to be the only real requirement.

I know about a half a dozen people who aren\'t even on this list who would
buy something like this without even thinking about it. I bet it would
really sell.

To compare to the US situation, each state is free to define its own 
criminal code, which from time to time will lead to similar 
situations where a fugitive is arrested on another state\'s warrant.  
The "arresting" state may well consider the law that the accused is 
alleged to have violated quite ridiculous, but extradition will 
proceed nevertheless.

However, in the Imperial arena, I would think that certain categories 
of law (e.g. murder, large scale theft/fraud, etc.) will be given 
Imperial sanction, decided on a law by law basis.  Sanction would 
permit enforcement by Imperial agents and/or assistance, perhaps 
taking the form of an Imperial Unlawful Flight to Avoid Prosecution 
warrant (technically, a seperate crime, but as a practical matter it 
is dropped after arrest to allow the defendant to be extradited on 
the "local" charge.)

"Non-sanctioned" law could then only be enforced within the original 
jurisdiction or by private agent (i.e. bounty hunter).

Not exactly.  There is a relatively obscure Federal law that grants 
bounty hunters some greater leeway than that normally allowed a 
private citizen (but I can\'t find anything handy... maybe someone 
else out there does?)

I would agree, but so that member worlds don\'t squawk *too* loudly, 
perhaps the Imperium would grant a modest degree of protection to 
properly trained and licensed bounty hunters.  However, any ad-hoc, 
unlicensed bounty hunters would get in very hot water with both local 
and Imperial law enforcement.

True, but as a practical matter, with the degree of federalization of 
the criminal law nowadays, if the FBI wants in on a case they can 
invite themselves in, locals be damned.  I would suspect the Imperial 
authorities would have a similar power (rarely used, not publicized, 
but darned useful in a crunch).

Description

	Produced by the independent company Westland-Grimm, the A-5 Gremlin
is a commonly encountered vessel. It is based on the classic Rule of
Man -era A-1 Tigram patrol boat (still produced by Odyssey, Inc., LIC
in large numbers); similar boats are a common sight in all of Terran
space.

	The A-5 is designed specifically for the needs of Federated Suns
Coast Guard and the Federal Customs Agency. It is used for orbital
security, customs inspections, as well as short-range patrolling. 

	However, the A-5 does not have wilderness refueling capabilities -
it is capable of emergency re-entry only. All A-5s are serviced and
refueled on orbit (nearly all starports have some orbital
components). Another interesting feature is that while the ship is
capable of accelerating at 4G for over 10 hours, prolonged high-G
maneuvers are not recommended: the TL 11 grav plates can only
compensate up to 2G. Because of this, the A-5 shares many features
with its pre-gravitic counterparts, including swiveling bunks with
G-webbing, a pair of powered towing rails running from engineering
compartment to the bridge, and a general feel of ruggedness rarely
felt aboard gravitic vessels.

Canon is more than just what was written, but also the manner of writing.
The old CT stuff by GDW presented material as fact of the game universe.
The MT stuff presented materials as though they were "Current best
knowledge" (a history of technology term, referring to stuff that you know
might be wrong, but nothing better fits), with the ref\'s library data
presenting "Facts". TNE had no consistent approach; The core rulebook was
"Fact", the RCVG was "Anecdotal", and H&I was "THis is all BS". RSB was,
much like MT, pretty well Current Best Knowledge.

Canon is also who wrote it. I give higher weight to GDW Products than
individual authors (Sorry, Marc). I also give higher weight for MT to DGP
than to individual authors; read the credits for MT and the staff list for
DGP and you will see why. Here\'s my basic hierarchy (Best first)
GDW Pubs (Except challenge)
DGP Pubs (including TD, MTJ)
GDW Authors (Marc, Loren, Keith & Keith, Chadwick, Nilsen[sp?])
DGP Authors (Keith, Fugate, Thomas, Caswell)
Other DGP and GDW Staffers
Gamelords Pubs
Traveller Chronicle
CHallenge Magazine
The Adjutant (for it\'s local area only)
Other Stuff for Traveller

(I like the Judges Guild sectors... a full domain sized are with little
imperial prescence... I was really miffed when the "Land Grannts" were
revoked, and Imperial Atlas didn\'t have listings for all worlds. So I
continued to use the JG Domain; although, you\'l note, I don\'t discuss them
in canon terms-- GDW Decanonized them, the ultimate source.)

I suppose that T4 should top the list, but I can\'t quite see it as the same
environment; the tone of writing is too much like WoD (Vampire, et al);
nothing is an absolute truth... thus there is no real "canon" there. T4
encourages wide interpretations, as it\'s as vague as CT was, but covers
MUCH MUCH more ground, and in much more depth. (I realize this looks to be
an oxymoron, but think about it... on three axis: Scope, Depth, truth)

An a side note: If you do a CD-Rom, please put all stuff in one collection,
including CT, MT, and TNE; in full text (maybe in acrobat?) in such a way
that it can be printed for use. Definitely put it in some cross-platform
standard file type and disk type. I\'d buy it. I suspect Peter Newman would
too, and I know 3 others in Anchorage who\'d buy it. Also, if you can, get
as many of the non-gdw pubs into it as you can, too. Make it the most
complete thing you can, and it will sell (slowly) for years... as long as
Traveller continues to attract new players of ALL editions! Note: Acrobat
Reader is available for Unix, Mac, and Wintel... at no cost to the user
from the internet.

While 5. would be everyone\'s dream I\'m sure, I appreciate it would cost...

So, I\'d settle (a little reluctantly) for 1. as a useful archive and hope
for 2 which would be terrific.

I don\'t think we can expect you (or anyone else) to edit the text - it
would be extremely hard, IMO, to know where to stop when it comes to
choosing between typographic errors, errors of fact, errors of ommission,
things you wish hadn\'t been said at that point, things you wish *had*.  If
you were really to start editing it, I think you\'d have another life time\'s
work on your hands.

Besides which, if this is to be a reference archive perhaps it *should*
contain what was actually published so we know what\'s what.  (Or what was).

This problem has been recognised (by CORE) - the Aliens book has, to my
knowledge, been written from a fairly neutral viewpoint and should be usable
for any Milieu. As I noted in a previous post, the Vargr section has bits
written by people in the 100s, 200s and 1100s, so as to provide the complete
history. However, having sections written by the different \'authors\' does
provide the reader with a better idea of how their views of such a race
varied with time.

However, the obvious test will be to hear your reactions when it hits the
shelves (before the end of August, I hope!) :-)

Way too space intensive

Very low density method; conversion would be good. Maps, drawings, and
Illos should be in there too.

BTW: Roger mentioned something about having some of the MT stuff still
around on disk... might be easier to check with DGP on that stuff (the
contract work for GDW on MT).

Face it, some editing will be needed.

Please, no.

>Scan every page and convert to text, then make it hypertext.

Not really needed, IMHO. Would be nice... and if it is standard HTML, most
machines now come with a browser...

I\'d like to see a single disk, with something like the following

Etc.

For ease of reading (if text, or hypertext), keep all names to the 8+3 of
dos, no special characters, as dos, win, and macs can handle that easily,
as can most unix\'s, on an ISO9660 CD. That way, anybody with a WWW browser
(except certain versions of MS IE) can launch the browser, and look at it
easily, especially if an index page is written (doesn\'t need to be fancy,
in fact, smoother and simpler is usually better.)

I remember it well, the skills of working from galeys and traditional
film stripping have been pretty much lost now. But more to the point,
virtually everything before 1985 would have been produced using these
old fashioned methods

The major costs for *any* form of publishing are the set up, actually
putting ink on paper (or magnetism on disk) are relatively small. The
economies of scale are truely staggering in the publishing industry.

Sorry but the costs would be a lot more than $50 to 60, start
thinking three figures, I\'d say $250 to 350 is a more realistic
ball park.

As a TNE player, I\'m very interested in old Traveller books (I\'ve several
MT). For example I would like the alien modules and other books. Adventures
is also very important. Alsthough playing in the New Era, I surely could GM
a MT adventure (and even a CT one but I\'ve no book at all to describe the
setting)

I disagree with those who want to trash the rules. I\'m very interested to
see what has been used in previous systems to use the best one in my
opinion. So as a general statement I would much prefer the complete books.

I agree with those who want the different journals articles related to
Traveller universe. Official background is always wellcome (euh...
non-official too)

Now for the format : 
I really dislike the Image (Gif/Jpg) format. It\'s hard to handle, it\'ll
need personnal OCR software to convert it. Using a picture viewer to read
text from a book is, IMO, a non-sense...

I would pefer the HTML format as it is easily handled. There is no need of
extremly hyperlinked such as many web site. A simple but complete index
pointing on different book/chapters/titled paragraphs is sufficient. Simple
HTML is better.

I\'m sure that OCR software could do that. Or even HTML editors could handle
it quite rapidely. Further more, HTML files are easily converted to texte
files (every browser can do it)

So, my opinion is :
1- All stuff (CT, MT, TNE and magazins), with rules and drawings
2- Simple HTML format with arrays and pictures

PS : don\'t forget the (colored if possible) front pages. 


This CD is a marvellous idea .... please continue adn release it.

It depends on what you mean by nanotechnology.  Creating things with 
a particular (usually regular) nanostructure is done now.  Drexlerian 
nanotechnology I\'d put at about TL25 (with some easier applications 
being earlier).

Twenty, IMNSHO.

It is my suspicion that "bitek" is the way nanotech will be 
implemented in the hypothetical future -- much clunkier than the 
nanites predicted by Drexler et al., which is why it will work ;-)  
It may be that it can be used to produce metal superstructures, which 
will look "grown" because sharp corners are harder to do.

My main point of scepticism is the rod logic used to control nanites. 
I think Drexler has made the engineer\'s assumption that a structure 
is a structure, and stays where it is put.  This is simply not true 
on the nanotechnological level, and proper alignment of a rod logic 
system is difficult when adding a new cog will shift the positions of 
all the other ones.  Indeed, *moving* a cog will change the positions 
of nearby ones, whether or not they touch.

The "molecular cranes" to move atoms about are also IMO impossible to 
implement on the scales required.  Firstly, picking up single atoms 
is tricky (tho\' not impossible), but secondly getting atoms to stay 
where they\'re put is atrociously difficult.  Structures will 
spontaneously rearrange, unless kept insanely cold.

Now, if you allow really complex psionic manipulations of matter, 
building complex objects on the nanotechnological scale would be 
possible, so Ancient artifacts could indeed be miracles of 
miniaturisation.

Not true! They are *many*, but *very*, VERY far apart. 

Still, if you are willing to search sphere 100 to 1000 AU across, you
should find something useful.

Image only is acceptable, but converted to text (and edited for OCR
"glitches") would be preferable. Hypertext would be heaven, but I\'d
prefer it to be complete, even if some of the material had been
superceded.

	With "editing" in mind, if one uses OCR to scan and interpuret the scanned
text, it is undoubtedly going to contain SOME errors.  Often enough scanned
text is incorrectly identified.  (E.X. \'y\'s are translated as \'v\'s and \'q\'
as \'g\' and so forth.)

>Besides which, if this is to be a reference archive perhaps it *should*

	I believe this was the intention of the statements of editing.  I also
agree that the text should contain all of the original information as
presented and this editing would ensure that it does reflect the written
word.

	A traveller CD-ROM will sell like hot cakes in my area (Cleveland, OH.) 
The new T4 sales have gone through the roof in most of the local hobby
stores that actually carry the IG stuff.  I\'m sure that most of those
people are not on this list, and so have no idea that this type of thing is
going around.  I can think of at least thirty people that I know first hand
who would die to have this type of product.

   [Quoting Leroy]

   THE big flaw with canonism is that you need a consistent canon to
   start with.  In order to have that, you need at minimum a definition
   of what the canon is.  Without this, debates about what is canonical
   are completely useless.  Since there is no longer an agreed-upon
   definition of canon on the TML, these debates inevitably degenerate
   into posing and ax-grinding.

> That\'s why Canonists find MMT a bit more than frustrating--it doesn\'t
> agree with Traveller on some pretty basic issues.

   Wow, deja vu. This paragraph made me think back to a time when there
   /was/ a definition of canon on the TML.  That definition was: `Canon is
   anything printed in one of the Little Black Books by  GDW.\'  Like all
   canons, this definition was arbitrary and agreed-upon.  The term was
   introduced in order to help discuss the relative merits of CT and MT. 
   In those days, you might hear someone like me say something like (and
   I paraphrase 8^):

`If you want to talk *Traveller*, there is a great deal of consensus
on a wide variety of issues dealing with the background material. 
That\'s why Canonists find MEGATRAVELLER a bit more than frustrating--it doesn\'t
agree with Traveller on some pretty basic issues.\'

   Actually, by the definition of canon I stated above, T4 agrees with
   canon quite well, better than MT ever did.  As a confirmed canonist,
   I don\'t find T4 frustrating at all.

   Now obviously, only a few of the older fogies here on the TML would
   find such a definition of canon to their liking.  Most people here, I
   suspect, would include all of DGP\'s publications in their definition
   of canon.  But if you do that, then you run into a problem with the
   consistency requirement.  MT was not completely consistent with CT. 
   An inconsistent canon, like a `canon\' that is not agreed-upon, is
   pretty useless as a tool to help resolve hot-blooded debates.

   Since there is no agreed-upon definition of canon, and the commonly
   cited canons are often inconsistent with each other, I believe that
   the debates which have raged across the TML which use and abuse this
   term have been less than illuminating.  My advice, should anyone
   happen to care to hear it,  would be to adopt one of the following
   conventions regarding canon:

   1)  `Canon: just don\'t do it.\'
   2)  Canon: anything published by IG (although this runs into
   sector-data-vs-history consistency problems).
   3)  Canon: The LBB\'s  ---- same as it ever (or once?) was.
   4)  Canon: The Word of Marc.

Although i don\'t know so many people who would buy that CD, i figure 
that by making it in a smaller format, one could also put more on the 
CD, so Hypertext would be good, PDF would be better (as it retains 
formatting)(Not scanned directly to PDF, but after editing...). 

Now my suggestion: 
How about throwing in with Roger from the new DGP and do a joint 
venture. He wants to do it anyway, so you could split the cost of the 
work, split the effort in half. The CD would then contain everything 
from GDW and DGP in one easy volume, be cheaper for you to create. 
Maybe even contact the authors of the Judges Guild, Fasa Gamelors and 
Seeker (and others) to include their stuff as well.
Bwahahahaha, i want it all!!!!!!Everything, Bwahhahahaha!

You\'re absolutely right!  The Idea of "Force ranks" are excellent.  I guess I
just love the sound of Star Marshal and Colonel General though.  Both invoke
the image of Imperium, at least to my mind.  One little side note to enlisted
ranks, the E9 rank Sergeant Major of Sector should be recognized thusly:
 Sergeant Major of Deneb Gerhard Hessler or Sergeant Major of Diaspora.

Sounds like Marc liked your ideas as well.  Hopefully, they will be
instituted.

The simplest way is to use pay grades (E and O ranks). When I was in the
Army, we routinely called soldiers E3 or E4 as their rank. Then someone
finally got into power who put his foot down and said it was disrepectful
even of a lower rank to refer to him (or her) by pay grade rather than formal
rank name. Which is true... that guy worked to get to be Private First Class
(and we wanted him to work to get to Private First Class) and then we ignored
it and called him E3.

But it\'s so much more interesting to have a group of naval officers on the

So, faced with the challenge of picking a random date out of 365, you tried
some die rolling that made sense, analyzed it, and found it not entirely
satisfactory.

That gives one data point in favor of a chart for random date determination.

Now I\'ll add a second. I rarely see people actually picking birthdates or
other important dates in their characters\' lives. Everyone could pick dates,
but I want them to really pick dates, and the random chart is a push to do
that .

I accomplish that by making it part of the procedure. It just happens to take
a page to do it.

CD pressing costs are not a real problem. The problem is the scanning and

I always assumed that the Ancient\'s uplift projects were much better
than the Solomani\'s. The Ancients turned wolves into the fully bipedal
Vargr, while the Solomani, mearly tweaked the Dolphins, Orcas, Apes
Elephants and whatever other species they uplifted. The species are
more intelligent, their maniuplative members are more sophisticated,
they have probably altered them so that they can speak some language.
But they are still rather similiar to their original form.

You know, someone just aprised me of past discussions about the Droyne,
among other things.  I do not know what was said here, but my recollection
of reading _all_ the stuff about the Droyne was that they were not known to
be collectively one race in M0.  It was only after years of Imperial
sophonotologists piecing things together that they learned that all these
worlds scattered about with Chirpers and Droyne, were in fact one race.

Also, I and at least two others know where the Droyne homeworld was. :)

    'body' => 'My players are currently engaged in a modified version of the
classical "Rescue on Ruie" scenario.
A rich merchant asked them to visit a TL3, Pop-5 nation on a
planet just outside Imperial space and try to free his son which
has been imprisoned by local authorities.
They must free him or, if this seems to be too dangerous for the
prisoner, should try to collect as many data as possible on his
whereabouts in order to later organize a full scale mercenary
operation.
The patron said he couldn\'t be directly involved because his
company is currently facing an hostile takeover attempt by a
rival corporation.

The PCs are currently visiting the local capital, and trying to
discover where the prisoner is kept. They are also considering
alternatives to violence, like bribing or offering a ransom for
the young man. Play is currently suspended and will restart at
the end of August.

What the PCs don\'t know is that the rival corporation has
discovered what happened to their patron\'s son, and have already
prepared a full scale mercenary assault on the city.

What I\'d like to discuss is the mercenary tactics and any
suggestion you may have on the scenario. I think that the
players would try to help the locals to repel the assault, or
perhaps they would try to use the enemy\'s attack as a diversion for
freeing their target.

The City:
- ----
It\'s a lightly fortified "medieval" coast town. The local chief
mansion (where the hostage is held) is on a small island facing
the main port. Local troops are loyal and motivated but can\'t
really compete (they have Tl-3/4 weaponry and armours, with a
limited number of Tl-5 rifles).

The Mercenaries:
- ----
They have 3 walkers (taken by the T2300 equipment guide, if you
are unfamiliar with these, just think of the 2 legged walkers in
the _Return of the Jedi_ movie). Two of them will attack the
main gates, the third one will enter the city walking on the
river bed (remaining underwater until the last moment).  They
are armed with lasers(see down for more on weaponry, though) and
HMGs, have a rigid armor of 9 and can operate for 15+ hours.
The walkers will act as a diversion, and have been chosen in
order to give the maximum psychological effect on the natives
("Iron Covered Monsters! Aieeee!").
While the walkers attack, two Gcarriers will fly to the island,
strafe it with their AP weapons and then one of the two will
discharge 20 men while the other attacks the waterfront.
The attack will start at midnight, this way the mercs will have
(on top of the others advantages) the ability to easily fight in
the dark thanks to their advanced combat gear.
The Mercenary commands would like to minimize casualties and has
taken a certain number of precautions to this end. Here is a
summary of the main plan:

a) No laser will be used. They could easily starts fires in the
   town, and with the local TL this could causes enormous losses.
b) The mercenary force will disembark from shuttles and march
   over the city in the morning. At noon two walkers will perform some show
   of strength (opening fire against a carriage or a tree, for
   example, but trying to avoid casualties) and then they will
   deliver an ultimatum to the town guards: they have until
   midnight to release the hostage.
c) The mercs will explicitly state that they prefer the hostage
   to be alive, but they will settle for a corpse if there is no
   other alternative. This is true, even if a living man would get 
   them an high bonus.
d) No ortillery will be used against the town. There are various
   political and logistic reasons for this. The Mercs will not
   get orbital help of any kind.
e) At midnight the two walkers will open fire against two gates
   and try to enter the city. The third one (which is under the
   river) will enter the city and re-emerge inside, spreading more
   caos. The Walkers crews will try to act as a diversive and
   generally limit themselves to property damage, unless fired
   upon.
f) At 00:10 the two Gcarriers will fly over the city and then
   attack the island, releasing 20 combat ready troops which will
   try to conquer the mansion and look for the prisoner and/or the
   ruler of the city.
   
What would you do if you were the PC?
There are 3 PCs, armed with sidearms and laser carbines (their
original mission called for covert investigation instead of full
scale war). They have explosives, tear gas and smokes bombs. A
fourth NPC (retired scout who has married a local) will be able
to help them, but he, too, has no access to heavier weapons.
The gas will probably be of little help against the attackers.

Their biggest asset is their Scout class starship which is
currently hidden on the sea floor just outside the port. They
can reach it with their Air-raft. The ship systems have been shut
down, so the Mercs will miss them during their recon flights.

So, what would you suggest? I\'d like to have as many idea as
possible, in order to better judge any plan the PCs could
devise.

Is it possible, for example, to use the starship Laser against
the G-Carriers? 

What about mines, boobytraps, using their air-raft as a
weapon...

The star trigger was a high TL device developed by the Darrians, back when
they were at TL 17+. It induces huge flares, almost nova-like, in the star
it was aimed at. The _reason_ the Darrians are no longer at TL17+ is
because the were aiming it at _their_ star when they figured out what it
really did. (IIRC It was originally designed as a stellar probe for
astonomical purposes) They sorta torched themselves.

the Darrians still possess working star triggers. Oddly enough, everyone
leaves them the hell alone. ;-)

At that level, everybody should have been warned that MF/SGT Eneri was on

Among soldiers it does make for a convinent shorthand (I\'m E-3, Davis over
there is E-4 promotable, Jimmy got busted to E-1 for telling the Sergeant
Major what he thought of the Army..)  But for higher enlisted ranks, and
formal situations (formations, reporting, etc..) you need the named rank.

C\'mon Marc, we\'re both Army vets.. we *know* the USMC make no sense
whatsoever.  To sound a bit bold, I\'m taking this chance to try and give a
little flavor to the Imperial Marines.. eliminating the rank of Captain
might have come from German influences on the early Terran Confederation,
or just have been down during a reorganization  to streamline things.
Remember, our current E1-E9 enlisted structure didn\'t exist until 1958.

I imagine Sr. Force Lieutenants will be addressed as "Skipper" by their
troops, to show that as far as they are concerned, HE is the commanding
officer around here.  The company S/SGT will be addressed as "Top", Gunnery
Sergeants as "Gunny" and Naval Officers will be called "Sir" only after a
half-second pause to consider if they really deserve it.

An interesting book; surprisingly travelleresque in some aspects
(jump drives that have to be activated beyond a certain distance from a 
planet, loose interstellar government with member worlds witht their own
sub-governments and militaries, scuzzy free trader/mercenaries.) One could
easily use Traveller (especially TNE) to game in that background if you
added rules for all the biotech stuff (*really* cool biotech starships - 
I should try and write FFS rules for them.) Moderately recommended (the 
actual *plot* is a bit disappointing.) 

Space combat in particular seems very traveller-like; ships with accelerations
of several Gs (no G-comp for most ships), lasers and missiles (elaborately
sophisticated missiles called "combat wasps" are the dominant weapon), no
shields. Some of the space scenes were probably influencing me in writing
my soon-to-be-posted Definitive Sensor Rules.

I agree that there should be a standard, random method to determine
dates. Dates are important for aging. If we get picky enough to count
cold sleep weeks (we should) then it\'s necessary to have a random method
to determine birth dates.

One thing I thought about, though, was why should everyone start their
first term at 18? There are late bloomers that start school later, or
are held back a grade or two, and there are early bloomers who wiz
through school skipping grades... perhaps a random element to the year
could be implemented? 

Maybe 2d6, with a 2 signifying -1 year, and a 12 signifying +1 year?

Also, wouldn\'t certain races start at different ages? Has that been
taken into account? For instance, would Vargr start their first term
younger?

Marc, this is why I DO NOT like the idea of awarding set EDU levels\'s for
completion of various schools.  If you insist on doing this *please* don\'t
use EDU as a contributing characteristic in task resolution.  Done this way
EDU can be a description of how much schooling the PC has had, but that\'s
all.  Every other characteristic measures abilities, but the way you want
to use EDU it measures time sitting in a classroom, and time sitting in a
classroom doesn\'t measure how well you can use skills you *supposedly*
learned while sitting there.  It just doesn\'t!  I\'ve argued this point
before and didn\'t get anywhere, but *please* look at it again.

My suggestion is that the PC gets a +1 to their current EDU on graduation
from University (and various other schools) rather than jump them to some
arbitrary level.  I would limit advances to extremely high EDU levels by
changing the instructions to something like:  

  On Graduation from University, "If EDU is less than 7 then +1."  
  
  On Graduation from Grad School, "If EDU is less than 8 then +1."
  
  On Graduation from Med School, "If EDU is less then 9 then +1."  etc

This way a low EDU PC would improve from time in schools, but their EDU
would still be lower than a medium or high EDU PC.  A PC with naturally
high EDU stays a high EDU PC with all the benefits that entails, but
doesn\'t increase to EDU-monster levels.  Whether you should limit Honors
EDU awards this way or not, I\'m not sure.

About the wavers, I see two possiblities:

A. You could just require a seperate Waver for *each* of the prereqs needed
to get into a school.  With Med School you have two prereqs:  BS or BA and
Int 9+.  Lord Duphus (SOC 12, EDU 3) wants to get in and has neither of the
prereq, so he has to perform a waver roll for each, the 1st at < (12-1) and
the 2nd < (12-2).  He has very good odds of getting in, but those wavers
are starting to build up on him, and if you don\'t arbitrarily boost his EDU
to 9, he\'ll end up be a pretty poor doctor. (Think Frank Burns.  ;->)

B. You could disallow wavers against certain kinds of prereqs.  Perhaps you
can wave an attribute level, but not a prior degree.  This way Lord Duphus
would have to go through University to get that BS/BA (probably on a waver
or two), before doing the Med School (again probably with a waver or two).

Hypertext or PDF is the way to go with this kind of thing, IMHO.  As for
the scanning and converting part, why not steal a page from TSR?  They got
volenteers to scan and OCR the modules they put out on the web, no doubt
saving themselves a lot of time and money.

Yeah, same here, I\'d buy it.  I have virtually all the CT books, but I
don\'t have much MT stuff.  I\'d love to find a copy of World Builder\'s

I should think so.  I\'d be happy with good JPEG images of every page, and
all the text in simple ASCII format.

Images in JPEG or GIF could be printed as a graphic or run through a
personal OCR program and edited, and ASCII text is *always* good. Sure
ASCII isn\'t sexy, but it *is* universal, easily printable, storable,
compressable, editable, and searchable. Once you start applying *any*
preformatting you start making it hard for *somebody* to handle the
document. Give me pure text, and *I\'ll* format it. Shoot, WORD and WP have
automatic formatting that works pretty well for heaven\'s sake. ;->

PDF is OK, but frankly I\'m not all that enamored with it.  I\'ve never had
much luck printing pdf files on dotmatrix printers and even with better
readers like Ghostscript screen displays are clunky..on my system anyway.  

HTML *looks* better on my screen, but doesn\'t always print well, and if you
use HTML make sure you don\'t use the latest and greatest version. Stick to
*very* simple formatting, no frames, no tables! Yes, almost everybody has a
browser, but the browsers we all have aren\'t all equally advanced or work
alike.

The way my characters usually find stuff in deep space is as follows.  

  0) Preparations: 

    a) Make *certain* your ship has enough jump fuel and provisions.  

    b) Remove the thermonuclear warhead from a nuclear-detonation-laser 
      missile.  Rig the warhead for remote control (command) detonation 
      and for production of radio/maser waves (instead of the usual xrays 
      generated for the laser system).  

  1) Jump to a particular coordinate in deep space.  

  2) Place the warhead outside the ship.  Activate its beacon.  

  3) Jump back to the system being used as your base of operations.  
    Refuel.  Restock provisions (as needed).  

  4) Jump back to the deep space coordinate (hex number) but aim for a
    point 10 to 50 AU away from the warhead.  

  5) Have your Passive EMS sensor array standing by.  Send the "detonate" 
    command to the warhead.  

  6) The warhead detonates.  The radio/maser waves bounce off any object 
    within several hundred AU, and the "echoes" are picked up by your 
    Passive EMS array, giving you a position fix on these objects.  

That\'s it, in a nutshell.  Basically, you use an H-bomb as a very powerful
radar pulse.  :-)

As I see it, worlds are required to assist the Imperium in upholding the
laws of the Imperium.  It is up to the individual planet how much they want
to help, and up to the Imperium how much it wants to grief the planet as a
result.

Crimes are divided in the Imperial code into high crimes, which always rate
death or life imprisonment, felonies, which usually rate some years on a
prison planet, and misdemeanors, which rate lesser penalties.  Someone with
an Imperial felony is barred from holding command on an Imperial warship,
and is often barred from carrying weapons on member planets.

The Imperium may not recognize all of the high crimes and felonies of
member planets, likewise, a member planet may not recognize the Imperial
crimes.  If the planet chooses not to recognize it, the Imperium may swear
out warrants, and use eminent domain to get it enforced regardless, and may
use that to protect the people who enforce Imperial law.  (In my universe,
the Imperium has eminent domain over all crimes, if it chooses to exert it.
 Often, that is politically unwise.)  The Imperium especially prefers
member worlds to execute murderers, and soon, as then it does not need a
full court system, nor does it become a bone of contention.

Note that executions on member worlds are subject to Imperial review, and
that Imperial review often comes with a free Battleship attached.

Nobles, in general, are acting representatives of the justice system, and
that a member planet is required to render appropriate honors to Imperial
nobles.  Wise planets often include legal enforcement powers in those
honors.  In many cases, the planet and the Imperium will arrange for senior
legal officials on the planet to get Imperial noble titles, which leads to
the Imperium having a pretty good way of getting the planetary justice
system to do what it wants.

Bounty hunters are a way for a planet to get a law enforced on someone who
skipped the planet.  The Imperium supports this because it lets them put a
layer of deniability over things - "Sr. Ricardo was acting as a private
citizen and registered bounty hunter when he dragged your president 8 pc.
to Sylea, where he faces extortion charges.  Why yes, Ricardo is a Marine,
but he was on extended leave.  No, Naval Intelligence has no special
interest in this case."

Dangerous as all hell, though.  Any planet which hears that nobles are
going to be appointed over their heads arbitrarily is going to think
seriously about some warmongering.  (This may not bother Cleon and co., and
might explain why they bypassed all of the valuable systems in their mad
expansion.)  On the other hand, if it was presented as a way of turning
your local authorities into Imperium-wide ones, then they locals might take
notice.

I phrase it as "any world which joins the Imperium will receive a certain
number of patents, of which some will be filled by the Imperial
negotiators, some by the Imperial functionaries, and most by citizens of
the world as determined by the course of negotiations."  On the other hand,
any world joining is required to give up some fraction of the surface, some
fraction of the near space, and some fraction of the planets in the system
to Imperial exploitation.

Definitions first: Nearspace is anything from edge of atmosphere to 100
diameters, farspace is beyond 100 diameters, airspace is the atmosphere,
and surface is the obvious.

Planets give up about 10% of their surface and 5% of their GNP to the
Imperium.  The Imperium can use this to create noble fiefs, or for other
nefarious purposes.

Any place a planet cannot reach and protect is up for grabs, in most cases.

I divide worlds into several categories:

Category I - Uninhabited: these worlds can be owned lock, stock, and
barrel.  Any chartered company which files an application can get virtually
total and complete access to it.  The Imperium may demand a fraction of the
surface, or they may demand a share in the ownership of the company
controlling it.

The Imperium may recognize several claimants to a Category I world, in
which case, they must share the surface reasonably peaceably.  This can get
very ugly.

More often, the Imperium does an audit to find out what capability the
proposed owners have to control nearspace, farspace, and the world itself.
If the company will commit to defending against pirates, and so on, then
the Imperium will usually grant them control over whatever bodies they lay
claim to.

Depending on the economic assessment of those bodies, the Imperium will
demand a certain tax levy.  It is very much in the interest of the owners
to make that levy.  If they fail to improve the world appropriately, or the
Imperium feels they cannot control it properly, they may rescind control of
certain parts of it, or at least drop Imperial backing.

You can dramatically improve your position, and even give them force of law
by offering a portion or the world surface and any nearby celestial bodies
to the Imperium in perpetuity for scout and naval facilities.  In addition,
if you give more land over to the Imperium than is required by law, they
will place noble estates on it, and then protect you proportionately more.
The risk, of course, is that the nobles will then be above your own law.

In general, if you have a decent fleet of SBDs and defenses, then you can
easily lay claim to an uninhabited world.  Trying to get the entire system
requires showing that you have the population and the means to hold it, and
this is very unlikely for less than a hundred million people at tech 12.

It is very much in the interest of the colonizing group to become an
Imperial power as soon as possible, as then they are only responsible for
preventing piracy and performing reasonable rescue.  Two pirate 800t
cruisers might be enough to summon the Navy, or at least get an outpost
moved there.

The person or company who brings such a world in is likely to have several
dozen knighthoods created, with a Barony above them.  The Baron will be in
charge of exploitation of the world until the population rises.

Class 2 - pre space flight, ex Imperial:  These worlds have no claim beyond
their atmosphere.  The Imperium does not have a prime directive, but does
not wish to unduly displace native peoples.  As they are outside the
Imperium, there are few rules on your behavior, but accusations of genocide
are not taken lightly.

Once you have a recognized trade agreement, you may be appointed the
Imperial negotiator.  This will allow you to form binding agreements with
the world.  One might think this is a bit biased, as you stand to profit
the most, but the Imperium wants members.  They will demand that the people
in question be aware of the rights/responsibilities, but there is little
they can do if you decide to exploit them, as long as you do not go over
the line.

If a trading company gets an exclusive trading contract, and they have the
resources as noted in the Class I section, then they can apply to become
the government of the planet - this will, of course, involve the
cooperation and co-opting of the present government.

It is likely that such a planet will be made into 3 Baronies, with several
dozen knighthoods.  The Imperium will consider it appropriate for the
current rulers of the planet to acquire one of those Baronies, and many of
the knighthoods.  One of the baronies in question will be turned over to
the Imperium to administer as they see fit, along with a number of
knighthoods.

Class III: pre space flight, Imperial.

As class II, save that they are better defended by the Imperium, and you
have more recourse if someone tries to take over.

Note that, in general, class Ii planets have title to only those other
bodies in the system that they have physical presence on.

Class IV: Nearspace capable:  These represent worlds which are capable of
defending the home planet, but cannot control the entire system.

These will either be near TL12, but with a pop of 6 or less, or they will
be higher pop, but with TL of 9 or less.  (high pop planets can often buy
sufficient resources to control and defend their planets.)

Such planets have a thousandth the GPP of a Sylea, and thus are not
considered terribly important, save for future development.  Since they are
reasonably populous, they will often have up to several hundred Baronies on
the surface, and several thousand knights.  It is possible that these will
be assembled into a County.  If this is done, the County will own half the
land given to the Imperium, and lesser nobles the rest.  The lesser nobles
pay fees to the Count.

Worlds that have space flight, whether through native technology or not,
may apply to the Imperium for Nearspace control permits.  If you have such
permits, then you can buy warships, and are expected to patrol those areas.
 A world with a Nearspace permit has roughly 10% of the planetary bodies in
the system under its control.

Class V Farspace Control:
High tech worlds with pop 8, or average tech worlds with pop 9 are usually
given farspace control permits.  They are expected to control the system
they are in, and as a result, they have immediate title to roughly a third
of it, as well as those parts they have a permanent presence on.  You will
almost certainly see several Counties come out of this.  Particularly nice
ones may be a Marquis\' seat.

Class VI System Control:
High tech worlds with pop 9, and any space flight capable worlds with pop A
are usually given system control permits.  They have title to most of the
system.  They also have to defend it, so most of them are quite willing to
let people come in and exploit, in return for agreement to be under the
local laws.  This is the kind of world that becomes a Marquis\' seat, with
the associate array of Counties, Baronies, and so forth.

Once again, only 10% of the world belongs to the Imperium, but the people
chosen for these positions will often be in a position to purchase up a
great deal more of the planet as time passes, and thus they will grow their
domains.  On the other hand, those people then are responsible for paying a
larger share of the tax burden of the world, so it is in the world\'s
interest to have noble feifs.

I play it that nobles get a better tax rate than the world would get in
general, and that the world splits the difference, so if the world would
pay 5% of GNP, and a noble would pay 3%, then any lands under noble control
feed 1% of the GNP back into the planetary economy.  In addition, nobles
are expected to improve their feifs and lands, and so must spend a lot of
money improving infrastructure.

On a related note:

I slowed down the M0 expansion a bit, and made the Empire a bit more prone
to use the carrot than the stick.  I feel that a world should want to join
the Imperium, and should be encouraged.  As usual for the young 3I, the
motivators should be economic first, military second.

I have vacillated wildly on how many nobles should exist in the Imperium,
and whether they are subordinate to each other.  My present feel is that
the feudal links are very short - every noble is individually responsible
to the Emperor.  For organizational purposes, higher ranking nobles are
given the ability to command lower ranking ones, and certain nobles are
allowed to create ones under them, but the power is limited.  For example,
the commander of an order of knighthood is allowed to induct people into
his order, and those new Imperial knights do not have to travel to Sylea to
be recognized by Cleon.  They will, though, be published on the Birthday or
Holiday list.

While many of Cleon\'s policies are made for the short term, I feel that the
majority are fairly forward looking.  In the compressed time scale
Traveller uses, the expansion phase ends by 200-300, as the number of
settled worlds vastly outweighs the number of new colonies.  This is soon
enough that they likely made plans for what happens when all the worlds
they can reach have joined:

Quick digression:
Population:
	roughly 1/36 has 50 billion people
	roughly 2/36 has 5 billion people
	roughly 3/36 has 500 million people
	roughly 30/36 are too small to matter in this calculation

As a result, 36 worlds should have a population of roughly 61 billion.

A subsector is the largest unit that can have personal administration.  I
believe that all nobles within a subsector should know of each other.  It
should have 35-40 worlds, which leads to three high pop worlds in that
area.  I figure that a high pop world justifies a Marquis, several Counts,
and a few dozen Barons.  There should therefore be 75 Barons, 12 Counts, 3
Marquis, and a Duke in the region from those worlds, plus another 60 or so
Barons from backwater worlds.  There will also be thousands of knights in
this region, some of whom are used to being the highest nobles on their world.

A sector, which is the largest unit that really can be administered, has
about 600 worlds.  Nobles will know the big names, but that is about it.
In this area, expect to have 20 Dukes, 100 Marquis, 500 Counts, 5000
Barons, and perhaps a hundred thousand knights.

Marc,

Being that I do this stuff for a living, I just have to toss in my
opinion too ;>)  

The problem with scanning text as graphics is the generaly poor
resolution which will occur with the output.  Even at 1200dpi, text
rasterizes so badly that it becomes unreadable on most median resolution
printouts (dot matrix or inkjets, like the kind most of us can afford). 
OCR is definately necessary to retain any quality in the doccuments at
all.  Besides, text doccuments with graphics embedded or linked take up
a VERY small fraction of the space required of large scale graphics
files.  One page of text scanned in at a 2 bit mode (black and white
line drawing) at 1200 dpi takes up roughly five to ten megabytes of
space in its raw form, last time I checked.

The flipside of this is that I have yet to use an ocr package which
didn\'t require LOTS of post scan editing.  There is no quick and dirty
way to do something like this properly.  

I also have to agree with the proponents of using pdf.  We often send
large graphics intensive files to our printers using pdf to avoid
problems with fonts and linked files, etc.  The compression ratios are
unreal (if you don\'t mind downsampling things rather aggressively), but
the printouts are still of good quality.  

That\'s my opinion, anyway...  for what it\'s worth.

BTW, that\'ll be $.02 please.

towards M1100, when travel to Core would take a significant period.

3) Why do the careers start with O2, not O1?

4) The nobles section is unclear - how do knighthood and elevation effect
noble ranks and skills?

5) Does elevation gain an extra skill, or are nobles skills-light to
account for their other advantages?

6) In O3 Entertainers comments section, Dance 10 is refered to as Dande 10.

7) I assume that the mustering out benefits will be detailed separately (ie
what \'Lands\' are).

8) The MO when injured entry is unclear. Do injured characters (eg a 3 term
character) gain double benefits (2 per term...)?

Against that weaponry the locals and PC\'s are going to be severely
overmatched. Carbines won\'t damage the armored walkers and I doubt
artillery would manage to hit them (hitting moving targets wasn\'t a
forte of old artillery).

TL 3 and 4 locals won\'t be overawed by ironclad land vehicles. Such
things were considered in the Civil War and naval ships used iron
armor as well. They may not be able to damage them but I think the
psyche affect will be minimal.

They won\'t be able to do much against either the walkers or the armor
clad mercs. Their best bet will be to hopefully escape with the target
while confusion reigns, and hope they can reach the scout ship before
anyone realizes what they\'ve done. Once in the ship they can either
escape or try something with its weapons.

The carriers are small targets and in an atmosphere, definitely a
tough target to hit with a shipboard weapon.=20

Using boobytraps or mines might encourage reprisals by the mercs, and
would probably not cause much in the way of casualties among them
anyway. Combat armor is tough and probably has sensors to detect
explosives. What TL is the armor anyway?

Yes! Acrobat retains the format, is readable in Windows, MacOS and UNIX,
and more importantly does allow direct scanning and conversion to pdf
files. (Unfortunately not on my non-PowerPC Mac ;-) )

Acrobat is superior to HTML which varies depending on the browser that you
have (IIRC).

You can easily hyperlink with Acrobat 3 (draw button/hotspot, select view,
and click okay) very easily.

Okay, I\'ll admit it - I have been working on a collection of Library Data
for use in my game - at present this is mainly the Imperial Encyclopedia,
which I OCRd. Originally I was going to use HTML to generate the file (and
bought PageMill to do so). However, after playing with the text file and
Pagemill I decided that the variations in formating just made it more
hassle than I needed. So I bought Acrobat 3, and regenerated the file as a
pdf. I then experimented with hotlinks, which were really easy to
implement. The current version of the file doesn\'t have them as I am still
adding new data (HTML would be easier for a partial data structure).
However, I will be hyperlinking when I complete it...

To summarise - Acrobat is designed to build files of the type we are
discussing. HTML has other advantages, but would require formating and a
higher degree of work. Acrobat allows you to print the text in paper
exactly as it is scanned, something I would want to do for sections I want
to use. I agree that the ability to search would be great (and I use my
scanned text file to do so occasionally), but it requires a hell of a lot
more work to implement.

We seem to have two conflicting desires here - one of having the old
Traveller material available and a second one of having the data available
in a much more useable state (hyperlinked and searchable). If we want to
have these files on CD-ROM quickly, I think that Acrobat is the only way to
go forward. This may have turned into long rant in favour of Acrobat, but
it\'s based on experience that I\'ve gained trying to convert my own files.
No doubt some of you will disagree ;-)

Oh yes - the CD should be dual format Mac/PC... and I want a copy! ;-)

Hello,
  For most would-be users some form of non-image file for the actual
text would be extremely desirable. Tables might need some conversion
or need to be organized separately with excellent cross-referencing.
Necessary graphics (maps, deckplans) wouldn\'t be a problem as image
files; pure artwork might as well be scanned in, if it matters.

  If any but the most basic editing (probably the best economic choice;
after all, we\'re mostly busy collecting the old stuff, so a digital
re-release shouldn\'t be unacceptable) is done it might be highly useful
to tag each section or page as public/player or ref info, to ease ref
hand-out production for game use.

  Re-writing it as hypertext may very well end up with an uneconomic
product. The need for such can largely be obviated by duplicating the
Library Data from each publication either in an additional LD section
or by adding them to the two LD Supplements (preferably the former).

  Presumably M:1100 is a long way down the road. Such a CD (or CD\'s)
need not interfere with M:1100 product sales down the road (depending
on CD drive use among your customer base, and pirating), and could
actually help, especially if IG intends to concentrate on new product
rather than re-releases.

  What about security? Some way to impede a sudden deluge of pirated
material from the CD\'s hitting the net would be desirable, if practical.
I\'ve heard some suggestions, but nothing authoritative.

        Yours truly,

No.  Making sense of your statistics is one of the joys of
role-playing.  The baron\'s daughter who has never gotten a commission
and the mechanic\'s son who has risen to command a starship or a
battalion are challenging and enjoyable characters to play.

Aside from role-playing, however, allowing social status and rank to
float independently shows the tension in the Imperial military between
the meritocratic and aristocratic tendencies.

on Pan-Imperia\'s web site. Beginnings is a CharGen program for the T4
main rules, and will generate characters in the T4 rule book through the
mustering out process and either print them out or save them to a file. 

Thanks to the many people who have tried out the previous versions and
reported on bugs and given suggestions for improving Beginnings! With
your help, I think this thing is *almost* ready to be prettied up and have
that dreaded v1.0 slapped on it  :)

NEW ADDITIONS TO v0.93 :

1) Fixed Benefits Bug, benefits now reinitialized for each character.

2) Fixed OTC/NOTC Bug, OTC/NOTC status now reinitialized after each
character.

3) Added option limiting Milieu 0 characters to a max Homeworld TL of
C (12).

4) Mustering Out now shows the cash and benefit tables that you have
to choose from for each roll.

5) Fixed Rank Bug where a) a character\'s obtained rank was not carried
over between careers, b) characters did not get credit for promotions
within a career, e.g. a Lieutenant would get promoted to Lieutenant,
and c) Navy enlisted characters now have rank listed on save file/
print out.

6) Added ability to choose whether or not you wish to try for a
commission, for those who wish to create enlisted characters.

7) In mustering out, multiple results of Gun, Blade, or Weapon will
allow you to choose between taking the actual physical weapon or
choosing to take additional skill in the appropriate category.

8) Multiple mustering out results of Free Trader under the Merchant
career will deduct 10-year increments from the assumed 40-year mort-
gage; this will be noted on the save file/print out.

9) Fixed the Grad/Med school procedure; now if a character is eli-
gible for both and is turned down by his first pick, he/she is given a
choice of trying for the other instead of going straight to picking
a career.

10) Characters now earn a skill for every year served during a term in
which they suffer an injury.

ADDITIONS SLATED FOR FUTURE VERSIONS:

1) Add the Diplomat and Bureaucrat careers from Pocket Empires.
- -- This will be added to the next version.

2) Many interface changes for aesthetics and ease of use. -- This will be
in version 1.0, as soon as the code gets nailed down and bug free.

3) Other processes for gaining skills will be enabled, including the 
ability to pick skills instead of rolling, and a fully random version.
- -- As work and family allow me to add them.

Once again, thanks to everyone! Your comments and suggestions have
been very appreciated!

On the other hand, maybe they tried and they failed.  Alien Book 8
(Darrians) tell us that the Special Arm is a third arm of the military of
the Confederation.  It is charged with the maintenance and operation of the
star trigger.  The Enhanced Naval Character generation table indicates, as
one skill that can be obtained by the Special Arm: telepathy.  Unless this
is a typo, it means something.  Considering that the Confederation is
outside of the Imperium and that it is a tolerant society (page 18), it is
possible that the governement makes more use of psionics to protect its
greatest secret.  They must make sure that the Sword World will not learn
about the fact that the trigger doesn\'t work (at least until some time after
the Collapse and the beginning of the Regency).

  This probably a useful idea. Heck, after scanning you have the images
anyways, so if the room is there why not use it. Nostalgia buffs will love
it. It may also negate the need for "extra" images holding the pix

People a while ago were complaining at a lack of \'human input\' in

Craig responded with the \'literary THUDDD\' aka the noble\'s yacht.
However,
this didn\'t seem to get as big a response..
*****************************************

....But as was pointed out, the voting response was much higher.  My
thoughts are this:  maxed out creations by our beloved gearheads (and I
mean this in the most positive way) with the standard write about
marginally better firepower and ship X having 1G more than Y are
interesting from a technical point of view.  But while sitting here
reading the TML you (actually I should say "I"--I should not speak for
anyone else) often don\'t have the time or the enthusiasm to pour over
specs and compare and then vote on each and every entry.  Most often, I
just clip, paste, and save.  Later when I need, say a trader, then I
look over these and then take a scan at the minute details.  Also, when
it comes time to vote you have to lay all the posts out side by side and
spend an evening comparing.  I unfortunately rarely had time to do so.
(By the way, this post should in no way be construed as a recommendation
that maxed out ships should not be done on THUDDD....such ships are very
useful to me later although the designers may not get the "instant
gratification of seeing my vote).  In short, In my opinion, while many
people would whittle away the hours over a maxed out design of their
own, others many not have the time or attention span to digest all the
info until much later (and the time to vote has past)

On the yacht design....most of the info was just such a good read. 
Futhermore the time spent in detailing appearances made each ship
uniquely stick out in my mind (who can forget the image of releaving
yourself while simultaneously being able to view the vastness of space
through a hugh forward window.....or better yet, on the ground, waving
to the starport controllers :-} )  I got a "feel" for the ship almost
imediately.  Maybe thats just because I don\'t have a finely honed
"engineering" sense...but I\'d wager that I am not alone.

So after all that I have said above I would like to say this:

Thank you to the gearheads who make all the cutting edge designs--I
appreciate your effort and am glad to have many a library of fine ships

Yup!  They\'re doing this right now for a drug-dealer who we arrested on
family violence.  We get to try him first on the misdemeanor but the
Feds get him a day or tow after.

I\'d pay a bit for even photocopies of all the CT books.  (If copied with

products completely.  What part of the timeline do they deal with?  (No

   This comment can be interpreted a couple different ways.

   1) Those changes to established canon that have occurred in MMT were
inadvertant and will be corrected over time.

   2) The old material will be manipulated to fit a *reinterpretation*
of the Traveller universe as presented in MMT.

   True enough.

   The MT material was presented as "this is the information you as
players know" *and* "this, Referee, is what\'s really happening" which
appeared in a different section.  True, certain things were not fully
disclosed (i.e. did Lucan really kill his brother?), but those things
that were opinion were generally differentiated from fact.

   In TNE where anecdotal information is presented, it can be counted on
as fact (with one exception noted below).  While there is a certain
perspective being presented (mostly that of the RC), there is no reason
to doubt that what is being presented isn\'t true.

   The one exception is H&I.  It was the first attempt at true Traveller
Relativism, and as such was very poorly received by TNE fans.  Opinions
of it varied from "interesting literature, worth analyzing" to "a waste
of good paper stock".  Some people got the humor presented within it,
and some people got it--but wished GDW hadn\'t bothered.  The general
concensus in the end was that if you ignored the zaniness (baseball,
Santa Claus hats, and jingle bells indeed) there was enough in H&I to
make it worth buying (cover price substanially below $22.95).

   Our lists more or less correspond, though I would not rate Traveller
Digest or MegaTraveller Journal nearly as high.  In fact, Dave Nilsen
pretty much reputiated the contents of MTJ #4, and the Regency
Sourcebook just flat states that the whole "Sparklers" episode did not
happen.

   Sorry to write another "me too", but we are once again in agreement. 
Time will tell just how far off the reservation Marc Miller\'s Traveller
strays.

I count (in CT) approximately 6 rules books, 13 Adventures, 13 Supplements, 6
Double Adventures, 6 Alien Modules, several board games, and who knows what
else. MegaTravellers has at least six 96 page books. TNE has (a lot) of books
and modules.

The choices (for creating a CD-ROM) are:

Scan every page as an image.
Scan every page and convert to text.
Scan every page and convert to text, then edit.
Scan every page and convert to text, then edit, and remove some of the
material.
Scan every page and convert to text, then make it hypertext.

Each additional step of work calls for a higher budget.

When I get back to the office (currently on the road with a client) I
will look into the different possibilities.  Still not sure what can be
done, but the technology is getting much better. The techno experts are
a the home office. 

So what are we looking at here?  I do not have access to my traveller
books, but I would guess about 100 books with an average of 60 pages. 
600 pages that need to be scanned, converted, edited, categorized with
keywords and sorted into a database type environment.  Is that the
problem?

   But remember Leroy, "new and improved" is a classic advertising
oxymoron.  Something can\'t be both \'new\' and \'improved\'.

   While I think everyone would agree that Marc Miller\'s Traveller is
*new*, getting them to agree that it is an improvement over CT or MT or
TNE is another story altogether.  Given that the final version of the
game hasn\'t been published yet, the whole issue is still very much up in
the air.

Ok, my first post on this subject was a bit flip, now to be a little
serious.

I would LOVE to see this project completed and on the market, that much
is true, but I can also see the downside. My wife\'s business in art,
mainly old fashion, done by hand art, but it is scanned and reproduced
electronically, and she does some projects completely on the computer.
This is great for me, it let\'s me play with a couple of flatbeds, color
and laser printers and a few computers (not to mention pays for my ISP
account so I can type with you guys). She isn\'t familiar, nor am I with
the specifics of Acrobat, other than using the reader function,
(although some of what I\'m reading has me thinking!), but she has done
some scanning and OCR fro several jobs.
So I asked her what her opinion was of this project. She reminded me of
a job she worked on when she first started her business. It involved
re-setting the benefits package for a major department store, combining
two booklets of about 20-30 pages each. She used what was state of the
art OCR program (about 6 years ago), I can\'t remember the name of it and
she doesn\'t use it any longer. The up shot is she said that even with
the OCR it took about 15  - 30 minutes of proofreading and editing per
page, (by admittedly non-professional but reasonable intelligent proof
readers, myself among them :^) Now I hope that the present state of the
art OCR programs are somewhat better than the one she used for that job,
she nor I know, since we haven\'t used them since.
This is not to say that I think this project should be set aside, it\'s
just "looking at the facts". THe conclusion I\'m trying to get to is I DO
think it\'s possible but I have to agree that it would take a lot of
work! Now I\'ve seen 3-4 people that have volunteers (me too, I was
serious about that as well!), and I\'m sure there are more. The hints
I\'ve picked up is that some of it has already been done. If Far Future
or IG would  take on the job of co-ordination I would still like to
offer that VOLUNTEER time to scan and proof read.
I now think that PDF is probably the best route. I can\'t put the work
into that since we  don\'t (yet) own Acrobat but I could do it up in Word
6 format, the art is no problem, she operated on the Corel 6 platform
and gifs, jpegs and whatnot aren\'t any problem. Also paper output.
So to wrap this up, I\'m willing to scan, proofread, and print (if needed
for additional proof reading). I\'ll do it from what Traveller products I
still have, (Trav. Book, Trav. Adven., Hivers, Solomani, and Aslan
supplements, and a couple of odd adventure books for CT. The TNE Main
book, FF&S, Path of Tears for that Millieu). On top of this I\'ll buy the
final product! Now can you beat that deal?

My dictionary gives "Horizon" as one less-common alternative translation.
Things change over the years...I understand that Luther\'s translation of the
bible into German uses the word "Weib" in reference to the virgin Mary, which
now has a slightly perjorative connotation.

Anyway, Horizon Starship Company was what was intended.

CD-ROms are only 630 MB or so... average 8x10.5 (normal scanned area of
8.5x11 letter) at 300 dpi B&W (1bit) bitmap is 1.02 MB per page,
uncompressed. Most graphics compression is about 50%, some compress more,
but sacrifice resolution. so 1200 pages would be about the limit for
scanned pages as images... as a ROUGH estimate.

Text files, however, seldom run more than 50 KB per 8x10.5 print area....
and HTML not much more (70K for really heavy coding).

As rodge would say, Food for thought.

Why not try to see the quality and the easyness of all solutions.

Maybe we could scan several pages of differents books (one from CT, one
from MT, one from TNE) and convert them in all the offered format and then
put them on a web site. 

So TMLers could download the different files (maybe several in each
solution, depends on the solution) and review its quality (visual, handle,
printing, text extracting and searchs)

Surely chosen pages have to be the most representative of the complexity of
the books (including gray level pictures, arrays (with gray lines) and
illos (maybe on gray background)). So we could have samples.

This will help to cost all the procedure too.

matters between the individual worlds. So long as trade is not affected, 
the planets are allowed to do what they can. The only time the big boys
get involved is for crimes against the Imperium, i.e. treason, piracy,
crimes against Imperial representatives or property, etc., or in those
rare cases that the Imperium feels that the crime is of a horrendous 
enough nature that it must step in, e.g. some group releases a nerve
gas bomb downtown in one of the major cities or some other weapon
of mass destruction. Of course, the 3I can reserves the right to declare
any crime within its jurisdiction, but very rarely does so out of a) the
desire to preserve planets\' rights, and b) the desire not to get itself
weighted down with being the local police force for thousands of
worlds. In the later years of the Imperium, perhaps the bureaucracy
lent itself to doing so, but in Milieu 0 I feel that Cleon and the boys
are too busy just trying to keep up with the expanding trade to try
and be Barney Fife.

Well, that is what was believed in M1100, but 1100 years is a long
time for people to forget and get confused over what was really known
and not known in M0.  We\'ve had discussions before about the ability
of a large and diverse nation like the Imperium to maintain accurate
and complete records of all its knowledge over several centuries - and
like all the arguments which rely on extrapolated ideas about what
might be possible with advanced technology, there are 3 conlusions
"yes it can be done", "no it can\'t be done", and "well, maybe, maybe
not".  I personally go with the "no, it can\'t be done" in this case,
ie. knowledge will be lost & mislaid, if only because it is more
interesting game-wise.  If someone lands on a planet, and wants to
know all the history relating to the current political setting, and
they can just look it up in "Encylopedia Imperia" in however much
detail they want, then half the mystery (ie.  fun) is gone straight
away.

Relevance to Droyne: Just because it was thought they were a major
race in M0 doesn\'t mean anyone remembers by M500; perhaps the idea was
discredited?  Also, one thing that has never been mentioned in
relation to the Droyne has been the role of the race itself - they
sailed through the Final War, the First Imperium (not known for its
tolerance of alien cultures), the Second Imperium (lootocracies are
not noted for concerning themselves with sophont welfare) and the Long
Night, in many cases unaffected, or at least not wiped out, in
numerous locations.  To me, this suggests that the Droyne are a bit
more knowledgable than they let on.

One possiblity (which I don\'t like, because Imperium-wide, century
spanning conspiracies make me want to scream) is that there is a
secret group of Droyne who go around preserving the lives of their
more pastoral siblings (sort of like Men in Black in groups of six).
However, it isn\'t clear why they would fiddle about with lots of
little groups of backward Droyne spread all over the place - surely
the best chance of survival comes in numbers, regardless of what sort
of culture & society you want.  These Droyne MiB would have been
around before any of the other Major Races left their homeworlds, so
why didn\'t they just keep the homeworlds in check?  I mention this
possibility before someone else does, because I think it is crap -
things don\'t work like that except in the minds of mega-conspiracy
theory geeks.

OK, so my prefered idea works like this: The Droyne drones can, in a
sufficiently large population, retain a significant fraction of the
racial knowledge base (ie. scientific and social knowledge), although
they may not have the understanding to put it into action.  When a
droyne group is threatened by a truely dire event, the Droyne leaders
ask their drones to search their memories, with the aid of the other
castes\' input, to come up with ideas for solutions.  The groups which
retain the correct knowledge and are able to retrieve it survive;
those that do not either perish or innovate.  The Droyne revert to
simple existences between crises (an attitude which may well be seen
as a utopian ideal by some).  In this way, the Droyne are more
prominent in M0 because they have been coping with the Long Night.
During the Imperium period, they fade from view, and people forget
about them, indicating that the Imperium is fundamentally a safe place
for this race.  However, in the 1100s, along with the increasing
recognition of the major race status of the Droyne (and the links to
the Ancients) they start being space-going again, establishing
companies, travelling the stars, interacting with other races,
learning about them.  Perhaps some of the groups which have come in to
increased contact with non-Droyne have decided that to ensure survival
they have to take a measure of control over that contact.  Then, when
the Rebellion and Hard Times comes about, Droyne become even more
prominent, and even belligerent, hence the reports of Droyne clashing
with humans, and in some cases forming survival partnerships.  This
isn\'t the result of some overarching guiding group of Droyne (unless
you count the indirect influence of Gramps), just the evolved racial
response to survival.

I\'m not sure how this applies to the Droyne in M0; perhaps in the core
worlds they are generally known about at this date; but, they have
disappeared, but then a growing empire has other worries which
overtake this (not that the fact can\'t be used for an adventure
premise, just that the Imperium as a whole will keep on rolling
regardless).  If the status of the Droyne is not general knowledge
beyond the Sylean core, then the belief that they are a major race may
fade, especially if the opposite belief is strongly held else where.
Perhaps some human records show categorically that apparent Droyne on
such-and-such a world were first contacted when they were in a
primitive state, and there was no evidence that they were not native
to that world.  Perhaps poltical expediency requires that the Droyne
status is overlooked in one region.  Perhaps some Droyne decide that
the best way of being left alone in the newly expanding empire is by
being insignificant.  As the Third Imperium (at least in M0?) seems to
be slightly more considerate of its non-human population than the
earlier incarnations, perhaps they will leave the Droyne to
themselves.  My point is that a more "natural" explanation of the
Droyne\'s fall from notice is via a series of small happenings, rather
than some overarching plan.

Perhaps M0 is just a simulation in a virus-based cyberspace, a subtly
rearranged mega-maze for the virtual humaniti to run through, observed
by the virus\'s Hiver colleagues with a view to understanding the
object of their biggest project yet!

nothing but empty promises.
    The best service Roger Sanger can do is to give up (or agree to sell)

According to my lunchtime calculations, that\'s off by a factor of 10!  I
think you meant 6000 pages.

In fact, a quick check of my ever handy bibliography reveals the following
facts:


Pages of Traveller material in different eras divided by publisher:

     GDW       DGP       Other           Total

CT   3086      142       2527      5755       (+1737 pages of novels)

MT   945       540       -         1485

TNE  1682      -         -         1682       (+704 pages of novels)


Total     5713      682       2527       8922


That\'s 8922 pages of Traveller material (not counting novels or boxed sets
such as Tarsus, Beltstrike and Games 1-5)

(NB: Much of the CT material is in the smaller page format which will not
take so much memory)

Across all eras for some 176 items the average pagination was about 50 so
Bob\'s guess above was pretty near the mark.

At this rate the project is going to take some 7 or 8 CDs!!!  (But remember
that many of those 9000 odd pages are not US letter sized.  So maybe a 5 CD
boxed set!)


William continues:

Which is 450 meg (text) and 630 meg (HTML).  (Again, less as the CT books
were not all US letter size).

Achilles Station (Spinward Marches 2120)

The Lanth sector is a sparse grouping of stars which contains a 
branch of the Spinward Main to trailing and bordered by the Sword 
Worlds to rimward.  Communication between Lanth and other 
Imperial worlds is slow, and trade somewhat limited.  For this 
reason, a base in the sparse interior of the subsector would be a 
useful asset.

The discovery of a small number of asteroid bodies relatively close 
together in this region was a fortunate one for the misjumped 
scoutship _Unforgivable Insult_, allowing her detached duty pilot and 
crew to reach D\'Ganzio Naval Base for repairs.  Their report to Scout 
authorities on Lanth was that it was a possible waypoint for naval 
vessels, being jump-4 from the bases at Lanth, Equus and Lunion, and 
a possible route for type S scoutships to reach Lanth from the Scout 
base at Ivendo (2319) on the Spinward Main.

No official action was taken, but a few years later the crew of the 
_Unforgivable Insult_ returned to Lanth for their annual 
maintainance and a replenishment of engineering stores, having sold 
many of their spares to the tiny outpost on Mithril in the Sword 
Worlds.  Hearing rumours of trade opportunities on Equus, 
they decided to use the "shortcut" they had discovered earlier.  On 
reaching the asteroids, they were astonished to find them settled, 
with mining of two smaller rocks apparently in progress and a 
thriving colony of perhaps a thousand people on the large ice 
asteroid they\'d previously used to refuel.

The colony was controlled from a surplus but well-armed destroyer, of 
obsolete manufacture but undoubted power, by an individual who 
introduced himself as Captain Biktor.  He explained that the 
colonists were mostly belters and miners from worked-out claims in 
other systems, now plying their trade here at Achilles Station.  They 
shipped crudely processed metals in exchange for food and 
manufactured goods, but most of their money was made selling fuel to 
the far traders and seekers which passed this way.  Biktor expressed 
some surprise that an Imperial ship would know of the settlement, 
since the Imperium apparently knew nothing of Achilles Station, but 
allowed _Unforgivable Insult_ to go on her way, having traded some 
lifesupport supplies for fuel.

At Ivendo, the Scout authorities listened patiently, but showed very 
little excitement.  No ban was placed on _Insult_\'s crew using or 
even advertising the existence of Achilles Station, but they were 
asked to be discreet about it and to report to Scout authorities on 
after each visit.

Possibilities:

Achilles Station is of huge value as a refuelling base, so why hasn\'t 
the Imperial Navy simply taken over?  The main reason is that they 
are already in charge: for all that Biktor\'s battered destroyer looks 
like a pirate, it was obtained from the mothballed reserve fleet at 
Trin only a couple of years ago.  The crew are largely ex-service 
personnel, with a scattering of active duty scouts and some recruits 
from the colony, while Biktor himself is actually a Commander in 
Imperial Naval Intelligence.  He keeps to his psionic-screened 
quarters and bridge, and only he and his XO know about the huge 
fusion warhead planted on the asteroid.  The station is unlikely to 
remain secret, and in fact it is a trap for invading Zhodani, who 
would be stranded there if the main asteroid were destroyed.

Ling Standard Products has an exclusive contract for the metal 
extracted from the asteroids, and contributed most of the start-up 
costs.  They believe Biktor to be a privateer of some sort, but are 
very willing to do business with him.

Sometimes corsairs use the base, but never for long.  Some have 
become part of Biktor\'s system defence squadron, whereas others leave 
and retrun infrequently, if at all.  Achilles Station is neither a 
haven for pirates nor too inclined to check up on the background of 
ships which call.  It is likely that Biktor betrays the worst pirates 
to the Navy.

Noisy ventilation fans. :)

Well, arguably this could be like someone firing a cannon mounted on the
hull, thus it could be extremely uncomfortable. But, more on that later.

> Maybe something coming from the jump grid while in J-space

For those using a jump core in their campaigns, the deep hum of the jump
core is a classic.

Generally, I think any load and very uncomfortable sound, especially low
frequencies, would be non-existant in a high-tech setting like Traveller.
Anti-noise generators are too easy and cheap to build. (Hey, we\'re using
them on TL-8.)

Neighbour muttering while asleep about killing you. :)

That new sensor-op who\'s always practicing on that awful terror device
from his home world. ("What do you mean \'terror device\'?! It\'s a bag
pipe!" ;) ) 

And for passengers? "They\'ve blothed backs and their bardigans and
their chances to radios, complaining about the tea or they don\'t make
it properly, do they? And stopping at endless Majorcan bodegas selling
fish and chips a nd Rodney\'s Red Barrel and calamares and toothache. And
sitting in their cotton sunfrost, squirting Timothy White Suncream all
over their puffy, raw, swollen, parollen flesh, \'cos they overdid it on
the first day." Well, imagine that kind of people on their way to their
holidays, or on their way home.

    Yes, MORE DETAIL!  World Builder\'s Handbook _barely_ scratched the surface
in terms of detailing a PLANET.  Think of the variety you get here on Earth in
the waning years of the twentieth century.  WBH hasn\'t got a pray of even
mentioning it. ;)

    You know I keep mentioning it and you gearheads keep blowing me off but IF
we want to get and keep new players for T4 we must give the new GM\'s out there
the tools to run the game.  Traveller adventures take place on WORLDS, most of
us have previously published resources for developing Worlds in Traveller but
for the new players coming in through T4 they get... that JOKE of a description
in the T4 book to work with!
    Designing warships, weapons, and all the rest of it is fun, and as a GM
I\'ll be the first to admit it ALL goes into my "Traveller Resource" files for
potential future use.  But the newbie GM is being left hung out to dry
regarding perhaps the most important aspect of Traveller, the Worlds!

I\'d say you scan them at 300 dpi and save them as LZW TIFF 1-bit instead of
JPEG. JPEG is great for continous tone stuff like photographs and such but
really crummy on B&W which most Traveller material is done in. The
artifacts from JPEG compressing text images make them unsuitable for later
OCR processing as well which would leave me out as a buyer (I have ALL the
CT and MT stuff and the TNE stuff worth having IMHO) so for me the real
advantage would be to have it in digital form, esp library data and illos.

Scan the pages and convert it into HTML or pdf. Keep the illos if possible
in the text but they could be put in a separate folder with references in
the text <fig 117>.

Everybody know (in Hollywood at least) that all spaceships emit a low 50 Hz
hum at TL 9+ (post Alien the movie). Curiously enough though these sounds
are only heard from the outside in vacuum (!) never within the ship except
possibly in the drive room.    ;)

Arrrgr, I didn\'t know there was so many...

Michael D. Peters stated that 15 to 30 minutes are needed per page.
Assuming that after 50 pages, the operator would drop below 10 minutes a
page. The complete process would take 9000/6 = 1500H! which is a little
more than 9 monthes (20 days a month 8 hours a day...). What an enjoyable
work...

With 9000 pages there is no way to handle to books with simple texte or
html files. 9000 gif files would also be horrible to walk trough. 

BTW pictures are always hard to print because of the resolution differences
screen/printer


Finally my vote would go for something easy to print such I PDF files which
I\'ve never used. (I trust those would says it\'s a good solution, and I hope
they are right!)

Without an automatic AND reliable OCR/PDF conversion system, I\'m not sure
this is feasable (but many people say that I\'m fatalist...).

   One reason could be that Marines (or to use the more accurate Russian

they were great. I\'m compiling a list of felonies that I think will fall
under Imperial jurisdiction and for which the Imperium would be empowered
to issue warrants for arrest valid outside extrality fences on member
worlds as a result of an empowering clause stipulated in the membership
agreement. I\'m thinking of treason, piracy, genocide, ship-jacking, arms
smuggling, violation of Sophont rights etc. I\'ll post this list for comment
whenever I get it done.
     I\'m not so sure about the navy/scouts/marines performing as a police
force, though. For one thing crime detection is a very different remit than
the one these organisations have been given, and I can\'t see the sense in
each of them maintaining an office of special agents for criminal detection
and arrest purposes. For another thing, this is tantamount to permanent
martial law, and I\'m not sure even a feudal society like the Imperium would
get away with such a policy in a technologically advanced culture. No, I\'m
fairly sure this function will be centralized and organized by the MOJ,
perhaps with a hierarchy of offices at subsector/sector/domain level
emerging as the 3I expands. There will be an office of MOJ agents on most
starports maintaining a database of movements of criminal elements, illegal
shipments etc. and effecting arrests and investigations within (and
occasionally without) Imperial jurisdiction.
     Where do bounty hunters fit in here? I reckon there will be two
varieties of bounty:
1) Warrants and rewards for the return of criminals to member worlds or to
the custody of individuals/non-governmental institutions that are pursued
with no more power than that of the average imperial citizen. These
warrants have no force under Imperial law and the execution of such
warrants is tantamount to kidnapping.
2) Warrants and rewards for those who have violated an Imperial Felony - ie
one on the list I mentioned above - and these may be pursued in imperial
space/territory or on member worlds by those who have registered with the
MOJ as bounty hunters having met certain standards and agreed to follow
certain regulations in pursuit of the bounty.

In general and IMHO - I think we need to see a lot more expansion of roles
and a lot more adventures for nonmilitary or paramilitary characters such
as agents. Besides the bounty hunting campaign I\'ve always fancied the idea
of the Interstellar, Imperial G-man/private eye/detective, pursuing Martuu,
the butcher of Maleus beta from starport to starport, barren moon to barren
moon.

We went around on this a while back; basically, we came to the conclusion
the the Marines have a "you can\'t lead until you\'ve followed" policy.  This
is to insure that every Marine officer knows what it\'s like to be a grunt
with a rifle.  Also, it means that the Marines won\'t invest thousands of
credits training an officer canidate who will wilt at the first sign of
danger.. all the Marine officers have proven themselves.

I would imagine that each subsector would have its own accredited set of
Academies.

The city has no real artillery. The state is quite small and
it\'s very distant from any other potentially troublesome
neighbours. The ruler has eradicated bandits and other local
threats some years ago. The local militia is more like a
heavy-duty police than a real army. From a military point of
view the city has no chance to put up any kind of resistance.
The mercenaries hope that the population will realize that in
the interval between noon and midnight, and will (wisely) decide
to hand out the hostage.
The Mercs would really like to get the job done with minimum
violence.

I think that a two legged armored creature which packs rapid
fire weapons could cause some worry to people. Local culture is
struggling not to revert back to lower TL and tend to scavenge
and mantain old stuff instead of designing or producing
Victorianesque technological marvels. Also consider that the
place is quite poor, so it\'s rarely visited by starships.  
You may be right in saying that people will not be thrown in the
same kind of terror that we can imagine for truly primitive
tribesmen, but OTOH, the Mercs don\'t have a great knowledge of
the local society. Their ticket described the target just as
"low-TL city state with primitive weapons and feudal-like social
structure. No external troops or other threats believed
present". Starting from this, they thought that Walkers would be
good enough for the work, and perhaps give them a small
psychological edge to boot.

Again, I fully realize that, but I suspect that my players would
be inclined to go for a "Seven Samurai/Battle of the
Bulge/A-team" scenario and would like to assess some plans for
this. They will have more or less ten hours to devise a battle
plan.
The three players have little Military experience in RL (and no
starship experience, AFAIK), so I find fair that I, as a GM,
supply them with some facts that their Characters would be able
to know. This is the main reason for asking over the TML.
The other one is that I\'d like to play the Mercs in an
intelligent (but not *too* intelligent) way. They count on
surprise, superior technology and the willingness to extract a
dead body, if necessary. In their opinion, these three factors
should be enough to convince the defenders to just give up. They
don\'t know that the PC\'s are in the city and have no reason to
expect any surprise.

>>Is it possible, for example, to use the starship Laser against
>>the G-Carriers?=20
>
>The carriers are small targets and in an atmosphere, definitely a
>tough target to hit with a shipboard weapon.=20
This is one of the points I\'d like to discuss, especially with
someone which have extensive experience with Starship
design/tactics.  
Consider that the fight would be at a very short distance, and
even if the G-carriers are quite smaller than your average
starship, they will be much (*much*) nearer then usual space
combat targets. Is there any *canonical* guideline on using ship
weapons as AP or anti-tank weaponry.

One of the PCs has Gunnery and two of them have Pilot (three,
considering the Scout NPC). They could reach the submersed ship
and spring out of the sea in order to intercept the G-carriers.
Using ship weaponry against the walkers is almost impossible,
I\'d say. They will be near or inside the city walls, and using
deep space weapons at these ranges could cause enormous
collateral damage.
The best bet would be to try and destroy the G-carriers in
flight. Without them, the Walkers could do very little on they
own (they are just three, each manned by a single pilot, and if
the G-carriers are destroyed they would probably try to get out
of the city, regroup at the landing site and wait for the
shuttle which will take them back to their orbiting ship.).
If you think that starship weapons won\'t do, what about trying
to ram them down? The starship should prove fast (and sturdy)
enough to close in and knock down the G-carriers. Their on-board
weaponry wouldn\'t be enough to actually damage ship\'s armor.

>>Wt about mines, boobytraps, using their air-raft as a
>>weapon...
>
>Using boobytraps or mines might encourage reprisals by the mercs, and
>would probably not cause much in the way of casualties among them
>anyway. 
Mhhh... they way I\'m envisioning things, the Mercs think to have
all the aces in this situation, and won\'t expect any nasty
surprise. Mission budget and diplomatic problems on the planet
will not allow them to do much if they are repelled. The mission
was put together in a hurry, and if they encounter serious
opposition they will beat it and blame their patron for not
having provided sufficient info on the opposing forces.
Obviously the PCs can\'t know this last part, but they know that
due to Zhodani and Imperial Navy presence around the planet, the
Mercenaries will not be allowed to launch larger scale operations.
Also, if the PCs take the hostage away, no-one will be
interested in continuing actions against the planet, no Merc
will be so stupid to mount a genocide attack just to take
revenge against the natives; the Merc force is formed by
competent professionals, and they won\'t have any interest in
doing this. Bad publicity, risky political move, and who would
pay for this second trip?  On the other hand, the Mercs would
probably love to discover just who the PCs are and perhaps take
some kind of revenge against *them*...

>Combat armor is tough and probably has sensors to detect
>explosives. What TL is the armor anyway?
The walkers should be around TL 10, I\'d say... what TL would you
consider for T2300 stuff, anyway?
The rest of the troops (the ones travelling by G-carriers and
which will storm the island) is equipped with light personal armors and
weapons, tactical comm-links, HUDs, Night Goggles and assorted gear.
I\'d say Flex-3 over limbs and Flex-5 on torso, SMGs, grenades
and light sidearms for the storming party.

I\'ve seen mention, in weapon descriptions in the EA, of laser sights. 
 The TL 13 Guass Pistol, for instance, lists laser sighting.

But, there are no game mechanics printed in the weapon description 
for laser sighting.  Like other sights, I would think that laser 
sighting adds a +DM to the attack throw.

There is a section in the EA on sighting aids, but laser sighting is 
not covered.

Am I missing something?  Is the rule for laser sights buried in the 
the EA somewhere like the one for RF autofire?  Was this 
unintentionally omitted from the EA?

Where do I find the rule for using laser sights?

Thanks,

Kenneth.

This would certainly be my preference.  I have found that .PDF format is
nowhere near the glorious format it is hyped as.  The freeware Acrobat
reader is notoriously slow and clunky (I\'ve got seven users here in my
office who complain about it regularly) and printing support is
questionable.  While HTML looks great if you\'re using an HTML-compatible
viewer, all text editors and most word processors present HTML exactly as
it truly is; oddly formatted text with control characters scattered
throughout (most people are still using word processing software 2 or 3
years old, with no HTML support).  If I want to use some of the text in a
word-processor document, I will have to clean out all the HTML rubbish
first.  And certainly I will want to use the text in my own documents; a
breifing paper for a character about his home planet, perhaps, or a subset
of library data for a given subsector to be used as the party\'s database?
I can think of a million potential uses for this material!!!

Actually, my ideal situation would be:
1. ASCII text of the text
2. JPEG or GIF images of each page
3. Separate JPEG or GIF images of each graphic on each page.

I could then use the graphics in my own documents (for personal use only!)
without editing down the full-page images.  This would be something I would
willingly plunk down $100.00 for.  And as others have mentioned, I suspect
a lot of this work could even be done by a subset of TML members in
exchange for a free copy of the CD.

Give this one some thought, Marc.  I think it might turn out to be fairly
popular.  I suspect you could easily handle this as an internet-only offer
to reduce marketing costs.  I imagine you could sell at least 100 copies to
the TML alone (in addition to any freebies), and probably another several
hundred simply bu advertising in the rec.games.frp.misc internet group.
Mentioning the CD in the Imperium Games catalog and in Journal could likely
generate several hundred additional sales.  If it was done as a direct
mail/internet offer, almost all of the $50.00 or $100.00 could go to
Imperium Games, instead of losing a big chunk to a series of middlemen.

You have the same problem with Lieutenants. I suggest we stick with the old 
ranks, but prefix Lt and Capt with \'Force\'.

Yeah, waivers could be one way to handle it.

A simpler way to handle it might be to base the promotion roll directly on 
the Soc (with DMs to help talented peasants). This would have the effect of 
getting the hi-Soc characters to the top, but would still give a (slim) 
chance for someone with a low Soc. Say,

(Soc-3) or less, +1 if Int 9+, +1 if Edu 9+, +1 if Tactics/Leader/Admin 4+

Bob\'s calculator must be back at the home office too...;->...60 pages times
100 books is 6,000 pages not 600! ;->

I think one of the perceived problems is that there is going to be a
significant up-front cost to scan and edit the pages, and Marc isn\'t sure
sales would cover the costs. Another possible problem is that a product
like this might cut into sales of *new* product, I *really* don\'t think
that would happen, but it is probably a concern.  

Here\'s a half-baked cost analysis...

Simple scanning of 6,000 pages would take how long?  Would 10 minutes per
page to setup, scan, check, and rescan be too much...that would mean 1,000
hours of work? Converting the scanned images to text and doing clean up
editing would take at least as long, so another 1,000 hours.  So, we\'re
talking about 1 man-year of work, or to put it in dollars and cents about
$30,000 in wages plus a little more for hardware/software.

Now, we can look at some numbers. If a production run of 1,000 disks is
done costing..let\'s say $10/disk..for production and packaging, that would
be another $10,000. Adding in some administrative and advertising costs
brings us to around $50,000 in costs. Dividing $50,000 by 1,000 gives a
cost/disk of $50.  With a 100% markup, they could be offered for sale for
$100.

OTOH, if the production run is only 500 disks (still at $10/disk) you\'d
still have to cover $40,000 to $45,000 in costs. Per disk cost goes up to
$80 to $90, and retail price would be $160 to $180.

So, guys, what\'s the likely market?

Note, though, that the raw text for a 8.6x11 page is usually closer to
3-5K.  I have never seen a page _of text_ that took up more than 10k.  If
you use Word, on the other hand, then it loads each 3-5K page with 10K-50K
of crap.

For what it is worth, when I set a 350 page book in Tex, the source was
about 1.2M.  1.2M/350 -> 3.5K/page.

Likewise, a web page I did recently had about 6K/page.  But then, I rarely
use anything other than basic html, with links.  I find the rest of it does
not add to my user experience.  Usually, backgrounds and funky colors look
like garbage on my monitor, so I prefer to avoid them.

6000 pages * 5k -> 30M total.  This is not terrible.

That is a good idea. In fact, whatever format is eventually decided on, 
putting in the scanned images also would be a real good idea.

No, no, no! Not JPEG! Please. Using a self-disintegrating image format 
like JPEG is *not* a good idea for images that are going to be 
processed in any way. *Any* other *non-destructive* compressed image 
format that is reasonably well standardized (and has the image format 
definition and source code for at least one implementation available) 
would be a better idea. My personal favourite is PNG 
(http://www.wco.com/~png/) which has the added benefit of being 
completely unlicensed and patent-free. (But if I start ranting about 
how *idiotic* a concept it is to patent algorithms like Unisys did with 
the compression used in GIF, I\'ll never stop, so I\'d better stop here. 
;-) Most any decent graphics program can convert to/from GIF/PNG/TIFF 
at the very least. (One would have to make sure that a \'good\' version 
of TIFF was chosen though, as it\'s standard is - ahem - flexible. ;-)

If PDF is chosen, *please* also dump a plaintext to the disk. It

myself.

True, but then, most recent wordprocessors (like, say, WORD and WP ;-) 
can do a fairly decent automatic conversion of HTML to their 
proprietary format.

Right. Using a text-only browser such as Lynx as a benchmark browser 
should do nicely. (If for no other reason than the fact that not all 
people *can* use gui\'s. I once played in a PBEM run by a blind gm. I\'m 
sure he\'d love to have Traveller as text, that way he can run it 
through a text-to-speech utility, or print it on a braille printer, or, 
well, whatever he chooses. If it\'s a GUI only format, he can\'t do 
*anything* with it.)

I have to disagree a *little* about tables though. I like \'em. But 
then, a well-formatted <PRE> tag does away with most of the use for 
tables. Definitely no frames, however.

True. He has, however, occasionally mailed people on his mailing list. 
I got the latest one on the 25th. He asked for playtesters and 
proofreaders, so, at a guess he does have something going on. (Due to 
lack of time I\'ve never responded, so I don\'t know what he\'s got.)

Well, actually, he does have one. Sort of. It\'s called "403

Definitely. The G-carriers may be small and agile, but you can\'t outrun
or dodge a laser pulse - at planetary combat ranges lasers (for all
pracitcal purposes) never miss. Atmospheric effects might reduce the laser\'s
effective range to a few tens of km, though. And the G-carriers/troops
can fire back; a scoutship\'s hull isn\'t particularly tough. THere\'s also the
risk of the merc\'s ship deciding to become involved if it detects the PC\'s
ship. Pretty tough scenario.

(Permit me to insert a moment of mourning for TNE here - one nice thing
about TNE was that questions like "what can my starship laser do against
a G-carrier" were answered in the basic rulebook - in T4 they\'re only in
CSC/EA, and they\'re answered wrong.)

I kind of like the courtesy major thing from M:1100, but this would be

This is, as far as I know, contemporary British naval usage:  Ensign,
Sub-Lieutenant, Lieutenant, Lieutenant Commander, Captain, etc.  I\'ve
always liked Sub-Lieutenant and would\'ve put it into Traveller in 1980
or so when I started refereeing if hadn\'t already been there.

Like Obersturmfuehrer?  The Third Reich had all sorts of crazy rank
names.  So did the USSR until major reforms in the middle of WWII
brought back the czarist insignia and titles ("Colonel General" has
always been one of my favorites).

Do you really want to run this as a combat?  Are do you just think your
players will take the military tack?

I ask, because if *I* were one of the players, I\'d try to talk the local
Chief into letting the PC\'s take the prisoner out of the city..maybe to
another city, or just out of town. I\'d explain that the Mercs wouldn\'t have
a reason to be threatening the city if the prisoner was gone, and I could
make him gone.  It might not work, but then again it just might and if it
did you could have a "Mercs chase the PC\'s as the PC\'s try to get back to
their ship and off planet" scenerio.  Heck, even once off planet the PC\'s
would still have to get their client\'s son back to him while the
mercenaries and their bosses try to prevent them..imagine all the fun that
could be. ;->

OTOH, if *you* (or your players) are set on a combat scenario then go for
it! 

Eris

ps. It you can\'t punch a hole in your enemy\'s armor (foex the combat
walkers) then try to immobilize them. If you can\'t immobilize them, then
try to blind them. If that doesn\'t work....run away! --

Yep It was mine too.
I have always included Ai ships in my games, it allowed allowed more
GM interaction with the players. But, I allowed Ai ships long before

It\'s well covered in TNE...not that that does you much good.

Typically, a starship laser has a rate of fire between 1 pulse per 3 minutes
and 1 pulse per 20 seconds - the laser on a scout would normally be closer
to the former, but could fire at higher rates of fire with extra power
(if the ship wasn\'t maneuvering and could devote all power to the laser,
for example.) At ground combat ranges the laser, for all pracitcal purposes,
can\'t miss a vehicular target like a G-carrier; they are (as you say) 
much *much* nearer than space combat targets. A laser hit is pretty much
guaranteed to disable or destroy a G-carrier. On the other hand, the 
G-carrier\'s plasma guns probably deserve a 1 or 2 rating in T4 space
combat terms, and have a higher ROF, so it\'s not very one-sided; the PCs
will have to be clever, ambush the G-carrier, take advantage of surprise,
etc.

I posted them to gdw-beta recently - I\'m waiting for comments before posting
them to TML (and opinions about how interested TML people are - the
rules are fairly long (about 20K.) They actually form the basis for the
new sensors in FFS2, but I have no idea at all if Marc plans to include these
rules in T4.1 - they\'re based on a lot of very detailed simulations of IR

reflected sunlight, sensor sensitivity based on antenna size and temperature,
background radiation from zodiacal dust, etc.)

If we\'re going to be basing this off of comtemporty military ranks of
Earth (which makes sense, being that the RoM proceeded the 3I), then
here are some I picked off my CD-ROM encyclopedia.  It\'s dated 1992, so
any changes since then won\'t be on it (sorry if the spacing is messed up
slighlty):

Well, I hope that\'s helpful to anyone making up alternate rank
structures.  Interesting to see that French ranks, it seems identify
what the person actually commands more so than English or Soviet ones
(ie. Capitaine de fregate  - Captain of a Frigate, etc.).  Also, Soviet
ones have more (rank) Class 1, etc.  Hmmm, interesting.

Thanks,

Hey, thanks for clearing that up for me.  I guess I hadn\'t read the note
I received carefully enough.  Sounds like a case for the errata list,
_unless_ there is more that I don\'t know about it.  Anyway, I\'ve said
my peace.

OK, next time I tell a joke, I\'ll include my tags:

joke goes here so that my meaning is clear, and I am not arousing anybody. :)

As a general rule, when I use a smiley face [ :) ], it is in a

Sorry, but I am just having so much fun, I can hardly bear it. :)

Ok!  Ok!  Not JPEG.  ;-> Let\'s just make sure that anything that is picked

I know next to nothing about PNG, just how widespread is it now, and is it
growing or shrinking?

BMP, PCX, TIFF, GIF and JPEG seem to be the most common among the graphics
editing programs I have.  I didn\'t see PNG listed.
Ghostscript, Galleria, and PMJEG all say they can display PNG, though.

Please, not TIFF!  The only less standardized standard than TIFF is Unix.

Sigh!  The *latest* versions of WORD and WP that *I* own are the versions
before they understood what HTML was.  (Word 6 and WP 6.1) I don\'t want to
upgrade either, because the new versions won\'t run in Win 3.1 or under
OS/2.

Yes, if Lynx will display the pages then Navigator/Explorer shouldn\'t have
a problem with them.

Well, if Lynx can handle the tables...;->

Hee, hee!  I don\'t have a problem *displaying* frames, I just consider them
a total waste of space, time and bandwidth...all sizzle and no steak.

	Two more minor observations from Pocket Empires...

1. In Pocket Empires, Special Weapons DM\'s start at TL 7, i.e. 1970-1979.
Special Weapons in PE are things like biological weapons, planet busters
etc. However, I would have thought that the effectiveness of special
weapons is relative to the time / TL period. For example, American Indians
were supplied by their enemy with blankets that had been saturated with
germs / diseases that they had no immunity to. This era would be around TL 3.

2. Is there another table missing? On page 97, in the paragraph headed Ship
Homeworld, there is an example that states that an adjusted die roll of
four indicates that a ship encountering another ship will find out that it
is from its own homeworld. Where is the table that says this is so?

Should have known the Army Doggies would start to gang up against the
Marines.  Just because we did something you never thought would work.  :-)

Overall I think the subtle changes in most of the posts would add a bit of
color to the structure.  I would keep the Naval Captain though as a rank
and use Commodore for a Captain (O-6), or any officer that outranks the
ship\'s Captain regardless of rank, that is aboard ship but not part of her
crew.

Not me (Deny, Deny, when caught, Lie).  However, in this case, I am saying
the truth.  I only provided you with my personal interpretation of the small
inconsistencies on the scenario.  I do seem to remember someone else
mentionning (for you english speaking individuals out there: does that last
word take two n?) that he was working on such a scenario.  Since I am
running a new group through the original, it would be nice to have some ideas.

Thanks, Eris.  I\'m really not back on the list, though.  I\'ve still

Oh. I must have been failing my SAN checks. Actually, that rather
explains a lot...


  On a more serious note, if a _CT_ resource CD were done
separately of other material (which should avoid any license
questions, as well) who would pay around $80 US for it?

  This represents around 50 little books, of a bit under 50
pages average. Assuming an absolute maximum of 10m/page once
tooled up, that represents 400-man/slave/cultist hours of
semi-skilled labour to produce as OCR\'d/spell-checked .txt files.
No "corrective" editing beyond scan errors, and the big honking
spell-checker library additions can be included, too.

  Assume around $5 physical production costs, mail-order, and
several hundred sales from the list (someone talked about 30
sales in their group of acquaintances), selling a run of 1000
units in about 18 months. Again, measures to reduce losses of
sales from circulation or reproduction of materials seems needed.

  The sales figures are WAG, of course, but the rest isn\'t so
far off. I understand IG is very good at doing mail order, and
I doubt they feel a need to involve needless middle-men. This
could be a well-needed cash cow.

I think what Jonas was trying to say is that JPEG is a lossy image
format. You don\'t notice so much for photographic images, but you\'d
notice a loss with "cartoonish" - or graphic art - images. The
self-disintegrating feature would only happen if you re-saved it as a
JPEG over multiple iterations so that the losses involved with the format
would be cumulative.

	A great oportunity for bounty hunters is finding stolen ships.

	Any Imperial bank hands out lists of serial numbers of jump
	drive, power plants, computers, contra graph and a lot of
	other equipment which was on a ship that now left imperial
	boarder and didnt pay for subsidary contract since years.

	Finding these ships, and hijacking it together with the
	captain, normaly brings 10% of the ships price !

	Other typical jobs are finding the wife of mister jones
	who is the boss of the bank, or rescueing his daughter.

	BTW imperial law normaly is only on startport, sometime
	on downport also, at this places no imperial bounty
	hunters are needed and wanted, as the imperium holds law.

	Each planet has its own law code, and weapons should be
	under this law code. Some planets provide weapon permits
	for holders of the Imperial Class I Licence. These license
	alows ownership of class I equipment at starports, any
	captain has one because of the turret lasers.

I\'m preparing to tabulate the votes as I type this (download in

surprised, and quite pleased.

Who indeed!  It happened that there was a small in-person get-together of
TML folk in Los Angeles last week, and FSY\'s \'Imelda\' class was the
subject of much praise and laughter.  But all of the imagery from this
THUDDD was evocative, well thought out, intriguing, and most important of
all, instantly useable by GMs in their own games.

That \'feeling\' -- that *kind* of feeling -- is what I was chasing.  Being
a gearhead myself, I can \'see\' a ship in my head from just the raw
numbers, with a sketchy description...but there\'s a lot to be said for
fleshing out the details, too.  I\'d say it\'s similar to the different
views of the same building that an architect and an interior designer
have.

There *definitely* will be, perhaps every fourth THUDDD or so.  The next
one may well be a battered TL-11 free trader...sound interesting to
anyone?

I agree that images should be TIFF files as most OCR type software (say
the stuff that comes with fax software) can handle TIFF. My old OCR
unit *produces* TIFF files. And it is black & white only, no gray scale.

For most items in the CT books and even in all but the later issues of
JTAS you only need black, white, and one "primary" color (red, blue,
etc). The covers of JTAS started halftoned art about midway thru, and
then went to 4-color. But the interiors remained 2-color process. It\'s
cheaper. And it means that the interior text and illos can be easily
compressed due to there only being two colors (and white). Using a
format with say 16 colors should save *tons* of space. And the pages
that are only black and white can use 2 two color. Only the covers and
few rare items will need 256 or more colors.

I may have to try getting my (ancient) OCR unit working. I can\'t do a
lot of stuff, but I could try. Or we may have OCR software for the
scanner at work. 

I *know* that it\'ll take lots of proofreading. And the hardest part
will be *not* correcting typos in the original or fixing grammar etc.

I\'m fairly new to this list so forgive me if this has been brought up
before.

I want to design a lower tech (TL-10) Survey vessel. I was thinking of
something along the lines of a 200 ton ship with 2G acceleration. Looking
on the chart I see fuel requirements are 14.3 tons per 20 hours. How long
is an average flight? 

I did some calculations and found it will take about 12 hours for the ship
to reach jump distance on a size class A world. How close do ships arrive
to the destination when they leave jump? The first adventure in the
Anomalies collection requires the players to putter about in system for at
least 200 hours, that would require 143 tons of fuel just for the HEPlaR
drive!

I downloaded the QSDS v1.5 from the web, and its much worse! According to
it the same HEPlaR drive requires 5 tons of fuel per hour. That would
require 1,000 tons of fuel for the first adventure in anomalies.

Am I missing something obvious, or are HEPlaR drive just worthless?

  Probably rather under $5 each, not counting mastering by the actual
producer - or so I was told by someone I was trying to get a quote out of.

  Admin and advertising should be low - plug it on-line and in your
own T4/M:0 products. Run, say 1,000 disks for about $10-15K, mail
order adding S&H, say $80 or 50-60 for 25 book versions (modifying
for price points),

  If the budget explodes to $20K US and sales suck, two or three hundred
units covers your costs. If it works, even better. If it turns out to be
a real hit (and this will likely involve eventual retail coverage and
a lower price per package - OK, cut back the contents), just print another
thousand for $3 or 4K US, and giggle madly until the comptroller puts you
away - or vice versa.

It is also covered in MT. Player\'s manual has stats for all covered ship
weapons, except meson guns and disintigrators (i\'ve got a fix for that,
will post once I triple check my maths while not in pain) and missiles, in
the same formats as personal and support weapons. (Actually, for missiles,
but I just use the stats from COACC).

Most browsers can strip HTML, including LYNX, mosaic, netscape, and IE. You
just save as Text, and you get a preformatted text document. Having worked
with publishing pages under all the above... I found it quite useful when

as, and then opened the text in word, and saved as a word file.

I dunno... I KNOW that every hard-core traveller fan I know wants one, and
it would be a good general release item... I know of 5 people in Anchorage
AK alone who would buy it sight unseen (including myself), in just about
any format, provided it is text, html, or some other textual format (as
opposed to image formats), and is mac and wintel compatable. I DON\'T know
all the traveller players and GM\'s in anchorage, BTW.

I\'d say do at least 3000 disks... so that the new traveller fans can get
ahold of it, too. (If there are ~400, and most of us know 5 or six people
who will buy it, say 2/3ds of us, 320 x 5 = 1600). Basically, for every one
of us and our friends who buy one, so will some nobody. Also, CD Roms have
shelf life. All you have to do is recover the initial costs, and many
places will copy CD\'s for $30 or less. (I can get copies of CD\'s mad
locally, one-off\'s, for $35, assuming it\'s on disk alone. Archival copies
of existing ROMs, $15.)

as far as self-destuctive formats, JPEG (I know from experience) is touchy
in the folloiwing way (each entry is a version of the image)
        scan to bitmap
        save as jpeg
        open JPEG later to bitmap
        resave as JPEG
and you\'ve got two DIFFERENT JPEGs. Most software I\'ve seen pulls files
into a Bitmap of some kind, and you can manipulate that. I used .GIF while
providing images for a telecourse, as .JPEG just does not work well on TV,
or scaled, or any number of other tweaky things that you have to do to put
scanned images on live TV. [nb: I learned to LOVE MS Powerpoint. But only
on a mac. ;-)] .GIF and JPEG are both standards for the web, as far as I
have seen (NCSA Mosaic, NS, and IE all handle both internally).

the Mac standard text editor (SimpleText) has font and style controls.

TNE assume this system for fire fights :

In semi auto mode
Up to 5 shots per round. The first one can be an AIMED one if you\'ve spent
a round to aim. An aimed action has a difficuly level lowered.

Now, the Laser sight allow you to have 3 aimed shot pour round (instead of
one). This is available inside the range of the Laser (which usually is 240m)

So if you don\'t aim, Laser sight are no use.
And then, in auto mode, you cannot have aimed shots so the laser sight
doesn\'t help.


That all I\'m thinking about

Hope that helps

Yes, JPEG is good for images (pictures). But not for B/W Drawings and
nearly awful for text.

JPEG works only in true colors (24 bits). It cannot work on color palet. It
convert the picture into a set of functions (signals). Some functions have
members which are high frequency (you can find them on color straight
changes). If you remove those high frequency, you might not notice it, or
you\'ll need to have the original to notice the difference. As a g=E9n=E9ral
aspect, the borders seems to smooth.

If you have to sharp borders, you can even have an oscillating effect which
can double your border. In all cases your border would be a little thicker.
In case of an B/W drawing, some point of this border can be converted to
grey, which is usually dirty.=20

So JPEG remove a part of information from your picture. In case of full
colored pictures, you won\'t notice it). In case on B/W drawings and
especially text, it immediatly seems dirty. Text has many high frequency
functions.
The remaove part can be controled when you convert the picture. The more
you remove, the more shorter the file is. IMO even a slight remove will be
noticed on text.

Further more you have to convert you 1bits picture into a 24bits picture
before converting. In this cas GIF might be more compact than JPG

Because GIF doesn\'t remove information from you picture, you are sure to
have exaclty the same picture as it could into a plain format such as BMP.
I think that GIF works only on 256 color palet. I\'m not sure you wouldn\'t
have to convert you 1bits picture into 8bits picture before converting it.=
=20

IMO, JPEG format is irrevelant for Traveller pages. The only application
would be the covert pages. As GIF is used on every plateform and well known


If someone could scan a single Traveller page and convert it into JPEG and
GIF and then put it onto a WEB or FTP server it would be great. So we could
try to have a better opinion.

This is a very good idea.  I think this explains why the Droyne [in the
conspiratorial Traveller Universe you are about to enter] allowed the
knowledge that the Droyne were the Ancients to slip out.  They are
hoping that people will start to forget about the Ancients as well once
they know they are/were Droyne.  If you look at the library data in
Traveller a lot of Droyne worlds are also Anicent sites (and in T4 _all_
Droyne worlds are Ancient sites - which I think is a mistake as some
Droyne should have moved in the past 300,000 years).  The Droyne are
probably tired of all those annoying Anthroplogists bothering them.

Yes, you can always use your TL advantage to help you against an enemy, but
this is partly absorbed into the costing for a given level of military force
decreasing by TL. The TL7+ Special Weapons are *fast acting*, *wide area of

relatively short (few months) game turns for PE.

No Table. I\'ve not had a chance to check the book, not having it here at

In that case I\'d say the city ruler could very easily give them what
(who) they wanted in exchange for leaving his city alone. They have no
credible defense even if their attackers were the same TL as they are.

A reasonable expectation given the situation.

In that case a demonstration by the walkers would be more than enough
to get whatever the mercs wanted from the city. Recall that in the
Civil War both sides regularly extorted sizable sums from cities that
had no defenders. In this case the intimidation factor will be even
higher than having 10,000 armed troops show up in the city outskirts.

Do they have access to any advanced digging equipment? The walkers
would be susceptible to falling into holes (deep ones), especially
ones that were camoflaged. Once they are immobilized they would be
vulnerable to being pried open and disabled, even by low tech natives.
Arranging deadfalls, perhaps by setting charges that dump a stone
building on them, could at least inconvenience a walker or a squad of
mercs. Such actions are a bit rough on the city though.

They don\'t need to act "intelligent". They are secure in their
firepower and know what the opposition will have. Think Imperial
Stormtroopers in Return of the Jedi on Endor. They too thought their
armor and firepower would be more than enough against Eewoks and the
odd rebel infantryman.

In a normal situation this would be the correct thinking, too.

There was a Megatraveller book titled COACC that detailed combat
between orbital and ground targets. Basically, starships that can
enter the atmosphere like the scout can fire on ground and other
targets with their ship weapons, but should be a difficult task at
least. There is a -2 to hit if firing lasers through clouds and a -4
if firing through rain as well. Gunnery skill would be needed to
improve the chance, but the g-craft are small targets and would add to
the difficulty of hitting them. Ship lasers also have a 45 meter
danger area, so make sure you fire at the craft before they get near
the city...

If you hit the craft, don\'t worry about damage. There won\'t be
anything left from even a near miss...

Depends on their fanaticism and the amount of initiative you decide to
give them. If the bulk of the merc crew was killed, undoubtedly the
rest would disengage (and try to find out who did this to them).

Think hitting a bee with a baseball bat. Scouts aren\'t very
maneuverable in an atmosphere; I think the only thing they are capable
of is landing and muddling through a planet\'s air. Better to take
potshots at the craft with the lasers than risk ramming them with the
scout. While the starship would handle the impacts, if they missed
while close to the ground the impact with the planet could be another
story indeed.

You probably need to decide how many casualties the mercs will stand
for before breaking off the mission. This in turn will reflect on
their morale and fanaticism (and how desperate they are for the
money).

>The walkers should be around TL 10, I\'d say... what TL would you

I have no idea, but TL 10 would be proof against what the PC\'s are
carrying unless carefully emplaced on vulnerable portions of the
walkers.=20

Probably has reflec armor built into the suits as well. Lasers are
standard weapons at that TL, so carbines won\'t be very effective. If
the PC\'s have enough explosives I would rig deadfalls on any obvious
approach points to where the target is kept.It\'s going to be messy,
though no matter how the PC\'s go about it.

Their best bet will be to intercept the carriers with the scout and
drop them with the ship weapons. If they decide to stay and fight they
should lose unless they get creative with the explosives. Without the
required skills I don\'t know if they could emplace them effectively
without blowing themselves up. Do they have any demolition skills?

The Traveller Adventure (1983, for CT) has, on p 112, the use of a 
"breakout point", which is just such a deep space refuelling station.  
This pre-dates Alien Module 6 (1986) significantly.  I\'m sure someone 
will find an even earlier reference soon!

That was my understanding of "classic" navigation.  I recall several 
instances (none of which I have checked recently, so I may be remembering 
incorrectly) where published books state "the jump-4 route across the rift 
was not dicovered until year xxx".  There is little need for deepspace 
refuelling, if a J-6 ship can find room for 60% fuel, so can a J-1 ship.  A 
J-1 ship with fuel for 6 jumps can cross the rift quite nicely, thank you, 
albeit more slowly than a J-4 ship.  It may be convenient to assume that 
sensor TL is related to overall TL so that you can determine presence of GG 
at 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-parsecs at TL equal to build J-1, J-2 etc.  This means that 
you cannot safely determine the route across the rift until your sensor TL 
is around 13.  You could try blind luck at earlier TL, but that sounds 
expensive in terms of lost ships!

Based on a recent idea on the TML, I am currently favouring the "jump space 
is a Ancient artifact and a Jump drive is just an interface device".  It is 
then easy (for the referee) to state that you can only jump to and from 
"occupied" hexes (no more deep space depots).  One of the big drawbacks to 
this approach is that you can\'t use the 2 x J-1 trick in The Traveller 
Adventure to move away from the Aramis Trace and into the interesting 
adventure areas.

For me, the loss of 2 x J-1 is not a problem as I intend to adopt a mixed 
stutterwarp / jump universe, as I find no problem with the T2300 / FF&S 
stutterwarp in a Traveller universe where Jump drives reign supreme <dons 
flame proof TL16 Battle Dress from RoM to protect himself from followers of 
"true" canon).

Ship based computers in CT were always like this in my view of the 
universe!  The main complaint I have seen in the past is that the 
computers are so large compared to 1997 <or whenever> PCs.

In my opinion, ship\'s computers in Traveller are not too large - I used to 
think they were until I went on site to my first chemical plant (I\'m a 
chemical engineer).  The size of computers for chemical plant control has 
not reduced significantly in the last 15 years.  Let us look at the latest 
in high-tech control:

A computer with relatively little computing power that took up two large 
rooms ... no, it is not a mainframe but a triple-redundant set of 
controlers (200 dedicated Intel 386 chips) with a Pentium class 
"supervisory" computer and separate Pentium class "engineering" station 
where the control system can be re-programmed.  The actual computer kit 
takes up the space of three large desks, plus (of course) "crew" 
workstations (chair, keyboards, screens).  The controllers were on easily 
accessible racks so that a failed component (spotted by the 2-out-of-3 
voting system) could be replaced without interupting the operation of the 
plant.  (On a ship this would be a maintenace hatch and Star-Trek style 
crawl ways).

The spare controllers are kept in a special cabinet where the printed 
circuit boards are continually checked by a separate diagnostic computer 
so that replacement boards are "guaranteed" working.

The computer room is only part of the equipment needed ... a "switch room" 
contains all of those carefully labelled cables taking control signals 
from the computer out to the valves and bringing measurements back from 
instruments out on the plant.  A typical switch room has two 
double-wardrobe sized units, again with personnel access.

The control system is capable of fully automated start-up or shutdown of 
the plant; due to safety rules there are various "pauses" where the system 
reports "I have finished sequence B, is it OK to start sequence C?".  To 
save money, many of the valves are manually operated, so someone outside 
on the plant has to open up various valves at different stages of the 
process, but on other plants (nuclear power stations) all valves are 
automated.

The supervisory control system is an "expert system\' that assesses the 
current operation of the plant and suggests changes to the operating 
parameters.  For some optimisations, these changes to the parameters are 
done automatically while, for others, human confirmation is again 
required.

The above computer system (known as Distributed Control System, or DCS) 
has a mean-time between failures (for the system) of around 12 years, but 
it is possible to add another parallel safety system (and about 50% to 
space) that increases the MTBF to some astronomically high figure.  My 
Pentium-class PC running Win 95 requires a reboot about once a day on 
average.

If anyone has worked on rack-mounted lab-scale control and instrumentation 
systems, they will be able to confirm that ship\'s computer sizes in 
traveller are not unreasonable.  When it comes to power requirements in 
CT, I may chose to diverge from canon slightly :-)

do not remove material, please, with the possible exception of artwork

> Scan every page and convert to text, then make it hypertext.

A dream comes true (well, possibly).  This is such a mind-bogglingly 
wonderful idea that I would hate to see it be put on the back burner 
for too long.  I\'m no expert in the field of game publishing, but I 
suspect that sales of this ($200 ??) CD would be limited to Traveller 
fans like me.  There will obviously be a cost vs sales trade-off that 
would be hard to estimate.

As others have suggested, one source of cheap (but potentially 
unreliable - no offence intended) labour is the TML fans ... I for one 
would be happy to proof read a scan + ocr of one (or even five) 
Traveller product(s), edit the tables to line up properly and edit the 
graphics into separate .gif files ready for Acrobat to work it\'s magic.

The Encyclopedia Brittanica on CD (which I have) does not have any 
significant hypertext links, but that does not stop it being a terrific 
resource due to the search engine.  The Brittanica uses HTML so that a 
Web browser can be used to view the text and graphics ... this seems 
definately the way to go for the Traveller CD as HTML browsers are 
available for Macs, Linux, OS/2, Windows (and probably others!) 

I would therefore recommend:

1) scan / ocr / edit,

2) format as an HTML document (no hypertext links) with .gifs 
   in the right location (near relevant text),

3) organise into a suitable directory structure, for example:

   Classic   <dir>
     Book_1  <dir>
     Book_2  <dir>
     etc
   Challenge <dir>
     01      <dir>
     02      <dir>
     etc
   JTAS      <dir>
     01      <dir>
     02      <dir>
     etc
   
  I\'m sure you get the idea.  The \\JTAS\\01 directory would contain
  one article per html document, plus a bunch of gifs for various
  illustrations that you are allowed to include (not possible for
  all artists due to copyright / difficulty in contacting.)

4) Create a large index (using a commercial indexer) that allows
   you to look up any word and get a list of all documents that
   contain that word ... this is not a difficult task my experts
   at work tell me (we are looking at scanning our document
   archives with OCR + indexing).
   
5) publish the CD-ROM with permission for people to create hypertext
   linked versions of the documents.  As long as I kept my hard
   disk copy of the files in the correct directory structure, I
   could replace the "original" html file with a version with
   hypertext links in it.  The fans who write the hypertext versions
   will know what the directory structure should be so that their
   feature-enhanced documents will work properly with other docs
   enhanced by a different fan.

This approach means that production of the CD is not reliant on TMLers 
meeting schedules to create hyperlinked versions.  It also means that 
the most manhour intensive task (hypertext links) is not included in 
the original CD, reducing costs significantly but allowing relatively 
easy extention of the work by computer literate Traveller fans and 
published on Web sites around the world.  I could choose my favorite 
"enhanced" version of each document, replace references to "this 
picture note included" with a suitable .gif of my own creation (or 
downloded from the web sites from artistic TMLers).


Now, where do I send my money for a pre-order copy? :-)

Your analysis is not complete, as it does not account for the fact that 
heat capacity is not constant.  I can assure you that from basic 
principles that if you heat up the water until it decomposes and then 
cool it down (cunnily preventing the spontaneous re-combustion likly at 
temperatures above 800K) the net heat input will be similar to the heat 
of formation of water ... that is essentially how heat of formatiuon 
is defined (i.e. take H2 and O2 at 300 K, heat up to any temperature you 
want and make them react, possibly with the assistance of a catalyst, 
then recover the heat until the H2O is at 300 K ... the overall energy 
change is the heat of formation of water and is not affected by the 
intermediate temperatures used).

The heat of formation should be very similar to the energy needed to 
split water using electrolysis (as the energy input should be equal to 
the heat of formation).

That\'s the text I used at Uni too!

Where did the idea that the Darrians were at TL 17+ before they
torched themselves?  I seem to remember that Darrian was rated at TL
16 because of the large number of TL 16 relics from the Maghiz; the
actual manufacturing capabilities were more liek TL 12, with eth TL 16
artifacts kept operating on spare parts, luck, and ingenuity.  Thus
pre-Maghiz Darrian was at TL 16, and the startrigger (aka a
space-science cock-up to end all!) was TL 16.

If you want a book that reads like a Traveller adventure, right down
to a group of military veteran PCs with Soc from about 3 to about 12,
then try Iain M. Banks, Against a Dask Background.  Some great tech
ideas too: electronic foam, blood fealty, overhang houses, crystal
virus, smart monowheel vehicles, and the Lazy Gun.

     You may well be right, it\'s a while since I read this stuff.
     
     Boring rules stuff:  Aren\'t computers at TL16 semi-sentient and 
     sentient by TL17?  (MT Ref\'s Manual, I think.)  Since you can 
     design *experimental* stuff one TL above your own (ship design 
     section in Ref\'s Manual) ... there may be some sentient TL17 
     computers left lying around in relic ships.
     
     My true feelings: even if the canon lot find holes in the above, 
     I find it an interesting idea.  Players stumble into a ship with 
     sentient computer that\'s a relic from Darrian\'s past.  Cue: 
     interesting personality for the computer, complete with funny 
     voice, etc.  In fact, this may well happen to my players in a 
     week.  I just need to decide on the right funny accent, 
     personality and name for the computer - any ideas out there?

	Depends entirely on how far away the destination is :).  Actually,
it sounds like our first design efforts were remarkably similar; the first
thing I tried to desing using SSDS (which I prefer to QSDS) was a TL-9
fusion rocket propelled 800 td lab ship.  I had visions of it being used
for expeditions to the Oort cloud...

	Basically, no.  Apparently HEPlaR drives are actually
unrealistically fuel-efficient, according to those in the know on the list.
T-plates are real science-fictiony reactionless drives, which means that
they don\'t generate thrust by expelling reaction mass; they simply generate
thrust by the reality-bending effect of collective handwaving :).  Since
HEPlaR drives generate thrust by accelerating nuke-damped fusing hydrogen
(aka reaction mass) up to relativistic speeds and spraying it out the back
and ghod have mercy upon anyone standing behind the ship, they are
obviously more limited in that they have to lug a lot of it around in order
to get anywhere.

	HEPlaR ships wouldn\'t be under constant acceleration unless they
had honking great big fuel tanks.  What they would do is boost at very high
G\'s for a shortish period of time, and then coast to the turnaround point,
turn around, and decelerate.  While the initial acceleration would be high,
the average velocity would be low and travel times longer because only a
brief part of the trip would be spent boosting.

	A T-plate ship would boost at lower G\'s, but keep it up for much
longer; all the way to the half-way mark, at which point they\'d just
turnaround and begin deceleration.  So, although the acceleration is low,
the average velocity is higher and travel time is shorter because the ship
is accelerating up to the halfway point.

	I actually kinda like the low-tech Fusion and HEPlaR drives,
personally; they just add more constraints to design around.  While at
TL-12 you can do some pretty high-performance designs, at TL-9 or 10 you
have to try harder, and it\'s more fun that way.

	Thanks Andy. Much of what you state IS missing from Pocket Empires! The
three lines of DM\'s above and the result line have not been included in PE.
Only the line "Roll 1D..." and the example was included. Looks like it was
edited out to make all the paragraphs fit onto that page okay!

WRONG (sorry to say)...
SoA states that Yaskodray pinced off three worlds one of which is 
remarkably SIMILAR to the Droyne homeworld... Hoiwever both are not 
the same!
MM said on the list that in Shionty belt there exists yet another 
Pocket Universe (YAPU), which in turn contains the Droyne homeworld.

The trick is you don\'t run the drive full time, just build up a significant
velocity and coast. Run your HEPlaR drive for an hour or two and then
switch it off. The great advantage of Thruster is that you can run your
drive full time.

Sorry, it\'s not. Adventure 12 states that one of the worlds in the pocket
universe is inhabited by Droyne (ancient variant, i.e. no mystic aspect)
and has been seeded many species of plants and animals from Eskayloyt. In
an E-mail to the TML Marc Millar stated in an off-hand manner that Shinothy
was the Droyne homeworld and that it was destroyed when Yaskoydray pinched
off the pocket universe. For myself personally, I\'d much rather have
Eskayloyt still around somewhere intact (would make for one epic adventure
to find it); but as far as the canon evidence goes, Shinothy was the Droyne
Homeworld and it was destroyed when Yaskoydray created his pocket universe
(incidentally this was after the Final War had ended, Grandfather isn\'t at
all sentimental apparently).

Exactamundo. To increase the "hit rate" of OCR, they do the same thing
that the (ill-fated) Newton did - they do a dictionary lookup on all words
to make sure that every word is OCR\'ed into a real word... which kinda
sucks if you\'re OCR\'ing words that aren\'t in the dictionary. Solution:
add them to the dictionary... or, turn off dictionary lookup (if that\'s an
option) and watch everything turn to greek.

BTW, this may sound silly, but has anybody suggested that Marc pick up
the phone and call someone at TSR and ask them how they did it? I mean,
this isn\'t a new, bleeding edge project. It\'s been done, in the same 
industry. Finding someone who has done it before would make life a lot
easier. Marc or Loren must know _somebody_ at TSR after all these years...

Also, 10 minutes per page for scanning is silly. What you do is cut the spine
out of the book and feed it through a scanner with a sheet feeder. You
could probably do an entire Alien module in 20 minutes or less. Of course,
you destroy the poor thing in the process... *sniff*

Finally, someone asked why JPEG was a bad idea. JPEG is a "lossy" format -
you put 200Kb of information in, the JPEG compression engine gives you
100Kb of information out. In that process a lot of information isn\'t just
compressed - it\'s thrown out! Take a small bitmap of black text on a white
background and convert it to JPEG, then view it, maybe blow it up by
200%. It looks awful. Illegible actually. TIFF, GIF, PNG, BMP, heck, plain raw
bits, anything is better for digitized text than JPEG.

My 2 cents: scan everything, OCR it, then send it out to a bunck of voluteers
to edit. Collect it back up, slap it on a CD, sell it. I\'m sure that there
would be enough volunteers that you could edit everything into a decent state
in a few months, for nothing more than a free copy of the final product and
their names in the credits. I\'m not saying it would be a fast project, but
slow and cheap is sometimes better than fast and expensive.

Ah, Code Duello!
I like the idea of this becoming a theme for Nobles in Traveller, adds a bit 
of \'style\' to it.  Also interests me because I am a student of that 
dicipline.  I belong to a historical re-enactment group (Society for 
Creative Anachronism, ever hear of it?).  Basicaly I belong to a houshold of 
fencers called the \'Black Masque\', so I understand some of the basic stuff. 
 I have been given the honor of puting up the Household Webpage @ 
http://www.magicnet.net/~cmdrx/masque/ . Not too much there yet, but we hope 
to post more links and information.  Of course you could always email my 
Maistro, Herre Wulfe van der Russ(address is on page).  He loves talking 
about the sword. :-)

I can tell you that there are many styles of fencing today, and in the next 
2500 years or so I would believe there would be thousands more.  But the 
basic styles you mentioned are correct:

French, the basic stuff you see on TV and movies, with the off-hand up for 
balance

English, the off-hand is on the hip.

Italian, a more forceful style, the arm is more exteneded, developed to 
pierce armor.  As a matter of fact the style sometimes tied the sword to the 
forearm with a \'martingale\', little more than a leather strap.

Spanish, very elegant, very precice and mathematical.  From what I 
understand it involves moving in a criss-crossing octogonal pattern.  I 
would assume somebody got hold of the Moorish mathematics and sciences and 
developed a geometric approach to fighting.

Florintine is using two weapons at once.

Not only this,  but you have styles depending on the type of blade, for 
example the sabre uses cutting and slashing moves, while the foil and epee 
rely on thrusts.

Thats just some very basic concepts, and it may not be entirely correct. 
 I\'ve been \'playing\' for 5 years, but I haven\'t realy \'studied\' the art. :-)

I believe that in the future, as cultures on our world grow closer, there 
will be fusion styles.  It is already begining now.  I have seen Iaido and 
Kendo moves used in fencing styles (mostly for parries).  Who knows, maybe 
someone would develop a technique in which psionics are used to sense where 
bullets are flying and give the swordmaster ability to deflect them? :-)

As I said, since I didn\'t have any good data for the temperature 
dependence of C_p,m of H2O(g) I had to use the approximate figures.
The constant values aren\'t *that* bad for C_P, surely?  (Factor of 2 
error, perhaps 3, would be my guess at an upper bound.]

Thank you, I\'ll try to remember that next time I lecture any

Yes, but the question of heat loss, extra work required for 
compression, non-reversibilty of processes means that they won\'t be 
the same, and the question I was answering was "How much extra work 
might it take to thermally decompose water?"

There is a thoroughly neato-mosquito little utility for the Mac called
Columnbo, which will let you load a text file, a table, for instance, and
then set where you want column breaks, by adjusting little sliders at the
top. Then it will save the results as a tab delimited text file.

I used it to instantly chop up the online sector files into tab-delimited
ones to stuff into a databse or Excel, as well as other similar taks, like
recreating tables.

The version I have, unfortunately, is limted to 32k chunks, because of the
standard toolbox TextEdit routine.

It\'s $15 shareware, available in most fine Mac online archives. I\'ve never
run across a wintel version of this program or even something similar...if
anyone knows of one, please let me know, because I\'ve had projects at work
that have taken a couple days longer than necessary because I needed to
drag the file home to my Mac to get it processed properly.

        Dueling with a pistol is tougher than you might think.  Assuming
that traditional rules still apply (dueling with SMG\'s would sort of defeat
the purpose), each duellist is given a weapon with a single shot.  They
stand back-to-back, walk ten (or so) paces, turn and fire.  Essentially the
duelist is offered two choices- he can turn and fire a snapshot, hoping he
hits and incapacitates his opponent, or else he can take his time, aim
carefully, and pray the other guy\'s shot doesn\'t kill him first.  If a man
fires and misses, he has to literally stand there and wait for his opponent
to take his shot.  Talk about nerve-wracking.  If both parties miss, they
reload and try again.
        As dueling with swords became formalized over the course of the
Renaissance, a wide variety of weapons and styles were employed against one
another.  The major styles were:

French:  This is the classic fencing style, surviving today in sport
fencing.  Each opponent fights with a single sword.  Emphasis was placed on
targeting the opponent\'s torso, because frankly it gave the most likely odds
for a fatal or incapacitating hit.

Florentine:  The Italians used the same fencing style as the French, but
went one better- their duelists fought with weapons in both hands.  Target
areas are the same as the French, but some greater emphasis was also placed
on targeting the opponent\'s arms.  This became the preeminent style after a
time, because two weapons are almost always better than one, if the duelist
has enough dexterity.  Over time, Florentine spawned a wide vareity of
combinations:  sword and dagger, sword and sword, sword and cloak (my
favorite), and sometimes sword and dueling glove, which was a glove fitted
with chain mail on the back and palm, and allowed for catching or blocking
an opponent\'s weapon.

Spanish:  Very scary style.  The opponents fight with their weapons held at
shoulder-height, arms slightly bent and elbows facing away from each other.
The only acceptable targets are the head and neck.  Nearly always fought
with two swords per duelist.  It\'s nerve-wracking even to SPAR with this style.

Elizabethan:  Quite the opposite of Spanish, Elizabethan-style fencers fight
from a crouch, shoulders hunched, and crab-walk around one another.
Acceptable targets are the torso, arms, and legs.  To make matters worse,
Elizabethan is also fought with two weapons per opponent, usually dagger and
sword or sword and sword.  Easily the most physically demanding of the
styles, requiring coordination, excellent balance, and high dexterity, not
to mention calves and thighs of solid steel!

        In addition to this, there were several schools of dueling in Europe
that revolved around fighting with such incongrous weapons as two-handed
swords and polearms.  A duel with two-handed swords would be a real dance,
because both opponents have to keep the weapons in motion- a block
immediately turns into an attack, and back again, until someone finally
slips up.

        These at least are the major European styles, as they were taught to
me.  Hope this is of some help to you.

The .html file is smaller than .txt file because some formatting was
performed (multiple spaces removed; carriage returns removed within

This took about an hour to do all of it (scan it, save in different
formats, OCR the .TIF file, perform simple editing in OCR software,
export to .TXT file, import into Word 97, format it there, save as HTML
file).

Personally, I would like to see a format such as HTML used since it is
text based, it would be easier to index than an image format or PDF
format.  RTF format might be an alternative as many word processors can
read it.

But by having rank O-1 through O-3 identical to the Navy ranks, with the
exception of the prefix "Force", you eliminate all confusion.  In the
modern military, you call a Lieutenant Colonel "colonel" and anything with
stars "General".. Having a Marine O-3 asa Force Lieutenant, and called
"Skipper" by his troops would prevent such oddities as having two (or more)
people aboard a ship who can be adressed as Captain.

	Remember, in the 18th century, swords were popular on the
Continent for settling disputes, but pistols were the rule-of-thumb here
in the US.  I guess we started that love affair with guns early.

	The Spanish and Italian schools were famous early on, although the
Spanish school mutated into the Destreza system, which did not find a lot
of popularity abroad.  France and Italy had good reputations by the
17th-18th centuries.  Italians had the rep of being sneaky and crafty.

	Renaisance Swordsmanship by John Clement is a new and pretty good
book.  They are some GREAT books on the history of dueling, but the ones I
have are out of print.

	Clements book is $25 and can be ordered at 1-800-392-2400.

	Laterish!

Well, I don\'t know what the PC will do in the end, but from what
I\'m gathering from you and the other TMLers the starship will be
a real asset. A weapon which automatically hits at "few tens of
km" would be very powerful.
As I said before, the Merc ship will not be allowed to interfere
due to limitations imposed by the Imperium/Zhodani peace treaty
for the system.
In order to give a chance to my players, I decided that the
Mercs would be a little overconfident, and after the initial
sensor checks and a couple high altitude recon flights by the
shuttles they will decide that the city does not possess high TL
resources. This is in fact true, and matches the data supplied
by the Mercs patron.
I\'d say that the PCs starship will escape these cursory checks,
being under the sea level with engines and other systems off.
The only source of electrical power in the city is the small
generator used by the ex-Scout living there, and it will be
(correctly) identified as a non-threatening civilian unit. The
PCs have an Air-Raft, but it is currently parked in a city
building, with all systems turned off.

I don\'t know what the players will decide to do. Their main goal
is getting the hostage away alive. The "pull" in their case is
ownership of the scout... the Patron hinted that he could gave
it to them if they succeed.
I have no idea of what they will end up with. For now they don\'t
even suspect about Mercs presence in the system, and are just
visiting the city and trying to gather info.

Thank you for your view on the situation. Yes, they could just
do it, in fact. I\'ll have to think this over... but see below
for a more detailed analysis of the situation.

>It might not work, but then again it just might and if it
>did you could have a "Mercs chase the PC\'s as the PC\'s try to get back to
>their ship and off planet" scenerio.  
Note that the Mercenaries can\'t do much about the players\' ship
if they decide to just run away. The ship is less than a Km.
from the coast, and it can be easily reached by putting on vacc
suits and going down with the air raft. The PCs could get inside
without even alerting the Mercs. The ship has refueled at the
gas giant and it\'s ready to jump back to Imperial Space.  The
main threat would be from the orbiting Merc ship...

OTOH, I dont\' think that the local ruler would like this idea.
He could think it\'s safer to just hand the hostage to the
attackers... he can\'t be sure that they wouldn\'t destroy the
city as revenge (as I said before, the Mercs won\'t do it, but he
can\'t possibly know, and he *would*, if he were in their shoes).
From the Ruler point of view, the choices are the following: 
a) Hand out the hostage, losing face with his people, but saving
   the city.
b) Give the hostage to the PCs, risking revenge from the Mercs
   (and losing, in a minor way, face with the population).
c) Refuse to hand over the hostage and die in a blaze of glory,
   showing that *he* wouldn\'t give in to any extraplanetary
   invader.
d) Trust the PCs in organizing a resistance... similar to (c),
   but with a (low) chance of actually working, and if it does
   indeed work, he will be able to reap public prestige for
   having been able to repel the invading force, even if most of
   the work would have been done by the PCs.
   
Knowing the guy, he would probably go for (d), unless,
obviously, the PCs come up with something different, or make
some mistake which convince people they are incompetent fools.
Another factor is the presence of the retired-Scout NPC, who
acts as an advisor and would vote for (a) but could finally be
convinced to go for either (b) or (d). He does not trust the
Mercs.
There is a Zhodani spy in the city, but he will probably prefer
not to act: if the Mercs kill anyone in the city this will
negatively influence any chance of the planet going back to the
Imperium, and he would definitely like either (a) or (d) which
could both cause political problems between the city and
Imperial forces in the future. He does not want (c): he is not a
cold blooded, uncaring, communist psi-monster mutant traitor,
Imperial propaganda notwithstandig.  
Unfortunately he can\'t ask for outside help; the landing of
Zhodani troops would cause a political incident.
If the PCs help save the city and casualties are low enough,
they will probably end up getting the hostage for free: after
the battle the chief will be easily convinced that *not* having
the guy around is the wisest choice.

Well, they could take a long detour before reaching their
destination planet... Thank you for these ideas, they could
prove useful if the PCs manage to avoid a showdown.

>OTOH, if *you* (or your players) are set on a combat scenario then go for

Again, can\'t say for now. I\'d like a combat scenario (just out
of diversity, I tend to go for the investigative approach) but I
don\'t want to force it on my players.

Yes, I hope that the PCs will show some ingenuity in this.
Perhaps mining buildings just inside the wall gates in order to
trap the walkers under the debris. One of them has some (low)
Demolitions skill.
If they go for the _Seven Samurai_ idea I\'ll let them try some
stuff against the two walkers and use the third one (the one on
the bottom of the river) as a nasty surprise to make things more
interesting.

Well, it does... thanks to your explanation.

Well, one of the possibility for the PCs could be leaving the
ship just below the surface, with only the laser turret outside.
This would probably give them the chance to put out a hit (i.e.
an automatic kill) on the incoming carriers. The surviving one
will have to choose what to do... attacking the starship, going
for its original mission (using the buildings for cover),
running away...

BTW, up to what range can the G-Carriers weapons fire?
Also, the starship can travel at up to 2-G... to which speed can
the G-Carriers fly? IIRC they are a kind of armored Air Raft, so
their speed should be in the 100-120 Km/h range. Which speed can
the starship manage in the atmosphere?
