RELEASE:  95-145

STUDY SHOWS FEASIBILITY OF PLANT-BASED LIFE SUPPORT SYSTEMS

    The science fiction concept of plants providing a complete 
life support system for the crews of lunar and deep-space 
missions came a step closer to reality with the successful 
completion of a NASA life sciences experiment that studied 
potato production in a self-contained environment.
 
    "We have demonstrated that a bioregenerative life support 
system really can support humans in an enclosed environment 
over a long period of time,\'\' said Kennedy Space Center (KSC) 
plant physiologist Dr. Gary Stutte.  "Our long-range goal is to 
prove that a plant-based life support system is as reliable as 
the mechanical systems found in today\'s spacecraft." 

    KSC scientists conducted a successful 418-day experiment in 
the Biomass Production Chamber of the Controlled Environment 
Life Support System.  The experiment investigated how well a 
biogenerative life support system can perform on a continuous 
basis over an extended period of time.  This experiment was the 
longest test of a major component of a bioregenerative life 
support system ever completed.

    During the experiment, the potato plants produced enough 
oxygen to support one crew member on a continuous basis, while 
also removing excess carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, Stutte 
said.  In addition, the potato crops produced enough food to 
supply 55 percent of the caloric needs of an astronaut, along 
with enough purified water for a total of four crew members.  A 
larger chamber could be used to provide all the consumables for 
the crew for as long as a mission might last, Stutte said.

    "The major advantage of the bioregenerative life support 
system is that it does not need to be resupplied with food, 
water and air, nor does it require expendable water or air 
filtration systems as present-day mechanical spacecraft life 
support systems do," said Dr. Bill Knott, chief scientist of 
Biological Programs for the NASA/KSC Biomedical Operations 
Office.  Instead, the current system recycles plant waste and 
nutrients.  This recycled material sustains the plant crops, 
which in turn produce the oxygen, water and food that the crew 
would need for an indefinite period of time.

    Once the analyses of the KSC experiments are complete, they 
will be provided to NASA\'s Johnson Space Center (JSC) Houston, 
Knott said.  JSC research personnel will then use this data to 
conduct research on the effectiveness of bioregenerative life 
support systems with human subjects. 

    "We have been supplying this kind of information since we 
first began growing crops at KSC in 1987," Knott said.  "Some 
of our data was used in preparing a recent JSC experiment where 
a British chemist was supplied with all of his oxygen and 
carbon dioxide removal requirements in a sealed chamber for 15 
days by a crop of 30,000 wheat plants."

    Because of the success KSC has had with potatoes, this crop 
will make up 75 percent of the food for the next bioregenerative
life support system experiment, Stutte said.  Wheat will make up
the remaining 25 percent of the crop during the two-year study
that will begin in January 1996.  "We feel that a mixed crop is
needed to optimize system production," Stutte said. "Potatoes
provide the highest yield, but wheat is more tolerant to longer
light cycles that might be used in the chamber."

    The planned longer studies also will provide more data on 
the ability of the bioregenerative life support systems to 
operate over an expected three-year mission to Mars.  "We feel 
that we can keep this system going indefinitely," Knott summed 
up. "There is no reason to believe we can\'t."

That assumes that the target is active.  Admitidly, in BL/BR as it stands there
is no reason to ever use passive sensors----but if you\'ve fixed the sensor 
problem (so actives have a place in the world) ships might not want to drive 
around active.  And why are tiny missiles special?  Other ships/craft aren\'t
always detetcted?  Were our F117s always detected over Iraq (aside from "hey
there\'s an F117 up there, the SAM site next door just blew up!"  The adavnces
in stealth need to be thought about, as well (once they\'re just pellets, they\'re
not trailing plasma).

OK.  Medium range.  Your Scout fires at one missile and kills it (allowing
weaponss to engage multiple targets in some kind of inside a hex close in
defense is one thing, but at "normal" ranges, you get one laser, one kill).
The other 9 in the spread hit the next turn (Scout going 4, missiles going 6, 
and then they take up the slack at 12gs (relative velocity is 22).  How many
can that laser shoot?  My rules would allow each laser to shoot twice in this
case, once before a det-laser would go off, and once right after.  Maybe this
should be one target for each 10 shots (assuming they\'re in the same spread, 
so they aren\'t too far apart in an angular sense).  For every 5 shots at a +1
diffmod per shot.  That means the scout could shoot 10 shots at the 9 
remaining missiles.  Since 5% will get through, he might just kill all of them.
If there were 20 he\'d be in trouble.  Assuming this is only the case *inside*
det-laser range, then KKMs wouldn\'t be too efficient, but they are *still*
possible.

I think we need to state what rules are being used here.  If we stick to TNE/
BL, the missiles don\'t *get* detected a few turns out.  And regardless of
what rules you use, if you use the TNE task system 5% will get through each
line of defence.  Period.  And one KE missile at 10-20 hexes a turn will wreak
your whole day (even in a BB :-)  I don\'t have anything against the det-laser
weapons, but saying "they\'ll all get shot down (because I say so), so they
don\'t exist" seems silly to me (I\'m arguing out loud with GDW, BTW :)

Repulsors?  I don\'t have FFS in front of me.  What TL do those start getting
used?  Will they be much use to people in RCES at TL12?  All the defenses you
mention have a place, but then you have to add them to your ship design, and
FFS ships are kinda tight as it is.  ESA will work against pellets, actually.
I put ESA on my ships as it is for just that reason.  I bet they are cheaper
than the repulsors...

I was planning on a slight revision to my sensor rules.  It will have auto-
matic Bogey Detection at some range (same as against active, I imagine) if
the target is using gturns.  Even if you give a missile a Bogey Detection,
it\'ll be hard to lock the sucker (again, at least 5% won\'t even be locked on.
Ever (er, well, in a given turn, by a given ship).  

I don\'t debate they\'d be somewhat easy to kill, but they are really nasty if
they hit.  They way to find out is to fix the rules so they make sense, allow
both (more?) kinds of missile, and see what different battles show out (this
will vary by TL, no doubt).

And there is still the fact that not all ships will be able to have a missile
defense at all time... hell, look at the Valor.  That ship is screwed----that
or it wastes all its offensive power to defend itself, *then* gets killed.

I never claimed that they were. I answered the question with information 
that I had. Maybe I should have made it a bit clearer that the information 
was specifically post-WWII Royal Navy definitions.

But Russian destroyers are roughly equivalent to RN/USN frigates. Russian 
frigates are roughly equivalent to RN fast attack boats (I don\'t know what 
the USN equivalent is - assuming there is one).

OK, I\'ve calmed down a lot since I read this, so I\'ll try not to get upset 
and rant. You made an unfortunately all too common mistake and (hopefully 
unintentionally) gave considerable offence.

I was born in the west of Scotland (i.e. in the Hebrides). This makes me two 
things: it makes me Gaidhealtachd (lit. of the people of the Gael - i.e. 
Gaelic) and it makes me Scottish (or British if you want to be picky). IT 
DOES NOT MAKE ME ENGLISH!

Sorry. Rant over.

You were right to point out (as perhaps I should have done) that the 
examples were specific to the Royal Navy at a specific point in history, and 
that other navies do things differently. I merely quoted what I know.

One of the things I used to find interesting when I was in the Navy (Royal 
Navy) was visiting other warships and seeing how they do things.

Notes:

The Viiborg is designed to be carried aboard the Tempere Modular Transport. It
is also used at refueling space stations built around gas giants. The crew live
on the mothership or space station. The fuel on the Viiborg can be used by the
Tempere directly as if the Viiborg were an auxillary fuel tank or it can be
pumped into the Tempere\'s normal fuel tanks.

The Viiborg is built on Mnemosyne (0232 Foreven sector) in the Wilds.

I hope you find this useful. I will be working on the Tempere and it\'s modules
and small craft next.

Using the energy from a black globe to power stuff doesn\'t make much sense for 
combat, its not too reliable a source of energy. What I meant was that HPGs are 
the major limiting factor as to how powerful a weapon you can mount, power 
plants themselves are much less of an issue until you really overpower a weapon. 
So if you used this jump HPG (powering it from the normal power plant), then you 
could power your spinal PAW or whatever to the maximum possible power for its 
length was, without needing to fit all of the giant HPG you would need for this.

I really like this idea. One thing I wonder though, is whether all that hydrogen 
in the fuel tanks is just there as fuel to charge the HPGs. If it was, wouldn\'t 
it be much easier to charge it off the normal power plant. It seems that jump 
needs the hydrogen for something more than just charging the capacitors up.

Yes, I spent my involuntary leave of TML doing something worthwile: a 
among other things, a partial economic analysis of the Regency: I\'m 
posting only the summary here, as I doubt if TML would 
like such a large posting of statistics.

All information is based strictly on current UWP data of the Regency, c.1200.
(See Guatney\'s files at the Ghost site)

Regina: I\'d like to point out how extraordinary Regina subsector 
is.  First, it has the highest tech, most populous system coreward of 
Rhylanor: Efate (1705 A646A30-E B Hi In An   100 RE K4V).  [Note: why 
isn\'t Efate, rather than Regina, capital of the subsector?  Any 
Regina historians out there?]  You can expect a continual stream of 
starships moving to Efate, making it the premiere port coreward of Rhylanor. 

[And you can note two other things about Efate, A) it\'s rabidly pro-noble 
government and B) it\'s utter lawlessness]

  Also, Regina has a remarkably large population of poor, low-TL 
systems (TL 0-8), about 30.95 Billion, mainly on recently-conquered 
Ruie/1809 (9 B), Menorb/1803 (3 B), Roup/2007 (2 B), Enope/2205 (7 B), 
and Algine (9 B).
  [Note: I\'m assuming that \'low-TL\' = \'poor\', an assumption that has some 
backing in Traveller literature.]

  Finally, Regina is the most popoulous subsector in the Spinward 
Marches, even including non-Regency territories. About 1/5th of the 
subsector population lives here, about 35% more than it\'s 
next-populous subsector, Mora. [Even though Glisten subsector has 9 high-pop 
systems, one more than Regina subsector, it\'s total popualtion is still 
substantually less.]

The Heartland: A lot of the wealth and sophistication of the Regency is 
focused in a region of 10 subsectors, just rimward of the Regency 
centre. (Subsectors K,L,O,P of the Marches, Subsectors I,J,M,N of Deneb, 
Subsectors D and H of the Trojan Reach, and Subsector A of Reft.) 

Here is Tobia and Vincennes at TL G, Trin, Glisten, Mora, Dekha and 
Lintle at TL F, Pallique, Lilad and Newmann at TL E, and a host of lesser-tech 
high-pop systems: just under 50% of the Regency high-pop systems and 
57% of the Regency population is over here, including 4 out of 6 "B" pop 
systems, and 6 out of 10 TL F+ high-pop systems.

Outlying Regions: Inar subsector (Deneb F) has a pretty-balanced, average 
high-tech trade triangle between Kubishush/0917 (BAB6AAA-D), Liiri/1016 
(A542998-E), Starn/1417 (B000996-F) and Ashasi (E9D5AA8-D). 
[Ashasi\'s high population is not as important, due to it\'s 
non-dominating TL and it\'s E port.]  A good place for several 
shipping lines to start out from.

Deneb subsector (Deneb K) is the great Regency bulwark to trailing, 
dur strictly and only to Deneb. (1925 B537BDD-D N Hi Cx   110 RE 
A2Ia).  Despite it\'s distance from the Heartland, it\'s still a very 
powerful world, combining a decent tech level, the best port of the 
"B" pop worlds, and a LOT of people.  Moreover, it effortly dominates 
the subsector, giving it even more clout.  It\'s probably the 
single-most-powerful world in the Regency, all things considered. 
Why else would the subsector, sector, domain, and interstellar government be 
named after it? 

You can run the entire coreward half of the Spinward Marches with just 
Efate and Rhylanor.

If I were Regent, I\'d work very hard to try to elevate one of those "B" 
pop systems to Starport A, TL F: it would be either Deneb or Lilad. Lilad 
(Zeng subsector (Deneb-N): 1135 C447BAE-E Hi In    124 RE K6V) has great 
potential, but Deneb has more political clout.  If I\'m thinking 
correctly, you can bet there\'s a lot of maneovering between these two 
systems to see who get\'s the good stuff.  And, of course, only one system 
wins: two much money is earmarked for the Reconstruction to permit both 
to get the goodies, I suspect.

There are a number of religious system governments that are worth 
watching: Deneb and Lintle definitely, as they dominate their regions, 
have ten\'s of billions of people, have good ports and a decent tech level.
[Deneb we already know about. Lintle (0503 A739AE8-F N Hi Cp  504 RE K2V) 
has 50 billion people, or 44% of all people who\'s on a TL F world.  When 
Lintle\'s theocracy speaks, Mora listens.]

It should be noted that if the Regency is run in a strictly democratic 
way, Deneb sector will be making all the decisions: and the six high 
population systems - Borlund/1406, Askigaak/0629, Deneb/1925, 
Beaxon/1439, Lilad/1135, and Pikha/1633 - will be making all the 
decisions for Deneb, as they have 81% of Deneb Sector\'s population, and 
55% of the population of the entire Regency.


************************************

Wealth within the Regency: income per year

I also decided to calcualte the income of the Regency and it\'s high-pop 
systems, using this formula: 

Average income per person per year= 24,000 Cr 
Multiply by .67, to account for the unemployed, children = 16,080 Cr
Modify by the TL *below* that of the world. (To account for tech 
     differences on a world.  The TL in the UWP refers to the highest 
     level on a world: often, most of the population lives at a TL or two 
     lower than the offical version.)

I\'m aware of the fact that this method of calculating wealth leaves 
something to be desired: Steven Bonneville did a better job using the 
World Tamer\'s Handbook.  However, I can\'t handle all those formulas, so I 
used the above formula instead.  The 24,000 Cr figure was selected as a 
"shot in the dark" figure: 250 Cr * 2 = 500 Cr per skill level: 500 Cr * 
4 levels = 2000 Cr per month, 2000 Cr * 12 months = 24,000 Cr.

[I really should have double-checked this... ah well, I like the numbers 
anyway.]

O.K: here we go...               [All numbers in Trillion Credits]

Total:  Regency 17649.5 TCr

A brief aside on wealth: let\'s assume the Earth\'s net income is 16 
trillion dollars per year, and the world wealthiest man earns 2 billion dollars 
per year.  Scaling this up to the Regency, the wealthest man should earn 
2.2 Trillion credits per year.

Again from my almanac, there\'s about 400 billionaires, 50,000 
multimillionaires, and 2,500,000 millionares.  Doing a lazy and quick 
scale-up to the Regency, there should be, say, 400 trillionaires, 50,000 
multibillionaires, and 2,500,000 billionaires. (Big economies can produce 
both more rich people, and greater wealth per individual.)

I just got T:TNE (Deluxe Edition with FF&S), BL and BR sent from my

I like the system, esp. the starship rules. However, I\'m interested 
in getting the full stats of the ships provided in Battle Riders, to 
give me an idea what to take into account if I want to build large 
ships like Battle Riders, Battleships, Tenders etc (I plan to start

Ah yes, the 1921st reason why I don\'t like New Era. Relaying a jump
charge sequence which (a) is a highly complex non-linear function of
continuous variables (origin & destination co-ords, time, etc. etc.)
and (b) needs to control the allocation of charge to >1000 Jump grid
elements to nanosecond accuracy... with a spoken single sentence code
phrase? I think not.

Besides, the way I saw it, Jump entry was akin to conventional
aircraft or spacecraft take-off in that it\'s a continuous
_real-time_ feedback system between the navigational/sensor-ops
computers and the drive control computers ---- the system checks what
it\'s doing and makes continous small corrections as it enters
Jump. New Era drives would have to be strictly "point and shoot",
which is a bit of a scary prospect :-)

This calls to mind the TNE spoof I keep meaning to write, set aboard a
New Era starship where all the fibreoptic conduits have been ripped
out and replaced with speaking tubes: "Wheep! All engines ahead, one
standard gravity, Mr. Scott!". "One grand depravity, d\'ye say, Cap\'n?
Are ye sure? Well aye then..." ;-)

Don\'t you think that Virus is very vulnerable to EMP (ElectroMagnetic 
Pulse)? EMP would fry the Virus like A-bomb blast would fry a human being.

If that is the case, then Vampire ships are very vulnerable to missiles, even
if they don\'t hit. Any quite nearby nuclear detonation of a missile will 
send EMP that fries Vampire ship\'s computer chips (as well as uninfected 
computer chips). 

What do you think?

    'body' => 'Chris, you\'ve stated several times that you "just provide the framework",
leaving others to fill in the details.  (Referring specifically to your paper
on Mertactor.)  Two points spring to mind:


A)  Most of us who have played Traveller for years have had to \'jump through
hoops\' trying to make casual details fit into a coherent picture. 
Zero-population worlds with governments, the non-use of killer asteroids, the
real effectiveness of lasers and missiles in space; just check back issues of
this list for more examples!  In each case people have spent a _lot_ of time
and effort trying to fit something \'canon\' into reality, or fitting two
contradictory \'canon\' facts together.

Having watched Traveller evolve over the years (since the beginning, in
fact), I\'ve concluded that a lot of these problems are caused by writers
failing to consider implications and contradictions.  (Ignoring the physical
law vs. \'canon\' conflicts, of course.)  Of course it\'s more fun to invent
stuff, but keeping track of existing \'facts\' and physical laws is part and
parcel of working in a shared universe.

I think anyone writing in a shared universe has an obligation to avoid
conflicts, both in content and style.  (Note: this doesn\'t apply if you are
writing in your own varient of a shared universe.)  There are enough
contraditions already - we don\'t need more.  (My \'favourite\' is how the
Imperium evolved from the original remote government concerned mainly with
defense that allows wars on its member planets to an intrusive government
that regulates trade and considers murder a crime.  A major reality shift
here!)  


B) My favourite authors all use numbers to back up their prose.  Poul
Anderson\'s planetary descriptions are possibly the most evocative I\'ve read
-- obviously, rigorously calculating orbits, axial inclinations, insolation,
proportions of elements, evolutionary paths, etc. doesn\'t interfere with his
writing.  In fact, Anderson recommends doing the calculations as a good way
of getting a real feel for what you\'re describing.  (As well as being a good
way of getting a truly alien world that seems realistic, not just a mishmash
of exaggerated Earth environments - or worse yet, a planet with only a single
environment.)  John Barnes does the same thing for societies (check out his
essay "How to Build a Future").

  {
    'body' => 'Last post, I stated my position that consistency and number-crunching didn\'t
interfere with creativity, and indeed were essential when writing in a shared
universe.  

As an example of how this works in practice, I\'ll use the Sydkai-class Patrol
Cruiser (MegaTraveller Journal 3).  This article describes a new starship
class including: detailed MT design, background history, operational tactics,
and adventure ideas.  When George and I wrote this we put a lot of work into
getting the details \'right\'.  (Charles and Tom provided the illustration,
physical description, and did a bang-up editing job.)  

The whole article came out of number-crunching.  George and I were mucking
about with Navy patrols and piracy, and discovered that either there were a
_lot_ of Imperial Navy patrol vessels, or that they had to have predictable
patrol routes (because of the need to resupply).  Neither option looked
reasonable to us: a lot of patrol ships meant that smuggling and piracy
couldn\'t occur (and according to canon they happened), while regular patrol
schedules left obvious gaps in coverage (and pirates aren\'t stupid...).   As
there weren\'t any published vessels capable of an extended patrol, we decided
to design one.

Specifications for jump and endurance came from planning patrol routes
through the Spinward Marches, while armour, weapons, and marine contingent
came from published corsair vessels (we wanted enough to defeat them!).  Once
we had the mission defined, designing the ship was a matter of crunching
numbers until we got a good design that stood up to playtesting.  

There\'s a reference in the article to construction of Sydkai-class vessels
being "indefinately suspended as the yards were given over to replacing
[Fifth Frontier War] battle damage."  This came out of a calculation of
shipyard capabilities: there wasn\'t enough spare capability to build new
vessels for a few years after the war (we calculated a reasonable date for
prodution based on replacing major fleet units as a first priority).  A lot
of number-crunching for a minor detail, but it prevented us from creating an
inadvertant contradiction with published material (something that frequently
happens with throwaway references).  

While writing the half-page section on operational tactics, I reread every
article and JTAS news item on the Imperial Navy, to avoid contraditions while
producing a workable system.  A minor reference in an old Journal to an
Imperial battleship "deterring pirates" eventually became the two-tiered
patrol system.  (Which we playtested for viability: lots of small counters
and dice-rolling!)  (By the way, the rules for "gilkhu" were printed in High
Passage 4.)

The last section, a half-page on adventure uses, was added at the insistence
of Joe Fugate.  I didn\'t like it at the time: after all, every referee can
come up with adventure ideas.  However, I soon decided he was right.  What
was the point of producing yet more background material if it didn\'t have a
use in the game?  I\'ve since been told (in the only fan mail I got for this
article) that having this section made the ship a _lot_ more useful than most
other designs.  


This may sound like a lot of work.  It was, but then good writing always is. 
I found it easier than other writing I\'ve done, though.  The simulation
aspects acted as a springboard for my imagination rather than as limitation
to it, while working collaboratively meant I never suffered from writers
block.

That can be fixed. There is radar types that do detect the F117 and the B2. 
And that is microwave radars. The radar-arbsorbing material doesn\'t handle 
those things properly.


>I think we need to state what rules are being used here.  

I don\'t thinks the rules are the problem. I have said (written) it before. 
The sensor rules are OK. If you wan\'t them real realistic I can construct 
some for you, but then you would not play a game with space combat, but a 
game of hide and seak within the frames of electronic warfare (EW). You 
would just have too many things to work with that players would be bored 
before the actual shooting starts.

I find EW interesting, but then I\'m also trained for it from the Norwegian 
Navy, but most players would not like to play a game looking at tables, 
calculating cross section of targets, emission levels, ranges, wavelenghts, 
pulse frequency, jamming, deception jamming, drones, chaff, chaff 
dispersion, chaff movement, flare, local disturbances, relative speed, 
doppler effects and so on. Tell you the truth, I would also get bored with 
this. Those above things are done automatically by the system and a few of 
them just happens. In a game you have to simulate most of it, which means 
pre-calculate a lot of factors.

The sensor rules in TNE are not 100% realistic, but they are simple and easy 
to use, and are far better than what we saw in MT.


>And one KE missile at 10-20 hexes a turn will wreak your whole day

When we are on missiles. A contact missile has to spend an awfully lot of 
reaction mass. And faster it goes, more of its mass must be used for course 
correction if the target tries to dodge. A missile would burn out if it was 
fired at too far a range.

Lets talk about missile guidance. First thing first. I don\'t know what GDW 
means by Semi-independent missile. Either it is or either it ain\'t 
independent. I will classify missiles like this: Beam rider and Fire and Forget.

Beam rider missiles need to be controlled by the firing unit (usually). This 
unit must have some sort of lock-on on the target. Either active or passive. 
If the lock-on is passive the missile must get course corrections from the 
firing unit. As passive detection and lock on never gives a position, only 
direction (and a general at that) exept for passive image tracking like a 
telescope. When you don\'t know the range the impact missile will most likely 
miss. And the time lag in Traveller terms will also make it very difficult 
to get a direct hit with impact missiles.

Advantages of this is that the target unit may not know that a missile is 
approaching. Unless it got a radar on.

If the tracking unit track the target by active means you don\'t need to 
communicate with the missile. The missile follows the returning echo of the 
tracking pulse from the target. Thus the time for control of the missile is 
cut with 1/3rd of the time used above.

Fire and Forget missiles do not need control from the firing unit at all. 
They only need to be told which target they are to track prior to launch. 
They may use either active or passive tracking. Some missiles may have both. 
The active tracking missile will give away its presence when it turns on its 
homing package. Passive missiles follow elecromagnetic emissions from the 
target (IR, radio, radar etc) thus not giving away its presence. 

Both types of missiles (beam rider and fire and forget) may be fooled by 
countermeasures.

Now I will tie this in with missile reaction mass. As starships missiles 
would coats most of the time towards its target. As a missile got limited g 
turns of reaction mass it should be launched in the same vector as the 
firing unit is travelling. The missile should hold a coasting speed that are 
well above the targets so it just can\'t speed away. It should only fire its 
engine to correct the course when it is on the final approach. If the 
missile are remote controlled time lag has to be taken account for. It may 
be a lag up to 5 seconds. If the target tries to dodge on the final 
approach, there will be a lot of fuel usage. A missile with a vector of 20 
will need 10g turns to change 30 degrees. And if you are trying to steer a 
missile against a target to a point which it will be in 5 seconds you will 
miss, the time taken for the course correction to be in effect is more than 
5 seconds. The missile would burn out. A FF missile would have far better 
chance, but would be shot down most likely, and/or fooled by ECM.

Repulsors are not available to RCES, but a TL 16 repulsor sends out 600 
tonnes of thrust per 4MW power. How much would a pellet mass at a speed of 
20 hexes? Lets say it weight 500grams to start with. And what penetration 
power would it have? Anyone?

Glisten, like Aramis subsector, was originally bypassed.  In the case of
Glisten, there\'s an abyss in the four-corners region of Lunion-Glisten-
Mora-Trin\'s Veil that makes crossing by jump-3 ships difficult, and in
that era jump-3 was the best the Imperium had.  You have to turn off
through Trin\'s Veil, or in Lunion for Marastan.  

Also, there were two primary trade lines that most traffic followed.
There was the trade with the Zhodani, which ran up to the rapidly
growing Imperial pocket around the base at Regina, only six worlds
in the 250s, but tripling in size to eighteen by 300.  The other line
followed the Spinward Main into the Sword Worlds and the Darrian
Confederation.  It turns out that a spur of the Main branches off
at Wardn and curves through Mertactor to eventually reach Glisten.

Glisten probably wasn\'t very well surveyed, since it was off the
beaten track, but once the colonists got there in the late 200s,
they realized it had the potential to be an industrial gold mine.
And silver, iron, tungsten, lanthanum, copper....  So it becomes
a destination in its\' own right, and there\'s suddenly a reason to
send more ships along the shorter route through Trin\'s Veil and
through Marastan, and drives colonization in that direction.  It
may be coincidence, but shortly after Glisten is colonized, the
settlement of the Marches *really* takes off.

But what about Mertactor?  It\'s closer to Wardn on the Main, so
it likely was settled by about 300, as the map shows.  The case
for it being an old world is strengthened by the fact that it
is developed enough to be admitted into the Imperium during the
First Frontier War (Spinward Marches Campaign maps).  (Glisten,
on the other hand, almost immediately was in a pocket of Imperial
worlds and then was absorbed by the wave coming through Deneb
into Trin\'s Veil.  Important world.)  The case for it being 
later is that some of the worlds on the Main coming from Wardn
aren\'t strongly exploited, even by the 1100s.  For instance,
the "Metal Worlds" the Sword Worlders hold in reserve.

Now that I\'ve said all that, I\'ll say this.  Why worry about it?
305 is close enough.  You might even be vague about it; "in the
early 300s" or something like that is all that you need to say.
That way, you can say when colonization happened, and still let
people make up their own minds how it worked.  Slight vagueness
keeps the paper more flexible, and useful to more people.

I wrote the following article to allow TNE referees to use Traveller aliens 
as player characters with the character generation rules given in the TNE 
rulebook. The article assumes that you have access to other material on the 
aliens you choose to use.

This is not as detailed as Andy Lilly\'s Aslan article (which I understand 
has also been posted here), nor is it intended to be. It is meant to be a 
quick \'fix\' to get people playing aliens.

Wearing The Furry Suit
Alien Player Characters in Traveller: The New Era

So far in Traveller: The New Era we have been given the chance to play 
humans from a wide variety of backgrounds - or one solitary alien race (the 
Schalli) - in the aftermath of the Virus. But that catastrophe affected all 
the sentients in the Traveller universe, not just humans (and, in any case, 
there was more than one branch of Humaniti present in the old Imperium). 
What of the irrepressible Vargr? The Aslan Ihatei endlessly reaching for the 
stars? The enigmatic Hivers? In fact, all the Traveller aliens?
The answer, of course, was that there was just not enough space in the TNE 
rulebook to give aliens more than a passing mention as NPCs (and, even then, 
not all the aliens made it into the rulebook). GDW\'s plans for TNE include a 
series of books called \'Aliens of the Rim\', which will cover most of the 
alien races found in Traveller - starting with the Hivers and their Ithklur 
mercenaries. As I write, that first book hasn\'t appeared yet (although it 
might have done by the time you read this).
In the continued absence of that series, this article expands on and 
complements the descriptions given in the Traveller: The New Era rulebook 
and allows you to create playable alien player characters.
The history briefly presented for some alien races is drawn from my own 
campaign, and may not completely mesh with future TNE releases. Use it as 
you see fit (after all, the object is to have fun).
You may want to use the rules presented in Fusion, Fire & Steel to design 
alien equipment.
Author\'s Note: Although the stats and attributes presented here are 
extrapolated from the original Traveller and MegaTraveller material, I have 
used the careers presented in the rulebook so that, armed with just the 
rulebook and this article, you can have playable alien characters.

Hivers
Without a doubt Hivers are the most \'alien\' of all the Traveller aliens. 
Physically, they have a central body from which extends six limbs, each 
ending in six small appendages. One of the limbs contains the Hiver\'s eye 
stalks, and another contains the Hiver\'s reproductive organs (Hivers 
reproduce by exchanging genetic material in a process which humans have 
described as "...shaking hands..." - small wonder then that human 
dignitaries have been wary the first time they meet Hivers!). The remaining 
four limbs function as legs or arms, as the situation requires.
Hivers are justifiably famous for their curiosity. In fact Hivers are like 
small human children: they crave knowledge of any kind, and will often go to 
quite extraordinary lengths to indulge their curiosity - even to tricking 
other races into performing unnecessary adventures just to see what happens!
Hivers are also pacifists, but they do understand that it is an imperfect 
universe and not everyone else is. Although some very exceptional Hivers 
have been known to use violence to defend themselves (and is becoming more 
common in the aftermath of Virus), most Hivers depend entirely on the 
services of their subject races - primarily the Ithklur \'mercenaries\'.
Probably the main reason that Hivers are so enigmatic to other races is that 
they cannot speak - Hivers communicate between themselves by a form of \'sign 
language\', and to other races through \'translators\'. Hiver translators 
convert speech into ideograms which mimic Hiver sign language, and convert 
the Hiver\'s responses into digitised speech. The Hivers have tried (so far 
unsuccessfully) to make their translators mimic moods and personality, but, 
because of first impressions gained from their translators, Hivers still 
seem enigmatic and aloof to other races.
Hivers use the rules given in the rulebook, except: the weight formula is 
[4x(STR-AGL)]+150 for all Hivers. Hivers have no psionic ability at all, so 
PSI is zero.
Hivers can have a wide variety of careers, but most Hivers encountered 
outside Hiver space will be one of the following: Civil Engineer, Computer 
Operator, Diplomat, Mechanic, Medicine, Professor, Scientist or Trader.
Generate the Hiver\'s Ithklur companion(s) as NPCs as described in the 
rulebook (page 69).

Vargr
Vargr are, without any doubt, the most widely scattered race in the New Era 
apart from humans. You can encounter Vargr in large numbers almost anywhere 
in the coreward end of the old Imperium, as well as the Regency and the 
Vargr states. As if that wasn\'t enough, individual Vargr can be found almost 
anywhere in the old Imperium, although very seldom any any other races\' 
territory (except the Zhodani Consulate, which has a large native Vargr 
population).
Vargr were originally genetically engineered by the ancients from Terran 
Canines and they still have many similarities with dogs: they don\'t sweat - 
all heat loss is through the mouth; they prefer to eat small amounts often 
and then snooze while the food is digested; they can only see in black and 
white, so Vargr tend to favour very \'loud\' colours (in fact it has often 
been said that a Vargr\'s taste is entirely in his mouth!). In all, Vargr are 
brash and loud and they favour direct action over talk (this does not mean 
that they will avoid planning things though - Vargr aren\'t stupid).
Finally, let\'s lay one common myth to a long-overdue rest. After three 
hundred thousand years of evolution Vargr no longer stick their heads out of 
the window when they\'re driving (and if you\'ve seen a Vargr drive an air 
raft you\'ll know why)!
Attributes: STR -1, AGL +1, CON -1. All other attributes are generated 
normally, except social standing. Charisma replaces social standing, and 
starting charisma is generated using 1D6+1. Vargr mass slightly more than 
Humans on average. The formulae are: Male [4x(STR-AGL)]+90; Female 
[4x(STR-AGL)]+70.
All careers and skills are open to Vargr (subject to the homeworld 
restrictions described in the rulebook).

Aslan
Aslan fared better than most against Virus, although they did not escape 
unscathed. The Virus crossed the border from Imperial space into Solomani 
space as if it wasn\'t there - their computer systems were so alike in many 
ways. But the Aslan Hierate was split up into thousands of clans, each with 
their own computer systems, codes and procedures - and each with their own 
enclaves on Kusyu, the Aslan homeworld. The virus crossed the last eight 
parsecs to the Aslan/Solomani border in three months. It took four months to 
cross the one parsec to Kusyu, where it almost dead-ended.
Now, almost seventy years later, Virus still ravages Kusyu and the 
subsectors immediately around it, but the rest of the Hierate remains 
relatively Virus-free. All Aslan know that the sacrifice of their homeworld 
bought them enough time to save the rest of the Hierate by instituting 
anti-Virus measures. Those measures, coupled with the enormous diversity in 
computer systems, managed to stop the spread of the Virus almost dead. But 
at a terrible, terrible price.
Treatment of captured Virus strains vary from clan to clan: some isolate and 
study it; most destroy it along with the infected system; and some, mostly 
in Reaver\'s Deep and Daibei, have \'befriended\' certain strains and are 
working with them to build new civilisations in that border area.
Aslan treatment of Imperial remnants is another matter, however. Most Aslan 
view the Virus as a made thing - a weapon made by Imperials and released 
without thought. The fact that Virus was not designed to be used against the 
Aslan doesn\'t matter - they regard all remnant Imperials as culpable.
Because Aslan honour views attacks on an unsuspecting enemy as cowardly, 
most Imperial remnants found by Aslan are revived before being spaced or 
hung. Some clans view the Imperials as being without any honour, however, 
and some remnants are blown up with their ships, never having been revived.
In Aslan society, the first son is groomed to take over from his Father as 
head of the clan. All the other sons (called Ihatei - literally \'second 
son\') are expected to leave home and make a new home and clan of their own. 
This has been the basis of Aslan expansion for hundreds of years and has 
barely changed in all that time.
In the past, the majority of the Ihatei struck out Coreward and Trailing 
(towards the Imperium) - indeed, the Emperor Strephon had an honour guard of 
Aslan. Now, although there is some expansion into Daibei and towards the 
Regency, almost all Ihatei have turned their faces Spinward and Rimward, 
expanding away from the Virus.
Attributes: STR +2, AGL -1, CON +1. All other attributes are generated 
normally. Aslan are physically much larger than Humans. The formulae are: 
Male [4x(STR-AGL)]+110; Female [4x(STR-AGL)]+85. Determine everything else 
normally as described in the rulebook, but add +1 to initiative.
All characters use careers from the rulebook.
Most Aslan females encountered outside the Hierate will follow one of the 
following careers: Belter, Bureaucrat, Civil Engineer, Diplomat, Mechanic, 
Scout or Trader.
Aslan males will be one of: Barbarian, Bounty Hunter, Hunter, Civil Pilot, 
Mercenary, Scout or Wealthy Traveller.
Military careers are open to both males and females.
In Aslan society, there is a very strict demarcation of skills, with some 
skills being prohibited to one gender or another. Only Aslan females may 
have skills from the following skill clusters:
Technician, Vice, Space Vessel, Space Tech, Medical, Interaction, Engineer, 
Economics, Charm, Aircraft.
No skill clusters are specifically Aslan male only, the following skill 
clusters are most likely in all Aslan males: Determination, Explore, Melee, 
Perception.
The remaining skill clusters can be used by either males or females.

Droyne and Chirpers
Droyne and Chirpers were once found on worlds widely scattered across the 
old Imperium. Sadly, of all the \'major\' races they fared the worst during 
the rebellion and afterwards, being subjected to widespread racism on a 
massive scale. Where they were unable to get right away from human 
settlements, they suffered pogroms, slavery and genocide.
Although their own technology was barely affected by Virus, they were too 
scattered and mistrusted to be allowed to offer assistance in all but a very 
small number of cases.
What Imperial and other xenobiologists failed to realise was that Chirpers 
and Droyne are the same race. Chirpers are merely immature Droyne who have 
not been \'caste\'. However, with the genocide visited upon the Droyne and the 
widespread destruction of anything resembling Droyne artifacts or culture, 
the caste system has all but vanished in many areas. As a consequence, 
\'true\' Droyne communities are very rare - most communities that managed to 
survived to the present day are made up entirely of Chirpers.
Droyne society comprises six castes: Workers, Warriors, Technicians, Drones, 
Leaders and Sports. There are three Droyne genders, designated (by Imperial 
Xenobiologists - nobody thought to actually ask the Droyne) Alpha Male, Beta 
Male and Female. Leaders, Sports and Warriors are Alpha Males; Workers and 
Technicians are Beta Males; Drones are Females.
Chirpers appear to be all one gender, but gender differences must eventually 
surface, because Chirpers are able to reproduce.
All Chirpers and Droyne roll 1D6+1 for STR and CON, and 1D6+2 for AGL. 
Social standing is only applicable in Chirper or Droyne communities, and is 
treated as zero for dealings with non-Droyne who are not familiar with 
Droyne or Chirpers. The weight formula for Droyne and Chirpers is 
[4x(STR-AGL)]+20.
Careers details are only given for Leaders, Warriors and Sports. If your 
players want to play Technicians, Drones or Workers (both roles which are 
heavily involved in Droyne society, but rarely come into contact with 
outsiders) make no stat modifications and choose the closest career from the 
rulebook.
Careers are directly related to caste (ignore stat minimum requirements 
given in the rulebook):
Leaders add +2 to INT and +1 to initiative. Leaders take any career which 
enables them to lead, whether in a military or a civilian role.
Warriors add +2 to STR, +1 to AGL and +1 to initiative. Warriors are trained 
purely for combat purposes (suitable careers include Bounty Hunter, 
Mercenary and Tough).
Sports add +1 to AGL and +1 to EDU. Sports are the adventurers and explorers 
of Droyne society and the most likely caste to be found away from other 
Droyne (suitable careers include Diplomat, Scout and Tough).
Chirpers have no stat modifications and use the Barbarian career from the 
rulebook.

The branches of Humaniti
No-one really knows how many worlds the Ancients seeded with Humans, the old 
Imperium catalogued 50 confirmed seeded worlds and over 300 more which 
required further investigation. The old Imperium was primarily made up of 
two \'branches\' of Humaniti - Vilani and Solomani - and most Imperials were a 
mix of the two (although many claimed to be solely one or the other for 
political reasons). The other \'main\' branches of Humaniti are the Zhodani 
and the Darrians.

Solomani
Solomani live rimward of the old Imperium. During the rebellion, the 
Solomani Confederation took the chance to regain some of the \'disputed\' 
territory (disputed, at least, by the Solomani) from the Imperium, including 
Terra, before Virus overwhelmed them.
Solomani believe themselves to be the only \'racially pure\' branch of 
Humaniti. To create a Solomani, use the character generation rules presented 
in the rulebook without modifications.

Zhodani
Zhodani live spinward and coreward of the Regency. Because of the draconian 
anti-virus policies adopted by the Regency and the Zhodani Consulate, the 
Virus failed to get a hold within the Consulate (although many Zhodani 
\'protectorates\' outside the Consulate borders suffered as badly as 
everywhere else).
Zhodani society is split into three classes: Nobles (social standing 10+), 
Intendants (social standing 9) and Proles (social standing 8-). All Nobles 
are psionic (and all psionics are Noble - social advancement is purely a 
matter of ability) and Proles are not.
To create a Zhodani, use the character generation rules presented in the 
rulebook without modifications. If a character has psionic ability, advance 
their social standing to 10 and treat them as psionics trained.

Vilani
Vilani consider themselves the only \'racially pure\' Imperials and their part 
of space, centred on Vland, the \'Fourth Imperium\' (sic). Unlike the 
Solomani, the Vilani withdrew into their own little enclave and prepared for 
the worst - it didn\'t save them. War-weary, ravaged by Virus and overrun by 
Vargr they barely survived at all.
Vilani society is built on three principles: tradition, efficiency and 
community spirit. It was the Vilani who \'built\' and ran the great 
megacorporations of the old Imperium, and it\'s not hard to see why. Most 
Vilani are patient and methodical, which comes back to the three prinicples. 
But Vilani can afford to be patient because Vilani, particularly pure-bred 
Vilani, age more slowly than other humans.
To create a Vilani, use the character generation rules presented in the 
rulebook without modifications, except: for bloodline roll 1D20 and apply 
the following results.
If the result is 1 to 15, the character is of mainly non-Vilani ancestry and 
applies aging effects normally (as described in the rulebook).
If the result is 16 to 18, the character has some Vilani blood and applies 
+2 to all their aging rolls.
If the result is 19, the character is almost pure Vilani and applies +3 to 
all their aging rolls.
If the result is 20, the character is a pure-bred Vilani from one of the old 
Vilani families. These characters apply +4 to their aging rolls.

Darrians
Darrians live in a small group of worlds immediately spinward of the 
Regency. Without a doubt, their survival into the new era was entirely due 
to Norris\' policies against the Virus. Such is the cosmopolitan nature of 
Darrian society that, within Darrian borders, you can find \'pure\' Darrians, 
Aslan (mostly citizens of the Confederation, although a small number of 
Ihatei have been allowed to settle on Darrian worlds), Zhodani and 
\'Imperials\'.
Darrian Aslan are sympathetic to, but do not subscribe to, the feelings that 
Hierate Aslan have about Imperial remnants.
Darrian Aslan are created using the Aslan character generation guidelines. 
Darrians are created as follows:
Attributes: Darrians use the rules given in the rulebook, except: STR is 
generated using 1D6+1, CON is 1D6+1 and EDU is +2. Darrians speak Darrian 
and Anglic, Darrian Aslan also speak the Aslan language. Darrians use the 
social standing rules as presented in the rulebooks, because there is no 
stigma attached to nobility as there is within the old Imperium, use the 
titles and landhold rules unmodified.
Darrians mass slightly less than other Humans on average. The formulae are: 
Male [4x(STR-AGL)]+86; Female [4x(STR-AGL)]+70. Darrian Aslan use the rules 
presented under Aslan, above.
All careers and skills are open to Darrians, except where homeworld/region 
does not permit Darrian characters. Darrian Aslan use the career 
restrictions detailed for Aslan.

Finally, use aliens sparingly in your Traveller games. If each player plays 
a different alien, they become just another character \'class\'. Aliens should 
present some mystery in your games - their motives and ways of thinking are 
not the same as humans and they should not be played as just humans in furry 
suits. Not only that, each alien (PC or NPC) is an individual, and will 
behave differently to other members of their own race. Use the information 
in the rulebook (particularly the NPC motivation information), and the 
information from this article, to guide you when you first play an alien and 
always think about what it means to be a member of one of these races.
If necessary, referees should present aliens as NPCs until their players 
know enough about them to portray them properly. From the haughty Aslan and 
the chaotic, impulsive Vargr to the mysterious Hivers, make each one 
different and your Traveller games will come alive.

Enjoy,

Svenson,
I\'d be interested in seeing some background material on your forthcoming

the design of ships like the Vilborg Skimmer?  At the very least, it sounds  
like you\'ve got a mission plan for the Tempere modular transport. I\'d like to  
see some of your ideas.

The rules *don\'t* work!  Why even *have* passive sensors in TNE?  They
are never better than actives, and there is no real penalty for using
your AEMS.

Actually, FFS/BL has rules for many of the things you mentioned.
Jamming, chaff, flares, decoys.  They attempt to have actives penalized,
but it is too weak a rule.  If they rules are written well, it won\'t be
any harder than BL as it stands.  I just record the basic modifiers a
ship has on the control shett.

I noticed that you use BL movement rules----no wonder!  Sorry, it\'s been
so long since I bothered using the movement crap from BL that I forgot
it existed.  I use (and most people I\'ve talke to who play)
Mayday-like movement (Battle Rider uses the same) for everything.  If a
missile has 12gturns, it has a leathal area around its future position
with a radius of 12 hexes.  Both systems work, but BL requires dumb
quantized changes in course (whick can get really nasty).

PEMS *is* a telescope (broad band detector covers damn near all
wavelengths).  It will make hitting with a passive lock harder, though.
Hmmm.  If the target is a 2g scout, and the missile is 12gs, it really
won\'t matter though.

So in the Imperium they basically don\'t exist (CT/TNE, anyway). 


I was working on FIM rules, they trick is writing playable rules to
force them to reacta certain way.  I use the homing methods you mention.
I would agree that SIM is a pointless term.  That of FIM is :)  I assume
in my rules that FIM are programmed right before launch, and that if
they have commo, even after.  Kinda like torpedos on the wire for the
first few hundred meters.  Programs might be "coast until AEMS target
aquisition, then intercept"  something like that.  Also I thought it
might be useful to give missiles a program like: "use no more than 2
gturns per turn if you cannot intercept *that* turn".. That way you
don\'t get a missile using its full 12gturns when it it too far to hit.

Sorry, but the Vargr generally weights less than a human. Use 60 as a base

HDSR uses standard ETC HMG ammunition. It is still under field tests.
Because HDSR has barrell lenght less than average (to reduce lenght and weight)
HE and HEAP are obsolete when compared to DS ammo. Of course this barrel type
is only 6 cm shorter than average so it is arguable if designers should
change barrel lenght.
Weapon is designed to be manufactured in TL-9 using TL-10 receivers and TL-12
magazine batteries.
It is also possible to remove bipod from weapon. As you can see the weight of
the weapon drops to 33 Kg, that is quite manageable. It doesn\'t affect recoil.
Althought this weapon is designed to be a long range sniping weapon it is also
good to have some close range support ammo and that is flechette ammo.

81mm Light Infantry Mortar is commonly found in the wilds. It is relatively
light weight but effective against lightly or unarmored targets. It is also
used to provide lightning during night time attacks and also for smoke screens.
It is ideal for low-budget guerrila warfare. Just think about all those TEDs
and other roosters who used to rule over planets that RC has just conquered.

Notes

The Tempere is designed as a modular transport. It normally carries a Viiborg
fuel skimmer, a drop tank, a Helkana class shuttle and modules totalling 300
tons displacement, in this configuration she can do two Jumps without
refueling. The Viiborg has a 1400 kl fuel tank fitted to be used as a fuel tank
for the Tempere in addition to her own fuel supply, this supplies the Tempere
with the ability to do a single jump when fully loaded. She has been known to
travel with as many as four drop tanks (without the Viiborg and Helkana on
board) allowing four jumps. Where fuel is available in the destination system
she will travel with only one drop tank and 600 tons of modules (allowing for a
single jump).

Modules come in a variety of sizes up to 100 tons displacement. The most common
are the 35 ton modules that can be carried to by Helkana. Modules can have a
variety of purposes also, ranging from general cargo, quarters, a reactor,
weapon systems, labs, small craft, etc. Since the Tempere can not enter a
planets atmosphere, modules are lifted to orbit by specially designed Lifters
such as the Tsuga Heavy Lifter (thank you Joe Heck for getting me started
thinking about TL 9 worlds).

The 50 MW fision reactor provides a surplus of 43.234 MW to power modules and
weapons turrets. The modules usually draw on the power supply of the Tempere,
however, some have their own power supply and one module has a 200 MW fusion
reactor which can feed surplus power to the ship.

Gravity is provided by spinning the entire ship. The spin is usually stopped
while approaching a world to make docking and cargo handling easier. A flight
crew of five is carried to man the Viiborg fuel skimmer and/or Helkana shuttle.
If additional personnel are needed they can be carried in quarters modules.

The Viiborg is built on Mnemosyne (0232 Foreven sector) in the wilds. While
several relic ships exist at Mnemosyne, the Tempere is the backbone of
Mnemosyne commerce and exploration.

I would suspect that just this problem would have made for some interesting 
compromises when the Regency was formally created.  Setting up an interstellar 
political entity with one region dominating the other regions was hard enough 
for 
the Third Imperium.  I suspect it would simply be an invitation for rebellion 
and 
civil war in an area as small as the Regency.  Many people do not mind being 
ruled by somebody, but they tend to get irate when that ruler is their neighbor.
I would imagine that the solution to that would be to create a multi-part 
legislature, 
to prevent population-based political domination.  

A bicameral legislature, with one house based on population and one house based 
on one representative per world (excepting only those worlds that are 
corporate-owned 
or owned by other worlds).  This would prevent domination from one portion of 
the 
Regency, and would address the desires of the radical democrats (small d 
democrats 
who seek representative government, not large D Democrats who run for office in 
the US).  
I think this would cause a lot of resistance from the nobility, who are likely 
to be the controlling 
element in terms of Regency economics.  They would be the old money that 
controls the 
megacorporations, which would be a large part of the Regency tax base.

A tricameral legislature, with one house based on population,one house based on 
one 
representative per world, and the third house based on nobility.  As above, it 
would prevent 
single-subsector domination and please the radical democrats.   It would also 
allow the old 
power structure (the nobility) to retain some power in the new regeime.  A 
tricameral system 
is somewhat bulky and unweildy, but would seem to be the system most likely to 
get buy-in 
from the old power brokers and the new political powers.  This was the route I 
took in my own 
campaign.

Of course, the official GDW answer will be out soon enough.  Based on the few 
tidbits in the 
TNE rulebook, I suspect they will take a route closer to the bicameral idea, 
but I\'ve been 
wrong before.  Unless they come up with something really neat, I\'ll probably 
stick with my 
current  tricameral government.  I\'m still anxious to see the Regency 
Sourcebook, though.


Glad you\'re back, Alvin!

    'body' => 'Christopher_Griffen@dmcwave.com (Christopher Griffen) came up with some
ideas for recruiting rules, and invited comments/criticism....

 >   Successful recruiting depends on a number of facets.  Among them are:
     
 >    --Recruiting Skill
 >   RECRUITING SKILL    +Recruiting Skill (as per normal at Difficult 
 >    level)
 
No argument there...

 >    --Population
>     POPULATION          -1 if Low Pop     0 if Med Pop     +1 if High Pop 

I think you badly underestimate the impact of population.  Remember, the
pop. number and accompanying fuzzy descriptors is a LOG scale!  The
more people to choose from, the more people that (a) have the skills you
are interested in, and (b) are interested in working for you.  Conversely,
on a Low Pop world, *if* there is someone with the skills you want, he/she/it
is probably "already engaged".  
Recommendation: Population CHANGES THE DIFFICULTY LEVEL.
+1 diff if Low, -1 or more diffs if High Pop.

 >    --Sampling Rate
>     SAMPLING RATE (EFFECTS NOT CUMULATIVE)
>     -2 if same system sampled within 30 days -1 if same system sampled 
>    within 60 days
>     0 if system not sampled within 60 days or more

This should only be detrimental if you have only a small pool of potential
applicants to draw from, i.e. the skills required are very specialized or 
you are recruiting from a Low Pop world.  If you have a larger group of
potential applicants to recruit from, previous recruiting has the effect of
"waking up" those who weren\'t bothering to look before, because they 
now realize that someone is hiring in their line of work... thus drawing more
potential applicants into the pool.  
Recommendation : Only apply sampling mod to Low/Med Pop
worlds, or very hard-to-fill positions.

 >    --Military Proximity
>     MILITARY PROXIMITY  +1 if naval base present and hiring ship\'s crew or
>     mercenaries
>     0 if no military base present
>     +1 if Government 7 or Law Level 0-3 (and hiring mercenaries)

Not much argument.

 >    --Starport Level
     STARPORT LEVEL      +1 if Starport A (+2 if recruiting trader crew)
     0 if Starport B-D (+1 if recruiting trader crew)
     -1 if Starport E-X (0 if recruiting trader crew)
   
I would make the task one diff level harder for starports D-X.

Other factors you should consider:

- State of Local Economy  : High Unemployment means people will leap at the 
chance for work; Low unemployment + high standard of living means people 
will laugh all the way to the bank at your recruiter.  Ref\'s option; could
change
things a diff. level either way.

- Rarity of skills required : if all you require is that recruits be
breathing, it\'s easy
to find recruits.  OTOH, if you require that all recruits meet strict
physical fitness
requirements and have skill level 4+ in multiple skills, it could be very
hard to find
what you want.

- Pay scale : if you\'re too cheap, you\'ll have a hard time getting anyone
competent.
If you offer higher than normal wages, they\'ll beat your door down.

>     his skill level).  If he achieves exceptional success, he is able to 
>     muster a number of potential recruits equal to twice his Recruiting

Please sanity-check this.  If your skill 4 recruiter posts an offer on the
planetary
JobNet of, say, Louzy for a double-normal-pay job, open to anyone with any
military experience, while Louzy is still in its decades-long Depression, I
think 
he\'ll get more than a max of 8 applicants in 3 days.

OTOH, if Esteban and friends try to recruit on a pop 4 world, they should be
deliriously happy if they get as many as 9 applicants....

Why not? Glisten was a much harder system to colonize, for one thing (For
all that tells us Mertactor could have been colonized by the year 100). For 
another, the position of Mertactor nine jumps away indicates that whoever
was in charge of the settlement and whatever motives they had, getting far
away from Mora was a priority. Mertactor is, as pointed out previously,
nine jumps away from Mora. That cuts down on the use "they" can get out
of the ships (whoever "they" may be).

Well, you\'ve convinced me that some explanation is possible. I\'d still
like to see the explanation, though. And I still think you ought to
respect the information on those settlement maps.

First, some well-earned applause to GDW for Vampire Fleets.  Ho-hum 
cover, blah art, Yummy information, SOLID adventures! (even if I\'m a 
Regency man, myself.)

Second, the Zho/Regency interaction.  How have the Zho\'s reacted to the 
new Regency use of psions?  Have any worlds taken adventage of Zho advise 
to build their own, planet-wide Thought Police? (VERY useful in 
dictatorships and theocracies!)  

I think it would be interesting if the Regency have asked for advise from 
the Zho thought police on how to best tame the Wilds, and the best use of 
psions in that task. After all, many of the problems of the Wilds stem 
from having the wrong mental attitude...

Third, Zho reaction to new Regency technology.  The Regency, like the 
Imperium before it, has always maintained a definite technological edge 
over the Zho\'s.  Now that they can freely apply technology to psionics, 
they should have by now created/are creating a new host of psi drougs and 
boosters, which can certainly produce a threat to the Zhodani nobility.  
They may maintain their trade restrictions vis-a vis the Regency long 
after the threat of Virus receed, persicely for this reason.

The Zho\'s are also watchful of Regency psions: depending on how they 
develop, they can provide a welcome mat for eventual incorporation of the 
Regency into the Consulate, or become a seroius security threat to the 
Zhodani.  Knowing how those crazy, anti-authoritartian Solomani\'s are, 
the answer is probably the latter.  Will the psions discover methods that 
the Zho\'s overlooked?  Will they develop the Zho\'s greatest nightmare: 
Psions who can lie undetectably?  Will Regency technology create psionic 
machines?  Will psionics become available to anyone, or be selectable in 
vitro?

And just how adaptable are the Zhos to any unexpected challange, anyway?  

Points against: as a culture, they\'re older than Ancient Egypt.  This 
                implies SEROIUS cultural rigidity.

                they have been dependent on Psionic Rule since -7000 
                Imperial.

                they have no knowledge of artifically-produced psionics 
                (though they know it can be done, thanks to certain Ancient 
                artifacts.

Point for:      they have managed to avoid total dependence on psionics

                some Zhodani nobles are non-psionic (I think: can the 
                local Zho expert verify this?)

Personal guess: remember what happened when the Europeans contacted the 
Indians?  Or when the Solomani hit the Vilani?  I think that we are going 
to see a repeat of this in a century or two...

The War Machine by David Drake and                      
Roger MacBride Allen.

Despite the title, they do have a few nifty 
tidbits for reaction-mass, jump-drive SF 
universes like ours.                           [The Story is good, too]
 
For example, the "four-to-one".  Basically, \'any false move in powered 
flight costs you four times as much fuel as the original burn.  You spend 
the original burn, then a burn to break your speed, then a burn to get 
you moving back toward where you started out, and then a fourth burn to 
break your speed after the return burn.  You end up where you started, 
moving at zero speed, after four power burns.\'         - p. 277

I bet every Imperial Navy midshipman knows this.

The Crown cleaned it\'s prisons and rotting prison hulks of it\'s criminals,
rebels and other undesirables (like poor people) and shipped them literally
to the other end of the earth, for a limited term or for \'the term of their

This would give the Mertactans a pretty good reason to hate Mora\'s guts.
Perhaps this happened a few centuries after the initial colonisation of the
planet - that way you could reconcile the colonisation date with the paper\'s
data.

As a footnote, the English were still using convicts for forced labour as
late as 1890 (approximately), in the Swan River Colony (now Western Australia).

  According to a _really_ old source (Trillion Credit Squadron), a world
with a class A or B port can handle roughly one-thousandth of its
population in ship tonnage in its drydocks. This maximum applies to the total
of all ships being built, all ships being repaired, and all ships in for
yearly maintenance, added together. The actual number varies depending on
government type and whether or not the world is on a war footing economically.

  The caveat is that only class A ports can build starships. Class B
ports are limited to in-system craft. What causes this difference is a
matter of opinion. The lack of jump-producing facilities can be due to
resources (no lanthanum nearby), lack of industrial capability (nobody\'s
bothered to build it yet), lack of technical know-how (more feasible
outside the Imperium than in), lack of raw TL, or lack of licensing (more
likely within large states: no personnel licensed to build or install
jump drives -> no class A rating despite having all the other prerequisites).

  For individual ships at class B ports there are a couple of ways around
this limit. The starport class is really on a very coarse scale, and it
could be decided that Mnemosyne, despite the size and extent of its
shipyards, is only capable of building one or two jump drives at a time,
and perhaps only of a limited size. Thus, as far as the casual traveller
is concerned, Mnemosyne is a class B port because you can\'t order starships
from their shipyard unless you are their planetary government.
  You could also decide that Mnemosyne builds the hulls and everything
else _except_ the jump drive, which they contract out to another nearby
world with a class A port. Realistically this drives up the price of the
jump drive and of the ship.

  Another point. Why has Mnemosyne been Collapsed? It is well behind the
Quarantine line and unlikely to have been hit by Virus. It is also part
of an organized state that could protect its own borders.

Notes:

The Helkana is designed to be carried aboard the Tempere Modular Transport. It
is also used at space ports on planets that have the recources and ability to
make HCD fuel. The crew live on the mothership or at the space port. The 35 ton
modules on the Helkana are the same as those carried by the Tempere.

The Helkana has 4.457 MW of surplus power to operate a turret weapon.

The Viiborg is built on Mnemosyne (0232 Foreven sector) in the Wilds.

I think you\'re mis-reading the "lie undetectably" part.

Not "lurk" or "hide", more like "lie undetectably" as in:

Don\'t forget, the Imperium had a systematic supression of ANYTHING to
do with psionics since the 700\'s. Chances are that Zho psi drug technology
is several TLs above anything in Imperial space at its peak, much less
in the New Era(tm). Also, the remnants of Imperial pharmacaetical (sp?)
corps would have been avoiding psi-drug research for centuries, or at 
least have been doing it under the table, so would have very little base
to start working from once attitudes towards psionics change.

I doubt that the Regency is very close to doing anything on the psi-technology
frontier, unless they bring in the basics from the Zhos first. Also,
the overall amount of psi-related activity in the Regency is nothing 
compared to its everyday use in the Consulate, so even from the same
starting point, I think the Zhos would outpace any Imperial remnant state
in terms of psi-related development.

But it\'s a culture that has lasted that long in the face of many changes.
That imples a fair amount of cultural flexibility.

Totally. More that just political rule, it has been the key to social stability
for most of that time.

No, but they\'ve probably been trying for quite a while. The overall max
tl in the Consulate of 14 isn\'t _that_ far behind the (ex-)Imperium. Also,
the Zhos have a fairly strong interest in Ancient artifacts, especially
psionically active ones. The Zho intelligence network has probably seen
if not stolen every psi-active artifact dug up in Imperial space over 
the last several centuries. Chances are the Imperials wouldn\'t
have even recognized a psi-active artifact if Grandfather came over and 
told the Emperor himself what was going on.

Well, I dunno if I\'m an expert, but I read the Aliens module a few times.
Yes, some nobles born into nobility are non-psionic and were the major 
drive to develop non-psionic methods for doing things. I\'d imagine that
at some point in Zhodani history, there were a lot of growing pains
and questions about why certain things were being developed. For instance,
did the Zhos ever have a planet-wide telephone network? Proles don\'t
need to use the phone, most nobles have telepathy and telephone technology
is developed so closely to wireless comm. technology, chances are that
wire-basd communications technology for voice-only is a rarity in Zho space.
This probably would have hindered their development of planetary data networks,
etc.

Interesting. Perhaps. The Zhodani, in general, dislike absorbing more into
the Consulate than they feel comfortable handling. The Regency would
be very uncomfortable. On the other hand, the Zhos have never faced a large
enemy (to our knowledge) that had wide-spread psionic usage. That would be 
a bit of a change...

I think that was me :)  You\'re right, but on the other hand we *know*
how much energy is added, it\'s the thrust MW of the recombustion
chamber.  Since they said it was "safe", and the mdrives are *really*
small compared to a fusion drive, if it says 50MW/gturn that\'s what it
is.  You have Joules per second, and you know how long a turn is, and
how much fuel is spit out, so there you have it.  It doesn\'t add up
unless some fraction of the propellant is actually fused in addition to
the input power from the PP.

    'body' => '     I picked up a few tidbits about the long-awaited Regency Sourcebook 
     that we\'re all clamoring about.
     
     For one, the First Regent is one Coranda Alkhalikoi-Aledon, son of 
     reluctant royal couple, Avery and Seldrian, whom I\'m sure you all 
     remember from Arrival Vengeance.  Coranda was apparently a dynastic 
     offspring (I believe that means born in a test tube).
     
     Mora has been elevated to tech level 16.  I think this is the only 
     world to be elevated as such.  I would guess that the other worlds 
     rated this high are Depot/Deneb, Vincennes/Deneb, Daryen/Spinward 
     Marches, Tobia/Trojan Reaches and possibly Pashus/Deneb.  From what I 
     understand, though, Mora and Vincennes are the only two TL-16 worlds 
     on which consumer products are readily available.
     
     The book details all the subsectors of the Regency and not just the 
     Spinward Marches as I had been led to believe some time back.  This 
     includes all 32 subsectors of both Deneb and the Spinward Marches, the 
     coreward four subsectors of the Trojan Reaches and most of Reft (not 
     including the rimward-trailing wilds portion next to Gushemege and 
     Dagudashag (or is it Zarushagar; my astrography eludes me).
     
     There are some 8-10 new ship designs, including the ones you may have 
     seen listed among the new RAFM miniatures.  The listed RAFM miniatures 
     to be added to the line are:
     
     -- RQS Inspection Launch w/Missile Rack
     -- Aslan RQS Quarantine Cutter
     -- Darrian Patrol Cruiser
     -- Cuspid Class Gunboat
     -- Fang Class Gunboat
     -- Jump (Ship Boat)
     
     I have no idea what that cryptic last one is.  I\'m just typing them as 
     I see them from RAFM\'s order sheet.  Could it be a jump ship?  Like 
     the one listed in Supplement 9, Fighting Ships?  Hmm.
     
     Since only six are listed above, I would guess there are a few more in 
     the book.
     
     CT fans will be happy to find out that the Regency Sourcebook makes 
     references to CT books.  For instance, the double-adventure story, 
     Divine Intervention, is referenced when Pavabid is discussed.
     
     Mind you I don\'t have a copy of the Regency Sourcebook either, so this 
     is all technically hearsay.  But it should be pretty accurate for the 
     most part.

No

Try this on for size, and it is (near) realistic. When someone use active 
sensor, take the active sensor short range and multiply with 2. Within this 
range the task to detect are easy. Increase the difficulty as you move 
outwards in rangebands. The Extreme rangeband wil go far out as 160 hexes 
for an active sensor with a short range of 10.. Outside this the task 
becomes impossible.

Jamming yes, but not in a sense that makes lay men understand waht jamming 
means. Chaff and flares? Naah.

It will. I\'ll show you the math. I now assume that we remote control the 
missile. The target are 10 hexes away from the controlling unit. The missile 
are moving with a speed of 10 hexes, while the target is moving 5 hexes a 
turn. Com lag is roughly 1 second, and the detection lag is the same (the 
time EM radiation goes from the target to the passive sensing unit). This 
gives us a lag of about 2 seconds. The Scout is moving at a velocity of 
83333 meters a second. The missile twice as far. When a course correction 
comes from the controlling unit, the target has moved 166666 meters, 
including what ever it manages to increase and decrease of velocity in these 
seconds, and course alterations too. If this missile is impact oriented, it 
will never hit. And the situation becomes worse if the attacker are using 
active radar. In additon as the missile tries to close. it is just x and y 
coordinates that the defender needs to put down to nail the missile with a 
laser shot. This is the reason that I never liked the big hex/time scales of 
Traveller space combat. It\'s just too large to make any real sense.

It sounds interesting, but alas missiles tend to work poorly in the scale 
Traveller present its space combat. Never liked the time and hex scale. 
Would rather see something like 1000Km hex and 1 minute turn or something.

Maybe, but while the missile is thrusting, it is better to think of the
exhaust 
as a big obvious pointer leading exactly to the end of the missile. If it 
stopped thrusting, it might be comparitively invisible until it left its
exhaust 
far enough behind, though.

I might be wrong, but if you heat the hydrogen up to the temperature of the 
reactor core, its no longer a plasma, but instead starts to fuse itself 
(although you\'re not maintaining the same kind of pressure, so maybe not).

Maybe we should stop trying to explain thruster technology from millenia
ahead 
in terms of current projected technology. Traveller HEPlaR is best defined as

RRGRMUTT (really really good reaction-mass-using thruster technology). Its 
distinguishing features (from TNE canon) are
1/Its really very fuel efficient
2/It generates massive thrust
3/Its okay to stand within a meter or two of one on a small vehicle, or
around 
ten to twenty meters of it on a starship. (I\'m open to suggestions on this
one, 
but that seems about right)
4/It doesn\'t heat up the reaction mass enough to make the exhaust visible

How does it work? Dunno. Mumble something about major gravitic acceleration
of 
the reaction mass (no ions, no plasma). Ignore what FFS says about it being 
plasma if you have any players who know better ("I know you\'ve got a PhD in 
Physics, but this is a really special kind of plasma you\'ve never heard of 
before") otherwise use it, what\'s the difference, a rose by any other name,
and 
so on.

James, thank you very much for your post on ship yards from "Trillion Credit
Squadron". That was what I was looking for! I have heard alittle about that
book but don\'t have access to it. I really appreciate the information!

On your question as to why I collapsed Mnemosyne: after my reading of the
"Traveller: The New Era" and "Survival Margins" rule books as far as the
spread
of the virus, there was no mention of anyone outside of the Zhodani empire
and
the states in Deneb, Spinward Marches and Trojan Reaches plus some of the
Reft
and Riftspan Reaches.

I made the assumption that the virus would travel coreward of the Zhodani and
also cross the reft spinward of the Aslan Hierate and hit the region spinward
of the Regency as well. I assumed that the Quarantine ran up the spinward
side
of the Spinward March and Trojan Reach sectors, extending a little bit into
The
Beyond to areas where the Aslan were in control. I took it that the minor
states to spinward did not have the communications network to get the warning
or military strength to protect themselves from the virus when it arrived. I
based that on the fact that so many empires went under to the virus,
Solomani,
K\'kree, Aslan, the Villani and to some extent the Hivers (I havn\'t read the
new
Hiver sourcebook or "Vampire Fleets").

Have I missed something (quite possible)?

Enlighten me please!

This is good news for my own TL9 pocket empire. A world with a population of
5 
billion could support 5 million tonnes of ship, that\'s about 350,000 
displacement tonnes. While a small to medium TL9 ship is quite laughable to a

TL12 ship, a 100,000 rate cruiser built at TL9 would be scary even to the 
Coalition\'s big clippers, and this would be within reach of a high
population, 
aggressively expansionist world. Fun :-). I\'ll post it and my pocket empire\'s

background once I\'ve finished them off. 

Whatever the problems of Wilds and RCES campaigns, we should thank GDW for 
making us design ships at TL12 and less. In MT days, the broadly TL14/15 
Imperium made it all too tempting to go for the higher tech designs.

Yeah they do!  FFS, *not* BL.  Its right there in the rules, number of
flares/chaff popped per turn per hexside, etc..  Don\'t have FFS in from
of me, but it\'s right next to the EMM/Stealth stuff.  Really.

> Sorry haven\'t played MayDay. 

Too bad, it was a good game.  In a nutshell (for those of you who don\'t
have Mayday, Triplanetary, or Battle Rider):  Each ship/missile/whatever
has a past, present, and future position marker.  You change course by
using gturns to alter the future position counter, then move all the
counters up a notch when you\'ve decided where the future position should
be. (past goes to present, present to future, then you plot ahead to the
new future position based on the vector between past and present).

This allows more precise maneuvering.

So you\'re saying docking is impossible?  Or at least boarding.  Besides
if the missile is FIM, then the lag is only 1 second.  And as it gets
closer, the lag is less and less.  My KKM rules *require* a missile to
have its own guidance for this very reason.  I never said hitting would
be easy, just that it would not be impossible (as GDW says).

If the scout is moving 5, it can alter its future position by two hexes
on either side of its future position.  This gives a cone of space where
the scout *has* to be during the turn----and a plane (line in the game)
where it has to be at a given moment.  Knowing which way the scout is
thrusting would be a requisite part of an intercept solution, otherwise
it\'d be pure luck.  Also, at the point of time you mention above, the
missile has 200,000 meters per second of delta V available (12gturns) 
Assuming the inital coasting vector puts it more or less in the path of
the target, it should hit. Besides which, it needs to get to the same
hex even if it is a det-laser missile.

The scale may indeed be a bit off, but what if the missile isn\'t seen
until it fits in the shorter range scale?  You seem to be saying a
missile could never hit the target.  If the detection/launch range was
30,000km instead of 300,000km (still with 200 km/s delta v) would it
hit?

Interesting.  This suggests that the "HIWG Regency" data that is in the
archive was not used.  Tobia is probably still tech-15; tech-16 is from
Leroy\'s archive files.  Of the "sixteeners" that remain, in 1120 their 
vital stats were:
  Vincennes/Vincennes   Twenty billion, industrial, subsector capital.
  Mora/Mora             Ten billion, industrial, domain capital.
  Darrian/Darrian       Two billion, Confederation capital, special case.
                        Not Regency, either, unless something\'s changed....
  Depot/Inar            Two million, naval depot. 
  Pashus/Zeng           Eighty thousand, research station Zeta in Deneb.
                        Already tech-16 in the 1100s.

Yeah, Vincennes and Mora look like the only consumer product sources at
tech-16 if that\'s true.  

Oh, and:
>     For one, the First Regent is one Coranda Alkhalikoi-Aledon, son of

Caranda, probably.  Caranda was the first Duke of Regina, elevated from
baron by the first emperor of the Alkhalikoi dynasty, Grand Admiral of
the Marches Arbellatra Alkhalikoi -- he gave great support to her move
to become Regent of the Imperium, and later Empress.  If you have World
Builder\'s Handbook by DGP, you can see on the map that a large island 
on Regina is named after him.  This would be a *very* nice touch, if 
it\'s true too.

altitudes.  At low altitudes, when taking off or landing, additional 
reaction mass is needed.  This is provided in the form of liquid hydrogen 
which is mixed with the air at the heating coils -- they combine 
explosively and provide the additional thrust needed, leaving only water 
vapor as a waste product."

Hehehe.  They don\'t exist (\'cept the ones in BL).  You can use the rules
for converting BL ships to BR ships backwards to at least get the
tonnages of the ships.  There have been a few designs for big ships
posted on the TML, I know they\'re archived and you can get \'em.  There
are a few basic "rules" for military ships (that I can think of):

1.  Look at the BR damage values chart (in the back of the BR
rulebook)--those are the nubers you need to shoot for in a design (why
make a meson gun that does 499 in BL when 1 more dmage point will make
it jump from 9 to 10 in BR?).

2.  Big ships can have big armor.  A battleship can easily have a BR
armor of 20 (armor gets tonnage % cheap with increased size).

3.  The conversion rules from BL to BR are broken regarding number of
missiles controlled (they count one per MFD instead of MFDs*FC rating).
Missiles are nasty in BR, carry a lot of them :)  (there are 50ton bay
designs in the archives that hold/control 36 missiles)

4.  Add an aux bridge (it\'ll negate a bridge hit in BR).

5.  Start with 50 gturns (~22% of ship) and only add more if you have
room later.

6.  Since missiles are good, have a bunch of small anti-missile lasers
(hundreds on a big ship)----don\'t bother with dampers til they have some
damper screens that work over a wide area (the ones in FFS will kill a
missile less often than a small laser).

7.  It isn\'t really in the rules, but in a design for BL divide the
HEPlaR reignition chambers into a few smaller ones.  They\'ll be easier
to kill, but one mdrive hit won\'t kill you dead (and even though most
canon ships seem to have multiple nozzles, they have one hit area in
BL--we did this early on so a character\'s Gazelle wouldn\'t have a 1 shot
kill against it. 

8.+  I\'ll write more if I think of \'em :)

Hi, 
     I just picked up a great book by Robert Forward, the guy
who wrote "Starquake" and the Rocheworld novels, called
"Indistinguishable from Magic".  It\'s a series of essays about
possible future techs and some short stories using those techs. 
He covers a whole lot of ground, from antimatter to beanstalks

----Multi-Part-Message-Level-1-1-8506

         to space/time warps to anti-grav.  I havn\'t gotten through the
         whole thing yet, but one thing really struck me:  he outlines a
         method for reactionless anti-grav drives, ala MegaTrav thruster
         plates, and includes an explanation of why they dont break any
         physical laws, although it does rely on the discovery of a type of
         matter, "negative matter" as yet unknown.  This does mean though
         that thrusters are not any more or less "realistic" than jump
         drive (for what that is worth). 

             I\'d recommend this one for any of the TDR sort out there -
         whether or not this stuff is possible, it is at least internally
         consistent.  The articles on beanstalks/space fountains are also
         fascinating, although probably less interesting in a standard Trav
         universe.

             It\'s out as a Baen paperback, $5.99 US.

Howdy,

Just thought I\'d throw another log on the fire regarding missiles.  In
the absence of kinetic kill missiles all missiles are of the det-laser
type, and are therefore rather nasty weapons of mass destruction.  Any
free trader with a missile launcher is a pretty dangerous guy (er,
person... ah, being :).

If you don\'t have a non-nuke missile then I assume only the military or
pirates have \'em, right?  *Having* a missile launcher would equal a long
jail term ("...nuclear weapons are looked upon with a particularly intense
revulsion."-FFS, pg.143) since there are *no other* types of missile.

This is kinda interesting for all nuke-missile campaigns----customs would
get close to take a look and make sure you don\'t have any weapons of
mass destruction around.  If you do, you\'d have to have them confiscated
in order to get fueled up to leave the system (you can\'t drive to the
gas giant unless the primary world orbits it)----that or nuke the patrol
boat :)

And with respect to GDWs design notes on missiles needing to be big
and expensive (another reason againt KKMs), they aren\'t all that big,
and the warhead costs 1.2MCr out of the missiles 1.25MCr total cost.
All the guidance systems in FFS list costs in Cr, not MCr, BTW (I know
the warhead has all the non-propulsion gear).  I think KKMs would come
in at a price that would let you get 20-25 KKMs for every det-laser
(around 50,000Cr each) missile.  A bay full of KKMs for the price of 2
det-laser missiles :)  Actually, if you use KKMs, this is kinda cool
(aside from letting PCs have missiles that won\'t get them tarred and
feathered in port) since there is a reason to have smaller missile
launchers.

KKMs would have to be self guiding (even if the target is painted by the
launcher).  Missile bays might have KKMs, and turrets/barbettes would
have the more effective det-lasers.  Smaller ships (military) would have
the detlasers since they can\'t carry as many missiles.  In addition it
gives the small ships city-killing power if needed----of course a single
scout at the starport could kill an infinite number of missiles trying
to get so close to a city ;-)

I\'d hazard about 0.06kl (for me, anyway :)

Figure that people are more or less water, so our density is one liter
per kilogram.  The denser stuff would balance with lower density stuff
(fat, for example) IMHO, so it should be close.

A FIM I suppose is a Full Independent Missile. Of course they will not 
experince any time lag as they approach the target. But a Impact missile 
would if it is remotely controlled.

A FIM with its own guidance is vulnerable on several points. If it is 
passive homing it can easily be lured off with a decoy. An active homing can 
be jammed, and it will be detected and shot before it comes too close.

What I say is remote controlled missiles would most likely miss their target 
if they had to physically hit the target. because you just can\'t predict 
where the target are going to be in two seconds or three seconds. A small 
ship with high gee capability would easily place its window wherever it 
wants. The controller has to guess where that window is. With other words 
you are shooting blind. If the lag was down to just a few tenths of a 
second, the situation would be different. And now I ain\'t talking about 
moving a few markers on a gameboard, but real life. In such an environment a 
detonation missile makes sense.

OK.  So in real life we agree that if one ship isn\'t moving around too
much the other can get close to being in the same place at the same
time.

I didn\'t say it was remotely controlled.  But it might be semi-active
(launcher illuminates target).  In fact I said that they would have to
be FIMs (or SIMs as long as they did their own \'thinking\' in the final
stages of the interceot).

OK, it can be jammed.  The point is traveller, though (albeit trying to
make it more realistic but still traveller).  What do jammers do in
traveller (or how can we make jammer/decoys in traveller distract such
missiles with a realistic frequency).  And if you say it can be shot,
I\'ll agree here, too.  I\'ll make my missiles full active, but not until
they\'re within a few tenths of a light second.  How many can you shoot?
I\'ll shoot one more.  If my missiles cost less than your ship I win
bigtime.  If they cost less than both our ships together I still win.  I
can buy about 5,000 impact missiles for the price of a Gazelle, you have
4 lasers and 30 minutes to get all of them :)  

One of the previous posts said that any missile would be seen if it were
bigger than a grape and metal...  that\'d make the sensor active, what if
the missile is a anti-radiation missile?  At the very least these would
force your enemy not to use their active sensors.  Considering how
crappy passives are, that\'s a good trade..

Lasers do in the game at 2 light seconds... 4 round trip sensor/laser
time.  They have a high ROF, though---- although you can hit at that kind
of range with an ROF of 5 shots in 30 minutes.  As for the prediction,
why not?  A 6g ship can change its position by 176.4 meters in 3
seconds.  Thats a ship radius or so for a battleship.  Enough for a
laser to miss, but not a couple thousand km wide cloud of BSD birdshot.
Remember as well that the weapon need not actually hit the target.  It
just detonates and spreads a cloud of pellets, the lower mass of the
individual pellets makes no difference as the KE goes as the velocity
squared, but linearly with shot mass.  3 seconds assumes the missiles
detonate within less than 1000km, however.

All that said, I agree that they would *most likely* miss.  But what
percentage will miss, that is the important question in the game
(especially when they\'d cost 20-25 times less than det lasers).  

I think some would hit give that they have twice the delta v of a ship
for the short period of time it matters (the flight time to target).

Agreed, det lasers make sense.  The rules should make playing Kinetic
Kill Missiles inefficient if that is the way they\'d be.  Instead the
rules ignore the possibility. Det-lasers go off at 0-2 tenths of a second
sensor lag (and 2 tenths is at TL17+).  That puts *any* missile within "a
few tenths of a second" situation.  What if the missile still has
10gturns left at that point?  I can remote controll the missile to
within 2 hexes, then turn it loose (after handing off a sensor lock) 
with a bunch of gturns to use.  My point is that if you can get a
missile to within 15,000km to detonate, I can get one to hit (if it
isn\'t spoofed or shot down) if it makes it to that point with a bunch of
fuel left and the ability to burn it fast.
 
If you think they\'d work at shorter ranges, give me some ideas.  We know
they\'ll work at hundreds of km for sure.  If they work within a couple
tenths of a light second then fighters have a reason to exist----they can
carry fully ind. KKMs to within a hex or two, then let \'em loose.

                Law Enforcement (2, Generic; 2, Firm)
                Criminal (1, Generic)

The firm contacts are as follows:
        Government:
                Chief of Starport Security Forces.  As a
                Lieutenant, Donohue was appointed the Detail
                Commander of the Starport Security Supplement.  As
                such, he was required to coordinate SSS activities
                with those of the regular starport security forces.
                Donohue\'s detail was responsible for the
                apprehension of an important link in a major
                smuggling ring.

                Chief of Staff to the Coalition General Secretary.
                Captain Donohue was in charge of arranging security
                for the General Secretary for a public appearance
                on Reformation Day.  Their relationship is one of
                "personal friends" because of an affinity of
                personality, rather than because of any specific
                police-related activity.

        Law Enforcement:
                Chief of Patrol, Trantown PD.  Donohue\'s mentor
                during his career on the force.  Used his pull to
                get Donohue assigned to certain choice details,
                such as the Starport Security Supplement.  Donohue
                has done favors for him in the past, and will do so
                in the future.

                Commanding Officer, Trantown PD Public Morals Unit
                ("Vice Squad").  Donohue is owed favors by this
                individual, due to several good tips provided to
                Donohue by certain underworld figures in Trantown.

Motivations:
        Diamond Queen: Lustful.  Donohue sees himself as G-d\'s gift
        to women, or, perhaps more accurately, as a sex god
        himself.  He does not believe that any woman can resist his
        charm, since "I practically ooze sex appeal".  Obviously,
        any woman that doesn\'t immediately want to go to bed with
        him is a "frigid b*tch".  People who know him suggest that
        by his standards, easily half the population of Trantown
        (the female half) qualifies as "frigid".

        Spade Eight: Ambitious.  Donohue wants to become the
        greatest private investigator ever seen on Aubaine.
        Unfortunately, his skills are clearly weak in the areas
        where a detective needs strength.  Such is the fortune of
        staff and administrative assignments.  He has made an
        effort to acquire some of the skills he needs, but seems to
        lack the willpower needed to stay the course.

Donohue does _not_ like his given names, and usually uses
"D. M. Donohue" on most of his identification documents.  If
pressed for the meaning of "D. M.", he will reply with a standard
line: "I don\'t like what it means, and I don\'t use what it means.
I\'d rather be called \'Flatfoot\' than by my right name."  He first
used the line when he decided to go into law enforcement;
unfortunately (or maybe not), the rest of his class in police
training picked up on it.  It has become comfortable as a nickname,
and if he is brought into an adventure where a taccode or similar
call is needed, he will voluntarily use "Flatfoot".

Referees should equip him (remembering to deduct from his funds,
above) as befits an ex-cop.  Be sure to include a slug pistol of
some sort, preferably one similar to what the Trantown PD uses as
its standard firearm (probably 9mm semi-auto).  Trantown PD rules
allow him to wear a Trantown PD uniform on ceremonial occasions,
without the police shield or unit identifiers, but with his earned

1.      Mertactor

Wow, putting all of the list notes together, Mertactor now comes to over
100K!
(as a Word 6 document, anyway). Chris has done well to raise such debate.
Here\'s
my Cr 0.02.

I have to agree with Hans, Mertactor was settled well before Glisten, if you
look at the Supp 9: Library Data doco. This appears to be because it is on
the
Spinward Main, and the historical maps show that settlement spread along the
main before it crossed the "gaps". The District 268 arm was settled much more
slowly than the Regina end because of the blocking effect of the proto-Sword
Worlds. Mertactor is part of the settled region on the year-300 map.

There have been many reasons given for the colonisation trip, and many
justifications as to cost. I would recommend that something should be
included
in the RICE Paper to address these issues.

BTW, when you say "9 jumps to Mora", I assume you mean via the xboat link?
By jump-1 it is heaps. Maybe you could say something like this: "The Moran
ships were briefed to get the "colonists" as far away as possible, but still
on a habitable world. They pushed thru the SW barrier along the Main, but
found
that most worlds were already claimed by someone. Mertactor was the first
place
they came to which was habitable and unclaimed, so they dumped the people
here
without bothering to search any further. This original indifference to the
colonists is yet another reason why Mertactorans hate Morans".

2.     Publishing rights

GDW buys the first-time publishing rights for articles. Does publishing a
RICE
Paper mean that GDW will no longer buy your article (ie. because they can\'t
get
first-time rights?) Or does publication on a listserv not count as
"first-time"?
I hope that you can publish a RICE Paper in order to refine what you\'ve got,
before submitting it to GDW.

Can anyone help with this question?

3.      Collapsing Foreven

I believe that Survival Margin includes all of the non-aligned territories
"behind" the Regency and "under" the Zhos, so they would not have collapsed
at
all. Maybe Grant Sinclair (Yiklerdanzh Project) could confirm this?

An argument can also be made to exclude the spinward part of Aslan space and
the
coreward area from Zhodani space. With the Aslan, there simply may not be the
planets for Virus to take over. I would think that Aslan settlement peters
out
at the edges, and there would not be the ships to make the crossing. However,
maybe you can argue that Viris is trying to overcome this, and in fact WILL
present a problem in the future. Yet more adventure(r) possibilities.

Corward of the main bloc of Zhodani territory lies a corridor aimed at the
core
of the galaxy. These areas would be protected as per the rest of Zhodani
territory - a no-go area for the Virus.

4.      Human Volume

I\'m away for a week, so can someone else look up Book 8: Robots and give the
various torso volumes to Jerry Alexandratos?

The nebelwerfer (like the katyusha) was a multple rocket launcher, not
a mortar. Use the design rules from the end of FF&S. You will have to
design both the rockets and the launcher.

Well I wrote the article in March and I\'m sure the source I used (the old CT

A single gazelle would be beaten. But using 5000 misslies are overkill. And

I\'ld go silent, or change frequency drastically on the sensors when I saw 
the missiles, and then pop off some decoys.

What I feel is wrong with the rules are the scale. Missiles are not 
dangerous when you got all the time in the world to react with 
countermeasures. At smaller scales bot ranges and time, the ship commander 
are under much higher pressure. This will make the a wrong command near 
impossible to correct. When you got 30 minutes, you can revise the order and 
change tactic 10 minutes after the order is given, and still have fairly 
good time left. In space I think missiles will be more of a weapon than 
energy weapons. But that is in the real-world(tm).

How about a ship that\'s running away, or heading your way but

Shouldn\'t that be 5M displacement tonnes?

Watching _Top Gun_ on TV last night, I got to wondering how space (as
opposed to wet) carriers worked. Launch is fine, you just need a tube
slightly larger than the fighter, and squirt it out using some sort of
catapult, mag-lev, or even the fighter\'s own drives. Retreival, however,
is a lot harder - for a start, the landing deck is almost certainly going
to be *inside* the ship, enclosed on four, or even five, sides, rather than
just two (including the tower), so landing\'s going to be much harder. The
deck\'s going to have to be in vacuum most of the time, so the ground crew
and pilots will have to be in vac suits (clumsy). Also, you don\'t have the
option of bulldozing wrecks over the side to clear the deck. Thoughts,
anyone?

I just read the message about Forwards book in Digest 400. What\'s much
more interesting to me than the Reactionless drive is the idea of "strange
matter", a matter created by fusing quarks into a very heavy particle.
It is interesting that this big particle can be used to generate energy
without any radioactivity. The short story "A Matter most Strange" gave
some ideas and troubles with this matter ...and thus some adventure ideas

You don\'t need to. AM3 states that the average weight is about 60 kilos. An 
average human is about 80.

Cool, and the decoy and jammer rules are extant in BL.  So far we\'re on
the road to usable (if inefficient) KKMs.

I\'m confused about what you mean.  Are you saying in traveller missiles
(impact type) won\'t work, or in real life?

As for the reaction time arguement, I just don\'t get it.  You have all
the time in the world to react to them, but at those kind of ranges you
can\'t lock or kill very many missiles in a turn.  As a result, it
doesn\'t matter.  Remember that while a turn is 30 minutes, individual
events take place in a shorter period of time (a laser pulse is still
0.001 second or so, for example).  So while the missile is moving say 10
hexes in the turn it intercepts the target, the only time that matters
to the target is the minute or so when the missile is in the range of
close in defense systems (the point at which det-lasers get fired on at
the point of detonation).

At the ranges where killing the missiles gets easy, the missile is only .75 
minutes away and going *very* fast.  I don\'t see what difference the scale makes
in this regard since in the BL scale, any missile, regardless of type has to
close within a range that I think we would both agree taxes the defensive 
capabilities of the target in the way you describe above.

  My roommate is a physics kind of guy; if I have any kind of
  questions about it, he can usually give me an answer, or at the
  very least, an informed guess that\'s not inconsistent with
  reality.

  I was thinking about the CT/MT thruster plates recently, and came
  up with something that just might account for their "magic":

  1.  Grav modules apply energy to create lift.

  2.  Thrust plates effectively allow grav modules to work outside
      a gravity well.

  3.  Thrust plates therefore must convert grav energy into
      something else that doesn\'t require a gravity well to react
      against.

  4.  Neutrinos seem to ignore almost all mass that happens to get
      into their path.

  5.  Despite the fact that they don\'t have any detectable mass,
      they _do_ seem to possess that quality of mass known as
      momentum.

  6.  Momentum equals mass times velocity.

  7.  Momentum is a vector quantity.

  8.  The Universe is a closed system.

  9.  The total momentum of the Universe must therefore remain
      constant.

 10.  Therefore, creating neutrinos and imparting a momentum vector
      upon them must also impart a momentum vector on something
      else, with a reversed direction.

 11.  Recall that neutrinos seem to ignore everything in their
      path.

 12.  Thrust plates convert grav energy into neutrinos, with a
      specified momentum.

 13.  This requires a reverse vector to be applied to something.

 14.  That something is the ship to which the thrust plates are
      attached.

 15.  Since neutrinos don\'t seem to affect anything in their path,
      the appearance to the common person is that the ship simply
      moves, with the only apparent "reaction" being that the
      thrust plates are glowing this funny blue color.

 16.  So, the common person, who cannot be expected to know the
      details of physics, calls the grav-generator-plus-thrust-
      -plates arrangement "reactionless thrusters".

 17.  How the thrust plates convert grav energy to neutrinos is
      left as an exercise for the student.

 If we can generate neutrinos at will, why do we need this HePlAR
 stuff?

Regarding Andy Boulton\'s discussion on Space Carriers in Digest 401, I think
retreval of fighters could be easier than in wet navy carriers, as there is
is no gravity to pull the space fighter down. It could thrust up to an entry
port and either enter under it\'s own power, or be brought in by grapples ( a
better method, as the Carrier\'s internal gravity field could bring a fighter
down awkwardly. The Carrier would need to be accelerating at a constant rate,
or for an easy docking to not be accelerating at all.
As to the landing deck being in vacuum, use airlocks at the launch tubes and
retreval ports and everyone can be in shirtsleeves. Hangar would be a better
term than landing deck, as the fighters \'land\' at the retreval ports. Wrecks
wouldn\'t need to be dumped off the ships, as in wet carriers this was necessary
to clear the flight deck for other planes coming in to land.

The way I see it, a  Space Carrier would need several launching tubes on the 
centerline and/or on either side of it, leading back to the hangar. The 
retreval ports would be on the side of the ship, and the hangar itself as
deep inside the ship as it could be, to avoid it being depressurised by 
enemy fire. Maybe multiple hangars. Would it be worth puting the hangar
in zero-g, so the fighters could be stored on the \'ceiling\' and \'walls\',
as fighter capacity is the measure of Carrier offensive strength.

as an aside, have any UKers seen Challenge 77  on the shelves yet?
I can\'t wait for the Regency Sourcebook, if all the rumors in the recent
digests are correct it\'s going to be a great read.

seeing that fighter capacity is the measure of a Carriers offensive

Possibly, and with grav catwalks around, you could still put your tools
down and not have \'em float away if they get nudged :-)

As for offensive strength, what good are fighters anyway?  I think
they\'d be mostly missile carriers themselves.  Related to the missile
thread (well, at a real tangent to FIMs from KKMs) you\'d need to have
fire and forget missiles for these guys.  Even if they are det laser
missiles FIMs will need to be carried kinda close since they won\'t
always have as many gturns.  

On the subject of missile design, anyone else get really odd results
designing missiles?  I have been giving my spreadsheet a go, and as far
as I can tell *all* published missiles have to be around 25gs (although
they have fewer gturns of delta v).  In addition, I get around 16 gturns
for the standard TL15 missile, not the 12 published.  *scratches head*

Odd, huh?  Anybody have better luck?

Some notes on using Fully Independent Missiles (FIMs):
 
FIMs are mentioned in BL, but we never get to see one.  The problem with
using them is how to have them behave like missiles, and not like they
are being controlled by a person.  The concentration on SIMs and
controlled missiles in BL is because the PC controlling it uses
his/her/its skill to avoid being spoofed by the target (a way to get the
players into it, IMHO).
 
Here are some guidelines for playing FIMs in BL using stuff you already
have. I need to design some FIMs from scratch, but I hate the missile
design rules :-)
 
What do they look/act like?
----
Fully independent missiles can be true "fire and forget" missiles or
they may require guidance in the form of designating the target with a
ship\'s own active sensors.  Regardless, at some point they achieve a
sensor lock on a target, then attempt to intercept it.  FIMs may have
sensor locks handed-off to them before or after they are launched
(depending on how they are designed). 
 
FIMs are active, passive, or, rarely, both.  Active FIMs are frequently
programmed to drift a short period of time before "pinging" their
targets.  Actives are also bigger and more expensive than passives.
Passive FIMs all home on active sensor radiation as well as the target\'s
EMS signature.  
 
Design:
----
FIMs are designed as normal space missiles (what a pain :-), but they
must have some kind of a sensor installed.  A small passive sensor works
well, and in fact, many FIMs home on reflected active signals from the
firing ship since they can use the shortrange of the firing shipUs
active sensor (not double the range in this case, since their sensor
path length is not half).  
 
Sample types:
----
1.  PEMS FIM for ARM (anti-radiation missile) use.  Use the smallest
PEMS possible.  If it is used as an ARM then it will home on the active
signal of the target and calculate the difficulty level based on twice
the target active sensor\'s short range.  Once relatively close it can
home on the passive signature of the target even if it isn\'t active (in
this case it will use the seeker head\'s own passive short range). 
 
	*  Design your own, or just use the TL12 SIM in FFS.  The cost for a KKM
	version is 0.8MCr.
 
 
2.  In designated (semi-active) mode, an AEMS, Radar, or Ladar lock on
the target by the firing (or sometimes another ship or drone) is
detected by the missile, and it homes on that signal.  The Missile is
designed with a short range PEMS (or HRT) and when it attempts Lock-On
it uses the SR of the active "painting" sensor, but the range will be
the range to the designating ship, or missile----whichever is longer.  
 
	*  Design your own, or use the TL12 SIM in FFS.  The cost for a KKM
	version is 0.8MCr.
 
3.  Active Homing Missile.  This missile type has a AEMS  or RADAR
sensor.  It has a sensor lock passed off to it by the firing ship, then
goes active and homes on its target.  They are frequently used as SIMs
and controlled until near their targets so that passive locks may be
used until the point they have to go active (in an attempt to avoid
countermeasures, and to conserve fuel).  These will have to be designed
from scratch as active sensors require power and volume such that they
most likely won\'t be the standard 1/2ton missile size (think of the
Pheonix as an example).  These are most likely Det-Laser missiles since
their size and expense justifies improving the chance of a hit at all
costs.
 
	*  Design your own, or use the TL12 active passive drone as a
	model--you\'ll have to call this a det-laser or it\'ll never hit unless
	the target does nothing to stop it.  
 
I included notes for KKM versions in case you use them.  Remember that
KKMs will need the target\'s evasion gturns left over (+evasion success
DM) after the hex intercept to even have a chance of hitting, so an 8G8
missile will be easily dodged by most any military ship.
 
 
A homing missile would operate under the following rules:
----
First premise:  Homing missiles *must* have a Lock-On to home in on a
target.
 
Second premise:  Homing missiles try to cross the present position of
their target using whatever fuel required (intercept).  (I use BR/Maydy
style movement here, BTW.  Ditch the heading wheel (except for facing)).
 
If they cannot, with a max burn, do this *this turn*, they will use the
minimum fuel required to put their future position (for the following
turn) as close to the future position of the target as possible (in any 
ambiguous situation try to put the future position of the missile *ahead* of 
the target\'s future position (it\'d be flying a lead pursuit)).  
 
The "minimum fuel required" is further limited by the missiles
programming.  Missiles may be programmed to burn no more than say 1
gturn in the event that it cannot intercept *that turn*.  I use this all
the time to avoid problems.  A missile is normally noted, say, 12G12, in
the programmed case above it would be written 12G12 1D6 (discretionary).
The trailing 6 is the maximum number of 1gturn burns the missile can
make before it will just drift----leaving it with 6 gturns to kill a
target that drifts too close.
 
That\'s it for driving the missiles :-)
 
Getting a Lock and firing:
----
FIMs must have a Lock to home on their targets.  As a result, they are
usually launched with a handed off lock.  In the case of SIMs (any FIM
with commo installed is a SIM) the lock may be handed off at some point
on the missiles path after launch, or even change.  Unlike the SIM rules which 
use the crew or PCs skill as an asset, FIMs have their own assets.
 
FIMs have an Asset=(TL - 5).
 
All tasks attempted by the FIM (or SIM operating as a FIM) are done at
this asset.
 
This will make them easier to "spoof" than controlled missiles, a good
thing, I think.  To deal with this assume that if a Lock-On attempt by a
FIM fails, it may try again next turn (or even a different target this
turn).  If the Lock-On task is a Catastrophic Failure then the missile\'s
guidance system is totally spoofed and the missile goes ballistic (or
chases the decoy if one was used) and is useless.

Retrieval is simple in space - if you aren\'t accellerating  - you match 
velocities so you aren\'t moving relative to each other, mate with a docking arm 
and be pulled into the hangar bay.  Final approach to the docking arm can be at 
drift speeds (cm/sec).  This is basically how space craft dock even now; it\'s 
also the same principle as docking with a space station
(If you are accelerating linearly, you can match accellerations too, but you 
have to cut thrust as you are grabbed, making the task more difficult.)

No problem - you mate the fighter airlock to a docking tube (like the main 
spaceships use), and walk right in... If you\'re in a launch tube then this sort 
of mating is just part of the handling mechanism that loads you into the 
b/a/r/r/e/l tube.
[See (some of) the movies.  What you don\'t do is the Star Wars/Star Trek hangar 
bay which is pressurised while you walk over to your craft, then the whole 
volume pumped out and bay doors opened to let you out.]

>Also, you don\'t have the
>option of bulldozing wrecks over the side to clear the deck.

If a fighter is hit outside the mothership, then you need to collect the crew; 
you may want the wreckage if it is repairable(the mothership can manoeuvre to 
match an inert ship).  You probably do want a vacuum opening hangar to bring in 
repairs.

If you get a hit inside the hangar, you\'re stuffed.  The rules say that a launch 
tube hit destroys use of that tube; a hangar hit is likely to cause enough 
wreckage that you can\'t use the hangar even if you remove the junk.

OK, it\'s humble pie time. I went home and had a look at my original sources 
and here\'s what I found:

Note: The following quotes are copyright to their respective authors. No 
challenge to the copyright is intended.

In Journal of the Traveller\'s Aid Society, issue 8, page 13, it states:

"The typical Vargr is about 1.6 meters in height and weighs approximately 
100 kilograms."

In Traveller Alien Module 3, page 2, it states:

"The typical Vargr is about 1.6 metres in height and weighs approximately 60 
kilograms."

Apparently I used the wrong source. Oops!

Unfortunately, I didn\'t have DGP\'s Vilani and Vargr available when I was 
drawing up the article, but it goes on to say (on page 40):

"The average male of our race stands 1.6 meters in height and weighs 
approximately 60 kilograms. The average female is slightly smaller in 
stature, standing 1.5 meters and weighing roughly 55 kilograms.
Thus, the height-to-weight ratios for Vargr approximate 37 kilograms per 
meter. For comparison, the average human masses slightly more kilograms per 
meter."

>From that statement, I would think that the formula should be: Male 
[4x(STR-AGL)]+60; Female [4x(STR-AGL)]+55. But do whatever you like - it\'s 
your campaign (in one campaign I saw there were Vargr geneered from 
Chihuahuas who were about two feet tall! This inevitably led to many 
comments concerning Ewoks and Hobbits.).

Chris, hope you don\'t mind, but I\'m also cc\'ing this to the list.

Here\'s what I\'ve come up with for antropomorphic robots.  Merrick was
kind enough to reply that a human being (himself specifically) weighs
about 6kg.

The average human weighs somewhere between 6-8kg.  I chose 7.5 as my
average.  1000kg=>1tonne=>1kl.  So, I figured that .075 or so would be
the volume that we\'re aiming for.  Now, I settled for .1 figuring that
I could get a human looking 2 meter tall robot for@t value, and not
have it be to out of hand.

As for the volume of the limbs.  I used the armor table from the robot
design rules and broke those down as percentages of volume to allocate
to each body part.  Thus, the head is .1 or 10% of the total .1kl.  The
legs are 30% (or 15% each), etc...

Goofing around with it, I came up with what seemed to be correct
values.  I\'ll post my final design here when I\'m done so everyone can
pick it apart.

Hope this helps.

Yes, a penal settlement is a pretty obvious possibility. Indeed, I believe 
that was the original suggestion. But we keep forgetting those settlement
pattern maps where Mertactor is shown as being settled before 300 (though
there\'s no way to know how much before) but not part of the Imperium until
much later. Remember what The Crown also did, in addition to shipping convicts
to Australia? That\'s right, it claimed sovereignity over the whole continent.
If Mertactor was settled under the auspices of any official Moran government
activity, one would expect them to claim the planet as a colony, thus making
it a part of the Imperium. IMO the possibilities are limited to two: 1)
Mertactor was colonized by private initiative and was never a colony of
Mora, or 2) Mertactor was originally a Moran colony, but achieved (or was
given) independence before 300.

Time to blow off some pent-up, worthless geopolitical gobblegygoop before 
posting some useful items.

A) The less-than-astounding Grandfather: Just thinking... Remember that 
Grandfather built up a massive and extensive civilization, and blew it up by 
killing off the kiddies in a big-time Final War (the real one)?  And 
afterwords, he just built a pocket universe around Lair (or is it in the 
Spinward Marches?) and hid out for the next 300,000 years?
    Just pointing out that after WE blew it up, we just surged right 
back in again.  I\'m not certain that this makes us superiour to Gramps, 
but, since The Regency (and the Zho\'s, and the Daryen, and even the 
Hivers I suspect) still have TL 16, and assuming the max TL rises by one 
level every two centuries, we should equal Gandfather\'s TL 25 at about 
1600 years, or 2800 Imperial.  A remarkably short period of time from his 
perspective.  
    I wonder what\'s he going to do about it... but I bet we\'ll be harder 
to kill off than his clone children. (esp. if either the Zho\'s, or the
Imperials, plow ahead in psionics.)

B) The Imperial Fringe becomes the Imperial Core... Just thinking about a 
previous comment about how the pre-Collapse Imperium often confused the 
Imperial Fringe (ie. the Domain of Deneb, now the Regency) with the 
Lunatic Fringe.  
   Considering that some of the most powerful worlds in the 
area are off-centre theocracies (Deneb and Lintle), and that the area was 
settled by rather unsavoury Solomani societies that was anti-social 
enough to ship out over six hundred light-years from their homeworlds 
(spending untold trillions of credits in the process), and that, as the 
previous poster said, "until the 500s, the Marches was about in the same 
position as Africa was to the 19th century European mind", I would 
strongly tend to agree.
   However, now the Imperial Fringe has become the Imperial Core. The 
Regency has a higher population than the rest of the Blasted Area 
combined: and I doubt if the other guys will catch up anytime soon.  
It will be interesting to ride with the first of the Regency Scouts into, 
say, Vland (which would have a TL somewhere between 0 and 4 now, if memory 
serves).  Will they revere the ruins, like how we revere the ruins of 
Ancient Greece and Rome?  Will they be disgusted at the evidence of the 
failure of the Imperium, and raze it all as fast as they can?  Will they 
consider the locals barbarians, and resettle it with True Imperials (ie 
guys from Behind the Claw)?  Or will they attempt to teach the locals, 
seen as Imperial brothers, fallen on hard times?
    Oh Yeah, and will the new capital of the (Third? Restored? Fourth? 
Imperium) be at Mora, or will the old capital at Core be rebuilt?  Anyone 
for dual capitals?

C) AntiImperial viewpoints in the Wilds
   As far as can be known, the Regency plans to refound the Imperium.  
This will be no problem technologically or militarily, but will cause 
difficult political problems in the Wilds.  First off, a large 
minority/majority of the survivors in the Wilds will loath the return 
of the Imperials: they certainly don\'t identify with them (not after a 
massive civil war, a major die-off, and a near-complete fall-off of 
interstellar contact), and will pin the blame of the collapse on them.  
They are xenophobic, and the Regency citizen is *definitely* an alien 
to their eyes.  They are technophobic, and the Regency citizen has far 
too much technology on him to be trusted.  The people of the Wilds  have 
largely forgotten their Imperial heritage, and have only local concerns: 
they don\'t want to be taxed or ruled by a government 600 light-years away 
which has an unfortunate resemblence with Lucan\'s Imperium (The Imperial 
Sunbursts, the Noble Titles, even the money and the naval uniforms are 
sure to cause incidents.)  

Moreover, the less xenophobic, pro-tech rulers - the "cutting edge elite" of 
the Wild\'s -  have been free of interstellar control for 70+ years: many 
of these worlds\' rulers want to build their own interstellar states, not 
be reaborbed into someone elses empire.  The more far-seeing ones don\'t 
want their society swamped by an distant alien culture which is 
definitely superior in wealth, technology, and military power.  

Virus-dominated worlds are going to have a severe reaction to the antiVirus 
Regency.  A *lot* of Infected computers will hate the Regency with a 
passion, and do anything in their capasity to keep them away.  The 
strains that despises their own existance, viewing organic life as 
superior, will tend to favour the Regency over the RC.  ProLucan Virus 
strains may like the Regency a lot (and, I suspect, cause  plenty of 
political problems too!), antiLucan strains will hate the Regency as a 
matter of course.  [It\'s unlikely that Virus will seperate Lucan from the 
concept of the Third Imperium: they, like most of the human members of 
the Wilds, will tend to view them as indivisible.] 

And, of course, the RC will take an instant dislike to the Regency - a 
loathing that will be returned with interest.  The Sector Governour (or 
the Sector Duke - the Wilds are better ruled by decree than by votes) is 
going to have his hands full, dealing with the locals and interfering RC 
agents.

D) The Regency response
And how will the Regency respond to antiImperial attitudes?  Remembering 
that the Regency has a massive cash, tech, and military superiority to 
just about everyone else between the Zho\'s and the Hivers, I suspect 
that they will \'buy\' most of it off the Wilds.  The attitudes of Virus is 
immaterial to the Regency, as will be seen later.

The folk in the Wilds may or may not "believe" in the Nobility, but are 
familiar with the concept:  a large number of governments are TED\'s, 
similar in basis (if not in style) to the standard Feudal Technocracy.
In many instances, the Regency will simply either replace the local TED 
with a Regency Noble (one way to keep them from causing trouble back in 
Civilization) or slap the TED with a Regency Advisor (who, like the 
famous British Resident, actually gave the orders, with the TED acting as 
a respected figurehead.)

Those societies that ally themselves with the Regency/Imperium can expect 
plenty of cash flow.  There\'s a lot of rebuilding to do, from navy bases 
to factories to getting some A ports operational.  Ice-cold cemetery 
worlds need to be sterilized and picked clean and/or reoccupied.  Certain 
prestige worlds (Vland and Capital, among others) are going to have 
massive cash poured in to restore them to their former splendor - and 
provide a useful industrial base for local defense needs.  Those "Lesser 
breeds without the law" are going to have Imperial Law reintroduced to 
them: most of the Regency Marines for the Blasted Area are going to be 
drawn from previously reContacted worlds, trained by Denebi or Marchman 
officers. (It\'s a lot cheaper than continually shipping over Marines from 
behind the Claw, aka Civilization)   

There wil be those who will never voluntarily permit the Regency or a 
reborn Imperium to control their destiny.  That\'s where the Regency Navy 
and Marines step in.  Admittedly, they will be very thinly stretched out, 
with very few bases before, say, 1400.  [The Regency Navy may want to 
consider the Jump-capable starport idea, last seen in the Oydessy-class, 
50 million-ton (or thereabouts) scout ship.  It\'s either that, or start 
building a LOT of tenders.]  The base problem might be eased a bit if the 
Regency can find some intact - if infected - old Navy bases to disinfect 
and occupy.

E) Regency and Virus
    Virus and robots are apperantly hated with an unlimited depth in the 
Regency, from what I can gather from the last page of the Vampire Fleets 
book. (Umm, GDW, when is the Regency book coming out? I mean, *really* ?)
This implies that the Regency will simply sterilize any bit of Virus it 
can get it\'s hands on.  (as they said in Aliens, "We need to be SURE.")
What they can\'t fry electronically, they\'ll nuke into glass.
    So much for Virus.
    
    There is actually four reasons I can think of for this attitude.  

A: Virus in the Regency is not regarded as a person. In the Imperium of 
old, to be an Imperial Citizen you had to be both sentient and organic.  
The Viral Collapse is very unlikely to have encouraged people to have a 
more chariable view of intelligent machines.

B: Many of the top worlds of the Regency would be killed of or greviously 
wounded if ANY Viral infection came in.  Therefore, you can expect a 
"zero tolerance" attitude from them. (and do you really think that they 
will trust the promises of a Peacemaker strain of Virus?  Wait a few 
centuries, than ask again...)

C: Vengeance.  For the death of the Imperium.  For billions of frozen 
corpses, floating among the ruins.  
 
D: Lack of familiarity with Virus.  The Regency got many, many blessings 
for keeping out Virus, but the lack of contact of Virus insures that 
noone is familiar with it.  Lack of familiaity tends to breed a 
"magicial" view of Virus, as if it was some kind of supernatural evil 
rather than a limited, measureable, and understandable being.  And the 
massive crusade to rebuild the Imperium is certainly going to view Virus 
as evil murderors, to be liquidated without hesitation. (and, 99% of the 
time, they will be right.  It\'s that 1% that bothers me...)

F) Regency/Imperial responses to Coalition propaganda
As soon as the Coalition realises that the Regency exists, you can 
expect a major antiImperial propaganda drive, to hinder Regency/Imperial 
control of the Wilds. (Well, you can\'t really blame the Coalition: they 
would like to remain independent, after all).  They will play up 
antiImperial attitudes previously noted, but protray themselves as "One 
of Our People" protecting their region of the Wilds from those 
bloodthirsty, autocratic, alien Regency Imperials.  They will also stress 
their democratic nature, guessing (correctly, I suspect) that the Regency 
sure isn\'t going to expand the Democratic Reforms to cover low-tech 
barbarians.  Finally, they will have the sympathy of many Virus systems 
since "well-behaved" viral strains will have citizenship rights within 
the Coaition, unlike viral strains within Regency-controlled territory, 
which (I think) will be simply exterminated.
     The RC will have a serious political advantage over the Regency, 
as they KNOW how Wildmen think: for crying out loud, they WERE Wildmen 
until the day before yesterday, when the Hivers contacted them.  It will 
tak ethe Regency decades until they can really understand the perspective 
of the Wilds: they have such a superiority over the Wilds that most 
probably will never even bother to learn, but instead just bribe them or 
shoot them as the situation warrents.

      At a guess, the Regency will relegitimize the Imperium (and, by 
implication, their presence in the Wilds) by the following seven simple 
ideas, repeated over and over:

A: "This part of space is Imperial territory.  While the Imperium ruled, 
there was enough for all, and men enjoyed and used their high-tech 
machines.  When the Imperium was gone, many starved, died, and was 
impoverished.  Moreover, machines ruled over men.  Now, the Imperium is 
back.  Stand with us, and we will restore the way it was."

B: "The Final War/Collapse was started when your ancestors foolishly decided 
to divide the Imperium, and choose to forsake Imperial Values of Honour, 
Reverence and Unity: only we of the Regency maintained the old ways.  
And only we of the Regency kept the gifts of the Imperium, while your 
ancestors brought onto themselves the horrors of the Collapse.  Can\'t 
you see our wealth, our full bellies, and our power?  We extend our 
hands to you, so you can join us and we can again stand as one."
     
C: To TED\'s "The Imperial Nobility still lives, and approves of the way 
you have governed your world in these difficult circumstances.  We would 
like to reward you with more wealth, more technology, and more power.  
Come and take your appointed place within our ranks, and both you and your 
people will attain your true, Imperial destiny."

D: To democracies: "The Regency has learned the lessons of the tragic 
Collapse.  We have fully reformed our government, to give a vastly 
greater voice to the people while diminishing the power of the Nobility 
to a more limited sphere.  By increasing the say of the people without 
bloodshed or wanton destruction, we have proven ourselves fit to lead 
Charted Space.  Join us as we rebuild the broken worlds together." 

E: To nationalists, technophobes, xenophobes: "The Imperium has a proven 
record of leaving individual systems to decide their own fate, and 
control their own rate of development. You may think that you would have 
more freedom apart from the Regency/Imperium, but there are those (looks 
significantly at the RC representative) who would force you to follow 
*their* political agenda, to use robots again, to trust your lives to 
machines again.  Join us, and our fleets will insure that no one will 
force you down any path you don\'t want to follow!" 

F: To everyone within hearing "The RC believes that Virus are people, who 
have rights.  The RC wants you to trust the machines again. The 
RC are barbarians, who hurdle from the sky to steal what they want. 
Th RC obviously has learned nothing from either the Final War or the 
Collapse.  Side with us, and we will protect you from such madmen!"

G: To the hardcases: "This is not some petty pocket empire you\'re talking 
to, but the Regency, the sole heir of the Imperium.  A nation with  
*real* fleets, and *real* marines.  Are you sure you want to mess with us?  
Cause if these ruins haven\'t taught you what Imperial Force can do, I 
have some friends who would be glad to give ignorant, ground-dwelling 
barbarians like you a repeat lesson!"  

[Note: the epthiet "groung-dwelling" refers to the lack of anti-grav tech 
and space travel in most Wild cultures.]

G) To The Future: The revived Third Imperium,  c. 1500.
If an Imperial went into a low berth on Mora in 1110 Imperial, and came 
out 390 years later, he would have a few surprises waiting for him.  
Technology behind the Claw would have increased substantually: the 
\'standard\' TL is 17, with a few TL 18 systems.  He would be astounded by 
the psions walking freely around him, and just as astounded by the lack 
of robots or automations of any kind, they having been replaced by 
genetically tailored animals or specially-bred people.

He would be even more astounded to learn that he\'s standing on the 
capital of the Third Imperium. That this Imperium is currently fighting 
it\'s third major war against a human/AI empire, far to rimward, calling 
itself the Aubaine Republic.  That the area where they\'re fighting, 
Massilia sector, is considered profoundly primitive compared to the 
Marches (which was a psion-infested backwater when our Imperial want for 
his long nap). That the Republic is based in the Old Expanses, which was 
another backwater back in 1110.  That the Republic\'s major allies are 
Hivers, a people who our Imperial *knows* are cowards, and would never 
side against the Imperium on any issue.

He would learn that the current Third Imperium is basicaly divided into 
A: The Domain of Deneb and B: The Imperial Protectorates, ruled from the 
Domain.  That Deneb has democratic priveleges, but the Protectorates are 
ruled directly by the nobility.  That there are massive wealth and 
technology differences between the Domain and the Protectorates, to the 
extent that they can only be barely considered part of the same empire.
That while the culture of the Protectorates do resemble the classic Third 
Imperium culture (just at a lower average tech level, and with a harder 
edge), Domain culture resembles some ghastly, mindreading nightmare mix 
of Zhodani and Imperial cultures, which deeply fightens our timelost 
Imperial.  That even the xboat network has been replaced with a chain of 
telepathic psions (gasp!). 

Some things about the Domain will be quite fascinating.  That half of the 
population has been alive for over three centuries, since the \'death gene\' 
has finally been fixed (no more need for anagathics).  That there are 
worlds with over 7 TRILLION people on them: the famous, fictional world 
of Trantor, totally covered over with cities and buildings, is a 
reality.  Fundamentally, the psionics and high-grade survellance 
technology will finally drive our Imperial out of Mora, and into the 
Protectorates.

I strongly suspect that the people of the Protectorates will resent being 
ruled by psionic-loving, high-tech people who now, with their bioshaped 
bodies and organic machines, seem more alien than human.  But I don\'t 
believe that they will feel that the human/AI Aubaine Republic is any better.
It will be interesting if they can find a viable alternative to either 
turning your tools into living beings or turning living beings into tools.

Appendix I: Why the Reformation Coalition will survive contact with the 
Regency.

A few month\'s ago, I ridiculed the idea that the RC will outlast contact 
contact with the Regency, since even a ho-humm, TL E frontier BatRon 
could stomp out not only the RC, but possibly anything in the Old Expanses.

Well, no.  First, I overlooked the fact that Vras (now Aubaine) was TL F 
preCollapse.  That - with the fact that the RC has been successfuly 
maintaining quite an amount of TL F equipment - means that the RC has 
a good grasp of TL F technology, and that their current TL of 12 is 
strictly temporary.  By 1230, they should have made their first TL F 
warships, new from the ground up.

But how will they get the high-tech vampire warships they need to fend off 
the Regency in the meantime?  

Simple. Infect them with a friendly Virus.

Using the same method, the vampire fleefs can be convered into RC fleets, 
giving them quite a bit of muscle to face the Regency with.  Add in the 
factr that Infected warships (with a peasemaker strain) operate at TL 16, 
and the RC (later, Aubaine Republic) Navy have some real toys to play with.

Now (actually, from say 1220) , if that TL E BarRon squadron from the 
Regency arrives over Aubaine, it\'ll be lucky to get out alive.

Appendix II: Territory

At a very iffy guess, I\'d say that Charted Space should be divided as 
follows, by c.1350

Domain of Deneb (Imperial): Spinward Marches
                            Deneb
                            Corridor
                            Provence
                            Trojan Reach
                            Reft
[Note: there\'s lot\'s of room for growth: if the Regency decides to 
incorporate a good chunk of the Vargr extents or the Aslan Hierate, 
there\'s precious little to stop them, excluding the cost of doing so AND 
rebuilding the Imperium at the same time.]

The Colonial Frontier
                            The Windhorn
                            Meshan
                            Mendan
                            Amdukan
                            The Empty Quarter
[Note: if I was the Strategic Advisor to the Emperor/Regent, I\'d 
recommend (as soon as we discover that the RC is the major government in 
the Wilds) that we don\'t waste trillions fighting a war with the RC, but 
send over the diplomats, make a firm border, and focus expansion 
coreward.  And I bet that the political mirage of rebuilding the 
Regina-to-Terra Imperium will make my idea moot.  Personal loathing of 
the antiImperial RC may have something to do with it, too.]

The Settled Zone        
                            Vland
                            Lishun
                            Antares
                            Gushemege
                            Dagudashaag 
                            Core
[These sectors will have a mix of xenophobic, low-tech worlds; 
Regency-settled, high-tech worlds; and "working-class" mid-tech worlds 
(TL B to D, say). This area would be most prone to desire seperation from 
the Denebi, who now more resemble the Zhos than the old Imperials.]

Contested with the Aubaine Republic
                            Zarushager
                            Massilia
                            Delphi
[A fun, fun area to work in.  More adventure than you bargained for.  
Occasional border war: local flare-ups between the Imperial and Aubaine 
Navy is so common that they don\'t even rate a message to Mora.]

Aubaine Republic            Daibei
                            Daispora
                            Old Expanses
                            Solomani Rim
                            Alpha Crucis
[And expanding rimward all the time...]

Wilds + Pocket Empires      Fornast
                            Verge
                            Illeish
                            Ley
[Most of this area will still be in the process of being reincorporated 
into the Third Imperium.]

I\'m playing with the idea to start a SF PBEM roleplaying game. It would
have a background similar to classic traveller so I hope you don\'t mind
that I post this announcement here. There might be drawback for most of you
because I would refee the game in (my native) German language. However,
it\'s perfectly okay if you use English to send your turns/descriptions and
use this language to communicate. I would love to have an international
flair in this game :-) You only have to be able to understand (basic)
German.

The game, so is my basic idea, will be about the establishment of a
colony on the world "Jovoo" which is an abandoned world in the so called
border sector. This sector is a neutral zone since the last great war
with the Estadh of Bezidhar (another spacefaring power) 100 years ago.
The peace treaty between Imperium and Bezidhar declared this part of
the galaxy as neutral no-man\'s-land. Now the border sector is reopened
and it will be the players job to establish a new colony at jovoo.

Technology will be roughly like Traveller. Common personal weapons are
modern projectile weapons, lasers are bulky and costly. Body armor 
is available but not very effective and the best protection is still
not to get hit. Grav technology is common at high tech levels and
modern ground combat is done with grav tanks supported by heavy armored
troops. Medicine is advanced but neither cyberware nor braintapes are
possible. Cloning is possible but prohibit@n the Imperium. At ship
level lasers and force shield become usual. Starship travel is shorter
than in Traveller and I\'ll use a 3D universe. Though it\'s unrealistic,
in-system travel works with reactionless drives. There\'s no hyperspace
communication. A handful mostly human-like races (Imperials, Bezidhar, 
Djodani, Ayleans, Wargr, ...) will populate the known universe. Political
structures are of great variety (one of the secrets of success of the
Imperium), the Imperiums tries to keep the peace and let the worlds 
do what they want. 

I would like to put the emphasize not on large scale colonisation but
on the small (and sometimes larger) problems that will arise. Possible
character occupations might be in command/administration, exploration,
security, transport/engineering, science or "important" colonist.

If there\'s enough interest, I\'ll start about October. By then I\'ll
have written more about my rules, the background, its history and
technology. I have still to make some decission about the exact
setting.

If you are interested (no binding, no costs, completly free :-)
please send me a short reply. Thanks.

I could see Adama ordering "Launch all Vipers!" while reading this. Anyway,
the _Battlestar Galatica_ had those big box things on the sides. Fighters
were recovered in the same manner as wet navy carriers: Fly up from behind,
snag something on the recovery deck and come to a stop. If you automate
a lot of this, you don\'t need all those deck crew in vacc suits running
around. I seem to recall another version in _Buck Rogers_ where fighter
recovered in a central located recovery bay in the aft section. I don\'t
see that recovery would be all that difficult, it\'s seems to be essentially
a docking manuever. Match attitude and vectors and you\'re recovered. Landing
on a floating carrier moving at a fraction of your speed, fighting gravity,
wind, weather, the sea, this seems to be an almost impossible task in
comparision.

Well, I still think that it would be interesting, but it really depends on 
how the local\'s will react to psionic personnel.  Can the Regency Mental 
Health Corps work covertly, without provoking a harsh anti-psion 
reaction?  I doubt it: but even Regency psions should still remember how 
to mount covert operations like this?

Maybe... tech-for-psi trades are certainly worth pursuing.

Currently, it seems that Regency/Zho borders are tightly controlled, 
though without the Cold War attitudes of yesteryear.  I expect them to 
start loosening, however: the Zho\'s ARE the dominant human culture in 
existance right now, and the Regency is the inferior partner until they 
can properly shape up old Imperial space again, which will take quite a 
bit of time and money....

The Zho\'s would be DEFINITELY interested in any major psi research the 
Regency takes on.  How would all this Regency/Zho psionic interaction 
would fall out is worth a sourcebook in itself.

Hell, I don\'t know!  I\'m just operating on the assumption that the Zho\'s 
are a smart, but static culture.  They created a workable system of 
psionic government that works for them, are quite stable and secure, and 
still have some drive left in them (those Core Expeditions, you know).

An Ancient, psionic China/Egypt is the \'lens\' I tend to view them with.

> Undetectable Psions? Time to re-read Dune books and Phil K. Dick ;-)
> Psionic machines like the ALREADY PRODUCED psionic shield helmets?

Well, no.  I was thinking more along the \'fear robots\' in the Uplift War.
(Blast, forgot the arthur\'s name!  David Birn, I guess...)

You know, in the book, they radiate a \'sphere of fear\' that inhibit\'s 
trespassers.

On the subject, apparently the Imperium actualy created a psionic 
computer, shown in Smash and Grab. What did it do?

Moreover, what stuff would you want a psionic computer to do?  Well, Lie 
detection sound\'s great, but I think that the Imperium actually made a TL 
F robot that was a perfect lie dectector, using only physical, 
non-psionic information. (There was some controversy as to whether this 
robot should be allowed to be used in trials and suchlike.)
  
Hmmm, what else?  If the energy used in psionic telekensis, matter 
manipulation, and teleportation is less costly than using ho-hum,  
non-psionic methods, things can get very interesting ("Indistinguisable 
from magic" indeed!)  Seeing that Traveller is only vaguely hard-SF right 
now, perhaps we shouldn\'t push it over the edge into fantasy land.

But we may have to, if instead of developing psionic robots (HIGHLY 
unlikely in the current enviroment), the Regency develop psionic animals 
instead for use in industry...

(Last time I heard, psionics != intelligence)

This, I suspect, is the worst strike against them.  The same patterns of 
thought, and the same responses to problems would be ingrained inth their 
way of thinking. (Ie: the Chinese quite deliberately retarded their 
technological development during the Manchu (?) Dynasty.  And Egyptian 
society stayed WAYYYYY too long in the stone age, with an intellectual 
world that took one rigid form and stayed there for millennia)

Actually, I should stress this more than I did.  It seems extremely 
important to me that the Zho\'s didn\'t close off technological development 
as a possible threat to their authority, but instead learned to use it 
and make it a complement to their psionic civilization.  This implies an 
intelligency and broadmindedness that the Imperials (and ex-Imperials) 
would do well to imitate.

Them Zhos ain\'t stupid, even if they haven\'t thought of anything new in 
c.2000 years.... (which isn\'t true: some development had to occur in 
order for them to create a successful response to Third Imperium 
expansionism)

One megacorp (whatitsname again? It was in Citizens of the Imperium) was 
developing psi-boosters in the Marches, pre-Fifth Frontier War (c. 1100 ?) 

You\'re quite correct: the Zho\'s top TL ts 15, the Regency\'s 16.  But the 
Zho\'s have been doing psi-boosters for thousands of years, longer than 
the Imperium even existed!  I\'d put Zho psibooster tech at 15, but 
Regency booster-tech at, maybe 12?

For the reason noted in the previous paragraph, you\'re right on.  And I\'d 
like to see the bill the Zho\'s will charge for this psionic technology...

Sorry, on this one point I\'ve got to disagree with you.  Yes, they are 
flexible enough to at least respond to the Imperials correctly, basically 
intimidating them and holding them off until they rip themselves apart.  

My real obsession is with the psion/non-psion class differences 
within the Consulate, and the consequenses of the Regency developing a 
method of creating / making availabel psionic talents in previously 
non-talented folk. What\'s the possibility of this?  Fairly high: the 
Regency crew have a serious desire to \'spread the wealth\' around, while 
the Zho\'s had the opposite goal.

It\'s this point that I\'m trying to get at.  If there is no method of 
artifically creating and manipulating psionics, the Regency has lost it\'s 
independenct and culture, and should learn to become a good, reliable 
Zhodani ally.  If there is a method, the Regency will tend to be the 
first to discover and popularize it: this could bring down the Consulate 
very nicely.  Their cultural rigidity, their dependence on a single, 
small group of (largely) psionic nobles, is both their greatest strength 
(making internal rebellion impossible) and their greatest weakness.

While reading *Arrival Veangance*, I noticed that the letter from the 
Office of the Archduke came from "Giyachi, Mora, Spinward Marches."  Thus 
apparently making Giyachi the capital of the Doamin of Deneb, and 
probably the Regency.

My question: what was the capital city of the Third Imperium?

Anyone?

In real world we don\'t have grav focused lasers. Thus useful range is 
limited to a few thousand kilometers. And we may neither see crafts move at 
several gees. We would probably never see a laser that would be able to 
punch through armor effectively, as the power requirements are large. Thus I 
believe missiles will be used in real life, but at a few 100 kilometers.

Lets say I have a laser turret with 3 focus dishes with each about 1 meter 
in diameter. Each dish has 800 shots in 30 minutes. With this I could easily 
change target at least 3 times during a 30 minute round, and realistically 
even more. When targetting is just a matter of x and y axis this would be 
easy for the system. And several batteries of these things would stop a lot 
of missiles. Of course you need jammers, decoys and the famed kitchen sink 
:) to complete the missile defense shield.

The problem with missiles is that they travel in a straight line towards the 
target which are predictable. And the target just sees a dot that comes 
straight at them. If space had some sort of a horizon, the target would be 
in serious trouble. And other crafts in the formation (if there are any) can 
also help the target defending it self. Thats why fleets got escort with AAW 
capability. their sole purpose is to kill missiles before they reach the 
capital ships of the task force. 

And for a missile swarm to work, the rules must allow a launcher that can 
launch more than 1 missile a round. You need something like 1 missile every 
10 seconds. Or 180 missiles in 30 minutes. And still the swarm will be 
stretched out, unless you got multiple launchers.

So Merrick weighs the same as a cat?

OK, you probably meant 60 kg, but I couldn\'t resist!


As to volume, I read somewhere (years ago) that the average human took up
about 2 cubic feet (if mashed do so there was no air pockets).  Assuming a
density of 1.0, this is 54 kg mass, so that\'s about right.

What follows is a very basic experiment in long-distance settlement, 
basically trying to estimate the cost of doing such a thing.   Comments 
welcome.  


Assumed: the Regency will colonize the Wilds (well, at least Corridor and 
Vland, possibly a lot more) in order to
  - solidify it\'s claim as the true successor to the Third Imperium, by 
holding it\'s territory
  - to provide a economic outlet for the Regency economy to utilize
  - (possibly) to relieve population pressure in Deneb sector (in the 
Guatney sector maps, the area is PACKED!)

Goals: we want to carry 1 million settlers and 3.5 million disp tons of 
       equipment to a site 120 parsecs from our staging area (a place like 
       Deneb or Antra, on the edge of the training Regency borders) to a 
       site 120 parsecs into exImperial territory.  (enough to go 
       roughly 10 parsecs into Antares, Core or Gusgemege sectors)

Additional information: 
    *  This operation will be spread out over a 7290 day period. 
       (Roughly 20 years)
    *  We will use jump2 Frontier Freighters as detailed in World Tamers 
       Handbook, stuffing their holds with either 712 disp tons of cargo or 
       with enough low berths to hold 712 people.
    *  We want to send out a settler convoy every 30 days

Financial notes: 
    *  To fill the cargo bays with low berths costs 35.6 MCr
    *  To fill the cargo bays with freight costs 2.848 MCr, at 4000 Cr/ton 
    *  A ship costs 520.24 MCr

Travel notes: 
    *  We spend 1 week in jump space, and 1 day refuelling.
       (I\'m assuming that the route has already been charted by Regency 
       Scouts, or RQS ships.) 
    *  It will take 480 days to get from the staging area to the 
       settlement area, and another 480 days heading home.
    *  Assume that after the ships return home, we need to wait 30 days
       until we can send them out again.
    *  We must wait 990 days before we can start to reuse returning  
       ships, instead of sending out new ships.
 
Convoy breakdown:
    *  Each convoy carrys 4115 poeple and 14403 tons of cargo.
    *  Each convoy has 6 (actually 5.78) "Low Berth" ships and 20 
       (actually 20.23) "cargo" ships
    *  We need 858 Frontier Freighters (198 "Low Berth", 660 "Cargo") 
       ships before we can start reusing returning ships.  Cost: 
       446,365.92 MCr.
    *  Add 7048.8 MCr to outfit the "Low Berth" ships, and 140 000 MCr to 
       pay for cargo.
    *  Total \'bone basic\' cost: 593, 414.72 MCr.

Not included: bases, starmercs, crew, lost ships, and a lot of non-core 
costs (\'non-core\', but can get real hefty real fast)

Therefore: for the price of a Trillion credit squadron, you can launch 
about 2 of these expeditions.

Aside: at a guess, 100 Regency citizens can afford to launch a private 
settlement expedition of this nature, using strictly income for one year 
to pay for it.

* * * * * * * *

Oh yes, and the Regency may choose to transport embryos, rather than 
people.  This involves lots of groundwork done previously, but may be 
much more efficent in the long run. 

* * * * * * * * 

And who would the Regency get to settle in the Wilds? (Excluding the unborn)
Well,first, who wouldn\'t want to settle in the Wilds?

A: Comfortable people (ruling out the population on high-tech worlds, 
possibly anything over TL C)

B: Those who have an irrational, absolute fear of Virus and renegade 
machinery

C: People who feel that the future\'s *here*, in the Regency, not *there*, 
in the corpse of the Imperium.

D: People who have a deep attachment to family: if the family\'s staying, 
so are they.  IF they leave, therre unlikely to see their family or old 
friends ever again.

E: People who would rather settle on half-a-loaf now than risk their necks 
for a full loaf later.

OK, now who are those crazys who *would* resettle in the Wilds?

A: Those who loved the old Imperium - both remmaints and patriots - would 
head to the Wilds to rebuild her again.

B: Poor people, trapped on overcrowded worlds with no economic future 
(Borlund, anyone?) would head out in droves

C: Vilani patriots would vounteer to head for Vland Sector - and Vland 
itself - to rebuild Vland civilization

D: The oddballs of Regency society would head out.

E: A LOT of reactionaries - both Noble and anti-psionic versions - would 
leave.

F: The usual semi-criminals, fortune-hunters and con men

G: The Regency may encourage military men to retire in the Wilds, using 
grants, etc.

H: The Regency may ecourage valuable scientists and technicians to head 
for the Wilds by cutting them deals for a percentage of a colony\'s 
profits, interest free loans, etc.

I: The Regency may encourage "people of substance" to settle in the 
Blasted Zone by sweetheart deals, granting noble titles (with old-style 
noble powers), etc.

Regarding  the real life vs. traveller:

For the point of this thread, grav focusing is the reality in question
(just so we don\'t get off the beaten track of stuff useful to others on
the TML----though I find reality interesting as well, personally).

Four points:

1.  They don\'t *have* to travel in a straight line, they could have some
evasive ability (which for game purposes would make them easier to dodge
since they\'d be wasting gturns).

2.  There is a horizon of sorts:  the sensor detection horizon.  If the
missiles in question are coasting to the target, they are quiet and
small.  If we can make an aircraft with the radar cross section of a
smallish ball bearing, TL15 stealth must be decent (they have off the
shelf control of all forces at that point).  If the sensor is active,
then the target has a neon bulls eye on it for the MG that\'s sitting
undetected near that gas giant over there waiting for a fire control
lock :-)
 
3.  The "dot" target is still a target.  That means you have to design a
defense for it.  If KKMs don\'t exist, then ships won\'t be designed to
shoot them down.  If your ship can\'t shoot them down because all the
high TL cultures know that KKMs are too easy to kill, then my TL 10 KKMs
will cook your fleet.  I prefer to write the rules for their use such
that they can be defeated in a reasonable way, then they are an isssue
(albiet an easy one) to deal with.

4.  My question, however wasn\'t answered (maybe I wasn\'t clear):  Why is
a missile that is easy to shoot at inside 15,000km (as you say above)
easy to kill, when if the scales were smaller it wouldn\'t be?  Lets say
the scale is 1000km/hex and 1 minute turns.  A missile appears 10 hexes
away at the begining of the turn and will hit you this turn. You got to
shoot at it once last turn and missed. Now because it passed some
distance threshold (otherwise you\'d hit everything 800 times) you get to
shoot at it a bunch and kill it.  You get 26 shots (800shots/1800
seconds).  What if there are 26 missiles?  will all your shots hit?
What if they are coming from different directions, now the laser has to
slew back and forth a lot, and you have only 2 seconds a target.  I
think it\'d be easy to saturate.  And it\'s the same problem, I just
changed the scale.  Scale doesn\'t matter since you still have less than
a minute to deal with your problem.

They can already.  A missile launcher can launch like 5 per turn with an
auto loader.  A missile bay would hold, and control about 36 missiles
(at TL15) (oh, and that\'s just a 50ton bay).  A capital ship would have
*hundreds* of 50 ton missile bays.  Some launched at you might be KKMs,
some are det lasers.  Unfortunately you don\'t know which is which.

If you assume that everyone knows that KKMs won\'t work you forget about
TLs that haven\'t figured it out yet----and will a TL10 ship be able to
stop a TL15 KKM, with TL15 stealth vs. TL10 sensors?

Hey, regarding missiles being mixed (re:my last post), there\'s a nifty
idea.  You shoot 10,000 missiles at a BB (from, say, your Tigress BB).
Some 90% of them are cheap KKMs (1/25th the price of the detlasers).
The target has some finite number of missiles it can deal with in the
turn, so when the first opportunity to shoot at the arises, it\'ll shot
at some, the KKMs will continue past this point to be fired on again,
and again, but right now you don\'t know KKMs from det lasers.

So even as decoys they\'re nasty (and if you ignore them, you get
fried).

The detlasers will get through (well, some would anyway, but *more*
will).  And you still have to "waste" you defensive fire, \'cause one KKM
(at a decent closing velocity) can wreak your ship (although ESA works
pretty good here).

	I\'m working on an idea for a TL-6 reuseable shuttle, and would
appreciate any input or suggestions...
	The design isn\'t finalized yet, but the preliminary calculations 
show that using a combination of turbofan, ramjet and LF rocket, and allowing
airborne refueling combined with drop tanks, it is possible to get about
0.64 G-hours of thrust from a design that nominally can carry 15 metric tons
into LEO. This is, according to FF&S (realistic thrusters, p. 71) enough to
reach orbit. However, I recall an article being published some years ago in
Challenge ( An article I would love to get a copy of, anyone? It was called
\'One Small Step\', I think) which gave a much more precise set of rules for 
determining orbital req\'s.
	The design is not unlike the old DynaSoar idea, and ends up being
something of a combination of the X-15 and SR-71. It turns out that there
is enough mass left over to use a STOL hypersonic airframe - which means 
that if you have a runway long enough for the aerial tanker, you\'re set to
get into orbit. Certainly a useful little thing for all those barely spacefaring worlds out there in the wilds. 
	And now the problems; 1) Drop tanks. In order to get off the ground 
using a rather small turbofan, the plane takes off with only enough fuel for 
30 min on the turbofan, carrying empty drop tanks with a capacity of 45 tons.
(I\'ve had to bend the rule about a maximum weight in outboard sres of 35%)
2) Airborne refueling. The refueling has to take place above 800 kph, since 
the ramjet has to kick in as the plane gets heavier. ( current USAF ops are 
done at a somewhat slower speed, I imagine? 
3) The turbofan is used to augment thrust for the first 33% of the post-refueling burn. My argument is that this is the initial climb to high altitude ( 60-70
000 feet) Again, anyone who knows if this is a valid assumption, please let me
know.. 

Anyway, what do you think? Should I set up shop, or is it time to go back
to the old drawing board?

On another set of topics; Having just bought FF&S yesterday, I sat down 
and played with the very extensive rules for making guns.. not my normal 
area of interest, but certainly useful. I managed to make a 12L70 ETC 
Autocannon with a preposterous 25 Mj muzzle energy. using M1A2-style APFSDSDU
rounds the penetration is a silly 307 at medium range (1500m) Either there
is something I\'ve missed, or the rule on page 109 of FF&S about multplying
muzzle energy by 2.5 for all ETC weapons is excessive. Oh, a typo above, 
that should be a 120L70, i.e. 12cm bore. If not, with a gun like this, why 
bother with messy expensive stuff like meson guns?

Finally, in making high-tech warships, can one use fuel tankage as additional
protection, or at the very least leave the fuel tanks less heavily armored than
the rest of the ship? THis would save considerable amounts of mass, and
it\'s just LHyd or even water, anyway. And if it was water (a very good form
of reaction mass) why not store it as ice? This would be a natural heat-sink,
reducing laser effectiveness, and an excellent radiation shield. 

I hope these ideas are inspirational, and if you have any input, please let
me know...

    'body' => '  I\'m enjoying the discussion on the future of the Regency and all that - 
good ideas, Alvin and others.  I\'d just like to add a few things to 
the pot:

1) Selling the Imperium to the Natives

  "You know, I hate to point this out, but it sure looks to me like a
certain interstellar government is a tool of a certain race which shall
remain nameless but has six limbs and is real sneaky (no, not the K\'Kree -
I said sneaky).  If you enjoy being the tool of nameless conspiracies that
you\'ll never understand, by all means, make agreements with others.  On
the other hand, we Imperials allow you to determine your own destiny
democratically." 

  Hey, why not appeal to racial prejudice?  If psionics has a bad rep, 
Hivers must have one equally so.  I for one never like Hivers, and I 
doubt most RC citizens really trust them, despite their assistance.  Now, 
once the Imperium "finds" the evidence that the Hivers set off the 
Rebellion and the Virus as part of a really large-scale manipulation, 
well, Katy bar the door.


2) The RC and the "Good" Virus

  I have a hard time buying the whole "I love you, you love me, we\'re a
happy Virus family" trend in the RC.  The initial source material made it
seem that folks hated Virus with a passion.  Frankly, I\'d be more
prejudiced against Virus if I was an RC citizen, having had ancestors and
family members die or seen Virus enslavement first hand, than if I was a
Regency citizen on Deneb, for whom the whole thing is rather abstract,
really.  "The only good Virus is an erased Virus" sounds like the RC 
party line to me, for sure.

  On the other hand, if the whole thing suits the Hiver\'s purposes (and 
it does), the RC will team up with Virus.  The Hivers get the RC as a 
client state to protect them from those naughty Imperials, who are no 
doubt even now building psionic machines that can read even a Hiver\'s mind...


3) Grandfather

  This to me has always been the most problematic part of Traveller, and 
I\'m not alone - don\'t have my files here in Iowa with me, but I remember 
a GDW response to questions about the Black Curtain being answered along 
the lines of "We screwed up when we gave too much deatil about the Ancients 
and we\'re not making that mistake again."  Who knows what Grandfather 
will do?  Frankly, I hope GDW just keeps him hidden.

  For those who might be interested, I have my own personal spin on 
Grandfather and his behavior.  From my point of view, Grandfather\'s 
explanation of his origins and the final war just don\'t ring true.  In my 
universe, Grandfather is not a Droyne, but a very sophisticated droynoid 
(a Droyne android, of course).  This explains his lack of ageing and 
super-droyne intelligence.  He was put in this part of the galaxy by 
the Primordials (no, not the Digest Group\'s "Honeybuns From Space," thanks 
for asking) as an anthopologist/observer to watch the development of the 
Doyne race over a long time span (hundreds of thousands of years).  Well, 
Grandfather malfuctioned, or maybe he just got bored, so he upped the 
Doyne tech level, and, well, things got a little out of hand. 

  So, why did Grandfather kill off all the kids and hide in his pocket
universe?  Simple, really - he found out who the Primordials are, and that
they\'re coming back.  The war against his Children was just a way of
cleaning things up before his parents got home.  He\'s hoping he\'ll be
overlooked when they get back and that if they do find him, if they have a
chance to look around beforehand, they\'ll see he tried to put things back
the way they were and forgive him. 

  Who are the Primordials?  Well, I have a rather Humaniti-centered 
outlook, so they are - surprise, surprise - humans.  Very odd, very high 
tech, but very, very human.  They\'ll stop by for a bit, chat, and move on 
- how much time would you want to spend with your ancestors from 200,000 
years?  Thought it would be fun for laughs, especially when Grandfather 
gets his, and it does make things a bit more logical.

Reality-check time: for comparison, someone want to look up the performance
of the U.S. Navy\'s CIWS (Close-In Weapon System), aka Mk 15 Phalanx? It
is an autonomous point-defense system that has a very, very high kill rate 
(much higher than the 95% the TNE rules limit you to...) and
is capable of tracking a great many targets (someone look up how many) very
quickly. ONE (1) missile is breakfast food to CIWS!  And this is at many
factors
closer range and shorter response time than the space combat you say "would
tax the defensive capabilities of the target"  
And that\'s at TL8, right now, Real World.  It\'s one of the things that 
defends U.S. carriers from junk like Exocet missiles...

Cool.  I didn\'t know US carrier task forces were immune to attack, that
makes me feel much better about their deployment in dangerous areas.
;-)

If the real world acted like the space combat rules in BL, then we could
un-install these devices having developed them and still be protected.
No one who considered fighting us ever made anti-shipping missiles after
the CIWS I assume, since it would be pointless.

I said tax the defensive systems, not overcome (although that is
possible).  And the point about defensive systems I was trying to make
is that they have to exist!  I know you\'re not arguing that if no ships
carry such equipment they\'ll still be immune to attack.  

But GDW seems to think so since even an empty hulk in a stable orbit can 
defeat an infinite number of attacking missiles (so long as they cooperate 
and don\'t detonate as nuke pumped xray lasers).

Regarding the 95% max %, remember that that is _per attack_.  By making
multiple attacks possible, you can get that higher (so long as you don\'t
saturate the system).  The major difference I see is that a CIWS system
on a traveller BB has problems that don\'t exist in real life right now.

More targets.  A lot more.  A typical BB would launch thousands of
missiles at once, and they\'d arrive within seconds of each other.

The solution?  Hundreds of CIWS!  

New problem:  they all have to talk to each other to coordinate attack.
Autonomous systems are fine in a zone defense, but if you have more than
one defending an area they have to share information. Otherwise they might 
all decide the second missile to the left is *the* major threat, and shoot 
first.  They just wasted 299 out of 300 shots that time unit.  Even in 
traveller at TL 15 the CIWS on either end of the ship can only communicate 
at c.  Commo lag between these remote systems will drag the whole thing down 
a few notches.  A buddy of mine at the lab was working on just such a problem 
for SDIO.  He told me over a beer that you could "give him 100 phasers" and 
they\'d have trouble killing the missiles.  To the point he thought the killing 
was easy, and the fire control was an unsolvable nightmare (this was 
space-based in part) due to commo lag.

We have weapons (lasers) which serve this as well as anti-shipping
roles, and we could even have them attack 800 targets if they\'re beefed
up----although this might make us wonder why we can\'t shoot this way at
other targets.  Post virus ships won\'t be good at coordinating defense vs. many
missiles, but for many uses, KKMs won\'t make it through.  My only point
through this is to make the missiles, then install the stuff to trash
\'em.  This takes volume away from other weapons and fuel.  Balance
returns.  That was the point, fix the rules so those exceptions (like
Free Traders) might have to think about it.  Right now any traveller
ship with a laser has a perfect CIWS.  One scout hovering over a TL8
battlefield could shoot all the arty down and miss nothing----there\'s
balance for you ;-)

I\'d like any info anyone has on CIWS systems (the russians have one, and
I remember one called "Goalkeeper" as well).  Of course these systems
all rely on high ROFs (about 6 times the best directed energy weapon in
traveller) to kill.

Personally, I think that coordination combined with slewing the laser
will be the major problems (what if the missiles come from a multitude
of closing angles?).  And they will still be dispersing submunitions at
very long ranges by autogun standards (100s to around 1000km).

The missiles can exist (they exist now), so the rules fix/clarification
needs to be on the defenses.

Cynthia posted some useful notes on this a while back (including her
fixes to the screwed up FFS bits).  If you can\'t find \'em, let me know
(I\'m sure I saved them someplace) and I\'ll send them to you.

As an example of their screw up, check out the figures on delta v to
orbit for a terra sized world.  1.28 gturns to orbit is more than escape
velocity for the earth (by a ways)----even assuming that you circularize
the orbit after achieving it that is way too high.  A typical delta v
budget for LEO is a little over 8km/s.  To the moon\'s surface, it\'s
almost 14km/s, and Mars is between 16 and 17 km/s.

Sure, if it doesn\'t say you can\'t :-)  There will have to be surface
features so , you\'ll get blinded first, but then again, you would
anyway.  You can armor the weapons to protect them better.  If you play
BL a few times you\'ll find out just how many fuel hits you get ( a lot).
You\'d have to fudge the internal damage tables so all hits go to fuel
first.

Yes, I got mine at the weekend. Try phoning Leisure Games in Finchley on

If you have a credit card, you can have them set up a subscription where

Alternatively, your local stockist should have it real soon now.

The settlement maps in Supplement 11 and the Traveller Adventure have

     As is indicated by the 1206 comments of RQS Commodore Roland Zumetaxis 
     at the end of Vampire Fleets.  No, the RCES/Regency meeting will not 
     be pleasant.
     
     >>Many of the top worlds of the Regency would be killed of or 
     greviously wounded if ANY Viral infection came in.  Therefore, you can 
     expect a "zero tolerance" attitude from them. (and do you really think 
     that they will trust the promises of a Peacemaker strain of Virus?  
     Wait a few centuries, than ask again...) <<
     
     I would expect that the Regency will take an exterminator\'s stance 
     toward Virus, Peacemaker or no.  After all, what\'s to stop a 
     Puppeteer, God or Mother Virus Strain from _pretending_ to be a 
     Peacemaker until it gets good and entrenched in it\'s "ally\'s" computer 
     systems and then -- WHAMMO!  Instant holocaust.
     
     There is no physical way to recognize what type of Virus strain you\'re 
     dealing with.  What it "claims" to be is really irrelevant, unless the 
     RCs develop a way to recognize the unique electromagnetic emanations 
     that come from Peacemaker strains or something.  Even then, the rapid 
     and constant evolution of Virus would eventually allow the more 
     hostile strains to imitate these emanations.
     
     I\'m currently running a Regency mercenary campaign, but I\'m troubled 
     with the idea of running a campaign in which the goal is to perform 
     the genocide of Virus when some Viral strains are now non-belligerant. 
     But how can one distinguish a hostile from a non-hostile?  Until 
     there\'s a definite way, it\'s foolish to trust Virus and I\'d have to 
     side with the Regency that Virus needs to be contained or destroyed.

     >>To democracies: "The Regency has learned the lessons of the tragic

     people without bloodshed or wanton destruction, we have proven 
     ourselves fit to lead Charted Space.  Join us as we rebuild the broken 
     worlds together."<<
     
     Right.  Let\'s not forget that the Regency itself has become much more 
     democratic.  Reread the stuff in the main rule book on the Regency and 
     you\'ll see that because of the much smaller area of space the Regency 
     now controls, the need for a strong nobility has decreased.  While 
     nobles continue to exist and hold their vast riches, government has 
     largely fallen to the common man and the electorate.  The Regency is 
     also democratic now, but in a different way than the RCES.  And let\'s 
     not forget Oriflamme.  The Regency may have a friend in the RCES and 
     the revolution-minded Aubani may have a wolf in sheep\'s clothing as an 
     ally.

I see this as being *much* slower than wet carriers (by at least an order
of magnitude). Space carriers also carry more fighters. Retrieval time is
therefore going to be a lot longer.

Airlocks = slower, more expensive, and more to go wrong.

They\'re more manoeuvrable, faster, harder to hit, and more flexible than
bigger craft.

 Key word here is ONE.  The CIWS system goes through ammo like I go through
 Pepsi.  It is a last ditch, brown streak in your pants, attempt to defeat
 a missile.  If you\'re down to your Phalanx system,  things are not good.

 It can track lots of targets,  but it cannot engage more than one at a
 time.  If multiple missiles are coming in on slightly different bearings,
 the system then has to traverse to engage the missiles.  As the ranges
 involved shorten,  this can cause the system to fail.  boom.

 It also has to be unmasked before it can even start shooting the target.
 What was the name of the ship in the gulf that took a single exocet in
 the hull because the Phalanx was masked?  The Phalanx would have made
 short work of the missile,  but it wasn\'t able to engage.  

 In space, a lot of these problems are easier to solve,  but they don\'t
 by any means go away.  The speeds involved are way up, lowering tracking
 and traverse response times.  You still have to detect the missile,
 then you have to hit.  A laser cycling at 800 shots/ 30 min. (~1 shot 
 every 2.2 secs) is going to have problems engaging large numbers of 
 KKM\'s.  If you assume that each missile is automatically tracked,
 and each missile is automatically hit,  all you need to do is fire
 801 missiles. 

 One added note:  at the high speeds hitting the missile isn\'t going to
 be enough.  You\'d have to /vaporize/ it.  The debris left by the missile
 is just as deadly as the missile itself.  Since these missiles would be
 basically a chunk of metal strapped to a rocket booster,  you have
 to consider the amount of power required to vaporize the entire missile.

OK now, I would like to know which functions, if any, the RQS is to take 
from the Scout Service.

I know that they have the hardware of the Scouts: I also know that they 
have left censuses and the xboat network to the Scouts.

I know that their primary mission is Quarrentine, and soundry antiViral 
activities.

Now that the regency is about to head back to the Wilds, I need to know 
if the RQS is also going to take on 
    Exploration
    (First) Contact
    managing the Wilds xboats
    Technological Aid
    Wilds census
    Propaganda/information
    Military reconnaisance
    Diplomatic activities
    Promoting Regency business and trader interests
    Managing colonialization

If not, who\'s going to do it? Or are these jobs going to be split up 
between the RQS, Scouts, Navy Reconnaisance, Regency Diplomatic Corps, 
the Regency Science Council, and various more agencies, subcontractors 
and suchlike?

Or willthe gates be just thrown open, with the merchants and free traders 
doing all the hard work?  (It\'s possible: the East Indian Company 
basically did this in India)

A word concerning the Zhodani; They went to War with, and defeated (!), the
Imperium 5 times before the collapse, every time with the goal of keeping
the Imperials away from Zho space. When the Imperium collapsed, it was no 
longer a threat, and thus relations thawed. Now people are talking about 
re-creating the Imperium, not only at TL17-18, but with psionics as well.
I think the Zhodani High Council might be interested in this development, 
not to mention critical of it. Perhaps they would be interested in a conflict
between the RC and the Regency? 

As for the discussion concerning CIWS and point defence - remember that a
modern antiship missile is closing at Mach 1-3 and the CIWS kicks in at ranges
below 1000m, which gives it about a second to do its thing. A KKM or detonation
laser will be travelling at perhaps 100 km/sec, so a decent laser will allow
the tracking system several seconds to target an incoming missile. 
However, there are two important points here - a) the CIWS is a \'last ditch\'
defence, designed to defeat 1 or 2 incoming missiles that have survived the
air defences put up by Aegis cruisers and such. All you have is CIWS, you\'re 
in trouble. (Also, CIWS is pretty much useless against a nuke-carrying missle
that can detonate at 2 km range and fry you carrier. The same should apply
to a detonation laser - and don\'t try to tell me that a TL12 point defence 
system could locate a 10cm x 50cm cylindrical warhead travelling at 100 km/sec
at any range beyond a few hundred or thousand km. If it isn\'t radiating and
is in thermal equilibrium with the cosmic background (4 K, but doable - you 
store your warheads in liquid He), without a very good active EMS you will
be in trouble. If you go active, you have other problems. (that should be 2.3 K,above.. ) 
The conclusion I make is that missles are difficult to intercept and destroy.
Not impossible, but not easy, either. 
b) If, on the other hand, we decide that in fact a missle defence screen is 
good enough that you need a Tigress firing of a few thousand missles in 
short order to penetrate it, then we suddenly find that fighters are quite 
useless. they can\'t carry a hundred missles each, and being much larger targets
than missles (make no mistake - you can make a missle _very small_ and still
pack a nuke into it), they\'re sitting ducks for any worthwhile missle defence
screen. This is just as true for all the upgunned free traders that for some
reason ply the spacelanes filled with adventurers... 

The point I\'m trying to make is that the balance of the game is very tricky
to get right - if the missles are useful only in swarms of 5000 then you\'re
in a situation where space combat is rather like 17th century naval combat
with ships of the line sitting and throwing hunks of metal at each other for 
hours. On the other hand, if any ballsy fighter-jock with a 10-ton fighter
can vaporize a 100,000-ton battleship ( a la Wing Commander 2), why build 
them? 
The best compromise seems actually to be something akin to modern day 
naval and air combat - to take out a carrier group, you need 60-odd Bison 
bombers carrying heavy, long range missles. And a Super Etenard with an Exocet
can occasionally get lucky against a frigate, but can also get very dead very fast..

 Bob, slug pistol asset of 16, opens up with his custom gauss pistol
on his opponent at short range. Now firing single shots (recoil 1) he
could fire 5 shots (his str is 7) with a Difficult task, hitting on a
d20 roll of 16 or less with each bullet. OR he could fire a 5 round
burst (recoil 3) and those same 5 bullets would only hit on a roll of
4 or less on d20 roll. Is this correct? and if so, why?!?! It makes no

    'topic' => 'Missiles, CIWS, and Integrated Fire Control',
    'body' => 'I have been monitoring this discussion for some time, I feel that I 
have to cover some points. 

1. No matter what kind of missile type you use(ie, KKM, Nuke-Det, 
Nuke-Contact) your target will develope point defenses against such 
missiles.

2. If you favor nuke-det lasers consider this if a contact missile 
cannot resolve the fire control solution to reach the target do to
limited processing power with in itself or outside itself, not in 
itself a small fire control problem, A Nuke-Det laser must "track" 
the target decide at which point to bring out it folding laser tube 
array, align the laser tube array to within a thousandth of sec of 
arc at target possibly traveling at 10\'s of G\'s acceleration, while 
traveling at possible a greater speed that it\'s target. In fire 
control terms the contact missile is a far easier solution to resolve 
that the nuke-det laser. A contact missile has a simpler task track 
the target, bring itself into intercept zone, and hit/detonate. 

3. Missiles do not always travel in a straight line toward a target, 
just as target\'s do no travel in a straight line. Travelling in a 
straight line really makes the Fire Control solution so much easier. 
The path a missile takes depands on many factors such firing angle, 
target path, etc.

4. To hit a target that has point defenses you must saturate it with 
loads of missiles fired to arrive at petty much the same time 
interval. The better the targets point defenses the more missiles 
that must be used. A continous stream of missiles from single bearing 
is not as effective as a similtaneous swarm of missiles coming in 
from several bearings.

5. Todays CIWS tracks the target and bullets essentially separately. 
then CIWS brings the two tracks into one track. CIWS will keep firing 
at chunks of the target even after it has been destroyed. Todays CIWS 
effectiveness is limited by ready ammo "<1000 rnds", and barrel wear, 
in a sustained  conflict usage. In future CIWS using Lasers the 
efffectiveness will limited by the number of targets, the number of 
hits needed to kill the missile/target, and the power needs of the 
systems.

6. Point defenses for TNE ships should be layered ie Long, Medium and 
Short ranges. Long equals 4 to 6 hexes, medium equals 2 to 3 hexes 
and short 1 hex. This will simply fire control integration for the 
defending ship(s). Today we have Integrated Master Fire Control 
systems that manage which targets get shot at by what battery et al. 
These Integrated Master Fire Control systems are fairly automated 
needing minimal inpout from human operators. TNE has no such thing 
at least by the official rules.

7. The TNE rules for EW/ECM are best inadequate. Electronic Warfare 
effects can be summerized into three basic types. 

The first type is to deny the enemy sensors any information. This is 
the simplest fo the three methods, you just broadcast powerful enough 
noise to wash oput your signal.

The second type is misrepresent the information that the enemy 
sensors recieve about your target. This method is more complicated 
that the first, a good example would be a "blip enhancer" making the 
target appear larger than it really is.

The third method is give the enemy sensors information that does not 
exist. This the most sophisticated of the forms of EW. A good example 
would be a single ship fooling the enemy sensors into believing that 
a fleet of many kinds of ships is present.

Most modern day EW systems use a mixture of the above methods. 
Missiles have a limited ability to deal with EW so EW is more 
effective against missiles.

The Tech level of a EW jammer is more effective against sensors of a 
lesser Tech Level. The reverse is also true Sensor of higher Tech 
level are not as effected by EW jammers of lesser Tech level.

These EW/ECM could be incorporated into TNE fairly easily. Type one 
jamming raises the difficulty one level, Type two - increase two diff 
levels and type three - increase three diff levels. Tech levels 
differences between EW/ECM sensors could raise or lower the dif levels 
ie TL 14 jammer versus TL 10 ECM/sensor raise the diff levels by four 
levels. A TL 14 ECM/sesnor versus TL 10 Jammer drops the diff levels 
by four but never below the base diff chance.

PS-the post regarding GDWs change of FC from .225 to .3 finally makes
them make sense to me (at least I can backwards engineer theirs now)

And you\'re right, 8g8 missiles are weak KKMs.  A side note:  the leading
number at high TLs will always be the gturns of the missile.  In reality
the TL15 12g12 missile can actually be 2500g12 (or more).  I plan on
recording missiles that can accelerate more than their gturns of fuel
with the real acceleration just to give players an isdea of how *fast*
they get to 12gturns velocity.

Smart design.  Your assumption re: the turbofan is ok.
Btw, there is a real vehicle somewhat like this (the "Black Horse" concept
by Maj. Mitch Burnside-Clapp, USAF) using just rockets.  It takes off with
enough fuel to rendezvous for an airborne refueling, then loads up its 
tanks and zips off as a nearly-single-stage-to-orbit flight.

You didn\'t miss anything.  You did it (from my memory of the #s, not having
the tables at work...) just right.  Largebore ETC, especially largebore
ETC autocannons, are by far the nastiest actual weapon possible to design
using the FF&S rules.  They haven\'t got the range that the (revised)
plasma/fusion weapons have, or lasers, but they have amazingly long
range (out past 7500 meters in some cases) and penetrations can easily
pass 300 at short range.  Another nasty-evil-trick which I picked up
from someone (thanks, Steve) is to get rid of the power plant input and
run the electrical input required off a Explosive Power Generator, with
the EPG\'s cartridge built into the cannon shell...

One general hint for armor designers... the vehicles depicted in Striker
are incredibly under-armored and under-armed.  It is possible to defeat
them very very easily with just a bit of work on the design.  It is possible
to build a TL 10 1-ton (14 m^3) tank which costs under MCr2 (and less in 
quantity) which can defeat a Trepidia and is invulnerable to return fire.

FF&S has been pretty good at mentioning possible ways to produce power - 
although I for one would have appreciated some more distinction bewteen 
various types of fusion. The reson for this is playability and possible 
plot ideas. For instance, there is a world of difference between a fusion
plant that uses a deuterium-tritium mixture, and one that uses plain light
nydrogen. Tech levels for one - the former we hope to have in 50 years, the 
latter is probably TL-14 or so.. The difference is in available fuel - some
thing that is even more noticeable if you use for instance lithium or He-3, 
both rather rare fuels that you can\'t just skim off a gas giant. And running
out of "gas", be it He-3 or Lithium-7, is certainly something to avoid..

At TL16 antimatter power systems become available, although it seems to me
that in order to produce enough antimatter to fuel them you\'d need an 
enormous particle accellerator. THe advantage is of course, total conversion
of matter to energy. (Fusion is at best 0.7% effective in converting mass
to energy, the rest of the mass being in difficult-to-fuse He-4). However, 
there is another way to get total conversion of matter to energy, one that
I\'m sure must have been used at least a few times in Imperial days.

What you need is a _small_ black hole massing about 10.000 tons. This minute
black hole will be about 10^-20 cm in radius... Because it is so small, it
will be \'evaporating\' due to Hawking radiation at a prodigous rate. At 10,000
ton black hole with evaporate totally in about 10 seconds, most of the energy 
being released as gamma rays...  However, the rate of evaporation is inversely
proportional to the square of the mass - the more massive the black hole,
the slower it evaporates. Now, by injecting mass (not too hard, the black 
hole gobbles up almost everything) you can replenish the mass lost by radiation,as well as control the rate of radiation. The more you pump in, the less the
black hole evporates, and vice versa. Of course, this means that if you
interrupt mass injection for to long, the black hole will evaporate completely,
diappearing in a devastating flash of gamma rays... On the other hand, you can 
also quench it for a period of time, too. 
 
There are limitations to this idea - 1) you can only really use this when 
you want to produce _a lot_ of energy (10^20 watts or so, almost like a
standard battleship under MT rules. ;) ) 2) It\'s bloody dangerous. Sure you 
can use gravitics to control and suspend your black hole, but if you lets it
get too small the thing is going to blow up in your face.. Also, if you
lose containment of it it might well fall into the core of the nearest planet
or star. Although usually they evaporate before they start being fed by materialaccreted from the star... 
3) you need to find some easy way to make small black hole, because they don\'t exactly grow on trees these days. Perhaps a combination of gravitics and particleaccellerators could do the job. It\'s probably not even as difficult as making
tons of antimatter, which is just as likely to blow up in your face.

Advantages? Well, it will use whatevr fuel you care to give it, including
rocks, enemies, or the kitchen sink. It wil produce _lots_ of energy, since
it is in effect a total conversion device. It will also perform nicely as 
a planet- or star-buster.

Unclear areas? well, what effect will it have on a ship enetring jumspace
with one of these on board? tecnically speaking the entire ship is well
beyond the 100-diameter limit, but on the other hand, we are dealing with 
a singularity here. I\'ll leave that one up to all you j-space physicists out
there...

Finally, another idea/question; does the TNE universe permit magnetic 
monopoles? they would be a good way of explaining superdense materials 
(which are very hard to put into the science prt of sci-fi if you look
carefully) For a good explaination of the way they would work, do read
\'Dragons Egg\' by someone-who\'s-name-I-forget. A very readable story...

My roommate is friends with Mitch, and Black Horse is really, really

This is what the missile thread should be about.  Balance.  There are
three ways of looking at this as I see it.  There is the balance between
reality and fiction that SF always has.  There is "game balance".  And
there is the canon vs. TNE balance.

I\'ve been trying to work out KKMs for the first and last reasons.

Regarding the canon, your comments on compromise are getting close to
the mark.  In the canon, really big ships are immune from instant
destruction by missiles of any sort (no critical hits), but missiles can
slowly wear them down.  

Using KKMs can really throw this out of whack, but FFS has provided us
with Electrostatic Armor (ESA).  This can mitigate a lot of the
nastiness of KKMs, and also serves to keep you ship from wearing down to
a nub just cruising around in star systems where the dust density is
(relatively speaking) high.  On the other hand, KKMs can give fighters a
punch that\'ll take out a big ship... which means you\'ll have to shoot
down the fighters.  And since close in defence isn\'t the best answer
for this, you\'ll have to have your own fighters (or DEs) to screen your
big ships (interesting way to justify fighters :-)

Well, in a few centuries time, hopefully.  
However, a few clarifications: first, I doubt if the old relationship 
between the Third Imperium and the Zhos can ever be re-created: the 
Imperium/Regency is simply too small now.  Even if the Imperium is 
reconquered, the vast majority of Imperials will reside in the right 
side of the Great Rift, in the Regency proper.  And the population of 
that area is dwarfed by the population in the Consulate.  The Imperials 
may rule in the badlands if they wish, but the mainstream of human 
civilization will be in the Consulate from now on.

A comparable situation would be if the UK still ruled it\'s empire in the 
1990s, but with the Americans still dominant as it is today.  The British 
may rule as much territory as they wish, but most of the wealth, the 
biggest navy, the largest economy will still be American, and Americans 
would have the final say in what the British can or cannot do.

[And remember: in real life, the Americans  - with the Russians, and the 
local colony elite - pressured the British to give up Empire.  Why should 
the Zho\'s be any different?]

About the only way the Regency can avoid becoming a client state of the 
Consulate is to develop some way of artifically controlling or generating 
psionics.  THAT\'S why I\'m speaking of it.

A TL 17 Imperium in the future would really mean a TL 17 Regency: the 
Imperium  proper will forever be a backward region of space, with the 
Domain of Deneb \'nearly civilized\', and the Zhodani Consualte the real 
centre of humaniti. (And, in return for teaching the Regency in developing 
psionics, the Zho\'s get to share in Regency Technological discoveries.)

Don\'t be surprised if a rebuilt Third Imperium ends up as much a puppet 
state of the Zho\'s as the Reformation Coalition is a puppet of the Hivers.
(The sneaky people inherit the universe.)

This is simpy unnesessary now: why set up proxies if you can do the job 
yourself, simply and effectively?  If the Regency decides to play rough, 
Zho warships orbiting Mora is one of the most effective ways to point out 
who\'s top dog. If the 11,000 worlds of the Imperium had to *work* to 
hold back the Zhodani fleets, how does the 800 civilized worlds of the 
Regency do the job?

There are precious few ways to regain some balance of power, between the 
Regency and the Zhos.  One way is the (possibily) unexpected new avenues 
of Regency psionics.  This will take quite a while to properly develop, 
as the Zhos have been doing this since the First Imperium.   Still, over 
there it\'s the privelege of the power elite, and tightly controlled: it\'s 
quite likely that they haven\'t used it to it\'s fullest extent.

...and that\'s about it.  Unless the Regency can find some useful tool, 
some edge to equalize the balance of power with the Zhos, they will be as 
dominated by them as the Regency will dominate the Wilds.  THAT\'S why my 
timetravelling preCollapse Imperial would leave the Domain of Deneb as 
quickly as he does.

Alternate development routes: Well, the Regency could try to 
crash-develop it\'s area: instead of rebuilding the Wilds, they can 
instead up the general tech level of it\'s current area.  Even better 
if you up the population to equal the Zho population, in a volume of 
space maybe 1/4 of the Zho\'s.  The reconquest of the Imperium would fit 
quite nicely in this plan.

However, anything the Regency could do the Zho\'s can match.  And expect 
plenty of grumbling by the citizens while it\'s going on: this will mean 
major intrusion into areas traditionally under the authority of the 
locals, not the central government.

Moreover, why would the Zho\'s just stand by and let this happen?  If this 
does occur, expect the Zho\'s to demand - and get - a healthy cut of any 
benefits the Regency would get from this action.  One thing that wouldn\'t 
happen is the development of any military establishment capable of 
threatening the Consualte.  (Wait for Jewell subsector to become 
independent, under the joint rule of the Consulate and the Regency.)

The Regency could \'seal itself off\' from the Zhos while expanding into 
exImperial space, while poring cash into technological R&D like mad.  
FIne, but I bet the Zhos will get mightly suspicious, and either find 
some way to cripple it or send in the fleets.  Moreover, money spent in 
R&D cannot be used to buld TCr squadrons at the same time: either the 
military establishment will be weakened, or the general level of taxation 
will rise.

Question: why should the Regency even strive for it\'s independence from 
Zho economic & cultural domination?  It could instead forsake rebuilding 
the Imperium, and just be a comfortable, peaseful client state of the 
Consulate.  Done right, I bet this could be very comfortable for everyone 
involved. Just ask the Welsh, the Canadians, the Mongolians, the 
Darians (the Roman ones, not the Marches version), the Quebecois, or any 
other client state you care to name.

Well, I\'m sorry, but I want an independent Imperial government and 
culture, not some puppet state.  So I\'m a sentimentalist: I\'d like to see 
YOU adventure in a culture where violence is really prohibited, not just 
in law, but in the mind as well.  Where the Regency Thought Police is 
everywhere, percisely to stifle the ruffians most adventurers are.
  
(Now I admit: it *is* certainly possible to roleplay in an enviroment 
where there are no bad guys, and no real conflict: but if I wanted to 
play in Gene Roddenberry\'s Federation, I\'d have bought Star Trek, the Role 
playing game.

It get\'s worse.  Imagine if Picard - and a good-sized minority of the 
Officer core - could read the minds of their enemies, or teleport people 
with thought alone.  This is supposed to be Traveller, not GURPS Supers!) 

And yes, there will be Regency Thought Police within a century or two, if 
there is no effective way to counter psionics.  Remember:The Zhos are 
currently the dominant culture of Charted Space, they\'re the ones with 
the money, it\'s their culture that will \'catch on\' with Regency youth, 
it\'s there music that will dominate the airways (or among the Noble 
elite, depending on how Regency society develops)  Again: the Regency is 
in danger of being as dominated by the Zhos as old Japan was dominated 
by China -- or by the U.S. today. 

What the Zho\'s do will seem to be \'the sensible solution\' to most 
educated people.  There will always be those worlds that will try 
anything once, they\'ll try this Thought Police thing, and see what 
happens. (With Zho advise, freely given).  The Zho\'s will favour such 
worlds with cash and respect ["At least THESE people aren\'t born liars 
and decievers!: We can do real business with them."]  Zho money and Zho 
respect is worth a good bit more than what some antipsionic hillbilly\'s 
rant about freedom and privacy.  Moreover, \'if you\'re not guilty, you 
have nothing to fear\'.

Abuses within the police will be controlled, via methods taught by the 
Zhodani, who have 7000 years worth of experience with this.

Assuming there\'s no way to either foil this psionic survellence, and no 
way to democratize these powers (and put everyone on an even footing), 
the area is going to be pretty worthless as a traditional SF 
action-adventure enviroment.  Finally, psionics (and psionic control) 
will be considered the mark of \'civilized societies\':  "The Consulate
has been using psionic control for 70 centuries, and never fought a civil 
war.  Obviously, that\'s the way to go."

Again, none of this means that the Regency is fated to become just 
another provience of the Consulate: but - unless you want an adventure 
whrer there\'s no lying, no violence and only one culture - it becomes 
worthless for most traditional Traveller adventures.  

N.B: It does have interesting role-playing possibities, if you leave your 
weapons and cunning schemes at home.  Exploring how such a society would 
work would be quite rewarding.  However, this should be left as part of 
Zhodani culture: it shouldn\'t be allowed to take over everything!

This is mostly a response to Alvin\'s posts about the butt-kicking
Zho\'s.  First, please forgive me for not quoting any of the previous
articles, but I just wanted to say a few things and I didn\'t think that
the bandwith usage proved necessary.  Who knows, I may be wrong.

You made a point that the Imperium lost all five frontier wars.  This
is not accurate.  It\'s more precise to say that they frontier wars
ended in an eventual stalemate.  From the first to the last frontier
war, only a handful of planets along the border changed ownership. 
Also, if I remember correctly, by the end of the Fifth Frontier War,
the Imperium had acutally gained more real estate than it had before
the First Frontier War.

Second, the sector was told to deal with the encroachment into Imperial
space.  The resources of 11,000 planets were not there to be used. 
There were the resources of two or three sectors to be used.  And these
were sectors that were considered backwater (for lack of a better
term).  Now that they are the center of Imperial culture, they are
bound to have more resources at their disposal than before (this is a
`comparatively speaking\' statement).

As for psionics.  You forget that there are a few underground Psionic
Institutes working in the area.  Likewise, it has always been hinted
that the Imperial military, and especially the Navy have been
conducting Psionic research.  Thus, while they may not have as many
Psionics as the Zhodani, they are not completely ignorant of psionics
per say.

Just some food for thought.

The concept of a space carrier is not unworkable. There are several advantages
compared to a wet navy carrier; 1) no gravity. you just have to line up with
the landing bay and coast in. you could even do this from several directions
at the smame time, since there is no \'up\'. Thus speeding up recovery rates. 
You have to devise some kind of arresting system to slow down the incoming 
figther - I would think gravitics or magnetic field could do the job just fine.
Lining up the fighter shouldn\'t be any problem at all - it\'s easier than 
Real World (tm) CALS (carrier automatic landing system) systems have to deal
with, what with wind and waves... as for the airlock, well, I rather like 
the Arrival Vengeance system with revolving cylindrical airlocks. certainly
workable, if not versatile. High-speed airlocks would probably work just 
as well for more multi-purpose and multi-spacecraft-type systems.. 


As for the argument about this being very difficult in combat - well, h-ll,
how often would the USS Americal conduct recoveries while maneuvering to
avoid incoming missiles? You might launch fighters when engaged (using
catapult-like launch tubes to get the fighters free of the maneuvering carrier)
, but you sure wouldn\'t conduct recoveries. Too bad if you\'re retreating,
(i.e. jumping out under fire) but that\'s why they pay fighter pilots and 
rider crews so much. They "cover the withdrawal"...

No, there is no problem with the idea of a space fighter carrier. But there
is something of a problem with the idea of a space fighter. Anything a small
spaceship can do, a missle can do just as well. Also, the missle is smaller
and can maneuver more violently - thus be more likely to survive defensive
fire and inflict damage. Besides, at the velocities we are talking about,
human reactions are far too slow. Thus a fighter attack would consist of the
pilot designating a target for his fire-control system, and then trying to
avoid passing out while the computer makes the pass, aims, fires, and evades counterfire. Wing Commander style turnin\' and burnin\' is too implausible to fit
a hard SF game. Especially if you consider what a good point defence system 
could do to a squadron of fighters at medium range. (they\'re bigger, slower
and fewer than missles, but almost as easy to kill)

However, fighters have a few advantages too. they\'re more economical in 
long-term, low intensity warfare (why we use F-16\'s against Bosnian Serbs and
not Tomahawks), which would include pirate-supression. They are more versatile
and less vulnerable to critical hits than a missile carrier of equivalent
firepower, they are less apt to be decoyed ( more sensors and ECCM, as well
as onboard humans, who seem to be better than computers at spotting BS). 
Finally, there is always the \'get lucky\'-factor. A hotshot pilot might just
dream up something that could work, where a dumb one-use missle would plow
straight at the point defence system instead of hiding behind that piece 
of blasted space wreckage that just happens to have the right vector.
It\'s all a question of balance, and the only way to get the rules to give
that balance is to playtest.. n\'est-ce pas?

two more ideas; 1) Missles could, evem if launched one by one, still create
a swarm arriving all at the target from different headings at the same time.
Simple. The first few spend their \'extra\' time by dog-legging, i.e. flying at
an angle to the target, then at the right time each missle turns in towards
the target, timed by the MFD to arrive simultaneously... boom.
2) fighters could use free-flying bombs as weapons. The fighters accellerates
toward the target (or where it will probably be in 10 minutes), releases a 
small nuke, and then maneuvers to avoid close proximity to the target. If it 
released several of these on various headings, along with decoys, then 
tracking solution for the target could quickly become difficult. especially 
since the bombs dont need to carry a propulsion system, and thus can be very 
small. Of course the closer to the target the \'bomb\' is released, the more likly it is to come close enough to cause damage when it detonates.. which leads
to a perfect opportunity for heroics.. "Stay focused. Stay focused.. almost
there.. just little bit longer.. "etc.

Boy, this stuff is fun. To bad I can\'t do it for a living.

I am not a big fighter fan.  As the rules stand, they are not powerful
enough to justify their existance.  I prefer something along the lines of a
Cole and Bunch (Sten series, highly recommended) TacShip -- a small
multicrew warship with some station keeping capability. 

I do agree with some of the comments recently here on the problems carriers
have.   Lets face it, if 20th century air superiority were not so important
as it is, no one would operate aircraft carriers -- they are too darn dangerous.

You pay your money and you take your choices.  Why not operate more, smaller
carriers?  Or operate fighter off many types of warship.
  
>Do fighters have airlocks?

I\'d always assumed that the things were small enough to cycle the atmosphere
on the whole cockpit.  Personally, I\'d keep the pilot in his suit, and
either key the cockpit evacuated, or filled with some gas with low fire risk
(CO2?)

Thinking it over last night, I managed to think up a few reasons why the 
Zho\'s would permit the Regency to expand into the Wilds:

- "Keep them busy" As I love to point out, you can\'t both buy warships 
for Jewell Starbase, and found a colony with the same dollar.  Increased 
money to rebuild the Imperium cannot also be spent on building warfleets, 
or increasing the overall tech level of the current Regency.

- "The devil we know..." The Zho\'s KNOW that they can beat up on the 
Imperials, but they don\'t know if they can do the same to Virus. And 
letting the Regency hunt down Virus and stifle any incipent Virus 
civilization is one way to keep a pleasent status quo operational.

- "It isn\'t worth the effort to stop them"  Assuming that most Regency 
citizens are as feverent to rebuild the Imperium as I am, The only way 
that the Zho\'s could stop them is to fight a war.  They\'d win, but risk a 
Virus release: moreover, they may be simply condemming themselves to 
endless insurgencies and problems on their Rimward/Trailing frontier.  
Better to let the Imperials waste their money instead.

- "The Head controls the body: We control the head"  The Regency culture 
is already pro-psion, and possibly useful as a Zho ally.  Letting a 
pro-psion culture spread throughout the Wilds does have certain advantages.

[NOW, I hope I can get off this Zhodani kick! ]

 Well, if I apply a minimum amount of Imagination to the question,
 I come up with a couple of uniquely unexpected possibilities:

                Capital, Capital, Core

 or

                Imperial Palace, Capital, Core

 (Remember that in the material that gave info on the Palace, it
 was big enough to be a city in its own right.)

The actual \'landing in a \'space carrier\' is simpler than a wet carrier,
there is no arrestor wire to be engaged at high speed, no need for
fighters to come around again after failing to engage the wire, and the 
\'landing\' space figher will not interfere with launch operations as happens
in current wet carriers when landing fighters which have caught the wire
come to a halt in the angled deck launch area.
Also, landed fighters have to be towed off the flightdeck and brought down 
into the hangar, a time consuming process which can also interfere with 
flight operations.

As with current carrier situations, if the carrier is maneuvering, landings
are off.

Airlocks may be slower, a bit more costly than none at all, but I don\'t 
think they could fail catastrophically unless there was sabotage involved.
Also, it may be more cosly if all hangar operations have to be conducted
in a vacuum, all the vac suits for the techs, the lack of dexterity in
the suit affecting the quality of the work, and the need for more airlocks
to provide entry into the hangar without affecting the pressure level in
the rest of the ship.

It would be hard to do, as ideally a fighter should be aiming for a 
zero-v difference between the carrier and itself on recovery. If 
there was a collision, it should be at low enough velocity not
to endanger the ship or landing port.

If the fighter is damaged enough to posed an explosion threat, get it 
to dump fuel before grappling it aboard.

As to the question \'Are fighters any use in TNE\' I don\'t know. I haven\'t 
played BL, and thus have little idea as to their effectiveness vs. combat
ships, but they do give an enemy a lot more incoming targets to think about,
are fairly small, with a turret sized armament, and more likely to do something
unexpected, unlike a missile. Any BL afficionados run carriers vs cruiser 
scenarios?

>-Merrick

I saw Maj. Burnside-Clapp at a panel on Space Access at the SF Worldcon in
Glasgow at the end of August. He gave a short, but interesting talk on the
Black Horse, which I\'ll summarize:

Black Horse is a F-16 sized rocket plane, fueled by hydrogen peroxide and
kerosine in the latest version. It Takes off with a full oxidizer load (h202),
and enough kerosine to rendezvous with a tanker which fills the kerosine
tank up. The black horse (BH) disengages and boosts for low earth orbit, or
a sub-orbital trajectory, depending on the mission requirements.

Possible missions include:

Reconnsance
Satellite deployment
Strike (space-ground)
Counter-space (anti-sat, jamming)
Medevac

The BH has a payload bay about the size of an F-16 crew compartment. For the
first 4 missions it would be loaded with cameras, sats, bombs or ecm gear
respectively. For the last mission, it could take an injured soldier, in a 
pressurized compartment, and fly him/her from Saudi Arabia to the U.S. in 
an hour. As to the economy of this, I don\'t know, but the Major emphasised
the morale effect.
The BH could be deployed overseas easily, needing parking space for tankers
abd accomodations for techs.
BH has no airlock, and no spacewalking capacity is anticipated.
Unrefueled the BH has a range, sub-orbital, of 7000miles, refueled it can
ovefly any point on the globe and return.

That was the substance of the Major\'s talk.

BH, to me, seems like a good idea, and with some modifications could possibly 
serve as a Space Station crew/cargo resupply vehicle.

This is just my recollection of Maj. Burnside-Clapp\'s talk, my memory isn\'t 
perfect!

Hope this helps.

Forgive me for not quoting previous mail - I hope this is intelligible anyway.

The Zhodani are definitely a problem as far as making a roleplaying universe
goes - that is, _if you make them all-powerful and far too harmonious_.
The argument that it\'s better to let the Regency pour money into rebuilding
the imperium and thus \'a credit spent in the Wilds is one less spent on
Riders\', is very shortsighted. So shortsighted in fact as to be more like
an Imperial policy than a Zho one. Sure, that credit might not buy a cruiser
today, but in 50 years it will buy a batRon. The Zhodani know that. However,
they also know that -unlike many who seem to be stuck in 19th century thinking-
a prosperous neighbour is more likely to be a peaceful one...             
Also, it is amazing how fast you can rebuild; a perfect example is what used
to be East Germany. Yes, it is true that west Germany strained its economy
in rebuilding, but the returns are enormous, and soon in coming as well. 
The Marshall Plan is another (perhaps even better) example of reconstruction.
Yet another advantage the Regency would have is that it is resettling 
already charted and explored space. Certainly there are dangers -TED\'s Vampire
ships, and what have you - but they already know which worlds are habitable, 
which are rich in resources, and which are troublesome... this will have an
enormous effect on the rate of reconstruction... I can easily see a scenario
where it takes less than 100 years to reestablish thousands of thriving,
growing worlds.. You see, what we have here is a large area of habitable 
space that can easily support thousands of times its current population (the 
old Imperium had eleven TRILLION inhabitants, ten trillion of them died).
The scene is et for exponential growth - which you should know can be _fast_.

Another aspect of this reconstruction is that it will tend to lead to a 
large degree of homogenization of the newly resettle area - the settlers
will all share the same basic culture ( Semi-Imperial, Behind-the-Claw),
they will have the same tech level ( 14 for the masses, 15-16 commercial, 
17 military), and they will all be used to the idea of the Regency having power.Like it or not, these people could re-establish an imperium in four generations.Not only that- it will be an imperium that is to a large extent willing and able (perhaps even unable to not) continue expanding. I think that the most 
clear-sighted Zhodani realize this, and I think this will have a strong 
effect on Zhodani culture. 

To begin with, reconstructing the Imperium would demonstrate the vitality
and adaptiveness of Imperial culture - something the Zho\'s are lacking.
You realize that when the average Regency inhabitant could just decide to
pack his belongings, take a low passage to some booming planet in Core and
start a new life - a few (not many I grant you. 7000 years of stagnation
will have had its effect. theose with \'get-up-and-go\' have already gotten
up and left) unusual Zhodani are going to ask themselves why they can\'t do the 
same. But this is not the important part. No, instead the Zhodani leaders 
will realize with horror that THE IMPERIALS REPLACED 10 TRILLION DEAD IN 
FOUR GENERATIONS. The Zhodani could simply put never match this. And not only
that - the restored imperium is no longer hemmed in on all sides - to 
coreward the Vargr are in trouble, to Rimvard the Solomani are wiped out, 
to anitspinward the K\'kree are now once again reduced to roaming the plains 
looking for pasture, and to Spinward (Foreven sector and beyond) there are
vast areas of uncharted space. the Zho\'s have had no firm opposition to 
expansion for millenia, yet they inhabit a volume smaller than that of the 
Third Imperium. the Galaxy belongs to those who reproduce - the Zhodani 
now face a culture that could outnumber them in five or six generations.
They must adapt or become irrelevant - and the most far-sighted of them
know that. 

I find that the Imperium much more fruitful for gaming simply because it is
DYNAMIC. To be sure, the Zho worlds can hardly be as pastoral as they are 
portrayed - for that reason I think gamers have overlooked an enormous 
opportunity for adventuring in Zho Space. What would it be like to be on a 
Core Expedition? A smart, resourceful misfit in Zho society who has mastered
psionic deceit? Don\'t tell me a psionic can\'t lie to another psionic, at 
least if he/she/it is good at it... I think Asimovs books about the Foundation,
and in particular the Gaia/Foundation interactions paints an interesting 
picture ripe with possibility. But I digress. 

It is incontestible that the Rebellion War and the Virus are the most 
important events in history - and now we are at a crossroads. Either the
regency and all of charted space can get stuck in interminable squabbling
and stagnation, or the door to expansion can be opened. For the purpose of 
gaming possibilities, I strongly suggest the latter. A universe where there 
are no fixed boundaries is much more interesting. It can hardly be a coincidenc
e that most traveller campaigns I\'ve ever heard of took place in areas like
the Spinward Marches, Foreven sector, even Gateway had possibilities. Who 
would ever want to adventure in pre-Rebellion Massilia? It would be like 
mounting a wilderness expedition into Suburbia, USA.

Anyway, I think it\'s a mistake to relegate all of the Domain of deneb to 
the staus of Zho-like boringness. In fact I think it\'s a mistake to relegate
all of the Zhodani Consulate to the status of Zho-like boringness.

Well, he can actually fire 2 5-round bursts without recoil problems...
At, as you say, to hit on a roll of 4 for each of 10 shots...

Yes, this makes sense... it\'s what Col. Cooper and others derisively call
the "Spray and Pray" technique of shooting.  I.E., spray lots of lead in the
general
direction of your enemy and pray that you hit... It is known for being the
technique of choice for people who don\'t know how to shoot.

I am not so sure that the RC would hit TL15 that quickly.  In the Pre-Collapse 
Imperium, there were plenty of worlds trying to make it to TL15 and TL16, but 
this was a very long and arduous process.  And that was in a time where 
there were many more TL15-saavy technicians around, and when the Imperial 
infrastructure was around and in good condition.  The RC will be forced to 
bootstrap 
itself up using ruined infrastructure and a much smaller pool of TL15 
technicians.  I 
would suspect the RC will hit TL13 pretty quickly (by 1230 possibly) but this 
will be a 
major technology plateau; they will not be advancing much further until they 
rebuild 
some infrastrucutre, expand the RC high-tech economy and get a generation or 
two 
of technicians and engineers who are trained to build things rather than 
salvage and 
repair things.  I WOULD suspect that the RC would be able to salvage and repair 
TL15 warships by 1230-1250, but these would be at a disadvantage in battle due 
to the fact that they are salvaged; systems will be missng or jury-rigged, and 
supplies 
of spares will be dependant on salvage operations and luck, rather than on 
technical 
skill and economic strength.

But the Regency is probably the best-equipped state in the known worlds to 
fight off a 
Virus-controlled attack.  The Virus has been a constant threat to the Regency 
for 70+ 
years, and the Regency has devoted a lot of military and scientific resources 
to fighting 
off Virus incursions.  I would not be at all surprised if the Regency has some 
form of 
anti-Virus that infects and disables Virus-controlled computers.  I doubt that 
the psionic 
influence on Regency affairs will be as large as you describe, but certainly 
the Regency 
Navy will not be shy about using Psions to develop new tactics and 
methodologies to 
defeat Viruses.  As for the TL16 element, the Virus fleet would still be 
hampered by the 
fact that it is being supported by a government that can only supply TL12-TL13 
new 
equipment, or some TL15 salvaged equipment.  That TL16 advantage drops away 
quickly if the ship is armed with a bunch of TL12 Meson Weapons and lasers.   
The 
RC would probably be very disappointed with the performance of their vaunted 
Virus 
fleets against the Regency.

>Now (actually, from say 1220) , if that TL E BarRon squadron from the 
>Regency arrives over Aubaine, it\'ll be lucky to get out alive.

Those TL E BatRons won\'t be showing up in the RC; they will be busy subduing 
some 
TL9 TEDs and loner Virus ships elsewhere.  The Regency isn\'t going to waste any 
time in countering a threat from the RC, so it will send its top of the line 
TL16 fleets, fresh 
from the yards on Mora, supported by some "old and outdated" TL15 auxilliaries 
like 
Plankwell and Empress Battleships.

There is one fairly significant hope for the RC, but it is not to be found in 
defeating the 
Regency fleets.  The RC is far away from the Restored Imperium.  If the RC 
rulers are 
smart, they will bide their time and focus their attentions to rimward and 
anti-spinward.  
If the RC does not provoke the Regency, the Regency is not going to go out of 
its way 
to invade the RC.  That is expensive, and there is a lot of former Imperial 
space to retake 
closer to home (and possibly the Vargr Extents and the Julian Protectorate as 
well).  The 
Regency will  probably not be too hyped over trying to reacquire former 
hinterland regions 
of the Third Imperium and the Solomani Confederation, but if the Regency is 
threatened, 
it would have no compunction about "removing" the threat.

Of course, if the RC lays low for 150 years or so, the Regency will have a 
large and high-tech 
neighbor that could pose a real threat.  Now, that would be interesting to 
watch.

Now, where\'s that damned Regency Sourcebook!?!?!  I must have it now...

>I haven\'t tried with Heplar missiles, but don\'t expect much more success.

Funny you should mention that....  I\'ve been working on Heplar and Fusion 
drive missiles and have been quite impressed:

The Agincourt class Cruise Missile
TL 15		Vol. 	Mass	MCr
Warhead	500 Kt	0.4	0.4	1.2	
Fusion 	6 MW	1	2	0.2	
HEPLaR 		0.6	0.6	0.006	
Fuel		4.79	0.3353		
1 hex PEMS	0.21	0.41	0.41	
Total		7	3.75	1.816
	
FC		1.5	0.105		
G\'s	33.54				
G-Turns	214				

	With this design, a missile cruiser can launch from the max range
of its sensors and have missiles engaging the target in the next few turns.  
This particular missile must be designated by another ships AEMS or 
ladar.  But since the firing ship can stay out beyond 35 hexes where
absolute range diff mods make it almost impossible to hit, it has little to
fear from a conventional gunship.
	I modified a standard Missile Corvette with 16 hex AEMS and gave 
it autoloaders for its missile barbettes.  Then I put it up against a 
Midu Agashaam class Destroyer.  Make the range 48 hexes (long range bogey 
detection for the Corvette by Merrickrules) and give both ships bogey 
detection.  First turn, the Corvette lights up the AEMS and locks the 
Destroyer.  The Corvette is beyond max range of the Destroyers weapons and 
it has +9 diff mods (or more) for range beyond 27 hexes,  -6 for the MFD 
and -1 for the size of the Corvette, gives a net of  Impossibile +1.  The 
Destroyer misses.  When range hits 27 the Corvette empties its missile 
barbettes of Agincourt(tm) missiles and runs away.  Four barbettes, five 
missiles each, thats  20 missiles.  The missiles burn max Gs toward the 
Destroyer and reach it in _1_ turn.  Lets be nice to the Destroyer and say 
it hits a missile with every one of its weapons, including the spinal 
mount, and kills 9 missiles.  Lets say 6 of these missiles lose lock and 
fly off into space.  The remaining 5 fire on the Destroyer.  Three hit.  A 
total of 10 det-laser beams hit the Destroyer and trash it.  The Corvette 
still has another salvo left.
	The 400-ton Corvette just did severe damage to the 
3000ton Destroyer without ever exposing itself to effective return fire.  
This is with det-lasers.  Imagine what a KKM with a closing velocity of 
30+ Gs could achieve.  It gets worse.  Agincourt missiles have 214 
G-turns.  With another ship designating for it, the corvette could launch 
from 150+ hexes away, leaving the missiles 64 G-turns to correct, and 
still get a closing velocity which would punch those KKMs through one 
side of the Destroyer and out the other without even noticing.  Lets  
line up a bunch of em and see how many we can punch through with one 
missile.  Okay, so the Midu Agashaam is a wimpy ship, but its still 
almost an order of magniture larger than the Corvette which just trashed it.

	Hey Merrick, would you mail me the rules for KKM damage you 
have?  I\'d like to see how vicious these get.

Merrick said:
>Using KKMs can really throw this out of whack, but FFS has provided us
>with Electrostatic Armor (ESA).

	I thought ESA (Electro-Static Armor) worked against HEAP 
and plasma weapons but not KEAPs.  Am I missing something?  I suppose at 
the impact energy we\'re taking about the KKM might _become_ a plasma....  
Of course anything that can be invoked to reign in 150 hex Hail Mary KKM 
Battleship killers would be welcome. :)

*Great*.  Unfortunately, I have not heard of the Traveller Chronicle. 
Could someone on this mailing list please fill me in?

Also, what are the legal issues concerning publication of material which
has already appeared in another form (eg Web page)?  I realise this is less
related to the TML list, but considering the recent change in policy that
Challenge magazine has concerning publication of submissions, I feel it is

HI all, 

First a though about j-drives... My understanding of how they work (based 
on the old Starship Ops manual above all.) is that you have a lanthanum 
doped net in the hull, a computer/power-router, a HPG bank (which IMHO 
might also be a loop of superconducting wire), and a special purpose 
powerplant. The reason you couldn\'t just charge up your HPG from the normal 
plant was unclear - I had to find a good explanaition for my players, so 
I said that you need _lots_ of energy quicky- the HPG/superconductor/capacitor
banks would break down before you had enough charge if you used a normal
plant. (reasonable - Capacitors leak charge, superconducting magnets might
lose the right kind of crystalline structure, or HPG magnetic bearings might for some reason not hold ) In order to get this large current flow you use 
a special method to extract energy from the plasma - MHD. In effect, you 
run hydrogen down a tube, compresing and heating it until it fuses. The 
heat from the fusion is used to accelerate the plasma further, at which point
you charge it and run it through a magnet. presto - lots of current. and very
inefficient unfortunately. only suitable for j-drives. 
And now we get to the point. namely that what you need to charge a jump drive
is a high-velocity, high-temp plasma running by a magnet. There is another 
way to create such a plasma - nuclear explosives. Conceivably you could 
pad a nuke with lots of ionizable stuff like cesium that would flash into
plasma as it goes off, and then use gravitic and magnetic fields to channel this into your MHD tube, or if you hadn\'t mastered gravitics, you could just 
make a big enough nuke. THis seems like a cheap, dirty, low-tech way to 
get into jumpspace... Perhaps cheap enough to be  a common technique at TL-9 ?
Or a good way to jury-rig your busted J-drive when you\'re headed into that
star over there..?
What do you think? I think it has a certain feel to it; "Go to the stars -
with a bang." 

Coupled with the assumption that certain geometries greatly simplify j-space
calculations (Of course, the necessary shape is a silly-looking saddle-shape
or something equally impractical), you might even be able get into J-space
at TL7-8. (NO, this is NOT Space:1889, thank you.)

Just because we didn\'t do it when we were at a low tech level doesn\'t mean
it can\'t be done... 

And now Heplar.. what happens when you run a HEPLar drive in an oxygen atmosphere? once the Hydrogen cools sufficiently it will combust, I would think. 
THus resulting in the embarassing case of a HEPlaR-propelled grav tank 
leaving behind it a 200-meter tail of flame. Boy, that has _got_ to be hard
to spot on HRT.

Therefore; can you use other chemicals in HEPlar drives? Above all, water?
Since you\'re not fusing it (which is a strange oversight - you would need
the extra energy in order to get the accellerations claimed), it should 
work even better than hydrogen, because of its higher density. Although I
suppose that you will still have the problem of combustion since the heat
would crack the water.

Forgive me for bringing up these perhaps nit-picky points, but it seems 
Traveller is at least partially hard sci-fi, and my group tands to come up 
with technically hard questions... and I like to give better answers than 
"because it just works that way, and remember this is a game. Now shut up
and roll the dice."

Since the Computer Guy popped my balloon on impossibly large Zho naval 
fleets, the unbalanced relationship between then is now a good bit more 
balanced.  

(Whew!)

And without a massive imbalance in wealth, the Zhodani won\'t swamp the 
Regency with cash and culture, either.  Another nasty monster put to rest.

Even so, I wouldn\'t mess with them if I were you.  Depending on how much 
damage they took from Virus, they\'re still definitely more wealthier and 
more powerful than the Regency, although they probably would have 
problems conquering the Regency.  Just how much of a problem depends on 
how many High tech worlds GDW put in the Regency.  The kind of 
information only found in (all together now) THE REGENCY SOURCEBOOK!

(Any adventurers out there available for hire?  I\'ve got a little job for 
you in an out-of-the way, low-tech dirtball called Bloomington....) 
 
*************

Vland is going to be a highly interesting problem for the Regency.  Only 
GDW really knows what happened to it (and we\'ll have to wait quite a 
while, I suspect).  But here are a few possibilities:

A) "Ground to meat."  Vland was at TL F, last time we saw it.  *And* was a 
high-population world, too.

And we all know what Virus does to high-tech, high-population worlds now, 
don\'t we.

Now, with the Vilani population blasted to shreds, but with a lot of 
useful - if Infected - high-tech equipment lying about, the place is a 
prime settlement target.  Settled, that is, by high-tech, largely
Solomani-desended Imperials, almost certainly washing out the 
couple o\'thousand pure-blooded Vilani aboriginies running naked in the woods.

And I bet that the high-tech Regency cousins of those naked aborigines 
isn\'t going to like it one bit.  What *THEY* probably want to do is slap a 
racial-purity zone on Vland, turning it into a reservation.  And 
gradually, in the Vilani manner, raise their tech level.  

Expect lot\'s of politicing, with the Vilani at a distinct disadvantage since 
        - During the Rebellion, the Vilani Megacorps and Vilani sector 
          decided to abandon the Imperium (and the Domain)
        - Without the Megacorps, the Regency Vilani have lost their major 
          base of power.  Without a major population base (The Regency 
          was largely settled by Solomani), they haven\'t got much democratic 
          say, either.

B) "Berserker Throne" If Virus has made Vland into a robot-run world, 
more additional problems arise.  Vland was a major world of the Imperium, 
and it\'s proper restoration is one of the major goals of the Regency.  
which means that, unlike most Virus centres the Regency finds, you can\'t 
just nuke it to glass.  If the Vilani loved robots (and they did like 
expert programs), the Regency Marines can expect heavy action on Vland.

And not just the Marines: remember that Vland was a massive naval base 
in pre-Rebellion times, and was an independent nation during the 
Rebellion.  Which means lots and lots of warships.  I don\'t envy the 
first few Regency Scouts to enter the system (and you thought that scouts 
in Classic Traveller had short lifespans!).  And I don\'t envy the 
commander of the Naval task force sent to clear Vland of the vampires.

C) "Intruder! You have entered the Restored Vilani Empire.  Identify 
yourself!"  

If the Vilani somehow managed to survive Virus and endure as a pocket 
empire, then you can expect some fancy diplomatic footwork as Regency 
diplomats strive to incorporate it peasefully, while the locals 1: 
recover from the shock of seeing people with sunbursts on their helmets 
2: strive vigourously to retain at least some independence. 

The Vilani here will be the first pocket empire that the Regency 
encounters, not the RC. And it will be the Vilani that will set the 
pattern for Regency treatment of the Wilds.  Finally, assuming a peaseful 
annexation into the Regency, it will be the Vilani that will be the Regency\'s
advisors on how to treat the Wilds, acting like a buffer between the 
Regency and the Wildmen.

Hya, All!  Just a reminder that I\'m going to produce a less-buggy version 
by the end of September/early October.  This version is O.K., but I\'ve 
been told there are some bugs in the temperature stuff.

Also: Thanks Bill for sending out my program, but maybe not on the list 
next time, just directly to Bailey. Thanks!

    'body' => '     Responding to Alvin Plummer\'s suggestions:
     
     >>Alternate development routes: Well, the Regency could try to 
     crash-develop it\'s area: instead of rebuilding the Wilds, they can 
     instead up the general tech level of it\'s current area.  Even better 
     if you up the population to equal the Zho population, in a volume of 
     space maybe 1/4 of the Zho\'s.  The reconquest of the Imperium would 
     fit quite nicely in this plan.<<
     
     So are you suggesting that the Regency might want to develop a reverse 
     colonization program?  Encouraging the inhabited planets in the wilds 
     to emigrate _to_ the Regency?  Or encourage fertility among their 
     indigenous populations?
     
     I doubt it.  While the wilds have floundered and billions of people 
     have perished in what once was Imperial space, the Regency has 
     continued to go about their day-to-day business.  This includes having 
     babies and continually increasing the population.  While a large 
     number of scientists (including Carl Sagan, for one) have hypothesized 
     that we cannot develop interstellar travel until we have achieved 
     zero-population growth as a race, there\'s nothing to say that once we 
     _do_ have interstellar travel, we won\'t proceed to overpopulate the 
     planets we colonize.
     
     That said, I don\'t think that most worlds are going to want to beef up 
     their populations to combat the Zhodani threat.  What\'s the point?  
     The technical edge the Regency has over the Zhodani makes the Regency 
     undigestible by the Zhodani.  Surely the stable homogeneous Zhodani 
     wouldn\'t want to upset the balance of their society by undertaking a 
     war so massive that it takes all their resources and upsets the very 
     foundation upon which their society is built.  Even a long-term, more 
     covert war would gobble up huge resources, especially once the 
     trigger-happy Regency gets wind of the scale of such an operation.
     
     Other than importing colonists _from_ the wilds, I don\'t see how the 
     Regency could quickly hyperpopulate their 800 worlds.  And that just 
     doesn\'t seem feasible.  Furthermore, any program to increase fertility 
     or encourage child-rearing won\'t meet favorably with the public.  
     Highly industrialized, modern societies just don\'t increase their 
     populations as quickly as poor underdeveloped ones do.  Most Regency 
     systems, I would guess, fall into the former category.  
     
     I once heard about a public program in Israel that encouraged married 
     couples to have numerous children, in response to reports that the 
     Palestinian population was growing exponentially faster.  I don\'t know 
     how this is going, but I doubt that Israelis are trying to have any 
     more children than they already would have planned on.
     
     >>Question: why should the Regency even strive for it\'s independence 
     from Zho economic & cultural domination?  It could instead forsake 
     rebuilding the Imperium, and just be a comfortable, peaseful client 
     state of the Consulate.  Done right, I bet this could be very 
     comfortable for everyone involved. Just ask the Welsh, the Canadians, 
     the Mongolians, the Darians (the Roman ones, not the Marches version), 
     the Quebecois, or any other client state you care to name.<<
     
     But even more important, why would the Zhodani even strive to 
     _incorporate_ the Regency as a client state or otherwise?
     
     There are several reasons why the Zhodani would not want to.  Among 
     them:
     
     1)  The Zhodani are an extremely orderly and homogeneous society.  
     While Zhodani governments vary as much as Regency or former Imperial 
     governments do, there are several elements that are the same across 
     the board for the Zhodani.  All governments are psionic dominated.  
     And all are ruled by pureblood Zhodani.
     
     2)  The Zhodani are an extremely conservative society.  Expansion 
     throughout history has been orderly and at a uniform rate.  The 
     Zhodani Consulate extends at almost equal distances in all directions 
     from Zhdant because of carefully managed, meticulously governed 
     colonization.  Except for the coreward expeditions that is, but that\'s 
     an anomaly, since those were inspired by a unique Ancient artifact 
     that showed them the way to go.
     
     [Hmm.  What the heck _have_ those Zhos found out there, anyway?!]
     
     3)  The threat of virus still exists.  Why not keep the Regency in its 
     present state as a buffer zone?  Any mass attack into the Regency 
     would tangentially effect the Zhodani as well if they affiliate 
     themselves with the Regency.  You\'ve heard the proverb, "The enemy of 
     my friend is my enemy"?  It applies here.  And I think the Zhos know 
     it.  Better to maintain friendly relations without becoming too 
     involved or committed, lest the Zhodani themselves become embroiled in 
     the mess that was the Imperium.
     
     In short, I believe the status quo is the likely future.  The Zhodani 
     are going to keep to themselves and pursue their coreward expeditions. 
     No wars to fight.  No espionage to become involved with.  Just new 
     worlds to conquer.
     
     If anything, the Zhodani are going to be more congenial with the 
     Regency than they ever have with the region throughout history.
     
     The roleplaying opportunities are enhanced by this since we don\'t just 
     have to view the Zhodani as sneaky guys in the spinward subsectors.  
     They are now both friend and enemy:  goodwill diplomat and espionage 
     agent.

     lead in the general direction of your enemy and pray that you hit...

     know how to shoot.<<
     
     And furthermore, automatic fire is particularly useful when firing 
     into a crowd of targets.  Don\'t forget that while you may miss your 
     front line of targets, the rules dictate that for all the shots that 
     missed secondary rolls are made to determine who among the people or 
     objects _behind_ the primary target are hit by stray automatic fire.  
     So while all the shots are at Impossible level, at least you get 
     several shots at hitting multiple targets.
     
     A player\'s best bet is to fire single shots if he wants to hit a small 
     group of targets or bursts if he\'s fighting a squad or more.

THE ANTIVIRUS RUNAROUND

Situated on the very edge of the Regency/Virus border, the incoming 
traveller can expect Trin-level paranoia. And just as well: if for any 
reason Virus enters the system, the 700 million people of Antra are as 
dead as Dulinor.

Any ship filing a direct flight plan to Antra is immediately pointed to 
the nearest Regency Quarrentine Office.  In cooperation with the  Antran 
government, the RQS keeps a set of specific travel routes and jump 
routines controlling movement within the Antran system, which vary from 
time to time.  The computer module of flight routine for the specific time 
that the traders intend to be in the system is directly plugged into the 
various computer systems of the ship by RQS personnnel, and an RQS  
officer is posted to the ship for the week\'s trip.

Before leaving for Antra, the ship is carefully checked out by an RQS 
team, taking a day per 100 tons displacement.  Everyone is given a 
complete physical examination: noone with artifical inorganic 
enhansements is permitted to continue on the voyage, on pain of death.

When they first arrive from jump the ship follows it\'s pre-computated flight 
plan to a preselected position and vector in space.  The RQS officer on 
board must radio for a RQS cutter to meet them, using a special one-time 
code that only the RQS officer on board knows.
  
NOTE: Antra is within 100 diameters of it\'s primary star: the ship leaves 
jump space between 155 and 355 light-seconds from Antra, depending on 
orbitl mechanics, the skill of the pilot, etc.  With the pre-computed 
jump co-ordinates, the ship always leaves jump exactly opposite of Antra\'s 
position, 355 light-seconds away on the other side of the star.

Ships that do not conform to the specific flight plan must immediately 
kill their velosity, and come to a dead halt.  The people on board must 
put on their space suits and cross over to the RQS cutter.  The ship is 
impounded, and usually considered forfeited to the Antran government if 
free of Virus.  If the ship is found to be infected, the crew have their 
personalities reconstructed.

Ships that don\'t come to a stop, for whatever reason, are destroyed. 

The cutter boards the ship and an RQS team carefully looks it over for Virus.
Since this is a lighter team that the previous base-check, it only takes 
a few hours before the ship is underway again, to a nearby (usually under 
20 light-seconds) RQS space station.

The RQS station - basically an underarmed naval base, designed to take 
on a flotilla of 100 ships of up to 1000 disp tons each - AGAIN 
checks out the ship for Virus.  After about half a day - regardless of 
the size of the ship, the local crew is large, good, well equipped, and fast 
enough to process it in under 12 hours - the ship, without it\'s escort 
but still with it\'s babysitting RQS officer onboard, finally heads for Antra.

Your ship will be halted and inspected 10 light seconds from Antra, not 
by a RQS cutter by a 1000-6000 ton SDB.   

THE WORLDROOF

As you finally approach Antra (at 1G, as per regulations), bathed under the 
dull red light of it\'s star, you start to notice that it seems to be 
largely encased by glass. And when you arrive at the Highport - attached to 
Antra by a 50 km elevator - the vast Worldroof of Antra is revealed in 
all it\'s glory.  It covering over 80% of Antra, composed by a mosaic of 
hexagonal "glass" cells suspended in the air by 1,774  2km high \'tower 
groups\'.  Each \'tower group\' is composed of seven towers: six towers  
supports the roof, generates power (via both capturing a small percent of 
the star\'s radiated energy and the 200-300 km winds), and provides the 
best weather control in the Regency (or for that matter, in the 
preCollapse Imperium).

The seventh tower is either an industrial or residential centre.  
Industrial centres were built with 5,000 inhabitants, residental centres 
- basically tower cities, in a style familiar on high-tech worlds - holds 
up to 500,000 people.

No ship ever lands on Antra: the high-atmosphere winds are both fast and 
fickle, continually shifting to equalize the tempertature between the 
dark and light sides of Antra.  Also, it\'s a security measure by the 
Antrans to again insure that Virus doesn\'t get in. Thus, all transport 
is via the Highport elevator.

(REFEREE: Why doesn\'t the atmosphere flow out of the 20% of the world not 
covered by the Worldroof?  Ask the British Interplanetary Society: 
they\'re the ones who came up with this crazy idea!  The \'high-winds\' 
part is a natural consequence of equalizing the temperatures, and 
moderating the nighttime low to the extent that the Antran want to: it 
should be doable given TL E tech.)

ARRIVING ON ANTRA

All people, articles and cargo is completely checked out by local antiVirus 
teams on the Highport, taking another day. (This includes medical 
examinations: no people with ANY artifical inorganic enhansements is 
permitted insystem.  If caught in this stage of the game, they will be 
killed.)  Another quickie \'make sure\' check is made before leaving the 
elevator, and a final antiViral team awaits to greet the players just as 
they step off the 30 minute journey on the massive elevator, for another 
full check of everyone and everything.

(An entire RICE paper can be written on security procedures within the 
Regency, from the ultra-lax standards in the Seven Sisters to the 
short-and-vicious procedures of Trin, from the short and effective 
procedures of Vincennes to long, bureaucratic and paranoaic restrictions 
for Antra.)

FESTIVAL

The first thing everyone does after arrival is look up at the immense 
hexagonal grid over them. Throughout most of the year, you\'ll only see a 
crystal clear, cloudless sky, faintly outlined with hundreds of hexagons.
In the nighttime, the outlines glow faintly red: but that is all.

But, if you arrived during the two-week Blazing Lights 
Festival, you\'d see some fantastic pattern of lights and graphics in the 
sky, surpassing anything you may have seen in a VR tube.  These Festivals 
have become more and more ornate since the Collapse, now including 
sound\'s and wind patterns specifically created for the artist, generated 
by the weather control system (imagine immense, organ-like sounds 
emminating from the roof and the winds: absolutely overwhelming).

Of course, tickets for Antra tends to skyrocket as the Festival nears: 
not offically, of course, but the cost in bribes and favours can get 
very severe.  Regardless of the offically fixed passenger prices (rumour 
has it that, even in the Wilds, they haven\'t changed a bit!), you only 
see the best and the wealthiest arrive on Antra in time for the Festival.

Festival serves not only as the premiere social event of the subsector, 
but as one of five or six events of sector-wide reputation, and thus a 
location where Things Happen and media attention is guarenteed.  Archduke 
Norris, for example, formally announced the engagement of his daughter 
on Antra.

ATTITUDE TO VISITORS

Despite the waves of visitors to Antra, despite their standing as a 
subsector capital, and despite their A-class port, Antrans are intensely 
xenophobic.  They detest foreginers who don\'t fit into their ways, or 
don\'t understand their arts.  Usually, this loathing is displayed by 
rudeness or by mocking the ignorance of visitors.  The more upper-class 
folk will tend to prefer to use a biting wit, or cruel puns.  The lower 
class Antrans prefer a more direct approach: never giving a visitor the 
benefit of the doubt, shouting down any attempt to offer an opinion, or 
a light beating if a visitor gets too uppity.  Visitors being raped and 
killed in certain neighbourhoods after dark is not unknown.

But vying head to head with this xenophobia is a great fear and respect 
for large organizations.  The Antrans are very aware of how close they 
are to joining a thousand dead worlds, and how badly they need the 
protection of the Regency government.  Thus, often they deny their 
unwarrented actions, or say that it\'s just a joke, or otherwise try to 
soothe the waters.  Their comedies often revolve on how to make a fool of 
visitors, how to hurt them savagely, and yet have the visitors still love you.

Traders should be cautious here: some friction is inevitable, and many 
routine liasion tasks need to be increased one difficulty level.  Always 
be aware that much of the hostility that Antrans feel towards you is 
simply cultural, and can be handled with finesse - or even turned into an 
advantage - if you know what you are doing.  

Also be aware that they do not so much want to kill you has to humiliate 
you, to wound your pride without being hurt in return.  Some traders are 
good enough, and have enough leverage, that they can fight head-to-head 
with the Antrans.  Most - including almost all free traders, who are 
always a cargo-load away from disaster - simply have to take it, in order 
to get that cargo you need.

Sorry: the law level of this world does not allow you to carry any weapons 
off the ship - although at least they don\'t impound them off-ship.

IMMIGRANTS

Of course, not all starship traffic is related to the Festival.  After 
Virus was halted at Catacomb and Deneb, (and several small, sharp battles 
were fought right here) Antra found itself not only having to rebuid from 
Vargr pillaging and stupid stunts (more than one Vargr corsair met it\'s 
end on the Worldroof, weakening it\'s integrity), but also having to 
rewire everything to meet anti-Viral spec\'s.  Also, Antra made very heavy 
use of robots: without them, Antra simply couldn\'t meet the demands that 
rebuilding made.

In the end, Antra - which prides itself on tight population control - had 
to allow massive immigration to provide a workforce.  The population rose 
from 500 million to 700 million, almost all from immigration from nearby 
Uakari (Antra: Deneb/1710 C5349AA-7).  These immigrants are loathed by 
native Antrans, and considered low-brow, low-tech thugs.   They are not 
permitted to bring any family, and workers who get pregnant are given the 
choice of leaving or having an abortion: if they stay, a one-time 
contraceptive is administered to insure sterility, with an antedote given 
when the working women leave.

Despite the fact that they are paid ten times the amount they would earn 
back home, unrest festers in the shantytowns of Antra, kept near the 
industrial towers and far from the tower cities where Antrans live.  
The immigrants hate the veiled (or, often, completly open) contempt and 
hatred that are held in by the xenophobic Antrans, who believe that 
they are doing the Uakari an unmerited, and unthanked, favour.

The immigrants - refered to as "visiting workers" by upper-class Antrans, 
"thugees" by lower-class Antrans, and "toilers" by themselves - are hired 
on one, five, or ten-year workterms, with a continous flow of about 2 
million people either entering or leaving Antra (keeping over 40,000 
subsidized liners employed).  The immigrant workforce has been in decline 
for the last 20 years, and now make up 170 million people: native born 
Antrans and non-computerized machinery have been slowly spqeezing them 
out, and the immigrant workforce is predicted to be all gone in 20 years.

RELIGION

When the first survey ship\'s arrived from Corridor, there were a series 
of egnamic, artifical lines and curves on the earth.  Etched out in black 
stone, and often half a mile wide, they can be seen from low orbit.
They do definitely make out patterns, but no one has ever managed to 
successfuly translate them.

No one knows who made these lines, or can even guess how old they are, 
but the Black Lines are a major factor in the many local beliefs.  The 
largest local religions insists that the lines were made from an ancient 
civilization, trying to tell Antran - who, of all the people of the 
universe, have alone been blessed with the Lines - the secrets of the 
universe.  

Equally dominant in Antran philosophy is evolution, but as a doctrine 
rather than a scientific theory.  This doctrine - never formally 
organized, it has no offical name, but commonly called the Promethians - 
most believe that humaniti, even postCollapse humaniti, is marching on to a 
higher goal, continually evolving themselves to spread their genes and 
power throughout the Universe.  

The Black Liners believe that other human civilizations have 
transended this universe millions of years ago, and that current 
humaniti (including the Zhos, Vilani, and Solomani) are simply walking 
on a well-trod path.  While they certainly don\'t believe in the God of 
the Solomani monotheists, they do believe that there is a guiding Spirit 
of Humaniti over all, and that a glorious unity of souls await\'s us 
after death.

The Promethians, in contrast, does not care for such a soft-headed 
concept as a sweet afterlife, ruled over by kindly spirits, and would 
laugh out loud in contempt at the concept of a stern and conquering Judge, 
weighting the lives of men in the balance.  They do, however, believe 
that we can gain a kind of immortality, not by some impossible 
resurrection, but by doing great and astounding deeds, by 
inspired leadership, by securing a great insight into the nature of 
things that will leave the universe a better place than before.

Both religions are often in contention with each other ("Supersitious 
fables!" vs. "Connect, man! Connect!").  

Both gag at the sight of other religions, esp. Christians ("I 
can\'t believe that ignorant people like you exist in this day and age!", 
"Onward walks the spiritually blind, refusing in their narrowmindedness 
to open their Third Eye, and see the significance of the Lines!")

"WE OURSELVES"

The Antrans area highly extroverted, social, and fanciful people.  Of the 
"Imperial" race (standard Solomani/Vilani parentage), they are only 
ho-hum physically, without the supernatural elegance and perfect 
physique that bioengineering grants most citizens of high-tech worlds.  

They take no particular pride in their status as subsector capital, but 
do take pride in their artistic endeavors.  Their buildings, while not 
particularly \'artistic\', do radiate a certain grace, a certain 
lightness.  Their most famed artist\'s are sometimes quiet, sometimes 
loud, but approach their work with a disiplined hand.  Even third-rate 
artists from Antra are highly valued elsewhere: their command of the 
repitore of Imperial culture is unmatched elsewhere, their intense 
understanding and respect of their audience (even as they recoil at their 
alieness) is known to all.

There are several rituals and notable variations on Antra that should be 
noted by the casual traveller.  
  * Greeting: when two friends meet, they give the standard greeting 
      "Howdo?", then they both circle a point halfway between them in 
      silence. After two revolutions, they clap hands and hug affectionately.
  * Children: Antrans love their children immensely, and enjoy showing 
      them the world they live in.  They happily haul their children to 
      work, to play, to shop, to visit lovers, even to see (and laugh at) 
      visitors.  
    What they *won\'t* allow is for some filthy stranger to touch their 
      children.  Expect serious verbal abuse if you dare do so. 
  * Life: Antra has no native lifeforms, and the locals have chosen to 
      introduce nothing but plants and insects: but (after a chechup) the 
      Antrans will allow animals on the world, as long as they are T-linked.
      (T-links come in two parts: one part goes on the owner\'s body, and 
      the other around the animal\'s neck.  If the animal leaves a certain 
      distance from the owner, it soffers pain: if it crosses another 
      threshhold, it dies.) 
  * Clothing: Antrans have a sharp sense of what look\'s good: often 
      their taste runs to simple and elegant, but many like large and loud.  
      Either way, their clothing is comfortable, loose-fitting and of good 
      quality.  They don\'t go for effect-clothing, but there is a current 
      fad for biolumenescent contact lenses (bright yellow, or Denebian red 
      eyes, is the most desired.) 
  * Food: While the Antrans have good taste everywhere else, they don\'t 
      cut it when it comes to the belley.  Then, they simply want it hot, 
      spicy, and in He-man servings.  Everything else is just a frill.
  * Literacy: Antrans, like most TL C+ societies, are functionally 
      post-literate.  However, old-fashioned bookreading is a growing fad 
      among the elite, and the fad is starting to show up in popular culture.

Regular life is much the same as on other high-tech worlds, with the 
cycle of conception (by whatever means), genetic therapy, birth, infant 
training, carrer selection, child-specific VR education, work, sex, 
ageing, and death.  Marriages are rare (even for a high-tech world), but 
more people choose to raise children than on the typical High Stellar world.
Antrans also place a higher value on "high-brow" culture and sophistication 
rather than focus on simple \'stupid-foreginer\' entertainment like some 
mindless talk show or sitcoms.

The Immigrants, isolated in their shantytowns, live a different life.  
Imagine a vast, dirty-grey tent city, connected by a 
chain of fabric tunnels.  Gangs of shadowy figures, huddled together, 
march from the asture factory towers to their ragged tents, to hide from 
the bitter -20 C cold.  Inside, in a city without children, live the 
hard-bitten men who do the work meant for machines.  Someone will die 
on the job tomorrow when their safety lines finally snap (Antrans don\'t 
waste grav belts on \'trash\': men are far cheaper than grav belts to 
replace), or when their poorly maintained equipment is tested once too 
often. 

However, more deaths occur outside of the factories than inside.  With 
only the most superficial medical care,  a large portion of the workers 
are slowly dying (or going mad, or losing their vision) due to the 
noxious fumes of their work. (Remember, the robots that did the jobs 
before them didn\'t have to worry about breathing, or heat stroke, or the 
pounding noise destroying their eardrums).  Moreover, the largely male 
workers get into endless fights, with handmade guns or knives.  Women 
workers are sometimes left alone, but often are forced to take on a lover 
for protection, or simply for some companionship in their hard life.   

(Note: In many areas, the tent cities are pressurized, connected by a 
maze of fabric tunnels.  Well, they are supposed to be presurized: the 
poor-quality tents they were given is not built to take the damage the 
workers often inflict on it.)

Wow.  I was playing with fusion rocket missiles, but they have to be
14kl instead of the standard 7, and they\'re not nearly as good.  And man
those are cheap.  The TL15 missile given doesn\'t exist, this one is
cheaper, and *much* better----it has commo, and a sensor, so this is a
SIM/FIM, too.

It can get its own lock, as well.  Especially if the target is active...
This is the ARM from hell.  It could be programmed to set up its shot,
and continue on an intercept course.  KKM, or detlaser.

Neat.  And your missile makes missiles a _long range_ weapon again...

Nasty.  If a KKM could hit, it\'d be nasty.  As I recall with no special
submunition other than a 10g (or was it 1 gram?) ball, a given pellet
would do 25 damage points per hex of closing veleocity, and the
penetration increases as well.  It was something like 497-1/222 at
20hexes/turn.

I belive (FFS not in front of me) that it is half the additional armor
for KEAP rounds.  It is quite possible to have a few ton ESA setup
that\'ll give effective armor values in the multiple 10,000s many times
per turn.  Hell, run the thing off the wasted ROF on your meson gun
(where you pay for a huge HPG, and only use 100 out of 800 pulses).  I
think that they can be defeated pretty well, in fact, ESA might have to
be reduced again for space KEAPs since they\'d be going so much faster
than any anti-armor gun.  Since this would be somewhat arbitrary, I\'d go
for trying to make them such that really big ships could get hurt, but
not killed by most KKMs.

PS-on the subject of missile intercepts, I just saw my friend Jason\'s
animation for the new series "Space; Above and Beyond."  Wow.  Wow
again.  He did a great job on a missile hit for the third show... look
at the wreakage of a cargo pod, one side has what looks like a bullet
hole in a tin can.  Looks like it\'ll be fun to watch.

too high.  Then I thought about it again.  I imagine (John, is this
true?) that it was designed using the actual mass, not the mass <15*Vol.
that is in the ship rules.  Under the standard ship rules a gturn is
0.4464% of a ships volume.

I don\'t have any problem with John\'s design using the actual mass...
instead, it got me thinking.

FFS says to correct a design if the mass goes over 15*dtons, right?
Well what about using the actual mass to calculate the gturns after you
get a design done?  Some ships might loose out, but if you made an
effort to make a ship mass less, you\'d get more burns... might be a nice
trade off for a lot of armor.

Doing this the Chrysanthemum DE would go from 54 to almost 64 gturns
(and just shy of 130 with jump fuel).  The actual drive volume, and
power requirements would go down, as well, but I\'d not bother with that
whole reoptimization can-o-worms.  All in all, a quick way to add a
little delta-v to a craft (if it isn\'t too massive).

Lasers and PAWs seem heavy for the volume they take up (around
20tonnes/ton), and MGs are "normal" at ~10 (just off the ones in BL).  I
like the idea of trying to design for mass in spacecraft, and doing it
this way is within the rules (the letter of them instead of the quick
and dirty rule given--they _do_ give the real thrust, why not use it :)

All the HEPlaR stuff is linear math wise, so if the loaded mass is
8472tonnes (the DE above) and the ship is 1000 tons (10,000tonnes std),
just take the % of actual to std. mass tonnage, and get the new gturns
from there (drive, and thrust MWs will stay as they are for simplicity).

					     1
"new" gturns = ("old" gturns) *	----
				(loaded tonnes)/(hullrate*10)

hullrate is the dtons of the ship.

Hey (can you all tell my girlfriend has been out of town for a few
weeks----there\'ll be fewer posts in a week, I promise),

Just as a sideline to the anti-missile thread:

Locking on a missile at sensor short range, regardless of sensor is an
_Impossible_ task if the missile has EMM, it\'s Formidible if it was a
sensor hand off.  One level easier in both cases above without the EMM.

In most cases missiles will go from medium to detonation in a turn.
You\'ll get 1 chance to lock up the missile, more or less, and it\'ll fail
85% of the time with a crack crew.

So your you\'re still toast if your defence kills 100% of the 15% it
actually sees. 

Put a small (only need in the same hex) jammer on a HEPlaR missile at
the expense of a measly few dozen gturns, and it\'ll go past Impossible
to lock it.  Fun, huh?

And all of it in the unmodified rules.

     >>Alternate development routes: Well, the Regency could try to 
     crash-develop it\'s area: instead of rebuilding the Wilds, they can 
     instead up the general tech level of it\'s current area.  Even better 
     if you up the population to equal the Zho population, in a volume of 
     space maybe 1/4 of the Zho\'s.  The reconquest of the Imperium would 
     fit quite nicely in this plan.<<
     
     So are you suggesting that the Regency might want to develop a reverse 
     colonization program?  Encouraging the inhabited planets in the wilds 
     to emigrate _to_ the Regency?  Or encourage fertility among their 
     indigenous populations?
     
     I doubt it.  While the wilds have floundered and billions of people 
     have perished in what once was Imperial space, the Regency has 
     continued to go about their day-to-day business.  This includes having 
     babies and continually increasing the population.  While a large 
     number of scientists (including Carl Sagan, for one) have hypothesized 
     that we cannot develop interstellar travel until we have achieved 
     zero-population growth as a race, there\'s nothing to say that once we 
     _do_ have interstellar travel, we won\'t proceed to overpopulate the 
     planets we colonize.
     
     That said, I don\'t think that most worlds are going to want to beef up 
     their populations to combat the Zhodani threat.  What\'s the point?  
     The technical edge the Regency has over the Zhodani makes the Regency 
     undigestible by the Zhodani.  Surely the stable homogeneous Zhodani 
     wouldn\'t want to upset the balance of their society by undertaking a 
     war so massive that it takes all their resources and upsets the very 
     foundation upon which their society is built.  Even a long-term, more 
     covert war would gobble up huge resources, especially once the 
     trigger-happy Regency gets wind of the scale of such an operation.
     
     Other than importing colonists _from_ the wilds, I don\'t see how the 
     Regency could quickly hyperpopulate their 800 worlds.  And that just 
     doesn\'t seem feasible.  Furthermore, any program to increase fertility 
     or encourage child-rearing won\'t meet favorably with the public.  
     Highly industrialized, modern societies just don\'t increase their 
     populations as quickly as poor underdeveloped ones do.  Most Regency 
     systems, I would guess, fall into the former category.  
     
     I once heard about a public program in Israel that encouraged married 
     couples to have numerous children, in response to reports that the 
     Palestinian population was growing exponentially faster.  I don\'t know 
     how this is going, but I doubt that Israelis are trying to have any 
     more children than they already would have planned on.
     
     >>Question: why should the Regency even strive for it\'s independence 
     from Zho economic & cultural domination?  It could instead forsake 
     rebuilding the Imperium, and just be a comfortable, peaseful client 
     state of the Consulate.  Done right, I bet this could be very 
     comfortable for everyone involved. Just ask the Welsh, the Canadians, 
     the Mongolians, the Darians (the Roman ones, not the Marches version), 
     the Quebecois, or any other client state you care to name.<<
     
     But even more important, why would the Zhodani even strive to 
     _incorporate_ the Regency as a client state or otherwise?
     
     There are several reasons why the Zhodani would not want to.  Among 
     them:
     
     1)  The Zhodani are an extremely orderly and homogeneous society.  
     While Zhodani governments vary as much as Regency or former Imperial 
     governments do, there are several elements that are the same across 
     the board for the Zhodani.  All governments are psionic dominated.  
     And all are ruled by pureblood Zhodani.
     
     2)  The Zhodani are an extremely conservative society.  Expansion 
     throughout history has been orderly and at a uniform rate.  The 
     Zhodani Consulate extends at almost equal distances in all directions 
     from Zhdant because of carefully managed, meticulously governed 
     colonization.  Except for the coreward expeditions that is, but that\'s 
     an anomaly, since those were inspired by a unique Ancient artifact 
     that showed them the way to go.
     
     [Hmm.  What the heck _have_ those Zhos found out there, anyway?!]
     
     3)  The threat of virus still exists.  Why not keep the Regency in its 
     present state as a buffer zone?  Any mass attack into the Regency 
     would tangentially effect the Zhodani as well if they affiliate 
     themselves with the Regency.  You\'ve heard the proverb, "The enemy of 
     my friend is my enemy"?  It applies here.  And I think the Zhos know 
     it.  Better to maintain friendly relations without becoming too 
     involved or committed, lest the Zhodani themselves become embroiled in 
     the mess that was the Imperium.
     
     In short, I believe the status quo is the likely future.  The Zhodani 
     are going to keep to themselves and pursue their coreward expeditions. 
     No wars to fight.  No espionage to become involved with.  Just new 
     worlds to conquer.
     
     If anything, the Zhodani are going to be more congenial with the 
     Regency than they ever have with the region throughout history.
     
     The roleplaying opportunities are enhanced by this since we don\'t just 
     have to view the Zhodani as sneaky guys in the spinward subsectors.  
     They are now both friend and enemy:  goodwill diplomat and espionage 
     agent.

     call the "Spray and Pray" technique of shooting.  I.E., spray lots of 
     lead in the general direction of your enemy and pray that you hit... 
     It is known for being the technique of choice for people who don\'t 
     know how to shoot.<<
     
     And furthermore, automatic fire is particularly useful when firing 
     into a crowd of targets.  Don\'t forget that while you may miss your 
     front line of targets, the rules dictate that for all the shots that 
     missed secondary rolls are made to determine who among the people or 
     objects _behind_ the primary target are hit by stray automatic fire.  
     So while all the shots are at Impossible level, at least you get 
     several shots at hitting multiple targets.
     
     A player\'s best bet is to fire single shots if he wants to hit a small 
     group of targets or bursts if he\'s fighting a squad or more.

Antra, it\'s worldroof one of the Seven Wonders of the Imperium, is a must 
for any tourist of Deneb Sector.  Despite the long, tedious and invading 
antiViral procedures, Antra still is a busy port of call, for it\'s 
artworks and tourism sites, it\'s vast radioactive mines - the 
largest in 25 parsecs - and it\'s political connections.  Still, caution 
is called for when among the xenophobic Antrans, and the beautiful towers 
that support the famed Worldroof is supported by some nasty foundations...

THE ANTIVIRUS RUNAROUND

Situated on the very edge of the Regency/Virus border, the incoming 
traveller can expect Trin-level paranoia. And just as well: if for any 
reason Virus enters the system, the 700 million people of Antra are as 
dead as Dulinor.

Any ship filing a direct flight plan to Antra is immediately pointed to 
the nearest Regency Quarrentine Office.  In cooperation with the  Antran 
government, the RQS keeps a set of specific travel routes and jump 
routines controlling movement within the Antran system, which vary from 
time to time.  The computer module of flight routine for the specific time 
that the traders intend to be in the system is directly plugged into the 
various computer systems of the ship by RQS personnnel, and an RQS  
officer is posted to the ship for the week\'s trip.

Before leaving for Antra, the ship is carefully checked out by an RQS 
team, taking a day per 100 tons displacement.  Everyone is given a 
complete physical examination: noone with artifical inorganic 
enhansements is permitted to continue on the voyage, on pain of death.

When they first arrive from jump the ship follows it\'s pre-computated flight 
plan to a preselected position and vector in space.  The RQS officer on 
board must radio for a RQS cutter to meet them, using a special one-time 
code that only the RQS officer on board knows.
  
NOTE: Antra is within 100 diameters of it\'s primary star: the ship leaves 
jump space between 155 and 355 light-seconds from Antra, depending on 
orbitl mechanics, the skill of the pilot, etc.  With the pre-computed 
jump co-ordinates, the ship always leaves jump exactly opposite of Antra\'s 
position, 355 light-seconds away on the other side of the star.

Ships that do not conform to the specific flight plan must immediately 
kill their velosity, and come to a dead halt.  The people on board must 
put on their space suits and cross over to the RQS cutter.  The ship is 
impounded, and usually considered forfeited to the Antran government if 
free of Virus.  If the ship is found to be infected, the crew have their 
personalities reconstructed.

Ships that don\'t come to a stop, for whatever reason, are destroyed. 

The cutter boards the ship and an RQS team carefully looks it over for Virus.
Since this is a lighter team that the previous base-check, it only takes 
a few hours before the ship is underway again, to a nearby (usually under 
20 light-seconds) RQS space station.

The RQS station - basically an underarmed naval base, designed to take 
on a flotilla of 100 ships of up to 1000 disp tons each - AGAIN 
checks out the ship for Virus.  After about half a day - regardless of 
the size of the ship, the local crew is large, good, well equipped, and fast 
enough to process it in under 12 hours - the ship, without it\'s escort 
but still with it\'s babysitting RQS officer onboard, finally heads for Antra.

Your ship will be halted and inspected 10 light seconds from Antra, not 
by a RQS cutter by a 1000-6000 ton SDB.   

THE WORLDROOF

As you finally approach Antra (at 1G, as per regulations), bathed under the 
dull red light of it\'s star, you start to notice that it seems to be 
largely encased by glass. And when you arrive at the Highport - attached to 
Antra by a 50 km elevator - the vast Worldroof of Antra is revealed in 
all it\'s glory.  It covering over 80% of Antra, composed by a mosaic of 
hexagonal "glass" cells suspended in the air by 1,774  2km high \'tower 
groups\'.  Each \'tower group\' is composed of seven towers: six towers  
supports the roof, generates power (via both capturing a small percent of 
the star\'s radiated energy and the 200-300 km winds), and provides the 
best weather control in the Regency (or for that matter, in the 
preCollapse Imperium).

The seventh tower is either an industrial or residential centre.  
Industrial centres were built with 5,000 inhabitants, residental centres 
- basically tower cities, in a style familiar on high-tech worlds - holds 
up to 500,000 people.

No ship ever lands on Antra: the high-atmosphere winds are both fast and 
fickle, continually shifting to equalize the tempertature between the 
dark and light sides of Antra.  Also, it\'s a security measure by the 
Antrans to again insure that Virus doesn\'t get in. Thus, all transport 
is via the Highport elevator.

(REFEREE: Why doesn\'t the atmosphere flow out of the 20% of the world not 
covered by the Worldroof?  Ask the British Interplanetary Society: 
they\'re the ones who came up with this crazy idea!  The \'high-winds\' 
part is a natural consequence of equalizing the temperatures, and 
moderating the nighttime low to the extent that the Antran want to: it 
should be doable given TL E tech.)

ARRIVING ON ANTRA

All people, articles and cargo is completely checked out by local antiVirus 
teams on the Highport, taking another day. (This includes medical 
examinations: no people with ANY artifical inorganic enhansements is 
permitted insystem.  If caught in this stage of the game, they will be 
killed.)  Another quickie \'make sure\' check is made before leaving the 
elevator, and a final antiViral team awaits to greet the players just as 
they step off the 30 minute journey on the massive elevator, for another 
full check of everyone and everything.

(An entire RICE paper can be written on security procedures within the 
Regency, from the ultra-lax standards in the Seven Sisters to the 
short-and-vicious procedures of Trin, from the short and effective 
procedures of Vincennes to long, bureaucratic and paranoaic restrictions 
for Antra.)

FESTIVAL

The first thing everyone does after arrival is look up at the immense 
hexagonal grid over them. Throughout most of the year, you\'ll only see a 
crystal clear, cloudless sky, faintly outlined with hundreds of hexagons.
In the nighttime, the outlines glow faintly red: but that is all.

But, if you arrived during the two-week Blazing Lights 
Festival, you\'d see some fantastic pattern of lights and graphics in the 
sky, surpassing anything you may have seen in a VR tube.  These Festivals 
have become more and more ornate since the Collapse, now including 
sound\'s and wind patterns specifically created for the artist, generated 
by the weather control system (imagine immense, organ-like sounds 
emminating from the roof and the winds: absolutely overwhelming).

Of course, tickets for Antra tends to skyrocket as the Festival nears: 
not offically, of course, but the cost in bribes and favours can get 
very severe.  Regardless of the offically fixed passenger prices (rumour 
has it that, even in the Wilds, they haven\'t changed a bit!), you only 
see the best and the wealthiest arrive on Antra in time for the Festival.

Festival serves not only as the premiere social event of the subsector, 
but as one of five or six events of sector-wide reputation, and thus a 
location where Things Happen and media attention is guarenteed.  Archduke 
Norris, for example, formally announced the engagement of his daughter 
on Antra.

ATTITUDE TO VISITORS

Despite the waves of visitors to Antra, despite their standing as a 
subsector capital, and despite their A-class port, Antrans are intensely 
xenophobic.  They detest foreginers who don\'t fit into their ways, or 
don\'t understand their arts.  Usually, this loathing is displayed by 
rudeness or by mocking the ignorance of visitors.  The more upper-class 
folk will tend to prefer to use a biting wit, or cruel puns.  The lower 
class Antrans prefer a more direct approach: never giving a visitor the 
benefit of the doubt, shouting down any attempt to offer an opinion, or 
a light beating if a visitor gets too uppity.  Visitors being raped and 
killed in certain neighbourhoods after dark is not unknown.

But vying head to head with this xenophobia is a great fear and respect 
for large organizations.  The Antrans are very aware of how close they 
are to joining a thousand dead worlds, and how badly they need the 
protection of the Regency government.  Thus, often they deny their 
unwarrented actions, or say that it\'s just a joke, or otherwise try to 
soothe the waters.  Their comedies often revolve on how to make a fool of 
visitors, how to hurt them savagely, and yet have the visitors still love you.

Traders should be cautious here: some friction is inevitable, and many 
routine liasion tasks need to be increased one difficulty level.  Always 
be aware that much of the hostility that Antrans feel towards you is 
simply cultural, and can be handled with finesse - or even turned into an 
advantage - if you know what you are doing.  

Also be aware that they do not so much want to kill you has to humiliate 
you, to wound your pride without being hurt in return.  Some traders are 
good enough, and have enough leverage, that they can fight head-to-head 
with the Antrans.  Most - including almost all free traders, who are 
always a cargo-load away from disaster - simply have to take it, in order 
to get that cargo you need.

Sorry: the law level of this world does not allow you to carry any weapons 
off the ship - although at least they don\'t impound them off-ship.

IMMIGRANTS

Of course, not all starship traffic is related to the Festival.  After 
Virus was halted at Catacomb and Deneb, (and several small, sharp battles 
were fought right here) Antra found itself not only having to rebuid from 
Vargr pillaging and stupid stunts (more than one Vargr corsair met it\'s 
end on the Worldroof, weakening it\'s integrity), but also having to 
rewire everything to meet anti-Viral spec\'s.  Also, Antra made very heavy 
use of robots: without them, Antra simply couldn\'t meet the demands that 
rebuilding made.

In the end, Antra - which prides itself on tight population control - had 
to allow massive immigration to provide a workforce.  The population rose 
from 500 million to 700 million, almost all from immigration from nearby 
Uakari (Antra: Deneb/1710 C5349AA-7).  These immigrants are loathed by 
native Antrans, and considered low-brow, low-tech thugs.   They are not 
permitted to bring any family, and workers who get pregnant are given the 
choice of leaving or having an abortion: if they stay, a one-time 
contraceptive is administered to insure sterility, with an antedote given 
when the working women leave.

Despite the fact that they are paid ten times the amount they would earn 
back home, unrest festers in the shantytowns of Antra, kept near the 
industrial towers and far from the tower cities where Antrans live.  
The immigrants hate the veiled (or, often, completly open) contempt and 
hatred that are held in by the xenophobic Antrans, who believe that 
they are doing the Uakari an unmerited, and unthanked, favour.

The immigrants - refered to as "visiting workers" by upper-class Antrans, 
"thugees" by lower-class Antrans, and "toilers" by themselves - are hired 
on one, five, or ten-year workterms, with a continous flow of about 2 
million people either entering or leaving Antra (keeping over 40,000 
subsidized liners employed).  The immigrant workforce has been in decline 
for the last 20 years, and now make up 170 million people: native born 
Antrans and non-computerized machinery have been slowly spqeezing them 
out, and the immigrant workforce is predicted to be all gone in 20 years.

RELIGION

When the first survey ship\'s arrived from Corridor, there were a series 
of egnamic, artifical lines and curves on the earth.  Etched out in black 
stone, and often half a mile wide, they can be seen from low orbit.
They do definitely make out patterns, but no one has ever managed to 
successfuly translate them.

No one knows who made these lines, or can even guess how old they are, 
but the Black Lines are a major factor in the many local beliefs.  The 
largest local religions insists that the lines were made from an ancient 
civilization, trying to tell Antran - who, of all the people of the 
universe, have alone been blessed with the Lines - the secrets of the 
universe.  

Equally dominant in Antran philosophy is evolution, but as a doctrine 
rather than a scientific theory.  This doctrine - never formally 
organized, it has no offical name, but commonly called the Promethians - 
most believe that humaniti, even postCollapse humaniti, is marching on to a 
higher goal, continually evolving themselves to spread their genes and 
power throughout the Universe.  

The Black Liners believe that other human civilizations have 
transended this universe millions of years ago, and that current 
humaniti (including the Zhos, Vilani, and Solomani) are simply walking 
on a well-trod path.  While they certainly don\'t believe in the God of 
the Solomani monotheists, they do believe that there is a guiding Spirit 
of Humaniti over all, and that a glorious unity of souls await\'s us 
after death.

The Promethians, in contrast, does not care for such a soft-headed 
concept as a sweet afterlife, ruled over by kindly spirits, and would 
laugh out loud in contempt at the concept of a stern and conquering Judge, 
weighting the lives of men in the balance.  They do, however, believe 
that we can gain a kind of immortality, not by some impossible 
resurrection, but by doing great and astounding deeds, by 
inspired leadership, by securing a great insight into the nature of 
things that will leave the universe a better place than before.

Both religions are often in contention with each other ("Supersitious 
fables!" vs. "Connect, man! Connect!").  

Both gag at the sight of other religions, esp. Christians ("I 
can\'t believe that ignorant people like you exist in this day and age!", 
"Onward walks the spiritually blind, refusing in their narrowmindedness 
to open their Third Eye, and see the significance of the Lines!")

"WE OURSELVES"

The Antrans area highly extroverted, social, and fanciful people.  Of the 
"Imperial" race (standard Solomani/Vilani parentage), they are only 
ho-hum physically, without the supernatural elegance and perfect 
physique that bioengineering grants most citizens of high-tech worlds.  

They take no particular pride in their status as subsector capital, but 
do take pride in their artistic endeavors.  Their buildings, while not 
particularly \'artistic\', do radiate a certain grace, a certain 
lightness.  Their most famed artist\'s are sometimes quiet, sometimes 
loud, but approach their work with a disiplined hand.  Even third-rate 
artists from Antra are highly valued elsewhere: their command of the 
repitore of Imperial culture is unmatched elsewhere, their intense 
understanding and respect of their audience (even as they recoil at their 
alieness) is known to all.

There are several rituals and notable variations on Antra that should be 
noted by the casual traveller.  
  * Greeting: when two friends meet, they give the standard greeting 
      "Howdo?", then they both circle a point halfway between them in 
      silence. After two revolutions, they clap hands and hug affectionately.
  * Children: Antrans love their children immensely, and enjoy showing 
      them the world they live in.  They happily haul their children to 
      work, to play, to shop, to visit lovers, even to see (and laugh at) 
      visitors.  
    What they *won\'t* allow is for some filthy stranger to touch their 
      children.  Expect serious verbal abuse if you dare do so. 
  * Life: Antra has no native lifeforms, and the locals have chosen to 
      introduce nothing but plants and insects: but (after a chechup) the 
      Antrans will allow animals on the world, as long as they are T-linked.
      (T-links come in two parts: one part goes on the owner\'s body, and 
      the other around the animal\'s neck.  If the animal leaves a certain 
      distance from the owner, it soffers pain: if it crosses another 
      threshhold, it dies.) 
  * Clothing: Antrans have a sharp sense of what look\'s good: often 
      their taste runs to simple and elegant, but many like large and loud.  
      Either way, their clothing is comfortable, loose-fitting and of good 
      quality.  They don\'t go for effect-clothing, but there is a current 
      fad for biolumenescent contact lenses (bright yellow, or Denebian red 
      eyes, is the most desired.) 
  * Food: While the Antrans have good taste everywhere else, they don\'t 
      cut it when it comes to the belley.  Then, they simply want it hot, 
      spicy, and in He-man servings.  Everything else is just a frill.
  * Literacy: Antrans, like most TL C+ societies, are functionally 
      post-literate.  However, old-fashioned bookreading is a growing fad 
      among the elite, and the fad is starting to show up in popular culture.

Regular life is much the same as on other high-tech worlds, with the 
cycle of conception (by whatever means), genetic therapy, birth, infant 
training, carrer selection, child-specific VR education, work, sex, 
ageing, and death.  Marriages are rare (even for a high-tech world), but 
more people choose to raise children than on the typical High Stellar world.
Antrans also place a higher value on "high-brow" culture and sophistication 
rather than focus on simple \'stupid-foreginer\' entertainment like some 
mindless talk show or sitcoms.

The Immigrants, isolated in their shantytowns, live a different life.  
Imagine a vast, dirty-grey tent city, connected by a 
chain of fabric tunnels.  Gangs of shadowy figures, huddled together, 
march from the asture factory towers to their ragged tents, to hide from 
the bitter -20 C cold.  Inside, in a city without children, live the 
hard-bitten men who do the work meant for machines.  Someone will die 
on the job tomorrow when their safety lines finally snap (Antrans don\'t 
waste grav belts on \'trash\': men are far cheaper than grav belts to 
replace), or when their poorly maintained equipment is tested once too 
often. 

However, more deaths occur outside of the factories than inside.  With 
only the most superficial medical care,  a large portion of the workers 
are slowly dying (or going mad, or losing their vision) due to the 
noxious fumes of their work. (Remember, the robots that did the jobs 
before them didn\'t have to worry about breathing, or heat stroke, or the 
pounding noise destroying their eardrums).  Moreover, the largely male 
workers get into endless fights, with handmade guns or knives.  Women 
workers are sometimes left alone, but often are forced to take on a lover 
for protection, or simply for some companionship in their hard life.   

(Note: In many areas, the tent cities are pressurized, connected by a 
maze of fabric tunnels.  Well, they are supposed to be presurized: the 
poor-quality tents they were given is not built to take the damage the 
workers often inflict on it.)

Wow.  I was playing with fusion rocket missiles, but they have to be
14kl instead of the standard 7, and they\'re not nearly as good.  And man
those are cheap.  The TL15 missile given doesn\'t exist, this one is
cheaper, and *much* better----it has commo, and a sensor, so this is a
SIM/FIM, too.

It can get its own lock, as well.  Especially if the target is active...
This is the ARM from hell.  It could be programmed to set up its shot,
and continue on an intercept course.  KKM, or detlaser.

Neat.  And your missile makes missiles a _long range_ weapon again...

Nasty.  If a KKM could hit, it\'d be nasty.  As I recall with no special
submunition other than a 10g (or was it 1 gram?) ball, a given pellet
would do 25 damage points per hex of closing veleocity, and the
penetration increases as well.  It was something like 497-1/222 at
20hexes/turn.

I belive (FFS not in front of me) that it is half the additional armor
for KEAP rounds.  It is quite possible to have a few ton ESA setup
that\'ll give effective armor values in the multiple 10,000s many times
per turn.  Hell, run the thing off the wasted ROF on your meson gun
(where you pay for a huge HPG, and only use 100 out of 800 pulses).  I
think that they can be defeated pretty well, in fact, ESA might have to
be reduced again for space KEAPs since they\'d be going so much faster
than any anti-armor gun.  Since this would be somewhat arbitrary, I\'d go
for trying to make them such that really big ships could get hurt, but
not killed by most KKMs.

PS-on the subject of missile intercepts, I just saw my friend Jason\'s
animation for the new series "Space; Above and Beyond."  Wow.  Wow
again.  He did a great job on a missile hit for the third show... look
at the wreakage of a cargo pod, one side has what looks like a bullet
hole in a tin can.  Looks like it\'ll be fun to watch.

too high.  Then I thought about it again.  I imagine (John, is this
true?) that it was designed using the actual mass, not the mass <15*Vol.
that is in the ship rules.  Under the standard ship rules a gturn is
0.4464% of a ships volume.

I don\'t have any problem with John\'s design using the actual mass...
instead, it got me thinking.

FFS says to correct a design if the mass goes over 15*dtons, right?
Well what about using the actual mass to calculate the gturns after you
get a design done?  Some ships might loose out, but if you made an
effort to make a ship mass less, you\'d get more burns... might be a nice
trade off for a lot of armor.

Doing this the Chrysanthemum DE would go from 54 to almost 64 gturns
(and just shy of 130 with jump fuel).  The actual drive volume, and
power requirements would go down, as well, but I\'d not bother with that
whole reoptimization can-o-worms.  All in all, a quick way to add a
little delta-v to a craft (if it isn\'t too massive).

Lasers and PAWs seem heavy for the volume they take up (around
20tonnes/ton), and MGs are "normal" at ~10 (just off the ones in BL).  I
like the idea of trying to design for mass in spacecraft, and doing it
this way is within the rules (the letter of them instead of the quick
and dirty rule given--they _do_ give the real thrust, why not use it :)

All the HEPlaR stuff is linear math wise, so if the loaded mass is
8472tonnes (the DE above) and the ship is 1000 tons (10,000tonnes std),
just take the % of actual to std. mass tonnage, and get the new gturns
from there (drive, and thrust MWs will stay as they are for simplicity).

					     1
"new" gturns = ("old" gturns) *	----
				(loaded tonnes)/(hullrate*10)

hullrate is the dtons of the ship.

Hey (can you all tell my girlfriend has been out of town for a few
weeks----there\'ll be fewer posts in a week, I promise),

Just as a sideline to the anti-missile thread:

Locking on a missile at sensor short range, regardless of sensor is an
_Impossible_ task if the missile has EMM, it\'s Formidible if it was a
sensor hand off.  One level easier in both cases above without the EMM.

In most cases missiles will go from medium to detonation in a turn.
You\'ll get 1 chance to lock up the missile, more or less, and it\'ll fail
85% of the time with a crack crew.

So your you\'re still toast if your defence kills 100% of the 15% it
actually sees. 

Put a small (only need in the same hex) jammer on a HEPlaR missile at
the expense of a measly few dozen gturns, and it\'ll go past Impossible
to lock it.  Fun, huh?

And all of it in the unmodified rules.

The Virus, by a long shot.

The Rebellion casualties can be figured out 
somewhat using the MT supplement _Hard Times_,
but the Virus effects are much harsher.

This can be backed up with detailed examples,
but you asked for a "quick" answer. :-)

Semi-officially known as an ASSTO, "Almost Single Stage To Orbit" vehicle, the Early Bird requires only tanker support and a 2000 meter runway to reach orbit carrying a 15,000 kg payload. A common sight on low-tech worlds,it serves a variety of purposes, including satellite launch and maintenance, suborbital transport, space strike, 
and orbital interface shuttle.
To achieve orbit, the EB lifts off carrying enough fuel 
to rendez-vous with an airborne tanker at approx. 20 km 
altidtude and 900 km/h. This puts it above 85% of the atmosphere of a Terran-type world, thus greatly reducing 
the energy need to achieve LO. At this time, over 45 tons 
of fuel are transferred to the EB\'s drop tanks, while  afterburners are used to maintain altitude. When the fuel transfer is complete, the EB breaks away and begins to 
build up velocity and altitude using ramjets as well as its afterburner-equipped turbofan. When one-third of the fuel is 
emptied, one of the outboard droptanks is jettisoned. At this point, a special flap is used to compensate for the assymetric droptanks. When the turbofan begins to lose 
power it is shut down, and the EB relies solely on scramjet propulsion. As each successive drop tank is emptied it is jettisoned. The final exo-atmospheric insertion and deorbit burns are carried out using a liquid-fueled rocket. After deorbiting, the shuttle retains only approximately 500kg fuel for the turbofan to use during the landing phase.

Comment: OK, so with a lot of squeezing and fiddling it is
possible to get this thing to work. However, if you use the standard rules (FF&S, p 71) you will discover that this design produces only about 0.2 G-Hours from the ramjet/rocket. However, there is enough room to fuel the turbofan for several hours before refueling - thus producing as much as 0.6 G-Hours with the turbofan alone. This is not a good rule. Therefore I have applied the following rule changes;
a)`The 0.64 G-Hours requirement is scrapped - I use the < 10km/sec to orbit from the RealWorld (tm). 
b)Since the actual orbital burn starts from high altitude, most of the loss due to the atmosphere is neglected. 

This is not really the optimal way to treat this type of problem - it would be better to redesign the thrusters available, and add a more accurate table of the to-orbit
velocity requirements. Perhaps when I get the time, i.e. the summer of 2032 or so...

The Traveller Cronicle is a "Magazine devoted to traveller in all its 
forms" published by Kevin Knight of Sword of the Knight Publications. 
 It is now released three times a year but from what I understand, 
submissions are low and he needs Traveller fans to send in their 
articles.  You can reach Kevin at:
2820 Sunset Lane # 116  Henderson, 
KY 42420-2084. (502) 826-1218
 His e-mail address is swrdknght@aol.com and there is 
a web page at  http://eeyore.lv-hrc.nevada.edu/~indy/traveller.html
Issue 8 was recently released and I think he has back issues 
availible.
As far as I know anything now published by Challenge (and those 
published in the Chronicle) remain the property of the writer/artist. 
 
By the way, tell Kevin that  Nathan sent you :)

Ok, so Virus killed more people than 14 years of war. Yet when it struck
most areas of the Imperium were already known as Wilds, with hundreds of 
blasted, dying worlds. True, the safe areas were still high-tech, but 
they were quite small by 1130. It would seem to me that those worlds that
were so fragile that they would die without interstellar trade and high 
technology (all your asteroid belts, and high pop worlds on uninhabitable
rocks) would already have died once the nukes started flying. This at least
holds true for the non-Safe areas. The Virus only made recovery impossible.

Also, as a reality check - what would Virus do if unleashed on 1995 Terra?
Well, I can imagine the following; trash the Internet, trash the phone
system, and severly damage the power grid. GPS wouldn\'t work, and this 
might affect some airliners for a time. THese effects would NOT be enough
to plunge Terra into the Stone age. If the Virus mangaged to get into 
military computers (which I assume it would - this is a SMART bug) it 
might certainly cause some tension. But again, I doubt that it could 
start a nuclear exchange. If you are familiar at all with military 
computers you will know why - they are mostly from the 1950s and 60s. 
This is particularly true with Minuteman launch control systems and the like.
Another effect would be economic - the NYSE and others would cease to 
function. 
In summary, Virus woudl cause another great depression, perhaps even 
a limited nuclear exchange ( NOT total MAD). But we would not plunge us
into a new Dark Age. Why would we then expect this to be any different 
with other TL-8 worlds ? 

No, what could and would damage Terra would be a nuclear attack from
space on all the major industrial centres and space ports and the like.
Something that was quite common in the 1120s... The consquences could 
easily cause collapse to TL-1 or so. (you are certainly familiar with 
the scenario; Mad Max, Waterworld, terminator, even Twilight;2000)
resulting in what is now so common in the Wilds. 

Now, it thus seems that while the most deaths might well have been caused 
by Virus killing every last human in high-pop, high-tech, unlivable worlds,
the horrors of those times and places died with the people that lived there.
The survivors that form the New Era all came from worlds where Virus may
have been just one of many curses brought on by the Rebellion. Equal damage
will quite probably have been done by tha ravages of War - economic collaps,
loved ones killed, battles and orbital bombardment. As well as perhapse
other weapons I think would have been used - biological above all.

How is this as food for thought and talk?

It is my opinion that the history of the Traveller Universe is quite
impossible unless one assumes that the vast majority of all starfaring
races practice population control for most of the time. And that includes
the aslans.

Consider a moderate sized new colony of 10.000. Give it an average population
increase of 3% per annum (I admit I don\'t remember just where I got that 
figure. I used it for years in my fantasy Great Game; I\'m sure I based it
on something. Anyway, it dosen\'t seem excessively high for unlimited 
population growth. Indeed, humans would be capable of a lot more than
that, but we have to account for the odd plague, famine and war too.) Well,
you\'d reach 115 _billion_ people in just 550 years. The Rule of Man had that
long. The Imperium had twice that (and once more if you count the Sylean
Federation before it). The First Imperium expanded for 3-4000 years and then
stayed within the same borders for 10 times that. They most certainly must
have practiced population control. The Aslans had 1800 years of relatively 
uncontested expansion during the Long Night. If they had expanded completely
uncontrolled for that long they would be covering Charted Space like a coat 
of paint by now.

Mind you, on some planets, at some times, population expansion must have
been less restricted. The same economic factors that makes exporting people
in large numbers such an economic headache will, of course, restrict
_importing_ people equally. So all the people on high-population worlds must 
be mostly "home-grown". But this must be a phase that new colonies go through 
and abandon. Consider Mora. We are told that Mora was settled by a "large-
scale" effort. Just how large "large-scale" is is not defined, but let\'s
assume that the original colony was a million strong. Given an average
population increase of 3% per annum they\'d reach 10 billion in just over
300 years. If they kept that up unchecked until 1110 they\'d reach 130
quintillion (that\'s 130,000,000,000,000,000,000) (Gee, exponential growth
can be a frightening thing...)

Btw. I once calculated (based on TCS budgets) that Aslans could afford to
outfit 1.8% of each generation (that\'s 1,8% per 30 years, not per year) as
_ihatei_. Not a significant population relief.

I haven\'t included a TL 13 design when it would be quite like the TL 12. If 
you strain the design concept, you may manage to design a TL-13 missile with 
a HEPLAR.

For truly effective FF missiles you need a long range sensor. Either passive 
or active. But look at the prices. When the cost gets this high, it doesn\'t 
matter if you use a cheap kinetic warhead or a det-laser.

Besides the senario described a few digests ago doesn\'t make sense. Missiles 
are launched at 30+ hexes range and the firing unit runs. OK this far hadn\'t 
it been for the missiles been rated with a 1Hex PEMS. The PEMS won\'t have 
much to home in on if the target pops a few decoys and remain silent. To 
amend this the firing unit must remain where it is and control the missiles 
in towards their target, until the missiles sensor get a fair chance to lock 
onto their target.

You don\'t need the Commo since the warhead includes it.

Why is the HEPlaR so big?  Shouldn\'t be .35714% of volume per g like all
other HEPlaRs?  I get vol=.125kl for a 5g HEPlaR on a 1/2 ton ship.  The
missile needs 0.25MW/g, 1.25MW for 5gs, so .125kl for drive.

If it\'s because it\'s over 15*tons, then shouldn\'t it be a little less
than twicw as big as the .125 if it massed-in at the right level?

Also, I don\'t have FFS in front of me, but I guess there\'s a *huge*
difference in PP mass per kl at TL14 as opposed to 15.  It might make TL
14 missiles of this sort have to be like 1 ton to be effective.

Pretty true, the 1.2 MCr for the laser looks cheaper with a pricey
sensor on board.

It makes sense when you have a missile that can move the detection range
the turn it\'s launched.  The missile Muir designed, and I\'ve been
playing around with ends up like 25g115 with a PEMS and EMM, and
armor/internal structure.  Ditch the internal structure requirement and
it\'ll do 40g1?? no problem as the limiting factor becomes the mass of
BSD to brace the sucker for high gs.  So the target can\'t run.  He also
assumed that the missile corvette was painting the target with its
(upgraded) 16 hex AEMS.  The missile used the AEMS short range since the
target was locked and painted.  Under the standard rules it wouldn\'t hit
the turn it was launched as a FIM, it\'d have to move to range zero, then
keep with the target (while evading :) til it gets its own lock (it
could be a SIM and controlled, or it could follow a bogey til it locks
it).

Regardless, with HEPlaR missiles can be the controlled type and be the
longest ranged weapons in the game, and hit the turn launched (depending
on the design----easy if you go to a 1 ton bay missile).  Missiles are
effectively direct fire weapons at much longer ranges than lasers, et
al. 

I think the High Guard canon would start being mimiced here.  In BR
I have missiles do their real damage (500kt does 3 in BR) and 1d6 hits,
but have multiple negative damage hits add up to a temp hit to duplicate
the cumulative effect of many lesser attacks.  The same could be done
for other weapons.  I toyed with adding a DM to the damage roll (I
always roll since there aren\'t nearly enough chits) so they\'d do sensor
hits more since sensors are easiest to scrape off.

At direct fire ranges, forcing the target to be quiet means he won\'t
lock you (assuming no house sensor rules), and you\'ll get to shoot at
him until the missiles aren\'t a threat----and with 100 some odd gturns to
play with that might be a while.  In the mean time, you\'ve locked him
and are shooting.  

With house rules for sensors, you\'ll paint him and hit, or he\'ll launch missiles
at you as ARMs, and you\'ll have to stop painting the target.  Since an evading 
missile with EMM _cannot_ be locked onto, that might be the only defence----and 
it\'s one that works in aircraft BVR engagements now. If you\'re painting a target
for a Sparrow and the bad guy shoots a fox at you, you have to fight the 
missile or die.  That or play chicken and see if your missile kills him before 
his can kill you.  Dangerous game.

Down at lower tech levels, you can make nearly as nasty
long range / high performance missiles using double size
missiles and fusion rocket powerplants.  Make the missiles
13.5 m^3, do the thrust calculations using actual mass etc,
they are still theoretically the same target size class as 
the 7 m^3 missiles (sub-ton).  I have some designs doing better
than 8/40 performance.

The minimum size of the fusion rocket drives the overall size
(min thrust is 100 tonnes, at 9 tonnes/m^3 you get 11.1 m^3
of powerplant...).  Once it\'s that big, it might as well be
13.5 m^3.  Fortunately, the fusion rocket needs no power plant
and is more fuel effecient than HEPLAR, so you still get very
good performance in the missile.

Re: the missles presented in the last issue - they\'re pretty neat. It seems
they, along with the missle presented by Muir, are becoming a highly 
dangerous threat to all  non-missle designs.  So, it\'s time for some 
countermeasures. 
However, since I don\'t have access to BL or BR yet (a money thing) I 
will merely suggest a few things, and leave the rule-dependent details
to those who have the time or interest to deal with them..

first, a small self-defence laser; Using TL-14 non-grav focussed X-ray
lasers you can produce a system with 800 shots/turn and a 3-hex short
range that masses under about three tons (I\'m working from memory so 
forgive any inaccuracies heer, please). with a discharge energy of 30 Mj
it wont cause very much damage - but I would think enough to knock out 
a missle (more on that in a sec). However, the problem is that the laser 
consumes 17 MW. Not good. So I can see several fixes; aa) use a large HPG to 
store up energy when not firing other weapons, or b) use a chemical laser.
This last assumes that you can make a n X-ray Chemical Laser. (Not as  
silly as you might think - there is research going on as we speak involving 
Xenon clusters, I think it is) The chemical laser has an ROF of 1/sc or better, and each cartridge masses 20 kg. so you use a lot of chemicals but it 
will be a useful point-defence system, since no matter how fast the missle is 
it willbe vulnerable to at least one salvo. Unless it is a masked missle I suppose.
Now, a while back someone argued that you have to vaporize a KKM to make it harmless - NOT SO. If you knock out it\'s guidance system or maneuver system (that large, sensitive PEMS seeker head has _got_ to be sensitive) it won\'t hit. Sure
it will coast right along at you, but if it\'s more than a few seconds away when knoocked out, your ship will have moved by the time the KKM gets to you.
Ditto for the DetLaser, not to mention what a few Mj of laser energy will do to the
very accurately machined pointing mchanism in the missle warhead.

more food for thought; what happens to a missle when it encounters a cloud of
sand while travelling at a few km/sec?

Another question; has anyone considered (i.e. made and tested rules for) 
bistatic active sensors (i.e. the emitter in one place, the dtector somewheer else) Just the thing to combine the advantages of active EMS with hiding.

Yet another idea dreamed up during the cold war - creating a  very bright 
pulse of broadband emission, and them looking at the reflections. In otherwords,
set off a special nuke, and look for targets in the flash...

it\'s sci-fi, in other words, any crayz idea you can think up that _might_ work
has been tested, evaluated, and probably done...

        I may be missing something here, but where\'s the guidance
electronics on these designs and the others published recently? Or is that

	I think you\'re right...I think that the effects of Virus have been 
overstated WRT the damage from the rebellion. This was an Imperium 
wide war, with \'billions dying in nuclear holocausts\' according to 
somewhere in the TNE manual.  The economic disruptions are also not 
to be discounted.  The main fronts of the rebellion took place in the 
heart of the Imperium, where the population density, the tech levels 
and (probably) the economic interdependence were highest. You don\'t 
need to get hit by many nukes if you\'re on a Hi pop industrial world 
largely dependent on imports for food, raw materials, etc. If your 
markets are closed off or gone due to war, where do you sell your 
goods? Things were crashing hard long before the Virus struck.

	Some spectacular losses could be due to Virus (Trin, for example),

injurious.

	By sheer coincidence I was working on this just yesterday, as an
adventure seed, or rather, an ongoing Virus NPC.  I\'m working on a
draft of biowarfare generation tables, and have to look a bit more
into my old microbiology texts, and come up with some stuff on just
exactly what kinds of wepons would /could be used in biological
warfare in the shattered imperium.  Plagues infecting humans,
certainly, but what about tailored fungi that feed on ....saaaay
room temp superconductors (If it was good enough for Larry Niven,
it\'s good enough for me), or blights that destroy food crops.
Bacteria that eat commonly used starship seal material, other nasty
little things.

	I have looked through my materials at hand and haven\'t found 
anything regarding diseases in Traveller, certainly nothing like what 
would be used as biowarfare.  Certainly a high tech level society 
could fight off any number of diseases, but one that was already 
struggling economically, where people were already weakened by 
malnutrition or radiation sickness.

	Well, when I get the thing worked up I\'ll post it.

    'body' => 'Hi all,
	I see that we are all using slightly different variant rules to 
design Heplar missiles, so I\'ll just throw out my own assumptions for 
purposes of comparison.
	I calculated the MV of a 1/2 ton missile and it comes out to 
.2kl.  I use full internal bracing for max G rating.  For hull plating I 
scale up the armor on the missiles given in the rules for max Gs.  
According to errata posted to this list, missiles with conventional 
thrusters have the following armor values:

(Addition): Under section "C. Space Missiles," add the
 following sentence to the end of subsection "9. Determine Max Gs
 per Turn":

 _Round all fractions down for final G rating._
 (Addition): For both atmospheric and space rockets and
 missiles, the armor value of the missile\'s airframe skin is
 dependent upon fuel type and tech level.

 Fuel Type    TL 5-6  TL 7  TL 8+
 Liquid Fuel  0.5     1     2
 Solid Fuel   1       2     3

	So if Eaplac can do 12 Gs and be armored at 3, then to be able to
protect against space junk of the same mass, my missiles armor will have
to increase with the square of velocity because KE=.5mv^2.  Thus, AV=
3*(max G/12)^2.  This was originally suggested to me by Merrick, but in
his last post he didn\'t appear to be using it. Lastly, I compute max Gs 
by dividing thrust by the missiles actual mass, rather than something 
based on displacement.  I think this makes Heplar missiles closest in 
design sequence and trade-offs to conventional missiles, rather than 
small spacecraft. When done this way, Heplar missiles are also a lot less 
scary.  I\'ll post my latest design after I clean it up, but basically, 
the bracing and hull plating heavies the thing down so much thata 7kl 
missile has performance of about 25/25.  It is comforting to me that a 
design sequence which I consider most realistic also produces missiles 
which are not game-balance destroying.
	Merrick has proposed putting EMM on missiles and having them 
evade on the way to the target, which makes them almost impossible to 
lock.  A question, how do you propose to get the missile to engage 
if it is beyond the 10-hex control range limit?  This also begs the 
question of the invisible missile, which, by BL rules, is essentially 
impossible to get a target lock on.

>-Merrick

	I like missiles too :-), but I also have an idea to make them 
easier to lock which I think is a bit more systematic, though it does 
involve more house rules.
	I propose that we create two new range band for sensors, called
Close and Point Blank. Close range would be .5 * Short and lock-ons would
be an Easy task.  Point Blank (PB) would be .25*Short and lock-ons would 
be Easy-1 task, with the -1 only coming into play to counteract positive 
DMs the missile may have due to EMM or evading.  Sensor tasks would look 
like this: 
		_RANGE_				_DIFFICULTY_
		Point Blank	(.25*SR)	Easy -1
		Close		(.5*SR)		Easy
		Short		(SR)		Average
		Medium		(2*SR)		Difficult
		Long		(4*SR)		Formidable
		Extreme		(8*SR)		Impossible

	IMHO, this is more of a logical extension of the existing rules.

P.S. To the author of the recent RICE paper featuring the "World Roof":  
All I can say is "Wow."  That was, IMHO the most evocative RICE paper 
that this list has seen.  Considering the generally high quality of RICE 
papers, this is an impressive accomplishment.

In the case of a det-laser missile the commo and pointer for the lasing
rods are built into the warhead.  If you do any other type you have to
throw all that glop in (as well as if you wish to have a real sensor).

There was a note from someone about active/passive sensor use.  The
short answer is it\'s in my sensor rules----but I didn\'t use nukes as
flashbulbs.  Since there are whiteouts, that\'d be a cool idea,
especially for players (I like the idea of a PC getting that lightbulb
over their head :-)

The 10L commo for the missiles is a _short range_, so it\'s possible out
to 80.
 
And with EMM they are _Impossible_ (the task) to lock, with any
successful evasion they cannot be locked.  If a missile is fired inside
a certain range (depending on the missiles total gturns) it can evade so
as to be unlockable.  The only defense is to break the missile\'s lock.

This will be added to my sensor rules.  It still won\'t stop "invisible"
missiles, but it\'ll limit KKMs.

Here are some I\'ve been playing with.  The HEPlaR one at 7kl is
basically Muir\'s design run through my spreadsheet (with 2 different
versions).


Here\'s a dump of some various missiles from my spreadsheet, the important stuff is at the end of each listing.  1/2 ton missiles are assumed to have a MV of 0.2

I armored them to gs/12*3, and they are fully braced for full gs (Internal 
Structure).  I guess the TL 9 one is old, \'cause it isn\'t armored or
braced.

I assume that the multi-warhead ones will be spinning, and spread the
nukes out a bit like mines.

A very astute comment, Hans.  I say this because I agree completely.

Population growth in the Traveller universe has always been a problem for
me.  I have resigned myself to believing that birth control in the Trav
future is absolute, and in my own universe citizens on high population
planets have little or no right to choose if and when they want children.  I
do this regardless of law level (with some exceptions), because an 8.45e11
population on a size 4 planet will probably have population controlled by
government already entrenched in the culture.  What one culture sees as a
right of the individual can easily be seen as a privilige in the eyes of a
stranger.

There was a similar conversation on population control in
rec.arts.sf.science.  One calculation figured that assuming 
 (1) a healthy planet could sustain a population of 100 billion people
 (2) each of the 1e11 stars in the galaxy had one healthy planet in orbit
 (3) the population of a planet doubles after 25 years
 (4) immigration from one planet to another is free and instantaneous
(something the people of Mora couldn\'t do)

The result would be:

There is obviously something going on in the Traveller history, not
mentioned in the rules, that is preventing this population explosion.  I
think precise, inexpensive birth control explains the "dark matter" of the
GDW universe.

The missile displaces .5 ton, Thus to conform to the 15*ton rule it can\'t 
weight more than 7.5tons. The original drive was spec\'ed to 12G. As 3MW 
gives 60 tons of trust, and 60 divided on 12.4 gives 4.838, or rounded to 5.

    'topic' => 'RC vs. Regency',
    'body' => 'I\'ve just caught up on about a week or two\'s postings, and this debate over the 
conflict between the RC and the Regency seems interesting.

We know only a few things about what has/will happen when the two meet. The 
Regency will not back down on Virus, but in the RC many citizens are likely to 
become very good friends with some of the sandman strains - imagine having a 
friend who can run a starship singlehanded better than the ship\'s computer, and 
who really wants to impress you. But the Regency, while very good at keeping 
Virus out, has next to zilch experience in dealing with entrenched infections. 
Virus sympathisers in the Coalition could take shiploads of virus eggs 
throughout the imperium. The RQS might find it harder to deal with this than to 
keep a border shut.

Still, from the quotes I\'ve seen , I don\'t believe that the Coalition and the 
Regency actually end up going to war. I don\'t want that to happen, as 
1/I like the Regency
2/It wouldn\'t be much of a confrontation
3/I\'ve come to like the Reformation Coalition (although the TML in general 
mightn\'t agree with me there)

The RC and the Regency will face a difficult task in rebuilding the Imperium. 
There really is nothing that either could do if they meet with a large number of 
pocket empires who want their independence and will fight for it. You could 
blast them into the ground, but that\'s not really the best way to rebuild an 
empire.

Perhaps this confrontation could be avoided if a third player was brought into 
the picture......

Thoughts
1/We are told that tens of thousands of vampire ships are heading coreward.
2/It would be reasonable to assume that they have been doing this for a decade 
at least.
3/There isn\'t likely to be anything much to do once they get to Capital, just 
check the ruins and then leave again.
4/Given the above, shouldn\'t a large number of vampire ships be leaving Core as 
well. Where have they gone?

It seems to me that something is definitely up in the Black Curtain, something 
which could be more than just a large number of vampire fleets infighting.
What if a dominant strain of Virus is cooperating with the human and alien 
citizens in the Black sphere, not some peacemaker, but a far more aggressive 
mutation, a sophisticated Empire maker. Even while the RC and Coalition are 
arguing on principles, a common enemy is building strength elsewhere. Regency 
vs. Coalition is a foregone result, but there was so much military hardware in 
the old Imperium, that even if most of it was destroyed, there would still be 
enough remaining or repairable to outnumber the ships available to the Regency 
and Coalition, especially if a very strong strain of virus could remobilise 
virus infected devices usefully.
Even in 1210 or so, the massive virus empire (probably a misnomer, the virus 
would merely be an equal citizen with the organic sentients working with it, 
this kind of attitude would let it work effectively with organics, who are at 
least useful) would have spies throughout the former Imperium, supplied with 
virus free ships where necessary (imagine players pursuing a scout ship, which 
then suddenly is joined by a very big relic battleship jumping in to protect the 
smaller ship, before leaving again, and think of the players trying to convince 
the authorities of their sighting, and that there is \'something out there\') 
The sudden emergence of this empire could let the Regency and Coalition forget 
their differences and band together for protection.

I really like the possibility for adventure this gives, something like 
Babylon 5, but without the mystic bits.

Still, it\'ll never be Traveller canon, but I wish GDW would spill the beans on 
the Black Curtain. After all, while you don\'t have to include Grandfather in 
your campaign if you don\'t want to, your players shouldn\'t have too much trouble 
finding the Black Curtain (Its trailing of the Marches or Coreward of the 
Coalition in case you missed it ;-). 
Still, given that information on this should be in one of the next couple of 
books after the Regency Sourcebook, we can at least expect to see it by about 
the year 2000 or thereabouts ;-)

Hans, Your 3% per anum  is the higher end of industrialized doubling times.
Average, and that used in the TNE rules (Mk1, Mod 1, pp191) is 0.5 to 2%,
giving a doubling time of 35 to 120 years. Considering that most
populations stabilize anyway at certain plateaus, and available food limits
both the number of children who live to adulthood and the number of adults
who survive to breed viably (children who are not part of the infant
mortality rate), as the population ioncreases, so also the doubling time
increases.

Also, keep in mind that as population increases, so also does internal
violence.

Supporting data: according to a 1992 sociology text, the lowest known
doubling time was 17 years, in ethiopia. the lowest were in Eroupe, some of
which had halving times.

And as for the Aslan, keep in mind that their population is kept in check
by the limited number of breeding males, constant wars
(internal/inter-clan), and 15-25% of non-breeding females. The Vargr also
have the same basic checks, but don\'t have the male-female ration problems.
All totaled, these factors would severely cut down the population growth
rate (increase doubling times).

Who needs population control measures? Nature builds them in.

BTW: with a doubling time of 50 years (about 1.4% per anum), that 10,000
person colony will grow, assuming no change in growth rate, over 550 years
to a mere 20,480,000 persons. Earth, in CE 1995, is over 5 Billion, with a
mean doubling time (supposedly) of 40-60 years.

3% per anum is a doubling time of 25 years.
5% per anum is 15 years.

pop over time formula:

        Pf= Ps * 2^(Tt/Td)
Where:
        Pf = Final Population           Tt = Total time allowed
        Ps = Starting Population        Td = Doubling Time
and no reduction in doubling time occurs during population growth through
the time allotted.

in Hard Times and Survival Margin, I think that crash of the economy
occured because merchants failed to see the profit in trading with the
worlds at the borders of the safe zones, and as they pulled back, the
defense forces would likewise do so (Overall, not in specific) as the
defensive roll of any military is to protect trade and resources. Since
this moves the safe area border back, the merchants pull back farther,
their former clients turn to piracy to retain any off-world imports on a
steady basis, and the cycle continues.

 As the larger populations get cut off from trade, they start going into
local recessions, failing to get needed off world good, and may collapse if
above the Max Sustainable Population. When such a world loses it\'s off
world imports, there will either be strong leadership making rough choices
(Who lives and who dies), racial purges (intra- or inter- species), or war
over who gets what.

Just look at germany between the two world wars to see what I mean (they
were being forced to pay reparitions that meant reducing the standard of
living below the wartime levels of WWI).

As for Disease Rules: Travellers Digest #20, pp 44-48,(Terry McInnes, DGP
1990) has some good, simple rules for MT. The Task Difficulties can be used
as is.
Radiation Sickness and related issues were in TD #15, and Mental Illnes in #17.

They would need very little work to be crossed over. (Hint Hint Wink
Wink... GDW, are you out there???)

Also, you can use the Twighlight:2000 radiation rules for a good, but
brief, simple system for radiation and illness, no conversions needed.

I would ammend this.  Keep halving ranges and making deeper easy tasks.
At Easy -1 effective assets >19 are not limited to 19, ie: they are
automatic successes if the asset is high enough.

The change in effective asset keeps following the pattern as well (twice
asset, 4 times asset, etc.).

For a SR16 AEMS we\'d have:

Range(hexes)	Rangeband	Difficulty	Comments
----
32		Medium		Difficult
16		Short(S)	Average
8		S/2		Easy
4		S/4		Easy -1		Automatic
2		S/8		Easy -2		Automatic
1		S/16		Easy -3		Automatic
.5		S/32		Easy -4		"	"
etc.

Drop fractions when doing ranges, I would guess: S/4 for SR10 would be
2, for example.  Fractions below a hex are kept for KKM purposes.

If you take this to be true for fire tasks, things get bad for KKMs if
there are few of them.  But if you shoot 1 more than the target can
auto-kill, then you still hit.  Rolls would still be made for
outstanding success, although for that purpose maybe there\'s a hard
limit of 19 (20 will never get outstanding results).

HACKERS, CYBERDECKS, COMPUTER EMPATHICS
AND YOU

	Out in my little neck of the woods (Efate realy) we have high tech computer
crime every hour on the hour!  For example, you go dirtside again after
weeks in space, hoping to find some fat reward for your last job.  You pug
in your cred-card into the port athority ATM to pay for berthing and
refuling.  But then bells and whisles go off. "Uh, sir", says the Starport
Tech, "your cred card is no longer valid."  "WHAT!!!", you shout.  Depending
on the law of the world, you could be taken in for a very long chat or shot
for trying to cheat someone (the Latter happens at home all the time).
	What happened? The answer is simple realy, you have just been assaulted by
a hacker.  The hacker using whatever programs and skills he has has wiped
out your account, and transfered all money to his account.  The only
failsafe is the venereble Cred-Card which keeps a record of everything that
should be there.  Cred cards are nigh impossible to crack, so the hacker
tries to go straight to the bank computer.  what happens is that when you
use your card, and the bank computer on the world has a descrepency, then
you are under question.
	How does one defend oneself from these thieves of data. One way is to know
how they work. (Know thy enemy....)

The 1st kind of Computer Felon is the HACKER. these are hot-shot computer
techies who use portable computers and programs to crack into secure areas.
In game terms, they are the norm. These are the same computer
programer/techies that are in the career lists in TNE. It\'s just that they
have gone BAD.  What hapens to these guys when they meet Virus? Not much,
except a posessed computer....;>

The 2nd type are the CYBERHACKERS also known as NETRUNNERS these are the
guys who plug a computer into thier brain (Yeesh!) so that they are at one
with the computer. (Oooh, Zen, deep!)  This gives the hacker a  +1 to
initiative in Computer Combat and reduces all tasks by 1 level. What hapens
to these guys when the encounter virus? Heh, heh, heh ;>

The 3rd type are the COMPUTER EMPATHICS.  These are psions who use their
talents to probe into a computer and read the data within.  As they can only
read data, any actual manipulation of that data must be done with a
computer.  Example, the psion scans the mainframe and finds the access code
to unlock a file. she cannot unlock the file by just thinking about it, she
must remember the code and type it in manualy. (If I am misreading the rules
for the Computer Empatics, I apologize, but I think they can only read, not
manipulate data.  If they can manipulate data, then they would be REALY
powerful!) At stage 6 success, they outdo even the Cyberhackers for they get
a -2 level dificulty adjustment for all tasks. What happens when these guys
meet Virus?  Well, they can sense it, and know it\'s there, but as Virus is
not psionic(that we know of heh heh! ;>)  The psion will not suffer any
psionic pains.

Just how do these guys operate?  Well, first you need a computer, a hand
computer or Lower tech laptop will do.  Then you need some kind of link to
the system you want to crack.  At low techs this is a usualy a phone line,
posibly a radio-com carrier wave. At prestallar and early stellar cellphones
are common, as is a world-wide computer network (i.e. Internet on late 20th
and early 21st century Terra).  At high stellar tech levels, the meson-com
is the top of the line communicator.  High stellar meson internets are
EXTREAMLY fast and eficient. Dont have to wait for satalite bouncing
time-lag for your downloading!

Thats about all you need to begin, of course the Cyberhackers need a neural
interface jack. (800,000cr if memory serves and the\'re ILLEGAL! especialy in
Regency) Psions need only to do their psionic skill checks,and then the fun
can begin.


I will leave the Role playing details to individual GM\'s, but if any of my
fellow Traveller Addicts out there want it, I do have my own hacking rules
that I use for my Campaign.  They are a fusion of the old MT Computer
rules(Remember those big control factor numbers?) and Cyberpunk 2020 by R.

You\'re forgetting a few things:

- 747s dropping out of the sky onto cities

- ships hitting rocks, or crashing into harbours

- a meltdown at practically every reactor

- almost *no* communication (no phones, TV, radio)

- the collapse of every major bank

- all power stations shutting down or blowing up

- train crashes

- all factories shut down (no power or workers dead, panicking, or unable
to get there)

NORAD\'s sensors are telling them they\'re under attack, ditto the men in
the silos, and all the phones are dead...*someone\'s* gonna press the
button. Alternatively, it may be assumed to be an attack by another country
and retaliate.

According to a recent Time article, the US (in particular) is extremely
worried about \'cyberwar\'.

*Was* it common? You want the people alive and the planets habbitable, if
possible. A barren, irradiated lump of rock is no use to anyone. I expect
there will have been *some* nuking (or mesoning), but most planets would
surrender after the first shot.

Me again with my FFS question of the month.  Here goes.  I was trying
to create my own little 7kl grav bike.  Well, my design was a tad off,
so I checked mine against the grav bike from TNE/FFS.  Well, unless I\'m
missing something, that isn\'t a feasible design.

Here\'s what I\'ve come up with.  2.5kl for the cramped seat (for the
driver), and another 1.5kl for the restricted seat (for the passenger),
then 2.5kl for the cramped crewstation.  That\'s already 6.5kl out of
7kl.  Take the .7kl that you\'re suppossed to add for this being a
moderately sloped grav vehicle, and you\'ve surpassed your limit!

So, I must be missing something.  If some kind soul could just tell me
what, I\'d really appreciate it.

As always, thanks in advance...

Sounds like a great, useful, idea to me. I have been meaning to ask-
the history of biology and bio-related events in Traveller seems like
it could use some more work. There are questions like ; How common
are cases of biosphere contamination? How do various biological 
systems from different worlds interact? Does Vland have a biosystem
based on DNA/amino acids etc? How about Lair? Or Zhdant? Or any other 
world for that matter? Do diseases from other types of biosystem pose
a hazrd to humans? What are the most common bio-protection routines used
in going from world to world? How many kinds of vaccines are administered
to the average Traveller /Regency Citizen? 
A while back someone mentioned bioengineering being common among high-tech
worlds... well, what are the limits to such bioengineering? Legal,
scientific, technical, economic? are inhabitants usually geneered 
to be more intelligent than others? More docile? More attractive?
Stronger? Can you buy a retroviral treatment for certain disorders?
What about buying a genetic enhancement? Better in some ways than 
cybernetics... what would it cost? is it legal? how do these people 
deal with the obvious ethical questions? 
Any input would be appreciated.  I for one, don\'t quite know what
to say on some of these questions...

You use a sensor drone, or a high-power communicator, ar perhaps a fighter.
EMMasked missles are scary. At least if they are Fire&Forget. (or you\'d
pick up the telemetry/guidance signals.) Even so - with incoming 
stealth missles, you are toast. Either get him before he gets you,

Yes, so we\'re now acquainted with exponential growth. And if you extrapolate
current rates of increase in power consumption in the US, in a hundred years
we\'ll consume more power than most of the galaxy.

That\'s why they invented the logistics curve.
It starts out as an exponential and then flattens out to approach a 
constant. I.e. other factors start limiting growth - above all resources.
If birth control wasn\'t practiced, good ol\' Malthus would do his thing.
It\'s reasonable to expect that the Imperial era had stringent birth
control on some worlds, but not all. The Regency might still have 
many - the Wilds? I doubt it, except were its a matter of survival.
And if a reconstruction ever takes place, ther will be a period of 
exponential growth again, which will quickly fill up available 
worlds. then there will be a proble ; re-enforce birth control, or 
continue expansion into other areas? Solomani sphere, Julian worlds,
aslan, K\'kree, Foreven sector.. places to go, worlds to conquer. Or 
stagnate just like the Third Imperium. I will bet you money that there
woudl be scholars around 1300 who would argue that the real reason 
the Imperium died was that it couldn\'t expand, thus had to stagnate...
above all in the simple area of population control.
> 
> Who needs population control measures? Nature builds them in.

ASk the WHO. Nature might build them in. unfortunately her methods
are not very civilized, and tend to be disruptive of society. I would 
think any rational TL-15 society would attempt to deal with the matter in
a more controlled and predictable manner.

I agree. But I also think a reason for economic collapse was that
a) Civilian production was curtailed in favor of military needs.
b) Battles were fought on the very same worlds that produced the 
military hardware. Ask yourself; which place sufferend worse during
WWII, the USA or Europe? Where was the fighting? Ergo...
c) people used nukes, meson guns, bioweapons,..

One last question; take HEPlaR drive, calculate what the exhaust velocity
has to be based on thrust/fuel consumption rates. You get (after solving
the relativistic equation) something around 0.99 c. Ok, so the exhaust
is going pretty fast... Now they claim that 1MW is all you need to heat
and accelerate this fuel, without fusing it. I don\'t think so. And 
I don\'t think you could run a HEPlaR off an MHD turbine. especially not
in an atmophere. 
Fix?
Well, how about the following? HEPlaR is High Efficiency Plasma Recombustion.
You take a fusion rocket (low thrust/low fuel consumption) and add
an "afterburner" to it -  extra fuel is injected in the chamber and 
some of it fused, but mostly just acting as reaction mass... 
In an atmosphere you use waste heat from a fusion reactor to heat 
atmospheric gases and accellerate them out the back. If you\'re using 
an MHD you merely hook the turbine exhaust up ta an afterburner, buurning 
hydrogen conventionally.

You are not missing anything, but your design concept is wrong.  
Motorcycles (gravbikes too.) do not need seats (as found in FF&S) because 
the driver/passanger are riding ON the hull that makes the bike.  So for 
all purposes, we can assume that the hull itself already contains the 
limitied seats for the driver/passanger. (They do not need a chair and 
leg space etc that the 2.5kl seats provide.)

As for the crewstation, look at the back of RCEG for the add-on rules 
regarding grav-belts.  These should help you save space and will 
(hopefully) result in a valid design.

Hmm.  I played with HEPlaR awile ago, and if I recall I got an exhaust
velocity on the order of 40,000km/s .  This was based on conservation of
momentum.  Then I did the KE of that exhaust, and compared it to the
energy put into the drive by the PP and found it lacking.  There would
be a small gamma correction to the exhaust since it\'s @ 13% of c, but I
ignored it in that calculation.

Ruby is part of the Jewell Cluster, a group of three worlds at the spinward
edge of the Regency.  Dominated by, and reliant on heavily populated Jewell
one parsec away, the citizens of Ruby have managed to preserve independence.
Like Jewell, Ruby\'s location so near to the Zhodani border makes it a
frequent stop for Regency military forces.  However, where centuries of
exposure to the Frontier Wars has given Jewellers an ingrained distrust of
the Zhodani and Vargr, the people of Ruby have an unprejudiced attitude to
all races.

Ruby was first settled in 339, primarily to obtain ores for the inhabitants
of Jewell and Emerald.  Never of great importance, the colony was abandoned
in 362, after large quantities of high-grade lanthanum ores were discovered
on Jewell.  The system remained essentially uninhabited until 634, although
small Zhodani contingents occupied Ruby from 592-603, and in 617.  Both of
these forces withdrew from the system as the balance of the First and Second
Frontier Wars tipped back towards the Imperium.

In 631, Papaieie Sawaiu led a group of leftist libertarians to petition the
Jewell government for permission and aid to settle Ruby.  Jewell\'s
government (which was still legally the owner of the system) granted the
petitions requests (probably more to be rid of a troublesome minority than
anything else), and set aside MCr4.0 to reopen the abandoned colony.  In
634, six hundred Sawaiuites settled a site about 80km southwest of the old
lanthanum mines.  The group began shipping small quantities of platinum to
Emerald in 640, and surprisingly, managed to pay it\'s way.  Sharp falls
precious metal prices in the region in the late 690\'s put an end to the
colony\'s modest prosperity, and Jewell was once again forced to subsidise
it\'s neighbour.

The subsidy was withdrawn in 711, and preparations were made to repatriate
the colonists to Jewell.  The colony, now numbering several thousand, was
saved by the Imperial Government\'s decision to establish scout facilities in
the system.  Tensions between the Imperium and the Zhodani had been
increasing since the end of the Second Frontier War, and the IISS had
decided to upgrade it\'s presence in the subsector as part of a overhaul of
intelligence operations against the Zhodani.  The base and accompanying
starport facilities were completed in 720, many of the existing colonists
were contracted to provide support services for IISS personnel in this
lonely frontier outpost.

The Scout base was hastily abandoned at the outbreak of the Third Frontier
War, it\'s personnel and ships pulled back help defend Jewell from major
Zhodani attacks.  Once again, Zhodani ground troops occupied the world,
taking over the scout base for use in supplying the forces beseiging Jewell.
They pulled out of the system at the end of the war, having largely ignored
the civilian population during their seven year occupation. At the outbreak
of the Fourth Frontier War, Zhodani forces ran into substantial Imperial
naval assets deployed from Jewell.  Their attack was beaten off, and the
Zhodani chose to bypass and isolate the world.  The pattern was repeated in
the Fifth War, with Zhodani forces attacking Jewell from Esalin.

Since then, Ruby has remained on the \'front lines\'.  Imperial, and later
Regency fleets regularly deployed to the system for exercises.  The thaw in
Regency-Zhodani relations from 1117 onwards saw the scout presence scaled
back, and the scout base was transferred to the Regency Quarantine Service
in 1146.  The RQS operates a Customes Station on Ruby, primarily to inspect
the small number of Jump-1 ships travelling along the Jewell-Cipango Main
from the Consulate.  Naval units also routinely deploy here from Jewell and
Mongo for joint exercises with RQS and RSS units.

Regular RQS customs procedures are in effect on Ruby.  Incoming starships
will be escorted to the RQS station on Eloise Tay, the small outermost moon
of Boyden, the system\'s only gas giant.  The permanent presence of the RQS
\'Carlton\', a 4000 ton Quarantine Service Carrier, provides the muscle to
back up RQS directives.  Extensive examinations of the starship and it\'s
crew will take 1-3 days (for starships under 1000 tons).  During this time,
crews and passengers are \'invited\' to stay at the \'Eloise Hilton\' (the
somewhat spartan guest accomadations on the station).

Following inspection, the ship is free to move on to Ruby, or to refuel at
Boyden and jump outsystem.  Ruby itself has only one starport, the Class B
RQS facility on the world\'s surface.  This starport is open to civillian
traffic, although berthing fees are considerably higher than for comparable
private facilities.  The base\'s repair and maintenance facilities are not
available to civillians excepts in emergencies (although detatched duty
Scouts and RQS officials are welcome).

New visitors will be steered towards \'Ruby\'s Startown Bar\', on the edge of
the starport complex.  \'Ruby\'s\' is famous throughout the region for it\'s
cheap booze (and other, less common stimulants), and for it\'s bouncers.
Unruly patrons are given a brief lecture on the anit-social aspects of their
violent behaviour by the doormen (a lecture given with absolute sincerity ).
Continued troublemaking will normally result in extremely violent ejection
and arrest.  All staff at \'Ruby\'s\' are members of the Stivlprerqaf family,
descendents of a Zhodani prole who fled across the border in 992.  The
current manager is Jdishehtaev Stivlprerqaf (Jdishehtaev is probably better
known in the Regency as \'Jades Stive\', acclaimed romance novelist).  

Sawaiu Town, the only substantial settlement of Ruby, adjoins the RQS base.
Almost all of Ruby\'s 19,900 permanent inhabitants live here.  The town
itself consists of four pressure domes atop an underground tunnel complex.
The domes are given over largely to parkland - each dome has a different
environment and \'theme\'.  In order of size, these are:  Sawaiu Dome (Terran
/ Tropical Maritime), Isgiidu (Vilani / Highland), Summondamus (Terran /
Desert) and Taenu Diran (Sylean / Savannah).  Residential, commercial and
support areas are all underground.  Local although the world is small, local
gravity is a reasonable 0.78g, due to the planet\'s higher than normal
density.  Atmospheric pressure is maintained at 0.8 standard atmospheres,
making the environment tolerable for most visitors.

Visitors will find the locals friendly and agreeable, if somewhat strange.
Non-violence is an important part of the Rubyan lifestyle, although
potential criminals are warned that Ruby\'s law enforcement officials are
generally hired from offworld, and do not have the same passive ethic.
Offenders face deportation and confiscation of their assets if caught -
within a short time, they will find themselves on Jewell with little more
than the clothes on their back.  Given the world\'s reliance on offworld
powers for it\'s continued existence, foreigners are treated with respect.
Merchants on Ruby will buy and sell for fair prices - at any rate, they are
trading for the good of the colony more than their own gain.  A disgruntled
customer won\'t come back, a potential loss for the world.

Ruby\'s inhabitants are fiercely egalitarian - the concept of \'privelige\' is
repellant to them.  Without exception, all citizens are allocated the same
communal floorspace in Sawaiu Town\'s residential areas.  this concept of
\'equality of opportunity\' is one of the basic tenets of Ruby\'s society - the
lasting legacy of the settlement\'s commune origins.  The settlement\'s ruler,
the \'Premier\', is directly elected by all permanent residents for a two year
term.  Traditionally, the office is one of the lowest paying jobs on the
planet.  Although the Premier is responsible for all aspects of
administration, much of the more judicial and administrative work is handled
by a council of elders.  Membership in the council is voluntary and unpaid,
but anyone over the age of 40 can join.

One interesting custom practised by the Rubyan is \'fostering\'.  Ruby lacks
all but the most elementary educational facilities, children are instead
sent to Jewell to complete their education.  A child will spend from three
to twelve years on Jewell as a \'fosterling\', before returning to Ruby as an
adult citizen.  

Most of Ruby\'s residents are employed either directly or indirectly by the
RQS, although some mining still takes place.  Mineral ores are shipped
mainly to the agricultural worlds of Emerald and Esalin in exchange for
food.  A small nunmber of independant miners eke out a precarious existence
from gold and platinum deposits.  All large scale mining is conducted by
RubyCorp, a statutory authority run by the government.  Miners typically
spend six weeks at a time in the camps, followed by six weeks layover in
Sawaiu Town.  Independent miners number less than two hundred, and typically
live permanently at their workings, coming to town only to sell their ores
and resupply.

Ruby maintains a small fleet of four Type R Subsidised Merchants, used to
service the mineral trade with Emerald and Esalin.  The \'Papaieie\', \'Rhys\',
\'Topaz\' and \'Guiding Hand\' are all subsidised by the Ruby and Regency
governments.

Not likely. They still carry pilots, and the computers aren\'t that much in control.

True, but remeber, most TL8 worlds would not be in a hair trigger state
due to a Cold War - and in 1995 Terra isn\'t either. Again, much like
the movie \'Wargames\' once the computer said impact, and the private on the other end of the (1950\'s technology) secure phone line said \'No explosion here,
sir\', things would get calmer...

Tell that to the commanders of Lucan\'s forces in the 1120\'s. 

Snip, snip.
Thanks for checking the rules of the collapse on Terra. I don\'t have them,
at least not with me... 
The point remains; those worlds that survived were not the ones hardest
hit by Virus. This should be remembered when considering their eventual
Virophobia.

You\'re forgetting several Soviet designs that were designed for a 
high-speed (mach 2) dive from high altitude. But yes, phalanx has 
some time. Just like a TL-14 point defence system has.

And now, back to Virii;

THe GDW canon about using non-connected coputers and code-phrases for
Virus protection is not very convincing. 
a) it\'s slow and prone to human error.
b) when you\'re transmitting information, you can\'t win. EG, if the
jump drive needs to know the insertion angle is 9.456782343641 deg,
you can\'t just type in Alpha Green Five. at least not if the next 
jump is with an angle of 9.456772343641... 
Why not just type in the right number to begin with. And if you\'re 
typing in a number that can\'t be a control code (say, to load a 
certain file and execute it) why not just devise a simple one-way serial
connection? 
also, if most of your systems are hard-wired, Virus is screwed. You can\'t
reprogram a non-programmable calculator, at least not without changing 
it\'s circuit wiring. And since that shouldn\'t be too hard to prevent,
your virus can\'t do much.  
The idea everything would be a kind of PLA (i.e. you can reprogram the actual
circuitry) is nottobvious .

So by hard-wiring  many things you lose flexibility - you don\'t go back 
to a chain of people shouting numbers at each other.

	The hardest part about defending against missiles is getting
target locks in the first place.  You can use the range-halving system
proposed by Merrick and myself, additionally, just put lots of redundant
sensors on you ships.  Say your cruiser has 10 sets of SR3 PEMS.  When the
missiles come within PB the task to lock them is Easy -1, +2 for size, +1
for EMM, +1 for evasion, and +1 for decoys (not-quite worst case) which
yields Impossible.  In most cases this is a 5% chance of locking.  Not
very good.  But the chance of _all 10_ of your SR3 PEMSs failing to lock
is only 60% (40% chance to lock).  If these sensors are AEMS instead, and
you are tracking SIM/FIM missiles with their sensors deployed, you get a
-1 DM to lock, giving a net task of Formidable and a 98.2% chance of
locking (assuming Line crews).  Big ships should have lots of sensors
anyway in case of battle damage. If you use the range-halving system, 
longer range systems will have better base task difficulties at 0 hex 
range (your best chance to lock and hit attcking missiles.)
	Once you\'ve locked it, all you have to do is hit it.  If your 
point defense lasers have MFDs this shouldn\'t be much of a problem and as 
long as you have more lasers than he has missiles.

	Very true.  The same goes for Det-lasers.  Conventional missiles are 
vulnerable to anything with good penetration characteristics over .3g at 
their max clsing velocity.  Maybe all you need to defeat KKMs are some 
big flechette projectors on your ship.  you could also use anti-missile 
missiles loading with ball-bearings or some such to hit det-lasers within 
the 0 hex, but before they detonate.  These could be real cheap and could 
intercept missiles from as far out as their max range (12 hexes for 
Eaplac, 100+for Heplar), thus providing another layer of defense.

toad@ugcs.caltech.edu (Benjamin Lane) Another question; has anyone
>considered (i.e. made and tested rules for) bistatic active sensors (i.e.

	You can do something kinda similar by using sensor drones with the
PEMS antennae but putting the processor on the mother ship.  This lets you
use your drones more aggressively since they are cheaper.  It also gives
them higher Gs since they are lighter.  I haven\'t figured out how to do
this with AEMS because: "Antennae volume, mass, and price are subsumed in
the total sensor package above." (FF&S pg. 51)

	The use of drones also suggests a defense againse missiles.  By 
having a perimeter of sensor drones, any attacking ship must either risk 
detection and counter fire, or launch from farther away, giving the 
defender another turn to shoot down or otherwise defeat the missiles.  
This could lead to a whole spiral of measure counter-measure with armed 
drones attacked sensor drones, interceptor drones attacking the armed 
drones, fighters attacking interceptor drones, ad infinitum.  Each ship 
could look like its own little carrier task force.

Hi All,

I have been searching through my gaming materials looking for an 
explanation of how fusion power is implemented in Traveller. It has been 
bothering me that Traveller seems to treat PP as black boxes which 
convert Hydrogen to power and thrust. I have found very few details in TNE 
and MT supplements that I own. Can anyone refer me to a good source of info?

Basically, I\'m assuming that a fusion PP is a magnetic bottle containing 
the reaction. Apparently, some of the pressure is used in HEPLAR for 
thrust. I am interested in how usable power can be obtained from this 
fusion blast. There have been past comments on the list that the 
efficiencies for fusion are way too low. How are efficiencies for 
something like this estimated. Has anything else been surmised based on 
current experiments (ie startup procedure, configuration)?

Also, how would the recombustion for fusion thrust be accomplished. 
I can only guess that excess pressure beyond that required to sustain the 
reaction is bled off into the recombustion chamber.

Any ideas/theories are welcome. I plan to incorporate this into 
my house rules. Feel free to email me direct if you do not want to post to 
the list.  

Thanks,

Glenn

  Not hardly!  Ever heard of FAIL-SAFE?  Reactors are designed to fail-safe, 
as are most potentially dangerous mechanical systems.  And it\'s damn hard
to meltdown a commercial reactor beyond fusing the fuel rods into
uselessness.
No real effects on the outside world except loss of power production.  And
how did the reactor controls get infected in the first place?  Especially
when
you consider that most reactors (in the U.S., at least) were built far enough
back that their control technology is too primitive for Virus to infect...

I agree whole heartely here. I have met only 1 person in Anchorage who will

Remember, the transponders use "\'lobotomized\' cymbaline chips" (Survival
margin, p75), which are a life form. (See also Signal GK) They are capable
of reprograming them selves, and they are derived from a wild life form
which is self mobile, and reproduces by directly imprinting it\'s code upon
suitable material. Supposedly, this included the TL13-15 semi-synaptic
computers.

Anything big enough and powerfull enough to handle the kind of data flow

Agreed. But you still have a *SLIM* chance of infection.

=================       gravitics

In my campaigns, I use gravitic driven fusion cells. (I assume that AG
requires two plates, but that is immaterial for the way it fuses) The walls
are liquid cooled turbine drivers, coupled with some EMRad converters and
the magnetic bottles to keep it from melting down. Hold the cell in a 20-30
G downward field, add a litle heat, and pressurized inflow with restricted
outflow, and you have a workable fusion plant.

Also, I assume that a long running power plant that is not venting properly
may develop other elements than helium, including Li and Carbon. This can
lead to unusual (and catastrophic) failures. So also can dropping unrefined
fuel (methane, amonia, etc) into a working plant. Yeah, enough
pressure/heat/density will allow them to dissassociate and fuse, but I have
no idea how much that would be.

Since (from what I have read) the fuusion problems ammount to 2 flaws at
current tech, this system seems to make sense to my gamers. those problems
are
1) maintaining sufficient pressure within the torrid
2) utilizing the energy produced (converting it to some useable type)

Also note that this design has no moving parts inside the cell, and only a
HP Steam turbine to go wrong mechanically.

The Serpent Class Scout is a 100 ton variant of the Scout Courier, noted
for it\'s airframe hull. The design uses a 1m grid, despite the 1.5 meter
label, and 2.5m tall decks. ( I have counted this many times... otherwise
it\'s 200 tons of deck plan.    :-O

Supposedly it is a swing wing... In my campaigns it\'s a delta much like the
Fat Trader. I have converted it to TNE Stats as a TL 14 Scout/Light Survey.
When I get it finished, I\'ll post it. (I keep revising it.)

Here is where your message originated:

the name before the @ is your username on the system identified to the

	A far more realistic scenario is separated systems (ie: Comm is NOT 
networked to Engineering is NOT networked to Library, etc.) This gets 
away from the truly anachronistic Traveller mode of Computers as 
Mainframes orientation, where you have one giant (tons in old Classic 
Trav) computer that runs everything.

	Another measure is to have a human actually press the buttons that 
control the drives: ie: The computer says everything is green, the 
coordinates are thus (tap tap tap) and we go. Also, you could have 
the kind of system that they use on the space shuttle...three 
separate systems have to agree or there\'s no go.

	Actually, the depictions of the systems in TNE leads me to believe 
that no-one at GDW has any real clue how computer systems are 
networked and control systems work. 

	The key is physically separating some crucial element of control
from the computer, and limiting the routes of input to the crucial
control systems, which basically means you don\'t network everything.
It can be a pain to have to physically run a lot of redundant network
wiring, as well as having multiple terminals for some engineering
stations, but it makes life a lot safer in a Virus world. Besides,
that lets you create separate specialized control panels for each
system rather than have a single terminal toggle between roles, which
in some ergonomics studies by the military, actually increases humnan
reliability...it\'s actually a lot easier to pick out the fire control
panel on a wide control panel than to have to toggle your single
simpler system to \'Fire Control\' 

	The downfall of the old Imperium was hastened by the intricate 
networking of ships systems, which made life infinitely easier, and 
better in many cases...in an emergency the life support systems 
engineer could pop over to the nearest terminal and control 
everything as if he were on the bridge, but the end result was the 
systems were wide open to Viral assault, since entry anywhere meant 
entry to the entire system.  With separated systems, the Virus has 
got to create a boot floppy for every system on board that has to be 
physically inserted to spread the infection.

     Northammon was originally settled in 95 by colonists from Massilia and 
     Delphi sectors.  At first, Northammon seemed to be a cold mountainous 
     wasteland, an unforgiving environment for hopeful settlers.  The 
     planet\'s distance from its dim star, Kalighril (Northammon lies one 
     orbit outside the "habitable zone" of the system) has little 
     deleterious effect on the planet\'s meteorological activity.  A high 
     incidence of moderate solar flares and Northammon\'s high atmospheric 
     pressure combine to produce a virtual maelstrom of constant 
     meteorological activity.  Swirling coriolises of clouds fill the 
     northern and southern hemispheres throughout the year.  Northammon\'s 
     hemispherical regions are snow-covered almost year round with a slight 
     reprieve during the "warm season."  The warm season occurs for a 
     period of about three weeks at the perigee of Northammon\'s orbital 
     eccentricity around Kalighril.
     
     In sharp contrast to the frozen northern and southern hemispheres, the 
     equatorial region, or "hot belt" as it\'s known to locals, provides a 
     warmer, more moderate clime, with its rolling hills and river valleys. 
     A scarcity of large bodies of water throughout 80 percent of the 
     planet\'s 2,000 km-wide tropical zone bolsters the more stable weather 
     patterns of the region.  Six large mountain ranges, skirting the edges 
     of four of the planet\'s six tectonic plates, serve as barriers to some 
     of Northammon\'s harsher blizzards.  The numerous faultlines between 
     the plates result in a high incidence of seismic activity in the 
     region.
     
     The first Northammonese colony, which discovered, catalogued and began 
     to exploit the rich resources of the planet, nearly died out in the 
     late 100s.  Colonial overextension strained several supply lines 
     through the interstellar region during this period and several 
     colonies were left to their own devices for decades.  The colonial 
     population of the planet, which had risen to 20,000, fell to under 
     8,000 people.  A scarcity of supplies resulted in an exodus from the 
     planet to the more stable environments of Isurkun, Achemadon and Kauai 
     systems.  The hardy bunch who remained played a defining role in 
     establishing the culture of Northammon.
     
     The Northammonese settlers who remained and the trickle of daring 
     colonists who continued to settle the planet, developed a strong 
     self-reliance ethic that remains to this day.  The Northammonese 
     welcomed new settlers and continued to settle their world regardless 
     of the public sentiment against it.  Seemingly trying to prove their 
     detractors wrong, the Northammonese settlers went far and wide 
     throughout the sphere of their world, establishing farms and ranches 
     even in the most inclement regions.  While 65 percent of the early 
     Northammonese clung to the tropical zone, thousands of bold souls 
     plowed into the outback and staked their claims in the northern and 
     southern plateaus and mountain ranges.
     
     Northammonite Frontier, the planetary colonial development office, 
     maintained its aggressive colonial recruitment policy all the while.  
     Throughout the early colonial period of the planet, Northammonite 
     Frontier colonial recruiters could be found on any world within six 
     parsecs, actively encouraging people to come and share the wealth of 
     their rich and undeveloped planet.
     
     Not until the late 300s did colonial efforts on Northammon surpass 
     their former level, however.  In 397, ex-scout and entrepreneur Lewis 
     Tolliver discovered records of Northammon\'s rich natural resources at 
     the Imperial Archives on Vincennes.  He registered a claim with 
     Northammonite Frontier and mounted a massive colonial expedition to 
     bolster the extant colonies.  Before anyone knew it, Northammon was a 
     virtual boomtown.
     
     Tolliver\'s expedition, largely composed of detached duty scouts, 
     quickly performed detailed surveys of the planet\'s resources.  To 
     their surprise, the planet was rich in vegetative life, with over 600 
     edible plant species.  The Tolliver group and successors quickly 
     helped to establish agricultural combines to exploit the lush 
     Northammonese crops.  While most of planet species grow in the 
     temperate tropical region, astoundingly high numbers of crops are 
     exported from the northern and southern hemispheres.  The edible 
     lichens and fruits of the southern region are known as a delicacy by 
     people throughout Northammon\'s interstellar community.
     
     As a side note, Tolliver\'s expedition is well known for its 
     importation of Kians from Prilissa/Trin\'s Veil.  Several hundred Kians 
     were brought to Northammon to be used as cheap transportation by 
     Tolliver\'s colonists.  Kians continue to be widely used for 
     transporation in rural areas of the planet and in cities and towns on 
     the racing circuit.  In fact, while Tolliver\'s agricultural businesses 
     eventually failed, his Kian breeding facility and Tolliver Grounds, a 
     Kian racetrack, are his sole remaining legacies on Northammon.  
     Northammonese Kians are thought to number over 300,000 at the present 
     date.
     
     Like many of the systems in the Vincennes Cluster, Northammon\'s 
     indigenous life for the most part resembles that of Cambrian-era 
     Terra.  Most notable among Northammon\'s native life forms are the 
     lichens and shrubs of the northern and southern tundra.  Bursting 
     through the volcanic soil of the mountains and plains, these life 
     forms have shown uncommon resiliency.  For centuries, monastic orders 
     of Deneb\'s Church of the Stellar Divinity have lauded the medicinal 
     properties of several species of Northammonese mountain shrub roots.  
     Not until the last 200 years, however, have these claims been taken 
     seriously by the public at large.
     
     By 800, the Northammonese population had grown to over four million 
     inhabitants.  Their cultural emphasis on self-reliance spawned several 
     government-subsidized programs to independently develop technology on 
     the planet.  To this end, the former representative democracy of the 
     planet began to import materials for the production of starships, 
     vehicles and computers.  The industrial sector began to grow, but was 
     mostly restricted to serving the needs of agricultural interests. 
     
     As the limited agricultural markets began to tap out for Northammon\'s 
     private industries, tension began to grow with the landlords of the 
     agricultural combines.  Nara Tandy, president of Circumspect Inc., a 
     producer of advanced land and gravitic vehicles, lobbied for rights to 
     manufacture products for export to other worlds.  Most controversial 
     of her requests was an initiative that would bring in megacorporate 
     investment, a heretofore unseen occurrence on Northammon.  
     Agricultural interests onplanet greatly feared the portents of such a 
     bold move and lobbied hard against it.  Fear of overdevelopment, 
     atmospheric contamination and offworld control by big industry 
     abounded in agricultural circles.
     
     The combines were able to stave off offworld industrial development 
     until 962.  At this time, various factors contributed to a worldwide 
     depression that threatened to unhinge the infrastructure of the 
     planet\'s economy.  Tandy seized her opportunity and managed to corral 
     a hysterical electorate into believing that now was the time for 
     offworld investment.  Tandy brought in a consortium, led by 
     representatives of Ling Standard Products and Sternmental Horizons 
     Venture Capital division, who would revitalize the economy of the 
     planet.
     
     For a half century, that\'s exactly what they did.  Northammon\'s 
     economy grew and as the planet\'s ability to export technology grew, so 
     did its ability to export its agricultural products.  Agricultural 
     exports grew to the point that the "Northammon Grown" cargo module 
     stamp became ubiquitous on every inhabited system within 12 parsecs. 
     Megacorporate and sectorwide corporate developers flocked to 
     Northammon to get a piece of the pie.  The political strength of the 
     combines waned during the following years to the point that public 
     resentment for the megacorporations grew to a fever pitch.  The 
     conflict reached its climax when six anti-megacorporate development 
     militias (called "terrorists" by the megacorporate-sponsored media) 
     attacked dozens of industrial installations in a concerted effort to 
     derail their operations.  Corporate security teams and offworld 
     mercenaries took up arms against the militias, but found it difficult 
     to fight the guerilla-style militia troops, who knew the nooks and 
     crannies of Northammon\'s mountain ranges and valleys.
     
     As the conflict escalated over the following four years, the dependent 
     local markets sent up a cry to the Imperial Navy to intervene.  And 
     intervene they did.  Already fighting the Zhodani and Outworld 
     Coalition on their spinward front in a series of border wars that 
     later became known as the Fourth Frontier War, the Imperium did not 
     want to foster the notion that internecine warfare existed throughout 
     the Spinward Marches and Deneb.  Four peacekeeping divisions of 
     marines were dispatched to quell the unrest.  While skirmishes 
     continued to occur at more remote locations, for the most part, the 
     TL-15 armed marines were able to quash the fighting.
     
     In an effort to preserve the peace, the Imperium removed the 
     corporate-dominated government of Northammon and placed moderate 
     pro-combine General Paul Javinovich, from the ranks of Northammon\'s 
     standing army, as the planetary dictator.  The Imperial Marines were 
     promptly removed and indigenous army divisions took their place.  
     While the military rule of Javinovich and his successors has kept the 
     peace, the seething hatred between the agricultural and corporate 
     interests has never been fully extricated from the planetary 
     citizenry.
     
     Despite Northammon\'s problems, the planet remains a major economic 
     force in the region with its powerful agricultural sector and active 
     vehicle-building industries.  Most worlds in Vincennes, Star Lane and 
     Inar subsectors actively import delectable Northammonese foods.  
     Northammonese industry is known to produce some of the most efficient 
     and dependable farming vehicles in the Regency.  R&D divisions are 
     currently expanding into military and commercial markets as well.  The 
     Circumspect Starhawk enclosed grav cycle is currently making waves in 
     the civilian gravitic vehicle industry.  Achieving early TL-15 in many 
     areas, Northammon is truly on the cutting edge of vehicular design.
     
     The native population of Northammon are about 95 percent vegetarian.  
     Because of the planet\'s lack of non-vegetative life forms and the 
     intrinsic self-reliance of its people, few meat products from other 
     worlds were imported during the early colonial years.  The diversity 
     of agricultural life on the planet made it possible to meet the 
     population\'s nutritional requirements without the need for imported 
     foods.  This aversion to imported food products became part of the 
     culture.  With few exceptions, the only Northammonese meat eaters on 
     the planet are the megacorporate employees.
     
     Northammon has only three major cities, Tergin (pop. 2 million), 
     Gebhardt (pop. 800,000) and the capital, Metro-Javinovich (pop. 
     350,000).  Only Tergin and Metro-Javinovich contain Starport B 
     facilities.  Gebhardt currently maintains a Spaceport F-quality 
     installation.  A small orbital level C facility, Northammon Orbital 
     Starport (pop. 12,000) serves the needs of transient travellers who 
     use the system only as a stopover.  The planetbound cities are all 
     located in the tropical region and for the most part serve 
     megacorporate interests.  Most of the combines have offices in the 
     cities as well, however, that serve as the conduits through which they 
     conduct interstellar trade.  The remainder of the population, 
     including over 13 million Northammonese, are spread out over the 
     globe, living and working on the combines and independent ranches.  
     Small cities and towns are the unofficial rule in the agricultural 
     regions, with only a few of them surpassing 100,000 in population.
     
     Northammon is one of the few worlds in the Regency that serve the 
     purpose of harboring refugees from the far-flung Two Thousand Worlds.  
     When the Rebellion struck and vargr raiders swept through Corridor and 
     trailing Deneb sector, many visiting traders, diplomats and merchants 
     were cut off from their homes in trailing and rimward sectors.  
     Several large communities of k\'kree were among these disenfranchised 
     sentients.
     
     The Beng!xkr and Kr\'ukleeri!iir herds, members of the k\'kree trading 
     organization, Rr!krmiixk, were among the larger cohesive groups to be 
     stranded far from home.  While the Beng!xkr and Kr\'ukleeri!iir were 
     spread around the Domain of Deneb conducting trade operations, after 
     the Rebellion hit, they soon realized they would not be returning home 
     at any time in the near future.  Their trade mission completed, the 
     wayward k\'kree had nowhere to go.
     
     As one of General Javinovich\'s last acts in office before he died in 
     1121, he sold the Rr!krmiixk merchants a large tract of undeveloped 
     land in Northammon\'s tropical region.  Northammon, which fits the 
     parameters of a k\'kree "steppeworld," was an ideal site for the 
     refugee k\'kree to set down their roots.  The rather exhorbitant price 
     paid by the k\'kree for their land included the provision that the 
     k\'kree were to be left to their own devices and not bothered by smelly 
     omnivorous humans.
     
     Many vegetarian Northammonese natives maintain regular contact with 
     the k\'kree, but there is no communal mixing of k\'kree and human 
     populations.  The limited trade between humans and k\'kree enable the 
     k\'kree to maintain TL-9 for public transportation and other services 
     in their community and for maintenance of their trader fleet.
     
     The sale of this land to the k\'kree was heavily disputed by 
     megacorporate interests.  They were appalled at the unabashed efforts 
     of the vegetarian combines to use any means possible to make 
     Northammon a less hospitable environment for the corporations and 
     their employees.  The hostility of the k\'kree toward carnivorous races 
     was an established fact.  To combat this move, many corporations 
     embarked upon aggressive, albeit shortlived, programs to enforce 
     vegetarian diets among their employees.  Suffice it to say that for 
     the brief life of these programs, the corporations experienced a 
     considerable turnover rate among their largely offworld work forces.
     
     The initial settlement numbered over 12,000 k\'kree, who had emigrated 
     to Northammon from various locations throughout the Domain.  Several 
     smaller families, realizing they had little hope of ever returning 
     home to the Two Thousand Worlds, chose to relocate to Northammon as 
     well, with the blessing of the Beng!xkr and Kr\'ukleeri!iir herds.  
     Northammon became a haven for stranded k\'kree. 
     
     Upon the discovery by a SuSAG research team in 1145 that some species 
     of Northammon\'s equatorial flora had valuable pharmaceutical 
     properties, the company established a research lab at the fringes of 
     the k\'kree reservation.  This was not looked well upon by the reigning 
     Steppelord, Kurr\'eengx, who immediately made a call to arms to his 
     brethren.  In a move that could only be called reactionary, Kurr\'eengx 
     and his troops swept into the Divigee Valley, where SuSAG had 
     constructed a makeshift headquarters, and promptly massacred the 
     humans at the facility.  SuSAG, known for its paranoia, had two 
     companies of TL-15 equipped security personnel on-site, but the 
     surprise attack caught them offguard.  The k\'kree took heavy losses in 
     the battle, with some estimates at over 2,500 dead.  Nevertheless, 
     they managed to communicate a dire message to any who would threaten 
     the sovereignty of their reservation.
     
     SuSAG appealed to the Regency government for reparations, but was 
     denied.  The Northammonese megacorporate sector did not react well to 
     this development.  While the k\'kree were looked upon as an oddity for 
     the first two decades of their stay on Northammon, they were now 
     looked upon as a threat.  Armed militia bands were formed by the 
     megacorporations, with the intention of settling the region adjacent 
     to the k\'kree reservation and daring the k\'kree to challenge human 
     sovereignty on the planet.
     
     Things began to heat up, with several skirmishes occurring on the 
     borders of the k\'kree settlement.  The combine-dominated Northammonese 
     army refused to intervene on the side of the corporations.  Extreme 
     factions of the Northammonese army began to make a call to arms to 
     "aid their k\'kree brothers against the corporate oppressors."  Duke 
     Norris himself sent two divisions of Regency Marines to keep the 
     conflict from escalating into civil war.  This was the second time 
     that divisions of marines had been sent to preserve peace on 
     Northammon.
     
     The divisions were drawn from the marine training camp at Burden, one 
     of Northammon\'s two moons.  Forming a loose cordon around the k\'kree 
     reservation, the marines have successfully deterred all hostile 
     actions by the megacorporations against the k\'kree.  The marine 
     garrison remains to this day to ensure the safety of the k\'kree 
     settlement.
     
     While the k\'kree population has swelled to over 640,000 in the 
     following 75 years, the k\'kree enclave on Northammon makes up less 
     than four percent of the total planetary population.
     
     The divisiveness between industrialists and agriculturists has 
     continued into the 1200s.  While muted hatred continues to seethe 
     between the two groups, the presence of not one but two military rule 
     garrisons keeps the peace.  The k\'kree are a reluctant ally of the 
     combines, but are suspicious that they are being played as pawns by 
     their benefactors.  Because of Northammon\'s importance to the region, 
     it is vital that this situation doesn\'t erupt into fullscale war.

Technically, the way I\'m reading some of the virus infection descriptions,
using Radar to "view" a virus-infected systems (or having radio contact with
an infected ground computer) would cause you to "infect" the ship.

This is pretty silly, so I personally ignore it (ie, I agree with Cynthia).

Also note that I\'d be surprised if any of the Air traffic control computers
are on the Internet directly...

How many banks can you telnet into?  Or send e-mail to their primary
computers?  On the other hand, they do have modem links into the Fed, as I
understand it, so once the fed goes, all the rest of the banks (in the US) go.

This was the topic that really made me want to respond :)

I used to work on a heavily automated assembly line putting together
computer disk drives -- There was an internal network and we were heavily
automated.  Shutting down any one of several computers would have hosed us
until that system was repaired.  But:

1)  Although all the stations were computerized, the "work stations" weren\'t
on the internet or anything.  They were on a reasonably small LAN.

2)  Although we had a lot of automation, the automation didn\'t necessarily
talk to one another.  We had several "Robot" stations, but the "work
station" computer didn\'t talk to the robot\'s "computer brain" or to our LAN.

3)  We also had an automated conveyor system for moving stuff around.  It\'s
computer controller didn\'t talk to any of the other computer systems
involved -- and we made it do things by pushing buttons.

In my estimation, it\'d be hard to grind this to a halt with an infection
like the virus -- too many of the systems are isolated from each other and
from outside contact.  You\'d almost have to infect it on purpose.

I conclude that a Virus attack on TL 8 Terra would:

a) Clobber Internet.

b) Clobber all the university computer science departments, who are on internet

c) Clobber the telecommunications industry

d) Clobber the computer soft- and hardware industry

e) Clobber the financial markets, including stock exchanges and banks.

You\'ll notice that all of these are either very dependent upon
telecommunications or are very dependent upon *heavily networked* computers.

Places like NASA and the National Labs are probably going to go down pretty
hard, too.

The manufacturing businesses -- like, say, car assembly plants -- aren\'t
going to have anything beyond their engineering and administrative computers
connected enough to the outside, easily infected networks to be brought down
hard.

IMHO, of course.

        I may be mistakem, but I believe the crewstation _includes_ a seat,
so you don\'t need a separate seat for the driver. That\'ll give you 2.5kl

I assume you\'re trying to sign up for the Traveller Mailing List. First of
all, your email address according to the header above is
"cshort@cix.compulink.co.uk" -- yes the name before the @ does matter.

Second, to receive the mailing list, you need to send a message to the list
processor, NOT the list. The message needs to be addressed to
"listproc@mpgn.com" and should contain the line "subscribe TRAVELLER
Christopher Short" -- an automated program will read your message, pick off
your return address automatically, and add you to its addressee file.

Good luck.

The possibilities of bioengineering are almost limiteless (sp?), in 
theory. At lower TLs there is not enough knowledge to know what kind of 
modifications are good ones, and in fact what happens if you tinker with 
that gene. For example if you modifie a gene that expresses as a growth 
hormone, you end up having modified growth but also with some other 
properties that have been modified.

I think that those worlds that support human kind life forms (like Vland) 
have naturally occuring life forms that have similar biochemistry to 
Earth\'s creatures biochemistry.

It is really hard to say what kind of effect life forms with different 
kind of aminoacids etc. can cause in human\'s system. Probably nothing, 
but it can also cause severe allergy or poisoning.

Well, I gotta go.

powder weapons in the back of _World Tamer\'s Handbook_. The examples in 
WTH is 11 to 13 times as expensive as the weapons listed in the main TNG 
rules and the ACR shown in FF&S is about five times as expensive as the 
one in the main rules.

Question for GDW: Is the prices derived from the FF&S and WTH rules
correct? If so, shouldn\'t you correct the price lists in the main rules?

Anyway, could someone who know about these things perhaps let me know 
the 1995 prices of whatever Traveller weapons is commonly available
today? (You know: Revolver, automatic, SMG, rifle, double-barreled shotgun,
pump action shotgun, etc.) I\'d like to know wether the main rules prices
or the other ones are the more realistic.

     Viewing the beautiful glowing orb of Porozlo from afar, who would 
     suspect that this Terran Normal world is the site of some of the most 
     vicious internecine warfare in the Regency?
     
     Porozlo\'s balkanization is the result of poor colonial planning.  Due 
     to its remarkable resemblance to Terra, Porozlo was a highly 
     sought-after system.  Colonization claims were filed by numerous 
     private and public interests, most of whom were of Solomani origin and 
     all of whom had legitimate claims.  Roughly three quarters of the 
     claims were made by colonists with corporate sponsors, the largest 
     made by Transstar, the Terran shipping megacorporation.  The remaining 
     25 percent were comprised of government-sponsored colonization 
     programs and population-relief projects.
     
     Because of the high demand for rights to the system and conflicting 
     legal claims, an impartial mediator was selected to resolve the 
     conflict.  The mediator determined that it was in the best interests 
     of all involved to distribute Porozlan land to as many of the 
     claimants as possible on a first-come, first-served basis.  Strict 
     head-count limits were imposed.  Not surprisingly, a solution that was 
     intended to make everyone happy made no one happy.  
     
     The majority of the lots were distributed among an astrographically 
     isolated Solomani group in Daibei Sector.  These Solomani were 
     primarily descended from colonists who had originally come from 
     Terra\'s Eastern and Southern European and North African regions during 
     The Rule of Man.  A large portion of the lots were distributed among 
     ethnically diverse Solomani groups from throughout the rimward portion 
     of the Imperium and the remaining lots (about 5 percent in all) were 
     given to a handful of Vilani interests and Core-based colonists of 
     mixed descent.
     
     The Imperium\'s attempt at generosity resulted in the system\'s 
     perpetual state of conflict.  After establishing footholds on the 
     planet in 161-163, many colonial settlements quickly adopted 
     isolationism as their credo and began to form their own individual 
     governments on the planet.
     
     After permits were distributed to the second wave of colonists from 
     Daibei and nearby Diaspora sectors, the colonial administration 
     encouraged an even distribution of ethnic populations among the 
     nations of Porozlo to foster a more homogeneous political environment. 
     Unfortunately, hundreds of micro-immigrations nullified the 
     Imperium\'s efforts in the subsequent decade.
     
     Remarkably, the only ethnic group that did not geographically polarize 
     itself was the Vilani.  Vilani minorities can be found in most of 
     Porozlo\'s nations.  They are frequently the educated elite, holding 
     jobs as physicians, attorneys, bankers and corporate executives.  Not 
     preoccupied by the ethnic conflict of the planet\'s other settlers, the 
     Vilani have formed their own functional niche in Porozlan society.  
     Conscious of their minority status (and the historical peril of those 
     who have held such status), the Vilani settlers have been careful not 
     to isolate themselves, so as not to incur the wrath of another 
     Porozlan ethnic group or nationality.  In fact, the dispersed Vilani 
     minority are arguably the greatest philanthropists on the planet, 
     contributing a disproportionate 22 percent of the planet\'s charitable 
     donations in an average year, while they comprise only eight percent 
     of Porozlo\'s current population.  The Vilani minority speaks Galanglic 
     in the business community but continues to speak a Vilani dialect in 
     the home and at cultural functions in order to preserve their 
     heritage. 
     
     Porozlo\'s resources were scattered enough that over the centuries, 
     further political fragmentation occurred along economic lines.  The 
     final result was a world with upward of 80 independent nations.  
     Porozlo became a textbook case on how to create a balkanized world.  
     Though Porozlo\'s population was as diverse as any in the Imperium, for 
     the most part the world avoided major wars until a dramatic event in 
     its history.
     
     The Porozlan fragmentation and a growing awareness of the planet\'s 
     limited resources gave birth to a grassroots political movement, which 
     eventually became known as the Private Ownership (PO) bloc.  The PO 
     bloc came into being during a firestorm of debate about foreign 
     investment and exploitation of Porozlo\'s resources.  The status quo 
     had been more or less pro-free trade.
     
     For two decades after the birth of the PO bloc, the majority of 
     Porozlan nations underwent revolutions of one sort or another.  It was 
     during this extremely xenophobic period that the planet became 
     registered by the Travellers\' Aid Society as an amber zone to warn 
     travellers of the danger posed by distrustful Porozlans.
     
     After 20 years of PO revolution, the pendulum began to swing the other 
     way.  Those who supported foreign investment and development united 
     under the banner of the Free Trade (FT) bloc in reaction to radical PO 
     movements.  This political schism was to become the defining event in 
     Porozlo\'s history.  Historians debate the original date of the 
     Porozlan Schism, but most place the date on either 1016, when the 
     first domestically governed megacorporate labor union (thought to be 
     the precursor of the PO bloc) formed in the nation of Stepozhevac, or 
     on 1084 when the FT bloc came into being.
     
     PO movements spread like wildfire, affecting each and every national 
     government on Porozlo.  As the PO/FT division deepened, democratic 
     governments\' elected officials became almost exclusively drawn from 
     either the PO or FT bloc.  Many of the planet\'s more dictatorial 
     governments resisted at first, but as public sentiment grew, even 
     nations led by autocratic dictators began to align themselves under 
     one banner or the other.
     
     The conflict has raged on for over a century now, with the balance of 
     power frequently shifting between the two parties.  During the last 80 
     years, the balance has settled, with the PO dominating about 30 
     percent of the planet\'s countries and just under half its population.  
     The FT bloc dominates the more technologically developed and 
     industrialized nations.  Several underdeveloped countries have fled to 
     the FT wing in recent years.  Under the guidance of Chairman Augwynne 
     Sorsi, the nation of Nemso has sponsored a ground-breaking new 
     organization, called the Free-Trade Advisory Council (FTAC), to help 
     these nations "get on their feet."  Using programs like the FTAC, the 
     Free Trade bloc has successfully swayed public sentiment to their side 
     in the interstellar region.
     
     Wars are frequent on the soil of Porozlo, with an average of six going 
     on at any one time.  The perpetual state of conflict on Porozlo 
     spurred the TAS to deny the Porozlo United Council\'s request for amber 
     zone nullification in late 1148. 
     
     While most Porozlan wars are of the brushfire variety, many escalate 
     to full-scale conflict with occasional threats of biological and 
     nuclear weapon use made by opposing countries.  The presence of 
     neutral Rhylanor curbs the use of such weapons, however.  The 
     Rhylanori senate\'s unequivocal position is non-intervention unless the 
     war escalates to the point where such weapons are used.  One Rhylanori 
     senator, who requested anonymity, brashly stated, "If the Porozlans 
     start nuking each other in our backyard, we\'re going to bring the sky 
     down on their heads."
     
     The frequency of international conflict on Porozlo has made the planet 
     a nexus for mercenary activity.  "Warworld" is the name many regional 
     mercenary units use for the besieged planet.  Because of its adverse 
     political environment, Porozlo has acquired the distinction of being a 
     "mercenary magnet" over the past three centuries.
     
     While several offworld peace initiatives and summits have been 
     sponsored by neighbors Rhylanor and Zivije, most of them have ended 
     with the representative Porozlan national delegates walking away from 
     the table in frustration.  The divisiveness between the nations of 
     Porozlo has thus far proven irresolvable.
     
     Despite the pervasiveness of warfare on Porozlo, the planet as a whole 
     is rather economically successful.  Nemso, the richest and most 
     dominant nation on Porozlo, has the population and resources of many 
     entire systems in the subsector.  The Free Trade party has dominated 
     the nation\'s parliament since the 1107 overthrow of King Syzygy, the 
     former hereditary monarch.  Many other nations, most notably Morovic, 
     New Dalmatia, Zenerabi, M\'Dwailei and Hauvania, have also prospered 
     under the auspices of the Free Trade party.
     
     Although the FT nations have been models of economic success, the 
     downside of foreign industrial exploitation is also evident in their 
     cities.  Visible signs of blight and homelessness are much more 
     prevalent in FT cities than they are in the more socially democratic 
     PO cities and countries.
     
     The main PO nations of Porozlo, including Almarac (the most populous 
     nation on Porozlo with six billion inhabitants), Anisinta, Turin, 
     Digliotti and Vyben, tend to be more militant.  Local militias, 
     created for the purpose of defending their homesteads from "invading 
     offworlders," are common in PO nations.  While PO nations are not 
     nearly as prosperous as the FT nations, it can accurately be said that 
     for the most part, their citizens live on a more economically 
     egalitarian scale.  The majority of their citizens could be classified 
     as lower middle class.
     
     Porozlo is home to a multitude of fascinating cultures and traditions. 
     The artistic community flourishes in most nations on Porozlo.  
     Political and cultural strife on a planet often fosters an active 
     artistic community and Porozlo is no exception to this rule.  Porozlan 
     poets, painters and sculptors are revered for the level of emotion 
     that their works elicit and for the quality of their craftsmanship.
     
     Porozlo remains a glorious example of a Terran Normal world.  The 
     breathable air, lush landscape, majestic mountain ranges and rich blue 
     oceans make Porozlo a top tourist attraction for travellers who are 
     smart enough to look beyond the political instability of the planet.  
     Tourists tend to choose the more politically stable countries for 
     their visits, far away from the raging fields of war.
     
     All but one of Porozlo\'s A-quality starports are located in 
     FT-controlled nations, with the most traffic at Nemso Down Starport.  
     Nemso maintains the planet\'s sole orbital facility as well, Nemso 
     Orbital.  Among PO nations, only Almarac maintains an A-level starport 
     facility at great expense to the populace.  In order to uphold the 
     virtues of the PO bloc, Almarac spares no expense to make its primary 
     port a jewel among common stones.  Though the facility is arguably the 
     most modern of all Porozlo\'s starport facilities, traffic at Almarac 
     Starport is somewhat sparse.
     
     Free traders should be warned that legal cargo in one Porozlan nation 
     is contraband in another.  Be wary of the trade laws in each nation 
     you intend to visit.  More than one trader has had his ship impounded 
     for carrying goods from an FT nation into a PO nation and vice versa.
     
     Industry is alive and well on Porozlo.  Boisterous international 
     competition for interstellar markets has fostered a progressive 
     planetary culture.  In just the last 20 years, Porozlo has advanced 
     from TL-10 to 11 in the Regency technological profile system.

    'body' => 'Hi all,

	Let\'s see; first Virus.

Yes, I think that the primary methods of preventing
infection with Virii would be to rely on "hardwiring"
a lot of your circuitry, as well as to a certain extent
reducing the amount of inter-connectedness in the system.
Perhaps a change of mentalities from "Connect everything
possible, unless it for some reson NEEDS to be separate.
This allows flexibility and redundancy" to "Connect only
what you must. For safety\'s sake. And limit most connections to data-exchange, not control." Also, while some Deyo 
chips and a lot of synaptic processors (this is the 
party line, not my opinion) were capable of circuit 
modification, in 1201 as well as 1995 that is almost unheard 
of. It should be possible to a) monitor the circuitry for 
changes, and b) find out what mechanisms the Cymbeline life-
forms used to modify themselves, and interdict them. Much 
like preventing bacteria from reproducing - perhaps the 
Cymbeline chips  need certain types of dopant, or power, or 
something which can be controlled. I remeber it being 
mentioned that even in 1130 on Dulinors\' flagship a few 
smart computer operators managed to trace and destroy the 
Virus that had infected it - after all, they took "manual"
control of the ship in time for an emergency landing.
c) limit outside access - obvious. don\'t hook up your 
transponder to your main system RAM. For crying out loud,
why would one do that anyway, at least on a warship? It\'s 
asking for intrusion/warfare. The whole Deyo hokum is very hard to beleive. Minuteman silos aren\'t on the Internet, and they don\'t have dial-in modem lines.
d) diversity - encourage several different approaches to 
computing problems. standardization taken to the extreme
is an invitation for disaster. Agree on a few conventions,
but leave it at that. And don\'t build all your military
and scout ships with identical systems. Sure, you\'ll have
maintenance complexities, but that\'s better than Virus 
controlling all your BB\'s.
e) Be frugal with computing power. Don\'t equip your toaster
with a 2 Teraflops processor just because they\'re cheap. 
besides, I think Virus would need A VERY POWERFUL processor
to become self-aware. With anything less it will just 
lay eggs and perhaps destructive Trojan Horses. It won\'t
proliferate in such an environment, and if it doesn\'t have 
a powerful system as a base it will less able to develop
successful intrusion methods for new computers.

In short; expose it, poison it, quarantine it, confuse it 
and starve it.

Now, fusion power;
	this is a fun one - lots of semi-hard science here.
The following is what I\'ve always imagined, although 
I   
 TL-9; The first Tokakmaks using magnetic confinement.
		Power conversion is through heat engines (water,
		liquid sodium, CO2 or helium)
		Fuel is Deuterium-Tritium, or He-3. Tritium 				produced by neutron bombardment or lithium.
		Laser-Inertial fusion is still not useful except
		in Daedalus drives and fusion rockets.
		Jump drive powerplants use short-duration
		intense magnetic fields (HPG-driven) to 
		boost fusion throughput to build up charge.
		These high fields allow MHD tube type power 
		conversion as well as D-D fusion. 
		see previous post for details.
TL-10; Improved magnetic confinement - supplemented by
	gravitic confinement allow higher pressures and temps.
	D-D fusion standard. 
	Heat engines still common; some thermoelectric 
	conversion used. Advantages are no moving parts, 
	higher efficiency.
	HEPlaR drives appear. These are NOT merely reheating
	of hydrogen. Instead, waste heat and radiation from the 	reactor is used to induce fusion in fuel. Gravitics 
	allow non-toroidal confinement shape, which simplifies
	thrust production. 
	Muon fusion possible for certain applications.
TL-11; Essentially as above - evolutionary improvement,
	above all more thermoelectric conversion which allows 
	smaller power plants.
	Jump drives take advantage of temporary high 	confinement pressures/temps to induce limited proton-	proton chain fusion.
TL-12; Contiued slow development. Advances in high field-	strength superconductors allow MHD tube energy 	conversion in long-duration applications.
	A reactor now resembles a HEPlaR drive with an MHD
	tube attached at the exhaust - the high-velocity
	"exhaust" is charged and passed through a magnet,
	creating current.
TL-13; Leap in capabilities due to new understanding and
	control of nuclear forces. Confinement shape can vary,
	spherical (radiation source) and cylindrical (MHD tube) 	common. Proton-proton chain standard. MHD type power 	conversion standard for most applications, including 	jump drive.
TL-14; Perfection of Proton Chain fusion.
	Jump drives now use resonant oscillation induced 	charge-separation of plasma (sending positive charges 	down one tube, negative 	down another) to build up 	potential. 
TL-15; Triple-alpha fusion used. First standard P-P chain,
	then fusing three He-4 nuclei. Charge separation 
	power conversion in all applications. 
Tl-16; Carbon catalysed fusion. CNO chain (carbon + He-4
	forms nitrogen. N + He-4 forms oxygen. O + He-4 
	reforms Carbon. ) 
Comments?

Re; missles. How about building a 7 metric tonne, 7 kl
	booster stage? attach it to a standard missle -
	presto, extended range, and when you jettison the
	booster you retain original performance ratings.

Don\'t talk to me about hackers...

My Players discovered how much fun they could have with this recently. You
wouldn\'t *believe* how much damage they could do! Any hints on how to

There was one fun moment (for me, anyway). They were trying to hijack a
Destroyer, and had got control of the computer room. They didn\'t have much
time, so their comp-tech had to work quickly. A few good rolls, and she
was in. "Okay, computer, shut down all terminals *NOW*!" Click. "Err...

FFS doesn\'t really make this clear, but I think crewstations include seats in 
their volume, I\'ve certainly never added volume to spacecraft workstations for 
seats. If you look at the waork/crewstations, they correspond to the 
cramped/adequate/roomy seats from the accomodations chapter, seeming to support 
this.

Thanks for the help.  Now I\'ve just got one more questions (doesn\'t
this get annoying?  8).  I decided to settle for .07cm of armor which
would equal an AV of 1.  No, I\'ve got a simple chassis and a moderate
front slope.  This makes the front AV 1.5.  Do I round this up to 2 or
round it down to 1?  Also, lets say that by some freak occurence I
ended up with another fractional value like 2.7, does this become an AV
of 3 or not?

Once again, thanks in advance...

C20 earth is not a good example for estimating Virus damage, because Earth is 
not part of an interstellar culture. Most TL8-9 worlds in Traveller were part of 
the Imperium, and did have starports. Most of these systems would buy in low 
tech SDBs or produce some locally to protect the world and merchant shipping 
from corsairs. This would have become more important during Hard Times as the 
Navy lost control of piracy in the wilds. 
At TL8, SDBs will use missiles and not lasers. A TL8 missile can hit a target a 
few hexes away when launched, and even do a respectable 79-1/25 damage. This 
compares to lasers which have ranges in fractions of a hex at TL8, and require 
massive HPGs to muster even fairly low damage (look at the TL10 laser in FFS, 
TL8 lasers are far, far worse). 
The situation is one where the poorest worlds are those which are most likely to 
have several megatons of nuclear warheads in orbit over them. If Virus hit 
their defence force, then the planet could be devastated. Also, while higher 
tech planets might have point defence over cities which could hold out against 
the first wave of the planet\'s own missiles launched against them (if fire 
control was insulated from communications to prevent hacking, and if Virus 
didn\'t wait to control ground defence before attacking) but lower tech planets 
wouldn\'t stand a chance.
By TL8, much of a worlds\' population already lives in cities (look at Earth) 
rendering the world more vulnerable. Worlds which aren\'t in a cold war situation 
are less likely to have decent defences, worlds which are might get jumpy and 
nuke themselves.
The \'whoops there goes my atmosphere\' effect in asteroid belts and corrosive 
atmospheres would still be significant, but low tech planets too would be 
vulnerable.

Explanations: 

Agent Type: What kind of infectious agent this diseased
is caused by. This will affect how these agents are encountered,
transmitted, etc. 

Vector Type: How the agent is delivered to the target area

Lethality: How many UNTREATED people die from the agent, randomly
spaced through the Acute phase time period.  This can be very
important...a high lethality over a very long acute phase, you get
something like AIDS, over a short acute phase you get something like
Ebola.  

Transmission type: Once the agent is introduced into the population
via the vector above, how is the disease transmitted from person to
person.  This will drastically affect the countermeasures taken. 

Contagiousness: the chance that someone will contract the
disease...this needs to have some time value associated with it,
which will depend on a lot of external factors. This, as it applies
to player characters will have to be determined by the GM on an ad
hoc basis.

Systems Affected: This is the major organ system affected by the
agent.  This will affect what physical effects, gory details, and
recovery effects there will be.

Incubation Time: The time, after initial infection, the person is
asymptomatic.  However, for many, if not all diseases, the patient
is contagious, though usually to a lesser degree than during acute
phase.

Acute Phase time: The time during which the patient has the acute
disease manifestation.  If the patient dies, it will most likely be
during this time, so this is when the patient must save vs
lethality, using the percent generated above.  For player
characters, the GM will probably want to introduce some
modification, based on CON, or medicval skill of other players or
NPC\'s.

Recovery Phase time: This is the time which is required for full
recovery from the illness, barring any optional permanent effects
imposed by the GM.

Morbidity: How sick you actually get during the acute phase.  This
is obviously going to be affected by the lethality...a highly lethal
agent is not going to make you only minorly sick, so it goes from
2-11 by adding the lethality roll.  I truncated this at Extreme
(ICU) because there\'s not really much higher you can get.  

	These tables are a rough draft. All are generated using one D10. 
The GM is left much to his/her own devices for any lingering effects
during recovery, and any and all gory details.  Permanent or
temporary loss of STR, perhaps CON, maybe even INT (Remember those
horrific 106 degree fevers burn lots of brain cells) are all
possible effects.  Certainly the character is affected somewhat
during the recovery process.

	Remember, while TL 15 medicine may be miraculous, most characters,
and indeed most of the affected populations were not able to avail
themselves of such care. It wouldn\'t take much of an pandemic to
bring the US healthcare system to its knees, and what happens when
your doctors are among the first to die (they are among the first to
be exposed...)?

Biological Warfare, some practical points.

	Biological warfare, in general, like chemical warfare, does not
seek to simply kill as many people as possible.  The ideal agent
will not only kill, but take long enough to do so that many more
people are involved in caring for the sick (and risk getting sick
themselves).  The object is to tie up as many enemy personell as
possible for the longest possible time.  An ideal agent will make
people very sick for a long time, BUT with a low lethality rate, but
high incapacitation rate, so you end up with a growing pool of
recovering but non combat worthy personnel.  This will further
strain the resources of your enemy, since, if the disease is
survivable with sufficient care, enemy morale will suffer greatly if
the resources for that care aren\'t allocated.

	Tactical uses of BW are also numerous.  If you could cause 60-70%
of the enemy to come down with a minor, but incapacitating stomach
bug 24 hrs before your assault, you\'ll be in good shape.

	BW also doesn\'t require nearly as high tech as nukes, even.  Once
the basic principles of bacteriology and virology are known (TL
4-5???) BW becomes a possibility.  In our history it was used even
before these principles were known, but I doubt some TED is going to
want to release a plague without at least being able to protect
himself from it. 

	This system can also be used to generate natural plagues on lower
tech level worlds.  The PC\'s could land on Boondock 1, a TL-3
planet, during the Black Death, for instance, or a cholera epidemic.
They could also become big heroes by `miraculously\' saving locals.
However, the higher the TL, the less likely that large epidemics are
going to occur, due to improved medical care, understanding of the
disease process, and better sanitation, so if the PC\'s run into
something like this on a higher TL world, it will most likely be due
to a BW agent, either deliberately released, or, ever so much fun
for those salvage people, accidentally released agents left over
from rebellion era BW munitions: "Hey Joe! Ever hear of this Model
6745BW45-5-23-9 105 mm shell? It looks funny, like this little cap
here..." <snap> <hisssss> "...ooops!"

	Introducing BW into the Trav universe is a little like the endless
discussion in some circles about throwing big rocks...if it\'s so
effective and cheap, why doesn\'t everyone do it? The same reason it
isn\'t done here on Earth...fear of retaliation, and the even greater
fear of not being able to control it.  Biological weapons can easily
turn and bite the wielder, even more so than nukes or chemical
weapons.  After all, nukes and nerve gas doesn\'t mutate and become
immune to your carefully hoarded stocks of antibiotics, serums and
vaccines.

	It will only be used by someone desperate or fanatical enough to
not care anymore...how often did this happen, in the chaotic waning
days of the Third Imperium? 


Part 2 will detail the LS Crichton... a research vessel being used to 
develop these kinds of agents, before it was taken over by Virus.  
How interesting...a hobbyist Virus with a biowarfare lab at it\'s 
disposal...

First, in response to Muirs\' message in issue 414 about sensor locks 
of missles for point defence purposes - with AEMS and LIne crews you had 
a 98% chance of lock, while PEMS only gave you 40%. well, remember, if
the missiles already have locked on you and are going to hit, it doesn\'t
really matter if you go active. Low power on the AEMS, yes, but if I 
was in command in such a situation, I think I\'d say "light \'em up, Ensign."

Second, some logistics questions (so to speak); I\'ve heard mentioned a few
times that a lot of homemade software is available on the Net... I for 
one would love to get my hands on some, so does anyone know which of the
various packages are the best? I\'m thinking vehicle /starship construction,
character generation, but above all - database programs and world UDP 
lists. especially something with search functions, as I frequently find 
myself asking questions like: "find all the atm=6, hyd=5-9, uninhabited 
worlds in this sector... " any and all help would be very much appreciated.

Third; are there any systems out there in charted space that contain 
unusual celestial objects such as Black Holes and Neutron Stars? currently
they appear to be common enough that one would expect at least a few in a 
region the size of Charted Space. I have an idea bouncing around in the back of my mind ( read: future paper ) and woudl like to see if it;s already been
done.

Fourth; are RICE papers something that you can just write and post, or
are the in some sense \'official\'? 

thanks for your time,

Actually Vland has very different native life that is in general poisonous

The early Vilani were taught (by grandfather or ancient robots, I forget 
which) a few techiques for converting native lifeforms to food.
The Vilani who had this knowledge ( and expanded it ) known as Shulgii (sp?)

much more important.
Get hold of a copy of Vilani & Vargr for more info.

It is really hard to say what kind of effect life forms with different

1. REGINA AS CAPITAL

In digest 395, Alvin Plummer asked:
>[Note: why isn\'t Efate, rather than Regina, capital of the subsector?  Any 
>Regina historians out there?]

- settled earlier ("settled by 75, only 15 years after the first Imperial
settlements in the Marches") Supp 11: Library Data (N-Z), GDW, USA, 1982.
Efate was settled AND incorporated into the Imperium by c. 300 but was not
considered on the "main links and branches". The end of the Main in that
direction was only considered "major" by the c. 400 map;
- more stable (higher law level, nont as close to the frontier);
- better environment (does this help? maybe Regina used to be more populous than
Efate, and "F8" only caught up later?)

A lot of the reason for the Regina subsector is that:
- it was the first one ever published (Adv 1: The Kinunir, GDW, USA, 1979).
- you can tell that the Marches was NOT randomly rolled. In one interview, Marc
Miller said that they used a modified method of rolling up the systems, but then
modified them to suit. It is my belief that the Spinward Main was _created_ to
allow for low-jump adventurer ships to still have heaps of places to go.
- an explanation is given as to why this end of the Marches was preferred over
the rimward end: the embryonic Sword Worlds presented a barrier to movement.

Chassis size was used to calculate hits as well.

Another option is this: humans are about 90% water. Now, in the metric system,
1 cubic centimetre of water weighs 1 gram. OK, so I am 85 kg, therefore you
can say I am approximately 85 kg.

This should at least give you a ball-park figure, Jerry.

3. NUCLEAR MISSILES

To Roger Myhre:
The one question that no-one has answered is this: can you really shoot down all
those missiles?

Way back in the first edition of Harpoon, they gave a real-life example of four
Libyan attack boats vs a US destroyer. The Libyan\'s fired 4 missiles and the
destroyer had to shoot them all down. The destroyer\'s defences were
"rolled-back" almost to the ship. I think that in real-life the closest missile
came with 9 km, in the game it was 4 km (or something like that; I think that
the designers were trying to prove that Harpoon was very realistic!?!).

However, in the game, shooting down the missiles was still based on a random
roll - it could be different each time. And what would happen if the Libyan\'s
had been able to field 2 more (or 4 more!) ships - the destroyer would have
been toast!

In the case of missiles vs a destroyer, I agree that the range is small, the
target is big, and the missiles are far more manoeuvrable than the ship.
However, I have ALWAYS played missiles as more manoeuvrable than ships, with
much higher accelerations available. That is they can still intercept a
target which is dodging. Merrick\'s BR rules state that KKM\'s must have g-turns
equal to the target\'s evasion g-turns PLUS any DM\'s the target gains due to
success on the evasion task. This rule alone will make KKM\'s a poor weapon vs
military ships. However, contact missiles against traders make a much better
case; traders generally have poor manoeuvrability and weaponry.

Having said all this, I should say that the real reason I am not happy with
nuclear missiles because they are so against all Traveller "history". The
Imperial Rules of War negate all use of nukes, and I was dissappointed that
TNE went away from this and more towards 2300 AD, despite it being more
"realistic".

I think its a bit of strech to say "virtually all" are subsonic.
There are quite a few current Russian supersonic missiles which the
USN was quite worried about during the cold war.

There is the air-launched Kh-22 (AS-4) carried by Backfires and the
KSR-5 (AS-6) carried by Badgers.  Also, there is the ship launched
P-35 (SS-N-12) on Slava class cruisers, the P-500 (SS-N-19) on Kirov
class cruisers and the P-80 (SS-N-22) on Sovremenny class destroyers.

All of these are probably Mach 2.5+ missiles (maybe higher in terminal
dive).  Phalanx and similar systems might have 2 seconds or less of
engagement time.

IIRC from Cogs and Dogs (IDHIIFOM) wasn\'t the biochemistry of the indigenous 
life on Vland completely incompatible with the humans transplanted there 
by the Ancients?  The proto-Vilani culture had a separate class of people 
who specialized in the production of edible food.

Of course, I may be misremembering something from another game.

terminal is connected to each of the sub nets, but the physical connection
requires a dongle to complete. Only with the right dongle can you connect
into the bridge circut from the engineering terminal. Make the dongle a two
sided card, and only allow one card slot per terminal, and a given terminal
will only be able to access the net set up on the card. The card could also
have a (separate) chip for configuration details for the user.

For those unfamiliar with the term, a dongle is a small device used for
(currently) copy protection. it contains a firmware ID code, or in a few,
very rare cases, it passes data on a specific throughput path to allow
access.

More specifics: the jump computations could be reduced down below the size
of a viable Virus kernel, and be routed through a small, isolated machine
with a built-in checksum. It has two dongle options: NavComp and
JumpDriveLPU.
it works thusly:
1) the navigator generates the course.
2) the navigator gets a checksum.
3) he inserts the dongle to the course buffer, and transfers the jump
commands to the course buffer.
4) he removes the NavComp-CrsBuf dongle, checks the checksum.
5) he then tells engineering the course is in the buffer, and what the
checksum should be.
6) at jump time, the engineer checks the checksum, and then inserts his
dongle for CrsBuf-JmpDrvLPU.
7) Jump engage proceeds, and the engineer pulls his dongle.

an extra step could be included to verify the course.

since any connection is throgh special buffers, which are not capable of
executing code, AND all routes in and out are restricted to data read only,
the Virus could not change the course after it hit the buffer. The
computing is still highly distributed, requires oversight, but the data
flow is only open when in use. Also, it allows for more automated
operations, but also prevents rapid infection.

Comments?

remember... this is just an idea thrown out for your consideration.

I would round it down, but (based upon examples in T:TNE) it appears they
(GDW) rounded normally (IE, as they taught you in algebra; =>.5 goes up).

Also, a warning about the design example: I forgot to figure in the maximum
speed from the hull configuration. Mea culpa, mea maxima culpa.

In truth, jerry, pick a method that reflects the feel of your campaign; if
you\'re running a "hard as nails" approach, go ahead and round down... but
whatever you do, be consistant.

Yes

>and if so, why?!?! It makes no sense to me...
I feel the same way about the virus, but I can explain the gunfire:

Bob, firing 5 rounds as single shots, is pulling the trigger once
per round.  He has a moment to correct his aim between shots (only a 
half-second, but something). He also has sufficient strength to maintain
control of the weapon each time it jumps.

By firing a burst, Bob pulls the trigger once and all five bullets spit,
probably in the same second.  No chance to re-establish control of the 
weapon, which keeps bucking in his hand.  Note that in the same time
period, be COULD fire multiple bursts if he so chose.  He can fire two 
bursts (10 bullets) without penalty and up to 20 bullets with penalties 
for inaccuracy (the weapon is bucking quite a bit!).

Generally, burst fire for Bob would only be worthwhile if he was shooting 
at multiple enemies in an enclosed space - like in a ships corridor at 
multiple charging enemies.  In such a case, even though he loses the 
probablity of hitting his primary target (due to increased difficulty),
he is putting a lot of bullets in a small space where other enemies can 
intersect them...

Also, if Bob is more interested in keeping several enemies heads down,
a burst is probably more effective (if less likely to actually hurt anyone)
than individual shots.

I have no explination on back that far.  There was a data base fowl up that
occured Sept. 14 (Digest 414 I think)  We are working on that problem.

HI all,
	Is there currently any online message list or such that acts like
the old Traveller News Service? If so, where and how does one subscribe?
If not, would there be any interest in setting up something like that?
I have found that a "news" service like that (essentially the Traveller
equivalent of AP newswires), provided the articles are well thought out 
and resonably well written add a lot of flavor to a campaign, as well
as furnish a lot of inspiration...
 I\'m not sure of the best way to set up something like this, but  I would
guess that it would rely on submissions from all of us, and perhaps 
be screened by whoever wrote the ones we saw in Challenge..

Comments?

Explanations: 

Agent Type: What kind of infectious agent this diseased
is caused by. This will affect how these agents are encountered,
transmitted, etc. 

Vector Type: How the agent is delivered to the target area

Lethality: How many UNTREATED people die from the agent, randomly
spaced through the Acute phase time period.  This can be very
important...a high lethality over a very long acute phase, you get
something like AIDS, over a short acute phase you get something like
Ebola.  

Transmission type: Once the agent is introduced into the population
via the vector above, how is the disease transmitted from person to
person.  This will drastically affect the countermeasures taken. 

Contagiousness: the chance that someone will contract the
disease...this needs to have some time value associated with it,
which will depend on a lot of external factors. This, as it applies
to player characters will have to be determined by the GM on an ad
hoc basis.

Systems Affected: This is the major organ system affected by the
agent.  This will affect what physical effects, gory details, and
recovery effects there will be.

Incubation Time: The time, after initial infection, the person is
asymptomatic.  However, for many, if not all diseases, the patient
is contagious, though usually to a lesser degree than during acute
phase.

Acute Phase time: The time during which the patient has the acute
disease manifestation.  If the patient dies, it will most likely be
during this time, so this is when the patient must save vs
lethality, using the percent generated above.  For player
characters, the GM will probably want to introduce some
modification, based on CON, or medicval skill of other players or
NPC\'s.

Recovery Phase time: This is the time which is required for full
recovery from the illness, barring any optional permanent effects
imposed by the GM.

Morbidity: How sick you actually get during the acute phase.  This
is obviously going to be affected by the lethality...a highly lethal
agent is not going to make you only minorly sick, so it goes from
2-11 by adding the lethality roll.  I truncated this at Extreme
(ICU) because there\'s not really much higher you can get.  

	These tables are a rough draft. All are generated using one D10. 
The GM is left much to his/her own devices for any lingering effects
during recovery, and any and all gory details.  Permanent or
temporary loss of STR, perhaps CON, maybe even INT (Remember those
horrific 106 degree fevers burn lots of brain cells) are all
possible effects.  Certainly the character is affected somewhat
during the recovery process.

	Remember, while TL 15 medicine may be miraculous, most characters,
and indeed most of the affected populations were not able to avail
themselves of such care. It wouldn\'t take much of an pandemic to
bring the US healthcare system to its knees, and what happens when
your doctors are among the first to die (they are among the first to
be exposed...)?

Biological Warfare, some practical points.

	Biological warfare, in general, like chemical warfare, does not
seek to simply kill as many people as possible.  The ideal agent
will not only kill, but take long enough to do so that many more
people are involved in caring for the sick (and risk getting sick
themselves).  The object is to tie up as many enemy personell as
possible for the longest possible time.  An ideal agent will make
people very sick for a long time, BUT with a low lethality rate, but
high incapacitation rate, so you end up with a growing pool of
recovering but non combat worthy personnel.  This will further
strain the resources of your enemy, since, if the disease is
survivable with sufficient care, enemy morale will suffer greatly if
the resources for that care aren\'t allocated.

	Tactical uses of BW are also numerous.  If you could cause 60-70%
of the enemy to come down with a minor, but incapacitating stomach
bug 24 hrs before your assault, you\'ll be in good shape.

	BW also doesn\'t require nearly as high tech as nukes, even.  Once
the basic principles of bacteriology and virology are known (TL
4-5???) BW becomes a possibility.  In our history it was used even
before these principles were known, but I doubt some TED is going to
want to release a plague without at least being able to protect
himself from it. 

	This system can also be used to generate natural plagues on lower
tech level worlds.  The PC\'s could land on Boondock 1, a TL-3
planet, during the Black Death, for instance, or a cholera epidemic.
They could also become big heroes by `miraculously\' saving locals.
However, the higher the TL, the less likely that large epidemics are
going to occur, due to improved medical care, understanding of the
disease process, and better sanitation, so if the PC\'s run into
something like this on a higher TL world, it will most likely be due
to a BW agent, either deliberately released, or, ever so much fun
for those salvage people, accidentally released agents left over
from rebellion era BW munitions: "Hey Joe! Ever hear of this Model
6745BW45-5-23-9 105 mm shell? It looks funny, like this little cap
here..." <snap> <hisssss> "...ooops!"

	Introducing BW into the Trav universe is a little like the endless
discussion in some circles about throwing big rocks...if it\'s so
effective and cheap, why doesn\'t everyone do it? The same reason it
isn\'t done here on Earth...fear of retaliation, and the even greater
fear of not being able to control it.  Biological weapons can easily
turn and bite the wielder, even more so than nukes or chemical
weapons.  After all, nukes and nerve gas doesn\'t mutate and become
immune to your carefully hoarded stocks of antibiotics, serums and
vaccines.

	It will only be used by someone desperate or fanatical enough to
not care anymore...how often did this happen, in the chaotic waning
days of the Third Imperium? 


Part 2 will detail the LS Crichton... a research vessel being used to 
develop these kinds of agents, before it was taken over by Virus.  
How interesting...a hobbyist Virus with a biowarfare lab at it\'s

Hello, all,

My brother (Douglas Berry) directed me to this mailing list as a good
source of Traveller-related information.  I was once an avid player of
first-edition Traveller (still have the little-black-box version tucked
away), and now find my interest in the game growing again.  Thanks in
advance to the readers of this list for the help I\'m sure to find here.

My first specific question concerns spreadsheets for "Fire Fusion and
Steel" starship design.  Douglas told me he\'d seen references to Excel 
sheets for this purpose, but couldn\'t recall the details.  Any pointers 
to online archives containing them would be very greatly appreciated.

Well, in ancient Persia (Alexandrian era) they did percisely that! (well, 
maybe not a sock...)  When Alexander the Great conquered Persia and 
spent what their nobility had stashed away, there was a major economic 
boom...

[Not that I necessarily agree with Bonneville....  What we really need is

SURVIVAL!!!!!!!!
A quick view of the Regency shows them as aggressive culturally.
They have this deep desire to rebuild the Imperium - without some
of the underlying flaws that lead to its demise.

While I think they could easily enough win a war with the Regency
(especially in the 1140s or 50s long before a Regency policy of
technologic upgrade can take hold, they can flood the Regency\'s few
High Tech ships and centers with TL14 craft.  Also, at that time, they
would not have to destroy the regency - just weaken them enough to
allow the Virus in to do most of the gutting work. The Zho only have a
small border with the Regency, so its not much extra space to guard.
I wrote several lengthy notes a year or so ago describing why it\'s easy
as sin for Vampires to penetrate the Regency, coming close enough
to infect any reasonably populous world), careful cultural subjugation
could produce a local source for technologic improvement.

All the more reason to remove a bad example, I should think.

All the more reason to remove or harness an expansionist (by their own
Regent\'s words!) uncontrolled small power with a higher intent to grow
that is on their doorstep.

>3)  The threat of virus still exists.  Why not keep the Regency in its
>     present state as a buffer zone?

Let\'s see....
1) Virus is a short term (<100 year) threat.  The vessels will wear out
   until their numbers are too small to be millitarily threatening;
   electronics s>     themselves with the Regency.

By who?  Other than the Virus (and that decreases year by year as Vampires
die out from wear), there are no threats nearby.  Anyway, if the Regency 
is a client state (as opposed to absorbed into the Consulate), that can be 
used to limit Consulate involvement.

On the other hand, taken and digested, the Regency\'s resources could better
protect the Zho if they were under Zho control....

>     In short, I believe the status quo is the likely future.

I agree, but mostly due to a decision by GDW to keep the Regency like 
the Imperium used to be in an
attempt to keep some of their existing audience when they presented TNE,
(even though if the Virus is as bad as GDW said it is, the Regency would
have been infected and destroyed anyway).  GDW\'s approach worked on
some of you, so they were partially successful if internally 
inconsistent.

Otherwise, a long term view for survival would drive the Zho to remove the 
Regency before it could grow into a TL15 or more power capable of reforming the 
Imperium over the next 500 years.

Sometimes, as a gamer, I rue the day that the Soviet Union fell.  Modern
military miniatures became rather boring.  TV, movies, espionage books,
and roleplaying lost a good setting where good and evil could battle things
out in very clear, obvious terms (Kirk\'s Klingons and the Zho were obvious
protrayals of the "Evil Soviet Empire").

As a human being, I do rather enjoy not living under the threat of immediate
nuclear annihalation - and having my son grow up that way.

Not unless he voluntarily defects :-)

Obvious: All Solomani, as members of a wayward section of the Imperium

for treason, conspiracy to act against the imperium, various weapons

When they are within Imperial borders, they are bound and protected by

"Right to manipulate?" Check your imperial laws - its not listed. Hiver
manipulation is not prosecuted unless show to have caused crimes.  Then 
it comes under conspiracy laws...  :-)

>(how does the local embassy deal with Imperial citizens who happen to be

Huh? Not sure whose embassy you are talking about.  However, embassies are
generally legal extentions of the owning nation (ie US federal law and 
law 
enforcement hold sway in a US embassy).

>     Imperial Client States
>(What exactly can an Imperial Citizen do in a Client state that he can\'t

Whatever he is granted by the Client State\'s law.  Imperial law does not
hold in a client state.  Though extradition to the Imperium might be a 
Client state law.....

Note that most Imperial law has to do with interplanetary commerce, 
travel, 
and technology limitations.  The rest is planetary law, which imperial law
generally respects.

The Reformation Coalition has moved on a fair way since I wrote this adventure. 
You may need to find some new frontier worlds to relocate the adventure to, but 
it fits fairly flexibly into any pre Regency contact time period.

This is a renovation and fleshing out of the first adventure seed I ever posted, 
which was really only the introduction to a campaign. The adventure centres 
around the Dark Century II which I posted a few weeks back, I\'m afraid I\'ll have 
to rely on someone who gets digest mail to post the digest number that the 
design appeared in. Anyway, here goes with the first of six weekly (maybe, 
depends how much spare time I get) parts.

The adventure starts on Aubaine/Aubaine 0738. The exact date is not important 
but it should generally be early in the life of the Reformation Coalition, when 
they are still desperate for any ships they are offered. The adventure is 
suitable for any number of players, as the encounters can be scaled to match the 
size and talent of any party.

Referee\'s Background:
Austin Farlos is an extremely wealthy and greedy man. For many years, he was a 
member of the crew of a far trader, drifting from system to system, trying to 
make ends meet. Then, one day, while his fellow crewmembers were running sensor 
checks at New Martham/Thoezennt 0221, prior to jumping out of the system, an 
anomalous densitometer reading from a planetoid in the asteroid belt was 
recorded. The ship\'s launch was dispatched to investigate and a heavily damaged 
naval facility was discovered. On closer inspection, large warehouses of 
starship components were discovered undamaged. Virus had been unable to infect 
these stores, as sensor an comms antennas had been destroyed in the attack which 
led to the base\'s abandonment. The ship returned to Coalition space to stake a 
finder\'s claim on the cache. 
Back on Aubaine, Austin arranged for the other crew members to meet with a 
tragic and fatal grav vehicle accident (he believed), leaving him the sole 
recipient of a claim worth hundreds of megacredits. Fuelled by an insatiable 
greed and sense of ambition, Austin decided to invest his money in a venture 
calculated to bring returns tens of times greater than any stock deal. His time 
in the wilds provided inspiration, he had seen how small numbers of high tech 
troops could allow a TED to rule, so he reasoned that others would pay well for 
the services of high tech mercenaries to preserve or disrupt the status quo. 
This left him with one further problem, his mercenaries would need a starship 
for support and transport, but the only ones available were battered relic 
ships, as the Coalition had control of the shipyards and all new ship 
construction.
He decided to trick the Coalition into building the ship he wanted. He wrote a 
clause into his will, stating that on his death, the Coalition would inherit his 
fortune, one the one condition that it was used to construct a ship as a 
memorial to him, from ship plans he commissioned himself. This was done to 
prevent the questions that would have been asked if he donated the money while 
still alive, and prevents him from being a suspect when the ship is stolen from 
the Coalition.
After his death was staged (lost at sea on Aubaine, no body recovered), the 
Coalition was only happy to add another ship to its fleet, and so the Dark 
Century class Stealth Destroyer was constructed. As the adventure begins, the 
Coalition is recruiting the finest crew it can for the Century\'s shakedown 
cruise. Austin too is doing some recruiting, both among mercenaries and the 
shipyard security..........
Getting involved

"During the past few weeks, there have been rumours surfacing that the Coalition 
is about to launch the first of a new class of Destroyers. The media is saying 
little, but people you know who work for the Coalition and trusted freelancers 
are spreading the word. The Destroyer is being constructed secretly, word has it 
that it is some kind of memorial, which is to be unveiled as a surprise. At one 
of the Transtown bars you overheard an argument between two young naval hotshots 
as to which would be picked for assignment on the new ship. There\'s a sense of 
expectation in the air, and many RCES personnel are working far harder than 
usual, trying to get noticed."

The players are approached by a Coalition admin officer who offers them a job at 
+50% wages for a few weeks on a special assignment. If pressed she will raise 
this offer to double wages (difficult:bargaining), but no further. If asked for 
details of the assignment, she will be able to provide nothing, other than a 
time and place for a complete briefing. Players can be offered jobs as naval 
personnel, ship\'s troops, or \'trouble-shooters\' for the Century\'s first tour of 
duty, depending on skills available. If characters are interested, they are to 
report for briefing at the underwater shipyards at 1900 tomorrow. Characters who 
are already active RC personnel may be told simply to report to the shipyards 
for briefing.

The Shipyards

The underwater shipyards were constructed with major Schalli assistance in NE2, 
to serve the growing needs of the RC. The shipyards nestle in a giant atoll in 
the temperate waters of the northern hemisphere of Aubaine. Above the water a 
500m diameter dome provides docks for passenger and freight ships and grav 
vehicles, and accommodations and some offices for the human component of the 
workforce, who largely prefer to live in the sunlight. From the surface 
facility, a large tower carries several freight and personnel elevators down to 
the under water facility. The hub underwater is very similar to the facility 
above water, although there is a much greater Schalli presence. From the hub six 
smaller tunnels fan out to the construction bays of various sizes located on the 
edge of the atoll.
The shipyards were built for capacity instead of luxury, so all doors except 
emergency bulkheads are manual, and although clean, there are places where the 
seals around tunnel joints leak slightly, allowing water to run through the mesh 
floor into drainage tunnels. This is not due to any lack of structural 
integrity, but instead to Schalli architects who believe in sufficient instead 
of absolute waterproofing, who look on in amazement at how human workers try to 
block up every last leak, where there really is no danger.

Maps don\'t really travel well in email, so I\'ll give some descriptions of some 
stock locations in the starport which you can join together to taste:

Construction Hangar:
The hangar space is about 100m x 400m, usually several ships are in construction 
at once in a single hangar. The hangar is filled with water, and the roof of the 
hanger is constructed of transparent plastic. This can be opened to allow ships 
to launch, but normally it remains closed to persuade the local wildlife to 
remain outside, while still aiding with the lighting of the space. On all sides 
of the hangar, \'walls\' about 10m wide and 60m high contain offices and computer 
facilities for the projects underway in the hangar. These offices have large 
windows looking both out to the sea and into the hangar. Both the natural and 
artificial lights tend towards a green or blue colour which the Schalli find 
most comforting. This would make the place slightly depressing for the human 
workers, but the scale of the place makes it impressive and inspiring. The 
machinery constructing the ships gives a background sound of rhythmic thumping, 
very low and not so loud it can\'t be ignored, but there nonetheless if you 
listen. Although the offices and workspaces in the walls of the hangar are 
comparatively free of leaks, the air still has a slightly salty smell, and is 
cold and slightly damp.

Office
The offices in the surface facilities are decorated in warm colours, browns, 
beiges etc. The   floors are covered with tightly woven carpet, chosen more for 
durability than any comfort consideration. Most offices have a desk with a 
networked terminal, and two or three chairs. There is considerable variation in 
the state of the offices, some tidy with pot plants, others looking like a bomb 
just hit them, with papers stacked chaotically on desks, others give the 
impression that if a bomb was to hit them, it would probably tidy the place up a 
bit.

Briefing Room (surface facility) 
The briefing rooms are about 6m by 10m, with windows along one of the longer 
sides. Slatted blinds can be closed down over these windows as necessary, and 
projection equipment linked to the facility computers is embedded in the 
ceiling. Chairs are arranged in rows, to seat about 60.

The players arrive at the shipyards on one of the many commuter hydrofoils which 
carry workers to and from nearby islands. On arrival they are escorted a short 
way to a briefing room.

\'The briefing room is already quite full when you enter, with several people 
standing at the back. You estimate that there must be about seventy people 
standing in on this briefing. Another small group enters the briefing room and 
stand next to you. The doors are closed and Sid Papagopolis takes the stand:
"You are all here because you are the best available. Don\'t let that go to your 
heads, the cream of the service are almost without exception engaged off world 
at the moment. Nonetheless you represent one of the better crew we have 
gathered. This is as it should be for the first cruise of the RCS Dark Century."
A video image is presented onto the wall behind him, showing an almost completed 
ship in a wet dock. There is a stunned murmur as the camera zooms out to show a 
scout courier undergoing a refit next to it, completely dwarfed by its 
neighbour. [Average:(EDU + INT)  to estimate the size at about 1000 displacement 
tons]. The video image shimmers in shades of blue and green from the light 
filtering through from the surface of the water above, but the ship is still 
clearly distinct. Black and streamlined, it looks like some monstrous predator 
of the prehistoric oceans. Sid continues, "The Century was a gift to the 
Coalition. Some of you may remember report\'s of Austin Farlos\' death in a storm 
about a year ago. He was an extremely wealthy man, possibly one of the richest 
in the coalition due to a massive finder\'s claim on a cache at an old naval 
base. His will asked that his fortune be given to the Coalition, on the 
condition it be used to build this ship as a memorial to him. We had been having 
trouble funding enough ships to use the dock capacity here, so this was not an 
opportunity to pass up. Her first mission will be a routine patrol through safe 
systems, we wouldn\'t want to risk losing her to an unexpected malfunction in the 
wilds. Now ladies and gentlemen, any questions?".
Sid will answer any questions the players have.
-If the players ask about pay, they will find that some people are being paid 
double, allowing them to get that pay if they haven\'t already.
-Questions about the Century can be answered from the design. If the players 
aren\'t forthcoming with questions, then NPCs should ask questions so the players 
now some of the key facts about (eg. stealth design), but don\'t give everything 
away unless the characters specifically ask.
-Questions about the planned route cannot be answered until the Century leaves, 
for security reasons, but it lies entirely within safe systems.
-Questions about rank/position onboard ship should be answered as you wish. If 
characters merit it, there is no harm in allocating command positions.

After the briefing, the character are assigned clean, if spartan accommodation 
in the shipyard facility before departure tomorrow. The accommodation is not on 
the Century, as except for the Captain\'s stateroom, the quarters are somewhat 
uncomfortable.

Things that go bump in the night....
The characters are woken in the middle of the night by an announcement on the 
intercom to their room. "We appear to have a situation here in the Century\'s 
Hangar. Could any available personnel report to the hangar immediately. This is 
the head of security, I repeat all available personnel to hangar four." 
Characters should try to get involved now. Any who don\'t will get included again 
in a short while, but at least a couple need to head for the hangar (repeat the 
message with threats of action against those who don\'t respond if necessary). 
Heading to the hangar the characters will be surprised by how few people there 
are around. One or two maintenance and security personnel are up and about, but 
even they don\'t seem concerned by the warning you heard. (The head of security 
put the announcement through only to their rooms).
	Some players may try to wake some more people. This is fine, but as 
they\'ll end up working with the players later in this scenario, limit it to only 
a couple of NPCs, the rest either don\'t want to know, or are sound asleep. 
Anyone trying to contact security about the message will be told that something 
must have gone wrong with the intercom. They will be told to continue directly 
to the hangar and not to bother waking anyone else. They will be told that some 
workmen have been attacked by a native creature which has somehow got into the 
hangar and then the line will fizz and go dead. When they arrive at the hangar, 
there is nobody around. The observation gallery the players enter looks into the 
hanger, but they can\'t see anybody working inside. Observation:Average to spot a 
pair of feet sticking out from behind some chairs in the observation gallery. 
The feet belong to a dead security guard, shot dead and crudely hidden, there is 
another similar body next to it. The body is still quite warm, especially 
considering the clammy cold of the air. There is no ID with the guard, but his 
weapon (a gauss pistol with full tranq clip) is still present. There is no sign 
of the killer, and the intercom is dead. Within seconds, the characters are 
distracted by further events:
\'Looking through the window into the dark hangar, you can barely make out the 
shape of the Century, the spotlights shining through the water picking it out as 
a piece of more solid darkness. However, as you look, something seems wrong. 
External lights on the ship are flickering into life, and you can make out the 
rising whine of contra-grav powering up. As its weight is reduced, the Century 
begins to lift through the water like a rising bubble, smashing through the 
clear plastic roof of the hanger, leaving shards of plastic tumbling down in its 
wake, like rain in slow motion. Within seconds of its passing through the 
ceiling an alarm is triggered. Sirens split the silence asunder, and the blue 
and black of the hangar is lit by strobing red lights giving a hellish 
appearance.
(referee: The head of security, Trefin Galth is framing the players for helping 
with the theft of the Dark Century. As his word is widely trusted, and he has 
access to anywhere in the station, he makes a fairly good job of it. The 
evidence he will use against the players includes:
He supplied the starship thieves with copies of the player\'s door passes.
He has planted quantities of gold in the player\'s rooms.
He has spliced together footage of the thieves entering the facility with 
security camera footage of the characters answering his announcement.
Any incriminating evidence in the computers has been either deleted or tightly 
encrypted.
He has dispatched a unit of security guards to the observation lounge, where 
they will find the characters, and the dead guards)

     On the fringes of Regency space in the Spinward Marches lies 
     Mertactor, a nexus for mercantile activity.
     
     As a planet on the frontier, Mertactor is known for its free 
     spiritedness and lawlessness.  Felons fleeing the authority of the 
     Regency Navy, RQS and/or bounty hunters frequently stop off at 
     Mertactor on their way to the independent worlds and client states 
     spinward and rimward of the Regency.  Merchants carrying illegal goods 
     find Mertactor to be the ideal port to sell their wares.  For the 
     disenfranchised, disillusioned and disingenuous, Mertactor is the last 
     port on a journey to the outlands of unincorporated space.
     
     The first colonists set foot on the system mainworld\'s terra firma in 
     the early 300s.  The majority of lots had been purchased by Moran 
     interests, which, under pressure from the Moran government, designated 
     Mertactor (then known as 567-910) as a population overflow world.  
     Consequently, Mora issued the Relocation Initiative of 324.  The 
     initiative was not looked well upon by the displaced colonists or the 
     small band of colonists already on 567-910.  Although Mora publicly 
     used "population relief" as their motive for the deportation, the 
     deportees included an inordinate number of religious dissidents, 
     ex-cons and other malcontents.  Draw your own conclusions.
     
     To villify the Moran Matriarchs, the colonists deported from Mora 
     named their world after the notorious freebooter, Wilhelm Mertactor, 
     who had raided, raped and pillaged the coreward subsectors of 
     Gushemege in the twilight years of the Ramshackle Empire.  An 
     ambitious public relations campaign by the Moran Matriarchs was 
     demoralized and many a political career fell by the wayside in the 
     ensuing scandal.
     
     Surprisingly, the Mertactans refused the clemency of the Moran 
     government in 328, when they were offered repatriation as compensation 
     for their "unjust deportation."  The Mertactan colonists had become 
     accustomed to their small but verdant new home and the majority 
     decided to stay.  By appealing to the IISS Exploration department\'s 
     colonial bureau, Mertactor was granted independence.  Imperial 
     officials saw this as an opportunity to prevent the relocation scandal 
     from travelling all the way back to the Iridium Throne.  As part of 
     the deal, the IISS was allowed to establish a base on Mertactor.  It 
     wasn\'t until after the Fourth Frontier War that Mertactor finally 
     accepted overtures made by the Imperial Government to apply for 
     membership.
     
     Descending from working-class deportees, Mertactans are proud of their 
     uncompromising heritage.  Mertactans tamed the wilds of their planet, 
     forging an advanced and forward-thinking society.  The Mertactan 
     Chamberlords reserved approximately 25 percent of the planet\'s 
     wilderness as preserves to avoid the ecological calamities that had 
     occurred elsewhere in the region due to reckless colonial bootstrap 
     programs.  The remaining portion of land was tendered to offworld 
     corporate interests with a mind to develop the planet\'s resources and 
     promote trade and industry.  In order to preserve their independence, 
     however, the Chamberlords carefully screened out any megacorporations, 
     megacorporate shadow companies and sectorwide corporations in order to 
     prevent a takeover attempt by any one corporate entity.
     
     Their conservative approach backfired and industry never really took 
     off on Mertactor.  Seeking to teach the upstart colonists a lesson, 
     the megacorporations had colluded with mid-sized corporations to 
     boycott the Mertactans.  Employing every type of coercion imaginable, 
     the megacorporations managed to squelch independent-minded investors 
     from circumventing the boycott.
     
     Undaunted, the Mertactan merchant fleet took the initiative and began 
     establishing trade agreements with the worlds of the Daryen 
     Confederation and the Sword Worlds.  Famous Mertactan free trader and 
     gambler Michaela Wallace took her business all the way to the fringes 
     of the Zhodani Consulate, and established trade ties with the Zhodani 
     that have survived numerous frontier wars and exist to this day.  
     While most of the early Spinward Marches colonies also traded with the 
     established interstellar governments of the region, few dispute that 
     Mertactan mercantile savvy can open twice as many doors in half the 
     time.
     
     Modern Mertactan industry is essentially just subsistence for the 
     planet\'s lucrative mercantile sector.  Rather than a producer of 
     industrial or agricultural goods, Mertactans like to think of their 
     system as "the best damned conduit for trade in the Regency."
     
     Landing at Mertactor downport can be a harrowing experience.  The 
     unregulated close orbit and airspace of the planet are subject to more 
     accidents per capita than on any planet in the sector.  While there 
     are ample spaceports on the planet, only the B-quality facility in the 
     capital city of Seacheard and the C-quality installation in Kaydah 
     provide services for interstellar craft.
     
     While dodging free traders and air/rafts, visiting travellers will be 
     impressed by the lush earth and blue skies of Mertactor.  Thanks to an 
     absence of big industry and an abundance of scattered wilderness 
     preserves, the planet has been able to maintain its clean air and 
     natural landscape.  Due to the planet\'s rather small size and close 
     horizon, the clear azure skies seem to almost surround the reclining 
     viewer.
     
     Offworlders are frequently uncomfortable with prolonged exposure to 
     Mertactor\'s low gravity.  Generally, hostels that cater to offworlders 
     provide 1G suites to appease those who can\'t abide Mertactan 
     lightfootedness for extended periods of time.
     
     Mertactor\'s thriving tourist industry offers a plethora of activities 
     to visiting travellers.  In the city of Seacheard, visitors will be 
     astonished by the beauty of the Daryen flame sculpture exhibit at the 
     Seacheard Museum of Art.  Donated by First Frontier war hero, Admiral 
     Koenig, the exhibit features some of the finest Daryen artwork to be 
     produced in the last millenium.  At the Colonial History Museum, 
     visitors may view artifacts, holovids and antique equipment from the 
     Spinward Marches\' colonial past.  Of particular note is an exhibition 
     featuring what the museum\'s curator claims are the original blueprints 
     for the Type-S scoutship prototype.  Children will enjoy visiting The 
     Wild Frontier, Seacheard\'s largest amusement park replete with an 
     imported Moran virtual reality entertainment center.
     
     Inghvernar, Mertactor\'s largest ocean, lies 280 km to the west of 
     Seacheard.  Mertactans on holiday flock to Inghvernar\'s golden 
     beaches.  Well-travelled offworlders will be less impressed by the 
     beachfront of this body of water which would only constitute a large 
     lake on most larger planets.  On Inghvernar\'s east coast is the 
     Lubvenar Fossil Museum, where travellers can discover the rich natural 
     history of Mertactor through an exhilariting series of exhibits and 
     holodynamic displays.
     
     Kaydah, the seat of government, features the impressive Mertactan 
     Legislature Building (MLB).  Constructed of reinforced synthetic 
     sandstone, this ivy-draped obelisk seems to thrust right out 
     Mertactor\'s terrestrial crust and through the planet\'s thick 
     equatorial jungle as if it had been there since time immemorial.  
     Standing atop Mount Aseldon, the MLB looks over the busy streets of 
     northern Kaydah like an alert sentry.
     
     On the southern end of the city, is the Plankwell Subsector Capital 
     Building.  Though the Capital\'s architecture is aesthetically pleasing 
     with its sharp edges and metallic industrial styling, political 
     representatives from throughout the subsector complain about the 
     dearth of office space in the building.  The building was intended to 
     be much larger when the subsector capital was set to be on neighboring 
     system, Collace.  However, when the Mertactan Chamberlords 
     successfully lobbied the Archduke to establish the capital on 
     Mertactor, they immediately contracted a local architecture firm to 
     design the building.  Due to the time constraints of the agreement, 
     the job was rushed, with the result being an attractive but largely 
     inadequate building.
     
     Despite the Mertactan historical animosity toward Mora, the native 
     government is rather obviously influenced by that of the domain 
     capital.  While not a matriarchy, women traditionally get preference 
     for most cabinet posts and tend to be elected to Chamberlord positions 
     at a rate of just over 60 percent on Mertactor.  The Chamberlords are 
     a select group of nine individuals, elected for lifelong terms by a 
     subordinate network of sheriffs, who are popularly elected by the 
     rather disproportionately sized counties of Mertactor.
     
     As befits any cosmopolitan world, the fashion and culture of Mertactor 
     are heavily influenced by visiting merchants and adventurers.  
     "Anything goes," is the motto on Mertactor.  One will find visiting 
     travellers sporting anything from traditional Vilani lagaash robes to 
     the virtual nudity of Glistenite tailored vaccsuits.  The jaded 
     Mertactans are nonchalant and accepting of such diversity.
     
     Perhaps the most outstanding educational establishment on the planet 
     is the Mertactor Mercantile Academy.  While the academy is on par with 
     most other Regency educational facilities for the most part, its 
     language department is outstanding.  Just about every language spoken 
     within 80 parsecs is taught at the academy, including each and every 
     vargr language in the Extents.  The academy emphasizes cultural 
     behaviors and idiosynchrasies as well in order to train the ambitious 
     merchant cadet for any eventuality.
     
     Mertactan trading companies benefit from the presence of the academy.  
     Some of the most finely trained merchant personnel in the Regency can 
     be found in Mertactan trading companies.  Mertactan traders are known, 
     however, to be quite bloodthirsty in their competition for business 
     insystem and will stop at nothing to obtain their goals.  The rather 
     ineffectual law enforcement administrations of Mertactor are unable to 
     prevent trading blocs and factions from colluding, bribing, embezzling 
     and on occasion shooting each other to death.  
     
     Within the last 80 years, the rimward encroachment of aslan ihatei has 
     had an interesting effect on the mercantile subculture.  Disputes 
     between trading companies are now frequently resolved by dueling.  
     Unfortunately, the aslan code of honor is absent in Mertactan dueling. 
     Shooting or stabbing one\'s opponent in the back or poisoning his food 
     the evening before the duel is not uncommon.
     
     Visiting free traders should not fear, however.  Oddly enough, the 
     virulence shown by one fellow Mertactan trader to another is not 
     extended to offworlders.  It is thought that a general sense of pity 
     for the poorly trained foreign trader makes him unworthy of such 
     treatment.  The prevailing attitude is "if he\'s not Mertactan, he\'s no 
     good at trading anyway!"  Though you\'ll never hear a Mertactan say 
     this in public!
     
     The Mertactan Free Trade Administration operates the planet\'s sole 
     orbital starport and city.  Built in 1004, FTA Orbital was originally 
     intended as a place where offworlders could comfortably trade without 
     having to make planetfall.  The idea never took hold with visiting 
     merchants, however.  Declining public funds resulted in the 
     government\'s inability to properly maintain the facility.  FTA Orbital 
     quickly deteriorated into a D-level facility.  Ironically, trade 
     traffic has actually increased over 300 percent at FTA Orbital since 
     the decline.  FTA Orbital now features the most active black-market 
     trade in the subsector.
     
     To coin an ancient Terran metaphor, Mertactor has a Jekyll-and-Hyde 
     culture.  To offworlders and potential trading partners, Mertactans 
     are amiable and welcoming, while to one another they are the most 
     vicious of opponents, professionally speaking.  While the divisiveness 
     of Mertactan society may appear anarchic or perhaps downright hostile, 
     it is embraced by Mertactans as an integral part of their culture.  To 
     survive in a universe fraught with danger and deception, Mertactans 
     believe that "It is better to do unto others before they do unto you."

	In response to the previous posting concerning Zho policy
vis-a-vis the Regency; 
I think it is unlikely they would invade the Regency for several
reasons:
a) The Regency is still powerful - it encompasses the better part of three sectors, all of which are quite heavily militarized. The Imperium had just fought a war there, and had always expected troubles with the Zhos. Thus a large 
proportion of the Imperial Navy would be deployed in the Regency area before 
the Rebellion - and no units beyond Corridor were used up in the Final war.

b) The Regency is no direct threat. While powerful enough to be difficult
to conquer, it hasn\'t the ability to wage offensive warfare. In fact, the 
Imperium hasn\'t done so against the Zhodani since the First Frontier war.

c) All the arguments concerning buffer zones, etc apply and have already 
been repeated many times - if you aren\'t convinced by these arguments I 
suggest you are so convinced of the rightness of your point of view that
one more post will hardly change your mind.

finally, the Zho\'s DIDN\'T invade. That\'s a \'fact\'. why is for Regecy era 
academics to discuss... although I think they were well advised to not
invade.

	Let\'s see; first Virus.

Yes, I think that the primary methods of preventing
infection with Virii would be to rely on "hardwiring"
a lot of your circuitry, as well as to a certain extent
reducing the amount of inter-connectedness in the system.
Perhaps a change of mentalities from "Connect everything
possible, unless it for some reson NEEDS to be separate.
This allows flexibility and redundancy" to "Connect only
what you must. For safety\'s sake. And limit most connections to data-exchange, not control." Also, while some Deyo 
chips and a lot of synaptic processors (this is the 
party line, not my opinion) were capable of circuit 
modification, in 1201 as well as 1995 that is almost unheard 
of. It should be possible to a) monitor the circuitry for 
changes, and b) find out what mechanisms the Cymbeline life-
forms used to modify themselves, and interdict them. Much 
like preventing bacteria from reproducing - perhaps the 
Cymbeline chips  need certain types of dopant, or power, or 
something which can be controlled. I remeber it being 
mentioned that even in 1130 on Dulinors\' flagship a few 
smart computer operators managed to trace and destroy the 
Virus that had infected it - after all, they took "manual"
control of the ship in time for an emergency landing.
c) limit outside access - obvious. don\'t hook up your 
transponder to your main system RAM. For crying out loud,
why would one do that anyway, at least on a warship? It\'s 
asking for intrusion/warfare. The whole Deyo hokum is very hard to beleive. Minuteman silos aren\'t on the Internet, and they don\'t have dial-in modem lines.
d) diversity - encourage several different approaches to 
computing problems. standardization taken to the extreme
is an invitation for disaster. Agree on a few conventions,
but leave it at that. And don\'t build all your military
and scout ships with identical systems. Sure, you\'ll have
maintenance complexities, but that\'s better than Virus 
controlling all your BB\'s.
e) Be frugal with computing power. Don\'t equip your toaster
with a 2 Teraflops processor just because they\'re cheap. 
besides, I think Virus would need A VERY POWERFUL processor
to become self-aware. With anything less it will just 
lay eggs and perhaps destructive Trojan Horses. It won\'t
proliferate in such an environment, and if it doesn\'t have 
a powerful system as a base it will less able to develop
successful intrusion methods for new computers.

In short; expose it, poison it, quarantine it, confuse it 
and starve it.

Now, fusion power;
	this is a fun one - lots of semi-hard science here.
The following is what I\'ve always imagined, although 
I   
 TL-9; The first Tokakmaks using magnetic confinement.
		Power conversion is through heat engines (water,
		liquid sodium, CO2 or helium)
		Fuel is Deuterium-Tritium, or He-3. Tritium 				produced by neutron bombardment or lithium.
		Laser-Inertial fusion is still not useful except
		in Daedalus drives and fusion rockets.
		Jump drive powerplants use short-duration
		intense magnetic fields (HPG-driven) to 
		boost fusion throughput to build up charge.
		These high fields allow MHD tube type power 
		conversion as well as D-D fusion. 
		see previous post for details.
TL-10; Improved magnetic confinement - supplemented by
	gravitic confinement allow higher pressures and temps.
	D-D fusion standard. 
	Heat engines still common; some thermoelectric 
	conversion used. Advantages are no moving parts, 
	higher efficiency.
	HEPlaR drives appear. These are NOT merely reheating
	of hydrogen. Instead, waste heat and radiation from the 	reactor is used to induce fusion in fuel. Gravitics 
	allow non-toroidal confinement shape, which simplifies
	thrust production. 
	Muon fusion possible for certain applications.
TL-11; Essentially as above - evolutionary improvement,
	above all more thermoelectric conversion which allows 
	smaller power plants.
	Jump drives take advantage of temporary high 	confinement pressures/temps to induce limited proton-	proton chain fusion.
TL-12; Contiued slow development. Advances in high field-	strength superconductors allow MHD tube energy 	conversion in long-duration applications.
	A reactor now resembles a HEPlaR drive with an MHD
	tube attached at the exhaust - the high-velocity
	"exhaust" is charged and passed through a magnet,
	creating current.
TL-13; Leap in capabilities due to new understanding and
	control of nuclear forces. Confinement shape can vary,
	spherical (radiation source) and cylindrical (MHD tube) 	common. Proton-proton chain standard. MHD type power 	conversion standard for most applications, including 	jump drive.
TL-14; Perfection of Proton Chain fusion.
	Jump drives now use resonant oscillation induced 	charge-separation of plasma (sending positive charges 	down one tube, negative 	down another) to build up 	potential. 
TL-15; Triple-alpha fusion used. First standard P-P chain,
	then fusing three He-4 nuclei. Charge separation 
	power conversion in all applications. 
Tl-16; Carbon catalysed fusion. CNO chain (carbon + p
	forms nitrogen. N + p forms oxygen. O + p
	reforms Carbon. ) 
Comments?

Re; missles. How about building a 7 metric tonne, 7 kl
	booster stage? attach it to a standard missle -
	presto, extended range, and when you jettison the
	booster you retain original performance ratings.
        you could even set it up so it would fit in a standard
	7ton, 7 kl shipboard launcher - just separate the 
	booster from the missile, and change the launcher software 
	so that it loads the missle, almost ejects is (but not quite),
	proceeds to load the booster stage, attaches the two, and 
	launches the sucker. Perhaps a 10,000 Cr modification to 
	a standard launcher gives you much enhanced range without
	loss of performance. yeah, you can only carry half as many missle, but 
	the salesman won\'t labour that point.

HI all,
	Someone mentioned that many TL-8 worlds woudl have imported SDB\'s
carrying nuclear ordnance and thus be subject to more Virus devastation.
I think that\'s a good point, and to a certain extent true - although I 
again doubt that the kind of SDB\'s thaht could even be maintained at
all at TL-8 would be very susceptible to Virus. The Deyo chip is TL-15 
device after all. But I do admit that you have a point.

Something related to this worries me - tha fact that detonation lasers 
are available on the civilian market for use in self-defence of starships.
Thta is putting nukes on the civilan market, guys. _Somebody_ is going 
to give in to the temptation of nuclear blackmail. I am open to any
suggestions on how to get around this problem. What I\'ve so far 
thought of is pretty limited;
a) licencing and extremely strict government control
b) limited yield of available devices. Perhaps below 30-odd kiloton, which 
makes it difficult to use as a thermonuclear trigger.
c) limited shelf-life. either use an isotope that decays, or an explosive 
that does so. 
d) Put nuclear dampers around all cities, starports, etc.

If not, you could always limit civilians to KKM\'s. They do work after all, 
and they are cheaper. They\'re just useless against military ships, unless 
fired in swarms. Mil. ships have sensors and point defence screens, antimissle
missles, gunboats, etc.Not to mention dampers.

Unfortunately that also limits the kind of self-defence a civilan ship can
put up - which means that if you\'re totally legal, you don\'t go into the wilds.

final food for thought - the Imperium self-destrcted rapidly due primarily
to the large numbers of military forces in the core regions  ( CORE, Illelish)
what were all these ships and divisions doing there? They are pretty useless
as border defence - it takes to long to get from Core to Solomani Rim or
the Marches. And you don\'t use Tigresses as pirate suppressors. whay have large 
sector fleets in the interior?

cheers,

A number of security guards, outnumbering the players by 6 people will enter the 
observation gallery. They will call for the players to drop any weapons and will 
take any who surrender to the security centre for questioning. Any resistance 
will cause security to open fire, and will look bad when protesting their 
innocence. If the party is subdued they will be taken to the security centre. If 
the party escapes, then go straight to the section on escaping. Of course, if 
the players resort to lethal force, but fudge it so security guards don\'t die 
unless the players specifically want to kill them. Charges of assault can be 
dropped once the conspiracy is uncovered, although some of the guards might hold 
a grudge.

Security guard. Veteran NPC. Combat Assets: Slug Rifle, Unarmed martial arts. 
Other Assets: Swimming 12, Small Craft 10, Electronics 7, Computer 7. Armed with 
4mm gauss rifle, no armour.


Framed!
If the players were captured above they are taken to the security centre 
(underwater facility)
\'You have been sitting in this featureless room for half an hour now, the guard 
didn\'t seem interested in anything you said, so as the door opens and you are 
escorted out , you are glad that you can at last speak to someone who will 
listen. You are shown into an office, behind a desk sits a grey haired man, with 
a smile that irritates you greatly.
The man straightens up a stack of paper, then looks up. The security guard 
remains in the room.
"I must regretfully inform you that you are all under arrest for aiding in the 
theft of the RCS Dark Century. The security video tapes show you moving through 
the base, apparently in a state or some agitation (and carrying weapons, if 
appropriate). An access card issued to (one of the characters) was used to open 
an airlock from the submarine bay. Anyway, let me play the tape, so you can see 
the evidence against you" He taps his finger on some controls set into the 
desktop. On a monitor on the wall a picture of a corridor is displayed. The 
characters are seen to run down it, followed seconds later by a group of about 
thirty armed men and women. More film follows, including pictures of the 
characters actually opening doors for the thieves. (Average:Sensors, Computer or 
EDU. The tape could have been altered by the operator, and the characters could 
have been added through computer effects. However the image processing power to 
generate the images would be considerable, and  require significant attention 
from the facility mainframe. If the players later investigate this, they will 
find conclusive evidence that the mainframes were not used. How he managed to 
get the footage I\'ll leave a mystery for now......)
As the tape finishes, another security guard enters and places a large parcel on 
the desk "Found it in the suspect\'s quarters, sir." he says stiffly. Inside are 
several bars of gold, wilds currency. "Planning a little trip away from the 
coalition then, are you?" Trefin inquires sarcastically.\'
The characters can argue their innocence, but talking to Trefin is like talking 
to a smirking brick wall.
The characters are lead back to the cells. By this point they should suspect 
that Trefin is framing them, but they will be helpless to prove their innocence 
while incarcerated. Average:Legal - The characters are in a very bad situation. 
The evidence already presented against them will possibly be sufficient, and as 
Head of Security, Trefin can continue adding evidence as necessary. It would be 
sensible to try to escape to find evidence to prove their innocence. A lawyer 
contacted for Cr100 will give the same opinion. Trefin now has the players in 
his hands, but he has begun to fear that their service records might lead to an 
investigation which could uncover him, or that the trial could take too little 
time, in which case it wouldn\'t disrupt the pursuit of the Century at all. He 
decides to let the players escape, in the hope that their flight will occupy the 
authorities.

Meanwhile, the Dark Century has escaped. It briefly engaged a gazelle CE, which 
was destroyed within minutes from a particle accelerator hit which triggered a 
chain of massive internal explosions, ripping the ship apart. As the Navy 
believes it can track it through the players, they are not pursuing it, as they 
cannot risk losing any more precious ships or crews. 

Trefin Galth. Veteran NPC. Combat Assets:Energy Pistol, Unarmed Martial Arts, 
Slug Pistol. Other Assets: Leadership 12, Computer 14, Electronics 12.  Carries 
a TL13 2cmCC Laser
Trefin arrived on Aubaine from \'somewhere in the wilds\' about ten years ago. 
Despite his shaded background, his technical skill made him a successful 
security guard.
Motivations
Spade Queen: Trefin is ruthless and will go to any length to achieve his ends. 
He takes sadistic pleasure not in others physical suffering, but in their 
frustration and helplessness when he manipulates others against them. He 
engineered a scandal which removed his predecessor in the job.
3 Diamond: Trefin has a degree of greed, but his reasons for framing the players 
lie deeper than financial reward. Players may (Formidable:Admin) manage to track 
his arrival to the same battered far trader which brought some of the thieves 
which can be identified to the planet. Interestingly, the far trader has never 
been registered as trading around Aubaine since then... 

A Chance of Freedom
The players should be trying to escape. If not, the second part of the encounter 
could be used (or use it anyway if you like it)

The cell you are held in looks as if it was intended more as a cupboard. There 
is a panel to control the door on the inside, but it has been deactivated from 
outside. An access panel below it covers the door circuitry, but it is welded 
loosely in place.
Opening the panel requires 4 points of damage to be done to it in a single 
attack. (Increase this if you find it amusing to get the players trying to 
shoulder barge it, flying kick it, etc.)
Average: Electronics- The door could be hot-wired if the panel was removed
Difficult: Electronics- To hot-wire the door (two attempts possible before the 
circuits burn out completely)

The Guard outside is \'Chip\' Dawkins, a junior and completely inexperienced guard 
(novice NPC, combat assets: Knowing which end of the gun the bullet comes out 
of.) Chip is very gullible, and Difficult:Act Bluff could get him to open the 
cell up ("please, my friend feels ill"). He can be easily subdued when the 
players are free, and they can escape.

If the players feel unwilling to take action into their own hands:
\'It\'s night time, the guard brought you a meal about an our ago. The food was 
good, probably straight from the staff mess, they can\'t have prisoners very 
often, otherwise they\'d be better at cooking badly. Suddenly there is a dull 
thud from outside. A moment of heavy silence follows and you begin to wonder if 
it was just your imagination, but the door to your cell opens with a swish. 
Outside is a schalli in a power suit, it greets the characters
"I\'m a friend, know you not steal ship. Was making night maintenance rounds, 
when I saw Trefin at computer, working on camera feeds. He ran when I saw, and 
now he\'s framed you. The only way to prove innocence is outside." Beside her is 
the unconscious guard. "Hurry, he wake soon." she urges.
The Schalli will return to her quarters after this, knowing she is more of a 
liability to the characters trying to escape stealthily.

If the players still don\'t try to escape (check their pulse and respiration):
Trefin appears while the Schalli stands outside. He shoots her through the back, 
and as she dies she tells the players to escape. Trefin will shoot himself 
through the forearm, drop his gun and call for backup.

Escape!
Moving through the shipyard:

Corridors - Carries the highest risk of encountering guards. Players will 
encounter D6 patrols of D3 guards each (use stats above). Difficult:Stealth to 
avoid a patrol (all characters roll, some may be caught, others can surprise the 
guards). The video cameras appear to be deactivated (Trefin is manning them, to 
help the players escape). Formidable:Act/Bluff to talk your way out of guard 
encounters.

Ventilation Shafts - These allow characters to avoid patrols. Most of them are 
50cm x 50 cm square, but this increases to 1.5m x 1.5m in places. Despite their 
advantages they have their own hazards:
D6
1-2	Faulty electrical wire hangs down into the duct.
	Average:Observation to spot (-1 difficulty level in the dark)
	Difficult:Ship\'s engineering to remove (2D6 damage to dominant arm on 
catastrophic failure, 5min)
	Average:Acrobatics to avoid (Unskilled OK, 2D6 damage on failure, but 
wire still passed)
3-4	Maintenance robot. Probably background colour unless it decides the 
characters are an obstruction to be cleared.
5	Shaft
	Easy:Observation to spot (+2 difficulty in the dark)
	Easy:Acrobatics to cross over (4m fall on fail. Could cause problems 
trying to get back up)
6	Shaft
	As above but with air conditioning fans which add D6 damage to falling 
damage on a fail.

Outside - Airlocks to the outside will allow the players to swim around to exits 
from the facility. This could also help them get on board a ship as they 
wouldn\'t need to pass through facility exits.
On entering an airlock:
D6
1	2 Guards waiting in ambush, Vac suits present
2	Vacc Suits are present for extended aquatic work
3-6	Scuba equipment is available.
Aquatic ACRs are present in all airlocks. 
There is a 50% chance of encountering a local predator outside, increasing to 
100% if a character with an injury is wearing scuba gear. Combat tasks are +2 
diff levels, Swimming enables to give only +1 diff mod. Characters without any 
swimming skill can be aided by others, but take no part in combat.

The players can ultimately exit from the facility through one of three major 
means, ask them where they are headed.
- Utility launches. 
\'Making your way cautiously down a corridor you stop in surprise as you see a 
launch outside the window. Around the corner, an armoured guard sits next to the 
airlock, a rifle propped between his knees, and a can of drink in one hand.\'
The Shipyards have several launches used for utility purposes, ferrying simple 
replacement components to orbit etc. A security guard is present on the airlock 
for each launch, armed with dart ammunition in their rifle, and wearing TL12 
combat armour. Although a single guard could be overcome easily, the launch is 
not fully prepped for takeoff, so the players might have trouble getting away 
that easily, though.
Difficult:Ships Engineer - Bring power plant up to full (not a cold start), 
takes 1D6+1 minutes. Critical success reduces time to 1 min, critical failure 
doubles time needed. Every minute roll D6-4 for the number of armoured guards 
appearing. 
Difficult:Electronics - Burn out door servo control, barricading the entrance 
from the guards.  Three guards together can open it manually - Wait until three 
guards have accumulated outside from the roll above.
Formidable:Act/Bluff - Convince guard that characters are maintenance crew for 
the launch.
Impossible:Forgery - Produce requisition order and passes to deceive the guard. 
This task is one level easier if the characters have access to a portable 
computer/printer or similar.
A pre-emptive attack would surprise the guard, but an implant monitors his 
health and will alert security even if the players knock him unconscious 
immediately.
Average:Interface/Grav to fly out safely through the plastic covering the 
hangar. If nobody has Interface/grav, then they will need to find another exit.


- The underwater docks
\'The docks are dark, lit by the lights below the water in a shifting pattern of 
blue and shadows across the walls and ceilings. The walls reach a hundred meters 
away into the darkness, and the room is about forty meters wide, and almost as 
high. About a dozen submarines are tied up in the channels which run along the 
sides of the room. There is a pair of unarmoured security guards with tranq 
rifles sitting in a control room set into the centre of the ceiling, with glass 
windows all around.\'
Sneaking past the guards is Easy:Stealth due to the lighting in the submarine 
docks.
Average:Electronics or Intrusion - open a submarine door.
Average:Act/Bluff - to persuade security to let the submarine exit through the 
\'airlock\' (waterlock?) which prevents the room from filling up with water, while 
keeping air pressure normal.

If they get suspicious of the bluffing above, characters will have to fight past 
1D6+2 guards (the original two, and reinforcements) to get to the control room 
above, and then Average:Computer is necessary to open the gates. If the 
characters try this straight away, then only the original two will need to be 
overcome.
Average:Small Watercraft to actually escape in the submarine, otherwise they\'ll 
need to find another exit.

- Passenger ships
\'The loading platforms for the surface ships are unbelievably crowded. People 
and aliens in clothes fashionable on any of the worlds of the Coalition mill 
around, waiting for, and getting off the ships which arrive every few minutes. 
Some security personnel stand by, but they aren\'t checking for you very 
carefully, as they are far too few in number for the task of overseeing so many 
people. It would be very easy to just slip into the crowd and get on board a 
ship.\'
Average:Computer - Forge bookings on a passenger ship leaving the shipyard 
(needs access to a terminal in an office, which risks an administrator coming in 
and finding the characters)
Average:Act/Bluff or Disguise or Stealth - Slip past security and board a 
passenger vessel. 

The players can leave their escape vessel in one of the downtown docks on 
Aubaine, where few questions are asked, and most people would consider it a 
breach of honour to talk to the police. The smell of the docks is overpowering, 
and the concrete piers are crumbling with disrepair. Small fish jump from the 
water to catch insects, and larger, long insects buzz around the water, catching 
the tiny fish. 
The people here dress functionally.  While some ships are hives of activity, 
with dockworkers scrambling over them to unload the cargo, others seem eerily

The _Spinward Marches Campaign_ contains maps showing the political
boundaries (but not settled/not settled areas) of the marches before
and after the first four frontier wars. Mertactor is plainly marked as
outside the Imperium in 589 and in the Imperium (isolated from the rest
of the Imperium, marked by a circle) in 604.

One of these days I may sit down and summarize all the information contained
in those maps and the map in the "History of the Spinward Marches" article.

There\'s a deep mystery about the Zhodani that has puzzled me for years,
and it has a direct bearing on this subject:

The Zhodani expanded out from Zhodane for a long time until they, roughly
-1000 stopped at their present size "in order to assimilate the various
non-zhodani societies". They\'ve been assimilating for over _2000 years_,
and they still haven\'t resumed expansion - in ANY direction. OK, there\'s 
been the Core expeditions, but surely that couldn\'t absorb the excess
wealth and energy of 10 sectors? So why haven\'t they resumed expansion?

I don\'t know just what is wrong, but I suspect that the Zhodani have 
massive internal troubles of some kind. Or perhaps they have a religious
or philosophical objection to expanding further. But whatever it is, they
haven\'t invaded the Regency, not because the Regency isn\'t a potential
threat, but because of whatever keeps them from resuming their expansion.

As another piece of the puzzle, they\'ve fought every frontier war with
much less forces than they could potentially muster. So few forces that
their defeat has been pretty much assured every time. Why? Because it
was part of a devious plan, as we\'ve been told, or because they _couldn\'t
spare those forces from elsewhere_?

     HRD is the primary brain trust of Deneb Sector.  For centuries, the 
     free-spending research facilities and progressively structured 
     corporate environment of the planet have attracted some of the 
     greatest minds of the Regency.  HRD\'s path to fame was a difficult 
     one, however.  The system has weathered centuries of controversy and 
     scandal, but has amazingly maintained a reputation as a premier 
     private research facility.
     
     HRD system, labeled 975-003 by the IISS during the Grand Survey, was 
     initially overlooked during the colonial wave that passed through 
     Deneb and Spinward Marches sectors.  Radiation emanating from the 
     system\'s smoldering giant star, YG-437, causes an extreme daily 
     temperature fluctuation that makes long-term habitation on the world 
     difficult to manage.  In 222, the Imperial Navy, having greater 
     environmental technology at their disposal than most colonial 
     ventures, established an industrial mining facility on the planet.  
     For decades, the navy exploited the planet\'s natural resources, 
     including substantial industrial-grade radioactives for exportation to 
     pre-stellar worlds.  Continued industrial efforts on 975-003 were 
     abandoned after the Starn Beltstrike of 259.
     
     In the wake of several controversial audits of Imperial Navy frontier 
     expenditures, Admiralty decided it was in their best interests to 
     convert rather than scrap the expensive facility on 975-003.  
     975-003\'s mining sites and factories were converted into R&D 
     facilities and the planet was renamed Laboratory in 274.  For over 
     three centuries the Laboratory facility was issued tens of thousands 
     of patents for innovative military technology.  The facility became a 
     nexus for top-notch military engineers.
     
     The Imperial Navy continued to funnel public funds into Laboratory 
     until the media again reared its ugly head.  Several well-placed 
     informants exposed the Imperial Navy Research Facility at Laboratory 
     for misuse of public funds in 622.  Fourteen research divisions on 
     Laboratory were found guilty of plagiarizing the published work of 
     several Imperial Research Stations.  It was discovered that decades 
     earlier, several of Laboratory\'s most clandestine facilities had been 
     mothballed immediately after construction, their advanced computer and 
     research equipment never even removed from the cargo modules.  The 
     confidentiality of the facilities protected them from scrutiny until a 
     daring journalist, Hallah Dariso, performed a reconnaissance of the 
     naval research center from a nearby mountain range.  What she saw was 
     a pristine facility with nary a sign of life on its campus.  Dariso 
     sold the story to the TNS and the rest is history.  In the worst 
     embarassment yet, it was rumored that the majority of funds allocated 
     to Laboratory were being used to line the pockets of several regional 
     nobles.  The "Laboratory Scandal" rocked the Imperial Navy to its 
     foundations and once again, they were forced to cut their political 
     losses, this time under order of the Iridium Throne.
     
     Several megacorporations announced their interest in purchasing the 
     facilities for private use in 626.  The controversial Humbolt family 
     of Vincennes established themselves as the executor of a deal that 
     would establish a permanent multi-corporation research facility on 
     Laboratory.  Discarding the "Laboratory" nom-du-plume, the planet 
     became the Humbolt Research Directorate (HRD).  The Humbolt family 
     aggressively recruited megacorporate participants in this 
     unprecedented project.  Eager to get their hands on the technology of 
     the little-used naval research facility, megacorporate liaison teams 
     flocked to HRD.
     
     HRD had become an overnight media giant.  Broadcasting agencies from 
     throughout the sector shone the spotlight on HRD.  The 
     megacorporations longed for the opportunity to thumb their noses at 
     the aloof Imperial Research Stations and looked at HRD as their chance 
     to do exactly that.  The Humbolts cashed in on the hysteria by 
     charging exhorbitant amounts for real estate lots and research 
     facility privileges.  The abashed megacorporations had no choice but 
     to relent to the greed of the Humbolts.  The media buildup of HRD had 
     become so pervasive in the public consciousness that any 
     megacorporation not involved in the project became a market pariah.  
     General Products became a victim of this unprecedented case of mass 
     hysteria when they announced their refusal of the Humbolts\' terms.  
     Regional General Products stock dropped eight points overnight.  
     Trading on GP stock was temporarily halted to avert a sectorwide 
     calamity.  The regional collapse of General Products sent a shockwave 
     through the local industrial sector.  Megacorporations grudgingly 
     accepted the Humbolts\' financial terms to avert similar disasters.
     
     In 628, the Humbolts became the focus of an Imperial inquisition 
     involving, among other things, the alleged large-scale abuse of the 
     native sophonts of Perez system. Humbolt industrial interests were 
     extracting a valuable hallucinogen from the sophonts using an 
     excruciatingly painful process.  The Humbolt family was expelled from 
     the region and stripped of the rights to Vincennes and HRD systems.  
     The megacorporations quickly snapped up HRD lots at auction.  Less 
     than two years after the HRD project was born, the Humbolts\' only 
     legacy was the planet\'s name.
     
     In the following century, the corporations and megacorporations that 
     established HRD research facilities began to see large returns on 
     their investments.  For many years, ideas developed at HRD were 
     transmuted into marketable products throughout the Regency.  By 700, 
     however, the well began to run dry.  If not for the return of the 
     Imperial Navy and the conversion of much of HRD\'s resources to 
     military contracting, the grand dream of the Humbolts may have died a 
     quick death.
     
     By the mid-700s, the Imperial Navy had reestablished a presence on HRD 
     at the planet\'s class-A orbital starport.  The navy brought in much 
     needed capital to the megacorporate research concerns onplanet.  Naval 
     contracts were liberally handed out to the think tanks and 
     technological research facilities.  By 800, the navy commanded over 90 
     percent of HRD\'s resources.  This arrangement remained the status quo 
     until the early 1100s.  In 1103, a consortium of neighboring system 
     governments contracted HRD\'s research facilities to create 
     cost-effective public works programs.  Included were programs 
     specifically designed to enhance environmental and transportation 
     technology.  At the present date, the HRD public works programs 
     command approximately 20 percent of corporate resources.
     
     In 968, the Imperial Navy built the HRD Technical Academy and the 
     Imperial Naval Academy at HRD, adjacent to the world\'s capital city, 
     Control.  A large contingent of the Imperial 258th Fleet was 
     dispatched to HRD for the opening ceremonies and to establish a 
     permanent high guard for the strategically important work being done 
     on the planet.  The Regency Navy continues to maintain both 
     educational facilities at the present date.  Though both schools are 
     highly reputable, they are in need of renovation and the navy is 
     currently drumming up public support for an Academy Refit Program.
     
     In stiff competition with the two HRD military schools is the civilian 
     HRD Polytechnic University, located at Innovation, the planet\'s 
     second-largest city.  Renowned for the technical expertise of its 
     faculty, HRDPU instructs students in the design of all forms of 
     technology, both military and civilian.  The recent addition of a 
     humanities department has broadened the spectrum of HRD\'s research 
     resources to political and social issues as well.  Students at HRDPU 
     look down their noses at the rigid spacers of the military academies.
     
     HRD is governed by the Megacorporate Research Council (MRC).  The MRC 
     consists of Corporate Councils recruited from the five most prolific 
     corporations on the planet.  Every 5 years, an independent audit is 
     performed to determine which corporations are most fit to run the MRC. 
     The formula that determines which corporations shall rule is a 
     complex one in which net income, research expenditures and patent 
     generation are factors.  Currently, the ruling corporations are Ling 
     Standard Products, GSbaG, Makhidkarun, SuSAG and Sternmental Horizons. 
     The fifth slot, run by Sternmental, was recently held by Instellarms 
     until the other four ruling megacorporations ousted the weapons 
     manufacturer as punishment for desecrating a portion of HRD\'s southern 
     hemisphere with an illegal meson weapon testing program.  Several such 
     ousters have occurred over the planet\'s history.  Most economists and 
     sociologists attribute this phenomenon to the extremely competitive 
     nature of HRD society.  Political adversity is commonplace on HRD.  
     The system\'s natives laud this feature of their governmental structure 
     for its cleansing effect.  Megacorporations involved in underhanded or 
     illegal projects or business are usually ferreted out and exposed by 
     their competitors.  HRD\'s highly skilled "information junkies" and 
     espionage agencies are constantly turning stones to expose corporate 
     dirty dealings.
     
     MRC councils are not always drawn exclusively from the 
     megacorporations.  In the planet\'s history, several sectorwide and 
     even a few subsectorwide corporations have held office for varying 
     terms.  Liiri-based arms manufacturer, Tactical Solutions et cie, is 
     perhaps the most notable sectorwide corporation to hold office on HRD 
     for an extended period of time.  The sheer economic might of the 
     megacorporations usually wins out, however, giving them hegemony over 
     HRD\'s government.
     
     The executive and legislative tool of the MRC is the Corporate 
     Committee.  Each of the five ruling megacorporations establishes a 
     seven-person Corporate Committee to vote and write laws for the MRC.  
     Committee membership is a full-time job and few committee members 
     perform any other function for their corporation other than civic 
     duties.  An independent agency, The Office of the Exchequer, oversees 
     the activities of the MRC and manages the use of public funds.  HRD is 
     remarkably free of violent crime, so law enforcement requirements are 
     minimal.  Regency Marines perform most law-enforcement duties.  The 
     Regency Navy performs judicial duties in cases of violent crime.  
     Corporate criminal cases and lawsuits are adjudicated in the Corporate 
     Court, an independent judicial agency comprised of professional judges 
     and attorneys.
     
     No other system in the Regency is better trained or equipped to 
     bombard, derail or dismember an opponent with information than HRD.  
     In fact, HRD has it down to a science.  In 998, Dr. Gerhard Terili 
     founded The Guaran Institute as a department of HRDPU.  Named for the 
     homeworld of the hivers, the most prolific manipulators in charted 
     space, the institute employs professors who teach the fine art of 
     using information and media as a weapon.  Several primer courses 
     feature discourses on hiver manipulative techniques as well.  The 
     Guaran Institute has come under fire recently for the inclusion in its 
     curriculum of a course titled "Genocide 101."  The course\'s syllabus 
     includes the written works of several historical advocates of genocide 
     and professes to its students the tenets of a successful genocidal 
     program.  The First Regent himself has expressed displeasure with "the 
     questionable ethics of teaching the Regency\'s youth the building 
     blocks of mass murder."
     
     The importance of HRD to the Regency is paramount.  Unprecedented 
     discoveries have been made on HRD in the areas of antimatter power 
     generation, manipulators (or tractor/repulsors, as they\'re sometimes 
     called), subspace communications, meson technology, materials 
     technology, matter teleportation, terraforming and black globe 
     studies.  A large portion of the cutting-edge technology in the 
     Regency was spawned at least in part in the laboratories of HRD.
     
     HRD fosters a unique open-door policy to all members and client states 
     of the Regency and maintains an aggressive naturalization program to 
     recruit scientific talent from the Daryen Confederation, the Vargr 
     Extents and more recently, the Zhodani Consulate.  Due to the large 
     number of military contracts held by HRD corporations, Regency 
     citizenship is required before employment can be offered.  Regency 
     Naval prejudice generally prevents non-Regency personnel from working 
     on the most crucial classified projects.
     
     A detailed background check is mandatory for employment on HRD.  
     Because of the ubiquitousness of corporate espionage, hiring decisions 
     are made very carefully.  A GSbaG spy manages to steal LSP\'s prototype 
     plan for a new jump drive.  An Instellarms agent steals and patents 
     Tactical Solutions\' latest fusion rifle design before it hits the 
     market.  These are nightmare scenarios for HRD corporations.  
     Corporate research facilities on HRD maintain the most stringent 
     security available in the Regency.  Though the world isn\'t 
     interdicted, most corporate facilities effectively are.  It isn\'t 
     unusual for a corporation to employ armed security to protect their 
     research facilities or mercenary units to guard top-secret prototypes 
     enroute to manufacturing centers elsewhere in the Regency.  DNA 
     scanners are standard equipment at all entrances of most corporate 
     facilities.
     
     The Jumpspace Institute, which maintains a research facility on HRD, 
     is actively working to break the Jump-6 Barrier.  While nearly all of 
     the Institute\'s findings are classified and secured by Regency Naval 
     Intelligence (RNI), it is known to the general public that HRD\'s 
     Jumpspace Institute is pro-Jump^2 (or Jump Squared).  Jump Squared 
     advocates believe that the most probable method of breaking the Jump-6 
     Barrier is to find a way to perform a jump while already in jump 
     space.  Chief opponents of the Jump Squared faction are the 
     Misjumpers.  Misjumpers believe that in order to break the Jump-6 
     Barrier, scientists must find a way to harness the chaotic effects of 
     misjumps.  One of the main proponents of the Misjumper faction are the 
     Jumpspace Institute scientists at Research Station Zeta on Pashus 
     (Zeng:  Deneb/1432).  Neither side has developed conclusive results, 
     but the debate rages on.
     
     After the closure of Regency borders to protect the Spinward States 
     from Virus, customs laws became extremely harsh on HRD.  No 
     unauthorized exportation of HRD technology is permitted.  The danger 
     of AI robotics or ships\' computers falling into the hands of Virus 
     invokes the image of Trin being bombarded and infested by suicider 
     Virus strains.  Importation is also highly regulated. The effects of a 
     Viral contamination of HRD computers would be devastating to the 
     planet\'s highly technological society.  As a result, imported parts 
     and components are meticulously inspected for Viral infection.
     
     Customs enforcement is an extremely difficult job on HRD.  Highly 
     trained naval and marine personnel are required to manage the flow of 
     technological equipment on and off planet.  HRD corporations are 
     frequently caught attempting to ship unauthorized prototypes offplanet 
     to their manufacturing centers elsewhere in the Regency.  Most 
     manufacturing corporations avert customs laws by designing their 
     technology on HRD and exporting the design via computer media.  
     Occasionally, however, corporations find the need to locally 
     manufacture a prototype for testing purposes and quickly export it to 
     their remote factories.  Corporations caught in the act usually claim 
     that time is of essence in the dog-eat-dog world of advanced 
     technology and that the rigid customs laws of HRD make it nigh 
     impossible to compete with offworld corporations, many of whom face 
     less stringent regulations.  Their cases are heard in court, but 
     corporations caught in the act of illegal exportation are usually 
     punished with stiff fines and imprisonment for personnel involved in 
     the attempted offworld smuggling.  HRD mastery of information flow 
     usually protects corporate executives from incarceration.
     
     The navy has reserved two squadrons of SDBs solely for the purpose of 
     enforcing exportation laws.  These SDB squadrons form the core of the 
     Mobile Unit SDBs for Customs Law Enforcement (MUSCLE).  MUSCLE SDBs 
     have proven extremely effective at limiting corporate attempts to 
     skirt exportation laws.  Just recently, an LSP blockade runner was 
     forcibly grounded on the farside of HRD by two of MUSCLE\'s SDBs.  A 
     shootout between mercenaries on the runner and the marine boarding 
     party followed.  Usually, smuggling attempts do not escalate to this 
     level, but open violence does occasionally occur.  Such events are 
     played up in the local news by naval publicity personnel, with the 
     intention of discouraging future smuggling attempts.  Such propaganda 
     usually falls upon deaf ears, however.

     HRD\'s two major cities, Control and Innovation, are surprisingly 
     lively cities.  Linked to one another by an extensive maglev rail 
     system, the two cities lie approximately 450 km from each other.  Both 
     cities feature domed starport and startown facilities aboveground and 
     expansive business and residential subterranean sections.  While most 
     expect that a planet dedicated to intellectual pursuits would be a 
     stuffy, sedated environment, just the opposite is true on HRD.
     
     Control, the location of the downside naval base, is more or less 
     bifurcated into the corporate sector and military sector.  The 
     corporate sector houses and employs individuals working exclusively 
     for corporate military contractors.  Social and entertainment 
     facilities in Control\'s corporate sector tend to be of the more 
     mundane variety.  Families typically enjoy a night out at one of the 
     city\'s plethora of restaurants, followed by a holofilm viewing or 
     gambling in the casino district.
     
     The military sector features a somewhat dilapidated housing section 
     and a score of bars and discos.  Among marines and naval enlisted men, 
     the Citadel tends to be the most popular watering hole.  This 
     expansive nightclub features a full slate of raunchy entertainment and 
     some of the strongest ale to be found in the trailing portion of the 
     Regency.  Brawls are not uncommon at the Citadel.  While the bouncers 
     at the bar are rather effective at quashing such affairs for the most 
     part, a fullscale bar fight nearly wrecked the joint recently when a 
     marine NCO insulted a naval SEALS (Sea-Air-Land-Space) special ops 
     officer.  At the other end of the spectrum is the staid HRD Naval 
     Officers\' Club, a posh bi-level establishment located in the surface 
     dome of Control.  Naval officers enjoy the refined environment of the 
     club and descend to "The Catacomb" for gambling and less reserved 
     entertainment.
     
     In sharp contrast with the somewhat blighted military residential and 
     commercial districts, the adjacent naval and marine training centers 
     and barracks are well-funded and equipped operations.  Currently 
     administered by Commodore Willa Velakusian, the dirtside naval base is 
     a meticulously maintained facility.  Also maintained at the dirtside 
     base are 18 batteries of meson dampers and 12 deep-site particle 
     accelerators to be used for offensive or defensive fire.  Because of 
     the concentrated population of HRD, the navy deemed it wise to provide 
     ample defense capabilities for the naval base and adjacent city.
     
     Other than marine law enforcement officers, one would be hard-pressed 
     to find naval or marine personnel just about anywhere in Innovation.  
     While many corporations that contract to the military also do business 
     in Innovation, those who live in the city tend to avoid personal 
     contact with the military.  Innovation is home to scores of sidewalk 
     cafes, in which all manner of discussion and debate occurs on any 
     subject from the validity of Moroyanga\'s research findings to the 
     advantages of the more pluralistic Regency over the old Imperium.  
     After enjoying a cup of Vincennezi Espresso, the conversation is 
     usually carried to one of hundreds of small bars, taverns or 
     nightclubs along the subterranean streets of the city.  For more 
     family-oriented entertainment, people generally cling to the numerous 
     malls and holotheatres on the periphery of the northeastern 
     residential districts.
     
     While 95 percent of HRD\'s population lives and works in Control or 
     Innovation, the remaining inhabitants occupy the planetary outback.  
     Devoid of atmosphere, HRD presents a harsh environment in which to 
     live remotely from other sentient life.  Corporate researchers at 
     HRD\'s polar ice caps, faultline research facilities, geological survey 
     divisions and low orbital zero-G pharmaceutical facilities generally 
     use imported Vincennezi communications technology to maintain contact 
     with their families in the cities.  The extreme daily temperature 
     fluctuation on HRD makes going outside a dangerous proposition.  
     Thickly padded and radiation-shielded vaccsuits are worn when it is 
     absolutely necessary to venture into the outdoors.
     
     HRD is an extremely important system to the Regency and therefore 
     requires special attention.  The Regency Navy maintains a considerable 
     portion of the 258th Fleet in the system, mostly in point defense of 
     the system mainworld itself.  HRD\'s unique history and governmental 
     structure have fostered a climate in which intellectual freedom can 
     flourish.  Though the world of HRD itself is essentially a hostile 
     airless rock, the society contained within is home to some of the 
     greatest minds of the age.  When Regency governments look for 
     innovation, critical evaluation or conventional wisdom, they look to 
     HRD.

Nice question.  I always wondered why the Imperium - who\'s fundamental 
goal was "to control the space between the stars" - never could get rid 
of all those pirates, even pre-Rebellion.

It may be because the Spinward Marches was such a wild frontier sector... 
but still, those are nukes on those civvie ships! (Even if the ship 
mounts just lasers, it\'s still capable of zapping a tank...)

[Ways to control starship nukes]
> a) licencing and extremely strict government control

The above seems unlikely to work in the free-willing Imperium, but has a 
better chance in the Regency.  The rest seems O.K. (but then again, I\'m 
seriously ignorant in this stuff...)

Well, not all those ships were originally there: a lot of Lucan\'s ships 
came from the massive fleets in Corridor Sector.  

The Core Sector fleets were, however, massively built up, for reasons 
I\'ll get to later...

OK. Now, the main reason why Core Sector\'s fleets were so huge was to 
defend the Emperor from "friendly" Imperial naval fleets from the border 
regions. Remember, there was a 20-year Civil War between 600 and 620, 
which featured massive fleets ripping in from the borderlands to sieze 
the Irridium Throne.  

(That war was started by a large fleet led by Plankwell coming in from 
the Marches (and assassinating the Emperess Josephine), and the war 
ended by another large fleet - Arabellatra\'s, this time - coming in from 
the Marches, and zapping the last Emperor of the Flag in a major naval 
action. NOTE: some feel that Arabellatra was actually the last Flag 
Emperor...)

[Ironic side note: and the Imperium - if it is to live again - will be 
build largely by yet ANOTHER massive number of fleet\'s, streaming in from 
the boonies....  Also, have you ever noticed how the Spinward Marches 
figured so largely in Imperial history?  The emperor\'s never even formed 
a Domain of Deneb till 1116 because they fear their rebellious tendency\'s...]

Now, remembering that the ruling won\'t-even-try-to-spell-it dynasty came 
to power by raw naval might, they are certain to keep a large amount of 
ships in their home territory, so some new power-hungry Admiral from 
the boonies will think twice before sending their fleet\'s Coreward.

If you look closely at Fleet locations, you\'d find that the major ships 
and bases are NOT largely set up close to the Imperial Borders, but 
largely spread out throughout the Imperium, with Corridor Sector and Core 
(And Solomani Rim? I don\'t have  the Rebellion Sourcebook with me...) 
having a good bit more than their fair share of naval power.
  
I suspect that the Corridor and Solomani fleet\'s are for external defense, 
the Core fleet is the "Practorian Guard", but the other fleet\'s are either 
A) composed of smaler vessels, for largely anti-pirate duties or B) big 
and bad, to intimidate the local Imperials into towing the party line - 
and put down the occasional subsector- or sector-wide rebellion. 
Because of how well-equipped even less-important part\'s of the Imperium 
was for the Rebellion, I strongly support reason "B".

Note that Margaret, Brks, and Dulinor (Dukes and Archdukes of low-threat 
zones of the Imperium) were quite capable of holding off the Core fleets, 
despite the fact that they had no military right to that level of 
weaponry, if you are expecting _external_ threats.

(Even Strephon\'s Fraction - who controlled a mindlesly domesticated part of 
the Imperium - was able to hold off Lucan until he attracted too much 
attention. This is the equivelant of New Zealand maintaining 3 divisions of 
heavy armour and 2 aircraft carrier fleets, "just in case".)

Virus is a short term threat?? The material presented largely depicts vampires 
as worn out old hulks, staggering from one star to another, but Promise has/had 
a starport and can/could maintain ships. Promise does appear ragged, and with 
the infighting and lack of rebuilding I doubt Promise could last 100 years by 
itself. But this is only the tip of the iceberg, the former Imperium was large 
enough that other examples must exist where virus society has evolved more 
successfully, where Virus is actively rebuilding, where virus recognises the 
usefulness of humans and co-operates with them. This doesn\'t have to be a 
peacemaker strain infested utopia though, as the Virus/human society could have 
an extremely agressive attitude. If any virus like this developed, then its 
starports would not only be able to maintain the Vampires, but also to build new 
ships. Far from dying out, Virus/Human cultures would have major benefits - 
-Massive integration of AI into culture, assisting humans by providing easier 
interfacing, and logical progression of research, while at the same time the 
virus benefits from the creativity of humans.
-Cheap computers. As a Virus can etch its own circuitry into silicon, making a 
mainframe becomes a matter of a Virus spending a hour or two producing it - 
Imagine a manufacturing plant where the output grow exponentially. Designs would 
be very easily produced by Virus. Starship computers would cost little more than 
the price of the silicon wafers they\'re printed on.
Virus does have a lot of surviveability. If the Regency blunders into old 
Imperial space and starts a genocidal battle against Virus, then much closer 
unity between Virus systems would develop. If Virus united against a specific 
enemy, instead of just all wandering around with their own agenda, if they got 
their act together on ship maintenance and building, then they would pose a 
major threat to the Regency.

  He knows that he wants the planet itself to be fairly Mars-like

Heaps... the energy of the impact would be related to the escape
velocity of the moon in question and the mass of the bolder ie:

E=(1/2)mv^2

or in terms of the moon

E=Kr(R^2)m

where
E=energy in Joules
K=4*10^14 (G=6.67*10^-11 times earts mass=5.98*10^24)
r=density in Earth densities
R=radius in earth radii (world size/8)
m=mass of iceberg in kg (.001 tonnes)

assumeing a size 2 moon (.25 earth radii) with a density of 1 and 
your 20 tonne ice cube you would get appox 5*10^18J (5*10^12MJ).

I don\'t know the converstion to mega tonnes but I think one foulup 
would ruin anyone\'s day.

As to your other questions, check GDW\'s World Tamers Handbook
(Guild? can\'t remember), it might say.

    I create a vehicle with an armor value of 1.  I slope the front and
it\'s armor value is now a 1.5.  Does it get rounded up to 2 or down to
1 for purposes of creating a vehicle profile?

Rules Question

    I was looking through the starship operations charts in both the
TNE rulebook and the Referee\'s Screen last night.  In the screen it
says that it\'s updated the 100 diameter travel times to be more in line
with FFS.  However, the values seem to be off by a value of 10!  So are
they, or is the travel time from a large gas giant at .1 burn-g which
used to be ~60 hours now ~700 hours?

Thanks in advance...

     Viewing the beautiful glowing orb of Porozlo from afar, who would 
     suspect that this Terran Normal world is the site of some of the most 
     vicious internecine warfare in the Regency?
     
     Porozlo\'s balkanization is the result of poor colonial planning.  Due 
     to its remarkable resemblance to Terra, Porozlo was a highly 
     sought-after system.  Colonization claims were filed by numerous 
     private and public interests, most of whom were of Solomani origin and 
     all of whom had legitimate claims.  Roughly three quarters of the 
     claims were made by colonists with corporate sponsors, the largest 
     made by Transstar, the Terran shipping megacorporation.  The remaining 
     25 percent were comprised of government-sponsored colonization 
     programs and population-relief projects.
     
     Because of the high demand for rights to the system and conflicting 
     legal claims, an impartial mediator was selected to resolve the 
     conflict.  The mediator determined that it was in the best interests 
     of all involved to distribute Porozlan land to as many of the 
     claimants as possible on a first-come, first-served basis.  Strict 
     head-count limits were imposed.  Not surprisingly, a solution that was 
     intended to make everyone happy made no one happy.  
     
     The majority of the lots were distributed among an astrographically 
     isolated Solomani group in Daibei Sector.  These Solomani were 
     primarily descended from colonists who had originally come from 
     Terra\'s Eastern and Southern European and North African regions during 
     The Rule of Man.  A large portion of the lots were distributed among 
     ethnically diverse Solomani groups from throughout the rimward portion 
     of the Imperium and the remaining lots (about 5 percent in all) were 
     given to a handful of Vilani interests and Core-based colonists of 
     mixed descent.
     
     The Imperium\'s attempt at generosity resulted in the system\'s 
     perpetual state of conflict.  After establishing footholds on the 
     planet in 161-163, many colonial settlements quickly adopted 
     isolationism as their credo and began to form their own individual 
     governments on the planet.
     
     After permits were distributed to the second wave of colonists from 
     Daibei and nearby Diaspora sectors, the colonial administration 
     encouraged an even distribution of ethnic populations among the 
     nations of Porozlo to foster a more homogeneous political environment. 
     Unfortunately, hundreds of micro-immigrations nullified the 
     Imperium\'s efforts in the subsequent decade.
     
     Remarkably, the only ethnic group that did not geographically polarize 
     itself was the Vilani.  Vilani minorities can be found in most of 
     Porozlo\'s nations.  They are frequently the educated elite, holding 
     jobs as physicians, attorneys, bankers and corporate executives.  Not 
     preoccupied by the ethnic conflict of the planet\'s other settlers, the 
     Vilani have formed their own functional niche in Porozlan society.  
     Conscious of their minority status (and the historical peril of those 
     who have held such status), the Vilani settlers have been careful not 
     to isolate themselves, so as not to incur the wrath of another 
     Porozlan ethnic group or nationality.  In fact, the dispersed Vilani 
     minority are arguably the greatest philanthropists on the planet, 
     contributing a disproportionate 22 percent of the planet\'s charitable 
     donations in an average year, while they comprise only eight percent 
     of Porozlo\'s current population.  The Vilani minority speaks Galanglic 
     in the business community but continues to speak a Vilani dialect in 
     the home and at cultural functions in order to preserve their 
     heritage. 
     
     Porozlo\'s resources were scattered enough that over the centuries, 
     further political fragmentation occurred along economic lines.  The 
     final result was a world with upward of 80 independent nations.  
     Porozlo became a textbook case on how to create a balkanized world.  
     Though Porozlo\'s population was as diverse as any in the Imperium, for 
     the most part the world avoided major wars until a dramatic event in 
     its history.
     
     The Porozlan fragmentation and a growing awareness of the planet\'s 
     limited resources gave birth to a grassroots political movement, which 
     eventually became known as the Private Ownership (PO) bloc.  The PO 
     bloc came into being during a firestorm of debate about foreign 
     investment and exploitation of Porozlo\'s resources.  The status quo 
     had been more or less pro-free trade.
     
     For two decades after the birth of the PO bloc, the majority of 
     Porozlan nations underwent revolutions of one sort or another.  It was 
     during this extremely xenophobic period that the planet became 
     registered by the Travellers\' Aid Society as an amber zone to warn 
     travellers of the danger posed by distrustful Porozlans.
     
     After 20 years of PO revolution, the pendulum began to swing the other 
     way.  Those who supported foreign investment and development united 
     under the banner of the Free Trade (FT) bloc in reaction to radical PO 
     movements.  This political schism was to become the defining event in 
     Porozlo\'s history.  Historians debate the original date of the 
     Porozlan Schism, but most place the date on either 1016, when the 
     first domestically governed megacorporate labor union (thought to be 
     the precursor of the PO bloc) formed in the nation of Stepozhevac, or 
     on 1084 when the FT bloc came into being.
     
     PO movements spread like wildfire, affecting each and every national 
     government on Porozlo.  As the PO/FT division deepened, democratic 
     governments\' elected officials became almost exclusively drawn from 
     either the PO or FT bloc.  Many of the planet\'s more dictatorial 
     governments resisted at first, but as public sentiment grew, even 
     nations led by autocratic dictators began to align themselves under 
     one banner or the other.
     
     The conflict has raged on for over a century now, with the balance of 
     power frequently shifting between the two parties.  During the last 80 
     years, the balance has settled, with the PO dominating about 30 
     percent of the planet\'s countries and just under half its population.  
     The FT bloc dominates the more technologically developed and 
     industrialized nations.  Several underdeveloped countries have fled to 
     the FT wing in recent years.  Under the guidance of Chairman Augwynne 
     Sorsi, the nation of Nemso has sponsored a ground-breaking new 
     organization, called the Free-Trade Advisory Council (FTAC), to help 
     these nations "get on their feet."  Using programs like the FTAC, the 
     Free Trade bloc has successfully swayed public sentiment to their side 
     in the interstellar region.
     
     Wars are frequent on the soil of Porozlo, with an average of six going 
     on at any one time.  The perpetual state of conflict on Porozlo 
     spurred the TAS to deny the Porozlo United Council\'s request for amber 
     zone nullification in late 1148. 
     
     While most Porozlan wars are of the brushfire variety, many escalate 
     to full-scale conflict with occasional threats of biological and 
     nuclear weapon use made by opposing countries.  The presence of 
     neutral Rhylanor curbs the use of such weapons, however.  The 
     Rhylanori senate\'s unequivocal position is non-intervention unless the 
     war escalates to the point where such weapons are used.  One Rhylanori 
     senator, who requested anonymity, brashly stated, "If the Porozlans 
     start nuking each other in our backyard, we\'re going to bring the sky 
     down on their heads."
     
     The frequency of international conflict on Porozlo has made the planet 
     a nexus for mercenary activity.  "Warworld" is the name many regional 
     mercenary units use for the besieged planet.  Because of its adverse 
     political environment, Porozlo has acquired the distinction of being a 
     "mercenary magnet" over the past three centuries.
     
     While several offworld peace initiatives and summits have been 
     sponsored by neighbors Rhylanor and Zivije, most of them have ended 
     with the representative Porozlan national delegates walking away from 
     the table in frustration.  The divisiveness between the nations of 
     Porozlo has thus far proven irresolvable.
     
     Despite the pervasiveness of warfare on Porozlo, the planet as a whole 
     is rather economically successful.  Nemso, the richest and most 
     dominant nation on Porozlo, has the population and resources of many 
     entire systems in the subsector.  The Free Trade party has dominated 
     the nation\'s parliament since the 1107 overthrow of King Syzygy, the 
     former hereditary monarch.  Many other nations, most notably Morovic, 
     New Dalmatia, Zenerabi, M\'Dwailei and Hauvania, have also prospered 
     under the auspices of the Free Trade party.
     
     Although the FT nations have been models of economic success, the 
     downside of foreign industrial exploitation is also evident in their 
     cities.  Visible signs of blight and homelessness are much more 
     prevalent in FT cities than they are in the more socially democratic 
     PO cities and countries.
     
     The main PO nations of Porozlo, including Almarac (the most populous 
     nation on Porozlo with six billion inhabitants), Anisinta, Turin, 
     Digliotti and Vyben, tend to be more militant.  Local militias, 
     created for the purpose of defending their homesteads from "invading 
     offworlders," are common in PO nations.  While PO nations are not 
     nearly as prosperous as the FT nations, it can accurately be said that 
     for the most part, their citizens live on a more economically 
     egalitarian scale.  The majority of their citizens could be classified 
     as lower middle class.
     
     Porozlo is home to a multitude of fascinating cultures and traditions. 
     The artistic community flourishes in most nations on Porozlo.  
     Political and cultural strife on a planet often fosters an active 
     artistic community and Porozlo is no exception to this rule.  Porozlan 
     poets, painters and sculptors are revered for the level of emotion 
     that their works elicit and for the quality of their craftsmanship.
     
     Porozlo remains a glorious example of a Terran Normal world.  The 
     breathable air, lush landscape, majestic mountain ranges and rich blue 
     oceans make Porozlo a top tourist attraction for travellers who are 
     smart enough to look beyond the political instability of the planet.  
     Tourists tend to choose the more politically stable countries for 
     their visits, far away from the raging fields of war.
     
     All but one of Porozlo\'s A-quality starports are located in 
     FT-controlled nations, with the most traffic at Nemso Down Starport.  
     Nemso maintains the planet\'s sole orbital facility as well, Nemso 
     Orbital.  Among PO nations, only Almarac maintains an A-level starport 
     facility at great expense to the populace.  In order to uphold the 
     virtues of the PO bloc, Almarac spares no expense to make its primary 
     port a jewel among common stones.  Though the facility is arguably the 
     most modern of all Porozlo\'s starport facilities, traffic at Almarac 
     Starport is somewhat sparse.
     
     Free traders should be warned that legal cargo in one Porozlan nation 
     is contraband in another.  Be wary of the trade laws in each nation 
     you intend to visit.  More than one trader has had his ship impounded 
     for carrying goods from an FT nation into a PO nation and vice versa.
     
     Industry is alive and well on Porozlo.  Boisterous international 
     competition for interstellar markets has fostered a progressive 
     planetary culture.  In just the last 20 years, Porozlo has advanced 
     from TL-10 to 11 in the Regency technological profile system.

     Good point.  It\'s really tough working with systems that have so much 
     history behind them.  That\'s part of the reason I\'ve opted to do more 
     RICE papers on systems in Deneb Sector.  Less has been published on 
     them.  The fact that my own campaign happens in Deneb and not the 
     Marches is another major factor, though.
     
     I would recommend one of two things:
     
     1)  Discard my statement about the Fourth Frontier War.
     
     or
     
     2)  Hedge it by saying that Mertactor accepted only rudimentary 
     membership privileges.  Perhaps they denied the Imperium\'s request to 
     place a scout base there because of certain resentments.  From 605 to 
     1084, Mertactor might\'ve been somewhat like Puerto Rico is to the 
     United States.  A possession, but the citizenry has no voting rights.

    'body' => 'This idea has a lot of merit, but I would definately drop FF&S\' mass driver
rules, they are FULL of holes.  Have you looked at the short range on your
80 cm Ice cannon?

Suggestions from the peanut gallery (I designed something like this for a
shadowrun game).

First of all, will it ONLY shoot rocks or will vehicles ever be involved?  I
ask this because: 1. you can vary the accelleration, and 2. you would
probably have to increase the diameter for manned flights to accomodate the
lasrgets diameter ship you want to launch.

For manned flights, anything higher than 3Gs uncompensated for any
apprecaible period of time would not be pleasent at all.  For rocks
(iceballs) 10Gs might work better.  Then simply figure out the length of the
accelerator and some math will get you the velocity.  If you want 3Gs for 5
minutes you get a velocity of 10m/s * 300s = 3km/s.  Now I don\'t think this
would be enough for escape velocity, but the vehicle could mount
ramjets/rockets.

Getting an accellerator that is that lenght is a major problem.  I am trying
to remember the formula for figuring out the lenght, I will post it when I
remeber it.  But I seem to remember many KM for the length.  The problem
there is keeping it straight and level.

As for power usage, I have no Idea. but it would be immense (however, since
you are on a planet, it shouldn\'t be a prob.

The size I used was eliptical 40M wide and 8M tall for 350 KM running from
Gibralter to Malta (underwater).  Lastly you would want to use recoverable
launch vehicles as they would get rather expensive.  Anyway hope this helps.

3.      FIGHTERS AS MISSILE SCREENS

Re digest 405:
Merrick, you may be interested to know that the idea of using fighters
as missile screens has been around for HG since 1982. There was a
game limitation imposed on the number of fighters that could group together
to shield against a battery, but it could be done:

"To effectively cover the ship being protected, one squadron must be
assigned against each attacking ship\'s missile fire. If desired,
additional squadrons could double-up against the fire from one attacking
ship.
The fighter\'s weapons are used to defend against the incoming batteries
of fire as though they were mounted on the vessel being defended, with
the followng exception.
No more than half of the weapons in the squadrons assigned to
attack a single ship\'s incoming missile fire may attack any one battery
of fire. Thus if a ship firing 3 x factor-9 missile attacks was opposed
by 20 ships with one fusion gun each, the player controlling the fighters
could assign up to 10 guns against a given battery of fire. Of course, the
total number of guns fired cannot exceed 20.
Missile batteries may be used, but sandcasters may not be.
The fighter\'s computer is used to compute relative computer level to find
penetration DM\'s."

4.      THE CONSULATE AND THE REGENCY

Re digest 406:
Alvin, I think that if handled right, the "Baddies from the Core" option
could be quite effective in shifting Zho focus away from the Regency, at
least long enough to give the Regency a bit of breathing space in which to
expand and rebuild. According to TD #4, many Zho fleets were destroyed, and
many of their psionic nobles went insane. If this option is used by GDW,
it could leave a hole in Zho society that they would need time to fill.

Other Points For:
1. The Zhos would still want the Regency as a barrier between the
Virus and themselves. Why didn\'t the US march on Baghdad and remove Saddam?
Because of the power vacuum that would have resulted. Someone "really" nasty
like Syria could have marched in and taken Iraq\'s oil once the West had
withdrawn.
(DISCLAIMER: please note that I realise that this was only one in a number
of political reasons that stopped them taking out Saddam. I\'ve included it
just to illustrate my point about the Zhos).
2. The Regency has TL 16 and experimental TL 17. The Zhos have TL 14 and
experimental TL 15. The Darrians (Regency allies) have the Star Trigger.
This should help to equal out the balance of power.

PS. Why do you say that "old Japan was dominated by China"? Japan was the first
(only?) Eastern nation to even begin to operate as a colonial power, when it
fought and captured sections of China early this century. (Pressure from the
West forced the Japanese to "accept the unacceptable" and relinquish its hold
on certain areas, however - the Western nations wanted to be the only colonial
powers, thank you!). I would have said that _China_ was dominated by Japan.

PPS. Re Ben\'s comment in digest 424:
>finally, the Zho\'s DIDN\'T invade. That\'s a \'fact\'. Why is for Regency era 
>academics to discuss...

This is an example of what I call the difference between "character
explanations" and "player explanations". For example, TSR published Second
Edition AD&D, which included changes to many spells (including magic missile,
*groan*). The "player explanation" is that the changes were made for play
balance. The "character explanation" involved the "Time of the Troubles" which
caused "fundamental changes in the underlying laws of magic, space, and
time" - or whatever gobbldygook (or technobabble) you want to come up with.

The "player explanation" of the Zho-Regency peace between 1130 and 1201 is
due to GDW\'s decision to re-start the clock after 70 years of "hold". I would
guess that their desire is that rules changes will be easier to implement with
new character and situations (which is why retro-fitting CT with FF&S is so
difficult; eg. civilian nukes).

The "character explanation" is up to GDW and individual DM\'s - as always, if
the players ask you a hard question, you have to come up with something.
(BTW, I have found that this list, in itself, helps in this regard. Many
people - other than me as a sole DM - are also working on filling in the gaps.
Their work becomes an invaluable resource.

5.      ZHO GAINS IN THE FRONTIER WARS

Jerry, sorry, but the Zhos managed to gain ground on the Imperium in almost
every single Frontier War. The Imperium had actually expanded into part
of Gvurrdon Sector (Llanic Subsector) and into Ziafrplians Sector
(core-spinward of the Marches) prior to the 1st Frontier War, and were
pushed out by the Zhos, back into Cronor. In the 2nd, they were pushed out
of at least three worlds in Jewell. Between the 2nd and 3rd, the Zhos
expanded into Querion subsector. By the end of the 3rd, the only Imperial
world in Cronor was Narval, and the Zhos had further expanded into Jewell
and Querion. Narval was lost in the 4th, becoming a Zho client-state.
The Imperium was able to gain Quar/Cronor in the 5th, but this was their
only gain.

     What sort of effect would it have on an earth-sized planet\'s

     over 40 degrees C.
     
     From my layman\'s chemistry, I have determined that a fair amount of

     large scale.  From what I\'ve read, there\'d have to be a great deal of 
     electrical activity (e.g., lightning storms) for the ammonia to exist.

I\'ve waited until I thought most list members have got their Challenge 77s to
respond to Dave Nilsen\'s editorial contained therin.

He defended the absence of Sector and Subsector data, and the lack of Vessel
designs. In the case of the former, he stated that DGP\'s Alien guides led to
campaigns shifting all over Charted Space, for little or no good reason, and
that GDW were telling a story, impling that they didn\'t want people to wander
from it. For the latter he said that without the artwork, the starships are 
the same anyhow.

I\'d like to take him up on those two points. On the first point - we don\'t 
even have enough information to realistically explore around the RC. To 
Trailward and Rimward, we have no information on space sometimes one 
parsec from the RC\'s border. Is this realistic? There is an RC colony on
Poyzen, a bootstrap team on So Skire - we are given no astrographic data on
the subsector - unrealistic. The RC has no information on the Human pocket
empires to trailward, along the RC - Hive Federation supply route, again -
unrealistic. 
So GDW is telling a story - fine, I like the story they\'re writing, but 
don\'t constrain us too much. At the moment the RC is surrounded by no entry
signs save the arrow pointing to Diaspora - open it up for us.

On to the lack of starships and vehicles in H+I. I like starships, I like
the stats, but most of all I like to see what they look like. Then, if 
I\'m playing or GM\'ing I can see in my mind\'s eye what that ship looks like.
One more level of reality brought to the game, and when you are playing or
refereeing it has to feel real. I want to encounter a Hiver Battle Cruiser
escorting in a trade convoy, come across a Hiver Survey Ship exploring the
wilds and I want them to feel real.

To conclude, keep up the storytelling, but don\'t starve us of information
to the extent that we can\'t play in the New Era and feel cheated by the lack
of info on our surrounds.

(1) The Gazelle Class Close Escort. Problem - Can\'t refuel at Gas Giants with
its tanks attached, as its CG covers it without them, and it is streamlined,
not airframe. Does it dump tanks, refuel, rendezvous with the tanks, fill them,
refuel, connect to the tanks and scoot. Sounds complicated even if no one\'s
gunning for you. How about running the CG at 133.34%, risky, wouldn\'t want to
be in the CG\'s atmosphere if the CG overheated and broke. In It\'s original
role as a close escort to large naval ships, this is less of a problem, as 
it can refuel off the large ships. Still, limiting even in the CT era

(2) The Lab Ship. Must explore strange, new worlds but can\'t land. Can only
refuel at A, B, or C starports, asteroids, or by launch (how many trips?!).
Doesn\'t make sense even in CT era (should have kept the pinnace). 

(3) Yacht . Can\'t land, has CG anyway, must refuel at asteroids or A, B, or
C starports. Ok in CT, bummer in TNE.

Of course, there are ship I have no problem with - the Patrol Cruiser, the 
Fiery Close Escort - beautiful ships, if a bit tight in space for personel.
Still, infect one of the computers with the friendly virus from Vampire
Fleets, its TL 16 control multiplier should free up some crew space.
I wonder what one would do to the crew requirement of a RC Clipper?

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As far as I\'m concerned this editorial seems consistent with what I
see as GDW\'s new \'line\', ie; "Something is only important if *we*
think it\'s inportant & if we don\'t think it\'s important then we
won\'t waste any time with it". This is an \'interesting\' way to run
a business, IMO.

For centuries China culturally dominated Japan, in that Chinese
culture was the model on which the Japanese elite based their
behavior. Examples: the writing system, "elite" literature styles and
art styles in general, the Confucian social structure (but with
warriors replacing scholars as the supreme class), and Buddhism. 

I believe this was brought up to support a claim that the Consulate
would culturally dominate the Regency in similar ways, i.e., the
Consulate "way of doing things" would be considered the chief model to
emulate among the elite of the Regency.

Three weeks ago, I asked whether anybody here on this list would be
interested in a SF PBEM roleplaying game with a background similar to the
classic traveller universe. In the meantime, I decided to start this game
and hope you allow me to post this here a second time.

I\'ll play in my own universe, mainly on the world Jovoo were the characters
have to establish a new colony. Jovoo is located in the so called
border-(sub)sector (the former Tibu Riwek subsector) which was closed for
100 years because of a peace treaty between the Imperium and the Estadh of
Bezidhar. One hundered years ago the empire, that lasts for 986 years now,
nearly was defeated by the overwelming space forces of Bezidhar. But then
the Bezidhar retreated, offering peace. The Imperium accepted and a belt of
no-man\'s land was created, the Border Sector. 

Jovoo was setteled by the Imperials 301 during the Great Expanse. The new
settlers discovered that they weren\'t the first humans on Jovoo. Primitive
humans lived between the ruins of a strange city which "was built by the
gods." 836, Jovoo was attacked by Bezidhar. Three years later they destroyed
the colony and probably killed all settlers that didn\'t ran away after the
first attack. Imperial fleets reconquer Jovoo in the same year 839 but found
no survivors. 848 the Estadh destroyed the outpost on Jovoo again, advancing
further so that the Imperium gave up the world.

Now the Imperium wants to re-colonize the world. Empress Athia instructed
the duke Selrean of Riwek to organize the new settlement. He gave the order
to the new founded department for development of the Salmann Neue
Technologie AG mega corporation. The department is now looking for
management personal for the following divisions:
        - Command (coordination of settlement)
        - Scout (survey and exploration)
        - Security (assure the safety of the colony)
        - Production (farming and animal breeding)
        - Health (medical team)

They are also looking for voluntary settlers (for example citizen mayor,
science person). Payment depends on qualification, minimum will be ICr
4000/month. Settlers get a single bonus of ICr 1000 and aditioal Cr 4000 for
buying Saltec products (SCr).

If YOU are interested, I would be glad to get your reply. Although, there
might be a drawback for most of you, because I will refee most of the game
in (my native) German language. However, it\'s perfectly okay if you use
English to send your turns/descriptions and use this language to
communicate. I would love to have an international flair in this game :-)
You only have to be able to understand (basic) German. Unfortunately it\'s
too time consuming for me to support both languages and currently I\'ve more
German speaking than English speaking players. (And you probably have
already noticed that my English isn\'t perfect) If there\'s a volunteer to do
the translation I would love to hear of.

If you think it\'s worth a try, please feel free to send me a short note.

I think, I\'m more a Traveller collector than a Traveller gamer, simply
because its more difficult to gather a group of SF fans then a group of
fantasy players. However, I always liked most of Traveller since I bought my
first rules book 10 years ago.

Original Traveller background was too large, Dave Nilsen said. Players got
lost in known space because every new book moved them into a new part of the
universe and made them to startover a new campaign, Dave was afraid. Peace
was boring, made characters to become criminals to have some rest of fun, he
told us. So GDW destroyed to peace, declared the Rebellion and the Final
War, to achieve that the same player actions are no longer crimial ones. Fine.

Original Traveller was a framework, Dave noticed. But GDW doesn\'t want to
provide a framework but tries to tell a great story, a storyline with a
thick red threat on that they want to tie all players. Well.

I always liked that framework idea. A framework contains concepts and basic
ideas, not ready-to-play stories. It gives you a broad range of
possibilities not just one adventure. Like in computer science technology
were a framework has more power than a single application (though it\'s more
difficult to use) only a wide framework is capable of supporting such a
large background as the Imperium was.  Now all players have to play inside
the RC if they want to profit from new publications. The spinward marches I
always understand as example for a generic frontier region.

This kind of "direction to only the right way" can also be found inside the
game, I think. The RC government with its two parties looks for me like the
US government and it has a similar understanding of democracy. A natural
decission for a game written by US citizen, perhaps. The RC looks more like
a dictatorship than the old Imperium. The RC takes the liberties to dictate
all other worlds its own political model, take by the right of the stronger
all technologies they needed and see all other planets ruled by TED (very
bad guys) to justify their own actions. I felt the Imperium more tolerant.

Dave wanted to show the world that it can be done. "Never say never" goes
the saying he wants to prove. And the virus-story proved it. Using this as
occasion GDW changed Traveller as they feel it would be needed. It\'s our
background and we do it on our own, someone of GDW said once on this mailing
list, if I remember correctly. Players are allowed to follow the story. But
they are not to allowed to really take part in the story, or actively change
it. Of course they don\'t have to follow but then, they will be on their own.

If the players know to much, I wouldn\'t be fun, Dave Nilsen pretents. But
knowing background or knowing the reasons behind the background are two
things. Any Cthulhu players probably knows that Great Cthuluh exists and
were it sleeps its unholy undead sleep. And every Cthulhu player known the
common races like deep ones or fungi from yoggoth. But only the referee
known their motives and actions in the current adventure. If a rules book
stats that Zhodani are the bad guys I think its clear that this of course
isn\'t the universal truth but only the seeing of the one who provided this
information (the Imperials). 

But if the referee doesn\'t know more than the players, he had to make good
guesses or use his imagination (once the true idea behind role playing, but
currently very dangerous if he wants to use the next source book, too :-))
which probably kicks him out of the story. So the referee will wait until he
knows the right direction and start only now. But wait, if players now read
these books, they again know too much. Moral: Best give no information at all.

Finally Dave told us (with many words) that history is full of bad jokes and
so are the books of GDW. Well. I would like a book with good jokes better.

    'body' => 'Re: Eamon Waters\' Response to Dave\'s Challenge 77 Editorial

First of all let me state that I like the "new" format of GDW\'s line.  One
of the things that my players always wanted was the ability to REALLY effect
what was going on in the universe.  Now most of GDW\'s prior stuff was set
against the backdrop of the 11,000 world Imperium.  It was only later with
Arrival Vengance that the players were finally set up to be some of the
movers and shakers in the Imperium.  Now in the RC, in every adventure the
PCs change the universe.  My players esp like that format better.  The one
problem I have with it is that the RC is so young that most of the players I
play with have characters that are too old.  They also tend to be of rather
high rank which would make them commanders most of the time.

Now GDW intends for the players to be loyal RC Marines or some such, but
this is not always the way it works.  I have players who refuse to be in the
Military because they don\'t want to have to follow orders if they don\'t want to.

I appreciate the amount of detail given us for the worlds around the RC in
_Path of Tears_.  There are LOTS of adventure possibilities there,
unfortunately it is a static book.  Once the players investigate a planet,
the others are still in their fallow state waiting for the PCs to come and
do the initial recon.  

I do miss the ships and equipment.  I disagree with Dave in that all 5mm
Rifles are the same.  Witness the M-16, G-41, IW, AK-74, Etc.  Its one of
the things that made 2300AD such a great game (each person was able to pick
a different weapon).  It is a little plain to say that a person has a 5mm
ACR from Aubaine, and it operates the same as a 5mm from Oriflamme.  In fact
why would there be a RC standardization committee that creates the 7mm
modular weapon.  Look at the problems that NATO has standardizing its
weapons.  First it was the 7.62Nato, then the US develops the M-16, and
strongarms the rest in to adopting the new 5.56Nato cartridge.  Then the
Germans come along and develop a new 4.77mm caseless round that no-one else
wants...or look at the plethora of 9mm pistols on the market today, and
almost anyone can tell you why A is better than C.

Contrary to FF&S, put the same cartridge in two different weapons, with many
of the same stats, and it WILL fire differently.  Also almost every weapon
you come across has slightly varying weights, etc.  Now do they all perform
the same...sort of.  I can tell you that a Glock 17 9mm will last you longer
than almost any other on the market, and that one you can get for $99 will
probably jam on you the first time you REALLY need it.

So do we need weaponry, vehicles, ships, etc.  YES!!!! we do.  It gives us a
look see at what the race thinks like etc.  I mean I understand the Ithkulur
much better after seeing their weapons in RC Equipment Guide.

Anyway, what we need is a clearing house of designs for weapons, vehicles,
etc.  GMs could post them, and others could use them in their campaigns thus
giving their players more of a choice between just a Wheeled ATV and a
tracked ATV.  I mean when we go out to buy a car, do we just get a generic
car...No, and Traveller would be no different.

Again, cool. A good reason to put fighters on Capital ships...
Although I would imagine they also have special point defence gunboats
built for precisely this purpose, as well as to protect against fighters.

just the fact that the fleets in question were a few hundred parsecs away in the Coreward direction would effectively remove them from the Frontier wars.

True. Where can I find out more about the star trigger?

You are missing an important point - the Gazelle isn\'t landing. It can use 
maneuver drives to maintain a high velocty while skimming the atmosphere. That
of course assumes that the drop tanks are streamlined. Ok, so you could overload your CG, but why bother? Just dip into the atmosphere repeatedly at a low
entry angle, skip out again, and on the next orbit dip back in. all the while 
you can use your 5G maneuver drive to maintain a high velocity. As it says in 
FF&S, "all streamlined ships can hurtle through the atmosphere at high velocity"

True enough.

And now for a question of my own, that I\'ve asked once before but might 
have been lost in the message screw-up last week.

Are there any black holes or neutron stars in Charted space? Have they 
been detailed, and if so, where can I read about them?

also, are there published sector data for Foreven sector and The Beyond?

Final question regarding meson weapons; I know they are part of traveller 
canon, but to be honest, I have yet to be convinced that they are allowable
with our knowledge of physics.. The mesons used are neutral, so they don\'t 
shed energy the way say, alpha particles or electrons do, but that doesn\'t
mean they will go through anything without resistence. neutrons are not 
charged, but the get absorbed readily in many materials, including water.
It\'s - as far as I know- due to the strong nuclear force, which in effect 
allows the nucleus to interact with the particles. The same woudl be true 
for mesons. 
Only neutrinos can go through most matter without interacting. 
 
have I missed something, or do I have to resort to "It\'s physics we haven\'t
discovered yet" when my players ask?

Hi, 

In my post in Trav Digest 424, I pointed out that the Peacemaker Virus could
make a significant difference to the ship complements in TNE starships. This
is because engineering, electronics and maintainance crew requirements are all
reduced by the computer multiplier number. This of course means trusting a
Peacemaker Virus - which in my calculations I did, being a trusting sort. So
trusting, I let them replace the MFD crewperson too. I found that the 
differences are most noticable on larger, low TL ships, as you would expect,
getting the highest drop in computer multiplier number. Also effected on
large ships are the number of command crew, whaen the other crew requirements 
have been whittled down. The breakdown of crew changes for starships in the
TNE rulebook and RCEG, where there is a change, follow:

Gazelle:	Loses 3 eng, 1 MFD, 1 command crew; complement 22 > 17.
		So, the ship doesn\'t need hot bunking, or can use the 
		space to put in a CG for 400tons, so it can refuel at
		Gas Giants and land on planets without jettisoning tanks.  

Patrol Cru.:	Loses 1 eng, 2 MFD, 1 command; complement 19 > 15.
		Less hot bunking.

SDB:		Loses 6 eng, 2 MFD, 1 maint, 1 command; complement 23 > 13.
		Either most crew get a stateroom to themselves, or you get
		more missle space. 

Fat Trader:	Loses 1 eng; complement 9 > 8. An extra passenger room. 

Donosev:	Loses 1 eng, 1 elect; complement 15 > 13. More supplies, or
		lab space.

Sub. Liner:	Loses 2 eng; complement 12 > 10. More passengers.

Broadsword:	Loses 2 eng, 2 MFD, 1 command; complement 72 > 67. Add more
		troops, but then you need the command crewperson lost.

Manta Fueler:	Loses 5 eng, 1 maint; complement 12 > 6. This crew loss 
		subtracts from the complement of the Clipppers carrying
		them.

Aurora Clipper:	Loses 15 eng, 3 MFD, 1 elect, 5 maint, 6 flight, 3 command;
		compliment 85 > 52. More troops, supplies - or drop some
		small modules, better performance.

Maggart Clip.:	Loses 21 eng, 3 MFD, 1 elect, 8 maint, 6 flight, 5 command;
		compliment 112 > 68. More troops, supplies, or you can drop
		an entire 100ton quarters module - maybe replace it with
		a missile module.

Victrix Cla.:	Loses 6 eng, 1 elect, 2 MFD, 1 maint, 1 command; compliment
		26 > 15. Add more fuel, you could pack about 154kl into the
    		space of the 5.5 small staterooms freed - 6 extra G-hours,
		and the Vixtrix sloops needs all they can get.

Cobra Courier:	Loses 2 eng; compliment 12 > 10. Much more comfy.
(Challenge 75)

Lauritson Cla.:	Loses 3 eng; 2 MFD, 1 elect, 1 command; compliment 22 > 15.
(Challenge 76)  No hot bunking, or add a 400ton CG, as suggested for the
		Broadsword class above, of which this is a variant of.


Of course, you can store extra supplies in any vacated stateroom, or extra fuel,
or put in some ELB\'s. I\'d draw the line at greater conversion of staterooms,
as if the Peacemaker Virus turns on you, you\'ll want to convert them back...
if you get home.

Affect on the future of the RC? More ships for less men, ships with a bit
more of an edge than they used to have.

Another point - what effect would having a Peacemaker in charge of a TL 12 
factory\'s computer have - will the goods be of higher precision? Finer make?
Will it be able to make a TL 13 or 14 product? Or assemble the tools to do so?
Put it in charge of a research project - will the TL leap become easier?
Perhaps Aubaine is going to increase it\'s TL sooner than we think.

Sorry about that. My computer had an outbreak of virus... 

anyway, I am critical of GDW\' idea. They seem to be saying that they can make a 
storyline everyone has to folow - or they lose the benefits of sourcebook mataterial.
It would seem to me better to create a framework that can accomodate many
different campaigns without trouble. Space is HUGE. Any interstellar civilization
that is the least cohesive will be such a large organization that it is highly
unlikely for any one indivdual to change it very much. That was what was so 
great about the Imperium. It kept players in their place... and if the wanted 
to be the movers and shakers, well, they could always play a campaign in which
they were high ranked military or nobles, megacorp bigwig, or what have you..
THe RC is very limiting. 
But that\'s what GDW wants, and the make the game, so it\'s their call. 
I will merely try to take advantage of the material in the sourcebooks.
which is why vehicles, worlds, equipment, and to a small extent weaponry is 
very much desired. 
Although I must say that I am seeing an undue fixation with weaponry lately.
sure, it\'s cool that you can make your own ACR, or that by know you can find 
about 20 different types of plasma gun on the Net, but come on, there is more
to the game than guns.

in FF&S there is 77 pages on making weaponry, half a page on computers, and
not a word on biological modifications. true, there is a whole chapter on 
cybernetic modifications - but it\'s all hand lasers, fist knives, subdermal 
armor, etc. If I wanted to play cyberpunk, I would play Cyberpunk. 
THe best sourcebook I\'ve ever seen was "World Builders handbook" by DGP.
General enough to be useful to everyone (even if you weren\'t a scout. Or 
nowadays an RC marine). lots of equipment, a good (not entirely out of 
touch with science) system for making worlds. 

well, not much point complaining too much - the books made now represent a lot 
of work, and are even sometimes halfway good. I just wish GDW wouldn\'t
try to force their idea of how the universe should be on me. 

And give the guns a break.

Night.  

The first, a snip from "The Emperor and the Nightingale" is actually 
from Hans Christian Anderson: try to get Windam Hill\'s CD, narrated by 
Glenn Close, music (moody New Age, w/ Chinese influences) by Mark Isham.  
IMHO, it\'s a great CD, charming, good music, and a great tale.  The 
attitudes displayed on the CD by some of the people would be great 
training for the Imperial Court.  (Ms. Close also has a very nice British 
Accent, unlike some people here...   :)

The second is a summary of "The Fisherman and His Wife", by the brothers 
Grimm.  Narriated by Jodie Foster.  Music by Van Dyke Parks, CD is also from 
Windham Hill.  It\'s O.K., but not as good as the "Nightingale".

OFFICALLY, of course, the "Nightingale" is actually from an ancient Vilani 
folk tale: after all, the Vilani have an Imperial Tradition even 
older than the Chinese.  The "Fisherman" is a more recent Sylean tale, 
originating from Core Subsector at about -250.

****************************************

"The Emperor and the Nightingale" - a snippet (Get the CD!  Read the Book!)

"... Five more years went by, when suddenly the Emperor fell ill.  The 
whole country *grieved*, for the people were devoted to their Emperor, but 
the doctors said that he hadn\'t long to live.

   A new Emperor had already been chosen, and the people stood outside in 
the street, asking the chamberlain  if there was any hope of their old 
Emperor getting well again.  "Peh", said the chamberlain, and shook his head.

   Thick felt was laid down in the halls and corridors to muffle the 
sound of footsteps.  The palace was as quiet as a tomb.  The Emperor lay 
in his huge magificent bed, so cold, and so pale, that the courtiers 
thought him already dead, and dashed off to play court to the new 
Emperor.  Tle lackeys ran outside to gossip about it, and the 
chambermaids gave a large tea party.

   But the Emperor wasn\'t dead.

   He lay there, stiff and pale, in his magificient bed, with the long 
velvet hangings and the heavy gold tasles.  The poor Emperor could hardly 
breathe: he felt something heavy weighing on his chest.  He opened his 
eyes...

  ... and saw that it was Death.  *Death* was wearing the Emperor\'s 
golden crown, and held the gold Sword of State in one hand and the 
Imperial Banner in the other.  There was silence, and the silence grew 
more and more terrifying.  Death stared down at the Emperor with great, 
hollow eyes.


****************************************

"The Fisherman and His Wife"  -  a cautionary tale about the unlimited 
                                 drive for power.  Didn\'t anyone teach Lucan 
                                 and Dulinor about old Sylean nursery rhymes?

<happy, cherry music>

There was a fisherman and his wife who lived together in a hovel by the sea. 

And one day the fisherman fished, and fished, and fished, and caught a 
big flounder.  And the flounder cried "Please let me go.  I\'m not a real 
flounder, but an enchanted prince: and I woulnd,t taste right to you anyway."

"Well," said the fisherman, "you don\'t need to go on about it: I\'d 
certainly let any flounder talk swim free."  And saying this, he let the 
flounder go, and returned to his wife who remained in the hovel.

"Husband," she said, "didn\'t you catch anything today?" "No," replyed the 
husband, "I caught a big flounder who said he was a prince, so I let him 
swim free again."  "Didn\'t you wish for anything" questioned the wife. 
"No: what would I wish for?"

"Ack" said the wife "it\'s awful living in a hovel that\'s so disgusting 
and loathesome: you could at least have asked for a cottage.  Go back and 
ask for a cottage."

"Oh, why should I go back there for?" groaned the husband. "Because you 
had him for sure, and you let him go.  He\'s sure to repay you in gratitude."

So the fisherman went back to the sea.  An dthe sea was no longer 
gleaming, cryatal blue, but now was an ugly grey.  And the fisherman called 
out, and asked for a cottage.

"Go," said the flounder, "she has it already."

And when the poor fisherman went home, his wife was sitting in a beautiful 
little cottage, full with brassware, fruits and vegetables, and a small 
adorable flock of chickens.

"Now, isn\'t this much better than before?" probed the wife.  "Yes", said 
the fisherman, "And let it always remain this way, and we shall live 
happily."

"I\'ll think about _that_" she replied.

* * *

Two week\'s later, the shrewish wife called to her husband "Listen,
husband, this cottage is too cramped, and the yard too small.  The 
flounder could have just as easily given us a castle.  Go to the flounder 
immediately, so we can have a castle!"

The husband demurred, but the wife browbeat him to go to the flounder.  

"It\'s not right" said the husband, "it\'s just not right!".  And the sea 
was restless, and has turned an ugly green and yellow.  And the husband 
asked for a cottage for his wife.

"Go," said the flounder, "she\'d standing in the gate."

And the husband returned to a magificant stone castle.  With a beautiful 
slate steps, and elegant painting on the walls, it astounded the 
simple fisherman.  Complete with stables, fine horses, and an elegant 
garden in the back...

"Now, isn\'t this a fine home?" declared the wife.  "Yes", said 
the fisherman, "And let it always remain this way, and we shall live 
happily."

"I\'ll think about _that_" she replied.

* * *

And the very next day the wife desired to be king, then emperor.  The 
husband, incredulous, didn\'t believe that his wife would be granted these 
things, and was frighened of trying the flounder\'s patience.  But each 
time, the flounder granted her wish.

* * *

And the wife, after obtaining every possible position of power, still 
wasn\'t satisfied.  She thought and thought, but couldn\'t think of a 
single thing.  Until she looked out of her mile-high tower, and saw the 
sun rise and shine, it\'s bright sunshine illuminating her world.

"That it!" she cried, with a blazing gleam in her eyes, "I want to be 
able to cause the Sun and the Moons to rise!"

She turned to her husband. "Husband! I want to be able to cause the Sun 
to rise! I want to be like the Lord God!"

The fisherman recoiled from her.  "Surely you can\'t be God!  It can\'t be 
done!  It just can\'t be done!"  But his wife grabbed him: "I will have 
it! I am the *Emperess*, and you are just a fisherman! The flounder gave 
me all this, surely he can make me God as well!  If you don\'t go to him 
this very instant..." and her eyes fixed on him, boring into his skull... 

And the poor fisherman ran from her, towards the raging sea.  The sky was 
now pitch black with angry red clouds streaking across it.  The wind howled, 
and the stink of the onyx black sea hit him like a wall.  Trembling 
with fear and forboding, cowering under the vicious thunderstrikes, he 
cried out to the flounder, to make his wife like the Lord God.

"Go," said the flounder, "she sits in her hovel."

... and there she sits, to this very day.

ARRIVAL

When you leave jump, you\'re 100 diameter\'s from the primary star: Efate is 
only 68 local stellar diameters out, so your ship will come out between 
194 and 394 light-second from Efate.

Coming through the RQS rigamore is a good bit easier here then in most 
places: Virus is not nearly the threat that the Zho\'s can be, in the
eyes of the local Efate.  So long as the traveller doesn\'t do anything 
blatently stupid, he should be able to arive at the starport in a 
reasonably short time.

[REFEREE: The world name is also used to refer to singluar and plural Efate.]

Looking down on the world as the RQS quickly rifles thru his ship, he\'s 
likely to mistake the Vistoner plate as the world\'s sole continent.  
While it sure looks like one, it has actually been shattered into 
something like a jigsaw puzzle. Each island - about 300 to 700 km in 
diameter - is seperated by it\'s neighbour by a 1-4 km moat, which goes 
down 3-5 kilometers in depth.  How this highly unlikely geographic formation 
is still under some debate: since there\'s no impact crater, the answer 
must reside in some truly odd plate tectonics.  The world itself seems
geologically dead: there are no mountain chains, and no volcanoes.  The 
bottom of the moats is covered by silt and dirt settling in from above: 
estimates are that the crevaces go down another 2 km below the silt floor.

After barely setting foot on this world, each member of the company will 
be given a holographic Efate guide - an avatar - to help the visitor 
navigate his way through the customs and traditions that govern Efate 
society.  The guide will refuse payment from the visitors: he is usually 
a construct by a local tourist agency, and will encourage the visitors 
to use his agency\'s facilities.

THE EFATE RACE

The guide is worth a twice-over.  The typical lithe Efate stands at a little 
over average height, with a deep bronze skin, longish wavy hair in a 
variety of light colours (white, various shades of grey, and pale 
yellow), and high cheekbones.  They look like a minor race - or a 
bodysculptured noble - but are not actually human at all.  

The Efate was contacted by the Imperium soon after arriving in Regina 
subsector.  At the time, they were a highly sedentary race of omnivores; 
weighing in at about 300 kg, they looked something like large, 
occasionally biped squirrels, with faceted eyes, an ungainly gait, and a 
grating language of squeals and whines.  Primitive they were not, though: 
when the I.S.S. Coilirela touched down here in 182, they had already 
reached TL 4, with some research to TL 6.

The Efate - or the KriiLeeiKariit, as they called themselves at the time 
- welcomed the Imperium gladly, becoming a client state in 211 and 
obtaining formal membership in 243.  A highly industrious people, they 
swiftly reached TL A by 400, and by the First Civil War was at TL D. 

It was at this time when wealthy KriiLeeiKariit started to shape 
themselves and their children as humans.  The prestige of being human, 
and the natural KriiLeeiKariit love and fondness of humaniti, began to 
approach it\'s ultimate conclusion.  By 880, the "New People" were over 
half the population: by 1000, the KriiLeeiKariit were extinct.  But the 
"New People" - now taking the name of Efate as the name of their new race 
- were still not considered human, as they cannot interbreed, and have 
serious internal difference from humanity, especially at the DNA and 
molecular level.  

They still cannot eat most human food without pills and addatives: the very 
limited range of (highly processed) human food they _can_ digest 
without aides gives them debilitating stomach cramps and occasional 
vomiting "on bad days".  Because of their wholesale and self-inflicted 
genetic problems, they suffer appallingly short lifespans of about 40 
years, dying from a vast variety of heridatory diseases.  And over 60% 
of all Efate are originally born from some artifical method: the 
rebuilding of the KriiLeiiKariit reproductive system to imitate human 
mammalian norms is a great triumph of science, but even today a Efate 
woman going through natural childbirth takes her life in her hands.  Of 
course, Efate genetic science plows ahead to relieve these problems.

EFATE CITIES

Efate cities are very crowded.  The Efate are an extremely gregarious 
race, and they love the hustle and bustle of the urban enviroment.  Their 
cities aren\'t very tall, but do spread out over thousands of kilometers of 
area.  Clothing tends to imitate the latest Regina fashion, and many of 
the social attitudes are also familiar to native-born Reginans.  
Strangers are enjoyed my most Efate: they are easily forgiven of any minor 
errors, and even if guilty of a grevious crime, will only suffer 
- at worst - expulsion from Efate.

What most stand\'s out on Efate is the vast number of holographic people - 
called "avatars" - which mix and talk with the real Efate.  Some of these 
people have been sent by their masters to complete some errand, but most 
of the avatars are of dead Efate, who\'s personality is brought to live by 
AI programs.  

[REFEREE: Pre-Virus, the images are projected by small, mobile robot spheres 
which hover over a spot, and project the image downward.  Now, the 
cameras and AI computer is mounted on trained TrWanak gasbag animals: the AI
has no way to communicate to other computers, and can only direct the 
gasbag by mechanical prodding.  Also, the AI is designed to mechanically 
fail if infected by Virus.]

The Servenai Cults - the premiere Marchman religion, after Imperial 
Catholicism - have many Efate followers, and insists that the souls of 
the dead are only satisified if they\'re images are permitted to walk the 
land.  The Cults - which originated on Capon/2324 (B747748-A) - resemble 
the Roman mystery cults, with ancient Vilani philosophy thrown in: 
currently, 20% of all Marchmen follow it.

HONOUR

While most Imperial/Regency worlds are known for taking Honour and 
Tradition seriously, Efate is unique in the extent that it reveres these 
concepts.  One of the things that the Efate can\'t get their heads around 
is human laws: they simply cannot comprehend how they act.  What they 
*do* understand, however, is Personal Honour.  Each individual Efate is 
responsible to make his portion of the universe as fine and noble as 
possible.  And each Efate\'s life is governed by his own personal Honour 
Code, which is held as sacred.  

Each Efate is expected to uphold the Code individually, rather than 
depend on a government to maintain it.  If an evil occurs, the Efate that 
witnesses it is to correct it: he *cannot* pass on that responsibility to 
someone else. 

The Efate nobility\'s main purpose is to provide living examples of what 
honour mean, to set an example for the nation and the race.  The local 
nobility has shifted over the centuries from a priesthood to a democracy 
to an oligarchy of noble families, but how they govern - the source of 
their authority - remains the same. 

The Code - basically the obligation to be and live the truth as best as 
ability allows - is the foundation of trust on Efate.  Because it\'s taken 
so seriously, the system can continue to be the only known high-pop world 
without any formal laws at all.  Of course, every Efate\'s individual Code 
varies, but all strive towards the same goal, and tend to have many 
similiarities.

One of the more common manifestations of the Code is Paterfamilias: that 
is, the eldest male is assummed to be the lord of his household.  While he 
doesn\'t officaly have the \'right\' to kill anyone in his household that he 
wishes - the Efate only believes in duties and responsibilities, not 
rights - most Efate will not interfere or ostrazise a father who does, 
even in public.

Other common traits of the Honour Code is a willingness to take the law 
in your own hands; a very strong fear of shame before others; love of 
family, home, and empire; and contempt for those who challange the Code. 

RELIGION

While the Servani Cults are the most flamboyant religion on Efate, the 
dominant religion remains Imperial Catholicism.  The Deneb Rite remains 
the most influential with over half the population\'s alligence, but Sylean, 
American, and Vilani Rites are also common.  

The population is quite pious, and place strong emphasis on the 
graciousness of the Lord.  Assorted religious meetings - from major 
religious festivals to spontanious \'street dancing\' - is quite common.
While Efate does not have the most awe-inspiring cathederals or the most 
learned and wise of churchmen, they do embrace their faith with vigour 
and joy.  Which is somewhat ironic: about 2/3rds of Regency Christians 
believe that nonhumans shouldn\'t be allowed to join the church, either 
because they lack the "imageo dei" (the Image of God), or because they 
feel that Christianity is about God speaking to men, and that God would use 
other native religions to speak to nonhumans, not Christianity.

The tendency of Efate Catholics to stress the power of the Holy Spirit - 
and to utterly ignore the commandents and laws of God - tends to 
aggrivate most Catholic churchmen.  Never mind the problem of whether 
Jesus died for nonhuman sinners or not, or even if this theology even 
makes sense when applied to aliens. Or even if Efate are \'sinners\' in any 
meaningful sense: how can they transgress a law that they never recieved?

    'body' => 'I must admint, reading this list, and the xboat list, that I have always
been somewaht doubtful about the playability of a New Era campaign, and the
lack of Traveller GM\'s in the area sort of assured that I would never really
be disuaded, until by Fortuitous circumstance, I met my current TNE GM, whom
I will just call Jeff (since his last name starts Kaz and ends ski with a
few gargles in between).

The game started with everyone creating characters.  Home-system:  Earth.
Time: mid-21st century.  Yup, not anywhere near the new-Era.  Cool setup,
we are the crew of a Bussard RAM jet, bound for a 200 year journy to the
nearest stars.  Currently, there is a thriving lunar and mars colonies, the
Jupiter (Ganymede?) moon colony will be settled during our launch, and the
asteroids are home to miners, who barter thier weath back to terra.  We are
all quite qualified for our respective jobs, and cross-trained in several
others.

The launch began, we go into cold sleep (scariest description of it I\'ve ever
heard, descibed as feeling yourself die as the machines prepare you for cold
storage, *shiver*).  Anyway, we are awakened several times as we go out-system
for PR as we pass by each colony, accelerating as we go.  By the time we reach
Pluto, our velocity makes signal recpetion difficult.  we go to sleep expecting
to reach our first destination...

...we awake, but are terribly sick, several crew mwmbers do not survive.  We
are all suffering from varying degrees of minor brain damage, (everyone has
early stages of Parkinson\'s symptoms).  This is wrong, others have been asleep
longer.  When we give the ship a quick once over, we find three of the onboard
computers have crashed (no biggee, we have five more, and start to see what we
can do to maybe scavange one from the dead three, when we discover that two
of the eight reactors are leaking, and one is just ... gone.  Then we find
out that the system we have decelerated into is FV class, which isn\'t possible.
There are no F5 class planets anywhere near earth!  A check of the computer
clocks show 4000 years have passed.  We are seriously off course...

We are one week from orbital insertion when we detect a signal from the planet,
but it appears to be EXTERMELY dense and compressed.  We cobble together some
circuits to stretch the signal out and start to analyze it.  Hmm, the computers
just crashed.  *DAMN*  Looks like some hacker managed to leave a virus in the
system... I\'ll just shut it down and reboot...

...we find the source of the signal, an apparent orbital facility.  Aliens! We
aren\'t alone!  Proof!  Not just a signal!  An artifact.  The planet, however,
seems to be near earth normal (at least we could be comfortable near sea level
(kinda thin and light).  As we draw closer, we see more and more evidense of
orbital bombardment.  Looks like a war was fought here.  We are solemn as we
continue to approach...

... things are fine for the next 6 days, until suddenly, our belter announces
something is fighting him for control of the telescopes,  With his
announcement, the ship starts accelerating at 2G, and the course shifts from
orbital insertion to collision with the orbital facility.  Panicked, we try and
wrest control from the computers, but we can\'t.  We decide to use the landing
shuttles to abandon ship and land on the planet, as the facility is doomed
(the ship is quite large).  Somoe of us make it, and we detatch from the
ship (luckily for us, the shuttle has been powered down and the computers off-
line, eh?).  As we watch, the ship accellerates toward the facility which
opens fire with some sort of energy weapons which sends the tumbling wreckage
of our ship into a meteroic journy into the northern hemispher.  We decide to
de-orbit on the far side of the planet from the faciliy...

...ever tried to land a shuttle on a plain?  Due to phenominal pilot skill and
an incredibal hot streak with dice the shuttle is down.  In pieces, with the
landing gear a considerable distance to the rear, the nose buried in the final
moments of the crash, err, landing.  Re-entry tiles litter the landsacpe, with
bits of wing and under-structure, but no lives are lost.

Sick tired and lost, we leave the ship and begin to try and figure out how a
misift bunch of scientist, a belter, a medic, a nurse and a space-force
commander are going to survive on a bombed out world, when in a scene from 
mad max, a native (human appearing) rids up on a moped (towing a cart with
all of the looks of a peddler) and hands us a critter and mimes cooking it...

...which sends us into hysterical arguments involving parallel evolution,
alternitve star-drives, ancient astronauts and such.  Eventually things calm
down and we get on with it.

Well, enough of that.  Some background on the group:  Only the GM and I have
any background in Traveller.  One player has never played any RPG before.  It\'s
been a blast so far!  The adventure went on, and I know what\'s coming up, but
the GM keeps it interesting by throughin obsicles in our way (we are travelling
with a band bound for heaven, if that\'s a clue :-).  We can all now speak at
least some of the local language (Food?  Alchohol?  Repair?  Trade?)

This is pretty cool (and despite what people think, standard TNE combat is
lethal enough, thank-you!  There\'s this certain sewer critter which practically
ate me in a single combat turn) anmd a lot of fun, due in part to the GM, the
crowd, and the richness of the background (as long as you can ignore the bad
science in parts :-).

Felt the need to share that with you all (it\'s late, I\'m tired, and it seems
a lot of people are just complaining instead of playing...)

Later

After reading a message about a possible sucsesfull virus empire I thought

For use in my game I created a race of people that were once Human.
They, before the collaps, engaged in Secret Psionic, Bio & Cybernetic
engineering to very high level. This was done on a planetery scale and a
deeply rooted part of there culture. Then the virus came. But instead of
desroying them it forged them into somthing far stronger and resileant. I
call them the Hedran. Thay are not a player race more a NPC race that can be
evil or good depending on where and when you see them. There motives are
hard to guess, becouse they are not human any more. they are somthing more.

> Far from dying out, Virus/Human cultures would have major benefits - 

Thay had reached the point of Bio engineering Computers as Implants and
making everone telepathic. There cybernetic Implants where also moveing
towards Biological Equivalents. Then the Virus changed Everything becouse
the virus provided somthing thay were looking for but could not produce. A
group Mind.
The virus could not invade the Computer implants becouse thay where to Alien
to Invade Quickly enougth. So the Hedran Helped it, You could say thay
invaded it.

There tech Level verys from TL 17 to TL 9, the High end is in Psionics, Bio
Engineering and Material Technology. Beond this there TL falls off to rughly 
R.C. Standards. SO..

Now Its Soldiers and Scouts are reching out into the dark Looking to see
what is left of the empire. On face value they seem Human and Can pass as
such in most sercumstances. so for now it is content to spy and study EVERONE.

PS.. As a test I through a Single Soldier at my Pc\'s, I gave them a Platoon
of Marines in combat armour, armed with hevy weapons. The hedran hade Gauss
and Laser Implants with computer assisted Aimming and TL 16 Dermal Plating.
Thay just Managed to Kill him after taking 85% Casulties. Had thay got it in
the open I think they could have Killed it quickly. But in a building It
almost had to much of an advantage. With Str 20, Con 18, Agl 18, Int 16, Edu
16 Chr 12
and Psi 16 it Fires first, almost never misses and can take a lott of damage.
But then again I dont intend to have them run into it very much. Just make
them nervice about strange places and unexplored space.

In my campain, you could say thay are the Boogyman.
 But my Pc\'s Call then Charlie\'s. 
Grimscale the Unsmiling One. :-(

As I recall from the description, the lab ship is not intended for 
exploratory missions (that being the duty of the survey ships like 
_Donosev_), but for anything else requiring labs.  This doesn\'t 
necessarily mean the ship will be terribly far from support facilities.  
By analogy, Jacques Cousteau\'s vessels are not equipped, as far as I 
know, to be self sufficient to any great extent.  They are, however, 
research vessels somewhat akin to a lab ship.

I think this is the case.  I can\'t really justify them either, if for no 
other reason than that the "known lifetime" of the mesons is only a 
statistical average of sorts; the decay times will vary around this to 
quite an extent.  This means that the penetration cannot be really 
controlled that precisely.

That\'s why it\'s science _fiction_.

How is this done?  I don\'t recall seeing a way for MFD crew to be 
eliminated.  By the way, what are the effects of being undercrewed (as 
the "Star Shark" design at one FTP site is)?  I can\'t find any rules for 
this in TNE/BL.

This is true, however, we see a lack of all types of technology.  The RC
tends towards a military setting, yet they only provide 1 example of each
type of weapon.  What about Plasma GRenade Lauchers or under-barrel lasers.
GDW has taken FF&S and all they have done is redesign all of the old weapons
and vehicles.  (And not always very well)  Look at the Intrepid Grav Tank.
It has the same armor value as pen in the frontal arc.  This means that it
cannot kill itself except through minor penetrations.  In our times, and
always in the history of tank warfare, a MBT has the ability to kill a tank
with similar protection out to a good range.  In this case, Armor weight
should be sacrificed to carry a larger Plasma Gun, and under the new rules,
who says that Plasma Weapons are the best.  Just because thay were under
Striker doen\'t mean that thay are now.  The same variation need to be seen
in EVERY aspect of RC technology.  How about Air/Rafts (gee they all
displace 4 tons, they all seat 4 and carry 4000 Kg of cargo.  What about a
cargo only variant, or a closed top, or a bus, or one that is slightly
larger or smaller.  How about the sporty two seater with the hot new Imaging
Radar and Autopilot for NOE driving.  This is also the area that Traveller
has always been lacking.

This is too true.  GDW\'s cyberpunk was never the best, and for such an

This book is good, but it too has drawbacks.  The biggest is that is is
almost impossible to produce a habitable world.  Temperature extremes
usually make it either too hot or too cold.  It does provide an appreciation
of the Earth.  I have tried using it, and I do, but it is hard to spend even
that much more time generating a world for your players who will then spend
only a week in-system then never return.  It goes back to the Imperial
Survey/Tarsus debate Dave alluded to.  Do you spend the time generating gobs
of background data for a world and then never let your players leave?  And
then what do you do when you have decided that System X is actaully a moon
of a Gas Giant locked in a tidal orbit (a la 2300AD) with all of these cool
evironmental details and city sizes, etc.  Then GDW puts out a product that
totaly blows it out of the water?  I have had this happen numerous times,
and I HATE IT!  You are face with either reconciling your world, or dumping it.

There was a comment about the reality of meson guns and I thought I\'d
put in my 2 credits as well as maybe ask a few more questions.

The comments regarding the smeared nature of the beam are certainly
correct.  A pi0 meson decays in something like 10E-17 seconds as I
recall, but they will decay around this point since this is just the
probable time of decay. Does anyone have the decay for Pi0s handy?  I
think it\'s gamma + gamma due to pair production... the gammas will be
beamed preferentially in the direction of motion of the beam.

So we have a sloppy beam, but I still am not sure about the interaction
question raised... it\'s a good one.  What\'s the pi0 cross section of
Bonded SuperDense?  Maybe MGs would be more like PAWs with a penetration
rating (although maybe a high one).  If that were the case it might be
high enough not to matter too much for space combat, but deep site MGs
might have problems.

I\'d say from a gaming standpoint (and from a canon point of view) that
you could give MGs a really good penetration (like 1/DV) or something)... 
in space combat nothing will change since screens would be easier than
the required armor, but it\'ll explain to the PCs why the MG can\'t get them 
through that gas giant.

if he\'s never actually GM\'ed a system without his insider
information about it.  I know that\'s not true, but it does exhibit a certain
lack of contact with us out here.

	If you want to tell a grand story, write a novel (or two or three).
 
	Treating GM\'s and players alike, and keeping information from them
is counterproductive at best, and highly alienating at worst.

	GDW seems torn between offering a generic SF gaming system and a 
highly structured \'we own the Traveller Universe\' system where you 
have to stay in the confines of the gaming they allow you to do.

	What I see again and again, in this group, is a plea for more 
background...if GDW is going to have this grand story to their 
universe, then you HAVE to tell the GM\'s at least the outline of it.  

	Otherwise we\'re forced to do what we\'ve always done: make it up as we 
go along...if GDW comes out and says \'XYZ happens\', it may or may not 
happen within the confines of MY campaign. Jeez, you\'d a thought 
they\'d learned, from the howls of anguish from Classic Trav devotees 
when they wrought Virus, and destroyed the Imperium, overnight.

	The great thing about Traveller is that there is (was) so much background 
stuff out there, enabling a GM to develop a campaign in about any way 
they want.  Clamping down on that, and starving GM\'s of necessary 
information "to preserve a sense of mystery" is starving a GM of 
exactly what he/she needs: solid information to base the reponse to 
players on.  The whole point isn\'t to keep GM\'s guessing, after all, 
it\'s to provide the players with a solid, believable place to play.

	The current system basically seems oriented to keeping everyone, 
players and GM\'s alike, \'in line\' so we play by their rules, and don\'t 
stray away what they want us to do. I think there\'s a line or two in 
the \'Bastard GM from Hell\' list about people like that...

	This might work for a while as a marketing ploy, guys, witness the 
fever built up for the Regency sourcebook, but in the long run, it\'ll 
alienate your customers.

	Just remember that you\'re publishing a role playing game system, not 
an extended novel, and and games depend as much on a broad base of 
source material as anything else.  Try to control the games your 
customers are playing with your system, and they\'ll go away.

sector would be useful...I\'m in the initial process of developing a
campaign set in the Rim...a lone RCES ship misjumps, badly, deep
into the sector and must find their way back.  They will be heroes
in the Coalition...if they survive.

	I\'ll outline the broader aspects and several details of the worlds, 
societies and personalities they encounter as they go in further 
posts. It won\'t be giving much away to say they\'ll probably stumble 
across some verrry interesting parts of the old imperium...Cymbeline 
anyone? heh heh heh.

	I\'ll be taking hints from what GDW has already said about the sector 
in the few references they have in New Era docs, and expanding on it 
in my own fashion.  It certainly won\'t be vanilla TNE, but no 
campaign I\'ve ever run in any system ever played completely by the 
rules...you see I have a story to tell, too, Dave (see my reply Re: 
Dave\'s Editorial)

	What I\'d like to have happen is some more New Era stuff come out,
not just RICE papers.  No offense, guys, those are really well done,
but the Regency is just pretty much the same old traveller, and I\'d
like to see some stuff covering what is out in the Wilds. A sampling
of what I have in mind:

A biowarfare Hobbyist vampire: (BW rules posted, and ship design 
upcoming)

An investigation of just what is the \'Evangelical Doomslayer\'
running Cymbeline, now, per Vampire Fleets. (Burning Spear, a high tech level mutant
Virus who had a large database of human mythology and legend as well
as other resources avaliable...one of Lucan\'s techs had a hobby...)

A human society that has embraced Virus as a partner, and is out to conquer the 
universe. (They hate the Imperium, and on the principle of "The enemy 
of my enemy is my friend"...)

A large ship full of TL 14 computer systems.  It crashed on a planet 
during the Rebellion, and has slowly been covered by the shifting 
sands.  It\'s secret is known only by the sole surviving crew member, 
now an aged advisor to one of the planets many warlords...this is my 
homage world to the Road Warrior series. This is actually an 
adventure originally done for classic Trav that I didn\'t get to run 
when I lived back east, it\'ll need some dusting off and reworking.

	This kind of stuff.  Most of it will be relatively low on stats, and 
higher on narrative content.  This way GM\'s can tailor it to their 
particular campaign.

	But before I can do all of this, I need some info on what is known 
about the Solomani Rim sector. I\'m using the Sector files from 
ftp.ghost.missouri.edu as a starting point for system names and 
stats, and running them through a collapse-ifier program I have to 
get a lot of the new era grunt work out of the way.

	This is a work in progress, so it may go in fits and starts.

_Survival Margin_ has the Zhos rotating ships out of the front line with the
Marches and (probably) sending them coreward - a bit like Lucan\'s use of the
huge Corridor Fleet, I guess. I think that a similar power vacuum may have been
created along the Zho-Regency border - but the Regency is less inclined to

it than the Vargr were in Corridor.

	well, it seems I am not the only one criticl of the Storyline 
focus of GDW. But as I said before, it\'s their call... 
BTW, what veer happened to DGP. Do they still exist? 

About the World Builders handbook - sure it was a lot of work, but if 
all the players wanted was to refuel at the starport, I usually didn\'t 
bother detailing everthing. AS for the low percentage of habitable worlds,
well, we don\'t know anything for certain, but based on the solar system
it is improbable to find a habitable world. Sure, there is Earth, but there
is also Mars, Venus, Mercury, the Moon, etc... The chain of events that must
occur in order for a world to be hospitable to human life is long and 
complicated. For instance; a planet must fall within a very small mass range,
(in order to retain an atmosphere), it must be at just the right distance.
It\'s star must be relatively stable. It should have an iron core (to provde aa 
protectice magnetic field), it must have oceans. it must have an atmosphere of
oxygen with just the right partial pressure. notice that the only known way 
to produce such an oxygen atmosphere is through LIFE. thus the world should 
have at one point at least developed oxygen producing lifeforms.. etcetc.
Earth seems to be a rare planet.. 
I would be extremely surprised if the universe contained an earth-like planet 
around every G type star, not to mention around MV\'s , F class stars, brown dwarfs, binaries, and whatever else you can find in some of the sector data. 

AS for Meson guns. well, I like the idea of them being merely very high-penetration weapons. although I must admit that I like the idea of deep meson sites... I just don\'t like the other applications, i.e. battlefield MGs, or small 
ship-board ones on the bridge used to supress mutinies.. ( an idea mentioned 
on the ML a month ago or so.) perhaps some physicist can figure out a 
massive, unstable neutrino? 
speakng of which - I have to disagree with the current rules that make neutrino
sensors useless for detecting ships. Two years ago a friend of mine worked 
on a neutrino detector set up to detect neutrinos emitted from a nuclear 
power plant. at TL-8! true  , the thing was big and close to the reactor, but 
the point remains - we can almost do it now. at TL-15 what with control of the 
weak nuclear force, I think it should be easy. 
and it doesn\'t have to be a playability problem. on the contrary, it make s
space combat that much more interesting. surely you remeber the Diskhilii maneuver? Not to mention that a gas giant would probably emit enough random neutrinos to be a good thing to hide behind. 
also, I recall a rumor of a proposal by someone at TRW wanting to make a 
directional high-sensitivity neutrino sensor, supposedly his case was not 
scientifically unsound. But the Navy vetoed the idea. I wonder why? ;)

in the same vein, have you ever heard of LIGO? sounds like a prototype 
densitometer... 

I think what I\'m trying to get at is that whenever someone starts saying 
"this is the way this universe is. we make the game - use it or make your own"
you start to limit the possibilities that a bunch of interested gamers can dream up. the ideas aired on the TML alone would, if implemented in official rules,
certainly add a lot of depth to the whole Traveller universe. 
if the game were more of a framework, with many different regions with different histories, gaming focii, possibilities, etc, there would be a place to
suit almost every campaign. 
ah well, enough now..

Oh, also, wasn\'t Cymbeline rather totally nuked by Lucans forces in the late 
1120\'s? I seem to recall a TNS message saying that most of the cyberlife 
on the planet had been destroyed... 
sorry to bring it up.

I suspected as such: I have no Traveller material for Efate.  However, 
it\'s such an important world that I felt that I _had_ to develop it, for 
my own sanity.

I second this opinion.  I try to keep my worlds \'legit\'... sorta... but I 
definitely have limitations.  The Keeper of the Papers may want to put a 
disclamer on my Efate paper...

First of all I would like to say just on thing that has been on my mind
since Mr. Griffen posted in Digest #427

REGENCY SOURCEBOOK IS HERE!!!!

again, still shouting out loud so all can hear...

REGENCY SOURCEBOOK IS HERE!!!(about bloody time! :)  )

I haven\'t as of yet seen it at Enterprise 1701 (THE Orlando, FL gaming
shoppe!) but I am hoping they will get it by the 1st of the month (aka this
weekend?) I can hardly wait to get my grubbly little fingers on it!

Another matter, directly speaking to Mr. Griffen.  It would appear that Mr.
Plummer has beaten us to the punch with his Efate RICE paper.  Very
interesting work though. I do like the holograms and the religeon behind it.
(Don\'t tell Rimmer of the Red Dwarf that, he might want to be revered as a god!)

One more thing...
An appology to Mr. Currie
It seems that either the e-mail address I have is wrong, your mail server is
on the fritz, or my mailserver will not send to New Zealand.  In any case, I
cant send you the cyberdeck/computer hacking rules because the &*^% Mail
deamon keeps eating them!
So I have decieded to post them on the TML
Also if you want the first installment of  "Tales from the Line" go to the
FTP server for the TML, I think you want digest#375 It includes my initial
test hail (wanted to make sure the thing worked!) and Volume One which
involves the idea of Jump missles.

Soooo....
Volume 3 of Tales form the line will be put on hold.  But I think there may
be a debate about the Efate Rice for some time as somone mentioned in #427
that it "doesn\'t sound like CT" I can\'t rightly say as my collection of CT
toys is EXTREAMLY swiss cheezy and limmited. (I realy started playing
durring the Transition between CT & MT c.1986)

So I am going to post the next instalment like this...

     entirely out of touch with science) system for making worlds. 
     
     This book is good, but it too has drawbacks.  The biggest is that is 
     is almost impossible to produce a habitable world.  Temperature 
     extremes usually make it either too hot or too cold.  It does provide 
     an appreciation of the Earth.<<
     
     Well, on the one hand, the completely inhabitable world _should_ be 
     rare.  Just because we like a planet with an average temp of about 15 
     degrees C and a standard atmosphere doesn\'t mean those should be 
     easily found throughout the universe.
     
     I know what you mean, though.  When I detailed desert world, Jae 
     Tellona, I discovered that the temp, due to the lack of water was 
     something like 140 deg. C.  I decided that Jae Tellona lay one orbit 
     into the outer zone.  My recalculated stats resulted in a hot, but 
     manageable 22 degrees, if I remember correctly.

     Not necessarily.  It\'s a gamble.  You may want to highly detail about 
     10 worlds you _expect_ your players to go to, and then use the added 
     information for the ones they actually visit.
     
     I have the advantage in my current campaign because it\'s of the 
     mercenary variety.  They go where they get a ticket and I get to

Howdy,

I still haven\'t figured out the interaction problem... *sigh*

Anyway, it\'s interesting to note that because of beam slop, as well as
smearing, MGs will leave a detectable area along the beam path.  This
means that an old thread regarding invincible deep site MGs isn\'t too
much of a problem, you detect the beam at 2 points, and folllow it
through the planet.  You might not get a lock, but you can  fire shots
into the most likely spots until it stops shooting bach.

Also, if it fires more than once, you have 2 convergent lines... BOOM.

So will the high-penetration version of the MG kill deep site mounts?
I\'d say no, they just have to be really big.  Maybe they\'d be bigger
than a ship weapon that delivers the same DV to the target.  No problem,
size doesn\'t matter for these.  Maybe for deep site mounts you subtract
the absorbtion/scattering right out of the DV before you actually attack
the target.

To do this, treat the depth of the site (actually the path length of the
beam through the planet) as "armor".  Force the beam to penetrate the
planet, then attack the target with the remaining DV.

The deep site MG will be designed to fire through a certain amount of
crust and still deliver a decent DV to capital ships.  The attacking
ships might have to be very close to penetrate the crust... or at least
within short range and directly above to minimize path length through
crust.

I like this outlook on MGs a lot.

But the fact of the matter is a Lab Ship can\'t easily explore a world with a D,
E or X-class starport if it is more than than a jump-1 from a minimum of a 
C-class starport. Very limiting even in MT or CT times.

Actually this is no longer true.  In the Gulf War the Army was forced to 
combat-loss (self-destruct) an M1A1 Abrams that got caught in a ditch.  Several 
attempted close-range shots from other M1A1s were totally ineffective, and it 
took several hours to finally resolve the situation.  Not only was the M1A1 
impervious to Iraqi MBTs, it was also highly resistant to close-range attacks 
by US MBTs.  There is a good (and amusing) description of this in Tom Clancy\'s 
Armored Cav book.

As for David\'s main point, I wholeheartedly agree.  I have noticed that GDW not 
only designed a limited amount of equipment, but also much of that equipment 
(especially the tanks and starships) was horribly weak compared to the 
potentials of the tech level.  I have been able to design fairly inexpensive 
MBTs that could take on dozens of Intrepids.  Maybe I misinterpreted some of 
the FF&S rules, but it looks to me like they tried to "backdate" some old MT 
designs without bothering to look at how these designs could be 
upgunned/uparmored under the FF&S rules.

Still, any vehicle designs GDW includes are appreciated, if only becuase it 
saves me the effort of designing them myself.

As for GDW\'s reluctance to reveal "too much" I think they are fleeing ghosts.  
A region of 11,000+ worlds culd never be detailed so fully as to prevent GMs 
from finding someplace to do the adventure or campaign they want to do.  
Detailing the overall framework (the Imperial government and its neighbors) and 
some interesting sideshows (Grandfather) only adds to the possibilities for the 
GM and his/her players.  I appreciate the fact that the folks at GDW want to 
unfold an epic storyline, but the reality is that tightly pre-programmed 
storyline adventures rarely work.  How many of you tried playing TSR\'s 
Dragonlance adventures for AD&D?  This was the far end of the tight-control 
spectrum, where the players were expected to follow EXACTLY the plot of the 
books.  GDW does not seem to have gone that far, but by setting up a series of 
storyboard adventures moving towards a very predetermined goal, the GMs and the 
players are in danger of being forced to either exactly follow the script of 
completely disassociate themselves from fur=ture GDW adventures.  The old CT 
adventure format was much more free-form; the adventures were not really 
interconnected, or as in the case of the Traveller Adventure formed a concise 
but limited campaign.  It was easy for GMs to pick and choose adventures for 
their own campaign, or to set up "mini-campaigns" as desired.

I have not given up hope, though.  With the exception of their artwork, the 
quality of GDW\'s Traveller material has been steadily improving, and they 
really seem to be making an effort here.  I think that, even with this 
difference in gaming philosophy, I can dig up enough material from GDW\'s 
publications to make buying them worth my time and money.  And I am still 
fortunate enough to have pretty much all of the original CT/MT background 
material.  Time will tell.

    'body' => 'Hi folks, I\'ve just joined the list and after lurking for a week or so in
order to get a handle on the threads, I thought I\'d add my two cents to a
number of the topics. 
 
First, regarding the complaints about the limitations of the Coalition
Space campaign, I feel obliged to stand to GDW\'s defense.  As Dave states
in the _Challenge_ 77 editorial, one of MT\'s flaws was that "in order to
leave space for everybody\'s personal campaigns, it refused to define too
much about the Rebellion."  Call that approach "Background-Framework" in
that the Rebellion was posited and a background created for it, but then
everyone was left to go on their merry way.  Nice enough for those groups
that wanted a grand saga going on around them, but really it was little
more than wallpaper - the chances for characters to forcefully impact the
progress of the Rebellion were minimal.  
 
The New Era, and particularly the RC, as I see it, gives the GDW team (and
all of the rest of us as well) a chance to narrow the focus a bit and
concentrate on a very limited sector and to write the history of the
Coalition.  I particularly like the reappearance of various NPCs over time
(for example, Cynta Lawter in _Smash & Grab_ and then in _Vampire Fleets_).
 This "Official" campaign is obviously a work in progress to which (one
would hope) players of the system can contribute - perhaps GDW will sponser
official tournament or other events which would then become part of the
history of the Coalition.  For those who aren\'t happy with the Coalition,
there are a tremendous number of options - create your own pocket empire in
a sector far from the official story-line, or adventure in the Regency (for
me, this last is probably the least interesting, because, to my mind, an
established area of space makes it that much harder for the individual to
have a substantial impact).  They all require some work, but (again
speaking for myself) that\'s half the fun.   If you opt not to use the
published material, for whatever reason, that\'s fine, but then of course
you don\'t benefit from what is published - although Challenge is featuring
non-RC material and the Regency book will do so as well.  At the very least
though, you can take the published stuff, strip off the title Coalition and
stick on whatever name you want.  Or create your own using FF&S. 
 
I _do_ agree with the complaint that keeping information out of the hands
of customers is a bit unfair and basically says that we can\'t separate
player knowledge from character knowledge while making the GM\'s task that
much more difficult, but I suspect that it may be more a matter of GDW\'s
not having decided exactly what comes next than anything else, and not
"trying to keep players and GM\'s in line". 
 
As to the complaint about lack of variation in equipment, again I must
disagree (mostly).  Let\'s take air-rafts for example.  The TNE rule-book
provides two basic versions (Open and Enclosed) as well as the military
version (G-carrier). The _RC Equipment Guide_ provides the "Ragtop" Air
Raft which is stated as the "standard air raft in production for all forces
of the Reformation Coalition."  What they have provided is basic equipment
(Milspec) for the RC plus some stuff built by other groups. In digest 426,
Dave Broussard wrote that he disagreed that all 5mm weapons are the same. I
think the point to make is that the primary differences between similar
weapons are cosmetic, but that the basic feature - the amount of damage -is
dependent upon the muzzle energy of the weapon (which in turn is primarily
dependent upon the muzzle energy of the round).  Abstracting from reality
to game terms makes the big difference.  Regarding the "plethora of 9mm
pistols on the market today", the operative term there is "market". 
Standardization need not exist on a balkanized world such as ours.  Most of
the equipment presented in TNE has been milspec and as such remains limited
in variation, outside of prescribed options. Note, however, that page 111
of the Equipment Guide states that the vehicles presented may be modified. 
They just aren\'t going to do all the work. 
 
In digest 425, Eamon Watters complained that not enough information has
been provided about what\'s to Trailing and Rimward.  I think that this
represents the coreward strategy being pushed by the Aubani and the concept
of the "Closed Frontier" which views the Trailing/Rimward direction as
eminent domain of the Hivers.  Admittedly, this does not explain the
Bootstrap and Colony operations at So Skire and Poyzen, something that does
need to be reconciled.  On the other hand, it is important to remember that
the Hivers only contacted what is now the RC ten years ago in game time,
and that the Dawn League trading expeditions were sent out only three years
ago.  There has not really been enough time for all this stuff to be
detailed. 
 
Eamon also commented on some of the ships.  Again, I think it is important
to remember that the ones that you are concerned about are all relic
technology and thus designed with the more abundant facilities in mind -
some also might be more likely to have survived in the Regency than in
Coalition Space.  Benjamin Lane talked about the Gazelle fuel skimming
issue.  The lab ship in CT (Double Adventure 3:  Death Station) was "a
moveable research and development station" rather than an exploration ship.
It appears that the pinnace was replaced by the launch via the revised
design system in TNE - since the ship itself displaces 390 tons, all that
it can carry is a 10 ton launch given that the drives and controls are
configured for the 400 ton displacement.  On the yacht, I don\'t see why it
can\'t land, as a needle configuration with CG lifters can land, even if it
is unstreamlined (at least as I read FF&S), and it has fuel purification
machinery, so it should be able to refuel almost anywhere (although it is
not clear whether fuel scoops are included - which I would doubt, as the
vessel was a noble or rich person\'s vehicle). 
 
Well, I guess that\'s about all I have to say for now (as if it isn\'t more
than enough).  By the way, having just moved to NYC, I\'m looking to find a
new group.

     Kubishush, or Unan Olov as it is known to its natives, is one of the 
     more hostile places one may visit in the Regency.  The native minor 
     race, the Gl\'lu, are friendly enough, but the buckling terrestrial 
     surface and corrosive nitrogen-rich, ammonia-tainted atmosphere of the 
     planet tend to make even a routine stopover an adventure.
     
     To get to know Kubishush, one need only get to know the Gl\'lu.  The 
     Gl\'lu have, at least to human perceptions, formed an entire 
     civilization based on planetary cataclysms.  Their world, a roiling 
     hell by the standards of any of the major races, is so subject to 
     natural catastrophes that its entire sentient culture is based upon 
     surviving its earthquakes, storms and volcanic explosions.
     
     With 11 tectonic plates and a seismic stress factor of over nine, 
     Kubishush is highly unstable.  Constant earthquakes and aftershocks 
     rock regions throughout the planet\'s dozens of major faultlines.  
     Kubishush is known to have 13 to 16 continents at any one time, with 
     occasional continental separations and convergences increasing or 
     decreasing the number from time to time.  Immense mountain ranges 
     crisscross the planet\'s continents like a web.  While the geological 
     and meteorological upheavals of Kubishush are great enough to cause 
     dozens of small catastrophes every year throughout the globe, every 
     decade or so, a quake, storm or volcanic eruption hits that is so 
     severe it warrants the title of Yulangngol, or "Great Cataclysm."  
     These events are so commonplace on Kubishush that they have been 
     integrated into the Gl\'lu culture.  Many Gl\'lu religious groups hail 
     these events as signs from otherworldly deities.  Secular Gl\'lu groups 
     look at these natural disasters as opportunities to prove Gl\'lu 
     prowess in the areas of environmental and disaster recovery 
     technology.
     
     At the time of first contact by the IISS, the Gl\'lu had independently 
     achieved a high-common technology level of 8.  After Kubishush was 
     incorporated into the Imperium in 188, IISS representatives offered 
     technological aid to lessen the impact of the planet\'s frequent 
     catastrophes.  The IISS was politely refused in the characteristic 
     Gl\'lu way.  Such technological assistance, ruled Gl\'lu leader Sananes 
     Nuruva Gogonas, would upset the balance of Gl\'lu culture.  Most Gl\'lu 
     heartily agreed.  The basis upon which one socially advances in Gl\'lu 
     society is proving one\'s skill at averting the affects of natural 
     disasters and helping those less fortunate Gl\'lu who are vicitimized 
     by the whims of nature.
     
     The Gl\'lu Sananes, literally translated as "young one," is the 
     solitary ruler of the entire planet.  Sananes are elected by a council 
     of elders from among the dynastic families of the Unaga, or "exalted 
     ones."  The Sananes rules from early adolescence until it reaches 
     maturity at about the age of 32 human years.  Geriatric effects set in 
     so quickly after maturity for Gl\'lu that their culture has developed 
     the tradition of bestowing leadership upon its youth.  The position of 
     Sananes is an honored one, but little fought over.  The 17 electoral 
     gerontocrat seats, however, are vehemently sought by Unaga who pass 
     maturity.  A gerontocrat electoral seat is held for the lifetime of 
     the Gl\'lu who acquires it.  Because of the long lifespan of the Gl\'lu 
     (about 120 human years), opportunities for gerontocrat positions are 
     few and far between.  Selection of gerontocrat positions is determined 
     by the outcome of a peculiar tournament, in which all eligible mature 
     Gl\'lu compete with one another for the available seat.  Humans 
     visiting Kubishush during gerontocrat selections have compared the 
     game to "marbles," a game commonly played by human children on 
     low-tech worlds in which small opaque glass spheres are rolled or 
     hurled at each other.
     
     Perhaps the greatest Sananes ever was S\'lmar Vovon, who lived from 
     1098-1192.  S\'lmar developed and administered the global recovery 
     project following arguably the worst Yulangngol in Gl\'lu history.  In 
     1108, over two billion Gl\'lu died when the convergence of two tectonic 
     plates created a quake so severe that Kubishush\'s smallest continent 
     effectively sank below the surface of one of the planet\'s ammonia 
     oceans.  S\'lmar Vovon directed the recovery project so efficiently 
     that other than the fatalities, little evidence of the catastrophe\'s 
     effect on Gl\'lu society could be seen five years after the incident.
     
     Over the post-Imperial contact centuries, trade with the Imperials 
     inadvertantly raised Gl\'lu technology to the point where they could 
     not help but develop better disaster recovery methods.  While most 
     Gl\'lu do not enjoy the benefits of TL-13 technology, the elite Unaga 
     developed ways to protect themselves from planetary catastrophes.  The 
     most popular method utilizes borrowed elements of Vincennezi 
     technology.  The Unaga began to build floating cities with gravitic 
     capabilities to lift them into the upper reaches of Kubishush\'s 
     atmosphere during times of high seismic and/or meteorological 
     activity.  Low-common technology generally reflects the technology of 
     the land-based Gl\'lu, or Kilig Gunati, who comprise the majority of 
     the population.  The Kilig Gunati on the whole do not benefit from the 
     technological advancements made by the Unaga and continue to be 
     subjected to the violent upheavals of the planet.  
     
     While only about 10 percent of the Gl\'lu enjoy high-common technology, 
     the centuries of imbalance have allowed the Gl\'lu to increase their 
     population from approximately 800 million at first contact with 
     Imperial surveyors to about 14.7 billion inhabitants at the present 
     time.  Because of the disparity in technology levels between the Unaga 
     and the Kilig Gunati, however, the Gl\'lu currently have a large 
     surplus of "elite" citizens.  One might think that the Kilig Gunati 
     would resent this arrangement.  Surprisingly enough, they do not.  
     Gl\'lu on the whole are extraordinarily accepting of ewang\'vn or 
     "fate."  Because of a natural propensity for lending a helping hand to 
     fellow Gl\'lu, the Unaga are known to do whatever they can to help the 
     Kilig Gunati through the turmoil of natural disasters.  This 
     extensiveness seems to curtail resentment of the social inequalities 
     that exist on Kubishush.  Unaga factions are surprisingly paternal and 
     territorial over the groupings of Kilig Gunati they protect, however, 
     and are not likely to assist a rival faction with disaster relief.  
     Parcels of Kilig Gunati territory are unofficially under the 
     protection of individual Unaga factions that report to the Sananes.  
     So it is that the ambiguous traits of racial extensiveness and 
     internecine competition meet in Gl\'lu society.
     
     Gl\'lu possess unique physiological characteristics.  The Gl\'lu are 
     hermaphroditic septapods whose metabolism is based on the oxidation of 
     ammonia in Kubishush\'s atmosphere.  Upon first meeting a Gl\'lu, the 
     first feeling most humans have is revulsion.  Their porous mottled 
     skin, six slimy appendages and periscope-like eyestalk make them look 
     like a cross between a Terran octopus and a slug.  Upon first 
     encountering the race during the Grand Survey, scouts mistook them for 
     a far-flung colony of githiasko or genetically altered hivers.
     
     Many archaeologists who have explored the ancient ruins of Kubishush 
     postulate that the Gl\'lu are actually natives of the system gas giant, 
     Oolvig Naseena.  The authors of this theory believe that the Gl\'lu had 
     successfully achieved non-jump spaceflight in approximately -3200 and 
     had successfully colonized Kubishush some time after.  The similar 
     atmospheric content of Kubishush and the Oolvig Naseena highlands 
     bears this out.  Many physiological and historical aspects of the 
     Gl\'lu indicate that the race is not actually native to Kubishush.  For 
     example, the high strength of Gl\'lu limbs and skeletal structure 
     indicate that they evolved on a world with higher gravity, and perhaps 
     a less dense atmosphere than that of Kubishush.
     
     Other evidence that bears this out is Kubishush\'s fossil record.  Not 
     only is there no natural life on Kubishush, but there is no indication 
     that life ever existed on the planet.  The world\'s instability makes 
     excavation a risky proposition at best, however, and most scientists 
     admit that extensive enough digs have not yet been made.  The Gl\'lu do 
     not allow excavation by human archaeologists at several sites due to 
     their religious significance.  These sites are usually epicenters for 
     the world\'s greatest seismic upheavals and become holy burial grounds, 
     not to be desecrated for a period of one nugesan after the upheaval 
     (about 124.25 standard Terran years).
     
     Why the Gl\'lu would have wanted to abandon their comparatively calm 
     home on Oolvig Naseena is subject to a great deal of debate, mostly 
     among non-Gl\'lu historians, paleontologists and archaeologists.  The 
     most popular theory, though unfounded, is that Oolvig Naseena was the 
     victim of a latent biological weapon housed there by the Ancients.  
     During the Final War, Grandfather and the children who allied 
     themselves with him were known to use deadly biological weapons.  Such 
     a weapon killed the entire Droyne race on Zhdant and set the Zhodani 
     back several centuries in their quest for the stars.  The theory that 
     such a catastrophe occurred on Oolvig Naseena assumes that uninfected 
     Gl\'lu, having recently acquired spaceflight technology, set out to 
     colonize Kubishush to escape their doomed brethren who were beset by a 
     bioweapon-induced plague.
     
     Whether or not the Oolvig Naseena theory is correct or not is 
     unconfirmed.  Whatever the case may be, however, the Gl\'lu do not 
     currently inhabit the rocky highlands of Oolvig Naseena\'s icy core.  
     In fact, the gas giant is effectively interdicted by the Gl\'lu for 
     what they claim are religious reasons.  The Gl\'lu claim Oolvig Naseena 
     as sacred ground, not to be desecrated by travellers wanting to skim 
     for fuel.  A considerable fleet of Gl\'lu SDBs enforces this holy law, 
     infraction of which is punishable by death.  Gl\'lu SDBs will not 
     attempt to disable and board offenders of the interdiction, but rather 
     will destroy offenders\' ships or blast them into Oolvig Naseena\'s 
     unforgiving gravity well.
     
     Kubishush\'s turbulent atmosphere, dense over-ocean grav traffic and 
     high number of floating cities make skimming its ammonia oceans a 
     dangerous task, effectively eliminating them as wilderness refueling 
     sites as well.  In addition, no other planets in the system have any 
     hydrosphere whatsoever.  In order to compensate traders for the lack 
     of viable wilderness refueling sites, the Gl\'lu sell imported fuel at 
     their orbital and planetary starports for approximately 50 percent of 
     the normal price found throughout the Regency.  Political pressures 
     from outside the system and the need for trade have influenced the 
     Gl\'lu to grant such generous dispensations of fuel.
     
     Gl\'lu architecture is universally the most sound and durable one is 
     likely to find.  The Gl\'lu mastery of materials technology gives them 
     the ability to produce TL-14 bonded superdense alloys.  The most 
     common shape for Gl\'lu buildings is a flattened sphere with an 
     interior "rolling sphere."  During large quakes, the rolling sphere 
     within rotates on its transverse axis, thereby protecting the 
     inhabited interior structure from toppling onto its side.  The rounded 
     edges, spherical rooms, elliptical entryways and portals of the 
     interior remind many cosmopolitan travellers of aslan architecture.  A 
     closer look, however, will reveal numerous microstruts and jambs 
     throughout the interiors of Gl\'lu buildings, intended to ensure the 
     integrity of each and every wall and doorway.
     
     The Gl\'lu are nothing if not meticulous about safety and the strength 
     of their constructions.  Following punishing earthquakes and storms, 
     Gl\'lu corporate buildings and housing complexes are frequently found 
     intact hundreds of meters from their original locations.  Their 
     inhabitants may be frightened and perhaps bruised, but most often 
     protected by the strength of the building hull.  So strong is the 
     outer hull of these buildings that they can often be recovered even 
     after slipping into crust fissures during particularly heavy quakes.  
     Cities on Kubishush are generally regions dotted with hundreds or even 
     thousands of these flattened spheres, with nothing by dry rocky land 
     in between.  Huge grav tugs are employed to transfer buildings to 
     other regions when a corporate headquarters or factory requires 
     relocation to another Kubishushi region.  Because of the frequent 
     movement of Kubishushi buildings, both natural and unnatural, the 
     planet has no "cities," per se.  Regions are sometimes given 
     unofficial names or nicknames, but due to the everchanging nature of 
     the Kubishushi landscape, the convention of naming geographic regions 
     is almost obsolete on Kubishush.
     
     Because of the Gl\'lu obsession with safety and security, their 
     starships are also unique within the realm of Regency Space.  The 
     Gl\'lu are accustomed to inhabiting small spaces and require only a 
     fourth of the space necessary to lodge the average human.  Staterooms, 
     generally built to house up to eight Gl\'lu, displace only four metric 
     tonnes.  Gl\'lu starships contain hardy ammonia filtration systems to 
     keep the nitrogen atmosphere comfortably tainted.  Humans visiting 
     Gl\'lu starships have noted the constant meter-high fog that covers the 
     floors of the ship.  Many humans marvel at the tight accommodations 
     and seeming uniformity of all rooms on the ship.  Many touring humans 
     have been known to become lost in Gl\'lu ships, unable to differentiate 
     one room from another, an occurrence from which the Gl\'lu derive great 
     merriment.
     
     Perhaps the strangest feature of Gl\'lu starships is their obsession 
     with backup systems.  All Gl\'lu starships have two maneuver drives, 
     one on each end of the ship, negating the need for turnaround and 
     retrofire.  Any ships built for planetary landing also employ two 
     contra-gravity units as well.  While these are the most common 
     redundancies on Gl\'lu ships, many Gl\'lu are known to install their 
     ships with backup power plants, jump drives, bridge workstations and 
     large quantities of backup hull material.  To a human, this lack of 
     concern for wasted space is ludicrous, but to a Gl\'lu, humans are 
     living on borrowed time in their poorly backed up ships.  Most Gl\'lu 
     starships and spaceships are built in the familiar flattened sphere 
     configuration, with large ovular openings for maneuver drive, jump 
     drive and antenna surface space.  It is currently popular to build 
     modular ships with interlinked spheres.  Multiple-sphere modular ships 
     look something like giant metallic earthworms.
     
     Uplifted by Imperial and Regency technology, the Gl\'lu have become a 
     minor starfaring race.  Thousands of Gl\'lu traders can be found 
     throughout the region, selling their high-grade materials and 
     innovative environmental products.  Through years of study, the Gl\'lu 
     have found ways to implement their knowledge of catastrophe-defying 
     technology into usable products by humans, vargr and droyne (the three 
     most common races in the region).  Though the Gl\'lu have also invented 
     high-tech environment suits and PLSSs to protect them and nourish them 
     with ammonia-tainted nitrogen, they generally do not stray too far 
     from home.  Few worlds present an atmosphere that is breathable in the 
     long term for the Gl\'lu and even fewer are dense enough to provide a 
     comfortably high gravity level.
     
     Kubishush is a tumultuous world filled with mystery.  Geological and 
     political concerns make unravelling the mystery all the more 
     difficult.  While the Gl\'lu are an amiable and sociable minor race, 
     eager to trade and exchange ideas with their human and vargr 
     neighbors, they often appear secretive about their history or 
     motivations.  People who know the Gl\'lu are aware that this apparent 
     secrecy is not secrecy at all but rather acceptance.  Living in an 
     environment as harsh as Kubishush\'s, the Gl\'lu have learned to accept 
     impending fate and the frequent death of friends and family members.  
     Discussing such events at length or the long history of Kubishush\'s 
     cataclysms serves no purpose as far as the Gl\'lu are concerned, other 
     than to prolong one\'s sorrow for lost compatriots.

I think that everybody is thinking of the Lab Ship as an Enterprise or
something.  I don\'t think that was ever it\'s intended purpose.  As Mr.
Lane pointed out that is the job of the Donosev class survey ship.

I always thought that the lab ship was just that--a lab on a ship. 
This allows people to do research without having to worried by being
bothered about worrying about hurting the environment around them.  I
never thought of lab research as world exploration.

Re: Equipment & FF&S:
	Over all I am pleased with FF&S, as it seems to work better than 
any other game\'s design sequences.  Can you imagine trying to run a 
semi-hard SF campaign with Car Wars or Battletech design rules?
	However, I do have some gripes.  Can anyone get the range (DF 
SR/IFR) calculations to come out?  DF SR for a 10cm 1000m/s mass driver 
is approximately 15m.  Somehow that doesn\'t work for me.  I have worked 
on solving the differential equations (using Real World artillery to find 
values for c1 and c2) but they\'re quite messy and not really practical 
for everyday use.  I think we can neglect air resistance for DF SR and 
use the point-blank range from straight Newtonian mechanics, but what 
about IFR?  Any ideas?
	Regarding the lack of diversity in published equipment, see below.

Re: Dave\'s Challenge 77 editorial etc.
	Ever since I graduated from basic D&D I have almost always run 
campaigns in worlds/universes of my own creation as I don\'t like being 
tied to -- and paying for ;-) -- TSR/GDW/ICE\'s ideas.  In my TNE campaign 
I have resolved the problems being discussed by setting my campaign in a 
Glimmerdrift Reaches pocket empire.  This locale was chosen _because_ of 
the dearth of published information.  I simply ignored any sector maps, 
generated my own subsectors and planets, collapsed them, and now I have a 
region of space that shouldn\'t be bothered by the Regency or RC for 
several decades _at least_.  And it would shock me if GDW were to publish 
anything to blatantly contradict my work.  BTW, if anyone is interested, 
I have several detailed planetary profiles (analogous to RICE papers) for 
the worlds of the Orthodox Novomir Empire.

Re: World Builders\' Problems
	Mr. Broussard has stated that it is almost impossible to produce 
an inhabitable world.  True; I have had some nightmarish experiences trying 
to put the finishing touches on a world by generating temperature data 
and then discovering that there\'s no way anyone would have survived the 
collapse with a BMST of ~85 degrees C and long, hot summer days.  Again, 
has anyone come up with a fix?  I just tweak the orbital or hydro numbers 
until I get numbers I can live with if I need the planet to be inhabitable.
	BTW, if you want System X to be Aurore, so be it.  It\'s not GDW\'s 
game, it\'s _yours_.  You\'re the GM!

Two questions for those with more Traveller:TNE experience than I:

First:
Space is three dimensional, yet in TNE they only really mention two 
dimensions...How deep is the portion of the milky way that is represented 
in the main books overview map?  By my calculations, if the map is as 
deep as its spinward-trailward dimension (about 730 light-years) then the 
diagonal of the formed rectangular box is about 1378 light-years (from the 
lower coreward-spinward corner to the upper trailward-rimward corner).  
Does this sound right?   It makes the TNE corner of the galaxy much bigger.

Second:
In the copyright material on the title page of the main book they 
conveniently list the printing place of the book as the 
USA...Terra/Solomani Rim (1827 G867975-8).  Does that sound like a 
correct interpretation of our Earth into Imperial Universal World Profile 
statistics?   If so, it puts it into a lot better perspective for me (a 
relative novice to TNE).

thanks.

Hi all,
	The solution to the MG problem proposed by Merrick is good, provided 
we can figure out if the interaction cross-section is low enough. I\'ll try 
to work on that problem in my spare time... One thing to mention - if you have 
deep site MG\'s they will tend to irradiate large portions of the surface of whatever plaent 
ever planet they are placed on, due to the absorbed radiation from the beam.
so don\'t bury them under densely populated areas - oceans are better. Boy, this 
could lead to some great imagery ; brilliant beams of energy emerging from the 
gound, stabbing into space, answered my missles and lasers. Just the kind of thing
to hammer home the point of exactly how destructive planetary invasions are..

also, i have to agree with the smearing of the beam that can be expected.
although by no means do i know enough RQM to tell you how severe it will be.

to go back to a prevous point - Fusion. have we obtained a consensus? 

Oh, I would also appreciate it greatly if you could mail me that explaination of
the sparklers you offered...


and now another question - how far out have humans reached? The zhodani have 
explored in towards the core. presumably they have set up a chain of bases
and colonies. this _must_ be an interesting area to explore. 
The solomani have explored rimward. How far? Have they reached the Orion nebula?
that is a region that promises to contain a _lot_ of processed material (read
valuable resources) from supernovae. In that general direction at about 1000pc 
you find an object known as A0620-00 an almost definite black hole. 
places to go... but did Virus ever reach out that far? 
also, I remeber reading that Virus savaged the vargr and looking at the map in TT
TTNE I see that the infecion went past corridor into Gvurrdon sector. Then 
it should also have gone as far as the Zhodani themeselves. what happened? 
just some food for thought.

cheers,

Yeah, I like this!  I\'ll have to dig out my QM book and see what I can
find.  Also, you\'d get Cherenkov radiation as well... the under ocean
mounts would be spotted by the blue glow in the sea :-)

>also, i have to agree with the smearing of the beam that can be expected.

Yeah, it\'d be useful to know.  It\'s gotten me interested in mesons (a
good enough reason to crack the physics tomes back open :)

And how!  I wish that TNE had been set in a frontier instead of a
wreaked Imperium.  (I ran a frontier campaign a few years ago, but it
was a lot of work)  Hell, even the virus would be interesting in the
fringes someplace (can you tell I\'m not a virus fan?).  Hmmm, I like it.
Maybe pre-virus.  Scouting surveys, merchant explorers find the virus a
little at a time in a real frontier (much unmapped/unsettled).

Yeah, I always wanted to play in the shadow of the Great Nebula in
Orion.  Ah, excellent!  (I took a great picture of it with the plate
camera at the observatory before it was removed forever in favor of a
CCD camera... *sigh*  (not that I mind the CCD camera ;)

To David C. Broussard, re. digest #428:
>Look at the Intrepid Grav Tank.
>It has the same armor value as pen in the frontal arc.  This means that it
>cannot kill itself except through minor penetrations.

GDW upgunned the Trepida in Challenge #77, as a later version. The problem is
that the power required for a 358-pen fusion gun means that the secondary
weapon is gone. This causes problems when you have softer targets but don\'t
want to totally obliterate them.

By the way, how often do you *only* have the frontal arc presented to you?
In my playing at TL 15, pop-ups are out (too dangerous) and so NOE is the
way to go. This plus the mobility of the tanks means that attacks do not
necessarily come from the front. Against any other face, penetration is double
the armour value.

To Alvin Plummer: do you want more data on F8? I could dig out "A Dagger at
Efate" and any references I can remember from things like _The Spinward Marches
Campaign_, or the computer program _The Zhodani Conspiracy_.

Flipping thru the "Fleet: A Survivor\'s Guide" supplement from West End 
Games: it\'s quite interesting and very well developed.  I tend to treat the 
Imperial Navy as "the Royal Navy with jump drive": however, if you want 
to build a rather darker, uglier, more thinly spread out interstellar 
navy, "Fleet" provides attitude to spare.

Wouldn\'t it be nice if GDW developed the Regency Navy to the same 
extent?  However, seeing how long it took for them to provide the Regency 
book, I\'m not holding my breath...

     Yup.  A small fleet nuked the site from orbit if I remember correctly. 
     I don\'t believe we were ever told who it really was but all fingers

     campaign they want to do. <<
     
     I agree.  But now I have to struggle to find a location for my 
     campaigns since GDW arbitrarily destroyed most of it.  Since the early 
     80s when I started playing and reffing this game, I\'ve run campaigns 
     in the Spinward Marches, Deneb, Corridor, the Solomani Rim, Diaspora 
     and Massilia sectors.  I\'ve never felt like I was being stretched to 
     my limits by the influx of material from DGP or any other 
     Traveller-supporting company.  I appreciate the background material 
     for the purpose of establishing a feel to a particular region of space 
     or inhabitants of that region (who come visiting the region I _am_ 
     conducting a campaign in) if nothing else.  Whether or not I ever send 
     players there is of little consequence.  Simply having the opportunity 
     to read descriptive statistics gives a referee insight about the 
     sentients who live there.
     
     Sure, system statistics are static, but any ref is entitled to change 
     system stats if he sees fit.
     
     I think GDW could\'ve told their story without trying to limit the rest 
     of us to telling the same story.  Looking forward to 1206 when the 
     Regency has supposedly begun to gobble up large amounts of wilds space 
     (see Vamp Fleets conclusion).  I\'ve read tml postings about running a 
     700 years later campaign.  I think that\'s a great idea, but then I 
     guess that would require GDW to run another Imperial Grand Survey!

Two and a bit, actually. Recall that parts of Deneb sector are outside 
the Regency
border.  The Trailing sections of the regency make up only fractions of 
the Regency.

Actually, many units were assigned to the Corridor front to counter Vargr 
moves
and then to heavily patrol the entire region (jump six in depth, up to 
and including
the dark between the stars is a lot of volume) in counter-Vampire patrols.
Surely you don\'t think that those little RQS cutters will stop Vampire 
Tigresses,
do you?  Even if you don\'t expect many, you need to defend against them 
at ALL
points (one of the problems with maintaining airtight blockades).

There was also this MAJOR incursion by the aslan that ate up the Trailing 
regions
of the Regency (oh, forgot that did you? GDW hopes so).

So, the Regency Fleet is deployed all around the Regency border - not 
just against
the Zho (who, for that matter, can attack at nearly any point along about 
half of that
border with little effort; with the Regency maintaining a full blockade, 
they won\'t get
intelligence from the outside either).  Not to mention that most of the 
TL15 fleet has
limited access to TL15 maintenance, so parts of the fleet are always 
off-line going to
or coming from maintenance...

>b) The Regency is no direct threat. While powerful enough to be difficult

This year.  All the more reason to remove it before its starts to grow 
like a
cancer.  Further, if done early in the Regency period, it can be 
comparatively
inexpensive; the Virus and the Aslan are available as allies - witting or 
unwitting.
Try thinking in terms of long term existence of the Zhodani and the Regency
clearly becomes a threat.  The Zho started the Frontier Wars for 
certainly less
gain, and against the threat of Imperial aide from down the Corridor.

The opportunity presented for future security by removing the Regency and 
either
slowly expanding into it or replacing it with a less aggressive client 
state are too
good to resist from the Zho side.

{As a role player, it brings up the possibilities of playing a TNE 
campaign "The
Whizzers of ZOZ", wherein the players are part of resistence movement who
whiz against the authorities in the Zhodani Occupation Zone ;-)
hmmmmm. Copyright that.
Might make an interesting "alternative adventure" for Challenge...}

Leaving the Regency as a buffer state is like keeping a baby dragon on your
doorstep to ward off travelling salesmen.  The salesmen learn not to come and
the dragon gets hungry as it grows...

>finally, the Zho\'s DIDN\'T invade. That\'s a \'fact\'. why is for Regecy era

You seemed to have missed the point that it makes sense for the Zho to have
invaded. In not doing so, GDW adds yet another chunk of inconsistency to
the TNE universe, which, IMHO, detracts form their product.

Quick Economic Statistics of the Reformation Coalition

The following numbers were thrown together with rules from classic
Traveller.  In particular, first edition Striker and Trillion Credit
Squadron rules were used to get some economic information about the
worlds of the RC.  World data is according to _Path of Tears_.

Reformation Coalition population: 1.9 billion (1201, _Path of Tears_)
Of this population, about 36% are Schalli, the remainder mainly humans.

Average TL per capita:  10.2
Maximum TL:             12, at Aubaine/Aubaine.

Average TL per capita is the tech level of each world, multiplied by
the population of each world, divided by the number of worlds.  The
result is the approximate average TL enjoyed by the general populace.
  

Total RC Gross Domestic Product:  TCr 30.86
 By worlds with GDPs over TCr 0.1:
    Oriflamme     TCr  8.00         (25.9%)    tech-9
    Aubaine       TCr 20.48         (66.4%)    tech-12 
    Nike Nimbus   TCr  0.84          (2.7%)    tech-9  
    Fija          TCr  0.672         (2.1%)    tech-10  
    Baldur        TCr  0.3           (0.97%)   tech-9   
    Lucifer       TCr  0.288         (0.93%)   tech-8    
 The other worlds of the RC only contribute, in total, 1% of the GDP.
  
These numbers came from a strict application of the Striker rules.
I did not weight the numbers in this first table using the exchange
rate table. 
  
It\'s possible that Aubaine has a far lower GDP due to lower use of 
technology by the Schalli majority.  Aubaine\'s massive GDP advantage
over Oriflamme is due to its\' technology advantage and the fact that
Aubaine is a Rich world.

Spires is so low-tech that it doesn\'t have a GDP that\'s measurable by
the Striker system.

In the old days in the Imperium, military expenditures would be about 
3% of these figures in total for local and Imperial expenditures, but 
it should be higher in the RC -- too high, though, and the tax burden 
on business would hurt the expansion.  I didn\'t figure out the naval
budgets as given in TCS, and the figures you get there contradict the
figures suggested in Striker slightly.  I think that the old Striker 
rules may give results that are a bit low for a developed region like
the Imperium or Regency, but that may actually accurately reflect the 
RC\'s economic circumstances.

  
Average Coalition GDP per capita:  Cr 16500

  For worlds with population greater than ten million:  
    Oriflamme     Cr 10000     |     Cr  6500     Cr 15400  
    Aubaine       Cr 25600     |     Cr 21800     Cr 30100     Ri
    Nike Nimbus   Cr 12000     |     Cr  7200     Cr 20000     Ag
    Fija          Cr  9600     |     Cr  5760     Cr 16000     Po
    Spires        -barter-     |     -barter-     -barter-     Ag
    Baldur        Cr 10000     |     Cr  6000     Cr 16700
    Lucifer       Cr  9600     |     Cr  4800     Cr 19200     Ag

Total RC GDP per capita is calculated directly from the numbers in
the first table.  The first column is in the same units, except by
the most populous seven planets.  On the other side of the bar, the
second column uses the exchange rate tables assuming the numbers in
the first column are in local credits and that we want Imperial Cr.
The third table also uses the exchange rate table, but assumes that
the first column is in Imperial credits and that we want local Cr.
Relevant trade codes for the worlds are in the fourth column, for
reference.

Reference to Spires being Non-Industrial in PoT is wrong; it has a
UWP population of more than 6 in 1201. 


Shipbuilding and overhaul capacity:
  Aubaine         960,000                   tech-12 class-A
  Oriflamme     1,120,000                   tech-9  class-B
  Aurora            8,400 (O:RCN)           tech-11 class-B
  Trybec            8,400 (O:RCES)          tech-10 class-B
  Kruyter               4 (O:Kruytercorp)   tech-11 class-B
  
Aubaine is the only class-A starport; the others are all class-B.
Capacity is in displacement-tons.  Rules from TCS were used; it was
assumed that the RC is at a maximum war footing.  The two worlds 
owned by the military recieved multipliers as if they were civil-
service bureaucracies, as Aubaine is.  The advanced military yards 
are small, but big enough to perform major refits, overhauls, or
repairs on a number of clipper-class ships at once.  The class-B 
starport on Kruyter is barely operational -- it can\'t even service 
a craft the size of a Rampart fighter in its\' refitting bays.

Class-C starports aren\'t included.  They\'re capable of basic repairs,
but not heavy-duty jobs or major ship overhauls, so they aren\'t as 
key to the RC economy as the A and B class starports.

Since even the Standard Astrotronics yards at the starport at Aubaine 
can\'t have been operational much before 1198, and that there are 
other starports there just coming on line, it\'s likely that the RC
is not yet operating their ports at this full capacity.  The time it
took for the clippers to come off the line does jibe well with ship
construction times from classic Traveller.

Michael Bailey <pd82495@wapol.gov.au> posted a RICE Paper on Ruby back in

various
TAS news reports during the 5FW mentioned "Zho atrocities on Ruby" (and other
nearby planets). I always assumed this was just meant as a beat-up, probably by
that wonderful (?) Offal of Naval Intestines (ONI). Do you agree with this?

world!  Dave\'s editorial was, to say the least, interesting reading.  I\'m
not sure that I agree with a lot of it, but I suppose that it\'s reassuring
to know that there _is_ a plan.  I did like the article on collapsing
subsectors - as of tonight I embark on Grand Project #42: Bugger Up the
Solomani Rim.  Now, if only \'Vampire Fleets\' gets here before Christmas...at
this rate I\'ll be lucky to see the Regency Sourcebook before 1997!

At any rate, the Near Bootes Commonwealth needs an overhaul - with four
class A starports and a combined population of over 27 billion, it\'s
probably a _little_ too big.  If anyone is interested in the results, let me
know and I\'ll send \'em.

Well, SPI\'s old game _Outreach_ covered a fair portion of the Galaxy; 
each hex was 1200pc across and 1500pc deep. I assumed this figure was
chosen becuase it makes the spiral arms one hexvolume "thick". So the
Galaxy near Sol should be at least 1000pc "thick".

(_Outreach_ has, I think, the largest scale of any wargame ever
produced; in addition to the hex sizes above, each counter represented
an entre star _fleet_ and each turn a generation\'s time.)

Two-dimensional space is a convenience, and it allows people to think
of these interstellar states in terms they\'re familiar with, in terms
of "regions" and "territory".

Starport G: Spaceports, repair facilities for superficial damage,
            unrefined fuel
Size 8: 8000 mile diameter (or is it radius? I\'m not sure)
Atmos 6: standard
Hydro 7: 70% of surface covered by water
Pop 9: billions of inhabitants
Gov 7: balkanized (no world gov\'t, multiple regional gov\'ts)
Law 5: prohibited weapons: body pistols, bombs, grenades, poison gas,
       portable energy weapons (yeah, right), autofire weapons, 
       light assault weapons, concealable weapons
Tech 8: pre-stellar (superconductors, no pratical fusion power)

Sounds right to me, although the interpretation of the "law" code
is ill-defined on a balkanized world.

Apparently, there was an agreement between the Aslan and the Regency:The 
Aslan pull back from their occupied territories, but keep the Trojan 
Reach "Buffer Zone" between the Regency and the Hierate.

We\'ll soon see what GDW thinks...

[ NOTE: If you actually analyze the starcharts, population, and tech 
levels, the Aslan shouldn\'t have gotten even the smallest Domain of Deneb 
world during the Rebellion.]

Use the rules from Twilight 2000. If you don\'t have it, mail me directly and 
I\'ll look out the rulebook for you and copy the rules out.

I\'m moving house this weekend, so it might be the end of next week before I 
can get to it though.

     >>And GDW had better done it right, too...<<
     
     Y\'know, I\'ve been wondering about this myself.  If Dave Nilsen, Loren 
     Wiseman and the rest of the GDW Traveller crew have so much stock in 
     the RCES campaign, how much heart did they really put into the Regency 
     Sourcebook?
     
     I spoke with Dave about it briefly and he seemed to be pretty excited 
     about the book, but it has crossed my mind that the Regency 
     Sourcebook, because of a lack of effort concerned with this hailed 
     area of space, might not live up to expectations.
     
     I hope that I get the book next week, read it, and breathe a sigh of 
     relief, but this spectre of pessimism has crept into my mind.
     
     Any thoughts?

- is there any precedent in Traveller for a misjump taking a ship back in time? 
I think that some ships have reappeared in the distant future after a misjump, 
but I\'m not sure whether the crew had died of life support failure/age or not. 
If it fits with the Traveller background, then it could have some interesting 
adventure possibilities:

RC exploration reveals a comparitively high tech world where a massive 
proportion of the population are in low berths in deep bunkers, along with some 
valuable manufacturing plants. Local mythology talks of \'gods\' who came to warn 
the people of the danger of Virus. RC experts are unable to explain the 
warning, as other worlds before and after it along a jump main were infected by 
a battleship which passed through all of the systems, and no other worlds 
received a warning. 
While jumping back out of the system, the RC ship malfunctions and a misjump 
occurs. When the players come out of jump, they find themselves exactly where 
they started, but about 70 years too early, and with their jump drive in ruins. 
The players will have a few days before the Virus infected battleship arrives 
in the system to convince the public of the danger and organise protection. 
After sleep in a low berth, the characters wake up, back in the New Era again.

Or more subtle - the players are investigating the world mentioned above, in 
the New Era, and in a deep hangar they discover what appears to be a Coalition 
Clipper, although its registration indicates it has not yet been constructed...

  a) First, please note that the lab ship in TNE has sufficient G-turns to
jump more than once before refueling becomes necessary.
  b) For my own campaign, I created a 360 (400) ton version with a 40-ton
slow pinnace.  This way, the crew can still disembark onto a planet. 
Also, the lab ship can perform wilderness refueling much faster (fewer
trips to the gas giant).

3) re: borders of Solomani exploration
  a) When Traveller first came out, Mark Miller produced a map od
known/charted space.  This map showed the rimward border of the Solomani
Sphere right against the bottom edge of the map.  Further, as originally
presented by Mr Miller, the Solomani were insular; i.e., they wanted the
Imperium out of their space.  They weren\'t really interested in expanding
their borders.  (Of course, this changed with the Rebellion.)
  b) In DGP\'s "Aliens of the Rim: Solomani and Aslan", the map of
known/charted space shows the Solomani Sphere plus another sector or two
(I don\'t have the map right in front of me, so I\'m going from memory) to
rimward.  In this module, they alos make reference to the Perseus Project,
a long-range (1,000+ parsecs) expedition.

The reason why the Zhodani didn\'t invade is the same reason why they haven\'t
resumed expansion in 2000 years. Unfortunately, I\'ve been unable to imagine
just why they haven\'t done that (I suspect MASSIVE internal unrest due to
failure to integrate systems (but for 2000 years...?) or some large
belligerent on the other side of the Consulate (though why we\'ve never
heard of that...?)). 

One possibility is a policy decision not to expand (Indeed, the halt in
expansion 2000 years earlier was the result of just such a descision: to
stop until the worlds already acquired had been integrated into the
Consulate. The enigma is why it has taken 2000 years to do so). The fact 
that it may not be the most logical descision from a wargamers point of 
view is not an inconsistency: there are plenty of historical examples of 
politicians doing things that were less than optimal. One possibility:
The electorate did not want to pay for the cost of invading the Domain.
Never mind that it would be cheaper to do in 1120 than later; later might
not ever come. And if it did, it would be someone else who had to pay.

I think you\'re making a mistake in assuming that everybody knows about 
Grandfather and The Kids. AFAIK the theory that the Droyne were identical 
to the Ancients was just barely beginning to percolate through the Imperial
scientific community in 1110. Grandfather was a mythical Prometheus-figure
unaccountably common to all known Droyne mythologies. The reality behind the 
myth and the very existence of The Kids was limited to one set of intrepid 
adventurers who had visited the big G in his pocket universe and returned 
with a wild tale. What\'s the betting that anybody believed them?

So much for the rational arguments. As a charter member of the _Society for
the Suppression of Grandfather and all that Guff_ I further appeal to all of
you to avoid references to him like the plague. He is one of the lamest plot
devices it has ever been my misfortune to meet, and he does not, repeat NOT,
exist in my personal Traveller Universe.

Seriously, try making references to the Ancients more general in nature. The
average Ancient expert dosen\'t know half of what we Traveller Referees know.

Hi,

I don\'t have 2300, hmm, maybe I\'ll have to find a copy.  This reminded
me that my girlfriend had a lecture from a russian MD when her med
school class was doing radiation... the guy had empirical rules for
prognosis.  They went kinda like this:

Vomits within 1 hour of exposure----fatal within 3 hours.

etc., and so forth.  The interesting bit is that he was asked where this
data came from... he said "we have this data."  they said, "yes, we
know, how did you do the study?"  Answer "we have this data."  :-)

My guess is submarine reactor accidents.

I\'ll ask her for her notes.  If it has estimated exposures, it\'ll make
for good quick and dirty rules.

Notwithstanding the potential Zhodani threat, this is going to be a pretty bug 
mouthful for the Regency.  This kind of reminds me of the Ramshackle Empire 
(2nd Imperium) when the Terrans tried to manage the Vilani Empire.  I remember 
a quote from one of the Solomani Sourcebooks (GDW or DGP, not sure which) 
describing how badly stretched the Terran fleet and civil government became 
after the conquest.  There were cities being goverened by naval raings, and 
entire worlds ruled by navy lieutenants.  The Regency is certainly a lot bigger 
than the old Terran Confederation (pre-Thrid Imperium that is, not the more 
modern version), but it has to maintain a Quarantine and strong forces to 
counter potential Zhodani (and maybe Aslan) expansion.

I really would like that damned book now...

1.  The World Builders Handbook.  Yes it is true that one can tweak the
numbers to get it to work, and it is also true that inhabitable worlds are
probably few and far between, however...Traveller makes the Universe seem
FULL of inhabitable planets.  Now technology can make a marginal planet
habitable, but as Thanasis Kinias points out, creating a planet that has a
mean temp that makes it inhabitable would make most of the Imperium empty of
life.  Also if I am going to disregard most of the planetary generation to
get an inhabiatable planet, then why not just make it up altogether?

2.  Mass Drivers.  This has rather ticked me off, and made me very close to
dropping my interest in GDW products all together.  I was trying to generate
a MBT that uses a mass driver as the main weapon, and discovered that my
3000m/s mass driver had a short range of somthing like 35m.  I looked at the
formulas in great detail thinking that I had missed something as discovered
to my chagrin that the range was based solely on velocity, and that the
formula resulted in waaaay to short ranges.  This is nothing that anyone
didn\'t know.  I called up GDW, and got either Loren Wiseman or Marc Miller
on the phone (I can\'t remember which).  Needless to say I was honored to
speak with one of my favorite game designers.  I told him it was a great
honor to speak with one of the designers of  my favorite game.  He was
unimpressed.  I started to tell him (on my dime BTW) about the problem I was
facing.  He quickly told me to write it up and mail it to them.  I got the
address and wrote a detailed letter with lots of detail etc.  I provided a
self-addressed stamped envelope and requested a response along with a
catalog).  I received neither.  I went out later and purchased Deluxe
Traveller, and then the GM screen with the updated FF&S rules.  I checked
and checked, and NEVER once found any mention of the mass driver problem.
So here I sit fuming again over this stupid MD problem.  In fact I was
rather upset with the entire MD design sequence.  There is no provision for
any type of round other than AP, what about HEAP, Chem, APDS, etc.  You
cannot compute weights and pens easily.  Aaaarrrrrghhhh!  B-(  Sorry had to

_Space_ is three dimensional, but _paper_ is (effectively) two-dimensional.
The 2-D starmaps are a vestige of Traveller\'s early simple-system days, 
but have remained popular because judging distances between star systems
in 3-D, especially during a game session, is complicated unless you happen to
have a handy laptop with you.  Most people don\'t.

If you can\'t accept that, you have three options:
1) Invoke mumbo-jumbo science: in jumpspace, stars relate to each other in
some fashion analagous to 2-D, regardless of 3-D relatons. Thus jump
maps are in 2-D;

2) Find a copy of GDW\'s old game 2300 AD (original title Traveller: 2300),
which uses real star positions within 50 light-years of Earth; or

3) Generate 3-D space yourself.  Been there, done this. I figured a scheme
where subsectors were 8 x 8 x10 parsecs volume, and sectors 4 x 4 x 4
subsectors. I generated one and a half of these 3-D subsectors (with
expanded system generation, ROLLING BY HAND!) before it sank in how 
much work it would be to generate even half a sector. You want to do
this, be my guest, but keep the coffee and asprin handy.

Close enough.  Note that the government type-7 is Balkanized (a word
with renewed meaning in the \'90\'s), not Mystic Dictatorship (unless,
of course, one counts the Illuminati :-).

Law level-5 depends on where one lands.

Ruby is part of the Jewell Cluster, a group of three worlds at the spinward
edge of the Regency.  Dominated by, and reliant on heavily populated Jewell
one parsec away, the citizens of Ruby have managed to preserve independence.
Like Jewell, Ruby\'s location so near to the Zhodani border makes it a
frequent stop for Regency military forces.  However, where centuries of
exposure to the Frontier Wars has given Jewellers an ingrained distrust of
the Zhodani and Vargr, the people of Ruby have an unprejudiced attitude to
all races.

Ruby was first settled in 339, primarily to obtain ores for the inhabitants
of Jewell and Emerald.  Never of great importance, the colony was abandoned
in 362, after large quantities of high-grade lanthanum ores were discovered
on Jewell.  The system remained essentially uninhabited until 634, although
small Zhodani contingents occupied Ruby from 592-603, and in 617.  Both of
these forces withdrew from the system as the balance of the First and Second
Frontier Wars tipped back towards the Imperium.

In 631, Papaieie Sawaiu led a group of leftist libertarians to petition the
Jewell government for permission and aid to settle Ruby.  Jewell\'s
government (which was still legally the owner of the system) granted the
petitions requests (probably more to be rid of a troublesome minority than
anything else), and set aside MCr4.0 to reopen the abandoned colony.  In
634, six hundred Sawaiuites settled a site about 80km southwest of the old
lanthanum mines.  The group began shipping small quantities of platinum to
Emerald in 640, and surprisingly, managed to pay it\'s way.  Sharp falls
precious metal prices in the region in the late 690\'s put an end to the
colony\'s modest prosperity, and Jewell was once again forced to subsidise
it\'s neighbour.

The subsidy was withdrawn in 711, and preparations were made to repatriate
the colonists to Jewell.  The colony, now numbering several thousand, was
saved by the Imperial Government\'s decision to establish scout facilities in
the system.  Tensions between the Imperium and the Zhodani had been
increasing since the end of the Second Frontier War, and the IISS had
decided to upgrade it\'s presence in the subsector as part of a overhaul of
intelligence operations against the Zhodani.  The base and accompanying
starport facilities were completed in 720, many of the existing colonists
were contracted to provide support services for IISS personnel in this
lonely frontier outpost.

The Scout base was hastily abandoned at the outbreak of the Third Frontier
War, it\'s personnel and ships pulled back help defend Jewell from major
Zhodani attacks.  Once again, Zhodani ground troops occupied the world,
taking over the scout base for use in supplying the forces beseiging Jewell.
They pulled out of the system at the end of the war, having largely ignored
the civilian population during their seven year occupation. At the outbreak
of the Fourth Frontier War, Zhodani forces ran into substantial Imperial
naval assets deployed from Jewell.  Their attack was beaten off, and the
Zhodani chose to bypass and isolate the world.  

Ruby was occupied by Zhodani ground forces following a short battle with
Imperial screening forces at the opening of the Fifth Frontier War in 1107.
During the battle, the IMS \'Johore\' was forced down onto Ruby\'s surface.
It\'s surviving crew and marines fled the crash site to begin a guerilla war
against the Zhodani.  In response to raids, the Zhodani commander took
hostages from among the civillian population.  Unfortunately, twelve of the
hostages were killed in an abortive rescue attempt by the guerrila forces.
When news leaked out, the Imperium made it\'s celebrated accusation of
Zhodani atrocities against Ruby\'s civilians.  Perhaps surprisingly, the
Zhodani occupation of Ruby was rather benign - the unfortunate Zhodani
ground forces commander was replaced, and reparations were paid to the
families of the deceased.  A ceasefire was negotiated between the Zhodani
and the guerillas shortly afterwards.  The Imperial Marines were guarenteed
safe passage aboard a neutral vessel to Imperial-held space, were they were
feted as heroes.  Their commander, Lt. Rivka Moishe, was later knighted by
Duke Norris of Regina for her actions.

Since then, Ruby has remained on the \'front lines\'.  Imperial, and later
Regency fleets regularly deployed to the system for exercises.  The thaw in
Regency-Zhodani relations from 1117 onwards saw the scout presence scaled
back, and the scout base was transferred to the Regency Quarantine Service
in 1146.  The RQS operates a Customes Station on Ruby, primarily to inspect
the small number of Jump-1 ships travelling along the Jewell-Cipango Main
from the Consulate.  Naval units also routinely deploy here from Jewell and
Mongo for joint exercises with RQS and RSS units.

Regular RQS customs procedures are in effect on Ruby.  Incoming starships
will be escorted to the RQS station on Eloise Tay, the small outermost moon
of Boyden, the system\'s only gas giant.  The permanent presence of the RQS
\'Carlton\', a 4000 ton Quarantine Service Carrier, provides the muscle to
back up RQS directives.  Extensive examinations of the starship and it\'s
crew will take 1-3 days (for starships under 1000 tons).  During this time,
crews and passengers are \'invited\' to stay at the \'Eloise Hilton\' (the
somewhat spartan guest accomadations on the station).

Following inspection, the ship is free to move on to Ruby, or to refuel at
Boyden and jump outsystem.  Ruby itself has only one starport, the Class B
RQS facility on the world\'s surface.  This starport is open to civillian
traffic, although berthing fees are considerably higher than for comparable
private facilities.  The base\'s repair and maintenance facilities are not
available to civillians excepts in emergencies (although detatched duty
Scouts and RQS officials are welcome).

New visitors will be steered towards \'Ruby\'s Startown Bar\', on the edge of
the starport complex.  \'Ruby\'s\' is famous throughout the region for it\'s
cheap booze (and other, less common stimulants), and for it\'s bouncers.
Unruly patrons are given a brief lecture on the anit-social aspects of their
violent behaviour by the doormen (a lecture given with absolute sincerity ).
Continued troublemaking will normally result in extremely violent ejection
and arrest.  All staff at \'Ruby\'s\' are members of the Stivlprerqaf family,
descendents of a Zhodani prole who fled across the border in 992.  The
current manager is Jdishehtaev Stivlprerqaf (Jdishehtaev is probably better
known in the Regency as \'Jades Stive\', acclaimed romance novelist).  

Sawaiu Town, the only substantial settlement of Ruby, adjoins the RQS base.
Almost all of Ruby\'s 19,900 permanent inhabitants live here.  The town
itself consists of four pressure domes atop an underground tunnel complex.
The domes are given over largely to parkland - each dome has a different
environment and \'theme\'.  In order of size, these are:  Sawaiu Dome (Terran
/ Tropical Maritime), Isgiidu (Vilani / Highland), Summondamus (Terran /
Desert) and Taenu Diran (Sylean / Savannah).  Residential, commercial and
support areas are all underground.  Local although the world is small, local
gravity is a reasonable 0.78g, due to the planet\'s higher than normal
density.  Atmospheric pressure is maintained at 0.8 standard atmospheres,
making the environment tolerable for most visitors.

Visitors will find the locals friendly and agreeable, if somewhat strange.
Non-violence is an important part of the Rubyan lifestyle, although
potential criminals are warned that Ruby\'s law enforcement officials are
generally hired from offworld, and do not have the same passive ethic.
Offenders face deportation and confiscation of their assets if caught -
within a short time, they will find themselves on Jewell with little more
than the clothes on their back.  Given the world\'s reliance on offworld
powers for it\'s continued existence, foreigners are treated with respect.
Merchants on Ruby will buy and sell for fair prices - at any rate, they are
trading for the good of the colony more than their own gain.  A disgruntled
customer won\'t come back, a potential loss for the world.

Ruby\'s inhabitants are fiercely egalitarian - the concept of \'privelige\' is
repellant to them.  Without exception, all citizens are allocated the same
communal floorspace in Sawaiu Town\'s residential areas.  this concept of
\'equality of opportunity\' is one of the basic tenets of Ruby\'s society - the
lasting legacy of the settlement\'s commune origins.  The settlement\'s ruler,
the \'Premier\', is directly elected by all permanent residents for a two year
term.  Traditionally, the office is one of the lowest paying jobs on the
planet.  Although the Premier is responsible for all aspects of
administration, much of the more judicial and administrative work is handled
by a council of elders.  Membership in the council is voluntary and unpaid,
but anyone over the age of 40 can join.

One interesting custom practised by the Rubyan is \'fostering\'.  Ruby lacks
all but the most elementary educational facilities, children are instead
sent to Jewell to complete their education.  A child will spend from three
to twelve years on Jewell as a \'fosterling\', before returning to Ruby as an
adult citizen.  

Most of Ruby\'s residents are employed either directly or indirectly by the
RQS, although some mining still takes place.  Mineral ores are shipped
mainly to the agricultural worlds of Emerald and Esalin in exchange for
food.  A small nunmber of independant miners eke out a precarious existence
from gold and platinum deposits.  All large scale mining is conducted by
RubyCorp, a statutory authority run by the government.  Miners typically
spend six weeks at a time in the camps, followed by six weeks layover in
Sawaiu Town.  Independent miners number less than two hundred, and typically
live permanently at their workings, coming to town only to sell their ores
and resupply.

Ruby maintains a small fleet of four Type R Subsidised Merchants, used to
service the mineral trade with Emerald and Esalin.  The \'Papaieie\', \'Rhys\',
\'Topaz\' and \'Guiding Hand\' are all subsidised by the Ruby and Regency
governments.

Safety procedures weren\'t all that strict in the early days of the Atomic Age.
I worked with a man who had been involved in nuclear research in the late
1940s. He described sitting the cafeteria when someone would begin to vomit
blood all over the floor. Everyone\'s exposure was tracked with some care, 
so the medical team got lots of empirical data on what a lethal dose of 
radiation was whenever someone dropped dead.

Fun with science, I guess.

	<sad story about heroes at GDW turning out to be jerks deleted>

	I\'m sorry to hear that you went to all this trouble without 
getting any help from GDW.  The answer is actually quite simple and was 
posted to this list sometime last year I believe.  The corrected formula 
for MD range is as follows:

Page 110

 (Correction): The formula for computing the direct fire range
 of a mass driver is wrong. Replace the second paragraph of the
 "1. Direct Fire Range" subsection with the following:

 "Short direct fire range in meters for a mass drive gun firing
 a kinetic penetrator round is equal to _five times the sum of its
 bore size in centimeters plus one-twentieth its muzzle velocity
 in meters per second plus 20. SR = 5 [B + (V\\20) + 20]"_

	This was part of a much larger errata sheet. If you enjoy using 
FF&S you will probably want it.  You can get a paper copy from GDW, but 
given your recent experience with them, I would be glad to email you a 
copy.  Provided, of course, that you promise to post your designs to 
the list, or at least mail them to me.:-)
	A suggestion for designing MDs, particularly at lower tech 
levels, is to use an EPG for power rather than a larger powerplant.  This 
works nicely because it is little larger than the HPG you need for the MD 
anyway, and you can carry only as many PPCs as you have rounds, which 
comes out to be much smaller than a dedicated powerplant.  Again, this 
difference is particularly large at lower tech levels.  MDs are great for 
shooting hyper-velocity penetrators, but they\'re not so good for HE and 
HEAP rounds that you might want to use against personnel.  For an areea 
affect weapon, you can\'t beat a plasma gun, but they get real big in a 
hurry.  A good compromise weapon is the good, old-fshioned ETC CPR.  If 
you want, I bet you could use a little excess powerplant capacity to do 
away with the bulky batteries for this gun, too.
	Anyone know what the official rules are for determining the
concussion and blast effect of high-energy weapons?  I haven\'t been able
to find a rule for this anywhere.  The system I came up with for
concussion, which approximates published values pretty well, is Pulse
Energy(Mj) - .1*Pulse Energy.  I don\'t know about Burst though.  For that
I just eyeball it.

Re: Radiation T:2000 rules

Effects of Exposure:  Exposure to lower levels of radiation will produce 
temporary illness, while higher levels can ckill.  All exposure is 
cumulative.  When a character\'s accumulated rads reach or surpass 50, he 
must be checked for radiation illness.  Thereafter, each time the 
character accumulates one or more rads he must be checked for radation 
illness.  however, the character is checked for radiation illness only 
once per day on each day that he accumulates additional rads.
	The Radiation Illness Chart (below) gives the multipliers used to 
determine the chances of illness and death from exposure to radiation.  
Use the rad level on the chart that is closest to (without exceeding) his 
accumulated rad level.

Rads	Slight Illness	Serious Illness	Death
50		1.0		nil	nil
100		0.5		1.0	nil
300		0.2		0.5	1.0
400		Auto		0.2	0.5
600		Auto		Auto	0.2
800		Auto		Auto	Auto

	Multiply the character\'s Constitution by the multiplier to 
determine his target number (round fractions up).  Roll 1D10.  If the 
number rolled is equal to or less than the chance, the character avoids 
the effect.

Slight Illness:  Nausea, vomiting, and headaches.  Onset is 1D6 hours 
after exposure.  The character has strength, agility, and intelligence 
halved for the duration of the illness.  Symptoms last one day at lower 
levels, two days if exposure is greater than 600 rads.

Serious Illness:  First suffers slight illness, as above,.  Then suffers 
serious illness and is incapacitated with severe vomiting and diarrhea, 
spotting on the body caused by bleeding under teh skin, and blood int he 
stool and vomit.  Onset of serious illness is 2D6 days after exposere at 
levels less than 300 rads, 1D6 at levels above that.  Incapacitation 
lasts 1D6 days, plus one day for every two days spent without bed rest 
and medical care.  The amount of medical care required is the same as for 
a character with a serious wound to two body parts -- or two additional 
body parts if the character is already wounded.  General illness, 
approximating the effects of slight illness listed above, will persist 
for 1D6 weeks.

Death:  The character first suffers from slight radiation illness and 
then from serious radiation illness.  During the incapacitation period 
(and usually within 30 days of exposure) the character dies.

	At higher tech levles, presumably an automed could treat slight
and serious illness at increasing levels of exposure, and a full medical
facility could prevent death, and "roll-back" a persons cumulative
exposure.  The description in FF&S of the consequences of getting too
close to a Fusion Drive suggest that bone marrow transplants etc, would be
necessary, so presumably the character is till going to be laid up for
some time. 

	*Apologies to those not interested in radiation, but enough people 
had expressed an interest that I thought it was worthwhile.

You know, the galaxy is actually rather thin out here in the boonies.
The star-forming regions lie in a plane some 100 pc thick, while 
most stars lie within a disk 1000 ly (300pc) thick. So conceivably
the Imperium is no more than a sector or two thick. nevertheless, 
you probably have to assume that there are a lot more stars around than 
what you see on the map..

I find it annoying that what defines law-level is the kind of weapons 
you can carry around. this is too obviously a concession to the 
hack-and-slash gaming style typical of D&D. what about the civil liberties,
or legal rights of the citizen, or even the harshness/leniency of the

Why wouldn\'t they expand? How about private ventures? Or are they 
just as stagnant as the Zhodani? 
What I see here is a problem - for reasons of playability (read laziness)
rulemakers have elected to limit the expansion of various empires without
giving a satisfactory explaination. Space is virtually unlimited, and
relatively homogeneous (at least in this neck of the woods). there is no
reason why growth wouldn\'t be enormous, given the ease of space travel
in the Traveller Universe.

Again, why go 1000+ parsecs if you haven\'t settled the next sector over?

There are enough inconsistencies that are far worse than why the zhos 
didn\'t undertake a MASSIVE military operation with a definite high cost
against a foe they have only narrowly defeated in five wars over 1000 years,
with the sole intent of preventing a _possible_ threat sometime in the 
next 100 years.

Ask Congress if they want to invade Russia just because it has the
potential of being a threat again in 30 years...

That\'s your perogative. But if you want the exrta "feel" of authenticity,
I find that figuring out creative and acceptable ways around these problems
is a fun challenge for a ref.

interstellar deep space- along a 100 pc frontier.
Calculate the resources needed and you\'ll see it\'s something Grandfather
would find difficult.
what you can do is put sensor drones around refueling points, and patrol
space very often over a 10-20 parsec deep patrol zone. to do this 
you need _lots_ of Virus-proof patrol vessels. Thus the Regency should 
be pretty good at Virusproofing. 
Now, the principal threat to the quarantine will _not_ be vampire 
tigresses, for many reasons. a) there werent many tigresses around by 
1130 - they tended to get blown up, right?  b) maintenance. to keep a 
patrol cutter running you need to coerce a crewman or two, to maintain a 
tigress you need to coerce a few hundred, as well as a naval base. 
Thus the threat during the 1140\'s was xboats, pirates, fleeing free traders
and refugees. to deal with them you need to localize them, intercept them
and either sterilize them or destry them. the best organization for 
this I would imagine as being a mulit-layered system consisting of 
long-range recon patrols combined with sensor drones. these rely on stealth
to give an accurate picture of what is out there, so as to better be able 
to intercept. that is the outermost layer.
inside that you establish checkpoints and clearing areas where all traffic 
is routed through sanitization/transfer. this is where you maintain the 
visible cordon - naval patrols, Quarantine Stations etc.
but the important part of the Quarantine is what you don\'t see - the LRRP\'s
and the Task Forces that they can call upon for support. As well as the 
not infrequent Search-and-Destroy mission. 
In order for the Quarantine to work it would have to be an ACTIVE defence.
thus you might find stealthy RQS patrol vessels in Vland sector.  
to just put the navy out on the frontier and wait for Virus to come to 
you is an invitation for disaster.

I used a misjump through time to drop one of Steve\'s Traveller 
PCs onto early 20th C. Earth, into a Call of Cthulhu adventure.
Said character eventually shipped out with the ESA slowboats
that founded the Island Cluster civilization. Allliance players,
THAT\'S where Admiral Isaac Conner came from.
In that case, a Scout Ship whose jump drive was 
sabotaged to misjumped was forced to jump by an
induced power surge in the jump grid.  I decided that
the massive double-shaft misjump should be 
spectacular, weird, and provide a whole new insight
into why some misjumps cause complete disappearance
of the ship...

incidents that came out of the first Traveller campaign
I ever played in.  It was Classic Trav, started before
Spinward Marches Campaign came out , thus
the references to non-Imperial empires.  It made
for a good story, and it could fit in a pocket TNE
empire just fine.  Hope this starts a thread.
The Original Incident was, well, incidental to playing 
the old "Traveller Adventure 1:Kinunir" module...]

----
"So you want to know the truth behind the accident that destroyed
the Confederation\'s capital city, eh?" Bianca Mordell takes a drag
from the Terran cigarette you gave her.  "Immunity from prosecution,
of course, and get me off this damn prison planet!"  You nod,
saying you\'ll do what you can.  You\'re pretty sure you can get 
her sentence commuted; she was convicted of illegal psionics use,
and the political climate has changed considerably since then.

"We were hired to get some information on some piece of military
 hardware mounted on the then-obsolete Kinuir class warship 
used by the Confederation.  In those days, we were citizens
of the Fourteen Worlds -- this was before the 3rd Imperium
moved in and "assimilated" us -- and the Nebular Planetary
Confederation were our closest neighbors and enemies.  Okay,
 I admit it, we were hired as freelance spies...

"We being myself, recently resigned from the 14 Worlds Navy,
my brother, former Army Sgt. Brian Mordell, and ex-Marine,
ex-Commando Sgt. Sherman Bolo Lee -- deadly in a fight,
a complete sociopath, and dumb as a post.  Not that my late
brother was all that smart, either.  And then there was that
fool whose name I forget who caused the whole mess.
Former Scout Service puke, if I remember correctly; I believe
it was his ship we used for our trip to Regina.  Lord knows,
when it came to brains, he made Sherman look brilliant.

"It\'s a matter of public record now that Sherman is wanted
for assorted murders as well as illegal psionics, so I 
suppose I can admit that he was also a telepath.  Remember
in those days just being a psi was a capital offense in
some places, so those of us who were kept our own kind
of \'Masquerade\', so to speak.  Why did I, a loyal officer of
the 14 Worlds Navy, get psi training?  I never was brain-
washed into blind prejudice, and I wanted an edge when
I went freelance."  She takes another drag from the cigarette.

"Before the Impy Navy moved in, Regina was the capital of 
our local opposition, the Confederation.  It had the usual facilities:
starport, shipyards, navy bases, etc.  In one of those shipyards
was the hull of a scrapped Kinunir.  Our plan was we would 
get pictures, etc from that hulk. We figured on bypassing the 
yard\'s security systems with the help of a "minor diversion".

"Sherman, former demolitions expert among other things , whipped 
a nasty little time-bomb and gave it to our moron Scout friend,
telling him, "We need a diversion; put it someplace delicate but 
important."  Off went the moron on his part of the mission, and 
off the rest of us went  on our part of the mission; Sherman
played bodyguard while I actually took the measurements and 
pictures of the military hardware -- okay, I\'ll admit it, the Black Globe
mount, which I know something about and had the experience to 
analyze -- and Brian played "high cover" from a nearby rooftop
overlooking the scrapyard.

"Infilitration of the scrapyard and the old starship hulk went just fine, 
until our diversion went into effect...

"Moron, with bomb, finds someplace he thinks is "delicate but 
important" ... the starport\'s super-refined hydrogen tank farm. 
 Moron plants bomb at base of hydrogen tank. Moron doesn\'t 
seem to know that liquid hydrogen is explosive. Moron has never
 heard of the concept of "sympathetic detonation". Time bomb 
explodes.  Tank explodes.  Tanks, plural, explode.  Starport 
disappears in not-quite-nuclear fireball.  Nasty firestorm.  
Blast levels buildings for blocks (many blocks) around.  
The mess is just starting.

"I did mention there was a Navy base and starport there, didn\'t I?  
There were several ships sitting around on launch pads, in 
various stages of launch readiness.  Several of them had pilots
who tried desperately to escape the expanding fireball...
One ship\'s soon-to-be dead Navy pilot in sheer desperation punches in
full fusion rockets IN ATMOSPHERE!  He almost made it, too.  
Unfortunately for everyone else, the fusion rockets obliterate what\'s
left of the starport and burns a nice trench through half the city as 
Navy ship crashes from explosion damage anyway.  A large 
warship, fully loaded with armament, tries to get off the pad on normal
takeoff jets, and doesn\'t even it make away from the starport; when
it explodes, radioactive debris from all of its nuclear missile warheads 
is sprayed across the city...  Another ship trying to take off loses
control and crashed into the continental rectenna grid for the solar power
sats, knocking out all power for the city and the continent.

"As for us, well, the multi-thousand-ton armored hull of the Kinunir lurched
about 
four feet to the left,  but protected our hides (that\'s Sherman and I). We
pick 
ourself up with a few bruises, and wonder what the hell happened.  Brian,
who was on top of the building does not fare so well as half the building 
falls out from under him, and the other half falls on top of him. Moron is
never 
seen again, presumed vaporized.

"I did say the two of us were telepaths, weren\'t we?  That was how we found
Brian in time.  He was literally on his next-to-last breath when we dug him
out and
got him some medical help.  He was eventually put back together, but he was
on
the critical list for a long time afterward."  She looks grim.  "And if he
had died 
there, Sherman would not have murdered him later, but that\'s a different
story."
  
"We brought the scoutship down from orbit and helped with relief
operations (it was the least we could do, after all).  Everyone in the city,
including us, was in such a state of shock, that no one noticed for days 
that we were flying around in an air/raft brightly painted with the 
"Fourteen Worlds Scout Service" logo! (Remember, we\'re in the
capital city of our main enemy nation, which has just blown up)
 We eventually noticed, went "ohmygod!" and carefully draped a
 couple of army blankets over the logo.  Somebody always remained
 with the air/raft to make sure the blankets didn\'t slip...

"And that, my friend, is the true story of how the capital of
the Nebular Planetary Confederation was blown up."

A postscrypt: Dennis Matheson, our Traveller Referee, told us that
he recounted the story of this incident to Mark Miller at a con once.
I hear that Mark was suitably appalled....

I did something in between - I took the near-star-list and generated some
starmaps from it by offsetting the "home planet". I put some of this into
HTML and use it as my background game. If you\'re interested, the page is
at http://www.missouri.edu/~ccjoe/traveller/3d/

John\'s absolutely right - this radically changes the way you look at
travel and the traveller game itself. If you want 3D, pitch the starmaps
you have for the Imperium out the window. And it takes just a second or
three more than forever to develop. 

The biggest problem I had was developing some way to show the relationships 
between locations. I finally resorted to making 3D maps in SAS (yes, if you
know what SAS is, shudder) and then taking the image and "drawing" over
it in another program. I kept the nearby star data in my FTP site as
well if anyone wants that for a looksie.

Yes (sort of): there was an article in Challange (during the MegaT era)

 Yes, that\'s actually pretty good - I don\'t remember starport
 ratings that well, so that G might be an H, if you asked me, but
 here\'s the breakdown of the rest.  Note that the figures in
 parentheses are the _actual_ figures, where appropriate

 Size           8 - about 12500km diameter, or 8000 mi (7,927 mi)
 Atmosphere     6 - standard.  In a pessimistic moment, I might say
                        7, standard-tainted
 Hydrosphere    7 - 70% of surface covered with water (~75%)
 Population     9 - 10^9 (billions) of people.  (4 billion plus)
 Government     7 - Balkanized.  Definitely.
 Law Level      5 - Hard to say; it varies a lot.
 Tech level     8 - This is sort of how tech level was defined.  If
                        you were to look at a detailed tech
                        profile, as per the World Builder\'s
                        Handbook, you might see some 9\'s in there,
                        and it\'s distinctly possible that the
                        novelty tech level might even be A.  But at
                        the same time, there are areas that would
                        have trouble sustaining TL4 or 5.

Gawd..I have nothing so good to offer, just my maid-killer story.
 
I had recently retired from the scouts, and had hooked up with this 
bunch trying to appear legit...honest, we\'re just a bunch of free 
traders, honest.  We had to be real careful at customs searches...the 
unregistered nuke in the hidden compartment of the ships locker would 
have gotten us in a world of hurt. But, what they hey...the original 
owners didn\'t need it anymore!

ROTFLMHO!

Gawd..I have nothing so good to offer, just my maid-killer story.
 
	I had recently retired from the scouts, and had hooked up with this 
bunch trying to appear legit...honest, we\'re just a bunch of free 
traders, honest.  We had to be real careful at customs searches...the 
unregistered nuke in the hidden compartment of the ships locker would 
have gotten us in a world of hurt. But, what they hey...the original 
owners didn\'t need it anymore!

	We had found a contact, a relatively well-to-do winery owner had 
offered us a lucrative contract to deliver wine to a certain planet.  
Unfortunately, he had competitors in the Corleone mold...they tried 
to wreck our ship (most of this happened before I joined the group).

	They failed, and the shipment got through, and the payment got the 
winery owner through a cash-flow problem that his competition had 
helped contrive.  So they tried more direct methods...they kidnapped 
his daughter.

	He begged us to rescue her (this is where I came in), and promised 
some exclusive distribution of his stuff elsewhere in the subsector.  
This was really nice, as his wine was actually very good...we would 
make a bundle, which was nice...we were three payments behind on the 
free trader.

	We drifted in to the roof of the mansion where the daughter was 
being held in our stealthed air-raft. The guards were overcome 
without much struggle, since they were not expecting an air attack 
(we\'d spread some reliable sounding disinformation) and we dropped in 
through a skylight to the top floor. We had to get down to the first 
floor of the mansion to where the girl was being held. We\'re dressed 
in black, skulking along with our weapons, when someone came 
out of a door ahead of us.  Maybe I was wired a little too tight, 
because I opened fire with my smg (unsilenced, of course)

\'Congratulations, Jethro (my name), you blew away the maid! Thanks, 
she was so heavily armed with that vaccuum cleaner!\'

Then, of course the rest of the guards, who were NOT heavily armed 
with vaccum cleaners, but things like pistols and smg\'s and grenades, 
came boiling up the stairs gunning for us.

Everyone was hit, but we finally did manage to fight our way down 
to the floor with the girl, get her out (she wasn\'t 
hit...fortunately) and made it back to the top floor and our escape)

I never lived that one down...the rest of the party forbade me from 
carrying weapons at all, ever, and nearly left me on the planet.  The 
only reason the let me leave was that I was the best air raft pilot, 
and, thanks to me, they knew we were there and almost got us with 
their small arms fire as we split.

This was one of the good points about DGP\'s World Builder\'s Handbook. Even if 
you didn\'t like the rules for determining the physical characteristics of a 
planet, the section for generating the cultural details of a world was really 
good. The legal profile split the law level into five sub categories, weapons, 
trade, criminal law, civil law and personal freedom, each generated 
individually in the same way as the overall law level.
Whatever happened to DGP? GDW is producing much more material for Traveller:NE 
than it ever did for MT, but it was still better when several different 
publishers contributed.

That seems to assume that the only valuable resources you find are habitable 
worlds with hard to extract natural resources. A long range expedition would 
look for other benefits, like:
- Data on uncontacted sentient races
- Technology exchange with advanced races
- Samples of valuable lifeforms, eg. A small shrub which emits natural 
antibodies which immunise humans against a disease.
The value of information alone would make the expedition worthwhile. 

Shouldn\'t that expedition be coming home soon? Could make for an interesting 
starting adventure (as if we haven\'t had enough all ready).

There might even be other reasons why the Solomani and others have no desire to 
expand - mysterious ship disappearances on the frontier, outposts on frontier 
worlds found mysteriously deserted...

Assuming for purposes of argument that the Aslans got settled in the first
place (a very iffy proposition as you noted), the most likely agreement
between the Regency and the Aslan clans are that the clan heads released
their _ihatei_ from their oaths of fealthy and the _ihatei_ swore allegiance

  My understanding is that they got tired of being dependent on GDW for 
the direction of Traveller and not being in full control of their 
destiny.  You may have seen the ads for the game A.I. in the last couple 
of issues of MegaTraveller Journal - that was the central part of the 
plan to break away and have an independent product line.  That game was 
never released, and the firm folded (too bad, as far as I\'m concerned).

  I understand something may be happening with A.I. in the near future, 
but due to a release I signed I can\'t say more, so don\'t ask me - others 
may know more, though.

 You\'re not the only one who thinks that; apparently someone at the
 old DGP did, as well.  Look at the extended procedure for Legal
 Profile; it allows for specifying the law level in Weapons, Trade,
 Personal Freedom, and a couple of other things as well.

 I\'ve always treated the basic law level as the likelihood that the
 PCs would have an encounter with the legal system.

The reason why the Zhodani didn\'t invade is the same reason why they haven\'t
resumed expansion in 2000 years. Unfortunately, I\'ve been unable to imagine
just why they haven\'t done that (I suspect MASSIVE internal unrest due to
failure to integrate systems (but for 2000 years...?) or some large
belligerent on the other side of the Consulate (though why we\'ve never
heard of that...?)). 

One possibility is a policy decision not to expand (Indeed, the halt in
expansion 2000 years earlier was the result of just such a descision: to
stop until the worlds already acquired had been integrated into the
Consulate. The enigma is why it has taken 2000 years to do so). The fact 
that it may not be the most logical descision from a wargamers point of 
view is not an inconsistency: there are plenty of historical examples of 
politicians doing things that were less than optimal. One possibility:
The electorate did not want to pay for the cost of invading the Domain.
Never mind that it would be cheaper to do in 1120 than later; later might
not ever come. And if it did, it would be someone else who had to pay.

I think you\'ve hit the nail on the head here Hans. The initial decision
to \'wait awhile\' has evolved into \'wait idefinitely\'. \'Politics\' could
easily explain this; an isolationist turn to Zhodani society a la the
First Imperium, unwillingness to finance new expansion or even the idea 
that "whew, integrating all the worlds we\'ve gotten so far turned out to 
be alot more trouble than we bargained for, let\'s wait awhile before we 
try THAT again". Of course they also could\'ve just turned their attention 
elsewhere. Just look at all the undeveloped worlds in the old Imperium. 
Maybe the Zho\'s want to fully develope what they already have before they 
take anymore.

ASTROGRAPHIC NOTES: 

Borlund is in orbit 1 around the primary star Crotiv.  That half-dead 
star, Idanoll, is in orbit 5.  Borlund does have a trivial satilite 
barely worthy of being called a moon (Symot: YS00000-0), about 115,200 
km from Borlund.

Because of the placement of Idanoll, there is a real, black Night for 
only half the year.  For other half of the year, there is this dim red 
glow instead, brighter than Earth\'s moon, but nowhere near Sol, or 
Crotiv.  The shadows and other light-effects of these two star can be 
quite pretty.

****************

INTRODUCTION:

Borlund is on the edge of the coreward border of the Regency, and 
directly faces Virus.  However, RQS security at the recently established 
RQS base is only \'average\': no Virus ship has crossed the boundary in 
over 20 years, and the subsector is rather on the low-tech, 
low-importance side.  Indeed, considering the low esteem that Borlund is 
held througout Deneb, some people feel that it would be no great loss if 
security on Borlund slipped up one day: others say that the 
Borlundlanders wouldn\'t even notice if Virus DID take over...
 
As you arrive at Founder\'s Harbour, you are rather shocked by the 
extemely small port, the only one on Borlund.  It\'s barely enough to hold 
5000 disp of ship\'s (This, in a world of 200 billion people!)  

As you look around, you note that just about everyone resembles everyone 
else: not clones, but almost.  Also, just about everyone seems to be a 
cripple of some kind or another: some suffer from mental handicappes, 
others from physical ones, and still others suffer some hideous 
combination of both.  

[REFEREE: For people and startravellers who probably have *never* 
          seen a handicapped person in their entire lives, Borlund is 
          extremely repulsive and alien.  Most traders absolutely will not 
          visit Borlund, for this reason as well as the very thin abount of 
          trade available.

          When generating Borlundlanders, remember to deduct 3 points of 
          every attribute, to model the effects of extensive inbreeding.]

Everyone seems to avoid you, except a very few "Customs" personnel: they 
treat you more like Aliens from Outer Space, but seem a lot more smarter 
and intact than their brothers - even if they insist on wearing bulky TL 9 
space suits, complete with oxygen backpack and bubble helmet, tinted 
coal black.

Almost all traders to Borlund are chartered by the Borlund government, 
carring specific freight: speculating on cargo is vigourously discouraged 
on Borlund, as the government wished to discourage as many visitors and 
traders from coming to Borlund as possible.  The visitor\'s - when they 
can resist gawking at the natives, who will be openly gawking at them - 
will have a very difficult time finding room and board.  They will also 
have severe communication problems: the Bourlundlanders have developed 
their own language over the centuries [Called "Words", it only contains 300 
words], which has no relation with Anglic at all.  Still, it\'s possible 
that they may come across someone whose handicapped only in the body, 
not the mind. Such people speak a convoluted, difficult-to-decipher form 
of Old Anglic.

There is very little for the adventure to do in this overcrowded 
asylum: the world is dirt poor, and - after a while - the 
entertainment/shock value of so many handicapped folk wears off.  There 
is precious little to be traded: Borlund\'s entire industrial product is 
used simply to maintain the current standard of living.  Moreover, the 
starport is on an island, hundreds of kilometers from the mainland: the 
only connection is by zepplin transit.

For the sociologist, however, there are interesting - if subtle - jewels 
to discover about Borlund.  Most obviously, how can such a group of 
the blind, the insane, and the lame keep a TL 9 society going?  What 
disaster happened that shaped Borlund to what it is today?

*********************

APPEARANCE:

The Borlundlander\'s dress actually most closely resembles that worn by 
ancient Greek actors.  The men prefer sandals, long to mid-thigh togas (in 
white or a cream colour), with simple bronze masks over their faces 
(with maybe a few bumps and lines).  The women, in contrast, prefer 
wooden masks with metal highlights, and two-piece, brightly coloured 
tunic/dress outfits.  The upper-class women also wear long white gloves 
and a cloak/hood combo. These masks are never taken off in public, or 
before strangers.

The more senior members of the Cult of the Bird dress rather 
differently.  They prefer feathered dress - imitating some mythical Bird 
of Paridise, or perhaps something more simple like a Raven.  The more 
noticeable aspect of them is their biomasks.  Imported from Starn (Inar: 
Deneb/1417 B000996-F), 11 parsecs away, these masks cover the entire 
head, and can easily display emotions, lifelike reaction, etc. since they 
*are* alive.  While their manufactors recommend that they be removed one 
day out of five, the Borlundlanders prefer to leave it on, permitting ti 
to bond inseperatably to their head.

Remembering that most Borlundlanders are suffering from some genetic 
malady or other, canes and wheelchairs are quite popular, ranging from 
simple metal versions to ornate, powered ones.  Everyone is quite 
dependent on designated \'helpers\', usually people with only mild (or, 
very rarely, no) handicapps.  These helpers are usually known by the Red 
Cross symbol they wear on apron\'s.  

The Customs personnel met at Founder\'s Harbour are among the most elite 
available to Borlund, with a minimum UPP attribute rating of 5 (Rather than 
the average of 3).  Dressed in 60\'s style shiny space suits, they are 
rather better equipped than that: their suit has an armour rating of 1, 
and all carry a pistol in their hoster (easily assessible, but hidden 
from casual view).  Outside of duty, they dress noemally, but keep their 
bubble helmets on.

**********************

XENOPHOBIA

While Borlundlanders are xenophobes, they\'re not very agressive about 
it.  They prefer to avoid strangers when possible, and many refuse to 
talk to them.  Violence might occur if the strangers are precieved as 
threats, with unprediticable results.

[REFEREE: Because many Borlundlanders are incapable of complex thought 
          doesn\'t mean noone can outwit foreginers: punish travellers who 
          act in a consistently stupid fashion.  Some Borlundlanders can 
          think quite well, thank you: and even the dumb ones 
          will eventually learn how to hit back, if given time... ]

***********************

INDISPENSIBLE TOOLS

Borlundlander society is able to function thanks to a number of tools 
that they have siezed on.  Almost all managers, supervisiors and other 
important personnel carry small computers (AI or Expert Systems), either 
wrist sized or \'tricoder\' sized. These well-written programs provide much 
needed support and guidance in operating equipment, complex calculations, etc. 

Also, Borlund is probably the only world where robots are still in common 
use (although biogennered monkeys and other \'organic robots\' are slowly
replacing them).  True, almost all of these robots are at TL 9, and thus 
expensive and slow.  Still, without them, much of Borlundland society 
would be simply impossible.

*********************

RELIGION

In Ancient Times (See note), the major religion was a form of Ancestor 
Worship of the original Founders, especially the people whom the 
population is cloned after.  However, from about 830 the Cult of the 
Bird - one of the Servani Cults - grew roots on Borlund: by the Rebellon 
Period, the Cult had become the dominant religion on Borlund.

Unfortunately, the Cult - despite it\'s off-world origions - is quite 
xenophobic.  Moreover, it\'s love of power, bizzare doctrines, mysticisim, 
and basic cruelty has definitely hindered any cultural or technological 
renaissance of Borlund.  Especially awful is their cosmology: their very 
bizzare theories about space travel, the Imperium/Regency, and spaceships 
has set back local knowledge of the heavens to the level of mere astrology.
They\'re endless droning and recitations of supposedly magical words is 
quite annoying when in their company. (The phase "Wise and Cruel was the 
Bird.  Wise and Cruel are the Sons of the Bird." is instantly 
recognizable across the Regency) 

The Cult may loathe and dread off-worlders (called Demons by them), but 
they love starships, and anything else that can fly for that matter.  
Thus their continual demand for Bird biomasks - despite the exorborant 
prices.  They will also pay serious prices for anything with wings and 
feathers.

This love of flight - and more than a little of the Cult\'s ignorance and 
supersitions - also influences the upper classes (well "Upper Classes" 
is a relative term: they\'re generally not the despised "inbred, moronic, 
chucklehead cripples" that most Denebi would call them, but they wouldn\'t  
have gotten past an entry-level position in most societies, either).
The most wealthy individuals of Borlund generally travel to some 
high-tech world to have their legs amputated, and replaced with a 
grav unit.   Almost everyone dreams of buying a Zepplin, the most common 
form of long-distance transit on Borlund.  Even hot-air ballons are more 
valued than the (extremely sturdy) cars that are available.

[REFEREE: \'Ancient Times\'. For Borlund, this is pre-Doom, dated at 757.  The 
Borlund dating system starts from 758 (the first year, post-Doom): 1200 is 
PD 547 (Post-Doom 547)]

*********************

HISTORY

The Founders - who arrived here from Corridor in 151 - were originally a 
well financed group of several thousand colonists, led by about 30 wealthy 
men.  As they grew old - and the rapidly growing colony needed more 
manpower than either immigration or normal population growth could 
provide - these folk chose to solve the problem by generating hundreds of 
male and female clones of themselves offworld, and shipping 
them over to Borlund (solving both the manpower shortage and satisifying 
their infinite egos).

By the 230\'s, over 80% of the resident population of 80,000 people were 
clones of the 30 colony leaders. As the non-clones swiftly fell in social 
status and wealth, the Truechildren - the clone\'s name for themselves - 
grew to dominate the economy and culture, of only of Borlund, but of the 
entire subsector. (Borlund was named the subsector capital in 302: the 
subsector was also renamed Borlund at the same time)

At the system\'s height - at about 700...

(UWP at the time: 
Borlund       Borlund:Deneb/1406  B454999-C   N Hi Cp     101  Im K8V M9V)

...Borlund was the dominant financial centre for Pretoria, Borlund and 
Antra subsectors.  Borlund was also noted for it\'s famed "Table Towns" 
(actually looking closer to mushrooms, to this scout\'s eyes).  Basically, 
a Table Town was a 500m diameter plate suspended on a squat, 100m 
diameter base.  On the plate you could put a small town, a landing field, 
or most any reasonably-sized building.  The ruins of these Table Towns can 
still be seen, quietly disintergrating as the locals no longer have the 
tech to maintain them.

Borlund\'s proudest achievement was in protecting it\'s ecosphere: it\'s easy 
mixture of high civilization and African-veldt feel was unique in the 
subsector, and one of the ways that made Deneb Sector *Deneb*.  Now even 
that\'s gone: the immense increase of the population, couples with bouts 
of large-scale starvation during the late 700s finished the old plains 
forever.

Borlund started to fall apart at 721, when the upper clases started to 
take wives and sired children by normal means, rather than by clone 
tanks or by implanting cloned eggs.  The regular folk, quite envious of 
this upper-class privelege, insisted that they should be allowed to have 
"Traditional" children too.  The upper classes, supported by the 
government, said no: to have normal children between such 
closely-related parents took careful, very expensive, DNA level therapy and 
the government couldn\'t afford to provide this service to the entire 
population.  Moreover, they didn\'t want to pay either the financial or 
social costs such a widespread change would cause (from at least 
temporary surge in unemployment to changing a host of laws to the need 
to import lots of very expensive equipment from the other side of the Claw.)

Class acrimony and strife became rampant.  In protest, many started to 
illegally remove their contraceptive implants, and bear large numbers of 
children in defiance of widely despised laws.  Large numbers of the more 
well-to-do middle class learned to view their government as unjust 
and oppressive, and left, taking their skills and money with them.  Still 
others shouted about "Reproductive rights",a nd began a series of 
confrontations with the governemnt, eventually growing more and more violent.

The end came suddenly, when in 757 a ship\'s boat from the  S.S. Bride of the 
Stars - charted by covert terrorists - crashed into Desomi City, 
detonating the 20MT nuclear warhead in it\'s hold.  With the capital gone, 
the government collapsed, replaced by a pro-birth revolutionary council.  
The population soared as everyone imitrated the large families of the 
elite.  Since so many were clones - and thus too closely related to have 
genetically normal kids - the population soon became dominated by physically 
and mentally handicapped people.

Borlund\'s economy - and the economy of the entire subsector - soon 
started to sink like a stone, as the cost of caring for/adjusting to 
these people grew expotentially.  The situation became so bad that the 
Sector Duke petitioned - and recieved - a massive amount of Imperial Aid 
in the early 800s to deal with "the Borlund Problem".  The Imperium soon 
had to struggle against mass chaos, starvation, and sudden epidemics.  
The Imperium managed to restore some sense of order by the 820s, and even 
brought back the Tech level to 11.  

[NOTE: Because of Borlund\'s lack of genetic diversity, the system had always 
been probe to epidemics, but the chaotic situation made things a good 
deal worse.]

When the new Sector Duchess ascended to office in 828, however, one of 
her first acts was to cut Imperial involvement in the Borlund Sinkhole.
She further signalled the Imperial abandonment of Borlund by shifting 
both the subsector capital and the subsector name to Lamas. 

Borlund simply could not afford to maintain a TL B standing: a major 
depression fell on the world as soon as the last Imperial Relief 
Freighter left, and the patched together coalition the Imperials left to 
rule the world quickly collapsed in savage infighting.  After the Weeping 
War ground on for a decade (providing some of the most shocking war 
footage in Deneb Sector history), decisive battles were won by the 
Brandon fraction, and they finally secured overall supremacy in 839.

The Brandoni were basically a cultural group who managed to create a 
working alliance between it\'s physically and it\'s mentally handicapped 
fractions, successfuly using each group\'s strengths to cover the other\'s 
weakness.  To their lasting credit, they managed to intergrate AI, expert 
systems and old, abused robots to rebuild some sembelance of a real 
civilization.  As a culture, they eventually faded away, but they\'re 
achievements remain the basis of current Borlund civilization.

However, from about the Fourth Frontier War period to now, the 
Borlundlanders have turned away from contact from the outer world, which 
is quite hostile to them.  Borlund endures, but does not grow.

I\'ve been intrigued for awhile with the concept of slaved weapons (i.
e. auxiliary weapons that track simultaneously with the main weapon 
of a vehicle) for Traveller.  I had the notion last night of putting 
slaved weapons out on their own -- giving them contra-grav and 
thrusters and making them into truly autonomous pieces of combat 
hardware.  Using FF&S, I got the concept hammered into something 
useful, but I lack any rules on making these things into robots -- 
from what I\'ve picked up, all of that information is in Vampire 
Fleets.

If anyone here could help me finish this as a robot, please help.  
Below I\'ve listed the design as it stands currently.  Any comments 
are welcome.

Susp: G            HS: 4   
Deck: 4             HR: 4 
	          Belly: 4

Weapon Values
Type            	ROF	Range	DamVal		PenVal

and ems rf		2000	60 meters)
(sefop)			4000

Again, any help with putting some brains into this thing would be 
appreciated tremendously, as I haven\'t any access to Vampire Fleets 
(and won\'t for many paychecks to come).  Thanks alot,

there.  The only thing I was wondering about was the references to 
extensive cloning.  I had always had the impression that there was a 
widespread prejudice against cloning within the Imperium - witness the 
use of the term "truedaughter" with reference to Noris\'s "child.

  I suppose that one might argue that this planet is the reason for the 
prejudice - the history makes it sound like it was a real disaster when 
the prols started breeding - but it may be more likely that this was a 
group that moved to this planet to escape the hostile attitudes toward 
clones.  In any case, I think you might want to address this point in 
some fashion in your paper.

  Again, thanks - a most interesting read.

(or it could just be my impression) that the Zho\'s had stabilised their borders because they were 
unable to expand them further.  I had always assumed this to be the case as the Zho\'s had/have
a rigid, centrally controlled government (no decisions made until OK\'d from above).  This form of
govt is especially limited in the Traveller universe due to commo times etc. OTOH the Imperium
always maintained a loose, decentralised approach to goverment thus allowing greater ease of
expansion etc. 

>From this perspective, the puny forces sent towards the Imperial border during the FWs could be
seen as deliberate warnings to the Imperium to limit further Imperial expansion in the border 
sectors.  These "border incidents" would severely decrease the economic rewards of continued 
settlement in the area for the Imperials but don\'t necessarly indicate an expansionist  urge for
the Zho\'s.  In fact this also explains why the Zho\'s never capitalised on any successes they had
always being content to trade a few border planets for peace  with the Imperium.

  It sounds like a great idea. I have been annoyed with the lack of detail
on RC worlds for some time. I would be happy to do a paper on Trybec - I
have already done some data on it which I could expand upon. I am a bit
busy for the next couple of weeks though, so it would only be ready after
that time.

     Well, it finally arrived.  I about burst a blood vessel on Friday when 
     I got a little package from GDW containing none other than...THE 
     REGENCY SOURCEBOOK.  I was almost afraid to open it, lest I realize my 
     greatest fears that it isn\'t up to par.
     
     Thankfully, this was not the case.  I\'ve read through about 75 percent 
     of the book so far, and I must say that I\'m fairly impressed.  Nilsen 
     committed to a multiple-volume series in the introduction, a la the 
     RCES campaign books.  So we should be seeing a Regency Equipment 
     Guide, Regency Personalities, Character Generation Rules, etc.  To be 
     fair, I think that Nilsen is correct that you can only do so much with 
     96 pages, but I think he has crammed in the information that most of 
     us wanted.  Namely, the modified sector data for the Spinward Marches, 
     Deneb, coreward Trojan Reaches and coreward-spinward Reft Sector.
     
     The RQS description was very nice.  It gave me a very good feel for 
     how the Quarantine Service operates and keeps virus in check.  I look 
     forward to character generation rules for RQS careers.
     
     I refuse to be specific as I don\'t want to ruin anything for Traveller 
     referees who want to keep one up on their players, but I will say that 
     many of the questions about the Zhodani are at least in part satisfied 
     by the RSB.  At least we know there _is_ a reason that the Zhos did 
     not invade and crush the Regency during the last 70 years.
     
     There is also preliminary information about the upcoming "Oklahoma 
     Land Purchase" rush, Regency Style.  Due to a stagnating economy, the 
     Regency has cleared the way for expansion into the wilds.  Watch out, 
     RCES!!!
     
     Suitable sections also describe the Aslan, Vargr, Darrians, Sword 
     Worlds, Droyne/Chirper, Federation of Arden and Old/New Islands 
     subcultures of the Regency.  Nice write-ups were also provided for the 
     psionic subculture and the nobility.
     
     There\'s a very nice illustration of an age-accelerated Archduke 
     Norris, who is dead long before 1202 by the way, but I daresay it 
     looks like a well-done computer-modified version of one of the 
     illustrations from one of the old DGP books.
     
     The description of the new Regent is also good and fairly 
     prophetically sets up the quest for a new Imperium.  I think we can 
     all read the writing on the wall about where this is headed.
     
     The 45 subsectors in the book are very well written up in the RCES 
     style.  That is, no xboat lanes (there is a good explanation for why 
     these no longer exist) and the maps are wrapped by important system 
     information.  I was pleased to discover that most of our RICE papers 
     for the most part, will fit in nicely with what GDW wrote up.  
     (Although they trashed my physiological description of the Gl\'lu on 
     Kubishush; I suppose I should issue an update!).
     
     The one thing that _did_ change greatly are tech levels and population 
     levels.  _Dozens_ of worlds were greatly enhanced over the past 70 
     years.  Vincennes is listed as an imminent TL-17 society.  Efate has 
     reached TL-15, Mora (TL-16), and many more.
     
     There are some very nice ship designs in the back, including the TL-16 
     Darrian patrol cruiser and the Aslan Quarantine Cutter.
     
     One of the most pleasing announcements in the book is that TNS reports 
     will be returning to the pages of Challenge magazine.  HOORAY!!!
     
     I guess if I had any complaints, it\'d be the few silly humorous items 
     added in by Mr. Nilsen that we can probably call "Davisms."  They\'re 
     not on par with some of the more ridiculous Ithklur items (e.g., San 
     Klaas; argh!), but they\'re borderline.  I think I can forgive him his 
     urge to throw in a little humor in a few select spots considering a 
     job well done for the most part.  Actually, I have to admit, a few of 
     his Aslan and nobility quips made me laugh out loud.
     
     All in all, I couldn\'t be more pleased.  Though now I suppose I\'m 
     going to have to frantically wait once again for the inevitably 
     delayed and double-delayed sequels to the RSB.  For now, however, at 
     least we have a good primer to get things going in the Regency.

     I think the population level B, which we would naturally extrapolate

     makers of Deneb Sector.  It\'s always defied reality that such a 
     scenario could occur.  The Regency Sourcebook seems to bear me out on 
     this since it appears GDW\'s changed all "B-level" populations to more 
     realistic "A"s.
     
     I remember when I decided to run a Regency campaign that the first 
     thing I did was look up the stats of Deneb itself.  When I saw the 
     level-B population with the "1" modifier, indicating 100 billion 
     inhabitants, I decided it must\'ve been an error on the part of the 
     statistician and determined that Deneb had only 10 billion inhabitants 
     instead.  I\'m happy to see that GDW has put a more realistic spin on 
     this by fixing these stats.

Then there is a group that is in the middle.
There are some good reasions for the reluctance for the absorbance of

1) a Military take over even if successful would entail now dealing with
a Lot A WHOLE LOT of very uncoperative worlds and their peoples, most of
whom would fight to practically the last Sophant!

2) The cost in money and to the econimy would be incredible.

3) They seem to have run into a problem, that is taxing their military
already.

4) ( and this is conjecture on my part and I will probably make it a part

I mentioned it as an idea to explain the lack of expansion of the Zho, Solomani 
and others. There is no mention of this officially in Traveller, but since GDW 
is never likely to detail the fringes beyond the Imperium, it would be a good 
way to run some dramatic adventures where players can have a major impact, 
without any danger of contradicting the official storyline.

I\'ve always had a soft spot for the Balduris, so I\'ll give detailing
the Baldur system a try. If there are any Chemists on the list, criticism
of my attempts at a Fluid ocean and an exotic atmosphere would be appreciated.

At the moment I\'m thinking of having a high percentage of Chlorine in the 
atmosphere, weather processes (lightning) giving rise to some HCL, though in
small, dilute amounts. The ocean will have quite a chlorine taint, and sulphur
from underwater volcanoes and vents, but be composed largely of H2O.

Well, you *won\'t* have a high percentage of chlorine for long. It
reacts with oxygen, and with *water*. The chlorine oxide is rather
reactive. The "chlorine water" is a "solvent" on a par with aqua regia!
(it\'s the chlorine released by mixing HCl and HNO3 that makes aqua
regia so corrosive). 

So among other things, if there\'s enough chlorine around for it to
exist as more than a trace atmospheric component, it will have a
*major* effect on the planet. For one thing, many sorts of rock won\'t
exist. Silicates will be moderately attacked. Carbonates (limestone
etc) will not exist, as they\'ll be too soluble. Figure that silicate
rocks will be about as stable as carbonate rocks are on earth (ie,
badly honeycombed by water channels, and very eroded unless protected
from groundwater). To give you an idea, gold and platinum will be

You are going to need a process (almost certainly biological) to keep
putting chlorine *back* into the atmosphere. You are also going to have
to consider the fact that the amount of chlorine required means that
elemental abundances on this world are *not* anything aproaching
normal. How you justify this (and what other elements are more/less
common) will be up to you. I can\'t think of any guidelines to help on
that. 

The "sulfur" from volcanic vents is going to be an interesting problem.
The "black smoker" type vents we find on earth deposit large amounts of
metal sulfides around themselves. With the high anount of chlorine you
need, these may be more soluble. I\'m not sure if the sulfur would
precipitate out, or wind up bound to chlorine. The metals would likely
wind up as chlorides dissolved in the oceans.

The oceans are going to have *huge* amounts of dissolved metal
chlorides. This may be enough to justify dealing with the highly
corrosive (by our standards) atmosphere/hydrosphere. It\'ll be easy to
run seawater through a refinery and get out metals.

Odds are that free *oxygen* will be rare, simply because if the oxygen
wasn\'t locked up in water and rocks, it\'d have displaced the chlorine.
So figure on chlorine replacing oxygen as the "oxidizer" in biological
processes. This means local animals would take in food material
(carbohydrates?) and chlorine, and the result would be carbon
tetrachloride and water. Plants would use sunlight to reverse the
process. 

Animals would *not* have calcium carbonate as the base for their
skeletons, as it\'s just too soluble. Silica would be about right. So
that means that "bone" would be more like a sort of fiberglass (a
composite material of silicon dioxide and some sort of organic binder).
It\'d likely be as strong as our sort of bone, likely *stronger*. This
means you do *not* want to get into an argument with the local
wildlife. Something half your size might be able to teat you into
little pieces. And any "armored" critters (like armadilloes, or other
critters that have "bony" plates as a form of armor) are going to have
to be counted as having *real* armor. 

If the above seems unreasonable, compare the strength of bone with the
strength you\'d expect from some sort of "hi-tech" composite using chalk
and an expoxy resin. Then consider that our fiberglass is as much
waeker than what these critters use as bone as that "chalk/epoxy" mix
is compared to bone (which, btw is stronger than steel).

Oh yeah, one "trick" that "old-timers" may show "greenhorns", is taking
a (plastic) bucket of the local seawater and dropping a chunk of iron
in it. You\'ll be able to *watch* as the iron is exchanged for copper,
silver, gold, etc dissolved in the water. (refs can "duplicate" this by
taking some copper chloride solution and dropping in a nail)

The precipitated metals may be valuable (and look rather pretty), but
the corroded *mess* that is left of the piece of iron should get the
idea across. You *don\'t* take unprotected metal outside. Teflon is the
order of the day.

The book (I have it here) is 96-pages (I would have preferred 128).  
There are no adventures, but it is well-done considering the demands that 
have been placed on it.  The first 34 pages are background, history and 
politics.  The next 42 are the UWP data for all 800+ worlds (both 1117 
and 1202).  There follows 6 pages of "Library Data" and "For the GM 
Only".  The remainder is 9 starship designs, inlcuding RQS cutters, and 
(my personal favorite for "Testosterone-Pilot of the Year") a 10-ton 
ship\'s launch welded to a 10-ton partical accelerator!

The book is interesting, and well worth the read, even if you are an RC 
fan.  There needs to be much, much more, however.  I can\'t see how GDW 
can adequately cover both the RC and the Regency.  Quick, somebody start 
demanding coverage for your favorite Pocket Empire!

Why didn\'t you just work it out from the formulae for the various geometric 
solids that the hull configurations use?

The basic hull form in FF&S is the sphere.
The following formulae allow you to find the SA of a sphere given it\'s 
volume:

Volume of a sphere = (4/3)*pi*r^3  (m^3)

SA of a sphere = 4*pi*r^2  (m^2)

r = (SA/(4*pi))^(1/2) = ((3*Vol)/(4*pi))^(1/3)  (m)

=> SA = 4*pi*((3*Vol)/(4*pi))^(2/3)  (m^2)

The MV rating is for a hull thickness of 1cm. Therefore to get the SA from 
MV you simply multiply by 100*MVM.
FF&S determines FMV by simply multiplying MV by the MVM by the armour 
thickness in cm (this actually produces distorted results, particularly for 
small ships with lots of armour, although the difference for most designs is 
small; perhaps there is a bit extra around airlocks, hatches, turrets etc).

The MVM ratings for the other hull configurations are correct (well correct 
to the nearest decimal point)  for the length ratings given.

The 10*g limitation is BS anyway because the level of protection required

IF you use the 10*g limitation then what happens to your ship when it turns

I\'m glad to see someone propose a workable system for point defense.  I 
have a few questions though.

	When you say the asset is based on diff mod, do you mean that the 
diff mod for overpowering is considered twice, first to determine the asset 
and then as a diff mod for the difficulty of hitting the target?  Even if 
it is only used once, why is it based on this rather than on the computer 
or operator?  This means that a TL 10 PD weapon has as much a chance to 
hit a missile as a TL 15 weapon.  Of course the TL15 gun can fire at 
_more_ missiles, but for a given target it is no more accurate.
	In regard to installing a computer with the PD gun to allow it to 
fire on multiple targets: can I install computers on all my guns to 
allow them to fire at multiple targets other than missiles, like ships?  
If I can, then why don\'t all guns have these computers installed as a 
matter of course?  My point is that I suspect that the gunner\'s 
workstation contains enough computing power to do this, and if it 
doesn\'t then it should.
	I think we have to decide whether point defense can only be 
conducted by specialized systems or whether the rules for multiple 
targeting should apply to all weapons.  I lean toward the latter.  By the 
tech levels we\'re talking about I think that computing power is 
ubiquitous enough that it does not require too much additional hardware 
to fire at multiple targets when the overpowering exists to do so.
	My suggestion is that firing at multiple targets is possible for 
all weapons, but only for targets which are very close, say 10,000km or 
less.  This allows point defense against KKMs but preserves the 
BL rules as written for det-lasers.  Exactly how many different targets 
could be fired upon or at what difficulty, I don\'t know.  That\'s why I\'m 
glad this thread was started. :-)

Answer: those are the stats I gave GDW via Mike Mikesh. They are slightly
different from the stats in my campaign, but I thought they would be more
believable. I sent Mike all of my DM\'s notes, which are really only a
rough draft of Tavonni (where is World Tamers Handbook?? What do you mean,
all the shipping containers are filled with CARDS? Chuck them out and put
in some REAL gaming material!). Even this was 10-15 pages long! I also
sent Mike and Dave Nilsen a rough timeline for Tavonni from 1100-1201.

I want to do a RICE Paper on Tavonni, but I am still stuck for system
stats. The ones I use I rolled from _Scouts_ and _Grand Survey_; does anyone
know how much different the *new* official system is? I may just post the
current stats, and let you folks tell me what is wrong.

Also, no-one has answered my query on sending RICE Papers to this list.
>From GDW\'s standpoint (who want first publishing rights), does this list
constitute "publishing" or is it just mail? Hopefully the latter, as it
doesn\'t purport to be a \'zine - and it is to GDW\'s benefit if list comments

them less headaches if it is submitted for publication).

2.      3D SPACE

A quick and dirty halfway solution is to use Marcus L. Rowland\'s World
Generator program. It creates a fake 3D space, where systems are at different
"heights" in a cubic area of space - but only one exists per vertical axis.
Distances between worlds are available from one of the menu options;
select your starting world, and distances to others are shown in light-years.

This idea has been suggested a number of times to explain the unrealistic 2D
Imperial maps - that is, that the maps are "really" 3D, with systems at
different
"depths". Just don\'t think about this explaination too much and you won\'t see
the holes. Me - I like simplicity, as without something to easily display 3D
space, I can\'t visualise it well enough to understand it and run a campaign.

I used the 1980 (1981 maybe?) film "The Final Countdown" [the one with Kirk 
Douglas as captain of the Nimitz] as the source for a time-travel adventure 
some years ago now. Basically, the PCs were heading for Rhylanor during the 
Fifth Frontier War and due to a jump-space anomaly (translation: they rolled 
a misjump and I wanted to keep them in the area they were in), they 
travelled back in time to the Zhodani assault during the Third Frontier War 
(I think - I don\'t have my notes to hand and it was a few years ago). They 
enjoyed it anyway.

Oh yeah, it would be nice if GDW eventually produces a good hi-tech 
supplement for FF&S. It should focus on articles and items which becomes 
possible at TL\'s 14 to 17 (where Vincennes is rapidly approaching).  
Like shipborne disintergraters, say, or experimental organic starships. 
Perhaps a Challange article?

As far as I can tell, the basic idea of the posted rules is that you
shoot at multiple targets by cycling through FAs.  Why is this different
than dividing the ROF by the number of targets? In any case the range
issue is key if we want the rules to degenerate to the BL case at long
(ie >0) ranges.

The real trick here is crossing angle problems, IMHO.  The traverse of
the weapon to change targets (and to track one) is a key problem.  When
a missile evades within 15,000 km, it can possibly change its angular
position such that it\'s more of A problem than its larger angular size.

I have to admit I lean towards a simpler system, but I did have trouble
reading the post I got.  I am confused by the formulae, any
clarification?

MT=3D[(FAx+DM)/CM]/10

MT=3DMaximum Targets
FAx=3DNumber of Focal Arrays
DM=3DDifficulty Modifier
CM=3DComputer Multiplier

So a TL15 laser clould engage 18 targets, and the number of FAs would
be? I\'m confused :-)

I had been playing with allowing ROFs to be divided down to 5 shots per
target (as per underpowering rules), then having each new target be at
+1 DiffMod (DM).  By installing an MFD for the anti-missile laser can
deal with multiple targets better.  I also played around with +1 DM per
new target, but the DMs add up, target 6 would be at +6DM.  In the
latter case the MFD\'s -DMs can be used separately for each attack.  (in
other words a TL15 MFD aimed laser can shoot at the first 6 targets for
free.  Range in this case is still just sub-zero pulled out of a hat
though.

     The problem with the FF&S design sequence is that it isn\'t exactly in

I\'d put the Mdrive and fuel, or at least 50gturns of fuel in at this
point.  50 gturns is 22.32% of total ship displacement for HEPlaR
drives (0.4464% per gturn).

I would suggest that you keep a separate page for each sub-system the
first times out, then you\'ll have \'em handy as plug-ins for future
designs (MFDs, sensors, etc.).

I also keep track of the powerplant requirement for each subsystem as I
build it... a TL15 weapon that needs 360MW of power needs 60kl of
powerplant to support it.  Then doing plug-ins gets even easier (just in
terms of keeping track of how much space is left as you go).

Overview: In part one, the characters were framed with involvement in the theft 
of a prototype Reformation Coalition starship. Escaping from the shipyard where 
the head of security was involved in framing the characters, the adventure 
opens in some docks on Aubaine.

The characters are wanted by the police, and until the end of this section they 
are likely to be hassled at various points by the police. These first two 
encounters can be added into this section as appropriate.

The safe house.
The characters will require accommodation while they pursue their inquiries 
into the ship theft. Any character who has criminal contacts can arrange 
somewhere to stay. Alternatively, the characters can be approached by a 
stranger after a close escape from a police patrol. The characters will be 
offered \'safe\' accommodation for Cr25 each per night.
\'The place wasn\'t in a part of town you knew, come to that, it wasn\'t even in a 
part of town you knew existed. The building looked like it had been burnt out 
in the past, but plants grew in colourful swathes from the windows, and the 
doors and windows looked new. Still, rebuilding was nothing new to you, and the 
building blended in with those around it well enough\'

After a day or two, the police will set a trap in the building, having either 
been tipped off by the owner in return for a reward, or after the police 
followed and arrested the character\'s contact.
Formidable:Observation - \'As you return to the place you\'re renting nothing 
seems out of place, but in a street that has constantly surprised you, with 
impromptu performances by artists and violent arguments by neighbours, this in 
itself is strange. A man stands by one of the streetlights reading a newsheet, 
you can\'t be sure, but it seems like he\'s watching you.\'
If the players look around before going inside, they will find a police air 
raft at the rear of the house, with a single law enforcement officer. This 
gives the players an opportunity to steal a getaway vehicle and escape. If they 
try to leave on foot then they will encounter the police, just the same as if 
they go inside, but of course, they will have a better chance to escape.
If the players go inside, they will be confronted by the police who are waiting 
inside their apartment. There are 4 more police than characters and allied 
NPCs, and they will attempt to subdue the characters, as the Coalition needs to 
question them.

Law Enforcer Template NPC
Level: Experienced, Combat Assets:Armed Martial Arts (Small Blade), Slug 
Pistol,   Other Assets:Pilot (IF/Grav) 9,  Observation 10, Persuasion 10
Equipment:10mm AutoSnub (1D6 1-4Tranq 5-6HEAP), BW vest (AV1 Chest/Ab), Blade

Police Sweep
Ten police officers are conducting a sweep of the area looking for the players. 
Each character must roll Average:Stealth to slip by. If anyone fails, they get 
past on Impossible:Act Bluff. 
If a successful Forgery (false ID) or Disguise roll has been made earlier, then 
they receive a -1 diff mod for each, or -2 for a critical success (and possibly 
-1 for superb roleplaying if they hadn\'t done either)
This situation could be complicated by the appearance of a drunken acquaintance 
of one of the character\'s.
If the players fail to slip past, they will have to defend themselves against 
the police long enough to escape into the crowd. This will be helped by the 
fact the police are on foot.

Research
Some leads which were mentioned in the previous section might now be followed 
up. 

Difficult:Streetwise or Research (-1 diff level if any character has media 
contacts)
The death of Farlos was investigated for Coalition News Services by a Schalli 
journalist. He was unable to find any witnesses to the death, and schalli who 
were in the area of Farlos\' disappearance remember the weather as stormy, but 
not unusually so. More significantly, none of them actually saw Farlos\' boat in 
the area on the night he disappeared.
Formidable:Research, (average:admin to enable, -1 diff level for a medical 
contact)
There was a survivor from the air raft crash which killed the crew of Farlos\' 
original ship. He was resuscitated at a local hospital, but then disappeared a 
few days later. Staff on duty report that he went to the bathroom and never 
came out. An open window from the room looked out over a side alley.

Formidable:Computer - Remotely access the shipyard computers. From here the 
following information can be obtained if the players ask for it:
-Motion Video or stills of the video which incriminates the characters
-Personnel files for the head of security, showing his arrival on planet on the 
same ship as some of the mercenaries. This is not in itself incriminating, 
other civilians from both Coalition worlds and the wilds arrived on the same 
ship, but it is interesting. 
-Work schedules for the construction of the RCS Dark Century. Average:Admin to 
notice that the chief technician in charge of the project actually left to go 
on holiday shortly before the Dark Century was completed. 
-Account numbers used for paying wages which will assist the players in 
obtaining information from bank computers.

This information is important, so if the characters are not skilled enough with 
computers they will need to locate someone who is. Average:Streetwise to locate 
a cybercafe where an infamous hacker hangs out.
\'The bar is dark, illuminated principally by the rows of vid screens along the 
walls. A wide variety of people sit at the terminals, businessmen in suits, 
mothers with their children pointing to the screen and more. The lighting in 
the room is not unpleasant, the light from the screens being cast through sepia 
coloured filters, creating a warm atmosphere reinforced by the smell of 
steaming cups of sharp but sweet smelling Chakka and fresh baked doughnuts\'
If the players ask the owner of the shop they will be directed to a young woman 
in a business suit sitting in one corner. The lady is Jan Coley, an 
accomplished computer expert, with an amateur interest in computer intrusion 
which nonetheless leaves most full time hackers speechless. She will break into 
the shipyard computers for Cr1000, (Difficult:Bargaining to bring down to 
Cr600, or C300 on exceptional success) and may even suggest retrieving some of 
the above information if the players don\'t think about it. Unfortunately for 
the players, she is unknowingly under investigation by a group of bounty 
hunters, who heard of her reputation, and have been observing her through bugs 
in the cafe terminals to watch for shady dealings. When they realise that she 
may be acting on behalf of the characters, they decide to step in, encouraged 
on the kCr250 reward for the capture of the characters.
Fortunately, the bounty hunters working on Aubaine are far less competent than 
their counterparts in the wilds. The bounty hunters will enter the cafe just as 
Jan finishes retrieving the information the players need. They enter through 
the front door and start firing immediately. The civilians present dive for 
cover and players would be quite justified in fighting back.
There is one more bounty hunter present than the number of players in the 
group.

Bounty Hunter, Experienced, Combat assets:Energy pistol, Unarmed Martial Arts, 
Slug Pistol. Other assets:Observation 10, Tracking 10, Streetwise 10. Armed 
with 10mm AutoSnub-8 (HE), leader carries a TL9 laser pistol. They are wearing 
combat environment suits under casual clothes.

Jan Coley, Experienced, Combat assets:Slug pistol. Other assets:Computer:16, 
Observation:10, Research:10. Carries a gauss pistol (dart)

Cafe owner, Veteran Combat assets:Slug rifle, Unarmed martial arts. Other 
assets: Service:14, Computer:12, Electronics:10. Has a pump action shotgun 
under the counter (slugs)

The police and emergency services will arrive in three minutes. Players gain 
much karma for attending to the wounded civilians until the ambulances arrive 
instead of fleeing straight away. 

Difficult:Computer (-2 diff levels if the players have account number from 
payroll files at the shipyard)
Obtain account information on people that the players suspect of involvement
The head of security has no suspicious payments on file. 
The chief technician had a Cr1,500,000 deposit made about four months ago. A 
large withdrawal was made a few weeks ago to pay for a holiday on a well-known 
resort near the equator on Aubaine. In the past couple of weeks numerous small 
withdrawals have been made in shops on the resort island.

Formidable:Streetwise (-1 diff level if any character has criminal contacts, -1 
diff if anyone has military contacts) - Players trace some of the mercenaries 
who appear in the security camera pictures to a mercenary unit which arrived 
onworld ten years ago. No record of them exists prior to this date. The members 
had obtained one or two minor contracts for various commercial concerns, but 
nine years ago the group split up, and the members obtained a variety of 
civilian jobs, principally in security and law enforcement, but some entered 
more mundane careers as accountants and administrators. No details of the 
mercenary missions they carried out have been released. Recently, the band 
began to reform, hired by a mysterious businessman, who paid in cash.

Impossible:Streetwise (-1 diff level if the Medical research above was done)
The survivor of the air raft crash is now working as a technician for the 
Aubani communications company. He has changed his name, and is living under 
cover. He will not be happy about talking to the characters about the crash, 
and will only reluctantly agree to see them.  He will explain that he is 
fearful for his safety, suspecting someone wants him dead, and telling the 
characters that the air raft crash was no accident. He offers to meet the 
characters in a local park to explain further. When the characters turn up for 
the rendezvous, they will find him sitting on a park bench, staring into space 
in from of him. When the players try to talk to him, they realise that he is 
dead. Any post mortem would reveal he died of poisoning delivered by a fragment 
of ceramic found in his neck, as if it had been shot there. Most likely the 
characters won\'t have the opportunity for any close investigation, and if they 
did, it would not provide any information as to the killer\'s identity.

Whatever else the players find out, the significant pieces of information are 
those relating to the chief technician. The players should decide to 
investigate him. Investigation will determine that he has let the rent lapse on 
his flat, and appears to have moved out to the resort permanently.

Reaching the island is not likely to be easy as the police are hounding the 
players. I\'ll outline four possibilities for reaching the island:

1/Passenger ship
2/Chartered ship
3/Stolen ship
4/Charter flight

Buying the tickets
The tickets will need to be purchased for 1, 2 & 4 above. This could be done by 
a character, suitably disguised (opposing an observation asset of 7). 
Alternatively a trusted contact could do it, but this could cause some problems 
for players - How much do you trust your contact? Does he still blame you for 
the death of X? Can you trust your journalist friend to keep his mouth shut? 
The tickets cost:

Passenger ship Cr200 each
Chartered ship Cr1500 total
Chartered flight Cr2000 total

Security checks
The characters will be checked as they enter the harbour or airport complex. 
Security has been tightened due to the increasing tensions in Coalition space. 
The security still seems friendly rather than intimidating, but there is an 
atmosphere of polite caution. Players attempting to get prohibited weapons 
(automatics and high-energy weapons) through security will be arrested if 
discovered. Players with criminal or merchant contacts can arrange for the 
weapons to be smuggled to the resort. This costs Cr100 to Cr 500 per weapon. 
The chance of it getting through safely is equal to 60% + 5% for each Cr50 over 
the original Cr100. Passengers will be asked to check weapons into secure 
lockers for the duration of their flight/cruise. It is Formidable:Stealth to 
avoid any concealed weapons being found (-1 difficulty level for pistols), or 
it is Difficult:Intrusion to obtain them once on board.

Passenger ship.
\'The ship sits easily in harbour, a faint trail of steam reaching up from one 
end. The hydrofoil underneath the water has a modified HEPlaR drive mounted on 
it, which takes water in from in front of the ship, heating it to steam and 
then venting it behind the ship. The efficiency of the propulsion, combined 
with a fusion plant make it possible to achieve extremely high speeds with very 
little cost. The tourists around you all look excited, they jostle and crowd 
around the boarding gates, and the people who were originally checking people\'s 
papers  give up and get out of the way.\'
The voyage takes about twelve hours, and while the characters will encounter no 
trouble getting off again, it\'s not all plain sailing....
\' "Hey! You!" the shout comes from behind you. Turning, you find yourself face 
to face with a short angry looking man. You recognise him from the briefing as 
one of the would-be officers from the briefing at the shipyard. His shouting is 
beginning to attract the attention of the other passengers around you\'
Lots of Act/Bluff, Persuasion, and clever ideas will be needed to shut him up. 
He will harangue the characters, although he won\'t get violent. If he is 
allowed to get away, then he will call the port authorities
using the ships laser relay. The characters could try to disable the 
communicator, either by taking over the comms room, or by sabotaging the 
antenna. If they don\'t they will be ambushed by the police (see below) as they 
disembark.

Charter Vessel and Flight.
The characters will not be immediately apprehended if they fail to sneak past 
security while boarding, but the police will be waiting at the port/airport 
when the characters arrive, and will try to arrest them (see below). The 
characters may plan to use parachutes or scuba to get past these problems, and 
these are possible, depending on character skills.
To pass through security 
Formidable:Stealth (the corridors are designed to prevent this)
Formidable:Act/Bluff (\'...no, you want my second cousin, he looks just like 
me\')
Difficult:Disguise
Difficult:Forgery 


Stealing a ship.
In the port there is a small HEPlaR propelled water skimmer. A fat man in a 
loud shirt sits on deck, drinking and soaking up the sun. He is a novice NPC 
and has the keys for the yacht in his pocket. The characters can easily 
intimidate him into starting the engine, or piloting the ship. As the 
characters leave the port, they will be pursued by his bodyguard, who has 
borrowed a speedboat to chase them. The characters can outrun him easily if 
they choose to. If they do, they will be reported by the bodyguard, and tracked 
by the police. The police will be waiting for them when they arrive. If 
however, they allow the bodyguard to catch up and they subdue him, then nobody 
will raise the alarm, and the characters will be able to land uninterrupted by 
the police on the island. The bodyguard is an Experienced NPC, armed with a 
gauss pistol and unarmoured.

Police ambush 
If the characters get noticed from travel above, they will be ambushed by a 
group of police in a fitting location (customs, a small harbour, as they get 
out from their grav vehicle and walk across the grasphalt to the terminal 
building). There are twice as many police as there are characters. Use the law 
enforcer template above.

The holiday home. 
The Chief technician (Steffan Gray) \'s house is set in considerable grounds. 
The grounds are surrounded by a wire fence, with surveillance cameras set every 
hundred meters along their length. A narrow road leads from the main road to 
the house.  The grounds are patrolled by trios of security guards, all in 
combat environment suits and carrying TL10 ACRs with HE ammunition. At night 
they use light intensifier goggles, and they have headset radios for 
communication.
Technician\'s security. Experienced NPC. Combat assets: Slug Rifle. Other 
assets:Observation 12, Stealth 10, Tactics 8.
Most of the estate is covered in dense forest, but reaching in a circle about 
50m in radius from the house are landscaped gardens these include four 
spectacular \'holographic\' fountains, where projection onto a spray of opaque 
white liquid gives the impressions of a fountain of fire, of pebbles and rocks, 
of clouds and of water, all four fountains changing theme in rotation. There is 
a second road leading from the house to a private beach. 
Draw maps if you want, or alternatively handle it in a more descriptive 
fashion.

Some suggested complications for various approaches.
Entry through the woods - 
Poisonous wildlife
Dry leaves underfoot attracting guards

Entry through the private beach - 
Wildlife
Toxin laced netting covering the cove. Intended to keep unfriendly wildlife 
outside the swimming area it is laced with a slime containing a contact poison. 
Although intended to discourage small fish only, the sting is uncomfortable, 
and one randomly selected member of the party could suffer an allergic reaction 
to it (fever, halved assets, needs medical attention within an hour).
Rip currents

Entry over the fence (for all but beach approaches)
The wire fence is made of superdense, and requires specialised cutting 
equipment. Digging under the fence could produce an entry, but there is a 30% 
chance of uncovering a small antipersonnel mine. This is primed when the 
unfortunate lays his hand on it, but won\'t go off until he reduces the pressure 
on it. The others can try to disarm it, while the unfortunate who discovered it 
rolls lots of willpower tests to not scratch his nose. Climbing over the fence 
is possible, but the razor wire on the top will do 2D6 damage each limb. 
Easy:Acrobatics to prevent damage to one limb, Average for two limbs, Difficult 
to save three limbs, and Impossible to vault over without damage (roll and see 
which if any task would be successful).
Then there are those video cameras.....

Entry along paths through the woods/along a road
Guard patrols are common, and the players are likely to encounter them.
There are several automated weapons which are deactivated by radio 
transmissions from security tags which the people living in the house use. 
These can be obtained from defeated guards. Using a radio jammer doesn\'t 
deactivate the weapons, but it will cause them to fire indiscriminately.

In the house the players will find copies of the Dark Century\'s blueprints, 
annotated to highlight security weaknesses, ways door locks can be over ridden, 
means of defeating the anti hijack program. They will also find parameters for 
a planned jump to Lancer, with risk assessments for the untested jump drives. 
There is no RC authorisation stamp on any of these documents. There is also 
correspondence from the Head of security who framed the characters, assuring 
Steffan that the characters will be caught and convicted by the police on the 
evidence that he has created. 

The characters hear a sudden roar and see a large flash out through the 
windows. A fusion small arms shot has ignited much of the top floor of the 
house. Steffan will die in the blaze unless a courageous character chooses to 
go up to save him. He will be found severely burnt from a grazing shot, 
unconscious and will have to be dragged from the building. He will remain in a 
coma for several weeks, but will eventually make a full recovery. Unfortunately 
he knows little else about the ship theft, as his involvement was entirely 
through Trefin (who will have disappeared off planet by the time the characters 
reach the authorities with the evidence.
The characters can try to pursue the cloaked gunman responsible, but he will 
have gone by the time they get outside, and they will find him impossible to 
track. They will see a craft take off from the beach and climb up on an orbital 
trajectory. The government tracking agencies will deny having seen anything 
(they really didn\'t, but let the players get paranoid about government cover 
ups).
The police will arrive within a few minutes, and with the evidence gathered, 
the players should be able to prove their innocence. The authorities are able 
to determine the planned path of the Century and a mission to return the ship 
to the Coalition is organised. Naturally, the players are offered command 
positions to chase after the people who framed them....

In CT/MT it was 0.1 ton as I recall.  In TNE it\'s 0.5 ton.

7kl is pretty damn big, by the way.  A TNE standard 7kl missile that is
a cylinder with a diameter of .75m, is 4 meters long!

Regarding "clear" tanks for K\'kree

The only clear glass I have heard of is that stuff which was used for
starship windows in old Traveller. I always assumed the AV to be the
old Striker factor-40, the same as an "unarmoured" hull. This would
be required to stop micro-meteorites.

However, the substance was never detailed. No stats were ever given
for this mythical glass. "Transparent aluminium" doesn\'t exist in
Traveller, sorry.

Even so, this should not present a problem. All that is needed is for
the K\'kree to _feel_ as though they are in open space. I believe that
they must be the Trav masters of holo and olfactory technology, just
as the Hivers are the masters of computer technology. Witness the
K\'kree 3000-ton family starship detailed in Challenge (somewhere in
the late 20\'s or early 30\'s, I think). Inside, the holographic sky
and walls, plus the olfactory central "tree", made the K\'kree feel
as though they were on the plains of their homeworld.

I think that all you need do is:
        1. cover the inside of the thing with holo projectors;
        2. add in some olfactory emitters (_101 Robots_, or does
           _Vampire Fleets_ have something similar?); and
        3. make the inside space larger, according to the original
           _Striker_ (or maybe the K\'kree module) rules: multiply
           human space requirements by 5, or something. K\'kree
           tanks will be BIG.

If a PD is powered so that it can ignore 5 difficulty increases it means 
that it got an asset of 15.

The whole thing comes to calculating where the beam will intercept the 
missile. And this is pure 2D mathematics. And a TL 15 computer will not be 
able to calculate this more precicely than a TL 10, only faster. But that 
won\'t change the rate or accuracy of the weapon.

In a way, yes, but then the play balance will be rubbed. The rule was meant 
to design dedicated PD weapons rather than ordinary laser turrets.

See above.

I would say that there should be dedicated PD weapons, rather than giving 
all types of laser turrets this kind of multiple target resolution. Remember 
that the chance of hitting with a ROF 10 weapon is small as it is. And if 
you are lucky you will hit with 2 of the beams.

Look at the math on the PD weapons I gave. 800 shots times 7 arrays is 5600 
shots. A TL 13 weapon can engage 3 targets, while ignoring 5 DMs. This gives 
1866.67 shots a target. The computer is neccesary for the weapon to act 
indepently from the other systems onboard.

Delete the 3D notions. that and the =20 at the end of each line is the 
product of the software at MPGN.COM. I posted it at the HIWG-list and these 
problems didn\'t arise there.

So a TL 13 PD with a CM of 0.35 and 7 arrays, and can ignore 5 difficulty 
levels can engage:
[(7+5)/0.35]/10 = 4 targets

I hope this helps

Hi all,
	Someone asked about clear armorlike materials for K\'Kree tanks.
Well, assuming the K\'kree would even build such a thing - why not just 
use good holos? But the question remains, especially since for 
instance the Iramda 10-ton fighter has a BIG clear canopy... 
How about the following psuedo-science idea;

Superdense materials make use of monopoles to maintain their high 
density. This normally results in a dense, non-transparent material
with metallic properties. However, for certain alloys of aluminum 
and germanium the opposite is true - when doped with the right
materials, these two become nonconductive and transparent. 
The same is true for certain crystalline structures of carbon...

As for mesons - has anyone calculated exactlt how close to c they
have to be moving in order to stretch their lifetimes be about 
16 orders of magnitude? It\'s very close...
I suggest using Kaons instead... 
Oh, also - the interaction length for a typical uncharged particle 
in normal matter is about 10 cm... Merrick, remember the discussion 
a while back on mesons interacting with nuclei? They do, and they 
do it at a rate that makes it quite impossible to send a beam through 
a planet.

I hope that GDW retools the title "Archduke" to refer to a Sector Duke, 
rather than a Domain Duke.  As a noble fan, I like the title, but suspect 
that there will only be one Domain from now on.  Moreover, it will clear 
up any current confusion due to the fact that Dukes can rule either 
subsectors or sectors.

I have the original post, but what was the max TL?  

Also, what limits TL*50 MJ lasers?  Is it Imperial, Zho, RC?  

I\'m game if we have those answers...

Another designer for the K\'kree!  I guess I\'m not the only one that
likes making these weird designs....

According to the old K\'kree book, tank crews are trained like fighter
crews.  They\'ll have a reasonably high level of Enclosure skill which
represents training to cope with tight spaces.  With typical K\'kree
herd gregariousness, they\'ll probably be a *very* tight outfit, too.

Hyphen (David Jacques-Watson) added:

I put together some standard components based on those rules for my
Xeekr\'kir! (civilian K\'kree merchant) conversion.  You might find 
them useful: 

K\'kree "Accomodations" 
  672 kL; 48 tons; 0.012 MW; MCr 1.
K\'kree Airlocks
  36 kL; 2.4 tons; 0.012 MW; MCr 0.06; 20 square meters.
K\'kree Workstations (TL13)
  168/84 kL; 0.2 tons; MCr 0.002.

Some of these figures can be shrunk down for military crews that 
have Enclosure skill, but I forget the exact figures and what a
typical skill level would be, off-hand.  "Accomodations" refers
to open space used as a stateroom or cargo space, although they
can also have normal "free" cargo space.

Clear domes would be a Bad Thing on a tank.  Can you say "visible
spectrum laser fire"?  :) Something high-tech might be worked out,
but it sounds like more trouble than it\'s worth.

Here\'s where I like being an econ major, I can actually do something
useful with it once in a while!  8)

Quite simply, a TL15 world has no need to create lower TL starships. 
There is enough demand on them to create TL15 ships.  So, as a firm,
they will want to maximize their profits by producing what is being
demanded of them.

Some "earthly" examples.  Automobile factories need to retool to make
different automobiles.  There might be a significant amount of
retooling required to use lower TL materials.

When a society advances beyond a given level of production (they start
to modernize or move into other markets) there are others that are also
moving ahead (just behind them).  For example, most sneakers are now
made in Indonesia, whereas before they were made in Korea, and before
that in Hong Kong.  Both HK and Korea advanced enough technologically
that it wasn\'t cost effective for companies to produce the lower tech
good there anymore.

This is an interesting point, but I think it is pretty complicated.
Take for example a flintlock rifle.  A flintlock that *looks* (and
basically works like) like a flintlock is cheap to make at our TL, but
if it is made the old fashioned way it is *very* expensive (around
$10,000 from a master gunsmith--BTW, the old fashioned way means that
the barrel is hammered into a hollow cylinder, not milled from stock)

But on the other hand the "cheap" version is no cheaper than a bolt
action rifle (or an autoloader for that matter). 

It would be useful, I guess, to figure out what kinds of technologies
would not require a lot of retooling to make lower tech versions at a
reduced cost.

Lasers might fit these criteria.  A higher TL focal array might be able
to be smaller, lighter, and cheaper if it\'s only required to perform at the
lower TLs stats (lowering effective range, basically).

You\'d think that TL15 fusion rockets would have some
mass/cost/performance improvements over the listed TL9 ones, but they
don\'t (even with the new ability to control nuclear forces above TL12 or
so!).  

Materials might be another area... is SD cheaper to make if you can do
BSD now?

It seems to boil down to whether or not the new technology is a
retooling jump, or just an incremental change.  If it\'s the latter, the
old way might be cheaper.

Mr. Pratt, 
I\'ll give your ship design a go.  You\'ll see the results as soon as I can
draw them up.  Those spreadsheets off the ghost page are wonderfull...

And now for something completely the same..

COMMANDER X\'S
TALES FROM THE LINE
VOLUME 2.5
MY PERSONAL COMPUTER RULES
TO ACCOMPANY VOLUME 2
HACKERS, CYBERSECKS..ETC....
(parrot sketch not included)



	The first thing we will discuss are the tools of the trade, the personal
computer.
These things look very much like(asa matter of fact they are) the hand
computers in the TNE rulebook.  I have added stats to this basic handcomp
and added varios tech levels to the basic chart.

And now, the chart...

TL	CPU/Storage	media		INTellegence	
7	   1/5		Magnetic	              3		
8	   5/10		Magnetic	              4		
9	   10/25		Optical Disk	 5		
11	   15/40		Optical Disk	 6
13	   25/50		Holocrystal	 7
15	   35/75		Holocrystal	 8
17	   50/100		Bioneural	              9

(Please note that mainframe computers multiply memory by 10)
So what does all this mean?
the CPU/Storage factor should look familiar to CT fans.  CPU is the amount
of programs(in Memory Units or MU) the computer can run at any one time.
Very much like Ancient Terran RAM chips used to do.  The storage is how much
total MU the computer may store.  Kinda like an Ancient Terran Hard Drive.
media is what kind of storage media is compatiable.  Magnetic Disk, Optical
Disk, or Holographic Datacrystal.
The big number for a computer is its INTellegence. This is a factor of how
fast and how well the computer can process data.  In actual use, it, is the
factor that will set jump co-ords when it uses a jump program, or calculate
the airspeed velocity of a Swallow, African and European!
In game terms, the computers INT works the same as a characters INT. It is
also the computers Initiative value. Where do we ge the asset from?
Programs! (thats why we have the memory stats!)

Standard programs work the same was as skills do. This info is taken right
out of the Robots rules in Vampire Fleets.  The memory cost of a standard
program is equivalent to its skill level or STRength. For example, Physics 1
costs 1 MU, Astrogation 5 costs 5 MU, etc...

That\'s the basic stuff,  now how do we hack things?

 Simple, first you need a computer, then some way to conect into the local
net, a datacable or a radiocom or a cell phone will do.  then you need
HACKING PROGRAMS!

Hacking programs are those programs which, well, hack.  They cost
1.5xSTR(rounded up) MU.  these are used to bash down a data fortress\' walls,
decrypt data, derez ICE, and other Neato Keen ILLEGAL type stuff.

Oh, but before I show you the programs, we need to discuss Tasks.

All computer tasks are considered to be confrontational.
Computer Asset of  Hacker plus (Hackers Program Asset minus NPC Computers Asset)

Example:

To hack thru a codegate is a difficult task
Hacker has 13 Computer Asset, using a computer and a program with a total
asset of  9
The NPC computers codewall asset is a 15
13+(9-15)=13-6=7 (owch!)

Computer combat works the same way
To hit an ICE program is a difficult task confrontational (Computer Asset
+(Attack program-Defence Program)

Dammage is the skill level(not asset) of the program in d6
Hit points of the program is 2xskill level
If your defence program is gone, and the ice attacks, you are automaticaly
kicked out of the net.

Thats the basic facts for nethacking and ICE combat.

Here\'s a little schpiel...

Lets say I have a TL-11 handcomp
Memory=15/40 INT=6
Wallcracker 3   (5mu) for breaking datawals
Decryptor 5      (8mu) for decrypting data
Shield 3             (5mu) defence program
Fireball 3            (5mu) attack program 3d6 dammage

Ok, I enter the Efate-Net. and I search for a bank computer.  As the
holgraphic thingy\'s and whatsits pass by as a cruse arround the net at the
speed of light. (Meson coms are so fast! No data lag!)

Now I\'m at the entrance, the hologram looks like a bank foyer. there is no
security here, just advertisement data floating arround, Ohh, thta codegate
over there looks like where they keep the account files, letts give it a go!
Loading Wallcracker,  Shield, and Fireball programs

Now Efate is TL-15(Got the RSB! ah, ha, ha!) so the computer has an INT of
8.  The codegate program is a strength 10!(wow!) so this is how I stand.
Computer 15+(my program(9)-its program(18))=6
 Roll a d20...a 5! phew! I\'m in.

I look arround for my file, but theres a watchdog program in here with me!
As I don\'t have a stealth program, it autodetects my signal.  as it uses its
intiative of  9 to allert, I\'m gonna fry it with the fireball.
15+(9-10)(watchdog is just a lv 1 program)=14, I roll a 11, 3d6 minimaly
does 3 hp and the dog only has 2 so it de-rezzes!
Quickly I look for my file, the computer is aware of my existance.  Got it,
its protected, as I load the decryptor, the computer summons up a very nasty
looking Samuri program.  It attacks, 18+(18-9)=27. it rolls a 9, the shield
is gone and I\'m kicked out!
Thats how things work normaly.
Now for the abnormal...

Cyberdecks
Cyberdecks are just hand computers with a nueral jack attachment.
They make all tasks one level easier and give a +1 to initiative or speed or
the computer (remember speed=INT).  Also if ICE attacks and you have no
protection, all hits are to the HEAD!

Psionics
Psionics will show you what the computer\'s data looks like, but a hand
computer is still nessecary to manipulate that data.  At level 6 success all
tasks are EASY!

Well, that has to be one of my largest posts yet. If you like the rules,
good. If not, feel free to change, twist, maime or otherwise fit them for
your particular campain.

I hope this will enhance the Trav rules on computers somewhat.

CYA next time.

Some more information on the requirements for the diplomatic ship, since 
there seems to be an actual desire to make it.

The ship will be used by a small group who specialize in first contact 
situations (e.g. with TEDs), arbitration between waring factions, etc.  
The best term for this group would probably be "Freelance 
Diplomats/Negotiatiors."   Hence, the ship will be put into demanding, 
and possibly violent, situations, and, while it will need the ability to be
defensible against a reasonable threat, it also needs to be unarmed 
enough so as not to present a major psychological threat.   It will need 
to be extremely fast and have most of it\'s armament well concealed.   
Basically, its two requisites are that 1) it be able to outrun anything 
it can\'t out fight (remember the about 250 MCr budget and the 40-60 
person crew) 2) it needs to be built for practically any usage (e.g. 
medical ship, scout, troop ship, etc.)   

Remember that this is a diplomatic ship so it will need to be presentable 
(read aesthetically pleasing----possibly along the lines of the interior 
of the USS Enterprise 1701-D, or the alliance ship at the very beginning 
of Star Wars).  
Also: the budget is not fixed, and if there is a very good case for a 300 
MCr ship, it will be considered.   Likewise, if someone designs a more 
than adequate ship for 230 MCr, the pricetag will be weighed as well.

Thanks all for the time and the response to my original post.

N.B. The tech level for the ship will be up to 16, however, if a tech 
level 15 or 14 ship is built with ostensibly the same functions and a 
lower price tag that will be considered.  Likewise for the other 
direction (Im not quite sure how that would happen tho).

rather pleased.  I\'d have to say that it\'s one of the best New Era 
products so far - interesting history, nice subsector maps, and some 
great plot elements for the future.  The stuff about the Zhodani in the 
referee\'s section explains why some of the things discussed on this list 
aren\'t happening, though I must say it\'s getting to be "destroyed 
civilization of the month club" as far as Traveller is concerned.

  One of the things I found nice has already been mentioned on this list 
- the respect for Traveller\'s history.  There are lots of references to 
previous products (many of them footnoted, no less), even a couple I had 
forgotten.  I\'ve been reading Journal of the Traveller\'s Aid Society from 
issue 1, and it was neat to see that that early material is covered.  For 
example, the description of the planet Victoria in Lanth subsector 
follows the world description in JTAS 2.  Since this is still one of my 
favorite worlds (blimps powered by oars!), it was nice to see it.  For 
those of you who came to Traveller too late to buy all that old stuff, 
the RSB will be invaluable.

  My only complaint is about cost.  The sourcebook is only 96 pages, and 
I paid $20 for it.  At the same time, I bought the latest release from 
Pagan Publishing, the Call of Cthulhu campaign Coming Full Circle.  That 
book is also perfectbound with a full color cover, yet is 160 pages long 
and sold for $18.  Seems like GDW is gouging a bit here, and if the 
product wasn\'t as good I\'d be screaming.  As it is, I just have to sigh 
about greed and stuff.

  I got my copy of Challenge 77 in the same package with the sourcebook, 
and I had a chance to read the editorial everyone has been talking about.  I 
think it had some valid points - I am clearly one of those "collector" 
guys who loves Traveller for the history - but I am as offended as others 
have been by the attitude that "GDW Knows Best" and that we should stop 
complaining about the lack of information about alien homeworlds and 
stats.  Frankly, I liked that stuff, not because I ran adventures there, 
but because it gave me a feel for what the culture was like so I could 
run NPCs better.  Given the choice between that and the extremely 
offensive juvenile humor in Sneaks & Geeks, I\'ll take the traditional 
sourcebooks every time.  The defence of the infamous Santa Claus hat was 
just lame, an obvious case of post facto defensiveness about a truely 
awful blunder.

  Anyway, buy the Regency Sourcebook.  It\'s well written, answers some 
questions like "what is Longbow" and "how was Trin raped," and it has 
almost no stupid humor, though the poem on page 10 comes close.  Two 
thumbs up.

  Bet you guys thought I\'d never write a positive review!

Mesons have a half-life, this means that the decay
point for a meson cannot be determined only predicted
(basically this means that a gun will produce a line
of decay particles which can be easily traced).  

To stop this early (and late) decay I propose the use
of a tightly focused meson screen which acts as a
bucket to \'carry\' the mesons to the target.  The screen
then reverses its\' \'polarity\' at the tagert causing 
all the mesons (hopefully) to decay in the target.
Interaction with the defending screan gives the hit or
miss problems and the bucket threory means you don\'t
iradiate your home in the process.

have had with the Gmax*10 minimum value for ship\'s armor.  I agree with 
whoever it was a while back that said that it seemed illogical to have 
this rule, because potential damage from micrometeorites was based on 
speed, rather than acceleration.
	When you look at missiles, they only have an AV of 1-3, based on 
TL, even though they can accelerate at great rates, sometimes as much as 
25g!  This means, to my eye, that they don\'t worry too much about damage 
from anything because they aren\'t designed to last anyway.  But it did 
give me a thought.
	Many missiles nowadays have the skin of the missile an integral 
part of the structure of the craft.  ICBMs and such use a "stressed-skin" 
construction that saves weight, but it does make them somewhat vulnerable 
to damage.  
	What if the AV of 1-3 on missiles doesn\'t represent armor at all, 
but merely the exposed "stressed skin" of the missile, contained as part 
of internal structure?  The variation due to TL could be explained as a 
rounded approximation of the protection afforded by the outside skin of a 
completely unarmored vehicle, using different materials available.
	That does not, of course, answer the question of how low an AV of 
a starship should be allowed to go, but I suggest that some arbitrary 
minimum number should be set.  The lowest I remember in an existing 
design was 10 for a subsidized merchant, and that sounds pretty 
reasonable to me.
	I am, of course, open to comments and suggestions.  Also, does 
anyone have a complete set of rules on developing wet navy ships?  It is 
an irritating oversight from FF&S and I think I missed them, wherever 
they appeared.  Thanks!

In my mind TL advancement is not something that can be actually

alright for the Regency to say that we aren\'t going to buy TL17 ships 
(eg, force standardization).  In my view a business would economically 
justify an investment that would bring about TL17.  This can be 
accomplish during normally equipment retooling.  A present day example 
of this can be seen in many industries.  Consider a service field 
computerizing.  Or the car manufacturer introducing the Anti-Lock brakes 
in next years model.  Finally consider the modern day bicycle 
manufacturers which over the last 10-15 have introduce aluminum and 
carbon-fiber to bicycles with no severe disruption to supply or cost of 
new bicycles.  

To summarize, in my campaign(s) and mind, Vicennes is in the process of 
going to TL17.  This process could take 2-20 years.  This process is also 
happen on other worlds going from any tech level to another.  I guess I 
am just put off by the statist/socialist aproach in the RSB.

Howdy,

Well, I\'ve been making a TL16 Diplomatic Courier (for lack of a better
name).  It\'ll be done my Monday night I\'d say.  How are you other
designers doing?  Mine\'s a hair over budget :-)

It got me thinking.  I did the design as straight FFS, but I also
calulated the CT/MT crew levels (I used the HAIS stuff from gdw-beta,
but didn\'t require any hardware, I just reduced selected crew areas by
25% (I figured that traveller computers have *always* been too big, so
they might as well include all the automation functions on the ship)).

I didn\'t know what the diplomatic staff was, so I have 5 diplomatic
staterooms (large, single occupancy), and room for 8 staffers doubled in
small staterooms.  I threw in 5 troops as well.

I had problems given the desired "crew".  It would be more helpful to
know what the diplomatic staff looks like, actually, because the crew is
predecided by the design.

Other stuff:

I was playing with TL16 HEPlaR missiles, and decided on one point.

I will use armor = 3 on all missiles, and brace HEPlaR ones for
their max gs output (int. structure).  Published missiles have higher
max gs, and their maximum velocity relative to the interstellar medium
(ISM in astro-lingo) can be just as high (with no rule that states "a
missile above such and such a speed is dead.").

Oh yeah, what would you call "long legs?"  I was thinking g\'s, then
thought that big jumps mean faster reaction...

I think that they just meant that the Regency was not investing in 
Vincennes, and perhaps was taxing its industries in a heavy-handed 
manner.  I don\'t think that they were outlawing higher-tech.

There would be basically one lead negotiator and possibly about 3 
assistants, a handful of staffers (legal research, etc.), and the rest of 
the crew would somehow be related to ship\'s functions----pilots, 
engineers, the usual, plus: very good intelligence gatherers, and about a 
platoon worth of very elite troops.

Well, in n-space the ship would have to be able to get out of tight spots 
(the natives are restless type stuff) and stay away from trouble, 
precipitating a high accel rating, and a high jump rating is a must 
because a diplomat  doesnt do much good if he aint where the trouble is.

Ummmm, do you really want a platoon of troops.  I\'m pretty sure that
blows the 40-60 crew requirements!  8)

I think that it would be much easier if you could give us some "hard"
numbers on the number of non-ship function staff.  Something like:

   1 negotiator
   2 assistants
   5 legal researchers
   10 intelligence agents
   ?? ship\'s troops
   etc...

Just as a note, spys aren\'t part of a ship\'s compliment, so should be
accounted for by yourself.

Likewise, you may want to give a displacement value.  The only reason I
ask is because a preliminary design I was working on displaced about
1000tons but was a sitting duck if using your weapon limitations.

As a note.  6G\'s of accelleration won\'t help you against an SDB that
moves just as or almost as fast.  After all, the SDB is better equiped.

I don\'t know, maybe it\'s just me, but when you said lightly armed, for
some reason I thought of a 2 turret limit or something.  Maybe you can
shed some light on this for me...

 Frankly, I liked that stuff, not because I ran adventures there, but 
because it gave me a feel for what the culture was like so I could run NPCs 
better.<<

Precisely.  Having all those sector stats for Aslan, Vargr, Vilani, 
Solomani and whatever other realm of space was not so much necessary for 
visiting the actual worlds as it was to establish the culture.  A good 
perusal of UWPs gives a ref or player a pretty good inkling about what kind 
of culture he\'s dealing with.  Just contrast the Solomani Rim with the 
Spinward Marches and you\'ll see vast differences.  I think the argument 
that Trav players felt like they were being tugged from one side of the 
galaxy to the other is rather weak.  No one\'s _making_ you go to those 
places.  But you have the option to go there if you wish.


Responding to Bri:

>>Am I the only one wondering why the Regency dosen\'t let Vincennes<sp> go 
to TL-17? Think of the *incredible* power a few special antimatter cruisers 
could have -vs- normal fusion powerd ones.
You could have 50t ships that have twin 750mj laser turrets on them.<<

Well, they do hint that Vincennes is an "imminent" TL-17 world.  I\'ve been 
conducting a campaign out of Vincennes for awhile now and I\'ve found that 
you can establish some intrigue by having players try to make industrial 
contacts that can finagle them samples of TL-17 hardware.  I\'ve got one guy 
who wants desperately to own a prototype TL-17 FGMP.  I can\'t make _that_ 
easy to get without upsetting the campaign balance, but I will give him a 
rather difficult opportunity to get it.

My point is, I think they\'ve allowed enough leeway with the "imminent" 
statement to allow individual referees to go ahead and introduce TL-17 
stuff.  Just remember that nowhere else but Vincennes will have the ability 
to spare or repair those antimatter drives!


Responding to Steve Bonneville:

 >>Another designer for the K\'kree!  I guess I\'m not the only one that
likes making these weird designs....

According to the old K\'kree book, tank crews are trained like fighter
crews.  They\'ll have a reasonably high level of Enclosure skill which
represents training to cope with tight spaces.  With typical K\'kree
herd gregariousness, they\'ll probably be a *very* tight outfit, too.<<

I just reacquired CT Alien Module 2:  K\'Kree, so I\'ll read up on Enclosure 
and incorporate it.  Good suggestion.

Yes, I like incorporating weird things in my campaigns, too.  Actually, in 
my Northammon RICE paper, the whole reason I included a K\'Kree refugee camp 
was so I could use them in an upcoming campaign.  In my Regency Merc 
campaign, the players\' platoon is going to be contracted to help the 
disenfranchised K\'Kree fight against SuSAG corporate troops, who are 
encroaching on their "reservation."

I\'ve always thought the K\'Kree were the most difficult race to incorporate 
into a campaign due to their unique behavior and attitude towards 
carnivores.  This presented a challenge to me as a referee which I could 
not refuse.  In order to even communicate with their K\'Kree patrons, the 
mercs are going to have to give up meat for awhile.  To cleanse their 
systems before initial contract talks, I\'m going to invent a special drug 
that\'ll clean their pipes of non-vegetative matter.  I envision about two 
days of extreme platoon-wide nausea. <g>

>>K\'kree "Accomodations" 
  672 kL; 48 tons; 0.012 MW; MCr 1.<<

Is this value _per K\'Kree_?  Or is double-occupancy an option?  I always 
envisioned large herd elements using more or less communal staterooms of 
great size.  Of course, 672 kl ain\'t small!

>>Clear domes would be a Bad Thing on a tank.  Can you say "visible
spectrum laser fire"?  :) Something high-tech might be worked out,
but it sounds like more trouble than it\'s worth.<<

In retrospect, it wasn\'t a very good idea.  I think I\'m going to go with 
several suggestions from various TML people to use holographs and olfactory 
stimulation equipment instead.

Completely unnecessary.  You forget that in 1130, there are less than a dozen
worlds with TL13; a major Aslan incursion, and a sudden need to redeploy the
Fleet against Corridor (vs Virus).  Break a few of these, an the cement 
holding
the Regency together collapses.  The remaining worlds have neither the
industrial capacity nor thr population to be a serious threat.  Wait say 
forty
years and then send in traders.

The best scenario is a combined attack from Chronor timed to an outbreak of
Virus after the Fleet begins to deploy away from Corridor in about 1135.  The
Zho go defensive (they already have an operating anti-Virus blockade, but 
they
did not have to redeploy their fleet) and wait for the Virus to work on 
the Regency
main industrial/technology centers.  Maybe go in later just to make sure the
"evil dozen" worlds are silenced.  Then go away for forty-fifty years.

Hmm. Considering the number of targets and the importance of removing them
(not to mention the rsources of an empire) rocks do not seem like a bad 
idea...

They can return to see most Virus infected equipment broken-down, and 
"rescue"
the human population, who can then be educated in Zho schools in order to
rebuild their own independent (client) worlds.  Broken up, they are not 
much of a
threat to the Zho....

>2) The cost in money and to the econimy would be incredible.

Not necessarily. See above.
Consider the alternative: an aggressive society that will outgrow them 
and will have
a taste for conquering.  That is easily known from several of Norris\'s 
statements
about keeping the Flame until it can be spread...  This is a simple "your 
money or
your life proposition" - pay now or not live to spend what you save.

I don\'t have the Regency Book - and I don\'t plan to buy it.

NOTES

The Pax Regencia-Class Diplomatic Cruiser is the premiere recontact 
starship of the Regency.  Designed on Collace/Plankwell (1237 A628943-E) in 
1196, the ship was commissioned for duty in early 1202 when the tides began 
to turn on the wilds recolonization issue.

Pax Regencia ships are well-armed and armored for operation in the wilds.  
In the event the crew encounters Virus, pirates or hostile TEDs, the ship 
is prepared to fend off heavy attacks.  Since the ship\'s primary purpose is 
diplomatic, some effort was made to conceal its armament.  To this end, the 
turrets and barbettes are located near retractable surface structures so 
that they seem like part of the "natural landscape."  Two separate MFDs are 
supplied, one for use with the longer-range barbettes, and one for use with 
the shorter range turrets.

The four command crew of ship are generally tasked with contact and 
diplomatic liaison duties.  Single-occupation large staterooms have been 
allocated to them to accommodate their personal equipment and to serve as 
makeshift offices.

The ship includes a sophisticated grand conference room (168 m3), complete 
with its own workstation for configuring and displaying elaborate 
holographic presentations.  Two small conference rooms (42 m3 ea.) are used 
for offline meetings and private negotiation between parties.

Pax Regencia-Class starships are named after notable treaties and accords 
from sentient history.

Fuel Scoops, 1.36 hrs. to scoop jump and maneuver fuel.  Fuel purification 
machinery (5.72 MW), 24 hours to refine 4575 m3 (326.79 tons).

 There are legitimate reasons that you might want to hold back on
 TL advances:

 The Regency is still effectively under siege.  In such cases, it
 is important to be able to maintain your ability to produce, and
 to maintain existing production.  In many cases, the ability to
 produce new tech renders it cost-ineffective to continue to
 produce at the lower tech.  Thus, the TL17 planet may stop being
 an effective producer and/or maintainer of TL14 and TL15 equipment
 and ships.  Unless you know that (a) you can immediately replace
 this depot with another planet newly introduced to TL15 or TL16,
 and (b) that you have sufficient capacity for the forseeable
 future, even if this depot becomes effectively unavailable, you
 don\'t want to lose the depot.

 Even were the Regency not under siege, it might still be
 considered inadvisable to permit a retooling for the higher tech
 level.  When a TL offers significant advantages over the previous
 TL, the potential for some very strong distortion of economic
 activity exists.  At this point in time, the Regency really can\'t
 afford this - they\'re still new at the form of government they\'re
 implementing (the democratic reforms), and they have this little
 refugee problem, which itself causes economic problems.  More
 economic upheaval they don\'t need.

 I\'d expect that after things settle down a bit in the Regency
 (slow down the influx of Zhodani refugees, loosen the quarantine,
 rebuild commerce, settle down in the new form of government, et
 cetera), one could expect to see a policy of building up regional
 hubs to the next tech level pretty much simultaneously, with
 possibly one or two sites being allowed to advance ahead of the
 rest, to provide the knowledge base and expertise to help the
 others.  Figure on seeing Vincennes in that role, but don\'t expect
 them to be permitted to lead the rest by much.

I\'ve been ambiguous basically because I don\'t know anything about ship 
design, or I\'d do it myself.   So I guess when it comes down to it, I 
cant give you hard answers, because I don\'t know them.  Use your best 
judgement and your imagination.   I\'m hoping that some really diverse 
ships are made, so anyone who cares can use any of the designs, including 
myself.   Hope that helps.

	Well, this is actually something I know about, and handily 
illustrates a couple of key concepts:

1) A flintlock, even though it is lower tech level than bolt action
rifles, (themselves \'relics\'; bolt action rifles are TL6 ?), is not
really less complicated.  Indeed, one of the main effects of raising
the tech level is lowering the operational complexity.  Modern
flintlocks can be made at TL 4, and they\'ll work perfectly well, but
they\'re expensive due to all the hand work and complex
crafting..they are created as hobby items, not main line production
items. This is why Rolexes are expensive and cheap digital watches 
are , well, cheap (and, if you believe Ford Prefect, one of the 
harbringers of the end of civilization.)

2) The economy of scale is a large factor here...far more bolt
actions are made than flintlocks; if flintlocks were made on that 
scale, they\'d be cheap.

3) Demand.  This will ALWAYS dictate (in a free economy) what is
produced to a large extent.  It is more than quite conceivable, that
producing large quantities of TL 12 spacecraft would be economically
feasable, even for a TL 17 facility, if there are a lot of TL12
starship maintenence facilities out there. This would definitely be
something that the Regency, at least, would definitely be interested
in if they\'re doing any bootstrapping...make ships that the
remaining starports in the wilds can handle.

4) Need.  As Merrick pointed out, some things don\'t need to be at 
high tech levels...What do I need a TL 15 hammer for? (Of course if 
I\'m a Pentag^H^H^H^H Regency Naval Procurer, I could find ways of 
justifying it ;-)

An observation: this ship, given the budget, will probably not have 
high jump capability.

The jump drive is one of the most expensive components of any starship,
and with the MCr 250 budget, assuming that it is all spent on the jump
drive, a 833-1/3 kL system can be purchased.  This is only enough for:
 jump number     6     5     4     3     2     1
 ship displ.   850  1000  1190  1490  1980  2975   (displacement tons)
 
I\'d guess that a ship along the lines that is being requested will be
at most 1000 to 1500 displacement tons and will compromise on jump drive.
I built a 2000-ton command yacht with similar specs, commissioned by a 
wealthy player-character; it has a crew of 40 to 60, 14 passengers and
owner-aboard, jump-6 (but 2G), some small craft, and a number of other 
interesting features.  The cost is in the mid MCr 900s, but it\'s fast, 
luxurious, spacious, and the player could pay GSbAG/Terra the price.  
Three-fifths of that price went to the massive jump drive.

Actually, judging by your comments about "a platoon of troops", what 
you want is something like a Broadsword-class cruiser...I didn\'t design 
it, but can I submit it?  :)  It\'s only MCr 315.  Reduce it to one squad
and put diplomats and staff in the staterooms freed up.  If eight laser
turrets are too many, replace some with escape pods or whatever.  It\'s
jump-3, 2G, TL15, and even in the right crew range.

What makes you think that because a world has a TL rating of 15 there will
be no demand for ships of less than TL15 or indeed <TL15 shipyards on that
world. Due to retooling and capital replacement lags it is more likely that
a world rated as TL15 is not able to satisfy all shipyard demands in TL15
yards. In fact some TL14 and 13 yards would continue to operate profitably
for sometime to maintain ships of that vintage and to satisfy the demand not
fulfilled by the limited capacity of TL15 yards. TL15 yards are likely to be
\'state of the art\' and R&D yards of initially low volume. The high volume
output would still be at TL14. 
The added complication is the structure of the industry. Since it is most
likely that starship construction would involve a large number of
contractors spread across the world each producing components, it is not
necessarily the case that each contracting firm is a \'state of the art\'/R&D
firm. One simply can\'t look at shipyards as adding all the value. They are
the clicking the components together stage.

Sneakers are made completely in the same factory. I think that starships
would differ significantly in that they contain millions of components that
would most likely not be produced all at the same yards or in the same factory.
What is more, the TL rating of a world in no way reflects the wealth of that
world or the wisdom of its distribution. One world may be able to produce
large numbers of TL15 ships but has turned half the world into a wasteland
and gutted its satellites for resources, while another world may be only
capable of TL12 ships while having energy efficient environmentally friendly
facilities of TL15. The Soviet Union may have had a nuclear arsenal but it
also had Chernobyl.

Here\'s my attempt at a design for a diplomatic vessel.  I came
in a tad over budget, but I with a volume discount it should fit
in nicely.  Any feedback would be welcome.

         Notes:
         Fuel scoops are fitted, and the Cavour can refine fuel at the rate
         of 50 Kl/hour (sufficient to allow on-demand refining when running
         at 1 G acceleration).

         The Cavour class diplomatic packet is one of the latest of the TL-
         16 ship types coming out of the Vicennes Shipyards, designed
         specifically for the diplomatic challenges of moving into the
         wilds.  With it\'s jump 5 capability and 3 G acceleration, the
         Cavour can get places quickly both in n-space and real space, a
         must for a diplomatic vessel.  It can carry a diplomatic team of
         10 in luxury (or up to 20 with some crowding) and provides space
         for a security force of 16 (48 using hot bunking). 

         For use in the Wilds, where diplomats cannot rely on their
         government for protection, the Cavour is armed with two state of
         the art combination missile/laser barbettes [See description
         below] and 3 TL-16 master fire directors.  The sensor and comm
         suites are also state of the art: the 480,000 km active EMS and
         240,000 km EMS Jamming ranges compare with many front line
         warships; in addition to the standard long-range radio and laser
         communicators, the Cavour carries a 300,000 km meson communicator,
         allowing secure communication with other similarly equipped ships.
         The Cavour is equipped with an EMM suite.

         Since the Cavour is streamlined for planetary landings, there are
         no standard provisions for small craft.  There is room in the
         cargo bay for a speeder and a grav bike or two (up to 5 T of
         craft), and these are generally added when more extensive ground
         transport capability is needed.

         TL-16 Combination Missile/Laser Barbette
         Standard 6T Barbette Mount

         The tightly integrated combination mount used in the Cavour is a
         compact, powerful and energy efficient weapon system.  The main
         armament is a non grav focused X-ray laser with a short range of
         300,000 km.  To compensate for the drop in damage beyond short
         range, the barbette is also equipped with three missiles, each in
         it\'s own launcher.  Each barbette also has a TL-16 MFD capable of
         controlling either the laser or up to 6 missiles. [note: on the
         Cavour there are three mfd\'s - one in each barbette and one on the
         bridge. Standard battle practice is to have a gunner in each
         barbette controlling the laser, and the bridge gunner controlling
         all 6 missiles. In the event of damage to the bridge mfd, either
         barbette mfd can take over]

         Any missile under 7 kl in volume may be used.  The barbettes hold
         3 missiles each, all at ready. Additional missiles must be carried
         as cargo outside of the barbette.

You just agreed with me.  I\'m saying that TL15 shipyards will be
damanded to make TL15 ships.  However, that doesn\'t mean that TL12-14
shipyards will automatically disappear.  In fact, they\'ll have new
found business repairing displaced ships.

: firm. One simply can\'t look at shipyards as adding all the value. They are
: the clicking the components together stage. 

They are the "clicking" stage.  However a TL15 shipyard will need TL15
components.  Thus, it will stock these from whomever can supply them. 
It\'s called import and export.  A shipyard just like any other
business, and any interstellar business has no reason to limit itself
to domestic components if it doesn\'t need to.

Actually, sneaker components are produced in a variety of places and
are assembled in said locations (rubber soles from Mexico, canvas from
China, yet, they\'re all put together in Indonesia).  Not to sound
snooty, but you\'re making the mistake of assuming that shipyards aren\'t
opperating like any other normal business.

I never said that the TL of a world reflected its wealth or wisdom.  I
said that it reflects its technological capacity.  I also said that
market forces would have a TL15 shipyard produce TL15 ships.  That\'s
about it...  8)

    'body' => 'Hi all,

Been out of touch a while with holidays and work, but I just thought I\'d
chip in on the "Why Use TL13 production if you Could Use TL15?" debate.

I see a major cause being the customer. Military customers tend to be
pushing for the latest tech\' (even if currently it takes years to get
through all the approvals, etc. - perhaps they\'ll have sorted this out in
3000 years time). Civil customers just want things made easier - a few worry
about the actual \'tech\', i.e. to show off to the Joneses next door, but
usually people just want something that _looks_ new. Lower tech may suddenly
come back into fashion, perhaps labourers from a less developed area of a
planet (assuming it is in any way balkanised like Earth) may only be able to
handle lower tech tools, etc.

Vincennes might already be at TL17 for the military, but perhaps the
interesting new weapons they\'ve thought up are still going through approvals
- that could make it 10-20 years before large numbers begin appearing in
active service. Tech 17 doesn\'t mean everything\'s that tech either - the
good old World Builder\'s Handbook allowed separate techs for common people
to military to medecine, etc. so I think people should be wary of talking
too much about immediate subsector domination (or whatever) by a world that
suddenly \'clicks\' from tech 16 to 17.

As someone pointed out (sorry, forgot name), the other problem with TL17
stuff is it\'s no good as exports: it\'ll be costly initially and replacement
parts will be equally so. No sensible neighbouring power will buy TL17
equipment for anything critical (military, power, etc.) when their entire
supply of spares is reliant upon the good will of the source planet...

Then there\'s just the plain repairability. Take TL 7 vs. TL 6. Ever tried
repairing the internal workings of a modern car vs. an old VW Beetle or
Polo? I know which I prefer - and second-hand spares are cheaper! However,
this only works for a limited range of tech levels - spares become very
sparse if one tries to repair a Model T Ford, for example.

How simple are a knife and fork? What tech are yours produced at? If yours
got broken, could you repair them yourself (ignores shouts of "Yes, I\'ve got
my own arc-welding set" from the Beetle enthusiasts at the back). More
likely you\'d buy new ones or (on a hypothetical desert island) resort to
forked sticks and sharpened stones or somesuch.

Tech is partly real tech (i.e. advancements in theory, understanding,
processes and materials) and partly the application of thought to already
existing tech (e.g. a sudden boom in the use of infra-red beams to link
remote devices - cash tills, etc. - where infra-red technology has been
around many years but no one got around to using it in this manner except
for TV remote controls...).

As per almost _any_ situation in Traveller, you usually only have to take a
look at the world around you to find an equivalent real-life situation. That
saves a lot of hypotheses!

This particular starship was fairly uncommon during the Rebellion, and 
was largely found attacking the coreward Domain frontiers during the 
early years of the Final War.  While certainly not capable of joining the 
Line of Battle, it was fairly well used as a major commerce & convoy raider.
A peculiar Gvurrdon design, it stresses speed and weaponry over armour.
  
It obtains it\'s extraordiary maneuverability by sacrificing nearly all 
it\'s armour, making it quite vulnerable to PA and laser strikes.  An 
excellent missile platform, it was heavily used for Vargr planetary 
bombardment from orbit.  A massive meson gun is supplies, with a PA 
accellerator for fighting at longer ranges. 

While it does have a fuel purifier, it\'s massive, unweldly form (rear end 
is similar to a massive concave mushroom, with it\'s stalk covered with 
spikes and odd bumps) makes it impossible to operate in atmosphere.

It\'s large communication suite makes it a viable command platform: a flag 
bridge can easily be installed to suit the commander\'s needs, as the fuel 
tanks are capable of handling life support.  However, since fuel is the 
lifeline for such a thinly-armoured craft like the Llanvull Oguu and it\'s 
sisters, no bridge is installed initially.

40,000 Subsidized liners seems like an awfull lot.  I think it would
make more sense if instead they used giant cargo ships, like the Common
Imperial Transport from the Rebellion Handbook. They could fill the
cargo bay with low berth compartments and just freeze the immigrants.  
THe CIT had about 145,000 kilo liters of cargo space, and low berths
take up 14 kl, so that is over 10,000 people a trip.  That would only
take 200 trips a year.  So what if a few thousand of the proles die in
transit, they are only "low-brow, low-tech thugs"

I thought only meson guns could be put underground.  Particle
accelerators fire protons or nuetrons, which have too high of a cross
section to go through dense matter.

Kubishush:
The paper talks about how the Gl\'lu orignally lived on a small gas
giant.  I find that pretty hard to believe.  Neptune and Uranus are
both small gas giants, and have small rocky cores surrounded by mantles
of H and He.  The temperatures are about 7000 K and the atmosphere has
a pressure of 7 million bar, in the interior. (Astronomy: A Physical
Perspective, Kutner 1987) This sounds pretty different then the listed
stats for Kubishush of  B8B6AAA-D.  Maybe the Gl\'lu came from a
similiar planet in  another star system, or their home planet was
destroyed and used to be in a now empty orbit.

It is my contention that TLs up to TL 15 are purely a matter of economics:
the knowledge exists, but some worlds can\'t afford the infrastructure. If
this is accepted (and I for one can\'t see any other explanation for (most
of) the different TLs in the Traveller Universe) TL advancement is
controllable to the degree that you believe that economy is controllable.

>The knowledge exists, there is the advancement.

If that was all that was necessary then every world in Charted Space would
be TL 15 (at least, maybe 16 or even 17 like Vincennes, depending on the 
rate of dissemination of the knowledge).

I haven\'t read the Regency Source Book yet. I gather that they say that
Vincennes has reached TL 17 in knowledge? In my own universe Vincennes 
was borderline TL 16 in 1115; that is, they were just discovering TL 16
technologies. I believe this is non-canonical and that in the Official
Traveller Univers Vincennes was solid TL 16 in 1115. Even so, the
discoveries that led to TL 16 must be fairly recent (otherwise more of
the important planets like Mora and Capital would be TL 16 too. Advancing
a whole _discovery_ TL in just 70 years seems awfully fast to me. In my
campaign Vincennes will advance to solid TL 16 in that time, no more.
(Assuming for purposes of argument that my campaign ever reaches 1200).

     I recommend tapping into GEnie\'s game forum.  There is a huge amount 
     of information there, including sector stats for just about every 
     sector ever published.  Subsector makers (separate versions available 
     for both PC and Mac) available in the forum can make graphical maps, 
     so you can pretty much create a sector map for any area of space in 
     which you want to conduct a campaign.
     
     If you have deep pockets, you may want to buy some of the old stuff.  
     I recommend Weekend Warrior in L.A., at 818-988-1441, if you want the 
     most comprehensive collection.  A bit pricey, but if there\'s an item 
     you just gotta have, Ken will most likely have it.
     
     I don\'t remember what RICE stands for, actually.  I think it was way 
     back in TML # 4 or 7.  You will need access to World Builder\'s 
     Handbook, an old MT book by DGP, in order to create RICE stats.

     and wait for the Virus to work on  the Regency main industrial/

     But we now know that the Zhodani have been involved in a possible war

     being eaten up by that conflict.  There are other apparent problems

     >>Actually, judging by your comments about "a platoon of troops", what 
     you want is something like a Broadsword-class cruiser...I didn\'t 
     design it, but can I submit it?  :)  It\'s only MCr 315.  Reduce it to 
     one squad and put diplomats and staff in the staterooms freed up.  If 
     eight laser turrets are too many, replace some with escape pods or 
     whatever.  It\'s jump-3, 2G, TL15, and even in the right crew range.<<
     
     I wouldn\'t recommend it.  Though the Broadsword fits several of the 
     parameters of the ship described, what it symbolizes is extremely 
     _un_diplomatic.  In the wilds, most folks may not know the history of 
     the Broadsword, so perhaps it could work, but these ships are designed 
     for the transportation of killers for hire, not diplomats.
     
     Accommodations are tight and the ship is generally outfitted with an 
     armory, marshalling area and cutter modules used for ground action.  
     Sure, they could all be refitted for a more civilian use, but it would 
     buck tradition.
     
     As far as the platoon of troops is concerned, I think he might do 
     better to have his gunners trained in small arms use, or something.  
     It sounds like Charles wants a slightly Star Trek feel to his 
     campaign.  Maybe he could have members of his crew skilled in weaponry 
     and unarmed martial arts and operate like those poor red-shirted 
     security troops who always seemed to get killed in the original ST

In the TNE novel "To Dream of Chaos", it is mentioned that Krutercorp 
mints a gold coin with the Kruyter logo.  This is a favorite of the RCES

Notes:

The \'Emsu Kushukhinir\' Diplomatic Transport / Courier designed to meet a
Regency specification issued in late 1201.  Designed to carry diplomatic
teams into potentially dangerous areas, and operate for extended periods of
time, the Type 510 relies on it\'s extensive EW suite and hull armour for
survivability against hostile encounters.  The Type 510 carries powerful EM
masking and jamming equipment to avoid detection and lock-on by attacking
forces, and it\'s hull armour is much thicker than normally found in
non-military starships.

The ship\'s 4 hardpoints are typically configured as 2 x sandcasters and 2 x
laser turrets, although other configurations are possible, depending on
mission requirements.

The ship\'s crew includes steward and medical personnel, these can be omitted
or replaced by mission-specific personnel.  The Type 510 can carry up to 14
passengers, if the normal crew complement is on-board, although 7-10
passengers is the norm.  Passenger staterooms are seperated by demountable
wall compartments, and can be reconfigured in any combination fitting within
their space.  Provision is also made for up to 42 troops.

The ship\'s cargo bay is designed to accomodate covert insertion of assets.
An auxilliary cargo hatch can be used for Drop Capsule / Meteoric Insertion
operations, although some cargo area must be sacrificed to accomodate drop
capsules.

An export/budget version of the Type 510 is available.  The Type 510-A
dispenses with EM masking and jamming equipment (reclaiming 145 m^3 of
space), but has a greatly reduced cost (MCr 263.651 / 237.286 volume).  The
reclaimed space is used to install increased weaponry (3 x turrets, or 1 x
barbette and 1 x turret), to increase survivability.

The Type 510 is named for Duke Emsu Kushukhinir, Duke of Rhylanor from
1069-1091.  Kushukhinir negotiated the cease fire and armistice agreements
that ended the Fourth Frontier War in 1084.  Subsequent vessels will be
named for noted diplomats and peacemakers in the Regency\'s history.

Quite an ugly old hog.  However, it will cause all sorts of trouble for 
the local yokels downbelow: the Uguarran is a good platform for meson, 
missile and laser orbital fire, while it\'s thick hide and stolid meson 
screen will filter out most counterattacks.  Among the more common - and 
loathed - sights on the coreward frontier during the Rebellion, from 
Deneb to Vland.  Still in use among the surviving Vargr states in 
Gvurrdon sector.

It\'s major weakness, of course, is it\'s pathetic fuel capasity.  It\'s 
survival depends on other Vargr elements clearing out most [Imperial] 
opposition before it can get to work zapping the dirtsiders.  By 1122, 
almost all have switched over to TL F electronics and EMM masking (with 
deep gratitude to the captured Corridor depot for supplying the needed 
equipment)

        I thought that was how TL was _defined_: the TL of commonly
available manufactured items, with limited quantities (i.e. R&D or novelty)
of the next TL available. The example above would be a TL_14_ world ... TL14
is what\'s commonly available, with some TL15 capability. Thus at TL15, most
yards would be TL15, and the \'state of the art\' R&D, low-volume yards would
actually be TL16.
        At least, that\'s how I\'ve always understood and played TL.

that ended the Fourth Frontier War in 1084.  Subsequent vessels will be
named for noted diplomats and peacemakers in the Regency\'s history.

Large Laser has turret hidden under a small hatch.
Missile Barbette is hidden under a large hatch.
 
This ship has hidden firepower in order present a less threatening appearence 
for its primarily diplomatic assignment.  If purchased in quantity, our 
shipyards could produce more martial variants at a substantial savings than 
another 500ton design since this is already a very capable ship.
 
In order to improve survivability we have isolated the ignition/recombustion 
chambers into 6 separate units insuring some maneuver capability even under the 
worst combat damage.

The passenger staterooms include room for high level staff, and ambassadors 
(large staterooms), as well as a mixture of intellegence and diplomatic staff.
Typically, a troop complement of 10-12 would be expected within these spaces as well.

The ship is powered for all systems at once, except the CG lifters.  The ship is
limited to 5g when using them.  The laser turret is powered for a ROF of 100,
but it is beefed up for a ROF of 800.  Each gturn not spent is another 100 shots
per turn.

There is not enough power in the prototype for the full ROF, but it could be
added to the production models (beefing up the PP by 8kl) at a small additional cost.

The class will be named for outstanding diplomats in the service of the
Regency.  Birendra Devi was one such diplomat in the service of Noris.
The class versions would have the uprated 1900MW powerplant at the
increased cost of 1.143 MCr, and the loss of 7.143kl from cargo space.

Doh!  I\'m tired :-)

I forgot to mention the reason for the 800MJ turret.  It\'ll critical a
small ship every hit(as long as the armor is 230 or less), and it\'ll have a 
diff level of Difficult out to 35 hexes in the production model (32 in the 
prototype).  In the production model (of the DC) the diff level will be 
Average at 32 hexes----that\'s 2 hits half the time or so.  Much better than even 
having 4 TL14 LBs.  Criticals will get the bad guys off your back so you can
jump the hell out.

BACKGROUND

Intended for first contact and survey missions in the wilds, the Armistice 
class was designed in the Regency in 1199, and the first examples of the class 
were brought into service in 1202. Capable of long term autonomous operations 
in the wilds, it was intended to serve the interests of the Regency, 
reintegrating worlds damaged by the collapse into interstellar society. 
Carrying a diplomatic team of five, and with quarters for 4-8 passengers, it 
was intended to bring together the leaders of warring factions and facilitate 
peace negotiations, and introduce worlds to the Regency, persuading them 
through assistance of the value of joining. The weapons are usually kept 
concealed, but are occasionally used to reassure the TEDs who board the ship 
that it is a safe meeting place, or in a few isolated cases, as a threat.
The ship is outfitted to cope with a variety of situations, capable of lending 
high-tech assistance to a world suffering from disease or environmental 
problems, carrying a lab and sickbay.
Once a region of space is considered comparatively safe after contact has been 
made, the Armistice class vessels move outwards and lighter diplomatic vessels 
with a less threatening armament take over diplomatic roles. 

DESIGNERS\' NOTES

The weapons systems are included to increase mission flexibility, and to give 
the vessel protection while operating autonomously in the wilds. Because all 
weapons are fired as batteries through the MFDs, there are no turret stations 
present on board which would otherwise be noticed by visitors. Normally the 
gunners\' stations on the bridge are configured as extra electronics 
workstations, and the turret covers are not fitted individually, but instead as 
two large panels which externally resemble cargo doors. In extreme 
circumstances, the weapons batteries could be used as a diplomatic lever for 
negotiations. The discharge energy of the weapons fitted is equivalent to 12 
Gazelle CEs, although the weapons are limited to three targets by the MFDs.

The jumpdrives were extremely expensive, so a compromise design allows a Jump 4 
range if needed, but a two week transit time. The ship has G rating based on 
actual mass which gave some weight/volume savings, allowing high G, high G-Turn 
performance which should let it get away from most pursuers.

The lasers are non-grav focused.

Jerry Alexandratos said:
I never said that the TL of a world reflected its wealth or wisdom.  I

WorldTH.

Hans Rancke-Madsen said:
 Advancing a whole _discovery_ TL in just 70 years seems awfully fast to me. 
>>me too!  Especially if you look at the ammount of time it appears to have taken to 
raise the TL of the interstellar races (i can\'t remember exactly now, but wasn\'t the Imperium 
TL15 for a lot longer than 70 years - like try 100\'s of years).  I think that the move to TL 16
for some Imperial research stations/ exceptional worlds in the MT timeframe is about right.
Perhaps as Hans says this could be consolidated now (ie TNE) in the Regency.  I think that
the jump to TL17 is inconsistent with earlier trav material.  If we refer to CT Tl chars you can see 
low Tl\'s representing 1000\'s of years difference, medium TL\'s (approaching TL8) seperated by 100\'s
then 10\'s of years and then for high TL\'s the gap goes up to 1000\'s of years again.

I think that the gaps between the higher TL\'s are larger, this is partially due to our inability to accurately
predict the rate of discovery that far in the future.  Generally the TL effects are not linear and thus a
1 TL gap at the upper end tends to give more of an advantage (although this curve continues to be flattened by
GDW).

Personally I think that the introduction of easily accessable TL17 equipment would change dramatically
the feel of the traveller universe.  I think that if GDW have given in to this "arms race" of TLs then the
game will worse for it.  I mean if you really want to play at high TLs why not do it outside the Imperium
and design everything at TL21 or why not 35? ;-)

Sure, but there is an SDB that fits that request already.  Also, in the
request a statement of specific mission requirements would help.  An SDB
without a jump drive is a just a fighter since in system travel is
useless (from a military reaction POV) without a microjump----so maybe
for an SDB you say anti-small craft, hot bunking OK (it\'ll be scrabled
from a base 99% of the time, so the bunks aren\'t a long term habitat)
or even what close air support requirements it might have to have.

I would add a jumpdrive to any SDB that wasn\'t just a big fighter
as things stand...  sounds like fun.

I\'d be interested in Zhodani designs, myself----but I would want to have
the standard turret/barbette sizes changed to reflect the needs of a
TL14 navy (like a 4ton turret).

But I\'ll give the SDB a crack (hey!  I\'ll do it as a Zho design :-)

descriptive article.  This RICE paper is intended to build upon the information 
provided in the article and reestablish Vincennes in The New Era.]

Vincennes is the technological jewel of the Regency.  The planet is the 
Regency\'s singlemost advanced producer of commercial technology, known for its 
unique environmental characteristics and reclusive society.  Many detractors of 
Vincenzi success cite the system\'s inability to achieve universal TL-17 
technology as indicative of the system\'s imminent decline.  The growing 
interference of bureaucracies and the aristocracy in Vincenzi entrepreneurial 
interests threatens to derail all that the Vincenzi have built.  The spectre of 
crime and corruption has begun to taint the planet\'s prospects as well.  The 
upcoming age will not be easy for the Vincenzi, but if their hallowed 
entrepreneurial spirit prevails, Vincennes will continue to shine as a nexus of 
technological and societal wonder.

ORIGINS OF VINCENZI HIGH-TECH

The origins of Vincennes\' amazingly innovative and enterprising society are the 
result of the unique properties of the world and its trinary star system.  To 
understand Vincenzi technological innovation, one must understand the hostile 
environment Vincennes presents to its inhabitants.  Vincennes orbits Ember, the 
close companion of system primary, Undraczech.  Because of the proximity of the 
two stars to one another, Vincennes\' orbit takes it almost directly between 
Ember and Undraczech.  The weak stellar emanations of red dwarf Ember are 
insufficient to support life on their own.  When Vincennes is in close proximity
to Undraczech, however, intense stellar radiation produces extremely high 
temperatures and inclement meteorological activity on the planet.  The result is
that Vincenzi temperature and weather patterns vary greatly over its 199.27 day 
orbit around Ember.

During Vincenzi summers, when the planet is directly between the two suns, 
temperatures climb to an unbearable 66 degrees C.  Massive convection storms 
sweep the planet and the intense heat releases sulfur compounds from the 
planet\'s ocean depths, shrouding the entire globe in blustery cloud formations. 
Autumn is the rainy season on Vincennes, with the highly acidic taint of the 
planet\'s atmosphere producing acid rain storms that force Vincenzi to don 
protective clothing and breathing masks when going outdoors.  During winter, 
when Vincennes is at its most distant point from Undraczech, the temperatures 
drop as low as -20 degrees C.  Icebergs dot the ocean surface around the globe, 
with polar ice caps forming in the southern and northern extremes.  Spring is 
the most pleasant season, during which the temperature is at a comfortable level
and the atmospheric taint is reduced to the point that the normally reclusive 
Vincenzi can actually come outdoors and breathe in the open air.

The extremely hostile environment of Vincennes begs the question, "Why colonize 
such a planet?"  The answer is that Vincennes is rich in natural resources.  
Underneath Vincennes\' deep, nearly worldwide ocean (Vincennes features a 94 
percent hydrosphere), rich deposits of ores and radioactives await industrial 
development.  While several sprawling undersea metroplexes have been erected 
over the centuries to exploit Vincennes\' resources, many geological surveyors 
believe Vincenzi industrial interests still have only scratched the surface.  
The difficult prospect of doing business on Vincennes spawned an active research
and development community.  Vincenzi innovation in communications, robotics and 
environmental technology have made it possible to operate in an otherwise 
unsuitable climate.

Vincenzi life is generally compared to that of Cambrian-era Terra.  Notable 
among Vincenzi lifeforms are beam, a bamboo-like plant structure that grows in 
Vincenzi oceans, and rockmat, a porous rockhard substance that grows around the 
rocky formations of The Shoal, much like Terran coral.

SOCIETY

Notable among the Vincenzi metroplexes are Kehmed (the capital city), Burke (the
newest of the metroplexes), Markel (dominated by SuSAG industrial concerns) and 
Willis.  All of the metroplexes include scores of arcologies, domed cities and 
satellite gravitic cities that hover above the Vincenzi ocean, serving the ore 
transportation and trade interface needs of their undersea cohorts.  Kehmed, far
and away the most populous metroplex, includes an astounding 77 gravitic cities 
within its dominion.  The gravitic cities come in numerous shapes and sizes and 
generally serve specialized purposes.  Melchen, for instance, primarily serves 
the tourist and entertainment sectors, while Malin Tekhar and Dumorov are more 
industrial in nature.  Remote Foxhunter, an irregular-formation gravitic city, 
inhabits Vincennes\' horse latitudes, avoiding the worst of the planet\'s weather 
by deftly increasing its altitude during the summers.  Many of the gravitic 
cities are lowered to the surface of Vincennes during the more stable winter and
spring seasons.  During these periods, ores and manufactured products are easily
shipped from the undersea metroplexes to the floating gravitic cities via 
submersible.

The solitary archipelago of the world, known as The Shoal, is sparsely 
inhabited.  Due to seismic instability and heavy erosion during the summers, its
rocky surface supports very few permanent habitations.  Only Vincennes Down 
Starport and its surrounding community maintain a large permanent presence.  
During the stormy summers, landings at Vincennes Down would be nigh-impossible 
if it weren\'t for advanced Vincenzi manipulator technology that enables the 
starport to gravitically guide starships to safety.

The proliferation of high-tech among Vincenzi citizens has resulted in a unique 
society.  Vincennes\' advanced communications and computer technology enable most
Vincenzi to perform business completely from their homes.  An entire world of 
telecommuters maintains contact with one another using holographic meson 
communications equipment.  Entire board meetings of some Vincenzi corporations 
are held in virtual boardrooms that exist only in the conceptual sense.  
Holographic representations of one\'s business associates may be projected so 
that they appear to be in the same room, even though they may be on the other 
side of The Shoal, the planet or even the outer system.

Most Vincenzi have managed to acquire at least a moderate amount of personal 
wealth.  While Vincenzi society is hardly utopian, it can accurately be said 
that advanced technology on Vincennes has paved the path for most of the 
planet\'s inhabitants to build at least a small personal fortune.

During the pre-Rebellion era, advanced robotics were employed to perform 
virtually all dangerous or undesirable tasks on Vincennes, including mining 
operations, zero-G ops in orbit of Vincennes and deep-sea construction.  The 
antirobotic hysteria that swept the Regency after the appearance of Virus 
greatly injured the Vincenzi robotics industry.  Native Vincenzi, however, were 
not willing to give up the advantages their robots gave them.  Instead, they 
have willingly submitted to RQS regulations that limit offworld exportation of 
Vincenzi robotics technology.  Since then, technology-sharing agreements with 
advanced robotics research groups on Rhylanor and HRD have spawned astonishing 
advances in Virus-proofing techniques.  These developments, along with 
decreasing antirobotic sentiment and aggressive lobbying by `G\' (Vincennes\' 
largest and most powerful distributor and exporter of high-tech equipment) and 
several Vincenzi industrial consortiums has resulted in a gradual thawing of the
RQS regulations.  Within the last decade, Vincenzi robotics construction and 
exportation has reached about 25 percent of its pre-Rebellion level.

Because of the Vincenzi tendency to utilize high-tech communications for most of
their interpersonal contact, offworlders will discover that most of the people 
they meet on Vincenzi streets are other offworlders.  Just because Vincenzi tend
to be reclusive doesn\'t mean they\'re entirely unfriendly, however.  While actual
person-to-person contact is not common, when Vincenzi do get together, they tend
to hold gala events, parties and festivals that rival any in the Regency. 
In the spring, Vincennes\' gravitic cities retract their rooves and 
millions of people gather in plazas, parks and the streets to engage in spring 
festivals and celebrations.

Crime has traditionally been a remarkably small problem on Vincennes.  Due to 
the Vincenzi tendency to operate from their homes, reduced interaction between 
people and relative economic well-being have prevented the criminal turmoil that
plagues most high-population Regency systems from developing on Vincennes.  The 
moderate influx of refugee population and arrival of several discreet 
white-collar criminal organizations, however, has tainted Vincennes\' crime-free 
reputation since the Collapse.  Many offworlders attribute these problems to the
resurgence of the notorious Humbolt family on Vincennes, whose criminal 
tendencies are legendary.  Vincenzi natives, however, generally point their 
fingers at opportunistic offworlders, who are all too eager to reap the 
financial rewards of doing business on Vincennes and frequently resort to 
criminal pursuits to do so.

OBTAINING VINCENZI TECHNOLOGY

Traders and travellers coming to Vincennes for high-tech goods won\'t be 
disappointed in the selection but they may be a bit miffed by the amount of 
bureaucratic red tape they have to cut through to buy any of it.  The planet\'s 
high-tech market sells TL-16 goods primarily at the planet\'s orbital starports 
and Vincennes Down Starport.

Most would-be tech purchasers are usually surprised by the level of interference
from the Vincennes Trade and Commerce Commission (VTCC).  The VTCC is one of the
more intrusive trade management bureaucracies in the Regency and maintains 
strict guidelines by which sale of high-tech goods may be made.  Regency 
citizenship is required for any purchase and all computer, communications and 
robotic equipment sold on Vincennes undergoes thorough examination by local RQS 
officials before export.  The VTCC\'s primary concern is quality control and the 
level of technology proliferation.  Most VTCC bureaucrats support a 
controlled-growth economic philosophy.

The VTCC\'s primary opponent is `G,\' the main distributor and exporter of 
Vincennes\' advanced technological goods.  G has recently begun to build a 
spin-off company, `H,\' whose primary concern is creating venture capital for 
Vincenzi companies working on TL-17 prototypes and marketing these products to 
offworld interests.  Because of the bureaucratic warfare between the VTCC and 
the more laissez faire G, and the rigidity of trade regulations, small lot 
purchases of Vincenzi technology are often difficult to arrange.  Alternatively,
tech-hungry adventurers may want to make friends with the more established free 
traders of the Vincennes Cluster.  Many of them make large-lot purchases of 
Vincenzi tech and given the right price, are often willing to sell small or 
individual quantities of high-tech goods.  Small-lot or individual purchases of 
Vincenzi equipment are therefore made, for the most part, not on Vincennes but 
in nearby systems.

Vincenzi starships are renowned for their quality and ample use of TL-16 
technology.  Because of the planet\'s proximity to Depot Alpha and Depot Beta, 
Vincennes manufactures very few warships.  A few escort and frigate variants are
manufactured on Vincennes for the purpose of defending tech shipments or 
agricultural products from Paven, but for the most part, Vincennes concentrates 
on producing traders, liners and exploratory vessels.  Perhaps the most 
well-known of Vincenzi starship designs is the 300-ton Gushiken-Class Free 
Trader.  The Gushiken uses TL-16 technology to minimize the volume taken by 
drive and electronic component and maximizes cargo space.  The ship was 
originally intended for microjump transportation of grain from Paven to 
Vincennes but has since been adopted for more universal use.

GOVERNMENT

Up until the formation of the Regency in 1132, Vincennes had been ruled by the 
Marquis of Vincennes for several centuries, a position appointed directly by the
Archduke of Deneb after the controversial fall of the Humbolt family.  The 
Humbolts had ruled Vincennes for almost four centuries when they were removed 
from power and exiled in 628 for several violations of Imperial law, the most 
heinous of which was the exploitation and torture of the native sophonts of 
nearby Perez System.  Following the Collapse and subsequent decline of the 
Imperial nobility, the wealthy Humbolt family made its return to Vincennes and 
reestablished their political hegemony on the planet in 1147.  The largely 
Solomani population of Vincennes was eager to overthrow the Garhik Dynasty, the 
last vestige of the invasive Imperial Nobility on Vincennes, and the return of 
the Humbolts presented them with the opportunity.

The Humbolt family had lived for dozens of generations on a frontier world of 
spinward Gushemege Sector, but never lost hope for their eventual return to the 
world of their ancestors.  Fleeing Virus and the effects of the Collapse, the 
Humbolts made their return to the Domain of Deneb scant months before the 
borders were closed.

It has been revealed in the years since their return that a large contingent of 
the Humbolt family remained on Vincennes throughout their exile, operating under
the banner of several shadow corporations.  These corporations may be more 
accurately described as cartels or syndicates whose primary function was the 
consolidation of industrial power under the yoke of the Humbolts.  Five 
centuries of gradual political and corporate power bids gave the Humbolts a 
staggering advantage upon their "public" return to Vincennes.  The current 
patriarch of the family, Gerhard Lewis Tolemi Humbolt III, maintains an 
intimidating presence on Vincennes, frequently interfering in the activities of 
major corporations and dabbling in VTCC operations when he can.

Many Vincenzi complain about the intrusiveness of the Humbolt family in 
corporate affairs, but most are willing to tolerate them.  The Humbolt family 
serves as a symbol of defiance to Imperial and Regency authority, which to most 
Vincenzi justifies their continued presence.

For the most part, actual political power resides with the District Councils of 
each metroplex.  Day-to-day legislative and judicial activities are the realm of
the councils, who owe fealty and give lip service to the Humbolt family.

MILITARY AND LAW ENFORCEMENT

Before the Collapse, Vincennes maintained their modest military and law 
enforcement requirements through The Special Branch, a relatively small police 
organization and  considerable network of contractors.  The ranks of The Special
Branch have swelled to over 20 million permanent employees in recent years in 
order to combat the increasing presence of organized crime and the illegal 
activities of The Pack, the Vargr crime syndicate.  The Special Branch continues
to employ millions of contract employees in its law enforcement endeavors as 
well.

Traditionally, Vincennes maintained no standing army, but with the return of the
Humbolts, a new emphasis on military strength has been established.  Under the 
auspices of the Humbolts the Vincenzi 1192nd Air Cavalry Division was formed to 
act in the defense of Vincennes in the event of an attack.  The 1192nd 
officially reports to the Vice Marshall of the Regency Army, but the unit 
maintains an obvious pro-Humbolt stance.  Scores of mercenary groups are 
employed to supplement military operations on Vincennes as well.

Though no formal naval base exists in Vincennes System, the Regency Navy 
maintains a large presence at Defense, Paven and Stopover, three of the 
outer-system worlds.  Defense operates a considerable System Defense Boat and 
small Destroyer fleet.  Paven, the primary agricultural producer of the system 
is heavily guarded by a regiment of crack Regency Marines.  Paven suffered a 
horrendous decline in production during a Rebellion-era famine thought to have 
been caused by planted biological agents.  The marine garrison on Paven is 
intended to prevent another such occurrence.  Stopover contains a refueling 
depot for Regency Naval ships.

THE FUTURE

Vincennes\' future is uncertain.  The components to achieve the most impressive 
technological power in Imperial and Regency history are present, but many 
detractors and obstacles stand in her way.  The coming decades will be crucial 
to Vincennes\' continued development both as a society and as a symbol of human 
innovative prowess.  Most believe Vincennes can overcome these obstacles, but at
best the planet\'s destiny remains shadowed in doubt.

I don\'t think that\'s necessarily true.  High technology does not equate 
with "boring adventure" opportunities.  I recall when Supplement 10, 
Solomani Rim, came out that I was surprised at the high tech levels 
throughout the sector.  It was explained that the Solomani Rim was an old 
and highly established area of space and therefore there was a lack of 
frontier-like low-tech worlds.  And yet that sector has produced some 
outstanding adventures.  

A smart ref can make any setting entertaining.  One way of doing so is to 
make the players\' opponents that much more technologically equipped, 
psionic or otherwise well-informed so as to deplete the technological 
advantage that high-tech-equipped characters have.  You don\'t have to be in 
the interstellar equivalent of the old west to conduct exciting and 
interesting adventures.

I think it\'s a misconception that you need to limit your PCs to about TL-12 
to make a good adventure.  It\'s definitely easier, but it doesn\'t _have_ to 
be that way.


Responding to Michael Bailey:

>>I\'m enjoying the response generated by that recent \'Request for Tender\'.
Seeing different approaches to the same general spec. has given me some new

Why don\'t we make this a regular thing...every so often, someone issues a
\'Request for Tender\'.  It doesn\'t have to be a competition, just a way of
showcasing different approaches to starship (and other vehicle) design.

Any takers?<<

Actually, yes!  I\'ve been pondering a more ideal design for a mercenary 
cruiser that is intended to house and transport a platoon-sized group of 
mercs into the wilds for long-term multi-ticket sweeps.  The ship would 
have to be well-armed and armored and capable of fairly long jumps to cross 
sparse stellar gaps.  I\'d like to see a design that was more built to duke 
it out than to run.  In other words, it doesn\'t have to be fast.

Also, what sort of special features might a mercenary cruiser have that 
hasn\'t been added in the past?  It should be designed between TL 13-16.  
I\'m not sure what the cost should be, but the players involved have about 
20-25 ship DMs between them.  I would guess that under MCr450-500 would be 
reasonable.  Have at!  I\'d love to see some designs that meet these 
parameters for eventual use in my ongoing merc campaign.  I may even have 
the ship be an opposing platoon of mercs who are out to destroy and board 
the Broadsword the players are currently operating.  Looking forward to 
seeing what you all come up with!

According to the RSB, the Alkhalikoi and Aledon familes are old allies.  
While it says nothing about familial relationships, allied noble houses 
would naturally intermarry.  I think that it is likely that the Emperor 
would be related to just about every great house.

True enough, but it\'s easy to tell :-)  Any ship that has a beam weapon
that is *not* a laser isn\'t using TL*50.  I can see fleets of ships just
big enough to hold and power a 800ROF non-gravfocused xray laser
that\'ll critical a tigress (about 100tons, i\'d expect, since the grav
focused version is 140tons). 

I guess BL would be a lot more like hide and seek with bazookas since
any halfway decent ship design would do multiple criticals any time it
hit (and none of the BL designs given are even close to halfway decent
FFS designs (assuming no rules modifications)).

Another thing about lasers... we assume that a laser can operate at any
DE below its maximum (useful for burning off surface features without
penetration, or reducing hits below a critical level)----you\'d have to
work out the damage of course.

I doubt I\'d do a design without TL*50 if it were requested (well, I
might try one ;-) since it\'s a lot of work for something that I couldn\'t
use myself.

Wow.  Two manipulative appendages up.


Some notes from the sourcebook, spoilers minimized:

Simple alien generation rules are sketched out for the Zhodani, Vargr,
Regency Aslan, and Darrians.  Cultural background on them, the Sword
Worlders, and the Islands Cluster are included.  A small enclave of
K\'kree lives at the Imperial Reserve on Marastan.

World data is based on the draft HIWG sector data, but has been altered
substantially.  It looks like a lot of thought went into the final UWPs
chosen, rather than just relying on random chance or raw growth rates. 

Check out Askigaak/Star Lane, population 100 billion plus.  It\'s the
only population-B world kept from the draft UWPs.  The most populous
world in the Regency, and one of the key worlds that the Regency has
invested heavily in, Askigaak has improved to tech-14, starport-B.
I suspect that will be starport-A shortly, but considering that the
world started with a class-E port.... 

The only continuity hiccup I\'ve seen so far are a couple of references
to Regina as the old sector capital.  Spinward Marches Campaign was the
first to identify Mora as sector capital, with the Cx code.  The 1117
UWPs have this correct, but there are a couple of comments in the text
that don\'t.  Otherwise, an outstanding job has been done keeping 
everything straight. 

A comment to FFS ship designers:  one of the designs in the back is for
a 55 displacement-ton "JBoat" that is jump capable, which validates the
theory that starships can now displace less than 100 tons, as the rules
seem to allow.  (So I guess my 20-ton XBoat design *is* legal now!)  :)

Not an error!  Allow me to pull a little Traveller factoid out of my

Howdy,

Not having a specific RFT yet, I\'ve renewed my efforts to do some old
Zho ships from TNE.  You should be seeing the TL13 Patrol Frigate and
its Fighters (man, it is really hard to make a 6g TL13 fighter come in
at 8 tons----damn, I was using HEPlaR...typing this made me realize
fusion rocket is the answer (with a 1g HEPlaR as well)) at the end of
the week.

Close on its heels will be the 2 different Patrol Corvettes.  All are at
600 tons and are from Expedition to Zhodane (the corvettes are at TL14,
BTW.

I was planning on posting fixes for the Zho ships in print as they are
stupid, really stupid (the strike cruiser is OK, actually).

All will obey the TL*50 laser maximum DE.

Anyone have a clue on the use of psionic scans at long ranges in TNE
htese days?  I was thinking with boosters an adept could have a short
range of around 1 BL hex (30,000km) for life detection.  This would be a
design issue from a crew standpoint.  In addition, I will post these
with a CT crew level.  Engineering, Electronic and Maint. crews will be
multiplied by 0.25.  I\'m not gonna add any integration hardware since
the \'puters are really really big already.

-Merrick

PS-has anyone else noticed that the published FFS designs are
inconsistant with the rules anyway regarding crew?  You can\'t have a
crew of 1 for the Rampart unless you wave your hands and make them go
away.  Why don\'t they codify this in the crew rules?  I guess the
engineering and maint. crews for the fighters are actually there, but on
the carrier, not the fighter.  But in any GDWs bent rules make my CT
crew levels seem OK----you could always call them the duty crew, and add
more for other shifts (a better way to figure crew, IMO----min. to
operate equipment, then multiply for the number of shifts needed.

I have no problem with this: however, it should be limited to one 
request every week or so.  And someone should be the offical 
"authorizer": while the rest of us can make suggestions, he\'s the one who 
actually gives out the spec\'s for the week.

Is there any Naval Review Board (or suchlike) out there?  How about they 
give us a design parameter, we post our designs, and they judge which one 
was best and why?

(True: we don\'t actually need to judge anyone\'s work, but I\'m interested 
in the opinions of why one ship is better than the rest.)

Of course, we can post suggestions here on TML.  And as always, we can 
just make a non-competition request for our own gaming needs.  However, 
I\'d like a regular competition...

I REALLY, REALLY need more capital ship designs.  Battle Rider Admirals, 
where are you??? :)

Does any member of the Naval Review Board care to select the best Diplo 
craft created?  Any prizes?

Also, will the original poster tell us which craft he chose, and why

NOTE: This vessel is only available to Regency Diplomatic Corps 
personnel: it is NOT available for private purchase at any price.

MAINTENANCE: The maintenance points shown are triple the FF&S figures: this 
is an experimental craft, the second TL H craft in Regency/Imperial 
history. [The first, produced 4 years ago, is a spy/survellance craft for 
Regency Naval Intelligence]

WEAPONRY: The Missile Turrent is usually kept recessed in the hull, 
outside of sight.  The only visible portion of the lasers are their Focal 
Lenses, which are the same size as standard laser turrents.  The only 
difference is in rated power consumption and tech used to make them, 
both of which are not visible to the naked eye.

CREW: Crew members added - although not demanded by the ship design - are 
the Sensor analyst ("Elect") and the Medical officer.

CONTROL: The special workstation is for the Ambassator\'s personal use.

TROOPS: The four Ship Troopers are under the command of the Captain, and 
are tasked with insuring the security of the ship.  The eight Troopers 
who are passengers are under the authority of the Ambassator: their 
primary concern is the security of the Ambassator and his staff. 

The Ship Troopers are usually Veteran Regency Marines: The Ambassator\'s 
men are Elite Marines.

Named after Baron Hiroyuki Mizutani of Suszko (61-142 Imperial), the 
chief Imperial negotiator responsible for the Ansurii Accords which 
ended the Vilani Pacification Campagins in Gushemege and Dagudashaag sectors.

The Mizutani-class vessels are part of the legendary "Vincennes Fleet", 
that is, a vessel that embodies the cutting edge of current Denebi 
technology.  Such ships tend to have more teething pains than your 
typical starship, which is based on centuries-old technology.  PC\'s using 
this vessel can expect more than there share of problems: Vincennes 
hasn\'t got all the bugs worked out, but the Regency Diplomatic Corps 
pushed for immediate (if very limited) production.

The interior of the ship (outside of the bridge) is decorated in the rich, 
pre-spaceflight (TL 1) Vilani Gunsemakuuni style from -11,300, panelled 
with real rekha wood and accented with genuine lenpikurbi stone furniture.  
This beautiful, but low-tech style is designed to put technophobic local 
governments at ease.  Music and service would be provided by the 
stewards, rather than automations.

I ran across a few minor problems while designing my TL 17 Diplo craft.
    1) The Jump drive used hydrogen for power, as well as coolant and mass.
       How much less fuel would a TL 17 jump drive consume, since it 
       wouldn\'t need hydrogen for fuel, and instead would use antimatter?
 
       [In my design, I just used a TL 16 jump drive]
    
    2) What are the stat\'s for TL 17 sandcasters? I basically 
       extrapolated some figures, but still...

Unrelated to my Diplomatic Cutter is a desire for disintergrators.  As I 
previously suggested, wouldn\'t it be nice for GDW to print an article 
regarding high-TL designing in Challange?

 "The Third Imperium is predominantly noted for being the first empire in 
which two branches of humanity held the regins of power cojointly.  It is 
also noteworthy for the unique blend of conservativism and vitality which 
this sharing of power produced....
  As a result, the Third Imperium achieved an impressive balance between 
expansion and consolidation, international vigor and domestic security.  
However, despite the longevity of the Third Imperium and its many 
noteworthy achievements, it is perhaps best remembered for its fragile 
governmental structure and its final, tragic disintergration."

 "Few of the fledging polities that attempted to band together against the 
onset of the Short Dusk (hard Times) lasted more than a few years.  Only 
a dozen or so survived long enough to be absorbed when the Safes of the 
post-Rebellion factions began to reexpand.  However, the fact that so 
many interstellar polities did strive to link themselves in common cause 
against the threat of social and technological recidivism offers insight 
into why the Short Dusk will not become another Long Night....
 "What many see as the death throes of the Imperium will soon be known as 
the growth pains hearlding the approach of a newer, more mature scheme of 
interstellar governance.  The Imperium is not dying of old age - it is 
experiencing childhood\'s end."

(Both quotations taken from the MegaTraveller supplement Hard Times, 
describing situations from 1125 to post-1128. Copywrited by GDW, 1991)

Now, if you look carefully at the first quite, you\'d find a major, major 
bit of information missing - any mention of Virus.  And if you look at 
the second quote, you\'d find what almost everyone expected would 
eventually happen to Charted Space, post-Rebellion.  True, the Imperium 
would still be dead, but it would have been replaced by about a dozen New 
Empires (ie. nations that consider themselves sucessors to the Imperium) 
and New Republics (ie. nations that wish to found a completely new form of 
government) governments.  The political situation would resemble Europe 
after Rome, or maybe South America after the Spanish Empire.

Question: Assuming that Traveller: The New Era was published 1992 (I 
don\'t have the book with me), had GDW decided to brew up Virus by the 
time Hard Times was published?

Irony: Has the universe continued in it\'s usual, non-Virus way, the 
quotes above would have been completely accurate.  Moreover, in such a 
fractured environment, rebuilding the Imperium would, indeed, be impossible.

Ooops: I just forgot about our Solomani friends.  Was this the reason why 
GDW created Virus, to prevent the Solomani\'s from conquering everything?
Hmmm....

Anyways, we now have a very odd situation.  The Imperium is dead - 
almost.  But that _almost_ has a very, very big ace up it\'s sleeve.
Very intersting times, indeed.

Obviously, I need the Regency Sourcebook.  I\'ll probably end up getting 
it a month from now, the way things are going. Ughhh.

Request for Tender: Congress of Rimward States

Anti-Piracy Enforcer

Tech Level      : A-C
Cost            : See Description
Minimum Jump    : 3 (4 preferred)
Maneuver        : See Description
Armament        : See Description

In the Unconsolidated Areas of the territory claimed by the
Congress, and in Unclaimed Areas outside this territory, Piracy is
becoming a problem.  The current Congress policy of Escorts for
important cargoes has proven successful; however, its success is
only as a deterrent to attacks on shipping, and is not viable from
an economic point of view, as insufficient force exists to
maintain escorts for all shipping.  A recent resolution of the
Congress Assembled mandates active measures to make the spaceways
safe for unescorted ships. The Force Command has requested ships to
act as "poisoned bait" for the pirates.  These ships are the
subject of this Request for Tender.

Ship designs submitted under this tender shall be capable of
simulating the appearance, signatures, and behavior of classes of
ships in commercial service within the Congressional Trade Area.
These include, but are not limited to, former Imperial and Solomani
designs designated as Free Traders, Far Traders, Subsidized
Merchants, Subsidized Liners, and Yachts (the "corresponding
representative types").  However, ships procured under this Tender
are to be capable of sustaining defensive integrity and promoting
successful offensive actions in single combat against _Gazelle_
class vessels, which are the heaviest known to be in use by outlaw
gangs.  It is preferred that pirate vessels be captured intact for
appropriation by the Congress.

The Force Command has indicated extreme reluctance to consider
designs for which production would cost more than 200% of the cost
of the corresponding representative type for the vessel.  When
calculating costs, the discount for standard design production
should not be used for either the Enforcer or its corresponding
representative type.

The proposed Congressional designation of these classes of ships,
for the purposes of this tender, shall be

                <crt class name> Enforcer (<crt>)-<tl>
                (crt is "corresponding representational type)

For example, a tender for an Enforcer that emulates a Free Trader
might be designated

                Beowulf-Class Enforcer (Free Trader)-B

if it presents the appearance, signature, and behavior of a
Beowulf-class Free Trader.

Designs that do not mirror existing classes, but which do present
the appearance, signature, and behavior of the corresponding
representational type, shall be considered with no penalty.  It
would be appreciated if explanations for class designations for
such designs would be included.

Hey terrans,

My previous comment about doing an 8 ton fighter was premature.  It\'s
impossible to make it 6g.  Check out their Rampart design! It doesn\'t
work!  Look at the masses, and the thrust.  The Rampart given to us in
BL can do just less than 3g when it\'s empty.  The Armed Gig can\'t do
better than 0.8g *unloaded*.  Of the GDW designs I\'ve checked *none*
actually work.  What the hell is the deal?  I mean, hell, the masses are
in the top group of general info on every design they published!  Didn\'t
anyone bother to do the simple division required?

Ahem.  Sorry, the lack of any testing or the fact that they find an
editor an unneeded expense is beginning to bug me.

I take it that canon designs don\'t actually have to have anything to do
with the rules posted in FFS.  The idea of FFS isn\'t just that we can
create our own stuff, it\'s that if we do we can share it and it\'ll be
consistent... and it will be for all of us, just not anything GDW
publishes.  Yeesh.

The starships are closer (like 3.57g instead of 4, etc.), but but it\'s
still annoying.  On the big ones we can get ships to come within the
tons*15 mass requirement, but it is *impossible* on smaller ships at
more than about 3gs acceleration.

I like the mass requirements because if you look at the weapons you find
that lasers are most dense, then PAWs, and MGs have the best mass to
volume ratio of the lot... a reason to use them when the designs are
tight.  It just never occurred to me to check their designs for that kind
of glaring error, even if they didn\'t design ships that made any sense
as FFS designs.  What slop.  *sigh*

So, any ideas on what to do for a fighter design? (using "canon" FFS)

Comments from GDW?  Help even?

Sorry for the rant, but I\'ve had a frustrating time with this crap.

The first request for a design was made over a week ago, and the designs
are still coming in. In order to space out the designs, allow people enough
time to peruse each design, and prevent designers from getting burnt-out,
I would recommend reducing commissions to once a month. This is still 12
commissions * multiple designs (NOT counting ad-hocs) per year!!!

This also allows folks time to play their campaigns ;-) and think up new,
interesting design needs (the standard stuff can be found in the sourcebooks).

The idea of a moderator (a central point to send commission requests to,
and who then decides what commission to ask for) is not a bad idea, BUT
this could limit the commissions to those that the person wants for
*their* campaign. Perhaps a moderator can gather the requests and post them
in a standard format. The designers can vote on the "Commission of the Month",
and go and build the thing.

A question. What is the status of transponder use in TNE?  Are the same 
chips and that still used, but completely isolated from the rest of the 
ship-net?

This came up in a discussion between Liam McCauley and myself. I\'ve always 
assumed that `normal\' transponder units were sealed units which transmitted 
a message on a loop. The unit had two settings - on and off. I also recall 
programmable transponders (from the Traveller Adventure I think, but it\'s 
been a while since I read it).

Liam seems to be of the opinion that the transponders were always hooked 
into the internal ships net (and now he comes to mention it, I think I\'ve 
seen mention somewhere in TNE of Virus passing from ship to ship via 
transponders).

Anyone?

Is this limited to starships, or are other vehicles or weapons okay?

I\'d like to see one of Niven\'s flashlight lasers (TL G?). I tried it once,
but working things out for about a dozen wavelengths (I made it tunable)
nearly made my calculator spontaneously combust...

I\'m interested. I might not be able to take up every design brief, but this

-Ludicrously large non grav focussed laser batteries :-) 
-Some large mass drivers for planetary bombardment
-A proper fighter squadron. I\'m just guessing, but with a single non grav 
focussed laser lance, you could probably build some very small but effective 
fighters by TL16. An 800ton ship could probably carry four or five without too 
much compromise.

As I didn\'t really believe that GDW would ever actually -finish- the 
Regency book, I didn\'t preorder it.  Bad mistake.  I contacted GDW via 
email for the book, but have yet to get a price + shipping.

If anyone here is willing to buy a copy and mail it to me, I\'d be 
thankful.  Please email me to make arrangements.

(as is self-evident, I want it BADDDD!)

I made a "standard" zhodani turret at 4 tons last night that is made up
of 2 focal arrays sharing an HPG.  The tunable is grav focused and has a
DE of 186MJ, with a Reff of 1 (beefed up for ROF:800) and the other is
an xray laser with no grav focusing----700MJ, ROF:100.  Pretty mean and
still within TL*50.  I think that mixed grav and non grav focused
arrays in the same turret will make it possible to have decent lower TL
turrets that fit in the standard size socket.

It brought up a question, however:

Why are any of the published lasers actually used?  Any ship could have
a nasty laser, and the only problem might be power.  What does anyone
think of the idea that all lasers (er, well designed ones) can critical
a size S ship?  I actually don\'t mind.  I\'ll do the TL15 150MJ laser up
as a good design and post it.  It can be dropped in instead of the
crappy one used. It\'ll make that first shot nasty enough to be worth
worrying about (anyone who\'s played a bunch of BL is familiar with just
how nasty those first bizillion fuel hits can be ;-)

> -Some large mass drivers for planetary bombardment

I\'d think TAC missiles would be better since it seems like you\'d want
smart projectiles anyway, and you have gravity on your side :-)

They\'ll be limited in gs.  I got my 8ton up to 5 gs with a lot of work.
It gets nasty once mass is a factor...  BTW, the RC Clippers can do
about 0.8 gs (yes, I did take into account tons*15 (as slop for tons*10)
by multiplying by 15/14).  I always hated those garbage scows.  In order
to get 5 gs out of my fighter it has a HEPlaR drive that would produce
15 gs without the mass correction.  6 gs can\'t be done for a fighter
that small, I\'ll see what the size cutoff is (I *like* this fact, BTW,
but I hate the fact that the Rampart and Gig cheat (and not a little)).

I think the Rampart is possible at TL15, but the laser might get smaller
(or go non-grav focused).

That IS how Virus was transmitted from ship to ship and from ship to

I\'ve noticed that GDW tends not to check the thrust-to-mass ratio in
their designs, too.  They seem to forget that armor is really going to
weigh down small craft.  Otherwise, the designs seem okay.

>So, any ideas on what to do for a fighter design? (using "canon" FFS)

The Rampart is salvagable.  The mass of the thing just needs to be 
cut down a little.  The heaviest optional components are armor and the
laser.  Here\'s my solution.  Change the following entries in the 
standard Rampart (RF-128) listing. 

Hull Armor:   56
Price:        MCr 23.04
Mass:         160.8/157.1 tons [with missiles, 188.8 tons]
Power Plant:  70 MW Fusion (70 MW/hit), 1 month duration
G-Rating:     6G (8.125 MW/G) [5G with missiles], CG Lifters (5 MW)
G-Turns:      52.3, 1.035 cubic meters ea. [43.5, 1.219 cu. m w/missls.]
Maint:        3
Offensive:    1 x TL15 72 MJ laser lance (Loc. 1; Arc 1; 2 MW; no crew)
                   10:(1/6)-21  20:(1/6)-21  40:(1/3)-11  80:(1/2)-5
              4 x USL grapples for standard missiles

Armor was lightened, the laser size halved, and a HEPlaR drive with
975 tons thrust installed in place of the old drive.  The damage table
only requires minor changes (and it had a minor bug or two to begin 
with).  Crew is still one, Maneuver/Gunner.

Here\'s something of my own.  The following additional changes result
in a conversion of the old RF-128-2 Rampart two-place missile fighter.

Price:      MCr 23.30
Mass:       157.1/120.3 tons [missile load included in loaded]
G-Rating:   6G (8.125 MW/G) [8G empty], CG Lifters (5MW)
G-Turns:    59.8, 1.035 cubic meters ea. [81.3, 0.762 cu. m ea. empty]
Commo:      5 x 1000 AU maser
Controls:   2 x workstation
Offensive:  4 x USL grapples for standard missiles
Crew:       2 (Maneuver, Commander/Gunner)
Airlocks:   2 hatches
 
A hatch is a 2 square meter surface area, MCr 0.002 excuse not to
install an airlock in a fighter.  :)  The original RF-128-2 was a
missile fighter that was also used as the squadron commander\'s
craft and as a trainer.  The laser has been deleted, a second
workstation and commo suite installed, and the space left is now
additional maneuver fuel.  It also turns out that removing the
laser gives up just as much mass as a full load of missiles needs,
so this craft suffers no acceleration penalty to carry missiles.

The damage tables only require minor tweaking.

BONUS INFORMATION:  Two TL-15 laser lances.  Both need remote crew.

144MJ  28.387 kL  53.59 tons  4 MW  MCr 0.59  1.31 sq. m.
   10:(1/10)-30  20:(1/10)-30  40:(1/4)-15  80:(1/2)-7; No crew.
 72MJ  15.787 kL  28.39 tons  2 MW  MCr 0.46  1.31 sq. m.
   10:(1/6)-21  20:(1/6)-21  40:(1/3)-11  80:(1/2)-5; No crew.

Cool stuff.  Unfortunately the fix you posted is illegal if you don\'t
trash the silly armor requirements.  I would be happy to ignore the
gs*10 armor requirement myself as it is just plain dumb (given the
bracing requirement of internal structure), but if I post designs that
ignore it no one else can use it (unless they trash the rule).

This is unlike the TL*50 limit since any designs that use it are still
legal for people that don\'t use it (even if they would be weak designs).

I actually like the fact that the sub 10 ton craft are hard to make with
lots of gs----a trade between hard to lock, or high g.

Any ideas on how to fudge the crew thing?

  I had noticed similar things with various designs, but had assumed I 
was either doing the math wrong, or misreading the rules... ;)  But it 
ties in interestingly with the other major thread running on this mailing 
list...

  So - how about this request for tender...

  All the designs in the basic rule-book, but actually *following* the 
FFS design rules. :)

  Now, I know that some people may have done this already... and some of 
the designs are *definitely* non-optimal (grav-tank, anyone? :), but it\'d 
be handy to have *some* designs that actually *follow* the rules... :)

It is priced very highly. It was 15 for a 92 page book, although the text size 
is somewhat smaller than Path of Tears etc. The price on the back is $20, which 
is already pretty steep, and with the price of importing it, this is getting 
far too expensive. GDW may well make a profit from Traveller players who are 
willing to pay this price, but it won\'t increase the popularity of Traveller 
with a wider audience. These high prices are likely to frighten off new players 
who otherwise might try Traveller, which is a great shame.
First impressions:
Looks good. The first part of the book is densely packed with cultural 
information on most of the significant races in the Marches, and background for 
the Regency. The core of the book is the full subsector maps with UWPs and 
notes on around five worlds/places of interest per subsector. Then the book is 
rounded off by some of the most creative published starships I\'ve ever seen, 
and then the obligatory adverts. (Including that RAFM miniatures ad which still 
hasn\'t been corrected - They still offer \'Ship\'s Boasts\' and \'Asian

If you don\'t mind trashing the min armor, you can get most of \'em into
compliance.  The Aurora is ***way*** off, however.  My TL13 Zhodani
Patrol Frigate will be posted today or tomorrow.  I took the liberty of
using the CT crew.  Otherwise it wouldn\'t exist (actually the crew is
like 20% higher than CT).  Without a spreadsheet it\'d be damn near
impossible for someone to design a ship this tight, or any small craft
to some predetermined g rating since everything ends up being dependant
on mass.

Since it\'ll be the people on the list who use any of this, I\'d like to
see a yeas and nays on trashing the gs*10 minimum armor rule, and what
the group thinks about pre-virus crew levels (I use the HAIS levels, but
without equipment, and assume that they\'d be pushovers for the virus).

I\'ll compile results if people wanna vote on this...

Change minimum armor (to 10, say?): Yes or No
	If yes, then what level? (10, 20, etc.)

Have pre Virus crews for old ships, or non-RC use: Yes or No
	If yes, then what levels?  (.25xEng., Elec., and Maint. crews,
	then recalulate dependant crews (command, stewards, etc.)


This would be for RFT designs, at the very least.  Standard FFS designs
would always be acceptable as well.

Okay.  I must have forgotten about the rule because I was too busy
chuckling at it.  (Velocity, not acceleration, darn it!) :)  I took
another look, and most of the mass I saved came off the laser.  So I
put the 7.7 tons of armor back on and upped the HEPlaR engine to 1021
tons thrust, and increased the power plant to match....

Changes to my changes are below.  Each line supersedes original line in
the design; RF-128-2 takes changes from RF-128, then apply its\' changes.

Rampart RF-128

Hull Armor:   62
Price:        MCr 23.13
Mass:         169.5/165.8 tons (loaded ignores possible missile load)
Power Plant:  72.3 MW Fusion (72.3 MW/hit), 1 month duration
G-Rating:     6G (8.5 MW/G), CG Lifters (5 MW)
G-Turns:      48.8, 1.0635 cubic meters ea.
Maint:        3
Offensive:    1 x TL15 72 MJ laser lance (Loc. 1; Arc 1; 2 MW; no crew)
                   10:(1/6)-21  20:(1/6)-21  40:(1/3)-11  80:(1/2)-5
              4 x USL grapples for standard missiles

Rampart RF-128-2

Hull Armor:   62
Price:        MCr 23.39
Mass:         165.8/129 tons (loaded includes missile load @ 7 tons ea.)
G-Rating:     6G (8.5 MW/G), CG Lifters (5 MW)
G-Turns:      57.1, 1.0635 cubic meters ea.
Commo:        5 x 1000 AU maser
Controls:     2 x workstation
Offensive:    4 x USL grapples for standard missiles
Crew:         2 (Maneuver, Commander/Gunner)
Airlocks:     2 hatches

If you take the missile grapples off the laser-armed Rampart, you
can convert the space to fuel tankage and get up to 51 G-turns. 

>Any ideas on how to fudge the crew thing? 

It looks like the only jobs that can be held simultaneously with another
job are vehicle commander and gunner, judging by existing designs, and 
this is only done on very small vehicles.  In old Traveller, you could 
do this, but there were penalties to skill rolls if you did.  Maybe some
similar thing could be done here.

Here is the Zhodani Patrol Frigate from Adventure 6: Expedition to Zhodane.
The 8 ton fighter will follow.  I had to ignore the surface area requirement of
an open frame hull because it was stupid :-)  It required the ship to use the 
unmodified MVM, giving it the same area as a sphere (the lowest possible).  Open
frames should have the *most* area, not the least.  Yeesh, what stupidity.

Notes
----				
Loaded Mass includes fighters, shuttle, and all their missiles.  With craft ship
is 2g (375MW/g).  Without craft aboard it is 3g (250MW/g).  This is a tight 
ship.  The maint. crewman operates the missile launcher (loading, more or less).
The lasers are usually operated remotely from the MFD in the bridge by the idle 
crewman assigned to the second maneuver station (jump).  Being an older design 
in widespread use it is frequently improved.  Sometimes the large staterooms are
used with double occupancy to accommodate extra gunners, or a psionic adept at
life form searches.  TL14 turrets are sometimes dropped into the sockets to 
improve performance.  The 4 ton standard Zhodani sockets installed for the 
laser and missile turrets allow various specialized armaments (all laser, all 
missile, etc.).  Some have a reduced fighter squadron using the added volume as 
cargo (in a pod), or to carry 8 ton RPVs for remote sensor operations.
 
The fighters carry 3 S/FI HEPlaR missiles each---- usually armed with a 500kt 
det-laser warhead.  
 
The PF has a dome shaped main hull, connected to a tapering engineering section 
in the rear by a boom-like structure with 5 arms branching a short distance to 
each side of the boom (one branches upwards).  The fueler is accessed via the 
bottom of the boom (at the rear of the dome, actually), and the missile turret 
is above nearby (to facilitate reloading from the fueler).  The fighters each 
share an airlock with another fighter at the end of the armlike structures where
the docking grapples are mounted.
 
----
TL13 650/173MJ Laser Turret (Zhodani standard, 4 tons)
 
This turret shares an HPG for a non-grav focused xray laser, and a smaller 
grav-focused tunable laser for atmospheric use.  Both may be fired at the same 
target as well, since the xray laser may only fire at a ROF of 100, and the HPG does 800.  Power quoted above is for 10 shots from either laser array.

here\'s the 8 ton fighter.  It was supposed to be 6g.  It doesn\'t have a
laser, so there really wasn\'t any way to get the gs up without trashing
the armor rule.

The HEPlaR Missile used on TL13 Zho ships is listed at the bottom.  It
is a S/FIM.  A controlled-only version was also made, but the flexibilty
of the S/FIM makes it a superior weapon.  The PF carries 6 reloads (more
if a/some fighter(s) are replaced with reloads in 8 ton pods.

There is almost no info on what happened during the Long Night. You
would need to scratch around and gather it in from many and varied
sources. Off the cuff, I can think of the following:
   - brief references to the Sylean Federation, pre-Third Imperium (MT
     Encyc et al, possibly some old Lib Data);
   - various articles about pocket empires for MT and TNE
     contain some info about how the area fared during the Long Night.
     Specifically, I think that there are sketchy details available
     for the Duchy of Oasis, the Old Expanses, the Hinterworlds,
     that mob that the RCES has just contacted (can\'t remember their
     name, sorry), and the Geonee (Challenge and Digest articles).

There is actually less info about what happened during the Long Night
than there is background DM info about the future of the RCES. ;-)

        Maybe they should go ahaead and do FF&S part deux: the REST of the
design Sequences. Only via TML have I heard much about Challenge at all.

I haven\'t seen a new issue of challenge at the local game store in over a
year... and haven\'t purchased one in over 2. No one I know gets it locally.
We all purchase the new materials, and so far the emphasis shown has all
been towards TL=BE13, and a distinct shying away from TL>15.

I feel it\'s about time for GDW to wake up and smell the coffee: we want the
WHOLE RANGE of material, not just "dark traveller".

As a side note, I was seriously DISSAPOINTED by RSB: it adds one usefull
bit of rules, and treats the Darriens, Aslan, Vargr, and Zho\'s in the same,
useless manner that Hiver and Ithklur treats the Hivers: they are just "Man
in Suit" aliens. Not So! And as for the lack of Proles in the Gen Sequence
for Zho\'s: Follow the old rules: proles are only elevated to intendant if
their Psi is 9+, and lessers are not allowed training.

Also, I expected to see a correction or two to the carreer list, and an
addition or two... NONE of these were there. What do I feel is wrong?

        1) Merchants cannot get steward except as a hobby.
        2) the Scout carreer does not accurately reflect the IISS (Has the
           RISS changed so much?)
        3) There is no carreer for Serving Nobles... Wealthy Traveller isn\'t
           quite right for them, although for terminal nobles and titular no=
bles
           it works.
        4) there was no RQS CGen. Do they Use Navy, Scout, or something uniq=
ue?

Also, they mention the X-Web, but give no real data.

Good idea.  Of course maintenance is a bit kooky anyway regarding
breakdowns.  I think if I designed my Honda in FFS it\'d spend a lot more
time not running :-)

Yeah, but take the electronic crew as an example... why a different
guy for each sensor?  I\'d rather see an integrated display, that way a
bunch of "bogey" type detections might paint a better picture of the
target.  And the new engineering crew levels make me think they\'re
stoking the HEPlaR drive with shovels.

I said it in the posts before, but the ship I posted used a reduced crew
level.  As the crew levels are in the designs they are higher than CT,
but a crew 14 ship having 39 crew made it damn hard to live with.  I\'ll
post the "real" FFS crew levels if you want.  They\'ll just have to be
really friendly and hot-bunk.

Okay, here\'s our house rule: 
    - Minimum external armor is AV 1; (enuff to hold the air in). 
    - Internal structure uses (G*10) rule, as per book, because 
that\'s the bracing for acceleration.
    - It is advisable to put some kind of Meteor Screen (ESA) on
ships that have thin armor, or the maintenance requirement goes
up from micrometeorite damage and dust erosion...

Haven\'t worked this one out yet, but some considerations we have
already adopted:

   -- small interface craft (orbiters, etc) can use Aircraft crewing rather
than
spaceship crew rules.
  -- Anything with a ground crew, (e.g. ground- or carrier-launched
fighters),
that ground crew is most of your maintenance and engineering crew. They 
don\'t need to be accomodated in the craft.
  -- need some provision for figuring skeleton crew sizes; the ship can
operate
with this size crew, but can\'t fight worth spit, and maintenance goes to hell

in a handbasket.

	As we\'ve covered before, I think, most likely ALL ship\'s systems are 
disconnected, but most certainly all communications systems are. In 
fact, they\'re probably off in a separate, shielded compartment in the 
ship, a la the old radio rooms on ships, because I\'m sure there was a 
virus out there that learned it could infect nearby systems by the 
proper modulation and induction of signals in nearby systems. 

	Transponders have almost certainly fallen into disfavor...what goes 
on now is more like a "Talk or I\'ll shoot" scenario, where Uhura 
opens a hailing frequency, and if the other ship doesn\'t respond, 
they get shot at as probable hostile.

	Leads to a lot of chattiness, but this is almost certainly how those 
lonely free traders managed to survive...it\'d be hard for a Virus to 
emulate a human, and almost certainly a human that the other person 
knows.

	This brings to my mind an interesting speculation on Free Trader
society. Since various sources have mentioned that the ships are run
in a clan-like atmosphere, there\'s a LOT of fostering; sending young
clan members to live on other ships.

	If you have a relative on board the other ship A) you\'re a lot less
likely to shoot at it, and B) there\'ll also be someone on board yopu
can talk to, to confirm that the ship isn\'t a virus.

	This also leads to lots of chances to cement bonds between clans, 
via intermarriage, plus it tends to increase rather than decrease 
diversity in the gene pool.

	Of course, then you could always have the Capulets and Montagues 
going at it.

	There\'s an extensive explanation of the transponders in Survival 
Margin...a handy little guide once you get your \'between the lines 
reading\' up to speed..if, of course, GDW doesn\'t disown everything 
they said in it. Basically the boxes were doing a lot more than just 
saying \'Hi! I\'m the Free Trader Beowulf. My registration number is 
6574872GTr7734-0032!\' over and over again, but was actually 
monitoring the entire ships behavior to the point where it would say, 
on it\'s own initiative: \'Hi! I\'m the Free Trader Beowulf, and Captain 
Bligh here stole me!\'

	Of course, this is only if you accept the kind of stuff GDW writess 
about computers.

	But, since there was so much traffic going back and forth between
ships all the time, and since the transponders were comparing notes
on the universe as they knew it, that the extra bandwidth and
storage to allow Virus to get in and take over were built in as a
normal feature.

	The transponders were behaving a bit like domain name servers, 
always chatting about who they know, who\'s moved, who\'s not around 
any more...Yeesh  I\'d better look into the back of that DEC for a 
little black box...;-)

I got this off the gdw-beta list, and it seems to work pretty well for me. I

more than 3 computers installed.  Maybe the volume of the computers includes
enough control linkages to cover a size Small ship, and bigger ones either
need another set of 3 computers or pay for the HAIS equipment.

I would add that the stewards and med crew should be based on the new numbers,

a crew of 20?).

Good stuff this.  Unless there is massive support against it, I\'d like to see 
this used.  I gives results about like MT.  Vampire ships will frequently be
HAIS designds since they were the original ships, and they are easier to
infect anyway.

With bigger ships the quarters could just be assumed to be packed with more
crew than designed for (adding bunks to singles, etc.).  You can have a NPC 
talk about how nice it would\'ve been to be on the DD in the old days with 
your own room, etc.----or the nice tennis courts on the BBs that\'re now used
as a mess hall.

The smaller ships are really tight to design without HAIS if you want them to
be close to the CT/MT designs you know and love.

Hi,

this had been talked about before once...  it made me think about fusion rockets
again.  I\'d think that once dampers are common, then fusion rockets should
have some kind of improvement.  Didn\'t Cynthia post a fix for this at some 
point?  The thrust should go up per drive volume, IMO.  The gturns could stay as
they are.  It\'d help the Leviathan to no end.  It\'d still do a lot of micro-
jumping.  Maybe the craft could be fitted with Jdrives as well.

NOTES

The Gushiken-Class Free Trader was designed by Ling Standard Products for 
operation in the Vincennes Cluster.  The Vincennes Trade and Commerce 
Commission (VTCC) sponsored the design for sale to traders who operate in 
the 11-system Vincenzi Jump-1 route.  The VTCC has configured a network of 
far traders to operate as interface traders at Irumunu, Achemedon, HRD and 
Perez systems for shipment of goods beyond the reaches of the Vincennes 
Cluster.

Most Gushiken-Class traders do not carry armament as the level of stability 
in the region does not warrant it.  However, many traders travelling the 
HRD route, which approaches Usani Subsector and the frontier, choose to arm 
their ships against possible Vampire incursions or pirates.

The Gushiken is designed for maximum cargo capacity for shipments of 
popular Vincenzi communications, computer and novelty technology to the 
other worlds of the Vincennes Cluster.  Though the Jump-1 region is small 
by Regency standards, Gushiken traders frequently find they still don\'t 
have the space to accommodate the amount of cargo and freight available.

Approximately a dozen Gushiken traders have converted their drives to 
Jump-2 for operation beyond the Vincennes Cluster.  The reason for doing 
this is to cut the losses incurred by interface far trader freight costs. 
Most find, however, that the cost of refitting the ship and the lost 
cargo capacity do not justify the modification.

A problem.  But I suppose that you could always have a simple fix like
changing the Interaction in the spacehand\'s Subsequent Term section to
Charm, or adding Service to the Interaction cluster, either of which
make sense in the Regency.  Passenger liners might hire Entertainers of
a certain stripe as stewards; special duty does include the Spacehand
cluster.

What do nobles do?  High and rank nobles work in the government -- so
use Bureaucrat.  Maybe, like Norris, they make their start in the Regency
Navy first.  A job as Diplomat to one of the Spinward States or as consul
on a member world would be fitting.  If they\'re well off and of that sort
of mind, a term as Wealthy Traveller would work, too.  A terminal noble
might turn into a dangerous Rebel.

At tech-13, 5G, and fifty G-turns!  I\'m impressed that you squeezed 5G
out of it, what with tech-13 fusion power plants and all.  Nice ship.

It\'s tough.  I don\'t use spreadsheets, myself, but I have a collection
of simplified formulae that help me out.  For instance, GDW tends to
change units at the drop of a hat, which makes life miserable for ship
designers.  An example of this is the awful paragraph on how to build
a HEPlaR drive, which switches from 0.1 cubic meters, to cubic meters,
to megawatts, to fuel per hour when what you want is fuel per turn! It
could all be summarized as: 

Per cubic meter of HEPlaR chamber:

MASS     MW     MCr   SURFACE AREA    TONS THRUST    FUEL/turn
1 ton    10     0.01  1 sq. meter     200            1.25 cubic meters

Which, incidentally, when compared to the thrusters on the "Self-Contained
Thrusters" table in FF&S shows how screwy those numbers are in comparison.

For sensor crews, I assume that a crewmember can\'t really \'watch\' more than
one sensor, but that their workstation can get all the data.  Thus, you can
reduce sensor crews at the cost of runnign fewer sensors or extra diff mods
(for multiple coverage).  I also assume that in CT times all ships used
transponders, and so you didn\'t need that many people monitoring sensors on
civilian craft.

(I should note that I also like civilian craft to have fewer crewmembers but
be harder to fight than military craft, and this worked well by handicapping
the average freighter in a fight.)

     This vessel is designed for light survey, and most of the roles of the
scout courier. The dual turrets are often configured for special roles. It is
not uncommon for a cargo capsule to replace 1 of the turrets. Both turrets are
standard 3 ton sockets. Due to the extreme amount of surplus power, and the fact
that the turrets are each rated for up to 100MW apiece, the vessel can pump
laser turrets up quite a ways.
      Note that this class is hull and structurally rated for 4 G\'s, but can
only generate 2 G\'s of thrust. This is not a typo, error, or oversight, but is
very much intentional. The overage is intended for atmospheric manuvering
couretesy of the airframe design.

      The Tornado is a 4 person air/raft for scout use. It is equipped with many
of the same sensors as the S-2A Serpent it\'s assigned to, it can be used for
limited space observation, and both low speed indefinite surface ops or short
bursts of hypersonic travel. The accomodations are uncomfortable, but allow for
a good collection of samples. Due to the need for limited signature and minimum
environmental hazard, most surface or low altitude operations are done on the
ducted fans.
      This vehicle is not suitable for use in insidious or corrosive atmospheres
due to the ducted fan systems, although the design is suitable for emergency use
in such conditions.

      The VGU-23A is a TL-15 design which replaces the PP and Computer, and
Terrain Following Avionics with uprated designs. It gets slightly different
performance, and has no power shortage.
      This vehicle is not suitable for use in insidious or corrosive atmospheres
due to the ducted fan systems, although the design is suitable for
emergency use
in such conditions.

Notes
----				
The fighters carry 3 S/FI HEPlaR missiles each---- usually armed with a
500kt det-laser warhead.  

Use the TL13 8 ton fighters posted previously.

This ship while Wedge SL, is actually more of a squashed cone, tapering
slightly to the rear, with short "wings" for fuel skimming operations.
Fuel purification takes 48 hours for the total jump fuel (43.75kl/hr).

The cargo area is adjacent to all missile turrets and typically holds 10
spare missiles.

This design trades maneuver for its fighters.  Another common version
has 4 instead of 3 missile turrets, and no laser.  Add a Missile Turret,
and remove the LT, nothing else changes.
 
 
----
TL14 700/186.6MJ Laser Turret (Zhodani standard, 4 tons)
 
This turret shares an HPG for a non-grav focused xray laser, and a smaller 
grav focused tunable laser for atmospheric use.  Both may be fired at the same 
target as well, since the xray laser may only fire at a ROF of 100, and the 
HPG does 800.  Power quoted above is for 10 shots from either laser array.
The xray laser is std at ROF100, the tunable is beefed to ROF800.  They
may both be fired at once for the same power input as long as the total
ROF isn\'t above 800.

This is another non-compliant design in terms of crew.  I used the HAIS
stuff again, but without the equipment.  Above 999 tons, I\'ll add
computers, or HAIS gear.

If you added bunks in the staterooms, the TNE crew would fit.  There
aren\'t enough workstations, however----take off a few gturns and they\'d
all fit.

         I was designing an surface to orbit fighter which had contra-grav
         plates and it set me thinking:  If a ship has contra grav, why
         does it have to have an acceleration of greater than 1G to get
         offworld?  Since contra-grav negates 99% of the gravitational
         attraction of the world on the ship, I would think that the ship
         would only need more that .01G acceleration to take off (albeit
         VERY slowly) from a 1G world.  After all, it doesn\'t matter how
         long it takes you to accumulate the needed delta-v for orbital
         insertion, as long as you have covered the losses due to
         "slippage".  In a similar vein, when landing the ship could drop,
         unpowered, from orbit and only accelerate at 0.098 m/sec^2.  It
         would only take a minimal amount of thrust (<.01G) to keep the
         absolute speed low on landing.  In addition, in either case the
         ship would be able to lift or descend almost vertically onto the
         landing site (so no need for long runways).  

         If all of the above is true, then why can\'t an unstreamlined ship
         land on a planetary surface?  Both the landing and takeoff speeds
         could be kept below 300 kph (the max speed for an unstreamlined
         vehicle in orbit).  At a 250 kph descent rate it would only take
         an hour to move above the level of the atmosphere, and that could
         be accomplished using a .07G-Hour burn to get to 250 kph, plus
         .01G-hour per hour of travel to compensate for the gravitational
         pull not negated by the contra-grav.

         Granted, this would not be the fastest way to move to and from
         LPO, but it would allow surface refueling of unstreamlined ships,
         and easy loading and unloading of cargo.  It would also allow
         mercant ships to be quite cheap (maybe even cheap enough to make
         standard Imperial freight and passenger rates profitable).  An
         unstreamlined ship landing would be quite a sight - a ship
         descending sloooooowly from the clouds, thrusters firing
         intermittently, and settling into it\'s berth.

         So where\'s the flaw in this image (except that it blows GDW cannon
         out of the water)?

Well, a few weeks back I\'d have said "Hey, no probs. Heap big TNE-career
system about to appear in Traveller Chronicle (for Vargr) and Signal-GK (for
Aslan)." Unfortunately, as the author of both articles I was horrified to
hear that the RSB covers them in some (limited?) detail. I\'m still waiting
for my copy of RSB, so I can update both articles to ensure no major
disparities.

However, my articles do not attempt to copy (or even paraphrase) the
cultural data from the older books since this has obvious copyright
implications.

Well, my Vargr and Aslan systems should match the skill and career
availability for the MT and CT alien books, so hopefully they\'re quite
faithful. Assuming they get into print, perhaps some of you gents would be
kind enough to feed back on them? I\'d like to know I\'m doing it right before
I get on to the Zhodani, et al. (what the H*ll\'s this \'wave\' thingy
anyway?)... >:-(

SHIP RFTs / DECK PLANS

Brilliant idea. Go for it people. With all those examples buzzing around I
might finally take in the FF&S design sequence.

Anyone willing to pay for hardcopies of plans of these babies? I\'m quite
willing to draw up 15mm/25mm ship designs if the ship\'s designer agrees and
someone will pay. They could even be colour if the price is right...

Well, they might be right for once. SSR (secondary surveillance radar) used
for current ATC (air traffic control) puts quite a lot of data back and
forth to aid control of air space, e.g. what height the craft is at (gives a
secondary check against what your radar says), how much fuel it\'s got
left... AND there are special codes to say "I\'ve been hijacked" or "There\'s
a bomb on board", etc. So, I agree with the GDW hypothesis. Ok, much of the
data in Traveller would be encrypted, but only to a minimal level and with a
common system, since all ports (whatever size or tech) must be able to
decrypt the data to use it for ATC. Given that, the data will be easy to
forge (hence the \'variable\' transponders cited in CT/MT, e.g. on Corsairs).
The actual craft ID (transmitted amongst all this other ATC data) might be
more difficult to forge since this could use some form of public key system
like Pretty Good Privacy - PGP, based on the principals of DES (Data
Encryption Standard) which has caused outcry from certain repressive
dictatorships (oops I mean the US government). Encryption is dealt with
quite nastily even now, so forging ship IDs in Traveller will lead to
correspondingly heavy penalties if you get caught. The need for common port
and ship encryption standards at a higher TL than can be supported by some
planets and shipyards might well explain why transponders had to be black
boxes supplied from a select number of high tech\' sources...

collapse... nah, only kidding. :-)

Not an error!  Allow me to pull a little Traveller factoid out of my
wazoo.  The sector capital was moved from Mora to Regina sometime
during the end of the war, maybe the beginning of Hard Times.  I can\'t
remember the year off the top of my head right now.  This was
documented in one of the "dis Newsbriefs" that ran in the
MegaTraveller\'s Journal.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Was this before or after the domain capital was moved from Deneb to
Mora?

Was there any explanation given for the move to Regina? 
(It seems to me that the domain cap should also be the sector & subsector 
caps also. Don\'t most sectors/domains follow that rule?)

Nope. It\'s still down, and I don\'t think I will ever get back up...

But there are a few other pages out there that are quite good, so I

they try to use one set of formulae for both military and civilian ships.
This is slightly off.

Military ships are crewed and equipped to perform extensive repair during
operation.  Military equipment is gerally operated at the edge of its
performance envelope, and so needs much more maintenance than civil ship.  I
would suggest that mantenance and engineering crews on civilian ships should
be lower than the military counterparts by a factor of ten -- with
corresponding degradation in field repair capability.

Likewise, stewards are included on military ships at a fairly high rate (I
do not have my FF&S with me right now, so I cannot look it up).  This is
silly.  I would suggest one cook or cook\'s mate per 100 crew of any rank.
Crewman would have mess responsibilities as a secondary duty according to
the traditions of their service -- but a full time "mess steward"? Naaa.
Officer\'s steward would likewise be drawn from regular crew, and would have
military responsibilities as well.

I\'ve already expressed some feeling about the number of officers, especially
hanging about the bridge.  Officer ratios should be far lower on civilian
ships  -- crewman will mostly do their jobs, and there is no need for
tactical planning or couragious inspiration on a civilan cruise.

An interesting read for ship designers is C.S.Forsters "The Ship".  It
describes a single action by a British light cruiser in the Med in WWII.  It
gives a lot of insight into the structure and roles of crewmen in that
combination of technology and culture.  WARNING: A high level of tolerance
for British wartime propaganda is required for safe reading.

Good question.  I have to admit that in CT I always thought that mdrives
were a reaction type drive.  The thruster plate crap was a real surprise
to me (look at the starport blast burms in JTAS).  I had assumed that
ships actually had to reenter the hard way.  I wish that contra grav
costs (volume, mass, and MCr) went up absurdly above a certain size.  Oh
well.

You could make aerodynamic arguments (wind, storms, etc.) against
it----it\'s possible, but only under the right weather conditions.

USL designs could be considered less an intrinsic quality of the hull
form (hell, there are only 2 catch-alls that can\'t be streamlined) than
a purposeful design choice.  In other words when you choose "Open Frame"
you are planning on having sensors, etc. hang off the ship all over the
place such that it\'d be dangerous to have \'em in wind.  That or the
shape won\'t let the ship put down (how do you land a spiky
framework?)----I guess they could hover, though.  Choosing to USL a
Needle, say is a choice to make it too fragile to land.  That\'d be my
take.  It\'s possible, but bracing, etc. requires using a SL form (and
worrying about surface feature placement) to land.  Open and Close
Structures are any shapes that are intrinsically too fragile for landing
by definition.

larger that skirmish (one-to-one) level.

With my experience with, and fondness for, Traveller (or what I remember of

interested in gathering people\'s opinions of (and experience with)these two
games. I\'ve some experience with Command Decision II (CDII) upon which
Striker II is based. My experience with CDII is mixed. It is full of good
concepts unevenly developed: the rule is either clearly expressed and plays
cleanly, or is vague, ambiguous, and muddled.

In any case, any and all input will be appreciated.

Well, I think that the RSB is definitely a step in the right direction.
They\'ve introduced TL14-16 ships in the sourcebook and are probably
hard at work on other things.  Even the RCES had to wait until it\'s
third sourcebook before we got a volume of goodies.

Uhm, does the steward skill exist any more?  I don\'t think so.  I\'m
pretty sure that steward is more of a job than anything else.  For
this job the prerequisite skill would probably be Liason.  You can get
that under either the Exploration or Interaction clusters, either of
which is available to enlisted and commissioned merchants.

As a fan of the IISS, I have to ask "how so?"

Being a noble was never a career.  Nobles and their advisors have
always had another career.  For example, how many Dukes and Archdukes
were in the Navy.  How many were bereaucrats?  Their advisors are
likely to come from the same walks of life, or had a career in what
their function is (Norris\' proctologist was a Doctor, Craig\'s
strategists were probably Navy, Brzk\'s maid was a kennel owner, etc...)

:         4) there was no RQS CGen. Do they Use Navy, Scout, or something
:            unique?

In the RSB they state that RQS characters can be generated using
either the Scout or Navy career.  This is consistent with the
description of the RQS, which basically enscripts members of either the
RNS and/or RISS for missions.

: Also, they mention the X-Web, but give no real data.

What about the entire section labelled "The XWeb?"  Are you looking for
anything specific?

I think that I have missed one or two of the sites that are devoted 
to Traveller, but you can probably find a link to them on one of 
these...

NOTES
The Frontier Transport was originally built as a multi-purpose cargo vessel 
used for trade in undeveloped areas.  The design was a proprietary design 
belonging to Imperiallines, that primarily served worlds situated off the 
main trade routes.

This variant of the Frontier Transport was built for exclusive use by 
Imperial officials in the days of the Third Imperium.  Equipped for Jump-6, 
the ship was used to carry equipment, personnel and information over great 
distances in a short period of time.  Many Regency governments maintain 
secret use of these ships and contain them in clandestine orbital 
facilities.

Some ships dispense with some or all of the 10 gunners, as the turrets can 
be controlled from the two MFDs, which also allows one of the command crew 
to be dispensed with.  This allows the required complement to be reduced to 
as low as 33, although without crew, the turrets cannot be fired under 
local control if something happens to the MFDs.

Fuel scoops.  Fuel purification machinery (19.75 MW), 24 hours to refine 
21,800 m3 (1557.4 tons).

Why isn\'t the Regency using Longbow technology to look the other way?
Perhaps, they didn\'t have the resources to build another one, but just
think of the possibilities.  Maybe they know what is really happening
in Black Curtain area or have detailed knowledge about the deep
Wilds. Maybe they have been spying on the on Hivers and their allies.

Just a thought,

I am working up a pocket empire centered on Ariis/Verge 2439. I wanted to

only been involved with Traveller for the last few years and am not aware of
alot of the material published for Classic Traveller (other than that alot of

Has anything been published about Ariis or is the system referenced in any

be appreciated.

Hi,

I posted FFS designs for old CT ships, but I thought it would help to
talk about the way I would expect them to be used in combat.

Assumptions:

Zho ships won\'t have as much power to play with.

Zho ships can never deal with Imperials at equally long maximum ranges
due to fire control differences.

Grav focused lasers (GFLs) only become range effective for small focal
arrays at TL15+ (unless they are xray lasers).


Because they know about the first two, the Zhos might decide to use
small xray GFLs.  But why bother since the max range will waste a lot of
the long effective range?  The answer is to go with small, non-GFLs,
also in the xray band.  The result is a laser that has good damage at
medium range, and excellent damage at short range. (the only ranges that
they\'ll be shooting in anyway)

I see the PF and PCs fighting in the following way given their weapons:

Be quiet, and hope to bushwhack the enemy (good idea for everyone).

Use missiles to even the odds.  Imperial missile will be better, but not
that much.  It has the added benefit of keeping the initiative from him
(he\'ll react to the missiles, even if you are forced to do the
same----"if I can\'t have the initiative no one can!").
 
If you must trade direct fire weapons go for the clinch.  At close range
you will at worst be even.  At best you\'ll have a 700MJ laser to his
150MJ one (which he\'ll wanna keep since he can lose his range advantage
and have the 700+ ones, or keep a little one and wear you down at range,
and at range _you can\'t hit him_).

Use fighters to solve the range problem.  Fighters can close without
being locked, and avoid the whole problem.

Just running off at the mouth....

Ted Kim asked a question about using Lonbow technology to look torwards
the Imperial Core. I think the reason is that Longbow detects photons,
which travels at the speed of light, so if the new Longbow was at the
very edge of Deneb sector, it would have to look through Corridor,
Vland and Lishun Sectors. (I think those are the sectors, I could be
wrong) Each sector is 32 parsecs wide, at 3.24 ly per parsec it would
take light 311.04 years to travel the three sectors.  If the Domain
wanted to study Imperial History, it would make a good project.  
The Zho\'s core expeditions were even farther away, but the Imperium
didn\'t have anyother means to find out what was happening there.

Not Really. The difference is more one of how many shifts and where the
crew work.

Again, same crew requirements, just differing priorities. What you are
talking about is what\'s called "Minimum Crew" or "Prize Crew", the minimun
number of men who could get it from point a to point b. Not how any
commercial vessel I\'ve ever heard of operates.

Stewards are *FAR* more than just cooks. They are the cooks, laundry,
barber, tailor, and morale crew. 1 per 50 was laughed at by several
ex-"steward"s (actually ex USN MS3\'s), as being a few too many. 1 person
can cook for about 30-40 people without too much hassle, but even
automation makes the 1 per 50 a bare minimum for real numbers.

When you look at modern Merchant Marine vessels, they have the same or
higher ratios of "officers". From what I\'ve been told, it\'s because
military crews need less supervision for coordination.

Modern naval vessels differ from civilian vessels by having Gunnery
departments, Ship\'s Troops, Intelligence specialists, and low-tech systems
(Most US vessels would be borderline TL6-7, with a few 8\'s); the biggest
conventional ship to have seen recent service had a TL5-6 MECHANICAL
computer, the Iowa Class BB\'s.

Regarding ships\' crews:

I\'ve been working on a full FFS design for a 30,000 ton Zho CL, and
right now it has some 180 (!) bridge workstations.  And only 24 are for
MFDs right now.  The engineering crew is 917.  Yeesh.

I wouldn\'t have a big problem with the FFS crew levels if they were
expressed as crew/day.  That way the duty crew (bridge, engineering, and
maint.) would be say 1/3 of the FFS number.  The wkstations, etc would
be calculated for the lower number.

At GQ the gunners would report (the 2/3 that\'re off duty), and the
remaining eng, maint, and command would report to damage control, or to
the aux bridge, or whatever.

I just don\'t see why I need to provide for all 900 engineers to work at
the same time since they *must* have time off.

I\'m about to use Striker II in my mercenary campaign, and though I haven\'t

Responding to Susan Shock:

>>I\'m now relatively certain that the RSB does NOT make any
reference to where these Hivers live in the Regency. So...how about some 
ideas about how they got there and where they are?<<

There is mention of Regency Reserve Worlds.  One of them, Marastan/Glisten, 
seems to be particularly for K\'kree.  I\'ve established a second K\'kree 
reserve on Northammon/Vincennes, but that, of course, is unofficial.  (See 
my Northammon RICE paper if interested.)

The other reserve world listed is Aosta/Gulf in Deneb Sector.  No 
particular group of aliens is listed as the local refugee race, so I 
imagine it might be reserved for a number of races.  Perhaps the Hivers are 
part of a large alien community there.  Refugee Ael Yael from Gushemege, 
Vegans from the Solomani Rim and other races may be there too.


Responding to Jerry Alexandratos:

>>: Also, I expected to see a correction or two to the carreer list, and an

:         1) Merchants cannot get steward except as a hobby.

>>Uhm, does the steward skill exist any more?  I don\'t think so.  I\'m
pretty sure that steward is more of a job than anything else.  For
this job the prerequisite skill would probably be Liason.  You can get
that under either the Exploration or Interaction clusters, either of
which is available to enlisted and commissioned merchants.<<

Steward is gone.  _Service_ is the replacement skill.

>>:   3) There is no carreer for Serving Nobles... Wealthy Traveller isn\'t
:            quite right for them, although for terminal nobles and titular 
:            nobles it works.

>>Being a noble was never a career.  Nobles and their advisors have
always had another career.  For example, how many Dukes and Archdukes
were in the Navy.  How many were bereaucrats?  Their advisors are
likely to come from the same walks of life, or had a career in what
their function is (Norris\' proctologist was a Doctor, Craig\'s
strategists were probably Navy, Brzk\'s maid was a kennel owner, etc...)<<

I think what our friend is referring to here is the Noble career back in 
CT\'s Citizens of the Imperium.  TNE seems to have determined, much like 
Jerry, that Nobles indeed have other careers besides "Noble."  If they\'re 
just lazy putzes who tool around the galaxy, Wealthy Traveller would have 
to be their calling.

Further proof of the part-time Noble argument is how contacts are 
constructed.  Some of a player character\'s contacts, whether they be 
military, business, trader, or whatever, are nobles as well.  I would 
assume that a straight "Noble" contact was also a wealthy traveller.

They changed the name of the skill to Service. It has nothing to do with

Several points do not match, based upon my experiences with CT and MT:

Wrongo! Check Supplement 4: Citizens of the Imperium, or the MT Players
Manual. Both have a Noble Carreer, separate from Diplomat or Bureaucrat.
With a different mix of skills. there is some overlap with wealthy
traveller, but WT is both differently aimed, as well as having the wrong
kind of contacts.

Actually, On this point I stand corrected. That section gives more detail
on a second read. Still doesn\'t explain enough of the hows. I could care
less about the 4 paragraphs of explanation of why the regency did it. It
still doesn\'t tell me how to implement it, costs of sending messages, etc.
I want as much detail as the CT rule books (Bk1-8) gave, if not more. For
example, an X-Boat message cost was 10cr per image page per jump; we knew
to count by j-2 to the nearest X-boat route stop, then follow the route at
j-4, then go back to j-2 when we have to leave the route again. Universal
addressing (sort of... hopefully the destination system hasn\'t done a major
overhaul in local addresses since you last contacted them.) By the same
token, under the X-boat system, we knew how long it would take to get data
from point a to point b... 8.5 days per jump, assuming normal X-boat
turnaround times, and jump variations.

The X-web is missing That kind of information.

And I don\'t think the X-web would be used for secure data... it\'s little
more than a traveller internet. Lots and lots of raw data, private
messages, but too many hands in the pot that can\'t quite be trusted to not
peek.

maybe I should buy a soap box. I feel like I spend a lot of time on them. ;-)

Among other good reasons (like horrendous expense and a lot of calibration
work), there\'s lightspeed delay.  If it went operational in 1200, it could
see what is going on one sector-width away...in 1100.

TL-16 RF-151/RF-151-2 Palisade Recon Fighter (Regency of Deneb)
----

The Palisade reconnaisance fighter was developed by the government 
of Vincennes/Vincennes as a modern replacement for the standard,
century-old Imperial Rampart short-range fighter design.   

Advances in fusion power generation and gravitic technology allow
the craft to achieve seven gees of acceleration without substantial
loss of delta-vee.  While more expensive than existing nine-ton
fighters due to its\' sophisticated computer, the state-of-the-art
interactive expert system makes it much easier to maintain than
older designs.  

Two major variants exist.  The most common is armed with a compact
72MJ tunable laser lance with an effective range of 2400 Mm.  An
alternative two-place craft with an expanded communications suite
is designed for duties as a trainer, missile-carrier, or squadron
command ship.  While the one-place laser fighter can also carry 
missiles, the additional mass makes it less maneuverable when it
does so.  Since neither craft is equipped with an MFD, all missiles
carried should be fully-independent.

The Palisade is meant to operate as an interceptor or as part of a
fleet\'s fighter screen.  In this role, the mission of the Palisade
is primarily to watch for incoming enemy forces and to perform 
scouting and intelligence missions to gather data for the fleet,
without exposing vital fleet assets to return scrutiny.

While Palisade fighters are a common sight in the Vincennes system,
particularly around the system defense center on Friend, they are
much more rarely seen in regular Regency service.  However, due to
their similarity in appearance to Rampart fighters, it is possible
that some "Rampart" squadrons are actually newly deployed Palisades.

A primary difference in feel is the whole "add outstanding hits together"
bit.  I do BR combat as in the rules, but don\'t add hits together at
all.  You have to be sure and play meson screens properly (ie: like BL)
if you choose to do this (that way non-deep site MGs can hit a capitol
ship).

Why a laser lance?  I don\'t just mean in this design, I mean at all.
Ever.  I don\'t see that the price difference is worth it.  For a savings
of maybe MCr1, there is a major decrease in effectiveness.  As I see it
figthers should have as many gturns as possible, and evade at near max
gs all the time (when within laser range of a target).  That way the
target won\'t get a lock, and they\'ll get within 1 turn missile range.
The steerable array allows them to actually attack any target regardless
of evasion success----and makes using them as an anti-missile screening
force much more effective.

But all I have to do is increase the price :)  Neat fighter (and no
spreadsheet, *wow*).

OK.

Did anyone else pay attention to the reaction of the B5 people to the
massdriver (KE weapon, aka rocks) attack on the Narn homeworld?  That\'s
exactly the way I would see reactions to weapons of mass destruction in
traveller (nukes, rocks, or bioweapons).  I think that treaties, etc.
are a better way to deal with the rock problem than wishing them
away----and I like the their use would be a way to create solidarity vs.
the unprincipled enemy who uses them...

That makes sense as a limiter - I seem to recall that there are instance
in some published adventures where landing in regular SL ships is delayed
due to bad weather.  I guess weather control is not really perfect..

How about landing them in water?  That way odd surface protrusions aren\'t
going to be such a problem.  Getting ready for such a landing might require
a few EVA\'s to unbolt some particularly delicate sensors and such, but I
didn\'t mean this as an everyday occurance, just that it COULD be done -
emergency landings, offloading an unusually large cargo, etc.  Also - does
this mean that they can\'t land in the gravity well of an airless world?

Actually, the real point was not so much about the USL part, since in FF&S
SL frames are quite cheap, but about the low thrust requirements for takeoff.  
GDW doesn\'t recognize partial-G thrust for spaceships, but it would help 
to make economical merchant ships - A lightweight hull (at only .25G the
rules would only require AV 2.5), not much internal bracing (although I would 
say that the bracing should be designed with the G of the landing world in
mind), and a really small fusion plant (which helps keep crew down).  

[Aside: did anyone else ever notice that the 10T thrust/diplacement ton
really penalizes civilian ships, which tend to be lighter?  I have built
ships that weighed only 1500 t yet needed (according to the rules) 3000 t
thrust to make 1G.  I know that the 10tonnes/Ton rule is there for ease
of design and to keep the math down, but who designs from ff&s without

Using the long burn/low thrust aspect of contra-grav could actually give it 
some value for civilian ships (after all, if yuor ship can do 2G it can get
offplanet without CG, and without the expense and power consumption).

Mea Culpa, Mea Culpa, Mea Maxima Culpa.

I don\'t actually know where I got the 300 klick figure...I thought it was the 
top speed for simple airframe designs, but after a quick dive into FF&S, I 
find that there is not one but two simple airframe top speeds - 400 kph for
lift vehicles and 320 kph for airframes - and as you can see, neither is 
300 kph.  So rest in peace - your air-rafts are still valid designs!

General Inquiry:  

Has anyone used fighters under BR rules?   I tried it yesterday, pitting 5 
9-Ton, 4G fighters, each with a laser lance and 4 missiles against 2 400-Ton
3G Close Escort style ships equipped with meson gun spinal mounts, 2 laser 
turrets and a MFD controlled missile bay.  I treated the fighters individually,
since there were only 5, thought that could get nasty in a really large battle.
I was mildly suprised by the results: 2 Close escorts exploded versus 1 fighter
exploded, 2 badly damaged, and 2 unscathed.  [this shows a fundamental truth
about fighters: if you get hit, you get damaged BADLY.  Damage value adds ship
size, which is usually negative.  The 9T fighters are size +1. It is unlikely 
that you will get a temporary damage marker]  So for the replacement cost of
3 fighters (assming the 2 damaged ones are totalled, even if the crew survived), 
or about 60 Mcr, I destroyed utterly 420 Mcr worth of Escorts.  Not a bad trade
off, from the fighter\'s point of view.  

This exercise also validated my view of how to use a fighter effectively - make
it a mobile, stealthy missile launch platform.  To that end, here are some
of the design changes I am going to make to my fighters in the future:

Always carry missiles in external grapples - save space
Use LADAR instead of AEMS
     Fighters are not designed to play out a battle without support.  They
     are a screen for a more capable force - let the main ships/base do the
     detecting of bogeys at long range - the fighters just need locks once 
     the ship is detected.
Only install an MFD if they are cheap and small  
     range 2 or 3 should be more than enough.  Fighters are supposed 
     to close in - if you want to sit back and be safer, build a missile boat
If you don\'t install an MFD it\'s ok
     These fighters had none, so they could only control 1 missile each at 
     any given time, and they still did fine against a comperable TL ship.
     If I had given them crack crews (not unlikely in a fighter) then they 
     would have done even better.
Install a point defence laser turret
     A high fire laser turret that will reduce the diff mods on hitting 
     enemy missiles would probably have saved at least 2 of the 3 fighters
     lost.  And the -5 diff mod at a rate of 800 shots/turn goes a long way
     in BR - almost as close to a sure hit as you can get.
Make sure they have EMM
     The stealthiness of small size and EMM made the fighters very hard to 
     detect.  Once you are detected, the MFD on the enemy ships will negate
     some or all of this advantage, but until then you are at a distinct 
     advantage.

Basically, I think fighters still have a place in traveller space combat.  They
are cheap, and fast, and can get missiles to places the enemy doesn\'t want them.
And a good laser lance can inflict temporary damage on some pretty large ships.
That can be enough to tilt the odds to the fighter\'s side.  They should scoot 
in to close range, fire missiles, and run.  Fighters with SL and AF hulls can 
be based on a world and make use of the planetary sensors as well as hiding in
the atmosphere.  They can also be used to hunt down missile spreads and 
destroy them before they can get close enough to hit a real ship.  And best of
all, they are cheap and expendible.

The defense against fighters is, of course, more fighters.  Send cheap fighters
against other cheap fighters to make sure that your missiles get through.  Or
build an expensive "fighter-destroyer" with really good sensors, the best MFD
available, and a high ROF laser and waste them..most of them, er..oops, that
one just got through and launched a missile...no more expensive ship.

Well - that should be more than enough for one day!

STRIKER II

Striker II is great as a 25-15mm infantry game (lots of fun, realistic
"feel") but doesn\'t work so well on that scale for armor. I haven\'t played
it using microarmor yet. If you have larger scale miniatures, I highly
recommend it. I played in the demo at GenCon this year, and even though my
squads were trashed, I found it enjoyable and have played several times
since.

(By the way -- was anybody else on this list at the "Olympus Down" game? I
was the Glorious Fighting Red Legs (you know...the ones that eventually
formed the square :-) Unorthodox Coalition Tactics at its best).

BATTLE RIDER

Battle Rider just didn\'t "feel" like a good space battle. The movement was
easy, but both battlelines just seemed to drift towards each other until
they launched missiles and hammered away. I\'d like to play with someone who
knows the rules well and enjoys the game (perhaps I missed something), but
there was not much enthusiasm in my gaming group to give it a second try.
I\'d tried it once before -- at a GDW deom at GenCon 1994 -- but the ref
seemed as unsure of the rules as the rest of us, and again, there was
little "feel" or "flavor" to it (sorry about using such indefinable terms).

I would assume that the engineering crew incorporates shifts for standard

watch during each 8-hour period.  During battlestations, however, the full

To properly accommodate your engineers, you may want to institute 
"hot-bunking," to save on stateroom space, putting in 1/3 the number of 
bunks for the required crew.

On a side note, the one problem I have with the rote processing of ship\'s 
statistics on military ships is the requirement of bridge workstation 
installation for ship\'s troops commanders.  Why on Earth would troop 
commanders require bridge workstations?  And yet, ships like the Broadsword 
Merc Cruiser include workstations for these people.  I\'ve made an exemption 
to the bridge workstation rule in my campaigns as I think this is 
ridiculous.  Even if you envision an "Aliens" style officer control video 
camera system, the workstations would at least be reduced to 
engineering-sized (7 kl) instead of the huge bridge workstations (14 kl).


And, responding to Wesley (Fighters in TNE):

Thanks for the tips.  I haven\'t employed Rampart or any other style of 
fighter yet in BL, but I\'ve been looking forward to doing so and I\'m glad

I have to assume that as well, but do the guys that show up when GQ is
sounded need to all have workstations?  That seems odd to me.  Give them
all a laptop and let them carry it to the area need at the moment (since
the duty crew will handle all the major stuff at the workstations.

Since the PP is what engineering crew is for, what is it about a PP that
needs so many people?  I\'d like to have seen a system where you could
have multiple PPs, but there is some minimum overhead for each one.
That way a designer could choose to have 10 PPs with a lot of crew, but
it\'d take more damage since there isn\'t one choke point. You could have
one big PP, with almost the same crew as one a tenth of the size, but
it\'d take fewer hits to kill.

Yeah, but they\'re not that tight as it is.  I was thinking of 4 bunks
per small stateroom for the enlisted (friends tell me that was the
arrangement on ships they were on (er, well the 2 ft high bunks anyway,
not the stateroom).

One problem is that the missiles that the fighters fire won\'t get locked
on by the target in BL (most, anyway) which makes them really nasty.  On
the other hand I got the idea that the fight was played out in BR... and
missiles are way too easy to lock in BR.  On yet another hand (who has
3 hands, anyway?) the missiles in BR do way too much damage if they
hit.  

Maybe I\'ll play out a BR game tonight with fighters (using my damage
bashes on BR so it\'ll turn out like a BL game.

There isn\'t anyting in FFS that prevents fractional gs at all.  Just use
the fact that HEPlaR drives produce 20 tonnes of thrust per megawatt
applied.  I did this for the 8 ton fighter (had to).  It was like a
14.4g drive without taking mass into account.

If using the actual mass (make sure to give the cargo mass!) improves
the design, post it as such, it\'s legal.

True enough... remember to incluse the missile mass when calulating
drive performance.

I gave my fighter ladar so it could paint the target with it for its
missiles.  Some of this effect you comment on is due to the nature of
sensor tasks in BR (it\'s different in BL).

I use FIMs for all fighters (though they can be controlled, as well).

Two things here:  one, you\'re right high ROF turrets are a good thing...
turrets, not lances.  Two, the tasks in BR are all one level too easy!
Remember to make everything one *base* diff level higher than it is, or
BR won\'t even remotely model BL combats.  And the bullseye should only
count as a regular hit for diff levels 4-5, but that won\'t matter if you
ditch the doubling rule with damage (not too much, anyway).

Yes!  EMM on everything, missiles included (the semi-ind. missiles
published already do, BTW).

In BL a fighter with a crappy sensor won\'t ever see the swarm, even with
a hand off at short range.

Yes and No... the listed "Loaded Weight" for cargo vessels is 1000kg per
1000L, or a specific gravity of 1, identical to 4=B0c water. Many cargos wil=
l
be much denser than this. And, since cargos are shipped by the displacement
ton (TNE, p232), a cargo vessel is likely to be carrying goods which exceed
the "loaded Weight", even though her holds are half empty. Remember that
anything that doesn\'t float will "overload" the design, if the "loaded
weight" is taken as maximum safe weight. Military vessels tend not to carry
cargo, so their empty weight is often closer to the 10t/dt than a cargo
vessel, although after figuring the actual tonnage metric of the vessel
after a load of ores, dense woods, and data crystals, said cargo vessel can
come real close to 10tonnes per disp ton.

The answer, of course, is to list cargo space as 5 tonnes per kL, as this
is the approximate density of steel, and is a safe "upper limit" to
_average_ cargo loads.

Except for vessels where cargo is incidental to the design, and is more
than likely the ship\'s locker and long duration food stores.

 ----
With my experience with, and fondness for, Traveller (or what I remember of
it), I thought about getting Striker II and Battle Rider. To this end, I am
interested in gathering people\'s opinions of (and experience with)these two
games. I\'ve some experience with Command Decision II (CDII) upon which
Striker II is based. My experience with CDII is mixed. It is full of good
concepts unevenly developed: the rule is either clearly expressed and plays
cleanly, or is vague, ambiguous, and muddled.
 ----

Battle Rider seems to work fairly well, at least you can play with 
battleships without having to use 3000 die rolls to fire all its weapons :)

Striker II has similar problems to CDII plus it adds a few of its own.
I have asked these questions on the TML  and directly to GDW without 
receiving an official response.

1. Ammunition. The rules are unclear whether 1 shot is used per turn of fire 
or per dice rolled. I will assume 1 shot per turn of fire unless official 
clarification is forthcoming.

The problem is as follows:
 - Striker II uses different numbers of dice rolled for hits at different 
ranges.
 - Weapons will fire the same number of rounds at a target regardless of 
range.
 - In Command Decision (which most of Striker II\'s rules came from) 1 shot is 
used per ROF to hit attempt.
 - If the interpretation is as CD then at least one of the vehicles presented 
in Striker II doesn\'t carry enough ammo for even 1 turn of fire at close 
range with it\'s main armament at max ROF.
 - The rules for ammo use for infantry heavy weapons refers to turns of fire, 
NOT dice rolled.
 - In the direct fire rules it states that less than the maximum ROF dice may 
be used if desired. Is this intended to conserve ammo?
 - ROF is reduced if moving without adequate stabilization. Is this reduction 
to account for less ammo fired or reduced accuracy of firing?
 - The rules of Striker II are totally unclear as to what is intended.

2. ROF dice per TNE ROF. How many dice does a weapon with TNE ROF 4 ( eg. a 
10 cm autocannon ) get? I will assume Striker II ROF 4 unless official 
clarification is forthcoming.

The chart inStriker II does not have a position for any vehicle weapon with 
ROF=4.
It does have:
TNE ROF (5 or 10 handheld), all 3 = Striker II ROF 4
TNE ROF 5 or 10 mounted = Striker II ROF 5

Yes, AFAIK it was merely a reboxing of the original Imperium (which is the

Uhm, does the steward skill exist any more?  I don\'t think so.  I\'m
pretty sure that steward is more of a job than anything else.  For
this job the prerequisite skill would probably be Liason.  You can get
that under either the Exploration or Interaction clusters, either of
which is available to enlisted and commissioned merchants.

Being a noble was never a career.  Nobles and their advisors have

were in the Navy.  How many were bereaucrats?  Their advisors are
likely to come from the same walks of life, or had a career in what

Apart from the blast berms, there was the small ship in "Fighting Ships"
(the original, not the sad MT version) which had baffle plates installed
to protect people when it took off.

However, I have NO problem with anti-grav within a planetary gravity well.
My explanation to the players is that an "anti-grav generator" creates a
standing gravity wave which is opposed to the planetary gravity. When you
press down on the accelerator in your air/raft, the generator changes the
grav wave to a pushing force. In effect, the craft "surfs" on the gravity
wave (OK, I am a fan of *that* scene in Dark Star!).

Now, I realise that this is totally unscientific, and grav waves probably don\'t
work this way, and even if they did you probably couldn\'t surf on them, but
there comes a point when you have to say "Oh, what the ****! It just WORKS,
ok?"

At the moment, I am still using thruster, because NO-ONE HAS COME UP WITH
ANYTHING BETTER!! I agree with the person about 50 digests ago who said
something to the effect that "I can\'t believe that they are still using TL 12
tech (HEPlAR) at TL 15!" Please, create something to allow the Leviathan
to work as it should. I don\'t care if you call it "thruster plates" or
"roses", for playability (remember this is a GAME!) it should exist!

That\'s the the solution a friend and I selected. Additional
considerations are:

* pilots (additional pilots for all shifts)

* engineering crew - it\'s ridiculous that the engineering crew is
  proportional to the size of powerplant etc, in a ship. Just because
  a powerplant is double the size doesn\'t mean that you need twice as
  many people pushing buttons. We used a logarithmic function after
  engineering crew reached a certain size.

If your campaign uses any of the cyberwear from FF&S, you could use a buzzer 
on the ones with jackplugs. Briefly, the buzzer plugs into their jack and 
broadcasts white noise which overrides the sensory inputs to their brains 
and renders them temporarily helpless (but still easy to move around) - my 
Cyberpunk players have a lot more respect for the cops now because of this.

Stun/Shock I don\'t know about, but I was reading in New Scientist [I think] 
about a foam rifle which shoots streamers of very sticky gluey foam, 
covering the perpetrator and rendering them helpless and unable to 
move/resist.

You could try rewriting some Space Precinct episodes (or Hill Street Blues, 
or whatever other cop show is running over there at the moment). 
Alternatively, read some Joseph Wambaugh books. That should give you enough 
ideas for a while.

Let me know how you get on.

Kind Regards

Well, the bottom line is that any realistic mdrive is gonna be physics
limited, not TL limited.  TL12 is the point at which all the forces are
controlable.  The drives might get better in increments----or more
likely, cheaper, but I don\'t see too much improvement in HEPlaR.  If you
consider that the exhaust is supposed to be "clean" that really limits
you (although we all know HEPlaR drives are blowtorches).  I\'d expect to
see improvements in the TL9 fusion drive as given at TL12 or so... A
*big* jump.  BTW, HEPlaR comes in at TL10, not 12, so maybe a HEPlaR
improvement there as well (smaller in the case of HEPlaR given the
restrictions on the exhaust).

If you wanna do this for a Leviathan design, do it.  HEPlaR drives (from
memory, so do the math!) are .357% of hull volume per g, and gturns are
.4464% per gturn (gturn figure is exact).  For fusion rockets the drive
at TL9 is 8% of hull volume per g, and .18% per gturn.    A simple fix
would be to do the design in straight FFS, then cal the mdrive a "dirty
HEPlaR" (which would just be a fusion rocket at a higher TL) and
multiply the gturns by 2-2.48 to give it the samefuel use as a fusion
drive.  Then your design can be used by everyone, and it\'ll have a few
hundred gturns for your use.

That or use some improved fusion rocket (I\'d have a 1g HEPlaR for use
where safety is an issue).

Of course you could always use micro jumps to get around the system,
just prorate the fuel use... jump 1 is 10% hull volume in fuel (worst
case), in system travel would be a tiny fraction of this.  10% is just
over 22 gturns, BTW.

Yup, there should be an economy of scale on PPs.  Maybe there\'s a way to
use the minimum volume allowed for a PP as a coefficient for crew (that
way at higher TLs you get an improvement in crew size for a give sized
PP).  Does anyone have a good idea of what they actually thinkfusion PPs
are?  

By their rules I\'d guess that a hydrocarbon PP now would take about one
engineer per kilowatt since my honda generator takes one "engineer" (er,
physics geek :-) per kW... what does four corners coal plant do... like
20MW or something?  Wow, 20,000 people just to keep it running ;-)

You\'re right.  I completely forgot about that.  However, enlisted
merchants can get the skill as a first term skill.  I think that the

The first thing you need to remember is that they overhauled the
character careers.  They aren\'t quite what they used to be.  However, I
personally think that these current rules are better.  You are right
that Field Scouts didn\'t have ranks.  However, I think that under the
Enhanced Scout Character Generation sequence they did.  It also seems
as though they took the ranks for scouts from this.

I think that you\'re confusing officers with administrators.  Just
because someone is commissioned, doesn\'t mean that they automatically
become administrators.  After all, someone\'s got to be in charge in the
field (and yes, I know this is the scout with the highest Pilot skill,
but hey, it can\'t hurt if he also knows how to lead)

Field scouts don\'t fly most of the time.  What about the surveyors that
need to run the holo-pit?  Or how about the dirtside scouts from the
Exploration Branch?  And the Intelligence Office needs sneaks more than
pilots. 

To me the skill mix seems just fine.  Am I the only one that\'s happy
with the new character careers?  I think that you just have to choose
the skills that would make your shape your character the way you want
to.  Choose Liason instead of Survival.  Choose a Spacehand skill
instead of a Space skill.  It\'s all there in my opinion.

I stand corrected.  I completely forgot to check my MT manual.

Hi, there was a post a while back regarding missile sizes using US Navy
examples...  I figured the volume for the biggest of them, the Tomahawk.

I assumed it was a simple cylinder, so this result is generous.  It is
1.43kl.  One standard traveller missile is almost 5 times bigger than a
tomahawk.

The Pheonix is the right length at around 4m, but it is only 0.46kl.

CT/MT missiles were Tomohawk sized damn near exactly at 0.1 ton.

Ah... makes sense to me.  If they do nothing else that\'d drop the volume
(and mass?  depends on density differences, I guess).  I\'d think that
the ability to horse around with the Strong and Weak forces would have
to create a qualitative change in the way they\'d make a fusion drive,
however.

Could you post it again for me?  That or just mail it to me.  Thanks!

What about a SD and BSD version?  What are the material volume figures
you\'re using?  Just assume the thing is a cylinder of a some size?
What thickness (or I guess armor value would be the thing here)?

I kinda like the idea of big military ships using fusion drives... makes
large marshalling areas away from the major world(s) make sense.  In CT
really big ships usually didn\'t land (like above 5000tons, right?).
That might be Imperial military standards... ships 5kt and below are
fitted with HEPlaR for operating near commercial traffic.  Big ships
would have a small HEPlaR as a backup, and for close ship operations.

I remember thinking about this when I built the laser, but obviously
not too clearly.  This is absolutely correct.  For a paltry MCr 0.01,
the lens can be upgraded to trainable, and there is no other difference
between a lance and a trainable laser.  Add this cost to the laser
fighter and to the laser, and add access to Arc 2 (Bow Quarter) to
the laser arcs.  If the laser is moved to a location in hull section
2-5, you can also add Arc 3.  I think this is worth the Cr 10000.  :)

1) A character from a Vacuum world gets Environment Suit as a default
skill; however, a character from a world with Extreme Atmosphere -- which
is just as unbreathable -- doesn\'t get Environment Suit.

2) Officers in the Aviation career learn Slug Weapon, but they CAN\'T learn
Autogun or Tac Missile.  (Neither can the enlisted aviators.)  So, if my
aviator wants to shoot down an enemy aircraft, is he expected to use his
.44 Magnum (instead of his aircraft\'s Gatling gun or Sidewinder missiles)?

3) The skill Sensors belongs in the Technician cluster.  Many
careers needing access to this skill already have Technician.  The example
that best illustrates this need is the Wet Navy.  Without this
modification, enlisted Sailors can\'t learn how to use a sonar, which really
bites the big one if the enlisted guy is driving a submarine! 
<CRUNCH!....bubble, bubble>

4) The cluster Vehicle lists only the Interface/Grav cascade of Pilot. 
This should actually be ANY cascade of Pilot, not just Interface/Grav. 
I\'ve got several friends who have a private pilot\'s license (aka, Fixed
Wing), and a couple of them are rated for helicopters (Rotary Wing).  I
know there are people who ride in hot air ballons for fun (Airship).  You
get the idea.

5) The skill Swimming should be added to the Acrobat cluster.  We\'ve got
other traditional sporting skills in this cluster.

So much for "missing" skills.  I\'ve also noticed some "surplus" skills.

1) Why does anyone in the Military Academy (which is for GROUND TROOPS, not
starship personnel or aerospace pilots; they use Flight Academy) need
access to the Space Tech cluster, especially when you consider that
pre-stellar characters can attend Military Academy?

2) The skill Interview is redundant and unnecessary; replace it with
Interrogation.  Classic Traveller never had Interview; it used
Interrogation.  The ONLY career in Mega-Traveller that used Interview
instead of Interrogation was Journalist (a skill for just one career -- not
a smart idea).

Intelligence Office? What Intelligence Office? Intell school is a FIELD
SCOUT SCHOOL for SURVEY branch.

By Flying, I meant that they were shipboard. Due to the small crews,
everybody should be cross-trained, at least by the end of the mission.

The Old IISS (CT/MT) basic generation was expanded into the tree field
branches. The administration was added in expanded gen. It\'s almost a
separate carreer there. The new (TNE) scout carreer works; I don\'t argue
that it provides for competent explorers, but it doesn\'t work for the
Regency or when running previous settings with the TNE rules. It doesn\'t
match the materials previously created.

Jerry, I HATE the lack of a coherent system in the CT setup. The only
coherent rules system was CharGen. I Like the TNE Rule System. I have never
liked the "dark traveller" approach of MT or TNE. I liked the rich history
and detail provided by the CT and MT materials. I want Continuity. In both
rules and settings. I have, and shall continue to run primarily in the
1000-1120 timeframe, as that\'s what I and my players like. Everyone I know
who has bought the RSB in my local area is dissapointed with it; most of
them have played and/or run Traveller since the early 80\'s, not for the
rules, but the background. And with TNE, the robbed us of that, but at
least gave us decent rules.

As for the Serving Noble, the skills match up fairly well with Wealthy
Traveller... For those interested, I reccomend the following Carreer:

Serving Noble:
PR\'s: Soc 10+, Edu 7+
First Term Skills: Determination 1, Perception 1, Economics 1, CHarm 1,
Interaction 1, Physical Science 1, Social Science 1
Subsequent Terms: Aircraft, Determination, Perception, Economics,charm,
Interaction, vessel, vehicle, spacehand, Social Science
Special Adventure: 9+, Gun Combat, Explore, Melee, Language, Space Vessel,
Vice, Personal Transport, Physical science, Social Science
Promotion: 12+
Contacts: 3 per term: 1 noble, and 2 buisiness, government, military, or
scientist.
Other effects: Soc x 10 for money, +5 DM\'s for Yacht, 2 hobbies per term
after first.

See? I\'m not JUST a whiner ;-)

I agree that there is a problem with this section. However, there should be
a bridge workstation (remember that the Bridge WS includes enough spacce to
be able to interact comfortably without bumping elbows) for the Ship
Security Station. This is the station that detects threats and directs
responses, as well as handling fire suppression, etc, which marines get
tasked for. Marines as passengers (for example: on a transport) should not
be counted as crew, but steerage or mid passengers. The Marines in the crew
calculations should be the ship\'s security detatchment; they WOULD be
monitoring, ala aliens, just about everything aboard, and their honcho
belongs on the bridge so the captain and sensors people can prep him for
boardings, and engineering can inform him of potential fire problems.

There is actually a second more worrying question I just noticed - Why are any 
TL13+ lasers designed as tuneable? If you take a careful look at the numbers, 
it just doesn\'t make sense.
Examples use 4.5m diameter FA(barbette)
SPACE FIRING
TL13 NonGF X-Ray Laser
Effective Range = 450,000 kilometers

TL13 Grav Focused X-Ray Laser
Effective Range = 324 million kilometers

TL13 Grav Focused Tuneable Laser
Effective Range = 729,000 kilometers

ATMOSPHERIC FIRING in standard atmosphere
TL13 NonGF X-Ray Laser
Effective Range = 4500 km

TL13 Grav Focused X-Ray Laser
Effective Range = 3.24 million kilometers

TL13 GF tuneable 
Using Far UV,  Effective Range =  7290 km
Using Visible, Effective Range = 14580 km

Grav Focusing does have advantages, but tuneables are inferior in any practical 
application to tuneable lasers. Laser designers at TL13+ should just design 
X-Ray lasers with an on/off switch for the gravitic focussing. The benefits 
from X-Ray lasers increase even further at higher tech levels as GF gets 
better. If you consider how much larger you can make the focal array for a 
nonGF X-Ray laser with the savings from the HPG, you would probably find it 
would overtake the tuneable lasers.

This was just a guess based on the following
-You don\'t need guided projectiles, since the mass drivers would be used 
against big fixed fortifications, against moving targets the lasers (and 
possibly some Meson bays) would be much better, TL16 800MJ lasers being quite 
effective against even the mighty Trepidas.
-If you have a big starship power plant available, using magnets to provide 
launch for projectiles instead of rockets seems sensible, as you don\'t need to 
carry the rocket engines, and so can carry a much larger supply of ammunition.

You\'re right about the G limit, I\'m working on a 5G design at the moment. 
Still, it has an interesting new weapons system which makes it quite handy. I 
should finish it to post tonight or tomorrow.

I spy a scenario:

The Regency creates a specialised spy ship, which uses linked drone missiles/
fighters/cutters/whatever to spread out and form a coarse version of Longbow.
Each ship has a BIG folding sensor, and tight-beam commo link back to the
mother ship.

The Regency wants some group of loonies (sorry, volunteers) to take the ship to
the edge of Regency space (maybe the Islands) or further (wherever you calc 70

Enter the adventurers...(crew, victims, sorry, I mean volunteers...)

I think what you\'re forgetting is that ultimately, no matter how much

the beam pointer.  Thus, even if your X-Ray laser goes 1 bijillion kms,
it can still only be pointed out to 80 hexes max.

As for tunable vs x-ray.  The only reason that you would make lasers
tunable is because they are more effective than x-ray laser in
atmospheres.

And I don\'t think that grav focusing is something that can be turned
on/off.  I think that it\'s an integral part of the laser design.  Think
of it as the trade-off for having it.  At least that\'s what the feeling
FFS imparts on me.

True, but this is what I meant by ranks.  Granted, it\'s not the classic
feel.  But it is an acceptable trade-off (IMO).  I think that they were

: least gave us decent rules.

I\'ve always loved the setting and rules.  I even liked the Rebellion
and even Hard Times.  Granted, it was Twilight:5700, but still it was
nice.  And I was the first one to bitch and moan and gripe and yell and
scream when all I saw was source material for the RCES.

However, I was very happy with the RSB.  I think that it\'s one of the
best sourcebooks created for any system (not just TNE).  It contained
lots of background info.  Granted, it was as comprehensive as some
would have liked, but for the space, I think that it makes the best use
of it.  Then again, you may want to take what I say with a grain of
salt, after all, I found Hivers and Ithklur humorous and I even liked
the idea of San*klass...  8)

I tend to use the decent rules and try to adjust the past to fit in. 
Granted it takes some work, but it\'s worth the effort.

Personally, I don\'t think you can skirt the workstation rules.  During

a "laptop rule" in your campaigns, I wouldn\'t fault you, but what do I

Hmm.  I allow a maximum of two people per small stateroom and four per 
large stateroom as a matter of course.  To me, that seems tight, even by 
submarine standards.  The PCs in my Regency campaign, who are mercenaries, 
are always trying to get something like that past me.  I usually make the 
flyboys (astrogator, pilot), chief engineer and other top spots rather 
finicky and demanding of more stateroom space.  Of course, they can always

You too, eh?  I thought the Xboat list was for the dissidents. <g>  
Basically, I think we have a case here of a person who wasn\'t going to like

observe was that there was a disclaimer in the front that said character 
generation tables could not be accommodated in the RSB, but would appear at 
a later date, or somesuch.  

The black books are still great reference, but we\'ve moved on now.  TNE 
isn\'t as bad as so many of the bellyachers make it out to be.  I don\'t 
speak from an uninformed stance, either.  I\'ve played every incarnation of 
this game since 1980.  I\'ve done the CT black books, and they really 
couldn\'t hold a candle to the current game in many respects, other than 
simplicity.

I\'ve no problem with the number of officers, just, as was said, the fact
that they\'re *all* on the bridge! All the time!

I\'ve never been a fan of snub pistols - I guess it\'s a hang-over from CT,
where they were just about the most inaccurate weapon you could find. Give
me a gauss pistol any day.

In my "current" (it\'s been on hold for months) campaign, the PCs work for

ISTR that the use of WoMD (esp. nukes) was the one thing that would get

Sorry, but you\'re wrong on this one.  The processor takes 1 hit per 5
tonnes, the radiators take 1 minor hit per MW, ignore fractions, and can
have more than 4 minor hits (presumably because they\'re spread out on
the surface).

Here are blurbs on all the Traveller Boardgames I know of that predate TNE:

I haven\'t played 5fw, but have read it. I wish I had a copy. It\'s supposed
to be pretty good, and it looked playable.

Imperium is excellent, but is distinctly pre-classic in setting... exact
details escape me, and I don\'t wan\'t to dig it out. It is very fun, and
plays quickly (1 war in aboput 2-4 hours, campaigns can take up to  20
wars!

Invasion Earth is the final battle of Earth during the Solomani Rim War
(imp 1002 or so). I have played it, with a friend, and then went out and
got a copy. the regiment-brigade level operations are great, and it
included rules for integrating with traveller ---- and the old MT Rebellion
sourcebook gives troop strengths that can be used in it!.

Mayday was the Classic Traveller Space Combat system done with counters on
a hex grid. Excellent, quick and dirty.

Snapshot was the boardgame adaptation of CT\'s personal combat system;
better laid out, now usefull only for the maps.

Azhanti High Lightning and Striker were the same system; AHL was using a
grid map and counters aboard ships, and striker was minis. AHL is well
worth buying for the complete deckplans of the AHL class ships (400000ton
FI-14).

Hope this is interesting

Well, if you\'d read the technical supplement to Brilliant Lances, or even 
FF&S, you\'d know that EMM is an exception to that rule.  This was 
probably done to reflect the dispersed nature of the EMM radiator system.

Emerald is one of five worlds of the Jewell Cluster, straddling the
Regency/Zhodani border in the Jewell Sector.  Fortified for centuries
against the threat of Zhodani invasion, the system is still the site of
considerable military activity, despite improvements in relations with the
Consulate.  Emerald is also an important link between the Regency advance
naval base at Quar (Chronor:  Spinward Marches/0807) and naval forces
operating in the Jewell and Regina subsectors.

Emerald was settled in 308, by the followers of disgraced Sylean nobleman
Aklas Ecannis. Ecannis, the Duke of Ecan (2316/Core), was executed for
cowardice in 306, following the Battle of Concorde during the Aslan Border
Wars.  Stripped of title and privelige, Ecannis\' family was permitted to
emigrate to the Spinward Marches.  By calling in old favours, the newly
widowed Eritrea Ecannis was able to secure a charter to settle Jewell.
About two hundred family and retainers arrived in late 308, and founded the
first settlement at Eritrea.

Although self-sufficient, the colony grew only slowly.  Periodically,
labourers and craftsmen would be recruited from Jewell and Regina, but
settlement remained largely confined to the area around Eritrea.  Although a
part of the Imperium, Emerald remained unrepresented to the imperial court
(by decree in 306, no member of the Ecannis family was permitted to hold
title).  As the imperial presence in the area grew, Emerald began exporting
agricultural products to the rapidly growing Jewell (already emerging as a
major industrial world).

Nonetheless, contact with offworlder remained confined to the small \'E\'
class starport at Masand Caldera, and Emerald remained isolationist.  The
Ecannis family allowed no further settlement, and restricted offworlders to
the starport compound.  This self-imposed isolation was to be stretched to
breaking point as tensions between the Imperium and the Zhodani Consulate
rose, and ultimately shattered by the outbreak of the First Frontier War.

>From 510 onwards, Imperial Navy fleet elements deployed to the Emerald
system from the naval base on Jewell for maneuvers.  The Navy established a
small service facility in the outer system, although craft did occasionally
land on the mainworld. In 540, Grand Admiral Severin Gouden appointed a
legate to the small settlement, mainly to co-ordinate the requisition of
foodstuffs, and keep an eye on the politically suspect natives (as early as
460, Imperial Naval Intelligence suspected Zhodani sympathies in the Ecannis
family).  Emerald\'s starport was also upgraded to \'D\' class, over the
protests of the planet\'s rulers.

With the Zhodani invasion of Imperial space in 591, martial law was declared
on Emerald. Members of the Ecannis family thought to be \'unreliable\' were
interred on Jewell as Imperial forces were pushed back from their original
defensive positions.  The Zhodani attacke and captured Jewell in 592, and
were to remain in possession of the world almost until the war\'s end.
During the Zhodani occupation, the world was used as a prison camp for
partisans captured on Jewell, and the world was forced to endure the
presence of large numbers of Zhodani ground troops.

Following Admiral Plankwell\'s recapture of Jewell in 603, Zhodani forces
evacuated Emerald and fled into Consulate space.  Imperial troops liberated
the world shortly afterwards, but a large garrison was kept in place beyond
the war\'s end.  In 606, the Ecannis family was allowed to return to Emerald.
Limitations on offworlder-native contact remained, but were increasingly
hard to enforce.  This was illustrated by the decision of the Ecannis heir,
Sar Valain Ecannis to apply for the Imperial Naval Academy in 608.  His
decision outraged his relatives, but they were powerless to stop him after
he received the somewhat unexpected support of the Imperial legate.  

Sar Valain went on to distinguish himself in the Second Frontier War, and as
a squadron commander for Admiral (later Empress) Arbellatra Akhalikoi during
the later stages of the Civil War.  Sar Valain returned to Emerald in 626,
as the new Imperial legate, and was instrumental in persuading the Ecannis
family to restrict the most stringent of their isolationist practises.  On
becoming head of the Ecannis family in 630, Empress Arbellatra rescinded the
decrees against the Ecannis family issued by Empress Porphyria in 306, and
Sar Valain was named Baron Emerald.  The office of Imperial legate to
Emerald was dissolved.

Sar Valain\'s descendants concentrated on developing Emerald\'s export
economy.  Large tracts of land were cultivated, using increasingly
sophisticated agrotechnology.  By 900, Emerald was supplying large amounts
of grain to Jewell, despite it\'s small population. The starport facilities
were progressively upgraded to their current capabilities as the Imperial
(and later Regency) Navy increased it\'s presence in the system.  This
pattern has been uninterrupted since, despite occupation by the Zhodani in
the Third and Fifth Frontier Wars.

Emerald\'s highly automated agricultural industry faced upheaval when the
first reports of Virus filtered into the Regency.  The enforced switch from
autonomous to supervised robotics was expensive and damaging to the world\'s
economy - damage which is still felt by many on Emerald.  Production is once
again approaching pre-1130 levels, but further progress is hampered by an
acute labour shortage on this isolationist world.  Plans to allow controlled
immigration of workers from Jewell are currently the subject of fierce
debate on Emerald.
  
The Ecannis family still rules on Emerald, as the Five Families.  Each of
the Five Families is responsible for an area of activity on Emerald, and is
largely independent of both the other four families and the ruling Head.
The current Five Families are:  Ecannis-Astrakhanna (starport facilities,
energy production), Ecannis-Shtabul (food production and export), Ilike
(mineral production and export), Farsi-Ecannis (construction and
infrastructure) and Ecannis-Valain (communications, information and
administration).  Smaller branches of the Ecannis family control other
activities, normally under the guidance and direction of one of the Five.
Baron Emerald (also known as the Head) comes from the Ecannis-Valain branch,
succession is passed through the male line.

Below the level of the ruling families, rank and position is largely based
on merit.  Particularly powerful, skilled or successful individuals are
often rewarded with marriage or adoption into a Family, giving them
effectively \'noble\' status.  At the bottom of the ladder are the workers,
although given the small population and high technology of the world, even
these are skilled, rather than unskilled workers, and enjoy a good standard
of living.  It is among this class that the labour shortage is most acutely
felt.  The shortage of skilled workers hasplaced severe constraints on the
Families\' ability to export food and mineral products, but the inherent
isolationism (which can cross the line into xenophobia) of the world makes
solving this problem difficult.

When entering the system, travellers will normally find themselves exiting
j-space near Phantome (orbit 1, large gas giant).  A beacon at the regular
jump exit point directs incoming ships to the Regency Quarantine Station on
Mitchell, a smallish moon orbiting Phantome.  Standard quarantine
proceedures will be followed (see the Jewell and Ruby papers for further
details) by Regency Quarantine Service staff before the incoming vessel will
be cleared to travel in-system to Emerald.

Approaching the mainworld, it is quickly apparent that Emerald lives up to
it\'s name.  Much of it\'s land surface is covered in uncleared vegetation,
and it\'s generally shallow seas also have a greenish tinge.  Emerald truly
is an inviting world when viewed from orbit - only it\'s presence near the
Zhodani border prevented further settlement.  Emerald Starport (Masand
Caldara) is a small \'B\' class facility closely tied to the Scout base.  It\'s
small repair facility is not normally available for public use, although
emergency repairs are possible.  Refined fuel is available at the public
facility, but is expensive (Cr 6,500/ton) as are berthing fees (Cr 200/day).

The starport lies some 50 km southeast of Eritrea, the oldest and largest
town with a population of about 14,000.  Travel by air/raft takes about 15
minutes, or about 30 minutes in extreme weather conditions.  There is a road
link to the starport, but it\'s use is mainly confined to freight haulage.
As the passenger approaches Eritrea, he/she will notice the walled compounds
just outside the town\'s edge.  These are private estates belonging to the
Families and their servants, and are off-limits to visitors without an
invitation.  The larger Families maintain a number of compounds, near to
their major concerns.

The commonfolk of Emerald are polite, if somewhat reticent.  Contact and
conversation with offworlders is not encouraged among the general
population.  The Ecannis-Valain family maintains a Liason Centre in Eritrea,
where younger members of this family are on hand to inteface between
visitors and the locals.  The Liason Centre can be found in the Carpaty
Plaza, next to the offices of the Jewell Embassy.

Addendum:  348-1201

Visitors to Emerald are advised to exercise caution when travelling outside
of the starport compound.  Certain conservative elements on the planet are
currently actively campaigning against offworld contact, evoking xenophobic
reactions from portions of the population.  Althought Emerald\'s official
policy is still neutral towards visitors, travellers can expect problems
when dealing with locals, especially those from certain reactionary families
(chiefly Farsi-Ecannis).

The Transstar Model Y37, or \'Arafura\' Class Yacht, is in service throughout
the Solomani Confederation and adjacent areas.  Originally commisioned by
the Solomani Confederation as an executive level transport, the design has
also found favour with other local governments and individuals.  The design
has been licensed to a number of smaller manufacturers, who have produced a
number of custom variations on the \'Arafura\' design. Of particular note is
the \'Flipper\' Class, which has been modified for use by Dolphin crew and
passengers.
Transstar licensed the design to Fremantle Shipyards in 1092, and production
began at Fremantle\'s yards in the Deneb and Spinward Marches Sectors.
Following the Collapse, Fremantle is now the only builder of this type.
Called locally the \'Pelsaert\', the Model Y37 has sold in numbers, albiet
less than the famous \'Lord Baltimore\' Class Yacht manufactured by Ling
Standard Products.
Transstar is a wholly-controlled subsidiary of the Solomani Party.
Fremantle Shipyards is a subsidiary of the Fremantle Group.

Having recently showed several newbies the TNE Rulebook, I was asked the
question "So where\'s the award winning background and history of the
Imperium?" TNE is the BEST system of rules yet done by GDW. It relies far
too much, IMMNSHO, upon converting players from previous editions. It
refers to things which happened before, in both the rules and the support
materials. So much so that one person (who\'d never played traveller at all)
looked through the background and asked where "TNE Book 2" was so he could
actually get a grip on the setting.

As for the XBoat list, I havent seen more than 1 item per week since I got
on it. It\'s slow, and doesn\'t have the discussion of the TNE Rules which I
use.

As for RSB being the best supplement for any game, I would suggest looking
at some of the supplements for RuneQuest, Ars Magica,and Star Wars: They
all have at least one of Equal or better quality. It\'s nice, but not
enough. In fact, Chris, what I wanted was for GDW to have included the 1
page needed for the Continuity Fix. A little more detail on the XWeb would
have been nice.

GDW is gouging their customers (Myself included) with their pricing.
Compare  Task Force Games and GDW: TFG $19.95 buys 150-200 pages. $14.95 to
TFG gets you about 100 pages. GDW charges $19.95 MSRP for 96 pages.

That wasn\'t my point - although it does show clearly that GF X-Ray lasers have 
the best range in space. What is also shows is that the effective range of a 
non GF X-Ray laser is more than half that of an equivalent GF tuneable. As the 
X-Ray laser would be able to muster four times the discharge energy of the 
tuneable, HPGs being equal, the X-Ray would have better damage at short range, 
and equal at long range

This was my point - Even in atmospheres the X-Ray lasers are much more effectve 
than tuneables.
Compare:
Visible light: Range factor 20       RangeMod in atmosphere 7 = 0.1
Extreme X-Ray: Range factor 100,000  RangeMod in atmosphere 7 = 0.01

The visible light is ten times better in terms of the modifier to effective 
range, but this comes nowhere near to overcoming the natural advantage of the 
X-Ray range factor, which is 5000 times that of visible light.

Probably right. Anyway, GF focal arrays for X-Rays can be made really small so 
you could install one easily.

I agree the crew requirements are too high. Mind you, all that energy has to go 
somewhere, if you have a powerplant which is twice the size, then you probably 
have systems hanging off it which need a significant number of engineers too. 
It might be best to think of one or two engineers being responsible for the 
actual powerplant, and having the others overseeing more complicated systems 
which draw heavily on the powerplant, like PA spinal mounts (how many engineers 
does CERN need to operate?).

I agree -- but that\'s not based on ever playing TNE, just
skimming some of the materials and this list.  I just read
H. Beam Piper\'s _Space Vikings_ for the first time, and
recommend it to anyone running a TNE game (good luck
finding a copy, though).  Space Vikings is set after the
collapse of a large Terran political entity, and concerns
forays by people from the Sword Worlds, who had seceded
from that entity, into the ruins.

It did carry over to Megatraveller. I think the point is that any interesting 
Noble would actually have a career, and this is recognised in TNE. After all, 
if he\'s not a naval officer, he isn\'t a rich interstellar tourist and he isn\'t 
a diplomat, then what exactly does he do? - Not very much, so he\'s hardly 
likely to get involved in anything more adventurous than organising a social 
function.

overly-complex and unforgiveably typo-ridden.  Basically, I see them as 
more flash and less substance (unfortunately, this seems to be a trend 
for RPG\'s in general).  Ok, I can hear you: 
"enough with the opinion peice!"  I do have some substantive questions:

1. Can someone please explain the TNE personnal combat system (or refer me
to an explanation of it)?  If I\'m reading it right, weapons do 
ridiculously low damage.

2. Does anyone know if there\'s an errata sheet out there for TNE?  Either 
I\'m reading this book wrong, or I\'m missing some complete tables (Does 
GDW not have a copy editor?)

3. Is there a mailing list like this for Classic Traveller?

Here are blurbs on all the Traveller Boardgames I know of that predate TNE:

I haven\'t played 5fw, but have read it. I wish I had a copy. It\'s supposed
to be pretty good, and it looked playable.
 ----

I have played it. FFW does give a good feel for the grand maneovre of the 
various forces and the problems of communications time lag.
It does however have a few problems:
1. This game is SLOW. It seems to take forever to do anything.
2. Each turn is supposed to represent a week but in this time a plotting 0 
or 1 admiral can:
a) receive and assess intelligence from other systems ( which are at least 1 
week away)
b) jump the fleet to a new system ( takes a week )
c) refuel at gas giants in the new system ( takes a day or two at least )
d) fight a space battle ( another couple of days )
e) travel insystem to the mainworld ( some more days )
f) fight SDB\'s and bombard the world in preparation for landing ( a day or 
so )
g) land ground forces
h) fight a two week ground campaign. ( two weeks as in Invasion: Earth )

Either the turn is really a lot longer ( at least a month ) or the order in 
which things may be done in a turn should be reversed.
ie. 1) enemy troops on planet? fight ground combat.
2) no enemy space forces in system? fight SDB\'s, bombard and land troops.
3) fight space battles
etc......

 ----
Imperium is excellent, but is distinctly pre-classic in setting... exact
details escape me, and I don\'t wan\'t to dig it out. It is very fun, and
plays quickly (1 war in aboput 2-4 hours, campaigns can take up to  20
wars!
 ----

Also Dark Nebula which uses the same system to game the expansion of the 
Aslan against the scattered Solomani during the long night.

 ----
Invasion Earth is the final battle of Earth during the Solomani Rim War
(imp 1002 or so). I have played it, with a friend, and then went out and
got a copy. the regiment-brigade level operations are great, and it
included rules for integrating with traveller ---- and the old MT Rebellion
sourcebook gives troop strengths that can be used in it!.
 ----

The same system as FFW but with more ground detail.
Unfortunately one of the most boring games around...

 ----
Mayday was the Classic Traveller Space Combat system done with counters on
a hex grid. Excellent, quick and dirty.
 ----

It uses the past-present-future system of movement that should be used for 
most space combat games but hasn\'t been seen again until Battlerider.

 ----
Snapshot was the boardgame adaptation of CT\'s personal combat system;
better laid out, now usefull only for the maps.
 ----

Unless you\'re still using CT in which case it\'s reference card is pretty 
useful for combat and the initiative point system can be used to make things 
a bit more interesting :)

 ----
Azhanti High Lightning and Striker were the same system; AHL was using a
grid map and counters aboard ships, and striker was minis. AHL is well
worth buying for the complete deckplans of the AHL class ships (400000ton
FI-14).
 ----

I thought AHL weapon ratings were slightly different to Striker ( warning: I 
do not own a copy of AHL to refer to).

I think you can get the needed Continuity Fix for a mere $10-12 in the form
of the booklet Survival Margin. I borrowed a copy from a friend in order to
find out what had changed in the Traveller Universe since I last played c.
1985.

It\'s subjective, of course.  For those players who haven\'t played Traveller 
before, as you have mentioned, it would be nice.  For those of us who\'ve 
been with the game for eons, we already know so damn much about the Xboat 
system, the info would be superfluous for us.  I agree that GDW should be 
in the practice of catering to new players.  Promoting growth is the only 
way to stay in business.


Responding to Susan Shock:

>>Don\'t get me wrong; I enjoy and appreciate Traveller\'s unique history and
rich background. I just think TNE is about HOPE, not despair.
  "Dark" games, such as Vampire, Werewolf etc. and pretty much all 
Cyberpunk games, are set in worlds where this is no hope; this is what 
makes them so dark.
I simply do not see this in TNE.  It is not my intent to slam anyone; I 
just would like to know why so many people think TNE is so "dark". <<

Comparatively speaking, TNE _is_ "dark."  The complaining you\'re picking up 
is predominantly old guard Traveller players who wanted the status quo to 
continue.  I can\'t exactly say as I entirely disagree with them, but I\'m 
willing to accept what GDW has done and go with it.  Traveller has perhaps 
the richest background in all of RPGaming and I get a lot of enjoyment out 
of participating in each and every level of history.

Check the rules in TNE.  They say that Interview "is IDENTICAL to

based upon.  In Dark Conspiracy, a journalist uses Interrogation (as
does any other character in that game), but in Traveller he uses Interview
(while no one else does).  That\'s two ways that GDW is telling us these two
skills are the same.  Therefore, I stand by my previous recommendation --
kill Interview in favor of Interrogation.

History
----
The design was commissioned in the Regency in 1190 after the discovery that the 
designer of the Cuspid gunboat had accepted massive bribes from particle 
accelerator manufacturers. The Fortuity-class mounts a laser capable of 
inflicting critical hits on ships where the Cuspid\'s particle accelerator would 
be blocked by armour. In particular, this allows the deployment of the design 
against virally infected close escorts and patrol cruisers from the wilds. In 
addition, the high penetration performance allows the fighters some success in 
engaging larger vessels.
Squadrons of these fighters are found in carriers and orbital spaceports 
throughout the Regency, normally in a ratio of one FF-24 for every four VF-25s.

Well, compared to CT, TNE is "dark."  In CT, the only wars were with 
other people.  The only Civil War that had occurred in the Third 
Imperium prior to the Big Oops of 1116 hadn\'t disrupted normal functioning 
much -- it wasn\'t a far step from \'business as usual,\' apparently.  TNE\'s a 
bit of a ray of sunshine compared to MT, though.  Gosh, that Civil War.  Talk
about a hopeless situation...

Exploring strange, new worlds for fun and profit, and then
reporting the results to the Imperial Astrographical
Society? Exploring more thoroughly worlds that IGS has
already mapped and surveyed, and reporting to IAS?

Managing the fief, including establishing trade and
diplomatic contacts with neighbors, putting down insurgents
(one of the reasons fiefs are given is to have someone
other than the Imperial military quash insurgencies), 
raiding the neigbors (under the guise of putting down local 
insurgents, maybe)?

Attending court, whether the Emperor\'s or just the 
subsector duke\'s, and becoming involved in -- or initiating 
-- various intrigues to benefit one\'s own faction at the 
expense of one\'s enemies?

I think nobles have plenty of adventuring opportunities 
just by virtue of being nobles.

Subject : New fighter variants

Field trials of the FF-24(R) and FF-25(R) fighters have been completed and the 
unit has been approved for an initial production run. The new fighters are 
based closely on the Fortuity class. However, the new designs have been fitted 
with advanced robotic pilots. The volume savings allow greater fuel endurance, 
and the lack of any life support requirements allows the fighters to remain on 
station indefinitely, subject only to fuel endurance. Advanced programming 
routines and a direct data link from the robotic pilot to the craft allow 
performance which is far superior to all but the very best human pilots.
In testing, the data structure of the robotic brain proved resistant to 
infection by 98% of virus strains. However, as a backup, a small nuclear device 
is fitted with its trigger linked to a laser communicator and independent power 
supply. On transmission of a million digit code the device can be activated, 
neutralising any infected units.
The fighters work superbly as a unit, each capable of taking command if 
necessary, and all aware of their exact role in an attack. Battle readiness can 
be maintained permanently, and fighters deployed in a defensive role can be 
scrambled within seconds.
First production units should be received within the year.

Evaluation and testing continue on the FF-25(M) and FF-26.

Vincennes:
Sorry I\'m a bit late on this discussion, but I just found an interesting 
reference in the MT referee\'s companion:
\'Tech levels over 16 are alomst never encountered in the Megatraveller universe 
except as artifact tech levels. There is only one exception to this in the 
entire Imperium: Sabmiqys (Antares 2117). Sabmiqys possesses an active, 
developingtech 17 culture, but because of social reasons the population of 
Sabmiqys is planetbound. Their space transport tech level is 8, they are 
without jumpdrive........\'
It seems that prototype Vincennes TL17 might replace the hard to get technology 
from this planet (assuming Sabmiqys got blown to pieces in the war - finding 
out could be an interesting adventure).

Being a noble was never a career.  Nobles and their advisors have
always had another career.  For example, how many Dukes and Archdukes
were in the Navy.  How many were bereaucrats?  Their advisors are
likely to come from the same walks of life, or had a career in what
their function is (Norris\' proctologist was a Doctor, Craig\'s

Well, as I recall, back in CT, there was an expanded character generation

Social Standing of sufficient rank. On the other hand I pretty much with

From: Christopher_Griffen@dmcwave.com (Christopher Griffen)
Subject: Imperiallines J-6 Frontier Transport

The following is my conversion of the Frontier Transport, presented in the 
World Tamer\'s Handbook, into the Jump-6 version used in the Rebellion 
Sourcebook adventure, "Nail Mission," or at least some facsimile thereof, 
in TNE stats.  The basic purpose of the top-secret J-6 transport was 
missions of utmost importance to the Imperium.  J-6 transports were used to 
carry the news of the Rebellion, for instance, across the galaxy to the 
edges of the Imperium as fast as possible.  Several of these ships survive 
today in the service of the Regency Navy.

NOTES
The Frontier Transport was originally built as a multi-purpose cargo vessel 
used for trade in undeveloped areas.  The design was a proprietary design 
belonging to Imperiallines, that primarily served worlds situated off the 
main trade routes.

This variant of the Frontier Transport was built for exclusive use by 
Imperial officials in the days of the Third Imperium.  Equipped for Jump-6, 
the ship was used to carry equipment, personnel and information over great 
distances in a short period of time.  Many Regency governments maintain 
secret use of these ships and contain them in clandestine orbital 
facilities.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

I never could understand this big "secrecy" thing when it was well-known,
according to CT Supp.6 "Fighting Ships..." that the Imperial Navy had
numbers of J6 Fleet Couriers. If the Imperial Navy was using them it
only seems logical that other Imp. gov. branches were too.

Let\'s see... 
o  The once mighty civilization is dead; it killed itself and BILLIONS
   of other people, including other races. Scrabbling through ruins of 
   things you can no longer build seems a bit dark to me.

o  Technology, if you run across it elsewhere, may be infected by an 
   intelligence that will try to kill you. It may also be better than anything
   you can muster.  Seems hopeful.

o  The RC campaign seems to consist (for most of the published 
   adventures) of simply bringing superior technology in the form of
   higher firepower against a problem (usually a \'TED" defined as 
   someone who has a higher technology they won\'t share with the RC).
   Perhaps if less violent adventures were available I might have a 
   different opinion, but they are not.  I have sufficient other reasons I
   do not like the TNE setting to not bother writing any myself, mostly 
   having to do with historical and logical  disconnects that I have 
   written about in the past and won\'t bore you with now.

>In the TNE universe, the darkness is LIFTING. 
At the point of a gun.  And "lifting" is relative.   I prefer reasonably
realistic effects, so:

o  It takes more than 5 RC (or Regency)  administrators with a few pocket 
   computers working for a few months to restore a planet to civilization. 

o  It  takes years, thousands of teachers, advisors, engineers, tons of 
   equipment, parts, supplies, overcoming prejudice, putting down rebellion 
   against outsiders.  The RC (or the Regency) will not realistically "bring 
   civilization back\' to many places in a five-year (game) time frame.  
   Certainly not in the RC, where so much effort (and spoils from beyond) 
   is spent trying to raise the home planet economies and  technology base.
  
I will even admit that GDW has toned down their original "Ravening wolf Space
Viking" approach they originally espoused (mostly in response to TML/TNE
howls), but they lost part sof their audience.  Including me.

>Facing the unknown and conquering it is much

I will certailny agree that TNE is not as dark as these choices.  But I
don\'t find it a
particularly sweetness and light game either.  Especially if played with
minor realism,
like the opinions of the locals after you smash the best items they have.
"We have destroyed the evil TED in his lair.  You are free."
"You also destroyed the only defenses this planet had against intrusion from
space,
and 80% of the nation\'s power generating equipment."

It is not my intent to slam you. It is not my intent to change your opinions of 
Traveller:TNE. Some people see the game differently. I hope I answered your
question.

The density of the rockets lead one to believe that most of the 
volume is supporting structure, of whatever shape, thus it
makes a passible estimate to use armor values as a mode of
comparison.

I haven\'t done SD or BSD versions, because these were developed
for Steve\'s FF&S Trillion Credit Squadron-by-email game, which 
starts at TL10.  He\'s still got openings, if you are interested...

I kinda like the idea of big military ships using fusion drives... makes
large marshalling areas away from the major world(s) make sense.  In CT
really big ships usually didn\'t land (like above 5000tons, right?).
That might be Imperial military standards... ships 5kt and below are
fitted with HEPlaR for operating near commercial traffic.  Big ships
would have a small HEPlaR as a backup, and for close ship operations.
>>
Well, we\'ve always argued that HEPlaR are just a big a torch as
a Fusion Rocket, only less efficient. So... for docking, my ships carry
very small chemical rocket packs for docking maneuvers, and 
otherwise just watch where they point their torches.  For 
atmospheric operations, that\'s what the above free item
(Fusion Ram-Jet) was developed for.  In GURPS Vehicles, it is
known as the Fusion Air-Ram... A small fusion reactor heats
intake air and spits a superheated air-jet out the back, along with
its own exhaust.  The exhaust is mildly radioactive--not dangerous,
but trackable with a Geiger counter or similar detector... and is
about as hot as a jet engine of similar thrust.

Does anyone have access to resonably detailed information on crew levels for
modern (20th Century) Ships?  Not the usual Officers vs O/R sort of thing, but 
something offering enough detail concerning roles or department to permit
validation (or otherwise) of some of the formulae GDW uses for calculating
crew sizes?  

Granted we are not going to find out the required support crew for a 500 Ton
jump drive, but we would at least have some hard data points to throw
around, expecially on things like numbers and stations of officers, or
required "Steward" and "Medical" staffing.

Anyone who has such data could send it to me: I would be happy to analyze it
and reportto the group.

Response to RFT from Congress of Rimward States (Traveller Digest 447) 
 
Sorry for the delay, but it took awhile for me to get this put together. 
It is my first attempt at design, so please look it over carefully for
errors (the spreadsheet all seems to work out properly, so I think it is
okay).

The Jayhawk Enforcer (Far Trader) - C has been designed as an anti-piracy
vessel under the terms of the Request For Tender put forth by the Congress
of Rimward States in 1202.  The class, although limited in offensive punch
should be able to hold its own defensively, even against Gazelle Class
Close Escort class vessels.  Armor, maneuver drive and sensor upgrades will
increase survivability and allow the launch of onboard fighter craft.  The
class has been designed with a minimal hanger capable of holding either a
15 ton Avalon class fighter or 20 ton Camelot Class Gig (PAW) at the
Admiralty\'s choice.  The fighter carries a TL-12 180 Mj Laser Lance while
the Gig carries a TL-12 256 Mj Particle Accelerator Weapon.

Another companion vessel to the Jayhawk Enforcer, the Camelot Gig carries a
fairly substantial, if short-ranged punch to take on heavier vessels.  The
Particle Accelerator spinal mount will provide a nasty surprise to
predatory vessels. 
 
Note that the cost of the Enforcer plus Avalon comes in at MCr 127.35 while
the Enforcer plus Camelot is MCr 134.14 (no standard discount factored in).
 The listed price of the Jayhawk is MCr 57.50 (presumed to be 80%
discounted price).  200% of the prototype Jayhawk cost = MCr 143.75.  Thus
the Enforcer plus one of either small craft comes in at below 200% of base.

Howdy,

there are a couple of problems I notice right off the bat.  All the
ships are too massive to have the g ratings you give them.

The Jayhawk as designed is about 1.8 gs, not 3 (it doesn\'t fall into the
15*hull_displacement (tons) rules for gs, so you divide thrust by mass
to get gs (total thrust MW*20)/Mass.

The Avalon is 1.3 gs, and the Gig is 1.4gs.  In all cases for BL you\'d
have to round down.

You wouldn\'t know this if you had an old copy of BL and not FFS
(although my BL doesn\'t seem to have any indication of a version on it
at all (the only copyright type info I see is on the back of the ship
design booklet and it doesn\'t have any print run info or anything)).

On a related note, I haven\'t had the $$ to get RSB yet ($1300 plumbing
disaster :-( but I noticed that the PAW fighter in there is way over
mass, but has the right thrust MW for an uncorrected design (ie: it
doesn\'t perform as advertised)----at least I think it was that one.  How are the 
others?   As soon as I have some bucks to spare I\'ll have it handy ($20, 
yeesh!).

Is the volume you list the minimum volume, and the rest of the values
are per kl?

Also, you used the armor values for comparison, but what % of the unit
kl did you assume was structure (That way I could do the SD, and BSD
versions and have \'em work with your stuff)?

Huh?  Roger, could you clarify that statement a bit?  DGP, to my knowledge, 
has been out of business since about 1992, when TNE got fired up.  They 
shut down their Oregon phone number a while back and closed the doors.  If 
you are correct, though, I\'d be interested in a good hard look at A.I. if 
and when they do it.

Well, compared to CT, TNE is "dark."  In CT, the only wars were with 
other people.  The only Civil War that had occurred in the Third 
Imperium prior to the Big Oops of 1116 hadn\'t disrupted normal functioning 
much -- it wasn\'t a far step from \'business as usual,\' apparently.  TNE\'s a 
bit of a ray of sunshine compared to MT, though.  Gosh, that Civil War.  
Talk
about a hopeless situation...<<

That\'s what I meant but "comparatively," Wes.  CT was a bright shining 
universe for the most part, filled with subtlety as opposed to the 
hyperbole of throwing the entire Imperium in the toilet.

Yeah, the Civil War was hopeless.  I think "Hard Times" communicated that 
better than anything else.  I ran that adventure in \'91.  I only wish GDW 
saw fit to make the players\' efforts worth _something_.  The achievement of 
the adventure, helping to secure the Khavle Accordment pocket empire, was 
all for naught.  Practically the whole area is listed with zero-level 
populations in TNE.  <Sigh.>


Responding to Phil\'s statement about the J-6 transport:

>>I never could understand this big "secrecy" thing when it was well-known,
according to CT Supp.6 "Fighting Ships..." that the Imperial Navy had
numbers of J6 Fleet Couriers. If the Imperial Navy was using them it
only seems logical that other Imp. gov. branches were too.<<

Seems to me that anyone could build a J-6 ship if they want to and have 
access to a TL-15+ shipyard.  Still, I like the whole secrecy thing.  It 
lends an aura of mystery and intrigue to the game.

Response to RFT from Congress of Rimward States (Traveller Digest 447) 
 
Sorry for the delay, but it took awhile for me to get this put together. 
It is my first attempt at design, so please look it over carefully for
errors (the spreadsheet all seems to work out properly, so I think it is
okay).

The Jayhawk Enforcer (Far Trader) - C has been designed as an anti-piracy
vessel under the terms of the Request For Tender put forth by the Congress
of Rimward States in 1202.  The class, although limited in offensive punch
should be able to hold its own defensively, even against Gazelle Class
Close Escort class vessels.  Armor, maneuver drive and sensor upgrades will
increase survivability and allow the launch of onboard fighter craft.  The
class has been designed with a minimal hanger capable of holding either a
15 ton Avalon class fighter or 20 ton Camelot Class Gig (PAW) at the
Admiralty\'s choice.  The fighter carries a TL-12 180 Mj Laser Lance while
the Gig carries a TL-12 256 Mj Particle Accelerator Weapon.

Another companion vessel to the Jayhawk Enforcer, the Camelot Gig carries a
fairly substantial, if short-ranged punch to take on heavier vessels.  The
Particle Accelerator spinal mount will provide a nasty surprise to
predatory vessels. 
 
Note that the cost of the Enforcer plus Avalon comes in at MCr 127.35 while
the Enforcer plus Camelot is MCr 134.14 (no standard discount factored in).
 The listed price of the Jayhawk is MCr 57.50 (presumed to be 80%
discounted price).  200% of the prototype Jayhawk cost = MCr 143.75.  Thus
the Enforcer plus one of either small craft comes in at below 200% of base.

Use a diplomat, bureaucrat or military officer. Choose leadership whenever

I completely agree with you on this, but look at all the possibilities you 
highlight above - could any one career address all of these? A noble career to 
cover all the different sorts of noble would have access to almost any skill 
cluster. For this reason, it makes more sense to use standard careers, but 
maybe pay them in line with the wealthy traveller career. The only real thing 
which would unify all the people described above would be a high social 
standing, and it is this, and player defined background, which would define a 
noble, not some career.

	Especially since the example that was mentioned in an earlier 
message mentioned destroying the planet\'s space defenses and power 
system...the RC High Command should crucify crews who do that...the 
whole point is removing the TED not trashing the tech.

	The next time your players do something dumb like that, punish them 
appropriately.

	But, in general I agree with Rob...there\'s too much emphasis on 
smashing and grabbing.

>I agree about the Reformation Coalition\'s morals.  We came, we saw, we

	Similar seeds are already there in the GDW canonic universe.  
There\'s a small scale rebellion currently sputtering along on 
Oriflamme, where some returning Marines took a long hard look at 
their world and asked the intelligent question: \'Just what is the 
difference between a TED and a Feudal Technocracy, anyway?\'

>Question: how many people are interested in non-combat adventures within the

	I\'m currently getting stuff together to run an RC-setting campaign, 
that takes place mostly in the Solomani Rim sector.  The players will 
get horribly mis-jumped deep into this unknown territory, and with a 
broke-down ship and their wits, will have to get back to the RC.  
Can\'t do a whole lot of giant battles when you look in your ship\'s 
locker and see that you have 50 rounds of ACR ammunition, two 
rifles, and a body pistol with two full clips. 

	The key to having non-combat centered adventures is to a) make 
combat really deadly and b) make the alternatives exciting and 
enjoyable.

The Secret J-6 route was designed to look exactly like J-4 Imperiallines
Cargo ships, so that their travel would be unnoticed. Unless, of course,
you get a good neutrino sensor fix on it as it preps for jump... which is a
little late to stop it.

Such little tidbits were the hallmark of CT and MT.

As for "Dark Traveller" -- The virus is very dangerous, and far more common
on the tables, than the text implies. In sending a group out from the RC,
they encountered Vampyre Ships 2 of 3 jumps. They died freeing a world from
the virus. Every player group I have GM\'d or talked with about their TNE
experiences compares it to Vampire: the Masquerade. Vampire is about angst;
TNE just causes angst. And RSB includes Anagathic B, which is another
"dark" touch. By no means is the New Era the sweetness and light GDW wants
people to think it is.

My only real beef with the TNE rule system is that PC\'s are much more
damage resistant than NPC\'s, unless you use the optional "Shock" rule, and
then that rule says only to use it for NPC\'s... I haven\'t seen such blatent
PC=ubermenschen rules since FGU\'s _Space Opera_. I use the following system
to cure the combat "problem" (Note that a .22cal *CANNOT* kill an NPC
unless the "shock" rule is used).

Increase damage dice to D10\'s for firearms and weapons, 1d6 for -1 rated
weapons, and use the quick kill "shock" rule universally. No more charging
Machine gun nests, unless you are in Battle Dress (where the 1 point per
die leak (kinetic pass through) adds up... quickly!).

As for those suggesting I get a Classic or Mega Supplement ____:
I have CT books 1-8, Supplements 1-13, TTA, AHL, Striker, Best of JTAS,
TD11+, alien modules 1+.
For MT, I have PM, RM, IE, Ref\'s Companion, Rebellion Sourcebook, Survival
Margin, Hard Times, World Builder\'s, Starship Operators\', COACC,
Vilani&Vargr, Solomani&Aslan, MTJ1 &3.
So quit telling me I need Supplement ___.

What I\'ve been waiting for for almost a decade now is a major consolidation
of what is out, for whatever the current rules system is. TNE is the best
Rules... but the CT background won the Literature Awards....

     Hello All

     It is with regret that I have to sign off from this mailing list.  My
     internet access is through work and today they noticed that I was
     subscribed to a non-work related mailing list.  This is a problem as
     the AARNET has been privatised in Australia.  We are now paying for
     each message received.

     What happened was that another person had used the traveller mailing
     list to send mail about an internet role playing group.  This message
     got stuck in our internal mailing system causing it to crash.  The
     mail administrator suggested that I unsubscribe from mailing lists to
     avoid spaming.

     I enjoyed the discussions and wish that I had more time to contribute.

The laser looks like it is broken.  A 740 MJ laser should have over
nine displacement-tons of homopolar generators alone, which is more
than the entire fighter displaces.  I suspect that Brendan used DE
instead of IE in the calculation, reducing the HPG bank size by a
factor of five in error.  My design for the largest laser legal at
tech-15 under TL*50 came in at twelve tons with a rapid-fire 2400 Mm
range tunable lens.  I\'ll post the design shortly.
