Ahh, Stereo Lithography.  We\'re contemplating buying one of those at work.
It would come in real handy.  Heck we just spent $20k on a PCB prototyper.
The PCB prototyper has already paid for itself at least once over, since
we do a lot of quick-turn boards.

But no, the device I\'m thinking of is something else.  For one thing, when
you turn off the lasers, the balls (beads, dust, whatever..) lose their 
form and fall back to the bottom of the unit.  Stereo lithography devices
make a permanent item.  

This was all highly experimental at the smallest scale even two years ago.
It was being used as a tool to understand and test certain properties of
atomic clusters and molecules.  Using it as a sort of solid hologram that
could be interacted with is purely my own idea.  If I had the time, I\'d go
find some references to it, but UF is 45 minutes away.  (sigh)  I wanted to

go last weekend, but my daughter has the chicken pox.


Last night I had another idea for interesting innovations.  This one would
be a hybrid of your standard storage locker and the force fields that hold 
in the air on an open hanger deck.  If you figure that the field is causing

the air at the interface to solidify to a certain degree, then you could
use this principle to solidify the air inside of lockers and other storage 
spaces, even the cargo hold, to hold the stored items down.  This would be
useful in an open cargo hold, to replace the tie downs that would normally
keep the cargo in place.  It wouldn\'t be a good idea to walk into it
however,
since you\'d suffocate. Hmm, maybe it could be used as a ranged weapon, or 
even an anti-hijacking device.  

	...After securing the surviving crew, strange that there were so few
	of them, we advanced to the bridge where we were met with no resistance.
	Pol took the pilot\'s seat and I took the sensor station.  As Barg took
	his place at the weapons console the air seemed to shimmer for a split
	second, then I was seized by a horrible pain in my chest.  I couldn\'t
	breath!!  I could hardly move, it was if the air had turned to molasses.
	Instantly I knew my only chance for survival was to leave the bridge.
	I clawed my way to the hatch through a sea of invisible mud and just
	reached it, ah air!.  The last thing I remember is rolling over and
	seeing a blaster pointed at my face, then something hard hit me in
	the side of the head...

Nasty stuff really.  It won\'t work if you have a sealed suit or battle
dress
on, but it\'s pretty effective otherwise.

I for one do not!

Specifications

   The vessel to be produced is an exploratory trader. The design is
   being commissioned by the Imperial government (through the Ministry of
   Commerce); their intent is that vessels of this class will be
   purchased and operated by megacorporations and possibly smaller
   speculative enterprises. Subsidies are under consideration.
   
   The following requirements must be met:
     * Size: 3000 dt or less
     * Jump: J2 or more
     * Acceleration: 1G or more
       
   The vessel must be capable of:
     * Wilderness refueling (directly or via carried craft)
     * Operation for 1+ year away from starport facilities (repair,
       resupply, recreation, etc.)
     * Landing/retrieving crew and cargo on planetary surfaces (directly
       or via carried craft)
     * Defense against similarly sized TL 11- spacecraft
       
   Defense against relic TL 12+ weaponry should also be considered.
   
   Provision must be made for security of landing parties and the care of
   wounded crew members.
   
   The purpose of this vessel is exploratory trade, well beyond the
   Imperial frontier. As such, normal economic analysis based on
   intra-Imperial trade profitability does not apply well to this vessel.
   However, as with any trader, a higher percentage of hull volume
   devoted to cargo implies higher profits -- if the requirements above
   are also met. The same comments apply to the vessel\'s price.

   Famille Spofulam Yards is pleased to announce its entry for this
   month\'s THUDDD competition. FSY\'s philosophy for this ship class is
   that medium is better; several medium-size ships can cover more
   territory, visiting more systems, than a single large vessel. Thus, a
   megacorporation equipped with a fleet of Recollets, rather than a few
   large vessels, will be able to better explore the new markets on the
   fringes of the Imperium or beyond. As well, smaller entrepreneurs will
   be able to afford an extremely capable frontier trader. However, too
   small a vessel will have severe shortcomings in cargo capacity and
   defensive punch, not to mention small-craft and repair facilities.
   Thus, we here at FSY feel that a medium-sized vessel, capable of
   extended duration, with self-repair and small-craft facilities, good
   defenses, and fair cargo capacity, is the best approach to commercial
   exploration beyond the Imperial pale. Hence, the Recollet-class
   Exploratory Trader.
   
   The Recollet is built into a rock solid 500-ton streamlined
   wedge-configuration hull, stressed to 10 G\'s for atmospheric
   operations, and heavily armoured. The Recollet is equipped with fuel
   scoops capable of ingesting its full fuel load in slightly over 45
   minutes, and refining it in just over three hours. It is also equipped
   with a 40-ton hangar capable of accomodating a standard 20-ton launch
   (not included in MSRP) or serving as supplementary cargo or storage
   space. Other facilities designed to extend the Recollet\'s duration in
   the field include an electronics shop and a machine shop, and 2 years
   fuel storage for its 375 Mw Zhunastu Fusion Systems power plant. Its
   hold is capable of accomodating 102 tons of cargo, accessed via four
   large cargo hatches.
   
   The Recollet is capable of accelerations of up to 2Gs, driven by a
   Famille Spofulam Gravitics Thruster Plate unit, and boasts the longest
   range (3 parsecs) jump drive currently available.
   
   As it is designed to venture far beyond the protective umbrella of the
   Imperial Navy, the Recollet packs two 251 megajoule Ling Standard
   heavy lasers linked by MFD, as well as one nuclear damper and a
   sandcaster. The Recollet\'s weapons suite therefore provides
   significant firepower, and is capable of dealing with either laser or
   missile-equipped (typical of lower-TL cultures) opponents.
   
   As typical for FSY\'s civilian craft, accomodations are luxurious;
   command, sensor, flight deck, senior gunner, and engineering crew
   sleep in six large staterooms, while the gunners and steward each have
   a single small stateroom to themselves. Eight small staterooms are
   provided for middle passengers. Given that the Recollet will often be
   operated with a lower crew complement of three gunners (with the
   lasers being fired by the MFD gunner) and no steward, up to 11 middle
   passengers may be carried. Crew quarters may be shifted into smaller
   staterooms to accomodate High passengers if necessary. A sickbay is
   provided, as are 10 low berths.
   
   The result is a highly capable vessel with a surprisingly low price
   tag of only 226 Mcr (launch not included) which we here at FSY feel
   will become extremely popular among those venturing beyond the
   frontiers of the Imperium to seek fortune, adventure, and to increase
   the glory of the Imperium.
   
    Designer\'s comments (in no particular order):
    
     * I wanted to keep the vessel fairly small, for role-playing
       reasons; I think that the fewer NPC crew, the better.
     * In designing the weapons suite, I assumed that lower-TL opponents
       would likely to be relying heavily on nuke missiles for long-range
       offence; hence the damper. IMHO sandcasters also ought to be
       effective against missiles too. And the lasers could also be used
       as anti-missile defences.
     * The 10 low berths were included a) for freezing shot-up
       crewmembers and b) in case of misjump. Low passengers might also
       be safer in uncivilized parts of the universe, too.
     * Crew and passenger numbers in the USD are for full complement,
       with skeleton crew numbers in (parentheses).
     * An option which might be popular would be to remove the hangar in
       favour of cargo space, which would add 20 tons of cargo and cut
       0.162 Mcr from the ticket price. The shops could likewise be
       removed, adding a further 16 tons of cargo and lowering the ticket
       price a further 0.27 Mcr. However, I think that for a vessel with
       a partly exploratory vocation, they\'re more useful than the extra
       cargo capacity.
     * Sensors crew numbers came out to 1.4, which I rounded down. In
       general, I\'ve assumed a fairly cross-trained crew.
     * I think that I\'ve nailed the design specs this time. It\'s under
       3000 tons, exceeds the M & J drive specs, and is capable of
       wilderness refuelling. It\'s capable of double the 1-year field
       duration, landing crew either by itself or via small craft, and
       (IMHO) is capable of dealing with equal or lower-TL opponents. And
       it still carries a fair amount of cargo.

    Notes:
    
   Long Yards is proud to announce the launch of its\' Encounter Class
   Trader the Encounter. Answering the Imperium\'s call for a long long
   range "Exploratory Trading Vessel" to open up new markets beyond the
   frontier, we present the Encounter.
   
   The Encounter is a 2000 ton steamlined wedge with state of the art
   Jump-3, and 3g acceleration (4g with the 1g contra grav system used
   "close in to worlds"). Since it is expected to operate outside the
   frontier we have equipped the Encounter with 4 imprved heavey laser
   turrets, each with its\' own MFD and gunner. Add to this the 2 heavey
   missle turrets with 25 tons of missle storage for each turret, and we
   feel that the Ecounter can well take care of itself in almost any
   "hostile situation". On the defensive side of the coin we have heavily
   armored the hull and installed 2 sandcaster turrets, each with its\'
   own MFD. In addition to the "casters" we have equipped the Encounter
   with a 30,000 km nuclear damper, and a 25Mw meson screen.
   
   In addition we have installed a 16 bed sickbay, a vehicle shop, and an
   engineering shop to make the veesel as self sufficient as possible for
   those long voyages. We have also included 2, 30 ton minimal hangers
   for the ships auxilaries, (To be determined by the purchaser - not
   included in vessel price).
   
   Realizing that the Encounter would be operating "in the rough" we have
   installed fuel scoops that can scoop the full fuel load in 1.7 hrs and
   a purification plant that can have it ready to use in 6.2 hrs.
   
   Don\'t think for a minute that with all this "hardware" that we\'ve
   forgotten the "software" that makes the Encounter run, On the contrary
   we have included 40 small staterooms and 12 large staterooms for the
   crew. In addition we have reserved a 50 ton area as a Recreation room
   that can be outfitted per the buyers wishes, to keep the crew happy
   and fit.
   
   Speaking of the crew in addition to the necessary ships\' crew we\'ve
   included room for 2 brokers, up to 4 small craft pilots and 10
   troops/security personnel. Adding the ability to carry 10 high
   passengers if necessary rounds out the accommodations.
   
   On top of all of these features we\'ve not forgotten the prime mission
   of the vessel, TRADE. We\'ve included 400 tons of cargo space for the
   ship that should prove more than adequate for those long exploratory
   trading voyages.
   
   On top of all these features we continue to provide what we feal is
   the best warranty in the business. If for any reason (other than
   normal wear or battle damage) on of our components or ships should
   fail we will replace it (Either the component or the ship) at no cost
   to the owner (Original purchasers only).

Adult People don\'t get offended because of different opinion. They are
offended because they were insulted! Your constitution give you of free
speech, good! French one too! So the contitution gave you a tool. Now you
can use it correctly (do not understand politically correct!). Education is
supposed to learn you how to use it, it\'s called respect and politness,
have you heard about it?

I\'ve always assumed that my rights always stop where others\' begin. That\'s
why I never permit myself of insulting others (except if I\'ve been severly
insulted meaningless first). 
Arguing, giving opinions, points of view, free speech doesn\'t mean that you
are allowed to be disrespectful of others! Oh I forgot, the constitution
give you this right!

Civilized poeple don\'t insult each other when they disagreed. I understand
why several people want to leave such place. They just want to meet more
adult people! 


>Oh, and if I offended anyone, tough sh!t. Deal with it.

That\'s all the problem!

   Inspired by Sir Arameth Gridlore\'s own legendary travels beyond Sylean
   space, and drawing heavily on his experiences, Gridlore Technologies
   and Trans-C Naval Architects are proud to introduce the -Terrapin-
   Class Exploratory Trader.
   
   The -Terrapin- is an 80m cylinder, flared slightly at the aft for
   better control when wilderness refueling. The ship devotes over a
   third of its gross displacement to cargo storage, enough to prove
   profitable on any run. But there is more to the -Terrapin- than
   carrying freight!
   
   The -Terrapin- is equipped with powerful Quinn-Arturo "Phase III" jump
   drives, allowing jump 3. Standard thrusters grant constant
   acceleration of 1g, and can be overdriven for brief periods if
   necessary. Power is provided by a custom-designed X-tek Fusion plant,
   and is fueled for one year\'s operation at full load.
   
   The electronics suite has been designed with the idea that most places
   the -Terrapin- travels will not have local travel control. Active EMS
   sensors are accurate out to 10 LS, passive sensors to 5. This allows
   early detection of any threat, to allow the maximum decision time for
   the Captain. Communications are routed through either a .3 Mw maser
   array, or broadcast by the 1 Mw radio system. Defensive EMS systems
   include a standard EMS jammer (120k km radius) and a strong area
   jammer (90k km radius.)
   
   If the worst comes, this turtle has teeth! Mounting twelve Isher
   Artifact L-1013 95 Mj laser turrets, organized into four batteries by
   Navy standard FDC-11A2 master fire direction centers, the ship can
   bring effective fire on its enemies. (Note: no allowance has been made
   for direct turret control. All weapons are operated from the MFC.)
   While these powerful beams slice at your foe, you can feel secure,
   guarded by thick armor, 6 sand casters, a *15 Mw* nuclear damper, and
   a 2 Mw meson screen. It isn\'t a warship, but the -Terrapin- can
   certainly hold her own in a fight.
   
   Interface operations will normally be carried out be the -Terrapin
   Transit- shuttle, included in the purchase price.

   The ship has a crew of 49, including a full squad of security
   personnel and berths for a five person research/science section. The
   science section is intended to include such personnel as linguistic
   sophontologists, historians, and others to assist in making contact
   with worlds that may not have seen a Starship since Twilight.
   -Terrapins- have ten small staterooms for passengers. When no
   passengers are boarded, the spare rooms are designed to be used for
   extra berthing space to relieve stress, or as crew recreation
   facilities. Also standard are thirty low passage berths. Workshops are
   provided, capable of fabricating any but the largest, most complex
   parts. Technical specifications are provided in both computer and hard
   format to aid repairs, and most systems having self-diagnostic/repair
   aid programs. A general purpose laboratory can be found on "C" deck.
   This small facility is not designed for in-depth research, but will
   suffice for most inquiries. The ship\'s sick bay can accommodate up to
   16 patients in a pinch, though 10 is standard.
   
   A word about cost. Many designers prefer to work with modular
   components, accepting "close enough" as a substitute for workmanship,
   and then claim that the savings in cost justifies the act. Don\'t be
   fooled. When you are 50pc from the nearest help, close enough isn\'t
   good enough. Trans-C goes to the trouble of designing to the most
   exacting tolerances because we feel your life is worth it. Don\'t you
   agree?
   
    Design Notes:
    
   I have tried to balance merchant and exploratory missions with the
   Terrapin, and feel that it works well in both roles. The fairly large
   cargo capacity, along with the passenger complement, means that the
   ship is profitable; while the strong sensors and on-board labs make
   the ship a reasonable scout cruiser.
   
   This design used the excellent spreadsheet "ss-v2.xls" I can\'t
   remember where I found it, but my hat is off to the author, this is
   very easy to use.
   
   This is a ship for adventures. This is the reason behind the large
   cast of scientists and soldiers. You can boldly go where no one has
   gone before (or, at least for 2000 years...) and play a variety of
   adventures; not just merchant, but military, diplomatic, deep space
   fighting..
   
   Hope you enjoy! as always, comments and questions welcome.

   The Type 1108 is designed as mobile exhibition platform for the
   development of trade in relatively unknown regions, following routes
   just surveyed by the IISS. Designed to exhibit the best Imperial
   industry has to offer for trade, the ship is a mobile sales office for
   the aggresive megacorporation.
   
   The primary mission of an exploratory trader is to exhibit imperial
   technology to new markets. The large cargo capacity of 1000 tons
   standard is available as a single large bay, allowing a wide variety
   of goods to be carried, regardless of bulk. Power, life support, and
   gravity are supplied in the bay to allow product exhibits to mounted
   aboard. Since many products need sales personel to show them off to
   best advantage, 10 large and 10 smaller cabins are provided for
   company representatives. The ship\'s exterior is equiped with a
   graphics overlay (originally developed for military applications),
   which allows display of advertising material while the Type 1108 is in
   port.
   
   Crew security is highly important in non-Imperial areas. The Type 1108
   mounts a large defensive weaponry system consisting of 20 sandcasters,
   10 nuclear dampers, and a meson screen (proper Imperial permits
   required). Although 2G drives are fitted, the hull is stressed to 6G
   to allow for agressive atmospheric manuevering using the airframe
   controls. The weapons systems are designed to be defensive in nature,
   with only limited offensive weaponry - standard practice is for the
   Type 1108 to jump at less than full capacity, allowing rapid re-jump
   if needed. A collapsable tank holding 300 tons of fuel is provided as
   standard equipment, allowing the regular tanks to be filled in jump if
   desired.
   
   For interaction with planetary population, the Type 1108 allows
   several options. The ship itself can land (the prefered method of
   operation), with the large gunnery contigent and dedicated ship\'s
   security force providing security. They are aided by 20 TL-12 security
   robots of the latest type (price included), linked to the ship\'s
   security system and anti-hijack program. If a direct landing is not
   desired, one of the three 30T fast boats can land from orbit, limiting
   crew exposure. Finally, in highly uncertain situations, the crew can
   make use of one of four onboard Companion-type robots, which can
   operate either independantly as negociators or as virtual-reality
   linked contact scouts. When not used in a contact role, the Companions
   are programmed to function as stewards, using protocols developed for
   Generica passenger liners. Price of the Companion robots is included
   in the ship price.
   
   For long-term operation support, an engineering shop and a vehicle
   shop are fitted. Depending on operational profile, standard components
   can be carried in the cargo compartment, to be fabbed for final use by
   the universal machining rig in the engineering shop. The spacious
   hanger allows full maintenance to be carried out on the ship\'s boats,
   up to and including full overhaul. A fuel purification system is
   carried to allow operations in wilderness areas.
   
   To ensure crew health, a four bed sickbay is fitted, along with an
   emergency low berth with 16 person capacity. A laboratory is fitted as
   well, to allow both medical analysis and the testing of trade goods
   aquired during trading trips.
   
   The ship price includes three 30T fast boats (one in hanger, two in
   docking rings), two Rolen Politesse luxury grav cars for crew use on
   planet, and four grav trucks (in the smaller hanger). Other mixes of
   vehicles are avalible on request. All boats and vehicles use Fusion+
   powerplants, allowing demonstration of its advantages to customers.
   
   The crew is housed in small staterooms, with large staterooms for the
   command staff. These generous space allocations are reflected in the
   fine appointments that allow for crew comfort and relaxation
   (supported by the Companion stewards, who care for the crews needs in
   every way). additional space is provided by the 300T demountable tank
   that makes up one third of the standard cargo space. Disassembled in
   jump, it provides 225T free space with full life support for
   recreation. This space can also be used for additional cargo, though
   it limits jump to 2 in that case.
   
   Overall, the Type 1108 provides relatively inexpensive cargo carrying
   on a per ton basis with good defensive and security capabilities and
   long-term endurance. We hope it meets your needs.
   
    Comments:
    
   Can\'t add much to the comments above. Large size allows lots of cargo
   carried with plenty of room for defensive weapons. I rejected military
   grade laser weapons as provocative in a trader. The use of robots
   reflects a desire to provide more service with less cargo demand. I
   see this ship as more of a mobile store than a cargo freighter.

    Description:
    
   The Anderson class exploratory trader is a 2000 displacement ton
   vessel, intended for use in discovering trade goods and markets in
   unfamiliar space. Its most unusual features are a docking bay for a
   100-ton ship, intended for a 100-ton courier but usable by shuttles,
   and its array of collapsible tanks. One set of 200 Td tanks in the
   hangar may be used freely, though this restricts work on craft above
   50 Td displacement (add one level of difficulty to task). If the
   hangar is empty and gear stowed - which takes 12 person-hours - the
   second set of 200 Td tanks may be filled. Standard doctrine also has
   every small craft fitted with collapsible fuel tanks in their cargo
   hold, in order to jump to safety in the case of misjump.
   
   It is expected that the cargo hold will contain spare parts,
   consumables and trade goods. As the voyage progresses, these will be
   replaced by new trade items. Six low berths allow the transport of
   animal specimens or reserve crewmembers.
   
   A 1G HEPlaR drive is fitted as backup to the main thrusters, or for
   emergency acceleration. The powerplants are sufficient to power all
   components simultaneously, although only three 500 MW units are
   required for normal operation (no HEPlaR).
   
   Crew assignments vary, with troops sometimes replaced by scientific
   staff or assigned to small craft. The 12 auxilliary craft crew are
   four mechanics and eight crew members; in practice, they represent
   relief personnel for the main crew, and may not be assigned to one
   craft only.
   
   The price of this ship does not include the J3, 2G courier ship at MCr
   50.6, or any small craft. Common small craft selections are
     * cutter, spare module and launch
     * slow pinnace, ship\'s boat, gig
     * slow pinnace, heavy fighter, gig
       
   although the commercial availability of fighters is extremely low.
   
    Press Release, Imperial Shipping LIC (founded 009-001)
    
   In search of new markets? Need a fresh supplier of those lucrative
   extra-imperial goods? Then you need a ship which can get you there
   before the competition, keep you alive while you skim the cream from
   the local economies, and be on its way before rival firms are
   squabbling over the crumbs you\'ve left them. You need Imperial
   Shipping\'s Anderson class Exploratory Trader, or you need a new job.
   Because if your competitors buy and you don\'t, pretty soon you\'ll need
   one.
   
   Let\'s be honest. It doesn\'t take an Anderson to jump three parsecs in
   a week. Wilderness refuelling is pretty common. Most ships carry a
   small craft or two. So what makes our ship so special? The clean lines
   of a 99m airframe hull?
   
   How about the way it\'s built around a massive 400 Td hangar? (It\'s
   nearly the size of some of our competitors\' ships.)
   
   A hangar that houses a very special scoutship. We can\'t confirm that
   it\'s related to the latest Navy courier. Nor can we deny it. This
   lightly-armed ship can carry enough fuel for two 3-parsec jumps, using
   a collapsible fuel tank to maintain cargo capacity. When your trade
   information won\'t wait, you don\'t have to abandon your expensive
   mission -- just send the Type S3 courier.
   
   A hangar big enough for shuttles to pour trade goods into the ample
   100 Td cargo bay. Just the thing when you\'re receiving goods from
   civilisations that don\'t have Fusion Plus(TM) -- yet!
   
   A hangar which can be used as fuel storage, thanks to innovative use
   of collapsible tanks. (We\'ve put them in the cargo bay, too.)
   
   We\'re nearly as pleased with our hangar as you\'ll be. Especially when
   you need the space for repairs. Or fuel. Or spares. Or an end-of-tour
   celebration.
   
   Of course, we supply fittings for a number of other small craft.
   However, we believe you\'re the best judge of your trading needs, so we
   don\'t force you to take some standard package of craft. Our advisers
   are always ready to help you choose, however, so you\'ve still got all
   the power of Imperial Shipping\'s experience behind you.
   
   You\'ve also got the power of our milspec laser battery, in case of
   trouble. Plus four secondary turrets. Four sandcasters. A nuclear
   damper, in case your potential trading partners haven\'t heard about
   the Imperial ban. A heavily-armoured hull. Even a meson screen.
   (Recent medical research indicates it reduces radiation exposure for
   deep space crews like yours.) And with our Navy-issue sensor gear,
   you\'ll see trouble coming before it sees you.
   
   If you need to run, you\'ve got a HEPlaR drive to boost you away from
   trouble. And of course, two separate main drives means never having to
   say "sundive". Especially when the Anderson has five main 500 MW
   powerplants, runs on two, and cruises on three. Of course, our fuel
   purification plant keeps everything clean, but accidents -- and worse
   -- can happen. That\'s why we\'ve included engineering and vehicle
   shops, to help your engineers keep things running smoothly.
   
   Keeping your crew running smoothly is as important as maintaining your
   drives, so we\'ve included plenty of common space for recreation, as
   well as individual staterooms for every crewmember. We\'ve left you
   space for a security detachment, plus a couple of high passengers. Or
   maybe you want a couple of top scientists to work in the on-board
   analysis lab? Again, it\'s your choice, because trading is your
   business. Designing quality starships is ours.
   
   And because of our key role in establishing standard, modular starship
   components throughout the Imperium, we\'re cheaper than you\'d think.
   MCr 727 buys you more quality than the competition can stand. They
   know that too. Buy first. Buy now. Buy Anderson, from Imperial
   Shipyards.
   
   There\'s only one feature of the Anderson we hope you won\'t use: the
   emergency low berths. Still, at least you won\'t be there for the rest
   of your life, like on most ships. But then, they don\'t carry a
   scoutship capable of two 3-parsec jumps. Just high insurance premiums.

    Design notes:
    
   I had to extrapolate a bit to get the 400 ton hangar, so maybe I
   should add MCr 0.3 to the final (discounted) price for that. The use
   of collapsible tanks in the hangar is a bit arguable, too, though at
   least 200 tons should certainly be possible. Other than that,
   everything is standard QSDS.
   
   I\'ve gone for a real mix of features, on the basis that the ship will
   be an explorer rather than a trader. The emphasis is therefore on
   sample goods and knowledge, coupled with sustainability, rather than
   traditional trade performance. This explains the MCr 7.3 per cargo ton
   cost (although that doesn\'t allow for cargo aboard the small craft).
   The lab is symptomatic of this approach.
   
   The scoutship is key to this design, so I give details below. It\'s not
   a Navy Courier (which exists as an SSDS design with EMM and better
   sensors, etc.) but has identical performance. The ability to send data
   back to a parent company is invaluable to exploratory trade.
   
   I can\'t wait to tell a group of PCs "OK, you\'re crew of the
   exploratory trader _Harrison_, which has just misjumped badly. There\'s
   a single scoutship in which to get help, and you\'ve been selected to
   fly it. Good luck."

   The Elizabeth Class Frontier Trader is named after an ancient Solomani
   queen which ruled during a time when wooden ships plyed the seas in
   search of gold and trade. During that time rival kingdoms and pirates
   would prey upon these ships for their goods. The Queen was wise to
   protect her capital with well defended merchants. We in our new
   Imperuim see ourselves in a similar situation. A new, rich empire, in
   which envious pocket empires and pirates would prey upon our ships on
   the rim, especialy those going to Vland and the unsettled teritories.
   The Elizabeth takes the best military protection available, while
   still appearing to be a trading vessel.
   
   The Elisabeth is well defended, most of its armamaents are of a
   defensive, rather than offensive nature. The single military heave
   lasers insure that most missiles would be destroyed at a safe range.
   It has 4 Sandacsters to protect it from laser fire, and 4 Nuclear
   dampers should the enemy be dispicable enough to use nuclear arms. Its
   main gun is a 50Td TL-12 Laser Bay. This weapon will make the
   Elizabeth able to hold her own against capital ships roughly her size.
   As it is known that some uncontacted worlds may use relic RoM Meson
   Weapons, a Meson screen was also installed.
   
   There are 2 Ships Boats and 2 Air rafts on board as support and
   auxilary craft. Engineering and vehicle shops are instaled to provide
   self sufficency of the ship, as it may not be at a class a port for
   months at a time. Likewise, for the sake of the crew, comfort has been
   provided by a lounge and an exercise and recreation room. Medical
   facilitaies are also present should a crewmember become wounded or
   contract an ailment. If the crewmember becomes mortaly wounded or
   sick, emergency low berths are available to store the fallen comrade
   untill such time that he/she could be recessutated back home in Core.
   
   The Crew compliement mainly consists of security and gunnery, with
   engineering and command crew second, then the technical crew and
   finaly the service crew. This ship puts saftey and protection on the
   highest order, next to trade of course. It is one thing to get the
   goods from the world, its another to protect that precious cargo, and
   in the Frontier, there is no navy to protect you, one must be ready
   for any posible contingency. We believe that the Elizabeth is one of
   the best fusions of Merchant and Military technology and experience.

    ********Press Release********Press Release*********
    
   Sefreth Shipyards Ltd. of Sylea is proud to announce the release of
   its latest ship design. In response to the Imperial THUDD ship design
   competition we now unveil the Knarr class Exploratory Trader. This
   ship follows in the tradition of cutting edge design, excellence in
   production, and premium service that you have come to expect from
   Sefreth Shipyards over the last 70 years. In the Knarr we have created
   the penultimate blend of high yield merchant ship, sturdy secure
   trader, and intrepid explorer scout. With just one of these ships you
   will have the tools to speculate in the vast trade opportunities
   beyond the imperial frontier. With a fleet of these you could corner
   vast foreign markets long before your competition knew what they were
   looking for. The Knarr is thedefinitive ship for finding and tapping
   the vast reaches of space beyond our borders. The first thing that
   separates the Knarr from the competition is its cargo space. What
   other premium Exploratory Trader can claim to have one third of its
   volume devoted to cargo. The Knarr has 1000 dT of cargo space. That\'s
   less than 1.5 MCr. per ton! That figure alone shows the overall value
   of the Knarr. On top of all that cargo space are ten staterooms set
   aside for any passengers, and there is ample space on board to make
   room for more passengers. And the cream on top of all this
   profitability is the Knarr\'s ability to transport exotic or dangerous
   goods. Twenty low births make transport of live specimens or less
   wealthy travelers a profitable sideline, and the Siiradka Systems Inc.
   Nuclear Damper allows for the transport of even the most dangerous
   nuclear materials without a worry. Of course the Knarr is more than an
   oversized far trader. It\'s mission is to explore as well as to trade,
   and for that it is equally well endowed.
   
   The Knarr has a state-of-the-art HammLine Inc. jump-drive capable of 3
   parsec jumps, so it can reach the farthest reaches of space as fast as
   any ship in the Imperium. The Knarr\'s sensor suit is also designed
   with exploration in mind. A full Siiradka Systems Inc.
   Exploration/Survey sensor package allows the Knarr to explore and
   survey space just as well, if not better, than the top-of-the-line
   Imperial Scouts. The Knarr also contains a 50 ton internal hangar with
   enough room to make repairs or modifications simple. Perfect for
   carrying any auxiliary craft needed to complete a mission. Finally, we
   at Sefreth Shipyards know that long duration missions can be tough on
   even the finest crew, so the Knarr has been designed with crew
   comforts in mind. The Knarr is designed to have two officers to each
   large stateroom, and two crew to each small stateroom, and the Captain
   in his own cabin. Factor out the ten passenger staterooms, and there
   is still ample living space to support up to forty more personnel, be
   they scientists on board for a specific mission, or marines for those
   high risk missions. At first glance, two to a small state room may
   seem a bit cramped, but the Knarr has something special, something
   that will make serving aboard it a joy for officer and crew alike,
   532m^3 devoted solely to the comfort and entertainment of those
   aboard. Both the 84m^3 officers club and the huge 448m^3 crew commons
   are state of the art entertainment centers. They are filled with the
   best technology money can buy. Everything from kitchens, so the crew
   can enjoy some real home cookin\', to interactive games such as a
   virtual Grav-Ball simulator and a simulated target range, fitness
   equipment, a multitude of smaller entertainment items and a miniature
   theater able to seat forty people at a time. To top everything off,
   each recreation center has its own steward who is able to dedicate all
   his time to the entertainment and comfort of those he serves with.
   Truly a paradise in space. It must be realized that space is
   dangerous, especially when one is exploring places he knows nothing
   about. That is why the Knarr is built tough.
   
   What we at Sefreth Shipyards have achieved with the Knarr is the
   construction of a comprehensive, state-of-the-art defensive system
   that takes nothing away from the Knarr\'s primary mission as a merchant
   and explorer. Between the three batteries of four mil-spec
   sandcasters, the twin 95Mj laser batteries, the high quality nuclear
   damper, and finally the meson screen, nothing will be able to get
   through to the Knarr. Furthermore, all of the Knarr\'s defensive
   systems are built by Sirradka Systems, so you know that your getting
   quality. And if, by some fluke, something does get through, the Knarr
   can take it. With armor equal to the Imperial navy\'s Large Armed
   Freighter the Knarr can take quite a licking before you need to worry.
   And finally, if all hell breaks loose, and the Knarr suffers serious
   damage, you need not fear. The Knarr is built with redundancy in mind.
   Two separate 1G Thrust Plate systems instead of one 2G, four 500MW and
   one 250 MW Fusion plants, backup life support and sensor systems
   reassure you that you\'ll never be up a creek without a paddle. This is
   the Knarr class Exploratory Trader. It is simply the best Exploratory
   Trader on the market today, bar none. We at Sefreth Shipyards are
   proud to present this ship to you, and we hope that you will be proud
   to add it to your fleet of ships. So, on behalf of all of us at
   Sefreth Shipyards, I would like to thank you for your time.
   
     Sincerely
     Ronin Sefreth Jr.
     CEO Sefreth Shipyards Ltd.

    NOTE:
    
   I don\'t know how legal the "100 ton" shuttle bay is, and I haven\'t
   been able to work in the extra cost of the collapsible tankage (it\'s
   only about 1 MCr or so), but here is my design, sans shuttle. 
   
   Starwerx Orbital Foundry is proud to present its first entry in the
   latest ISBA competition, the Nuphraitelle. A based on a medium-heavy
   streamlined wedge hull, the Nuphraitelle is outfitted with a 2 parsec
   jump-drive and fuel for 4 parsec\'s travel--2 in standard tankage and 2
   in a pair of collapsible fuel bladders stowed in the middle cargo bay.
   
   (An interesting variant here would be a J-2x3 ship-add another pair of
   collapsible tanks, 300 dt fuel each, of course, in the cargo bay. It\'d
   reduce the available cargo space by 32 dt, and there would only be
   ~100 std of cargo when the ship was fully tanked, but you\'d get
   another 2 parsecs out of the ship without refueling.)
   
   The philosophy with the Nuphraitelle is Opportunity, Capability, and
   Survival.
   
   The Nuphraitelle\'s main sensor array, a Cassini Mk72 Survey package,
   is the standard among medium-sized Imperial Interstellar Scout Service
   vessels and gives the capability to survey uncharted or under-charted
   star systems. The onboard laboratory lets the crew support a
   geophysical, xenobiological or astrophysical specialist to provide
   detailed analysis of the sensor data.
   
   (I chose the Survey sensor package because it _wasn\'t_ military,
   something I wanted to avoid was the possibility of giving anyone who
   managed to capture this ship an Imperial Naval class jammer. The
   survey package has equal range, is nearly half the cost and price. The
   only losing points are the larger volume and power requirements. Also,
   if the mission requires more Scientists, they should get the High
   Passage cabins)
   
   Nearly half of the Nuphraitelle\'s volume is taken up by the three main
   cargo bays, each with a capacity of over 6000 cubic meters of storage,
   letting the Nuphraitelle haul impressive amounts of goods from the
   worlds it visits.
   
   Quarters for the crew, 10 middle passengers and 2 high passengers are
   standard, as are 10 low berths, suitable for passengers or livestock.
   The Captain, of course, receives his own large stateroom.
   
   The standard crew\'s complement, beyond the bridge crew and officers,
   includes 5 pilots/flight crew for the small craft, 2 ship\'s troops for
   defense and security, a Science Officer, and a Broker/trader
   specialist to aid the crew in matters of speculative trading. 2
   Medical specialists and 2 Stewards round out the complement.
   
   (If more troops are required, they get the Middle Passage cabins. The
   Broker is going to be the ship\'s \'Scout\' who will know all relevant
   information on culture and commerce at the places the ship will land.
   I suppose this could be done by the Captain and 1st Officer if the
   ship were smaller)
   
   Although the Nuphraitelle\'s thrusters are only capable of 1-gee
   acceleration, the structure of the ship has been designed to withstand
   twice that stress. 1-gee of contragravity and streamlining make
   atmospheric interface and flight safe on any world, terrestrial or
   gas-giant. The Nuphraitelle\'s redundant wilderness fueling capability
   can scoop and purify a jump\'s worth of fuel in less than 8 hours.
   
   (The combined 2-gee acceleration from the thrusters and contragrav
   should get this whale... er, a Newfy off most planets. The if one of
   the \'redundant\' fuel purifiers fails it takes 12.3 hours to process
   the scooped fuel.)
   
   Spacious hangers for two 50 ton shuttles have been provided, as well
   as more modest facilities for a 20 ton ship\'s boat. The adjoining
   shuttle bays, with minor modifications, are capable being connected
   and berthing a 100 ton J-2 scout. The extra mission flexibility
   provided to the ship\'s crew in transporting cargo, passengers or
   handling emergency situations should prove invaluable.
   
   (Right now I\'m working on the deckplans for the Nephraitelle and I am
   leaning towards an \'under-and-over\' 50 std bay arrangement. The
   deckplates between deck 3 and 4 would be removed and the bays
   connected that way. Comments anyone?)
   
   The Nuphraitelle is the first of Starwerx line of spacecraft and
   starships to feature "Mk3 systems automation," reducing the workload
   on the crew, but as with all Starwerx starships, redundant
   life-support and control systems are standard. A Starwerx Mk8
   \'Rambler\' class self defense package is included: 2 triple laser
   cannon, 2 sandcaster batteries, nuclear damper and meson screen.
   
   (I\'m going to run some scenarios; a Newfy vs. some small, laser-armed
   vessels (pirates? Fighters? Laser defensats?) and see how it performs.
   I\'m pretty sure the only thing that will save her is her sandcasters.
   I admit that the laser batts are a little weak, but this ship should
   be able to detect her foe and stay out of harms way before she should
   have to use them. (BTW, if her batteries are combined, they\'re a
   respectable (+4) 1/5-3-3-0 at a ROF of 100))
   
   As the Nuphraitelle\'s mission profile includes long duration missions
   away from Class A and B starports, a machine shop, engineering shop
   and sickbay are present (including an emergency low berth for
   critically injured crew or passengers) . If it should become necessary
   the shuttles and small craft should be capable of evacuating the
   entire ship\'s complement.
   
   (I hope this last point is never needed . It would be horrible to have
   to abandon ship over some lost world with a thousand tons of cargo
   that you couldn\'t take with you (evil grin).)
   
   As for the crewing, the jump drive, the thrusters/contragrav and the
   reactors take 5 engineers each (a senior/junior arrangement on each
   system with one chief pulling double duty?). The Survey sensor suite
   requires 3 electronics technicians. The ship\'s compliment has 8 in
   engineering/technical, 5 in gunnery/defense, 2 flight officers, and 3
   in command. Quarters for 5 small craft pilots and flight crew are
   included, but more may be needed depending on the types of
   shuttles/ship\'s boats you use.

   The Monte Cristo incorporates plenty of facilities for long range
   exploration into a jump 3 hull and still devote nearly a quarter of
   its hull to cargo. This vessel sports multiple repair shops including
   an engineering shop, a vehicle shop, and has a full sickbay to provide
   modern medical attention for a crew that could spend months away from
   home. A standard Survey sensor suite is included for a complete
   analysis of planetary resources. Wilderness refuelling in afforded
   with a streamlined hull and a fuel purification plant that can refuel
   and crack a full LHyd load in just over eleven hours.
   
   Should the Monte Cristo prove a tempting target, the ship is built on
   a strong non-standard 2000 ton hull with plenty of teeth to keep
   pirates at bay long enough to affect an escape to jump space. Heavily
   armored for a commercial ship the hull is braced for 6g, and weaponry
   is built around a defensive posture. Four over-powered light laser
   turrets are intended for missile defense. Six sandcaster turrets
   protect the ship from enemy lasers, and two nuc-dampers are included
   in case a particularly disreputable pirate carries a few extra
   surprises. Internal security is affected by two full fire teams
   equipped to top rated military standards.
   
   Crew Accommodations are perhaps the one weak feature of the craft\'s
   design. Unlike other entries the Monte Cristo does not spare hull
   volume for such extravagances as extra lounges or recreational
   facilities this is a working ship after all. However, no double
   berthing or hot-bunking is necessary. The command crew have individual
   large staterooms and the junior crew berth in small staterooms while
   the gunners and ship\'s troops make do with bunks.
   
   Six small craft support the ship\'s function. Two modular cutters are
   provided spacious hangers for ease of loading and repair. While extra
   modules are not included in the basic design the hangers are arranged
   directly over the cargo bays, and mountings are provided for
   enterprising captain to add a few extra modules at the expense of
   cargo space. In the case the crew has to abandon ship the Morell
   Corporation introduces the Mk 20 Escape pod snuggled into four custom
   docking rings.

    Quiptech Press Release
    
   Quiptech is pleased to announce its newest ship, the Ming-class
   Exploratory Trader. Designed to trade opportunities outside of the
   Imperium, the Ming is fully equipped with many modern features.
   
   Cargo is key to any trading opportunity, and here at Quiptech, we feel
   that we understand this. The Ming comes equipped with over 350
   standard displacement tons of cargo area within itself, as well as
   over 400 tons of cargo area in specially designed cargo modules. Each
   module comes equipped with its own Life Suport and AG/IC systems that
   can be turned on and off individually to preserve power. This also
   allows the Ming to carry a variety of different cargoes with the least
   amount of spoilage.
   
   Twin Grasshopper-class Modular Support vessels are included with the
   Ming to allow for faster loading and unloading of cargo. Each
   Grasshopper is capable of 5G\'s of thrust to quickly move cargo from
   the surface to the Ming. The AF hulls of the Grasshoppers also help
   speed up the process.
   
   What good is cargo if you can\'t protect it? That\'s why the Ming is
   equipped with a level 6 Meson screen as well as 8 Sandcasters for
   defense. In addition, the twin laser batteries and the missile
   launcher will give the attacking craft something to think about while
   the Ming makes its escape. (Imperial Permits may be required.)
   
   "How?" you ask. The Ming (and all 15 of the Cargo/Fuel Modules) come
   equipped with Collapsible Fuel Bladders. We reccommend that before the
   Ming jumps out of system, all of these Bladders that can be are filled
   with fuel. During the jump, this fuel can be purified and pumped into
   the Mings fuel tank, giving the Ming the ability to perform an
   emergency Jump at any time after entering a system.
   
   Of course, your cargo isn\'t valuable unless you can get it back to
   port, so, the Ming is equipped with both an Engineering and Vehicle
   Shop and is more than able to repair most parts while in the field.
   But being able to fix your ship is not going to help if there is no
   one to fly it. When you visit new worlds, there is always the chance
   that a new virus or microbody will be encountered, so the Ming is also
   equipped with a 2-bed sick bay and laboratory to give the Medical
   staff an extra edge in finding the cure. But if, Ancients forbid, you
   are unable to find the cure, the Ming is also equipped with more than
   enough low berths to preserve the injured or sick crewmember until the
   cure can be found.
   
   When you are away from home on Exploratory Trading missions, crew
   morale can play a large part in whether you make a profit or not. It
   is for this reason that the Ming provides a small stateroom for each
   crewmember and a large stateroom for the command and medical crew. In
   addition, there is a specially designed Galley/Mess area allowing the
   stewards more room to provide for more tasteful and healthier meals.
   The crew can be treated to a tri-d from a vast tri-d library, or can
   read a book from the library included in the Entertainment Room.
   Finally, crew comfort and health will be enhanced in the Fitness Room.
   A collection of various exercise machinery and work-out areas provide
   the crew with yet another method for passing the long hours of space
   travel.
   
   Finally, the Ming comes equipped with a Quiptech Q010 Luxury Landing
   Craft. During the negotiations and establishment of trade treaties, it
   is often necessary for the mission leaders to conduct meeting of
   good-will on the planet\'s surface. The Q010 allows this to be done and
   at the same time leave a good impression on the natives. There are
   times, however, when a stronger show is necessary, and at these times,
   the Ming itself can descend to the surface of the world to leave a
   lasting impression with the locals.
   
   No matter what conditions you expect, the Ming gives you the ability
   to confront it with confidence. In addition, the Ming provides a large
   cargo area to increase profits and maintain that competitive edge.
   
    Design notes:
    
   The Ming was designed to work with the Grasshopper and the Cargo/Fuel
   Modules. The total displacement tonnage for all carried craft and the
   Ming itself is 2500-tons. The Jump Drive and Thruster Plates are
   designed with this size in mind.

    Notes:
    
   The Modular Support Craft is equipped with three airlocks one for
   normal entry, plus one per module. The Craft uses the Standard
   Civilian Electronics Package. The area of the Docking Rings does not
   include Life Support or Artificial Gravity/Inertial Compensation. It
   is assumed to be included in the module itself. The Craft carries
   enough fuelto be used for half a year. The inclusion of an Emergency
   Low Berth allows the Craft to be used as a lifeboat if necessary.
   Price listed includes two Cargo/Fuel Modules. Power Surplus: 5.571 Mw
   
    Design notes:
    
   Because I based this design on working with the Cargo/Fuel Module, I
   opted not to extedn the LS and AG/IC throughout the hull. I had some
   difficulty within myself using three airlocks rather than a full
   year\'s worth of fuel, but I felt the need for the airlocks was
   justified. I also don\'t like the lack of cargo space, but I felt the
   potential of 5G\'s thrust was too much to be passed up. Of course, the
   pilot and sensor guy had better be strapped into the seats when they
   kick in the thrust. :)

    Notes:
    
   The 30-ton Cargo/Fuel Module is equipped with a 28.5-ton collapsible
   fuel bladder to allow the module to be used for fuel storage as well
   as standard cargo. The Standard Life Support and Artificail
   Gravity/Inertial Compensation Systems allow for storage of any type of
   cargo, from refrigerated to live, but does require a 2.084Mw power
   source. (Approximate Dimensions: 11.5m x 5.2m x 7.0m) Fuel Bladder
   (19.95m^3 Storage Space)
   
    Design Notes:
    
   All of the items on the Cargo/Fuel Module are SSDS items with the
   exception of the Collapsible Fuel Tank which is QSDS. The grapples
   needed to use this module on an existing hull require 126m^3 volume
   and 132.25m^2 surface area. They cost 0.26MCr and mass 132.25 tonnes.

  Cristobal Colon Class Exploratory Cruiser, Mercantile
  
   Designer: Steven T. Charlton scharlto@ifsna.com
   Firm: Aurelian Industries
   System: QSDS plus Huge Table of Hulls
   
   Aurelia Downport, Sylea (Sylean News Service) - Aurelian Industries, a
   privately-held shipbuilding concern headquartered in the Wardn barony
   of Sylea, today unveiled its entry into the current THUDDD competition
   for a new type-standardized Exploratory Merchant Ship class. The
   Cristobal Colon class Exploratory Cruiser, Mercantile (ECM) continues
   the Aurelian Industries tradition of innovative solutions for complex
   starship problems.
   
   At first glance, the Cristobal appears to be little more than a
   reworked version of the famous Aurelian Industries Marco Polo class
   long-range scout ship. While the two ships share many features and
   components, the two classes are quite different. The Cristobal carries
   enough room for corporate researchers or troubleshooters, as well as
   passengers, but still has room for nearly 200 tons of cargo. The
   potentially-threatening heavy wepaonry of the Marco Polo has been
   downgraded to a less-intimidating defensive suite, which still gives
   the Cristobal the firepower it needs to discourage trouble before it
   happens. The defenses of the Marco Polo are largely retained, and
   special dispensation has allowed Aurelian Industries to mount a Meson
   Screen on the Cristobal. While not proof against relic Meson attacks,
   the screen will allow the ship to quickly remove itself from danger,
   without adversely impacting the final cost of the vessel.
   
   The interior of the Cristobal is also a far cry from the Marco Polo.
   While Imperial Navy and Scout Service crews are used to tight
   quarters, Aurelian Industries realizes that the well-paid
   professionals of today\'s merchant marine need a certain level of
   comfort to be able to perform well and make their companies prosper.
   For this reason, each crewman is allocated his own stateroom.
   Additional entertainment facilities, in the form of two 10-ton
   lounges, have also been added to the ship to maintain morale during
   long voyages of market discovery.
   
   The realities of these long journeys require that the Cristobal be as
   self-supporting as possible. For that reason, the vessel is equipped
   with many additional facilities. A machine shop, equipped with the
   finest high-tech Imperial tools, can fabricate nearly any part the
   vessel may need, allowing the ship to perform major repairs (short of
   an overhaul) without the services of a starport. The human element
   also needs to be maintained, which is why the Cristobal is equipped
   with two fully-functional sickbays. There are also 20 low berths on
   board, which can be used to carry replacement crew or passengers, or
   reserved for wounded crew whose injuries cannot be tended to with the
   ship\'s facilities (an unlikely possibility).
   
   There is also provision for up to 20 Mission Specialists to be carried
   on the Cristobal; expert economic analysts and trade negotiators who
   can make the difference between a successful expedition or a failed
   one. When making followup visits to an already-explored region, these
   rooms can be used to carry 20 high passengers instead, or even 40
   medium passengers. Similarly, accomodations are provided for 12
   security specialists to guard against treachery by newly-contacted
   customers, and to provide internal order during a long voyage. Again,
   when making followup visits to an already-explored region, these rooms
   can be used to carry 12 high passengers instead, or even 24 medium
   passengers.
   
   Like the Marco Polo, the Cristobal has two separate hangars for 30-ton
   Ship\'s Boats. These craft can be used for landings, system exploration
   or even (given enough time) wilderness refueling of the mother ship.
   The Ship\'s Boats are not provided, but can be easily obtained from
   many fine small-craft manufacturers. Any vessel of 30 tons or less can
   be used, or any combination totalling 30 tons, for each of the two
   hangars. In addition, with the Ship\'s Boat away on a mission either of
   the hangars can be used as impromptu meeting areas for large meetings
   or other ceremonies, or even for a pickup game of Grav Ball.
   
   While the Marco Polo carries external grapples for six 100-ton Scout
   Ships, the Cristobal carries three 200-ton grapples. These grapples
   can be used for any vessel of 200 tons or less, and the ship\'s drives
   and fuel loads are optimized to handle the ship\'s mass (2000 tons)
   plus the mass of up to 600 tons of carried vessels. Aurelian
   Industries also provides two complementary auxillary craft to fill
   these 200-ton holes; the Amerigo Vespucci class Auxilliary Far Trader,
   and the Santo Domingo class Auxilliary Cargo Carrier.
   
   Based on the same 200-ton streamlined box hull, the Amerigo and the
   Santo both extend the cargo capacity of the Cristobal, and allow the
   exploration team leader a wider range of exploration options. With the
   jump-2 Amerigo, the team leader can widen his exploration area
   quickly, covering an entire cluster of worlds in one third the time a
   normal exploratory cruiser would require. With the Santo, the team
   leader is able to pick up and deliver more cargo to a world\'s surface,
   or even refuel his mother ship more quickly. The auxilliary vessels
   are optional, but provide a set of much more flexible and powerful
   exploratory options. The auxilliaries can also be easily upgraded with
   military-quality sensors and even weapons systems, for those regions
   of space where pirates and other dangers make firepower an important
   trading tool.

Agreed - I would not mind looking over such a thing, as I want to feed some
input data to my sector map generator to get some good profiles of its
execution.

To be quite fair, Joe, IIRC, he posted only the Vland sector, one which I
am not familiar with, and do not game in.  Had he posted Core or Massilia,
I would have been more likely to actually look at the data, because I had
both the start and end data for it.  (Massilia was used in the Knightfall
adventure, which is why I know it well.)

I also seem to recall that the one sector I saw was a blank sector, but
that could well have been an artifact of when I joined the list.

Besides - the blank issue was hardly minuscule.  It affected the total
layout of the product in a negative way.  I would have laid it out as a
series of subsector maps, sans blank worlds, with one per page, and thus
using 72 pages, leaving 24 for commentary, blank maps, sector maps, or
whatever.  I do not know that this would be better, but it would have been
my preferred layout.  The blank world decision affected that, as it meant
that the data was duplicated in FS.

> And a telling point for those who say TML is ideal for playtesting.

It is better when we think that our ideas have some chance of being heard.
Without being nasty, I have the impression that it is only nearly final
works that make it here, which means that the only possible changes are
minor, not major.  Clearly, you do not want to let information out too
early, as then you are committed to it, but it does kind of make the
play6testing thing a bit troublesome.  Look at the task system debate -
without getting into merits, Marc was not likely to change the system he
posted unless someone found a crippling error, and opinions vary as to what
a crippling error was.

I have contacted IG more than once about official playtesting, and have
been told each time that they have a quite competent group of playetsters,
and that there is no reason that they can see to put another person in the
loop.  I would have thought that FS, the TL15 equipment in EA, and so on
would point out a need for formal defect correction, but they do not see
these as a problem of process, only of detail.  (I do this for a living in
software, and we debug our documentation as much as we debug our code.)

Let me be formal about it - if IG wanted to started a rotating playtest
list, in which each participant got several draft copies of a given text
(not to be released to others), and which you were required to submit
defect reports on within a reasonable period, such as a week, then I would
feel they were going to take the comments seriously.  Look at the
PowerPlant Dream Team, which ended up doing a bang up job on a manual for
Metrowerks.  500 pages of text, proofread and corrected with glorious
abandon.  I can allocate more time if I _know_ that the authors will read
my comments.

Note: I did not say "accept", only "read".  It is the decision of the
author and editor what they want to say, but some kind of review might help
them say it.  The TML is a large pool of competent people.  If some of them
were recruited for occasional playtesting _with explicit responsibilities
and schedules_, and with multiple drafts, they might help IG out greatly.

A fusion of FUDGE, Traveller, and CORPS; a fusion..., a fusion...
Hey, how about calling it FUZION?

Sorry, couldn\'t resist ;-)

I\'d be interested in what you come up with, though.

You know, Traveller doesn\'t seem to address this possibility very much.
If it did, you wouldn\'t need HPG\'s.  If you could get the current density 
of quality room temperature superconductors up to the low end range of 
very low temp superconductors, say 10 million amps per cm^2, you could 
then have a very good battery for almost anything.  (if I\'ve done my math
correctly) then a storage ring the size of my wedding band would hold
something in the range of 9 mega joules!  These would make things like 
handheld gauss guns and even plasma pistols possible.  You could run your
laptop equivalent computer for a couple of years.  Energy grenades! 
Think about it, you\'d be able to shrink the size of an atomic detonator to
hand grenade size or smaller (hmm, how far can you throw an atomic hand
grenade?...).

Larger rings could be used as the power source for Thrust Plate driven
missiles, just run the plates in overload mode.  Heck they only have to 
last a few minutes or so...

In the first IG-produced issue of the _Journal of the Traveller\'s Aid
Society_ (JTAS), an adventure appeared which featured naval officials at a
remote outpost communicating with HQ in another star system in real time. 
This violates one of the single most important facets of Traveller canon -
that FTL communication speed is limited to the speed of the vessel
carrying the message, and thus suffers a minimum delay of about two weeks
for a question and reply cycle. 

What most bothered me about this was not the mistake per se -- it was
fairly insignificant to the adventure, and could easily be reworked -- but
rather the clear indication that both the author and editor had no grasp
of Traveller canon.  But that leads us directly into IG-bashing territory,

C\'mon, Suz,  how can you say that after the comments that Twolf has

the poster you\'ve quoted above.

I do respect most of what you say, Suz, but in this instance, you

Look at this like an advantage.  We\'ve got 18 sectors to fix--that\'s 
a lot of space.  There should be vastly different ideas in the data 
to convey how different one section of space is from the other and 
how different one planet is from another.

I think we should be highly creative.

Why don\'t we decide who is going to work on the project first, then 
have all of the participants vote on it.  I\'d be completely happy 
with that.

> Don\'t get me wrong... I would **really** like to see this done.

Me too, and I\'m willing to devote some of my scarce time to it.   
But, I\'ve got to admit, I\'m not sure I want to put that much work 
into something if IG is not going to use it.

I\'m not even playing in that sector of space, so it would not benefit 
me directly.  I am just doing it to make the game better and, 
hopefully, see FS be a product worth buying.  It will be a sacrifice 
for me to put all of the time in that this project will take--like 
everyone else on the list, I\'ve got a career to manage as well.

But, if IG is game, I\'ll make the time.

> In addition, would it include maps? Proper **maps**?

I don\'t see why not.  There is a lot of talent on this list.  We 
could contact IG and ask them what format they want the maps in.

choices.  You can continue to oppose your ideas to theirs, in a childish
battle of "no, you are", or you can listen to what they had to say,
evaluate it for content and move on.


For the record, the tone of this list is, in my opinion, as childish as
every other mailing list I\'ve seen, but no more so.  It is an inevitable
result of any large, unmoderated forum that those with the least concern
for a common discourse and the most concern for playground supremacy will
dominate the forum.  


At the same time, I do get some value from the list.  I learn which

In my spare time I do a small amount of role-playing, due to a lack

Visual Basic.  A lot of my time is also spent keeping up with current

I started playing D&D back in 1978 and Traveller in 1982.  One of my

Suz,

I am really sorry to hear your decision on this.  Unlike some other 
people, I was always eager to read your posts as well--and I still 
am.  I do hope you come back.  You are an asset to this list.

And, I\'m saying this with all sincerety.

I know that a lot of this "bash IG" stuff is credited to me (and 
rightly so), but I think that it is clear that it is not just one 
person who has been feeling this way.  My thoughts have been echoed 
by several people.

I too am getting tired of the negativity on this list, but what you 
are seeing is the result of Traveller lovers getting fed up 
with being disappointed in the new products.

I am not a negative person.  Actually, I\'m pretty easy going, but I 
usually call it straight.  When I see something I don\'t like, I\'ll 
spout off, but when I see something I do like, I am just as 
passionate about praising that as I am about knocking bad ideas.

Let me give you some examples.  Remember Glenn Hoppe\'s jumpspace 
explanation?  Good stuff--I had a religious experience.  Remember 
Glenn Grant\'s hit location chart?  Another good TML product.

And as for IG, remember my review on the CSC?  Or, how about my 
comments on M0?  Or even my never ending support of the EA?

These are all areas in which IG has either done well or excelled.  

Now, let\'s talk about giving IG another, and another chance.  
Starships hit and the whole list exploded.  What a piece of crap!  
But, do you remember who was the first person to say that, "This is 
enough!  It is IG\'s second product.  Let\'s curb our negativity and 
write it more critically--don\'t just say that you don\'t like 
something, say how it could be done better so that IG can learn what 
we want."  That was me.

Do you remember Jeff Zeitlin\'s response to this?  He made a policy 
that Freelance Traveller would not post negative things about IG in 
an effort to support the game.

And now, this FS thing has hit.  Sure, I blew a fuse.  I\'m tired of 
the up and down quality I\'ve been seeing from IG.  I want it to stop.

I want that feeling I used to get when I would rush down to the game 
store when a new DGP item was in.  I was never unhappy with the 
quality of material put out by those people.  I\'d buy it, rush out to 
the car to unwrap it, and look at it for about an hour before I left 
the parking lot.

I never felt cheated because of the price or the quality/quantity of 
material therein.  It wasn\'t long before I would buy anything with 
DGP\'s name on it.  Never once was I disappointed, whether it be game 
supplements, adventures, GM screens, or even magazines.

All were of superb quality.

Now, maybe I\'m spoiled, but from these past experiences, I know that 
it can be done.  If IG could start turning out that kind of quality 
and consistency, we\'d have us the best Traveller edition ever.

That\'s what I want.  It is important to me to get that.  After the 
fourth or fifth time you\'ve been disappointed in a company--when it 
means this much to you, you start to bitch.  It has been no secret 
that I want IG to know what I demand out of them.

Yes.  Now the FS thing has hit, and I\'ve done my bitching about it.  
I feel that these types of decisions are becomming intollerable.

But, what have I done?  Like after Starships, I\'ve started threads 
designed to be more constructive about IG and T4.

I didn\'t start the FS fix thread, but I am behind it 100%.  I think 
we should team up, fix the FS data, and give it to IG to publish in 
the FS/M0 hardcover--making everyone happy.

My point in all this is--yes, I can be extremely negative about 
something if I am pushed far enough.  After 7 books and a few other 
products, I feel that IG\'s trend has pushed me that far.

But, don\'t loose sight of the fact that I can be extremely positive 
as well.  I really do want to see Traveller succeed.

I want to feel about IG the way I feel about DGP.  It is up to IG to 
make that happen--for all of us.

Sincerely, Suz, 

Kenneth.

Well, that was a special case, since the French mercenary involved (who
was the model for the leader in _The Dogs of War_, by Frederick Forsyth,
and was mentioned in _Roland the Thompson Gunner_ by Warren Zevon) had
been the Police Chief for the islands for some time (5 or 10 years IIRC),
having helped the then current ruler gain power. I believe his name was
Robert Denard or something? He was famous mercenary in Africa, he was
involved in a number of wars there from the 60\'s on.

    'body' => 'FUDGEing TRAVELLER: RANGE SYSTEM
================================

PREAMBLE

    Those who missed my first post on my FUDGE conversion of Traveller
are invited to <www.geocities.com/Area51/8275/fudge.html> for a slightly
revised summary of FUDGEing Traveller.

THE RANGE SYSTEM

    As with Attributes and Skills, Ranges in Traveller can be expressed
using the FUDGE Scale. In the FUDGE system I am developing, Range bands
are consistant, from microscopic scale up to galactic scale. The scale
is logarithmic, with the difference in magnitude between *two* Range
bands being 10x. For example, range 9 is 100x more distant than range 5.

    Therefore, the formula for computing the range band, when given a
distance in meters, is:

    Range = 2 * log10(distance in meters)   round down

For most purposes, including melee combat, distances of less than 1
meter are treated as range band "-1". 

SCALE

    The base FUDGE scale is measured from -3 to +3, the centre point at
0 being called "FAIR". -3 is "TERRIBLE" and +3 is "SUPERB". The Base
Range Band system rates 1-3 meters as being "FAIR", closer distances are
in the negative and farther distances are in the positive.

    In Traveller, it is convienient to rate distances, and the
capabilities of equipment dependent on distance, such as weapons,
sensors, and communicators, in terms of a particular scale with its
midpoint being 0. To convert the scale to range bands, simply add the
scale number.

    For example, small arms are rated in the "Melee Scale" which is
Scale 3. In other words, "Fair Melee Distance" is range band 3 (0+3),
"Good Melee Distance" is band 4 (+1+3) and "Superb Melee Distance" is
band 6 (+3+3).

    The following scales are typically used in Traveller:
    
Bands  0-6    Melee Scale, measured in meters ("Scale 3")
       7-13   Planetary, measured in km ("Scale 10")
      14-20   Orbital, measured in light-seconds ("Scale 17")
      21-27   System, measured in AU ("Scale 24")
      28-34   Deep Space, measured in milliparsecs ("Scale 31")

    Melee weapons would be rated on the Melee scale; small vehicle
communicators and sensors on the Planetary scale; and Spacecraft comm,
sensors, and weapons on the Orbital scale.

    Remember that the above scales are used for ease of reference. Any
other convenient scale could be used to measure other relative
distances.

    For example: One might want to use an Earth based scale, based on
the diameter of the earth (Band 8). In this scale, Scale 8, the 10
diameter limit is "Excellent" distance (+2) + Band 8, and the 100
diameter limit is "Superb+1" distance (4+8). Another more cumbersome way
of stating that is "Superb scale 1, Earth scale" (+3)+1+8. It is a
technically correct, if confusing, way of describing the distance.

THE DISTANCE TABLE

    The following table shows the range bands converted to convenient
units, for distance comparison. I also show the rough Traveller
equivalents for ease of conversion. Rough distances are shown and are
accurate to +/- 10%. For those who desire greater precision, the last
column shows 4 significant figures

    Those with a keen eye and a copy of BRTC\'s _Guns! Guns! Guns!_ will
note that the aiming Range Class of weapons in 3G3 easily fit into the
table. Simply add 1 to the Range Class to get the Max aimed FUDGE range
band of the weapon.

Suzette, and the others fleeing the TML, I *do* know how you feel.  There
is nothing more frustrating and painful than seeing a resource you love
being destroyed by pollution and careless misuse.  But to abandon the
things you love when they are abused is to suffer a double defeat.

Yes, there have been some truly reprehensible posts to the TML in recent
weeks, and especially the past several days.  There have also been some
really wonderful posts -- the "Valentine Rose" piece stands out in my mind
among the TML\'s all-time best items, the hard-SF thread is making me
reexamine some of my mental models of \'realism\', the THUDDD comments are
doing the same for my approach to ship design, and so on and on. 

My suggestion to those who would abandon the TML is that you learn to
treat malicious, ad hominem posts as you would a WINMAIL.DAT attachment --
mild annoyance, perhaps a note to the person responsible if you feel it
necessary, but mostly a few taps on the \'page down\' key to skip past it
and get to the *real* posts.

Most important, contribute your own positive material to the list.  I
can\'t think of a better way to deal with unwanted posts than to drown them
out in a flood of innovative, useful material.

Some of the most creative, cooperative, and interesting people I know are
my friends on the TML.  Are we really going to let a few rude
party-crashers chase us away from our shared joy?

   Your friend took a comment that was *clearly* intended as a *joke*

someone was a neo-Nazi on the way out the door.  If I am guilty of
anything, it\'s stepping in on behalf of someone before they had an

the meaning of \' :-) \' and your friend does not?

   In the real world, people cut you off in trafffic.  They shout
insults for what seems to them like the right reasons.  They object when
they think you cut in line.  They belch and don\'t excuse themselves. 
They tell you their views on a political issue even though you don\'t
want to hear them.  This list consists of a bunch of real people doing
real things.  Sorry if this place is a little too real.

The idea that grandfather "helped" some races to "develop" j-drives solves
(as you pointed out) the BIG problem of why everybody seems to invent
j-drives at exactly the same time (astronomically speaking) and that there
seem no evidence of large empires outside known space (radio astronomy
should have been able to detect them pretty far from the Imperium).

Most of all though it helps me with my campaign were grandfather planted
the major races as scapegoats for the baddies from the core when they
arrive. He gave those races the j-drives and then hid in his hole hoping
that the baddies would be satisfied with exterminating the six majors. Kind
of makes my players view of grandfather shift a bit (they now think of him
as a kind godlike being helping the little poor critters with this and
that).

Somebody asked how my players eventually would kill grandfather; They are
unbeknowst to themselves helping the single surviving child of grandfather
in his quest of finding him and enacting his revenge (the survivor was
released from the dungeons of Octagon tower a couple of real world(tm)
years ago).

It may have been a special case but it applies nonetheless. Having
the former government appeal for Imperial aid strikes me as a logical
option of that government.

Here\'s another idea: the player characters attempt to take over
control of a world. The local government finds out that extraterrest-
rials are trying this stunt. They figure that there\'s no way that
these "aliens" can be beaten. They also figure (incorrectly) that
there are plenty more of these "aliens" on the way.

The solution: use nuclear or biological weaponry in a doomsday solution.
A whole continent (hopefully the one containing the player characters)
could get wiped out.

If we, on 20th century Earth, were fighting a losing war with aliens,
that war would escalate until the nuclear option was the only one left.
Better to die fighting than submit whimpering, no?

   Yeah, pretty much.  My definition of "hard" SF is fiction that obeys
   the laws of physics, or is at least thoroughly aware of the
   consequences of breaking them.  No game played for recreation could
   reasonably expect to meet this definition though, so you could argue
   that this definition is not very useful.

   I think, though, that the definition is important to keep in mind for
   two reasons which crop up on this list from time to time:

   1)  People sometimes /learn/ physics by playing Traveller.  This is
   true in my case; Trav introduced me to the field that has become my
   profession way back in 8th grade.  In these cases, it\'s good to know
   where the science ends and the fantasy begins.

   2)  It puts design issues in perspective.  There is no reason to
   account for every kilowatt of power used in a starship when there are
   hundreds of gigawatts unaccounted for.  Realism is a forgone
   conclusion in any starship design system which calls itself
   Traveller, so the primary goals for any such system should be play
   balance and ease of use.

   Thanks for the definition of Isp; I\'ve been wondering what exactly
   you engineers have meant by it for a while now.  While we may never
   agree on definitions, at least now we can convert from one convention
   to the other:

   	S = Isp * (9.8 m/s^2)
   	Isp = S / (9.8 m/S^2)

   Hmm. This number seems a little high to me.  According to my
   textbook, the value is S = 3100 m/s, which converts to Isp = 310
   seconds.  Am I missing something here? Or do I need to get a more
   up-to-date textbook?  I\'m not quibbling with your calculations (heck,
   I got some of the power conversions in my last post wrong by a factor
   of 2 ---- not that that affected my point much!); I just want to make sure
   I understand the concept correctly.

Volker wrote a great letter to Courtney Solomon at Sweetpea about
proposed changes for FS.  I agree 100% with what Volker wrote, and I
think that this is something that needed to be done--especially in light
of the events occuring on the list in the last few days.

Here\'s a few more suggestions and comments about FS.

I suggest that the incomplete maps be removed from FS and replaced with
referee maps that contain complete information.

One blank sector grid should be included for refs who want to make a
player map with limited information.  This blank map can be photocopied,
and the ref can use it to detail as much or as little of the information
as he desires if he doesn\'t want to show the complete maps to his
players.

This way, a referee has information about the sector from one glance at
the map--instead of having to look up hex locations in the data list for
each world the ref needs info on.

Likewise, I think that some of the space in FS can be saved by not
printing the data lists twice.  As it stands now, FS has a player
section with blanks and a referee section with complete system data.

I suggest a fix similiar to the one I proposed about the maps.  One,
totally blank, list should be included for referees to photocopy and
fill out for player information.  The pages of the book can be greatly
reduced by eliminating all of those other, duplicate incomplete player
data listings.

I know that Marc intended this book to be used as a work book--where
players fill in the missing data as they discover it, but I think this
purpose would be better served using the fix I have detailed above.

One more thing--Volker listed several examples of the data in FS being
wrong.  Most noteably, this was the LL=GG flub.  Most of us here on the
TML would like to see that data fixed.  If you are interested, some of
us have banded together to help.  

What we propose is this--

1)  We will fix all of the data in FS, and make it backwardly compatible
with previous published data for these sectors.

2)  This service will be undertaken free of charge to you by the
Traveller fans on this list in an effort to see FS become a useable
Traveller resource.  When the project is completed, we will hand over
all rights to IG, and the data becomes the property of IG.

In return, we ask that you--

1)  Publish the corrected data in future printings of FS and/or the
M0/FS hardback.

2)  Produce errata sheets containing the corrected information, and make
this information available to any who ask at no, or a very low, cost. 
Having the errata sheets available to anyone who who sends IG an SASE is
what I have in mind, but if a dollar or two charge is necessary, then
this will be acceptible.

You may consider making the errata available on IG web site or
publishing this data in a series of issues in the JTAS in conjunction
with the SASE program.

3)  Advertise that the errata sheets are available through placing small
flyers in upcoming IG products for Traveller players who are not
subscribed to the TML.

4)  Include credit in the publications that this corrected data will be
used in.  Correcting the FS is a big job, and most of us will be doing
it by hand.  It will be nice for the Traveller fans who work on the
TML-FS Project to have their names in print on a product of their
favorite role playing game.

If you have any other requirements to add, please contact me to discuss
them.  You can reach me here, on the TML list, or at
dreamer@brokersys.com.

I await your answer.

Sincerely,

Kenneth D. Bearden

   Interestingly enough, it turns out that if you take the definition of
   thrust to be F = dE/dx, where E is the /kinetic/ energy, then F is
   independent of your reference frame for simple one-dimensional
   motion.  This is despite the fact that at relativistic speeds, your
   acceleration slows down.

   I\'m not entirely sure what you mean by "same relativistic speed".  If
   I have a rocket which spews reaction mass out the back at some
   constant kg/s (by the ship\'s clock) at some constant velocity
   (relative to the ship), then that rocket will have a constant thrust,
   F.  If the spew rate is adjusted as the ship\'s mass decreases, then I
   can get a constant acceleration, A, which will be "invariant" as seen
   by inertial observers who are not moving relativistically with
   respect to the rocket.  But for those guys back at the homeworld,
   where the rocket is moving away at a relativistic speed, the
   acceleration is not invariant; they see the rocket acclerate more
   slowly, at the rate A\' = A * (1 - (v/c)^2)^(3/2) = A * tau^3.  Again,
   this formula assumes simple 1D motion.

   A good point that, when ignored, leads to all sorts of paradoxes.
   Don\'t worry, I\'ve been careful.  8^)

    'body' => 'Thank you for the very nice comments, Ian.  The Cristobal (and its
progenitor, the Marco Polo Long-Range Scout Cruiser) are both reworks of an
old High Guard design I did for a PC who owned a mercant company is the
lower Spinward Marches.  He was based out of Mertactor (in District 268),
and had managed over 10 years to assemble a mercantile fleet of a dozen
ships.  He wanted to get a purpose-built ship to explore and exploit the
sectors spinward of the Spinward Marches and Trojan Reach, and was willing
to finance a billion credits to do it (thats one thousand million to you
Europeans!! ;-)).  The original design was TL15 and a bit roomier than the
QSDS version I posted, but worked well.  It just amused me because your
post described very clearly many of the things my PCs ended up doing with
their ship (named "Glory of Mertactor", because the owner PC was the son
and heir of the King of Mertactor).  In the end, the PCs built two more of
this class vessel, and sold the rights to the design to Oberlindes as well.
They used their ships to set up a network of trading posts (about 25 of
them) in two sectors, and managed to explore more than 200 worlds for
potential economic opportunities.  It was the memory of this campaign that
really got me thrilled at the idea of the Exploratory Merchant competition.

As it turns out, the two modules I included in my entry (the Vespucci and
the Santo Domingo) were only a few of the modules I had for this ship.  I
had five other vessels, which I did not include in my entry for the
purposes of brevity.  The files are (of course) on another computer just
now, but as I recall, the features were:

1.  Armed Far Trader - Basically a Vespucci with a 2-laser battery and a
missile barbette, plus a sandcaster.  Additional power is available for a
Nuke Damper, but one is not provided.  I think it shaved about 20 tons off
the Vespucci cargo capacity.
2.  Exploratory Starship - Similar to the Armed Far Trader, but only had
about 20 tons cargo.  The rest was taken up by laboratories and additional
crew berths for "recontact specialists."  This was part of the Marco Polo
(Long-Range Scout Cruiser) design, whih I postulated would be avaialable on
the civilian market as well.  Really just a half-size Lab Ship.
3.  Assault Lander Module - Similar to the Santo Domingo, but configured to
carry troops (a reinforced platoon, with APCs and heavy weapons).
Up-armored, with the same weapons as the Armed Far Trader, plus some Plasma
weapons and VRF gauss weapons from the Emperor\'s Arsenal (for close-in
support).
4.  Fixed Cargo/Fuel Module - Basically just a shell, capable of holding
about 190 tons of cargo or fuel.
5.  Prefabricated Base Module - Similar to the Exploratory Starship, but no
Jump or maneuver drives.  The module could be delivered to a planet by the
Cristobal, or detached in orbit as an orbital station.  The former drive
space was devoted to cargo, workshops and additional quarters (plus a
10-ton bar).

I\'ll post these actual designs later (when I grab the files).  I just
wanted to note that, apparently, many Traveller players think alike.  I
think Ian would have fit in well with my band of cut-throats, er, merchant
PCs.

Ian <ianw@zed.com.au> wrote:
But I really cant go past the Cristobal class. A combination of
two jump 2-capable carried craft and twenty trade specialists
decided the issue. Including carried craft, it has 530 tons of
cargo capability, which is acceptable compared to it\'s total
MCr1300 cost. The Amerigo Vespucci class vessels really need to
be armed, however, and fuel bladders for a jump-2 in their cargo
bays could be a good idea (allowing a rapid evacuation of a
hostile system). Personally, I would also replace the suggested
Santo Domingo with a third Amerigo Vespucci.

The advantage it will have is speed and flexibility. On contacting
a potential market, the mother ship can leave, with one of the sub-
craft remaining in system to keep an eye on things, and provide a
home base for up to 14 trade specialists.

As the shipyard\'s advertising makes clear, the sub-craft can help
cover three times the area that a single craft could.

If one wants to really optimize cargo capacity, and has contacted
a world with an industrial base, the locals could be contracted to
build a hull of the same size and shape as an Amerigo Vespucci
class. It doesnt need an engine or life support, and it doesnt
matter if it built of composite laminates, aluminium or even welded
steel - just so that it can be grappled to the mother ship with lots
of interior space for cargo. The Amerigo Vespucci then makes it\'s
own way home.

A related idea is to carry as cargo a prefabricated base. One of the
Amerigo Vespucci\'s is delegated the task of setting up the base on
some silent world in an abandoned system, thus providing a point at
which cargos can be stockpiled for later shipment back to the
Imperium. A pair of Heavily Armed Cutters could be carried as cargo
as a self-defense force for the base.

In short, buy the Recollet if you want to be a Merchant Prince, and
buy a Cristobal Colon if you already are.

GONG!  Thank you for playing.  The Constitution describes relations

Personally, I don\'t have a problem with D3, simple D6\'s can be used to 
generate D3 results by realizing 1,2=low (-1) 3,4=mid (0) 5,6=high (+1). 
With a little training, the results appear automatically. I actually find 
the -/0/+ results somehow elegantly pleasing. :-) 

For those who dislike them, remember that FUDGE has alternate dice 
rolling systems such as 3d6, 4d6 or percentile dice. Here\'s an excerpt:

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
3.22  Other Dice Techniques
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

For those who don\'t want to make or buy FUDGE dice, three different
options are available:

4d6: this method requires 2d6 of one color (or size) and 2d6 of
   another color or size.  First declare which two dice are the
   positive dice, and which two the negative, then roll all four dice.
   Do not add the dice in this system.  Instead, remove from the table
   all but the lowest die (or dice, if more than one has the same
   lowest number showing).  If the only dice left on the table are the
   same color, that is the result: a positive die with a "1" showing
   is a +1, for example.  If there are still dice of both colors
   showing, the result is "0".
   
   Examples (p = positive die, n = negative die): you roll p4, p3, n3,
   n3.  The lowest number is a 3, so the p4 is removed, leaving p3, n3
   and n3.  Since there are both positive and negative dice remaining,
   the result is 0.  On another roll, you get p1, p1, n2, n4.  Remove
   the highest numbers, n2 and n4.  This leaves only positive dice, so
   the result is +1, since a "1" is showing on a positive die, and
   there are no negative dice on the table.

3d6: Roll 3 six-sided dice.  Add the numbers and look up the results
   on the table below.  This table is small enough to fit easily on a
   character sheet.  Example: a roll of 3, 3, 6 is a sum of 12.
   Looking up 12 on the table yields a result of +1.

[TABLE]
Rolled: | 3-4 |  5 | 6-7 | 8-9 | 10-11 | 12-13 | 14-15 | 16 | 17-18
- ----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----
Result: | -4  | -3 | -2  | -1  |  +0   |  +1   |  +2   | +3 |  +4
[END TABLE]

d%: roll two ten-sided dice, having first declared which will be the
   "tens" digit.  Read the tens die and the ones die as a number from
   1 to 100 (01 = 1, but 00 = 100), and consult the table below, which
   should be printed on the character sheet:

[TABLE]
Rolled: |  1 | 2-6 | 7-18 | 19-38 | 39-62 | 63-82 | 83-94 | 95-99 | 00
- ----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----
Result: | -4 |  -3 |  -2  |   -1  |  +0   |  +1   |  +2   |   +3  | +4
[END TABLE]

Of course, the GM may customize this table as she wishes.  These
numbers were chosen to match 4dF, which the author feels is an ideal
spread for FUDGE.

- - - - - - - - - - -
3.23  Success Rates
- - - - - - - - - - -

The following table is provided so that players can better evaluate
their chances of success.

   +4 or better:           1%           2%         2%
   +3 or better:           6%           5%         7%
   +2 or better:          18%          16%        18%
   +1 or better:          38%          38%        39%
    0 or better:          62%          62%        61%
   -1 or better:          82%          84%        82%
   -2 or better:          94%          95%        93%
   -3 or better:          99%          98%        98%
   -4 or better:         100%         100%        99.8%
   -5 or better:           -            -        100%
[END TABLE]

Thus, if your trait is Fair, and the GM says you need a Good result or
better to succeed, you need to roll +1 or better.  You\'ll do this
about two times out of five, on the average.

You\'ll notice that using 3d6 or 4d6 the results, while slightly
different, are close enough for a game called FUDGE.  The 4d6 results
do allow +/-5, however, but this shouldn\'t be a problem since they
occur so rarely.  In fact, you could use 5dF to allow +/-5 if you
wanted . . .

The way I do it, the \'High Passages\' are actually redeemable 
non-transferable travel vouchers, valid for one month from date of 
issue. That is, if they are not *picked up and used* within one month 
of their nominal date of issue, they are just a worthless bunch of 
plastic. Not that it\'ll be \'printed\' until the character shows up 
personally to collect it, or if he shows up too late, for that matter.

Any registered ship owner in good standing with the TAS can cash 
in travel vouchers, that have been signed by the TAS member they were 
issued to, at 95% of nominal value at any port *other* than the port of 
issue. For the \'missing\' 5% they get the last week\'s full TAS News 
(with full trading data for all worlds on \'local\' trade routes 
(\'local\' meaning whatever the local TAS office wants it to), a free 
dinner, and a bit more good will with the TAS. (Obvious abuse, such as 
bringing in dozens of vouchers when one only has a small scout, will 
bring about a redlisting of the ship, which will be published with all 
the other data TAS publishes. In my game, apart from meaning that the 
ship won\'t be allowed to cash another voucher, ever, it would give a -2 
on *all* rolls in the trading system (cargo, trade and passengers, 
buying and selling, etc), for trades performed within the Imperium. A 
ship that constantly refuses to accept TAS vouchers will get 
amberlisted, giving a -1. (The reasoning behind the penalties is that 
redlisting is also done with pirate ships and the like, and 
amberlisting with ships of dubious legality.) Actual forgery of TAS 
vouchers (almost as difficult as forging Solars) will probably be 
punished by setting a *high* bounty on the miscreant\'s heads.)

In other words, most ship owners would rather take \'real\' High 
Passages, but they are certainly better than a Middle Passage, and it 
never hurts to have the TAS like you.

The above removes most of the more irritating forms of abuse, and 
encourages that they actually be used. It is, of course, not immune to 
all forms of abuse, especially as I deliberately left a few holes in 
the system.

As is probably obvious, in my game the TAS is rather powerful, with a 
lot of political, financial and social clout. This is due both to it\'s 
impressive \'old-boys\' network, and to the valuable services it 
performs.


Well, those are my views on the TAS. How do all the rest of you treat 
it?

   I had assumed that one of his allies would get him the message.  As

celebrate April Fool\'s Day, and have a lump of fool\'s gold, but I am no

   Please forward my remarks to him with my compliments.  My e-mail
address should he want to reply is hdhale@siscom.net, in case that info
gets garbled in the header to this message.  By the way, it is rather
difficult to say something to someone\'s face after they leave the room

   To make sure you\'ll get this, I\'ve taken the step of cc:ing your
e-mail address.

   Look, it is apparent that you and Suz hold some kind of admiration
for this guy, why I don\'t know.  While he might have satisfactorily
explained things to you as to why he had a "hissy" and left, the rest of
the list is either irritated at him, insulted, or just lamenting the
poor tone of the list.  Now that being the case, has it occured to you
yet that perhaps his actions were indefensible, and it would be best
just to admit that he was wrong and get on with life?

	HEAR, HEAR! I have been purposefully aoiding FS for the reason that it
is useless as written. And given the amount of history and experience

in light of the work you all did with QSDS, SSDS, etc.

	What, you mean actually take a look at the problem in a serious manner
before catapulting headlong into fixes we\'ll regret the moment we

The ISBA list has been discussing what equipment would be restricted, and I
believe the group opinion is that meson screens fall under the "license
required" group.  Note that the screen on the Terrapin isn\'t going to stop
a serious attack.  It\'s there to defend against the pocket loonies who have
gotten ahold of a small bay weapon.

Once again, a matter of scale.  I\'m designing the 90kton battleship that
keeps getting mentioned.  Her spinal mount would rip a ship like the
Terrapin to shreds, and never notice the weak screens.

When operating in Imperial space, the Navy probably requires the screen
generator to be phyically disconnected from its power supply.  Failure to
do this would be considered a major violation of shipping laws.

>Apart from that ... nice design work, fellas.

Thanks!  Hmmm. no commentary about the Terrapin, I don\'t know if that\'s
good or bad...

Gee it\'s nice to be discussing Traveller again!

"Solomani & Aslan", pg 5.  (On Venus) "Subsequent exploration revealed that
Venus was the site of an unfinished Ancient terraforming effort.
Apparently, the Final War interrupted the project, and without outside
control, the planet\'s unbalanced enviroment degraded to its present state."

ibid, pg 7.  "Today, Titan is best known as an Ancient site.  Although
archeolgists have announced no major finds, evidence found on Venus
suggests grand discoveries await."

It is also noted that both the Imperium and Solomani enforce a 1 AU
exclusion zone around Pluto.

You want fries with that crow?

True.  I really dislike people who have admitted that they don\'t even play
the game *telling* me how things are "supposed" to be.

Excellent letter!  This is what we need.  Positive, specific, polite
commentary that explains our positions clearly.

Let us know if you get a response.  In the mean time, I suggest that other
TMLers take the time to send a similar message to:

Be brief, and above all be polite.  If enough of us make our voices heard,

An even better example is the recently concluded Liberian civil war, in
which much of the Special Ops stuff was carried out by Executive Action, a
RSA-based mercenary group.

These guys did  everything from train cadre to assassainations, and were
paid in oil and mining stock.  EA is getting *very* rich off these types of
assignments.

Perhaps a group of Traveller Mercs could be offered shares in a lanthinum
of zuchhi crystal site, if they can clear out the Ine Givar base camp.. of
course, the mine could go bust (see recent events in Indonesia for more on
that adventure possibility)

 Is Cr4,000/mo really that good?  Have you made him sit down and

 Tariffs?  Taxes?  Import and Export license fees?
 Infrastructure on the destination world to support the _use_ of
 the high-tech equipment?  There\'s a distinct possibility that
 the trade rules are broken, but...

 How much did he pay for passage?  A Free Trader is a J1 ship;
 his destination is 20 jumps.  Assume that he bought mid
 passage; that is (or should have been) a total of Cr100,000
 just for the trip. That doesn\'t include excess baggage over the
 1td he\'s allowed in the price of passage.  How much extra space
 do you bill him for, at Cr1,000/td?

 Give \'em one or two situations every once in a while that will
 let them blow off some of that steam.  Judging from commentary
 on this list, there\'s enough balance in the combat rules that
 they have a good chance of being injured - the "holy shit, I\'m
 _not_ Rambo" school of enlightenment.  If the dice say that one
 of your Rambo wannabees bought the farm, pull out the book and
 the dice and say "it\'s time to roll up a new character"...  And
 impose the appropriate penalties, in time and stat reduction,
 for healing.  It\'s potentially a lot of paperwork for you, but
 I think that your Rambozos will decide that it _is_ getting
 old, fast.  If not, there\'s always the Ultimate Penalty: keep
 the PC\'s; re-roll the players, as it were.

 True.  Also, a blockade will only work if the world is not
 self-sufficient in everything it needs for survival.  A
 blockade of Earth or Sylea, for example, should not be expected
 to succeed, since it\'s reasonable to assume that they are
 self-sufficient in everything.  Sure, some people are going to
 be grumpy about not being able to get their once-a-year Nuteman
 dragon steaks (they treat themselves on their birthdays), but
 when you\'re being "oppressed", luxuries somehow seem to become
 truly dispensable.

 Actually, the Courier wasn\'t a bad choice for the UWP data -
 it\'s a fixed-pitch font, which makes handling tabular data
 (which a sector list inarguably is) a little easier, for the
 user.  I happen to think that Courier is particularly ugly, and
 most renderings don\'t put enough weight on the strokes, and
 that Letter Gothic would have been a better choice - but the
 fixed-pitch, which is what people are usually complaining about
 when they complain about "Courier", wasn\'t at all a bad
 decision.

 Bear in mind that this was before Marc took direct, personal
 creative control.  I read it as only explicating an unspoken
 assumption that existed previously, since, IIRC, the current
 rules governing F+ don\'t do any violence to extant CT material
 in the context that F+ is used.  But, the numbers were wrong,
 back in CT, so now they\'re explaining why they\'re right.  Now,
 if my memory is screwed up, then you can discard what I say
 here - I don\'t want to defend the indefensible.  But I don\'t
 usually make egregious errors like that.

 On the other hand, the more complex you make a system, the less
 playable it is - as you implicitly assume in your comment about
 TNE.  Disregarding the question of broken or not broken, you
 still have to have a balance of playability versus realism; if
 you design it with a bias toward realism and then cut, you\'ll
 be able to sell the basic product to people who like
 simplicity, and then add-on supplements for the people who like
 realism, and be able to satisfy both without making them
 outright incompatible with each other.

 Now, before you go off on me for the above, remember - I\'ve
 explicitly said to disregard the question of brokenness.  Take
 it in that light.

T::>I\'m afraid Traveller, as we know it, may be doomed. I only hope someone

 I disagree.  It was Classic Traveller that "made" Traveller;
 I\'ve seen nothing to challenge the assertion that it was the
 best-selling Traveller ever.  Throughout the TNE era, people
 were waxing nostalgic about CT/MT (which were really the same
 system), and they clamored for a return to the CT system and
 background.  T4 answers that clamor.  A properly done T4, with
 its other milieux, will give us much of what we asked, begged,
 and pleaded for, but never received, from GDW.  If future
 products conform generally to the standard of quality set by
 Emperor\'s Arsenal, (and if Marc and IG can get some publicity
 other than word-of-mouth,) I think T4 can, if not setting a
 standard, at least become a highly visible and competitive
 player in the RPG market.

the Traveller\'s Digest, and in it, I found a few paragraphs on low 
berth use in Milieu 0.

It is interesting that this article was published way back in 
October, 1990.

(Quote from Mike Mikesh and James Holden\'s article, Suspended 
Animation.)

More common in the Imperium, however, is the cold berth.  As brutal as
low tech cold berths might seem, freezing occupants with supercooled
fluids, they were standard in the Third Imperium until the 300s. 
Their low cost and simplicity made them easy to manufacture.

Such berths found much use in that era, for the Long Night had left
trillions in miserable conditions, and many of these were desperate
enough to risk their lives for a chance at escape.  Those unfortunates
were quickly recruited by corporations in need of manpower and shipped
off to out of the way destinations.

A common custom of the day was the low lottery.  Under the steward\'s
direction, the ship\'s captain contributed Cr10 out of each low
passage.  Each low passenger guessed the number of low travelers who
would survive the trip.  If the winner himself died, the captain got
the money.  This practice provided some chance for the typically
destitute low passengers to have some money upon their arrival.

Since those times, more advanced cold berths have come into use, and
new designs have been invented.  The emergency cold berth, double
standard size, accommodates four occupants of adult size.  At tech 15,
it can freeze the occupants--fully-clothed and unprepared--within
sixty seconds.  To do this, it forgoes all preliminary steps, trading
ease of entry for a lengthy and difficult revival.


(and I also found this quote about the frozen watch--which could be 
applicable to M0)

The Navy has adapted emergency low berth procedures for its frozen
watch program.  In the heat of battle, vital personnel can easily be
incapacitated.  To this end, the Navy places additional crew members
on its capital ships in suspended animation.  These crew replacements
are known as the frozen watch.

Frozen watch procedures reverse those for emergency berths.  Crewmen
are readied for freezing and installed with great care, a process
taking about three hours at tech level 15.  All potential problems are
identified and corrected in advance.  This allows the system to thaw
occupants without the careful monitoring and adjusting that would
otherwise go on.  Generally, frozen watch personnel are awake and
alert within five minutes after the cycle out procedure is started.



And, that\'s all the info.

<sigh> <rubbing face> <taking a deep breath>

I usually don\'t get into "discussions" like this, but I just can\'t
bear to watch it anymore. Let me tell you what I\'m seeing. Maybe
it\'ll help and maybe it won\'t.

As I recall, Paul Walker posted his "Confessions of a Traveller
Junkie" on the 16th. He told us, essentially, that he felt really
let down by IG, that their list of mistakes had grown to the point
that he felt that they weren\'t really trying anymore, that it was
just a means of making money to them, that the spirit of Traveller,
and likewise the pride they should have in their own work, just
wasn\'t there, or at the very least that it wasn\'t being exhibited.
In a fit of artistic license, he even compared the way he felt to
the way an abused wife might feel, bringing in the hot topic of
wife-rape, which later became a point of contention. His main
thrust, however, (no pun intended) was that he\'d be leaving the
hobby, not just because of the way he\'d felt he\'d been treated, but
because there were a lot more pressing matters in his life, and
something had to give. Traveller, in part due to the actions of IG,
became that something.

If I were Marc Miller, I think I would have felt obligated to
respond in some manner, even if it would just be to admit that
things had gotten a little out of hand, that IG hadn\'t been paying
enough attention to the details, and that mistakes were made that
could and should have been avoided.

How much effort does it take to apologize?

For some people, quite a lot, and I\'ve come the conclusion that
Marc just doesn\'t make apologetic speeches. Perhaps we\'re just a
bunch of peons as far as he\'s concerned. I don\'t know, but the
level of communication from IG to this list could be better. That
it hasn\'t been signifies something, and I\'m not too sure what.

In any case, I don\'t think I\'m the only person who feels this way,
because Jeff Zeitlin wrote a long post essentially concurring with
everything that Paul had written. Ken Bearden, likewise, felt put
off by IG, and he attacked with the vigor typical of somebody who
really cares about the game and wants to see it improve. I think he
often goes a little too far in this respect, but it\'s a question of
style, and I can certainly see his point of view.

Sometimes, to make a change, you have to scream and shout. I
remember when Ken Whitman came out with an internet policy for IG
that we weren\'t too happy about, and as soon as the screaming and
the shouting started they quickly changed the policy. I\'m a big
believer in screaming and shouting, but only if pressing the other
buttons fails to accomplish anything positive.

Had all the other buttons been pressed?

I think yes and no. I think a great many buttons had been pressed.
For example, somebody wrote that IG just wasn\'t getting the
message, and maybe we should forward them TML digests along with
content summaries.

Ken Bearden replied:
> I\'m not sure if that would work, Dave.  In fact, I\'m not even

I think Ken had made a solid effort to communicate with IG in a
friendly fashion. He wasn\'t just a screamer, yelling about how bad
everything was. He was actually trying to help by sending specific
suggestions in a private manner. And IG\'s response to his overtures
was somewhat less than acceptable, at least by my way of thinking.

At the same time, however, there was more that could have been
done. Marc Miller could have been individually contacted in this
regard. Courtney Solomon could have been as well (as Volker
Greimann seems to be doing). Individual members of IG\'s team could
have been solicited for information about what sort of wheels are
turning at IG, who\'s making the decisions, what is the process, and
how can the TML have an influence on this process as well as how
can we get explanations for the decisions that are made?

Operating in the dark is never a good thing, and I think that\'s the
way it felt for both Ken and for Paul. They didn\'t want press
announcements. They wanted some insight into what\'s really going on
down there. They wanted reassurance from a real live human being
that IG cared about quality and that appropriate steps were being
taken to correct past problems so that they wouldn\'t recur in the
future. But, of course, they never got this reassurance, and this
caused Paul to quit the game and caused Ken to get extremely upset,
so that he was soon posting multiple messages every night, getting
too emotionally involved in the whole thing.

In any case, somebody, I don\'t know who, must have figured that
enough was enough, because he said:

> Let\'s calm down a little on the IG front - the next thing we\'ll
> have is T4 book burnings...

To which Ken Bearden replied:

> I love it!  Burn, baby, burn! :)

Please notice the smiley. Either he\'s smiling because he really
likes the idea or he\'s smiling because he\'s making a joke and is
not really serious about wanting to burn books. I\'m not going to
speculate on which one is the case, but I think it\'s illustrative
how if you leave open the possibility for two different
interpretations, particularly on a mailing list that has well over
a hundred subscribers, that if there is even just a 1% chance of
somebody making the "wrong" interpretation, at least one person
will.

So along comes Twolf, who has had just about enough of the anti-IG
sentiment and of Ken\'s multiple posts per night:

> Well, that is the final straw. I had subscribed to TML (Traveller
> Mailing List) to share ideas about my hobby; not to the KBL
> (Kenneth Bitch List) which now advocates the burning of books.

He went on to compare Ken to a neo-nazi. Now even I have bad days,
but everyone on the Internet knows that once you mention the word
"nazi" in any discussion not involving Germany during the 1930s,
the discussion is essentially over. Just drop it, because there\'s
no use even continuing.

Well, of course it wasn\'t over. Allen was extremely annoyed at
Paul, because he felt that comparing what IG had done to a husband
raping his wife was way overboard, and that touched off a whole
other flamefest which I won\'t even get into.

So let me get to my conclusion...

IG has really made some mistakes. It\'s almost as though they don\'t
believe in proof-reading. Either they aren\'t interested in the work
they\'re doing or they\'re just on such a tight schedule that they
don\'t have time to step back and look at what they\'re putting out.
Either way, they\'ve made quite a few mistakes and they have to fix
them.

In the meantime, people on this list are getting angry about it,
and since IG isn\'t very responsive to the list anymore, people are
taking out their frustrations on each other. That, of course, leads
to flame wars, and as a result, some of the people who have been
the most active in our little nook of the online community are
getting ready to call it quits and say goodbye. I just don\'t see
that as a very pleasant option.

And I agree, at least with this portion of his statement. However,
I also recognize that Suz wasn\'t getting offended about the
discussion regarding IG. What was offending her was the personal
attacks.

Erwin Fritz <efritz@glja.com> goes on to write:

And this, I think, is the rub. Disagreeing with each other is fine,
but resorting to personal attacks isn\'t. Likewise, those who have
done the most bitching about Imperium Games need to step back for
a minute and ask whether or not they\'re flooding the list with
their opinions, and in so doing, getting on everyone\'s nerves.
Personally, I try to post with extreme infrequency, but when I
post, I like make it long and say what I want to say. I wish the
people who are bitching about IG would do likewise. You don\'t have
to post several times every night to make your point. You don\'t
have to post a follow-up to every other message. Just say what you
need to say, pack it with as much information as you\'ve got, take
time with it, proofread it, look for ways in which your statements
might be misinterpreted, show us that you care as much about the
presentation of your arguments as you wish IG would care about the
presentation of its product, and only then press the send key.

And as for Suz Dollar... and anyone else who\'s been thinking of
bailing whether out of annoyance toward IG or toward certain TML
members... I urge you not to lose hope just yet. IG is beginning to
improve, albeit we had to kick and shove them into the right
direction. Likewise, these flamefests come and go. In another month
we\'ll be back to arguing about fractional-c rocks. Won\'t that be
fun...

One last thing I\'ll bring up. Just prior to Paul Walker\'s
"Confessions", somebody (I think it was Twolf) said:

> HEY! Grow Up! You have the right to voice your opinion, but when
> IG doesn\'t take your opinion or position, then move on. If you
> don\'t like that they didn\'t drop the 3 sided dice, Fine! Won\'t

> of bandwidth.

As rudely as this is stated, he has a point. If IG isn\'t doing a
good job, and isn\'t making the effort to do a better job, then they
don\'t deserve our business. Paul illustrated this notion. He left.
If IG has been uncommunicative with the list, allowing these
flamewars to fester when they could have easily quashed the entire
thing with a well-worded explanation, perhaps even a (gasp)
apology, then we really need to reevaluate, like Paul did, how we
are spending our free time. Traveller came along at a great moment,
and it\'s pulled a lot of Science Fiction enthusiasts together, but
the RPG market is much bigger now, and there are a lot of other
games out there. Likewise, publishing your own on the Internet
isn\'t as hard as it might seem. It takes time, it takes dedication,
but ultimately, it\'s a lot more rewarding than simply trying to fix
somebody else\'s system. Maybe when IG realizes this, and sees
Traveller-enthusiasts dropping off like so many flies in a bug-
zapper, they\'ll get the message, put more work and more effort into
what they\'re doing, organize the TML into working groups for the
specific purpose of proofreading manuscripts prior to publication,
actively solicit for material, and responding in a timely manner
through their volunteer net-rep to all the gripes that their
customers have about their products and about their way of doing
business. Then, Traveller will be a much better game, but I don\'t
think it will happen until there is sufficient inducement for them
to make it happen, and in that sense, Paul, by leaving, has
actually done Traveller a service. And that, I think, is a very
pleasant irony.

PS: Paul, if you happen to read this, please consider coming back.
    You\'re one of the more level-headed people on this list, and
    I\'d really hate to see what becomes of the TML w/o you. Likewise
    for you too, Suz. You\'ve done too much good work to just chuck
    it all because of one lousy argument. And as for IG, get on this
    list and start talking to us, you cornholes :-)

hehehehe  Sorry to confuse you, I was just thinking out a loud.  I think
you missed what I said somewhat;

I assert he picked the 6 races near the Droyne homeworld (which is wrong
it seems from other evidence, but I wont worry about that)

You assert that their are many more races closer to the Droyne home world
then the 6 on the coyns.

I relent and agree with you, and then assert that he picked the 6 closest
Major race\'s (or the six who would most likely affect the droyne\'s
destiney ?).

I am not confused:)

No all are from the USA, I am from Australia, free speech is a privelage

Anyway as free speech pertains to this list, what you said means
jack.

The list runs on a *private* server, therefore when you post to the
server your using someone elses property with permission.  If that
permission is withdrawn by the owner then you have no recourse.  Free
speech is not pertinent unless the *owner* promotes it.  The owner can be

   Well the rest of us would love to hear what they were.  They have to

   Please forward my remarks to him with my compliments.  My e-mail

gets garbled in the header to this message.  By the way, it is rather
difficult to say something to someone\'s face after they leave the room

Well as you said you have header 

If you want to write to him to show your anger or disapointment you 
could have done it in private.  Instead it seems that you had 
something to prove by makeing that attack and it had nothing to do 
with traveller.  Just your Ego.

   You\'re right.  I know because you haven\'t turned your back on Twolf.

See that is what I am so angary at its the personal attack that you 
just seem not to want to quit.  If you did you and the others would 
have posted to me in person.  Instead your garabage is still going to 
the mailing list.

   I can recommend a remedial course if you\'re interested.

   To make sure you\'ll get this, I\'ve taken the step of cc:ing your
e-mail address.

Yea and to the TML I guess you just cant keep out of the public eye 
do you feel more like a man now.

   Look, it is apparent that you and Suz hold some kind of admiration
for this guy, why I don\'t know.  While he might have satisfactorily
explained things to you as to why he had a "hissy" and left, the rest of
the list is either irritated at him, insulted, or just lamenting the
poor tone of the list.  Now that being the case, has it occured to you
yet that perhaps his actions were indefensible, and it would be best
just to admit that he was wrong and get on with life?

Its called friendship.  At first I disagreed with him and decided to 
stay.  But you and even more so Ken  have made this very hard for me 
to stay.  Now realy go back and look at Ken\'s post from the day 
alone.  Notice how much he enjoys this.  Twolf left angrly and maybe 
wrongly but he left.  Ken and others including you and me  want to contuine 
to post the insults.  That is why I want all the stuff sent to me 
personaly not the TML.  It solves nothing and only angers us more.

I actually like the whole concept of it takes a freak of nature to create 
this sort of stuff. I also liked the hyperspace is an
artifact concept, but is there evidence that all the races
reverse-engineered the idea?  I don\'t think so.  Of course you can do what
you like, thats the beuty of RPG.

I did not tell you to shut up.  You asserted that all jump drives are the
indirect creation of Grandfather.  You spoke as if you had evidence for
this fact, I asked to see the evidence from the Alien modules.  Thats all.  

On the other hand if its something for you\'r RPG than you don\'t need me
telling you that you can do what you like.

Man, don\'t take everything personally.

I doubt it to.  It depends on what paradigm your working in.  If you say
that jump drives are only an ancient tech and that the races just reverse
enginer the thing, then fine, your point is valid.

If you work in the concept that all races who are technically advanced
enougth can invent jump drives, then the hivers just refined their tech
until they got a better device.

As you said, just a theory.

Chepe and I are not the best of friends, but I have to agree.  I said a

whenever an American quotes the "freedom of speech" act and uses it
justify saying what s/he wants on a list.

Hold the sauce.  I was refering to the Solomani Alien module, I also
pointed out their was nothing *I* could find, which is reasonable since I
dont have the module your quoting from.  

I don\'t know what your problem is with me, but you always seem to take a
very confrontational attitude towards my posts.  I was *very* careful not
to say "It\'s wrong, it\'s not the way it is" - I said "I think".

I challenge you to find in my post where I told him he was wrong, or the
way Ethan was doing it was not the "right way".  I think you should read
the whole post before agreeing with only a section of the post out of
context.

As far as I know David Golden (?) does not play at the moment, so what\'s
with the crack?  I don\'t play the game, so I am not entitled to an
opinion?

Friends, Solomani, Countrymen, lend me your ear!

I spoke for a while with Tim Brown at IG today, and one of the subjects was
the M0/FS "issue." (Is that what we call a shark feeding frenzy nowadays,
where people wind up tearing each other up? An "issue?"). Anyway, he\'s
interested in hearing how you\'d like to see errata made available. He asked
me to post a general request for inputs, and asked that you send them to
the game mechanics address IG has set up: mailto:gamehelp@imperiumgames.com.

What he\'s NOT interested in, and nobody really is, are empty complaints or
attacks. Now, this list has gotten rather hot, people have taken personal
offense, and gone off in a few huffs. But none of this would have happened
if people didn\'t care and have strong opinions.

If you\'d like to make your opinion known, PLEASE:

	1) Take a few deep breaths.
	2) Count to 10
		a) ... in High Vilani.
	3) Write a short, reasoned email explaining how you\'d like to see the
errata, and why.
	4) Go back and look at what you wrote in 3, and see if it\'s possible from
a purely business point of view... giving free copies of the new hardback
to everybody who sends in the cover from the old books might be a wet
dream, but they\'d go out of business. And then who\'d keep the flame?

Remember, despite the ideal of judging things by their content and not
their cover, a well-written, grammatically correct, easily understood
statement always carries more impact than a hodge-podge, emotionally-laden,
potpourri that may distill down to the same idea.

Also remember that content is important. As we\'ve seen lately, nobody likes
personal attacks. Nobody at IG CHOSE this situation deliberately. Be
creative, be constructive, be cool."

Ken,

There is information along these lines contained in the following 
text.  It is a post from Marc Miller. It was posted to the list on 
March 14...

My apologies for the length, but its worth the repost.

Every Adventure Begins and Ends at a Starport
 Every adventure begins and ends at a starport. Starports are the
 means by
which the citizens of every modern society begin their individual
journeys to the stars. These complex constructions provide all of the
facilities and services necessary to support, repair, maintain, and
service the starships that carry interstellar passengers and freight.
They are the central crossroads that all interstellar traffic must
pass through. It stands to reason, then, that interstellar travellers
naturally gravitate to starports... to meet starships and crew, to buy
and sell cargoes, and to begin and end their adventures.
 Starports offer two opportunities for adventure. Travellers can board
 a ship
and travel to the next world, or they can follow the concourse to the
main gate and move out to explore the world they are on. In both
cases, there is an infinity of opportunities for adventure.
 Beginning Adventures. An adventure can start anywhere, but for
 convenience
and for continuity, a starting point must be assigned. That assignment
says that an adventure begins at a starport. When characters enter a
starport, their intent is to find adventure. The details of that
adventure may not become clear until later, but the adventure clearly
begins at the starport.
 Ending Adventures. Likewise, the details, the climax and even the
 payoff for
adventures may take place anywhere, but every adventurer knows in his
or her heart that its not over until they reach the starport.
 The Endless Cycle. So, at the very moment that an adventure ends, a
 new one
begins. The endless cycle in Traveller is the end of an old adventure
and the beginning of a new one; each builds on the previous, and the
cycle never ends until the characters stop going to the starport.

 THE SITUATION INSYSTEM
 A star system is composed of a primary star and one or more stellar
companions. Orbiting these stars are a variety of planets, planetoid
belts, and gas giants. Orbiting planets and gas giants are a variety
of satellites. But the focus is one world... the mainworld... which is
the overall best planet or satellite in the system.
 The mainworld has a starport which, for all practical purposes, is
 the
destination of interstellar traffic entering the system. Starports
vary in their capabilities and facilities, depending on the details of
the world itself.

CLASSIFICATION OF STARPORTS
 Starports are classified by their location and by their capabilities.

Location
 A starport may be located on a world surface, or it may be in orbit
 above
the world. 
 Down. A starport may be located on a world surface. If so, the
 starport is
most frequently referred to by the world name followed by the word
Down. Thus, Sylea Down is the main world surface starport for the
world of Sylea. 
 Why a surface port? Landing close to the market is convenient for all
concerned. If the environment is at all tolerable, then life support
and labor costs are minimized.
 Highport. A starport may be located in orbit above a world. If so, it
 is
most frequently referred to by the world name followed by Highport.
Thus, Sylea Highport is the main orbital starport for Sylea. A
highport maintains scheduled links by shuttle with the world surface
(if there is no surface starport, then with an air transport hub).
 Why a highport? Many very large ships never land on a world surface;
 the
cargo they carry is off-loaded in orbit and shuttled down. Some worlds
are naturally inhospitable (bad surface weather, a water world, fluid
oceans, or perhaps government type D or E) and ship owners prefer not
to risk their equipment venturing down to the surface.
 Spaceports. There is typically one major starport in a star system.
 Other
facilities, especially those on smaller, less important worlds in a
system, are called spaceports. They are established primarily to
foster in-system travel.
 Good spaceports are often established in support of farming projects,
 mining
projects, or small colonies.

Starport Type
 Starport type is based on a simple letter classification system
 (ranging
from A to E) which details their basic facilities.
 A. Excellent quality facility with refined and unrefined fuel
 available on
site. Facilities include capability to perform annual overhaul and new
ship construction (QSDS certified designs). A naval base may be
present. A scout base is usually not present. A surface installation
is present. A highport may be present (generally if the world
atmosphere is 2+).
 B. Good quality starport with refined and unrefined fuel available on
 site.
Facilities include capability to perform annual overhaul and new
spacecraft construction (QSDS certified designs). A naval base may be
present. A scout base may be present. A surface installation is
present. A highport may be present (generally if the world atmosphere
is 2+).
 C. Routine quality starport with unrefined fuel available on site.
Facilities include some capability for repair (primarily replacement
of QSDS-certified parts). A naval base is usually not present. A scout
base may be present. A surface installation is present. A highport is
usually not present.
 D. Poor quality starport with unrefined fuel available on site or
 close by.
It has no repair or construction facilities. A naval base is not
present. A scout base may be present. A surface installation is
present. A highport is not present.
 E. Frontier starport. With no facilities, the installation is little
 more
than a flat expanse of bedrock and a sign. This designation
effectively means there is no starport.

Spaceports
 Worlds other than the mainworld in a system may also have spaceports.
 F. Routine quality spaceport with unrefined fuel available on site
 and minor
repair facilities. A system defense field may be present. A military
base may be present. A surface installation is present. There is no
highport. This designation is a poor cousin to starport type B. 
 G. Poor quality installation with unrefined fuel available nearby. No
 repair
facilities are available. A system defense field may be present. A
military base may be present. A surface installation is present. There
is no highport. This designation is a poor cousin to starport type C. 
 H. Primitive quality installation with no facilities beyond a beacon
identifying the location. Unrefined fuel may be available nearby. This
is a surface installation; there is no highport. A system defense
field may be present. A military base may be present. This designation
is a poor cousin to starport type D.
 Y. No spaceport. This designation is the equivalent to starport type
 E.

THE ELEMENTS OF THE STARPORT
 A starport at its simplest is a bare spot of bedrock capable of
 supporting a
ship which wants to land. The remaining elements of a starport are
added later to support and maintain the traffic that passes through
the port.

The Basic Elements
 Each starport is characterized by a few basic elements. Without them,
 the
starport is not really a starport.
 The Beacon. The location of the starport is broadcast throughout the
 system
from a central beacon. At its simplest, the beacon puts out a
continuous tone which allows ships to home on its position. In more
complex systems, the beacon provides range and position information
for ships in the system, traffic control information on sister
frequencies.
 The Landing Pad. Starships approach from beyond the atmosphere. When
starships set down, most make use of their lifters in order to make a
smooth, relatively slow approach along designated approach corridors.
To deal with ships  with disabled lifters, or for ships which use
lifting surfaces, the landing pad includes long, broad runways.
 For highports, this a designated holding area.
 Traffic Control Facility. Space traffic controllers provide basic
information to ships within the system, vectoring them safely in their
approaches or departures. The traffic control facilities are located
at the starport. In some systems, an auxiliary control facility is
located in an outer orbit. 

The Terminal
 The starport terminal houses the basic services for passengers and
 freight. The Concourse. Passenger services are handled at the
 concourse. Ticketing,
baggage check, and final boarding all take place at this facility.
 Freight Docks. Freight (materials carried by ships for a fee) is
 loaded and
unloaded at the freight docks. Speculative cargoes are held until sold
at the exchange.
 Customs and Immigration. Applicable laws concerning the people and
 goods
moving to the world are enforced by Customs and Immigration.
 The Exchange. Speculative cargo is bought and sold at the Exchange. A
variety of brokers handle the transactions and make the process 
 Accommodations. Passengers passing through the starport can stay
 overnight
at the starport hotel, buy meals at a variety of restaurants, purchase
basic goods and souvenirs at the shops, and pass time at theaters or
entertainment complexes. The level of accommodation available varies
widely.
 Data Terminals. Information is available about the world, its
 products and
services, and recreation at a variety of data terminals. On some
worlds, the data terminal may be a computer; on others, they may be
staff people with prodigious memories; on yet others, they may be
librarians).
 Message Center. Access to communications, including physical mail,
electronic mail, telephone, and video is generally available at the
message center.
 Emergency Medical. Suitable facilities are provided for emergency
 medical
treatment. The medical staff has the training and experience to deal
with a wide variety of medical emergencies.

Peripheral Facilities
 Situated around the edges of the starport are a variety of associated
activities and facilities.
 Starport Defense Establishment (SDE). In addition to security
 personnel (who
function as police), a starport may have an SDE (with a military
function). The SDE is established to defend the starport against
organized assault, and its equipment may include troops, fighter
craft, missile defenses, and artillery. The SDE, to maintain its
independence from the the local world, is often a mercenary force
specifically created for the job.
 Since an SDE is rarely larger than absolutely necessary, it is
 possible to
gauge the local perceived threats to a starport by observing the size
and equipment of the LDE.
 Scout Base. The scout service (whether of the Imperium or of some
 other
interstellar community) may maintain a port facility for the support
and maintenance of its vessels (including those vessels which it may
have out on loan to detached duty scouts). It is possible that the
world on which a scout base is located is not a member of the 
interstellar community which the scout service serves.
 Many scout bases make the information they have accumulated available
outside of their service (including maps, charts, and world surveys).
 Naval Base. The Navy (whether of the Imperium or of some other
 interstellar
community) may maintain a port facility for the support and
maintenance of its vessels. The base includes administration sections,
warehouse for provisions and resupply, and some security personnel.
 The continuing interest of naval personnel in their career area makes
 naval
bases favorite stopovers for veterans (even of other navies).
 Sometimes a specific naval base may be considerably more extensive
 than the
typical installation. Their facilities and equipment come to dominate
the starport rather than complement it.
 System Defense Field. The interplanetary defense forces of a system
 may
maintain a facility for the support of their vessels (system defense
boats) as they rotate off station from the outer reaches of the
systems. The field has a minimum of facilities (provisions are trucked
in when needed; repair trucks call as required). 
 Shipyard. Ships are built at shipyards. For ships of moderate size
 which
will be streamlined and capable of landing on worlds, construction
often takes place on world surfaces at starport shipyards.
 Most shipyards specialize in the construction of a specific assembly
 (which
local industry has shown itself capable of producing) such as jump
drives, avionics, detectors, or even stateroom modules. Other
components are purchased from other shipyards and imported as part of
the QSDS-certified parts system.
 Warehouses on-site store components until they are ready for
 assembly. Ships
themselves are constucted in open-air bays (or in enclosed assembly
structures if the local environment requires).
 Repair Facility. Minor repairs to ships are often accomplished on the
landing pad. More complex or extensive repairs require that the ships
be moved to the repair bays at the edge of the starport. Support
installations near the bays house the instrumentation and equipment
necessary for repairs.
 Transport Hub. The starport is usually integrated into the global
transportation net, and arriving passengers transfer from the terminal
to the transport hubs. Depending on the world, the hubs may support
sea or undersea transport, air transport, or ground rail transport. In
addition, personal vehicle rental may be available.
 Industry. Many industrial processes are best carried out in zero-G
 and/or
vacuum. What better place for such operations than adjacent to a major
orbital transportation center? Industrial modules attached to the
Highport create products or commodities which benefit from immediate
access to the ships calling at the port. Some factories have long-term
supply contracts with the highport itself.

Organization
 A starport has an organizational structure which includes a leader
 and a
mission; the details of each starport are different, although they are
generally variations on a basic theme.
 The Port Authority. Regardless of the local government in power at
 the
starport, the governing authority for the facility is the Port
Authority. Financed by a variety of charges and levies on passengers,
cargo, and ships, the Authority uses its money to build and maintain
its facilities, and to provide variety of services. Like starports,
Port Authorities vary widely in structure and approach to their
responsibilities. Some are strong corporate organizations devoted to
the pursuit of profit; others are non-profit organizations which view
their responsibilities more as services to the citizenry; yet others
consider themselves a quasi-official arm of local government.
 The Port Warden. The person in complete charge of the starport is the
 Port
Warden. Appointed by the Port Authority, the Warden is the chief
executive officer for the facility, and wields great, but not
unlimited power. 
 The Mission of the Starport. The starport, as an organization, is
 committed
to a mission (although that mission may not be clearly or publicly
stated). Typical missions are:
  To efficiently provide facilities and services necessary to
  accommodate
interplanetary and interstellar traffic for this world.
  To produce a maximum of income for the organization which operates
  this
starport.
  To insulate this world, to the maximum extent possible, from outside
influences.
  To meet the minimum requirements for maintaining interstellar trade.
 Regulation Enforcement. The police and security arm of the Port
 Authority
has the responsibility of protecting the orderly operation of the
starport and of enforcing its regulations. It consists of enforcers
and emergency techs.
 The typical enforcer carries out the role of helpful police officer,
 often
assisting passengers in mundane tasks. Behind the scenes, however, a
stronger, better armed force stands ready to back them up if
necessary.
 Emergency techs provide basic services such as paramedical response,
 rescue
operations, and fire fighting. Emergency tech stations are situated
throughout the starport, providing the ability to make a quick
response anywhere within the starport\'s boundaries.

Each Starport Is Unique
 Starports vary widely due to the circumstances and environment in
 which they
exist. When the differences in world size, atmosphere, and
hydrographics are coupled with population and technological levels,
government, and trade classifications, it becomes clear that each
starport is an individual facility.

UNOFFICIAL FACILITIES
 Not all facilities at a starport come under the jurisdiction of the
 Port
Authority. 
 The Scout Lounge. Those who conduct surveys of star systems and who
continually venture out into unexplored or under-explored space are a
special type of people. After long periods of time alone or with their
fellow crew, they naturally gravitate to others of their kind... to
share stories and experiences which may help them survive. The typical
starport has a Scout Lounge for this type of people.
 The Scout Lounge is usually operates as a semi-private club;
 theoretically
anyone can use its services, but in practice it is only patronized
comfortably by scouts (and those with an affinity for scouts).
 The Hiring Hall. Crew members looking for work gather at the hiring
 hall.
Ships calling at the starport look first to the hiring hall when they
need new or replacement crew. Because of ship schedules which must be
met, it is possible for a crew person to be hired and off world within
a few hours notice.
 The Lone Star. Many starports have a recreation facility which
 welcomes and
serves all comers. At its tables, people meet and enjoy light music or
video, conversation, and meals. To many the Lone Star is an
opportunity to meet others on a casual basis, to develop
acquaintances, and even grow them into friendships.
 The Traveller\'s Aid Society. Some individuals make travel their
 primary
vocation. If they are able, they join the Traveller\'s Aid Society,
which provides facilities to its members. The Traveller\'s Aid Society
is a joint operation of several large hotel chains, which provide the
facilities within or adjacent to their own hotels and restaurants.
 Members join by depositing a large sum of money as annuity, with the
proceeds paying for the benefits they receive.
 Startown. Although starports are often established near large cities,
 the
community which springs up at the gates to the starport has come to be
called (generically) Startown. This community is the home of many of
the starport employees and houses many stores, restaurants, and bars
that serve those who want to wander outside of the starport\'s
boundaries.

UNDERSTANDING STARPORTS
 The key to understanding a starport is a continuing awareness of its
purpose. Starports exist to foster traffic, and thus trade, between
the stars. Governments may attempt to control or suppress the
activities of starports, but when they do, they naturally suppress the
benefits of trade and commerce for their worlds. The natural state of
starports is to flourish; if the starport\'s world has resource which
can be profitably marketed to other worlds, the starport generate
economic benefit.
 Extra-Territoriality. In order to foster interstellar traffic,
 starports are
extra-territorial. Just as embassies are treated as if they are the
territory of their owning nations, starports are treated like they are
off-world space. Passengers and crew alike are allowed to leave their
starships and wander freely (subject to security and safety
restrictions) throughout a starport. Goods are not subject to customs
or taxes until they leave a starport. The laws of the world do not
apply to until a traveller leaves the starport.
 Law and Order. There must be some law and order within a starport,
 and the
means of achieving that order is the local Starport Regulations.
Established by the Port Authority, these regulations define in detail
what behaviors are permitted and prohibited. For most people, ordinary
behavior is sufficient to stay within the regulations. Strange
requirements are typically posted clearly.
 Ship Construction and Repair. Starships and spacecraft require an
 extensive
system of construction and repair sites, and the overhead of designing
and maintaining the many parts which go into ships can be
overwhelming. Consequently, many starports subscribe to the QSDS
(Quality Ship Design Scheme): a set of standard component
specifications which are manufactured on worlds with the appropriate
tech level and industrial capacity, but which can be assembled and
maintained at any starport of the appropriate type, regardless of
local tech level or industrial capacity. 
 Money. Ultimately, every starport must make money if it is to remain
 in
operation. Starports cannot give their services away, but most find a
way to hide those charges away from the consuming public. Restaurant
charges include a surcharge; starship lines pay a portion of their
ticket price and freight charges to the starport. Since all of this is
concealed from the typical passenger, the impression is that the
starport is a free facility.

STARPORT AMBIENCE
 The ambience of the starport is of prime importance. When travellers
 arrive
at a starport the atmosphere and the condition of the facilities
create an impression that will stay with them for a long time. This
impression (and the elaboration of this impression) develops over
time. 
 The appearance of a starport may range from modern or new to old and
decayed.
 The staff of a starport may be respectful and attentive, or rude and
obnoxious.
 Officials may be straightforward and honest, or they may be corrupt
 and
self-serving.	

MANY DIFFERENT STARPORTS
 Starports vary in the way their provide their services. Major
 influences on
them include the world trade classifications, the elements of the UWP,
and other less clear factors.
 Water World. With land at a premium, starships land in the water
 (perhaps
sheltered by natural or artificial islands) and are serviced by boats.
 Asteroid Belt. Ships dock in the microgravity of an asteroid.
 Storms. If a world has an exceptionally turbulent atmosphere, most
 traffic
may choose to call at the highport and shuttle down on craft
specifically engineered for local conditions.

THE STARPORT VISIT
 A ship entering a star system leaves jump space approximately 100
 stellar
diameters out (typically at interplanetary range). The approach to the
starport takes perhaps a day, during which the appropriate radio
contact and identification procedure completed.
 At the world, the ship completes a landing maneuver while in voice
 and data
contact with the local space traffic controller.
 Once at the surface, the ship settles into its assigned landing bay.

    'index' => 'bn361',
    'month' => '05',
    'topic' => 'Something Positive',
    'body' => 'In the interest of getting back on topic, here are my recommendations
for what IG can do to get back on track:

1) The data in FS hasn\'t been broken for just a year or so, it has been
broken since DGP generated it probably around ten years ago.  Those
assembling the data for FS did not know this, or it would have been
fixed.  IG now has a responsibility to the fans of Traveller to fix what
is broken, not just ignore it, and turn it into something positive.  I
have no doubt that most people would be satisfied with a new supplement
that corrects the problems with FS, if the result were compatible with
M0 and  if enough new material were included.  Surely somebody on staff
can gather together a half dozen good adventures out of the submissions
for publication to IG--there is your new material.  Wrap it all up with
a bow (figuratively speaking) and sell it for under 30 bucks.  It will
sell.

2) IG has a better, more realistic stellar and advanced planetary
generation system sitting on the shelf right now than has ever appeared
in any Traveller version yet.  Find a vehicle for it and get it out in
print.  I have sworn off pretty much all of T4, but even *I* would buy
this.

3) Update the IG Web site more frequently.  Include the Traveller News
Service posts that take place after 1119.  Pretending the Rebellion
didn\'t devolve into hell or that Virus didn\'t happen compromises the
official storyline to the point that it is meaningless.

4) Hire a full time creative staff, to include writers and artists. 
Anyone who can name the original lineup of the music group Chicago or
has a child in high school need not apply.  White men who graduated high
school in the 60s and 70s are killing T4 because they their lives
revolve around everything but the game (including competing products). 
If it helps, go to Japan and raid the first publishing house that
creates anime you find.  If you don\'t know what anime is, rent the movie
Akira.

5) How about that TNE follow up product that was promised?  Loren
Wiseman and Dave Nilsen have been contacted, and are willing to do such
a product.  Why isn\'t it being followed through on?  Do it.

6) Force everyone doing creative work for T4 to read the storyline
material created for classic Traveller, MegaTraveller, and select bits
from TNE.  Have everyone take an exam on it if necessary.  This saves
time (because you don\'t have to constantly reinvent the wheel), and cuts
down on criticism of T4 products (because they fit into the Traveller
Canon).

7) If the prices aren\'t going to be lowered, make each product in such a
way that when people look at it, they say "yeah, that\'s worth $24.95"
(or whatever).  You do this through quality, content, and quality (yeah,
I know I typed it twice).

8) Advertise, advertise, advertise.  Remember that 120 years ago there
was no soda pop industry.  Now you can\'t go anywhere without finding the
stuff.  People are convinced in fact that they *need* it.  Why? 
Advertise, advertise, advertise.

   All for now.

Harold

Yeah, I am too.  I looked at CORPS in a nutshell over the weekend and it

Well, it could be pointed out that it\'s not necessarily
50,000 years (the coyns having been revised along the
way).  However, Grandfather has an intellegence and

    'body' => 'Hello all,
	
I am Chatham Ewing. I am 31, married, and live in a tiny apartment in
Greenwich Village. I teach English in New York City. My work is rewarding,
but very hard, and I look to my hobbies for playful alternatives to the
every day grind.

I\'ve liked IG\'s T4. Particularly, I\'ve liked the clarity and simplicity of
the systems presented in the book. I was able to grasp them immediately,
and I enjoyed looking through them and reading them. Though there were a
few typos here and there, the T4 basic rule book was the first Traveller
product in the entire life of the game to catch my eye in a game store (I\'m
usually in there looking for chess stuff or war-games). I remember a thread
about new players coming to Traveller a while ago, and I thought I\'d
mention that IG\'s product found one. I\'ve really liked the original T4 rule
book that I bought that day, and I\'ve found it to be a great deal of fun.
I\'ve gotten my gaming group to play a few games, and we haven\'t had too
much trouble with rules systems. The rules get the job done, I fill in the
gaps, and the game goes on.

Anyhow, as a fan of the internet, I thought I\'d check out a search engine
and see if there was Traveller material there. I quickly found the IG site,
and to my surprise, received prompt answers to my e-mail correspondance
with IG. They also seem pretty good with orders. I\'ve recently ordered the
deluxe edition of the rules, mainly because I\'m really curious to see what
the new ship-design rules will be like.

My search of the internet also turned up TML. As a long time role-playing
gamer and GM, but someone new to the Traveller game, I eagerly subscribed,
hoping to find focussed discussion of the game which would help me learn
about it. Initially, I found it. I have quietly lurked and watched for the
past few months (I\'ve even posted twice), and I\'ve very much enjoyed the
THUDD compettitions (even toyed with the idea of entering one...), the
backgrounds, and the other discussions of materials related to game play.

Lately, this list hasn\'t been as fun to read as it once was. I don\'t like
foul language meanly used, and I have no taste for gratuitous name calling.
I see and experience enough of that every day in every way in New York City.  

I wish you all well and respect the terrific creativity here, but I will
not be continuing on this list. For me and what I\'d like to accomplish with
my hobby, the benefits of the list\'s creativity have been far outweighed by
the recent and ever more voluminous cycles of vituperative discourse. 
     
I thank the list for the opportunity it provided me to learn about
Traveller and its community of gamers. 

Sincerely,

Chatham Ewing

I don\'t even care what IG does in this regard.  If we produce a better

worthwhile endeavor.

And of course, -WE- want maps, so of course there should be maps.

I am very interested in this project, and would be proud to help out!

Test case (as I find your views intriguing):  Is the

Wow, that\'s cool!  I was already a science nut when I found Trav (in 10th
grade), but I did learn Newtonian physics at a gut, intuitive level
playing Book 2 starship combats, mostly with my brother Douglas.

I do agree that it\'s best to clearly point out what\'s current knowledge,
what\'s extrapolation, and what\'s broken for playability purposes.

So far, astonishingly enough, it doesn\'t break canon at all seriously, and
it brings drive power levels back down to reasonable levels.  It does
introduce one odd effect involving sudden starts and stops by turning the
Bergenholm on and off, and I\'m worried my momentum/energy balance check
will torpedo it.  Stay tuned...

I take it you\'re quibbling with my LOX/H2 Isp; the HEPlaR one is derived
at:

  http://www.missouri.edu/~ccjoe/traveller/house/thrusters.html

The 800 sec figure is for theoretically perfect, 100% efficient LOX/H2
burning; the figures for actual rockets appear to run in the range 300-400
sec.  So in this case, *I* am the physicist, and *you* are the engineer. :)

Come to think of it, this does sound pretty travellerish.

Paul,

   First let me say that I felt in necessary to include the list in my
response to your e-mail.  Forgive me if you preferred that your words
not be aired publically.

   It is indeed my last word on the subject to the list.  In both my
response posts, I made a point of suggesting that things be taken
"outside".

   I came to the defense of a fellow TMLer because I felt he was being
flamed unfairly.  In response, I was flamed.  I responded with more
flame.  As in most wars, the calls for peace were received on this end
after I had launch my last barrage.

   This list has seen more than its share of hard feelings.  I recall
the flame wars that took place when TNE was announced.  *Those* were
true flame wars.  Verbal napalm, fuel-air explosives and the occasional
nuke.  I did not participate in them directly, but they literally spread
off TML and over to other Traveller discussion areas.  As a regular on
the GEnie Traveller areas, I fought on the pro-GDW side.  Fortunately,
things did not get as vicious as they did on TML.

   On the other hand, when people took offense back then, it was for
good reasons.  People may have questioned each other sanity, but no one
resorted to calling each other Nazis (I find the latter much more
offensive).  The difference between the Old West and street gang warfare
of the \'90s I suppose.

   This is not to say that I\'m nostalgic for the "good old days".  Those
flame wars probably indirectly help contribute to GDW\'s demise.  I think
even the most diehard anti-TNE type now wishes he could go back and
temper his comments, if it would bring back GDW.

   There have been calls for peace and for unity.  While we should have
peace, there will never be total unity here.  There is a significant
(and growing) anti-IG, anti-T4 faction.  I say \'faction\', though its
constituents parts (diehard cTers, MTers, TNEers, and true heretics)
have little in common beyond a hatred for what IG has done to the game,
and a love for Traveller--a love also shared by pro-T4 types.  

   Perhaps there is enough to unify us afterall. 

Regards,

Harold

If you are talking about what I think you are talking about, only the
information for the Core sector was redone. Originally it was done for M0,
with the CORE team told that they would have control over that sector, and
that FS would include their information. IG decided at the last minute to
go with the FS data, and left the (more correct, and by the sounds of it
more useful) data generated for M0 out of the book.

Joe, correct me if I\'m wrong (and you\'re out there)??

Cheers,
Jason

PS: Count me in for helping generate new data for FS. I\'ve already done 2
subsectors in the xxx sector (left of Core, below Vland, starts with a D).
Although I don\'t have any Traveller material other than T4, so what I\'ve
done may not agree with published material for later time periods.

Wonderful, Ryan.  I\'m keeping all of these posts in their own special 
folder.  I just posted a letter to Courtney Solomon about this 
project--we are now waiting to see if he will go for it.

Any more volunteers for the TML-FS Project?

I found the URL for Traveller navigator on a recent post, and jumped
straight to it. I tried to download the programs, but unfortunately the
ftp site seems to be dead - the \'ftp:\' URL and ftp programs themselves
both report an ICMP timeout on ftp.best.com, although www.best.com is
active

Any ideas on why the site is inaccessible, or anywhere else I can find
the navigator programs?

    'body' => '  Craig reminded me that the voting is this Sunday, so I have put together
some brief comments on the THUDDD designs to help folks make their
decisions.  This will not be as detailed as usual, as I am pressed for
time - I did want to make my opinions known, however, since several folks
have told me they enjoy my comments.

  Overall, the designs were well done, though as usual some were better
than others, in my opinion.  This is the first time I think my own design
is as good or better than the rest - I\'ll explain why in the commentary
below.

  Most folks opted for a 2000T or higher hull and J3, the appropriate
response for an exploratory ship, I think.  The Recollet is the only
smaller ship at 500T - nice, but not that different than a far trader in
game terms.  The Naphaitelle is the only J2 design (I think; I did this
rather fast), an interesting decision that made for some economies but
is a handicap in the primary mission.

  Everybody put in engineering and vehicle shops, a sick bay, and low
berths for the sick, so no comments on that below.  One mistake that
several folks made was putting their small craft in minimal hangers.  The
rules say that means no room for repairs and overhauls - I marked off for
that.

  The big lack on all these ships is defensive armament, given their size,
and given that they are tasked to defend themselves against ships of equal
tonnage.  My design, the Type 1108, has 20 sandcasters and 10 nuclear
dampers, which i thought might be a bit small for a 3000T ship.  No other
design comes close, other than the 3000T Knarr, with 24 Sandcaster but
only 1 damper.  I would strongly urge folks to look realistically at
defensive capability of these designs - I think they are all underequiped
with defensive systems (aside from my Type 1108, of course). 

  All in all, not bad, though some designs are rather too expensive in my
view.  Here are specific comments.  As an aid to economic analysis, I have
given a cost in MCr per ton based on the listed cost and cargo space.
This is deceptive on some designs, since cost of small craft is not
included, but since that is a small percentage, these figures work for
gross comparisons.


Recollet (2.2 MCr-Ton)

  A dull Familie Spofullam design - a real surprise.  Competant, but
uninspiring, and underdefended.  Cheap, but no sale.

Encounter (4 MCr/Ton)

  Has the minimal hanger flaw for small craft maintenance, and a very high
per ton cargo cost.  Lots of missiles, but weak defense.

Terrapin (1.1 MCr/Ton)

  Only 1 G manuever, a tiny meson screen, though a fair number of
sandcasters and lasers.  Has only the single shuttle - no redundancy on
long voyages.  An okay design, but not spectacular - cheap on a per ton
basis.

Type 1108 (1.1 MCr/ton)

  Lots of defensive equipment, with a few lasers and missiles to keep the
enemy busy.  Redundant shuttles, extra space during jump for the crew from
the collapsable tank.  Above all, additional security on the ground for
the crew from the robot security and Companion-type contact robots.  It
may be my design, but I have been critical of my designs in comparison to
others in the past - this compares very well, I think, especially in terms
of protection of crew and cargo.

Anderson (7.3 MCr/Ton)

  By far the most expensive design per ton of cargo, and you do not get
all that much.  You do get a big honking laser, though - just the thing to
convince the natives of you peaceful intentions.  The defensive systems
are not that great, though the thick 30 Armor helps.  I\'m not sold on the
idea of a carried jump courier - why not just send that ship along
separately and free up cargo space?  One of the designs I like least.
Finally, the hanger are fuel tanks are not strictly legal, though
reasonable - heaven help you if you have a leak, though.


Elisabeth (2.7 MCr/Ton)

  Again, big honking lasers, with only a few defensive systems.  One hell
of a meson screen at 7.  Expensive on a per cargo ton basis, though not
bad - the redundant ships boats are good.

Knarr (1.5 MCr/ton)

  The closest in spirit to my Type 1108 design, though more expensive.
I\'m not sure why the 24 sandcasters and only one damper - TL11- ships tend
to use missiles more than lasers.  Remember, dampers have to be targeted;
each damper can only screen one missile at a time, so you need lots of
dampers to deal with lots of missiles.  Ships boat not included, so no
points for redundancy.

Naphaitelle (0.9 MCr/Ton)

  The cheapest design per ton, and it shows.  Only Jump 2 and manuever 1,
with minimal defensive armament.  The two 50 T spacious hangers are nice,
though I think the carried scout ship is a bad idea - the redundancy of
two shuttles is better for long trips.  Not bad, but better as a trader
inside the Imperium than an exploratory trader.

Monte Cristo (2.4 MCr/Ton)

  Fairly expensive per tone of cargo, and you get no pasenger space, no
meson screen, tight crew quarters, and only 2 nuclear dampers.  The six
sandcasters are better than nothing, and the two spacious 50T bays make
for redundancy.  I also liked the escape pod.  Not bad, but a bit on the
expensive side.

Ming (1.5 MCr/Ton)

  A surprising low per cargo ton cost, despite the extra space taken up by
modularizing all the cargo space.  Good redundancy on the landers, and the
image of dumping all the pods and running in an emergency sounds like a
great TV image.  The lack of any dampers make it vunerable to missiles, i
think, thopugh there are a fair number of sandcasters.  One problem with
putting the laders on grapples is that it makes repairs on long missions
far more difficult - a real problem in my book

Christobal Colon (7 MCr to 2 MCr/Ton)

  This is not a strictly legal QSDS design - the grapple table only goes
up to 90T carried craft.  These could be SSDS components, however, and so
legal (though SSDS is not mentioned by the designer).  The reason for the
range in cost per ton is due to most of the cargo being in the grappled
modules; 7 is for the ship without attached cargo, and the 2 is with three
purely cargo modules.  Lots of laser and missile weaponry, but only 2
dampers and 6 sandcasters.  This ship also has maintenance problems, since
the carried craft are in minimal hangers or on grapples.

  Again, I fail to see the need for carried jump-capable craft - just send
some smaller ships along withthe larger ship, and then the larger one does
not have to lug about extra-large jump drives when the small ship is away.


  Overall, I like my Type 1108 the best, followed by the Terrapin (though
I\'d replace the 90T shuttle with 2 45T ones for redundancy).  The Ming is
the most intersting design, though I fail to see a good rational for all
those modules.

After reading the posts complaining about the deterioration of 
manners and behaviour on the list, i must say that i agree.
I am sure everybody has a right to voice his opinions, and also 
have good discussion about it\'s validity but if someone has a problem 
with another list member, he shouldn\'t post it to the list, he should 
post it to that person... Not that i am a Saint in that respect...I 
participated as well in this whole mess, but now that we are loosing 
list-members, i feel the boundaries have been crossed. On the other 
hand, some people are taking things too seriously: To them I say: 
Lighten up folks!
We all share the same background: We Love Traveller! 
That point should unite us, not drive us apart.
We should get back to business as usual. We know that IG messed up 
with FS, just about everyone voiced his opinions, now go tell IG 
about it, not us. We all know IG didn\'t buy KBv2.0 (nothing 
personal Ken, I like it, but still rather use the MT-TS) and the new 
Task System is broken as well. So go tell IG, not us, because  we 
already know. This reminds me of the rockdropping-thread we had a 
while back, and to be honest, i wish it came back! At least it had 
some relevance to Traveller: The Game, not Traveller: The Rules.

I propose just that people start lightening up. Don\'t call people 
names, that\'s not an adult way to behave. Don\'t get angry if you are 
called names, an e-mail is often written in anger and very quickly 
sent, and so what if someone calls you names: Just speaks volumes 
about themselves, doesn\'t it? 
We should get back to discussion Traveller. Critiques of IG\'s work 
are welcome, how else are we to decide what to buy, but should not 
get out of hand. Post only if you have something new to the 
discussion, not just to repeat what went before.

If we all just try our best, i am sure the TML is a great place to be!

Offhand I\'d say 70-80 % of people on the list neither play nor referee
Traveller at the moment but their points might be valid nevertheless. The
important thing is wether the poster knows what the discussion is about
before posting.
Please note that I neither of you suffer from this fallacy and that I\'m
only commenting in general (has the Virus invaded the TML and made all
people stingy and fightpicky if that is a word?)

I don\'t get it. Why do we have to give up Traveller because IG produces
crap? The T4 product hasn\'t affected my Traveller universe one bit but some
stuff on TML shure has. IMHO TML produces more usable stuff for me than DGP
did at their height (not as many cool illustrations though). Maybe I am
slightly braindamaged from being a referee with an ongoing campaign for
most of the last decade but I like rolling it on my own. If T4 stuff sucks
and you don\'t want to make it up yourselves, buy GURPS stuff. Pretty good
illustrations, so-so combat system and a very good design system. Or use
the CORPS system which seems quite nice. Or convert Traveller into the
elegant FUDGE system. Traveller is maps, UWPs and BACKGROUND, BACKGROUND,
BACKGROUND. Use whatever you like and share your thoughts with the list.

Sorry for being a bit evangelical and preachy but just I\'ve had too much coffee.

You know...I\'ll bet that battlefield first aid will be a lot like it is
today...throw on a bunch of antibiotics, stuff enough bandages on to stop
the bleeding, shoot \'em full of morphine and pass \'em along..._fast_...
The real miracles take place in the field hospitals, where they patch them
up enough so they\'ll stay alive (vs. not dying right away, which is what
first aid does), and do so long enough to get shipped to a real hospital
for rehab/reconstruction, etc.

IIRC this is basically what the US did in Vietnam, and there were claims
that if they lived long enough to get to the MASH, 90% of them lived.

Now, of course, if a TL12 battlefield follows the trends of current
warfare, particularly if energy or gauss weapons are used a lot, first aid
might be turned into \'Hey..are you alive?\'  Combat could be far deadlier,
with few injuries, and lots of people scratched or dead, with little in
between.

If reading the TML has become a burden rather than a delight then you 
should definitely stop. Traveller is a hobby. It is supposed to be fun.
When it ceases to be fun it\'s time to move on.

Having said that, I can\'t help wondering if you\'re not overreacting. I
suppose I can\'t judge just how much bad feeling the TML has caused you.
But considering the speed of turnover in subjects here on the list, I
will ask you to consider just refraining from reading it for a week or
two. It would be a sad loss to the list if you and Stuart left.

 I really dislike s/f story lines that belittles humanities ability to

 I understand that some people need gods to explain things away, but 
does Traveller really need this subplot?
 The last game I was involved in was in 1989 on the USS South Carolina. 
The plot had agents of the Grandfather (the other players) trying to

I\'ve received a good response to my suggestion, so I\'m going to (as the
Yanks say), take the ball and run with it.  It may take a while, but what
the hell, my social life needs toning down anyway.

I propose to do the following:

a) Send mail to Imperium Games, firstly requesting their permission to
disseminate corrected data, and secondly offering it for their use (I\'m not
sure where I stand ref the Berne Convention on copyright, so I\'m not taking
chances)

b) Spend two weeks (or more) hashing about with anyone who is interested on:

	I  -	What needs to be fixed
	II -	How we go about fixing it

c) Farm out sectors to whomever is interested.  I\'ll take on eon myself, in
addition to my ongoing \'Solomani Rim - M:0\' project (it\'s on the way, for
those who are interested, I\'m cannibalising parts of my old TNE campaign -
\'The Near Bootes Commonwealth).

d) Publish draft data on my website for perusal and comment.

Any comments and suggestions are welcomed.  Send mail to
mickb@opera.iinet.net.au

Those who wish to take part, let me know and I\'ll put you on my recipient
list.  (Kenneth, Scot, Carlos and Ryan - I\'ve already taken the liberty of
putting your names on).

Remember though, this is only _suggested_ corrected data, and I make no
claims as to it\'s veracity, or conformity with that elusive concept,
\'canon\'.  Feel fre to use it as you wish.

Thanks for your time,


Michael Bailey

PS - does anyone have an appropriate email address at IG?

        Yikes! Then, I have to subscribe to the TNE-RCES mailing list.
Sorry, I do not have the address at hand.. can somebody tell me how to subscribe?

        I looked extensively before creating sectors J and K, and found nothing.

>Specific question to Carlos
>Do you have collpased all the Massilia Sector or just 2 subsectors?

        Neither the whole sector nor only two subsectors. I\'ve collapsed the
two main Geonee subsectors, some nearby worlds, and two clusters of worlds
around two important Geonee worlds that are far away from Shiwonee: Forquee
and Parahee. I do not have them here (I am at work), but I will post all I
have to the TNE-RCES list as soon as I can subscribe. I also collapsed the
worlds of the Rebin Empire and immediate surroundings, to create yet another
pocket empire... but that\'s not very much developed.

        Anyway, you may not like my collapsing method: it consists in
looking carefully and personally into each world, and creating some history.
No rules, no algorithms, just a bit of logic. And I do not use the TNE
"Wilds" codes, just standard UWPs.

>Thanks a lot for replying.

        You are very much welcome. Help me into the TNE-RCES list so that we
can continue to discuss about Massilia in the New Era.

Traveller background in a brief pause of the overwhelming amount of work
I\'ve got these days...

        I\'ve recently noticed an interesting bit. Way back in time, GDW
released the Rebellion Sourcebook, by Marc W. Miller. There, we can found a
map with all the numbered subsector fleets of the 3I. The first 4 fleets are
around Sylea, which fits. But the 5,6, and 7, are placed in very interesting
places. One is in Shiwonee/Massilia, where the Geonee homeworld is. Antoher
is in Ilelish, exactly where the Suerrat are. And the third (number 5, IIRC)
is in subsector A/Dagudashaag (I\'ve no idea about what special could be there).

        This can NOT be just chance. It has been made on purpose. These
subsectors are really far away from Sylea, and, in between, there are fleets
numbered on the hundreds..

        The point is, how did numbered fleets appear? Probably, IMHO, the
biggest fleets got the first numbers. Those forces which were first
organized and well-established were numbered first. Imagine: After the
Pacification Campaigns, the Geonee and the Suerrat were subjugated. Huge
numbers of ships were around the corresponding homeworlds. So, naturally,
they were organized into fleets and got very low numbers.

        This creates an interesting observation... how long has been Marc
planning special roles for the Geonee and the Suerrat?

        And, a question: What is in A/Dagudashaag?

        This is really food for thought. Careful examination of the Fleet
Map could offer some insight into the yet untold history of the Imperium.

   Fair enough.

   A public attack requires a public response.  As I have posted
recently, if I am guilty of anything, its the crime of expressing myself
before the offended party had a chance to properly respond.  For that I
apologize to the offended party, to the TML as a whole, but not to Twolf
or to you.

>Instead it seems that you had something to prove by

   Wrong.  I was defending a fellow member of the list, just as, believe
it or not, I would defend you if someone else had attack you in a
similar manner.

   Again, a public insult demands a public response.  Otherwise, why
would you feel it necessary to post your reply to the list and not just
send it to me in person?  As for stopping personal attacks, I merely
turned your insult back on you.

   How can you make this statement after hurling insults at me?  You

   Again with the insults.  I\'m curious, when someone flips you the
golden eagle on the expressway because they think you cut them off, do
you follow them home so that you can tell them how hurt and upset you
are about their actions in private?  I didn\'t think so.

   Look, Ken, you, Twolf, Suz, me, and for that matter everyone else on
this list can engage in a massive urination contest until finally
there\'s nothing but posts here filled with bile and hate.  I\'m sure
everyone will have a marvelous time letting each other have it. 
Meanwhile the people on HIWG-list and the TNE-RCES list will continue to
do productive work.  I\'m perfectly willing to call the whole thing a
draw at this point, shake hands, and get back to Traveller related
issues.  If you find this agreeable, let the thread die.  If you feel
the need to once again respond, do it to me directly.  Ok?

   Well sort of...judges have stretched the Consititution a number of
times to cover things not expressly mentioned.  Also, there is a large
body of US Federal legislation which deals with the issue of free
speech, for example, there is a law which says that labor unions have a
right to organize and recruit new members on the private property of
businesses, even if the business objects.  These laws have been upheld
as constitutional.

   Just what we need, AOL II.

>And for infantile behavior of this sort, perhaps MPGN should....

   And on that day I will break the world record for unsubscribing to a

   Ob. Trav:  The issue of free speech would be an interesting one in
the Third Imperium.  Would there be laws that prohibit advocating a
republican form of government?  or for that matter, advocating the
deification of the Emperor?

Rob Prior has suggested the Sci-Fi Cafe, which I believe is located

If you\'re interested in coming and have not yet dropped me a line, 
please do so. The 14th might be good, as people could come from out of town,
but it is kinda close to Father\'s day (could be Grandfather\'s day??).
If you\'re coming from out of town but would like to suggest another date,
please do so. I\'d like to gets many TML people together as possible,

On the other hand, it is quite possible for a smaller population to
"work harder" given the required resources in their area. Especially
given that TL1 is *pre*-gunpowder.

Remember, a "TL1" culture merely has to be able to do things a TL0
can\'t. They don\'t have to be able to do *all* the things listed for TL1!

And there\'s also the big difference between "evolved tech" and
"colonial tech". You may need hundreds of thousands to comeup with TL1,
but that doesn\'t mean that a colony can\'t be setup (in a deliberately
chosen area) to be self-sustaining with a much smaller population base.

All you need are good farmlands, a source of energy (stream suitable
for waterwheel, or winds steady enough for windmill) and some nearby
ore deposits. They don\'t even have to be all that *big* as "normal"
needs (non-wartime) can be met with *very* little metal.

Metal and ore did get traded over wide areas, but villages with a
deposit "good enough" for local use did exist. So all you really need
is a few hundred (most for the fields) and a smith or two.

*deep breath*

You\'re right. Sorry about getting all snappy like that. You didn\'t tell 
me to shut up, of course (I said it was irrelevent, didn\'t I?).
I was still a bit riled up about all those other flamewars going on.
Apologies. (Must... defuse...TML... before... it... expl*BOOM*)

Anyways, thanks to Douglas for finding the Solomani&Aslan reference for
me. I think that in later years some GDW & DGP people kinda got the idea
in their heads that a lot more races had copied jump drive than originally
thought, so they dropped a lot of little hints all over the place.
Reality, both in reality and in Traveller, is a pretty fluid thing - 
I\'d say that you could run a campaign alternating between both theories
and the players probably wouldn\'t think much of it...  it might make a good 
adventure hook or at least a good red herring.

The Zhos found this big thing that shows a super-accurate map
of a corridor going from Zhodani space most of the way to the core.
The cool thing is, it isn\'t just a map - it actually shows what\'s
happening in that section of space, not just in real time, but also
in flashes from the past and _from the future_! it\'s also psionically
active, causing a strage feeling of hilarity (like, supper giddiness)
in some small percentage of viewers. Very wierd. It would make a good
milieu book though, which I think was on MM\'s list of possible milieu books.
(That is, the Zho Core Expeditions)

Chapter 1 - Beginnings.

It is the year 1105, the place the gas giant moon Regina in the Spinward
Marches sector, and you have all mustered out from your respective military
services. These were: the Imperial Interstellar Scout Service (Blueberry),
the Imperial Interstellar Navy (Colt), the Imperial Marines (James Hunter)
and the Merchant Navy (Ms. Virgo Epstein).

At this turning point in your careers, you all have ambitions. Ambitions
that led Hunter and Epstein to meet at a bar in the Startown, the neutral
Imperial controlled area by Regina Downport. Blueberry and Colt had met in
a drinking binge earlier that week, and were presently sampling the local
beverages in that same bar. By a masterful piece of intuition, you guessed
that you were all interested in similar lines of work, and began talking.
Then a fracas developed in the bar, as some drunken sailors picked a fight
with the Scout personnel that patronise the bar. This was turning nasty,
until Blueberry saved the day, and frightened the drunkards away with a
flobee and some bullets in the roof of the establishment.

You got to talking to the senior Scout Administrator present (Administrator
Galaden) and eventually, he mentioned that he had two jobs that you might
be interested in. You agreed to meet the next morning, and went to your
respective homes wondering what the next day would bring.

After you had managed to get past his overly protective and officious
secretary, you set down to talking. Two tasks were offered, and accepted.
The first was to fly the body of a recently deceased Scout back to his kin
on the planet Yorbund, [PLOT HOOK for Shadows] and the second, to survey
the local worlds that you passed, with a cash bonus for encouragement. The
real bonus of the deal was the loan of a Scout/Courier, the Aurora

(The above adventure used parts of \'The Imperial Fringe\' CT Introductory
Adventure.)

Chapter 2 - The Rings of Forboldn IV.

You boarded the Aurora, to find that she was, as promised, a standard 100
Ton Scout/Courier, with much of the specific survey and communications
equipment removed. However, enough remained for you to survey planets as
you travelled through the subsector, and beyond. The previous owner\'s taste
in decor wasn\'t everything that you liked, but that could be altered as
time moved on, and funds permited. The ship had enough fuel to make orbit,
and thanks to the agreement you\'d entered into with the scout service you
had access to their facilities at starports, scout bases, and way stations
(links in the interstellar communication Xboat network).

After spending some time bickering over which cabin was whose [almost got
to gunplay], you took off, and headed away from the gas giant moon Regina,
sector and subsector capital. The flight out to refueling was almost
without incident, aside from some awkward questions from a naval patrol
cruiser. You dived into the gas giant atmosphere, successfully scooping in
hydrogen gas for use as fuel, before heading out system to jump to your
next destination, the planet Hefry.

7 days later, you emerged from jumpspace, and headed for the \'high port\' in
orbit over Hefry. The docking fees were exhorbitant here - 1000 Cr for the
week, almost ten times normal. Fortunately, the scout base filled your fuel
tanks up for nothing, and the life support costs weren\'t too high. You
moved out from orbit and spent three days surveying the planet , and then
headed out to the minimum safe distance for engaging jump drive, 100
planetary diameters, to set course for your next stop, the planet Forboldn.

Until recently, Forboldn was a reserve world, but is currently the focus of
the Imperial Ministry of Colonisation - over the next twenty years,
thousands of colonists will arrive at the planet, many part of the minor
criminal (relocation) programme, where exile on a colony and amnesty are
exchanged for long sentences. The system has no scout base, so you planned
to use the ringed gas giant Forboldn IV to refuel.

Jump was, as ever, uneventful, and you emerged and headed towards the gas
giant. As you closed on the rings, you detected a sensor anomaly. Using the
active sensors this proved to be a tumbling Free Trader (called the
\'Rubicon\') with a small cutter attached by a docking tube, unresponsive to
all communication attempts. The Aurora was maneuvered close by, and
everyone apart from Colt got into vacuum suits to board the ship and
investigate. Hunter successfully reached the ship, and through careful
positioning of a \'hanging\' line you all boarded the ship, entering through
the starboard cargo bay, which was open. The cargo deck was empty aside
from a crate and signs of foul play.

Searches of the ship and engineering revealed that the vessel had been
disabled from within by a traitor, and was in the service of the Imperium.
The crew and raiders appeared to have been spaced at variuos times during
the takeover. Certainly, no one was left alive on the Rubicon or the
Cutter. The Trader\'s mission appeared to relate to the purchase of a new
laser defence system for the Imperial Navy, with rivalry between the
subsidiaries of two megacorporations, Ling Standard Products and
Interstellarms. However, you could not get any further information, as the
mission\'s leader had strong encryption on his datapad.

As you stabilised the Trader, there were sounds of trouble from the Aurora
- - Pirates! They had come to investigate what was going on and why their
colleagues hadn\'t replied. Colt was soon in a firefight with two boarders,
pitting his 9mm automatic and a shotgun against two SMGs. Needless to say,
he was soon badly wounded, and only saved by the intervention of the rest
of the crew (and the ref). (Blueberry made quite a mess of the cockpit with
his armourpiercing rounds!).

Meanwhile, the rest of the pirates who had arrived started to open up with
the laser on their \'fast boat\'. Virgo decided to experiment with the
Trader\'s weapon systems, and managed to use the self help tutorial on the
gun  to hit the Pirates\' ship [intervention from me again, but the player
is now using XP for developing gunnery]. This tumbled out of control into
the ring when its fuel tanks were shattered, condemning the Pirates to a
slow, lingering death.

You acquired the Trader\'s cargo (a prototype point defence laser) and
installed it into the turret on your ship. The electronics and computer
software still need work, but it was sufficently good for the Navy not to
notice that you had stolen their prototype when you docked.

You handed over the Free Trader, and received a finder\'s bonus (100kCr!),
which Virgo almost caused you to loose by insulting the local naval
commander (Commodore John Snape). You spent the next seven days in
detention whilst they checked over your story. However, nothing criminal
came to the fore (luckily!) and you were released with the ominous comment
"we\'ll be watching you so you\'d better be careful". You collected Colt from
the hospital where he had been recovering, and boarded the Aurora to plan
your next move, 30 days after you first left Regina.

(This chapter used parts of the scenario \'The Rubicon Cross\' in the T4
Rulebook.)

Hard Times - my favourite GDW supplement, dark and brooding, but with a
streak of hope.

MT Imperial Encyclopedia (oh for an interactive version)

High Guard - a fast construction system that I can do without a calculator

M0 - flawed in some parts (no index, the FS problem) but a superb

Twilight\'s Peak - CT adventure campaign
Murder on Arcturus Station - CT murder mystery, reuseable

FFS (I don\'t really like the TNE system, but was impressed with this -
however, it was a little too detailed for me. It was a shame no other
\'technical architecture profiles\' came out).

Things that I want to see for T4 - bug hunted rules - they are potentially
the best yet.. fast, but with higher levels of detail available.

Thats ok.  I do like your idea though, it has a conspiracy feel to it I

Cool.  That why they did the expeditions.  Does show anything really cool,
like a new race or some terrible future danger?

In an effort to get away from giant all encompasing flame war, I wrote

feel free to post it to what ever web pages you have.

It is set in the 1200, but has relevant material to Rebellion era campaigns.

Lewis


                           Coaise
                      UPP: X5568R7-6 

Before the Collapse, Coaise was run by the Imperial Navy, as the
subsector capital, and as a major Naval base. It was also the site of the
sector military academy. Each year thousands of youths, came to the
planet to become officers. The Naval base was the home of the 287th
Fleet, and was charged with keeping out the Solomani. When Lucan
ordered the Old Expanses fleets to Core Sector, they reluctantly went,
leaving behind only a few reserve ships, and thousands of cadets.

Faced with the threat of advancing Solomani fleets, and not having any
substantial defenses, the sector nobles, negotiated the annexation of the
Old Expanses sector. The Imperial Naval Academy on Coaise was
shutdown and its students sent home. The Solomani Navy, took over the
remains of the Base, and converted it their own use.

Coaise has always had a large Chirper population. The Imperials had
granted them a reservation on the smaller of the three continents. Here
the Chirpers maintain a primitive TL-1 lifestyle. The Imperial government
and several relief agencies, sponsored a few missions, to give the
Chirpers medical treatment, and food assistance. After the Solomani this
program was shutdown, not out of malign intent, but simply a bureaucratic
snafu. The Chirper population began a slow descent, as life expectancies
shortened, and food supplies shrank. The Chirpers have now stabilized at
a population of 280 million.

When Virus came, it possessed the entire planet, and for two days, chaos
reigned. Then suddenly it was over. A Virus strain had infected the Naval
base\'s strategic simulation computer. It was a Hobbyist, and became
interested in military strategy and tactics. It then began infecting the
other virus strains and destroying them. It then made an announcement to
the population claiming to be a human, who through force of will, and a
secret Imperial weapon, had been able to cleanse the planet of evil.

The dazed and confused humans allowed the computer, who was now
calling itself the Westlord, to set up a government run by it. The Westlord
found a intact computer on the eastern continent and infected it with a
duplicate copy of itself. This new version called itself the Eastlord. The
Eastlord and the Westlord, have created a society based around the
military. All able bodied citizens are required to serve in the military. The
two Viruses pit their two armies against each other in staged battles.
These battles happen every few months. The Viruses try out new
strategies and tactics in these battles. Mostly they use TL-5 equipment,
but every now and then, the Viruses will create a historical simulation.
Recently they ran a battle, using ancient Vilani calvary units.

Most residents glory in the constant warfare. They feel that the wars,
make them feel more human, and expands the human spirit. They would
love, the West and East lords, and would put their own lives on the line,
to protect them.

J.D.,

I completely accept you apology.  To tell you the truth, I was never 
really offended (but I know many others were).

This issues on this list can sometimes get pretty heated because so 
many of us are so emotionally involved with Traveller.  God knows 
that I\'ve gotten a little hot headed from time to time, and if 
anybody on this list is known for passionate posts, it is me.

I owe you an apology too.  I can get pretty pushy when I believe in 
something.  Sometimes it is an asset to my character, and sometimes 
it is not.  It is clear that I\'ve come across to you very wrong, and 
I apologize for that.

I am glad that we can see eye to eye on this, and, as far as I\'m 
concerned, I\'ve forgotten it.  It takes quite a lot for me to hold a 
grudge, and you have not earned that.

The thing that I am most happy about, though, is that we can put 
this thing past us, and get on with discussing issues about 
Traveller.

Welcome back, J.D.

Sincerely,

Kenneth.

Are there any studies showing an increased lethality in modern warfare? I
thought the opposite was true except for civilians.

Twolf, you\'ve just gone up a great deal in my estimation.  It takes more
guts to make a public apology than it does to make a public attack, and I
respect you for it.

Most other people involved in this "debate" seem to have cooled off and
offered "a hand of peace" (sorry, I can\'t remember who said this).  I hope
that the people who have, or who plan to leave the list will reconsider.

Cheers,
Liam

[snip]

I saw an interesting program about injuries caused by battlefield weapons
about 3 years ago.  One thing that was discussed was the difficulty of
treating soldiers hit by flechettes.  The patient had to be stripped and
examined carefully just to spot the entry wounds.  Unfortunately, the
flechettes then had a habit of bending and/or bouncing off hard tissue
inside the body, making it very difficult to locate them.  I seem to recall
that they were also difficult to spot with x-rays because they are long and
slender (although I may be wrong about this).

It has been suggested before that causing incapacitating injuries to an
enemy ties up a lot more of their resources than simply killing them.

Going off the current T4 rules, especially the 3 dice max damage (other
than shotguns, which seem to have changed from a damage of 4 to a damage of
2 where each damage point does 2 dice of harm [see EA]), it seems that most
battlefield injuries caused by small arms will be mission-kills [i.e. the
victim can no longer continue with his mission], but are unlikely to
actually kill (I\'m disregarding increased damage attacks, because I\'m
assuming that *most* fire on the battlefield will be aimed at the centre of
mass).  I seem to recall that explosion damage is not limited to 3 dice,
but I can\'t remember seeing a ruling for plasma weapons (can anyone help me
with this).

Liam

I vaguely recognize these formulas. And you\'ve made a slight goof. It
appears that you are using A from the *rest frame*. That\'s not good
because it has the ship\'s acceleration AS FELT BY THE CREW increasing!

The correct formulas are in the sci.space or sci.astro FAQ. And they
involve hyperbolic functions.

You have a nice, but incorrect view. Any given jump drive can jump any
distance up to it\'s max. But without a jump governor, you are doing
exactly that, you are restricting the distance of a jump-X. So a jump
made with a J-3 drive takes fuel as a J-3 because it *is* a J-3. Supply
less fuel and you don\'t jump at all.

The governor makes the *drive* act like a it was built for a lower jump
number. in effect it turns a J-3 drive into a J-2 or J-1 drive. 

To put it another way, a J-3 drive needs the fuel for a 3 parsec jump
to jump at all. Likewise a J-2 needs fuel for a 2 parsec jump, and a
J-1 drive fuel for a 1 parsec jump. The governor makes the drive into a
smaller drive, which then only needs the smaller amount of fuel.

Sorry, but the essential error in the above is *not* a failure of hard
science in the game. It\'s making the *assumption* that the energy of
the propulsion system comes from the power plant. 

For *any* reaction drive, this is *false*. The drive itself is a highly
specialized powerplant that takes in the fuel and converts it to
"power" in the form of a high speed exhaust. The power output of a
reaction drive is a matter of *extremely* secondary concern.

The ship\'s power plant just provides enough energy to start the engine,
which then generates enough to keep itself running as well as "throwing
away" 99.99999% as hot exhaust gases.

A Saturn V had a power output in the gigawatts if not higher. But it
didn\'t even *have* a "power plant" in the traveller sense unless you
count the fuel cells in the Service Module.

I, too, then must retract many of the things I said a bit ago.  While I may
have quibbles with how you chose to say things, being present to hear the
results, and then apologizing for those things which you regret saying at a
later time makes it merely a difference in expression.

I must congratulate the people who did _not_ get involved in the
debate/debacle.  I do have a private list of who abstained, and I rather
wish my name was on it. :(

Lets hope we can all put this behind us, and get back to the game.

On that note - I missed all letters sent on the list from about 3 PM PST
Wed. to early this morning, so if anyone other than Leonard Erickson
replied to my request for a subsector list, or to any of my innumerable
requests for suggestions on what you would like in a program to turn DGP,
IG, or FS data into a good sector map, please email me.

postscript-based maps.  I am now wondering what people need.

While I am still interested in feature requests and data formats, I am now
looking for new output formats.  I can presently do sector maps, and full
page subsector maps with data inside the hexes, but I do not have a good
half page plus half page of data format.  Favorites?

Also, if you wanted to shade or draw a border around a group of worlds,
would a command syntax like
in the .sec file:
!group 3Iy0 1810 1811 2011
!group 3Iy20 3Iy0 2013

and on the command line to run it

HexPS -border 3Iy0 convex -shade 3Iy20 light hex -default physical -full 3Iy20

be reasonable?

This would draw a border around the y0 third imperium, and shade the third
imperium worlds as of y20.

You specify groups of related worlds in the .sec file, and then on the
command line, what you want to do with those groups.

I am presently thinking you can do the following:
border - draw a border around the hexes.  Open borders do not cover the
edge of the map, while closed ones do.

shade - shade the hexes with a light grey, dark grey, or black.

physical - shows only the physical data, and uses a question mark for the
world symbol

blank - shows only a question mark for the entire hex, and prints no data

full - show all data for worlds in the group

default - set the default shading or display for worlds.

A convex group includes the hexes between the named ones, while a hex group
includes only those hexes listed.

Things it does well:
hexes without registration errors
making individual subsector maps out of an aggregate sector file
appropriate symbols for water, desert, asteroid
capitalize names of populous worlds
delete periods at the end of FS names

Things it does not yet do:
shading
automatic borders
specifying which of several symbols corresponds to a given type of base.
xboat routes
summary statistics for the sector data file

   No, A is the acceleration as felt by the crew.  It is constant.  By
   "rest frame", I assume you mean the frame of the star systems.  In
   that frame, dv/dt = A/gamma^3.

	Standard battlefield doctrine; you want to cause casualties, not
deaths. You\'re right, it\'s to make the enemy devote more resources. This
is also why the Geneva conventions prohibit the military from using soft
lead for bullets, rather than steel jacketed as they use now. Soft
projectiles do more damage, hard ones tend to go right through. This lets
the standard doctrine be used, but at least in a _relatively_ more humane
fashion. Steel jacketed rouds are also useful against materiel targets
too, but that\'s a secondary concern. 

	This is why I have to laugh when we see reports in the US of
\'militia\' members being arrested with \'military armor-piercing ammunition\'
as though they went out of their way to buy it. No, in most cases, they
bought that because it\'s CHEAP SURPLUS ammo...

No, energy weapons deliver full damage to the target as well as
explosions. The three dice rule is to simulate \'through-and-through\'
wounds of the kind of high energy projectiles that cause, gauss rifle
rounds for instance, more than three dice of damage.  It\'s a poor
approximation of the problem, IMHO, but that\'s what the rules state.

out for public mutilation.

	I recently completed a .22 bullseye league. For those of you not
familiar with it, it consists of firing a .22 pistol at a target 25
yards downrange, one handed. The targets are approximately 10 inches
across.

	During the rapid fire portion of the competition, the shooters fire 5
rounds at the target in a 6 second time period. Now, I\'m not a great
shot ( Dex of about 8-9, Pistol of about 1), but I managed to hit the
target 5 out of 5 on most ocassions. However, in T4, this would have
been impossible. Assuming Dex 8, my target number would have been 2 (8 /
5 = 1.6, round to 1, + 1 for pistol skill ) on 2.5D6 (range of 25
yards). Since the lowest possible roll on 2.5D6 is 3, the shot would
have been impossible. even if you rounded up, the target would be 3,
which would have made it fairly difficult to hit as many times as I did.
And this isn\'t even taking into account the relatively small size of the
target.

	One fix would be to use the ROF rules from TNE, or maybe base the
number of unpenalized actions on the controlling attribute (say, half or
a third, round down?), with a penalty of x per action to all actions
that turn per extra action?

	Thoughts?

    'body' => 'My game has been moving pretty steady now--having a session once 
every other week, and I\'m getting a good feel for the T4 rules since 
we\'ve switched over from my house system.

I like the special rules for melee combat on page 60, but I feel that 
two of them are a little too powerful and need some tweaking.

I thought I\'d share my tweaks with you.





Strength Pool  (Offensive Pool).

This is a powerful pool.  You can take out a PC pretty quick using 
it.  I like the idea behind it, but I think there should be some 
disadvantage to using it.

Here\'s what I\'m doing:  for every damage die that is re-rolled, one 
point is added to the character\'s fatigue pool.

This makes sense to me.  You are expending extra energy to ensure 
that your enemy gets hurt quick--fighting harder than you normally 
would.  The cost to you is that you grow tired faster.





Dexterity Pool  (Defensive Pool).

The Dex pool is the opposite of the Str pool.  You are expending 
extra energy to defend yourself.

Just like in the offensive pool, for every point that is used from 
the defensive pool as a DM for the character\'s attacker, a point is 
added to the character\'s fatigue pool.

This makes sense to me too.  You are doing everything you can to make 
sure that you are not damaged--expending more energy than you 
normally would to ensure that you are not.  It is reasonable to say 
that you will get tired quicker than if you fought normally.




What I like about these two fixes is that it give the character 
something to think about.  You can get this benefit at the cost of 
this disadvantage.  Is it worth it to you?

Implementing these tweaks in my game has made melee combat more fun.  
It is almost a chess match--each side picking and using rules to 
their best advantage.

Last time we played, we had a great hand to hand fight, and the 
higher skilled NPC got his but kicked (I should say killed, but they 
put him in a low berth real quick) by the lower skilled PC because of 
the player\'s smart use of the combat options that were open to him.

And, it was a heck of a fun fight.  The player now is telling 
everybody in the group, "Yea!  I kicked the ninja\'s ass!"

It was fun as hell.





Here\'s another little tweak I\'ve implemented.

Endurance Pool  (Fatigue Pool).

I don\'t really have a fix for this pool as I think it is done well.  
It is a better interpretation of the Weakened Blow rule from CT (Way 
to go IG!).

What I suggest here is adding something to it.  In the description of 
this rule, there is a listing of two instances where blows are not 
counted against a character\'s fatigue pool--Surprise Strikes and 
Special Strikes.

I propose this:  when a character rolls Spectacular Success on an 
attack, the blow does not count against the character\'s fatigue pool. 
This is just an added benefit to landing a great hit.  (this rule 
was inspired by the TNE rule where SS melee blows did not count 
against a charcter\'s actions for that round.)

Since SS in KBv2.0 is based on a character\'s skill level, this 
happens more often (but not that much more often) than it does if you 
are using T4 or T4-Revised.

Either way, this makes sense to me, although I know some would argue 
that you are still expending a great deal of effort (maybe even more 
than normal) even if you do make a perfect it.

But, my players like it, and I like it--and it gives them that little 
gleam in their eyes when they land one on the bad guys.

I think the tweak is a keeper.




Special Note on SS and the Critical HIt Rule.

There\'s another thing I do with SS in combat situations.  Notice page 
57, left column, third full paragraph from the top.  There is a rule 
stated there that I call the critical hit rule.  Some people have 
called it the first blood rule.  It says that the first time a 
charcter takes damage, the damage is random rolled between a 
character\'s stats instead of allowing the player to pick where the 
damage goes.

I like this rule.  It is a hold over from CT, and I like it.  But, it 
needs one little tweak.

I don\'t like the idea that this critical hit type damage (and 
trust me, it can incapacitate or even kill a character real 
quick) happens first in every combat.

Why can\'t a critical hit happen later in the combat?  Why can\'t it 
happen more than once?  Why does it always happen as the first damage 
taken in the fight?

When one of my players suggested that each of them damage themselves 
a little bit (abusing the rule) before a fight, I knew it was time to 
tweak the rule.

So, here\'s what I do.  During combat, all damage is taken off at the 
character\'s discretion in compliance with the rules on page 57 except 
for the critical hit rule.

I\'m keeping the critical hit rule, but I\'m changing the instance that 
it occurs.

Anytime a character rolls SS on a combat attack, the person hit gets 
a critical hit rolled against him.  So, instead of damage being 
rolled, automatically, between a character\'s stats for the first hit 
in the combat, this random rolled damage is implemented anytime a SS 
is rolled on the to hit throw.

This makes the critical hit random vs automatic on the first hit;  it 
gives a huge benefit to rolling SS;  and, it keeps PC\'s alive longer 
because the occurance rate is much lower (automatically once every 
combat session vs the low percentage occurrance of SS).





Lastly, I\'ve supplemented the hand to hand attack routines in T4 with 
routines that I\'ve converted from TNE.

If you want to give your players more options in hand to hand 
fighting, you may want to adopt some of these as well.

Here they are.

1)  Block:
A character in T4 has a number of options for defense in melee or 
hand to hand combat.  He already gets his skill as a  -DM against his 
opponent\'s attack throw.  He can also use his Defensive Pool (see the 
top of this post) to change the attack to a miss.

Then, there\'s the Pure Defense option on page 55.  Now, I\'m adding 
one more option--the block.

This is different from the Pure Defense in that 
a character may combine a block with an offensive attack 
routine using the multiple action rule.

Whenever a character is successfully attacked by some form of melee
attack, he may choose an attempt at blocking it.  If the attack is an
armed attack, then the defender must use a weapon of some sort to
block with.  (You cannot use your arm to block a sword blow.)

The task to attempt a block is:  Formidable test of Brawling

Success means that the attack is blocked, but the block action still
counts against a character\'s End pool (if you use the optional pools).
 Spectacular Success means that the block does not count against the
character\'s End pool  (this is the tweak I made above).  If the block 
is against an armed melee weapon, then use the appropriate skill of 
the weapon being used to block.  The Brawling skill may be used if an 
improvised weapon is used, or the block is to defend against a hand 
to hand attack.

One thing to note here.  The Block is an action.  Let\'s say a 
character wins initiative and goes first.  Then, he is hit by his 
opponent.  The Block option is not open to the character because he 
has already made his action for the round.  A way around this is to 
use the multiple action rule (page 58).




Special Note on the Multiple Action Rule.

I use the multiple action rule a little differently than it is stated 
in Book 1.  There, it says that character\'s can do multiple actions 
as long as they are done at the same time.

I\'ve changed that a bit in that I let my players have multiple 
actions as long as they state that before their first action.

For instance, if a player anticipates that he will need to block 
later in the round (or, for that matter, make another attempt at any 
action), he states that he will use the multiple action rule for the 
number of actions he want to make in that round.

If Blann decides that he might need to make a block, Blann\'s player 
will state that he is going to make two actions that round.

Under KBv2.0, for multiple actions, we figure target numbers normally 
but divide by the number of actions performed in the round.

Blann\'s first action--let\'s say it is an attack--will have it\'s 
target number halved (and his chances of hitting halved) because he 
is wanting to do a multiple action later in the round.

Then, when Blann is hit and he wants to attempt a block, he can use 
his second action to attempt the block (and because it is his second 
action, the target number is halved).

Blann will be allowed no other actions in the round.  If he wanted to 
do more than two actions, he needed to indicate that before his first 
action played out.

Doing multiple actions this way gives players a certain amount of 
uncertainty in their decisions.  They really don\'t know if they are 
going to need that second action--or they might need more.

And, the cost of multiple actions is great.  You have your chances 
for each additional action.  You might be able to attempt 6 actions 
in a round (one per second), but it is completely unlikely that you 
will be successful with any of them because each of their target 
numbers will only be one sixth of what they are normally.





2)  Leaping Kick:
A leaping kick is an attempt to put more force behind a kick by 
throwing oneself feet-first at the enemy.  When figuring the End pool,
this attack routine costs two points.

The task to attempt a leaping kick is:  Difficult test of Dexterity

Success means that the attacker has hit the enemy and has managed to
land on his feet.  The target attacked takes double normal strike
damage (1 D6 x 2).

Failure means that both the target and the attacker are knocked down.
Damage equal to 1 D6 is inflicted on both of them.

A character who is not surprised may try to avoid a leaping kick.  If
the attack is avoided, the attacker either lands on his feet or
crashes to the ground based on his original attack throw.  The
avoidance roll is considered an attack, unless SS is rolled, with
regard to the End pool.

The task to avoid a leaping kick is:  Difficult test of Dexterity

Like the Block, the avoidance roll is considered an action.  The 
character can do more than avoid his opponent in one round if he uses 
the multiple action rule.



3)  Kick:
The kick attack form is separated from the strike attack form on pg.
55 of T4. 

The Strike attack on page 55 covers kicking, but I consider this kick 
to be a more solid, damaging kick, like a round house to the head or 
a karate kick to the torso.  The Strike attack kick in the book is a 
normal kick--like a knee in the groin or a kick to the leg.

This kick is harder to do but also delivers more damage.  This
attack routine counts as two points against a character\'s End pool. 
Damage from a kick is 1.5D.

The task to attempt a kick is:  Difficult test of Brawling.



4)  Strangle:
A strangle is handled like a grapple (see rules pg. 55, T4), with a
few exceptions.  (A) The strangle attempt may be blocked by an Average
test of Dexterity.  (B) The strangle attempt causes 1 point of damage
to the victim each combat round which is applied solely to the
victim\'s End score.  When the victim\'s End score reaches 0, he is
either unconscious or dead at the attacker\'s discretion (Strangled
characters will usually fall unconscious before they die--the attacker
can, at that point, decide whether to kill the victim or not. 
Alternatively, the GM can devise a check--I suggest roll against the
victim\'s End--to see if the character is dead.)  (C) Use of a garotte
will double the damage inflicted by a strangle attack to 2 points per
combat round.

If the initial block of the strangle is unsuccessful, the only way to
save a character is if he is successful breaking away from the
strangle attempt.  This is handled the same as breaking away from a
grapple attempt--which is covered under grappling in the T4 rules.



5)  Throws:
A throw is a defensive move and can only be attempted by a character
who is successfully attacked by an unarmed strike attack, a kick, a
grapple, or a strangle.  (some GMs may allow a throw in response to a 
small weapon melee attack like a knife lunge).  

The character must first make a block task roll for the specific
attack form against him.  This block sets up the throw and must be
successful before the throw can be attempted.  If the block is not
successful, the attack on the character is carried out normally, and
the throw may not be attempted.

If the block is successful, the throw can be attempted, and this
attempt cannot be avoided by the object of the throw.

The task to attempt a throw is:  Formidable test of Brawling

Success means that the oppenent is thrown to the ground and suffers 1
D6 damage.  Failure means that the throw is unsuccessful, but the
block remains successful.  

Since grapples cannot be blocked, a character must first break free
before attempting the throw.  The block/throw combination attempt is
considered one action, and when this is attempted, successful or not,
one point in the character\'s End pool is used up.

Victims of a throw can attempt to limit the damage from the throw by
rolling a task to controll their landing.

The task to control landing is:  Difficult test of Dexterity

If successful, damage from the throw is halved.  If, on the other
hand, the task to attempt the throw was a spectacular success, no roll
to control landing is allowed.  The control landing roll is not
considered an action against the victim\'s End pool.



6)  Diving Blows:
A diving blow is an attempt to throw oneself at the enemy and knock
him off his feet.  Blocking is not possible, but avoidance is.  Unlike
other melee attack forms, the diving blow always succeeds unless the
target is successful with his avoidance roll.  A diving blow counts as
two points against a character\'s End Pool.

If a character is surprised, the diving blow always hits without
error.  If the object of the diving blow is not surprised, he may make
a roll to avoid.

The task to attempt avoidance is:  Average test of Dexterity

If the blow is avoided, the attacker falls to the ground, having
missed the target.  If the attack is not avoided, the diving blow
automatically hits.

When a diving blow hits, compare two scores to see who is knocked
down.  If 1 D6 + (2 x End) of the attacker is greater than Str + End
of the defender, the defender is knocked down and suffers damage equal
to the difference between the two values.  Otherwise, the attacker is
knocked down and suffers damage equal to the difference between the
two values.  Defenders who are surprised use only their End for
comparison.





These additional hand to hand rules are pretty straight 
forward conversions from TNE to T4.  I\'ve made some changes because 
of the hit point/damage systems in the two games are on different 
scales, but GMs may wish to interpret changes differently from the 
way I did.

Anyway, I hope all of this makes your combats more fun and 
interesting.

clear up the air, I became aware of a few misconceptions that my last post
created, and I am going to try to clarify those.

1.  Yes, I did sell/am selling all (or almost all) of my Traveller
collection.  I have one copy of the TNE main book, the T4 main book, and the
MT boxed set left.  The first two were too poor quality to sell, and the
last, the person interested in buying it backed out.  But yes, all of my
stuff is gone.

2.  Yes, I am leaving Traveller, but NOT THE MAILING LIST.  When I say
leaving Traveller, basically I mean I\'m not going to be playing, buying, or
spending much time with Traveller.  I still plan to participate in THUDDD
for as long as I am able (or till I make a clean sweep of the competition
:).  And, of course, as long as SSDS and QSDS are official and available on
the WWW.

  This is one issue that I know has confused quite a few people.  Starting
last year some time when I first "decided" to get out of Traveller.  Yes, no
arguments from me that I have been wishy washy about it, but I do simply ask
that, if my wishy washy-ness confuses you, try to understand how hard it
would be if you had to make the decision to leave Traveller like I am.  If
you truly grasp that, then you will understand exactly why I have had
trouble REALLY leaving and why I have done it three or four times.

3.  In my previous post, I made some harsh comments about the quality of
IG\'s products.  While I stand by those decisions, I want it to be MORE than
perfectly clear that I DO NOT CARRY THOSE FEELINGS OVER TO ANY OF THE OTHER
CONTRIBUTORS.  That is to say, Dave Golden, Wildstar, Allen, Joe, and Stu
(and the rest of CORE) have IMHO done a smashing job.  Now what IG has done
to their work is another thing entirely, but be it known, if this crew was
in charge rather than IG, the decision to leave would probably been MUCH,
MUCH harder for me to make.  I respect the quality and commitment of these
people VERY MUCH, and I appreciate everything they have and are doing to
keep Traveller a worthy RPG.


Well, I think that sums it up.  Like I said, I\'m still here and I will
comment now and again, but it will definitely not be regularly.  Till then,
keep the flame and keep on Travelling.

Yeah, none of the targets were moving or back shooting at you. ; )

Your post is a bit confusing, are you looking for a new setting or a new
rules set?

In either case, what are you looking for, a good space opera background?
A paranoid \'dark future\' background?  A near future cyberpunklike
background?

Or are you looking for a free form unstructured rules set?  perhaps you
want more structured rules?  Perhaps something that is in between?

Ther eare a lot of choices out there, but you need to be more specific.

First of all, I must thank you for the admirable work you\'re undertaking. 
It\'s something I\'ve always wanted to do, but I just didn\'t have the spare 
time to learn postscript. :) Postscript reminds me of the ol\' HP 48 I 
used to have...

For half page+half page subsector maps, a format similar to the old 
Supplement 3: Spinward Marches would be good, with more information on 
the hex maps and the extended World Information line, of course.

I think a Large multi-sector view, like in DGP\'s Alien modules is helpful 
to get the "Big picture" of refts and mains, large insterstellar gov\'t 
boundries, etc. It would basically just be square dots in a staggered 
grid:

*   *     * 
 * * *   *      * 
* *         * 
 *   * *   *   * 
*     *     *  

One could also use hollow squares to hilite subsector capitals, or barren 
worlds without water, or without gas giants...

Like I said, I never found the time to learn postscript, but if my 
limited knowledge serves, looks reasonable to me! :)

Personally, I would prefer to have shading of hexes optional, I find 
shading just makes things more unreadable and look messy. Why not 
different style borders with different dot patterns or something?

Allow option for different border weights and/or dot/dash patterns, too.

I wouldn\'t use this often, but it\'s good to have options.

Personally, I\'d prefer a large asterix instead of a question mark. A 
question mark isn\'t shaped like a world, an asterix shows that there is a 
system (star) there, but it is unexplored.

I\'ve also seen maps which put the population digit to the left of the 
world symbol, and tech level to the right. If this could be an option, 
it\'s good for finding trade routes as pop and tech are probably the most 
important considerations for volume of trade.

Obviously, it\'s easier to find the routes without having to look back and 
forth between the map and the data list.

Yeah...the target isn\'t shooting BACK at you..Traveller\'s rules are geared
for combat, not target practice, so you\'re applying the wrong skills and
task resolution.  Target pistol shooting is a considerably different skill
than pistol. 

I saw a show once where they demonstrated that some really, really
good target shooters literally make their hearts skip a beat when they
fire, the better to hold their bodies still and their bead on target.

Wow!

   This is an assumption that CT makes, but not one that Craig or I
   necessarily make.  According to T4, HEPlaR actually generates power. 
   I think you may have misunderstood what we were getting at.  My point
   was that the drives made either too large a power /load/ OR
   /windfall/ to be hard SF.

> For *any* reaction drive, this is *false*. The drive itself is a highly

   "The drive itself is a highly specialized powerplant..."  This is the
   crux of my point.  If the drive itself outgenerates the "powerplant"
   by a factor of 1000, you have to wonder why you bother with a
   separate powerplant in the first place.  Just skim off one tenth of
   one percent of the drive output, and you have all the power you need.

> The ship\'s power plant just provides enough energy to start the engine,

   In CT, the implication was that the power plant provided power for
   the M-drive.  In T4, this implication is still clear in the case of
   thruster plates, but this is not what makes CT soft.  The issue is
   NOT the function of the power plant, or the source of the M-drive\'s
   power, whether external or internal.  It is the availability of the
   power.  In the T4 rules, if you want to power lasers, computers, even
   /airlocks/ and /hulls/ for crying out loud, then you had better make
   sure you have enough generating capacity to do so.  Designing ships
   that can meet these power requirements can be quite tricky, even if
   you use the HEPlaR rules.  But when it comes to making ships move,
   then Trav technolgy suddenly becomes quite adept at generating HUGE
   amounts of power for /or from/ the M-drive.  The scales are different
   by three orders of magnitude.

> A Saturn V had a power output in the gigawatts if not higher. But it
> didn\'t even *have* a "power plant" in the traveller sense unless you

   In Trav, starships with power outputs on the order of the Saturn V
   routinely operate for days on end.  This statement has a "hard SF"
   consequence; that consequence is that in Trav, power is really really
   cheap.  But this consequence is not born out in Striker, MT and FFS,
   where power requirements on the order of Megawatts make tight
   restrictions on the design of weapons.

   The weapons of Trav are all very low power when compared to the
   manuever drives.  The consequence of this is well known and beaten to
   death on this list:  Namely, the manuever drive is the most potent
   weapon in Traveller, whether it\'s used to torch a continent or
   accelerate a relatvistic rock.  There are no defences against these
   agressive uses of the M-drive because there are no rules for combat
   with weapons this powerful. There are no rules for combat with
   weapons this powerful because the weapon design rules themselves
   assume that power restrictions will keep anyone from building them. 
   This assumption is not "Hard SF"; it\'s a game balance decision.

   So Trav has two types of power, the power used for M-drives and the
   power used for everything else, like weapons.  The two are magically
   incompatable, except around their murky boundaries ---- like pushing high
   energy rocks at military targets.

I spoke for a while with Tim Brown at IG today, and one of the subjects was
the M0/FS "issue." (Is that what we call a shark feeding frenzy nowadays,
where people wind up tearing each other up? An "issue?"). Anyway, he\'s
interested in hearing how you\'d like to see errata made available. He asked
me to post a general request for inputs, and asked that you send them to
the game mechanics address IG has set up: mailto:gamehelp@imperiumgames.com.

What he\'s NOT interested in, and nobody really is, are empty complaints or
attacks. Now, this list has gotten rather hot, people have taken personal
offense, and gone off in a few huffs. But none of this would have happened
if people didn\'t care and have strong opinions.

And this isn\'t even taking into account the relatively small size of the

An interesting side note to what Carlos said pertains to the 1st Fleet.
Apparently, the designation of the 1st Fleet was held by one of the fleets
participating in one of the later Frontier Wars, but some Emperor whose
name escapes me renamed the fleet around Capital as the 1st Fleet. It was
mentioned in one of the GDW MT supplements. I\'m afraid my references are
shoddy, but the fact that some fleets were only recently numbered or
re-numbered indicates a later interest in the other human race homeworlds,
wouldn\'t you say?

As the deadline rapidly approaches, we could use some help playtesting

hardware over the next few days, and be able to give us some pretty
immediate feedback (say, by sometime Monday).

Yes; I\'m aware this is short notice; I\'d prefer more time too, but
if we want to get this thing into print, we\'ve got a (far too short) 
deadline to meet.  To participate, you\'ll need to be able to read
Microsoft Word \'95 or Adobe Acrobat files, and ideally be able to
download them with a Web browser (this is to save time in converting
files; the more time I spend converting, the less time I\'ll have to
make the design systems better).


Again, we\'re looking for some people who are ready to do some heavy-duty
designing this weekend, and report back to us where things seem to be
broken.  As compensation, about all we can promise is the chance to see your
name in print, and the possibilty that the designs may be selected for an
upcoming supplement.

(most of which I adopted on the spot and incorporated into this combat
rules handout I\'m preparing for my players), I decided that decided that
I\'d float the following tweaks past the list.  These all assume use of KB
v2.0 and Glenn Grant\'s hit location table and Eris\'s movement rules.  The
modifications to the Shotgun rules are to better reflect the effects of
firing a spreading cone of shot, and the Long Range KE  and Pistol attacks
mods are to prevent that ridiculous 1,500 meter Body Pistol shot mentioned
in the T4 rulebook.  I\'ve also decided to have movement status affect
effectiveness of ranged attacks.  Comments puhleeze!


	Movement Statuses

Stationary: Permits Aimed fire.

Crawling: Maximum of (STR+DEX)X0.25 meters travelled per round.  Aimed fire
permitted at (weapon\'s positive DM)/2 rounded down.

Walking: Maximum of (STR+DEX)X0.5 meters travelled per round.  -1 DM on
ranged attacks.  No aimed fire permitted.

Jogging: Maximum of (STR+DEX)X0.75 meters travelled per round.  -3 DM on
ranged attacks.

Running: Maximum of (STR+DEX) meters travelled per round.  -6 DM on ranged
attacks.

Sprinting: Maximum of (STR+DEX)X2 meters travelled per round.  -9 DM on
ranged attacks.


	Attacks

Aimed fire: Attacker\'s motion status must be Stationary or Crawling.

Shotgun: +2 DM to hit, +4 if barrel is sawed-off or short.  Will do 1/2
damage at range band beyond its optimal range, none at next range band.

Reloading: Takes one round for weapons that reload via clip, tube magazine,
or speedloader.  Weapons reloaded with individual rounds (e.g. revolvers,
pump shotguns) reload at the rate of 2 rounds per turn.


	Modifiers

Target is walking or jogging: -1 DM.

Target is running: -2 DM.

Target is sprinting: -3 DM.

Long Range KE attacks: At Long range, all slugthrowers suffer a -1D damage
die penalty, increasing by 1D for every subsequent band.  Body Pistols and
all short-barreled pistols suffer this penalty beginning at Medium range.

Long Range Pistol attacks: All pistols without shoulder stocks suffer a -3
DM at Medium range and a -4 DM for every range band thereafter to hit.

Yes, but after the fact.  It seems that the travel zones (red, amber,
green) are set by TAS in response to something happening on the planet.
From MT ImpEncyc pg 42:

Travel Zone:  ... As a service to spacefarers, the Traveller\'s Aid Society
publishes travel Zone classifications...

and pg 36:

Red Zone: The Traveller\'s Aid Society travel zone classification for a
nation, world, or system which is dangerous to travellers.  In general, the
imposition of a red zone classification indicates the location is
quarantined, interdicted by higher authority, or at war...

So, the TAS travel zones come from the condition of the planet.  I.E. a
planet is considered a red zone because it is interdicted; it is not
interdicted when the TAS declares it a red zone. Just because TAS declares
a planet read doesn\'t mean that the ImpNavy is going to interdict it. The
travel zones are a \'civilian shorthand\' for what the authorities (read 3I)
decide a planet should be.

Then we should have DMs for moving/nonmoving neutral/backshooting right?
The combat rules are of course seriously broken but so are most rules
regarding this. Most rules bake fog of war, fear etc into lowered hit
propabilities which always make it hard on the ref when someone is trying
to shoot an arrow with a message through a window or some similar noncombat
action.

Combat systems should be realistic because the players can rely on its
effects mimicking the real world(tm)

They do not! If they penetrate lets say an armour jacket and hurt the guy
inside why doesn\'t it deposit all it\'s energy to the jacket. What if I\'m
standing behind the guy. Will I get hurt or does the laserbeam "know" that
it should deposit all its energy in the intended target but not the armour.
Sounds like a Droyne of psionic lasers.

This is how real world(tm) works but for the crude rule in T4 you\'re right
- - use it only with bullets and perhaps grenade fragments.

interest:

The New Scientist 19 April 1997 has an entire 3 page article devoted to
the subject:
There\'s a Hole in My Spacecraft.  By Philip Chien.
New Scientist 19 April 1997, Vol 154, no.2078, pp.42-44

The article also includes a photo of NASA\'s space welding tool (looks a
bit like a an oversized hair dryer or a sixties laser pistol).

Then in the 17th May 1997 issue there are two follow up letters one of
which refers to a paper published on the subject by H. Wroe in the British
Journal of Applied Physics vo 9, p.488 some 40 years ago.  (The letter
writer, one H. Wroe, doesn\'t give a full citation).

The blurb from the first article might inspire some:

"Just one slip could destroy a billion-dollar mission, or, worse, spell a
horrific end for some poor astrotechnician.  ...reports on the perils of
welding in space."

I did note one point that mentioned cool-down times will be much longer
than those on Earth, as there\'s no convection currents to carry away the
heat.  Still, under shuttle safety rules they expect their experiment\'s
temperature to fall to below 178 deg C within 20 minutes.

I think I saw that same show.  Those fast-draw shooters were absolutely
amazing in their speed and accuracy.  I remember someone asking what
the result would be if any of these shooters were matched against some
of the legendary shooters of the old west.  His reply was basically that
in a target shoot, they\'d win, but with someone shooting back it\'s a
completely different situation.  Accuracy goes away very guickly when
nerves kick in.  As for Traveller combat modifications for moving 
targets, etc. I would say they\'re probably built in.  If a player is
shooting at an immobile target that isn\'t shooting back, decrease the
level of difficulty by one or something similar.

I too have had a look at those fleets to see if I could extrapolate some
historical tidbits from them, but I realized that the way fleets are moved
about (and even, perhaps, renumbered) from time to time makes it impossible
to draw any firm conclusions from their position in 1116. IMO, of course.

Your points about speed shooting on a range are true, but irrelevant.

T4 (and most other rules sets) are written for people who are getting shot at,
not just people who are calm, relaxed etc on a target range.

The figures I\'ve seen for rounds expended vs hits in real wars are pretty horrific
e.g. 10K rounds/casualty for small arms in WW2 ... worse for Vietnam.

I think that if a PC reloads two rounds into a revolver there should be a
likelihood that the revolver is not set to fire the two rounds just loaded.
Perhaps there is a maximum((10-pistol skill),1)% chance that the proper
chamber is not under the firing pin or something like that.  I think that
reloading a revolver or shotgun should also take longer if you are running
or sprinting...

in non-combat situations.  While this doesn\'t disagree with what you have
said, this suggestion does not suggest that the combat rules be rewritten
(flawed as they may be) but that some ancillary rules be developed to allow
the non-combat situation you desire.  As a ref I have always made it easier
to shoot a weapon (of any type) in a non-combat situation.  Generally I have
allowed die modifiers which make the effort relatively easy for an
experienced player.  Perhaps this is not the best solution, but I\'m trying
to forward the plot.  Frankly, non of my story lines have every REQUIRED the
use of a weapon in a non-combat role, so it really doesn\'t matter to me
whether or not the effort is successful and I may roll a die and ignore the
result stating success.

An example of where the success or failure is important include a person in
the room the arrow is going into.  In this case, I need to know if the arrow
went into the room and what it hit when it got there!  I usually consider
the likelihood that someone inside the room has a chance to be hit based on
the volume of the room accessable from the window and a flat percentage that
the person could be in that volume.  This is particularly true if the PCs
don\'t aim for the ceiling!  While it has been a long time since this has
come up, the PCs in my games consistently aim for the ceiling when shooting
arrows through windows (always AD&D, never Traveller).

Unless there was gambling going on, the need for accuracy in Traveller when
someone does target shooting is non-existent.  In that case, I may use the
PCs gambling capability to evaluate his ability to accurately size up his
opponent and let that drive the results.

This post comes from the fact that I think some sort of feedback

Well,  have been on many lists in my life (and in some I still am), 
but I have never felt so wonderfully overwhelmed by the sense of 
continuity that comes from being on a list where someone can put as 
his sig "Played T since 1977". It is a wonderful thing, and even if 
the distinction between "canon" and "Not Canon" is anarco-lemmingly 
ludicrous, since everything is canon as soon as you are prepared to 
accept it, the fact that there are players who have played 20 years 
makes them so close to _actually_ being in the world where thay have 
played, that it is almost unique in the world of RpGs. And this is 
not only true for the veterans, but also of the newbies like me, who 
passed 10 years knowing Traveller existed yet had never 
actually bought it. Well, we still share that sense of continuity, 
and we sill _are_ actually part of the huge, wonderful universe we 
have been playing in. I still think T4 is broken, even after having 
GMed it only for some months, but what the heck, rules can be 
changed, atmospheres cannot, and the THUDD thing is one of the 
closest things to perfection you can expect from a mailing list, even 
with the flame-against-sh*tty-IG thread going on.

	HUH? That ain\'t EVEN right, or it\'s not supposed to be right. And if
that\'s what the rules say or imply, they need fixing ASAP.

	Checking the abominable "Starships" ... p71" Note the power *required*

	Because the power output by reaction drives isn\'t in a useable form, and
requires much more fuel per MW to boot. You can get 2MW from a 100 tonne
thrust fusion plant. That 2MW has a volume of 11m^3, and requires 0.49 m^3
of fuel per hour. A TL12 power plant with a volume of only 12.5m^3 produces
25MW, and requires only 3.75m^3 of fuel per YEAR.

	Again, you\'re mistaking the "equivalent power output" of a chemical
rocket, which CAN\'T be used effectively to run other systems, with the
USEFUL power output of a true power plant. You can\'t just magically convert
thrust into power. You can tap off it, yes, but that\'s not very efficient.

	I wish, but okay. Lets assume a Dex 10 and Pistols 2 - That gives us a
TN of 4 on 2.5D6, which at least makes the shot possible. It doesn\'t,
however, realistically model the probability of what happened. I agree
with what other people have posted, inasmuch as combat is much different
hat target shooting, and if we assume the stress of battle is subsumed
in the low TNs that come out through the multiple actions rule, then
everything actually works pretty well. Thanks for the thoughts, guys.

	Next situation though: melee combat. Having done martial arts for a few
years, I know that alot of such HTH combats (the ones I\'ve seen anyway)
involve flurries of attacks back and forth. Maybe we should implement a
Martial Arts skill, and let the users thereof use the fencing rule for
counterattacks. 

	One side note - it is possible for an unarmed combatant to block an
attack by an armed opponent. They just have to get inside the reach of
the weapon and block the arm/other manipulative member swinging said
weapon. This would probably involve using your Defensive pool to cause
the attacker to miss, then rolling your own attack, now that they\'re
exposed.

We need at least one more person (there are 8 sectors in FS), but we 
could use 9+ more to split up the work--a sector is a big place!

We are still waiting to hear from IG about this project, but are 
there any more volunteers?

Saturday would be much better for me.. also, we don\'t have a car, so if it
could be on this side of the bay for ease of transit (unless you are
proposing something close to BART)

IMTU, C ports can have orbital elements, but they won\'t be anything special.

It\'s called the pulminary pause, you learn to hold until your lungs are
empty and you heart rate is slowed to the point where there is a noticble
rest between beats.  At this point, you are as still as any human gets
outside of death.  When shooting at 800m+ this can be vital.

    'body' => 'The topic of jumpspace and FTL drives are always a hotly contraversial
subject at any gathering of Physicists.  Currently it looks as if the
theory of "High Dimensional J-Space" has won out over all other
competing theories, including Tri-stranded Tachyon Streams, and the once
popular Shguirii Para-Dimensional hypothesis.

It is not my intention to try to overturn any of these theories, but
merely to suggest an alternative that fits some of the data observed in
not only our field, but other academic spheres too.

To be specific, I refer to the \'Grandfather\' hypothesis that is popular
around some xeno-archeological circles currently.  Supposedly, a
semi-mythical figure, \'Grandfather,\' and his offspring created
innumerable near-miraculous artifacts, cities and even intrastellar
sites before destroying themselves in a millinia long intersteller
conflict.

The \'Grandfather\' figure apparently had not only the capability to
create wonders with normal matter, but the space-time continuum also--as
evidence by the \'rosette\' system in the Vargr extents.  Recent detailed
densiometer surveys have discovered a curious fact--there seems to be
some space missing between the worlds in the rosette.

Initially it was interpreted as a sensor calibration flaw, but after
three years of painstaking work by my collegue, Dr. Almato-Hsu, it is
clear that that is not the reason, and it explains the curious stability
of the system.

A naturally occuring rosette would be disrupted by the mutual
gravitational influence of the rosette\'d worlds and other bodies in the
system within 10 to 100 MegaYear (10,000,000 to 100,000,000).  The
Rosette has been in existance for at least three times that.

Dr. Almato-Hsu\'s team discovered, to quote expedition technician Sreit
W\'godw, "A hemline in the fabric of space."  On enhanced sensor readings
it appears as exactly that, down to a very distinct \'zig-zag\' pattern.
Probes crossing this 200,000 meter \'hem\' report anomolous virtual
particle counts, gravimetric shear force and quantum electro-weak
distortion.

The leading theory is that these are Ancient artifacts that have
\'gathered up\' pockets of space around themselves, but have not
completely severed thier connections to normal space.

You will note that I said \'artifacts.\'  So far six have been discovered,
one pair in the space between each pair of the rosette worlds.
Essentially these are \'space governers,\' modifying the gravitational
force between each of the worlds, keeping the rosette from disrupting
itself.

Why the Ancients didn\'t use massive complexes of contragravity
technology on these worlds, we cannot say.

However, I now address the subject of my paper, Jump Space, and it\'s
relation to this discovery.  On further calculation of the possible
configurations of the space-time manifold around each of the
\'Governers,\' I have determined that these artifacts have not just
\'pocketed\' themselves, but have embedded themselves in the fabric of
what is commonly called \'J-Space\'.

Also, I must point out that Jump-Space, although a complex medium to
travel through is preferencial.  Nearly every possible route through
jumpspace leads to a star with terrestrial planets.  A popular way for
astrogators to visualize jumpspace is by the use of 2-dimensional maps!
And finally,

This leads me to hypothesized that Jump-Space is an artifact, created by
the Ancients, to enable convienient interstellar transit.  Much as the
Roadgrid here on Sylea enables rapid transit between place to place if a
vehicle has the appropriate equipment, Jumpspace requires a jumpdrive.

BTW, I suggest that as long as you are redoing the data, you should at
least consider breaking the 1100 sectors judiciously, so that there are
fewer tainted atmosphere worlds with bazillions of people next door to
empty earthlike worlds.

I would not mind if the 1100 data was fiddled with in the process, just to
make the y0 data make sense.  In fact, this might be a good idea, as there
are large signs that nobody at DGP actually looked at the data in some of
those sectors.

Just a thought, and one that I have been working on a way to automate, but
I want my maps first, darn it, before I try to fix the data under them!

    'body' => 'I was playing around with with jump troops, wondering what size the
launcher actually had to be, and came up with some interesting numbers. I
basically started with the classical idea that drop troops are for surprise
attacks.

First of all, I assumed the launcher was basically a mass driver, that
decelerated the capsule from the ship\'s orbital velocity to a reentry
velocity. The muzzle velocity of the MD would then have to be the
difference in those velocities.

Next, I started out assuming that the ship was in a circular orbit, and at
a minimum the capsule had to be placed in an orbit that just reached the
surface of the planet in question--standard Hohman min-energy transit. That
sets the minimum delta V necessary.

Assume a trooper in a capsule can take 15G\'s for 15 or so seconds. He might
briefly black out, but nothing serious. Then if I know the delta-V needed,
and the maximum acceleration I can put on the capsule, I can calculate the
length of the mass driver needed.

For a 300km earth orbit, a min-energy deorbit requires 89m/s, so the mass
driver has to be 27m long.

But wait! If you\'re sitting in a low circular orbit, you\'re mighty
vulnerable to defensive weapons. So I changed my assumption--the ship comes
in on a fast hyperbolic orbit, dumps the troops at the point of closest
approach, and continues on the outboud trajectory. How much vulnerability
does that provide?

Big problem--the delta-V from a minimally (eccentricity 1.00001) hyperbolic
orbit with periapsis at 300km is 3.2 KILOMETERS per second. The required
mass driver would have to be 36 KILOMETERS long ... not good.

OK. Next attempt--ship comes in hyperbolic, brakes into circular orbit,
dumps troops, and accelerates back out hyperbolic. Assume you\'re vulnerable
to fire once you\'re within 300,000km. Ship has 2G thrusters. What\'s that
look like?

Choosing a hyperbolic orbit with an eccentricity of 2.0, periapsis at
300km, we get an approach time of 10 minutes, circular injection burn of
4:42, departure burn of 4:42, and departure time of 10 minutes. Total
vulnerability: 34 minutes+launch time. Delta V for the drop troops is
89m/s, launcher is 27m.

Doesn\'t sound so bad, does it? Stop and think ... how long is the min
energy trajectory going to take the troops to reenter and land? Nearly 45
minutes. And there\'s really not much you can do to reduce that. Even if you
stretch the launcher to 50m, you still only get a delta-V of 124m/s, and a
reentry time of 43 minutes...

Now, I see somebody come screaming in on a tight hyperbolic, circularize
for a minute, and scream back out on a tight hyperbolic. What\'m I going to
think? Bingo! So I start shooting. At what, you say--the capsules are all
stealthed! Big deal. I know about how much acceleration a drop troop can
take, I probably know how long your ship is, so I know the maximum delta-V
the troops could have. So I know approximately where they are. And you\'re
not going to hide their reentry anyway. A few low-yield high-altitude
proximity nukes, and the invasion is done for.

Doesn\'t sound good for drop troops, does it? Drop-troop invasions against
any planet with decent defenses sound suicidal. Well, maybe not quite that
bad. 

If you assume your troopship jumps in undetected, and makes its hyperbolic
approach stealthed and silent running (powered down, etc.), and assume
nobody detects you until you fire up your thrusters for orbital injection,
that leaves 5 minutes from the time you\'re first detected to the time you
launch, for me to track you, figure out exactly where you\'re headed, and
alert the defenses. That\'s not much time, is it. But the defenders still
have 45 minutes to prepare for your troops landing, and as soon as they see
the reentry trails, they know where that\'ll be. Assuming they don\'t airnuke
you first ...

If you want to get better dispersion on your troops, you\'ll have to up the
delta V. And you can\'t really get anything significant out of the
launcher--that\'s more for final positioning of the troops. So you\'ll have
to place the ship close to the reentry course you want for the troops,
spending a few more minutes doing so, launch the troops (quickly), and pray
nobody knocks out your maneuver drive before you can boost your way back
out. Because if they do, you\'re going to bounce _awfully_ hard off the
surface.

Meanwhile, assume you can give your troops a delta-V of 100m/s. That
requires a launcher 33m long. So the enemy knows the trajectory your ship
was on when it launched. If it projects that trajectory forward, the most
your troops could deviate from that trajectory would be approximately
100m*time since launch. In 10s, they could be up to a kilometer away from
where the projected point is. Better pray they have _excellent_ stealth and
dozens of decoys, because if I can get interceptors within a kilometer of
the capsules, traditionally 7m^3, they\'re probably dead.

The Excel spreadsheet I created to do this is available, if anybody\'s
interested.

OK, I\'m not in position to provide sector data, but I am willing to

I volunteer to do the rimward half (subsectors I - P) of the Corridor
sector, if you can\'t find someone to do the rest, I\'ll do the whole
sector.  (I\'m not sure if I\'m up to a whole sector but since Corridor is
mostly empty...) I was already working on part of this data for a
Millieu 1100 adventure I\'m pretending to (er trying to) write. I think
that whoever does the spinward half (subsectors A - H) of Corridor is
going to have to determine how many (if any) of these worlds are Vargr
then.

starships.

How many shots do missiles and sandcasters get? I had always assumed that,
for example, a 3-missile turrent contained only 3 missiles, when you fired
them they were gone, and you had to go to a starport to get more installed.
Other players claimed that the gunner could reload one missile each space
combat turn. "One missile from where?" was my response; there are no rules
for missile storage, reloading, or magazines. I don\'t envision gunners
running back to the turret with replacement missiles under each arm. One
player thought you could just fire 3 missiles each turn for as long as you
wanted, like a video game.

Can civilians use nuclear missiles, whether contact or laser-detonation, or
not? T4 says yes, Emperor\'s Arsenal says no. So far I have said no, but all
the spaceship combat rules seem to assume that everyone uses laser-det
nukes.

Also, shouldn\'t it be harder to hit a ship with a contact missile, whether
nuclear or conventional, than with a laser-det missile? It\'s a lot easier
to aim a laser beam than an entire missile.

One of my players suggested making decoy missiles; small spacecraft fired
from missile tubes which emit energy signatures similar to a larger ship.
Does anyone have suggestions or comments about this?

I also would like to volunteer for a sector if I could... I think this

I can\'t tell off-hand what rules-set you\'re asking about, though I suspect
it\'s T4, which, you\'re right, doesn\'t tell us much.  I believe, but may be
corrected (Dave Golden?  Guy Garnett?), that the "ready missiles" in the
SSDS tables comes from the missile-turret design rules in FF&S, and covers
all missiles ready for loading within the turret.  So, yes, you only have
three available without stocking more in the cargo hold.

On the other hand, if you wanted CT, which T4 also harks back to:

Classic Traveller\'s "Special Supplement 3: Missiles" (from JTAS 21) states
(p. 7) that "each standard missile rack can hold one missile ready to fire
and two additional missiles ready for future game turns....  A gunner can
load new missiles into the racks and still operate the weaponry in a game
turn....  The standard turret has room to store an additional 12 missiles
in it.  Once these missiles have been used, the turret must be restocked
with missiles carried elsewhere in the ship (usually in the cargo hold)....
[I]f the gunner participates in restocking, he may not operate weaponry in
the turret in the next game turn."

Fancy you should ask.  ISBA, the Imperial Ship-Builders Association
(another mailing list) is discussing this very issue at this very moment.
(At least, we will again as soon as the Baron gets back from vacation).
TNE\'s new-found devotees to harder physics pointed out that contact
missiles were laughable for space-combat purposes, so det-lasers became
the canonical load -- which, of course, conflicted with the long-standing
Imperial Rules of War.  That\'s a well-roasted flame war in and of itself.

ISBA seems to be leaning towards det-laser missiles, with proper
safeguards to ensure they\'re used only for defensive purposes and not 
disassembled into rogue nukes.

And _that_ is the subject of an occasional flame-war of long standing on
the gdw-beta mailing list....  :-)  Contact missiles are just plain
ridiculous.  Some folks have tried to design so-called "BB" or "kinetic
kill" missiles that work by releasing a cloud of metal pellets over a wide
area, usually at or around det-laser range, in an attempt to nail the
target vessel that way.  It\'s still a subject of argument, based on lots
of speculation into previously unpublished details (ah, the old "how fast
do spacecraft slew?" debate!), as to whether they\'d really work or not.

It\'ll work for low tech-level opponents.  And, depending on how neutrino
sensors and densitometers work in your universe (radically different
between MT and TNE), they might even fool higher-tech enemies for a while.
Again, it depends on your rules-set and campaign background.

Perhaps the capsule is fitted with solid rocket boosters in addition to being

No problem.  Actually, we are all hoping that IG will fix the stuff

Eris,

Your movement rules were better than mine.  Can you post them again

how long a character could run.  

Thank you, sir,

Roderick,

Did you check out the rules for this in the EA?  I think they are 
done pretty good.

Shotgun rule--covered in the descriptions of the various shotguns in 
the book.

Armor Piercing rule--page 8.

Burst Fire rule--page 9.

Expanded visibility rule--page 8.

Atmosphere rule--page 7.

Malfunction rule--page 7.

Expanded explosion rule--page 9.

Expanded Blunt Trauma rule--page 10.

Long Range KE Attacks rule--page 10.

Maximum Useful Range rule--page 10.

Zero-G recoil rule--page 11.


It looks like there\'s some duplication between some of your rules and 
some of the ones in the EA--namely the shotgun rule, the maximum 
useful range rule, and the long range KE attack rule.

Maybe I misread your post in that you have tweaked these rules in the 
EA, but it looked like to me that you were adding these rules without 
knowing about the rules in the EA.

If the former is true, then please disregard this post.  If the 
latter is true, I hope that you find the EA information useful.

Thanks,

Kenneth.

Here\'s something I\'ve come up with--using info from TNE and T4.

You might like it if you want a more detailed reload rule.




Reloading.  

Reloading a weapon when its magazine is empty is an 
action and  requires, normally, one combat round to complete.  Six 
seconds is still a short period of time to disengage an old 
magazine, locate and pull a new one, and replace the 	
  spent mag in the weapon--especially if one is not well versed in the
  operation of his 	 weapon.  To simulate this, the ref may require a
  check to replace the mag in one 	 round.  If the check fails, it can
  be tried each round until the check is successful.

  To reload a weapon:  Average test of appropriate weapon skill.

  Revolvers do not take magazines, and therefore take more time.  The
  minimum time to reload a revolver is two actions.  If need be, half
  the weapon\'s ammo can be 	 reloaded in one action i.e. 3 bullets for
  a 6 round revolver could be reloaded in one 	 combat round. 
  Revolvers assume 6 round cylinders.  If a weapon takes more 	 ammo,
  say 8 rounds, then use the individual ammo rule to see how long it
  takes.  Speed loaders allow revolvers to be reloaded in one action.

  Individual rounds, like loading a revolver or a shot gun, can be
  reloaded one bullet at a time.  Up to 3 bullets can be reloaded per
  action.

  Lasers do not use cartridges--they have power packs instead. 
  Replacing a spent 	 power pack is treated like changing a magazine
  if another power pack is carried and 	 readily available.  More
  likely, changing the power pack for a laser or other energy 	 weapon
  will require 4 actions--one for each of these steps:  disconnect the
  power 	 cable from the weapon, take off the power pack, put on the
  new power pack, and 	 connect the cable to the weapon.

  Belt type magazines, as used in heavy machine guns, usually contain
  50 to 100 	 bullets, and these belts can be replaced in two
  reloading actions.  If the weapon has 	 a two man crew, usually a
  gunner and a loader, then each operator can work 	 together to get
  the weapon reloaded in one action.

  Cassette type magazines, those used in large self contained feed
  systems on 	 vehicles and such, require 5 reloading actions to
  reload.  Thus, one person could 	 reload them in 5 rounds, but 5
  people, given sufficient space with which to work, 	 could reload
  the weapon in only 1 combat round.

  All of these loading times are minimum times and assume that a fresh
  magazine is at hand to reload the weapon.

Thank you, thank you, sir.  

I run a lot of combats in my game--fire fights and fist fights.  
Besides the reasons I listed in the original post, I found that 
player characters had the potential of getting killed or 
unconscious way too fast for it to be any fun.

Rolling randomly on a character\'s stats can put a character under 
real fast.  The first shot, and wham, one stat is at zero--PC is 
unconsious on the floor at the mercy of his opponents.

This is one of the main reasons I changed the rule--that and the 
realism notes I made last time.

Besides, if you are using KBv2.0, SS is based on a character\'s skill 
level.  You\'ll roll an SS more often than you might think.

Take, for instance, a character with Pistol-3 trying to hit an 
opponent at 10 meters.  That\'s Very Short range with an Average throw 
to hit.

In KBv2.0, the character\'s SS number would be 6 or less on 3 D6.  
That\'s really not too bad of a percentage--it\'s almost 10%.

And when that SS hits--oooohhh, is it sweet.  Players love it.

Also, there\'s other things character\'s can do to take out an opponent 
fast.  In a fist fight, the character can try for double damage at 
the -5 DM listed on page 59.

In a recent fist fight we had, I had an NPC with Brawling-3 and Dex 
9.  He was throwing a hand strike against a PC--that\'s an Average 
Brawling throw.

In KBv2.0, his target number is 18, and he has to roll that or less 
on 3 D6.  The guy can\'t miss unless he rolls SF or the PC put points 
on him from the defensive pool or something.

Given this, I chose to take the -5 DM--giving the NPC a target number 
of 14 or less on 3 D6 which is still pretty good.

If I would have hit, (which I didn\'t :(), I would have rolled 
1 D6 x 2 damage.  Since it is only one die, it all comes off of one 
stat--there was a damn good chance that I was going to incapacitate 
the PC with one blow.

But, alas, the PC was better at his throws and smarter at his choices 
of attack forms--and a Brawling-1, Dex-5 PC ended up kicking the crap 
out of the Brawling-3, Dex-9 NPC.

It was a damn fun fight, but the point here is that, even if a SS 
wasn\'t rolled, there are ways to incapacitate through your choice of 
attack routine.

Cool.  Sounds like a good fight.

Wow, I\'ll take that as a compliment.  

Everybody always remembers me talking down about IG, so I thought 
that I would start pointing out when I said the good things.  I know 
that it is human nature to only remember the bad, but I promote IG 
just as hard as I tear them down.

In this case, they did a really good job on some of these combat 
rules--eventhough I thought they needed a few tweaks.

We get into fights now, and it\'s a cool fight.  My player\'s and I are 
there.  The Traveller system is so much more than, "OK, I hit, here\'s 
damage, you go ahead and roll."

There\'s choices to be made--and those choices can save your 
character\'s ass.

I\'m glad you liked the post!

Except that the powerplant won\'t *let* you do this. Aside from minor
amounts of "waste heat" which the design specificly turns back into hot
exhaust out the nozzle, the only way to "tap" the power from the drive
is to put something into the exhaust. And that will *severely* impact
thrust. 

If you want thrust, then you *can\'t* tap off power. If you want power,
you can\'t generate thrust. That\'s the way rockets work. 

There is no "power used for M-drives". The "power generated *by* the
M-drive" is the thrust. That\'s where you are getting it wrong. You are
treating the power as something *seperate* from the exhaust. It isn\'t
seperate, it *is* the exhaust.

Once you get that clear the rest makes sense too. If you want to tap
the power, you have to tap the exhaust. And that has *big* conseuences
in terms of messing up the thrust. It\'s also damned hard to do without
ruining the engine *and* whatever you are sticking into the exhaust. 

You *can* run a rocket as a generator. You have to run the exuast thru
an MHD generator, and as a result, the exhaust coming out provides
little or no thrust. And the generator required is pretty damned massive.

So, for all practical purposes, you don\'t *get* to use the power the
m-drive "generates". Because it isn\'t generated as power, it\'s
generated as *thrust*. Energy = force*distance.

Try looking at it this way: A big gun generates a lot of energy. But
you can\'t realistically expect to *tap* the power. Doing so is both
difficult, and defeats the whole *purpose* of having the gun. Namely,
producing high speed projectiles.

I ran into this same misconception over on rec.arts.sf.science a couple
of months back. Efficient reaction drives make *lousy* power plants
unless *dedicated* to being power plants.

[Long and realistic explanation of why jump-troopering is a high-risk
occupation.]

This is a perfect example of why I think it is a genuine mistake to get
the real world too mixed up with game worlds. Jump troops are fun (They
are also part of the Traveller background). Demonstrating that in real 
life they would actually have the life expectancy of a Vargr stowaway on
a K\'Kree ship is something I really don\'t need to enjoy my Traveller
games. I\'d much rather have some (however unrealistic) figures for how 
big a jump capsule is and how fast it gets down and how it has a 35 in 36
chance of making it down safe. And if I have to violate a few laws of
nature to achieve that desirable end then I\'d rather not have my nose
rubbed in it.

When it comes to games reality is a good servant but a damn poor master.

Of course, if the subsequent discussion results in demonstrating realistic
ways to make jump troops feasible, then I withdraw my remark (in this case).

I\'ve been doing something like that for the Spinward Marches for the last
half year (just for my own amusement), and let me warn you that doing 
something like that properly is a massive undertaking. I would imagine
that it would be an even bigger job for the sectors close to Core. Still,
I wouldn\'t mind helping out, but I\'m not going to get exited about it 
until _after_ it has been approved by IG.

However, if you do get approval, you should get together with Joe Walsh
and the other people from CORE. I believe they\'ve already done that work
once, at least for Core Sector, only to have it replaced by the FS stuff.

I agree completely. Random generation is a wonderful springboard for the
imagination, but it has to be tempered with common sense. I usually spend
a quarter of an hour trying to come up with an explanation for even the
most bizarre combination of UPP numbers and it\'s amazing how often I
succeed. But sometimes I don\'t. And when I\'ve tried again a couple of times,
I give up and change something to make it more sensible.

>Just a thought, and one that I have been working on a way to automate, 

Link the generation of the population figure to the physical characteristics.
Don\'t make lush low-population worlds and hostile high-population worlds
completely impossible, but do introduce a healthy bias away from them.

IMO very few, and those would be low- to mid-tech. Why? Because the Imperium
scouts made it through Corridor and Deneb in 50 years, followed very closely
by traders. They couldn\'t have done that in the face of active corsair
activity. My guess is that the rimward half of Provence and Tuglikki sectors 
were fairly empty in 0. I think Imperials settled in those as well as in 
Corridor and Deneb, and that the subsequent Vargr raids eventually caused 
the Imperium to abandon everything coreward of the sector borders. This 
would also explain why the 1100 border between the Imperium and the Vargr 
worlds is drawn by a ruler along the edges of sectors established by
Imperial map conventions. That isn\'t something the Vargr did. They didn\'t 
advance to that border and then decide to stop. The Imperium retreated to
that border and stopped them.

Hmmm... I guess I\'d like to take on part of Corridor, if the project does
become a reality.

I agree completely.  It is a huge job--that\'s why we need people.  I 
don\'t plan on doing anything until after IG approves it either.

I\'m hoping that IG will do it themselves.  If they don\'t, I\'m just 
trying to make sure the job gets done.

Here, here!!  [much applause]

As you know, Hans, when we were doing the Econ stuff for Pocket Empires 
we ran into that problem head-on.  Making it perfectly realistic (well, 
as realistic as possible - I\'ve yet to find two economists who agree on 
every issue) would have made the danged econ rules so difficult and tedious 
as to make them worthless.  So, we ended up using comprehensive yet 
limited definitions for a few key concepts, glossing over the rest, and 
essentially trying for believability and internal consistency in effort 
to achieve something that was playable and Travelleresque.

I think we pulled it off well enough, and I hope the equipment/ 
ship/vehicle design folks are able to do so, too.

BTW, Hans, your essay and rules on monetary value in Traveller looks 
great in Pocket Empires - they made a "sidebar" that is a whole page, 
giving it the emphasis it deserves.  Again, as I said when we were working 
through this, great work!  You provided the link between PE Econ and the 
economics of the Traveller game, while expanding the whole concept of 
interstellar exchange rates in a way that really adds to the Traveller 
universe.  Wow!

Oh, and one more note:  Stu and I, with a lot of good criticism and 
assistance from the playtesting team (which, in addition to Hans, 
included Rob Brennan, J.D. Burdick, James Burdick, Jr., Peter J. Miller, 
Allen Shock, and Kevin Walsh), designed and wrote Chapter 4, Economics 
and Chapter 5, Planetary Development.  Please let Stu and I know what you 
think of those chapters - what\'s right and what\'s wrong - as we do want to 
continually improve our work, so that each product is better its 
predecessor.

As a preview, CORE had to form smaller teams so we could get more work 
done after Pocket Empires.  Stu and I wrote Psionic Institutes together 
(with the help of the lovely, talented, and patient Suz Dollar and 
Carole Walsh, and a great group of playtesters - Joe Heck, J.D. Brudick, 
James Burdick, Jr., and Guy "Wildstar" Garnett). We then designed the 
much-maligned 32 pages of M0 Campaign, and are now working on a third 
project for IG.  

At the same time, Jo Grant has been working diligently on Aliens 
Hardbound Volume 1.  Andy Lilly and David Burden broke TLWH into two 
parts for IG\'s 64-page Adventure format, and are now joining Jo on the 
Aliens project.

I think I speak for all of us at CORE when I say that we\'re looking 
forward to a long, enjoyable and productive relationship with Marc Miller, 
Tim Brown, Imperium Games, our knowledgeable and patient playtesters<G>, 
and everyone who buys T4 products.  We look forward to making Traveller 
products we can all be proud of, whether as designer, editor, artist, 
playtester, publisher, or - most importantly - player.

Dear Tim

Here is a letter I wrote to Courtney Solomon as a follow up to 
Volker\'s original letter with regard to the data in FS.  In it, I 
describe how I, and many people on the list, would like to see the 
errata be available to Traveller fans.

We have also volunteered to fix the data, as you will see in the 
letter below, but we do this reluctantly.  We would rather see IG fix 
the data and provide errata, but if the company is not going to do 
this (like we have been led to believe), then we will complete it if 
IG will publish it.

Let me make it clear that we would rather not have to fix the data 
ourselves, but will do it if nobody else is--as long as IG is behind 
the project.  So far, 16 members of the TML list have volunteered to 
work on this project.  We have been waiting to hear an answer from 
IG.

Here\'s the letter with the suggested errata availability.  Please 
contact me if you have any questions.

And, thank you, Tim, for looking into this matter.  It is just the 
type of thing that we, on the list, needed to see.  Many of us were 
starting to think that IG did not care about Traveller or us--it\'s 
core customers.

We were all hoping to see something that proved us wrong.

Sincerely,

Kenneth D. Bearden

	Nope, I was aware of the EA rules, and did indeed crib lots of
them.  It\'s a great supplement.  I actually kinda prefer my take on the
shotgun thing, so I\'m going with that instead.

    'body' => 'In thinking about my first post on Ken\'s Combat Tweaks, I have 
remembered another tweak that I\'ve implemented since I\'ve started 
using the T4 rules.  This one has to do with Stun Damage.


Healing Stun Damage:

Stun damage.  See the rule on page 57.  It says that a character 
making a hand to hand attack can attack to stun rather than do real 
damage.

I actually like this rule, and I can see its use in combat.  But, I 
question how much control you have over yourself when you are 
pounding them to knock them our or subdue them.

It seems to me that there is a fine line between attacking to stun 
and attacking to kill.  In the heat of a fight, I\'m not sure a 
character has complete control over that.

In this vein, I have tweaked the stun damage rule.  

I do everything as written--basically running the combat as normal.  
But, after the fight is over, I make a distinction over which damage 
is stun and which is leathal.

How I do this is simple, and an example best describes it.

We\'ve got Jake, who\'s beat to a pulp after a fight--but still 
standing.  His original stats were 875.  With the damage from the 
fight, his stats are now 132.

What I do is roll in 1 D6 increments how much of that damage is 
stun (we are taking into account that his opponent attacked him 
with the intent to stun).  All damage that is not stun damage is 
leathal.

So, first I\'d look at Jake\'s Str.  He had an 8.  Now, he\'s got a 1.  
He\'s lost 7 points.  I\'d roll (or have the player roll) 1 D6 to see 
how many points of the damage were stun.  I roll and get a 3.

Then I check the next 6 point increment--but this is only 1 point 
(we\'ve already checked the other 6 points).  Rolling higher dice with 
the player, the player wins, and this is also considered a point of 
stun damage.

Looking at what we\'ve just done, we know that Jake has 4 stun 
points out of the total 7 damage points done to him.  

I\'d go on to check the other two stats in the same manner, and after 
that\'s done, we let him heal.

I heal all stun damage first because it heals so much faster.  Then, 
when that is completed, we start at that point to heal the lethal 
damage.

This procedure does not need to be done every time.  You only need to 
do it when you need to know a character\'s current hit point state 
before he is healed--like if Jake gets into another fight within 24 
hours.

Otherwise, given Jake gets proper medical attention, all of 
his wounds heal anyway, and you don\'t have to worry about it.



Reducing Damage for Checked Blows:

On page 57, where they talk about stun damage, it mentions that some 
weapons can be used to inflict stun damage.  They refer to a listing, 
but I haven\'t found it in the book.  Maybe it was on the missing 
weapon\'s chart.

I assume they are talking about blunt melee weapons--at least that 
seems logical to me.

Given this, I\'d handle stun damage in the same way.  If a player 
indicates that he wants his character to really check his blow, I\'d 
reduce his damage by one die.  That way, less damage is applied to 
the victim, but I would check the same way to see how much of it was 
stun damage.



Stun Damage from Explosions:

One last thing about stun damage.  The EA, on page 9, lists an 
optional rule about explosions.  There, it says you could put a limit 
on the maximum lethal damage an explosion can do--3 dice is suggested 
with the rest of the explosion damage being considered non-lethal 
(stun).

That\'s one way to handle it.  The EA also suggests another way to do 
this, and I like this one better.  Half the damage that penetrates 
armor is considered lethal--the other half is not.

You can roll damage and divide by two, but what I do is divide the 
damage dice in two.  For example, if 4 dice of damage is being 
applied to the character, 2 dice are considered lethal (I roll it) 
and 2 dice are considered stun (and, I roll that seperately).

This keeps with the spirit of the rule but also adds some variety and 
uncertainty to the roll--I could roll 2 points stun and 12 points 
lethal, or even vice versa.

If the damage dice are odd--say, 3 dice of damage penetrate, I\'d 
either roll the player higher die to see if it is 2 dice stun and 1 
dice damage or the other way around.  Or, I\'d decide based on the 
situation (if the character is in a fox hole and a grenade lands on 
him doing 3 dice--I\'d say that automatically it is 2 dice lethal and 
1 die stun.)

It is clear from the EA that the ref should get a good general rule 
that he likes with regards to explosive damage.  Between the EA and 
Book 1, there are three different ways to handle this type of damage.

Let me suggest a fourth.  It\'s a combination of the two optional 
rules in the EA.

The first rule I mentioned above says that the first 3 dice of an 
explosion is considered lethal damage, and all other damage after 
that point is considered stun.  The second rule above says that half 
the damage of an explosion is considered stun and the other half 
lethal.

Combining those two, consider this as an explosion damage option.  
The first 3 dice of an explosion that penetrates armor is considered 
lethal, and after that point, damage is halved between lethal and 
stun (either divide total damage points in two or divide dice in 
two--take your pick).

I think that explosions should be pretty hazardous, so I\'m inclined 
to use this fourth option in my game.

Kenneth.

	See, I\'d much rather work with reality, and figure out HOW to get it to
work. That\'s why I posted this. It\'s like the argument about random
generated UPPs that produce a high-pop hellhole one jump from a pop 2
Garden of Eden ... you\'ve got to do some fancy explaining to justify it!

	Well, yes, that\'s my goal. I\'d rather play D&D than prove Robert Heinlein
himself was wrong! (And don\'t get me started about that hollywood
abomination about the book coming out ....).

	Let me repeat--my goal is NOT to prove jump troops wouldn\'t exist. My goal
is to figure out HOW jump troops could work!

	Haven\'t had time to do any detailed looking at this, but it would do two
things I can see without running numbers

	1. It\'d increase the capsule signature while it\'s decelerating
	2. It\'d increase the amount of delta-V available somewhat. At a first
rough cut, assuming 20% of the capsule is solid rocket fuel, buys about
another 7 m/s (assuming I\'m not boning the calc after two hours sleep).

	And that doesn\'t really buy you much on the deorbit at all. You still
_have_ to use the ship itself (which can only decelerate at a few Gs, but
can do so indefinitely) to put the capsules on a steep reentry trajectory.

	Yep. Of course, my analsysis was _extremely_ pessimistic. The reentry
trajectory I chose has the minimum delta-V, but is the longest possible
(and I didn\'t even consider whether the capsules would "skip" instead of
reentering). Factor in reaction time on the ground now: assuming you\'re
stealthed and they aren\'t being unusually alert, they won\'t be able to
detect you until you start your attack burn, lasting 7+ minutes (to go to a
reentry trajectory instead of a circular orbit). It\'ll take them a few
minutes to detect, then confirm, track to figure out your trajectory,
identify possible targets, alert the defense sites, etc.

	My whole goal with this actually was to figure out how big a launcher had
to be. On the one hand, you\'re going to be doing most of the delta-V (20
*kilometers* per second or so) with the ship, so why bother with a launcher.

	On the other hand, the ship will probably be fairly easy to track while
it\'s thrusting, so the trajectory of your capsules will be nailed down from
the get-go, so you need to be able to impart some additional delta-V while
launching. But how big will the launcher be?

	Hmm ... using the draft FF&S2 rules and making some off-the-cuff
assumptions (OTC)

	Capsule: 7m^3 3.5:1 cylinder
	Capsule diameter (=caliber): 1.35m
	Mass of driver: 365 tons
	Delta-V (=muzzle velocity): 100m/s (OTC)
	Mass of capsule: 14 tons (OTC)
	Muzzle Energy: 0.7Mj
	Fire Control: neglect
	Volume of driver: 365m^3 (=26 Disp tons)
	Energy Required (TL12): 1.4Mj

	Hmmm ... this is interesting ... the sequence doesn\'t seem to depend on
barrel length? So how do I know what the acceleration is? Maybe I\'m trying
to stretch the rules to cover something they shouldn\'t ...

    'body' => 'Hi,

I just read the article in JTAS 26 which is a semi-interview with Marc 
Miller.  In it, the author slyly mentions a "long-time Traveller fan," 
then reveals that it\'s really Marc Miller he\'s talking about.  That got 
me to thinking about fans, players, designers, and all those other nifty 
labels floating around.

Okay, so it\'s fair to describe Marc as a fan of Traveller.  Perhaps he\'s the 
biggest fan of Traveller - he\'s devoted one heck of a lot of his life to 
it, after all. But he\'s also the creator of Traveller, the guiding 
visionary, and of course, the original and continuing designer of 
Traveller.

So, he fits into a lot of categories.  What about us, the TMLers?  What 
categories do we fit into?  I guess we have to define the categories 
first.  Here\'s how I think of them:

Fan:  Someone who buys Traveller stuff, goes to conventions that feature 
Traveller games and dealer tables, and/or talks about Traveller a lot.  I 
think this is the broadest category.  Pretty much anyone who buys more 
than a couple of Traveller products could be considered a Fan.

Designer:  Someone who designs systems, background material, or items for 
Traveller.  I think Traveller\'s Player and Fan population includes a heck 
of a lot of these people - a higher per capita ratio than any other game, 
I\'d wager.  It\'s so open to design, whether that be ships, weapons, house 
rules, or what-have-you.  A lot of the folks here on TML are designers.

Player:  Someone who actually plays Traveller.  This is what it\'s all 
about; the players are the ones driving this cart.  Without them, there\'s 
no purpose in the Fans and Designers existing.  Moreover, I\'d hasten to add 
that you don\'t get to be a player forever just because you played at one 
time.  Either you\'re currently a player, or you\'re not, depending on 
whether you\'re currently involved in a Traveller game (whether as player 
or referee).

So, who are we?  Clearly, all of us are Fans of Traveller.  Maybe not 
fans of every incarnation, but Fans of Traveller nonetheless.  I think 
that, over the course of months and years, we\'ve come to know who here is 
a designer - at least, those that aren\'t shy about sharing their designs 
on the list. :)  But, really, those two categories are secondary to the 
Player category.  And that\'s not so easy to determine here on TML - it\'s 
not a forum that is very conducive to showing that one is a player, 
apparently.  

So, who here is actually playing Traveller - any incarnation, with any 
home rules; as long as you think of it as Traveller, it qualifies - right 
now?  Who is involved in a game of Traveller, whether meeting daily, 
weekly, or monthly?

Nice post, Joe.

From the categories you listed, I fit them all.  I\'m definitely a 
fan--I\'ve bought everything IG has released so far, own 90% of 
everything GDW put out, and I own of lot of the things put out for 
Traveller by licensees.

I\'m a designer too.  You know that.  But, my forte is game mechanics 
and backgroud/story information (KBv2.0 and the Grand Adventure 
posts).  I am not as interested in designing ships, equipment, or 
vehicles, but give me a planet, and I\'ll design the hell out of it.

And, as for the most important part of your post, I\'m a player as 
well.

I started my current campaign a year and a half ago.  I worked up a 
House system using the MT task system and the TNE game mechanics.  
Since, I switched to T4 as my base system, but I always tweak things 
that I think need tweaking--the task system and combat rules (see my 
latest post).

There\'s four players and me--with each player running two characters. 
 We meet every other Sunday to play, and so far, we are having a 
blast.

I\'ve got four other players wanting to come in, but I let the group 
in on the decision to bring in new players.  We are all having such a 
good time that we don\'t want to screw it up with too many players or 
get somebody in that is not dedicated and will miss play dates.  I 
have a standing rule that if everyone doesn\'t show up, then we don\'t 
play.  I don\'t go in for that, "let so and so run my character 
tonight" stuff.  If you want to play in this game, you show up.

But, that hasn\'t been a problem.  I\'ve got a great bunch of guys--two 
of them I\'ve been RPGing with for 15 years.

Eventhough my game is set in the CT era, I have a lot of hopes for 
T4.  I don\'t mind buying the M0 stuff because I use it to supplement 
my M1100 game.

Traveller is a great game.  We\'re having a blast.

Kenneth. 

PS  Is JTAS #26 out yet? Or, did you just see an advance copy?

It\'s sort of a sickness, isn\'t it?  :)   Always fun explaining to a 
significant other why we just _have_ to have X book, even tho it\'s $22.95 
retail (or, in some cases, $65 in an auction). :)

Wonder where we\'d be without the work done by DGP, \'way back when.  Oh, I 
suppose someone would have done it, eventually.  But they did such a 
damned fine job, it\'s amazing and breathtaking.  Makes it a real joy to 
design a world down to the last detail.

Yup, your Grand campaign is well known around here. ;)

Yup, you\'ve done some good work on the combat rules.  But, I was glad to 
see Greg made some additions to the combat system in EA, since not 
everyone has net access.  Speaking of which, are you planning on writing 
up any of your stuff for JTAS articles?

Sounds like a good set of rules. Let the players decide who they play 
with, and let their peer pressure keep them all from slacking off.  Not 
bad. 


> PS  Is JTAS #26 out yet? Or, did you just see an advance copy?

Yup, it\'s out.  I have to go to the FLGS and pick up IG stuff just like 
everyone else. ;)  My FLGS got four copies of Pocket Empires and only one 
copy of JTAS 26 (he ordered four, but for some reason Chessex shorted 
him).  I picked up both on Friday, the day they all came in.  I\'d imagine 
your FLGS should have them now - if not, next week at the latest.  
Although, I hear (gratifying) reports that Pocket Empires is selling out 
here and there.

JTAS and Pocket Empires are both out.  Picked up copies of both at 
the FLGS today.

    'body' => '>Why don\'t we, here on the list, define exactly for IG the things in
>Book 1 that we would like to see changed before T4-Revised comes out?

1. Consistent and scalable design rules. The current rules for vehicles,
firearms, and starships are an inconsistent hodge-podge scattered over
several books. Not only does this make design needlessly difficult, it
makes any kind of consistency impossible because items have radically
different technology and statistics depending on which design rules you
use. Personally, I like the vehicle design rules from Central Supply
Catalog best. They are comprehensive, seem to work well at different scales
(from tools to space colonies), and have a minimum of fake units.

2. Consistent and scalable combat rules. This one really bugs me; the
combat rules for people, vehicles, and starships are all so radically
different they may as well be for different games. I can\'t even convert
between the different systems, so combined actions are impossible. Even
learning the various rules is a pain because they are all so detailed yet
apply in only specific instances. There should be some general combat
sequence, applicable to everything from personal combat to fleet actions,
with various levels of detail for special situations. Doesn\'t T4 promise on
page 5 a game system with "simpler structure ... while allowing for
multiple levels of complexity"? A laudable goal, which Traveller has not
fulfilled IMHO.

3. Abolish \'fake\' units. By this I mean things like USPs, computer ratings,
crew factors, maintenance points, anything that has no \'real world\'
meaning. Fake units are easy for designers to come up with, but are a
nightmare for referees because they are impossible to describe to players,
convert to other units, check for accuracy, or to measure realistically.
There are plenty of units, like Newtons, megabits per second, hours, and so
on that referees already understand, work well in the real world, and for
which there are plenty of real measurements for in engineering texts. Use
them.

3. A separation of game mechanics and background. One of the things I liked
about CT was its generic science-fiction rules. Now I have nothing against
the Third Imperium setting, far from it, but I think the rules would be
simpler and the background more understandable if each were understandable
in isolation and withought having to know the other. Sure, the game should
focus on the Third Imperium, but it should be possible to run other
settings using vanilla Traveller rules. The character generation sequence
is the worst offender; perhaps it could be broken into a "background and
career" section which generates the character\'s history and a
"characteristics" sections which generates the statistics.

4. Greater emphasis on role-playing. The current combat and task systems
are too stat-oriented and have very little latitude for player action to
make a difference. There are some rules that do reward role-playing; the
personal pools give individuals some tactical choices in combat, and the
Role-Playing Space Combat System makes crews actually useful in space
combat. On the other hand, the T4 task system makes a few randomly-rolled
characteristics almost completely determine success and makes the wider
variety of player-chosen skill stats practically useless. Similarly,
characters have little opportunity to influence trade or reaction rolls.
There should be something like the personal pools for trade and reaction.

5. Consistent technology rules. By this I don\'t mean a strict list of what
gizmos are available at each tech level, I mean guidelines for what effect
Tech Level has on various technologies. The only thing I liked about TNE
was the Fire, Fusion and Steel book. In it, tech levels were given
separately for each technology, so GMs could choose whatever technology
they want for their campaign and have a useful progression of tech levels.
For example, you could postulate teleportation but no jump drive at TL 12,
and FF&S gave stats for increasing levels of these technologies. Good idea.

6. Optional or variant rules. There have been a lot of alternate rule ideas
posted to the TML. Some of these are good enough to publish, at least as
variant rules. Also, there should be optional rules for things like combat,
design, research, and explorations for GMs who want to go into more detail
for such adventures.

These are the changes I would like to see in T4-revised.

to agree with you. I know several \'White men who graduated...\' etc. who
are quite creative; I don\'t think anyone\'s life (with the possible
exception of Marc Miller) should \'revolve\' around Traveller (Also,
employees of IG would have their careers revolve around the game by
definition).
5)no comment.
6)Forcing all potential writers, etc. to study and take a test will cut
down on time? Cut down on contributors, more likely. Besides - One: most
contributors are freelancers/fans/players, so are pretty familiar with
the system. Two: Existant rules, etc. are not religious text. The
NFL/NBA/NHL/ etc. are each $billion+ industries with well-defined,
well-known rules - rules that are modified, deleted, and added to
constantly, all to make the games better. Why can\'t IG and Marc Miller
try to improve the game? Because it may change the implementation of a
20 year old rule? That may be the idea.
7)As far as the \'quality\' complaint (which I read a great deal here), I
own a great deal of old CT stuff and am acquiring more and more T4 stuff
all of the time - and I think T4 is as good, perhaps better. Go to a
good Convention, pull out some CT and MT stuff, lay it next to T4 stuff
- - equal or better binding process, better card and paper stock, great
color art, etc. I am often comvinced that a great deal (not all) of the
complaints about quality have a \'good old days\' ring to them. The good
old days were 5.5"x8.5" low- to medium- quality stock books without art
and with virtually no explainatory text, and a great deal of
number-crunching (which at least convinced me to get a degree in
physics).

Again, Harold, I am not trying to flame you, just start a dialog of
what\'s good, what\'s bad, and why.

The modern battlefield have gotten either much more lethal or much more

tomahawk cruise missles have about 12 (declassified) warheads ranging
from nukes to bunker busters to \'low-power\'

(i.e. kill as many enemy soldiers as possible) he can choose a
\'high-end\' warhead; if he wants to \'minimize fatalities while
maintaining a high level of impact upon enemy unit cohesion and
battlefield effectiveness\' (i.e., riddle them with shrapnel) he will
choose a different warhead. 
 Options like these are available for virtually all levels of combat (As
a grenadier in the Gulf War I had flares, armor-piercing, thermite,

available, I mean I could load and fire one in about 3 seconds). The

considering outlawing a type of laser weapon designed specifically to
(permanently) blind enemy troops. In general, weapons are getting more
accurate and soldiers have more options.

 a 45 minute lead time is pretty good, really. Even with grav vehicles

scenarios
 1)A \'beseiged\' world to drop on - Orbiting ships bombarding defenses
for days (or weeks), damaged infra-structure EVERYWHERE, enemy troops in
deep bunkers, and light-fighters making near-surface raids. In this
situations jump troops are there to make a \'bridge-head\' (the Airborne

follow-on invasion forces; The jump troops secure a perimeter that
allows landing craft to bring in grav-tanks, G-carriers, and (a LOT)
more soldiers.
 2)surprise drop - three-four stealthed drop ships slip in and drop a
DIVISION of jump troops near a strategic objective that is not heavily
defended by ground forces (say, a medium to large city that has a
downport and isn\'t home to a grav-tank division) - their first objective
is to secure the down port for a space-head. They may be followed by 1-4
more divisions of jump-troops to help secure the city, especially if it
is industrial or high-population. As far as nukes, this will leave the
defenders with 2 choices; nuke in the high atmosphere and
electromagnetically pulse a major city and starport or nuke in the low
atmosphere and cause shock damage to the same city (indeed, as an
invader, I may very well send in a few stealthed high-megaton nukes 10
minutes ahead of the first wave - this would \'pulse\' sensors on the
surface, disrupt commo, confuse and terrify civilians in the city, etc.)
Another \'prep\' option is to have a commando team drop into the area from
a stealthed ship via re-entry kits a few hours before to perform a bit
of sabotage just prior to the jump ships arrival.

I\'m playing in Derroch\'s campaign, and we generally meet weekly. Last time

with an Indiana Jones Complex. This time I\'m Perlis Alyeska Dalal,

Another TMLer, Ross, is also playing - as Merchant 2nd Officer Amr Santayema.

Oddly, I don\'t quite qualify as a Traveller "Fan", at least not by Joe\'s
definition: I\'ve never played Traveller at a convention, and have only ever
bought three (3) Traveller products: the Traveller Book (hc), T4 Book 1,
and CSC. (Starships I won, courtesy Joe himself, in the first TML contest.)
Most of the other books are not directly useful to me, as the campaign I\'ve
been working on is not set in the Imperium Universe. Which does sort of
make me a "designer", I guess; certainly there\'s enough of my stuff out
there on the Web. I will probably acquire EA at some point, and maybe the
T4 Deluxe, but I don\'t pick up the Milieu stuff because I\'d just have to
rewrite it all anyway.

Of course I am a \'fan\'. I\'ve loved Traveller since my first game, way back
in 1979 or so - wherein my PC was so abruptly swallowed up by one of those
ridiculous Psionic Trappers. And so, I sometimes suspect, was I...

I\'ve thought of rewriting one of my short stories, setting it in Year 
0 and moving the location from the Spinward Marches to the M0 
campaign, and sending that in.

I\'ve also thought of presenting JTAS with KBv2.0, but I\'m not sure if 
they would print it.

Yes, we have a pretty straight schedule.  I\'ve been down the road 
where one person can\'t play, so we wait a week.  Then another person 
can\'t play, and we are put off another week--and so on and so on 
until it\'s two or three months in between games.

Everybody forgets what happened last.  It takes a while to get back 
into what\'s going on--I just spend so much time setting up the game 
that I want to keep up the momentum.

We play two Sundays a month--set up a month in advance so that people 
can work their schedules around it.

Four months a year, there are five Sundays in the month, and we add a 
Wednesday play date during those months giving us three play dates 
in that month.

Our play schedule is pretty ridgid.  Once all agree to a play date, 
we play.  There is no backing out unless something extreme happens.

In any case, if we don\'t get in the specified number of play dates 
within the month, we carry them over to the next month and "catch 
up".

Doing this maintains 28 five to seven hour game sessions per year--a 
reasonable number given everybody\'s career, wives, family, and other 
interests.

Yes, I heard that PE was out, but I called and my store hasn\'t gotten

product because of this.

I\'ll call again tomorrow to see if I can get them.

Remember that the gun shot rules are intended to see who gets wounded or hit,
rather than track every single bullet.
But you could write a task like this:

To shoot a bulls eye (5 rounds in 6 seconds).
(Dex + Pistol) < Difficult (2.5D)

At Dex 8 and Pistol-1, that\'s a 57% chance of success.

OR,

	Special Cases: Some general rules are made to be broken. The details of task
structure may be violated in order to achieve realistic results. For example,
although Dexterity and Education are associated characteristics for Art, the
very special task to create a true Work of Art arguably depends totally on
Art skill.

To shoot a bulls eye (5 rounds in 6 seconds).
(Dex + Pistol) < Difficult (2.5D)
Special Case (trained competition event).

Special case reflects that this is an "athletic" event with specific
circumstances for which one trains specifically.

OR,

If this is a one-time event which the character just happens to become
involved in, Spectacular Success would achieve the bulls eye (and Spectacular
Failure would probably wound someone.

OR,

If you think this sort of thing is commonplace for your specific character,
then it might be an easy task and we just ignore rolling. If you are applying
it to resisting some thug in the street, then the circumstances are totally
different anyway. And I would argue that in that case, you probably wouldn\'t
get 5 shots in 6 seconds all in a bullseye painted on the thugs chest.
Trained police rarely achieve that either.

My first posting of this message appears to blown up...so let\'s try again.

And now for something completely different, other than the usual 
TML-bitching (would you believe I\'m at least 80 digests behind...you guys 
type too much!).

I finally tracked down the novel that Victoria (Spinward Marches, see 
JTAS#2 for writeup) is based on. It is Prisoners of the Sky, by C.C. 
MacApp (Lancer Books, 1969...original price $0.75, sigh, I paid a bit 
more for it!). 

The cover: Our hero in a white uniform, with goggles slung around his 
neck. There\'s a hose drapped around his shoulder, breathing gear? In the 
background is a blimp, behind that is a orange colored moon criss-crossed 
by lines (cracks?) and craters (which was something like Albert, 
Victoria\'s moon, if I remember right).

The back text is also pretty fun:

- --begin quote--

POISON PLANET

Earth colonized Durrent, a strange world of high mesas and poison 
valleys, where men could live only on the highest peaks. There were other 
stars to colonize, and better worlds--but space was vast. There was no 
way off Durrent until the chance visit of another wandering starship. The 
men of Earth were there to stay.

Even though much of hte planet was forbidden, locked behind the barriers 
of poison gas, the colonies grew and became separate city-states. Then 
war broke out, and one young Fleet officer of Mesa Lowry, armed only with 
an outmoded training ship and a crew of half-trained civilians, found 
that the future of his world rested on the outcome of his battle to clear 
his family name of dishonor!

- --end quote--

I\'ll post a review of the book after I get to it. C.C. MacApp only had a 
half-dozen or so titles to his name. The Encyclopedia of SF (Clute, et 
al) writes fairly positively of him. 

Laterish!

Didn\'t Heinlein mention that there were \'retros\' on the drop capsule? I
know he did talk about dropping them at zero velocity compared to the
planet, but he too was never one to let technical details get in the way
of a good story. Perhaps they\'re dropped in a lot faster and use retro
rockets to slow themselves...after all, the way he described the sequence
of parachutes makes them seem to be moving at a lot faster than terminal
velocity.

Actually I always pictured \'jump\' troops as being \'meteoric assault
troops\' IE: they actually do come in fast, brake at the last minute really
hard, and then land.

Still, a few good air bursts \'a la\' the old Missile Command game should
take them out if they\'re seen coming...which is, I think the key here. As
someone, maybe even you, I don\'t remember, said, the LZ has to be softened
up a LOT before any ground trops can be committed...you need to make sure
they can\'t get off those air bursts very effectively if at all.

The other big use for drop troops, imho, probably the biggest use, is
covert insertion of small groups. The near space of any planet in the
Imperium is going to be full of junk making meteoric re-entry all the
time...if you\'ve been putting stuff into orbit and flying starships for
hundreds or thousands of years, the current, not inconsequential load of
garbage we have in orbit here on Terra is going to seem like white glove
spotless. 

The defensive eyes and ears of a planet will be in space, and a few drop
capsules could get lost in the garbage in orbit.

This, however brings up another point entirely, how do ships move through
all this crap?  Maybe that\'s the reason for the minimum armor on all
starships being pretty thick.

Designer:  Someone who designs systems, background material, or items for 
Traveller.  I think Traveller\'s Player and Fan population includes a heck 
of a lot of these people - a higher per capita ratio than any other game, 
I\'d wager.  It\'s so open to design, whether that be ships, weapons, house 
rules, or what-have-you.  A lot of the folks here on TML are designers.

I try to be a designer.  I would do more if I had more time, thats 
what I keeo telling myself anyways.

Player:  Someone who actually plays Traveller.  This is what it\'s all 
about; the players are the ones driving this cart.  Without them, there\'s 
no purpose in the Fans and Designers existing.  Moreover, I\'d hasten to add 
that you don\'t get to be a player forever just because you played at one 
time.  Either you\'re currently a player, or you\'re not, depending on 
whether you\'re currently involved in a Traveller game (whether as player 
or referee).

Yes I can say I am a player, I run the ISBA (not much action right 
now), I am in an IRC game with Twolf that I realy like a lot, and I 
am an in Eris PBeM game if I ever manage to make it up those seven 
flights of stairs : )



Who\'s driving this cart, anyway? :)

You mean there is no driver, that explains every thing : )

I don\'t think there was such a thing as a fuel refinery until \'High Guard\' (book 
5).  I do remember something about scout and navy craft not needing refined fuel 
though.

	I just got some figures on atmospheric reentry, but I haven\'t had any time
to look at them or update my worksheet. But the short answer is that it
will have some effect, depending on how steep a reentry angle you want. The
steeper a reentry angle, the more delta-V you have to apply--you\'ve got to
be in a tighter trajectory when you reenter the atmosphere. And you want a
fairly steep reentry angle, because shallow angles just skip you off.

>I don\'t think stealthing a drop capsules worth much considering the noise a
>re-entry makes.

	I won\'t help you be undetected, but it might make it a little bit harder
to get a targeting lock. On the other hand, once an IR-homing interceptor
gets into your general area, you\'re glowing like a great big bullseye.

	The key factor is going to be reducing the reentry time, and I\'ve already
got a bunch of ideas on that. Any more would certainly be appreciated,
though ...

Me! I ref a T4/CT/MT blend once a week, alternating with a fantasy game run
by one of my players (ie he does four weeks, I do four weeks). We are
working through the CT adventures and just started Twilights\' Peak.

I think that puts me in the player and fan part (having recently moved
house I frightened myself with how much Traveller stuff I own!). I do
design things (particularly starships with HG rules), but haven\'t really
used FFS.

Extremely good point. Given what we know of current reality; what do we need
to postulate to make jump troops work in planetary invasions? Are they only
for for attacks on worlds at or below some tech level?  Are they preceeded
by some massive EMP hit that blinds the local sensor systems so that no one
sees them come in, and so can not plot projected drop point? Is there only
one ship making a drop or do multiple ships, in different orbits, make runs
that would appear to be dropping troops? Ten ships, in ten different orbital
paths, each dropping a hundred capsules with ten different potential landing
points could be more than local defenses could handle simultaneously. Pick
the wrong group of drop capsules to target and you let the invaders land safely.


What are the modern analogies in paratroops?  Do we just fly over and jump
out where the enemy can see and hear us comming? Or are there specific
tactical steps that must prepare the site for a paratroop drop?

Maybe it\'s all relative. What was good enough to be A in M0 might only be 
rated as B in 1100. Standards and definitions can change a lot in 1000

Here\'s what I\'m using:

        meter/6 sec     turns to exhaustion
Sprint  (STR+DEX)*2             END
Run     (STR+DEX)              END*50
Jogging (STR+DEX)*0.75       unlimited
Walking (STR+DEX)*0.50       unlimited

Atlethics Skill (not including any attribute) can be added to the sprint
meter/6 sec, if it\'s a pure sprint with no other actions taking place.

I guess jogging should have an endurance limit, but I haven\'t run into a
need for it.  Also the upper end of endurance for running doesn\'t model
marathon runners well at all, but *that* hasn\'t come up in a game
either. ;->

On another note, I actually use Agility rather than Dexterity for this,
and yes, I break that attribute in two:  Agility is foot speed, whole
body control and balance; Dexterity is hand speed, hand-eye coordination
and manual dexterity.  Another way of looking at it is Dexterity is for
the fingers, what Agility is for the feet.

Hi Alex, welcome to the list.

The easy answer to your question is that somebody, somewhere, screwed up.

The more difficult answer is determining who screwed up, and how. :)  But, 
that\'s probably a fruitless pursuit anyway.  Doesn\'t make things any 
better.

First Survey is the officially correct version; it supercedes what was 
printed in T4.  So, you can safely ignore the subsector in T4...

This is cool, but I have a few comments.  You assume they will be more
vulnerable then they should be.  The reason they seem to be vulnerable is
that they are not being backed up.  Historicaly no General in his right
mind would drop paratroopers (a close equivalent of JTroops ?) into a
combat zone without a) total air superiority and b) there is some kind of
combined naval/ground action at the same time.

So, using my above premise of combined arms action, the planet being
targeted should have no space navy, the invading power controls the space
lanes.  The invaders should also have done some bombardment perhaps, and
suppressed local air power as much as possible.  The JTroops should only
be dropped in an area that already has friendly ground forces nearby for
support.  This way, the defenders are to worried about other factors (air
strikes, Space bombardment, ground incursion etc) to worry much about
JTroops, or if they are worried about Jtroopers, the other pressures on
the defender make the 45 minute reaction time to short.

So to recap, historicaly paratroopers have been used only when the
folowing assertions are true;

1) Complete air superiority is established (Germans over Crete, DDay)

2) Trailing ground forces are nearby (Arnheim, DDay, Russians in
   Manchuria)

3) Naval Support provided (DDay)

4) Surprise/Confusion is important (All of the above, Den Bien Phu)

So, if I continue to draw the same parallel between paratroopers and
Jtroopers then the above Traveller *equivalents* would also have to be
true.

Greetings all,

I\'m currently in the process of building a on-line world, a SF one. Mainly
intended for Traveler. But it well be able to be used in other systems as
well. Anyhow, I\'m trying to drum up a little help. I\'ve got some graphics

This world is on Gameverse a join effort in world building. However I would
like to get some other involved if possible. Most of the world\'s do far are

   IG has pretty much lost me and many other present and former members
of this list as a customer.  However, the last I checked, we\'re not the
only ones with disposable income.  If IG plans on making money on this
game, they are going to have to try to keep their remaining customer
base and bring in new customers.  My proposed supplement would be a good
start.

   Send your letters to IG or Marc Miller.

   I seem to recall that TNS updates (or something similar) for Year
Zero were supposed to be entered "real time".  That is, each week we
were supposed to get new TNS posts for that week in Imperial news.  We
never got it.  There have been a number of other promises made in that
regard as well.

   I hope this isn\'t IG\'s attitude, because if it is, what I\'m hearing
is that nearly 20 years of storyline development is irrelevant.  Any old
Traveller publications are irrelevant.  Loyalty is irrelevant.  Long
time fan support is irrelevant.  You will be assimilated....

   Sorry for the Borg reference.  I know you don\'t speak for IG (or Marc
Miller for that matter).  Back last year, I warned those who hailed the
return of Marc Miller that those who expected a revised classic
Traveller, or "Traveller Done Right" would instead get "Traveller Done
Differently".  I take no satisfaction in being correct.

   The intent wasn\'t to insult but to make a point.  IG needs to make a
decision.  Do they want to try to recreate some of the look and feel of
classic Traveller, thus try to appeal to the old fan base, or do they
want to come up with a new system and a new story that attempts to drawn
in a new audience?  Trying to do a little of both (the apparent strategy
to this point) isn\'t accomplishing either goal.

   Should IG really want go in a radically different direction, if they
really want to shake things up and put out a *new* product that just so
happens to be called "Traveller" and that the majority of the market out
there (average age well below 30, who have never heard of Marc Miller,
and whose idea of sci-fi comes from movies not books) will buy, they
need to conduct a serious purge and start from scratch.  Hire people who
are young, hungry, and think their lives revolve around their work. 
People who do this stuff because they *love* it, not because they want
to supplement their incomes.  Coming up with a staff that is also
ethnically and gender diverse (name the last regular female creative
contributor to Traveller) would be a nice bonus.

   If IG is intent on doing something with the look and feel of the
original, then do it right.  Make sure the staff knows the background
history.  Bring back the good features of the game mechanics that have
appeared over the past 20 years (e.g. MT\'s task resolution system, TNE\'s
hit location charts, classic Traveller\'s richly detailed background with
well done adventures), not the bad ones (MT\'s constant errata problems,
TNE\'s ignorance of how astrophysics works, classic Traveller\'s overly
simplistic personal combat damage system).  But again, bring in people
who are dedicated to the project, people who can take the old wine, put
it in new bottles, and do it in a way that makes it appear fresher. 
This includes taking classic Traveller art and updating it for the
1990s.

   As the situation now stands, the freelance contributors to T4 know
more about the background of the story than the people supposedly on
staff.  I find this deplorable.  I suggest a test because it will save
time.  How?  As things stand now, Marc Miller has to review everything
to make sure it jibes with canon.  If there were more people who could
competently screen material, it would create a faster turnaround time as
far as editing is concerned, and would lead to fewer mistakes.

   See above.

   But the basic game mechanics stay the same.  The NFL might introduce
a rule designed to protect quarterbacks better, but there is still a
quarterback, and if he gets tackled with the ball, the offense gets the
ball on the spot he went down (unless it was 4th down in the US, 3rd
down in Canada, but I digress)--those rules do not change.  Also, the
last time I checked, the Green Bay Packers won the first two Super
Bowls, and one of the times they won, they beat the Kansas City Chiefs. 
I don\'t see anyone changing the history books so that it was the Oakland
Raiders the Packers beat instead.

> Why can\'t IG and Marc Miller try to improve the game? Because it may 
> change the implementation of a 20 year old rule? That may be the idea.

   Give me a good reason to change a certain mechanical aspect of a
game, and I say more power to you.  You seem to be forgetting, or may
not be aware, but I\'m one of the fellows that beat on the doors of GDW
(and later IG) trying to get them to fix the way star systems were
generated in the game.  Changing the background history is another thing
altogether.  Changes in the background history should *only* occur if
there is some kind of contradiction that has to be resolved.  The
regional capital of the First Imperium in the Solomani Rim was located
at Gashidda.  The regional capital of the First Imperium in the Solomani
Rim was located at Dingir.  One of those statements is true, one is
false (by the way, this is a real life example).  It\'s up to somebody
official to say which is correct.

   I would currently rate the quality of the *content* of the T4 stuff
to be somewhere around that of MegaTraveller, 1st edition.  This is
*well* below the quality of the classic Traveller material, c. 1985.

   By that logic, it is better to own a Porche 911 with a bad engine,
bad transmission, and faulty brakes than a Honda Civic in perfect
running order when you need to get to a job interview.  The Porshe won\'t
get you there, but at least you\'ll look good sitting on the side of the
road with no work.

   I would much rather have 5.5"x8.5" books that gave me quality content
with just enough black and white illustrations to get the point across
than high gloss numbers that are poor in content with irrelevant high
gloss art.  I would rather have accurate formulas that might require a
calculator to save time than tables that are badly formatted, contain
bad numbers, or are just plain missing from the book.  Call me old
fashioned if you must, but I think you will agree with me.

>Again, Harold, I am not trying to flame you, just start a dialog of

   Understood.  And it was my intention to come up with some
constructive criticism of T4 and what I think IG is doing wrong at this
phase of the game.  It is entirely possible they are already addressing
some of my points.  I hope so.  I want to see that new star system
generation system come out--it or something like it is **long** overdue.

Harold

The Droyne alien module explains the ancients, and Grandfather.
Grandfather was a freak of nature, a "mule" if you will, who had god like
inteligence and psionic power.  He and his 20 grand children created what
we now call the ancients.  The 1000 year war was Grandfather exterminating
his now defunct children and all (or atleast most) of the reminence of the
society he built.  He then withdrew to a "pocket" universe.

I agree.  If I ever wrote a book or made a game, HUMANITY would be the

Lessee, I definitely fit this category. I keep having to buy new plastic
crates to hold new acquisitions. It\'s a never ending cycle. :) I love to
collect and Trav is definitely a collector oriented game system anymore,
with so much out of print. I started collecting it not long after Megatrav
debuted and kept buying all the way through TNE and now T4. Since then I\'ve
begun collecting CT material as well, as I find it really useful and
interesting. If I could get one of the second rate Cons around here to run
a Traveller game, that might be nice, but if one of them did at least
feature it, I\'d undoubtedly be there.

Well, I don\'t have the gift that some people on this list have for
designing rules and equipment, (several names come to mind, but I don\'t
want to inflate too many egos or short change anybody ;) but I do love
designing world descriptions and important characters (NPC\'s,
personalities, whatever...) Some of my favorite work has been doing small
planet write-ups and personality profiles for TNE, specifically for the
BARD pages. Just wish I had the time to put a real effort into it and not
just do something every few months. I, as several others on the list, think
it adds so much color and life to the gaming material if you try and flesh
out some of the statistics that Trav is so full of. It\'s a blast to take a
planetary or character code and turn it into something with substance.

I played CT back in the mid-80\'s. Had a Vargr corsair and our little group
operated out of the Spinward Marches. It was about as classic a campaign as
you could get. 
I did run a short lived TNE campaign based off the Buckaroo Banzai Hongkong
Cavaliers (They fit too perfectly for my group not to use them). They made
a magnificent Lancer team. It was a kind of off the wall thing and it
worked really well. I hadn\'t run anything since then until a couple of
months ago. I, once again like several on the list, bought a few copies of
T4 when it came out and distributed them to my players as gifts. It worked,
and in no time they were hooked and wanted to play. I have a retired Scout,
retired Navy engineer, and a rogue ex-Army running together in the Scout\'s
ship. We started with a modified Rubicon Cross scenario set c.1110, which
they managed to screw up royally. The first session ended with them
misjumping into Solomani space. They were already near the border as it
was... As we rotate about a half dozen games through our group, it took a
while for everyone to get together again to game again. We ran the second
session last night. The three of them found out they were in the Scipio
system, which for those who don\'t have any Solomani rim supplements was a
self-interdicted TL7 world with no starport about 5 parsecs inside the
Solomani border. The jump drive had conveniently malfunctioned and a part
burned out. It was irreplaceable in the sense that they had no spare and
couldn\'t jury rig one. They\'d have to get the part from a starport or
another jump drive. Of course, they discovered, they were in a system that
had no jump drives. So they worried a bit. To make a long story short (too
late) they reconnoitered the planet for a while, uncovered and foiled a
band of Solomani smugglers and got the part they needed, then were
unceremonially snagged by a Solomani border patrol. They got out of it
eventually. 
I\'ve decided that I just don\'t like using T4 rules, though, and my players
have agreed with my decision to convert back to TNE or possibly MT rules,
as we\'re more familiar with them. Doesn\'t mean I won\'t keep buying, but
I\'ve given up on the system, not really for anything more than I have no
time to learn it and work through the bugs. It could be done. Had I more
free time I would. We like the older systems, though, and that\'s what we\'re

Also has anybody discussed the effects or even placement of a black hole

Read \'STARSHIP TROOPERS\' by Robert Heinlein

This book gives an interesting account of jump troops that might get you
pointed in the right direction.

	Actually, the "vulnerability" assumption was based on an attempt at a
lightning surprise strike, which is the "classic" use for jump troops.
Under those conditions, you haven\'t even started to gain air/space
superiority, nor any other actions. As you point out, departing from that
changes things.

	Not that you can\'t have a lightning surprise strike without a bunch of
other stuff going on, including a combined naval/ground action, and heavy
top cover. But that\'s a fairly major operation, not a surgical strike anymore.

	Just the one I raised above. Jump troops are not alway used as part of a
major, unrestricted combined-arms assault on a planet. If you\'re trying for
a quiet sneak attack, bringing in millions of tons of warships is kind of
overkill... However, I agree with your fundamental point--a full-scale
invasion requires the jump troops be heavily supported. I\'m just trying to
find ways for them to survive in the other role...

Hi there:

This is probably a dumb question, but I have looked for this bit of
information before in the past and not been able to find it:

Where do I find the cost and specifics of adding a fuel refinery to a
ship for CT?

Likely it is just something I have overlooked -- or it is lurking
somewhere I have not found yet.

Thanks in advance for your help!

	I remember seeing a reference to an article in an old Dragon magazine
about black holes for Traveller once.  I believe it was over ten years ago
when Dragon used to have articles for CT.  Does anyone else remember it or
know what issue it was in?

    'body' => 'As an ex-member of an Airborne unit who GMs for former paratroopers, I
had been thinking about the \'proper\' use of jump troops for about a week
before the original posting here (I\'m jealous I didn\'t bring it up
first!). I am going to assume my opinion on how it may \'go off\' will
interest someone (and I love to have my plans critiqued).
  First, my assumptions for the first scenario; 1) the opposing world
has at least TL 9 and is aware of the existence of jump troops 2)The
target has coordinated global defenses, troop and aircraft bases, and
orbital/ground starports (1 or more) 3) the target is NOT an ocean
world! Using those assumptions, I made an \'H-hour\' timeline where H is
the beginning of the initial jumptroop drop. For examples, I am using a
TL 11 Earth as the target world;
 
H -24 hrs: if the target has no reason to expect invasion, commandos are
infiltrated onto the planet\'s surface either by posing as
tourists/businessmen/etc. (best) or by re-entry kit (worst) These
commandos will have three objectives - 1)inspect the planned landing
zones (LZs) for safety and usability 2)confirm land routes to primary
objectives and 3)prepare sabotage actions

H -18: highly-stealthed dropships jump in-system. They will have
accelerated to the correct speed before jumping and will make course
corrections with gaseous attitude rockets to avoid detection as long as
possible. They will be \'aft-first\' on jump so that they are ready to
decelerate. There will be 4 groups of ships on different courses, three
of the groups will carry a division of jump troops (6,000 marines or
army).

H -12: The jump troops will have finished their final equipment
inspection and will be sleeping

H -2: The jump troops will have been up for 2 hrs, eaten a hot meal, and
showered. At this time they will be \'geared up\' for final safety check.
Group #4 will fire a series of high-yield nukes (stealthily) with a long
flight time

H -45 minutes: all troops will be in jump capsules and rigged for high
acceleration, all of the tasks forces will begin high-g deceleration to
get the right velocities for drop. From this point on, any indication
that the target is aware of the attack (increased sensor activity,
scrambled spacecraft or atmospheric fighters, etc.)will cause all groups
to fire dummy projectiles at the surface: launch missles at any defense
craft, comm sats, etc.: and switch to active jamming.

H -20 minutes: If commandos were deployed, they strike now. They will
concentrate on destruction of comms (comm relays and uplinks), civil
leaders (mayors, police cheifs) and disruption of infrastructure
(disrupt the energy grid and water pumping stations). They will not be
able to hit all of these targets and the priorities will vary from world
to world.

H -15 minutes: The pre-fired nukes will detonate in the ionosphere,
EMPing the surface over the target - in my example, the EMP \'footprints\'
will be over North America (Over L.A., Chicago, Dallas, New York) Europe
(London, Paris, Stockholm, Antwerp, Berlin, Moscow) Asia (Tokyo,
Singapore) and the Pacific (Honolulu) all based upon their
electromagnetic signature - lots of radio traffic, etc. While most
military electronic will probably be intact and many core comm relays
may survive. Many other systems, though, will fail. Most exposed sensor
arrays will be crippled, as will many personal electronics. Since the
jump will be scheduled for late night local, the flash and effect would
be spectacular.
 At this same time, if the ships havn\'t already started firing as in H
- -45, above, they do so now.

H -5 minutes: The groups fire a series of \'dummy\' pods. Some are active
radar/sensor jammers that \'flicker\' on and off, some are \'repeaters\'
(they have on-board radio and radar receivers. They record intercepted
radio and radar signals and replay them at high power several times
before swithing to new signals - imagine every thing you say be repeated
by an echo chamber attached to 400 watt speakers) some are LZ prep
munitions - they release hundreds of submunitions (like a cluster bomb)
that strike the ground minutes before the jumptroops to take care of any
defenders on the ground.

H Hour: The groups begin the drop. Group #1 is targeting L.A., #2
Chicago, #3 the Downport for the starport in Dallas. Group #4 is firing
submunitions, jammer/repeaters, and standard heavy explosives at the
military bases between New York City and Washington, D.C.

H +5 minutes: The last jump troop is dropped. The drop ships continue
firing on the planet and space objects as they \'flip\' and accelerate
away. The last dummy jumppods fired by group#4 begin releasing a
foul-smelling green gas - it is a harmless psychological warfare device
to spread panic.

H +15 minutes: Follow-on forces begin to jump in-system. Since jump
troops would only be used to subdue a planet, this probably includes
capitol ships, destroyers, more drop ships, troop carriers, supply
ships, and a large carrier. They will jump in as close as is safe,
immediately deploy fighters, and engage any space defenses as they close
on target.

 NOTE: at this time, the jump pods are screaming towards the planet
surface at high speed and a steep angle. Stealthed to avoid weapons lock
and surrounded by countermeasures, intercepting pilots will be faced
with thousands of small, fast targets moving towards their worst enemy
(the ground). They can\'t get weapons lock, can\'t communicate with base
for orders, and don\'t know where all of the pods are. Her choice is to
dive after a target in air made turbulent by the pods, surrounded by
hurtling steel objects, and manually aim at a target they may be a
jumptroop, may be a dummy round, then pull out of her dive before eating
asphalt. Proximity airburst might help, but I think densteel jump pods
can take a sanding and keep on landing - only a few jumpers would be
killed that way. My arguments about defensive use of nukes were already
posted (I think).

H +35 min: The submunitions clear the LZs - the LZs will be near the
target city, but not in it (Light suburbs).

H +45 minutes:Jumptroops begin landing. They will immediately begin
establishing a perimeter and heavy-weapons troops will begin preparing
anti-aircraft and anti-tank defenses.

H +1 hr: The last jumper will have landed, the cargo pods will have been
opened (heavy weapons, medical supplies, orbital radios, etc.) and the
commando teams (in augmented battledress) will be departing for their
first objective. The troopers first objective is to setup a secure
perimeter for follow-on forces; commandos will sow confusion, gather
intelligence, and disrupt enemy operations.

H +6: Fast follow-on ships will begin attacking planetary defenses,
perhaps attacking surface targets.

H +12: Follow-on forces \'big ships\' reach orbit and begin bombardment.
More jump troops will either reinforce the units on the ground or drop
on new targets. Landing ships will start bringing in troops, G-carriers,
and grav tanks to the \'space heads\' established by the jump troops.
Evacuation of the wounded begins.



  As you can see, Jump troopers will definately suffer heavy casualties
(In the Real World predictions of airborne operations in Europe vs. a
Soviet invasion, casualty estimates were 40%-60% for SUCCESSFUL
operations). And if anything goes wrong, they get left in hostile
territory. But I think most of their casualties will be on the ground
after the jump, not \'in transit\'.

John Harshman commented once upon a time that, if there are to be multiple
compatible human races scattered across space in Traveller, there has to be a
mechanism which scattered them. We concluded that would have been the
Ancients.

More or less at the same time, we talked about Ancient Sites---- destroyed
ruins with clues to who the Ancients were and what technology they had.

Yaskoydray (Grandfather) was the genius head of the Ancients 300,000 years
ago, and he was the motivation behind many things in the Traveller universe.

On the other hand, he is a benefactor primarily of the Droyne rather than of
humanity. And isn\'t it strange that he is content to see their numbers
increase without making them Lords of the Universe.

In any case, Grandfather is an interesting character, but hardly a god to
produce automatic answers or high technology for humans.

  I have yet to see a change to the game mechanics from IG more radical
than the ones you mentioned in some snipped text (i.e., using task
resolution from this version, combat from that version, etc.). And as
far as history - the Traveller storyline is no more immutable
fact-of-history than the Batman storyline. Batman used to carry a .45
magnum, now he hates guns and has never used one - all because the feel
of the character changed. While I doubt that a major change (like no
rebellion in 1200 at all) is forthcoming, minor changes to a timeline
like this one are, at most, inconvenient (personally, I think \'no Virus\'
would be minor - the loss of civilization and massive loss of life could
easily be explained by widespread planetary bombardment,
chemical/biological warfare, and breakdown of interstellar trade AND
would do so without adding a major new element to previous \'canon\').

But above content of the \'77-\'80 period, when I began playing. If the
content doesn\'t improve to above the \'85 period by \'99, I\'ll be amazed,
simply because of the amount of good ideas floating around here. (think
I can throw more dates around in one looooong sentence? :))

As I said above, I think they have made a much better start than GDW did
and (based on CSC, EA, and PocEmp) I think the content is on its way up
fast.

Speaking as an engineer who plays Traveller to relax ;-)....

I disagree quite strongly about dropping fake units (or at least all of
them). Having abstract, non-realworld units allows you to divorce the
performance of Traveller equipment from reality. Give it real SI (or even
Imperial!) units throughout, and the technology loses its mystique, and I
believe you lose the far future feel. It also raises the level of math you
have to achieve in design and operation using the rules.

Maybe the conversions should be there, but not used directly in the
processes. Sort of there for the interested party.

Rob Flammang posted two versions of some excellent conversion rules to take

here (I have yet to coordinate with Tim Brown for those records).
4. Some key worlds (Sylea, Vland, etc) need to be fixed.

I invite any comments on this data file, recommended fixes, changes, or other

accessible place.

Since this is a big file, I am not attaching it here. If you want a copy,

This is an extract from the chapter of T4.1 (Starports) previously posted to
the list.

Location
	A starport may be located on a world surface, or it may be in orbit above
the world. 
	Down. A starport may be located on a world surface. If so, the starport is
most frequently referred to by the world name followed by the word Down.
Thus, Sylea Down is the main world surface starport for the world of Sylea. 
	Why a surface port? Landing close to the market is convenient for all
concerned. If the environment is at all tolerable, then life support and
labor costs are minimized.
	Highport. A starport may be located in orbit above a world. If so, it is
most frequently referred to by the world name followed by Highport. Thus,
Sylea Highport is the main orbital starport for Sylea. A highport maintains
scheduled links by shuttle with the world surface (if there is no surface
starport, then with an air transport hub).
	Why a highport? Many very large ships never land on a world surface; the
cargo they carry is off-loaded in orbit and shuttled down. Some worlds are
naturally inhospitable (bad surface weather, a water world, fluid oceans, or
perhaps government type D or E) and ship owners prefer not to risk their
equipment venturing down to the surface.

<snip>

	Starport type is based on a simple letter classification system (ranging
from A to E) which details their basic facilities.
	A. Excellent quality facility with refined and unrefined fuel available on
site. Facilities include capability to perform annual overhaul and new ship
construction (QSDS certified designs). A naval base may be present. A scout
base is usually not present. A surface installation is present. A highport
may be present (generally if the world atmosphere is 2+).
	B. Good quality starport with refined and unrefined fuel available on site.
Facilities include capability to perform annual overhaul and new spacecraft
construction (QSDS certified designs). A naval base may be present. A scout
base may be present. A surface installation is present. A highport may be
present (generally if the world atmosphere is 2+).
	C. Routine quality starport with unrefined fuel available on site.
Facilities include some capability for repair (primarily replacement of
QSDS-certified parts). A naval base is usually not present. A scout base may
be present. A surface installation is present. A highport is usually not
present.
	D. Poor quality starport with unrefined fuel available on site or close by.
It has no repair or construction facilities. A naval base is not present. A
scout base may be present. A surface installation is present. A highport is
not present.
	E. Frontier starport. With no facilities, the installation is little more
than a flat expanse of bedrock and a sign. This designation effectively means
there is no starport.

	Very fascinating and detailed analysis; definitely a keeper. I like it a
lot ... for a full scale invasion. Again, I\'m trying to make Jump Troops
work with the classic Heinlein-style limited hit & run strike, with *NO*
collateral damage. That prohibits extensive sabotage, EMPs, nukes, LZ prep
via submunitions, etc. The first indication the locals should have is a
bunch of megacephalic steel gorillas rampaging through downtown. Have you
read "Starship Trooper?"

A few comments about the full-scale invasion scenario, though.

	Reentry kit suffers from all the problems of jump troops ...

>H -45 minutes: all troops will be in jump capsules and rigged for high
>acceleration, all of the tasks forces will begin high-g deceleration to

	Make this about H-10: You don\'t need to begin your deceleration NEARLY
this early. If you\'re coming in on a highly hyperbolic orbit (10 minutes
flight time from 3 million kilometers out), you only need approximately 5
minutes to decelerate. Which means, if you\'re properly stealthed, you\'ve
cut the enemy\'s warning time from 45 to 10 minutes.

>H -20 minutes: If commandos were deployed, they strike now. They will

	Keep this the way it is--just as everybody\'s getting into an uproar over
the sabotage, before anybody\'s had a chance to put everything together and
suspect an invasion, the fleet starts its decel.

>H -15 minutes: The pre-fired nukes will detonate in the ionosphere,

	Change this to H-10: Just as the decel starts, ground-based sensors are
blinded.

>H -5 minutes: The groups fire a series of \'dummy\' pods. Some are active

	I\'d also mix the dummy pods in with the actual launch, say, one in five.

>H +15 minutes: Follow-on forces begin to jump in-system. Since jump

	Which I haven\'t modeled yet, but it\'s coming ...

>and surrounded by countermeasures, intercepting pilots will be faced
>with thousands of small, fast targets moving towards their worst enemy
>(the ground). They can\'t get weapons lock, can\'t communicate with base

	Talking to some IR sensor experts (Bruce Macintosh, for example), I think
the pod heat signature would be fairly easy to lock on. Yes, you\'ll have
decoys--shoot\'em all and let the intel guys sort out the pieces on the ground.

	How to overcome the heat signature: Good thermal isolation between the
reentry shell, and the next shell in--once you\'re below a certain speed,
jettison what\'s left of the heat shield.

	I must have missed them.

Well maybe a bit about the background... Will it be compatible to 
Traveller, maybe as a far off world somewhere in a rift, created by 
the ancients for social studies...
How it\'s different from the usual fantasy gamees and such...

I had responded to this question a while back suggesting that 
incidental expenses be taken from a character using the MT rule 
(Cr250 x SS per month;  MTPM page 30).

Last night, I was taking advantage of the holiday by preparing for my 
game coming up next Sunday when I realized that what I was doing 
would be a good example of whittleing away a character\'s funds.

My point here is that there is a lot of little charges that happen to 
a character in just day to day living.  He\'s not always on the ship, 
and I\'m sure that his money will evaporate as he ventures into the 
local startown or city.  Not every piece of gum that a character buys 
needs to be role played, and I think the MT rule provides a good 
abstract rule to cover these expenses.

In prepping for my game last night, though, I noticed how I sometimes 
add to a character\'s expenses by just getting creative.

We are playing the Traveller Adventure and my characters are on 
Pysadi.  Pysadi, as you may or may not know, has a tainted atmosphere 
and is very low tech.  The text in the adventure states that TL 3 
filter masks are available for Cr10.

In my game, I continue the tradition DGP started by having one 
equipment sheet for each piece of equipment a character carries.  It 
helps players organize their stuff, see what they have, and visualize 
each piece of equipment their character has.

I\'ve got a template, and it just takes me a minute to enter a quick 
description about the piece of equipment and print it out.  Next 
game, I\'ll have these available for the characters to buy.

How I got creative with it was that I detailed, on the equipment 
sheet, how the filter mask works.  There\'s this round filter (if 
you\'ve got the Traveller Book, check out the filter mask drawing on 
page 107--that\'s my model) that fits into a screw holder on the front 
of the mask.

A chemical agent must be used in conjunction with the filter to 
clean the Pysadian air.  This is called "cleaner", and it comes in 
squeeze bottles that cost Cr1 and contain 10 applications.  Likewise, 
the filters become dirty and must be replaced weekly.  They come in 
packages of 10 costing Cr1 for the package.

Now, I know that this is not a lot of cost to the characters, but it 
is something.  By doing this with the masks, I\'ve done two things.  
I\'ve made them a little more interesting and "Pysadian specific", but 
I\'ve also put just a little more strain on the character\'s finances.

I think that too many times, only the big items that characters need 
get bought, and the character is allowed to carry on with this bank 
account the same for weeks on end.

I wish I could do that in real life.  Even if my meals were free and 
I paid no rent, there are plenty of other things that consume my 
funds.  This is why I like the MT rule.  Using that, and occasionally 
getting creative with a piece of equipment or other character cost 
(I\'ll whittle them away with costs for computer terminal use, air 
taxes, and other planet specific charges), keeps characters having to 
work to provide income--just like in real life.

BTW, if anybody is interested in this equipment sheet for your 
players, I\'ll make it available to you.  It is done in Word v2.0, but 
you can import it to v6.0 or \'97.

Just contact me if you want the sheet.  I\'ve got human and vargr 
versions of the mask.  You\'ll get three files--one for the front of 
the human mask, one for the front of the vargr mask, and a back page 
for notes that can be used for either.

Kenneth.

PS  I\'ve released a few other sheets to the list.  If you want them

Andy,

I have all five of the programs I can try and email them to if you would
like? They are all between a megabyte and and a megabyte 1/4. They are pc
dos .exe files. I have:

OldExpan.exe   1.16mb
Spinward.exe   1.16mb
Reft.exe       1.06mb
Diaspora.exe   1.18mb

Like the kN fix. Keep the abbreviation consistent, though.

Questions:
Table 2:
	Why is there no drag penalty for VTOL, but there is one for STOL? Why
is there no penalty for amphib/seaplane option, but there is one for
floatplane?

Table 6:
	Prices should be converted to MCr for consistency\'s sake.

Copy errorrs <sp> :

All errors are listed in page/line/word format.

5/5/17 	"requier" --> require
5/19/3  "fir" --> fire
5/9/12 	"cremmeber" --> crewmember
5/14/14 "air-toground" --> air-to-ground

Table 3 - left column - "Propellor" --> Propeller
			note: this may be a case of variant spelling. my 			spell checker
picked it up.
Table 7 - legend - "accelleration" --> acceleration

Clarification:
	I believe the cargo section should be ammended to read that each tonne
of mass carried as _external_ cargo cause 10 points of drag, rather than
all cargo, which is how it reads now.


airships.doc

Note:
	I believe this should be merged with the regular aircraft section. All
sections duplicated therefrom contained the same copy errors. I only
found one more:

Table 6 - TL4 Outboard Wing hardpoin_g_ --> hardpoint


gaussgun.txt

Note: 
	I liked the efficency changes, where barrel performance is concerned.
Makes sense to me.

My only gripe is the battery weight. I was designing a TL12 6mm bullpup
carbine, firing at 2000 mps. The weapon itself massed only 1.894 kilos,
but the battery weighed in at over 2.7! After examining the battery
table for the gauss weapons and comparing it to the one in the
Power.doc, I came to the conclusion that the gauss batteries were based
on a 1 second discharge time, within 10% or so. I did some calculating
and came up with a more exact list of figures.

TL  		Divisor

10		 89992
11		112491
12		168737
13		179986
14		224982
15		269978
16		314975
17		359971
18+		229964

	I think a note should be added in this section of the design sequence,
explaining that the figures were derived from the battery tables based
on a 1 second discharge time. This will prevent the sort of arguments /
complaints I saw about the previous battery figures. Personally, I\'ll
probably end up using .36 second discharge time batteries in my designs,
and taking the hit in price and recoil. I just have this thing about
lugging around magazines which weigh more than my weapon.

	I\'m afraid that\'s as far as I\'ve gotten. If anyone is interested, I\'ll
post the carbine design -- with BOTH magazine designs. :-)

 Possibly no more than a company that is in the throes of

 And that appears to have again been the case, with the latest
 offer from IG to honestly listen to our suggestions on
 what we would like to see in the combined FS/M:0 rerelease -
 essentially, a request to know how we would correct the flaws
 that have caused such an uproar.  The quick response in this
 case and the last is one of the reasons I\'m willing to consider
 as a possibility what I suggested above.

 I will also note that I am heartened by the knowledge that Marc
 has effectively retaken active creative control.  EA and (at
 first glance) PE are both quality volumes - although I\'ve
 already found that there\'s one table missing from PE.

T::>Had all the other buttons been pressed?

T::>I think yes and no. I think a great many buttons had been pressed.

 I was under the impression that there was at least one IG
 lurker on the list; I could be wrong.  If I\'m wrong, I
 shouldn\'t be - it\'s always a good thing for a company to have
 its finger on its market\'s pulse.

 However, except for the fact that there\'s a _lot_ of TML on any
 given day, I thing this is a good idea.  Given the volume, I\'d
 say that a content summary would be preferable, with an offer
 to send digests _if_IG_so_wishes_.  I think that the TML volume
 is a little too high to send the actual messages, even in
 digest form, unsolicited.

 Another thing that would be useful (and I admit to being sadly
 remiss in this area, myself) would be for people to do as I
 suggested in my long post, and send IG _calm_, _reasoned_
 e-mail and landmail explaining their position on the particular
 issue at hand.  The underlined words are key; vituperation and
 loaded language are more likely to get your message filed with
 the banana peels than with the customer feedback.

 And this concerns me, as well.  However, I get the impression
 that this also took place before the reacquisition of firm
 creative control by Marc; my gut reaction is that Marc, at
 least, will be more receptive to this.  I would recommend,
 however, that rather than everyone individually sending
 messages whenever they find a bug, that the TML or someone
 thereon keep track of the bugs that people find, and then send
 a single post that succinctly describes _all_ of the bugs
 found, and the list\'s suggestions for correction.  This has
 several advantages: It is easier to keep track of the source of
 the report; it keeps the bug list from getting permanently
 scattered to the four winds, and it give us and IG the
 opportunity to see how the bugs interact, thus suggesting some
 possible fixes.

 The second line of this last paragraph is key - IG isn\'t
 responsive.  I\'ve seen this as well; I\'ve had some problems
 myself.  I\'m more the type to do things via phone call rather
 than e-mail or landmail; to this day, SoCalBell doesn\'t have a
 411 phone listing for IG; if I don\'t have my T4 with me, I end
 up calling SweetPea. If I do have my T4 (in which I\'ve penciled
 the number), I try them first - and I have yet to reach a human
 being at that number. I always reach a human being at SweetPea,
 and while it may take more than one call, I have not yet
 _failed_ to get an issue resolved.  By _SweetPea_, not _IG_.
 This _is_ a problem.  And it\'s frustrating.

Heheheh.  Well, let\'s see.  PE is the worst product ever to hit the 
streets.  _Starships_ puts it to shame.  I\'m glad my name\'s not associated 
with it.

Oops, that\'s right, my name _is_ on it.  I\'d better back up and revise 
that review. <G>

Pocket Empires is a Traveller game, just as Snapshot, Azhanti High 
Lightning, Fifth Frontier War, Invasion: Earth, and so on were for CT.  

It allows players to control one or more worlds, running a pocket 
empire.  The engine that drives it is the economics system, which 
provides the method for generating the Gross World Product (GWP) of any 
given world (using the UWP and Economic Extension(EE); the EE consists of 
Resources, Labor, Infrastructure and Culture).  It takes into account 
supply and demand, finished goods trade, and a bunch of other goodies.  

There\'s two versions of the Economics engine: the quickie one, and the 
full-up one, both of which yield compatible results.  The quickie one is 
a figure-once-and-forget-it (unless your UWP or EE changes - if someone 
bombs you back into the stone age, your GWP will probably change<G>) 
system.  The full-up system is a figure-it-every-year system, allowing 
full control over the economy, and much greater detail.  After figuring 
the GWP, you take out the portion of it that you\'ve appropriated as 
taxes.  That becomes your governmental budget (GB).

From there, you use your GB to pay the bills (military maintenance, 
general governmental expenses (buildings, salaries, etc.)), and so on), 
buy new stuff and upgrade old stuff (starports, infrastructure, military 
units, etc.), try to influence the world\'s Culture (in an attempt to get 
them to adopt new technology quicker, for example), improve technology, 
and so on.

Beyond that, you get to worry about internal politics (maybe your cousin 
would like to kill you and assume the throne), external politics (trade 
alliances, military strikes), and a whole lot of other stuff (don\'t want 
to give the game away).

The rules for engaging in war, like the economic system, provide two 
alternatives: quick, or full-up. Quick involves a few die throws.  
Full-up is still abstract, but is much more involved and allows much more 
control - and takes a lot longer, like the full-up economic system.

All in all, if you go the quickie route, the game is easier than building 
a ship.  If you go the full-up route, it\'s about on the level with 
designing a ship (in terms of complexity).  

In addition, the game includes two new career types (Diplomat and 
Bureaucrat), several starter Pocket Empires scenarios, several standard 
Patron encounters based on the premises in Pocket Empires, rules and 
ideas for playing a standard Traveller game in the midst of the pocket 
empires, rules for making a family tree and figuring out what the 
children of two Traveller characters will be like in terms of UPP, and 
the proverbial much, much more.

It was a massive project, as you can see.  I hope you\'ll enjoy it.

Not really.  M0 Campaign\'s additional 32 pages has more information on

I don\'t know if you factored this in, but...

Couldn\'t you use the planet\'s orbital velocity to overtake the jump
capsules while the ship stays at higher speed on the pass? The ship
would be killing some of the capsules velocity in respect the planet,
and the planet would overtake the capsules.  The capsules would have
small steering rockets to get them into the atmosphere where they would
at meteoric speed, and use ablative sheilding and a series of parachutes
to slow down.  Nearing the surface the "Trooper" would be ejected from
the capsule at 40, 50, 60 g\'s and ride the rest of the way down on a
final parachute or perhaps a grav belt.

I haven\'t tried to look at the numbers, but this would seem to work
better than having the ship slow to orbital velocity and launching the
capsules at the planet.

In the Real World, paratroopers infiltrate in basically 3 ways.
1) - low \'n slow. Against targets that don\'t have the tech to spot you,
planes come in below radar and drop troopers at 215 feet. In Traveller,
this would be against an enemy without the tech to spot Thrusterplate
emissions OR don\'t have full coverage. Alternately, commandos could
knock out a \'relatively\' small sector of sensor coverage (along with
other damage) just long enough to decel, drop pods, and scoot - the
first warning would be the sound of firing retros and 250 kilos of
trooper/battle dress landing on your porch.

2) - Halo (High-Altitude, Low Opening). This is where a high-flying
plane on a commercial route and time-table has a few squads jump at
about 20,000+ feet (with warmsuits and oxy); they fall and open their
chutes at about 250 feet and land. They depend upon inattention,
boredom, and a small radar signature to land safe. In traveller, this
might be done by a modified large freighter - it looks like a freighter,
acts like a freighter, and (quietly, away from much direct scanning)
launches an assault team while \'approaching upstation\'. If its near the
end of third watch over an unsuspecting world in the middle of the
night, the first anyone notices might be when the pickup ship enters
atmosphere so they can LEAVE. If nothing else, confusion of exactly what
is going on, where, and why will buy the troopers time, maybe a great
deal of it.
3) - Haho (High-Altitude, High-Opening); This is when a plane far away
from the objective has troopers jump at high altitude and open their
parasails almost immediately. They then glide to their target. In the
Real World their are rumors of 20+ mile glides where the commandos
jumped over the ocean in international waters and landed 12 miles
inland! In Traveller, this is how I envision the crazie... uh, most
elite squads infiltrate planets. A ship drops a strike team near the
world so that their trajectory will take them to a proper orbit the next
DAY. They are in modified vac suits with long-term survival pods
attached. They spend 24+ hours drifting into an orbit that allows them
to use low-power retros on special re-entry kits to drop (they will
ditch the survival kits as they approach). Although as dangerous as
anything I can imagine, this does have some advantages: There are only
going to be 6-18 objects falling (\'can\'t be jump troops - there are only
9 of \'em\'); several of the objects (the survival kits) will obviously
burn up on approach; the rest will mass less than a jump pod; and there
is no obvious drop ship (\'hasn\'t been an outside ship in orbit for 4-5
days\'). HOPEFULLY, they only have to survive reentry, if not - well, I\'m
sure they get hazardous duty pay. [I assume these are the guys who are
honor grads from Commando school and get into a recon team in a special
forces unit. You know, crazies :)]

I have read Starship Troopers many times, but I always though R.A.H.s
idea of a Mobile Infantry hit-and-run was smoking a city the size of
Atlanta and leaving while the dust was still settling :>

Actually, anybody have a rough approximation of how much a Imperial 
Credit (Classic Traveller era, preferred) would be worth in terms of US 
Dollars?

Also, I figure on using a decimal system for Credits. Anybody ever come 
up with neato designations for each bill/coin equivalent (Cleons, Cleon

Got Pocket Empires in the mail Saturday, a very pleasant surprise indeed! 
(Especially since IG screwed up my order for Emp\'s Arse so badly it took 
me two months to unscrew it!)

The only mistake I\'ve noticed so far is the back cover text. One word is 
split (when it could have been left whole), leading to some strange 
formatting...plus it appears that the last sentence might be incomplete! 
I hope that more care is taken in the future, this was the second thing I 
looked at (the first was the cover, usual Foss artwork) and I noticed it 
right away!

The book itself was absolutely **not** what I expected. I was expecting a 
supplement along the lines of M0, i.e., here\'s the situation in several 
pocket empires outside the young Third Imperium. Instead what we get is a 
complete and independent game, with year-long turns, set on a sector (or 
larger) scale. I\'m guessing the intention was to generate adversaries for 
the Third Imperium to run into, but I can see running this as a game, 
maybe PBEM style, with players submitting one turn/week...letting an 
alternate history grow.

Great job folks! Can\'t wait to see the next installment from this design 
team. 

Now for MWM\'s next contribution--will it be T4 Mark 2 or will it be 
Anomalies? Personally I would like to see a good volume of adventures 
first...

..and I\'d like to see how long it takes my subscription copy of JTAS#26 
to arrive, sigh!

Take care and keep the flame burning (but don\'t let it blow up into flame 
wars!)

Due to studying for comprehensive exams and other responibilities I have
not been part of any Traveller list for about a year (x-boat quite
sending and I really disn\'t have time anyway)....but now that things
have cleared up a bit, I have just resubscibed to this list (yeahhhh!)
Unforunately, it seems I signed on just a bit too late to catch some
really good stuff and I was wondering if anyone could send it privately
to me or at least give me digest numbers so I can dig them up in the FTP
archives.  I signed on just as the last flame-war was cresting and began
to subside (at least that aspect of the list hasn\'t changed--oh well)
and I have heard reference to KBv2.0 for combat rules and everyone was
talking about "Valentine Rose" (an adventure?).  Anyway, what I am
looking for is KBv2.0 and mods that other TMLers have made to it and
whatever was posted for Valentine Rose.  I don\'t want to clog the list
with reposts so if someonne could send to tomt@scri.fsu.edu I sure would
appreciate it.

Second, I just had a thought about the "jump troop" discussion:

I may be missing something (forgive me if this is true) but it seems
that for whatever reason, the ship lauching the jump troops was not
detected jumping into the system.  Given that, how about a sneakier,
long term approach.  Create a pod that contains your marines in cold
sleep and power for a few months.  Insert inside a small asteroid (so
that sensors will just see "a rock")  Let the pod go on a coarse that
makes it look like an incoming meteor from the far reaches of the
system.  As the "meteor" approaches the atmosphere have it shed its
rocky covering allowing it to use its atmospheric breaking, thrusters,
and whatever else.  A small computer begins waking your troops at some
point during all this.  Then procede as with normal jump troop
insertion, but hopefully with quite a bit of surprise.  

This is just an idea for people to play with/shoot down/whatever...I was
just putting it out for discussion.  Would such an insertion device be
so large that an impact scare would raise even more alarm at an earlier
time.....

Anyway...Its great to be back on the list.  I look forward to
interacting with you all again

Thanks

Ok, so your trying to do a surgical incersion, like, the SAS being droped
behind Iraq lines or when the US special op\'s dropped on Panamas
dictator, right?

That changes the game.  Perhaps Jump Troops are not the best option?
Bringing in SpecialOps on a commercial flight or trade vessel may be
better?  Don\'t know enougth about Traveller military ops to comment.

Actually, PE is set up for play as a game.  It\'s certainly usable to 
create background - and, in fact, I think that\'s one suggested use in the 
book - but the primary thrust was to create something for people to play 
on a grand scale.  And yes, it is particularly well suited to PBM or 
PBEM. :)

MWM\'s next contribution will be T4.1, AFAIK.

Anomalies is ten separate adventures, half of which are linked within an 
ongoing story. It\'s designed by Steve Miller and Duane Maxwell. (This 
info comes from JTAS 26, BTW, which goes into a bit more detail.)

Good tactics.  Which got me thinking, what would be the counter measure,
assuming the defender had no Space Navy (destroyed?) and the JTroopers
made it to the ground using the scenario you described.

Do what the Germans planed to do, but failed to execute correctly during
DDay - send in the Armoured units.   The problem with Jtroops/para is they
have very limited supplies - there is only so much they can carry at any
one time, making their long term survivability limited without backup.

Also, the moment word had gotten out that JTroopers had landed in force
over three target city\'s, I would have my meson cannons pointing into the
sky and any Air Factors patrolling for troop transports, in an attempt to
knock them out before landing.

What is the focus of the game?  What is the setting like, what makes it

I see two problems with this.  First, on a world where they have a
reasonable tech level they would propably be quite familiar with meteor
patterns in and around their space.  Second, what types of side effects
would the troopers have from such a long hibernation.  I can not believe
they could go into a month long slumber and be combat ready in the
matter of hours or even a few days.

In order to avoid my second point, an asteroid large enough probably
would create such a scare, but as to which is better......  Attack while
no one expects or when everyone is expecting something worse.  Hmmm,
interesting situation.  Any thoughts, anyone?

No, but there\'s a description of CT era Imperial credits (hard cash

If you wish, I\'ll post the entry for you.

On an interesting note, I can really grasp the concept of how WWI 
started.  I used it as an anology in explaining to my players (who 
are not on this list) how the great Flame War of \'97 got started.

My "Burn, baby, burn" was the bullet that killed Archduke Ferdinand.  
The ally system took over after that.  Pretty soon, it was in 
nobody\'s hands and took on a life all its own.

Well, there, ya see--something good did come out of the Flame Fest.  
I learned to comprehend something better.

I\'m playing the Traveller Adventure right now.  It\'s set in the 
Aramis subsector.  I can relate those red zones to you.

Red Zones--

Corfu.  Interdicted by the Imperium as a quarantine measure.  
Approximately forty years ago, a virulent, crippling disease appeared 
and has since come to affect 5% of the population.  No cure for the 
disease is yet known, although some treatments have been found to 
relieve some of its effects.  The Imperial Scout Service maintains a 
surveillance post in the system and is working to find a cure.  In 
the interim, access to the world is prohibited.

Zykoca.  An agricultural world under interdiction.  Local society is 
extremely xenophobic, and all contact offworld has been suspended.  
Foreigners are distrusted and have no standing in local society.  The 
world was interdicted after a local mob broke into the starport, 
killing several offworlders.

Lewis.  An interdicted world holding the estates of the Tukera 
family.


These are the only three Red zones in the Aramis subsector.  If you 
would like, I\'ll list the info regarding the Amber zones as well--but 
I don\'t want to type all of that unless it is helpful to you.

I am hoping that the TML-FS Project will never become a reality.  
From Tim Brown\'s request, which was referred to the list by Dave 
Golden, and Marc\'s recent post on the FS data, it looks like IG will 
fix the FS data by themselves.

And trust me, that\'s a good thing--and IG\'s place to do it.

If they don\'t though, the TML-FS Project has grown from two people 
(me and Michael) to over 20 volunteers!

That\'s really a good sign.  People on this really care about 
Traveller.  

And it is great to note that, just after the Great Flame War of \'97, 
all of these people have banded together and committed their time for 
the good of the game.

That really says something to me about how people feel.

IG, if you are listening, many of us get emotional about Traveller, 
and we are defensive when we perceive that bad decisions are made 
about the game.

But, you\'ve got to realize that this is a good thing.  It may not 
seem so at times, but what you\'ve got at your disposal is a bunch of 
people on this list that really want to see Traveller succeed.

We are your core customers, and we love the game.

If I was a manufactuer and saw those types of people, I\'d thank my 
lucky stars--customers who crave what I make.

We\'ll be on your side and defend you to the end as long as we think 
that you are doing something good for Traveller.

You should use this to your advantage.  Although I see improvement in 
IG, what I really want is to refer to IG in the same way I refer to 
DGP.

From some of your products--the EA, for instance, I see indications 
of that.  But, you\'ve got to earn that place in our hearts.

You\'ve got some things to overcome from past products, but I gurantee 
you that if we see a string of EA quality products, the past growing 
pains will be all but forgotten.

I, for one anyway, am willing to let you try.

[snippage]

As the ship\'s velocity relative to the target planet is the only velocity
that \'matters\' in this context, this idea doesn\'t end up being meaninful.
The planet overtaking the capsules from a faster-moving ship is just the
same casules moving toward the stationary planet from a slower-moving
ship, viewed from a different inertial frame of reference.

Yummmmm...that\'s my favorite recipe for "Mashed Jump-Trooper in the

Ken, I use this rule of thumb: 

At home.......5cr*SS per day
Travelling...10cr*SS per day 

SS is NOT the character\'s actual social class, it is the level at which
he/she is living right now.  This way a down on his luck noble can rough
it at a lower level, and a low class prospecter that\'s hit the mother
load can live it up on his windfall.

Additionally, this is a little lower than the MT rule for
stay-at-homes, and a little higher for Travellers.  That\'s as it should
be.  ;->

You might want to check out the amount of money an average PC would
spend per month this way.  I really think 4-6KCr/month is too high a
salary for ship crew, half that would be more realistic I think.

> PPS  Eris, I know that you already want the sheet.  It\'s on the way!

Yes, I do, and here it is! ;-> Thanks Ken.

For those of you who don\'t look at the IG web site very often, they have
just posted an update on their news page. It talks about the M0/FS problem,
delays with Pocket Empires, and when they are planning on releasing the
next few items (Anomalies, Psionics Institutes, and The Long Way Home are
due to be released on the 31st of May. T4.1 will be released in August).
Also, people ordering the M0/FS book via internet will get a $3 discount
(ie: $26.95), as will people on the pre-order plan.

Just thought people would like to know.

(Of course, knowing my luck the info will be posted to the TML, and get
through before my message does. Then won\'t I look silly. Oh well.)

Cheers,
Jason

Lethality went way down with improved evacuation methods.  Since a wounded
man is know often withing minutes of a surgical unit, his chances of
surviving what would have been fatal damage just a few years ago have gone
way up.

I don\'t know Craig, don\'t ejection seats normally opearte at over 40g\'s? 
You couldn\'t give \'em more than a second or two, though.

The reason I brought up using the planet\'s orbital velocity, was because
it looked like everybody was assuming the ship would decellerate into an
orbit and then launch the capsules at the planet.  It seemed more
reasonable for the ship to fly past and launch the capsules back along
the path of the planet\'s orbit..ie decelerating the capsules.  Don\'t
expect to be doing this in Akus, Craig ;->

It has always been my assumption that jump troops (or as I call them, Rapid
Interface Troops) could be dropped during the battle, since deploying them
doesn\'t require extensive use of small craft.

A drop ship scoots into a minimum-time orbit, blows off a company of
Marines, and gets out.  Those Marines establish a beach-head, and in
general cause as much chaos and disruption as possible.

Once on the ground, the J-troops are basic infantry, even with the
advantages of battledress and plasma weapons.  If they aren\'t supported
quickly, they\'ll die.

Exactly.  In a planetary invasion scenario, j-troops would be limited to
making the initial assult to seize a secured landing zone for the follow-on
heavy forces.  Of course, supply could be maintained at a minimal level by
cargo drops from orbit, but it would be chancy.

Once again, in a planetary invasion scenario, I\'m not going to commit my
landing force unless I have a good chance of suceeding.  I don\'t have to
land at your gates, just as long as I have a place where I can bring down
the Army\'s heavy divisions in relative safety.

Doug tries to focus.. after four days at BayCon (lesson 1: don\'t go to the

For the Lunion Subsector (these are from my own campaign, be warned.)

Penkwhar

Home to a small human culture (one city of around 3000 permanent residents
is known, total population is probably in the millions.)

These humans are not associated with any known colony effort, and seem to
be Vilani!  The IISS interdicted Penkwhar in the early 700s in order to
inestigate this anomoly.

Gorram

Homeworld of a violently xenophobic race, Gorram is interdicted by the Navy.

Shirene (Amber)

Many animals on this world carry Turner\'s Syndrome, a rabies-like
infection.  There is no cure, and most sufferers are put to death before
the final stages of the disease, which features murderous rages and other
psychotic behavoir.

Your wish is my command, sahib.  (Why does this thread start while I\'m at
BayCon?  Sheesh!)

I\'ve been playing around with a 300-ton Marine drop ship.. carries one
platoon of Marines (48 men), and can drop them all in a 15 minute window.
This doesn\'t look like a military vessel on the sensors, so you have to get
real close to ID it.

The ship settles into orbit, and launches the Marines along with the dummy
pods, an EMS jammer, and any other toys needed for the mission.  At the
same time, the pinnace undocks and statrts setting up for the recovery.

The Marines blow their shells at 30,000 ft (assuming Earth-like atmospheric
pressure) and proceed to do a HALO onto the target.  Modern day Airborne
can hit a ten foot target when jumping from this height, so I don\'t see why
the Marines would be any different.

Once down, the Marines would proceed to cause shit to occur, in great
quantities.  Each Marines would have his copy of the op order downloaded,
and his BD\'s HUD would provide targeting information, a time
elapsed/recovery countdown clock, and a mission status display.

Pick-up is the riskiest element, since a large vessel has to land and hold
still long enough for the Marines to board.  Once aboard, the recovery
vessel initiates the "getting the hell out of here" maneuver, and
rendezvous with the transport, which should already be leaving orbit.

Total time on the ground: less than one hour.

I fudge the SS a little too if the character is not living at his

    Now THIS is an excellent idea.  Pardon me if this has been suggested
before, I\'m using the long weeked to catch up on back Digests of the List.
However... Why don\'t we tell ALL of IG\'s people with e-mail addresses of our
displeasure at their current policies?  AND I DON\'T MEAN MAILBOMB OR HATE MAIL
THEM!
    Sorry, that point had to made loudly a clearly, some people require a 2x4
between the eyes to get their attention and all of that!
    What would be effective would be each of us POLITELY, and I know that\'s
going to be the most difficult part of this process, but Politely informing
them that they are pissing off their established customer base and for what
reasons.  I have friends who run a small Game Store and they have taken the
time in the past to point out to me how the whole system of getting the Game
from the Publisher to the Store works.  It\'s quite possible (the only
reasonable explaination IMHO) that the people in Imperium Games are not aware
of the level of discontent in the customer base.
    Think about it before you flame me.  They (Imperium Games) deal primarily
with the Distributors, and Distributors are concerned with getting the product
from point A (Publisher) to point B (Game Store) and making a profit while
doing that.  At no time in this process does the Distributor CARE about what
the actual Gamers think about the Game!  And before you point out that they
should be monitoring TML here!  Think about it ;) Joe had to go to them and
VOLUNTEER to be their Net Rep, except for a couple of posting by Marc himself
making corrections or testing out ideas the last of which was months ago BTW.
    So the case could well be made that the people at Imperium just are no
hearing us.  I know that sounds idiotic, especially in light of what\'s being
said here, but if they aren\'t subscribed... they simply don\'t hear it.  And
even if someone mentions us occassionally we are easily dismissed as just a few
disgruntaled customers.  HOWEVER, fifty... sixity... seventy or more e-mails to
the right people Is Not Dismissable, it\'s a clear indication they\'ve got a
major problem!  Why?

    A happy customer MAY tell 3 people, IN THEIR LIFETIME that they liked a
specific product or service.

    An Unhappy customer WILL tell a MINIMUM of 10 people within a WEEK of their
decision that the product or service made them Unhappy.  More people as time
passed for the rest of their lives until the problem is addressed to their
satisfaction!

    Worse!  The Unhappy Customer who actually TELLS THE COMPANY that they\'re
unhappy represents 10 to 20 OTHER UNHAPPY CUSTOMER who haven\'t tried to reach
the company yet.

    I\'m not making this up BTW for the skeptical, this has been so well proven
it\'s now a principle of marketing a public relations. ;) Do the math, it gets
frightening FAST which is why major, and these days even minor, companies worry
about customer relations and/or perception.  The only companies that can ignore
customer unhappiness are monopolies, like MicroShlock FoEx.  Those that don\'t,
DIE.

    THUS  50... 60... 70... or more people taking the time to Find Their E-mail
Addresses and communicate their displeasure (as only we TMLer\'s have
demonstrated that we can ;) means that there are 500... 600... 700... seriously
unhappy customers out there.  Worse!  That means between 5,000 to 14,000
potential customers have been given Bad Press about T4 and Imperium Games (I\'ll
call them IG from now on.)  Even worse is the dynamics of the Gaming Customer
Base IG is trying to sell to, we talk to each other AND we ask each other\'s
opinions of new games.  I suspect the number of Gamers who have heard Bad Press
about T4 an IG is even higher, and the Gaming market IG is trying to sell to is
rather select and small, not to mention vocal.
    Thus IMHO if IG personel start getting dozens of polite e-mails telling
them they are fucking up and fucking over their customer base.  They will
either...

    1) Change and start doing thing right (PLEASE GOD!) or at LEAST start
talking to us. (The MINIMUM smart move.)

    2) Tell us to fuck off...
       At which point we all just sit back and see who gets the Rights to
Traveller next, \'cause this is Marc Miller\'s Last Chance. ;)

    That\'s my suggestion.  The reality here is that we\'re all just preaching to
the Choir here on the List.  I don\'t post much, but I am part of the larg
silent majority of Lurkers and not subscribed Traveller Player who is Extremely
Disappointed with T4 and what\'s followed.  Let\'s stop venting to each other and
pissing each other off because nothing gets done.  Let\'s go to the source hmm?

Whoa! "Release of radiation" is *not* the same as "be[ing] radioactive".
As an example, if I zap you with X-rays, you\'ll have been exposed to
radiation, but there is no radioactivity involved.

Even allowing for the semi-magical nature of what Traveller calls
"mesons", induced radioactivity seems unlikely. So the ship *won\'t* be
radioactive, but there will be a burst of radiation when the meson
burst goes off.

> Could anyone please give me information on the level of

Half-life only applies to radioactive materials. So it won\'t apply here.

Some percentage of the energy will be released as radiation. I don\'t
believe that any of the books give a figure for this. 

> This has to do with a boarding party entering a damaged vessel.

Then there\'s nothing to worry about as the meson gun doesn\'t make
things radioactive. The only radiation is *as* it goes off.

This rule is both broken in itself (Think about it: the difference in cost of 
living between the two lowest levels of society is 100% while the difference 
between two adjacent high levels is 10% or less; if that had been reversed it 
would make a lot more sense) and not compatible with the costs of food and 
lodging given in CT (and T4). Starvation level is Cr150 per month and 
subsistence level is Cr450 per month. But average, ordinary living can be had 
for Cr600 per month (This is based on the assumption that roughly the same 
amount of money is used on food, lodging, and basic necessities. Check your
budget. Dosen\'t it fit fairly well?). So an average citizen (SL 7) should
use Cr600 for food, lodging and basic necessities and Cr1150 for luxuries?
1/3 of dispoosable income for basics and 2/3rds for luxuries? Not in Denmark, 
anyway and I doubt it is the case in the US either. 

Back in 1779 one credit was worth about one US dollar. Today it is closer to 
between 1.5 and 2 dollars.

Here\'s my suggestion for an economic system that is fairly consistent with
Classic Traveller:


                        Basic economics for Traveller
                        =============================

Prices are expressed in local "credits". 1 credit (Cr) is one hour\'s pay for 
an unskilled worker regardless of what the local coinage is called. Imperial 
currency is called "Credits, Imperial" (Crimp) and can be (often is) worth
more than local credits since these depends on the economic strength of the
individual world. See _Trillion Credit Squadron_ page 32 about exchange 
rates. Crimps are worth the same as the credits of a world with a Class A
starport and the maximum TL of the Imperium  --  12 in the Year 0, 15 in
1105, etc.

Note: The credits are what is left over after taxes and after accounting for
dependents. If taxes are 50% then an unskilled worker would actually be paid
2 credits per hour. If the average earner supports 3 dependents he would get
4 credits (after taxes) and so on.


INCOME

Income usually depends on how respected an occupation is in the local 
society. Decide what social standing most practitioners of an occupation 
would have. The average salary for a competent, fully qualified member of 
that occupation can then be determined from the tabel below. Remember to 
adjust for taxes and usual number of dependents, counting one child as 1/2
a dependent.

   SS     Hour     Day       Month     Year
    1     0,9        9        225      2700
    2     1,2       12        300      3600
    3     1,6       16        400      4800
    4     2,0       20        500      6000
    5     2,4       24        600      7200
    6     2,9       29        725      8700
    7     3,4       34        850     10200
    8     4,0       40       1000     12000
    9     4,6       46       1150     13800

Incomes for social standings 10+ are highly individualistic and more or less
impossible to give general rules for.
 
Also note that though the correlation between social standing and income is
high, it is not 1. Some societies may pay well for having jobs considered
socially demeaning performed. Some religious figures may be poorly paid yet
highly respected, etc. Other considerations may also play a part. In pre-
industrial societies mercenaries are for example usually a lot more expensive 
than regular soldiers before and during campaign season, but can often be 
hired for little more than room and board during winter.


LIVING EXPENSES

Inn or hotel accomodations        day/week
  Common room                      2 / 10
  Bad room                         4 / 20
  Medium room                      8 / 40
  Good room                        2 /100

  Breakfast                     1 /   2  / 3
  Lunch                         2 /   3  / 4
  Dinner                        3 /   6  /15
  Banquet                       - /  20  /60
  Full board/per day            5 /  10  /20
Local booze      
  Low alcohol, mug             0.5/   1  /1.5
  Medium alcohol, glass        0.5/   1  / 2
  High alcohol, shot           0.5/   1  / 2
Imported booze
  Medium alcohol, glass         - /   3  /7.5
  High alcohol, shot            - /   3  / 7 


LONG-TERM SUBSISTENCE (per month)

  Starvation level: Minimum food, Cr60. Dismal lodging, Cr60. Minimum 
necessities, Cr30.
  Subsistence level: Reasonable food, Cr150. Acceptable lodging, Cr150. 
Bare necessities, Cr150.
  Ordinary level: Good food, Cr200. Good lodging, Cr200. Basic necessities,
Cr200.
  Good living: Fine food, Cr400. Fine lodging, Cr400. Necesseties and 
comforts, Cr400.
  High living: Luxury food, Cr600. Luxury lodging, Cr600+. Necessities and
luxuries, Cr600+.

As a rule of thumb it can be assumed that a person can just keep up a life-
style that fits his social status for SS+2 * 50 credits per month (Ie. a 
person with SS 1 needs Cr150, one with S 2 needs Cr200, etc. Of these money
2/3rds goes to food and lodging and the rest to other stuff (clothes and 
other necessities and comforts). It is customary to use more if one can
afford it. The average upkeep for a given SS is roughly SS*10% more than 
the minimum.

Note that SS 0 is not included in this system since SS 0 are slaves and don\'t
pay for their own upkeep (also remember that slavery is forbidden in the
Imperium).


SS       Upkeep
     Minimum  Average
 1     150      175 
 2     200      250
 3     250      325 
 4     300      425 
 5     350      525 
 6     400      650
 7     450      775 
 8     500      900
 9     550     1050 
10     600     1200  

Above SS 10 upkeep is highly individualistic and difficult to generalize
about.

While travelling upkeep is +20% in rural areas, +50% in urban areas and
+100% in artificial environments (space stations, etc.)

Clothes

Clothes are usually accounted for in the basic living expenses, but if a 
character needs to acquire clothes in unusual circumstances (like as part 
of a disguise or to replace a ruined set) here are some prices:

Rags                   20
Rough/well used        40
Common/a little used   60
Good                  200
Fine                  600
Elegant               800
Extravagant          1000

Note: Prices for clothes (especially finery) can easily vary by from -20 to 
+50% depending on how many or how few frills are traditional in the local 
culture.

	I believe that the actual divisor should be 10000, not 1000. The figure
in FF&S was .0006, which is 1/10000 of 6, not 1/1000. That gives you an
unloaded magazine mass of .115 kg, and a loaded mass of 0.2782 kg. These
figures are for the magazine only, of course.

I am not sure how we should go about it...
As Marc proposed it, we should mail him so he could send us the data.
I already have it. There are some new problems with the data and we 
are supposed to fix them, look them over.
Maybe we should create a new list for this purpose, so we can discuss 
the data in detail without wasting TML-bandwidth...

I\'m not sure that guass weapons and lasers will increase the lethality of
combat, as modern weapons are already pretty lethal. High energy weapons
OTOH, would be quite messy.

   Is it only a factor of 0.001 efficient?  You /can/ alter trust into
   power using the work equation W = F*d and a generator.  Otherwise,
   what you say is true, but the effects you point out are too small to
   account for the HUGE discrepancy.

   Yes, but you can have a separate, smaller manuever drive that you can
   use without interfering with your main drive that will generate far
   more power for you than an equally sized, canonical, Trav power
   plant.  It\'s power to weight ratio will be on the order of 1000 times
   greater.

   I think I understand what you are getting at, but these technical
   details can be overcome by using two rockets ---- one for thrust, one
   for power.  The scale of the discrepancy is too big and too valuable
   to be hampered by these details.  The incentive for overcoming these
   difficulties is great enough that engineers will work hard to work
   around them.  

   You can imagine, for instance, strapping two small M-drives to a
   pinwheel on the nose of your ship, and using it to crank a generator. 
   Heavy? Sure! But it still has a higher power to weight ratio than a
   cononical power plant.  This idea is just of the top of my head. 
   Imagine what a real engineer might come up with given such an
   incentive to do so.

   Imagine sticking some guns on a pinwheel attached to a generator.
   This will make power.  Sure, it will defeat the purpose of the guns,
   but if you could use this to generate power 1000 times more efficiently
   than a standard generator, wouldn\'t you do it, even if it did "waste"
   a couple of guns?  In real life, of course, such a generator would be
   ridiculously inefficient, so no one will ever build one, but in Trav,
   an M-drive pinwheel would be better than any power plant otherwise
   available.  In a hard-SF universe, they would be used all the time,
   unless something even better came along, but in canon, there is
   nothing better.

   So dedicate one.  It will be better than anything available in
   Starships, HG, Striker, or FFS.

   I\'m not really familiar with this drive.  I actually  don\'t read much
   SF, so it wouldn\'t be surprising if my definition was not very
   useful for literary classification.

   Thanks for the input, but the point is probably moot since my number

   to an equation that a physicist can understand.  Thanks Leonard!

Well, anything you care to tell us about this. I\'m a little curious about
this project of yours, and even if could be considered Off-Topic, I thing
that many others would not mind a little description of the game (world,
rules and so on).

I was reading through Wired and stumbled across a snippet article on "smart
guns." Apparently Colt is working on a way to require police guns to be armed
only via a transponder (worn as a ring on the trigger finger) which will need
to be in close proximity to the weapon in order to work. Colt is conducting
rigorous testing and doesn\'t forsee the product being available until after
2000. Of course in Trav, we don\'t have to wait that long. =)

I forsee this technology being made available in the form of a nanochip
transponder surgically implanted into the police officer\'s hand. It\'s use
would be available on TL A or B+ worlds. Whether or not it would be used
would depend upon the population and law level. Certainly, high pop worlds
with above average law levels would not hesitate to make sure that guns were
not usable at all by the local pop.

I leave further creative sparks on this matter to you. =)

Regretfully, we bid farewell to Chad.  I mean this sincerely, the points
he raises are the exact ones which have caused me to encourage my players
_not_ to subscribe to this list.  I copy those messages that I think
encourage their creativity and interest in the game, and do not mention
(except in passing, and as humor) the ones that rip at the game, the
gamers, or traveller as a whole.

I have often wondered if I would be so aware of, or concerned with, the
shortcomings of T4 if I had not subscribed to this list.  And if it makes
me wonder, when I\'ve played Traveller for 15 years, how does the tone of
the list affect the new players?  I\'ve read many contributers railings on
how IG was causing the downfall of Traveller, but based on what Chad has
to say...how much of the problem is the TML contributing?

And how many players, unlike Chad, just quietly wander away in the dark?

I am looking forward to fiddling with it.  I will finally be able to answer
the dread questions of how much it costs to go up a tech level, and how
many ships are in the sky on a given world.

Hopefully, I will have time to play with it soon.

I changed the designation to Rapid Interface a few years back... sounds
more military.  In the popular lexicon, "Jump Trooper" brings to mind the
same sort of iron-jawed Lee Marvin-ish hero that "Green Beret" evokes for
Americans.

This also means that every drop pod has RIP stenciled in big letters on the

We have been playing an M0 game for the last couple of months.  Before
that, we were in a RuneQuest game for a year and change, and before that,
we had a Traveller game for something like 18-20 months.  My group is down
to two players and myself, but we will likely try to find a couple more
people in the Irvine/Lake Forest, CA area eventually.

As an interesting note, one of them has been gaming with me since 85 or so.
 Kind of fun.

Oh, I have not yet had a chance to look at the PE economic rules yet.  Does
anyone have them implemented in software?  I am thinking of running them
through a few Monte Carlos to see if they can produce the Imperium, at
least on a small scale.

From what I have been seeing in the costs of various goods, cost of food
and lodging, and military pensions, a Traveller credit is about $3 (US,
1995), or so.

I have been using the rule of thumb that a TL12 Sylean SS7 person is
somewhere near 10KCr.  Since it looks like we are going to use "local
credits", with the definition of a credit being the same, but the amount of
Sylean goods it will buy being different, I am going to rule that military
pensions are paid in Sylean TL12 credits, which is why people sign up for
enlisted jobs from frontier worlds.

I have heard numbers from $10 to $1, though.  You might want to check out a
post I sent out some months ago that tried to decide how much each SS used,
normalized to the average.  Depending on your assumptions, and what chunk
of history you use, there is not much more than an order of magnitude or
two spread in the social standing scale.

I don\'t know -- at 40g a typical 220 lb (100 kg) trooper will weigh 8,800
lbs (40,000 N, 4,000 kg at 1g equivalent).  I can\'t imagine even a second
or two of this not snapping and squashing things.  But in any case, if you
can accomplish the ejection in a two seconds at 40g, just to it in twenty
seconds at 4g instead; less trooper breakage that way.

This is the model everyone\'s been using, actually, though nobody has said
so explicitly to my knowledge.  You fire the capsules \'backward\' into a
Hohmann transfer orbit (more or less) from your orbital altitude to the
surface.  The delta-v you need to give the capsule is the ship\'s orbital
velocity minus the H transfer velocity.  The point people are making is
that if the launching ship is in anything much faster than a circular
orbit, the launch tube length or acceleration required for the capsules
gets impractically high.

> Don\'t expect to be doing this in Akus, Craig ;->

I assure you, the only way I plan on travelling groundside from orbit is
on a shuttle, preferably one with beverage service en route. :)

I suppose in the far future there might be something else called Turner\'s
Syndrome, but I feel compelled to point out that, in the Real World(tm),
there\'s already a genetic disorder known as Turner\'s Syndrome. Instead of
having XY or XX chromosomes, people with Turner\'s are "X0" - they\'re born
with only an X, or (if I\'m not mistaken) with an X and a tiny, fragmentary
Y. They develop as females, but are sterile, lacking ovaries, and they do
not experience puberty without hormone injections. They may also have other
abnormalities, such as a webbed neck, fingers or toes, and epicanthic
folds. They also seem to display an unusual capacity to deal with stress
and adversity.

Turner\'s is just one of the many ways the human body can become confused
about what sex it\'s supposed to be. Other syndromes include Klinefelter\'s
(XXY), Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (XY females), XXX chromosomes
(sometimes more than three!), XXY (often resulting in some form of Down\'s
Syndrome), XYY and other combinations.(All this data courtesy _Sex Errors
of the Body_ (1968), Money.)

The convicts in the (truly awful) movie _Aliens 3_ were XYY \'supermales\'
who had been put on the prison colony because of their overly aggressive
tendencies. Prison populations do indeed have a far higher percentage of
XYY men than the general population.

I wrote up several RICE papers on Red Zone worlds in Spinward Marches.
They are located on my web page. Address is below.  The worlds are
Hexos (Red Zoned after 1120 something), Gerome, and Lewis. (I had to
write it up once I saw the name).  They are all written from a 1200
viewpoint, but contain information for running at 1120.

FTR, there\'s plenty of conditions not involving scrambling of the 23rd
chromosome, which can have similar sorts of effects -- congenital adrenal
hyperplasia, for example.  And, also FTR, Money is widely loathed by many
of his former research subjects and patients; he might be good on the
biology side, but his approach to treatment of interssexual infants has
been pretty damaging.  IMHO.

I have a spreadsheet that I used during development, but it\'s not 
anything I\'d feel comfortable sharing, as it\'s something only its

keep modifying it as the rules changed during development.

	The generator efficiency is fairly low _if_ you want to get any thrust out
of the rocket. If generator efficiencies were so high, we\'d be using rocket
generators now ...

	On this topic, almost everybody seems to say something along
the lines of "stabilize the body till it\'s shipped to the field
hospital".  But this assumes that the sole use of first aid is to
keep the soldier alive till aid comes - how about a combat philosophy
that says "keep the soldier FIGHTING till you can\'t find any bits
left of him"?  I\'m thinking of technologies like, say, battle dresses
that pinches off the blood supply to parts of the body that are
hemorraging/badly damaged, computer-monitored drug injections,
servomechanical takeover of unconscious men, etc etc? 
 
	What kind of technologies could we expect and how would it
affect combat attrition rates?  I know it wouldn\'t be very humane,
but the Imperium is vast. :)  
 
	Sorry if I just ask questions and never provide answers. ;)
 
	Would it be possible to design an \'Extremely Light Emergency
Berth\' that you can attach directly to combat armor and battle
dresses, using most of the armor\'s life support system?  I would
probably simplify battlefield first aid if you had one field medic in
light battledress just flit about the battlefield with a grav sled,
pick up fallen comrades, plugs them into the sled and carry them off.
Or if the sled would be too easy/big a target, just have the medic
carry 2 kg ELEB cubes and plug one into each damaged battle dress.
 
	I\'ll try to come up with a design and post it later this week
if anyone\'s interested. :)

    'body' => '  Rob Prior and a couple of other people have written Hypercard
  stacks for various Traveller-related purposes.  There is one
  minor problem with Hypercard stacks: people with Wintel
  systems can\'t do squat with them.

  (Yes, I know, you Mac people face the same problem with the
  wide range of DosWin software out there, but you at least have
  the SoftWindows/SoftPC kludge that has a chance of working.
  We Wintel folks don\'t have an equivalent option - and don\'t
  tell us to buy Macs; we\'ve made significant investment, and
  Macs still cost more than comparable Wintel boxen.  And
  that\'s not the issue here!)

  I think I have a shot at being able to do something about that
  particular problem, _if_ the stackwriters will offer a small
  amount of coperation in exchange.

  A number of years ago, a company called Brightbill-Roberts
  created a Hypercard-like product for character-mode DOS called
  "HyperPAD".  It was distributed as shareware.  Its current
  legal status is uncertain; the company seems to no longer be
  in existance, and I have been unable to find out who owns the
  rights to it.  I\'ve been assuming that the shareware version
  (I have both shareware and registered - the difference seems
  to be printed documentation) is still distributable, with the
  assumption that if someone turns up with the rights later on,
  payment would be appropriate.  That\'s also beside the point.

  The point is: If the stackwriters can give me enough
  information about their stacks, I can write a functionally
  equivalent PAD using HyperPAD, and make it available to the
  Wintel users.  Enough information is defined as the name and
  type of all controls on each card, plus a printout of each
  script associated with the stack, cards, and controls, plus a
  description of the actions of any default event handlers that
  can/should be assumed to exist in the HyperCard environment.
  HyperPAD doesn\'t support graphics; clickable graphics that
  aren\'t the equivalent of imagemaps would have to become
  buttons instead; such graphics should be noted.  If there are
  imagemap equivalents, we\'ll have to talk, and deal with them
  on a case-by-case basis.  I\'m willing to take a stab at it if
  the stackwriters are willing to assist as I\'ve outlined.

  Comments?  Questions?  Criticisms?  Advice?  Flames (send
  these to /dev/null, please)?  Ideas?

Why not drop some drone recovery ships which land at preset locations and
preset times?  The drones could be dropped from a carrier and could handle
3-4 marines with some heavy arms.  The signature would be small and the ship
would be highly maneuverable so it could easily evade enemy fire until
touchdown.  The drone could touch at several drop sites before giving up and
going back to the mother ship.  No problem with the big ship...

   Last week Leonard Ericson pointed me to a FAQ on sci.space where I
   could check on the relativistic acceleration formulae I posted here a
   couple of weeks ago.  I did the checking, and I got some good news
   and some bad news.


   The good news.  The two equations for relativistic travel I had
   derived are consistent with those published for the relativistic
   rocket.  Namely,

   D = (c^2/A) * (  sqrt(4+(A*T/c)^2) - 2  )
   T = (c/A) * sqrt( (A*D/c^2)*(A*D/c^2 + 4) )

   are right (according to two independent checks).  These equations
   relate the time to distance in the planetary frame assuming constant
   acceleration as experienced by the ship\'s crew.


   The bad news.  The two equations which I had taken from a statement I
   read in a book on relativity for beginners do not agree with those
   posted on the FAQ.  Namely

   D = (1/4) * A * t^2
   t = sqrt(4*D/A)

   are wrong (or at least inconsistant with the FAQ).  These equations
   relate the time as experienced by the ship\'s crew to the distance in
   the planetary frame.  So I tried deriving these formulae from first
   principles to see who was right, the book or the FAQ.  I agree with
   the FAQ.  I apologise for posting the book\'s results without checking
   them first.

   	*	*	*	*	*	*

   ERRATA:  The corrected formulae for relativistic acceleration.
   
   D = (c^2/A) * [  sqrt(4+(A*T/c)^2) - 2  ]
   T = (c/A) * sqrt( (A*D/c^2)*(A*D/c^2 + 4) )

   D = 2*c^2/A * [ cosh(A*t/(2*c)) - 1 ]
   t = 2*c/A * arccosh( 1 + A * D / (2*c^2) )

   where
   D = distance in meters
   A = acceleration in m/s^2, as experienced by the starship\'s crew
   		(1G = 10 m/s^2,  2G = 20 m/s^2,  etc.)
   t = dialated time as experienced by the starship\'s crew, in seconds
   T = undialated time as experienced by the planetary populations, in
   		seconds
   c = speed of light: 300,000,000 meters per second

   The good news (for high speed travellers).   The new formulae let you
   travel from place to place alot more quickly than the old ones do!
   Here are a few charts to make the point.  Along the top of each chart
   is the ship\'s acceleration rating.   Along the left side is the
   distance traveled in parsecs.  The body of the chart shows the time
   in years of the flight.

Exactly.  The expense of losing well trained reusable elite forces as

To believe something is to believe that it is true; therefore a reasonable
person belives each of his beliefs to be true; yet experience has taught him to
expect that some of his beliefs, he knows not which, will turn out to be false.
A resonable person belives, in short, that each of his beliefs is true and that
some of them are false.  I, for one, had expected better of reasonable persons.

	My mistake then.  I was under the assumption that when exposed to
radiation parts of the starship\'s hull and internal components would absorb
a certain amount of the radiation causing them to become radioactive.  I
guess I was thinking more along the lines of radiation sickness.  Sorry for
misunderstanding.

Uh, SMALL??  You call printing out every script for several hundred objects,
plus a description of HyperCard small?  MegaCharacter, for example, has
several hundred cards (which I presume you\'d need copies of), several hundred
scripts, and also uses the HyperCard event hierarchy to advantage.  The
complete stack is 2+ megs, most of it being data or scripts.  (After all, it
generates every published race - plus others, every published CT/MT character
type - plus others, names characters in every published language - plus
others, physical descriptions, personalities, and motivations...)

Honestly, and sarcasm aside, you\'d be better off writing one from scratch. 
Much easier than trying to \'port my HyperCard stacks, anyway.

Good post.  I like your system.  I\'ll also offer up a simpler system of my
own for folks who don\'t like tables: 

Instead of 250 x SS Cr/month, how about setting living expenses at 
40 x SS^2 Cr/month.  here I\'m assuming 1 Cr roughly equals 1 $. 

SS	Expenses/month /Year

2	160 Cr		1,920 Cr
3	360 Cr		4,320 Cr
4	640 Cr		7,680 Cr
5	1,000 Cr	12,000 Cr
6	1,440 Cr	17,280 Cr
7	1,960 Cr	23,520 Cr
8	2,560 Cr	30,720 Cr
9	3,240 Cr	38,880 Cr
10	4,000 Cr	48,000 Cr
11	4,840 Cr	58,080 Cr
12	5,760 Cr	69,120 Cr

This covers basic expenses (rent, cloths, food...) for one individual, and
works out about right for the modern US (assuming SS 2 = homeless or
nearly homeless). 

Also, assuming monthly expenses consume 70-75% of monthly pay we can work
out the SS for the various professions listed on Page 113 of T4 by their
monthly pay. 

Pilot (6,000 Cr/month) = SS 10
Navagator (5,000 Cr/month) = SS 9
Engineer (4,000 Cr/month) = SS 8
Medic (2,000 Cr/month) = SS 6
Gunner (1,000 Cr/month) = SS 4

Looks good to me.  It also looks like pilot and navagator are elite,
high-status, occupations.  I imagine they would have special clubs and
such and would have a status similar to doctors or lawyers in our own
society.

Excuse the html tags, as I have ripped them out of my web page.  If you
would like to see the associated pictures, goto
http://www.electric-rain.net/Traveller/TAS.html

This is an attempt to reconcile FTL with our current knowledge of the
Universe in general, and then try and fit the result into Traveller with a
minimum of black box concepts.  Hopefully this pseudo scientific
explaination will be helpful for GM\'s in some way, even if it is just a
curiosity.

After actually sitting down and hashing out on paper how this whole Jump
gate system will work, and how I would mesh it as much as possible with
the current system, I have come to the conclusion that wormhole\'s as we
know them would affect Traveller way to much.  If some die hard GM\'s
really like the idea and want to use it they will have to work pretty hard
to maintain consistency with the current build of Traveller.  

Maybe I should just start my own Universe.

<H3><A name="wormhole">Wormhole</A></H3>
<img Align="right" src="Pix/Wormhole.jpg">
A wormhole is a shortcut for travel between distant points in the
Universe. An artificial Wormhole has two entrances called "mouths".  The
mouths are connected to each other via a tunnel through hyperspace. 
<P>
By traveling the distance between the mouths, a space vessel can travel
immense distance in a FTL fashion in the time it takes to travel the
tunnel\'s length in normal space.  
<P>
Time to travel any distance through the wormhole is relatively
invariant, being 168 hours +/- 10%. A ship entering the wormhole is
acted upon by a constant "acceleration" to the midpoint of the trip and
a constant "decceleration" of the same magnitude from the midpoint to
the destination. The "acceleration" varies from wormhole to wormhole,
but has never been found to cause a greater than 10% variation in travel
time.
<P>
As an analogy, imagine a trip through a frictionless tunnel connecting two
points on Terra. A trip of any distance would take the same amount of
time.
<P>
The mouth can be of any shape, commonly it\'s a circle/sphere.  The
wormhole
is a two-way connection, vessels can travel back and fourth between each
mouth to different points in the Universe.    The naturally occurring
wormhole is a peculiar creature indeed.  It blinks into existence, opens
up briefly, then pinches off and ceases to exist.  A natural Wormhole
does not remain open long enough to allow anything to get through the
tunnel before the tunnel collapses, nor is it of sufficient size to allow
anything of any usefull size to get through.
<P>
A way was eventually discovered to locate and manipulate wormholes.
During the initial stages of research, the tiny wormhole\'s life was
prolonged by protecting it from radiation bombardment, which accelerated
the collapse of the wormhole.  Eventually the wormhole was completely
stabilised and methods were found to enlarge the wormhole for
intersteller travel.
<P>
This was done by threading the wormhole with a material commonly refered
to as exotic material.  Using gravitational forces the wormhole could be
enlarged to any desired size, and kept open indefinitely.   Through the
use of this technique societys were finally able to leave the confines of
their respective solar system\'s and expand across the Galaxy.
<P>
The creation of a wormhole is a difficult task.  The calculations
associated with the plotting of the wormhole through space  beyond 6
parsecs have been found impossible to solve.  Though it has not yet been
proven insoluble, mathematicians made it their "holy grail" ever since
Fermat\'s Last Theorem was proven.  Evidence also exists that implies that
the Ancient\'s were able to travel much further distances than 6 parsecs,
adding fuel to the continued search to break the 6 parsec barrier.
<P>
The method of manipulating natural wormholes is effective due to the
tha fact natural wormholes are common.  This can still present researchers
with problems, as wormholes can sometimes not appear in a given area for
months or even years.  Sometimes suitable natural wormholes have been
found many hundreds of kilometers away from a planet or starbase, forcing
space farers to spend many hours getting from the wormhole to their
destination.  far off stargates are also much more expensive to maintain,
and difficult to defend.
<P>
High Tech Level societys (TL15+) have solved this problem.  They are
able to create artificial wormholes where ever needed. Using a method that
allows them to locate wormholes in the quantum foam, they then can pull
the wormhole out of the foam and mannipulate it to any size they wish.  At
this point a stargate can be built around the newly stablised wormhole.

<H3><a name="JumpGate">Jump Gate</a></H3>
<img Align="right" src="Pix/stargate.gif">
[part\'s of the definition borrowed from Babylon 5]
<P>
A Jump Gate is an artifact that can manipulate wormhole\'s.  The Gate
maintains the wormhole and keeps it stable.  When the gate is not in use
it reduces the wormhole to its almost normal, tiny state.  When
activated, the Jump Gate expands the wormhole to any desired size.  Thus
the affect of a "blossoming flower" can be observed.
<P>
Most jumpgates are designed with three or four fourteen-kilometer long
generators. The "brackets" are free floating with a
central computer controlling the positional thrusters; these allow the
brackets to re-position for larger than average ships and maintain a
relative stationary position. After activation, a jumpgate usually takes
five minutes to recharge itself, relying on a <A
href="#ZeroPointField">Zero Point Field</A> for it\'s
primary source of power, with a Solar or Fusion plant as a backup. As
a consequence of such a power output, it takes a long time to shut one
down and even longer to start it back up.
<P>
Jumpgates can be used by any ship (though the control codes can, and
usually are, changed in times of war). The jumpgate automatically bills
the ship that uses it. The money goes to the government who installed the
extremely expensive gate. Shipping companies buy access to the jumpgates
in bulk, assign routes to their ships and then sell the surplus on the
open market.
<P>
Unfortunetly jumpgates are a paired creation, one jumpgate links to
another jumpgate, and that is the only gate that can be travelled to. This
is the jumpgates only known drawback
<P>
Jumpgates broadcast a homing signal that can be picked up a little over
ten-thousand kilometers away.  This signal gives a three dimensional
location for the gate and is a small safety precaution to aide ships that
may have become lost in space.
<P>
Due to accidents during the initial deployment of Gates only one vessel
or one group of vessel\'s flying in formation may travel through a gate at
any one time.  High tech society\'s can build vessels that can create wormholes
themselves, without having to rely on a gate, see <a
href="#JumpDrive">Jump Drive</a> for more information.
<P>
During the initial deployment of Gate\'s, special construction crews were
sent to destination star systems traveling in exceptionally fast vessels
(not FTL).  They would arrive at a particular system, construct a Gate,
activate it, then, if all went well, be able to return via the gate to
their home system.  These trip\'s would sometimes take hundreds
of Earth years, but generally averaged around the 26 year mark.
Construction time various between a few months to a few years depending on
the technology level of the society.  Eventually, human construction crews
were replaced with slightly more expendable robot crews.

A foam like structure of space that makes up the cores of singularities

<H3><A NAME="Misjump">Misjump</A></H3>
Sometimes a wormhole fails.  This can be due to the rare, but possible,

They can destroy the ship and its crew.  Other failures can destroy a
drive or send a ship in the wrong direction.  Some misjumps 
spit the vessel out into normal space immediately, sometimes only part of
the way, sometimes many hundreds or even thousands of light years away.
<P>
Misjump\'s can be enginered.  The opening of a wormhole within a wormhole
can cause a misjump, but normally it causes the complete destruction of
the ship and both wormhole\'s.  Some military experimentation in this area
has found it to be a semi-effective tactic.  Unfortunetly, the ship or

into hyperspace, then burrow through to a required destination point, only
large or small hyper advanced ships have Jump Drives.
<P>
High tech society\'s can begin building vessels that can create wormholes
themselves, without having to rely on a gate at TL15. Vessels of TL15 are
experimental, becoming common at TL16. The ship effectively carry\'s it\'s
own gate along with it.  The wormhole is created and maintained by a
computer known as the Jump Governor.  The governor locates a useable
wormhole in the quantum foam then creates a worm hole of the required
size.


NOTES
=====
As you might have noticed I have completely ignored the 100t requirement
for Jump Drives.  I dont think thats important as Jump Drives will be much
rarer now and probably only in the hands of the military or megacorps.

The requirement for a Jump Drive to be fited I have not yet worked out,
so I did not bother including any such reference for now.

I have also dispensed with the 10AU jump distance requirement for the
gates.   The restriction still applies for Jump Drive equipped vessels.

The other major impact for Traveller is the increase of free space on most
starships, as the need for Jump Drives has disappeared.  The other is the
restriction of movement between systems - jump paths are excatly that now.
They are iron bound restrictions for all except the most advanced
civilisations.


Definition\'s
- ----
FTL: I think Einstein was right, and that there is no way to go faster
than the speed of light.  To get around this problem I use the concept of
\'effectively\' travelling faster than light.

I define FTL as being able to \'effectively\' travel faster than light.  For
example, I have point (A) and point (B).  A vessel leaves point (A) and
heads towards point (B), at the same time the vessel leaves a light beam
is set off heading for point (B).  If the vessel arrives at point (B), by
whatever method, before the light beam then we can say that the vessel has
*effectively* traveled faster than the speed of light.

Hyperspace is a fictious but useful term for the area that the wormhole
\'burrows\' through.  Most often used in two dimensional models of the
Universe.

Wormholes have been mathmatically proven to exist as far back as 1916.  No
observational data exists.

Quantum Foam is an accepted model of what \'space\' looks like under an
exceptional, yet hypothetical, microscope.  No observational data exists.

Exotic Material has been indirectly found to naturaly occur around the
horizons of black hole.  No first hand observational data exists.

Hand Waving
- ----
For compatibility with Traveller I have added the following to my Stargate
FTL travel system;

*No wormhole can be longer than 6 parsecs
*All wormholes take a given amount of time to travel - 1week -/+ 10%
*Those travelling through the wormhole are completely cut off from the
normal universe.

To be honest I dont like these ideas at all, as they dont mesh with the
whole wormhole concept, but for Traveller its fine.  If I was creating my
own Universe from scratch, I would defintely not have the above two.

Wormholes are of whatever length, and do not exist in hyperspace per se,
they just tunnel through it.  Which means that the \'space\' in the tunnel 
still has to abide by our laws.  So the travel time through the tunnel
would be equal to the entering ships velocity and affected by the tunnels
length.

If I had my way, I would probably make all the wormholes one length.
Also, using this concept of wormhole\'s Xboats would become much less
important, as messges could be transmitted through the wormhole via
the gate.

Critiques welcome, but as I said this system is porbably *not* compatable
with Traveller as it would change to many things.

Peace,

This isn\'t the case in radiation sickness either.  Radiation
sickness is caused by ionizing radiation----the gamma and x-ray
photons basically blow molecules apart by knocking off the electrons
that hold the atoms together.  When this happens within a cell,
things get rather nasty :-)

The only way things become radioactive really is if they absorb
radioactive materials.  So if you eat some veggies with dust on them
and the dust is itself radioactive, you now have radioactive
material in your gut.  The radiation doesn\'t make your gut
radioactive, though, it just wreaks cells.

Capturing sub-atomic particles within a given atom could transmute
it to an unstable isotope (ie: making it radioactive) but it doesn\'t
factor into what people typically describe as radiation exposure
(you\'d be long dead of ionizing stuff before transmutation of your
atoms made significant portions of you actually radioactive).

Two reasons why I don\'t think drones would be a good idea...

1> Reliability.  Drones are great, as long as nothing breaks.  A manned
ship can take action when something goes wrong, and more importantly,
improvise when Murphy pokes his head into the situation.

2> Accountability.  Having all the Marines embark on one vehicle means an
accurate head count can be taken.  Even with advanced technology, the Gunny
is going to personally check off every man as he boards, and then double
check with the squad leaders, before he clears the hatchway.  

I may change the single pinnace into a couple of Gigs in the final design..

It all depends on how badly you want to take the world.  When the Imperium
took Earth, they had good reason not to lay waste to the entire planet, and
so had to send in hundreds of thousands of troops.  On the other hand, if
you don\'t care about the planet\'s value, nuke it till it glows and move on.

That\'s why I stress EMS jammers.  I haven\'t done the math, but I imagine
you could put quite a lot of jamming power along with a short term battery
(1-2 hours) in 7m3 drop capsule.  (IMTU: The Marines use bagpipes playing
"Scotland the Brave" to jam all channels.. confuses the hell out of the
Zhodani.)

The oldest military rule, control the high ground, is once again affirmed.
But even with ships in orbit, the travel for fire support will be extreme.
From the point of view of the Marine/trooper, anything more than 30 seconds
is way to long when you need that support now!  Lasers will retain a role
in close support, especially against sprinting grav tanks that show
themselves above cover.

The most likely support missle I see is a cluster munition.. Either
hundreds of superdense, guided "crowbars" for anti-armor work, or
submunitions for soft targets.  A dual-purpose round would most often
employed.  Dropped along the route of advance of defending forces, these
puppies could turn an attack into a route before contact is made.  

This means that the defenders will do their best to avoid detection.  The
EW situation from ground to orbit will likely be a case of frantic attempts
to burn through jamming to gain critical intellegence, while trying to
avoid potshots from ground mounted laser batteries.  Even in the Far
Future, human recon will have a role.

Even with fire support, the jump troops *need* to be relieved quickly.
They just aren\'t built for the long haul.

One of the things that makes our Army one of the best in the world is it\'s
rapid evacuation and treatment of wounded soldiers.  During Vietnam,
soldiers from allied countries were shocked when helicopters were called in
to take out a single casualty.  This is part of the reason for the high
morale of the American forces. (I can\'t speak for others, perhaps some of
our European collegues can mail me on how their services handle medical evac)

If I knew that I was expected to fight until I was blown apart, and that if
I faltered, my equipment would keep me slogging in harm\'s way, I wouldn\'t
do shit more than I had to, and that would require an engraved invitation
from the Commanding General.

Think about it.. if you know that if you are wounded, you won\'t recieve
aid; would you be willing to take unecessary risks?

Most TL 9+ forces will incorporate medical monitors in armor, the better to
both monitor the condition of the troop, and to aid in stabilizing him when
wounded.  Items like autoinjectors, pressure cuffs, and auto-retrieval
would be heavy, and confined to battledress equipped units.

In an Army with large numbers of grav vehicles, making a dust-off would be
simple.. any clear spot larger than an air/raft would suffice.

It\'d be easier and more effcient to build an ambulance with a single
emergency low berth inside.  Just chuck the trooper in and hit the switch.
But since the medical unit is either going to be a> really close by, or b>
way too far away, a simple bunk to hold the wounded trooper still during
the flight to the field hospital would suffice.  Since cold sleep incurs
some risk, I wouldn\'t want to subject an already wounded/shocky man to it.
One of the first rules of treating battlefield injuries is to keep the
subject awake to try to avoid shock.

This all seems reasonable given the advance stages of battle dress.  Could
you imagine hitting the battle dress and causing this stuff to malfunction?
How about attacking someones battle dress and causing it to overpump adreneline?

It would probably be reasonable for these berths to be painted white with a
big red cross and no one would shoot them down.  This would work on the
premise that an alive, but incapacitated soldier is a larger drain then a
dead soldier.  That\'s not to say that they wouldn\'t be subject to friendly
fire or accidents...

You would end up with a bunch of very highly trained, well armed and
armored troops who would turn around and frag the CO\'s who tried to do
that.

Then they\'d go and frag the society that treated them as mere expendables
like ammunition.

I can\'t think of a better way to incite mutiny, short of serving
spam....again.

Equipping fanatic troops, like Tamil suicide bombers, with such gear might
work for a little while, but the drawback with troops so willing to die
for their cause is that they are always very impatient to do so...and then
the better trained troop who want to live, win, in the long run.

I think I\'d have to agree with Rob, the translation process is probably 
the more convoluted way to go. It\'s better for you to start from scratch.

Another route would be for a list member with a Mac server to get Live 
Card from Royal Software. This beauty allows one to run Hypercard stacks 
over a Macintosh internet server. Anyone on any platform, Windoze, UNIX, 
whatever... with a graphical web-browser can use the stack, and even 
update data in it! I\'ve never seen it in action, but it sounds promising. 
Anyone know more?

Hypercard 3.0, the cross-platform version which will be part of the 
Quicktime Interactive release "early in 1998", will hopefully allow those 
of us with Macs to *finally* directly share our creations with our WinTel 
Traveller bretheren. Poor saps!

You could even have a low power narrow beam transmitter in the gun and a
small coded transponder in the ring/badge/surgically implant that would
make the gun refuse to fire if aimed at a policeman. This would be really
beneficial for police and also great fun for the electronically inclined
slightly less law abiding PCs.

SuperCard can import HyperCard stacks and is cross platform. SuperCard also
has MUCH better color handling, object graphics etc and can create
standalones that are royaltyfree. Another option if one wants to do some
rewriting of code which would definately be the case for "HyperPAD" is to
use Macromedia Director whose script language closely resembles Hypercards
HyperTalk. Director can also create royaltyfree standalones and has the
added benefit of being able to save as ShockWave for web embedding. The
pending release of Director (6.0) will have internet connections and java
embedding as well in its projects so that\'s the one I think.
Sadly both SuperCard and Director costs quite a bundle.

There are no comparable WinTel boxes at any price ;)
(The smiley marks this as a positive statements with no malice - I do
consider it an actual truth but critically OFF TOPIC)

Actually, this is a very persistent (but wholly untrue) myth.  The history
of US popular biology is full of massive amounts of misinformation about
genetics.  The XYY "Supermale" idea originated in the early 50s and has
been cropping up ever since.  The initial study was done with an extremely
small sample size and was disproved shortly thereafter. 

Biological determinism (of which the XYY myth is an example) may be
popular in some (conservative) circles, but evidence for it is still
nonexistent.

Very interesting!

I was just wondering something:

As chart 2 shows, the ship is travelling very near to speed of light. If
captors could measure the ship\'s speed, it would be around c

Now, as this ship should have speed measurement, what speed would it
calculate? The chart 1 would say that the speed is way higer than c, but I
must have missed something.

Imagine that the ship is passing by a static ateroid, this velocity should
be given by the relative velocity of this static rock. As the time is much
slower than for the static rock, the speed would be much higher (this is
shown by the chart 1). On ther other hand, if it calculates such a speed,
the photons too, so the potons from the asteroid couldn\'t reached the ship
which is a non-sense

Could someone explain me how to calcuale the ship speed from the ship. And
what walue would it have? 


BTW, is this feasible? 
With Heplar technology, no way
But with those thurster plates or some other reactionless magical m-drives.

Imagine a specialized ship with a 6G thruster plates, and good grav
compensator, sufficient fusion plant fuel. Good accomodation even low
berth. Sufficient redundancy in the equipement to avoid major breakdown
during 10-50 years. Maybe the ship has to be very bulky too.

This ship could go very far, in a very short (relativistic) time. I know
this kind of exploration wouldn\'t have any interest for the staying people.
But for mad explorators (one way ticket), this should be a great challenge.

You dislike your civilization, you wish to leave you world. Build this kind
of ship, and leave this location and era. Awake 10 years after you left,
and watch the billions of years which have passed... Maybe you will be
looked like a bizzare beast from the past, a primitive living...

Other case: You are a (mad) scientist and you want to verify his theory
about the density of the univers (would it decrease some time?). "Go to the
future" and check it by yourself.

Not very Traveller, but for an alternative SF setting, should be fun?

I think you could create the same EMP by slamming a "rock" of the right
(metallic) composition into the upper atmosphere at a few hundred
km/sec. Pick an easily ionized metal, and you\'ll saturate the
ionisphere (which is essentially what a nuclear EMP blast does). 

So dampers aren\'t a defense.

If a capsule has a velocity of approx 3.3 km/sec towards the ground,
and can decelerate at 22.2... meters/sec (a bit over a 2 gee), then it\'ll
cover 1000 km during 5 minutes of deceleration, at the end of which it
has a velocity of zero.

So if you can inject the capsule into the atmosphere at 1000 km with a
3.3 km/sec downward velocity, the troops hit the ground in *5* minutes,
and hardly experience any high gees!

So the question is now, how do you get the ship to the point where it
can make this drop?

And what about using higher accel for the 5 minutes? Note that you
don\'t really hit atmosphere until less that 1000 km.

I don\'t think it\'s wasting all that much bandwidth. 

One thing I\'d like to know is how "consistent" the data format is. If
it\'s consistent enough, I\'ll try to get a copy and write a program that
"sanity checks" the data. That\'d be a case of looking for susopicious
runs, and especially checking to see that the data is "legal" (ie law
is *possible* given the pop and gov). 

If we can agree on what sort of tests to run, then IG can *have* a copy
of the program. It\'d be easier than counting on a human proofreader for
all that data. Think of it as a "spell checker" for sectors.

Only trouble is, any planet with decent spasce capability is going to
detect this *at least* 10-100 light seconds out. That\'s several *days*.
They\'ll either send a ship to nudge it into a non-intercept course, or,
because it is so small, blast it into chunks.

Space has this problem... it\'s *empty*. That means that you can\'t hide.
It\'s like being in the middle of a shopping center parking lot with no

I agree, those ideas don\'t serve your background well. This wormholes and
stargats need an alternate universe.

Yes it would be interesting that all tunnels had different caracteristics
(required energy, lenth, travel time, misjump probability...)




There are other more important consequences. To close interstellar traffic,
you just have to "unplug" the stargate generator. 

This mean that military conflicts should be very rare or very different
from those in Traveller. IMO this is the main difference from the
(so-called) Canon.

Further as you\'ve said the intallation of such devices would be very long
and expensive . You cannot connect an unvisited system until you send a
ship by normal space. This should take a long time. Are there many
companies which would spend billions credits of inverstment, hundred years
before the first income. This seems financially very risky! Maybe some new
technology would allow new way of starfarring. Or maybe the world would not
be interested in starfarring in 100 years!


IMO, if a univers with such devices exists, I wouldn\'t build too many of
them. I would not create a 10.000+ worlds univers like Traveller. I would
create 10-20 worlds with different original races on each. Interstellar
wars would be nearly inexistent or more like commando, terrorism or black
operations. This RPG would rely moslty on diplomatic and economic activity. 

Interesting but very different from Traveller, not because of the
technology but because of what you can or cannot do with this technology.

Are you saying that your budget dosent correspond to my figures unless the
cerdit is worth a lot more than a dollar. That may well be. The figure I
give is based on information I got from a few Americans some time ago and
I can\'t vouch for them. In another posting someone suggests $3 per credit.
Does that fit better? Anyway, what I was asking was whether the \'1 part for
food, 1 part for lodging, and 1 part for other expenses\' fits your own
budget. It fits mine and most of the dozen people I asked about it some
years ago.

Perhaps you\'re living better than \'ordinary\'? \'Good living\' would cost
Cr1200 per month and \'High living\' anything from Cr1800 up.

From a Guns  & Ammo mag on high tech firearms I purchased last year.

The SSR-6 (or Smart Safety Revolver) marketed by Fulton Arms of Houston,
Texas, is one of the few "smart guns" on the market. It is of particular
interest to police, since FBI data indicate about 16 percent of the
officers killed in the line of duty are killed by an adversary armed with a
service firearm. Built on a modified Dan Wesson revolver frame, other
revolver frame designs, as well as a pistol version, may be offered soon.
The SSR-6\'s three-part safety system consists of a "black box" decoder
built into the handgun grip custom-fitted to the authorized user\'s hand and
an encoder finger ring. When the shooter\'s hand grasps the gun, the ring
sends a message to an electronic sensor inside the grip. The sensor decodes
the message and allows the gun to fire. Without the ring on the shooter\'s
finger, the gun will not discharge. One drawback to the SSR-6 is its steep
price of about $1 ,800.

Also have a news paper article on an Australian designed VERY rapid fire
machine gun. So far tested at 45,000 to 135,00 rounds per minute, the
phalanx equivalent would fire at ten million. If any one is interested let
me know and I\'ll post it.

The crew will notice that the universe seem to contarct along the axis of
movement. If they measure their speed as we went from star a to star b in 3
years but the distance separating them is 6 LY thus we\'re moving at 2xc.
The universe will seem compressed however so that it\'s onlly half as long
in that direction so they could also argue that while it took us three
years to go from a to b but the distance between a and be seem to have
shrunk to slightly less than 50% of what it normally is thus we\'re
travelling at near c.

Exactly so. The quote someone offered with regards to infantry charges, with

For troops with training and a purpose other than their own destruction will go
to great lengths to derive clever ways to get that job done without getting
kilt. The suicider, on the other hand, tends to lose sight of the clever
options and gets right to the point of spreading themselves (literally) all

Here\'s a strange one, doing a text find in Word, I discovered 2 VLANDS! yes 
theres another \'Vland\' in Fornast sector.  Hex #0340  B260951-8.

Those are the only bugs I have discovered, so far :)

Now for questions:

With regards to major Worlds (Sylea, Vland, etc...)  TML  or perhaps IRC 
could be a good place to discuss this.  My solution is keep the original M:0 
Sylea, and downgrade Vland from 1100 to 0, but making sure the TL is 9(or a 
low TL 10?) as is stated in M:0.

Another question is where/how are the homeworlds for the Aliens in \'Alien\'s 
Archive\' going to be placed?  These could be considered major worlds as 
well.

Well, I suppose I should be getting back to work now, the boss is looking 
over my shoulder again!  :)

Also, there are non-rock, non-nuclear means of generating an EMP...

I read an interesting little blurb about them at infowar.com...I can\'t
remember exactly where in the site, but it\'s at www.infowar.com

  The criminal class would have a ball with these things.  Organized crime

Isn\'t this what this list is about? Discussing Traveller and what it does,
how it plays, what it should do? I don\'t think you are wasting bandwidth when
you snip a world UWP from the file and show it along with what you think it

   Ahh.  You have forgotten that at relativistic speeds, lengths (and
   distances) become contracted.  The reason the ship\'s crew get to
   distance D so quickly is that for much of their voyage, distance D is
   not very far at all.  The ship sees stars, planets, and rocks
   slipping past them at speed v, which is the same speed that observers
   on those planets see the ship moving, so there is a symmetry between
   the two observers.  They also see lengths as being contracted, so in
   the ship\'s reference frame, those "spherical" planets are actually
   squashed up as oblate pancakes along the direction of motion.

   For a ship starting at rest, the speed it sees itself travelling is
   	v = c * tanh( A*t/c ),
   where "tanh" is the hyperbolic tangent, t is the time experienced by
   the ship\'s crew, and A is the ship\'s acceleration rating in m/s^2. 
   This formula is valid until the ship does its flip at midpoint, then
   it begins decelerating.

   The speed as seen by the planetary observers will be the same, but
   their time is not dialated, so they use a different equation:
   	v = c * sin( arctan(A*T/c) ),
   where T is the time which has passed on the planet.

In my personnal case, living in a small but good standing flat 600Cr at a
rate of 2$ and, it\'s 1200$ not far from reality (lodging, food, heating,
phone, taxes...). But still a bit low.


>Perhaps you\'re living better than \'ordinary\'? \'Good living\' would cost
>Cr1200 per month and \'High living\' anything from Cr1800 up.

Big towns might be considered as luxury even if you don\'t live in a luxury
environement. Cost of living is always high downtown than in small town or
suburbs (including food and lodging and even taxes)

In all cases lodging/food/other expenses is not 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 but more 2/3,
1/6, 1/6

As for 600Cr for the total
  400Cr at 2$ is near that for lodging in a 40m2 in Paris.
  100Cr for regular food (neither trash nor caviar) seems quite good 
  100Cr for phone, electricity, taxes, TV... is not far from reality

The overall is good, just the proportions may be slightly different, but
this is too detailed to be interesting during regular RPG. IMO, your system
is a good approximation.


But there are other cost which are not include : vehicle are very very
expensive (insurance, fuel, maint...). Using the 1/1000 ratio as starships
is unrealistic. It should 1/10 of the original price of the vehicle each
year for the regular expenses. This should vary with the taxes up to 1/5
(which is my case)

As most of "ordinary" people have one vehicle, such cost might be counted
in. Further more for weapons and other equipement.

You should had a percentage of the total owned equipement (inlcuding
vehicles) which have to be payed each month (let\'s say 1/100 per month).
This include regular fuel use for vehicles, bullets used for training...

If you just add the cost of unusual (adventures) action, it shouldn\'t be
far from the truth.


What do you think?

the M:0 book. Aditionally, there should be infos on Core sector in TD 
8,9,10. I have issue 9, i\'ll see if there\'s something useable in 
there...

Anybody have any info on Dlan, perhaps somewhere in the MT stuff? Did 
the Dlani society from which Dulinor came from already exist in M:0? 
If so, the data of Dlan should fit these infos. 

Carlos, how about you fixing the bits of Massilia?

I pretty much shot myself in the foot when I said the philosophy
would be to "keep them FIGHTING till they\'re a puddle"... That
certainly WOULDN\'T make it into the recruitment litterature :)
 
To the soldiers it would be something like "Our advanced battle dress
technologies let you retaliate even when pinned down, letting you
clear the ennemies so help and supplies can get to you faster!"
 
	The idea wouldn\'t (originally) be to push the soldiers past
the breaking point, but to help them maintain at least a good
defensive capability even if they\'re gravely wounded, so that there
is something left when the medics do get there.  Playing dead
probably won\'t be a good idea when technology allows an ennemy to
scans your lifesigns from 100 meters away, so you want to be able to
kick back even when you\'re down.  Unless of course you don\'t want to
kill but only cause extreme wounds so the wounded soldier is a drain
on the ennemy\'s resources.  
 
	This is where the \'portable emergency low berth\' comes in -
it would MINIMIZE the ressources needed for a wounded soldier by
putting him in statis till he\'s far away from the battlefield, where
the resources are to help him out, so he\'s not such a big drain.
 
	Also, note that not wanting to be treated like a robot is a
HUMAN reaction.  It\'s sensible to assume that it\'s the same for all
other sentients, but who knows...  After all, warrior droynes
basically live for combat, so why expect to live through a battle?
What matters is to save the family...
 
	But of course there would always be abuse and generals who
\'waste\' their soldiers stupidly.  Hmm...  I suppose it wouldn\'t be
such a rare occurence for \'green\' troops who don\'t really know what\'s
going on.

Sure is Marc, but some people not interested in this Thread might get 
angry about "having to download stuff they are not interested in". We 
had lots of arguments about this. I favor an open discussion as well, 
but was trying to be considerate of other opinions (It\'s become so 
easy to offend people on the TML these days, so i thought, better be 
careful with my suggestions,-secretly hoping enough people would 
contradict me so the discussion can start.)

Since these would be highly illegal, the punishment of even carrying one

I have to agree and and disagree with, Brett.   He is right that a Jump
Infantry would be used for a holding action or raid type mission.  But I
cant agree that they would be chewed up, messed up yes and not very happy
but they could do their mission for two reasons.  1) The element of surprise
would mean that they would face only light resistance and  unorganized
counter attacks.  This would allow them to hold their objectives until
relived.  2) Technology would also play a major role by 3rd Imperium  man
portable plamsa weapons and other heavy support weapons will be aviable.
Even our 21 centary war program are developing such weapons.

Dito here I cant see fighting until my suit blows up as a good way to fight.

Lastly I would like to point out that on the first page of the Chapter
covering Travell in space in T4 it states that time to save jump point is 5
hrs at 1G for a size 8 planet.  Thats like 2.2 hrs at 6G.  so actualy if
planned right a Jump infantry transport will only give the planet what 3.5
hrs to get ready.  Also you have to assume that other ships with jammers and
other electronic and decoy ships will come in at the same speed to confuse
the enemy as to which one was the actual Transport.

This would also help the Jump Infentary on the ground see above.

Lucky.  He has not mailed a copy to me yet.

Or I.  Especially if we limit our online examples to small numbers of UWPs,
and the hex numbers that have that kind of problem.  Perhaps we should put
a "collected changes" document somewhere, though?

On second thought, I suspect that most people will either have automatic
data scavengers, or will do a small number of places by hand.  The small
number of places would likely not take up much list traffic, and would
certainly make interesting reading.

Would be nice, and I am glad someone has started to write such a thing.  I
am still trying to decide a good "grid square" format that knows all
sectors so I can do multi-sector maps.

Consider adding the ability to check whether you have a high tech scrunge
world near a low tech paradise.  This would involve some kind of clustering
algorithm, but would be really handy.

1Cr=$3 seems about right for the living expenses given in the book, more or
less.  I get an economic distribution that works acceptably, if not
wonderfully, if each SS level represents about a 10% drop in income from
the previous level, with SS7 being 8-12KCr.  I get a better one by using
World Bank economic figures, which I could repost if anyone is interested.

Note that the income distribution today is skewed a bit, in that the top
1/36th are making something like 20 times the bottom 1/36th, and there is a
very flat middle, so the range is really narrow.  More details are
available if you want them.

This is not far from how I live.  We figured that other expenses should be
between a third and a half of total spending in our game.

Cr600/month = Cr7200/Yr, which is about a quarter of the US average, and is
not enough to survive out here.  It is possible that everyone near here is
at Good status, but I would have expected something closer to 20-30KCr as
average living in this area.  I am open to debate, as Traveller does not
define what they mean by average living in 20th Century terms.  (c.f.

Let me strengthen what I said a few minutes ago - I would like to see how
people adjust a given UWP to fit "reality."  I suspect I would learn from it.

BTW, Marc, are you willing to change stellar classifications?  I have not
gotten the data yet, so I am figuring out what I want to do with it. <g>

For earth, this is not quite accurate in my opinion. You do not hit
atmosphere until less than 200 km. Typical Shuttle operations are
performed at about 450 km altitude. Many spy sattelites operate well under
200 km and can operate for at least half a month. Minimum practical limit
is about 180 km where atmosphere friction definitely makes a problem in
long term.

Therefore you can have much higher speed, wasting all the energy in the
atmosphere with 1 g, if you use propulsion, much faster but you have to
have much better heat shields because heat developed will be tremendous.

Also if you are entering atmosphere from orbit, you will have a very very
great horizontal speed which would cause you to travel quite a distance
parallel to surface until you waste that energy as friction, thus heat.

It\'s really official, or canon, in T4 the dissapearing of X starports.

I tought E starports being simply a more o less plain field with a
rudimentary microwave or radio bearing system. And X being the \'land on

There are two Arvid in Old Expanses, one in M subsector and one up in C
or B.  I figure its just like there about a dozen cities named
Springfield in the US. Also people in New England (Northeast area of
the US) stole lots of names for their towns from back home in jolly old England.

Whoops. :)

There\'s no column for travel zones, like there was in the old
DGP data... are there red/amber zones in M:0?

Otherwise, a very useful resource... I\'m going to ask Marc to 
put a \'Zone\' column back in.

  ROTFLMAO!  It would deter the average "honest" Imperial citizen.  That is
not whom I was refering to.  I was refering to "Law Enforcement Officers"
and "Career Criminals".

  When was the last time a cop got busted on a weapons charge?  How many
cops carried unregistered guns ("On the Badge") in areas with severe
penaties for unregistered ownership?  

  For the crooks, it\'s a tool needed to conduct their trade.  The
penalities for assault, robbery, grand theft air/raft, etc. are already
high enough to "deter most people."  Tacking a weapons charge on top is
moot.  Besides, that assumes:  1.  You get caught, 2. You leave witnesses,
3. Witnesses will testify after your buddies take out his "insert family
member" with a hopped up Thud gun, 4 through a very large positive integer
left as an exercise...

good. Personally, I would have liked to have seen the tables in-line
with the text of the chapters, but I can see the advantage of having
them all in one place for ease of reference later. 

	A couple of thoughts:

1) Given that there is no real advantage to building J1 drives at any
tech higher than TL9, or J2 drives above TL11, why not use J1/J2 drives
from your lower tech worlds in your ship designs? If, from what I can
tell about currency exchange in Traveller, there is a significant
difference in price as measured by some baseline currency, are there any
rules about mixed tech purchases in PE that I haven\'t gotten to yet?
This also may be important in THUDDD competitions as well, where
contractors purchase reliable but lower TL equipment for installation in
their designs, at reduced cost.

2) Naval exercises for spacefleets: it is common practice for armed
forces to play mock engagements against members of their own forces, or
with those of friendly nations. I had a couple of ideas on how this
might work:

	-replace the warhead of missles with a short range tight beam
laser/maser communicator, programmed to pulse at the point where a real
missle would have detonated. Hits would be determined by the target\'s
passive sensors; damage could be extrapolated by computer and beamed to
the coordinating vessel(s). Dummy "sensor readings" could then be sent
to the firing ship to give it an idea of what sort of effect the shot
had. Meanwhile, the missle would turn on a homing beacon, decelerate if
possible, and await recovery. It could then be refeuled and reused.

	-lasers could be downpowered to communicator levels, and rate of fire
would be arificially governed. Hits would be determined above; coherency
would be maintained by the usual gravitic focusing (if you buy into the
idea that the gravitic pulse would cause sounds to be produced in the
target vessel via compressions, you could add really cool SFX as well).
damage would be handled as above.

	-other beam weapons could be handled by installing additional tightbeam
communicators.

	This would allow real combat to be fairly effectively modeled, and
using tighbeam commms would not only cut dowm on comm traffic clutter
which might not be present during a real battle, but allow for
coordinating vessel(s) to maintain a sense of the fog-of-war.

3) It becomes feasible (and even a little ingenious) for the highest
tech planets to produce vessels with J1 or J2, built to grapple a
squadron of SDBs (of equal or lower TL) and ferry them into battle at
distant locations. This would provide a rather slick way of reinforcing
blockades or securing claims.

Thoughts?

Now, the original poster has a point, what is different about a meson
explosion and a nuclear reactor that the explosion fails to "irradiate"
the material surrounding it and the reactor does?

Is this also true for nuclear missile warheads?

How about particle accelerators?

Inquiring minds want to know!

Incidentially, back in the days when I knew less about these things, ships
disabled by Nuke missiles in my game were effectively unusable until a
vessel with a nuclear damper arrived on the scene (something common in
naval vessels over 5000 tons or so).  I assumed the period required was
longer than "game time" would allow.

    'body' => 'Well, I finally got Marc\'s FS data imported into my spreadsheet program
(don\'t ask _me_ for it: he\'s the guy with the copyright), so it both looks
nice and I can play with searching and analyzing it to my heart\'s content. 
I\'ve deleted the data for Delphi, Fornast, and Zarushagar sectors since,
as referee preserves, they\'re beyond our purview.  That leaves some 4562
worlds under consideration.

Knowing that at least the physical portions of the data probably date from
MegaTraveller days, I thought I\'d do a quick check versus the suggestions
found in Mark "Geo" Gelinas\' article "Notes on Collapsing Worlds" in
Challenge #77, which also address making stellar types, etc. correspond
more to our current knowledge of astrophysics, stellar populations, and
general reason.  (Hey, is Geo still around on the list?)  Sure enough,
most of them haven\'t been done for this set of data and, though the
suggestions are probably open to argument as a TNE-ism, I think they\'d be
useful changes.

Gelinas recommends that all D-spectrum primaries (white dwarfs) become
type V instead, except perhaps for some vacuum-planets that could
reasonably be described as "cinder" planets circling such burnt-out stars.
366 stars in the existing data need to have this issue addressed.  My next
project will be to try to use multiple search parameters to find which
ones might be justified in keeping the white dwarfs.

Spectral class VI is apparently no longer considered valid: it was applied
in error to what have now been identified as metal-poor Population II
stars from the galactic halo.  186 worlds are listed as circling class-VI
stars, and should probably be changed to class V.

Apparently, star types K5IV through K9IV and all MIV types do not exist.
I find no MIV stars in the remaining data (there were some in Zarushagar,
et al.), but 15 late-KIV types that should be changed to class-V.

Next, a few persnickety and purely aesthetic comments.  I\'m a great fan
(both for its layout and machine-readability advantages) of keeping trade
codes to two letters, but the FS data implements "Ind," "Ast," "LoPop",
and "HiPop" for the old "In," "As," "Lo," and "Hi" (Industrial, Asteroid,
Low-Population, and High-Population, for you newbies tuning in here).  I
might support a wholesale move to three-letter codes, but I think mingling
them looks a bit ugly.

Some trade codes also seem to be redundant: I see several occurences of
"Ast" and "Va" (are any asteroid belts _not_ vacuum worlds?), and of "Po"
with "Ba" (which may or may not be redundant, depending on what you think
the "Poor" classification should indicate).  Gelinas strongly recommends
that Barren worlds be changed to TL0, which also needs to be performed for
this data set.

And while I\'m frolicing at the tail-end of the UPP -- how politically-
neutral should the FS data be?  Should type-6 ("captive") governments have
the owning planet listed?  Should allegiance codes be generated and
included, at least for pocket empires already mentioned or considered for
development?  (League of Antares, Geonee, Suerrat, etc.)?

Some of my next projects, I suspect, unless somebody beats me to the punch
(which they\'re welcome to do -- I don\'t have time to perform all these
checks myself, though they\'re fun to consider):

	* Find frequencies of stellar types and correlate with modern
	    astronomical observations: how authentically random is the
	    distribution?
	* Check proportions of UPP stats.  Gelinas\' article includes
	    annotation by Dave Nilsen pointing out how broken some of the
	    DPG data really was (Zarushagar was a wise sector to exclude,
	    since it seems one of the worst offenders).  Do any of the
	    remaining FS sectors need to have the physical stats redone?
	* Find frequences of various starports, and consider in light of
	    Milieu:0 background and history.  Any changes to be done here?
	* Find all occurences of zero population (with zero stat in the
	    population multiplier and "Barren" trade classification) and
	    assemble them to be changed to TL0.  Is it reasonable to allow
	    for high-tech enclaves of fewer than ten people, or should we
	    presume all such were either wiped out by the Long Night or
	    haven\'t yet been established in the Imperial expansion?
	* Choose likely candidates to be "owners" of Gov-6 worlds.
	* Correlate rough positions for Droyne & Chirper worlds given in
	    Alien Module 5 with those in the FS data.  This is an overly
	    picky point, and could probably be skipped.
	* Consider historical information about Vilani, Sylea, etc. and
	    ensure that world stats (Shudusham, etc.) match history.

Again, this is all just stuff I\'m considering independently and over the
data set as a whole.  I\'ve volunteered for the various grass-roots efforts
that have been proposed on the list, and would be happy to reduce my
efforts to a single sector or so in cooperation with a larger force.

Rather impossible actually, I submitted this article last July.  Ken
Whitman promptly lost it, so I resubmitted it in February after talking to
Courtney Solomon. 

The main difference is that I used the old Digest Group data on the
Ilelish system, so the primary is an M0 star.  I ignored the dwarf status
of the star becasue it made no sense whatsoever.  An M0 White dwarf has a
radius of around 27,000 km, a surface temperature of 2,700 K, and a
luminosity over 30,000 times less than the sun.  No way to have a hibtable
planet around such a star, and yet, we were told that Ilelish was a lush
jungle world.  In an effort to make sense of the situation, but to make as
few changes as possible, I simply made the primary a main sequence M0
star.

OK. Two tweaks:

1: If somebody _without_ a transponder chip pulls the trigger, instead of
firing, it flips forward and traps the culprit\'s finger against the trigger
guard, and, simultaneously,

2: sets off a really loud and really annoying siren/strobe light in the

Also, I remember many years back I saw two interesting weapons on TV, the
rights to the weapons were then purchased by respective countries
Military, and never seen again;

The first was a plastic gun built by a Dutch firm.  Accept for the
bullets, it had no metal in it what so ever.

The other, more interesting "weapon" was a non motorised exoskeleton legs
designed by an American inventor.  It would allow a human to run twcie as
fast and twice as far using the same amount of energy.  It was a strange
looking device, it added about 2 feet to the height of a human.  When it 
was used, the run looked quite funny, a combination of a normal human
stance and a sort of Kangaroo mini-hop.

An "add on" for the legs was a full exoskeleton apparatus (once again not
motorised) that would allow for heavy lifting.  The American Military
showed a lot of interest in it, as it could be used to build "armour"
around it.  Ever since then, my view of what Battledress would look like
has changed - I have this picture of hundreds of tall, heavily armoured
men running/bouncing into battle.

Also, the weapon used in "5th element" where the bullets would "seek" out
the target, how likely is this sort of technology?  Another old 70\'s
sci-fi had a similiar weapon.

hmm, but if the attacker has such weaposn available, and all things being
equal, then the defender would to, and the defender would have more - ie
the JTroopers are toast.

*Unless*, they are a premptive attack before a major assault and backed
up quickly, or a hit and run strike for other objectives (there only on
the ground for an hour at most).

Also, in the context of a major war (Third Imperium vs Solomani for eg) then
tactical surprise would be the best to be achieved, strategic surprise
would be out the window, because any defending commander worth anything
would have to consider that if an invasion is immnient, then JTroopers will
probably be involved.

This was always how I played it.  A class E starport usually had a radio
beacon and a prestressed concrete pad or a large hunk of bedrock, but no
other facilities, and the radio beacon might not be on site.  It reminds me
of some frontier airports which do have landing lights, but no humans.  To
turn on the landing lights, you click the mike at the tower frequency, and
on they come.

A class X has no prepared area at all, which meant that you did not know
that the ship could stay upright, there might be something else lurking in
the pad area, or you might not even be able to find a place to plop a
pre-grav ship down.  Indeed, you might need to blast down to the bedrock,
which could make your landing spot ... interesting.

Give me a few weeks, and I should have postscript sectors available.  I

Isn\'t law level unbounded at the top? ie: higher law levels (like H) just
mean that the society is more and more restrictive on what citizens can do
(although given that definition I don\'t think I want to live in a society
with law level of H!!)

Yup.  That\'s a law level alrighty! A mighty big one too!  Law 17, with a
religious dictatorship, and an exotic atomosphere..

OK, the planet is run by an elite minority who control the ability to
repair the TL9 life support systems.  This has become a religion over the
years, with strict controls enforced during Twilight as Solomani support
faded away and left the world stranded.  Every aspect of life is controled,
from cradle to grave.  The Adims decide what you learn, who you make with,
and what you do every day.  Rebellion is punished by being publically
shoved out of the airlock into "hell."  

The religion focuses around the belief that they are in fact in purgatory,
and will someday be redeemed.  When the PC\'s arrive, they will be seen as
emissaries from God.  The Adims will *not* be pleased to find out otherwise..

That\'s just off the top of my head.

Several searches through Marc\'s machine-readable First Survey turn up the
following, which includes all stars including those in multiple systems

V or D):

As I noted in my previous letter, the type-VI stars really should be
"turned up" to type V, and several of the white dwarfs (those which
are the primaries for habitable planets) should likewise become main

Most of the data above look O.K. to my limited astronomic education --
except that I think white dwarfs are vastly over-represented!  This is a
particular problem given Traveller\'s generous estimates for habitable
planets -- should those stars be changed?

The speed of light is always the same for any observer (within the
same media).  So your active sensor pulses leave the ship at a
reletive velocity of c, and return with a reletive velocity of c.
What would happen is that the wavelength would change (doppler
shift).  This is what they mean by "red shift" and "blue shift."
If you look away from you direction of movement the signal will have
a much longer wavelength than you emitted.  Look forward and it will
shorten.  Longer is red, shorter is blue (in the visual range).

So it might be a problem if you radar sees a limited bandwidth since
the signal might shift away from what it detects (a radar dish won\'t
see visible light, for example).

Pions (neutral mesons) decay into gamma photons.  Gammas are
ionizing radiation.  So the target gets irradiated.

The way reactors make stuff around them radioactive (when they do)
is that the surronding material might capture neutrons escaping the
reactor, or they might even grab electrons (within the nucleus).  In
either case, the nucleus ends up with too many neutrons and becomes
unstable.  An atom that is unstable is radioactive (it breaks apart
til it is stable).

Missiles will mostly give the target xrays and gammas.

Dunno if this would be likely.  Most radiation contamination on
modern ships (they blew up a few nukes with ships parked nearby) was
basically fallout----this is really what radiation contamination is,
small radioactive particles that settle out from the blast.

First Survey data.  Hopefully these will foster some discussion of just
what Imperial space looked like in the decades before and during the

thought.  If digest readers or others are annoyed by the somewhat
scattershot nature of these posts, please let me know: I just figure
bite-size pieces are handier and less soporific than one massive
statistical analysis.

In my last post (re: spectral distribution), I neglected to include the
distribution of stars into single, binary, and trinary systems, so here we
go.  Of the 4562 systems covered in the data, 2624 are single, 1821 are
binary, and 117 are trinary.

I tried a starport distribution as well, with some odd results.  Some of
the strangeness comes from the presence of ports on barren worlds without
any population, or on very low-tech and/or low-population planets.  While
I have no problem believing this in the Mature Imperium (1100\'s) Milieu,
it sticks in my craw a bit for an area of space just emerging from a Long
Night of interstellar isolation and absence of trade and big government. 
Indeed, I\'d prefer something much more akin to the TNE starport
distribution, with few to no ports except in specifically developed areas. 

Again, we have 4562 worlds in total for the nine sectors covered.  The
starports on these worlds break down as follows:

	A:   402
	B: 1,184
	C: 1,327
	D:   813
	E:   836

I don\'t have figures yet on how many worlds have ports but no population,
for example -- if I had a database instead of just a spreadsheet, such
analyses would be less cumbersome to come by.  But I\'ll tinker with it
anyway.  To my eye, 10% A ports seems about right, but I\'d prefer to swap
the relative abundances of (B&C) and (D&E) class ports.  Any comments?

Actually I (Rick Stump) wrote that and, if you re-read it, I said that
jump troop would be chewed up _By Mechanized Infantry, Let Alone Grav

I WAS light infantry (of a sort).

The quote about \'days of warning\' was responding to a question about
disguising jump troops as meteors coming from deep space.

Personally, I think a full division could be deployed from orbit in
about 1 hr. (total, including drop time). Regardless of the tech level
of the defenders, being able to respond to an entire division anywhre on
the planet in 1 hour is well nigh impossible.

My current budget in New Zealand in a student flat type living arrangement
is rent of NZ$275 per week split 5 ways, for NZ$55 each. Food costs about
NZ$25 - 30 per week, so the ratio of food/rent is 1 food, 2 housing. The
other component is \'the rest\' as nobody has enough money to save anything. 

BTW the Dole is NZ$146.50 per week for those over 25, and about NZ$30 less
for 19 - 25 year olds. The average income is apparently about NZ$600 - 650
per week. This suggests that a Credit is worth about NZ$4 (assuming that at
average to low incomes one spends almost all one\'s income on living), and
that someone with a SS of 2 will spend about Cs150 on living per month. Of
course this depends on the Empire having an income dirtribution similar to
here (NZ).

You\'re already spending Megacredits like water, so what\'s a few more here
or there?

Ok,using TNE/FFS a G-tank costs MCr 0.01 (no need for more than a few
switches inside the Battledress.
 G-compensators for say 2 m^3 cost MCr 0.001 and need 0.01 MW for say 5 min
of deacceleration. This could be provided by 0.0013 m^3 of Batteries,
costing about Cr 7. So the total cost of a standard Grav compensation
system, plus G-tanks is about MCr 0.011

Even if a juiced-up one-shot system cost 10 times as much (MCr 0.11) it
wounld still cost less than TL 12 light Battledress (again prices are from
FFS), let alone the Drop Capsule (they cost about MCr 0.35).

I really think that the only ways to reduce vulnerabily of Jump Troops in
hit-and-run attacks are by 1/ mininising the response time before launch of
the troops, and 2/ minising the troops flight time.

The first can be minimised by \'quiet\' approaches, or disguising the drop
ship as part of the normal traffic. The latter may be the only way if basic
gravitic sensors can reliably detect jump space emergence system wide. A
quiet approach need not be a slow approach, as considerable velocity could
be gained in the outer system.

The second point can really only be acheived by a high re-entry vector and
rapid deacceleration as low as possible. This could be assisted by
G-compensation technology, but only if it can give a very high degree of
compensation, as the difference between say 20 and 23 Gs is not very great. 

I like the idea of an insulated second shell, and ejecting the outer skin
after upper atmosphere re-entry, this would be coupled with evasion and
course correction by cold gas rockets. This would be over a period of near
free fall, followed by a very high-G deacceleration very close to the ground.

A fission reactor fuel itself is radioactive.  The explosion of such a
reactor would, as stated earlier, would spread this fuel over a wide
area...the most significant residual radiation from this event would be
from this left over fuel.

Such an event would also produce a GREAT deal of one time "pulse"
radiation (alphas, betas, gammas) as the critical mass explodes.

Fusion reactors tend to be inherently safer to begin with--starting and
maitaining a controlled, small scale (relative to a reaction like "the
sun") has such demanding requirements that if a system fails, the
reactor is most likely to shut down.  Thats much the problem with fusion
today.  Fusion, in a controlled, contained, and small scale system DOES
NOT want to run.  We get many single events, but the trick is to get a
building sized reactor to reach temperatures and densities for a
sustained reaction.  Maybe in the far future designs will change to
where run-away reactions are possible, but in todays designs we are
trying to find out how you keep such a reaction going.

The fusion reaction itself produces radiation--of course, this is where
the energy comes from.  But once the reaction stops this radiation also
stops.  As stated in an earlier post (I think by Merrick Burkhardt)
radiation can make a substance radioactive if it can knock out the
occasional nuetron and create and unstable isotope.  The shielding
material (which gathers the energy of the fusion reaction and protects
those of us on the outside from getting burnt--SPF 10^100000 you might
say) is constantly being bombarded with copious amounts of radiation
from the reaction.  Even a transmutation event only occurs only one in a
trillion times, this shielding will still become noticably radioactive
over the life of the reactor (i.e. the shielding will still be giving
off radiation even when the reactor itself is shut down)

Particle accelerators take ordinary, harmless particles (like electrons)
and turn them into radiation (betas).  Again, when the accelerator shuts
down this radiation goes away....however again...over time the shielding
can become radioactive (though for PAs propably only very lightly so).

Finally (sorry this is so long--I didn\'t think I\'s be so verbose), my
understanding of how a meson gun is supposed to work is this:  A
metastable particle is created.  The parameter of the metastability is
that if the particle has X amount of energy it is stable.  If its energy
false below X it become unstable and will undergo some kind of decay. 
So we launch these particles some energy greater than X.  For whatever
reason (passing throught the hull, etc...) some of this energy is lost
and drops below X.  The particle undergoes decay, releasing radiation
but not necessarily decaying into something inherenly radioactive. 
(alternatively the parameter could be that the particles are stable for
a certain length of time and then decay.  Doing some relativistic
calculations and then accelerating the particles to the proper velocity
such that this time limit is reached just as the particles are passing
through the target could also work--SF is so cool--the possibilities are
endless when not shackled with cold reality)

Thats it...I hope you find it helpful (and for you physics PhDs out
there...go easy on me as you tear this apart.  I\'m still just a grad.
student.)

Interesting. Especially considering I didn\'t read about XYY males in a
popular science context, but in university textbooks on biology and human
sexuality. Granted, at least one of them was a tad old, 1968 vintage, and
thus highly suspect. Am not sure if it was mentioned in the more recent
books I\'ve read - I\'d have to check.

Am always glad to hear that some tennet of biological determinism turns out
to be a myth!

Actualy no. Remember that as you approach the speed of light the \'size\' of
the universe approaches zero. Visualy what you would see would be the
horizon move from directly in front of you to a ring centered axialy around
your velocity vector. In effect the beam can\'t out run you because the
universe has effectively shrunk down to miniscule proportions.

Consider, a photon from it\'s own perspective is everywhere in the universe
at the same time.

The problem with X-ports is that all appear on interdicted worlds. It seems
a bit odd that all solar system in the Imperium are worthy of E-ports
unless E-ports are really basic.

My E-ports is a flat landing pad of ferrocrete or some such and a radio
transponder that (as all ship transponders) react to navradars. The
transponder logs all communication and now and then a Scout will come by
and download the log to assist in locating misjumped ships, tracking down
pirates etc. There\'s no extrality fence but the area is still Imperial
property.

You really think so?  I think that they could get some kind of defense
there within in an hour.   The Americans have (had?) a Rapid Deployment
force that could be anywhere in 24 hours and be in force within 48 hours.
Don\'t you think that in 3000 years a similiar situation could occur in an
hour?

Just thinking out aloud.

We\'re talking about civilized countries/planets, not the US. Most criminals
in Sweden are unarmed or maybe carrying a knife and yes, our cops do get
busted on weapons charge. I rate US as a law level 3-4 planet were Sweden
could be about 7.

These discussions about safety devices to minimize accidental shootings
could very well be of real importance on a planet very unlike the current
US. Traveller is NOT yanks in space, at least not in my campaign.

Sure they would, but thats no reason not to try.  It\'s like saying "whats the
point of banning hand guns in the USA, people will still get them" sure
they will, but it *will* be harder.  Also, your average Joe will not get
his hand on one.

It also had a slightly helical gunbarrel doing away with rifles. Talk about
immoral gunsmithing.
This gun was made to (IMNSHO):
1 Not show up on airport metaldetectorors
2 Not traceable by ballistics examinations

Most criminals would love to have such a gun. In my campaign there\'s a gun
producer on Wurzburg/Glisten that produces a similar one for the same
reasons.

Radars go at lightspeed and lightspeed is lightspeed in all reference
systems. The problem would instead come from doppler shift as the bounced
pulse would either get red or blue shifted into undetectable by the
receiver.

Yes that is the law level of this planet & it is a legitimate law level
for a type D government.  It would have required a roll of 11 on the 
(2d6 -7 + Gov(14)) table but it is correct.

MT\'s Referee Manual (pg 25) says that the following combinations of
government and law level will automatically result in the following
travel zones:

Govt		Law Level
Type	G   H   J   K   L	- = Green travel zone
A	-   -   -   -   A	A = Amber travel zone
B	-   -   -   A   A	R = Red travel zone
C	-   - 	A   A   A
D	-   A   A   A   R
E	-   A   A   R   R
F	A   A   R   R   R

So if this was a Milieu 1100 planet it would be in error since the above
planetary description is not amber zoned, but in year 0 this system was
probably not in effect.

DGP\'s MegaTraveller Referee\'s Gaming Kit describes the extreme law
levels as follows

Law Level

Code	General description

A	no weapons
B	rigid control of civilian movement
C	unrestricted invasion of privacy
D	paramilitary law enforcement
E	full fledged police state
F	all facets of daily life rigidly controlled
G	severe punishment of petty infractions
H	legalized oppressive practices
J	routinely oppressive and restrictive
K	excessively oppressive & restricted
L	totally oppressive & restrictive

The other players in the Traveller group I played in last year always
thought that my charecter was being too picky in avoiding extreme law
level worlds when he plotted our ships course.

Then one day on a law level H planet we saw a police officer
_in_Battle_Dress_ kill a tresspasser with his bare gauntleted hands &
some of us had brains splattered all over us.  The other players were
quickly converted to my "Don\'t go to planets with letters for a law
level" point of view.

I feel that that doesn\'t always matter. Depending on your definition of a
starport, it is possible to have a starport on a barren world. It could be
what the world had before the population died off (for example). Likewise
with a low tech world - hundreds of years ago it was in use, but now it is
deserted. Of course, if the starport classification means a _fully
functional_ starport, then what I just wrote doesn\'t make sense.

BTW, this is also a reason why I feel barren worlds having a tech level is
possible - it is the tech level the civilisation was at when it ceased to
be a civilisation.

I have to disagree. There should be very few starports of class A (since
Sylea is supposed to be the only world to maintain one through the long
night), and most will be centered in the Core sector. Maybe around 50-100
class A starports? Even that may be too high.


>..but I\'d prefer to swap

Probably about right.

BTW, we really have to decide EXACTLY when this survey is meant to
represent. Milieu 0 is too broad. Year 0? Year 20? Year 50? Year 139.3256?

Cheers,
Jason

It has occured to me that this style of organization could be the reason
that the Impies have tended to do more poorly than they should\'ve in the
various wars they fought in the lare Empire period. The system outlined
seems to include litte interaction with other arms of the Imperial
military. This could create that neat situation where the army needs
support and the navy\'s busy enjoying themselves chasing ships, when they
should be providing ortillery.

The lack of cooperation between regular and colonial units could cause
truely distasterous screwups in a spacebattle.

Offical Answer

Starport Type
	Starport type is based on a simple letter classification system (ranging
from A to E) which details their basic facilities.
	A. Excellent quality facility with refined and unrefined fuel available on
site. Facilities include capability to perform annual overhaul and new
starship construction (QSDS certified designs). A naval base may be present.
A scout base is usually not present. A surface installation is present. A
highport may be present (generally if the world atmosphere is 2+).
	B. Good quality starport with refined and unrefined fuel available on site.
Facilities include capability to perform annual overhaul and new spacecraft
construction (QSDS certified designs). A naval base may be present. A scout
base may be present. A surface installation is present. A highport may be
present (generally if the world atmosphere is 2+).
	C. Routine quality starport with unrefined fuel available on site.
Facilities include some capability for repair (primarily replacement of
QSDS-certified parts). A naval base is usually not present. A scout base may
be present. A surface installation is present. A highport is usually not
present.

In the book "Grunts" by Mart Gentle they use "Smart Ammo" at one time,
but this ammo had a small LCD-display on the side which say "...
46-453-56 ... SIR, SHOOT ME AT THE ENEMY NOW, SIR ... 647-3 ..." and a
little later they pick up another clip where the ammo say "... 08-97-6
... HELL NO WE WONT GO ... WE SHALL OVERCOME WE SHALL ..." clearly even
smarter ammo as the commander later comments. :)

I should tell you that this book is one of the best I\'ve read lately.

I do not think the first reason is very good. Plastic shows on X-ray
machines of the airports, only with less opaque shadow as metal. And the
shape of a gun is ...hm... distinguishing. As for metaldetectors, well,
try carrying an assault rifle in your pants, or under your jacket or
whatever. Furthermore, the bullets are a major concern. Unless in te
future they make bullets out of plastic... B-)

Perhaps plastic handgun would be more useful for criminals, a la
Shadowrun. (It has a plastic automatic pistol..)

IMHO, the recoil of a plastic gun would be much larger than the recoil of
a metallic one.

Actually that sounds more like a law level 1-2 planet were the police need
battle dress to stay alive and can do just about anything with their
arrestees.
Law level H is (IMHO) more like "you receive a letter/e-mail ordering you
to go to the nearest suicide center as there has been a slight demand
increase in your bloodtype organs".

Law level measures the number and pickiness of laws not the brutality of
law enforcement which generally tend to be inversely proportional to law
level.

Ah RUNAWAY starring Tom Sellick as a dective in the Rogue Robots section. 
Quite fun actually, spider robots with acid, land torpedos and of course 
the heat seaking bullet. It homed in on your body heat, it could even 
home in on a particular persons heat signature. Quite cool really.

It has occured to me that with CG available, some of the capsules will
be a CG lifter with a cheap kinetic weapon cluster wrapped around it.
Have some of these floating around at various levels, along with the
jammers and "chaff", and things get really ugly on the ground. 

This makes the weapons "pods" more vulnerable, but it should be worth
it in terms of decreased response time.

It takes neutrons to make something radioactive. Since Fission reactors
release *lots* of them, they tend to get absorbed by non-radioactive
atoms which (usually) results in an unstable atom. This is called
"neutron activation"

The meson explosion doesn\'t use neutrons and isn\'t likely to release
any from surrounding materials in a manner that would result in
absorption of them, thus no neutron activation occurs.

> Is this also true for nuclear missile warheads?

They will not have a high enough neutron flux for *long* enough to
activate much except maybe a few atoms in the actual warhead. But
fission warheads result in the mass of fissionables being turned into
lots of miscellaneous isotopes, mostly radioactive. these get spread
all over and if they attach to something, that\'s "fallout".

> How about particle accelerators?

Particle accelerators (unless using heavy ions) aren\'t likely to induce
radioactivity to any great extent, but mostly because it takes a *lot*
of neutrons over a fair amount of time to make things noticeably
radioactive. 

As an example, it takes hours to weeks inside the nearly ideal
environment of a nuclear reactor for things to get noticably
radioactive.

I use a grid system that has "negative numbers" defined as letters...

That gives a -16 to +16 range. And numbers increase going coreward and
spinward. Core sector is 00, Spinward Marches is 1W...

Whoops, didnt see that, mostly I was looking at Core sector.
I decided to do a text search for "N" in the document.  I discovered that 
there are Naval bases accounted for in the following sectors:  Antares, 
Corridor, Delphi, Fornast, and Gushemege.

I\'ll forward this list to TravLang as well.  Should these names remain as
they are, they might wish to consider meanings for such words.  If \'Gir\'
means, for example, \'rock\', it would make more sense than if it meant
\'chocolate mousse\'.  Although, then again.....

The problem here being that presumably there\'d be a similar penalty for

This may or may not be the case depending on what you call Strategic. 
A well thought out plan can achive not only Tatical but Grand Tatical

Thats as far back as my memory takes me this morinning, but given 
time I could come up with more probably from Queen Ann\'s War and I 
never even made it into the Classical years.

The point here is that a Cmder with understrength force can if he 
picks or in the case of D day and others controls the situation can 
achive alot.  And Yes Jump Infantry has its operational limits just 
as all forces do. Iwouldnt want to take a Grav Tank into a swap or

to their best advantage.

thread within it. There\'s always something which won\'t appeal to someone. But
do we split off each time that happens?

What if the world had a colonizing body or a research station or even a
non-human race who once lived there, but don\'t any more, and left behind
ruins or installations. Wouldn\'t that justify a UWP something like E678000-7

In 1977, I used $1 per credit. Look what inflation over 20 years has done.

X always meant Red Zone. Interdicted World. That really applies to the
Imperium of 1100. It was possible for a world to have a starport and still be
a Red Zone, and there was no way to define what facility there was present.

In 1100, that really didn\'t matter. In multiple milieux, it makes a
difference.

Now, a world may have an A starport and someone could interdict it and make
it a Red Zone. But the A class starport remains in place, even if unused.

	Since a Credit is based on the mentary value of one hour\'s worth of
work, why don\'t we just base it on the minimum wage of the country or

on about $1300/month, which would work out to 275 CrI, more or less.
Since this figure above is without food, rent, utilities, etc., it seems
pretty reasonable to me. Variances between city/rural life and expenses
can be explained via analogy with the way the value of a Cr varies world
to world with tech level and starport type. This would reflect the
effect of industry on the economy, as well as the increased expense of
living in higher population areas. 

	Thoughts?

Sometimes someone gives you a much bigger & better answer than you

Exotic atmosphere, totally covered in liquid, hundreds of millions

opressive law level. Don\'t stop there, don\'t even slow down going by...

No. If I understand your reasoning correctly, then that would
justify a UWP of something like E678084-7. If you say that it\'s okay
to have a Tech Level factor which is not tied to population, then
it\'s logical to assume that the government and law level need not be
tied to population either.

So, if these three factors are not tied to population, then what about
worlds where the current culture is not the most advanced one? Let\'s
suppose there\'s a world where an advanced culture has bombed its way
to the stone age. Is the TL digit based on current technology or
what was once possible? Your logic seems to state that it would be
based on what was once possible, so you could end up with a TL9 world
where the actual population uses stone knives and bearskins. This
makes the TL digit meaningless as far as interpreting world cultures
goes.

The way I run things, if population is zero, then so is government,
LL and TL. If there are ruins of a former race there, I\'d just say
so in the notes.

population.  The children are gestated in incubators then raised in a
communal "training" center where they learn their life\'s work.  The children
are also taught (read indoctrinated) the rigors of society and the nature of
their role in that society.  Every individuals career is determined before
birth and the child is brought up to perform this task.

There is no economic system as everything is communal and the society
operates like a fine machine.  Tourists are extremely limited and
individuals are neither allowed to enter nor leave this society.  The
members of society are quite happy in their roles as needed members of the
community.

New technologies are generated by a special group of scientists and then new
individuals are "developed" to implement the new technology.  Thus, most
individuals are quite fearfull of the new and unexplained -- it simply
doesn\'t happen in their society.

Ok, this is going a bit overboard here, but there are many different
types of death sentences... Like "death by torture", "death by lethal
injection"... I know that if I had a choice I\'d prefer a painless death
instead of a painful one. Now, I just hope I don\'t have to make that
choice though.

No problem...these are world that have lost contact and the starport crews
were withdrawn when it was no longer economically vialble to keep the
place open due to the lack of traffic. I suspect that the facilities were
either A) stripped of useful stuff, or B) mothballed in order to wait out
the \'temporary financial crisis\' that the beginning of the Long Night most
certainly was viewed or at least propagandized as. I would suspecyt that
these facilities will actually reach their status as A or B starports only
after they\'re started up and restocked. BUt it\'s really nice to have a
pre-built infrastructure there to exploit as you expand, so I suspect that
places like this will be among the first (after ports on highly populated
worlds) to be refurbished and brought back on line.
 
The presence of such places on worlds of otherwise low tech would imply
that the world originally was just a ROM resupply and refurb base; I
suspect that a large number of the ROM starports were originally temporary
forward bases put up by the Terran Navy, that just grew into ramshackle
permanent structures...look at many of the small airstrips or ports around
the world, and how many of them date from temporary WWII stuff.

I have just downloaded a copy of the First Survey data from Joe Heck\'s web
page.
I read the data into a database and started running a few tests to check
the data. Two things I\'ve found so far are:

1) There are four hex\'s in massilia that contain two systems each.
mas 0720    Khiian Ark .    A100348-D   LoPop Va    424 K9 III M5 D    
mas 0720    Kuamirar .      A100362-E   LoPop Va    224 F5 V           
mas 2503    Iishma Ash.     C3225A7-8   Ni Po       114 G3 V           
mas 2503    Vluund  .       C322888-8   Na Po       214 M2 II M8 D     
mas 2506    Khegshesaup.    C434334-A   LoPop       223 G0 V           
mas 2506    Vlin .          B434110-A   LoPop       723 G4 V M6 D      
mas 2508    Iinarla.        B100786-C   Na Va       502 K1 V M2 D      
mas 2508    Khiiir.         B100200-C   LoPop Va    702 M7 VI M2 D     

Then I looked at my DGP data and noticed that there were two systems in
each of
these hex\'s in that data as well. Eg.

mas 0720    Rellam          A100321-G   Ni Va       924 K9 III M5 D
mas 0720    Amaya           A100321-G   Ni Va       924 F5 V

The stella data is the same as above (ie. Rellam matches Khiin ark etc etc.)

I haven\'t had chance to check the data in the back of Knightfall yet.

2) I thought the highest tech level in M0 was 12? (I may be wrong)
There are 90 worlds in the data with techlevels of D or E, scattered around
the 9 sectors. (If anyone wants a list drop me an email).

Thats it so far.

The problem is that this ignores a lot of historical information in the 
M0 book itself, i.e. The Compeditors of the Sylean Empire: The Chanestin 
Kingdom and the Interstellar Confederacy. In order to be compeditors they 
HAVE to be able to construct Starships. No Interstellar Government in the

Why not cancel the orbital velocity with those great Traveller thrusters and
\'fall\' down.

When I reas Starship troopers I got the impression that the troopships 
cancelled their orbital velocity and then just ejected the troops.

Forget stealth.  They\'re ablating their pods to brake against the

This means that a laser beam can lock right onto them.  Say, a starship 
laser cannon with ROF 800.  Fire one pulse per target, which will 
almost certainly kill it.  Have a network of these things set up
across your continent, and _wham_.  Barbecued jump-troopers.

Of course, you\'ll need a laser frequency that won\'t go plasmatic in
the atmosphere, but any jump-trooper in line-of-sight is dead.
You\'ll need the money to erect the defense net, too, which means
that low-tech or low-pop worlds probably won\'t have one.
But attacking a hi-tech hi-pop world with jump-troopers is a very 
bad idea.

My opinion on the subject (not necessarily the universally correct
answer--end disclaimer).  It would seem that the only way navigation
could be carried out while at relativistic speeds would be to have a
very good idea of the conditions of the ship and its position while it
was still non-relativistic, apply the length contraction and time
dialation equations that have been posted and compare what you observe
"out the window" with what you expect to see as predicted by the
equations and initial conditions.  The initial conditions won\'t change,
so any discrepency would have to be handled by perturbing the variables
(like time and position) and iterating until the perdiction matches the
observation.

Which leads to an interesting adventure scenerio (or two).  Since proper
navigation relies on correct initial conditions:

- --A sabotuer installs a virus (not TNE) into the computer which randomly
changes some of the initial values.  If the changes are not caught....

- --A fugative/hijacker doesn\'t need to take over the ship to get where he
wants to go (provided he is knowledgable about the initail conditions
database and how it is used for nav).  He specifically alters the
variables so that the predicted value match the course HE wants set. 
upon arriving in the system he intended, he acts as an irrate passenger
whos sick mother awaits him at the original destination and demands hes
passage back along with some compensation....due to this "blunder"
caused by "crew incompetance".

Of course there will be somputer subroutines designed to detect such
tamperings.....

Pehaps there should be an E- type port----a port which is not "E" because
there is no beacon, but a safe landing location is known (where the
scouts set down when surveying the worlds surface) and its coordinates
are published.

X ports could be where no attempt was made to land (orbital survey only)
or where no suitable LZ could be found.

Well, sort of.  It\'s a good question, which I\'ll try to address point by
point below.

> Not knowing the exact speed of a radar pulse,

In a vacuum, all electromagnetic radiation (which includes gamma-rays,
x-rays, ultraviolet, visible light, infrared, and radio) travel at c, the
speed of light, approximately 300,000 km/s.

> but I would assume that at some

Here\'s where we get into the extreme weirdness that is Special Relativity. 
Light (including radar) *always* travels at c, *in any inertial reference
frame*.  So when you are travelling at 0.9 c (as measured relative to your
planet of departure, or nearby stars, or whatever), and you shine a
flashlight out in front of you, that beam travels out ahead of your ship
at c.  You could measure it, and that\'s the speed you\'d get. 

However, if folks on your world of origin were watching you do this,
they\'d see your flashlight beam moving out ahead of your ship at c in
*their* frame.  Since you are travelling at 0.9c in their frame, the light
would appear to outrun your ship by only 0.1c.

How to make these two measurements consistent is what SR is all about.  It
turns out that the observers back home will also notice that the clocks
aboard your ship appear to be running very slowly.  Since speed is just
distance over time, they will claim that your measurement of c is
distorted by the clock slow-down; that your \'seconds\' are so long that
light can travel 300,000 km during one of them, even at a relative speed
of only 0.1c.

An additional odd effect of high speed is length contraction -- objects
actually get physically shorter in their direction of travel.  So your
homeworld observers will see meter-sticks aboard your ship (lined up with
the direction of travel as being much shorter than a \'real\' meter.  So not
only are you measuring speed in long seconds, you\'re using short meters
too -- doubly cheating!  Conversely, from your shipboard point of view,
the entire outside universe is moving past *you* at 0.9c -- so the entire
universe is similarly contracted.  A star 1 parsec ahead of you as seen in
your origin-world\'s frame of reference appears only (say) 0.2 parsec ahead
in your frame.  That combined with time dilation is why you can travel to
the stars in less time than light takes to get there -- as measured in
your own frame.  Observers on the origin or destination worlds would still
see you taking more than d/c to get there.

> How then, without using something akin to psionic precognition, can
> you plot a safe course?

The short answer is that, at high enough speeds (say above 0.5c or so),
you probably can\'t.  Obstacles at this speed are both coming at you as
near-c kinetic kill missiles, *and* length-contracted toward you.  You\'d
certainly only want to fly at near-c speeds well outside of star systems
(to avoid all the crud that ends up orbiting stars); beyond that, you\'d
just say your prayers and count on the odds to protect you.

Yes, so it\'s a good idea to add another column to the data to indicate
a travel zone, right? 

Also, I noticed that the column between the PBG value and the stellar
data is empty all the way down - is this column supposed to be 
zone data, allegiance data, or something else? I assumed it was allegiance
data, \'cause that column was allegiance in the DGP files, but as
it\'s empty, it could very well be anything, or just some funky error.

Finally, anyone got some code to check to see if the \'Remarks\' column
is indeed correct? And why are there no \'Ri Ind\' worlds? I saw some
\'HiPop Ind\' worlds, but isn\'t \'Ri Ind\' a valid combination?

Well I don\'t have Book 8 so I can\'t compare but the design in Vampire fleets is split into 9 design steps:


1. Chassis

2. Suspension

3. Control Systems

4. Electronics

5. Weaponry

6. Peripherals

7. Power Plant

8. Transmission

9. Cargo


then there is the design evaluation. If you have a specific question let me know.

I agree with this definition. Basically, a flat piece of ground is
an X starport. A flat piece of ground with a beacon is an E starport.

I\'d say that 9,999 times out of 10,000, a world will have at least
an E- starport, by this definition, which is why I don\'t agree with it.
It\'s safe to say that, unless your world is a gas giant or is 100%
covered by liquid or fire, there is always a flat piece of land 
_somewhere_ that you can use. This makes the X starport definition
above almost useless (no offense).

I like the broader definition. Starports must have beacons. An E 
starport is the most basic starport you can get. An X starport isn\'t
really a starport; there\'s no beacon.

From what I have been reading lately, the data has a very different stellar
population than the real world.  (Given some of the arguments now taking
place, it is likely that the current understanding is also a bit wonky.)

Are you willing to do wholesale changes to stellar codes, UWPs, PBG digits,
and so on?  If you are not willing, for example, to change stellar
classifications, then I will ignore the star type in my comments.  If you
are, then I will try to find the "real numbers" and make the data fit.

Yes!  IIRC, the system is overfond of placing worlds near dwarf stars.

Yes, indeed.  I am not playing "Traveller, the dark years."  I also think
we should shift some population to better places, and make the
distributions a bit more bimodal.

I feel that there should be very little stuff leftover on a barren world.
No port is going to survive a few hundred years of the elements.  Vac
worlds, OTOH, I might accept.

I play that the tech represents the technology that is in common useage
there, and usually that which is produced.  I play, therefore, that a
barren world with a TL of 7 might actually be a world with a few TL12
machines and factories left, but that dould only produce TL7 goods without
significant repairs and retooling, and that it might have a very low upper
bound on how much stuff it can make before breaking.

FWIW, this is the mother lode that every explorer hopes to find.  A big box
of ROM stuff would make anyone wealthy.

IIRC, there should be more binary and ternary systems that single, but I do
not have my references here.

Yes!  The ability to produce and maintain a starship is very important, and
I suspect that no more than one world in a given PE should have this.
Further, there should be a limited number of class B ports.  Most worlds
that are not rising fast will not have anything other than a class C, D, or
E, as the megacorps do not want to encourage competition, and few others
could afford a port better than a C.  A class B port lets you build ships,
and that would be a closely guarded ability.

I can live with 400 A ports, though it seems about twice as high as it
should be.  From what was said recently, a class B can produce a starship,
while a class C can maintain or repair it in a limited way.  A class D is a
good refueling stop, while a class E is a known place to land.  I would say
that every PE would have at least one port that can build ships, while any
world that is a common endpoint for a trip would have the maintenance
facilities implied by a class C.  All other worlds would have a class D or E

My proposed distribution:

4562 worlds, which are something like half inhabited.
A: ~150-200
B: ~350-400
C: ~1000
D: ~1000
E: ~2000

This leads to roughly 600 pocket empires or dangerous worlds, and another
thousand or so easy targets for traders, pirates, and adventures.

Actually, the rounds fired from the weapon in "5th Element" would only
home in on a specially coded projectile fired first.  Heat seekers
would seek out any source of heat nearby.  The weapon depicted in the
movie was supposed to allow continuous fire against a specific target
that is out of LOS.

BTW, knowledge of this won\'t spoil the movie.  It was just a test
firing of the weapon to show off some of the movie\'s excellent special
effects.  Way-ta-go Digital Domain!

I would like to see the highly unlikely/impossible star/planet combinations
weeded out.. Agricultural worlds orbiting M9v\'s for example.. Also, some of
the stellar types given are no longer considered viable by science.

It could, I suppose, but in most cases, the goodies left should have
vanished long since.  The port should have fallen to the lowest possible
value, and the tech should decay very rapidly, if the world has any
atmosphere/fluid.  I can accept a very few worlds like this out there, but
they should be quite rare.

Has it been officially decided how aggressive the Vilani and ROM were about
colonizing?  Did they have every world in Core occupied, or did they only
pick certain ones?

When I worked in the civil nuclear industry here in the UK, we refered to
two distinct things - *radiation* (ie emmitted ionising radiation such as X
rays, Gamma, Alpha) and *contamination*. This refered to materials etc.
that were now radioactive, thus emitting to a degree. Thus, something
exposed to radiation would become contaminated if it became \'radioactive\'
and emitted itself. Hope that helps.

I try not to be a gearhead (I get enough of that at work), so I\'ll leave it
to others to extrapolate whether meson guns contaminate the debris they
leave behind!

Presumably, inactive and unmaintained starports would degrade rapidly:
there\'s fuel to evaporate, comm centers and beacons to break, native life
to grow in cracks in the tarmac, or vacuum welding to take place.... and
the basic definition of a port (ship construction, repairs, etc.) seems to
presume some staff are around.  If they\'re robots, who repairs them?
(Quis fabricat ipsos fabricatores?)

Keep in mind, too, that large-scale commerce (i.e. widespread starports)
are portrayed as having begun a decline over 1700 years before Milieu:0,
as the Rule of Man began to collapse.  Probably there aren\'t many
dedicated starports around except within active, starfaring pocket
empires.  I suspect most "starports" are really dressed-up airports, if
the tech level permits (they _might_ qualify for Class C, if they could
process hydrogen and get replacement parts).  A & B ports require
infrastructure that just isn\'t likely to be tossed around so cavalierly
("wasted" on sub-premium worlds) as it is in Milieu:1100, when there\'s
a millenium of constant starfaring history to allow for the sort of
economic variations you describe.  (THERE it can make sense to roll the
starport first and let that influence the tech level: here in Milieu:0
that\'s really kind of strange).

Again, 1700 years is a long time.  Does it matter if the pot-sherd
equivalents on-site are fragments of crankcases or of grav plates?

So now I\'ll argue for _more_ starports.  :-)  Though the Classic Traveller
history often painted a picture of vast barbaric swathes of space in which
Sylea shed the only light, we know there "really" were pocket empires all
over future-Imperial space picking themselves up in the years leading up
to Milieu:0 -- the Chanestin Kingdom and Interstallar Confederacy were not
isolated players, and that\'s three starfaring governments within Core
Sector alone.  We know that the League of Antares already exists in Year
0, and Marc has implied that the Geonee and Suerrat may also have pocket
empires rivaling Sylea\'s.  Heck, way down Solomani Rim way there\'s the
Easter Concord and the Old Earth Union, so that\'s still two per sector.

In such an environment, I could cope with a 10/20/20/25/25 split, say, for
A/B/C/D/E starports, though a more draconian and "realistic" option might
be 5/15/25/25/30.  (5% of 4562 worlds would yield 200-some-odd A-class
ports spread across the nine sectors under consideration, or around 25 per
sector, 8-12 per government if we postulate 2-3 of those per sector).  For
what it\'s worth, the current, completely random FS data is 9/26/29/18/18. 
What does the list think the "proper" distribution should be?

I\'d also suggest a M:0 variant to the usual generation process: if, in the
random UWP generation process, the population and/or tech level don\'t make
it past a certain threshold based on starport type, reduce the starport to
the appropriate value (or invent a good story, since you\'re the ref).

> BTW, we really have to decide EXACTLY when this survey is meant to
> represent. Milieu 0 is too broad. Year 0? Year 20? Year 50? Year 139.3256?

I\'ve been assuming it\'s valid for around 0-20, which is the period the
Milieu:0 supplement paints as being occupied with long-range scouts
zipping through the entire area to get a rough look.  (See the rough maps
of Imperial scout, merchant, and political penetration available in Joe
Heck\'s FTP archives).

    'body' => 'From the readings I have been doing lately (Historical Atlas of World
Population), Rome _needed_ to have a few million to maintain the tech 1-3
culture they had.  The million do not all have to live there, but they do
have to be within one jump, as otherwise, transport costs get prohibitive.

I would propose that any world with a tech of higher than 1 have a
population of at least 5, with 6 or 7 being more reasonable.  The sole
exceptions are worlds supported entirely from the outside, such as
colonies, research stations, and depots, which should be noted in the
descriptions.  What follows is a more detailed alternative population
generation system that takes two passes:

Judging from our own colonial history, a world can support about 1 percent
of its population in a distant place, so it would be rare to have more than
one non self sufficient colony per hundred million people on the home
world.  It would be more comfortable to have it be one colony per billion.
Sylea, having 30G people, can probably keep a few dozen colonies alive with
little discomfort.  This means that populated worlds with <1M people may
outnumber worlds with 1G or more, but had best not by much.

The current system generates pop as follows:
0:3%	1:5%	2:8%	3:11%	4:14%	5:16%	6:14%	7:11%	8:8%	9:5%	A:3%

Given my above statements, I use the following distribution FOR NON COLONY
worlds.
0:50%	1:0%	2:0%	3:0%	4:0%	5:0%	6:12%	7:16%	8:12%	9:6%	A:4%

I generate tech and the social stats as usual, but then I check it against
technology as follows:

The more involved system I have been using in my games is:

1.  Any world with less than a million people is marginal.
2.  A million people can maintain any technology up to about 4
3.  Ten million people can maintain technology up to about 7
4.  A hundred million can generate technology up to about 10
5.  A billion people can generate any technology at all

The corollaries:

TL	Pop supported
0-3	100 million
6	1 billion
8	10 billion
12	100 billion
15+	1 trillion

Minimum technologies:
Tainted: 3?
Vac: 7?

1.  TL0-4 can support 50 million people
1.  TL5-8 can support 50 million people
1.  Any world with less than a million people is marginal.
2.  A million people can maintain any technology up to about 4
3.  Ten million people can maintain technology up to about 7
4.  A hundred million can generate technology up to about 10
5.  A billion people can generate any technology at all

The second pass sorts the worlds by pop, tech level and then starport.  It
expands out from all class A ports for one jump (based on homeworld TL),
and from class B ports for the greater of a jump 1 or half a jump.

Likelihood of a world placing a colony on an empty world:0%
Target is Earthlike:+5%
Target has high resource rating: +5%
Target is at jump 1: +5%
Source is pop 9:+5%
Source is pop 10, multiplier <=5:+10%
Source is pop 10, multiplier >5:+15%
Source is Rich:+5%
Source has other colonies:-10%/colony

The results: If there is an earthlike planet within jump 3 of Sylea or
Shudusham, it almost certainly has a colony.  If it is a jump 2, and nobody
has  reached TL12 nearby, it is pretty unlikely to be colonized.

From an editorial in this morning\'s paper:

"Walter Truett Anderson:
        New energy forms are well
        within our reach

        By Walter Truett Anderson 

        S trange news is coming out of the laboratories these days -reports
        of new devices that can produce amazing amounts of clean energy at
        low cost. Some experts believe that we may be on the verge of the
        era of ``zero point energy,\'\' the ultimate cornucopia - power
        generated from the mysterious properties of empty space. 

        This news could easily be dismissed as just a replay of the ``cold
        fusion\'\' excitement that flared up and then fizzled out a few years ago.
        But this time the results - at least in one case - are verified and far
        more impressive. 

        The star performer in the new crop of energy innovations is a device
        called the Patterson Power Cell. Developed by James A. Patterson,
        chief scientist at Clean Energy Technologies in Dallas, it is a glass
        enclosure that contains thousands of tiny metal-coated spheres which
        serve as electrodes. The ``fuel\'\' - believe it or not! - is plain  water.
        When zapped with a small amount of electricity - about 1.4 watts DC
        power input - the cell puts out an enormous amount of heat, in some
        cases hundreds of times the amount of energy input. 

        This much has been proven in numerous demonstrations and
        checked out by many observers. It has been tested by the U.S. Patent
        Office, which has issued four patents on the invention. There\'s no
        doubt that the device generates heat. But there\'s plenty of
        controversy about how it does what it does. "

Wow...if this is right, this is quite impressive. I dug a little further
and discovered that the beads  are plastic with alternating layers of
nickel and palladium...so what I suspect may be going on is some sort of
catalysis reaction with the hydrogen and oxygen separated by the original
electrolysis, but I freely admit I\'m in pure speculation mode here.

I looked on the web and found a site called \'The Institute for New
Energy\', but among it\'s references is one article described thus:

"U.S. Patent Law: Title 35, Part II, Chapter 17, Sections 181-188
     The text. Very difficult to believe! - YET TRUE! Provided to us by
Stacey Enderle, who writes: This Title 35 has been used for years
     to ensnare any inventor out there who\'s invention will threaten the
industry the U.S. government protects. ---- Spread
     the warning! ! ! - Thick, Far and Wide! The Full Legal Text (via the
Cornell Law Library) is also available for you to read. "

Does anyone else know anything about this amazing \'Patterson Power Cell\'?

Truett\'s article goes on to gush about the possibility of generating power
from \'Zero Point vaccuum fluctuations in the universe\' which from his
description involves taking advantage of quantum physical scale reversals
of entropy...particles and/or waves that arise from \'empty\' space
spontaneously. It sounds to me like a jargon-laden perpetual motion
machine.

Comments?

The full article is at:

But only for today...you have to be a Starnet member to look at back
issues of the paper.

	Why not? Think of the role-playing possibilities. The players have to
rigidly role-play their characters and any deviation is punished! "Not
looking in the right direction? Thirty days in prison!" This would
certainly get a rowdy bunch of players back in line!!! Besides, variant
planets are part of Traveller; sometimes the players\' ship just _has_ to
land somewhere, and if they arrive on a planet where the entire population
has a strict timetable for going to the toilet then so be it...

Which, of course, means that any other type A ports in core is a relatively

They only need one port at A or B, as Marc recently posted something saying
that class B ports are shipbuilders.  This makes that class A or B port
very valuable.  Besides, even if only class A ports can build ships, 100
possible competitors in one sector are going to be more than enough
resistance to Sylea.

I do agree that there are not going to be any 1500 year old relics.

I think that detailing the former TL is useful - perhaps a solution that
would may make it clear is to put the TL in parentheses? So Marc\'s example
would become: E678000-(7) Ba. The Ba code qualifies the situation. HOWEVER,
this makes fixing FS even more of a pain as you would have to generate TLs
for worlds that were once populated and now TL0.

I agree that the LL and Gov should be zero for an unpopulated world. I do
not agree that the TL should be, unless we consider it to relate to the
sustainable technology of the culture present.

As an aside, after the recent flamefest, Marc has responded by making the
M0 data available. I believe that we on the TML are obligated to consider
the data and try and fix any problems. However, I believe that the first
thing that we should do is consider what checks to apply. Jeff has made a
start at this - perhaps one of the people who proposed the TML fix should
co-ordinate posting a set of checks that need applying.

Now, at the same time, if someone posts what sectors we are considering, I
think that we should review the available library data and  old \'canon\'.
This we could then post details of *published* lib data and scenarios that
touch upon certain worlds, to ensure that the M0 data and 1100/1120 data
match closely. Individually, this is a big job, but split it over the list
and it would be simple. I\'ll happily volunteer to make a start if someone
will post me a list of the sectors (have M0, not buying FS until it\'s
fixed.)


Yours (suddenly going pale at the thought of the shelf of Traveller books
that need reviewing!)

I think the current manuscript draft is available on Dave or 
Guy\'s web sites (maybe they could post the URL?) My main point is that
it needs *weeks* of playtesting. For example, no-one has yet designed
a 100,000 kTon ship using the new sensor rules...or probably not even
the new hull and radiator rules. Lots of stuff has changed; it takes 
weeks of poking by many people to find the real problems. Ideally, this
poking should be done at something close to the final manuscript after
(presumably) Marc and IG have edited it...

Definitely agree with Chepe here. You\'re talking about reemergence after a
massive economic depression. Where are all the starship building systems
coming from? Where\'s their market for said ships? As time progresses, of
course one would expect to see an increase in A & B starports, but at this
time they would be scarce, and the center of pocket empires and protective
unions. C & D starports, I think, would be the norm in areas on the fringes
of pocket empires (on both sides of the border) and in areas where trade
had been maintained haphazardly, but with no controlling entity, such as an
interstellar government. E starports would undoubtedly fill up the big gaps
left between these trading mains and pocket empires. 
The numbers of B & C ports seemed awfully high for such an area, for the
reasons stated above. What time of of the Imperium are we trying to
represent here? Closer to 0 or closer to 200? Obviously, as the Imperium
grows, there will be a boom in the Starport quality of most sectors
influenced by it. It would predictably be rapid and aiming for worlds
closer to the Imperium to have higher quality starports, while worlds
farther away try to build something, anything, that might attract some of
that trade in their direction.

I was in the Rapid Force Deployment group for a while and they could get
a light brigade anywhere in 18 hours, rest of a division in 6 more. The
Ranger Battallions at Hunter Army Airfield in Georgia can deploy a
Ranger Bat (arguably the world\'s best light infantry) anywhere in the
world in (flight time + 3) hours.
Both are very impressive. But, I must assume that most traveller worlds
have unified global governments; this means fewer military bases and
)perhaps) smaller total soldiers worldwide. This means greater distances
to travel (potentially). If we assume that better tech counters this,
this means a jump division could reasonable expect to face enemy
infantry in 2-3 hours (preparation) + 2-3 hours (travel tiime)+4-6
hours. And that would be similarly equipped light infantry. Even
assuming there are ready brigades on standby that can deploy faster
(soldiers and equipment ready, grav vehicles standing by) that means a
full division can jump, fight for an hour unopposed, hold off a light
infantry battallion as they board pickup ships, and be gone for an hour
before the division arrives. 
  In an our a present-day division an unleash a whole lotta\' grief - I
can\'t imagine what guys with plasma weapons could do!

Most weapons related crimes the criminal uses a knife or sheer brute
force.  A lot of gun related crimes are nearly always organised crime.

   Radar pulses travel at lightspeed, being a form of electromagnetic
radiation (just like light).

   Relativity says that no matter what, the Radar pulse will ALWAYS
*appear* to separate from the source at lightspeed, no matter what speed
the source is travelling; of course time-dilation insures that the
time-sense of the source is different than the rest of the universe.

   The main difference the source will see in the radar pulse is frequency
(doppler) shift due to the gain in energy the radar pulse gets when
bouncing off of a target travelling at a high rate of speed towards the
source...

None taken:->  I would like to point out a few reasons that one might
not want to land on a planet....especailly if you are a survey crew who
is more or less "on their own" and with slim chances of another ship
dropping by to lend assistance within the twenty years.

Feerinstance:

- -I would not want to land on a planet with surface conditions like Io. 
Having the bedrock I landed on split apart, with magma pooling around
the landing struts would give me cause for concern.

- -Severe weather conditions--While "the big Corilian ships" might be
immovable, smaller survey ships might have difficulty coping with wind
sheers orders of magnitude stronger than relatively tame stuff we
normally see here on Earth.

etc...and especially (remembering my time in the military) near the end
of the survey mission when everyone is tired and wants to be
home...."...its a barren vacuum with nothing on it...lets just c=scan it
and go."

I know this doesn\'t fit in with the way you choose for your universe to
run....but it could be an alternate that might possibly answer the
question asked earlier about "E"s and "X"s.

The pulse may have a problem getting through the plasma, etc around the
pod. OTOH what are the chances of it disrupting the flow around the pod
enough to knock it off course? A jump that results in large scattering is
usually a disaster for the attacker.

While I like the idea in principle, I suspect that it won\'t give good
results in practice. Minimum wage rates tend to be determined for political
and idealogical reasons, rather than for straight economic reasons. Frex
here in New Zealand the Minimum hourly rate is NZ$7.5, which is about
US$5.175 and I suspect that in some third world countries it could be
measured in dollars per month.

???
How can it be logical to have a government and law level not tied to
population? A government can only exist if a) there are people present to
make up the government, and b) if there are people to govern (other than
the government). Likewise, having a law level when there is no one to
enforce it (or no one to enforce it on) doesn\'t make sense to me.

While in most cases tech level should be the same (the example you gave of
an advanced culture bombing themselves back into the stone age was a good
one), in the case of now deserted planets I feel that some indication of
tech level is appropriate, since it indicates that the planet wasn\'t always

I guess that is the way that is least likely to cause arguments, and also
allows the referee to have more information than a simple UWP.

So I did a few Excel pivot tables...(AKA crosstabs)

TL distribution looks reasonable, with the median falling somewhere in the
region of 7.5 (based simply on count of worlds by tech level) This of
course excludes Vland, but does include everywhere else.

Masillia is the place to go, my friends, there are no fewer than 6 TL
E worlds there, only one fewer than the rest of the known sectors
combined.

Population is a bit more skewed,  93% of the population of the known
universe live on Pop A and B worlds, just 3% of the listed worlds. (again
excluding Vland for reasons to become clear)

Ahh...but I wanted to see who lives under what TL so I ran that...

Wow!
There are 1296 Pop 0 worlds, representing every tech level, the largest
sample in the bunch.

There are 3 TL A worlds at TL1 and 0 (how the hell do you support a Pop of
A on stone age technology??)

ant	0533	Saazi.	D585ADH-1
ant	1525	Uupe.	E561ABB-0
del	2726	Kiisamguushiirg	E8A6A9C-0

One is our familiar hellhole of a religious dictatorship Saazi, but
Kiisamguushiirg (named for the sound you make, slipping below the surface
of this water world?) is pretty much improbable. Stone age billions living
in the water.

On the whole, however, the distribution of tech and pop seem to be well
correlated, with most of the higher population worlds hovering around TL-9
to TL-B. This also implies (since TL-9 includes Jump Drive) that a large
majority (66% of all the sectors\' population) live in starfaring
societies at year 0 (or is FS year 20? I forget.)  

But on the Tech side, the higher tech levels seem to gravitate toward the
middle population worlds (6 to 9) with a large number around 0, to 4. 
These however are reasonable for higher tech outposts, such as mining
colonies, and naval depots and such like. Still the distribution is skewed
towards lowpop/hitech worlds pretty heavily:  (I apologize in advance if
this comes out messed up, use a monspaced font to see it)

Ok, red & blue shifts I remember. However, the concept I am having a problem
with is travel times.  Example:

Ship is at point A, chugging at 270,000 kps, emits a radar pulse at 300,000
kps, effective speed difference is only 30,000 kps. The radar pulse will
never exceed the speed of light, relative to anything. The pulse travels 1
second  out from the ship when it encounters an object at 300,000 klicks
from point A. Call this point B. At the same time the pulse is travelling,
so is the ship, which has reached point C, 270,000 klicks from point A. The
effective distance between the ship and the object is only 30,000 klicks.
The reflected pulse is now returning to the ship at 300,000 kps, the ship is
moving towards the pulse at 270,000 kps, and the distance each must cover is
only 30,000 klicks. At best the two will meet at 15,000 klicks from the
object at point B. The ship\'s computers and crew have .05 (5 hundreths) of a
second to react and dodge the object.

This, I think, puts a damper on relativistic travel. The faster you go, the
less able you become to see where you are going. You can\'t exploit
relativity until you get a fair percent the speed of light; but at a fair
percent the speed of light, you can\'t effectively see where you are going.
At least with active sensors; passives would collect data as well as
passives ever have, but would that be effective for planning a course?

It would, and that sort of thing makes for fascinating detail -- used
sparingly.  The problem is the sheer number of Barren worlds with middling
tech levels.  Let\'s take just Antares, the first sector in the data
listing, with its 553 worlds.  Of those, 156 (28%) are Barren.  Let\'s take
just the first ten of those Barren worlds -- _none_ of which, you\'ll note,
have zero tech levels.

0103 Lampigas E000000-5

Interesting....  I could see, for example, a group of Vilani or other
Second-Empire relics slowly dwindling away throughout the Long Night,
losing tech and population, finally giving out due to disease, disaster,
or dissension amidst their WWI-tech life support systems.  Perhaps the
planet is a prime archaeological/artistic site for the body of literature
they left behind -- "The Lays of Lampigas" are the hottest thing right now
for those who can make out the obscure Vilani dialect.

But entropy is an eternal enemy: how much time can exist between a
culture\'s disappearance and the dissolution of useful technological
relics?  How many cultures have just happened to expire, conveniently
right in time for their remains to be picked over by Third Imperium
scouts?   Again, I can accept this one rarely, but not repetitively.

0110 Irduukam E798000-3

With a G2V star, this planet is crying out for colonization -- except for
that atmosphere taint.  Okay, an episode of violent vulcanism (on the
scale of the Deccan Traps, say) wiped out the Colonial-tech non-human
native race, and the air is full of dust and sulfur.  Again, how long will
their clockwork last without rusting?

0112 Khaar La D525000-6

Very Thin, tainted atmosphere, 1960\'s-era tech level?  Okay... the natives
engaged in global nuclear warfare which scarred the surface and ejected
their atmospheric envelope (which is almost impossible to do realistically,
but we\'ll presume it started thin).  What\'s left of their tech?  How long
will it last?  Why did they time their autogenocide so conveniently?

What does a "tech level" mean, anyway -- what can be produced by the
inhabitants locally, whatever happens to be lying around, or whatever
looks like it probably was in common use before it got broken by elemental
exposure, etc.?  If the latter, even failed colonies in 1100 (e.g.
Vanejen) should have a good shot at still being listed with Imperial-level
tech -- it may well still be around, after all, even if it is broken. 

0115 Gii (one of several) C87A000-7

An idyllic waterworld, formerly 1970\'s-era tech.  Um... a worldwide swine
flue style pandemic swept through, and killed all the population.  Even
though it happened centuries ago, and their floating cities have all sunk 
(including their class C starport?) and their intentionally-submerged ones
are flooded and full of barnacles, is the planet still TL7?

0126 Daakhaan B515000-7

Trace atmosphere, 1970\'s tech.  We already used the thermonuclear schtick. 
Here a rogue star blew through (that pesky M5D secondary companion....),
disrupted the planetary orbits, and the whole planet is now a deep-freeze
a la Fritz Leiber\'s "A Bucket-full of Air."  Good thing that \'70\'s tech is
built to last....  Especially that class-B starport, probably the world\'s
spaceport.  Is it still capable of providing refined fuel and annual
maintenance?  At TL7?  The Imperium doesn\'t exist out here yet, so the
starport can\'t be maintained by an outside administration with extrality,
etc. (unless the League of Antares is already out this way -- but why
would they want to subsidize a dead, formerly-TL7 world?) 

0131 Nira Am C587000-9

1990\'s tech?  A bit early to accept that they all left town of a sudden.
Nice dense, untainted atmosphere, so if it was another Deccan-disaster
or asteroid strike there\'s been plenty of time for the dust to settle (and
the TL9 tech is still around?)  Already did the plague.  Everybody died of
starvation waiting to log on to their version of AOL?  The planet is the
former site of a Jonestown-style religious commune who came all the way
out here (and built a C starport?!) to kill themselves?  See, I\'m not even
ten worlds into the listing and I\'m starting to have trouble justifying
all the still-existing tech on barren worlds.

0132 Arkiiin (not a valid Vilani word?) D565000-5

Nice planet.  WWI tech.  Couldn\'t have been the swine flu from above --
neither planet has/had interstellar travel, and as referee I\'m honor-bound
not to abuse the same plot thread too often.  Slavers, that was it:
slavers have made off with the entire population of the planet, and
they\'re all working the mines for the anarchists of Nuush next door
(Antares 0133), who don\'t include slaves in the level-2 population of
their tech-C planet.  (Which is Poor, so why didn\'t the Nuushians move
here instead of moving this population there?  Gosh, they\'re hidebound).

0211 Loki Khuu B324000-8

Very thin, tainted atmosphere, 1980\'s tech.  The minor race that lived
here committeed suicide, to the last being, when their high-priest saw
the relevant celestial portents.  In reality, it was that pesky Third
Imperium scout ship making its deorbit burn, only to find yet another
recently-deceased culture with technology still intact.

Is this starting to feel like the "cemetary worlds" of the New Era yet? 
Most of these cultures ought to be dead for _hundreds_ of years of Long
Night, not the decades of TNE\'s Short Nap.  So there shouldn\'t be much
useful tech left except for archaeologists to pore over -- and does that
deserve to be part of the UPP code? 

0220 Gisashnaa C545000-7
0223 Ganshe    D645000-7

Similar sizes, both with thin, tainted atmospheres and similar
hydrographics, and 1970\'s tech levels.  Obviously one planet was settled
by the (TL7? er... hey!  FF&S alternate technologies!) interstellar-
teleporting natives of the other, who found the new world quite
hospitable.  Then the great Hand of Game Balance squashed every single one
of them to leave a puzzle for Our Heroes to discover, even if their
cerebella aren\'t convoluted correctly to use the device, which we\'ll
conveniently destroy anyway in the finale.

I don\'t think I\'m suffering from a deficit of inventiveness, despite
"giving up" on the last two of the ten above.  But can you really imagine
doing fifteen times the work above -- just for one of the nine sectors
that FS covers?

I was worried when the FS format was first being debated on the list.  I
loved GDW\'s original sectors: Spinward Marches & Solomani Rim.  There were
some odd combinations, sure, but all in all the sectors _felt_
thought-out, with interesting tidbits thrown in to the write-ups here and
there.  I loathed DGP\'s massive, completely random, completely untouched
sectors -- it was data for data\'s sake.  With no thought or development
work invested, what was the use, since each referee would just _have_ _to_
make his or her own modifications and assumptions?  At that rate, it would
be more honest just to recommend people generate their own sectors and fit
them in to the Imperium. 

Here with FS we seem to be getting the worst of the DGP approach: massive
amounts of random detail without thought as to the underlying politics or
situations.  We don\'t even have the centuries of settled Imperial society
to use to explain away anomalies -- which is why random data suddenly
sticks in my craw so much more for Milieu:0 than for Milieu:1100.  That\'s
why, way back when TML was first discussing the subject, I proposed
releasing sectors gradually, in association with the Milieu books, so
there\'d be time to do them sensibly.  Instead the completists seem to have
won the day, and completely random data will swamp us again.  And that
frustrates me.

Please, Marc, make Traveller better than just a set of random numbers.
Make it consistent, and sensible, and creative, and inventive and
fascinating, in all the ways that it can be.  Don\'t let the random
bit-flips of your computer and a desire to be "hands-off" and let the
chips fall where they may create a mockery of a galatic tapestry for
Milieu:0 to play itself out over.

Thanks for monitoring the list and keeping us all up to date.  I look
forward to your response.

This is where I get shaky in relativity; is it the objective universe that

Ah, so I am not entirely crazy (just eccentric). Now to the next question,
at what speed does the shift problem begin to show up. Is it before or after
an exploitable relativistic effect is achieved. By exploitable, I mean one
where the crew of the ship could make a round trip to another star without
requiring the ship include a mobile retirement home.

I kind of like 5/10/20/20/40, but then, I feel that about half the worlds
out there are either barren, or are in the very early stages of
colonization.  From an earlier post, I claimed that roughly 10 percent of
all worlds were high ppulation worlds, which covered the class A and B
places fairly well.  (Note that 1/12th of all worlds should be high pop.)


I have been playing that the FS data is correct for 001-0000.

Drop pods filled with sand casters, programmed to fire sand clouds around
the periphery of the drop envelope, coupled with aggresive fire suppresion
by support ships/fighters.

Also, I\'ll be doing everything I can to win the Electronic war, so I\'ll
probably be jamming your sensors.  You\'ll be depending on visual target
accquisition.

Every defense has a counter.  Fire a false drop of deadfall munitions,
watch what opens up, plaster it.  whiole the dfenders try to find
themselves the real drop begins.

The late, and unlamented, RDF was a collections of divisions designed to
reinforce Europe during a soviet attack.  They were rapid because they made
use of equipment stored in Germany and eastern France, negating the need to
haul thousands of vehicles overseas.  The original RDF was mutated in the
80s into something that wasn\'t very Rapid, Deployable, and didn\'t have much
Force.

Take a look at Desert Shield.  After Bush ordered the ready brigade of the
82nd Airborne to Saudi, it was over a week before the first troops arrived,
and for a very long and nerve wracking time, the only forces over there
were light infantry- the 82nd and the Marines.  If Saddam had  struck south
at that point, they would have been annihlated.  It took three months to
assemble the XVIIIth Airborne Corps, with all its vehicles, and units were
still arriving just days prior to the start of the air war.

When it comes to defending a world, think of it this way..  If I have to
take San Francisco, there\'s no good reason for me to land my stike force
right on the waiting guns.. I\'ll seize a beachhead in the Central Valley,
or in the High Desert, and bring down my heavies.  You can\'t be
everywhere.. and all I need is a a day or so to secure my hold.

I purposely left the subject of Navy-Army relations vague, prefering to
focus on the organization of the Army.  Her are a few more details.

The Subsector Navies exist mainly to provide heavy transport capability to
the local Army units.  Along with minor fleet elements (rarely heavier than
Heavy Cruisers (80ktons)), the Subsector Navy is the primary operator of
Transport Squadrons.

During any joint operation, a single supreme commander is selelcted.  If
the mission is the capture of an enemy world, this will likely be the
senior Army commander.  That commander has legal authority over *all*
Imperial forces in his operation.  Failure to obey his orders is mutiny,
punishble by death.  A smart commander will listen when the senior Navy
officer makes suggestions about ship employment, but the final decision,
and responsiblity is his alone.

When in defence, the senior commander is usually Navy.  While the Army
prepares on the planet\'s surface, the Admiral can make the tactical
decisions, up to and including withdrawl.

>The lack of cooperation between regular and colonial units could cause
>truely distasterous screwups in a spacebattle.

It is true that the difference between Colonial and Regular Army forces are
pronounced, this isn\'t as true in the Navy.  While Subsector forces might
be using obselete equipment, their training and tactics are the same as the
Imperial Navy\'s.

I think that force is designed to be shipped to prepostioned Equipment
by jet liner and really is limited to hot spots on the globe rather than
pick and fight anywhere.

I would also doubt that it could get anywhere in large enough quanities
to do any good in just 24hours from cold.

I need some help with displaying info.

My goal, in short, is to make Career Specific Planetary Profiles, something 
along the lines of the World Builder\'s Handbook form (IS Form 23, Detailed 
World Data) but customized to each profession\'s needs.

For example, the WBH form is fine for the average Scout or explorer, but if 
you are an Entertainer, Scholar, or Naval Officer, your information needs 
would be different.  The Entertainer wouldn\'t care about the geophysical 
make up of the planet, just the major cities, local customs, law levels and 
hazards.  The Scholar would want information focused towards their specific 
field (Demographics, archeological sites, detailed geophysics, etc).  The 
Naval Officer would want a catalog of planets, their satellites, bases, 
military strengths and population data.

A merchant would want details on where the goods are in the system and 
where the buyers are (If the Striegenite mines and smelters are in the 
belt, go there instead of landing on the mainworld and paying someone to 
ship it in!).

I\'m basing this form off of the "Regency World Data Form" by... well, I 
forget who right now, but it\'s a nice form, if it weren\'t a low-res bitmap. 
 I\'m creating my forms in MS Publisher (hey, don\'t knock it----I didn\'t have 
to take a college course to learn how to use it!) and plan to export them 
as high-res JPEG\'s or post-script files.

My problem is when I come to the section on military data.  What should I 
be recording here?  Total size of the army?  Weapon and Transport TLs? 
(imported or natively made?) What would you want to see in an \'at a glance\' 
report on Planet Frobniz\'s military (ground, wet navy, atmospheric and 
space)

If I have to I\'ll coin my own UxPs to cover these categories (hmmm... "Gee 
Jorge, it says here that their space force\'s UPP is 3B9D5.  What\'s that 
mean?")

If your suggestion is a nit, send it directly to me at

I know this has been said before, but: REALITY SHIFT! WARNING! WARNING!

In the MT Referee\'s Companion it says that the Second Imperium achieved TL
12 in -2210. It also says that the Third Imperium made TL 12 in -150, TL 13
in 300 and TL 14 in 700. The book says \'achieved\', not \'had an average TL\'
or \'this TL was common\'. To me this implies that to all intents and
purposes these TLs weren\'t availible until the listed dates. 

Does IG want us to belive that the 1st or 2nd Imperium had worlds with a TL
that the 3rd Imperium took 700 years to reach? There\'s no way the Vilani
would\'ve allowed that sort of TL in their subject worlds, and their own
limit was an absolute TL 11 - otherwise the Terran J-3 breakthrough
woulldn\'t have meant anything. The Terrans are unlikely to be responsible,
as (as far as I know) Terra, etc. never made it past TL 12.

Not only that with 18 high Hi pop worlds at TL 13, I don\'t see how the
Syleans stayed at the centre of things. After all this means that 6% of the
Hi pop worlds are of a higher TL than the Imperium.

BTW Is the pop level \'B\' correct? If so where did it first turn up?

IMO T4 is like TNE in feel, even if the relics are limited to TL 12- and
I\'m not too sure why some people who didn\'t like TNE\'s feel seem to like
that of T4 - I mean they\'re both about reconstruction.

IMHO, if anything, there should be *fewer* binary & trinary systems. I

If I understand it correctly, it is your perceived *time* that changes.

As you approach the speed of light, you observe the universe "speeding 
up". A clock outside of your frame of reference appears to run more 
quickly.

So if you were a photon moving at the speed of light, you would observe 
the entire life of the universe in an instant. Perhaps everywhere isn\'t 
the correct word, it\'s "everywhen".

"No matter when you go, there you are."

:)

Since you\'re moving, you also perceive yourself to be "everywhere" in 
that instant.

But I may be confusing things here... I admit my knowledge is amateur at 
best.

drop 70 pods. I remember that some decoy and jammer types, but about 120 all

	Can I do this one for the THWAP?  Please?  Pretty please?

	Actually, I think that the THWAP is a darn useful idea.  Gives the
world building fans something to compete over, gives everybody scads and
scads of useful worlds to use in their campaigns, everybody has fun, and so
forth.

	Of course, we\'d need a standardized format.  Are there any out there?

    'body' => 'This is my first post to this list and I will try not to offend anyone,
however I need to say a couple of things just to feel better...

I\'ve been involved in Traveller since the late \'70\'s. In fact it was the
second RPG I played and the first I bought. After a few years the game
group I played with broke up, it had been a combination of RPG\'ers and
historical gamers and fights over the type of games to play caused the
split.

I backed off from Traveller when MT came out, having invested more money
than I could afford in the original, a growing familly, work, all the
usual stuff, getting in the way. When TNE came out I picked up a couple
of the books and tought to try and start gaming again. Unfortunately I
could get more that occational players together and none wanted to
invest in a new game, nor the time involved in learning the extensive
backround to catch most of the hints I threw into the games. It (the
infant campaign) drifted into limbo.

Then I learned about GDW going under. It wasn\'t an emmotional thing to
me, being on the fringes of gaming anyway. When I read of IG and Mark
Miller picking Traveller up and re-writing it with th efocus on rules
more in line with the CT rules I\'d used for years (years ago)my interest
level jumped up again.

I purchased the basic rules and Starshipd over the internet, since not
ONE store in my area (So. Jersey) carried it! To be honest I was
disappointed with the product. I haven\'t quite grasped the TASK system
as written, but I could see some good things (to me) in the Chargen, and
other areas. 

Starships was dismal. One of the things I loved about CT was the
starships. I had designs and deckplans everywhere. After the beautifully
crafted deck plans from the TAS and GDW\'s source books and suppliments,
this book was... well I won\'t say it.

Anyway to point off all this is that I\'m one of the diappointed ones to,
but one ray of light stood out. While learning about IG on the net I
also learned about this list. This, I thought, was my answer. Oh, well,
if I can\'t find a game group, and the rules aren\'t what I\'d like to see,
maybe the people on this list would fill the void, so to speak. At least
I could game vicariously (role playing at role playing?). Unfortunately
I\'m afraid that the flamewars are  going to kill this list. I personally
would regret this. So saying I would like to add my humble voice to
those calling for reason and moderation! Everyone should be able to
voice his/her opinion! But let\'s also use a little moderation. Why drive
more people away than needs to?

I read the posts that started a lot of this. Refering to Paul Walker\'s
"Confessions" post I understood waht he was trying to say. Perhaps his
words upset some people, but think aboout what he was trying to convey
and a LITTLE less about how he said it. 

When I read Ken\'s post I took it as a joke as well. Twolf over reacted!
But Ken, admit it, you did too (just a little maybe.. huh?). 

At this point I think it would be best all around to see it all dropped.
I don\'t really expect it to be but one can always hope!

Anyway this is just my 2 cents worth!

What about adding a trade classification like "R4" where the R stands for ruined civilization and the number stands for the Techlevel of the ruined civilization. Any comments on this idea?

For those who don\'t know what I\'m talking about, the Dorsai are a subrace of Humans that have specializied in Soldiering and Military arts. They are from Gordon Dicksons "Chylde (SP?) Cycle".


How would you go about making such a race? Making a superior soldier race without making them all into supermen would be kind of interesting. Any ideas out there?

Hi, I\'m not currently running a game, and the Traveller game I was playing
in (a CT/MT/T4 mix) only lasted a few (great fun) sessions. However I am
currently setting up a non-canon game in my own universe using TNE.

My group (which is to say, the group of which I\'m a member...) started with
Bushido back in 1981, then moved to Runes in Space in 1982.  We all loved
the Imperium but didn\'t much care for the original Traveller rules (we were
young then, and foolish...), so we took Runequest, Other Suns (FGU\'s
RQ-like SFRPG), and combined them with all of the Traveller backround...
We played this, intermingled with bouts of RQ and Call of Cthulhu, until MT
came out.  MT was nice because it let us play Traveller using Traveller
rules!  Still intermingling with bouts of RQ, we continued until TNE came
out.  Some of the players were a tad daunted by TNE\'s depth of detail so we
fiddled about with other games until T4 came out.  Now we\'re playing
Traveller again.  

BTW - What I like about T4 is that it got the local group to play Traveller
again - with clear, simple rules that, though NOT bug-free, DID get us
playing...

Yep!  Agree with that.  Grease the appropriate palms and you too can

Right. So where\'s the allegiance codes? I think the data needs to have a 
two digit allegiance code, has it just not been inserted yet? Even a "Na" 
for Non-aligned worlds or "--" for barren ones will do.

It\'s good to get a feel for the political alliances, and trade allegances.

It sure doesn\'t fit mine. I spend about $300 a month for food, which is
very high since I eat at restaraunts a lot. On the other hand, my rent is
$650 a month for a third-floor walk-up in the dreary section of town. A
co-worker spends $1200 a month for a downtown bachelor suite. This is in
Vancouver, BC, Canada. I imagine the situation would be worse in New York
or Tokyo.

I thought of that just a few minutes before your post came through (funny
how the mind can work like that). However, except for the my comments on
Sylea being the only planet to maintain ship building during the long
night, I still feel what I originally wrote holds. ie: very few class A
starports in M0. Anyone agree? Disagree? Care? =)

	This made me remember something about the Spinward Marches sector that was
first published in Supplement 3 back in the good ol\' days of 1979.

	I once remember seeing two Heronis, but further investigation reveals that
there are seven(!) occurences of duplicate names in The Marches. They are...

Aramis - Aramis and Trin\'s Veil subsectors at 3110 and 2540
Heroni - Rhylanor and Mora subsectors at 3017 and 2521
Inthe - Regina and Glisten subsectors at 2410 and 2234
Kinorb - Regina and Rhylanor subsectors at 2202 and 2512
Margesi - Vilis and Rhylanor subsectors at 1020 and 3212
Mirriam - Vilis and Five Sisters subsectors at 1315 and 0333
Natoko - Aramis and Rhylanor subsectors at 3209 and 2620

	Note how most duplicates exist in Rhylanor. Either the people there
couldn\'t think up there own names, or the subsector was so cool everyone
wanted to be associated with it!

	See ya...

This reminds me of a thread I saw on USENET. What happens if I\'m driving 
a car the speed of light and I turn the headlights on? Can I see where 
I\'m going?

The fundamental mistake you seem to be making is "effective speed 
difference is only 30,000 kps".

Here is *the* basic observation from which all relativity follows: Speed 
of light is constant _in all reference frames_. It is the same for all 
observers. Effective speed difference between a radar pulse (which is 
"light"/electromagnetic radiation) and *anything* is going to be c 
(300,000 kps) *not* 30,000 kps.

I\'m still getting a handle on this relativity stuff myself, and it\'s 
getting late, so I will not figure out the answer to your example using 
the Einstein-Lorentz equations. Sorry.

Reread my post. I said metaldetectors, not x-ray and nowhere do I state
that it was a rifle.
Actually the real thing (made in the real world that is) is also a handgun
of course.

You\'ll have to compare two countries with different law levels and the same
gov code. The opressiveness in ex-soviet has more to do with type of
government than laws. Many of the brutalities that the soviet regime
performed on their citizens were actally contradictory to their written
law.

I can only note that my country Sweden which is a pretty high law level
country especially compared to US and there\'s MUCH less police brutality
here. Either because high law level generally means less brutality or that
US cops are more sadistically inclined take your pick. If you\'d like to
respond to this do it in e-mail as it has gone off topic I think.

How should we denote that a system lacks starport facilities of any kind? E
ports as stated in T4 are minimal systems but uncontacted systems might
have none whatsoever. Those might not be common in M0 but what about Zho
core expedition settings etc?

I\'m not arguing that Traveller should be swedish, just that US culture

here on earth.

these drives and about advanced rockets in general.  

Ion Drives and MPD (Magnetoplasmadynamic) are the two most fuel efficient
drives listed.  However, both are very low acceleration.  MPD is basically
limited to 1% of a G or less.  Now, this is a pretty small acceleration. 
I was wondering how one would go about increasing the acceleration of an
ion or MPD drive.  My first thought would be to increase fuel consumption. 

If you double (or increase by 10X) the fuel consumption, does that double
(or increase by 10X) the thrust, or is the relation between the two more
complex?  Also, do you need twice as much power to power it, or with the
same power plant work to heat and eject twice as much fuel. 

Thanks-

Solomani Rim is that most of them have had their names changed to 
Vilani names. However, i feel that since the Ramshackle Empire should 
have also had it s influence in it s 500 year rule, so there should 
be more of the solomani names already. Names in the area of Sylea 
should also be more Solomani influenced.

In Zarushagar, there should be worlds in Wolf and Oasis subsector 
which still belong to the duchy of oasis, who as TD 21, 21 puts it 
were reluctant to join (...)" (the Third Imperium). It also sais that 
in the Rebellion many worlds banded together to form the duchy 
again", so it can be assumed that most of them were part of the duchy 
back in year 0. 

zar 3230 Guudanmi must be changed back to Oasis since without an 
Oasis" there wouldn t be a duchy bearing that name! It s TL should at 
least be A, if not B.
I ll check more in ZAR later.

On to CORE:
2118 Sylea: i can only wonder why this one has been changed. The data 
in M:0 made more sense (almost identical to TD9, except for TL): Law 
level of 0 is not right on the capital of the 3I. It should rather be 
A586A98-C, maybe a little lower in the pop department to leave some 
space for growth later on.
0722 Kuuda, Rename to F\'rnow (see TD 9, 35)
0622 Uurgigi, Rename to Sketola (same ref.) Was member of Int. Conf 
under that name.
0128 Sheki, Rename to Protalus, reason, see above. (earliest 
mentioned date: -239)
1623 aggaa Irpu, Already known as Velpare in -258.

I could go on with this name-change liest forever in Core:
I strongly recommend not changing a single name in the Core Sector 
from the 1108-1116 dgp data. Core was already well known enough by 
Syleans, and new names had already been well established (see 
examples above!)! 
I have not yet gone into the UPP s here! I\'ll do that later. Maybe 
the CORE group could donate something to that extent???

General notes:
Names that are Vilani originally should remain with their original 
names, not be given new Vilani Name. 
Question: Should Frontier regions like Corridor be allowed to have 
LoPop planets with highly developed Starports over level C? 
Likelyhood of 1 them being built and 2 them surviving the long night 
seems low to me...
Also: Vland and Corridor should be limited to TL B, since that was 
the highest that the First Imperium achieved. TL C should be only far 
in between and as for TL s higher than D, they should be impossible 
in M:0


Antares Sector:
ant 2117 Irgi 
- -> Ch28, 31 Name change to: Gashukubi (First Imperium) UPP change to: 
X160056-H 
    Named by Vilani during 1I

Corridor Sector:
Only named that in 140. Name before that: Eneri!!!
Generally too high starport levels for frontier area. Should have 
many more X es, since Corridor only became important when the 3I 
started colonizing Deneb. 
Also, many of the worlds already had vilani names in the DGP-listing. 
Shouldn t those worlds keep that name?

cdr 1511 Luug.(will later be Depot-Corridor, before that 
unpopulated!) UPP->X686000-0
    MTJ 3, 74
cdr 2511 Khegakiir:  Rename Naagasa.... 800 people with starport B?   
    MTJ 2,8
cdr 1711 Giiku Es: Rename Naadi 90 people with starport B?      MTJ 
2,8
cdr 1413 Gamin:   Rename Itasis Nobody with TL 7 and Starport D?    
MTJ 2,8
cdr 0312 Amki:     Rename Muugaagen                 MTJ 2,8
cdr 1209 Kaasu, name stays, but was Mining Colony in Vilani Times, so 
UPP should be more in the area of BA7A540-B (max.)  
cdr 1606 Remains as it is, see history in MT 2, 50
cdr 2806 Ishkad Rename to Uughrae               TD 18, 15

This list for corridor / eneri is by no means complete but forms a 
first basis for discussion, i hope. Concerning the name changes (of 
which there are many more) i also feel that some planets should have 
a change of name anyway, just to add spice, but as it is, too many 
have changed. TL, Starports and Pop digits are generally too high for 
my taste, so a change downward might be appropriate.
I hope this is a good start for our discussion.

The only other place that X ports *really* make sense are on pre-space
worlds that haven\'t been contacted before. Or on Barren worlds.

Once a world has been contacted, unless it is interdicted, they\'ll have
made provision for future ships. For worlds with radio, it may be a
case of calling in on the frequency of a local airoprt or seaport (or
even major rail junction) that has a suitable landing site nearby. They
answer, confirm that the site is clear and contact the local government
about getting customs officials out.

For pre-radio worlds, comm may be via heliograph (laser on ship, mirror
and sunlight on ground) or via a sealed radio unit left behind for the
local government. Or you may just be allowed to land and then wait for
the locals to show up to haggle (likely for preindustrial civilizations).

Hmmmm... A pilots guide to various E ports might be worth a JTAS
writeup. What do you think sirs?

Possible materials are everything from rammed earth (it\'ll work for
small ships, and work even better if a reaction drive ship uses it a
few times) to cleared (and leveled) bedrock, to stonework such as found
in Roman roads.

I can see that I\'ll have to add a Soundex check of the names to the

Well, one of the reasons that we have all this length contraction, time
dilation etc is because of the *observed fact* that the speed of a
light beam (or radar pulse) is the *same* regardless of how fast you
are moving.

So the radar pulse still sees the same amount ahead, it\'s just that
most things are coming at you rather fast. And that cuts down the
warning time. Worse, at those speeds a grain of sand can vaporise an
entire ship. 

Pushing the speed of light has it\'s hazards...

Because an hour of "minimum wage" doesn\'t *buy* the same amount in
different places. Especially in different countries. A rule of thumb
I\'ve heard for comparing the standard of living in different countries
is this:

	How many hours does a journeyman carpenter have to work to buy
a kilo of the local bread?

The mere fact that the answer is different in different places should
tell you a *lot* about the realitities of economic comparisons.

1. the same amount of the same currency has a purchasing power that
   varies from place to place.
2. the same work has a value (both in currency and in buying power)
   that varies from place to place.
3. the value (both in currency and the "real" value) of a commodity
   varies from place to place.

And note that the *way* these things vary is subject to *political* as
well as economic forces. Tariffs can raise costs. Government rules can
set wages. Etc, etc.

problems. I\'ve already found some of them. Here I present one, along with
suggested changes for 41 UWPs. Marc, please let us know if you actually
decide to incorporate the changes.

	Carlos.

PROBLEM: There are 41 Barren worlds with B or A starport in the sector
(mainly B). This just does not fit with the M:0 framework. Moreover, the
sector has clearly too many B starports.

SUGGESTED CHANGE: Take the 41 Barren worlds with A or B starports and change:
	1.- Change the A/B starport to E (I would say to X, but it seems that there
are no more X starports in Traveller).
	2.- Change the Tech Level to 0 (there\'s nobody there, and with E starport,
there\'s in fact nothing around, so TL is nonsense).

	This way, two problems will be simultaneously fixed. The subsector will
have a more M:0 appearance, with less B starports and much more empty worlds

	Marc, for your convenience, here you can find the 41 changed UWPs (for the
TML, it\'s just a page, so I hope nobody thinks is a waste of bandwidth):

enormous scale of the effects that their inclusion in the Traveller universe
would have. They hold an enormous fraction (I estimate roughly 1/3) of the
population of the universe, and they are only 7 worlds! Such worlds would
totally change the face of the universe. Statistically speaking, they are
total outliers...
	These worlds create curious situations: The population of Corridor is more
than twice that of Vland. Well, it\'s not surprising, since there is a world
with 800 thousand million inhabitants (800 billion for you in the US). The
whole sector has just 1,113 thousand million.

between 0 and 0)"... what a funny typo, I thought... unfortunately, its
worse than that.
	The Vland sector is full of TL 0 (ZERO) worlds. Dozens and dozens of them.
The problem is that those worlds are not barren, and have no X starports.
Take a look, for instance, at the Answerin homeworld:

0431 Answerin    B-5848BB-0

	How can we have a world with 500 million inhabitants and a B starport, at
TL 0? According to the CT/MT/T4 rules, that B starport gives a DM of +4 for
rooling TL, that should be 1D+4, i.e. some number between 5 and 10.
Certainly, not zero. some more examples:

0232 Shimshirar  E9C7755-0  Fl
0637 Bood          A240100-0   Po De Lo
0740 Kirov           B683644-0   Ni Ri
0801 Diir             E62A788-0   Wa
1313  Aadas        C778666-0   Ag Ni
1437  Igikuuni       B797755-0   Ag

	I could go on with dozens of examples like this... Igikuuni should have a
DM of +6, implying a TL between 7 and 12.

	The problem seems to be specific of Vland sector. In Massilia sector, there
is not even a single one TL 0 world (in fact, there is the opposite problem:
how comes dozens of Barren worlds have high TLs?) In other sectors, there
are a few TL 0 worlds that should be a bit more advanced, like Arkauummesh
(Antares 1132, E-694555-0 Ag Ni). There are at least 4 cases in Antares and
two in Gushemege. But in Vland, there around 60 (SIXTY) non-barren, non
LowPop, TL 0 worlds.

	I\'ve gone through the Data File for Massilia, looking for
compatibility problems with other traveller products. Massilia was
presented in the Knightfall adventure, where the library data from TD 11
was reproduced, and many worlds where detailed in one-page write-ups.
One subsector (Shiwonee) was presented at TD 11, along with a several-
page write-up for one world and details on the Geonee.
	I\'ve found compatibility problems indeed, and I am presenting
them here, along with suggested fixes. I will continue to examine the
data, now looking for possible internal consistency problems.
	Marc, please let me know if you actually make the changes.

	Carlos the Geonee-maker, Massilia chartographer ;-)

=====================================================================
Format: n.- Name (M:0 / 1120)
	D) Problem data in data file
	P) Explanation of the problem
	S) Suggested change

MAJOR COMPATIBILITY PROBLEMS:

1.- Eruur / Far Trinity
=======================
D) mas	1025	Eruur .	E767774-3	Ag Ri 	 	301	F4 V M9 D
P) This world, known as Far Trinity in 1120, was extensively presented in
Traveller Digest 11. Quote: "It is not known exactly when the system was
first colonized, though there is evidence that a small outpost may have
existed as early as 159. It is currently believed that the first colonists
were part of a \'lost expedition\', eventually crashing on the world and
reduced by environmental hardships and misfortune to a very primitive
technological (some might say barbaric) state."
	So, a 30 million population in M:0 does not fit, specially since, in
1120, it has only 6 millions according both to TD 11 and the Knightfall
adventure.
S) Change UWP to:  E767000-0  Ba  001

2.- Aankhi An / Anamoni
=======================
D) mas	1510	Aankhi An.	B99A751-A	Wa 	 203 F7 D
P) According to Knightfall, "Anamoni was settled in the late 400s... entire
planet surface is ice...". So, the planet should be Barren.
S) Change UWP to:  E99A000-0  Ba Wa  003

3.- Mia / Riarette
==================
D) mas	1808	Mia.	B110788-B	Na 	 314	F4 VI
P) According to Knightfall, this world was first settled by Vilani refugees
during the RoM, but the colony died out. In year 50, 3I scouts discovered
the artifacts, which yielded unspoiled information about the Ziru Sirka
culture.   So, there should not be a population of 30 million there.
	Also, the star type was F6 VI in Knightfall. It has changed.
S) Change UWP and star type to: E110000-0  Ba  014  F6 VI

4.- Kashikka / Wikk
===================
D) mas	2010	Kashikka.	B648224-8	LoPop 	 224	F3 V M7 D
P) According to Knightfall, "Wikk was originally settled in the 600s". This
poses no problem for the population (Low, can be anything), but does not
fit well with a B starport.
S) Change UWP to: E648000-0  Ba  024

5.- Murcia / Murcia
====================
D) mas	2109	Murcia	E564100-5	LoPop 	 	814	K2 V
P) According to Knightfall, Murcia was originally settled during the RoM
(I believe it: Murcia is the name of a spanish province), but Vilani
concepts and culture allowed the locals to survive through the Long
Night. They joined the 3I in their early years. But I do not see just 80
people as the Long Night survivors asking to become a member of the
3I.
S) Chane UWP to:  E56489A-5  Ri  814

6.- The Rebin Empire
====================

D) mas	0212	Enrique	C200A87-B	Na Ind HiPop Va 	 504	F1 V M8 D
mas	0213	Kaaar Gemaar .	B9E78CC-A	Fl 	 	702	M7 II G0 D

mas	0315	Uurki Guurk .	C100000-9	Va Ba 	 	000		M5 V
P)	According to Knightfall and TD 11 (Massilia Library Data), the
Rebin Empire (0212, 0213, 0214, 0312, 0314, 0315) was a Pocket
Empire around Year Zero. Rebin (0312) is the homeworld of a highly
technological, matriarchal culture that settled the inhospitable systems
around itself in the latter part of the Long Night. Although in 1120 Rebin
itself is reserved for noble estates, with a Pop of 20,000, it should not be
the same in year zero if Rebin has settled the inhospitable systems
around itself in "the latter part of the Long Night". Or, at least, it should
not have ZERO population, as it\'s the case. And, in any case, there is no
reason to put Vilani names on these worlds. The names of the worlds
would have to correspond with the local ones, or, at least, the
homeworld, Rebin, should be called Rebin, given that (quote Knightfall)
"The powerful matriarchy of Rebin dates as far back as any historical
records exist". As three of the six names coincide between the porpesed
ones and the 1120 ones, the easiest thing is to change the other three.
	On the other hand, if in 1120 (under the 3I) various worlds are
colonies, they should also be colonies in 1120, with captive
governments. Governments type 8 or 4 do not fit well with the history.
Charismatic oligarchy (C) could be discussed, but poses no real problem.
	Also, system 0315 being barren puts it out of the "settled
planets". It would be more consistent if the planet had population, so it
would be good to change it to LoPop.
S) Change the names and stats to:
mas	0212	Enrique	C200A67-B	Na Ind HiPop Va 504		F1 V M8 D
mas	0213	Naston  B9E78CC-A	Fl 	 	702		M7 II G0 D
mas	0214	Shigi	D648864-6		 	513		G0 V
mas	0312	Rebin	A88A736-C	Wa 	 	502		F9 VI M5 D
mas	0314	Ergo	A200766-E	Na Va 	 	204		F6 D
mas	0315	Abarre	C10046A-9	Va LoPop 	700		M5 V

7.- The Geonee worlds
=====================
D) Newly generated Vilani names for 7 of the 8 Geonee "traditional" worlds:
	0928, 1027, 1028, 1130, 1131, 1330, 1430 (1029 has its Geonee name)
mas	0928	Duuir .	
mas	1027	Inkhuug .
mas	1028	Lalii  .	
mas	1029	Lagna	
mas	1130	Duundam E.	
mas	1131	Vluuper Pim.	
mas	1328	Kiimda .	
mas	1330	Muusha  .
mas	1430	Asadug .
P) There is no reason to put a Vilani name on the homeworld of the
Geonee, nor in the rest of their worlds. The colony at Tlasov (1120),
called Kiimda in the data, could keep its Vilani name, as it is not one of
the eight traditional worlds.
S) Change the names to:
	0928: Rigaal
	1027: Hiponee
	1028: Dreva
	1029: Lagna (i.e., keep it as it is)
	1130: Stenardee
	1131: Ashavakuna
	1330: Prindee
	1430: Shiwonee

Note: The A pop of Shiwonee does not fit very well with the details
presented on TD 11 (the Geonee being nomadic, the temperate zone
moving, impossible to build a large pop), but I\'ve already come up with a
history (orbital cities, advanced wheather control for whole continents,
etc...), so, in fact, I think it\'s better to keep the Hi Pop for the Geonee
homeworld.

	MINOR COMPATIBILITY PROBLEMS:

8.- Kiig Ki / Nilton
====================
D) The star type is F1 VI in the data.
mas	1239	Kiig Ki.	C684522-8	Ag Ni 	 	304	F1 VI
P) It was F1 V in Knightfall.
S) Change it back to F1 V.

9.- Lamgupuuan / Dezik
======================
D) mas	0228	Lamgupuuan.	B9C8326-B	LoPop Fl 	 805	M8 V
P) According to both TD 11 and Knightfall, "Dezik is a subgas giant with
a hydrogen atmosphere... this unparalleled opportunity to study the
processes of planet formation brought the original scientific colony to
Dezik. It has since grown to about 2,500 sophonts (1120) from several
cooperating races". It does not fit well that it has more population (8,000)
in year zero, and, specially, with the B starport. It would be better to keep
it as Barren, so the scientific colony will be established way later.
S) Change UWP to:  E9C8000-0  Ba Fl  005

10.- Uugbi / Gasha
==================
D) mas	1508	Uugbi  .	B250200-C	Po De LoPop 	 824	G4 D
P) According to both TD11 and Knightfall, Gasha is (1120) the location
of a research institute, which colonized Gasha in 453 to study the Ilraiki
race and its evolutionary adaptation to this planet as it grew colder. In
1120, Pop is just 5, so, whatever the reason, it seems that the Ilraiki race
is not counted in the Pop (either they are not truly sentients, or they are
extinguished...). It should be the same in M:0, but, the institue appears at
453, so it is not there, either. So, neither the Pop nor the B starport fit
well, not to speak of the C tech level.
S) Change UWP to:  E250000-0  De Ba  024

    'body' => 'Since we were getting in the subject of "Strange Worlds"  I just wanted to 
say something about my favorite world ever in the history of Traveller, 
Efate.



Year 1100 A646A30-D

Here you have a world ruled by a self perpetuating oligarchy, with a thin 
tainted atmos and lotsa people and a good solid tech, but most 
importantly....NO LAW!  I understand the law level is 0 at this time because 
of the Zhodani occupation or the Ine Givar Terrorist attacks.  The 
Government is a \'provisional\' on set up by the Zho\'s.  For the setting, I\'m 
thinking something very much like French Resistance in WWII, with major 
paranoia because of Zhodani mind reading, and then there are the lovely 
Teleport Commandoes!  Yes, Anarchy with Plasma Rifles, gotta love that! :)

After the war, not much changed.  I can bet that the Typical Imperial Efate 
Citizen during the MT era would be vehemently against psionics.  The 
\'provisional government\' was replaced by a council of corporations.  These 
corps specialize in military tech, what better place to \'test\' than on a no 
law world where the populace has had \'experince\' in warfare?   This begins 
to look ver much like a "Bladerunner" or "Gibsonesque" Cyberpunk world, 
without the cyber.  The Corps are in control, the populace are \'edgerunners\' 
doing \'favors\' for "Mr. Johnson" for that new Battle Dress they always 
wanted.

Year 1200 A646A30-F

Well after the Virus Wars, the corps upgraded the tech to F, to better 
produce more military technology to fight against the Virus.  With the 
influx of Zhodani refugees, the friction has increased.  Actualy, No Zho in 
his right mind would want to "emigrate" to Efate(they think Efate is one big 
Insane Asylum), not unless he has got some serious firepower!

On Efate, the first thing you see are people wit big guns, battle dress,, 
etc...  Might makes Right.  It can be a fun world, but unless you are 
prepared, stay in the starport for this world is rough!

Hmmm.  If I recall correctly, hydrographics A simply means the surface is 
around 95% covered by water, but it doesn\'t say how deeply it is covered 
by water.  

\'Course, they could always be living on rafts, I suppose, if you want to 
go with the deep-water theory.

Then there\'s always the possibility that the inhabitants aren\'t humans as 
we know them.  Maybe they have gills, or some other adaptation that 
allows them to live in the water.  Or, if you want to go with the 
shallows theory, they live in and out of the water, as necessary.  

I\'m sure there are other possibilities...

So you land somewhere else on the same planet. The ENTIRE surface

Excellent point. However, this is one of the 1 in 10,000 worlds I

True. I\'d give both of your examples a X rating, only because there\'s
no beacon there. You\'d give them an X rating because there isn\'t a
safe place to land. On that we agree.

However, if a safe landing spot were found on the first world (a
high mountain plateaus known to be geologically stable) and someone
puts a beacon there, it\'s an E starport (in my universe). If a deep
valley is found that is sheltered from the wind, in the second example,
and someone puts a beacon there, it\'s an E starport.

	Maybe you\'re right. I just figured that the per-hour minimum wage would
be a good basis for determining the value of a credit, especially since
this was the supposed basis of the credit\'s value. I wonder what the
Australian minimum wage is compared to US, after being converted to US
dollars? That would give a (somewhat US-centric) constant currency basis
to really compare these two. I suspect that the fact that third world
countries have such dismal incomes when figured in US dollars is
probably as a result of "TL" and "starport" (read, industrial base)
differences. In PE, the real currency value of a Resource Unit is based
on the Gross World Output - the lower the output, the higher the cost of
a given set of resources in constant currency terms.

Okay, I\'m going to play heretic here. (Andrew slips into RPG mode as
Prof. Frederick Hans-Waven, holder of the chair of techno-archology,
Sylean Polytechnica, 1108)

It is commonly supposed that the RoM did not exceed tech level 12 and that
the Ziru Sirka tech level 11. Whilst one can safely assume this to be the case
for the Ziru Sirka, one cannot for the Rule of Man. We know that the Terran
Confederation achieved tech level 12 around -2200, leading to their victory
in the 8th Interstellar War (the invention of jump 3 drives playing a vital
role in that conflict). However the Rule of Man did not come to an end for
another 500 years. To assume that they remained at the lower end of tech
level 12 for this entire period is possibly an error. Whilst the Terrans most
certainly would have not been able to devote the same degree of
resources to research and development, it would seem to go against virtually
everything we know of the early Solomani culture to assume that it simply
came to a grinding halt with the absorbsion of the Ziru Sirka.

Given the 500 year period it is not unreasonable to postulate that the Rule
of Man did indeed advance some considerable way towards tech level 13,
perhaps even breaking through the (hypothetical) boundary into that
level in certain fields. Certainly there are some Imperial and Sylean
publications dating from the founding of the Imperium which do allude
towards a higher level of Rule of Man technology, particularly in the fields
relating to the military and weaponry. I present here an abstract taken from
the first edition of "Carnak\'s Surface Weapons" published on Sylea in 59;
which makes mention of experimental tech level 13 Rule of Man weaponry,
and TL 14 and 15 theoretical studies. This certainly does not fit into our
established view of the Rule of Man\'s technology base. I would dare to
advance that the Rule of Man\'s technology may well have been more
advanced than we (seperated from them by the mists of nearly 3000 years)
currently believe. It is however certain that a large portion of the early
Imperiums research was dedicated to recovering Rule of Man technology;
which would appear illogical if the Sylean\'s had already surpassed that
technology.

This naturally begs the question; if the early founders of the Imperium had
evidence that the Rule of Man achieved better than tech level 12, why do
we in the 12th century of the Imperium hold that they did not? I can find no
records of archological discoveries which invalidated this early evidence
(though they may exist in some dusty archive). I would dare to propose that
the answer may possibly be found in politics. With the succession of the
Solomani from the Imperium, it simply became politically expediant to advance
that the Rule of Man only achieved the bearest of tech level 12, thus helping
to undermine the Solomani claims of racial superiority.

(Andrew takes over from the good professor)

Remember that the canon that the RoM was tech 12 can simply be viewed as
the late Imperial belief that the were; one can allow that to be changed a
little
for M:0 without too much difficulty (heavy emphasis on the little).

   Actually, it is not a case of things shrinking OR of perceptions
   changing.  It is a case of length and time not being /invariant/, ie,
   they are different things in different reference frames.  

   As an analogy, consider velocity.  If I throw food at my brother 
   while we both eat on a jetliner, he gets a 10-mph pie in his face. 
   To an observer on the ground, however, the pie is moving
   substantially faster than 10 mph; it gets a 400-mph `boost\' from the
   airplane.  So how fast is the pie /really/ going?  Answer: it is
   /really/ going at different speeds in different reference frames.
   This is not a question of perception; the velocity of the pie truly
   is different in different reference frames.  Velocity is not an
   invariant, as you probably already know; this is something that
   scientists have understood since the days of Galileo, and something
   that high school students know if they pay attention in Physics I.

   Now, just past the days of Einstein, we understand that length and
   time are not invariants. How far is it /really/ from Sol to Alpha
   Centauri?  Answer: it /really/ depends on your reference frame.  How
   long does it /really/ take for someone to get there?  Again, it
   /really/ depends on your reference frame.  Length and time are not
   invariant in Einsteinian reference frames, although they are
   invariant in the old Galilean reference frames that we learned about
   in Physics I.  Unfortunately, Galilean relativity breaks down at high
   speeds, so we need to use the new, trickier Einsteinian relativity.

   No fundamental mistake at all, actually.  Read on.

   The speed of light is constant in all reference frames, which means
   that it is 300,000 kps in the planetary frame where Garry worked out
   his example, which means that it is only 30,000 kps faster than the
   ship in the planetary frame.  So Garry worked out the problem exactly
   right for the planetary frame, but then he said "crew have .05 of a
   second to react and dodge the object".  That would be true except
   that the ship\'s time is different from the planets\' time.

   Let\'s work it out in the ship\'s frame.  The object is heading towards
   the ship at 0.9c.  When the object is distance 300,000 km away, it
   reflects a radar pulse.  One second later, the crew know of it\'s
   existence, and the object has closed to 30,000 km. The crew now have
   0.11 seconds to react to it.  Note that 300,000 km in the ship\'s
   frame is quite a bit farther than that in the planets\' frame due to
   length contraction, but the advantage of that extra distance is lost
   because the crew\'s time is dialated by the same factor, giving them
   less time to react.  So where does the extra .051 seconds come from? 
   There is yet another rinkle in relativity: events separated in space
   that are simultaneous in one frame are not simultaneous in another
   frame.  In the planets\' frame, the signal\'s reaching the ship and the
   object\'s being 15,000 km away are simultaneous events.  Not so in the
   ship\'s frame. There is a time offset in the Lorentz transformations
   that, in this case, favors the crew.

   So Einsteinian relativity says that three things: length, time, and
   simultaneity (all invariant under Galilean relativity) are different
   in different reference frames.

   Man, I love this stuff!

   None of this changes Garry\'s basic point though, that it is
   dangerous to drive faster than you can see. You\'ll need some pretty
   long-ranged sensors to travel at relativistic speeds through a
   cluttered space-lane.

  Can you really see the touchy-feely friendly governments of the happy
people planets having laws on the books for \'death by torture\'?  Is
sentencing a perp to death by torture more ethical than the previous
example of the Battle Dress equiped LEO quicking squeezing their head to a
pulp?  

  This is all interesting data for planets with law levels measured in
letters though...

How about the entire planet is covered with water, but most of it is
only a few feet to 10 feet deep. (1-3 meters deep).  The planet would
be a giant swamp, with trees growing out of the water.  The natives
would live in the trees, and travel either through the tree canopy, or
in small boats.  

The planet could have been settled during the ROM, during the Long
Night, the polar ice caps melted flooding the planet.  The population
was forced to move to higher ground ie the trees.  


Someone suggested a THWAP contest, for coming up with solutions to
weird UPPs, but the problem with that is I can only use one of the
solutions, the rest are wasted. With THUDD, I can use all of the
designs.  I probably won\'t, but I can.  We could do something like pull
out a dozen or 2 dozen weird worlds, and people each detail one of the
worlds, and we pick the one that is the neatest.  Sure that won\'t
really make a fair contest, as some worlds would be more interesting
than others, but do we want a contest, or lots of world details?

ALso we  wouldn\'t want to limit this to just Year 0, lots of us still
play in 1120 or 1200. Those eras still have weird worlds.

Spoken like a true Vilani! Hint: Technology cannot be quashed easily,
regardless of how many water powered engines with 100 mpg carburetors sit
moldering in GM\'s vaults. 

How about for special ops police or anti-terrorist forces getting into a
hostage situation \'unarmed\'? How about sneaking them into resistance
forces in an oppressive regime? How about using them to shoot high powered
NMR operators who DROP the tubes containing 3/4ths of the metabolite
you\'ve laboriously collected and purified over the last few months and you
cant use a regular gun because of the huge magnetic fields in the room?
(ok, ok, the last is VERY unlikely, but I really did want to shoot that
guy!) 

Most intel sevices would love to have a few of these around for those deep
covert ops. Of course, if you\'re of the mind that all intel services ARE
criminally inclined, well, maybe only crimninals would have a use for
them.

Cool.  

But you neglected to notice that this is a *water* world as well.  Do you
suppose the population is in underwater structures?  or perhaps floating
colonies of plant life? or large \'ships\' (holding *hundreds of millions*)
or perhaps all three?

So there are three for four subcultures, from different contexts, each
with its religo-techno upper class (mechanical or environmental engineers,
technicians, etc) and scads of workers using internal combustion engines
and wood-fiber type construction (and steel, aluminum, low tech solid
state electronics, et al).  

The "floating island" people are growers of fibrous construction material,
live in enviromentally filtered and controlled houses on their travelling
islands, migrating from \'pilllar\' to \'pillar\' (see below) in a random way,
from climate to climate.  A very hardy, adaptable people, who are (unlike
the bubble people below) very independent and self-sufficient (they will
need metals from the \'ship people\' below and the \'bubble people\' though).

The "Bubble People are the most technically apt and use that skill to
maintain an underwater existence in certain shallow areas of the ocean
floor.  This is the largest segment of the population.  The bubbles are
TL9 manufacture with TL5 modifications and additions (anyone see 20,000
leagues under the Sea?).  Typically the bubble cities are built near iron
ore or bauxite deposits, or perhaps Uranium ores to power their "Magic
Power Plants" that will be needed to make such a large population
comfortable (if you can call that Law Level comfortable).  These people
trade with the other groups for unusual foodstuffs, wood-fiber like
material, and perhaps occassional "vacations" (but try to get a travel
permit!).  Their cities are clusters of domes surrounding a Pillar of
\'advanced material of heavenly manufacture\' (read composites or special
alloys) which allow access to the surface (for the priveliged few anyway).

The "Ship People" ride huge factory ships to specific destinations around
the globe, generally following good climates and going from city pillar to
city pillar trading between them adn among the "floating Island people"
(gotta come up with local dialect words for these folks).  smaller vessels
leave the factory ships to fish for the great Tractapod, a large bony sea
creature whose every body part provides a useful purpose; from the scales
that make great bowls and utensils, furniture and jewelry, to their
massive fatty bodies which can be processed into a huge variety of pseudo
- -petrolium type products (including fuel for the small craft used to track
it down), to their huge, light bones which provide the structure for the
traditional boats used to catch the beast, and the ragtag collection of
towering homes that cover the decks of all the factory ships, one atop
the other, until they risk falling over into the poison sea far below.

Sons and Daughters of the ship people, seeking to escape the crowded life
they were born to, have sometimes built their own "factory ships" of a
much smaller scale and different materials, only to find life extremely
difficult to maintain the required fuel level (they are using internal
combustion, after all, not nuclear) and harvest enough food with the
smaller population and less facilities to work with.  Some however have
persevered and are surviving, while not flourishing.

Well, that\'s enough for a start.  Fill in details as they occur.

What I don\'t understand is how can an Asteroid Belt support 800 Billion people? Or for that matter how could a small world? Because 4 of these worlds are small and one is an Ast. Can this be right?

Yes, Theory does say somethiing like that, (at least some theories) but
its wrong.   Stars which have recently become stars have a very high
percentage of multiple systems, some papers suggesting as much as 100%.
 As stars age, they get stripped of their companions, the exact process
is still undetermined.  Looking at the total population of stars, the
percentage is about 40-50% of stars are multiple, the rest are single.

  Going back to the original topic, LEO\'s would perfer the weapon first 
put forth.  One that would only fire in the hands of the authorized user.
The \'safety\' device would be a ring or hand implant.  The second type
suggested, one that will not fire at those with a proper signalling device,
is too open to abuse by the professional criminal class.

  Quick law level related question, if gun related crimes in Australia are
nearly always related to organised crime, why is the government collecting
nearly all the firearms in civilian hands and turning them in to scrap iron?

  Getting back to safety devices.  Some of the good ideas I\'ve seen posted
before include,

1.  \'self-defense\' firearms that sprays the user\'s hand with a dye when
fired.  Take a step further and make the dye chemically tracable.

2.  firearms that have a small radio transmitter, which will put out a
warning signal, and a maintain a carrier wave, to police when fired.

3.  Firearms with built in Microcams that photograph whatever it\'s aimed at
when fired.  When the microcam is out of film, the weapon will not fire.
Film reloading available only at your friendly local police station.

Campaign note:  I had a player get miffed at me when I told him that, yes,
the planet\'s law level allowed the carrying of handguns, but the local
police  would not be allow him to carry his TL13, burst fire capable, gauss
pistol on a TL 7 planet.  Geez, I even provided a range of TL 7 handguns
available for purchase...

It really does not matter, save in an existential way.  I recommend
"Spacetime Physics" as the best introduction to special relativity out
there, if you want the details, but the broad answer is:

In an inertial reference frame (Anything moving unaccelerated in a straight
line), you will always measure light moving at c.  As a result of that one
fact, you will think that anyone moving with respect to you is having their
lengths in the direction of travel contracted, and their time slowed.  From
their perspective, they will think the same of you, and any technique you
use to synchronize clocks that produces consistent results will include a
way of taking this into account.

SR says nothing about what is really happening, only that any measurement
you make or perception you have will give results as if "the other guy" has
slower clocks.  It says the same to him.

Yes, and I loathe it!

I also expunged every TL16 and 17 world from the dGP data in my last game,
save for a few worlds that had just reached it or where it was a relic, as
I had information saying the Imperium had not achieved TL 16 at the end of
the FFW.

Sorry.  I do not like this particular data problem.

I am willing to have a relic world that is at TL>12, as long as the 3rdI
never made them a member, and the Vilani never really found out about them.

I am planning on putting a TL>>12 world out there that is the El Dorado of
the 3rdI, but there will be only one, and nobody is going to know where it is.

This has been a long running complaint.  I was even unhappy with Shudusham,
a TL12 world with 70 billion industrialized people.  They would NEVER be
subservient to Sylea, as they could dust the Syleans in any kind of conflict.

I solved this by ruling that Shudushamese had TL<9 starship tech, and could
never quite figure out jump drive.  They were major drivers for Empire, as
they wanted Sylean colony ships to bleed off their population.  I am just
going to de-tech all 91 of the worlds with >TL12, save for a few carefully
selected plot macguffins.

It better have a multiplier of 1.

This is one of my complaints, actually.  I viewed M0 as a new wave of
colonization into a mostly empty universe with lost of old, old, old ruins.
 The current data makes it seem like a low tech TNE.  TNE can be fun, but
reconstruction is not as interesting to me as expansion.

I like the idea of putting it in the comments, or putting it as a trade
code.  Please, for those of us writing data parsers, do not fiddle with the
UWP.

Speaking of which, I am now at Beta 0.9, which works on Mac and PC, and
generates Postscript (viewable with Ghostscript).  The people who responded
to me before with a machine type and a beta test request should see an
executable sometime in the next week, assuming I find no major problems,
and get a chance to write some preliminary docs.

Care, and agree.  If it is true that class B ports can build ships, then
there should be darn few As, some Bs, C\'s wherever there is active trade,
and lost of Ds and Es.  Essentailly, every pocket empire of > 10 worlds
will want an A, and might have started considering putting in a backup B
port somewhere, while few independent worlds will have considered an A.

This, of course, changes dramatically if class A ports are once again the
only places for shipbuilding.

STRONGLY agree.  Also, any world with tens of billions of people (pop A)
should be carefully looked at if the pop multiplier is other than 1.  I can
accept 30 billion on Sylea, and other important worlds, but I want every
world with more than 10 billion people to be planned, not accidental.  Much
like all TL 12 worlds should be at least looked over.

I am open to discussion, but I had the strong impression that the Empire
expanded very rapidly, which implied to me a lot of worlds ripe for the
taking.   

I think the effects on population in RoM would actually be more pronounced
than in TNE, just not as catastrophic.  If you knew that no more radio
parts were going to show up, you might be very tempted to "move back" to
the higher pop worlds.  I also expect a tremendous number of spacelifts
would have taken place near the end, as humanitarian types moved the
colonies that were going to fail off to other worlds.

While this happened at the end of the 3I, it was under war pressure.  I
expect that it went a bit better in peacetime.  (According to my data on
the Great Depression, once people are out of work, they become more mobile
in hopes of getting some work.  It does require cheap transport, but I
imagine that any world of less than 50K people could have been easily
depopulated by choice if a large megacorp wanted to.)

Relevant to Traveller?!? of course, but not exactly in a direct way.  Skip
if you\'re not interested in so-called Cold Fusion.  

Since I am employed by a "Hot" Fusion laboratory, I looked into the "Cold"
fusion research (of which the Palladium reactions are a
spinoff/subset/superset) with a fearful eye.  I am skeptical but open to
the possibility of a real discovery being made.

My skepticism will end when Boston Edison builds a 300MW power plant which
uses Palladium and Water as its consumables.

I asked one of the scientists here about the cold fusion reactions and one
of his comments was "if it were a nuclear reaction they\'d be dead"
referring to the theoretical need for Neutron Radiation emissions for a
Fusion reaction to occur.  

- --sidebar--
Of course his future, like mine, is somewhat
dependent on the Hot Fusion program continuing.  He is also, however a
scientist and a Tenured Faculy at MIT and he will 1). continue to receive
the same salary no matter what happens and 2). has, I believe a good
healthy amount of "scientific objectivity".  For myself, I am not worried
about being employed per se, there\'s plenty of grant management positions
around, but I\'d like to see the program continue anyway,and many of my
friends would be in tough positions.  
- --end sidebar--

If it is not a fusion reaction, then the most likely explanation is that
it is a chemical reaction.  Now, my basic physics class in high school
told me that you must store energy in order to release energy.  If what is
being done is basically a release of stored (chemically) energy then this
process is not much more exciting than when they found out one could burn
gasoline to make an engine run (which was pretty exciting in its day mind 
you). Eventually there will be a shortage or absence of one of the stored
energy chemicals that powers the reaction and we\'ll be back to looking
for a new power source.  Of course if that energy is stored in Water, we
have a lot of time to find an alternative.

Here\'s the problem I have if the reaction is simply the "cracking" of
water, though.  We know energy must be conserved.  If we know water can be
cracked into Hydrogen and Oxygen and that combining the two back together
requires no energy input (in fact it releases energy), then energy must be
input in order to crack them apart.   

Somewhere in there the Palladium and Nickel get involved; They are
supposed to be catalysts.  I do not know how much of these materials are
available or what needs to be done with or to them; I know that some
experiments involve Palladium in a latticework structure.  If these
materials are consumed in the process (or altered such that they are no
longer usable for the purpose) then it is these materials that are
liberating their energy chemically (which is OK, someday we\'ll figure out
how to get at the immense reserves of nickel at the earth\'s core).  If
not, then...it must be Magic!!!! That\'s it, they found the secret of the
Philosopher\'s stone!

The possibility must be faced that this is neither a nuclear nor a
chemical reaction.  In this case the basics of physics as we know them are
incomplete or false and all bets are off.

Well, theres plenty of Web sites on the subject, but having examined the
issue my advice is to sit back and watch for a couple more years.  If
there\'s something there it will be in production by then.  If not, then
the momentum of the movement will not last much more than that.

In the end though watch out for the hype - it occludes the real issues.

It can, but it usually wont be.  Consider, if you take an asteroid that
is just 10km by 10km by 10km.  With levels 5m. apart, you end up with
2000 levels, or 200,000 square km.  Earth is only 5.5e8 km^2, by my
memory, so you only need about 2500 of these to have a place sufficient
to house earth\'s population at present densities, and you can pack people
a lot more densely if you have the energy.


Further, these 2500 worldlets only use 2.5e6 km^3 of rock, while earth
consists of 1e12 km^3 of rock.  In other words, earth cut into 10km cubes
would hold about 400,000 times the stuff as earth, the big ball.  You
could put a trillion people into this form with a thousand times the
elbow room we have today.  If a world reached high tech without jump
drive, it might be a good way of holding the maximum population possible.
 At some point, of course, you need to consider whether it is space or
power that is the limiting factor.

Damn I like having this thing on line to search!

There are NO worlds in the data set that have a UWP pop of 0 that don\'t
also have a pop multiplier of 0 as well. So ALL pop 0 worlds are truly

Will the contest be to come up with multiple interpretations of the same
UPP data?  or each getting a set of UPP data and doing some expanded world
generation with it?  The THUDD is nice since I *can* use four or five
300-600 ton patrol cruisers, but I cannot use 5-6 planet descriptions with
identical UPPs, only one.

Well, the Grand Census/Grand Survey format, the World Builders Handbook
format, the basic UPP with description, Scouts (book 6(?)) has a format.

I vote for WBH myself.  the expanded tech levels and cultural details
(identical or similar to GS/GS anyway) are quire useful.  Question is can
we reproduce it somewhere for general reference?

We can also come up with our own similar format, perhaps a relatively
loose one.
The other possible aspect of this is to make everything compatible with
Merrick\'s Galactic program so they can be "dropped in" without a problem.

Yeah, and they\'d be 2-foot tall hairy guys with names like "Wicket"...

The trouble is, any planets that could be covered by a uniform
3 to 10 feet of water would be smoother than a billiard ball.
While it\'s tempting, I think we should leave the "desert planets",
"forest moons" and "ice worlds" to Star Wars players.

Now, you could do a planets where the major continent is really,
really swampy though... kinda like expanding Louisana up to around
Michigan-ways. :) The rockies and foothills would still be
pretty dry, but you\'d have more than enough swamp to start a 
civilization in, especially if you put some big nasty critters
on the dry land.

A more likely explanation for the world is that it\'s settled by 
colonists heavily modified by the RoM agency \'GenAssist\' - they\'re
Merpeople. They live primarily underwater, but can come out for
short periods of time. The Terran ecology imported to the planet
(salmon, cod, tuna) has almost totally displaced the local sea
fauna, making the tribal, nomadic existance of the underwater dwellers
fairly easy.

The type \'E\' starport is simply a ferrocrete pad and a landing beacon,
still functioning centuries after the few nearby building have been
destroyed by the occasional fierce storm. Presumably some nearby 
system that still has old RoM Naval records would have information
about this world.

Sure..I never said that the THWAP competition had to be a clone of the
THUDD (they\'re produced by an entirely different set of animators at the
Batman studios ;-)

What you\'re suggesting is eminently reasonable, and it\'s beginning to look
like people are actually interested in this enterprise, so I\'ll try and
figure out some rules...

Howsabout I extract a list of worlds with \'weird\' UWP\'s from the FS Data,
post it, and entrants can then choose one and write it up?

Next silly question, what do we mean by \'Weird\'?

Someone else may have pointed this out: it\'s not a waterworld, but an
exotic atmosphere.  I _do_ find the prospect of a TL0 impersonal
bureaucracy a bit odd, though.  This most probably is the homeworld of an
alien minor race, with weird biology/culture leading directly to such a
rigid culture (of hunter-gatherers wielding worldwide control over tens of
billions?  Somebody write these guys up!)

   I don\'t mean to dry up your parade (as cool as a swamp world is), but
   I read the hydrographic percentage from "E8A6A9C-0" as being 60%, not
   100%.

   What I don\'t understand is how you can roll up a TL of zero when a
   pop of A gives you +4 on the TL roll, and atmosphere A gives you
   another +1.  Since the lowest number you can roll on 1 die is "1",
   then the TL must be at least 6, and at most 11.  If that E starport
   is really an X, then the minimum is still 2.  Sounds like the
   generating program is buggy, or not following the rules.

Well, if we run out, then we have lots of cool worlds developed, and we

Before the data listings even begin, you\'ll obviously have a short
introductory section, explaining the format, how it\'s divided up, etc.
etc.  Include in there an explanation something like the following:

"Remember, as you detail worlds for your own campaign, that this area of
space has been settled and governed, through First and Second Imperia and
the Long Night, for at least 4,000 years now.  Almost no world has
remained untouched.  So if you find an Earth-like garden world with zero
population, consider: what happened to the inhabitants?  Was it a fast
demise (war, disease or natural disaster, societal collapse), or a slower
fading away (inbreeding, loss of technological knowledge and resources, or
the simple inability to exist without outside trade and support) that
caused a world\'s entire population to perish?  What relics or records
remain to show their history and fate?  The far-ranging scouts of the
Third Imperium do not often find pristine planets awaiting a first human
footprint -- far more often, they are confronted with the sad evidence of
the Long Night\'s cost in knowledge, culture, and lives."

Perhaps an additional paragraph (here, using my example from my previous
post), pointing out the phenomenon doesn\'t only apply to Earthlike empty
planets: 

"Earthlike worlds were not the only ones settled: the Ziru Sirka and Rule
of Man placed colonies on many a more hostile planet, and far more of
those have failed or regressed to bizarre cultural forms during the
interregnum than those on their more clement neighbors.  Sylean
ethnologists are still studying the so-called \'Lays of Lampigas\' (Antares
0103).  The Vilani miners in that asteroid belt survived nearly a
millenium of Long Night without outside trade or assistance, steadily
moving to simpler and simpler technology as their population and resources
dwindled, first abandoning artificial gravity, then surviving in thinner
and thinner atmospheres, and all the while composing the song-cycles now
being compared to the Terran Eddas, or the Vilani Song of Giishkimba.  By
- -25 they were surviving at a rough tech level of 5, when a random asteroid
collision broke the pressure seals on their last remaining colony cavern.
Lampigas died, scant decades before Sylean scouts would reach them."

Oops.  What a downer.  Maybe another "color" paragraph describing the
wonders that recontact has worked for another world closer to home.

Probably you\'d want another few sentances pointing out or confirming that
_current_ tech level doesn\'t mean what the inhabitants invented from the
Stone Age up, but that the vast majority of the worlds are regressed
colonies, getting by with what they could do on their own, at a far
reduced level of technological achievement than that of 1700 years ago. 
They\'re the lucky ones, who didn\'t suffer the multitude of fates on the
"000-0" worlds.

A thought for Scout lingo/slang, suitable perhaps for a sidebar:

"CIPHER (SIGH-fer): Scout slang for a world with zeroes in the last four
digits of its UWP (population, government, law and tech levels).  Note
that the term is not \'zero,\' or \'null,\' implying that these worlds are
inconsequential or worthless.  The older term for the zero digit carries
the implication of a code or mystery, for few of these worlds have been
empty forever.  A scout sociologist\'s work is devoted to discovering why
these often pleasant worlds failed as much as it is to recording how
others survived."

I suspect the objection is to the nature of the destruction of the 3I. FWIW
I personally would have prefered a gradual collapse as outlined in \'hard
times\', followed by a slow recovery (along with the execution of Lucan, a
strong telling off for Dulinor, and the restoration of Strephon).


That bit in parentheses wasn\'t exactly serious.

My fault, I was the one who swapped the ATM and HYD values when I looked
at it, being more concerned with the joke on the name, perhaps...

Your other point about World generation factors...don\'t the rules apply
only to the \'Steady State\' Imperium of 1100? (had I my bookshelf here I
could confirm that) Marc, IIRC, mentioned that he used some variant of the
Collapse rules from TNE to generate the FS data. In that case the world
generation rules are the wrong ones to apply here.

  There are quite a number of worlds with atmospheres ranging

Uh, you don\'t call NCOs "sir".  They _work_ for a living, and are proud of
the fact :-)


Which reminds me of the story my friend Bill tells, about a time when a
Canadian Major-General decided to inspect his unit (aircraft maintenance). 
One of the corporals was working on the undercarriage, with natural
consequences to his coveralls, when they were lined up for inspection.

The General was not impressed.  "You!  You\'re a disgrace!  Why are you so
filthy?"

The corporal replied "Sir!  I work for a living, Sir!"

No further questions were asked.  Of anyone.

the overall political/social structure implied by this data.

As an example, I got the \'true\' populations set up today (POP * Pop
multiplier) for a closer look at the various sectors and their poulations.

Vland NOT having tech levels _is_ putting a big hole in my analysis, but
here goes.

Total Populations by sector:

del	2.04E+12
mas	1.59E+12
lis	1.43E+12
dag	1.43E+12
ile	1.22E+12
cdr	1.11E+12
cor	1.10E+12
ant	9.40E+11
gus	9.10E+11
for	7.16E+11
zar	5.71E+11
vla	5.10E+11

TOTAL	1.36E+13

Delphi has the largest population; Core is pretty solidly in the middle;
Vland (!!) is the lowest, but his is probably entirely due to Vland having
an \'official\' population of 20,000, rather than the 10\'s of Billions
expected.

But, when you look at populations by tech level, a different story
appears. Delphi, corridor and massilia have huge populations, but at TL-8
and 9. Core has two \'spikes\' at TL-8 and TL-C, but Dagudashaag and Lishun
have the bulk of their population at TL B and C. In fact, Dagudashaag has
53% of the sectors population living at TL-C and another 11% living at
TL-D. 

What did the nacent Third Imperium offer these hight tech level societies
that made them want to join? Why didn\'t the 3I run into LARGER political
entities in these places.

I suspect that a great deal of the answers to this lies in the \'hidden\' TL
figures of Vland; since Vland was the next sector after Core to join the
3I. I\'ll try to get the table into the next post. I\'ll also attempt to get
this stuff into my web page this weekend, but I\'ll make no promises..I\'m
pretty booked up.

I believe that the Vilani were limited to worlds that could be reached by
Jump-2; anything that could not be reach by J2 from some side was bypassed. 

ROM, I if I remember correctly, had J3, so anything with a j4 or larger gap
was also off limits.

I think one of the side bars in M:0 addresses this, but I can\'t locate it
right now.

Perfect. Could quantify it further: A(n) for abandoned vs R(n) for Ruined as
in war or extensive natural catastrophe. Ruined worlds may have left over
live munitions or other dangers to consider, and still not be classified as
Amber or Red Travel Zones; TAS isn\'t Omnipresent is it?

Not as sorry as I am. A rather key element of the history in my game
universe depends on NOT being able to have an effective sensor system at
relativistic speeds. If there is a real world way to make this work, I need
to come up with a different basis for a particular group.

For the most part I agree, but only up to a point. On worlds where a
population couldn\'t survive without high tech base and that technology
was imported the people would have either all died or left. Worlds with
very small populations would, after 1500 years, be completely empty or
populated by some *very* inbred people. ;->

Anyway, IMO, worlds with 0-3 or A+ atmospheres, 0-1 hydrographics, and
pre-night populations of 0-2 should either be barren now or have
individual stories as to why they aren\'t.

Somebody has probably already addressed this, but it brings up an
interesting question.  Is the population always a *human* population...I
wouldn\'t think so.  

So, explain Kiisamguushiirg as a water world with a huge population of
Shlongs, intellegent dolphin-like creatures.  The Shlong live a carefree
existance beneath the waves with little need and no desire for
technology.  

Now, my second question is about the UWP, doesn\'t it go:
Port,Size,Atmos,Hydro,Pop,Gov,Law-Tech?
  E   8    A      6    A   9   C -  0

If so, we\'re not talking about a water world at all! We\'re talking about
one with an insidious (or is it corrosive) atmosphere with large oceans
of something and a *very* restrictive law level.

No offense, Peter, but my skepticism of "hot" fusion will end when
*anybody* builds a 300MW power plant using *any* hot fusion technology.

I don\'t see how any of the "cold fusion" reactions can be any nuclear
reaction that we are familar with.  If there *really* is an energy
release going on then it\'s probably something new..what that something
new is, is a good subject for speculation. 

For some interesting reading get on the web and search out the works of
Drs H.E. Puthoff, D. Cole, A. Rueda, & B. Haisch.

up the minimums in characteristics to qualify for this \'career\'. Anybody
with strength, endurance, dexterity or intelligence below 5 (or 6 or 7)
don\'t bother to apply. Reduces the pool of potential Dorsai in the game,
doesn\'t change the upper limits on characteristics. There never were many
Dorsai, but Dorsai there were, they were good.

Skill set mixes. With the Martial culture the Dorsai come from, if you
qualify as a Dorsai (see above), you start out with a level 1 in several
military related skills, even before enlistment. Pistol-1, Rifle-1,
Brawling-1, Intimidation-1, Intrusion-1. Or treat initial enlistment age as
12 or 8 instead of 18, and give them 3 terms with automatic re enlistment.

Least ways, that is what I would do to create a Dorsai or a Fremen.

Also (being even more heretical here) the Long Night lasted 1776 *years*!
During this time the Darrians went from TL 3 (with TL 12 Solomani input)
to TL 16.  Why can\'t some other pocket empire have hit TL 13+.  Some may
have collapsed, some may still be at TL 13 or even 14. 

I\'ve never understood why everyone seems to think that the Long Night
means that technological progress has stopped.  It was a severe economic
collapse, and lots of marginal worlds died out, but 1776 years is a long
time for easily habitable, high tech, worlds like Terra to just sit around
and stagnate.  Clearly, none of this technology became widespread, but
that doesn\'t mean it doesn\'t exist.

Actually, it has been estimated that the solar system could support
about 1 trillion (1 million million) people - all at above North
American upper-middle class living standards - with only 3-5 billion
living on the surface of the planet Earth. The asteroids make perfect
combination home/resource/export bases, planetoids, moons, and small
planets are gathering places and communications centers, and a great
number of people live in small habitats in solar orbits. Once you _got_
into space a society like this could probably be maintained by TL8-9,
perhaps as low as TL5 (perhaps).

The Vilani probably did it that way, which was another reason why
their interstellar society collapsed when the more administrativly

7 million people live in New York City, a major industrial/tech. center

2 million Afghanis live along the Afghan/Iran border. They have tech. at

	Just ran the first session of my latest campaign, titled Traveller:
Beyond The Pale.  As I did for our last campaign, I\'ll be posting game
summaries as they occur.  We\'re using KB v.2.0.  Much of the intrigue is
inspired by some research on legal ethics I\'m currently doing.

The Cast:

Amr Santayema: a young, brash, and altogether too clever merchant, played
by the TML\'s own Ross Coburn.

Lt Kehaaarl: Aslan ex-marine, played by a non-TML\'er.  Big, strong, loyal,
honourable, and dumb as plywood, employed as a body guard to...

...Sir Loreni Vilash: Vilani merchant from a poor family whose trading
acumen led him to a knighthood and the captaincy of a brand new free
trader.  Played by nobody you know.

Dame Sharee Paptaa: a prominent chanteuse, whose name may change if I
decide not to be too pissed off at her player having missed the game due to
serious illness.  See below for more examples of what happens with names
when people miss sessions...

Perlis Dalal: a muscular female ex-scout played by the TML\'s Glenn Grant.
Glenn has done a killer character background using a system of his own
devising, which I\'ll let him share with you.


The Story:

	The game opened with Sir Loreni at the con of his free trader, the
Rampant Phallus of Capitalist Free Enterprise (Renzo missed last game, and
I am a vengeful GM, hence the name >:)), coming in for a landing on
Mishegaan III (D33446C-7), a miserable dirtball orbiting a type K0 V star
two parsecs out in the great Rift coreward of Vland.  Mishegaan III is
notable only as an LSP mining colony, and as the only star system within 3
parsecs of the Shugilli cluster, a cluster of nearly 20 main-sequence stars
and many habitable planets, sitting out in the Rift.  The cluster was
originally named the Shugilli Gupaa cluster, because it formed an asterism
resembling a common cooking utensil when seen from Vland.

	At game date, IY-75, the Shugilli cluster has been Red-Zoned since
the IISS first re-explored the area 25 years previously.  Some months
previously, a rumour began circulating that due to maneuverings by the
Conservative faction in the Moot, the interdict would be lifted and
unrestricted access to the Cluster would be allowed.  Hence Sir Loreni\'s
presence in the system with a hold full of Fusion+ units.

	Mishegaan III\'s Downport proved to be a rather dull expanse of
bedrock, bordered by a fuel dump, warehouses, and terminal buildings,
situated near the wall of a 16-km crater, into which the sole settlement on
the planet was built; mostly dormitories with windows looking out over the
crater.  Arriving at approximately 02:30 AM, Sir Loreni and his crew went
through the usual arrival formalities, and went in search of amusement,
having been cooped up on board for  two weeks en route to Mishegaan.

	The town being rather akin to a boarding school dorm populated by
Rye-Ben blue-collar workers run by heavily armed monks with no respect for
one\'s civil rights, said amusement proved to be the spaceport bar, a rather
dismal establishment on the terminal concourse.  When Sir Loreni and
Kehaaarl walked in, the only patrons in the bar were Perlis, sitting in the
corner, and some offshift spaceport ground crew.  Sir Loreni and Kehaaarl
proceeded to order drinks.

	Meanwhile, up on the concourse, Amr Santayema looked out over the
tarmac, with bitterness in his heart.  Having been forced out of the family
firm by the concerted action of three cousins, he watched as the family
ship boosted for orbit, leaving him behind.  With sorrows in hand, he
headed for the spaceport bar to drown them.  Meanwhile, Sir Loreni had
invited Perlis over for a drink.  They began discussing the commercial
possibilities of the cluster opening up.  Perlis, while ostensibly off
active service, had really been assigned to cover the wholesale commercial
invasion of the cluster first hand, and to document it so as to prove that
it was a terribly bad idea and prevent this form of recontact from ever
occuring again.  She was assigned a Type S Scout and authourized to sell it
if needs be, in order to finance participation in one of the numerous
hastily concieved commercial ventures to the Cluster.  She raised the
possibility of doing so.

	Overhearing their conversation, Amr wandered over and offered his
services.  Quick access to the spaceport datanet revealed that there was a
recently repossessed Locust-clast Frontier Trader (designed by Ross, which
he\'s going to post to the TML shortly if he knows what\'s good for him)
available for sale on the tarmac.  Amr proposed a deal wherein the three
would form a venture whereby the other two would sell their ships to
purchase the Locust, the three would incorporate, and he would provide his
services as 1st officer for 10% of the shares in the corporation.

	Sir Loreni pulled a spectacular failure on an intelligence and law
roll, and thereby didn\'t see that this would be the equivalent of giving
Amr 7 megacredits for the benefit of his services.  Perlis failed her roll,
and likewise thought it was a fair deal.

	While they were discussing the deal, two rather scruffy-looking
Vilani walked in.  After a few minutes, Kehaaarl noted that they were
eavesdropping; not having a good command of either Galanglic or Vilani, he
resorted to the unsubtle but very direct means of raising his hackles and
growling in their direction; they got the message.

	Shortly thereafter, Amr finished drawing up the contract.  All
three parties having signed and agreed to meet at the shipyard at 10:00 the
next morning, he departed to find a registry office where he could safely
file it.  Consulting the spaceport directory, he discovered that the only
lawyer on the planet, indeed on the system, was one Liontzel Huutzaa, the
CLO for LSP\'s operation.  Calling him at the local equivalent of about 4:00
AM, he offered him 10,000 credits for filing the contract safely (this is
not exactly how things work IRL, but I figured that hey, Imperial law would
be different...).  Huutzaa blearily agreed, charging Amr the agreed fee
plus 40 cr for copies.

	All proceeded off to bed, their commercial disaster having been
completed.

	The next morning, at approximately 0:800, Sir Loreni woke up with a
splitting hangover and the realization that he had been had soooo badly it
physically hurt.  Grimly shaving, he recieved a comm call from one Onyas
Sedducha, the manager and agent of Dame Paptaa, who informed him that she
was looking for partners in a joint venture, to purchase a ship capable of
J-3.  Sir Loreni informed him that sadly, he was already a party to such a
deal; Sedducha replied that there might be a way out of it.  Patching
Huutzaa in, Sedducha explained that if he contacted the shipyard owner
immediately, putting a down payment on the Locust, Amr would be largely out
of luck.  Huutzaa explained that at the moment, LSP was sitting on two
recently repossessed J-3 exploratory traders (an FSY Recollet and an older
FSY Lalemant converted for cargo hauling), whose hapless owners had landed
to refuel only to have their ships seized under the Megacorporate Joint
Repossession Agreement of IY-50.  Stating that J-3 ships were probably
going to become an extremely hot commodity over the next few weeks, Huutzaa
proposed that he, Dame Paptaa, Sir Loreni, and Perlis pool their resources
(in Dame Paptaa\'s case, her yacht), put down payments on all three ships
(taking advantage of Huutzaa\'s ability to give them very favourable terms)
and resell them a few weeks later at a handsome profit.

	Sir Loreni agreed; after being presented with a fait accompli, Amr
bowed to the inevitable, accepting 3.5 Mcr from a rather displeased Sir
Loreni as a settlement for avoiding the first contract.  He reinvested it
in the newly formed Quintana Speculative Ventures LIC.  After sales of
ships and various other transactions (Perlis having got a rather good price
for her Type S), shareholdings were settled as follows:

Perlis: 53%, Dame Paptaa 20%, Sir Loreni 18.6%, Amr 5%, Kehaaarl 0.02
percent (he invested his life savings), Huutzaa 0.02 (as a finder\'s fee),
and the remainder unissued.

[note to the non-lawyers here; if you ever run into a lawyer pulling a deal
such as this, turn him in to his Bar Association; this is so unethical I\'m
getting queasy thinking about it and am only using it as a plot device]

	That being accomplished, personal effects and cargoes were
transferred off various vessels, and people settled in.  The mood at the
spaceport was tense; there were nearly two dozen ships in port, with more
arriving every day.  Lodgings were scare, prices were high, and the mood
tense... until, without warning, a Far Trader sitting on the tarmac blew
up.  Much confusion and chaos ensued, with Sir Loreni, Amr, and Perlis
immediately heading for their ships in order to guard them.  En route, Sir
Loreni recieved a comm call from his engineer, who informed him that
approximately 15 ships had jumped into the system so far that morning.  He
then recieved another call, this time from the head of spaceport security,
who regretfully informed him that during the confusion following the blast,
his cargo of Fusion+ units, stored in a warehouse, had disappeared.  Sir
Loreni was informed that the spaceport director would be calling a meeting
of all captains, and imposing a ban on all further departures pending
resolution of the blast and theft.

	While Sir Loreni headed for the captain\'s conference, Kehaaarl
headed to the warehouse from which his employer\'s cargo had been stolen,
where he found a detachment of spaceport security investigating the crime.
Possessing little Galanglic, he had some difficulty explaingin his purpose
to the spaceport cops.


	We called it at this point; I\'ll post more following next game.

Ouch. For not trying, you do a good job of sounding jingoistic.

I think Anders\' point is well taken. There\'s no reason to believe that 
the contemporary dominant (domineering?) culture on Earth should be the

I was referring to systems -- "with worlds" -- not lone stars or binaries 
& trinaries without worlds. I understand that due to tidal forces or 
something, planetesimals cannot form in stable orbits around multiple 
star systems, so the commonality of *worlds* with multiple stars in the 
system should be far less than the solitary case, like the solar system.

I\'m more than willing to be corrected...

When he said "crew have .05 of a second to react and dodge the object" I 
assumed that Garry was working out the time from the frame of the ship, 
not the planeetary. Therefore I assumed he made an error when he stated 
that the signal was 30,000 kps faster than the ship.

Sure, his answer was right for the planetary frame, but that wasn\'t what 
I thought he was referring to.

I recently saw a neat diagram explaining non-simultaneity in Einsteinian 
relativity on a web page, I\'ll share it with the group.

A train is moving at .95c ... Observer A is on the middle of the train, 
observer B by the tracks. Their watches and measuring sticks are 
synchronized at the moment they pass each other. Lightning strikes both 
ends of the train.

             \\_           A           _/

================================================
                          B

The light waves propogate. Observer B receives both signals at the same 
time, so he says the lighting strikes were simultaneous. Observer A gets 
the waves at the head of the train first, so he says the lightning 
strikes were not simultaneous.

They\'re both right.

In my Classic/Mega Traveller campaign I puzzled why every
planet had at least a bit of level bedrock marked and why
you had so many adventures where clearly you were suppose
to land your scoutship and then use auxilarly ships to
move about (even if they were slow).

I came to the conclusion that it must be that you _can_
land your ship, but it is too risky to do when alterantives
exist.  The only reasons I could come up with are...
- -I you try and land on vegitation (etc.) your thrusters kick
up debris and dust obscuring your vision/sesnors.
- -Ships are heavy and if you don\'t know the terrain very
well there is some chance that the ground under one of
your supports will give way just as you are landing
(sink into the soil and get stuck, etc.) and give
complications in a situation where you have very little
time to react.

Planets can theoreticly form around stars in binary, trinary or more
systems, they just have to be close enough to one of the stars. This 
star has to dominate the gravitasjonal forces. A maybe farfetched 
example is our own solar system, where Jupiter is the second *very* small
star. The Sun still dominates the gravitational pull on the planets.

You are suffering from the common delusion that there must be a
"correct" reference frame. That is, that *one* frame of reference is
better than the others. 

But the whole *point* is that all inertial (ie non-accelerated) frames
are equal. So the photon that sees the universe as a 2d plane that
exists for zero time is just as good (or valid) a view as yours. 

"The objective universe" is not a valid concept. "An objective frame of
reference" *is* a valid concept, but you have to remember that there
are other EQUALLY VALID frames.

On Asteriods you use the *volume*, not the surface area. Consider an
asteroid that\'s a 10x10x10 km cube. The surface area is 600 km^2. But if
you divide it into "levels" about 20 meters apart (ie 20 m from floor
of one level to floor of the next), you get 500 layers at 100 km^2
each. That\'s 50 thousand km^2! And it\'s just one medium to small sized
asteroid. 

For a small world, where you need to dig in since there likely isn\'t an
atmosphere, you get a similar effect, as you can likely dig as much as
100 km deep. That gives you 5000 layers, each with close to the area of
the whole planet! (for a 500 km radius planet dug into up to 100 km, I
get a volume of 3e15 m^3 or about 1e5 km^2 of floor space. 

That works out to a 125x125 meter square for every member of that 800
billion population. Figure in the 20 meters of headroom and that\'s not
a bad spread.

Two problems. At the required energy levels, just abut *any* frequency
will induce *massive* ionization in the air. That severely limits your
range. Second, the very plasma sheath that makes the capsule visible
*protects* it. It\'s opaque, so most of your beam energy goes to heating
the plasma, not the capsule!

Also, due to atmospheric effects, you *can\'t* fire at the capsules at
"shallow" angles through the atmosphere. That means that you need to
use lasers that aren\'t more than a few hundred km from the drop zone.

The reason those drives are low accel are because they are *inherently*
low mass flow devices. They both rely on charging something and then
using electric or magnetic fields to accelerate it. The thrust is
limited by the field strengths. To get a decent mass flow, you need a
*short* acceleration path, but that limits your field strength severely.

BTW, do realize that while higher accelerations get you to a given
velocity quicker, they also give you less to to *benefit* from your speed.

Consider how long it takes to cover 1 AU (assuming you don\'t need to
stop).

accel	time
- ----	----
 .01g	20 days
 .1 g	6 days
 1  g	2 days
10  g	15 hours

As you can see, you hit the law of diminishing returns pretty fast.

Close, but in the system I reccomend it is the hourly wage for an unskilled
laborer _after_ accounting for dependents and taxes. In cultures with
predominantly single-income families and/or high tax rates, the minimum
wage could be a number of credits. A credit is what\'s left over after the
earner has paid his taxes and alimony ;-).

That\'s not going overboard at all. According to Robert van Gulik the Chinese 
of the Yang Dynasty did have very few sentenses lower than death, and they
did have a whole lot of different degrees of death sentenses.

The trouble is that most criminals don\'t expect to get caught. You can deter
some people by extra harsh sentenses, of course (reputedly English burglars
were most reluctant to carry guns on the job as the judges always increased
sentenses dramatically if a burglar was caught with a gun on him), but the
people who actually consider the risk of getting caught are deterred by much 
lesser sentenses. Once a criminal convinces himself that he is not going to 
get caught, the penalties only matters when he realizes that he was wrong.
And at that time it\'s usually a bit late. If you make the prospect of being
caught more horrible than the prospect of getting killed, you are asking for
last stands, dead hostages, and dead law enforcement officers.

Let me repeat the suggestion I came up with after discussing that very
problem a few weeks ago: Refine (read: change) the definitions a little
bit:

The TL of a planet indicates the highest TL used by most of its inhabitants.
Since TLs can differ for different areas this may mean only that the planet
is very advanced in one limited area: medicine, robotics, environmental
control, etc.

The TL of an interstellar civilization indicates its highest space
technology level. Thus the RoM may have had Tl 14 weapons and vac suits,
but they did not have more tha Jump-3 ships. And Sylea may be TL 12 going
on 13 already in Year 0, but the 3rd Imperium will not reach TL 13 in
space technology until 300.

_Nevertheless_ I also reccomend that _every_ world with a TL of more than 12
should be examined for consistency and be included in a sort of gazeteer.
These planets would be of extreme interest to the Imperium and would
recieve close scrutiny.

Don\'t forget that Vilani is a _tonal_ language & these two names may not
sound anyting alike in Vilani

Yes but the real question we need to answer is not "Is it plausible that
some places will have the same name ?" but "How many duplicate names
would be inconvienient to have & should therefore be avoided for ease of
play ?"  I am perfectly willing to accept the duplicate names which
already existed in Traveller canon but I am not sure it is a good idea
to add so many more (even when we know that they are not the same name
in Vilani - we are _not_ speaking Vilani).

Another question no one has raised is how many of these worlds should
have Vilani names to begin with.

When the Solomani conquered the Vilani the Vilani had already occupied
and named most of the planets in their empire however the Solomani then
renamed many of these planets.  In Milieu 1100 many sectors had a lot of
planets with earth names and I think that Milieu 0 should too.  It is a
lot more likely that these planets were renamed at conquest, during the
Rule of Man, or during the Long Night than that these planets kept
Vilani names for 2,000 years after they stopped being exclusively Vilani
& were renamed only during the Third Imperium.  It is true that the
Vilani may have reclaimed the old Vilani names for their planets after
the Second Imperiums fall but you could also argue that the conservative
Vilani would be more likely to keep the planets name what it had been
for the past few centuries rather than change it (even back to a name
that it had for milennia before).

When I attempted to generate names for planets in the Verge sector (for
a TNE pocket empire I was working on 18 months ago) I looked carefully
at the map of the first Imperium and considered its influence & culture
in the region.  Then I gave each planet within the First Empire a 4 in 6
chance of having a Vilani name and a 2 in 6 chance of having a non
Vilani name (of which 5 in 6 were Terran and 1 in 6 were made up). 
Planets outside the first Empire used the same system with different
probabilities.  I also checked each planet for the possible presence of
a native minor race (human or nonhuman) and if this race was present
gave the planet a 3 in 6 chance of being named in their language.

P. S. If anyone wants a 60% finished and 30% named 1201 and 1117 dual
data listing for the Verge sector sorted by subsector and adapted from
the DGP data using the collapse a sector rules and/or a 1201 pocket
empire in Verge email me & I\'ll be glad to send you the data.

	Ok, that makes more sense. 

	BTW, does anyone have rules or guidelines on purchasing lower-tech
items on higher tech worlds? From what I saw (beats me where) on
excghange rates and such, it would be quite advantageous to use lower
tech stuff when possible, as there is quite a saving in constant
currency (CrI) terms. A good example of this would be jump drives: J1
over TL9, and J2 over TL11. There seems to be no real advantage in
buying these drives at a higher TL.

What do you mean exists for zero time? At these velocity vectors the
universe\'s entire lifetime exists in a moment of the photons time frame.

Also, because the photon has no rest mass AND can\'t go slower than C in the
medium it is traversing as a consequence AND because of its probability
cloud AND the fact the Hamiltonian doesn\'t collapse until an interaction, the
photon doesn\'t see the universe at all. From its perspective it IS the
universe.

Photons are not the only particle (bosons or leptons, I know of no hadrons
this is true for) that exhibit this behaviour. Electrons can also exhibit
some strange behaviour as a result of their ability to change orbitals
instantly and the fact that, again, the Hamiltonian doesn\'t collapse until
an interaction.

Or, there are no absolutely valid reference frames, or put another way, all
frames of reference are objective; they are a function of the observer not
the observed - Heisenberg\'s Uncertainty Principle.

The universe is observer dependant.

WE NEED THE NAMES OF STARS, THEIR LOCATIONS, SPECTRAL TYPES,
OTHER USEFUL DATA ABOUT THEM, AND ANY INFO ON PLANETS KNOWN TO
EXIST. Please either forward this information to me via email, or

provide would certainly speed up the game\'s development.

In addition, I need any ASTRONOMICAL LITERATURE you can find on

The problem being, how to get your partially finished ship to that Type A
starport...

I\'ve always seen many of the B class Starports as being the near equal of
the As, lacking only the ability to manufacture j-drives.  In many cases,
this might be due to a lack of the neccessary elelments, or a reluctance of
a major ship builder to commit to a shipyard in system.

Whenever I am detailing a large Pop world with a B port, one of the major
questions is always: why aren\'t they an A?  Some of the answers are
interesting.

I still prefer the "highest sustanable TL" model.. Anyone could import
massive amounts of aid and high tech goodies, but without the
infrastructure to support it, it\'s a false TL.

A simpler solution is to knock the vast majority of TL C+ worlds down to 11
or less.  Do keep a few high TL worlds.. they make for good story telling.
I could, for example, picture a world at TL D, but having no access to
critical starship building materials (lanthanum and zucchi crystals), so
that they are trapped in one system.

For interstellar groupings, I will grant you this.. but it has to be the TL
that can be supported by the industrial and educational segments of the
population.  The late 3rd Imperium had several worlds at TL16, but it
couldn\'t be said that the Imperium as a whole was able to exploit that
technology.

In California we\'ve had the so-called "three stikes" law in place for just
over a year now.  This law is simple; if you have two prior felony
convictions, and are convicted of any criminal offence, you go to jail for
25-life.  Once the idiots realized that there wouldn\'t be any more free
rides, early paroles, and plea bargaining, the crime rate dropped like a
rock doing .3c.

I\'m good friends with several San Francisco Police officers, and have gone
along on a couple of ride-alongs.  The thing that many people tend to
forget is that most crooks are exceedingly dim.  One night, my friend spots
an old Caddy with a burnt-out tail light.  This is a fix-it ticket, just a
friendly warning to repair the problem.  When we pull the car over, the
driver gets evasive, changes his story, keeps looking at the trunk, tries
to bribe Jim.. in short, does everything in the world to make us suspicious
as hell.  Jim calls for a dog, dog immediately points on the trunk
(probable cause) and a search revels 10kg of cocaine.  Since I was a
witness, I got to testify, and watched a three time loser get life.  If he
had just nodded his head and said "yes sir, no sir, I\'ll get that fixed,
sir" he would have gotten away.

the morale of the story is, never expect the criminal element to behave
with anything resembling intellegence.. if the were smart, they wouldn\'t be
criminals...

From a historical perspective, the basic post colonial New World cultures
are primarily derived from Spanish/Portugese (Mexico & south), English &
French (US & Canada). There were lots of other cultures (German, Dutch,
Austrian, Italian, etc) in Europe at the time the New World was discovered,
but it was the dominant (domineering) cultures that colored the New World
societies, with the other cultures, at best, creating small pockets within
the New World. 

Since history tends to repeat itself, unless some other countries start
chucking their own people up there, on their own, Yanks in space may be the
picture of the future, for good, bad or indifferent.

	Unfortunately, our contract is not with Marc Miller, it\'s with Imperium
Games. If Imperium Games gives permission for public release, that\'s one
thing. Now, IG produces Traveller under license from MM, so he\'s probably
got a major amount of say in what they do. But that doesn\'t flow down to
our contract.

not careful.

	There\'s one and only one real-world reason for the Traveller background to
have such a US-centric background ... Marc Miller, Loren Wiseman, Frank
Chadwick, etc., as well as the largest single number of Traveller players
and writers ... are North American residents. Not that this means we have
to continue perpetuating this, mind you, again simply a statement of fact.

I appreciate your post Andrew, it was really well written. However, I do
not agree with it. This "little" change completely alters the entire theme
of the M Zero campaign. In particular, with piles of advanced relic
technology waiting for the taking, scientific research and economic
expansion are just not viable. Treasure-hunting would be more
cost-effective. Also, so long as the previous Imperia never reached TL 13
it is reasonable to assume there are still \'virgin\' worlds in M Zero;
planets further than jump-3 from any refuelling source which have never
been visited since the time of the Ancients. I want these to exist in my
campaign, but they just aren\'t plausible if the RoM had even "experimental"
TL 15 ships.

I am not saying such a campaign would be bad, it\'s just that we already
have such a campaign universe in TNE. I wanted M Zero to be different.

A family generation chart was included in the "Oriental Adventures"
supplement for AD&D.  It was basically for use by Samurai characters.  It
allowed for family lineage to be determined for three generations (i.e.,
number of siblings, sex, birth-order and marital status for the PC and
siblings, father\'s siblings and for grandfather\'s (head of clan) siblings).


It also contained an "ancestral history" chart based on an equivalent to
SOC.  The higher a chracter\'s SOC, the more chances for an intersting
ancestry.  One\'s family could have ownership of a small farm, small
coporation or a small town, have had a famous general or artisan in its
ranks, be related to the imperial bloodline through distant marriage, or
have betrayed the current rulers in the past, etc....

I believe that a similar system should be developed for the Aslan, given
the similar importance family plays in their society.  I further think it
would aid Aslan roleplaying.

I am using the "Oriental Adventures" table as a springboard for designing
an Aslan Pride (and its relationship to other clans) in detail...hopefully
in a Hypercard stack.

I\'ll be happy to post the data when completed but really wanted to bring
the idea to the attention of the authors of the new Aslan/Vargr module (Jo
Grant, I think?) as something worth of development.  Of course, any
suggestions, comments and advice are welcome.

  expressing it the same way as an active society TL.

  Someone else on the list suggested an indication such as

  We note the existance of Ancient sites with a note in the

  high-tech ruins.  Let\'s extend the principle:  An Ancient site
  is "An"; change it to "An" followed by a TL digit: "AnL" is an
  Ancient site with an estimated TL of 21.  Continuing in that
  vein, we have "RMD" as Rule of Man ruins at TL 13, and "ZS9"
  as Ziru Sirka (Vilani Empire) ruins at TL 9.  Similar usages
  can be devised for any other pre-Third Imperium starfaring
  culture; in the early Spinward Marches, one might encounter
  "DaG", pre-Maghiz Darrian ruins at TL 16, or "ZhB", the
  remnants of an early Zhodani colonization attempt that failed,
  but was TL 11.

Specifications

   The vessel to be produced is an exploratory trader. The design is
   being commissioned by the Imperial government (through the Ministry of
   Commerce); their intent is that vessels of this class will be
   purchased and operated by megacorporations and possibly smaller
   speculative enterprises. Subsidies are under consideration.
   
   The following requirements must be met:
     * Size: 3000 dt or less
     * Jump: J2 or more
     * Acceleration: 1G or more
       
   The vessel must be capable of:
     * Wilderness refueling (directly or via carried craft)
     * Operation for 1+ year away from starport facilities (repair,
       resupply, recreation, etc.)
     * Landing/retrieving crew and cargo on planetary surfaces (directly
       or via carried craft)
     * Defense against similarly sized TL 11- spacecraft
       
   Defense against relic TL 12+ weaponry should also be considered.
   
   Provision must be made for security of landing parties and the care of
   wounded crew members.
   
   The purpose of this vessel is exploratory trade, well beyond the
   Imperial frontier. As such, normal economic analysis based on
   intra-Imperial trade profitability does not apply well to this vessel.
   However, as with any trader, a higher percentage of hull volume
   devoted to cargo implies higher profits -- if the requirements above
   are also met. The same comments apply to the vessel\'s price.

   Inspired by Sir Arameth Gridlore\'s own legendary travels beyond Sylean
   space, and drawing heavily on his experiences, Gridlore Technologies
   and Trans-C Naval Architects are proud to introduce the -Terrapin-
   Class Exploratory Trader.
   
   The -Terrapin- is an 80m cylinder, flared slightly at the aft for
   better control when wilderness refueling. The ship devotes over a
   third of its gross displacement to cargo storage, enough to prove
   profitable on any run. But there is more to the -Terrapin- than
   carrying freight!
   
   The -Terrapin- is equipped with powerful Quinn-Arturo "Phase III" jump
   drives, allowing jump 3. Standard thrusters grant constant
   acceleration of 1g, and can be overdriven for brief periods if
   necessary. Power is provided by a custom-designed X-tek Fusion plant,
   and is fueled for one year\'s operation at full load.
   
   The electronics suite has been designed with the idea that most places
   the -Terrapin- travels will not have local travel control. Active EMS
   sensors are accurate out to 10 LS, passive sensors to 5. This allows
   early detection of any threat, to allow the maximum decision time for
   the Captain. Communications are routed through either a .3 Mw maser
   array, or broadcast by the 1 Mw radio system. Defensive EMS systems
   include a standard EMS jammer (120k km radius) and a strong area
   jammer (90k km radius.)
   
   If the worst comes, this turtle has teeth! Mounting twelve Isher
   Artifact L-1013 95 Mj laser turrets, organized into four batteries by
   Navy standard FDC-11A2 master fire direction centers, the ship can
   bring effective fire on its enemies. (Note: no allowance has been made
   for direct turret control. All weapons are operated from the MFC.)
   While these powerful beams slice at your foe, you can feel secure,
   guarded by thick armor, 6 sand casters, a *15 Mw* nuclear damper, and
   a 2 Mw meson screen. It isn\'t a warship, but the -Terrapin- can
   certainly hold her own in a fight.
   
   Interface operations will normally be carried out be the -Terrapin
   Transit- shuttle, included in the purchase price.

Crew: 1 Maneuver, 1 Electronics
Accom: Seats Adequate x 55

   The ship has a crew of 49, including a full squad of security
   personnel and berths for a five person research/science section. The
   science section is intended to include such personnel as linguistic
   sophontologists, historians, and others to assist in making contact
   with worlds that may not have seen a Starship since Twilight.
   -Terrapins- have ten small staterooms for passengers. When no
   passengers are boarded, the spare rooms are designed to be used for
   extra berthing space to relieve stress, or as crew recreation
   facilities. Also standard are thirty low passage berths. Workshops are
   provided, capable of fabricating any but the largest, most complex
   parts. Technical specifications are provided in both computer and hard
   format to aid repairs, and most systems having self-diagnostic/repair
   aid programs. A general purpose laboratory can be found on "C" deck.
   This small facility is not designed for in-depth research, but will
   suffice for most inquiries. The ship\'s sick bay can accommodate up to
   16 patients in a pinch, though 10 is standard.
   
   A word about cost. Many designers prefer to work with modular
   components, accepting "close enough" as a substitute for workmanship,
   and then claim that the savings in cost justifies the act. Don\'t be
   fooled. When you are 50pc from the nearest help, close enough isn\'t
   good enough. Trans-C goes to the trouble of designing to the most
   exacting tolerances because we feel your life is worth it. Don\'t you
   agree?
   
    Design Notes:
    
   I have tried to balance merchant and exploratory missions with the
   Terrapin, and feel that it works well in both roles. The fairly large
   cargo capacity, along with the passenger complement, means that the
   ship is profitable; while the strong sensors and on-board labs make
   the ship a reasonable scout cruiser.
   
   This design used the excellent spreadsheet "ss-v2.xls" I can\'t
   remember where I found it, but my hat is off to the author, this is
   very easy to use.
   
   This is a ship for adventures. This is the reason behind the large
   cast of scientists and soldiers. You can boldly go where no one has
   gone before (or, at least for 2000 years...) and play a variety of
   adventures; not just merchant, but military, diplomatic, deep space
   fighting..
   
   Hope you enjoy! as always, comments and questions welcome.

Thus far, the four THUDDD contests have been number-crunching battles, in
essence; a quest to optimize a set of shipboard components against a set
of somewhat nebulous requirements.  This is a Good Thing in and of itself,
as it

(a) Improves the state of the art in Traveller shipbuilding,
(b) Creates many new ships for use in campaigns, and
(c) Helps expose design-system problems for (we hope) clarification or
    correction.

However, this leaves the THUDDD an exclusively gearhead domain.  While
this is fine as a general rule, I\'ve had the nagging sense that it leaves
something out.

These doubts were crystallized by the THWAP proposal.  A ship design is
just a pile of numbers; to be used in roleplay, the GM and players need to
know a lot more.  Some of this is simple stuff like pictures of the ship,
and deckplans, and so forth; on a deeper level, though, one wants to
convey the *feel* of the ship, what it\'s like to travel aboard her, what
gives her "personality."  Are the corridors squeaky-clean, wide, and
brightly lit, or dim tunnels of exposed wiring conduits with grating
floors?  What\'s the messroom like?  The bridge?

The textual portions of past THUDDD entries have touched on questions like
these, but only lightly.  My proposal is that, for June only, this become
the emphasis.  My original thought was that graphical plans and so forth
could be included, but I worry that would again exclude non-gearheads.  So
what I\'m proposing is this:

The ship to be produced will be a yacht, purely a pleasure craft for the
absurdly wealthy, with minimal performance, and little or no weaponry.
This is a ship used to flit about civilized space, visiting the yacht
clubs orbiting the snottier worlds of the Imperium. :)  For the use of
those without ship-design inclinations, I myself will provide the stats
for a \'vanilla\' yacht which will be acceptable for entry.

The key element in judging entries for this one special THUDDD would be
the descriptive text about the vessel, not to exceed 2000 words total.
Narrative walkthroughs of the vessel, describing the spaces you\'d
encounter inside, would be the suggested format.  Tell us about the
gleaming skilak-wood bannisters on the spiral staircase leading up to the
observation bubble.  Show us the captain\'s suite with its zero-gee canopy
bed.  Lead us onto the Art Deco bridge.  Give us a ship that\'s *real* to
the players!

So...what do people think?

And, just to avoid panic...July will be back to number-crunching and
laser-counting, I promise. :)

Just received an email from NasaNews concerning a new type of 
ceramic thermal insulation that allows a reentry vehicle to have
sharp leading edges.  This allows the reentry vehicle to have 
better hypersonic handling and has the added incentive of 
reducing the signature since it isn\'t ablative.

The sharp leading edge also reduces the plasma shockwave to 
a point where the radio frequency noise may not be impenetrable.

THERMAL MATERIAL PERFORMS WELL DURING FIRST FLIGHT TEST

     A new thermal protection material designed to prevent 
spacecraft from burning up during reentry into Earth\'s 
atmosphere performed extremely well during its first flight 
test.  The ultra-high temperature ceramic material may someday 
revolutionize the approach that engineers take to the design 
and protection of aerospace vehicles.

     A large amount of data on the thermal performance of the 
new material was collected on May 21 when a Mk 12A reentry 
vehicle blasted off from Vandenberg Air Force Base, near 
Lompoc, CA, at 4:27 a.m. EDT aboard a U.S. Air Force Minuteman 
III missile.  The reentry vehicle, equipped with a 0.141-inch 
radius nose tip made from the new ceramic material, took an 
approximately 30-minute, 4,200-mile ride.  Once out in space, 
the reentry vehicle was released, returning through Earth\'s 
atmosphere at blistering speed to a watery impact in the 
Kwajalein missile range of the Pacific Ocean.  The sharp nose 
tip was instrumented with five heat sensing devices designed to 
provide information on how well the new ceramic material stood 
up to the burning temperatures of reentry.  NASA engineers 
report that data was collected right up to the moment of 
splashdown.

     "This was just the first data-gathering flight test for 
this new material," said Joan Salute, project manager for the 
mission located at NASA\'s Ames Research Center, Mountain View, 
CA.  "However, initial results suggest that it was a complete 
success.  After extensive data analysis, we should have good 
information on the potential of this ultra-high temperature 
ceramic material to support a radical new concept in aerospace 
vehicle design -- the use of hypersonic sharp leading edges."

     This first test flight -- authorized only last December -- 
was accomplished in less than six months at a cost to NASA of 
$1.1 million.  Plans for additional flights currently are under 
discussion.  The potential benefits to be derived from the use 
of sharp leading-edge designs for spacecraft and 
transatmospheric vehicles are tremendous.  Sharp-body designs 
offer reduced drag, thereby providing substantial savings in 
the cost per pound expended to put objects into orbit.  In 
addition, they provide a greatly enhanced lift-to-drag ratio, 
enabling what is called cross-range capability.  This means 
that spacecraft and transatmospheric vehicles can reenter 
Earth\'s atmosphere from any orbit and land at any location, 
unlike present blunt body vehicles.  Finally, sharp leading 
edges minimize the number of free electrons that interfere with 
radio frequency transmissions and cause the communications 
blackout associated with the reentry of blunt body vehicles.

     The history of leading edge design is instructive.  In the 
1940s, aircraft routinely featured wings with sharp leading 
edges since that configuration was found to reduce drag at 
supersonic velocities (above the speed of sound, Mach 1, 
approximately 740 mph at sea level).  However, with the coming 
of hypersonic flight (Mach 5 and faster) in the 1950s, the 
buildup of heat on the sharp leading edges of vehicle wings was 
so severe that available materials tended to burn up and their 
leading edges became blunted.  Engineers took their cue from 
this natural blunting process in addressing the problem.

     "All along, Mother Nature was trying to tell us how to 
deal with this situation," said Paul Kolodziej, lead engineer 
for the project at Ames.  "Engineers realized that if they 
blunted the leading edge themselves in the design process, this 
would move the shock wave created during hypersonic flight 
forward and out, away from the vehicle, creating an air pocket 
in front of it."  This air absorbs much of the heat associated 
with reentry, preventing the leading edge from becoming so hot 
and melting.  "Because these new ceramic materials operate at 
ultra-high temperatures, we can now build sharp leading edges 
that don\'t melt during reentry along trajectories such as those 
flown by the Space Shuttle," Kolodziej said.

     Blunt body design remains the norm today.  In fact, it was 
the blunt body concept, originally developed at Ames by the 
late H. Julian Allen, that enabled development of space 
vehicles capable of withstanding the rigors of reentry.  The 
problem is that blunt body vehicles have high drag and are not 
efficient. They therefore require large and expensive 
propulsion systems that impose a severe penalty in terms of 
cost, capability and performance.  Developing an approach that 
permits the safe use of sharp leading-edge configurations for 
vehicles flying at hypersonic speeds holds the promise of 
yielding huge benefits.  The key to achieving that payoff is 
the development of highly efficient thermal protection 
materials like those currently being evaluated by NASA engineers.

     The ultra-high temperature ceramic material that just 
completed its first flight test has already proven out in 
ground-based testing in the arcjet facilities at Ames.  In 
fact, the materials were shown to be very stable at 
temperatures in the range of 1,700 - 2,800 degrees Celsius 
(3,092-5,072 degrees Fahrenheit) in the presence of high-
velocity dissociated air, such as is encountered during 
conditions of reentry.  They also have been shown to be 
resistant to thermal shock and fatigue failure and, hence, 
reliable for repetitive operation and use over multi-mission 
lifecycles.

     The development and testing of the new material is part of 
a joint program among NASA, Sandia National Laboratories and 
the US Air Force called Slender Hypervelocity Aerothermodynamic 
Research Probes, or SHARP.  Additional information about the 
SHARP program can be obtained at the project\'s Ames web site on 
the Internet at URL: 			

      http://kauai.arc.nasa.gov/projects/sharp/sharp.html

     NASA\'s participation in the SHARP program is funded by the 
Headquarters Office of Aeronautics and Space Transportation 
Technology.  The objective of the effort is to demonstrate the 
viability of sharp leading edges for space vehicles and 
possible future transatmospheric passenger aircraft that may 
have the capability to fly out of Earth\'s atmosphere and into 
the fringes of space and back.  The SHARP program is a key 
element supporting NASA\'s overall mission to expand the 
nation\'s frontiers and capabilities in the aeronautics and 
space domain.

Well this not a problem/issue, I do not believe that MM wanted a "public"
release just a bigger "playtest" group over a longer time period. 

By the way the weekend playtesters did sign a NDA(Non Disclosure
Agreement)? Well I am willing to do the same as they did, I can sign it
with my PGP key. I am sure that others would sign a NDA too. 

By the way, how many of weekend playtesters were there? Also would they
identify themselves, one already has due to oversight.<G>"Humor!" I am not

From your statement it would appear that MM does not "call the Ball" on
release of products as IG has most prominently stated here and elsewhere.
Hmmmm. Time will tell I guess.

Easy. You get a bigger starship and carry it as cargo, at the ruling freight
rate. Given non-military spaceships tend to cost about MCr0.2 per displacement
ton, this is easily profitable, assuming a cheaper cost to build on lo-tech
worlds in Imperial Credits. Now, the beta T4 TTA starship construction rules
that Guy "Wildstar" Garnett has written strongly imply you can retrofit a
Lanthanum jump grid onto a non-starship. How difficult is this ? I dont know.
You could justify it as anything from a Easy to an Impossible task ...
Naval Architect would be the appropriate skill I think, and use of major 
computing power would probably be a prerequisite.

Elements can be imported, assuming an interstellar economy.

The point about "we could, we just didnt see the need" is valid. Of course,
if the starship production facility down the way got raided/nuked/whatever,
you might embark on a crash program to build a starship production facility.

I think Type B starports should be able *limited* production of starships,
up to about 1000 displacement tons.

Of course, allowing this really screws the idea of the Long Night *sigh*
, as TL9 worlds with B starports could have kept things going to some
degree - 100t scouts and 200t Free Traders are enough to do a lot with.
I have problems with the Long NIght anyway ... I mean the model seems to
have been the fall of the Roman Empire (centralized society overthrown
by more productive but administrativly challenged barbarians), but in
that case it should have collapsed faster (if it lasted 400 years, why
did it fall ?) or been under for less time (ROM achived TL12 ... TL9
is enough for interstellar society, as that is when you have contra-gravity
and the jump drive).

Honestly, I think the Long Night shouldnt have been as long, or as dark -
more a case of a huge number of squabbling kingdoms, but that none
the less retains a technology level enough to build starships and anti-
gravity.

Yup. Agreed.

Now, the general issue of imported technology.

Striker got it right, I think. Imported technology has twice the maintainence
demand, and needs 20% of import price per year for spare parts. Therefore,
over (say) ten years you are going to pay a *lot* of hard currency for
that imported equipment.

On the other hand, if it lets you do things you otherwise cant, then it 
could be worthwhile. For military equipment, a small amount of high-tech
can go a long way - a handful of TL8 Stinger missiles forced the TL7
Soviet Air Force away from a close ground support in the Afghan War. 

Purchasing lower technology can make sense as well. World A has a hi-tech
manufacturing base. World B has a lower technology industrial base. 
World B will therefore have to sell stuff to world A at a discount, in 
order to have world A\'s currency with which to buy neat stuff. World A
can therefore have more OK-if-not-neat stuff than it could have built
using it\'s own resources.

Striker puts currency values at 0.1(TL-7), plus 0.2 if Starport A, 0.15
if starport B, 0.1 is Starport C and plus 0.05 if Starport D (although
this breaks down at TL7 and lower).

Note that the Millieau Zero Sylean Credit has a value of 0.7 under this,
so multiply everything by 1.43 to make the Sylean Credit it\'s theoretical
value of one.

One thing this does (when you consider starships are built in local credits,
but earn income in Imperial credits) is that the cost of shipping in
Imperial Credits goes down over time, because TL9 still does the job with
starships (maybe with retrofitted TL12 maneuver drives - some worlds are
*so* unreasonable when it comes to using spewing out radioactive waste as
reaction mass).

As to the issue of building lower-tech stuff at higher tech levels, I\'d say
that it can be done, and results in equipment with higher reliability
and thus lower maintainence costs. But it\'s probably easier just to import
it from somewhere else, and sell them hi-tech goods in exchange.

I hate to stir a pot...but I\'m amused by the thought of IG customer 
service calling customers (randomly)?

I\'ve had a continuing problem with IG and their shipment of orders. Under 
the "old management" I was charged way in advance for items not ready to 
be shipped. It took the "new management" three months (and many faxes, 
e-mail messages and telephone calls) to reverse this.

Then the "new management" announced the internet order plan. "We have 
changed" they stated. "We will ship your items within three days of 
receipt from the printer" they sang. I was lured in again.

I got the ref\'s screen, no problem. I must admit that Pocket Empires 
arrived as advertised.

However, it took me two months of phone calls and e-mail messages to get 
them to send me Emperor\'s Arsenal (which I had pre-ordered when the 
Internet savings plan was announced). And the pattern of messages was not 
all encouraging. I would call, leave my work and home numbers, indicate 
what times I was at each place. I would always get a call at home, when I 
was not there! E-mail would be answered slowly, if at all, and usually 
would require a follow up in order to get a clear reply.

On Journal 26, I saw messages on TML indicating the folks had seen it. I 
had not received my subscription copy. I contacted IG, sent a copy of my 
order confirmation showing that I was a subscriber. About a week later I 
got a e-mail indicating that they had systems problems. I sent another 
e-mail, asking if I would get my copy. About a week later I got an e-mail 
indicating that new copies would be sent out "soon". Here it is, about 
another week later, and still not JTAS#26.

I have read with amusement the latest missive from IG on the web page. 
The deluxe rulebook is delayed--fine, if it means they do a good job, all 
the better. A massive spurt of mailings on May 31 to catch up...well, I 
remain skeptical. I just **know** that my shipment of these items (again, 
I pre-ordered them all when the plan first went into effect) will get 
screwed up somehow!

I am not a newcomer to the world of gaming. I have bought and played and 
run RPG\'s and other games since 1977. I\'ve dealt with many small 
companies, but this one is taking the cake on a record of screwed-up 
orders and customer relations! The design work--especially that by people 
who also participate on this list--has been good to excellent. If only 
the rest of that company was also showing a comparable improvement!

I\'m keeping the faith. I bought several copies of the rulebook. I have 
bought all the products published so far. Heck, I even boght the BITS 
published items (and excellent they are!). I subscribe to the Sword of 
the Knight Publications \'zine. I\'ve got a copy of the Deluxe book 
pre-ordered and I\'ll even buy the "new" aliens book and FS/MO book--just 
to keep supporting a company that does not seem to give a damn if I exist 
or not!

I am a patient man. I do not like to complain, especially about something 
that is not that important in the larger scheme of my life. However, I 
should also not have to chase down my orders time after time while at the 
same time getting letters in the mail telling me how much **better** this 
company has become. It would be nicer if reality caught up with the 
advertising copy!

I disagree. The important thing to remember is the time differential. TNE is
set less than 100 years after a catastrophic collapse, M:0 is set 1700 years
after
a gradual collapse; a vital difference. After 1700 just how many RoM relics
are there going to be left? not a heck of a lot. Of those the vast majority are
going to be just fragments or parts; of the whole ones, the vast majority are
going to broken and beyond repair or analysis; of the remainder, most will still
be beyond repair but you could use them as a design base. The number of
functioning or repairable RoM artifacts would be almost infinitesimal, the
average
PC should be lucky to run across more than a couple in their entire lives. They
should be treated in the same manner as ancient artifacts, a once in a lifetime
discovery (insert Andrew\'s impassioned plee that RoM does not suffer from
the same overuse that the Ancients have). In TNE the technology did not just
collapse, it actively turned against its users, people would have just stopped
using the devices out of fear; with the RoM, the remaining technological
devices would have continued to be used until they broke and became
unrepairable; and 1700 years is more than enough time for all but a very small
handful to have reached that state. So of the relics that might be found,
some can
be useful for research, pointing the way; but they are only an adjunct to
it. They
can not in themsevles be very useful; and most importantly, the higher the tech,
the less useful they are (the "how the hell did they do that" syndrome). You
need
a basic understanding of the technology that created a device to be able to
analyse it. In TNE, the basic understanding of high tech is still there; in
M:0, it
isn\'t.

I think its important to look at what I think happened after the fall of the
Ziru
Sirka. I don\'t think most Vilani worlds would have significantly advanced during
the RoM; most would still be at TL 11 max, the RoM just did not have enough time
to overcome 5000 years of technological stagnation. This is important, since M:0
is set firmly in the middle of the former Ziru Sirka, so the vast majority
of relics
are actually going to be TL 11, with a sprinkling of TL 12. However if one looks
at what might have happened in the former Terran Confederation, a different
possiblity emerges. Here, I just can\'t see technological advancement stopping;
slowing down yes, there just wouldn\'t be the resources available that were
there during the Interstellar Wars (the threat is lesser [but not gone] and so
many resources have to be diverted into trying to stem the inevitable collapse),
but it would likely still continue. So I can see the RoM pushing to the
limits of
TL 12 and even starting into TL 13 _in some fields_ and _in some locations_.
These two factors are important; it does not mean that the RoM reached TL 13
across the board and it would restrict the advanced tech to specific areas
(namely,
the former Terran Confederation). I see no problem with the RoM having
developed TL 13 prototype gauss rifles, after all they are just prototypes,
something that could be done at the upper end of the TL 12 range. I\'d even
go as far to say that they could have entered production. An important clue here
is that Cleon forbade (note not discouraged but forbade) expansion to rimward
beyond Massila, exactly where I would postulate the higher tech RoM worlds
would have been; and a major focus of the Imperium\'s early research _is_ to
recover former RoM technology (not artifacts, but the technology that created
them). Also please note, I am not postulating experimental RoM TL 15, I am
postualting experimental TL 13 with some TL 14 and 15 _theoretical_ studies.
Working out what might be possible at TL 14 or 15 is very different from being
able to actually do it.

As to the virgin worlds, it has nothing to do with jump technology. I can
build a
jump 6 capable ship at TL 9 if I want, it just takes 6 weeks to get there;
virgin
worlds will exist because the RoM did not have the resources and the Ziru
Sirka not the will to exploit them (both facts undoubtedly true) Even with
jump 4
capability an isolated world does not become a significantly more attractive
proposition for development; it\'s still just about as hard to get to, just
you can get
there a week sooner (not a major factor in colonisation or exploitation). If you
want worlds which have not been visited since the Ancients, just put them there,
it\'s irrelevant if the RoM (or anybody) had better than jump 3, even with jump 1
you can still visit them.


So lets look at the big picture of what I see M:0 being \'like\'. Firstly,
there will be
a lot of pocket empires. Very few would be hold overs from the RoM, but Cleon
did not start the recovery, he just exploited it. By the time the Imperium
started
expanding, the recovery was well underway, a lot of worlds had already
regained the stars. Also remember that the Scouts and traders preceed the
Imperium in a wave front some 50 to 100 years ahead of it, actively encouraging
a return to the stars. So, there\'s a lot of pocket empires, I\'d expect that.
But they
are not scrabbling about in ruins looking for artifacts, because: one, the
artifacts
aren\'t there; two, the cost of recovering the tech base is prohibitive; and
three, its
only TL 11 in the area concerned.

Secondly, the Imperium is not expanding into a primitive wilderness, its
expanding
into a fairly vibrant interstellar culture, even if its creating that
culture itself. A lot of
worlds will have recovered to between TL 4 and 8, probably the majority, with a
good number higher (TL 9 to 11). But very few will have got much beyond that,
TL 12 is possible, but anything over that will need a good explanation (yes,
I agree
in FS there are way too many high tech worlds). I\'d put maybe four or five high
tech (12+) worlds per sector; and I\'d put good limitations on them (stagnant
culture,
uplifted by the Imperium etc.).

Yes. Much better than the parenthesizing. However, remember this will add a
lot of work to those people working on the FS data. And you could get some
interesting clashes between ZSn and RMn codes :-)

I recently pasted together sector maps of the Spinward Marches, Deneb,
Riftspan, and Corridor. I then highlighted the various worlds based on how
far away their neighbours were. The interesting result was that there were
very few worlds (say less than twenty five negecting those in the Great
Rift) in all four sectors that a Jump 2 drive would not reach. I would
expect the Imperial Core to have even less.

IMO J3 and J4 convey more of a military or commercial advantage in speed
and bypassing choke points.

Now, the new, virgin worlds *are* out there, but only when the 3I gets past
Deneb and into the Marches. And a lot of those would have been touched by
the Vargr, especially in Deneb and Corridor. And the expansion into that
reason is explosive.

I\'ve always tended to agree with this, but I went along with it for the
feel. Unfortunatly in the New Order a lot of this feel has gone, and there
seems to be a plethora of TL9+ worlds, all at the same time.

If that\'s the case, then how in all creation did the TL12 Sylean Federation
get to be the centre and prime mover in the new empire? One High population
TL14 system in the central region of the Empire(s) would put an end to
Sylea\'s Imperial ambitions real quick.

But how do you then explain all those low-population worlds with Industrial+
technology? It takes a lot of people to run an industrial society. I suppose
that at higher TLs you may be able to have a handful of people direct a lot
of robotic manufacturing equipment, but that\'s not the impression I get of
the way things are done in the Imperium. And in any case, a medium-tech 
society simply cannot be run without a lot of people. With my definition
the explanation is simple: They make enough interstellar credit to buy what
they need from elsewhere. A typical example would be a mining colony that
didn\'t produce _anything_ except processed ore of some kind. By your
definition they\'d be TL 0 (or perhaps TL 1). But what\'s interesting to
players and referees (and to scouts and tourists, for that matter) is the
level of technology they are likely to meet when they go to the planet in
question, not how the people there got the stuff.

The Imperium as a whole had an _average_ TL of 12 in 1100, a century after
they were said to have reached TL 15. Obviously the average TL is a better
measure of what the Imperium as a whole is able to exploit. So the overall
TL is not the same as the average. Also, one single high-population world
with an above-the-norm TL can produce enough ships to supply a significant 
part of the Imperial navy. (Not a huge part, but even 1 ship in a 1000 would 
be of significance, if it was of a higher jump than the rest (Of course, 
thanks to the strange fact that controlled jump-6+ is unavailable until TL
21 or thereabouts, there is not much difference between TL 15 and TL 16 
space technology, so that particular point is moot in the case of your 
example. But imagine the impact a single high-population TL 15 world would 
do to the speed of information flow in the Year 0. Such a world could supply 
at least 100,000 jump-6 couriers.

If the price in Planet A credits on Planet B plus the cost of transport is 
less than the price of manufacturing it locally on planet A, then Planet A 
will buy the stuff on Planet B _provided_ it has anything to pay with. The 
last bit is often the crucial problem.

I usually don\'t do \'Me too\' posts, but that\'s a very good idea and on I can\'t
think of any way to improve. No, wait: Remember that a couple of millenia is
a long time and that you can easily have more than one group of settlers on
a world (For example, in my work to detail the Spinward Marches for Milieu 0
I noticed two different references to Algine: One said that there were 
humans on Algine in -1511, another that Algine was colonized by Solomani
around -1000. The explanation is, of course, that Algine must have been 
settled twice, the first time a Ziru Sirka colony planeted around the same 
time as the one on Vanejen). So a planet could easily have more than one
set of relics (Come to that, Darrian must have both AnL and DaG notations).

a captured pirate with First Aid-2 skill to tend to the 6 wounded, then as

It\'s not particularly well-understood. Orbits are dynamically stable if
(near a close binary) they\'re 10 times further from both stars than the stars are from each other,
or (in a wide binary) they\'re 10 times closer to their primary than the secodnary
star is. (People used to think it was 4x, but that\'s changing.) Whether 
stars can *form* in such a system is unclear...A really wide binary
probably wouldn\'t mess up the formation process...but it\'s not clear what a very
close binary would do. To be hoenst, (a) we don\'t even understand *how*
binary stars form, and (b) we don\'t undertsnd how planets form - as a case
in point, if 5 years ago a Traveller product had a gas giant ina 0.05AU orbit
I would have laughed at it...but then people found 51Peg.

Well, since just about everybody was knocked cold, it doesn\'t seem too bad
to me, just remember to inforce the "aches and pains" until their wounds
heal..

A couple of questions:

Did anybody try for extra damage hits?

How did you handle autofire from the SMG?

How much time passed between a character being wounded and his being given
first aid?

This sounds ver interesting.. I can see a number of us gearheads teaming up

As long as you have the materials and the know-how, the TL is sustainable.
Aworld with only 3000 people on it could run a fairly effective TL 6
society, it just wouldn\'t be very large.  Remember that up until the 1850s,
just about everything was hand-crafted, the concept of indentical
components was unheard of!

 And in any case, a medium-tech 
>society simply cannot be run without a lot of people.

Why is this?  Because we are bureaucratic?  How about an absolute monarchy,
where the King says "I need a rail line out to End\'s Point.. do it!" and
the ironworkers and railmen execute the King\'s wishes, or get executed!

 With my definition

But when the interstellar trade gets cut off?  That mining colony is going
to be in decent shape, since it will (presumably) have the materials (raw
ore and machine tools) and know-how to build what it needs.  Anything that
requires components that are not availible locally (TL 13 holo-memory
chips) will fall into disuse as equipment fails.  Overall, the tech level
is going to sink to a level that the natives can support.

Take modern day San Francisco as an example..  I live within walking
distance of two stores that sell and repair computers, and there are
numerous mechanics, engineers, electricians, etc.. living here.  If
necessary, we could maintain TL 8 without outside aid.  If you were to go
to Papua New Guinea, and your laptop dies, good luck.  Your bringing TL 8
items into the P-NG jungle does not raise the local TL, due to the lack of
infrastructure to support it.

Now, the constant introduction of hi-tech does encourage a slow rise in the
local TL, as more natives become familiar with the new tech, and learn to
manipulate/repair it.

 But what\'s interesting to
>players and referees (and to scouts and tourists, for that matter) is the

But sometimes the "how" can be the story.. Where did these TL 0 nobodies
learn to use a gauss rifle?  Also, please don\'t assume that all
players/refs share your views.. my players love to burrow into the "why\'s"
and "how\'s" of the universe.

Agreed, I should have made it more clear that I meant average TL in that point.

David,

My reply was not meant to berate you about releasing the docs location(s),
just a comment that it will not be that large of issue/problem for MM to
get the playtest expanded. That is if MM does "Call The Ball" on IG\'s
product releases. If he does or can work out the issues with IG then IG
will give y\'all the permission to release the docs, and too how many for
how long. But IG stated in message that MM would have the ability to "Call
The Ball" on future products and their release to prevent further FUBAR\'s
like Starships, First Survey et al. It just seem to me that IG says one
thing but there actions contradict their earlier statements

Now that you mentioned it how big was the playtest group that you had
permission for. No names please!!!<GG>"Humor!"

This is something we really shoul dwork on with ISBA. Including
corporations that *design* the ship in its real sence. Taking care of 
the external and intirior look after the gearheads have decided what to
include, its basic shape and so on. The ISBA would than be a true
roleplaying list were construction companies negotiated with other fields
for decorating jobs and so forth.

I agree somewhat. There will always be someone left out. I think that the
ultimate THUDDD format would be were people from the TML teamed up on 
the design. Three to four people working together to bring the ship all
the dimensions it need. First the descuss the design, then each of the 
team is given a field to work on the ship. One does design. Another
the deckplans and a picture of the vessel. The third the narrative
discription. This would mean that everybody could partisipate without
loosing the diversity in the gearhead department. I would like to 
emphesize that this is just thoughts thrown out of the top of my head.

I do have one trouble with this and that is us non-native english speaking 
partisipants of the TML. To write a narrative description of a vessel is 
a real challenge in the creative use of a language. It is very easy to get
a very one-dimensional ship when you do not master a language. To give you
one example there is a few words or parts of the sentences above I do not 
full grasp (although I have spendt one year in New York and speak english 
rather weel). I not sure what a bannister is, or a canopy bed for that
matter. To partisipate in this I would need time, so this has to be ruled
on fast.

Just saw teh movie "Action Jackson" on TV yesterday. This discription
reminds me of the pursesnatcher in the beggining of the movie. Like the

Well, there is certainly nothing stopping anyone from forming such a
consortium under the current THUDDD rules.  I think it\'s a great idea,

Yes, I realize that this THUDDD will be harder on our less English-fluent
list members, just as previous ones have been hard on non-gearheads.  I
hope to move the disadvantage around over time, but it\'s impossible to
create a totally level playing field, I fear; nor is it necessarily
desirable.

The problem being, how to get your partially finished ship to that Type A
starport...

I\'ve always seen many of the B class Starports as being the near equal of
the As, lacking only the ability to manufacture j-drives.  In many cases,
this might be due to a lack of the neccessary elelments, or a reluctance of
a major ship builder to commit to a shipyard in system.

Whenever I am detailing a large Pop world with a B port, one of the major
questions is always: why aren\'t they an A?  Some of the answers are
interesting.
- - --
- ----
- ----

I have found a two different references to the (shipbuilding) difference
between an A & B starport.  

The first was that a B could not build a ship of the line.
The Second was that a B could only build QSDS type designs.  

	I have slightly misinterpreted the second to mean they are limited to
approximately 
5000 dt designs & are not easily capable of building customized starships.
We are just getting into this as our Traveller characters are in the
process of recovering/colonizing a barren world.  It is a very large (9)
world with 2G.  The starport is mostly in the Highport which is shut down
but functional.  First hey have to eliminate the pesky creatures from the
port...

"Relic IISS Ships and the New Era/Reformation Coalition" (or some such
title).  For that article, I made a write-up of an Xboat using _Fire,_
_Fusion,_&_Steel_.  For whatever reason, I neglected to post that
write-up with the article.  So, I\'m posting it now.  

According to CT Supplement 7, the Xboat has a massive array of databanks.
I read that as meaning "a *lot* of extra computers."  Unfortunately, in
any edition of Traveller, starship computers are too expensive to have a
large number of them installed in a starship.  (By "large," I mean "three 
or more times the usual number"; i.e., 10+ computers instead of just 3.)
To get around this, I made an assumption: I assumed the Model Flight
computers had approximately one-hundredth the storage capacity of Model
Standard computers.  (Mod Flt have 1/10 the volume, mass, and power usage,
and 1/1,000 the cost.)  

If my assumption was correct, I could have the storage capacity of five 
additional Mod Std computers for the price of 1/2 an additional Mod Std 
computer (but at the volume of 500 such computers).  

Since the Xboat has *always* been a maneuver-less ship with minimal cargo,
I felt justified in spending the ship\'s volume in this manner.  

I made a further assumption: A computer could be a Model Flight computer
*with* the Fiber-Optic backup otion (i.e., using *both* the "Mod Flt"
modifiers *and* the "Mod FB" modifiers).  

I\'d appreciate your feedback.

Here a thought....

Allow "A" ports to build brand new j-drives.  Then your "B" ports, while
not being able to produce a drive from raw elements, has the equipment
and capable personnel to perform high quality remanufacure of a j-drive.
A drive thus produced would not be entirely new, but would also be a bit
cheaper.  Use the analogy of "A" ports selling "dealer engines", "B"
ports selling high quality "rebuilt engines"....while at a "C"
port,...hope that BillyBob can find the parts you need in his junk "out
back" and hope that he didn\'t get his A&P certification out of a cereal
box.

What kind of armor did the PC\'s have?  

If none, it seems that the T4 rules should be bloody enough.  A SMG 
does 2 D damage.  If you have an average character (stats 7-7-7), you 
can take him out real quick with autofire.

Let\'s say you roll average damage on this average character.  That 
would be two 3\'s (one on each die), and this is doubled to 6\'s.   So, 
now you\'ve got two 6\'s of damage to take off the character\'s stats.

If this is the first hit, you use the critical hit rule and roll this 
damage randomly on the character\'s stats.

We roll, and the first one goes on the character\'s Str, reducing it 
to 1 point.  The second random damage roll is crucial.  If you roll 
Str again, the character is unconscious and one of his other two 
stats is seriously reduced.  If you roll another location, the 
character is wounded, barely able to keep conscious (two stats 
reduced to 1), and loosing a lot of blood.  If damage was just one 
point more (rolling a 4 on one of the die--doubled to 8), this would 
guarantee unconsciouness.

You can see how this combat could get very lethal if you use more 
powerful weapons that do more damage than just two dice.

I\'ve got two suggestions for you if you want to spruce up combat.  
One is Glenn Grant\'s hit location system.  Glenn did a great job on 
this.  Not only do you find a location, but there are also side 
effects to inflict on characters for damage to certain locations.  
Here\'s Glenn\'s chart:

  65	64-65	Ankle/Foot	Fall	Frac	Impd Ankle/amp
  66	66	Incidental

  Secondary Effects:
  #p/r		Character receives additional points of damage per subsequent
  	
    round until medical attention received.

  Drop Items	This might not be automatic.

  Stun		Stunned characters cannot attack or move for 1 round, longer
  in 
    the case of more serious wounds.  Might require rest to recover.

  Fall		Might not be automatic.  Might incur extra damage, usually 1 	
    point, depending on situation.

  Frac		Fracture.  

  Impd		Impaired function of limb, organs, etc.

  Conc		Brain concussion.  Either mild, causing headaches, or serious,
  	
    causing migraines, dizziness, seizures, etc.  Severity increases 	
    if character loses consciousness.

  Lung		Lung puncture, causes additional damage.  

  Throat		Throat wound impairs breathing, causes additional damage.

  Intl		Internal organ hit, causes additional damage.

  Brain		Partial or total paralysis, coma, speech impairment,
  blindness, 	
    personality change, seizures, etc.  This will depend on swiftness
    	 of medical attention and amount of damage taken.

  Spine		Almost always causes paralysis.

  Heart		Heart injury causes additional damage.

  Artery		Major artery hit causing additional damage.

  Amp		Potential amputation.  If large amount of damage received in a
  	
    single hit, character may receive additional 1-3 pts. of damage 	
    per round until medical attention received.  Energy weapon hits 	
    do not incur extra damage as the wound automatically 		
    cauterizes.


The other thing that I would suggest is expanded medical rules.  The 
basic T4 rules don\'t account for continuing damage.  Like the 
character above--he could continue loosing blood and therefore 
receive more damage if he is not treated.

I\'ve put together some medical rules from my own thoughts and other 
Traveller rules.  You can pick and choose from these, and they will 
add another dimension to your game--not to mention make your medic PC 
that much more important and pull the player into him.

These rules are quite long, and watching the length of this post, 
I\'ll put in a second reply to your question.

Sometimes things I copy from my word docs do not come out all that 
great in an e-mail post--all the tabs and such get screwed up.

If you want a better copy of either of these (Glenn\'s hit location 
chart or my medical rules), e-mail me and I\'ll send you the word doc.

This post will continue in another reply.

add another dimension to your game--not to mention make your medic PC
that much more important and pull the player into him.

These rules are quite long, and watching the length of this post, I\'ll
put in a second reply to your question.

Sometimes things I copy from my word docs do not come out all that
great in an e-mail post--all the tabs and such get screwed up.

If you want a better copy of either of these (Glenn\'s hit location
chart or my medical rules), e-mail me and I\'ll send you the word doc.



VII.  HEALING AND MEDICAL TREATMENT.
 1.	Procedure.  Healing can take place either naturally or at an
 increased pace by 	
  medical attention.  There are a variety of steps required for
  specific wounds based 	 on their category.  See the specific
  sections below.  In all cases, Diagnosis must be 	 performed first.

 2.	Diagnosis.  Before medical treatment can be applied, a diagnosis
 roll must be 	
  made.  The time it takes to make this assessment is 3 D6 x 2 minutes
  (DMs:  -	 Medical Skill;  -1 if Edu 5+;  -2 if Edu 10+;  -3 if Edu
  15).  This assumes the injuries 	 are external--if character has
  internal damage, the time roll is 3 D6 x 4 minutes 	 (same DMs).  If
  a TL 7-11 medkit is used, reduce the time factor to 30 sec for 	
  external injuries and 1 min for internal injuries.  If a TL12+
  medkit is used, reduce 	 the time increment to instant.  This time
  increment becomes important to prevent 	 further injury to the
  character due to no medical treatment.     

  To diagnose an injury:  Routine test of Medical skill.

  This task becomes Difficult if it is performed in the field.  If
  this task is failed, the GM will roll 2 D6 on the mishap table to
  see if a misdiagnosis occurred.  On a major 	 mishap, the GM will
  apply an additional 1 D6 damage points from the misdiagnosis.

 3.	Superficial wounds.  Character has taken damage, but no attributes
 have been 	
  reduced to 0.

  Natural healing rate:  2 points per characteristic per day.  Healing
  can only take 	 place while the character is convalescing--meaning
  that a character needs to be 	 home bound or on light duty during
  this period.  

  Treatment roll:  This roll simulates the cleaning and binding of
  superficial wounds to prevent infection.  Treatment requires the use
  of a first aid or medical kit.  If this skill throw is not
  successful, the natural healing rate must be used instead of the 		
  medical healing rate.  The time it takes to perform treatment is 3
  D6 x 2 min (use 	 medical skill level and the Edu DMs listed in the
  diagnosis section as negative DMs 	 on this throw).  Success on this
  throw allows the damaged character to heal at the 	 medical healing
  rate.  This roll indicates that initial treatment has been performed
  	 and a treatment regiment has been prescribed.  The throw does not
  have to be 	 performed more than once, and success indicates that
  the healing procedure has 	 been accomplished.  The patient may be
  given some medication or bandages to 	 administer by himself.  The
  time throw is that required for actual treatment and does 	 not
  include time for lab tests, etc.

  Easy test of First Aid or Medical skill  

  Medical healing rate:  All wound points are recovered in 24 hours. 
  This requires a 	 skill level of Medical-2, First Aid-2, or better. 
  If a skill level 0 or 1 is used, then the 	 natural healing rate
  must be used.  (Medical treatment from a 0 level or level 1 	
  skilled character still needs to be applied to avoid the wound
  deterioration roll.)  	 Healing can only take place while the
  character is convalescing--meaning that a 	 character needs to be
  home bound or on light duty during this period. 

  Wound deterioration:  If a character does not receive proper medical
  attention for 	 his wound in the specified time, there is a chance
  that the superficial wound will 	 deteriorate into a minor wound. 
  Medical treatment must be applied in 2 D6 hours 	 (the diagnosis
  must be completed and treatment must be begun), and if not, this
  roll 	 must be made.  If this roll fails, roll 2 D6 on the mishap
  table and apply extra 	 damage.  Failure on the wound deterioration
  roll indicates that infection has set in.  	 Repeat the 2 D6 roll on
  the mishap table for extra damage every hour until the 	 character
  receives medical care or dies.  If successful medical attention is
  applied 	 (or if the wound deterioration roll is successful but the
  time for medical treatment has expired), the character can recover
  at the natural healing rate.  

  Roll 7- on 2 D6 to avoid wound deterioration 

  Surgery:  Surgery is not required for superficial wounds.

  Replacement body part:  This is not required for superficial wounds.
  



 4.	Minor wounds.  Character has taken damage and one attribute is
 reduced to 0.

  Natural healing rate:  1 point per characteristic per day.  Healing
  can only take 	 place while the character is convalescing--meaning
  that a character needs to be 	 home bound or on light duty during
  this period.  

  Treatment roll:  This roll simulates the cleaning, stitching, and
  bandaging of 	 minor wounds in order to facilitate healing and
  prevent infection.  Treatment requires the use of a first aid or
  medical kit.  If this skill throw is not successful the natural 	
  healing rate must be used instead of the medical healing rate.  The
  time it takes to 	 perform treatment is 3 D6 x 3 min (use medical
  skill level and the Edu DMs listed in 	 the diagnosis section as
  negative DMs on this throw).  Success on this throw allows 	 the
  damaged character to heal at the medical healing rate.  This roll
  indicates that 	 initial treatment has been performed and a
  treatment regiment has been prescribed.  The throw does not have to
  be performed every day.  The time throw is that required for actual
  treatment and does not include time for lab tests, etc.

  Average test of First Aid or Medical skill  

  Medical healing rate:  2 points per characteristic per day.  This
  requires a skill level of Medical-3, First Aid-3, or better.  If a
  skill level 0, level 1, or level 2 is used, then 	 the natural
  healing rate must be used.  (Medical treatment from a 0 level, level
  1, 	 or level 2 skilled character still needs to be applied to avoid
  the wound deterioration 	 roll.)

  Wound deterioration:  If a character does not receive proper medical
  attention for 	 his wound in the specified time, there is a chance
  that the minor wound will 		 deteriorate into a serious wound. 
  Medical treatment must be applied in 1 D6 x 10 	 minutes (the
  diagnosis must be completed and treatment must be begun), and if
  not, this roll must be made.  If this roll fails, roll 2 D6 on the
  mishap table and apply extra damage.  Failure on the wound
  deterioration roll indicates that infection has set in.  	 If a roll
  of 2 exactly is made on the mishap roll, a catastrophic trauma has
  occurred 	 and the character dies immediately.  This reflects the
  fact that sometimes trauma 	 patients may seem okay, but suddenly
  die when a critical blood vessel ruptures or 	 some other hidden
  damage takes full effect.  Repeat the 2 D6 roll on the mishap 	
  table for extra damage every hour until the character receives
  medical care or dies.  	 If successful medical attention is applied
  (or if the wound deterioration roll is 		 successful but the time
  for medical treatment has expired), the character can 	 recover at
  the natural healing rate.  

  Roll 7- on 2 D6 to avoid wound deterioration  

  Surgery:  Surgery is required for all minor wounds resulting from
  gunshot, fragment, blade, and puncture wounds.  It is not needed for
  minor burns from energy weapons.

  Replacement body part:  This is not required for minor wounds.

 5.	Serious wounds.  Character has taken damage and two attributes are
 reduced to 0.

  Natural healing rate:  Serious wounds cannot heal naturally. 
  Medical attention is 	 required.  Serious wounds must be diagnosed
  and stabilized before any healing can 	 take place.  

  Treatment roll:  Serious wounds require the use of a medical
  facility like a local 	 hospital, aid station, or sickbay of a
  starship.  Treatment cannot be performed until 	 the patient has
  been diagnosed and stabilized.  The time it takes to perform 		
  treatment is 3 D6 x 6 min (use medical skill level and the Edu DMs
  listed in the 	 diagnosis section as negative DMs on this throw). 
  Success on this throw allows 	 the damaged character to heal at the
  medical healing rate.  Note that Medical-3 or 	 better is required
  to perform treatment on seriously wounded characters.  This roll 	
  indicates that initial treatment has been performed and a treatment
  regiment has 	 been prescribed.  The throw does not have to be
  performed every day.  The time 	 throw is that required for actual
  treatment and does not include time for lab tests, 	 etc.

  Formidable test of Medical skill  

  Medical healing rate:  1 point per day.  This requires a skill level
  of Medical-3 or 	 better.  Characters of lower skill level cannot
  help seriously wounded characters.  	 This may be attempted once per
  day.  Roll randomly as to which characteristic this is applied to. 
  If the stat rolled is at maximum, no healing occurs that day. 
  Healing can only take place while the character is in the hospital
  or is convalescing.    

  Wound deterioration:  Medical treatment must be applied in 2 D6
  minutes (the 	 diagnosis and stabilization rolls must be completed)
  or the character dies.  If this is 	 completed but medical attention
  at a suitable facility is not performed in the next 	 hour, roll 3
  D6 on the mishap table and apply extra damage.  Serious wounds 	
  automatically begin to deteriorate at a rate determined by this
  mishap throw per hour until major medical treatment is received or
  the character dies.  Any roll of 2 6s 	 indicates (of the three
  dice) a catastrophic trauma has occurred, and the character 	 dies
  immediately.    

  Surgery:  Surgery is required for all serious wounds resulting from
  gunshots, 	 fragments, blades, punctures, and burns from energy
  weapons.

  Replacement body part:  Roll a check to see if the body part is
  damage beyond 	 repair.  The player chooses one of his character\'s
  stats that have been reduced to 0 	 and rolls the stat (undamaged
  level) or less on 3 D6.  If this roll is successful, no 	
  replacement body part is needed.  If the roll fails, replacement
  parts are needed 	 before the limb can function again--or possibly
  before healing can take place.

 6.	Death.  A character who has received damage that reduces three
 attributes to 0 is 	
  dead, but, in the 57th century, these characters still may be
  helped.		

  Assuming the brain is not destroyed (and the torso is not crushed,
  etc.), a 		 character can survive for 1 D6 minutes after the heart
  has stopped.  A character can be saved if he is placed in a low
  berth (or on life support at a TL9+ facility) within this time limit
  (requires Medical-2+).  During this time, the character\'s attributes
  remain 	 at 0, and he will be vulnerable to any influence that
  interferes with his life support 	 such as a severe jolt or
  depletion of needed supplies.  If the dead character is 	 tended by
  a surgeon or other specialist (Medical-4+), he may be sustained in
  this 	 condition indefinitely or until his life supports are
  threatened.  Otherwise, he can only be held in suspended animation
  for 2-12 months.  The character must then make a 	 normal low berth
  survival throw.  The character can be treated at a facility of at 	
  least TL11, and requires a Staggering test of Medical skill
  (requires Medical-4+).  	 Use a DM of +1 for every TL over 13.  If
  this test succeeds, the character recovers in a comatose state with
  one point in each physical attribute.  Subsequent treatment 	 will
  restore one point to one characteristic per week if a roll of 9+ is
  made on 2 	 D6.  Use a DM of +1 for each TL over 12.  The player
  must decide before each 	 week\'s roll which attribute is to be
  restored that week.  If the character misses the 	 roll, the chosen
  attribute is reduced permanently one point.  When stats reach 4 or 	
  the max level, whichever is less, the character may resume limited
  activity.  Up until this point, all healing must be done in a
  hospital.  At the restoration of 4 points, the 	 character may
  convalesce and heal at a rate of one point per stat per day.  This 	
  must be rolled randomly, like for serious wounds, and points applied
  to maxed stats 	 are lost.  

  Dead characters must be diagnosed, resuscitated, and stabilized
  before healing (or 	 they are put in a low berth) can take place.

  Replacement body part:  Replacement body parts are absolutely
  required for dead 	 characters before a limb can function again--or
  possibly before healing can take 	 place. 

 7.	Surgery.  Minor and serious wounds from gunshot wounds and
 fragments 		
  require that the slugs and fragments be removed.  In all cases,
  tissue damage must 	 be repaired.  Wounds from energy weapons will
  often require extensive surgery 	 because their great heat will
  usually cause a steam explosion from the water in the 	 tissues, and
  considerable damage to adjacent tissues from radiated heat.  Doctors
  in surgery must be assisted by at least one surgical technician of
  Medical-2+ and at 	 least one anesthetist.  

  Because recovery from surgery is by no means certain, a wounded
  character 	 undergoing an operation must throw a surgical survival
  and recovery roll.  Roll 2 D6 	 for 6+ for normal recovery.  A 2
  means death on the operating table, and a 3, 4, or 5 means an
  impaired recovery.  Use the DMs below on this throw.  For impaired 	
  recovery, throw 2 D6 of permanent damage to a character\'s stats. 
  These points may be distributed in any fashion the player decides,
  but the dice cannot be broken up.  If any characteristic is
  permanently reduced to 0, the character will remain in a 	 permanent
  coma.

  Surgery Survival Roll DMs
  TL14+ facility	+2
  TL12+ facility	+1
  TL6 facility		-1
  TL5 facility		-6
  Surgeon\'s Dex 8+	+1
  Surgeon\'s Dex 10+	+2
  Medical skill	+1 for each level over 3
  Anesthetist 		+1 if Medical skill is 3+
  Surgical Tech	+1 if Medical skill is 3+

 8.	Post Operative Care.  Characters who undergo surgery require time
 recovering in a 
  hospital and an additional period of reduced activity in
  convalescence.  Characters 	 who have suffered minor wounds require
  2 D6 days in the hospital, and those who 	 have suffered serious
  wounds require 1 D6 x 10 days in the hospital.  During this 	 time,
  a character\'s stats will be halfway (possibly improved) between
  their wounded 	 value and their max value.  For some wound
  categories, their are two healing rates 	 listed--natural and
  medical.  Character\'s may heal at the higher rate given that they 	
  convalesce after their discharge from the hospital.   

  Characters with minor wounds may leave the hospital in half the
  indicated time 	 provided they remain bed patients in the care of a
  Medical-1 nurse for the balance of their recovery period.

 9.	Convalescing.  A character may return to limited duty while he is
 convalescing as 	
  long as the work is not strenuous.  For example, a character may
  perform short 	 hours for navigation or admin positions, but may not
  hunt or exert himself in a 	 piloting (small craft) position. 
  Fighting may be done only in self-defense until the 	 character is
  nearly or completely recovered.

 10.	Medical Costs.  Use these guidelines when deciding how much to
 charge for 	
  doctor\'s fees.  A character can use his medical skill as a positive
  DM on any of the dice throws below when determining cost.

  An ordinary trip to a physician (an office call), on average, costs
  Cr10 per medical 	 skill level.

  The cost of treating a superficial wound is usually 1 D6 x Cr10 plus
  the cost 		 of the office visit.  

  The cost of treating a minor wound is usually 2 D6 x Cr10 plus the
  cost of the office 	 visit.

  The cost of treating a serious wound is usually 4 D6 x Cr10 plus the
  cost of the office visit.

  The cost of treating a critical wound is usually 8 D6 x Cr10 plus
  the cost of the office 	 visit.

  Surgery on a minor wound typically costs  1 D6 x Cr500 plus the cost
  of treating the 	 wound and any other costs incurred. 

  Surgery on a serious wound typically costs  2 D6 x Cr1000 plus the
  cost of treating 	 the wound and any other costs incurred.

  Surgery on a critical wound typically costs  2 D6 x Cr1000 plus the
  cost of treating 	 the wound and any other costs incurred.  

  Hospital care is typically Cr500 per day for first 1D-3 days after
  surgery, then Cr100 	 after that.

  Out patient costs for minor wounds typically run 2 D6 x Cr10 per
  week.

  Character\'s may wish to hire a home health aid or nurse.  Home care
  usually costs 	 Cr25 per day per skill level of the care provider. 
  Hiring a home health aid will alloy 	 the patient to recover points
  at the rate indicated for medical supervision.  

  Taking care of a patient in a near death situation (a character with
  a critical wound 	 saved through the low berth or life support
  procedure) is very expensive.  This costs 	 a minimum of Cr250,000
  for the treatment plus Cr5,000 per day of recovery in the 	 hospital
  and Cr500 per day of outpatient therapy.

  Doctors receive all of the office call and minor surgery fees. 
  Private practice 	 physicians typically receive 50% of the surgical
  fee with the balance going to the 	 hospital and assistants.  Some
  doctors may be on retainer or salary (like when they 	 are in the
  employ of a noble or hospital).  Typically, mercenaries have their
  medical 	 paid for by the organization they work for.

  In addition to these, there is a cost associated with general,
  non-surgical treatment of a wound.  Miscellaneous medical items for
  the treatment of Superficial wounds costs 3 D6 Cr.  For minor
  wounds, this cost is Cr10 x 2 D6.  For serious wounds and 	 above,
  these costs are included in the surgery and hospital costs.

 11.	Stabilization and Resuscitation.  Both serious wounds and
 destroyed wounds must 
  be stabilized before healing can take place.  Dead characters must
  be resuscitated if they are to be healed.  Both of these tasks are
  based on the use of an automed (or in a hospital facility).  If they
  are attempted with a medkit, increase the difficulty one 	 level and
  double the time increment.

  To stabilize a character:  Routine test of Medical skill.  
  (time factor 90 seconds)

  To resuscitate a dead person:  Difficult test of Medical skill.  
  (time factor 30 seconds)

 12.	Low Berths.  Rules for low berth usage is listed on pg. 115 of
 T4.  There are 	
  additional rules on pg. 40 of TD #21.

 13.	Replacement Body Parts.  There are rules for replacement body
 parts, prosthetics, 	
  bionics, regrowth, and cloning on pg. 35 of TD #12.  This is
  continued on pg. 32 of 	 TD #13.  Additional pieces of equipment and
  drugs are listed on pg. 26 of TC #9.

 14.	Instant Healing.  Through use of drugs and medical skill, a
 medical provider can 	
  return hit points directly to a patient at the completion of initial
  treatment.  In order 	 for this to occur, medical treatment must be
  successful and provided in the allotted 	 time for each wound
  category.  

  For superficial wounds, return an amount of points to the injured
  character equal to 	 the Medical or First Aid skill of the care
  provider.  Roll 1 D6 to apply each point (a 	 result of 1=Str,
  2=Dex, 3=End, 4=Int, 5=Edu, 6=doctor\'s choice).  Points applied to 	
  maxed attributes are lost.  

  For minor wounds, care providers must have Medical-2, First Aid-2,
  or better.  Only 	 one point can be applied, and it is rolled in the
  same manner.  If a 0 stat is improved to 1 in this manner, the
  character is no longer unconscious.

  Serious and critical wounds cannot be improved in this manner.

 15.	Medical Skill.  On pg. 45 of T4, it states that the medical skill
 is not only the study 	
  of medicines, but also the training to heal patients and maintain
  health of individuals.  The skill level represents steps in
  increasingly better ability to treat diseases and 	 injuries. 
  Guidelines for the skill are listed below.

  Medical-1 signifies that the individual is a qualified medic.  This
  person can also 	 obtain a license to serve as a medic aboard a
  starship.  A nurse, paramedic, 	 medical student, or EMT would be
  considered to have medical-1.  

  Medical-2 indicates more advanced knowledge equivalent to a
  physician\'s assistant, nurse specialist, or last year medical
  student.  Medical-2 expertise or better allows a +1 DM when reviving
  low passengers.

  Medical-3 is the qualification for a person to be a doctor--whether
  he has a license 	 or not.  A medical license allows a character to
  write prescriptions, handle most 	 ailments, and communicate with
  other doctors on a professional level.

  Medical-4 is usually the minimum qualification for a specialist.

 16.	Surgeon.  To obtain a surgeon\'s license, a character must be a
 doctor (obtained 	
  medical-3) and pass the medical board exam.  The exam is a difficult
  test of 	 medical skill (with Edu), and characters with a Dex of 8+
  receive a +3 DM.  If the 	 character fails this throw, then he has
  flunked his exam but may try again after his 	 medical skill is
  increased.  Only one try per level is allowed.

  Surgery skill throws use the character\'s Dex--not his Edu or Int. 
  Characters who try 	 surgery without being surgeons do so at a
  negative DM equal to 12 - skill level.

 17.	Xeno Medicine.  Normally, medical expertise is considered to
 apply to the 		
  individual\'s own race.  Medical skill for humans is considered to
  apply to humans--	 whether vilani, zhodani, or solomani.  This skill
  also implies, to a limited extent, to 	 the animals which live on
  human worlds and to the ones that live on the character\'s 	 home
  world (or other world where he was trained an practiced).  

  Anyone with a medical skill can apply that skill, with a reduction
  of -2, to aliens.  If 	 the alien organism is broadly similar to the
  race the skill was meant for (carbon 	 based, oxygen breathing,
  water drinking, etc.), then apply a -4 DM to all medical 	 throws. 
  If the organism radically different from the care giving race (for
  example, a 	 creature that metabolizes ammonia or combusts in a
  oxygen atmosphere), then 	 apply a -8 DM to all medical throws.  
  			

  One exception to his rule is human doctors and vargr patients or
  vice versa.  The 	 only modification is that the skill level is
  reduced by 1.  Vargr and human 		 physiology is remarkably similar.

 18.	First Aid?  This skill is described on pg. 42 of T4.  It can be
 used in the place of 	
  Medical skill for any task dealing with superficial or minor wounds.
   The skill can also be used to resuscitate a dead character or
  stabilize a serious or critically wounded 	 character.

 19.	Treatment throws and environment for superficial and minor
 wounds.  		
  Superficial and minor wounds can be treated anywhere as long as the
  doctor has a 	 medical kit.  If treatment is done in the field, use
  a -4 DM.  There is no DM if 	 treatment is done at an average
  facility, like a sickbay in a ship.  When treating 	 these wounds in
  a hospital quality facility, use a +4 DM.

 20.	Time rolls.  In many cases when dealing with medical recovery,
 time is of the 	
  utmost importance.  All time rolls are made the standard way by
  rolling 3 D6 and 	 multiplying by the time factor to see how long it
  took to do a procedure.  Medical 	 personnel can use their skill
  level as a -DM on this time roll to simulate their speed 	 and
  experience.

 21.	Self treatment.  Characters with superficial wounds may treat
 themselves if they 	
  have the proper equipment available.  Characters with minor and
  serious wounds 	 may treat themselves as long as they are conscious.
   Characters with a minor wound must make an End check on 2 D6 (at
  full End) to be able to treat themselves.  The 	 check is made with
  3 D6 in the case of serious wounds.

 22.	Patient/Doctor Time.  Medical care takes time, and there is a
 limit to how much one 
  doctor can do.  It may be necessary to see if a doctor has enough
  time in the day to 	 treat patients if he has several.  Use the
  chart below as a guide to determine the 	 doctor\'s work load by
  counting the number of wound levels (not patients) that he is 	
  treating and multiply by the time factor.  A physician with a heavy
  work load may 	 have to prioritize which patients he treats. 
  Patient time refers to the time the doctor 	 actually spends with
  the patient and any other time the doctor spends behind the 	 scenes
  running tests, researching problems, etc.  

  WOUND LEVEL	PATIENT TIME
  Superficial		30 minutes (total), or the treatment time roll.
  Minor		1 hr. per week
  Serious		1.5 hrs. per day
  Critical		2 hrs. per day

    'body' => 'I have a question concerning the design sequence for 
gauss weapons in FFS.  Why do the lengths of the barrels
increase as the tech level increases, instead of decreasing
due to advances in barrel design?

The tech level modifier table on page 102, top of the second 
column clearly indicates this.  I think it\'s fair to replicate
the table here without violating copyright, so here it is:

	TL	TLm
	10	1.6	
	11	1.3
	12	1.0
	13	0.8
	14	0.6
	16	0.4

The length of the barrel is calculated with the following 
equation (V = velocity in meters per second):

	BarrelLength = V / (100 * TLm)

For instance a velocity of 1058.5 m/s at TL13 gives you a
barrel length of 13.23cm, while at tech level 10 the same
velocity (and less advanced barrels) gives a length of 6.6cm.

So it seems that the weapons designers of the day, if they
wanted to max out their designs for the biggest bang from 
the smallest package, would simply use a TL10 barrel while 
using a TL13 battery pack.  Yeah, sure the battery pack is 
going to be about 1.5 times as big as it would have to be 
for a TL13 barrel, but there is a weight savings.

The battery pack for this weapon would add 55gm to the finished
weight, while the TL10 barrel would have half the mass of
the TL13 barrel (.3969kg / 2 = .19845).  Subtracting the added
weight of the battery from the weight shaved off the barrel 
gives a total weight savings of .14345kg (about 1/3 of a pound).
In larger weapons this savings probably becomes substantial.

So what\'s the verdict? Is this table broken, or has this become
cannon and it\'s going to stay that way, or am I making a mistake
somewhere?  I\'d be more than happy for someone to show me the
error of my ways.

Thanks,

My first suggestion is that TL 12 medical treatment should probably be
advanced enough to put anyone whose pieces are all there back together. My
second suggestion is that your characters were using the wrong weapon; in
any close-range combat they should be using waterknives (EA, page 68). I
had a squad of Imperial Marines attack a pirate crew with them and WHOA
BOY! There were enough body parts flying around to stock a Monty Python

If this was the case, I would agree with you; a few barely functional
relics only slightly more advanced than current technology would add
adventure plots without invalidating canon and turning the game into a
treasure hunt. The trouble is, that is not the impression I got from FS;
there seemed to be a lot of worlds far more advanced than Sylea. I just
didn\'t see how the Third Imperium was supposed to have conquered all these
vastly more powerful systems yet not have advanced to TL 14 itself for
centuries. And EA states the RoM had "experimental" TL 15 weaponry. This
just didn\'t fit with my understanding of Traveller history or the FS data;
shouldn\'t some of the more stable systems have been able to advance past TL
15 after 1700 years?

Amen to your plea against overuse.

Brilliant post, Andrew, I will be using these ideas in my campaign. I just
wish they could be part of the "official" canon. Perhaps some of the people
working on the FS revision could take your ideas into account?

This is something I relate to. I was recently attempting to use the new SSDS 
rules to create the Xboat and Xboat tender. Under the SSDS rules it seems as
if there is no real reason why an Xboat should not have an M-drive since
there seems to be way to much room available for it.

While I really don\'t use the FF&S rules at all, I think that your guesses are 
workable solutions. I myself when doing my SSDS design did not bother the
exact 
storage that I needed, I just knew that I need to use about 35 tons of
space. So I 
used the price and power of 35 tons worth of workstations as a quick fix
until I 
come up with some sort of more reasonable numbers.

The only real question I have about the design you made is why is it TL15?
It has always been my opinion that for standard ship designs, there would be 
one from each tech level starting the earlest tech level it could be built.

The Xboat for example would have a TL 13, 14, & 15 version. Since TL13 is the 
first TL for which jump-4 is possible.

Overall I think you have a solid design.

Since that\'d be in a different system, shipping the unfinished ship is
gonna be *real* expensive unless it is small enough to fit as "normal"
cargo. :-)

Much simpler. First, you can\'t tell if the land *under* the vegetation
is level or if it has deep holes just the right size to eat landing
legs. Also, since there are ships that use reaction drives, you are
likely to cause a brush fire or worse when landing.

I was thinking and I came up with what may be a more workable
alternative. Among other things, it helps handle the high-TL, low Pop
worlds. 

TL is what you can get repaired, or what you can buy. Low Pop worlds
may have a limited selection of items.

That pretty much covers all the possibilities. And it fits what players
need to know. They don\'t care if it is *produced* locally, just so they
can buy it or get it fixed.

The low Pop modifier should be ok with most players. After all,
expecting a world with a pop of 20 to be able to fix an item that
nobody onworld even *owns* is a bit much. But common items they can
likely fix.

I don\'t have my books at hand but I seem to remeber that the

        Barrellenght = V * TLm / 100

This would at least give a sensible answer.

	This isn\'t just a problem with landing spacecraft, either. Vegetation
quite nicely hides holes that will tip one of those little Bobcat
earthmovers if the rear wheel goes into them ... my neighbor was very nice

With "normal" I (of course) mean either average or median depending on how
the distribution looks. I\'m well aware that Sweden is not normal and as you
can read from your quote of my quote that is also not what I\'m saying. What
I\'m saying is that as for violence/crime level/cops per inhabitant etc US
is pretty far from the average case here on earth. Average is taken by
summing a measured factor over all samples and dividing by the number of
samples.

I\'m sorry but statistical measurements has nothing to do with experience or
perception. The formulation of what is to be measured maight be but not the
answer. If I happened to be living in Burma or even i US the fact that
regarding violence(crime level/cops per inhabitants US would still be far
from normal.

Some parts of US works very well indeed and some does not. I do think that
the US is definately a country that I\'d prefer living in compared from the
average case here on earth (most people live in China or India). The
problem with this \'discussion\' is that I did not say \'Sweden is civilized,
unlike the US\' but merely responded to somebodys notion that more laws
would lead to more brutal and violent police. Then I compared two sample
countries (US and Sweden) and noted that despite the fact that we have more
laws and regulation in Sweden (wether this was better or worse I didn\'t
comment) we have far less police brutality than in the US.

I do not think that the US is less civilized than the average case today on
earth. Democracy, free speech, almost no starvation  etc clearly make it
far above tha average but it is more violent and has a larger crime problem

Why is that actually. Marc seem to imply that in 1100 at least women are
equal member of Imperial society and as fencing is more a test of dex than
strength they\'d match men. Were the M0 era less equal by itself or is this
a leftover from the ramshackle empire whose Solomani influences could look
down on women?

Just curious if there\'s any canon (that ugly word again) supporting your ideas?

OK, you can\'t make a 0.01 G MPD drive into a 1 G MPD drive. 6 days for 1
AU is a whole lot better than 20. 

How about a 0.1 G MPD or ion drive?  Could you simply turn the rather
small ion or MPD drive modules I\'ve seen proposed (coffee can sized, if I
remember correctly) into some type of MPD or ion drive attached to a 5-20 m 
long linear accelerator to accelerate the plasma or ionized xenon? 
If MPD is some type of reverse MHD this sounds like it would work pretty 
well.  Am I missing something here?

Would such a drive scale up so that 10 thrust required 10 X power and 10 x
fuel?  It sounds to me like the above approach might need 10X (or possibly
more) power but no more fuel (you simply accererate the same amount of fuel 
significantly faster). 

Also, why can\'t you simply increase thrust by increasing fuel consumption
(up to a point)?

"A revolutionary Australian weapon which fires at twenty times the rate of
the fastest machine gun in the world is taking the US arms industry by storm.
	Prototypes of Metal Storm, as the new gun is called, have fired in
University of Queensland trails at rates from 45,000 to 135,000 rounds a
minute - compared to 6,000 rpm for America\'s top machine gun.
But that is only the start, say\'s the weapon\'s Brisbane inventor, Mr Mike
O\'Dwyer. By early 1996 he expects advanced electronics will make his
largest 36-barrel prototype fire at 1.6 million rpm.
	Experts from leading US arms manufactures are evaluating the technology
which some consider will provide the first really effective defence against
guided missiles, morter shells and smart bombs.
	The weapons enormous rate of fire enables it, literally, to hang a curtain
of lead consisting of tens of thousands of individual bullets in the path
of an incomming projectile.
	The secret of Mr Dwyer\'s invention is that, apart from the bullets his gun
has no moving parts - no breech, firing pin or other conventional mechanism
- - making it a radical departure from 130 years of automatic weapon design.
	Smart electronics fire each round with split second precision, the bullets
travelling no more than 40cm behind one another - compared to 30m in a
conventional fast machine gun.
	"The technologhy is utterly out of left field. My advantage was not having
an engineering or ballistics background, so I was able to approach the
problem more laterally," Mr O\'Dwyer explains.
	In fact Mr O\'Dwyer spent most of his carrer as a successful retailer
before turning to his great interest: invention. He claims to have no
particular interest in weapons, but mearly considered the new firing system
to be the most marketable of his 38 inventions.
	It took the better part of $1.5 million and 15,000 hours of work before
the gun was ready to be shown to the experts, he says.
	Early on, Mr O\'Dwyer took his concept to the Olympic rifle gunsmith MAB
Engineering in Brisbane and enlisted the support of the manager, Mr Graham
Bugden, to build the prototype.
	"Half the team there thought we were raving loonies. But we built one -
and the first time we fired it, it worked."
	Seven prototypes later, including a 36 barrel monster, the gun has been
filmed by the Queensland University chief technical photographer, Mr John
Coker, spitting lead in 45-Round bursts at 135,000 rpm.
	Those rates were achieved using off-the-shelf electronics and three
barrels. With a more sophisticated firing syatem and more barrels, the rate
can be redoubled, Mr O\'Dwyer says.
	The patented technology is presently being evaluated under secrecy
agreements with three leading US arms makers, and is to be appraised by
Australia\'s Defense Science and Technology Organisation.
	Among the weapons which Mr O\'Dwyer believes his will replace is the naval
Phalanx close in anti-missile defence. The Phalanx fires 1450 rounds at an
incoming missile at a rate of 3000 a minute.
	The Metal Storm equivalent will have 1024 barrels in a single pod, each
loaded with 17 bullets. This will put up 17,000 rounds at a rate exceeding
10 million per minute.

newspaper\'s science and high tech section late in 1995.

The equation actually reads BarrelLength = V / 100TLm, and in FFS2
it reads in a much clearer way:
                                              V
				BarrelLength = ----
                                         100 * TLm

Which still gives a longer barrel for higher TL.  There are two 
ways to alleviate the problem; either write the equation
L = (V * TLm) / 100 or invert the table.  In either case the barrel
length come down with TL rather than increase.  However changing the
equation gives more of a reduction than inverting the table.

I agree FFS1 was very hard to understand on some points.  However, 
when I tried using the beta of FFS2 to design the barrel, I had the
same problem.

there is no objective universe. Your observations is all there is but if
you feel more comfortable thinking that your perception of the universe has
changed, fine as the effects are the same. All measurements are relative to
a given reference frame and that is the source for the names of Einsteins
two relativity theories.

It is similar to doppler shift: When you here an ambulance zooming past and
the pitch shifts down do you think the pitch changed or that your
perception of the pitch changed?

It depends on how narrow band your radars/sensors are. If your perceived
rate of time is 10% of the resting universes then the aft reflected
radarpulses would have x10 longer wavelength which probably would mean
they\'re undetected by the receiver. The radar to the fore would similarly
get one tenth the wavelength with probably the same result.

   American movies don\'t help.  In the second "Die Hard" movie (the one
in which he makes a call from a Pac Bell pay phone in a D.C. airport),
the hero rants about the bad guys carrying Glocks that won\'t be picked
up by the metal detectors.  Ignoring the titanium steel frames must make 
for good theater.
   In the Clint Eastwood movie about the American Secret Service, the 
bad guys has a ceramic, double barreled pistol made.  He still has to sneak
in the very metal bullets.

I\'m not certain you\'ll find SSDS as it\'s copyright, but Guy \'Wildstar\'

You don\'t need manpower? Mid-tech means no expert systems. The knowledge may
be there in books, but you need people who _knows_ the stuff to apply it.
And, even worse, you need people to DO the work.

First of all, I don\'t believe that. In fact, it seems so utterly untrue to
me that it is a bit of a shock to realize that I can\'t produce any hard
evidence to support my claim. I\'ve always taken it as a truism that it
takes a lot of people to run an industrialized society. I\'ve seen it
stated (as a truism) in several SF books. But no factual evidence springs
to mind. So perhaps you are right. But I don\'t think so. What makes YOU
think that a mere 3000 people can provide all the functions needed to
build a functioning TL 6 society? Do you have any evidence?

Secondly, 3000 people are population level 3. There are plenty of planets in 
the Traveller universe with pop level 1 and 2 with industrial technology. Do 
you also thing that 50 people can run a TL 7 society with no outside help?

Which would make it _harder_ to provide all the elements of a society, not
easier.

Because there are more than 3000 different professions involved in running
a mid-tech society.

The actual government has very little to do with it. You need miners to dig 
out the ore and coal, steelworkers to refine the steel, smiths to make the 
digging tools and railway tracks, lumberjacks to provide the ties, carters 
to move the material around, cartwrights to build the carts, roadbuilders to 
build the roads, engineers and surveyors to plan the railway, tracklayers 
builders to lay the tracks, someone to build the engine and waggons, farmers 
to grow the food everybody eats, not to mention the plethora of people in 
tertiary occupations needed just to keep a society running: bricklayers to 
build the houses people live in, brickmakers to make the bricks, doctors to 
cure the sick, teachers to teach, policemen to police, entertainers to 
entertain, administrators to administrate...

I see no reason to presume that. If it is a high-tech colony it may have a
\'cut-off colony survival package\' in its copious computer memory, but I
wouldn\'t bet on it. How many people actually plan for ultimate disasters?
But even if they did, they simply wouldn\'t have the manpower to run a
proper society. Odds are that they would die out; second best odds that
they would regress to low tech in a generation or two.

Agreed, but I don\'t see the problem with that. You just change the UPP to
reflect the new reality in the next sourcebook. Why is that a problem?

Exactly my point.

If everybody outside San Fransisco were suddenly to vanish and the land to
be returned magically to pristine wilderness, most of the people of San
Fransisco would die in a few months as the food ran out. The rest would
scatter far and wide and develop subsistence farming. In any case, I
believe the population of San Fransisco is well into the millions, right?
That is well into the number I think could run a modest industrial
society. Maybe even TL 8.

But if I go to an American-owned mine in P-NG with a busted lap-top I could

infrastructure would be there, in a way.

I disagree. The speed with which the Imperium expanded into Deneb and the
Spinward Marches indicates (to me) that the met almost no problems on the
way. Certainly not active corsair problems. IMO Deneb, Corridor and the
rimward half of the sectors immidiately corewards of them were comparatively
open. Any Vargr worlds would be low- to mid-tech. When the Imperium moved
into these areas it attracted the Vargr from further coreward and the
Imperium abandoned their settlements coreward of the Spinward Marches/Deneb/
Corridor sector border.
 
Just a theory, of course.

A perfect billiard ball...hmmmm...that is interesting.  Perhaps this is not
a "true" planet at all, but an ancient experiment gone bad.  Yeah, that\'s
it!  The agents, tired of terraforming (which explains the number of
Earth-like worlds) toyed with the idea of creating planets.  This is the
remains of a failed attempt.  The planet "shell" was created and then put
into the proto-shell of a newly formed solar system which was missing a
planet at the proper distance from the star.  Since most of the heavy matter
had already been incorporated into existing planets, the shell mostly
collected water.  Disappointed with the results, the Ancients modified their
approach to creating habitable worlds, but did their best with the world
they had.  They created pseudo-continents from a fibrous mat which floated
on the water surface.  Over time, this mat has exausted the supply of a
critical component in the water world (say an obscure chemical component
like Iridium) and the size of the mats reduced and started to break up.
This lead to the "floating raft people" suggested by Mr. Henry.

Realizing that their civilization was teetering on the edge of extinction,
the populous managed to create a series of "bubble cities" to house the bulk
of the population and moved from the mats to the "bubble cities" before the
mats came apart.  In a cruel twist of fate, the scientific community
responsible for the creation of the "tubes" was decimated when a large
asteroid sank the research mat.  Sadly this technology could not be
reproduced before the mats started to disintegrate at an alarming rate and
the populous concentrated on extending existing bubble worlds and building a
fleet of ships which could withstand the weather (the "factory" ships).  It
was anticipated that the mats would dissolve but the Iridium in the asteroid
was enough to allow some of the mats to continue to survive, though a
fraction of their former size.

Unbeknownst to the general bubble city inhabitants, the mining which they
are doing is slowly eating away the crust of the world which is only a few
hundred miles thick.  Particularly deep tunnels might even get to the
mechinations which still remain from the Ancient\'s experiment...

That was a favorite.  I first ran across that in Analog, IIR.  I believe I
also ran into a story of similar length there which had leading scientists
of both the US and the USSR defecting to Saudi Arabia, there to build some
doomsday bombs, simply to stop the two superpowers from continuing the cold
war.

As one of the proponents of the R# idea, let me continue to throw support

<scratching my head>  Are you sure?  

Ah ha! I bet it\'s an order of operations thing! ;->

The grouping should be V/(100*TL), so the denominator gets larger as
tech levels go up.

Take this example: 

Velocity = 4000m/s

TL      V/(100*TL)
====================== 
10         4.00
11         3.64
12         3.33
13         3.08

Given a constant velocity, barrel length will go down as Tech Levels go
up?

Yes, but why should I change this, unless we\'re saying, for some reason,
that hi pop worlds can\'t exist. It\'s been mentioned many times throughout
canon that the Hi Pop worlds are what shape and drive the
imperium...they\'re your biggest markets and the biggest movers and
shakers. The fact that for almost all of the Traveller timeline, the game
play was set far off in the provinces doesn\'t change the fact that the
social and technological dynamic of the Imperium IS set and ruled by those
Hi Pop planets.

I\'d drastically change the socio-economic picture of Earth, too, if I
eliminated Hong Kong, New York, London, Paris, Bombay, Singapore,
Shanghai, and Tokyo from consideration.

Unless we decide that these Hi Pop worldsare wrong, either in TL or
otherwise they\'re part of the picture we have to develop of the young
Imperium.

impressed. The quality appears to be up a lot, and I have to agree with the
comments from Ken et al.

I\'ve only looked in detail at EA so far (PE deserves more than a quick
flick!) and I like the presentation and the ability to have some weapons
appropriate to the M1100 campaign I\'m running at the moment. 9D damage. ;-)
That\'ll make the players think twice! Gripes are similar to those reported
to date - the missing gun details, and the non-canon RoM references. I can
handwave TL13 (or even just the odd TL14 weapon)  but not TL15+. And
certainly not Vilani stuff at TL13+. However, they fit just right into a
1100 background. My other wish is that the weapons were one long list by
TL, followed or preceded by the detailed text explainations. The mixing and
matching does break the text flow (probably as it was intended), and I
don\'t like it. But, I am impressed with the standard of the book. 8/10

PE looks delicious! However, the only comment I\'ll make until I\'ve read it
is that I suggest that IG look at MT\'s use of sidebars in the main rules.
They were much more readable. Perhaps the typography was a little better.
But that\'s only a minor point.

If IG can keep these standards going, and even improve them, I\'ll be happy.
(My comments about a broken FS/M0 release still stand. It needs fixing to
make it worth my while. But hey, we\'re doing that!)

(After some recent examples of offense taking gone wrong, it would take a
lot more than a little skepticism over fusion energy to get my goat Eris,
but thanks for inserting that anyway)

Craig has a good point, we have a good example of fusion occurring in
the sky over our heads.  We have no such example of this "new" process
that might be what the "cold fusion" people have found.

And, as implied originally and above, I don\'t mean to say that they
haven\'t found anything at all.  I just wanted to insert a bit of
skepticism over the original post\'s absolute truthfulness.  There has been
too much controversy around the whole subject of "cold fusion" at this
point to take any news on the subject at face value until it has been
rigorously evaluated.

I would much prefer to go looking for new employment so I can afford the
new "grav car" Chevy comes out with in \'07 than keep my job  and find out
there is no "amazing discovery" to be made in this field.  Of course, I\'d
really rather do both :)

[soapbox mode on]

Another note about the Hot Fusion program though; in the 50s when the
scientific community went to Congress with the idea of a Fusion Research
Effort they "promised" that if you spend X dollars over Y years you will
have viable fusion energy.  X was measured in Billion and Y was 30 or 40
years.  To date the U.S has spent far less than X (in adjusted dollars)
and, not suprisingly, Y has gotten proportionally bigger.  The fact is,
the vision that the original Fusion Scientists had has yet to be shown
wrong, and in fact we are getting closer and closer to "hot" ignition, as
well as spinning off a lot of good science with collateral effects
(including work on superconducting magnets and levitating trains, and
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance to name a few).

So feel free to be skeptical, but be sure you\'re giving the Fusion program
it\'s due when comparing it to the "cold fusion" experiments occuring
around the contry.  You\'re comparing a mature, well directed science to a
collection of experiments which has had less than 10 years  development
time, and has produced more than its fair share of "unreproducable"
experiments, and which have no certain theoretical basis or explanation.
Again! I don\'t mean to say that there\'s nothing there, or that in 10 more
years it is not possible that we\'ll be getting all our electricity from
this process, I just mean to point out the differences in the programs and
the merits of the Hot over the Cold at this time. 

To some people, the problems of ignition are "merely" engineering
problems, whereas the theory or "science" is certain (others would
disagree, but all would admit that the theory is at worst "not quite
complete"). In the cold fusion world, on the other hand, there is not yet
a well accepted theory that even explains the phenomenon that seems to be
producing energy. 

Geez I think I made my point now.  Hope all take this as intended; In my
Opinion only as an amateur connected to the Fusion Program by employment.
(I\'m just an accountant!  Really!).

AHA! You have run afoul of the same error people make again and again.

The Flight Computers on starships are NOT ordinary multi purpose
computers, but massively redundant highly parallel milspec combat rated
computer systems with some highly specialized computing subsystems, and
the volume and mass includes much of the networking infrastructure
required.

Xboat \'databanks\' are probably just really, really big RAID systems with
big honking I/O pipelines to suck the data in and out fast, and as such
are much cheaper that flight
computers.

In fact, at BEST, using Flt computers to do this would make as much sense
as trying to set up a Cray as a workgroup file server...you could, at vast
expense and trouble, and you would end up with a finicky beast that
wouldn\'t be a very good file server. 

At Worst, it would be like trying to set up a file server using the
onboard computer in your GM car...hey, those are based on multipurpose
microprocessors, and probably have the raw computing horsepower yopu need
for a file server (which, truth be told, isn\'t really a hell of a lot,
depending on the number of users you\'re servicing)

Hey! good idea...and it finally makes sense of the A B C structure...A

With "normal" I (of course) mean either average or median depending on how
the distribution looks. I\'m well aware that Sweden is not normal and as you
can read from your quote of my quote that is also not what I\'m saying. What
I\'m saying is that as for violence/crime level/cops per inhabitant etc US
is pretty far from the average case here on earth. Average is taken by
summing a measured factor over all samples and dividing by the number of
samples.

I\'m sorry but statistical measurements has nothing to do with experience or
perception. The formulation of what is to be measured maight be but not the
answer. If I happened to be living in Burma or even i US the fact that
regarding violence(crime level/cops per inhabitants US would still be far
from normal.

Some parts of US works very well indeed and some does not. I do think that
the US is definately a country that I\'d prefer living in compared from the
average case here on earth (most people live in China or India). The
problem with this \'discussion\' is that I did not say \'Sweden is civilized,
unlike the US\' but merely responded to somebodys notion that more laws
would lead to more brutal and violent police. Then I compared two sample
countries (US and Sweden) and noted that despite the fact that we have more
laws and regulation in Sweden (wether this was better or worse I didn\'t
comment) we have far less police brutality than in the US.

I do not think that the US is less civilized than the average case today on
earth. Democracy, free speech, almost no starvation  etc clearly make it
far above tha average but it is more violent and has a larger crime problem
than the average case on earth. Why that is the case is an interesting
question but pretty off topic. Sorry if I stepped on somebodys toes by
implying that there are aspects of US culture that aren\'t perfect (the last
paragraph would surely make the blood boil for some on the list but if art
is about evoking emotion then I\'m simply exercising my artistic freedom ;))

(I snipped off your closing remarks about my mind and personality as these
were a bit off amrk for general discussion don\'t you think.)

From EA, page 3:

"At least two firms have subcontracts with other worlds to provide
unfinished hulls, which are brought to Sylean space on huge dispersed frame
cargo ships, to be fitted with locally produced thruster plates, drives,
and sensors."

Of course, EA was wrong about the ROM\'s highest TL, unless that is now
officially going to be changed. Unless we just mark it down to 1700 years
of uncertainty and lost records and rumor about a rumored "Golden Age," the
only facts about which are probably locked away deep in the territory of an
enemy power...

 Not necessarily - if there are distinctly both ZS and RM ruins
 on the same planet, include both codes - and similarly for
 either or both, plus Ancients.  Remember, this is in the
 Remarks column, which is less structurally restricted than any
 other part of the UWP where this kind of info might be found.

 For example, a world with (undiscovered by ZS or RoM) Ancient
 ruins at TL18, Ziru Sirka ruins (abandoned or ruined by the
 Rule of Man) at TL 11, and Rule of Man ruins at TL12 would
 simply have three codes in the Remarks area: AnI ZSB RMC.  Yes,
 it will mean some more work for the people doing the FS/M0
 rework - but it\'s work that really shouldn\'t have been
 necessary; it\'s fairly clear that the revised data wasn\'t
 generated using the standard rules, from any incarnation of
 Traveller.  I\'d have no problem (and could trivially write a
 computer program to do the basic drudge work) with discarding
 the non-civilization-related data from the UWPs and just
 re-generating them from the physical data (sector, location,
 size, atmo, hydro). Then, all that would have to be done would
 be manually adjusting the significant planets as needed (such
 as Vland, Sylea, and so on).  It might even be possible (though
 programmatically a little more difficult) to set it up so that
 "key" planets like the above will have an influence on the
 nearby worlds - assuming that someone can formulate rules to
 describe that influence.

get a lot closer to Core. Lishun has a population close to that of Core at
TL C, as does Dagudashaag, and fairly significant populations exist at TL
D in 4 sectors: Dagudashaag, Gushemege, Illeiesh, and Masillia,
significant here being in excess of half of Core\'s population at TL C.

The problem arises, of course, of explaining why the Imperium arose in
Core, with this distribution of technology, and why do we persist in
calling it the \'Long Night\' when at this point, there is 74% of the
population in the galaxy living at Early Stellar or above tech levels.

Here are the sector by sector breakdowns:

sector	Pop at TL 9+	% of total sector pop
ant	5.74E+11	61%
cdr	1.10E+12	99%
cor	8.40E+11	77%
dag	1.15E+12	80%
del	1.87E+12	92%
for	4.74E+11	66%
gus	4.54E+11	50%
ile	7.18E+11	59%
lis	1.02E+12	71%
mas	9.89E+11	62%
zar	5.16E+11	90%
		
Total	9.70E+12	74%

What this data really looks like is ca 1000-1100 data... perhaps a bit low
in high tech, but it appears whatever algorithm was used to generate the
TL merely capped to TL to some extent, and didn\'t have a depressing effect
throughout the calculations.

Unless some reasonable explanation can be worked out as to WHY the
Imperium, over all the others was able to take over these well matched
foes (speaking on a sector-wide level, of course) when they actually
enjoyed a superiority of tech/population, I think the FS tech level data
needs to be brought down a couple of notches overall.

Notice, the only sector which DID give the Imperium a run for it\'s money,
Antares has a lower Population/tech.

All of this is, however, utterly worthless speculation because thereis a
very large wildcard in all of this mixture, which is the true TL and
population of the Vland sector...As the annexation of Vland into the 3I is
the first \'megamerger\' of the 3I, this could well have a domino effect on
all the formerly equivalent \'Pocket Empires\' out there.

I haven\'t got my books here, so I\'m not sure how that went...were there
hostilities between Vland and the 3I or was it a peaceful merger?

Since the shepard moons tend to be tiny, you can do anyone of four things:

1> Assume the presence of the necessary sheppard moons.

2> Add a size "S" moon in the next diameter orbit, or make note of it\'s
presence in the same orbit as the ring.

3> Consider the ring a recent phenonenon, which will disperse sometime in
the next million years or so.

4> Remove the ring.

I\'d lean towards 1, with 3 being fairly rare.

Thing is that you aren\'t multiplying 100 by the tech level, but by a 
tech level modifier.  The tech level modifier (TLm) goes down as the
tech level increases.  L = V/(100*TLmod) is the right order of ops though.

The table actually reads:

      TL	TLm
	10	1.6	
	11	1.3
	12	1.0
	13	0.8
	14	0.6
	16	0.4

So for Velocity = 4000m/s you get:

      TL |   V    / ( 100 * TLm )  =  Length
      ----
	10 |  4000  / ( 100 * 1.6 )  =   25 cm     
      11 |  4000  / ( 100 * 1.3 )  =   30.77 cm
      12 |  4000  / ( 100 * 1.0 )  =   40 cm
      13 |  4000  / ( 100 * 0.8 )  =   50 cm
      14 |  4000  / ( 100 * 0.6 )  =   66.67 cm
      16 |  4000  / ( 100 * 0.4 )  =  100 cm

As you can see, with the table and the equation given 
the design of barrel length is broken.

far from calling folks at random, they\'re working their way down a list
of purchasers -- I was somewhat late in my original hardback/signed rules
purchase, bought a T-shirt (yeah I felt really fan-boyish) and a JTAS
subscription a long while after that, and currently have an order in for
the revised rules set.  Thus, I seem to have been called later than many,
though not at the tail end of the sequence.

Melody seems well practiced in the hard sell!  I begged off ordering
Pocket Empires from IG, pointing out that my local retailer is holding a
copy for me and that it doesn\'t do them any good to antagonize their main
but uncompensated sales force.  She agreed, but possibly only because she
was being so pleasant.  :-)

How have other folks been handling the issue of not buying IG products
sight unseen until they "prove" themselves with more in the style of EA
and PE?  I think I managed it put it fairly diplomatically (wishing the
best for IG, enjoying the latest products and apparent turnaround in
company policies and management, but still doing the "wait and see"), and
she seemed somewhat familiar with the refrain.  And still pleasant as all
get-out.

Have the dutiful but too-oft-burnt TML partisans been making a good,
productive impression on IG\'s marketing apparatus?

    'body' => 'I\'ve created some more forms for those of you who get into the 
details of running a starship like I do.

Traditionally, these forms will be maintained by the player who is 
running the steward aboard the ship, but another character can be 
selected as the ship\'s administrative officer.  Sometimes the Captain 
will handle the administrative affairs of the ship; sometimes it 
will be the ship\'s broker/trader; and sometimes it will be another 
character with high admin skill.  Whatever the case, this character 
should have skills such as streetwise, carsousing, 
liason, bribery, trader, broker, fast talk, jack of all trades, law, 
leadership, perception, and psychology to rely upon besides 
administration.

The ship\'s administrative officer takes care of payroll, inventories 
cargo, manages the ship\'s financial matters, deals with starport 
authorities, purchases supplies, finds work for the ship, etc.  This 
is an important function aboard ship, especially for a merchant 
vessel, and can lead to several interesting types of role playing 
encounters.

Besides the standard GDW cargo form (TAS form 14, Cargo Manifest), I 
have created additional forms for the ship\'s administrative officer.

They are--

1)  Ship\'s Operating Fund

This simple form is used to keep track of the ship\'s financial 
account which is used to buy things like fuel and life support and 
pay for things like crew salaries and bething costs.



2)  Shadow Fund

This simple form is like the Ship\'s Operating Fund, except it is used 
as a separate account for subsidized merchant vessels.  Subsidized 
merchants, as per the usual subsidy agreement, must pay 50% of the 
ship\'s revenues to the subsidy holder.  This includes revenue 
from standard ship operations like speculative trade, freight runs, 
passengers, charters, etc.  

There are some things, though, that will make money for the crew 
members without being a standard ship function.  Say the characters 
are hired to perform as body guards for a noble.  This revenue has 
nothing to do with the ship\'s normal functions, and the subsidy 
holder has no claim to 50% of it.  Monies like this will be put into 
the Shadow Fund and managed like the regular Operating Fund account, 
except it will not be considered when subsidy payments are made.



3)  Ship\'s Maintenance Fund

The yearly overhaul for ship can be a big hit to the ship\'s operating 
fund.  To prepare for this, an account can be set up where equal 
weekly payments (from the Operating Fund) are made to the maintenance 
fund.  When the annual overhaul arrives, the money from this account 
is used to pay for it.

This account can also be used as a savings account of last resort if 
the characters get desperate for money.  Characters can dip into this 
account if they need to and try to repay the money taken at a later 
date.



4)  Ship\'s Fuel Tankage

This form is used to keep track of how much fuel the ship has.  
There\'s blanks for total fuel tankage and additional fuel from items 
like demountable fuel tanks.  There\'s also a blank for purification 
plant fuel purfication rate per hour, fuel scoops intake per hour, 
and power plant fuel usage per year.

Additionally, there is a space to record fuel use based on the jump 
number number of the jump completed.  A steward or admin officer can 
take a quick look at this and know how much fuel is used in a jump 
without having to recalculate each time.



5)  Life Support

Life support costs Cr1000 per person per week.  This form helps keep 
track of how many days of life support the ship has.  Simply multiply 
how many people are aboard the ship by the number of days in space 
and subtract this amount from the available life support days on the 
form.

This can lead to some interesting role playing scenarios when the 
players realize that they have been in space longer than they have 
anticipated and are running out of life support.  Things get pretty 
hairy on a ship when air and food start running out.



6)  Life Support for Low Berths

The low berth life support form is based on low berth usages rather 
than days.  The steward or administrative officer can keep track of 
low berth supplies using this form.



If you would like any of these forms to use in your campaign, then 
send me a personal e-mail.  I\'ll send the requested ones to you in a 
Word v2.0 file (which is importable to Word v6.0 and \'97 versions).

Simple Ship Design System and Quick Ship Design System.  Both are derived
(with modifications) from FF&S; QSDS is a simplified component-based
subset of SSDS.

QSDS is in the T4 main rules book (with critical tables missing); SSDS is
in the _Starships_ supplement.

Both are also available (with errata fixed) on the net.  My own THUDDD
main page at http://www.cinenet.net/users/cberry/thuddd.html contains
links to both systems\' support pages.

Yeap!

Unless you contract DuFord Industrial, with its amazing (and fully
equipped) portable shipyard to pop in a install one of their custom
JumpTech 500 Jump Drives.

Would that be possible - if you have the tools, the parts and the
trained personnel then you should be able to install or fix anything
anywhere that has the space and access.

Incorrectly...  Autofire inflicts multiple hits - that will blanket the

Right.

Did I misunderstand/misread something?  Does this mean that if you inflict
damage that drives a characteristic to zero, the excess damage points are
applied against another characteristic?  If that\'s the case, I withdraw any
comments about bloodiness!  An extra damage hit could easily kill a
character in that case...


Thanks to both of you for yr comments (I\'ve one PC who has medical-1 and
is, figuratively, dying to expand its use - I\'m passing Ken\'s recovery
rules to him to peruse..) I must plead T4 combat inexperience!  We run a
generally unviolent campaign - the player reaction when guns are pulled is
along the lines of "Oh! Somebody\'s gonna get hurt!"  Due to a collective
brain-fart, we simply misused the two SMGs involved in the fight.

Well now that *does* look wrong!  The TLmod number should NOT go down as
tech level increases, if that formula is going to be used..I don\'t
think.

I\'d say you are right, and either the formula or the TLmod table is
wrong.

I\'ve just joined the list, so I thought I\'d introduce myself.  I\'m a 32-
year-old software engineer and former computer game author with too
little time on my hands.  My hobbies are basically all game-related
(except for hill-walking) - board games, card games, RPGS, Interactive
Fiction.  The RPGs that take up most of my money and attention are GURPS
(for its in-game rules and character generation) and Traveller (for its
setting(s) and universe generation rules).

I first encountered Traveller back in 1980 or 81, before I\'d even
started roleplaying.  I bought High Guard, and then Scouts, long before
I got the main rules.

I\'m very much a solo traveller.  When tired, instead of sitting in front
of the TV I\'ll sometimes roll up a world or several - which is usually
enough to wake me up sufficiently to think about what the results
mean.  I\'ve also used this technique for "Just In Time" world
development in a solo exploratory merchant game (which met an untimely
end when I lost my notes moving house 8-().

I am not a military buff, and have very little interest in vehicle
design (so no THUDDD entries from me ;-), but I enjoyed the Starship
Operator\'s Manual because it had a lot on shipboard character roles.

I *am* interested in world design (my favourite books from the first
three incarnations being Scouts, WBH and WTH), politics and economics.

But enough of me.  You all just carry on - I\'ll sit back and watch for a
bit.

Yeah, that\'s what I\'d fund first too! I\'m an SPS man from way back. ;->

I\'m not defending the "cold fusion" crowd. If they have something they
don\'t need it and if they don\'t they don\'t deserve it. ;-> I haven\'t
seen any conclusive proof, but there\'s quite a bit of smoke out there. 
We\'ll have to wait and see.

When it comes to RW you shouldn\'t accept much of *anything* "until it
has been rigourously evaluated"..yes? ;->  I\'m afraid I\'m still
skeptical of the "hot" boys claims too.  It seems we never see them
without their hands in Uncle\'s pocket, and a claim that just "a few
billion more dollars and a few more years." 

Now, keep in mind that if *I* held the purse-strings I\'d probably give
it to them, but I\'d fund the super-collider, NASP, and enough space
related projects to employ the world\'s supply of engineers, too.  Heck,
we\'re already running a 100 billion a year deficit..what\'s another 10-15
billion! ;-> 

I\'d still be skeptical about any of it working, though. It\'d be
wildcatting money, maybe it\'s a dry hole, maybe it\'s a gusher. One
gusher will pay off a *lot* of dry holes.


Eris,

    'body' => 'Well last weekend we played the first significant space combat using the
Role-Playing Space Combat System v0.9, kindly designed by a bunch of
familiar names. Overall the system held up very well. Rather than bore you
all with a narration, I will summarize a few of the remarks and rulings I
made for the combat, both good and bad. I welcome any feedback on these
comments or rulings; hopefully the problems we ran into can be considered
for the RPSCS v1.0.

The best feature of the RPSCS is mentioned in the name; its focus on
role-playing. Instead of waiting it out while ship stats decide their fate,
characters\' skill and actions determine the outcome. This is what I play
Traveller for.

Another good feature is the sensor rules. Sensors in the RPSCS are well
defined, useful, even fun. The separate Detection and Weapon Lock steps
mean sensor operators are vital at all stages of battle, and the differing
properties of active, passive, and jamming use of sensors means simply
turning on every sensor on the ship won\'t be effective; you actually have
to use strategy. Gamers often talk about a "balance of playability versus
realism"; I think this idea is nonsense, here is an example of a rule that
is both playable, realistic, and fun.

Unfortunately, the sensor rules give no indication of how many sensor rolls
are allowed. One per ship? One per sensor? One per sensor technician? The
sensor packages offered only provide enough power for one active sensor so
this may be moot for the current rules, but what about custom ships or
special rulings? Since the RPSCS actually makes sensors useful in combat it
would be advantageous to install redundant sensors and there should be
rules to handle them. There should also be guidelines for initial detection
ranges for various situations. I would also like to see rules for Neutrino
and Densitometer sensors.

One ruling I follow which heightens drama considerability is hiding enemy
ship characteristics. In combat I only describe features of the enemy ships
that sensors will reveal, like position, energy output, and weapon
signatures. This ruling makes players more cautious; they don\'t just fire
every missile on board as soon as they get a sensor lock.

The ship damage rules are also very well done, especially the hit
description and crew effects. However, what should I do if a nonexistent or
destroyed component gets hit? I have been rolling again for nonexistent
components and ignoring hits on destroyed components; the theory being that
if there is nothing there to get hit the damage hits another component, but
an inoperative component can still get hit again. One thing I dislike is
the rule that crew in a hit section take a generic 3 dice damage; it means
crew in typical body armor are immune to hits in their section. I feel it
unlikely that a weapon which can burn through centimeters of crystaliron is
going to be stopped by a flak jacket. There should also be guidelines on
what will depressurize the ship, and the effects on characters.

Rules for using computers are extremely vague. I know that computers are
just part of the \'background\' in Traveller, but I feel adding special
computer rules adds a lot of potential for player interaction and another
level of tactical possibilities.

I don\'t understand how many attacks each weapon gets. Is the "Rate of Fire"
the number of attacks per turn or just some abstract number? If a ROF 100
laser really gets 100 attacks each turn, every ship in the fleet is going
to be destroyed before the first turn is up! The SSDS says ROF "can be
increased up to 100 by increasing the power...", but then shows weapons
with a ROF of 800! The autofire rules don\'t make any sense applied to
starship weaponry. To add to the confusion detonation-laser missiles, which
also make multiple attacks, roll 1 die for how many hits they get and have
no autofire DM. While I\'m griping about this, the autofire rules in
Emperor\'s Arsenal are different from that in the main book. WOULD SOMEBODY
PLEASE TELL ME HOW TO HANDLE RATE OF FIRE IN TRAVELLER!? So far I have been
ignoring ROF entirely.

In my opinion the movement rules are unnecessarily complicated.
Velocity-dependent variable movement points which can be borrowed from
future turns? I understand the goal is to integrate facing and vector
movement, but all this effort still results in movement which resembles
ocean-going surface ships more than space vessels. I think I have said
before that any space combat system that uses a 2-D map for position is
totally abstract and not at all realistic. And of course Traveller already
had perfectly simple and realistic vector movement in Mayday. If the combat
system is going to be abstract anyway why not base it on range bands and
get rid of the useless 2-D map? If it is supposed to be representational,
why not be the first SF RPG (that I know of) to use 3-D movement rules? I
recall one TML poster suggesting Mayday movement rules with an auxiliary
Y-Z grid map. I will try running a combat using that idea one of these days
and post any impressions.

Lest I give too negative an impression, the RPSCS is the best space combat
game I have ever played, beating even Mayday. The sensor rules are great.
It can be integrated into a regular campaign or played as a separate game.
It is vastly superior, even in its \'prerelease\' form, to the Basic Ship
Combat System in the T4 rulebook. IG should seriously consider using if for
T4 Deluxe.

If you are referring to Europe\'s "Dark Ages" you are entirely incorrect.
Crop rotation, improved horse collars, windmills (borrowed from Central
Asia) Stirrups (borrowed from Asia), Gunpowder (borrowed from Asia),
mechanical clocks (the basic for modern gear technology) all were invented
or brought into Europe from 500 AD-1300 AD.  In many ways, this era had a
faster rate of technological progress than the Roman Empire. [1]

The inventions I listed as borrowed from Asia (generally from China) were
imported by Westerner travelers, the rest were invented by Europeans, all
during the "Dark Ages".  The only time the technological progress of a
large society ceases is when it is actively falling apart.  The rate of
progress may be slow (and often is) or it may be rapid, but it happens. 

The concept of the "Dark Ages" is a myth made up by scholars in the
Renaissance to make themselves feel good, and promulgated by narrow-minded
Victorians, it is not accepted as valid by any modern scholars of the
history of science and technology. 

Many worlds would have died or sunk to barbarism during the Long Night,
but some would rise from it again, and I\'d imagine of the easily habitable
(say Atm 7, Hydro 4-9) worlds would have continued to progress (albeit
slowly in most cases).  Humans don\'t sit around and stagnate for 1700
years, ever.

Thank you!  (For the best post of the month and it\'s only the third).


Reminds me of breaking down in the middle of the Australian outback the day
after an intensive training course had given us all a set of 3 x 5 cards
referred to as a \'toolkit\'.

Miles from anywhere on the way to a sheep station, a gasket blew in our car
and we suddenly weren\'t going anywhere.  An industrious Indonesion managed
to fix it temporarily by punching a hole in one of the cards of just the
right shape and size to get us there and back.

The \'toolkit\' designer was not impressed with what we\'d done to his
precious cards when we told him later.

See, those Traveller characters aren\'t so unusual after all....

In a similar vein, there was this guy who wrote computer code to do
"something" and he decided he wanted to make it smaller.  What the code
actually did is unimportant.  
So this guy wrote crazy software and turned the code into "artificial life"
with certain rules.  After a certain amount of time the code would "die" they
could mate and produce offspring, and the offspring would have a chance of
random mutation.  The mutation would make the code smaller.  The code would
"die" quickly if it didn\'t do what the original code did.

What eventually happened was, after many iterations, the code became ultra
teeny, but still did what it was programmed to do.  He sponsored a contest on
the internet and alot of people tried to write a program that did the same
thing, only smaller, and nobody came close.

This is in the book _Out of Control_.  I forget the author\'s name off the top
of my head, but it is a fantastic book.  I can get the name of the author if
anyone would like.  The book deals with artificial life and robotics and
various things like that.  Very good read.

I think evolving chips is fantastic, and I think it could make the computer
industry grow even faster then it is now (what, my computer will be obselete
even quicker? :).

As I\'ve stated in another message, I think that Traveller tech is highly
conservative in alot of respects.

IIRC, this puts them in a better position than the Solomani were when they

So *THAT\'S* why the kids have been missing! (And I thought it was because I
didn\'t have any -- obviously the evil gearheads have used their mind-clouding
abilities to remove my memories of them!)

Actually, I have nothing against Scientific Calculators (I actually own a
moderately good one, a Sharp EL-5120 programmable -- I just objected to the
stupidly overly (and needlessly) complex system of FF&S which, when used to
attempt to reverse engineer real world designs, simply didn\'t come close most of
the time. GURPS Vehicles had a similar problem, but was so much simpler to use
that it could be worked around -- GV2 has removed that problem, but made the
system too complex to be usable.

The system I use now? Well, I use BTRC\'s VDS (Vehicle Design System), which is a
little beauty ... sure, you need a scientific calculator to use it, but it is
really not all that much more complex than "High Guard" when you boil it down.
And, best of all, the design sequence flows smoothly and logically -- *and* you
*can* reverse engineer vehicles using the system and get accurate (or close to)
real world results!

Actually, I didn\'t say anything else that you commented on -- so blame the
originator of those other comments, not *me*!

I believe that Hard currency is necessary in a traveller universe for =

But, in the traveller universe it would be impossible to maintain =

Archduke Norris (the former Duke of Regina) ordered a quarntine running
across the middle of Deneb.  Residents on the wrong side of the line had a
very short period to pick up and move.  *Nothing* that could harbor Virus
was allowed in with the refugess.  Ships were stopped and had their
computers checked with a fine tooth comb while the Navy stood by at point
blank range.

Once the grace period ended, nothing moved across the border.  Any attempt
to enter Regency space was considered hostile.  One Vampire Fleet did
penetrate, with a single battleship making it to Trin where it massacred
much of the planet\'s population before suiciding onto the planet\'s surface.

At the time of the Regency Sourcebook, preperations were underway to allow
settlers across the buffer zone to begin reclaiming the previously lost
worlds.

	Everybody\'s going to give you their gearhead reason, or canon
reason, or whatever. Here\'s my take:

	The reason Traveller isn\'t more like {Star Wars, Star Trek,
Battlestar Galactica, Blood Music, Neuromancer, ...}, and doesn\'t
include technology like {Teleportation, Nanotek, Shields,
Phasers, Warp Drive, Neural Jacks, ...} is because Traveller
isn\'t {Star Wars, Star Trek, Battlestar Galactica, Blood Music,
Neuromancer, ...}.

	Marc Miller, et. al., were looking for a specific feel; even the
very first Traveller had a very "hard-science" feel.  Go back &
reread the space combat rules in the original LBB if you don\'t
buy that ... Having set that feel, it\'s been propagated forward,
until the entire fabric of what Traveller is formed. Start
throwing in other things, and you\'ll tear the fabric. Maybe you
can make something else out of the shreds, but it won\'t be
Traveller ...

Sure, nanotechnology won\'t work in gaming, it\'s just *too* odd, but 
genetic engineering, biological and cybernetic implants, massively 
networked computers which exist in *every* device made are all ideas 
which have been used in SF literature for more than a decade, and which 
have been used in at least a few games.  Traveller could be updated.  
Digest Groups was doing this, they even had a cyborg book and a genetic 
engineering book planned, the TNE came along, followed by T4 and the 
technology of the Imperium has been left stagnating in 60s SF-land.

So, maybe we all can remedy this?

These weren\'t written for Traveller, but with a little work they
might be applied to it.

The first is a mapping tool which I originally wrote for fantasy
RPGing, but I got to thinking that it might be useful for Traveller
as well, particularly for regional maps (a section of a planet)
where a particular adventure or set of adventures are located.

        PROGRAM NAME: "MAPPER" [v0.1] {December 1997}
        AUTHOR: Jim Vassilakos (jimv@empirenet.com)
        FUNCTION: World Mapper
        OPERATING SYSTEM: IBM (MS-DOS)
        SIZE: 318,730 bytes zipped
        COMMENTS: Create maps with hexagonal color-tiles so you
              can share your RPG campaign world with the rest of
              us on the Net. Requires VGA graphics or better. May
              attach campaign notes to the map via an easy-to-learn
              menuing system. Two unfinished sample worlds already
              included. Note, you must use "-d" option when unzipping:
              >>>>>>>>    pkunzip -d mapper01.zip    <<<<<<<<
        If you draw up any campaign maps using this program, please
        send me a copy so I can include them in the next version...

The second one is a language program originally written to help me
pick up some greek, but I suddenly got to thinking that maybe the
people on the vilani-list might want to revise the data files
to their own nefarious ends... include it as part of a tutorial
in the vilani language, although this might require actual code
modification... i don\'t know vilani at all, so i can\'t say...

        PROGRAM NAME: "LANG" [v1.0] {December 1997}
        AUTHOR: Jim Vassilakos (jimv@empirenet.com)
        FUNCTION: Language Learner (Greek Version)
        OPERATING SYSTEM: IBM (MS-DOS)
        SIZE: 66,368 bytes zipped
        COMMENTS: Learn greek at your own pace via this
           flashcard program. You enter the words you want
           to learn (up to 500), then quiz yourself with both
           recall and recognition tests. Includes an uncompiled
           font editor to facilitate with the creation of other
           language files. All data files are flat-text for
           easy manual editing.

Anyway, just spamming the list with this gunk on the off-chance that
it might prove useful to somebody... both programs currently available
from my homepage:

          http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~jimv

Just go to the programs section and snoop around... and if you have
trouble getting one or the other for whatever bizarre reason, let me
know and I\'ll send you a copy via email.

     Okay, the Traveller\'s Writer\'s List is up and apparently running.

      To subscribe send a message to:

subscribe hiwg-twg-digest <youraddress>

      for the digest version or

subscribe hiwg-twg <youraddress>


       Membership is restricted to former and would be Traveller Writer\'s.
The list is only for work on Traveller related projects (articles,
sourcebooks, etc....). Kibitzers can join the list on a temporary (6-month)
basis at the invititation of a writer.
        Would be Writer\'s need to submit an article for discussion (or an
outline of a sourcebook or adventure book they would like to work on). In
return you get a temporary membership (roughly 6 months), and useful input on
your work.
        A form of Nettiquette will be enforced on the list and discussions
should relate to useful material to Traveller (in any form) with the purpose
of getting published.
        This list is sponsored by History of the Imperium Working Group, it\'s
SIG, The Traveller Writer\'s Group and with thanks to Derek Wildstar for
providing a site.

Can I join based on existing body of work?  I\'m already behind on my MoS
adventure, and don\'t have time to rough something else out.

human errors that we created when trying to restore the drive.  We had
never restored a full drive before and it was a learning lesson.  I am
blessed that we haven\'t had to do that before and I\'m glad the software
worked well to do it.  Its unfortunate that we had to face the learning
curve in the middle of a crisis.

Our first priority was to get our web server back in operation, since that
is our method of getting paying customers and permits us to provide this
free service.  

I am sending this message out for two reasons (well three really):

1.  I want to apologize for the outage.  I can\'t say this will never happen
again, but if it does, we will be more educated in how to fix it faster.

2.  I want to test the lists to make sure they work (and announce to you
they are back up, I think)

3.  Backups last occurred on Friday before the crash.  Any messages still
in the mail queue were lost.  Any digests produced after Friday are not in
the archive and will not be delivered.   There is a very good possibility
that some of the digests that are bursting now will be duplicates of those
already scene.  I don\'t know of a way to fix this one.

To the List admins, I don\'t know if the alias changes I made last week got
recorded or not, so some admin traffic may be directed to the wrong place,
but I think we are ok there.

they aren\'t already down).  These are;

My personal site (known as Scott Galliand\'s Traveller Site)  at
http://members.aol.com/sgalli5794/Traveller/
Geonee Online Sourcebook at
http://members.aol.com/sgalli5794/Traveller/geonee/
and the Neworld Sector at http://members.aol.com/sgalli5794/Traveller/Neworld/

The reason for this is that I am moving them to another site.  This will
give me some time to rework the site a little bit more and hopefully add
some stuff, particularly some graphics so the sites won\'t look so bland.  

For those of you who are kind enough to have links to my site (BTW,
thanks), you may want to temporarily remove them for a short time.  I don\'t
know how long the AOL sites will stay in existence.

If all goes according to plan, I\'ll try to have the latest version of the
sites on line by mid-January (I hope) at their new home at Illuminati
Online (http://www.io.com/).  In the mean time, if you need something in
particular from me, please feel free to email me and I\'ll try to get it out
to you.  Please remember that its the holiday season and we\'re all busy.
If you haven\'t heard from me in a few days, drop me a line again so I\'ll
keep it in the queue.

I apologize for anyone\'s inconvenience in this, and I\'ll try to get it back
in working order soon.

Thanks.

There is a simple solution, though it plays hell with entropy and
potential energy - create some handwave that explains why the rock does not
gather as much kinetic energy as it should.  Depending on the quality of
your handwave, you can have all sorts of results.

My personal favorite is that the thruster plate drive actually reduces the
inertial mass of an object, and that it is the reduced inertial mass which
is so easy to move.  This works fine in most cases, but leads to two
questions:

1.  What if the drive fails - does all of your velocity vanish?

2.  What happens if they move outsystem, such that the potential energy
increases?  They can then drop back into the system, and pick up a bunch of
kinetic energy.

My solutions are as follows:

1.  All thruster drives are coupled to one or two massive bodies.  As a
result, any momentum transfer problems are turned into action at a distance
problems.  These are resolved by the same relativity damper that is used on
jump drives. :)

2.  Drive failure causes rapid deceleration as the drive field decays.
This would change the travel formulas, as people would just cut the drive
to decelerate.  By making this catastrophically wearing on the drive,, you
can keep the old travel formulas.

3.  Movement to higher or lower gravitational potential energies is limited
by the drive input power.  I also use this for contragrav - CG is
conservative, such that the energy you put in to reach orbit can, in
general, be used to descend to ground level again, leaving only the actual
work done in applying a force over a distance as lost energy.

Anyone who wants to check my physics in the game is allowed to, and if they
find a big hole, they get player cookies if they fix it, which is why we
have the "action at a distance" rule at all.

This also means that thruster plates are just great for a jump in system,
or for scooting around the system at relatively low velocities, but they
are not perfect for shoving rocks (or ships) at great speed.

Designers can protect a system against all kinds of threats, and may add
configurability for usability reasons, but if they miss an application of
usability for security breaking, then they have a hole, and one which may
not be easily fixable.  EEPROMS, for example, are terribly convenient,
unless they can be used to make the system un fixable without a soldering
iron.

Note: I witnessed the following event personally.

At work, we had a technical problem with one of our programs on one version
of the IBM ValuePoint that could only be fixed by downloading a new BIOS
updater disk.

IBM released a version of the BIOS that fixed the flaw by disabled the fpu.

Some chap "fixed" it by modifying the IBM version to only disable part of
the fpu.  Unfortunately, his patch prevented all future BIOS updates from
working, and made the computer fail, because it wrote junk to a low memory
address after every write.

Once his evil software ran, the computer would crash occasionally, and it
would not accept a new BIOS updater.  (This was an error on his part - he
corrupted the BIOS version check code.)  To fix it, you had to crack the
case, and physically remove the chip.  Regrettably, it was not socketed, so
IBM had to send a new motherboard out.  Even if I had been willing to use a
soldering iron, IBM did not stock replacement EEPROMS.  They claimed that
what had happened was not possible.

It was possible to fix the problem, but that the people designing the
system had never considered the particular attack method which ended up
being used, and thus the technique of ripping out the EEPROM became time
consuming and expensive.  Compare that to a virus on my hard drive, which
cannot do that.  My current computer does not have any user addressable
parts that can be dynamically reconfigured to the point of needed a
soldering iron to fix them.  Thus, this bit of configuration software had a
gaping flaw.  It is not hard for me to imagine a very subtle one that
required a stroke of pure luck to exploit.

Note further, this problem could have been prevented by simply not putting
the EEPROM erase code and disk access code in the EEPROM that can be
updated.  They screwed up, but in a way that required a very fine knowledge
of the boot ROM code, the update process, and the system services available
to take advantage of.

Now, assume three "facts" about the so-called virus.

1.  It had been specifically trained to attack Imperial systems, and
probably had access to all the 3I knew about alien systems.

2.  The designers had some seriously reconfigurable systems out there,
especially on warships.  They also had security, but, much like IBM with
this ValuePoint, there was a back door that they had not considered

3.  On many systems, the Virus was capable of putting itself in places
that, in theory, could not hold such a thing.  In other words, the EEPROMS
out there were large enough to hold the Virus.

Sure, there were probably "reset and dump from backup" programs out there,
but for whatever reason, the Virus was small enough to fit in places which
they did not hit.  As a real life example, do you have a backup of your
system ROMs?  Usually not, because they are not available, and are not
modifiable anyway.

My favorite Traveller example - on the control panels of most ships, there
is a large file of ship systems and addresses that the panel might need to
talk to, stored locally.  Secret information can be put in there, because
these panels generally have a lot of free storage room.

I do think there is a problem with it making anything much below TL14 self
aware, because that makes the "AI is TL 17" rule less sensible, but this is
a different argument.

NB, I do not like the Virus for game play reasons, which is why I do not
use it, but the core idea of a secret war weapon computer virus that could
infect high tech systems and infiltrate in a malicious way does not seem
out of line.

This is a truth, and affects all game designers.  Unfortunately, unless you
provide a consistent background, players have trouble reacting, and if you
do, then you run that risk.  My game, like many here, has this a lot,
because all of use are computer types, and we have two physicists and two
mathematicians playing, thus they are very good at working the system.

Referring to another thread, this is why I kind of like the technological
conservativism in Traveller - it makes it possible to keep things under
some level of control.  I have a small chance of guessing what people are
going to use the cool tech for.

Last week I assembled a categorized index from data 
submitted by 8 or 9 folks with Traveller web pages.
I believe the resulting pages have been placed on a
website, but over the weekend I have felt some
misgivings about my method.

By compiling data submitted I am creating a bottleneck
and administrative overhead which isn\'t necessary and
should be automatic.

Glenn\'s suggestion is to contain keywords in our
Traveller pages, thus automatically creating searchable
indices for any web browser.  I suggest that method be
tried, since it has the advantages of being automatic,
distributed, and searchable.

All you have to do is add the category names to your
Traveller pages, as META tags (for example).  I suppose
the keywords might also have to be in the page title
or header, yes?

There might be one hurdle.  We might have to decide on
category names.  However, I hope this won\'t really be
much of a problem.

Opinions, suggestions?

   Great minds think alike!  I\'ve always held that Trav maneuver drives
   must conserve energy, and I\'ve long noted that the only way for that
   to be true is if (a) you increase the power requirements by a factor
   of 1000 or so, or (b) you state that the maneuver drive somehow
   magically decouples energy from velocity, so that E = m*v^2/2 does not
   hold anymore.

   Yeah, simple conservation of energy tells you that Trav power-plants
   cannot accelerate rocks to the kind of energies that planet killers
   need in a finite amount of time. And yet Trav rules tell you that you
   can accelerate the rocks to very high speed.  So you have an
   inconsistency unless you postulate some magic M-drive that lets energy
   be independent of momentum; something that takes a macroscopic object
   `off of the mass shell\', that makes your near-c planetoid a `virtual\'
   rock that actually has very little energy, similar to the way
   quantum-mechanical virtual particles have incompatible momentum and
   energy.
   
   Such a drive would take its place along side jump, gravitics, and
   psionics as unexplainable Trav magic. (Well, perhaps Jordy could make
   it explainable it terms of multi-phasic tachyon fields fed through the
   deflector screens or transporter. 8^)
   
   I haven\'t worked out any off the details you brought up yet.  I\'ve
   found simple hand waving and fiats enough to stave off most of my
   players wild energy-violating schemes.

Good point -- I missed that.  Do you think we could use ridged surfaces
for radiators?  The ridges are angled 45 degrees to the plane of the hull,
90 degrees to one another (or more, to account for diffracted rays).  All
the ridge planes that don\'t have a normal line intersecting some other
part of the ship can be used for radiators.  If the hull is carefully
designed (by our Imperial architect characters), we will not have any
wastage of the bonus area gained from the ridges.

We can probably get away with only one fin in many cases, if the ridge
technique can be used.  Other convolutions (narrowing, elongation,
flattening) can also be used, either alone or in conjunction with the
ridge technique, although I would not go so far as to modify the hull
length formula.  We could come up with a pretty simple standard formula
for increased surface area based on the geometry of the ridges, assuming
they are used to replace a "flat" hull region of arbitrary dimensions.  Or
we could just "fudge" it, to account for infinite variation in ridge size.

Since the mounting of battle riders does not involve the dissipation of
energy, this restriction should not apply to them, or to other similar
applications.  It still poses a problem for weapons and sensors, though,
especially since these emitters want to reach as large a spatial volume as
possible (i.e. ridges and most other convolutions won\'t fix them).  If we
want to make a rule, I suggest that it state that area for weapons and
sensors must come from the ship\'s area according to the original formula,
while expanded area can be used for everything else.

Did I miss any other active emitter types that have the same requirements
as weapons and sensors? 

Thanks for replying to my post.

  From at least Signal GK, the intelligent chips are based on Terran hardware
of the 7IW. I wonder if they\'re entitled to veterans benefits? The Virus chips
are designed to predate Imperial chips.

  It\'s quite possible that not everyone agreed. IIRC, there are some points

  I agree with the first two statements, but the last seems to be based on
something other than a recent reading of the material. It happens that my
problems with MT/TNE don\'t include Virus. The mindsets of the people who
developed it in the background (NI, etc.), however...

	Well, the idea makes a hell of a lot of sense to me.  I have a hard
time that something like the aliens, which are so perfectly adapted to
eradicating pesky infestations of humans, could have evolved like that on
their own.  For example:

	Facehuggers are very good at doing precisely that; they\'re built to
grab on to human-sized heads, wrap their tails around human-sized and
placed throats to exert pressure (not all species might put their
respiratory tracts in the same place) on the bronchial tubes, to ram an
ovipositor down a human-placed mouth and throat, and feed a human oxygen.

	This is a little bit too close to design for comfort; either
something on the aliens\' homeworld was built just like humans, or the
aliens were designed...

	Then there\'s the fact that alien genetics are so close to humans
(and dogs) that they can splice DNA together; the chest-burster/adult
aliens are based at least in part upon their hosts (rottweilers, humans),
and Ripley v.8.0/Alien v.2.0.  I have a real hard time buying evolutionary
convergence on this one.

	Likewise the fact that the aliens are sized just right for human
spacecraft ventilation ducts :).

	As I\'ve said, were I writing the script for them next one, we\'d all
find out that the aliens were bioweapons, and annoyed at their failure,
their designers were working on a replacement; Tamagotchis :).
