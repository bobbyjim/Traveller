I rather expect that worlds will be in some sort of "master" file.
Possibly one per sector or subsector. You\'ll have all the
"non-standard" data in this record, and just an index to let you look
it up by some key (hex+orbit+???).

My approach has been to assign sectors co-ordinates based on Core =
(0,0). I\'ve got a file listing all known sector names with a field for
co-ordinates, and another for which language the name is. I think I put
subsectors in there too.

Well, all that "really" involves is a different format for
co-ordinates, and a different "adjacent sector" algorithm.

Several Oregon cities are having to switch from well water to treating
water from the Willamette river. And folks are *not* happy about it. 

Personally, I\'d like to enforce Heinlein\'s solution to river pollution
on them (which, btw could easily be done all over the US by a simple
Presidential order). *Require* that anybody dumping waste into a river
or stream obtain their water from *downstream* of the outlet. 

Apparently several Scandanavian countries have this rule or something
like it. It works *far* better than typical limits on pollution because
suddenly it\'s in the *polluter\'s* best interest to clean up the
discharge as much as possible. :-)

    'body' => 'I thought I would throw some more questions hoping for either canon
information or information/discussion from peoples campaigns.

What is jump space and how does it work/ how do jump drives work.

Please excuse any poor terminology for this is not my field.

I often envision jumpspace as a hyperspace topology that you can lie the
normal 3 dimensional (3+?) on the surface of so that every point in the
universe corresponds with a point on the surface of jumpspace in much the
same way as you can wrap a two dimensional surface around a sphere.  With
this view a jump breaks the surface tension between universes/spaces and
projects you on a vector through jumpspace.  Your ship then follows its
course until it reached the exit-point back into the normal universe.  Tides
within jumpspace create small variances in travel time but the basic trip
takes about a week.  Stronger jump drives let you cut a deeper curve though
jumpspace and thereby exit you a further distance from your entry point.
Jump drives use a preset that corresponds to a known-safe angle of incidence
with jumpspace and when this is changed it results in a mis-jump.  The
trajectory and relative velocity through jumpspace is different and causes a
different passage length in both time and distance.  Typically a jump drive
consumes all of its fuel in opening the tear into jumpspace and initiating
the ship on its trajectory.  The drive then shuts down and the ship
essentially coasts through jumpspace until it reaches the other end point of
its trajectory and breaks the surface tension back into our universe.  The
physics of jumpspace being different from our universe normal reaction
thrusters or gravitic drives are useless in jumpspace.  One danger in this
is the chance of a collision between 2 ships in jumpspace, or the possible
collision with some other object either indigenous to jumpspace it another
visitor.

Another model for jump-drives I have used is a space-folding type mechanism.
A true spacefold should be close to instantaneous unless the universe has to
suspend the existence of the ship to balance a conservation of
energy/reality type function and in that case I have trouble justifying
passengers on the ship experiencing this time and consuming supplies etc.
Instead I see the jump drive creating a jumpspace tunnel between two points
in the universe down which the ship is propelled.  Stronger jump drives
create a longer tunnel and propels the ships down the tunnel faster so they
always cross the distance in about a week.  Speed through the tunnel is
subjective to the space of the tunnel so it has no effect on the speed and
direction of the ship before/after it makes the jump.  I could see the drive
either using all its fuel and coasting down the tunnel with whatever
relativistic speed was imparted at the point of jump, or the drive
continually working on maintaining and stabilizing the tunnel.  In the later
view it allows for a drive malfunction to cause either a collapse in the
tunnel (either destroying it or flinging it back into some point in the
normal universe (Or possibly another)) or to cause the tunnels end/exit
point to drift thereby altering the destination and the length of the tunnel
and changing the time in transit.  This model has the effect of isolating
ships effectively in their own universe (Unless fleets are allowed to
somehow link their drives).  This keeps away from the possibility  of
collisions.

I have a few other ideas floating in my head but this is all I will subject
the list to in this post.  Please feel free to pick apart these ideas
anywhere you like.

Is everyone missing the obvious, or did I not see another poster?

The disposable AT-GL-6 or AT-GL-7.  At pen 36 or 31 (MT stats are all I
have), any reasonable BD is toast (well, except maybe GT).  The best MT BD
is armor of 18, well within the capability of these cheap little toys.
Don\'t forget that the TL15 versions will have a penetration of around 50.
Sure, a PDL might be able to take them down, but in an urban fight, ranges
will be close and angles confused.  If the PDLs are too effective, switch to
panzerwurfermines, probably manufacturable at TL5, with equal penetration.
As they are hand thrown, they might either be ignored by the PDL, or at
least make it easier to overload.

The same is true of Hisotorians vs the rest of the world.. as the
differences in the value of the terms Myth and  Legend definitions on list
shows. Hostorical jargon differs (often to direct contradiction) with
Archeological, anthropological, and Paleological jargon often.... Each
science seems to be developing into sub-languages these days (Working in
the Mental Health Field, but being a trained historian with some experience
in Archival Science, I am literally having to completely revise my working
language... Making the MH community able to understand me has been a
challenge.).

And other fields get worse, too. Medicine and Law use Latin phrases as
english... history often redefines terms from common useage into much more
narrowly defined terms. Astronomy has terms for things that the common man
hardly even grasps.

Ad such jargons often have written expression patterns which cause
problems, for example, it is common in Geography (my minor) to all-caps any
term being defined in prose. Especially when bold is not an option.

They have special troops for dealing with it.  They\'re call the Zhodani.

Other options:  
Hit soft targets, where battle dress troops aren\'t present.
Use hostages.
Use a bigger tank.
Advance in the opposite direction, then nuke them.
Steal some sets of battle dress from one of the Vargr worlds that can match
Imperial technology.  If you\'re really desperate, buy it.

I suspect you\'re thinking of \'Day of the Morons\'. Any sort of

Is that a basic limitation or can we expect that to improve with TL? 

You probably have a few hours when docking with x-boats, but not when launching
them.

[Perhaps my tongue-in-cheek "shrink wrap" alternative was not that far from the

Density of air at sea level is about 1/800th the density of water (from
Encarta). [You probably don\'t need sea level density in any case and could get
away with a lot thinner].

So one litre of water will generate enough oxygen for 3400 litres of air
[8/9*800/0.209] or around four litres of water per Displacement ton at 21%
oxygen. Less if you go with lower pressure. That is small in my book.

[I believe modern submarines routinely use electrolysis of water for replacement
oxygen.]

The spare Nitrogen you may have to take tanked at high pressure. I bet that is
nowhere near as small unless you can store it at ten thousands pounds per square
inch.

I was afraid of that but wasn\'t sure if it was safer/lighter/cheaper to carry
pressurised nitrogen or a liquid source, say ammonia solution NH4-OH. You could
electrolyse out the nitrogen and oxygen together - and tank or discard the
excess oxygen. You would need about thirty three litres per DT of air. 

I was trying to explore alternative inert components so that I could identify a
suitable liquid source.

[Any submariners on the list know what subs use?]

Four litres of water and a large tank of nitrogen OR 33 litres of ammonia
solution. Not too bad.

I agree it is important to keep losses to a minimum. I was trying to identify
the best sources for replacement.

On an x-boat tender you have that handy cargo deck you could use to store the
air, at only a few atmospheres, most ships have something similar. You could
just increase pressure slightly in the rest of the ship.

Huh? The total amount of air in the ship is the same regardless of whether the
bay is in vacuum or not. The total number of people breathing atmosphere wont
change (much). So the toxin removal, CO2 removal, oxygen replacement
requirements wont change. Yes you have to pump air to more places as I said.

Presumably you have emergency pressure seals in all other sections of the ship
too.

This is standard traveller tech. Is it that difficult/expensive?

I thought we had already determined that trav ships have a heat problem and that
they can dump heat efficiently (using near magical radiators) :-)

Hi Loren.

I\'ve just had a quick flick through some of the books I have sitting beside
me.  There are some canon layouts in various adventures.  Most of the maps
are pretty sketchy, and they only seem to be downports.  

Here are some references:
\'The Traveller Adventure\':  Leedor/Aramis.  The map of Leedor has starport
pads marked.  
\'Mission on Mithril\':  Mithril.  Very small.
\'Night of Conquest\':  Airship port used presumably \'as required\'.

I vaguely recall some others.  At least some of them are really just
airports.  Unfortunately I haven\'t got time to check.

\'Tarsus\' and \'Beltstrike\' seem likely places to look.  I\'m also sending
this post to the TML, so maybe someone could check.

I hope this is useful.

Typically, within a city on a world high-tech enough to have both grav
vehicles and mass traffic, grav traffic is slaved to computer control. The
vehicle\'s computer links up with city traffic control and the computer
does the rest.  Which gives us some interesting disaster scenarios if the
computer gives out at a bad moment, but hey, this is roleplaying--without
disasters, catastrophes, and poorly-timed malfunctions, it\'d be boring!

This depends a lot on what planet you are on. High-population worlds,
densely populated with a lot of traffic, will probably have regular routes
established, with some form of automated air-traffic control. On a
frontier world with a population of 500, you can pretty much swing your
air/raft however you like it, since there just isn\'t that much else flying
around for you to hit.

Law level is also a factor: low-law worlds are less likely to object
strenuously to someone flying outside the lines, while a high-law world
might routinely take down errant pilots with AA laser batteries for flying
Where They Should Not Be.

It\'s not really. Over the course of time, the use of the term myth has
mutated, but it\'s not really jargon. In the mid-1800s when the study of
folklore was started in earnest, those were the generally accepted
definitions of the terms myth and legend. Legend has remained the same in
general use. Most of the online dictionaries I checked as a test support the
"folklorist\'s jargon" for legend. Myth is defined in a couple of them as a
false story that is accepted as truth, but then they follow it up with a
short version of the " folklorist\'s jargon" definition.

Urban, when it serves as a prefix to legend has a very specific meaning in
the jargon of folklorists, and it is from this use that the popular use
derives. As a result, they are one in the same. Brunvand himself kept trying
to come up with a new definition as he felt that "urban legend" was too
narrow a definition that gave people the wrong idea.

<ObTrav>: Has the Third Imperium begun studying its own folklore? I\'m sure
that there are groups studying the folklore of individual worlds. That goes
without saying. Have they realized yet that folklore is everchanging and
exists in some form or another all the way to the Imperial Palace?

Actually, I\'ve always felt that the White Dwarf article by Thomas M Price
entitled "Happy Landings - Starport Design in Traveller" was and remains
the ultimate (to date) resource for the Imperial starport. Although not
\'officially\' canon, and only a three pages in length, the article contains
a wealth of information on the design of starports. In addition the article
features eight detailed diagrams of typical Imperial starports ranging from
Class A all the way down to Class E. I don\'t have the issue number handy,
but can look it up if anyone is interested.

Leonard,

Dealing with cryos for my past work places, the hard rules are:

If the liquid gas is not actively being pressurized and temperatures being 
actively maintained, it will have to vented constantly. None of the above 
then you have a container rupture in time. The time depends of the cross 
sectional area of the gas container versus the temp around the container.

As for the perfect insulator that you have mentioned well it brings up many 
issues. With the heat that the ship\'s power will generate even a 99% 
efficient insulator, will have the cryos changing states.

   At the risk of cracking open a 100 liter barrel full of worms, there was
nothing blurred about Clinton/Lewinsky except the spin control/payoffs to
liberal Democratic Party members that the White House put out--the same
sort of spin control/payoffs to liberal Democratic Party members that has
been in effect since Jan. 20, 1992.  Even people who commit suicide in
their own office (Vince Foster) are not beyond the spin machine...

   In game terms, I can think of a number of instances where spin control
and general manipulation of the media would come into play:

1) The Interstellar Wars - I can just see the Terran recruiting posters
now, waring of the \'Villani\' (deliberate mispelling so that it appears more
like the word \'Villian\') menace.  Comparisons made between the red found
prominently featured in Vilani color schemes and the red of the Communists
of the 20th century.  Comparisons made to the Borg, the Nazis, and Gaia
knows what else.

2) Second Imperium - Propaganda pieces dedicated to making the latest
emperor look more noble, better fit, and all around semi-deity like as
possible an emperor as possible so that the populace will bow down before
them.  Forget the fact that Carlos XII took the throne after poisoning his
father, and that his father took the throne after killing the empress after
a staff meeting...

3) Third Imperium - Government propaganda early on extolls the virtues of
being part of the growing Imperium, how so many worlds have benefitted from
the truly benevolent rule of his/her Highness.  Later pieces would extoll
the virtues as exemplified by certain nobles--their benevolent (absolute)
rule, and their complete and total loyalty to the emperor.

4) Solomani Confederation - Shows the Third Imperium as a place of absolute
dictatorship, where people are persecuted merely for being a member of the
Solomani Party and extolling the supremacy of Terran blood over that of
aliens and inferior human transplants to other worlds.  Solsec is only
protecting us from evil.  Please disregard the cameras, they are there for
your protection.  We only need your genetic samples for our files so that
we can protect you better.  We need to know what you buy and when you have
large sums of money so we can protect you.  You need identity papers so
that we can track your movements so we can protect you.  Firearms are evil
and you need protected from them.  We have guns and you don\'t because you
need protected...

   Sorry, reality slipping in there....

Harold

  Not an engineering problem, but cost may not be worth it, at least to a
lot of OTU societies. Again, this refers to docking hangars/bays, not to
the actual ships themselves.

  I know at least one fellow who starts foaming at the mouth at the phrase
"mere engineering" (although it makes wargaming simpler by distracting him).
It appears that SF gamers (and arm-chair historians, esp. military) either
aren\'t aware of or don\'t choose to acknowledge the fact that engineering 
problems are vastly more serious than theoreticians - let alone laymen - 
tend to indicate.

  I can accept that. I don\'t see that a Type S will be built with pumps to
handle more than the 20-odd Dt of working space it has, let alone whatever
size of docking bay it happens to be in.

  I can accept that interior hangars can be evacuated to tanks, and that
15 minutes would be a safe ballpark for standard OTU hardware. Needless
to say, clipping ships to an exterior and running connectors will be far
simpler (and _much_ cheaper) in most cases.

  FWIW, the cheapest space station hangars - in fact, probably the only
really economically viable ones - will be hollowed out rocks :>

  One of the few decent books that David Drake put his name on as a
minor contributor went into great detail on this idea - the major 
protagonist was essentially a news massager/middle manager in a very
bad place at a very bad time. A little too lethal for most Trav games...

Knightfall has a detailed downport, but regardless of the cover is DGP\'s (?) :(
Dragon #59 had both a down and high (hitech, hi-pop; 1 billion Dt!) port in 
the Exonidas Starport (?) article. Pretty well done, IMHO.

 Someone could fake up a port or two from the "Exit Visa" (TB, p.141) or
"Stranded on Arden" descriptions and art.

 I wonder if Edwards AFB can be used as a sample of a low-rated port? :)

I don\'t want to start a platform war, but I\'m sure it would be very useful
to  make the program available on as many different platforms as possible.

Would you consider writing it in one of the cross-platform development
frameworks that build on Win32, Mac OS, and Unix? There are free or open
source ones like wxWindows (http://www.wxwindows.org) and YAAF
(http://www.pandawave.com/yaaf/). These are both C++, though.

With all due respect, your comments have very little to do with the kind of
blurring of reality and fiction in the media that the previous posters were
talking about.

The truth of the matter, whether anybody likes to admit it or not, is that
the news media is just another branch of the media, whose primary interest
is keeping people watching. People don\'t care whether what\'s on the tube is
true or false, as long as it\'s entertaining.

This has nothing to do with "liberal Democratic payoffs" or any such thing.
It\'s all about ratings, and it\'s all about what keeps people watching. I
know that my boss and coworkers didn\'t get their payoffs from the White
House to keep watching, just as Johnny Cochran didn\'t pay them to sit and
discuss the O.J. Simpson case around the lunch table. If something is
interesting and entertaining, people will watch, and advertisers will keep
advertising.

<ObTrav>: In the Third Imperium, it\'s entirely likely things will be even
crazier than modern America due to the massive corporate power in the
Imperium and its focus on trade. I can easily imagine shows like Mercs, in
which film crews follow around mercenary crews, filming their exploits.

Also, as the technology of video manipulation gets more and more refined,
there could very well be interesting consequences. After all, it could be
easy to, say, hang a computer generated gigolo off the arm of a prominent
Baroness. The list literally goes on and on. It may not hold up in an
Imperial court of law, but that won\'t stop the news media of the Third
Imperium.

What would *help* is if somebody had it, scanned it, & put it on the net 
someplace with the appropriate cites & acknowledgements.  <grin>

I\'ll check my stash, but I\'m out a scanner at the moment.

Just an update on the post I sent you earlier.

Some of what I \'remembered\' was probably TNE stuff, or from licencees.  I
may even be thinking of some of my own (*definitely* not canon) material. 

However, \'Beltstrike\' seems to have a map of Koenig\'s Rock, a planetoid
with a lot of starport/startown sevices.  I\'ve only got the text handy -
the map is in storage.  It might be a good basis for a high-port, though.

There could still be other material, particularly in Challenge, but most of
my collection is in storage.

 Along that line, of cannon writers getting involved... has any ever
explained where the Annic Nova originated from?  What race, what sector,
etc.  Has any on the list done any detective work to come-up with facts
others have overlooked to determine this information?

Yes, I got a free copy of POV-ray with an Adobe product I bought and am
feeling exactly the same way... and this good stuff being touted lately sure
has been inspiring!  But is POV-ray any good for this stuff (advice to us
Jesse?)?

That sounds familiar... I was sure fatalities were reported on Nine News,
but you are closer to what happened than what I am, so I bow to that.  I do
recall the oyster thing almost killing that industry because of the deaths.
Thanks Robert.

I don\'t think the chance to see good graphics is a waste of bandwidth.  In
my opinion, your pics don\'t have to be hot 3D either, someone doing good
pencil, or ink, or coloured format illustrations would be welcome look-ins
too... many people can only imagine what certain things look like in a game
setting and cannot put an image "on paper" so others can see, and that is a
gift.

Keep up the good work, practice should see improvement, and already your
imagination has given us nice "nose art" on scout couriers... something I
will probably incorporate in my future campaign as a "standard"

All copies of POV-Ray are free. That\'s part of the appeal.

If you want to see some POV-Ray examples, check my site at
http://www.pil.net/~semo/render/ for a few Traveller related examples. You
should probably track down a modeller to use. Check POV-Ray\'s site (easy to
find with most search engines).

In the winter of 1929, the city of Tacoma, Washington had a total power
outage and the carrier USS Lexington supplied the city with its entire
power needs for a month. And apparently, she wasn\'t working at full
capacity.

As amply demonstrated in "Bug Jack Barron" ( I think, or was it in a John
Brunner book ?)   where the hero is a media presenter who does just that,
takes rumours and provides video showing the rumour. In the Lewinsky case,
that would have involved showing the couple having oral sex on TV, whether
it happened or not

Howard Chaykin also explored this in "Amercan Flagg!" with episode titles
such as "VideoRangers" and "The Revolution will be Televised"

This example is actually quite analogous to what a fusion-powered
starship could do.  USS LEXINGTON, like several other US Navy capital
ships of the time, had a turbo-electric drive.  In other words, her
steam turbines were used to generate electricity, which then was used to
power electric motors for propulsion.

Traditional steam-turbine ships could not have provided nearly as much
electric power as "Lady Lex."

There\'s a bunch of variant history being written in my PBEM, but I won\'t go

Only during the organ bank era.  At that time, almost anyhting got you

Later, things changed.  Remember Beowulf\'s reaction to the racers on what\'s

In my Illuminated Traveller setting, Grandfather is waiting for one race or
the other to show that they will be suitable assistants/workers.  He\'s
partial to the Droyne (natch!), so he keeps giving them little boosts, like
the Coyn ceremony for casting, but they have been a major disappointment.

His pocket universe does have a different flow of time, and Grandfather
spends most of his time in a semi-comatose state, stirring every few
centuries to examine the state of the universe, and perhaps meddling a little.

In dead R\'yleah, dread Yaskodray lies dreaming... and the Stars are almost
right for his return!

(odd footnote: My spell checker choked on R\'yleah, and it\'s first
suggestion was Sylea! hmmm....)

In space, you have an unlimited supply of *hard* vacuum. Also, you have
access to a 3 Kelvin "heatsink". That\'s going to make maintaining cryo
temps *much* easier. 

You\'ll still have to work at it a bit, but it\'s got to be *lots*
simpler than in a planetary atmosphere.

If you can\'t afford one of the entry level programs (approximately $400-500
range) then you can still do decent work with it.  It\'s harder, AFAIK, to
make the textures appear more real.  The exception was the recent cutter
module by Chris.  That had the more detailed texturing that I\'ve ever seen
from PovRay.  If you start playing with it, you may want to talk to Chris
about how he did it.  It is extremely easy to create things like swoopy
little speeders, etc, that don\'t really need texturing.

Ah, the Skip-Tracer.  The one TNE campaign I enjoyed. Set in the Regency,
we played the crew of the Type S "Bofa", tracking down bad debts of all kinds.

I played a lawyer, Eneri Sedleman, Esq.  Had a lot of fun with him, since
he wasn\'t much on combat, but once we had the crew subdued, I\'d stride up,
open my briefcase, and start my lawyer rap.

Hit and run, use anti-tank weapons, use a lot of traps.  A good one would
be a pressure plate or pneumatic tube connected to the firing mechanism of
a light anti-tank weapon.  Set the threshold to a high enough weight so
that your own troops won\'t set it off, but the BD Trooper will.  He runs
down the alley, steps on the trigger, and WHOOSH-BANG.

The only other option is to do a fade.  Either the BD troopers will leave,
allowing other, easier to kill, troops to occupy the area, or eventually,
they\'ll take off their helmets to eat.  That\'s when your sniper, operating
a remote controlled AMR, fires.

That\'s the one. And there are two "identifiers" I can think of. First,

Second, that *damned* memory test.

Which is why Sun *sued* MS for violating the Java standard. Last I
heard was that they\'d won. MS has only two options (not counting
appeals). 

1. adhere to the standard
2. Call their "non-Java" something else. 

It should be *real* interesting to see which way they jump.

Good point. Except we don\'t *really* know that this is true except for

And right here you\'ve departed from reality. Woods *are* strong enough.
As an example, let me point out the infamous "Spruce Goose" which is
both the biggest plane ever built *and* made out of wood!

> "There could be light metals we haven\'t found yet."

Again, you\'ve just departed from reality. Physics did not exists AS A
SCIENCE until Newton (or maybe Galileo if you want to argue). Likewise,
chemistry started about the time that phlogiston was thrown out. And
Astronomy started wth Copernicus.

Sorry, but one of the ways to distinguish a field that is a science
from one that isn\'t is that for a science, any future theories have to
*include* present theories as "simplified theories" that work in the
range of conditions with which we are currently familar.

So, for example, *in spite* of Einstein, Newton\'s laws are still
perfectly valid. You just have to add a note that there are corrections
for speeds nears c and for intensely curved space. 

So hile we do not and CANNOT have absolute knowledge, we can (and do!)
know that we *do* know the rules that apply under conditions we are
familiar with. Any new rules have to miniscule effects under familiar
conditions and only have significant effects under *unfamiliar*
conditions. 

To put it another way, any new rules *have* to give the same results as
the old rules under familiar conditions, because if they didn\'t, then
they don\'t explain *why* we got those results under familiar
conditions. That ios, they\'d explain the *new* conditions, bt fail to
explain everyday conditions. Which is an immediate flunk for a theory.

So the fact that Newton\'s rules *replaced* Aristotle\'s, and
Copernicus\'s rules replaced Ptolemy\'s is *irrelevant. That\'s because
those are cases of a *non*-science "theory" (ones based on "this sounds
logical") being replaced by a scientific one ("we\'ve made measurements
and run tests, and these formulas describe the rules that seem to
apply") 

And as I noted we actually *do* have a pretty good idea of what the
maximum possible strength for materials are. It\'s set by the strength
of interatomic bonds. Which we\'ve been able to measure for at least 50
years. 

We\'re not there yet, and, in fact, it\'s not likely that any macroscopic
object *can* reach the limit set by bonding forces. But we are getting
rather close. 

If something requires a tensile strength *greater* than the bonding
forces between atoms, then you can\'t build it unless you can mess with
bonding forces. Which opens up a *huge* can of worms. 

So there\'s a lot less "wiggle room" than you may like to think.

My approach would be to have a file that goes by orbit position or some
such. Here\'s a "tabular" representation of such a file:

Orbit	sub	Name	  file
- ----   ----	----  ----
2	0	Mercury	  xxxx0200
3	0	Venus	  xxxx0300
4	0	Terra	  xxxx0400
4	1	Luna	  xxxx0401
5	0	Mars	  xxxx0500
5	1	Phobos	  xxxx0501
5	2	Deimos 	  xxxx0502
6	0	Ceres	  xxxx0600
6	1	Pallas	  xxxx0601
6	2	Vesta	  xxxx0602
...
6	ZZ	Myzptlk	  xxxx06ZZ
7	0	Jupiter	

You get the idea. The "sub" is to account for moons, and for major
bodies sharing the same orbit. You could add other fields to give
things like "is mainworld" and "star/planet/asteroid/moon".

The explanations for Grandfather, IIRC, were given in an OOC mode, 
setting the norm for the OTU <ducking>. That is, yo ucan say they

What I\'d read said that the billing was based on *frontage*. So if my
property has 50 feet of boundary along the street, and yours has 100,
you\'d pay twice what I did.

But my info is based on a (seemingly well researched) novel from the
60s. "The Day New York Went Dry" by Pyhllis Eisentien(sp)

Actually, if you have them *inside* a structure, the infamous "liquid
banana peel" may be useful. If you\'ve got *no* traction, that augmented
strength ain\'t gonna do you any good.

I can see them trying to use the equivalent of "ice axes" to stick into
the walls or floor and pull themselves along. But if you hit them with
another spray of LBP, they may have trouble holding onto the "ice axe".

And I\'d *love* to see someone trying to use grenades or any sort of
weapon that isn\'t "built-in".

And as Clarke pointed out long ago, New Guinea is both on the Equator
*and* has high mountains. 

The three "best" potential launch sites are:

1. New Guinea
2. Ecuador
3. Kenya (Mt. Kilimajaro).

Ecuador\'s biggest problem is that they\'d have to launch over Brazil,
and Brazil might not be real happy about pieces of aborted launch
vehicle falling down on them.

Mt. Kilamanjaro is also a fair ways from the coast. So it too has the
potential to rain pieces of rocket on people.

Actually, you need this, or something like this, just to meet *safety*
standards. It\'s like ocean liners being required to be divided into
watertight compartments that can be sealed off from the rest of the
ship. 

So even passenger liners will be divided into sections by airtight
bulkheads, with automatic doors to seal them off. And they\'ll have some
sort of minimal life support (stored air, maybe some filtration
capability, maybe merely oxygen candles). 

BTW, if a pressure loss alarm goes off *don\'t* be in the way of a door
in one of the "airbreak" bulkheads. It *will* close. In fact, it is
probably spec\'ed to close even with a pressure suited human "blocking"
it. 

If it\'s a "cheap" setup, the door will be a single door and require
overrides to open with a pressure difference bewteen the sides. So if
you need access to a partially or totally depressurized section, you
eith bleed in air, or you set up a portable airlock over the hatch.

If it\'s a good setup, all doors thru the bulkhead will be airlocks.

The real problem is with Moray, the modelling program with the most features
for POV-Ray. It\'s quite difficult to make funky shapes with it. You can make
something like a lab ship, a modular cutter or a merc cruiser, but it\'s
harder to churn out stuff with more interesting or organic shapes.

Yes, if anyone starts working with Moray and POV-Ray, just drop me an email
and I\'ll be glad to send along any help I can with doing decent textures
with it.

MTJ 3 has plans for the naval station at Depot/Corridor. I could send a
scan,but IMHO it\'s not a good design. Problems include no parkbays for
ships over 1000 dtons, ONE (1) landing strip for airframe craft, and no

I\'m fairly sure it\'s a basic limitation. Remember, your "pump" has to
accept input at the *ambient* pressure of the volume you are trying to
pump down. Which means that as the pressure drops, the *amount* of gas
in the volume of the pump drops rapidly.

Turbine pumps are pretty much useless for acieving low pressures. So at
least to get from standard pressure to "fairly low" (a "roughing pump")
you use what amounts to a piston pump. Many are rotary, but the
principle is the same. 

You have a chamber that is open to the volume you wish to pump out. A
valve then closes, isolating the volume. The volume is then compressed
(either piston or rotary mechanism). Another valve opens allowing the
high pressure air to flow into the storage tank. 

So, let\'s assume we\'ve got a 1m x 1m x 1m pump volume that compresses
down to 1m x 1m x 1 mm. That outputs air at 1000 times the input
pressure (and that takes a *strong* piston!).

Storage pressure will *not* be that high. Consider. If you store the
air at 1000 atm, once the *input* pressure to the pump drops below 1
atm, it can no longer *achieve* 1000 atm output pressure, so the check
valve on the storage tank won\'t open!

If we drop the storage pressure to 100 atm, then the pump can store air
until in the input pressure drops to .1 atm (1.5 psi). Hmmm. That\'s not
a very good vaccuum. 

So, it looks like we\'ll need a multi-stage pump. That way we can get
down to a lower pressure without have to use a ridiculously low storage
pressure. 

So we gang up *two* such pumps, with a storage vessel inbetween them. 

This lets us use 100 atm (1500 psi, or 100 kgf/cm^2) for the "final"
storage. 

BTW, I\'m ignoring the "leftover" gas inside the piston after the
pressure with the storage tank equalizes. The residual gas sets
*another* limit on how low a pressure the pump can reach.

Ok, let\'s get back to that first stage pump. We\'ll assume that we are
pumping out 100 m^2. Each stroke removes 1 m^3 of the *remaining* air.
Resulting in a new pressure that is .99^(number of strokes) of the
starting pressure. That .99 is 
	(vol to be pumped)-(vol of pump stroke)
        ----
	(vol to be pumped)

	pressure

- ----  ----
1	.99 atm
2	.98 atm

90	.40 atm
100	.37 atm
200	.13 atm
300	.05 atm
400	.02 atm
500	.01 atm

Ok, great. .01 atm is "close enough" and it only took 500 strokes. But
that was with a 1:100 pump to volume ratio. Lets try that again, but
for 1000, 10k, and 100k m^3 volumes. The relevant ratios are .999,
.9999 and .99999.

The quick way of getting the answer is log(pressure)/log(ratio).

volume	strokes	time (at 1 stroke/sec)
- ----	----	----
    100	    458	    00:07:38
  1,000	  4,603	    01:16:43
 10,000	 46,049     12:47:29
100,000	460,515  5d 07:55:15

So as you can see, the time to pump out depends on the ratio of sizes
*and* goes up somewhat *faster* than linearly as the ratio increases.

And a pump that take 7 minutes for 100 m^3 takes an hour and a quarter
for 1000 m^3 (semi-acceptable) and almost 13 *hours* for 10k. It\'s
totally unacceptable for 100k (5.3 *days*).

I rather expect that carrying it as liquid is *much* simpler, given

Liquid ammonia is much easier to store. It will liquefy under fairly
low pressures even at *normal* temperatures. That\'s why it is used
extensively in *commercial* refrigeration units.

Subs aren\'t likely to lose nitrogen. After all, it\'s not reactive.

No you can\'t. Not without recertifying *every* item that either
maintains pressure or is exposed to it. To give you one simple example,
increase the air pressure by say, 20% and your canned goods and other
sealed items will start to crush from the difference between internal
and external pressure. 

CRTs will tend to implode. And they\'ll fail at a greater rate as air
leaks past seals.

Wrong. The amount of air that *has to be circulated, temperature
controlled and filtered varies *directly*. Remember, you *can\'t* merely
run up the pressure in the rest of the ship. 

> The total number of people breathing atmosphere wont change (much).
> So the toxin removal, CO2 removal, oxygen replacement requirements wont

You missed the point. Those requirements are *not* based on the number
of people using the air. They are based on the volume of air that has
to be processed. Really. Check with an HVAC engineer. Except for
extreme cases, the required circulation is based on *volume*, not
occupancy. As in "x number of complete air changes per hour". 

If people are going to live/work in that volume, you *must* "change"
the air (ie circulate a volume equal to the volume of air in the area)
so many times per hour. And on board ship "circulate" includes removing
excess CO2, adjusting humidity to be within the correct range (usually
this means removing excess water), filtering out dust, filtering out
unwanted "trace" gases, and adjusting temperature of the airflow.

All a higher ratio of volume to people does is give you a bigger
"buffer" to work with. That is, if you have a *large* area with few
people in it, you can skimp on the changes. But it\'s not a good idea.
It\'s the sort of thing you reserve for when there are problems with the
system.

That\'s high level heat. You can run radiators red-hot to get rid of the
heat from the reactor and the like. We pretty much assume that it\'s
possible to thermally isolate such things from the rest of the ship.

To cool off the life-system, you need to run *those* radiators at
*below* room temp.

IMTU bands tend to have at least a three part name.  The
Imperium is a big
place, so it has a lot of bands, so they need long names to distinguish
themselves.  A lot of bands will include someone\'s name in
the band name so you can more easily tell who which band
their are.  There might be a dozen bands
named Flaming Droyne so one could be named Eneri\'s Flaming
Droyne to distinguish it from Suzy\'s Flaming Droyne and
Chaka\'s Flaming Droyne.

An example band description from my current musician PBEM
character\'s past

"Juloa\'s next big gig was with the group Touring Nonstop
Drugblast; one of the first pro Scout Brew groups to make it
big outside the Scout Bar scene. Unfortunately Touring
Nonstop Drugblast did not just sing about Scout brew they
drank it and encouraged their entourage, including their
ships Astrogator, to use it. In retrospect a catastrophic
misjump was inevitable.. "

I don\'t know about YAAF, but I built Mark\'s Traveller Utilities (recently

wxWindows.  Version 1.6X of wxWindows across 16 and 32 bit windows and Motif 
on many *n*x platforms works like a champ.  The 2.0 version (which I\'m using
for Mark\'s Traveller Utilities available at http://www.visi.com/~markn/)
may not be as well in sync, but does provide an excellent framework.

ObTrav:  Well, I did say this was a shameless plug, so......  
I just updated Mark\'s Traveller Utilities to version 0.9.2.  This is a bug
fix realease, and I think it\'s ready, if not damn close, for public consumption.
It\'s available at (one more time :) http://www.visi.com/~markn/

  Two hangar decks ~80% of the way back, each 18m high, and ~35x60m. That\'s
over-doing it a bit, but call it nearly a Kt per hangar deck; it appears that
a good chunk of the launch tube volume is being included.

Please.  Some people don\'t know this yet.

I\'m losing interest in seeing it with everyone talking
about how \'obvious\' a hoax it was.

It\'s a horror movie.  The style was designed to make it as realistic as
possible, but I don\'t know anyone who considered it to be a real event.

Correct me if I am wrong, but this was in my data files. I beleve I found
it on the Vag web site.

Spinward Marches: Regina Subsector (Subsector C):
Shionthy (UNKNOWN): "Shionthy Belt is where Grandfather tilted the Droyne
homeworld into a pocket universe after the Ancient War. It\'s still
there." Source: Marc Miller in a post on the TML. (The Droyne homeworld
is called Eskaylot, or lost home, by the Droyne themselves, even they
dont know about its whereabouts. The only living being who knows where
it is, is Grandfather himself.)

Non-TMLers aren\'t all that bright.  I have several friends who
think its a documentary.  I enjoy letting them continue to think so.

And the different levels of the hoax are great.  These people
think they have heard "the real deal", when they\'re just at the
first layer of the onion.

As ships go WW2 German submarines are rather small.  Anybodies WW2 subs were
fairly small.  This makes it a different proposition than say putting the
Graf Spee of that era in a \'bunker\', let alone something like the Bismark or
the Yamato (or is that Yamamoto, always confuse the ship & the admiral of
that war).

I think the lattice work station from ST:TNG or the odd clamp, McKinley
Station I believe, that repaired the Enterprise-D after the 1st Borg
incursion are far more realistic than the spacedock.  Even on DS9 the ships
docked rather than came inside.  Of course DS9 is much smaller than the
spacedock.

        At the risk of being a cold bucket of water, this seems to be the
exact sort of experiment I\'d want to do on the moon.  =)  I wonder if they
can be convinced to move it.

        Of course, when they did the first H-Bomb test, there was a theory
that said it would cause a chain reaction that would spread to all hydrogen
molecules in the atmosphere, incinerating the Earth....

Possibly the best designs for a downport were in an old White Dwarf article
by Thomas Price. If not used directly they would be good to use as
inspiration.

As to Highports, I can\'t remember any designs, but I always based mine off
the stations described in CJ Cherryh\'s books. Downbelow Station has a
diagram of Pell, and the descriptions in the Chanur books are also quite
good.

Knightfall may have had a design for the downport which comes under meson fire.

I can probably get hold of these and scan them if needed. It just needs
some exploration through the old WDs.

Hey!  That\'s an *excellent* reason to put a base on the moon.  We
seem to need some sort of push to get those with the money in their
pockets to finance more space enterprises.  Maybe threatening to
make them all "strange" is just the trick. ;->

I thought of that when I read this too.

Of course, the probabilities of things going that wrong are probably
a billion times smaller than those of an asteroid making a direct
hit...on that lab...tomorrow...at 11:30.

Didn\'t Israel put up a satellite launching West not East? Or against the

Isn\'t Kenya the site for the Earth Tower in 2300? Or was it a catapult?

Knightfall material (which was actually published by GDW).
 I consider the White Dwarf article to be only part of the solution, 
personally, as it assumes a high percentage of reaction-drive ships and 
gliding landers. Added to a broader picture, where the "Star Wars VTOL" model 
is common, it becomes more useful.
 Another White Dwarf bit, the scenario "Shuttle Scuffle," did also have some 
port layout IIRC. I\'ll have to look...

Email Marc Miller at FarFuture@aol.com and ask nicely and he\'ll probably
send you a Zipped set of Word 95 files which are the playtest draft. It\'s

They\'re back in business IIRC (Legate may say more if he\'s still here).
ISTR that there is a link from the SJG website Traveller pages.

I got in touch with Dave Nilsen (FF&S1 co-author) a couple of years ago 
and we re-constructed the original design sequence as follows: 

The DV and Pen are calculated as a standard laser.  All you need to do is 
convert Yield into Discharge Energy.  

This was very difficult until I figured out that there was an "error" in 
the original table that was throwing things off.  Dave then vaguely 
recalled they used a standard log table to approximate a DE=X*Yield^.5 
function but Frank Chadwick dropped the "15" in the DE column for some 
reason.  This makes the stats in FF&S1 and FF&S2 not conform to any 
continous function.  If you reinsert the missing values, the following 
relationship holds perfectly.

DE = 31.7*(Yield)^.5

Yield		DV	Rounded	MyDV		FF&S1DV
10		100	100		25		25		
20		141	150		30.6		**
50		224	200		35.4		35
100		317	300		43.3		43
200		448	450		53.0		56
500		708	700		66.1		66
1000		1002	1000		79.1		79

Note that these stats are in FF&S1 DV units, so you\'ll have to convert 
for FF&S2.

As for volume, Dave wasn\'t as helpful there and we\'ll have to come up 
with an approximation on our own.  I found that a linear regression of DE 
on LN(Volume+1) fits pretty well and makes powerful det-laser warheads 
suitably large.

If people are interested I can post my volume solution and a table of 
pre-made warheads.

How about a high-velocity/high rate of fire weapon.  It may not penetrate
the suit, but smash up any sensors/the visor/the weapon.  It may also
cause "spall" damage inside the suit.

Is DE in the above equation the energy in MegaJoules produced by a
nuclear warhead of a given yield, and transferred (with energy losses,
of course) to a det-pumped laser?  If so, I should be able to adjust to
FF&S2 penetration and damage values.  If DE refers to some other
relationship between nuke yield and det-laser damage, please post the
correct relationship between nuke yield, penetration, and damage.

Concerning volume and mass of large det-laser warheads:  I suppose that
one could, in the absence of hard [i.e., classified] data, simply graph
the curve of values presented in FF&S2, and extrapolate from there.  Any
objections among the FF&S/FF&S2 gearhead caucus about such
extrapolation?

Please do (I\'d like to see whether my back-of-the-envelope conversions
match your calculations).

It\'ll be a no-brainer.  They\'ll call their \'Java\' something else.  M$ doesn\'t like adhering to \'standards\', even when *THEY* make the standards.  <grin>

<excerpt>I often envision jumpspace as a hyperspace topology that you can
lie the

normal 3 dimensional (3+?) on the surface of so that every point in the

universe corresponds with a point on the surface of jumpspace in much
the

same way as you can wrap a two dimensional surface around a sphere. 
With

this view a jump breaks the surface tension between universes/spaces 
and

projects you on a vector through jumpspace.  Your ship then follows its

course until it reached the exit-point back into the normal universe. 
Tides

within jumpspace create small variances in travel time but the basic
trip

takes about a week.  Stronger jump drives let you cut a deeper curve
though

jumpspace and thereby exit you a further distance from your entry 
point.

Jump drives use a preset that corresponds to a known-safe angle of
incidence

with jumpspace and when this is changed it results in a mis-jump.  The

trajectory and relative velocity through jumpspace is different and
causes a

different passage length in both time and distance.  Typically a jump
drive

consumes all of its fuel in opening the tear into jumpspace and
initiating

the ship on its trajectory.  The drive then shuts down and the ship

essentially coasts through jumpspace until it reaches the other end point
of

its trajectory and breaks the surface tension back into our universe.

This is exactly how I see jump-space. It is consistent with my reading of
the (original) Traveller rules, it is simple (for me, and for my
purposes) to understand, and it doesn\'t raise too many unanswerable
questions (that I have thought of). Of course, I don\'t use drop-tanks,
but let\'s not go there.

Realistically?  They can\'t even fire in air, they\'ll heat up the air enough
that it will absorb and scatter the beam.  Range in water would be measurable

     E.E. "Doc" Smith covered this in his classic Lensmen Space Opera Series.
Heavy machine gun fire couldn\'t penatrate the SpaceArmor, but it could 
knock the wearer over and keep \'em down.
The Hero practiced standing under heavy machine gun fire.

     In my early combat armor design rants, I suggested armoring the backs 
of gauntlets.  Not only did this increase punching damage, but holding your 
hands over your face protects the visor.

    The idea of taking out Battledress sensors and communications quickly 
is a good one.  It removes the most dangerous weapon system mounted on 
Battledress, the Ortillery Forward Observer option.

Probably. And like most "first satellite" launches, there\'s a hidden
subtext. Namely "We can launch nuclear ICBMs". That\'s why the US got so
worried when the USSR launched Sputnik. Any rocket capable of that
launch was capable of dropping a nuke anywhere in the world. 

So doing it the "wrong way" just makes Israel look *better*. :-)

It *can\'t* "shatter" easily, or else it wouldn\'t be useful as a hull
material, no matter *how* strong it is. Still, materials like this
should be considered more like fiberglass than metal. That means that
they don\'t "break" easily, but they have a tendency to "delaminate",
that is, the layers of matrix material and "fiber" (iron crystals?)
tend to seperate suddenly. 

This means that you *can* punch holes in the hull, and the surrounding
areas will be weaker due to partial delamination around the hole. But
things that just "stress" the hull are a different matter. It\'s
possible for the hull to look okay, and then one day it gets stressed
in a way it has handled many times before. Only *this* time the hulls
delaminates "totally". It just sort of "falls apart".

> Suggestions would be helpful, one of my PCs accidently banged to crystal

It\'s *probably* ok. Just be sure to let them know about the fun failure
mode I mention above. Some day they could bump something just wrong and
trigger a release of all the accumulated stresses. And watch as the
entire hull drifts away in pieces. 

That\'s the *fun* part of new, high-strength materials like fiberglass,
carbon fiber composites (and probably the fancy crystal iron and
superdense). New materials mean new failure modes. :-)

Nope.

> Would the laser flash boil the water in the beam?

The water would absorb anywhere from 50% to 99+% of the beam energy in
the first *meter*. Given that the beam energy is megajoules or even
gigajoules "boil" is a *completely* inadequate description. The water
will *explosively* convert into high energy plasma. And the shock wave
will have "severe adverse effects" on the laser *and* the ship.

> How about the effect of the water on the focussing array?

No idea, probably not even *usable* underwater.

Remember, at *weapons* laser energies, the target does not "melt" or
"boil". You are dumping in too much energy, way too fast. The surface
layers of solid objects explode. And I described the result on liquids
above.

Limii Orbital.  There\'s also a description of a real bare-bones

outcropping of exposed bedrock equipped with a transponder beacon
and a log recorder (so ships could record that they were there).

Something worry Grandfather?  <shudder>  If virus didn\'t worry him, what
did?  Perhaps the Empress Wave was aimed at him?  Age old enemy getting
even?  Hmm.  Makes you wonder.

If we assume that history tends to repeat itself, then maybe we have a mice
and elephants scenario.  Perhaps Grandfather made the other anchient dudes
to help balance the powers, or to turn back a threat.  Then they turned out
to be as big or bigger trouble as what they were created to get rid of.
Rather like the Indian king who had mice, brought in cats, had cat trouble,
brought in dogs, had dog trouble, brought in lions, had lion trouble and
brought in elephants, then he REALLY had troubles! So, he brought in mice to
scare off the elephants.  There may have been a few other steps that I
missed, it was a long story.

And I still don\'t like the pocket universe explainations that I have heard
so far.  If this dude is so smart, why would he have to wait for a future
event?  He could just _go_ to that point in time, or skip along until he
finds the right spot.  No, he is either hiding from something or cooking up
a scheme...  or he\'s wandered off somewhere else and the whole pocket
universe deal is a ruse that the plant told to throw us off of the scent in
"Secrets of the Ancients".

The only problem that I have with this is that a competitive universe tends
to favor competitive/aggressive folk and they don\'t make the best docile
workers.  A little too ambitious to be content with just taking orders.  I
could see that he might want an advanced race that has developed a different
mid set.  Maybe there is something inherent to his thinking pattern from
leaping to super-intelligence in a very short time.  Maybe people that
struggle for millennia to raise to that level would see his blind spots.
That or being immortal has made him be too reluctant to take risks.  Having
so much life and being afraid of loosing it?  Maybe he wants an ephemeral
high intelligence that won\'t be as scared to push the history eraser button
just to see what it would do?

I would think you would want to swing the time flow the other way, unless
boredom is a problem.  Since Grandfather is theoretically immortal age
wouldn\'t be a problem and you could always do time lapse recording and
review of the outside universe to keep up on current events in a manageable
way (Just check the tape every few millennia, local time).  If a thousand
years passed in the pocket universe for one in ours you could buy allot more
time to study a problem that existed in our time frame, plus it would give
you a good research advantage in case a race made a technological leap and
achieved tech that could threaten you outside of the normal progression.
See a race that has dangerous tech, do a few hundred years research to build
up defense and offense and appear a week later.


Thinking of Grandfather\'s immortality brought to mind a question.  Where do
anagathics come from?  Some Imperial research program?  Ancient technology?
Or is Grandfather leaking some immortality juice (In a weekend form) into
the Imperium to adjust some variables.

The only problem I have is the chance of collision.  Of course ships
disappear all the time ;).  If you had sensors that worked in jump space you
could see a collision coming, but without thrusters that worked in jump
space you would not be able to avoid it so no word of the collisions would
ever get through unless someone else was passing in observation range.  Of
course, if you had thrusters that worked in jump space you would probably
never get back on the exact same flight path after the coarse correction and
end up coming out hell knows where.

There is reference in the Psionic Institute book (T4) to a theory that all
psionics are the result or an ancient machine that exists in jumpspace
pointing to the fact that jumpspace has a continuos existence outside of
operating a jump field.

Also in the T4 book p.109, I believe, there is a drawing in which the
caption mentions that within the portal\'s depths is seen the shifting
pattern of jump space.  This leads me to ask what does jump space look like?
Shifting patterns of what kind/  Multicolored?  Glowing blue clouds? Red
(ala B5)?  Arching energy discharges?  What would a character see if they
looked out a window or went EVA during jump?

Yep, same as the one called Gateway station in the K\'Kree MTJ4. But it\'s a
DGP publication which the SJG instructions for writers say to ignore
completely ie it isn\'t canon.

I guess I wasn\'t clear.  Time is faster in Grandfather\'s system.  Since the

I\'ve been using GT ship design rules lately. I allow a ship with a command
bridge to link jump governors of other craft prior to jump. This allows them
to coordinate the jump.  Naturally most commercial (read PC) craft do not
have Command Bridges, so if multiple jumpships with regular bridges attempt
to jump together they are susceptible to jump variation.

This has the effect of giving military craft an advantage over nonmilitary
craft, and allows effective fleet action. Without this capability a fleet
would arrive at a target system over a period of several days and have to
loiter to wait for the full fleet to arrive. This shifts the balance heavily
to the defenders. Too heavily in my opinion.

I thought about that type of weapon for knock down but did not think it
through as far as you did, don\'t know why what you suggest sounds perfectly
reasonable to me.

Regardin my suggetion which ran "How about high pressure hoses of salt
>>water
>>> with electric currents run through them to knock them down and
>>possibly
>>> short their circuitry?"

I guess I was not clear in my question, the intent was for the high pressure
hoses to provide knock down, the high amp alternating electric current was
intended to screw with their circuitry.  Does anyone think that it would
work?  Would a high amp capacitance discharge device, sort of like a super
taser or even a super shock wand have any effect on battle dress either on
its circuitry or the critter inside?  Incidentally the super banana peel
(sbp) is really a grand idea.  I can picture hoses from slurry pumps with an
STP type lubricant and ball bearings or some sort of dump trap.

The orginal question came out of a CT campaign I ran many years back.  It
consisted "Wild Geese type screw job".   The PC mercenaries are stuck in a
bad situation on a low tech world, barely up to WWI technology minus the
gas.   Their transport off world, the only transport, will not arrive in
system for several months.  They fight their way out of the initial ambush
with a limited amount of high tech, TL 12 or so personal arms and hook up
with some "friendly nomads" who were the resistance against the bad guys.
The kicker was that the other side was getting covert high tech advice.
Everytime the PCs would use "high tech weaponery" in a critical situation
the other side would generally have a low tech crude, but reasonably
effective, counter measure the next time it was tried against an important
target.   The issue I was trying to make with the party was that low tech
doesn\'t equal stupid.   I ran the campaign segment twice, once with my
regular group and then later for a game shop buddy\'s high school group.  I
really was shocked when one teen asked how much should he lead a biplane
with his laser rifle.   I said, "Well its a side on shot, the plane is
moving relatively slow.  Think now, how fast is the projectile, i.e. the
lazer beam, travelling relative to the target\'s velocity.   You should be
able to figure it out for yourself."  I got a confused look in return and I
then suggested, in jest, that a couple of millimeters ahead of the exact
point on the plane he wanted to hit would do the trick.

Gee, kind of like superdense materials, which we know **are** canon.  Or
perhaps contragrav. Or maybe Black and White Globe technology. Or thruster
plates, which deliver thrust without either heat or radiation damage. Or
possibly even replusors? Maybe some people don\'t use all of these in their
TU. But they all exist in the OTU.

And for the record. The reason that the spruce goose or even the Wright
plane couldn\'t be built by Leonardo Da Vinchi had much to do with the lack
of an underlying technical support structure than any single cause.

I suggest persuing the Star Trek Interactive tech manual. Not to use as a
direct source, but for it\'s underlying premise of technological
interconnectedness.  The authors pre-supposed several impossible
technological innovations and then carried them forth to their logical
conclusion. For Example:

If you can transport matter from one place to another, one of the
technologies you have to have is something to make a pattern of the matter
and store it. Now If I can take a pattern and store it and them convert it
to matter why cant I just take a "picture" of an object, permanently store
it, and make a copy whenever I want. And so now we have the famous
replicator.

Another example: Warp drive has a component that reduces the inertia of an
object, thereby reducing it\'s mass, at least as far as the "real" universe
is concerned.  So why not add a little bit of warp drive to the impulse
engines that are used to travel through normal space? By reducing the mass
of the craft you can get more velocity for less thrust.

Yeah its all impossible and goes against the laws of physics as we
understand it. But it is internally consistent.  (No I don\'t want to start a
debate on the consistency of the shows, the movies, or the books. Nor am I
saying to use these devices in Traveller.)

OBTRAV:Contragrav. Personal grav belts exist. That indicates a device small
enough to fit in a belt capable of lifting ~100-300 lbs.  Different
Traveller rules handle motion differently. (I believe CT allows contragrav
craft self-propulsion in a gravity field. GURPS requires a separate
thruster, which at GTL12 is probably a thrust plate.) So lets assume the GT
floating contrgrav. From this follows the contragrav stretcher, the
contrgrav "wheel" chair, the contragrav refrigerator/furniture mover, even
the contrgrav cargo container mover and the contragrav city. Much already
discussed here. These are the obvious spin-offs of this technology. What are
the unobvious spin-offs and results? Homes with doors on the roof? Windows
that are always locked, even on the twelfth floor.  Perhaps buildings whose
roofs aren\'t even attached to the rest of the building, but supported by
contragrav. (Yes I realize it will fall if the contragrav fails.) Other
ideas?

Of course the pumps that are used at really high vacuums have **no** moving

Todays pumps require quite a bit of "roughing" before an ion pump can be
used to finish the evacuation. What I\'m saying is that I find the idea that
a piston or turbine would be used thousands of years in the future to
accomplish this somewhat silly.  Especially as they have replusor
technology. I would expect some kind of device that would use repulsor or
contrgrav technology to rapidly pump liquids and gases, at rates much higher
than we can accomplish, without moving parts.

Some of the best anagathics come from the tree kraken, an endangered
species on ... um, I forget, somewhere in the Spinward Marches.  I think
that\'s mentioned in Adventure 1: The Kinunir.  Surely SuSAG makes
synthetic and natural anagathics.  Nevertheless, the anagathics that
might allow people of Solomani ancestry to extend their life-spans to
match the Vilani (120+ years) still can\'t bring anyone anywhere close to
Grandfather\'s age.

Unless you have the ability to convert heat to another form, say directly to
electricity and then store it for latter use. I know **we** can\'t do it. But
it\'s theoretically possible, and consistent with the other advances in
Traveller technology.

The same concept applies to regular tanks as well.  In Iraq we used a SP
Vulcan (20mm, HE, 3000 rounds per minute) on a captured Iraqi tank.  300
rounds (6 seconds) later the tank had no treads, no antennas, no vision
blocks, no external machine guns, no sight for the cannon.  Can\'t move,
can\'t call for help, and the only way it can see (and aim) is to look
down the barrel of the main gun.  Of course, we did get some spall damage
as well, but I guess Battledress is better than Soviet made tanks.

Here are a couple of possibilities suggested by the ability to
manipulate gravity:

1.  Megaconstruction projects become simpler and safer.  One limit on
skyscraper construction is the difficulty of moving building materials
to the upper levels of the building.  While this can be overcome at
TL-8, eventually the cost of doing so becomes prohibitive.  With
relatively cheap CG, buildings can rise much higher.  In fact, the main
limits I can see would be the strength of the materials used (which may
themselves be CG-assisted), and the lack of oxygen at higher levels. 
Meanwhile, construction becomes safer, as a falling worker becomes a
minor inconvenience, rather than a red flapjack.

2.  Lifespans can increase, even without anagathics.  It has long been
suggested in science fiction that low-gravity environments will extend
lifespans, due to decreased stresses on the human body.  If this is
indeed the case, then those whose systems need decreased stresses can
live in lower-gravity dwellings.  OTOH, the healthy and strong can live
in normal (or slightly higher-than-normal) gravity, both to prevent
calcium loss in microgravity and to ensure that exposure to high natural
gravity is not a catastrophic stress on their bodies. 

3.  The real estate available for human use increases drastically.  If
one can counter gravity, one can increase it locally as well (witness
the artificial gravity on Traveller starships).  This means that both
low-gravity bodies (such as moons and asteroids) and high-gravity bodies
(such as unusually large/dense planets) can be made more easily
habitable.  Even if gravitic manipulation cannot be made global (this
would allow retention of atmosphere by small bodies), the adjustment of
gravity in occupied spaces would make the transistion from Earth-sized
worlds to low-gravity or high-gravity bodies simple, as all would have
similar apparent gravity.

      Refer to the classic flick "Predator" on how long you can keep an 
armored trooper with a plasma gun in a net.
They generally land rather pissed.

     The trick here is to hit the net with *multiple* LAW rockets RDQ, 
before the trooper blasts his/her way out of the net.

Doubtful that the hoses would get the water anywhere it would do any harm,
aside from simple knockabout from the waterpressure... BD can survive
safely exposures of up to 2d6 hours in an insidious atmosphere, so it can
probably withstand weeks of saline.

I don\'t think the salt is in the water as a corrosive element - I think it\'s
intended to make the water as electrically conductive as possible.

I don\'t think you can make a water stream as electrically dangerous
as a wire net (carried by harpoons from a nice launcher, spooling 
out a wire hooked to a mondo battery pack, or a handy landline...).
You might not be able to electrocute the wearer, but you might be
able to make some of the volatile stuff he\'s wearing explode.
Regardless, his sensor array and carried gear will be a royal mess.

I wonder...is there something else you could spray from a hose
that would be bad for battledress? Something sticky and flammable,
perhaps - these suits did re-entry, but they don\'t have their ablative
drop pods any more, you might be able to cook them. Or how about
some opaque, sticky, radar-reflective paint? Blind and clumsy isn\'t
the same as dead, but it\'s a good start.

I don\'t know enough about the materials involved to know what kind
of damaging chemicals you could spray on battledress. I doubt such
chemicals, if they existed, would be lower tech than the battledress,
so we can leave them out of the discussion for now. Unless, of course,
that last Free Trader had a couple tanks of Superdense-B-Gone in
his cargo hold... :-)

Certainly.

Of course, the *real* reason seems obvious from a glance at a map: if they
launched eastward, the ascending missile would fly over Jordan, Saudi
Arabia, Iraq, and Iran, who might object to that sort of thing. Westward
puts it over the Mediterranean.

	The way that I deal with this is that jump space is BIG. To 
	paraphrase "The Hitchhiker\'s Guide to the Universe": Space is
	big. You just can\'t believe how mind-bogglingly big space is.
	I mean, you may think that it\'s a long walk to the pharmacy, 
	but that\'s just peanuts to space... Well, jumpspace is 
	bigger and space is just peanuts to jump space. The odds of
	colliding with anything in jumpspace as close to nil as most
	anything gets. The other thing is that I don\'t regard jump-
	space as linear: if two identical starships perform identical
	jumps from points 100 m appart, they will not arrive 100 m 
	appart. Rather, they follow different "trajectories" and may 
	arrive thousands of km appart. Thrusters are pretty useless
	in jumpspace, but firing them may mess up the jump (you are
	changing the mass of the vessel, if nothing else).

>There is reference in the Psionic Institute book (T4) to a theory that

	Although I do not invoke the ancients to explain psionics, I
	have always regarded Teleportation as a specialized jump 
	(matter transporters as well).

	IMTU there is no light whatsoever. Ultimate darkness. As I

	is not a problem (and suit thrusters work). Just don\'t get

	How much this would favour the defenders depends on:
		1) how much variance you impose on jump times
		2) how good sensors are IYTU

	This has already been discussed on the TML, but IMTU it is
	easy enough to jump to a random spot in the system and
	wait there for stragglers (which will arrive long before
	the defending force can maneuver to intercept). Life is 
	made easier by the lack of any "jump signature" on arrival
	IMTU. Nevertheless, uncoordinated jumps would be hazardous
	if one wanted to arrive close to the main world in order to
	catch the forces there by surprise.

The Learning Kingdom\'s Cool Fact of the Day for July 20, 1999
- ----

              When does light travel slower than sound?

- ----


Usually, light zooms through space at 300 million meters (186,000
miles) per second.  But in a recent experiment, a pulse of light was
slowed down to only 17 meters (55.7 feet) per second.  Sound travels
at 340 meters (1115 feet) per second in air.

The trick was to pass the light pulse through a cloud of extremely
cold sodium atoms.  The sodium atoms, which were cooled to a frigid
50 billionths of a degree above absolute zero, entered a special
state called a "Bose-Einstein condensate."  In this state, millions
of atoms act as if they are one single atom.

The light pulse slowed down because it constantly exchanged energy
with the atoms in the cloud.  Upon leaving the cloud, it returned to
its normal zippy pace.  Scientists are excited by the experiment\'s
implications for physics.  It might also lead to new components for
optical computers or other devices.

The experiment was conducted by Dr. Lene Hau at the Rowland Institute:

destroying the belovent image of Grandfather and may be attempts to turn him 
into a peaceful Gardener of the Stars.  I am reminded of a passage from A. 
Rybakov\'s novel - Fear:

	  Sasha knew which man she meant.
	  "But, the party, the people-"
	  "We don\'t have a Party," Zvyaguro interrupted.  "We have cadres who 
obediently carry out his polices.  He hates the Party and is destroying it 
and he hates the people and he\'s destroying them too."
	  Sasha ran his eyes over the newspaper pages.  "Here\'s what Stalin says 
about he people:  `People have to be nutured like a gardener nutures a 
beloved fruit tree.\'"
	  Lidya Grigoryevna interrupted him again.  "`Gardener\', `tree\', How many 
millions of those `trees\' has he chopped down in the villages?  How many 
millions have died of hunger...You don\'t know him, but I do.  I saw him.  I 
saw him closely as I see you now.  People, lives-they mean nothing to him.  
He\'s worse than a criminal, and he\'ll not not stop at murder if he needs 
something.  He\'s an actor; he can play any role.  Now he\'s talking about the 
people, flattering the people.  All tyrants do that.  The smart tyrant 
always flatters the people with words, while with words he destroys them.  
Don\'t you ever think about that?

I don\'y want turn Grandfather into a paranoid homocidal mass murderer.  But, 
I think one must realize how readily myths are actively created to foster 
the pursuit of power.  The tragedy of Grandfather is that he learns this too 
late like Faust.  Having the need to destroy all that he has created yet 
still a prisoner of his own creation - a pocket universe.
   As to the question of his immortality which has been floating around the 
discussion.  Why need it be the same body.  At TL15 brain transplants are 
possible At TL30+ it would be like treating a broken leg, I imagine.  
Grandfather could opt for a whole range of bodies specifically tailored to 
his needs as he possibily no longer as exists in a physical form but in a 
stored form.  Problem being that if you keep on making photocopies of 
photocopies you may lose the original as quality diminishes.  Hence, lives 
out the rest of his days in a pocket universe in suspended animation 
relaying upon his servants to play the role of gathers of information (and 
even after the Final War that role is substantially diminished.  Therefore, 
what Grandfather is and what he has become perhaps is the true Secret of the 
Ancients.
   On the list, I think we should not overuse the Ancients as the final 
answer to Life, the Universe and Everything.  Rather see in a milieu in 
which the civilization rose, prospered, declined and fell under the great 
wheel of History.  Traces of intermediary civilizations could be mistaken 
for the Ancients.  One needs only look at the Church of the Chosen or the 
Zhodani and Genosse for where a divine right clouds imperial pretentions.  
My keen interest is to develop civilizations that were on par or more 
advanced than the Ancients.

There\'s no serious advantage to SEFOP over a regular HEAT round for purposes
of killing battledress, unless you\'re building mines or the BD is construced
with reactive armor (I\'d probably treat a SEFOP round as a HEAT round with
-1/3 power, the same as for popup rounds).  That said, a 60mm TL 9 HEAT round
in GT does 6d*15(10), and would have about a 50% kill rate on the BD in Star
Mercs, much higher against lower-DR versions.

Actually its not theoretically possible (unless you have a major
low-temperature cooling source, which we already know we don\'t have), unless
you can violate the second law of thermodynamics (which doesn\'t necessarily
say you can\'t do this, black globe generators _do_ violate the second law of
thermodynamics).

any case.  So....simply relegate all \'advanced\' materials to the use of
imperial research stations and the like.  This means you start constructing
vehicles out of \'expensive\' materials and lower.  The only currently published
systems this affects are the battledress from Star Mercs (price drops to a
level I am not currently certain of, DR drops to 750) and the Intrepid, again
from Star Mercs (either leave stats alone, replace advanced metal with
expensive composite, and increase cost to $20 million, or make it DR 18,000
frontal, 6,000 other, of standard composite, and drop cost to $12 million).

However, I\'m pretty sure this would affect a lot of proposed designs for
imperial navy, and probably muck with starships as well.

Probably a good one to use as an example, or the Arcturus station from

  In CT (using Striker) you can simply assume that very shortly after their
introduction they may actually be standard (this would fit into the HEAP stat
charts at TL 8), thus allowing you to dispense with proliferating laminate 
armour rules a la most modern wargames/miniatures sets.

What about something very cold, like liquid hydrogen (we know from
Azhanti High Lightning (I think) that not even persons in battle dress
can enter a fuel tank that has fuel in it.  Under what conditions (which
atmospheres) could you shoot liquid hydrogen at battle dress?  What

That appears not to have been a fair race at all.  They measured light
through super cooled sodium, but referred to the speed of sound in air
at sea level.  They should send the sound through the sodium, too, and
then decide who is the winner.

If one looks at the Droyne Aliens Module, it becomes quite clear that
indeed, grandfather simply stopped aging, due to a combination of PSR15 and
the correct talent (awareness) at that level... any droyne can do it,
assuming they get both to the correct level of skill and power, don\'t get
shot, and avoid Yaskodray\'s attentions.

Note that under CT, the droyne had their own psionics tables, with some
abilities available at different levels. All psionics under CT were "index
level of skill (which could not exceed PSR) on table to find out abilities
granted by that skill." Aslan, Vargr, Humans (including Zhodani) all use
the normal tables. Hivers can\'t do it at all, and droyne have their own
tables. Don\'t recall about K\'Kree.... No other traveller editions have
similar phenomena in the mechanics, and thus it doesn\'t fit the system
mechanics as nicely. (altho in a TNE game, a player of a  droyne with
awareness successfully agrued for DM+ PSR/2 on aging saves)

Well, have fun coming up with a flexible hose which you can use to shoot
hydrogen with, it\'s at around 20K  To be honest, battledress should be able to
wade through LHd for short periods, though you wouldn\'t want to stay in a tank
for any significant period of time.  The effects of shooting liquid hydrogen
at someone in battledress would be relatively insignificant (aside from
creating a fire hazard), you\'d need a ton or more of hydrogen to really
freeze up heavy battledress.  Effects of liquid nitrogen and liquid oxygen
would be similar -- you need a greater weight in liquified gas than the mass
of the target suit.

Another good choice for FF&S2 ships is Bruce Alan Macintosh\'s Military
Combat System.

Least favorite combat system:  The rules in the basic T4 rulebook.  I
haven\'t tried the rules out on small starships, so they may not be _too_
bad.  However, a space combat system for Traveller, introduced 16 years
after High Guard 2d edition (HG2), should have a means of resolving ship
combat involving _real_ warships (such as, say, CORONATION-class
battleships [90,000 dtons]from the Milieu:0 timeframe).

Of course, HG2 is _still_ an excellent choice for both ship design and
space combat, if you can track down a copy.

Its possible in GT, almost.  The life extension healing discipline can reduce
aging rate by a factor of about 50, given sufficient power or skill (roll vs
power+skill-10).  Only a minor extension from there to a full immortality.

The problem with firing liquified gases is that they evaporate very quickly
on contact with air, warming quickly and forming a cloud of steam.

Well, putting aside real physics, I\'m sure it is written somewhere in either
an adventure or magazine (perhaps a rulebook?), I don\'t recall which, that
starship lasers can fire underwater with a decreased range, and that was
only due to the density of the water being greater than air, diffusing the
beam, etc., etc...  So if you want to get around it by a rulebook handwave,
they can (which works great for plot mechanics :)

Here are a couple of articles I wrote over a year ago, about the effects of
gravitics on society, written in the form of a "Popular Gravitics"
magazine. I\'d intended to write a how-to article on building your floating
dream home, and a round-up of new grav-vehicles, but never found the time.
I\'m unlikely to find the time in the foreseeable future, so here\'s what
I\'ve got. Maybe some stalwart TMLer will take it up from where I left off.

NB: the description of Efate in the first article is based on the CT-era
UWP, without reference to any other canon sources. For instance, I don\'t
have at hand the JTAS adventure, "Amber to Red", so I don\'t know if my
Efate agrees with canon. And so what if it doesn\'t? YTUMV...

Hope this stuff is useful to somebody...

Popular Gravitics
                 a magazine for the contragravity addict
	     230-1100

Greetings from Efate
                    from the Editor

I\'m dictating this, appropiately enough, from the comfortably plush
interior of a new Famille Spofulam _Prodigue_ luxury sedan, high above the
bustling groundstreets of Atafu, a major city on Efate (Spinward Marches
1705 - A646930-D). I\'m here to attend this year\'s SpinMar GravEx, just
about the biggest event on the calendar for the sector\'s contragrav
industry. Later in this issue of Popular Gravitics we\'ll have a full report
on the Expo, with a first look at all the latest vehicles and tech just
unveiled by all the major manufacturers.
     Efate is the perfect place to observe the remarkably far-ranging
effects of gravitic technologies. A densely populated, high-tech world with
famously lax legal strictures, Efate has embraced gravitics with unequaled
abandon. All around me I can see floating buildings of every shape and
size, most of them sensibly close to the ground, some tethered, but many
hanging high overhead like diamondoid clouds. The skylanes snaking between
them are dense with every manner of grav vehicle and, farther down, long
swarms of commuters in gravbelts and gravsuits. Skylane and groundstreet
alike are lined with huge aerial advertisements, a vast clutter of
holographic display screens flashing exuberantly for attention. On most
other worlds, public safety laws would keep the buildings comfortably
secured to the ground (on thin columns at least), the skygrid would keep
the vehicle densities down a bit, and those annoying ads would\'ve been
outlawed long ago. But this is Efate, where the governing oligarchs rule
with a light hand. A little visual cacaphony, hair-raising traffic, and the
occasional house dropping out of the sky are okay with them, so long as the
wheels of commerce are free to churn unimpeded.
     And churn they do. Fortunately, the industrial zones are all well
outside the city, sprawling across the landscape and spewing a lot of
garbage into the air, adding noticeably to the toxins already present in
Efate\'s thin atmosphere. Though you\'d never know it here in Atafu, where
you can walk the streets without a filter. The entire city,
cloud-buildings, holo-boards and all, is encompassed by one of the biggest
pressurized tents I\'ve ever encountered. A stupendously vast, irregular
dome of woven carbon, the tent is a barely visible veil against the sunset.
The tent covers the entire mesa on which the city was built, dipping down
below the plateau at the edges. It\'s open at the bottom, where the skylanes
slip under the tent\'s fringe, out of the city\'s filtered air and into the
thin, toxic miasma beyond. Air pressure helps keep the tent up, but even
here gravitic modules lend a hand.
     It\'s a cityscape a contragrav-junky could fall in love with.
     And there above me, that cluster of flattened ovoids, is Atafu
Convention Centre, site of this year\'s GravEx. Let\'s park and see what\'s
new, shall we?

The physical properties of superdense matter are still going to be
limited by the strength of chemical bonds. It is not dense enough for
nucleonic interactions to take over (in which case the strong force is
the limit of the material\'s tensile strength) e.g. neutronium.

Terry, some excellent thoughts about the implications of contragrav.
Other ideas : no stairs or elevators in buildings (?chutes), ground
based zero-g simulators (and a slew of spin-off sports), implications
for materials science and medicine (e.g. materials fabrication, grav
based life support suits to decrease muscle effort (before regen tech)).

Repulsors and contragravity are identical technology in Trav as you
know. The reactionless thruster apparently relies on some slightly
different principle which enables it to operate outside a significant
gravity well.

?Spacecraft drives - high thrust contragrav component for lift-off then
the mysterious reactionless drive outside a gravity well? (which
conveniently limits the latter\'s use to propulsion).

A big problem is limiting the capability of gravitics. Laser gravitic
focussing is going to require lensing effects driven by millions(?) of
g\'s of tightly localised spatial distortion.
	Surely the spin-offs from \'pseudo-gravitic optics\' would be interesting
if not particularly numerous.

Screen (\'globe\') technologies and damper fields are a big \'can of
worms\'.

Being able to manipulate nuclear binding forces prevents accurate
radioisotope dating (adventure hooks), may be useful in imaging (cause
isotopes already present in sample to decay, releasing photons, etc.),
food sterilisation, and of course remediation of radioactive
areas/materials.

IMTU the black globe acts like the stasis field in Haldeman\'s \'The
Forever War\' (decreases unprotected object\'s molecular velocity to a few
metres per second), and radiates heat like a black hole.
	Applications in low-temperature refrigeration are obvious ; so there
are a slew of non-military applications for this technology.
	The white globe just radiates over a wider range of the spectrum, but
only energy weapons can be fired out of it.

Aren\'t you still going to have to radiate waste heat?
Even if you manage to generate some electrical power from some of the
waste heat, there will still be a heat load that needs disposal.

The same principle applies to pumps ; or has thermodynamics gone to
lunch (only ideal pumps are isentropic, and heat engines limited by the
Carnot cycle)?

This isn\'t true.  You can radiate heat at a temperature higher
than the thing you are cooling.  It is called a heat pump
and it is how an air conditioner works.  (otherwise you
could never cool anything below ambient temperature).

Really big frickin\' buildings, I mean astonishingly huge arcologies. It\'s
one of the problems that architects face today. Access is a big problem in
building really big structures today. Nobody wants to climb stairs and
elevators only work up to a point. Contragrav belts allow everybody to carry
their own elevators with them at all times. Everywhere.

There\'d be new theories in planning and growing cities. New problems in
governing cities of vast sizes. After all, you can have the population of a
good-sized city in one vast structure. It might lead to a sort of rebirth of
communalism, a mindset in which everyone knows their neighbors, and their
neighbors\' neighbors.

That\'s just if you take into account massive buildings.

Cheap contragrav and power might create a limitless society. Everyone can
buy an aircraft, likely a relatively cheap one. No place is off limits on a
world with cheap CG. It\'s not as good as, say, instant personal
teleportation, but it\'s a sight better than what we have now.

Pack up the bags, load up the kids, fill the tank... *FWOOSH*

In a few hours, you\'re at grandma\'s, two thousand miles away. No need to
fuss with reserving or buying tickets... your Ling-Standard air/wagon will
work just fine.

	I don\'t know about Gurps, but "self-forging projectile" (SEFOP)

	FFS2.

	As with HEAP, the metal projectile is "superplastic", not 
	"superhot".

	For demonstration purposes I have build SEFOP charges using a 
	spoonful of pentrite and a metal coin. The only required 
	high-tech material is an explosive compound with sufficiently 
	high strike-wave velocity.

	True. The secondary fragments formed by spall and spew effects 
	can kill the crew in an armored vehicle even if the hull was not 
	punctured. HESH (aka. "HEP") warheads are notorious for these 
	effects.

	The explosion-formed projectile is formed few meters ahead of 
	the target, so that the whole projectile is fully formed before 
	it hits the target. This action gives two advantages over 
	contact-ignited HEAP warhead.

	1) SEFOP does not require nose contact with the target. An 
	anti-armor missile can be guided over target so that it fires 
	one or more SEFOP warheads downwards during the overpass.

	2) SEFOP appears to be less affected by reactive armor than 
	HEAP.
	
	However these two advantages are more useful against an armored 
	vehicle than a battledress. Unless the BD is using reactive 
	plates, SEFOP and HEAP should have roughly similar effects.

Just a quick note as to why our author would one would fly one of Famile
Spofulam\'s fine grav vehicles.

Efate is Law Level Zero, remember.

I figure two of Ditzie\'s Super Soakers linked up to a point-defense system
and half a dozen Rappoteurs on stub-wing pods is about right. Although I\'m
thinking long and hard about a Circular PAW.

Well, what this proves is that the speed of light varies depending on the
conditions that it is passing through.  So, if we presuppose that even space
has *some* effect on lightspeed (like maybe gravity affecting it), then
removing that influence might push the light speed limit higher.  That would
propagate down to the efficiency limit (where going past a certain percentage
of c becomes too inefficient). Which in turn would increase the top speed.

Of course you can do some screwy mathematical stuff as well due to the
hyperbolic nature of achieving light speed.  Say you\'re cruising along at a
good clip.  The energy required to get you closer to c becomes prohibitive.
Now you reduce c to below your current speed.  That puts your speed on the
other side of the c hyperbole. You accelerate a bit and put yourself on the
far side of the vacuum c hyberbolic arc and then shut down your c
decelerators.  After that, it takes less and less energy to go faster and
faster.  Breaking becomes problematic... well maybe not...

Agreed Droyne society is capable of doing some pretty freaky things given 
that their society has integrated psionic talent with technological 
development from the onset.  Which is probably the reason for 
passivity...why invent the telephone when I have this ringing in my head?  
The point being Grandfather even as psi extra-ordinare that he/she/it was 
could not still survive the whole 100 000 years of the Ancients period 
without some technological assistance.  Was that the catalyst then for 
technological heights for Grandfather and the rest of the Ancients - the 
quest for true immortial life?  Relying on the psi answer makes Grandfather 
and the rest of the Ancients a bunch of septic monks mediating on the 
mysteries of universe.  Relying on psi explanations for me is like relying 
on magic in other game systems.  There are those instances when the big mean 
nasty monster eats the spellcaster first.  Wht does the party do then?
Psi as it was originally concieved was to be the forbidden fruit.  Now, that 
the Droyne were expelled from the Garden and had to live with earthly 
deprevations makes them almost boring.  Psi ought to be used more wisely.  
In my campaign, I have alerted and strongly emphaised the Imperial sanction 
on psionics.  Voyages across into the Consulate have resulted in their 
awareness that Imperial rules are rigid and basically aimed at preserving 
the monopoly of knowledge in the Imperium.  My point is and I do have one.  
To explain everything away with either Science (the knowable) or Psi (the 
unknowable) is one of our society\'s axels.  Finding balance is essential.
I am aware what canon says.  But, to delve into the mysteries and secrets of 
the Ancients requires we move beyond canon.  Awareness alone, combined with 
all the agathic treatments in the universe could not keep an organism alive 
for the 300 000 plus years.

Its possible in GT, almost.  The life extension healing discipline can 
reduce
aging rate by a factor of about 50, given sufficient power or skill (roll vs
power+skill-10).  Only a minor extension from there to a full immortality.

I am glad that GURPS rules provide an explaination for immortality.  Let\'s 
hope its formula is safely locked away in some Ancient site less someone use 
it to become the next super race.

	I have only worked with Traveller Book 2 (of the LBB\'s) and 
	HG2, but I have to say that Book 2 seems to be underrated. 
	For ship design, it is limited (particularly for gearheads),
	but it is also simple. One trait that I like is that it is
	generaly easier (barely) to design small high-G ships than
	large ones. This makes much more sense than the HG2 rules
	that require the same proportion of tonnage to accelerate a
	500,000 ton ship at 2G as a 100 ton ship (the engine may 
	fit the HG2 formula, but I expect that the bracing would 
	not). That said, HG2 offers flexibility, variety, and TL
	efficiencies, so that\'s what I use for design (with a few
	tweaks). HG2 is good for large scale battles, but for 99.9%
	of the combat IMTU I use the Book 2 rules tweaked to cover
	HG2 systems. I find that it has a good "feel" and keeps the
	players involved.

The basic problem is that it takes a _lot_ of LHd to significantly cool down a battlesuit.  Getting 400 kilos of metal from room temperature down to freezing is going to require a minimum of several hundred liters of LHd, and given that the effects of hydrogen boiling off the suit will tend to drive away the cold hydrogen gas, probably more on the order of 2-3 cubic meters of LHd.

    'body' => 'The Gravitic Revolution: a Quick Overview
                       by Henri-Darraanu Mushura

Can you imagine what life was like before contragrav? If you\'ve lived on a
TL 7 planet, you don\'t have to imagine. All those tightly packed cities,
everything linked by paved streets and roads, the buildings huddled right
up against each other. This must have been what Terran cities were like in
the age before contragrav, so many centuries ago...
     Historians tell us that the Terrans acquired contragrav technology by
reverse-engineering captured Vilani ships during the 1st Interstellar War,
probably around IY-2407 (2114CE).  With the end of the war in -2404, the
technology became available to the general public. Civil gravitics hit
Terra like a near-overdose of adrenalin. The entire aerospace industry was
radically restructured, while a financial panic bankrupted many airlines,
aircraft manufacturers, and ground vehicle companies. Famous for its
groundcars, the nation of Detroit was particularly hard hit. Governments
had to scramble to write legal frameworks for the new technology. Meanwhile
the per-kilogram cost of reaching orbit dropped like a rock, triggering an
explosion of space development. Suddenly everybody and her sister could get
into orbit, cheap.
     Traffic-guiding roadgrids, already in place on city streets, were
extended into the air, making possible the civil gravitics revolution.
Without skygrid control, chaos would reign in the skies -- as it often does
on a number gridless frontier worlds where grav vehicles are allowed. (Most
planets that lack skygrids put strict limits on all flying vehicles over
urban areas, sometimes banning civil gravitics outright.)

_Contragrav Hits Home:_ When contragrav became widely available on Terra,
exurban growth exploded. The already-blurry definition between "rural" and
"urban" began to disappear, as commuters were no longer limited to crawling
along roads. With a gravcar in your garage, you might as well live 300
kilometers from your workplace, if the travel time was the same as before.
     Grav vehicles accellerated the trend toward urban decentralization
that had started with the invention of the internal-combustion engine, a
century and a half earlier. The groundcar created the suburbs, sucking
economic activity from the downtown cores, relocating capital to the new
Edge Cities. Contragrav renewed some central cores, making them easier to
reach. It also solved a surprisingly serious problem: finding places to
park. (Grav cars required no expensive parking structures, and could be
floated in parking zones, safe from vandals and thieves.) But the only
downtowns that survived were those that boasted unique cultural attractions
- -- arts centres, galleries, clubs, festivals, anything that could not be
found in the Edge Cities. Other central districts, already suffering from
urban decay and the effects of the automobile, collapsed completely,
becoming ghost towns and gang-plagued war-zones.
     Groundcars had also altered family life. They gave teenagers
unprecedented mobility, and transformed sexual mores by providing mobile
trysting-places. Like the roadgrid-controlled groundcars that preceded
them, grav vehicles did not require a driver, so teens no longer needed to
wait until legal driving age before asking for the car keys. Parents
quickly learned to order the car to pick up the kids at school, or drive
them to the mall. Soon millions of teens and children had complete
vehicular freedom, further stretching the already frayed family bonds of
that era. Laws were passed to ensure that kids below a certain age were
always accompanied by a responsible elder, but there was little agreement
on what that "certain age" should be. Even today, the minimum
solo-passenger age varies from world to world, sometimes as high as 14
years, often as low as 5. Yet these are among the most commonly abused laws
applying to gravitic travel. Whatever the local statutes say, sending the
car to pick up the kids is now a near-universal practice. As a result, kids
and teens on many Tech Level 10+ worlds tend to have far more autonomy than
those who live at lower Tech Levels.

_The Boom of Falling Borders:_ Economically, contragrav triggered one of
the greatest boom-times in history. World trade grew at an incredible rate
for nearly a century after the introduction of gravitic cargo shipping.
Poor nations, previously hamstrung by lack of seaports or adequate road
networks, were suddenly as accessible as any wealthy region. The boom
produced a wave of prosperity that helped mitigate some of the disastrous
after-effects of global warming, which had raised sea levels and left
billions of people homeless.
     With the cost of global travel dropping rapidly, tourism leapt to
unheard-of levels. Global Heritage Sites and ecologically sensitive
wilderness zones were threatened by trampling hoards of gawkers, until
stringent measures were taken. Popular destinations soon required bookings
years in advance.  Scenic parks and eco-preserves issued entry permits and
banned low-level overflights.
     Where ground vehicles had started to blur national boarders,
contragrav began to wipe the lines completely off the map. Together with
the global comm-net, gravitics helped create the world governments that
have been the norm on most planets ever since. The Imperium\'s official
language, Galanglic, has its roots in the period of linguistic and cultural
fusion that followed the Terran gravitic revolution. In reaction to the
cultural homogenization of Terra, numerous nationalist movements sprang up,
fighting for their cultural survival.  Many of these groups took advantage
of the newly inexpensive access to orbit, and founded "monocultural" space
habitats and, inevitably, far-ranging interstellar colonies.
     As a result of increasing global intermarriage, the height of the
average human grew by four centimetres in a period of only fifty years.
Meanwhile, grav ambulances and air-mobile medical facilities improved
medical care around the world. But global travel also created health
hazards: infectious diseases could spread more rapidly than ever before.
Deadly international outbreaks of filovirus, Honolulu flu, and prionic
paralysis were all linked to the widespread use of grav vehicles.
     Combined with instant media coverage of breaking news stories,
contragrav created the strange phenomenon known as "flashcrowds." A rapid
congregation of many thousands of people almost anywhere on the planet
could be triggered by the sighting of a reclusive celebrity, reports of
religious miracles, major accidents, natural disasters, or by any other
newsworthy event. A related phenomenon was the "flashtown," an unplanned
accretion of gravitic mobile homes and RV\'s. Flashtowns might attract tens
of thousands of grav-nomads, only to disperse within days or weeks.

_Into the Gravitic Age:_  With traffic filling up the skylanes, architects
and designers faced new challenges. Landing pads and garages appeared on
rooftops, while personal entrances and embarkation balconies became popular
features for high-rise apartments (especially after the introduction of
grav-belts). Large buildings required sensors, hazard lights, and comm
systems integrated with the local skygrid. New security measures became
necessary, to deal with gravbelted burglars. No longer safe from prying
eyes, high rise dwellers hid themselves behind reflective glass or
polarizing windows.
     Privacy issues also caused civil rights activists to decry the use of
skygrids for surveillance of the populace. Laws were enacted to control
government access to skygrid and roadgrid records, and to keep unscrupulous
companies from analysing the movements of consumers for marketing profile
purposes. Unfortunately, not every world has adopted such laws, so
travellers are cautioned to inquire about local privacy protections before
leaving any starport. Similar threats to privacy were posed by gravitic
surveillance devices, such as small and discreet camera drones. Activists
became concerned about the use of these drones by enforcement and security
agencies, not to mention nosy journalists and paparazzi.
     Almost as soon as civil contragrav was introduced, gravitic sports
were born. Grav racing, grav-aerobatics, and gravbelt skydiving were
instant sensations, and are still popular today. The arts were not far
behind in adopting the technology, with the development of gravsculpture,
aerial installations, and various forms of G-dance.
     Today, gravitics are so ubiquitous as to be nearly invisible. We can
only begin to appreciate the full impact of the gravitic revolution only by
spending time on some TL7-or-less backwater world. Roughing it can be quite
an adventure, living the way our ancestors did, driving groundstreets
without an autopilot, taking your life in your own hands every time you sit
behind the controls.
     But what a relief to get back home to the old gravcar, and take to the
skies once again!

Canonically, air/rafts are limited to 100kph (according to the LBBs, anyway). I
suggest changing this figure to 150 kilometers. But then, I\'m in Calgary, where
45 minutes in rush hour gets me anywhere in the city.

Hmmm. A parking "lot" for air/rafts would have to be able to deal with air/rafts
that unexpectedly power down and crash. With groundcars, if you can\'t start the
car, you call a tow truck. Your neighbors in the parking lot aren\'t
inconvenienced. Imagine your air/raft, parked above 200 others, failing.

Also consider the effects of severe weather, especially winds. Sudden wind gales
may not be handled correctly by these stacks of cars, resulting in cars drifting
away, never to be seen again by their owners (unless the side of a building
conveniently interferes).

As for thieves, I wouldn\'t underestimate their ingenuity. With air/rafts worth
hundreds of thousands of credits at least (LBBs again), thieves will definitely
find a way to get to them. If the owner is able to either float up to his
air/raft, or call his air/raft down, a determined thief will be able to
accomplish both of these activities somehow.

You\'re going to get a different answer from every single person you ask.
People who like HG will point out the advantages of being able to create any
size ship without heavy rulebook consultation and without a calculator.  The
more gearheaded of the TNE players will swear by Fire, Fusion and Steel, the
\'equipment factory\' book that allows virtually anything to be designed or
ballparked. Then the GURPS people will extol FFS2 with its pre-packaged
modular components and multi-tiered design systems.

Personally, well, it doesn\'t really matter what I personally prefer. You\'re
not me. Use whichever works for you.

I seem to remember reading this somewhere but I can\'t remember where.  Do
you know where this is stated in any of the books?  Having the drive active
does explain why you can\'t perform jumpdrive maintenance during the weeks
journey.  That bothered me in my rational of the jump drive performing the
insert into jumpspace and then shutting down.

Yes, but ... aren\'t grav vehicles a little expensive for a "chicken in

a piece (and this in a society with an average yearly wage of 10 kCr).

Or do I mis-remember?

Either way, I\'m Bruce with this article. It was very good. :-)

Megatraveller, with minor modifications (especially errata inclusion).

Good level of detail, not too much, not too little.  Design system which,
when highly automated (with a spreadsheet for example) can produce designs
while I\'m on the phone hashing out the design philosophy.  Wide TLs
accomodated (though not as many as I\'d like, TL8-9 spaceships are pretty
hard to come up with, as are TL18+).

There\'s also a good proportion of published material consistent with the
design system.  The combat system can be used for combat between different
categories of craft (i.e. tank vs. starship, bicycle vs. dreadnought),
though its not perfect.

Drawbacks; Errors in published material.  Weapons are of fixed size,
generally, rather than being designable as in TNE\'s FF&S.  Combat system
for ships is not granular enough for me in terms of damage to
subassemblies.  The Science and Fiction are balanced, rather than being
"hard" science (reactionless thrusters and some other technologies being
objectionable to some from a hard SF standpoint, understandably).

As another poster said, there are many opinions.  None are really more
"correct" than others.

If I wanted ease of use, I\'d use High Guard (and striker for vehicles!).
If I wanted miniscule details I\'d use FF&S.  If I wanted to chuck
everything I knew about the Traveller Universe and start from near scratch,
I\'d use GURPS (sorry, opinion came through there).  If I wanted starship
combat to be the focus, I\'d adapt Starfleet Battles.  I would not use T5,
since I don\'t own FF&S2.

Viliani use High Guard because its traditional.

Solomani use T4 to conform to the latest standard.

Aslan use FF&S (TNE) since they can design everything the way they like it,
down to the trigger guard.

Hivers use Megatraveller so they can influence the designs from behind the
scenes by substituting different bug fixes.

Vargr use GURPS, wanna make something out of it?

Construction:

1) High Guard 2nd Edition (CT Bk 5)
2) QSDS 1.5 (using Rob Prior\'s Software)
3) GT (using Rob Prior\'s Software)

Dislikes -

1)FFS2 (bad layout and no real translation to game turns because IG never
got a starship combat system together - not the author\'s fault). Andy Akins
spreadsheet does make things easier.
2) MT (overly complicated compared to High Guard)

Combat

1) RPSCSv0.9 (on the Missouri Archive) coupled with T4.1
2) High Guard 2 (possibly with MayDay)
3) Battle Rider

but above all these is the mighty 2300AD Star Cruiser. Shame about the
buckets of Dice...

Dislikes -

1) The T4 system (a broken version of HG2)
2) Brilliant Lances - great in theory, but slooooooooooooooooooow.

	Where does it cover this in CT? The first time that I heard of

	I have always assumed that one of the engineer\'s duties during
	the week in jumpspace is to perform maintainance on the jump
	drive (and the maneuver drive, and monitor the power plant, and
	repair sundry systems such as lights and doors, and monitor the

For construction, I prefer Mega as expanded in Challenge (_Wet Navy_,
_Wood, Wind, Steam and Steel_) and Hard Times (Small Steps) . I don\'t mind
the idea of adding a surface area limitation ala FF&S, nor the additions of
flight and maintenance computers.

For combat, I use the MT personal combat system! (use the fire control
tables, and the stats as listed in the Player\'s manual). Personally, I find
this to be the most realistic (albeit also very close ranged) set-up.

I dislike TNE/FF&S1/BL\'s damage and armor rules.

I don\'t use T4 at all. If t5 is the patched T4 mark has been discussing, I
simply won\'t bother. FF&S2 has some nice stuff, but it is simply TOO
cumbersome a book to work with.

I don\'t particularly care for gurps except for fantasy or (modern horror).
GT is a good adaptation in and of itself, but is too far from my roots in
CT mechanically.

One small exception to increase of heat by adding energy: Laser Cooling

Its unclear.  However, a reasonable argument can be made for fuel skimming rate and fuel purification rates to be identical (a large part of \'fuel purification\' is probably simply liquifying the hydrogen)

Because it looks cool?  Reactionless thrusters produce \'mysterious blue glow\', of course.

Easiest answer: there is a significant heat (or other energy) signature from 
use of the reactionless drives, it\'s beneficial to put them outside the ship
and direct them (the "nozzles") somewhat, it makes starport and other
close operations safer. Reference CT LBB Supp 9, Fighting Ships, reason

I assume you would do basic maintenance checks on the jump drive and monitor
that it was within tolerances.  I guess you could do allot of overhaul work
on the maneuver drive (Except where the systems might interact, poss. fuel
delivery & power?) and such as they would be shut down.  There is a
reference in the basic rules in CT & T4, in the area where you calculate
travel time, that says that although a jump takes ~1 Week most ships only
jump 1 every 2 weeks and spend the 2nd week doing cargo, shore-leave, and
maintenance on the jump drive.

True, but it\'s quite good for roleplaying battles, when the times passes
slowly anyway and the players tend to be in a small ship.

One thing it may work really well for is PBEM battles. Pin it to the wall,
alter it over the course of a couple weeks..... The time factor really seems
to fade out.

The problem is that the suit will conduct the electricity *around* the
wearer, not thru the suit itself. The circuitry will be quite safe. If
you could run enough current, then you might be able to bake the
wearer. Except that you\'ll never conduct *that* sort of amperage via
water streams!

Sorry, but that\'s not even *theoretically* possible. "Heat" is high
entropy energy. Electricity is *low* entropy. The laws of
thermodynamics say that you can\'t produce low entropy from high
entropy.

What you *can* do is seperate a "system into a low entropy part and a
very high entropy part. But when you "sum" the entropies in question,
the result will be *bigger than what you started with. 

That\'s how a refrigerator works. It cools one area at the expense of
making another much, much hotter.

You can pump the heat from A into B. But you wind up with a lot *more*
heat than you started with. In fact, if you include the power source,
you *haven\'t* gained any ground.

Actually the "forbbden velocity" is the speed of light IN A VACUUM.
Since the speed you are talking about was in a *non*-vacuum, it doesn\'t

Nope, the T4.x/T5 people will extol FFS2, GURPS Gearheads use GURPS
Vehicles 2nd Ed, which is <shudder> in American (not even Imperial)
units.... Traveller is a metric game, and the thought of using American
units makes me feel really uncomfortable; I hope T5 doesn\'t abandon metric.

Amen to that, as the old acronym goes, YTUMV. I was surprised to see so much
mixing of rules systems though, does this require lots of house rules type
tweaking? or are the various systems highly compliant? I only have CT and
love the systems open nature. Would other supplements from other systems
compliment High Guard? Which in the groups diverse opinions melds most
seemlessly with CT? I have already determined that GT First In is next on my
shopping list, what would be good to get for starships?

There\'s one set of opinions, leading me towards FF&S. I have never heard of

Very amusing, but it also brings up an interesting point. How much does the
texture of an individual regions technology affect the design process? I
like the way CT handles the advance of tech and hull config modifiers, could
a system like that handle variable construction systems? Just debate bait.

	Even as an American who uses American units for everyday things, I\'ve 
got to agree.  Traveller is and always has been metric, and it just feels 
wrong in GT when American units are used instead of metric.

It\'s a very old (and VERY complex) game by Amarillo Design Bureau, used to
be marketted through Task Force Games. It\'s based on the original series
Star Trek with some modifications and the focus is very heavily detailed
tactical ship combat. You can;t design ships, but there are some 800
available and the combat is so complex you don\'t need to. Personally, I love
the game. Rules-haters tend to loathe it - it takes up about two feet on a
bookshelf.

FFS doesn\'t - yet.  There\'s a TNE-RCES gearhead project underway to solve

Note: it isn\'t the lack of contragrav that makes  buildings close
together.  If anything, you need more space between them for ground
vehicle access.  With contragrav, the distance between buildings
will be dictated by light and space considerations only.

I think this is unlikely too.  There is still going to be limited
space for individual cars, even over 3D.  We already have cities
that have commuter traffic by several factors, contragrav isn\'t
going to change that.

If the commuter can reach the car to get it back, so can a thief.
(Remember, history teaches that if you think you have a scheme to
render a crime impossible, odds are you are wrong).  They will
also be vulnerable to bad weather, bird crap, etc. (not to mention
the inconvenience of getting up to them.  Nor is
the cost of construction the main issue on parking garages, it is
the space they use.

[I didn\'t have time for the rest, it looked OK.  I guess I don\'t see
gravitics as being so much a revolution as an evolution.]

IMHO:

It also has nothing to do with Traveller (sub-second turns, FTL combat
speeds, none of the weapons are the same and neither Newton nor Einstein
had any influence over the movement system).

However, it is fundamentally a very simple system.

What makes it complex is that each new race had their own technologies
with their own special rules and instead of leaving huge gaps in the
rules, the designers tried to cover everything.

Oh and then they added rules for stuff that doesn\'t need to be there
(eg boarding actions taking less than 1 centisecond) that open up
major problems (if I have a bomb I can transport in front of you,
why can\'t I put it inside your ship instead of a squad of marines?)

I used to think it was a good game. Now I just think that there\'s
a good game in there somewhere... unfortunately, I think that game
is a World War I naval game. :-]

Just because they are reactionless, doesn\'t mean they don\'t
have an exhaust in the direction of thrust.  It just means
the exhuast isn\'t the direct cause of the thrust.

Several canon and DGP-canon sources have thrusters producing large amounts
of heat and light.  Hence the big nozzeloids on the rear ends of ships.

Sorry, is someone asking what _rules_ Vargr _prefer_?  I would have thought
the answer would be obvious - every referee has their own, and players who
don\'t like them find a new ref.

Droyne, on the other hand, design their ships by selecting components
randomly.  Mysteriously, it always fits together.....

The Darrians haven\'t designed a ship since 1980, but they were TL 16.  (But
there were no rules for TL 16 ships then....)

Geonee use ships someone else designed, long long ago.

Serious answer:  I actually very rarely design ships, or run space combats
that get beyond free-form chases, and a shot across the bows.  If I do, I
use HG2.  I\'ve always intended to play some Mayday, with funky missiles and
stuff, but I\'ve never quite got round to it.

I do have a plan to do some serious designing in the future, to create some
Imperial Naval ships from the Civil War (TL D, mostly).  These will mainly
be cut down versions of the ships in Supplement 9:  Fighting Ships, which
are mainly TL F.  This Supplement is interesting, since it\'s actually still
the best resource for Imperial Naval vessels we have, as Shattered Ships of
the Fighting Imperium sucked bigtime.

Supplement 9 is an HG2 book, so my Civil War ships will end up as HG2
designs, which is fine by me.

Preference and logic reinforce themselves, in this case.

Sure enough does... it bends the course of light. Which is how gravity
lensing occurs. Not a bloody great effect, but it is known (and artificial
gravity is used under FF&S to attain the ranges allowed under BL/FF&S1, by
using gravitic lensing to narrow the beam).

I\'ve generally explained it as Fusion byproduct, illuminated by the
cerenkov radiation from the T-Plates. And, to explain the high fuel rates
under CT, I xplained it as used lots of surplus as a coolant for all the

It developed several points which would indicate that grav vehicles would be 
both relatively common and affordable.

1)  They use solid state technology and advanced materials that result in a 
long life coupled with low maintenance.  Where modern cars tend to hang in 
there for ten years or so, barring a wreck most grav vehicles are good for 
several times that long, with century old vehicles being not uncommon.

2)  The 100K figure cited in the original books was the price for a "loaded" 
version obtimised for frontier use.  Smaller, more basic vehicles could be 
obtained for less.

3)  As a side effect of the long life of grav vehicles, it is likely that a 
thriving market would arise in used vehicles.  As is the case today, used 
equals less expensive, but probably very functional.

4)  Last, the economic effect.  If a vehicle will probably function for 
decades, lenders will be glad to extend payment periods proprtionally, in 
return for a security interest in the vehicle.  Grav vehicles were described 
as often being financed with terms similar to modern mortgages, over twenty 
or thirty years where required.

As a point in the finances, I\'m currently driving a Mazda Miata.  I\'m gladly 
paying about $22000 spread over six years and will get a vehicle with an 
expected life of about ten years, twenty with heavy maintenance.  If I could 
get a vehicle costing five times as much, but likely to be usable for five 
times as long PLUS all the advantages that gravitics would give, I\'d be 
foolish not to make the financial commitment to obtain one.

Well, we know from CT that a K\'Kree "stateroom" is some 25 Td, and that
Droyne Staterooms are half size.

Under Striker/CT Zhodani frequently rely upon fewer sensors, but use
clairavoyance trained armor officers.

Under MT, admitedly from DGP\'s S&A, Solomani avoid grav vehicles,
preferring GEV , Wheeled, and tracked for most purposes.

Aslan designs tend to have rounded, flowing exterior curves and poems
artistically presented, but effectively standard.

Hivers (based upon the CT alien module) tend to use lots of computerized
and remote vehicles.

In my game the term "reactionless" is a misnomer.  While they 
are able to nudge a ship along w/o releasing any exhaust, the 
secret of the drive is that it makes traditional "thrusters" have 
several orders of magnitude more effect than our current laws 
of physics would allow.  Physics impaired handwave?  You bet.

Ah, but an air/raft is an open-topped cow of a vehicle. Just about any
enclosed grav vehicle can do better than that, while a luxury gravcar such
as Greg Porter\'s Rolen Politesse (CSC, pg 86) does 745kph unloaded, 668 kph
fully loaded. Of course, your neighbours are likely to complain about the
constant sonic booms ;)

Not half as serious a problem as grav vehicles that unexpectedly power down
and crash *while in flight*. Presumably their systems are redundant enough,
and fault-tolerant enough, not to do this.

I suspect that sudden gales of wind are nothing compared to the forces a
*flying* grav vehicle has to compensate for. In any case, a parking zone
might have tethers for the vehicles (a provide backup power if necessary).
Alternatively, instead of parking, cars could be left to fly around in
holding patterns, at least where skygrids are in use, returning to their
owners when called for. In a city such as Atafu (described in part 1 of my
article), a large portion of the sky traffic might consist of *empty*
vehicles, flying \'round and \'round the "block", waiting for their owners to
need them again. Thanks to tiny fusion plants, such weirdness is probably
commonplace.

Mind you, parking space is only a problem in high-density cities, and most
TL10+ cities in the Imperium would be extremely spread out uber-suburbs, as
I began to sketch out in Part 2.  Atafu is only high-density because the
atmosphere outside the tent is tainted.

Where the skygrid and roadgrid control all the vehicles, stealing a car
would indeed require a lot of ingenuity. I wouldn\'t say it\'s impossible,
but besides spoofing the car\'s security system, they\'d have to somehow hide
their tracks, i.e. the skygrid\'s tracking data.

Still, put some unscrupulous PCs on the job, and I\'m sure a method would be
found :)

You *could* build a city as one vast structure, but you probably wouldn\'t
want to. You\'d only do it if local conditions required -- such as vacuum
worlds, or other hostile environments. I suspect that a rebirth of
communalism might be necessary *before* megastructure cities got built at
all, rather than being a consequence of them.

Cities tend to grow haphazardly and piecemeal -- a suburb development here,
a transport project there; they evolve and grow over time, by necessity.
Building a whole city all at once seems unlikely to me. Centrally-planned
cities such as Brasilia have been total disasters because cities are really
complex organisms.

Of course, given the number of people living in hostile conditions in the
Traveller universe, these are challenges that Imperial Megacorporations
have probably evolved solutions for. Major colonization projects might
involve the construction of very large structures all at once.

Which means a good number of Imperial citizens are living in vacuum-sealed
equivalents of Brasilia. Scary thought.

Hmm, let\'s see. From the Traveller Book:
- ----
Air/Raft (Open topped, TTL 8!): kCr 600

From MT Imperial Encyclopedia:
- ----
TTL 15 open-top air/raft: kCr 275
TTL 15 enclosed air/raft: kCr 389

From DGP\'s 101 Vehicles:
- ----
TTL 12 Casline G-Tube (described as "essentially an enclosed
   grav belt for two"): kCr 342
TTL 12 Trasea grav bike: kCr 171.6
TTL 13 Wanderer air bus: kCr 997.6
TTL 13 Planet Hopper grav sedan: MCr 2.6334
TTL 15 Hegira Enclosed air/raft: kCr 389

From TNE:
- ----
TTL 10 air/raft (open): kCr 146.602
TTL 12 enclosed air/raft: kCr 267.754
TTL 15 grav bike: kCr 63

Alas, I have no T4 items, except for a 102 Vehicles by Robert Prior:
- ----
TTL 15 Arden aircar: kCr 37.4
TTL 15 Econobox aircar: kCr 3.168

From GT:
- ----
GTL 12 air/raft, open topped: kCr 55.16

The prices have seemed to have dropped dramatically as Traveller has gone
through its various iterations. If 102 Vehicles is any sign, gravitic
vehicles have gotten downright inexpensive.

So I suppose it depends on what version of the Traveller universe you play
in. ;-)

Using American units (which didn\'t start in America by the way) makes
Americans nervous.  Try this-ask an American how many cups are in a

  Also, at least under HG2, if the J-drive requires constant input of 
250MW (=1 EP) per 100 Dt per J-number throughout Jump then there\'s no
real opportunity for weaselling a ship that doesn\'t require a power

 True. The great powerplant revolution that happened between MT and TNE
has something to do with that.  One thing to note about the examples you list
is the capabilities. The CT vanilla Air/Raft was slow and had a rather limited
range. By comparison the MT models were mostly much faster and longer
ranged. None of the MT vehicle designers ever went back and matched the
original that I know of...

    'body' => 'I\'m going to have a problem describing how ship\'s turret lasers work to my
players. I hope someone on the TML with more knowledge of these systems can help
me. It comes about because of some of the KKM discussion about two weeks ago.

My problem is this:
Someone posted that missiles could not be shielded from point defense laser fire
because both reflective and ablative shielding reacts *explosively* when hit by
a point defense laser. I understand this, and I don\'t have a problem with this
part.

However, the same person later on said that point defense lasers could engage
multiple targets (without taking time to move the turret to line them up)
because it used a targeting mirror system.
Now - this - I have a problem with. Why doesn\'t the targeting mirror (like the
shielding) react explosively to the beam? Just what is the mirror supposed to be
made of?

Now; I know that artificial gravity can be used to focus a laser beam, but can
someone tell me if it can be used to REFLECT the beam? Is that possible? If so,
could it be used as a targeting mirror for a laser, or does this open up another
can of worms. Your thoughts are welcome.

A while ago I posted the Gosling class air/raft, which was built under FFS2
at TL6/9. It had pretty basic electronics, and came in at about KCr 35. It
had an alcohol IC engine, with a battery/solar array option.

Unfortunatly I lost the design when my hard drive crashed. Could some nice
person pull it out of an archive and re-post it (hint).

Most of the designs in published sources are horribly gold-plated. Annual
income in the Traveller universe is KCr 8-20 depending on TL and stuff, so
a KCr 200 grav car just isnt going to be a consumer item.

I\'m not convinced. Hits on jets don\'t slowly degrade capability.
Also, if I lose my port side weapons and port side shield, the
inability to correct this by half rolling seems like a naval ship
problem (most naval ships can\'t half roll and keep fighting;-)

Actually, the rules total lack of consideration for inertia makes
them unsuitable for sea, air or space. They\'re probably most accurate
for land movement (although having the brakes come on automatically
when you take your foot off the accelerator is a bit odd).

    OK, so basicly, you had an Air/Raft built on a TL9 world, that was just
a frame & drive units, & then it would be shipped off to a TL6 world for the
rest of the stuff?

    Ian the way I see it, at TL9, an air/raft should cost 200 KCr, as it is
new technology & only the rich can afford them, but at TL10 it should cost
50 KCr & the middle class can afford them, as the technology is more stable
& more people are building them.  By TL11 or TL12 they should cost around 20
KCr & most people have them.  Then by TL15, they should cost around 5 KCr
each.  Note, this is assumming that you are building them to the TL9
standard, if at TL11 or TL12 you build it at TL11 or TL12 standards, it
should cost 200 KCr.
    The reason I say this, is that as technology gets older & older, it
costs less & less.  Look at the Groundcar.  When it first came out at TL5,
only the rich & powerful could own one, but today at TL7 or TL8, almost
anyone can buy a ground car.  So it makes sense to me that the same thing
wil happen with Air/Rafts.  As the Technology gets older & more stable &
understood, the price will come down for them.
    The same thing should happen with Ships.  Say at TL9 a Free Trader will
cost you 37 MCr.  At TL11 or 12, it should cost around 3.7 MCr, & by TL15,
it should cost about 1 MCr.  As the technology gets older, more people will
also start to do it, & as more people do it, the output will increase, as
output increases the price goes down.  Also, at TL15, a TL9 Ship is not a
big deal.  If were going to by a TL15 Free Trader, it should cost you 37
MCr.
    I know this is not a canon idea, but it works IMTU.

Do your vehicle designs age? Or are the designs static over the course of

Plans for a given vehicle/ship/weapon system ought to *age* over time; the
design should become better with time, even if the last design change was
only aesthetic or comfort based. Options change; what was standard a few
years ago may go out of style or be replaced by something perceived as
better.

When you design you next ship, keep your first design iteration (unless it
*really* stinks) and call it your intial production model. Go through a few
iterations and keep another upgrade to the existing model. Change a few
components, switch a few options around. Your Scout/Courier really shouldn\'t
be the same as the one next you on the apron (exterior excepting).

First the Blair Witch Project, now penguins (whimper).  A few weeks ago, I
had a family on the van who had several Furbies. The damn things kept
"hearing" my radio, and trying to talk to it, which would set them all off.
 After ten minutes of this (I\'m kind of hard of hearing, and when I hear
murmuring behind me I assume it\'s a guest trying to tell me something) I
stopped the van and ordered the bloody little things either turned off or
put away in bags.  You\'d have thought that I ordered them to skin kittens.

Give a Free Trader a load of 80 tons of Furbyoids, and find out that they
get activated by the energizing of the jump field.  Now these are TL-15

I can imagine.  People tend to think furbies are almost human.  Course, some 
of the \'people\' I know (and I use the term \'people\' loosely here...), I\'d say 
they\'re *more* human.

IIRC, Grandfather\'s immortality is due to a psionic talent of his ("Awareness") at high level.  He\'s maxxed out as a psi.

My question is, if Grandfather was at TL35+ at the time of the Final War (300,000 years ago), what TL is he at *now*?  Can he just mutter a magic word and make us all disappear or something?  Would we recognise his current bunch of artifacts *as* artifacts?  *COULD* we recognise them as artifacts?

Consider:  Take a transistor.  Strip off its case and clip the leads.  Now hand it to an engineer with TL4 or TL5 technology at his disposal.  Remember, he\'s never *seen* a transistor, and barely knows much electronics theory.  For all intents and purposes, our low tech engineer is holding a piece of fused sand.  Would he recognise it as a device?  Not likely.  To him, it\'s just a piece of sand that got melted together somehow.

Good point, controls may be easier to use, gauge placement improved, 8-way 
adjustable electric seats instead of 6-way adjustable in the earlier models. 
  That 8-track player in your 40 year old air raft may not do you any good 
if you can\'t find any 8-tracks to play.

My question is, if Grandfather was at TL35+ at the time of the Final War
(300,000 years ago), what TL is he at *now*?  Can he just mutter a magic
word and make us all disappear or something?  Would we recognise his current
bunch of artifacts *as* artifacts?  *COULD* we recognise them as artifacts?
- ----

Beyond a certain tech level, you\'d have to be able to alter reality/universe
on a macroscopic level.  Tech level ceases to be of use as to a gauge of
know-how.  Grandfather already knows how to pinch off tiny universes.  The
next step is to create his own or re-create the one he was born in.

Realistically speaking, I think that by the time we have reached the tech
level needed for an average Traveller universe, human beings would have
self-evolved into something much different and no longer needing a lot of
the things they\'d need if still human.

What is Grandfather up to?  He\'s most likely gotten bored with creating
pocket universes and has evolved himself ont a higher plain of existence.

Maybe such a realization is the reason why so many ancient gods

The Vilani have lived such a communalist lifestyle for millenia, so I
suspect that arcologies are common in Vilani or Vilani influenced

    On HIPop worlds, I think the arcology idea would be a popular one, on
anyworld, not just Vilani worlds.  As for MedPop, MedTL worlds, again I
think that the arcology would also be used.  And, the 3I would use it to
house its civil servents.

It\'s not.  Its 28.35.  I know cups to a gallon by a simple case:

Actually you are both wrong.  The earth isn\'t a circle, it\'s real lumpy. ;)

Anyhow.  To truly answer such a question requires a research grant funding
my team for at least 4 years. (At the end of which we will consult Worldbook
and guess at the answer.)

Problem would be that the moties would/could not be contained that way, as

hide away and multiply...

Hot lead from my barrel,

I need a blanket for my bed.

That sounds quite a cool idea - I saw something a while ago doing something

I would like a HG like system in T5. YMMV.

My thoughts on metric are influenced by being born post-metrification here
in the UK. Only real items left now are miles (fuel is now sold in litres),
and feet and inches for height.

Older people may vary ;-)

Nick Munn (some list Great Old Ones will remember him) did a ballpark
design for Ton Vorn, the Sylean orbital city which is huge! Although Grav
Tech was possible, as it probably started pre-TL12, we discussed and
decided to base it on rotational pseudo-grav, with some newer parts grav
plated. The assumption was that people would be more secure with a familar
technology. If you get a power outage it would cause massive problems...

But they\'re a bastardisation of the original English (imperial) system with

T4 Central Supply Catalog p.63 has a note that Grav Vehicles are an order
of magnitude smaller in that edition because:

1) Fusion+ gives smaller, cheaper, more effective power plants.
2) Contragrav (MT Antigrav) is cheaper.

It suggests multiplying the cost of vehicles by 10 to give an old style
Traveller feel.

It also says p.65 that the visible blue-white effect (glow) from thrusters
and contragrav is a result of \'gravitic decay byproducts\'.

Maybe such a realization is the reason why so many ancient gods
are thought of as insane, or at least lead mere mortals to madness.
   I think this insanity theory is bang on.  One should not discount that 
Grandfather maybe was a little mad to begin with (certainly by Droyne) 
standards.  Therefore, after trying for milennia to escape this prison 
(madness) he created has consigned himself to remorse and not to play 
demigod.  Which leads us back to the form that Grandfather assumes.  A 
corporeal form leads to madness...a non-coporeal form is impossible.  Hence, 
my invention a stored form.  As a being who will have mastered psionic 
talent with technology surely he has transfered a part of his Self into a 
machine enity.  At same time, senses and ventures out into the universe 
every so often.  Or it could be an experiment in Antimatter flows has 
transformed him into an Antimatter being not allowing him to escape his 
pocket universe.  I know, it has been done before.
  As to idea of what TL is grandfather is now...mistake is to see science as 
an abstract activity that an individual comes up with science, I believe 
with others, science is a social phenomena.  Where are Grandfather\'s peers, 
not servants?  I eluded that in Grandfather\'s time there were beings more 
advanced than the Ancients.  Where have they gone?  Perhaps, they are 
amongst us and we do not know it.  My theory is that they reside beyond 
Charted Space.  The Solomani may yet bring something nasty back when they 
have emarked on their Persus missions.

Yeah, I agree most of makes little sense. The timing is way out of whack,
and the physics....well, let\'s just leave the physics well alone. But it was
never billed as a game with any pretence at realism. It was based on Star
Trek, the show where the definition of physics is "any three long words
containing the syllable \'phase\' that save the ship and explain the plot", so
I suppose that was inevitable.

But I think it\'s kinda fun. If I want realism and hard science then I\'ll
play Brilliant Lances. Maybe even without gravity focussing.

Nah, you don\'t let them near the hexmap (you think I\'d let a *player* touch
my beloved maps?). They each roleplay out their positions, (if the captain\'s
a PC and you\'re feeling nice you can let him move his counter) but you, the

a \'tactical sensor display\'.

Well, it works for me. YMMV, of course.

design is generally not "complete" without a picture and/or deckplan of some 
sort. For those who have not tried, deckplans take far longer than the number 
crunching of design. This is why there are relatively few Gearheads who do 
them. A simple spreadsheet or design program will allow several variations of 
a design in a hour or less, while a week might be needed to produce one 
useable set of plans.
 On the design side, I tend to work up a spreadsheet to aid in calculations 
for whatever system I\'m using, but I like to have the book(s) open in front 
of me to do actual design work. Thus, even in this CAD era, I\'m still 
sensitive about a well laid out book and easy to use rules. My preferences 
are thus HG, MT, FF&S1, and QSDS, not necessarily in that order. I\'ll use 
FF&S2, SSDS, BL or Book 2 if I need to for a particular project, but I prefer 
not. Given my current needs, QSDS fleshed out to TL15 and with masses added, 
and more of the "you don\'t know anything so we\'ll tell you" type of text 
added would be ideal.
 As for layout (if Marc is listening) put the tables either in the text (like 
Book 2 or QSDS) or cluster them like High Guard: In the CENTER of their 
appropriate text section. A book like FF&S2 should have had three or four 
table clusters (Starships/grav, aircraft, watercraft, ground/grav). A third 
option requires (gasp) small print: the integrated table and text of MT; 
Basics and color were at the beginning, then a heavily annotated table for 
each step of the process.  Make FF&S2 and SSDS look like that (without the 
typos) and you need do nothing else for T5 design...

Ah, like Omega of Doctor Who fame.  I was thinking that if Grandfather was
making pocket universes, and playing with some of the theoretical constants
such as time and what not, he probably constructed himself a universe that
allows him to more power of manipulation.  He could have constructed a
universe where magic like manipulations are possible, or one favorable to
existing as a being of pure energy.  If he did such a thing, much of the
technology that he has developed in his universe might be incapable of
functioning in our universe.  Indeed, grandfather himself might be incapable
of existing in the normal universe anymore.  The realization that millennia
of research is as good for not in the normal universe could cause him to
snap.  Then again maybe grandfather can leave his universe by remote
controlling or telepresencing a drone/host in our universe.  He might be
able to use his technology in this way also.  A device that is nothing more
than a transmitter/receiver drawing on power from a pocket universe with
favorable physics and broadcasting the effects into ours.

Then again, perhaps the Imperium is a large (or seemingly so) "pocket
universe" of Grandfathers.  Maybe it is set up so that we will research  the
Empress Wave which is really a representation of something in the "real"
universe that worries Grandfather.  That or the Emperium is a weapons
research tank for grandfather so he set up different races and the right
factors for conflict.  Add in a dash of heavily devastated worlds hinting at
ancient weapons of even greater technology to give people the idea/incentive
to find/re-create/invent them.

Enough of my rambling for now.

Time waits for no man or whatever Grandfather is.  Preventing the flow of 
time is impossible.  Could see how the Ancients and others could concievely 
go back in Time but would agree not do so.  As such a power would endanger 
their existance.  I know someone has said time paradoxes are rubbish but let 
us say they exist in the game universe.

Let\'s stay away from magic, shall we?  In terms of transforming into pure 
energy that thread has some pull.  But, what then is the tragedy of 
Grandfather?  You see, I want to make Grandfather subject to the fates not 
ommipotent.  Grandfather is long-lived (not truly immortal) but he has to 
have a flaw.

Or a little bonkers.  Technology however should not the end point.  Where do 
start philosophy?  Being is...
That is what Grandfather realizes, he is a prisoner of his own creation.  
Again, I harken you back to Faust.  Grandfather is not the demigod of the 
Traveller universe (despite some attempts to make him such).  He is a being, 
who has been to technological heights and gone beyond Imperial 
understanding.  But, the point of the Ancients Project is to understand 
where the Ancients went wrong.

Divine messagers?  Better to leave him crippled in the pocket universe.  
Grandfather and the Ancients had their time in our universe and squandered 
that chance.  It is like him leaking out technology.  [Human Beings (and 
whatever else exists in the universe) are makers of their own History.  
However, that history is not always of their own choosing.  The structures 
are however but a medium, for agency.  My ramble.]  The point is, that 
Grandfather is not an active agent in the current time.  Whether, he will 
re-emerge Secret of the Ancients seems to say: no.  My feeling is also: no.  
He left behind all these great toys (puzzles, enigmas)to propel those who 
came after him to complete his work.

Multiple universes?  Real Universes?  You like GURPS, I can tell. BTW, so do 
I except for the mechanics. Sure those are possibilities.  But, I think 
Grandfather is beyond his time actively caring what is going on in the 
Imperial Campaign.  The Empress Wave is something interesting, 
however...Dave are ready to reveal what the Empress Wave is/was/will be?  I 
have always assumed it was the thing that the Ancients were even scared of.  
Remember in the preamble the Ancients being one of many civilizations during 
their time. I don\'t think Grandfather wants to see more death, even he is 
the homocidial manac that I suggested in earlier TML.
   Ancient sites are just what they seem to be artifacts of an earlier age.  
We may look at the pyramids, Easter Island monoliths and wonder but 
essentially we know that it was our ancestors who built them.  The pyramids 
do not have some deeper understanding ready to convey to our age regarding 
Immortal life, likewise Ancient sites.  As to how, they were constructed... 
it is like Remms Cathedral build by Human Beings but even with all the 
technology we have now we could exactly duplicate the task.  So it is with 
the Ancients we must uncover their mentality and place them into the time in 
which they live and not extrapolate them into the present.  The Ancients are 
dead.  However, long live the Ancient Project!

Don\'t forget plain old trends in fashion. Even if the Air/Raft
you just purchased at Bob\'s New Floaters is functionally
identical to the decade-old model that your grouchy neighbour
drives, it may look quite different.

And look at new designs aimed at recreating older vehicles. Now you have two
vehicles that may appear outwardly identical but are vastly different in
capabilities.

Okay - there\'s no way the crew\'s going to stay that small - expect a
complement of about 50.

Looking at it, that\'s a pretty freaky ship. No defences, no armour, and only
turrets for armament. (Compare the Chrysanthemum DE (FFS design), which is a
1000dt unstreamlined design with a pair of parallel PAW mounts, a meson
screen and a trio of sandcasters.)

Hmmm. The turrets are a product of the High Guard space allocation rules, so
it might need the missile turrets replacing with a single bay of equivalent
firepower. Fuel percentage we can match - I\'ll have to see how it affects
range.

Cutters are 50 ton standard LSP models?


++ SCURRIES OFF AND BALLPARKS UP DESIGN ++

Okay, so we have (presented in the Antti Lahtinen format):

THE FER-DE-LANCE CLASS DESTROYER ESCORT
Conversion by Nick Bradbeer

A standard fleet-escort size ship, the Fer-de-Lance is intended to provide
screening and protection for rapid-moving frontier squadrons who can expect
to be operating outside of tanker support. Packing a combined missile/laser
armament and very thin defences, the Fer-de-Lance offers a heavy punch
followed by a lengthy reload cycle. The missile-heavy armament makes this
ship a popular choice for High Guard duty, providing coverage to the fleet
during fueling procedures.

While the Fer has no cargo bay, its surprisingly large hanger often fills
this role. The two cutters are loaded with supplies by a fleet auxilary,
whereupon they dock and are used as storage areas While wasteful of space,
this arrangement does allow extremely fast resupply of a squadron, and also
allows the ships being restocked to retain combat readiness rather than
docking down.

The weapons load comprises four autoloaded missile barbettes, each carrying
five ready missiles. These are augmented by six single rapid-fire 400 MJ
grav-focussed remote laser barbettes, usually tied together into three
batteries each controlled by an MFD station.

Design Notes:
    I tried to keep the crew level down as far as possible - 31 was a
minimum, mainly enforced by the engineering and gunnery crews (five MFD
gunners, and four missile loaders).
    Fuel percentage is 47.7 instead of 49 - close enough.
    I included the two 50-ton cutters. A small crew, no troops and no cargo
bay suggested the cargo system above.

Liquid Hydrogen? :-)

Get Rob Priors "101 Starships" from www.bits.org.uk - it is free. Downloadable
in PDF form (900KB).

The design system is GT but output is in metric. 

It contains many more than 101 original ship designs for several races and
roles. In fact it wouldn\'t surprise me if version four was renamed "201
Starships". Each ship has useful flavour text and full design stats. So they are
useable in any era and easily converted if you are gearheaded enough. There are
no pictures or deckplans though.

They are designed using a Mac program (sold seperately) and the document
is at version 3 - so there wont be any major design flaws in any of them. I
believe version four is under way with other GTLs covered?


BTW, is GT version 2 in metric?  They have to do something to it to make its
target audience (i.e. people like us) want to buy it. "Non-metric" has been the
most consistent argument against it that I have seen. Do you think that if we
all report it as errata they will make the change...

No, they won\'t.  However, converting to metric with acceptable accuracy is
absurdly easy: read \'yards\' as \'meters\', \'tons\' as \'metric tons\' and divide
weights in pounds by 2 and multiply range in miles by 1.5 (making space combat
hexes .05 light-seconds).  Sure, its a bit inaccurate, but given that its all
made-up numbers anyway, who cares?

From: Ian or Katts <ianw@orac.net.au>
Subject: Gosling class Air/Raft

Known in some circles as the \'IISS Retirement Pension\', the Gosling class
is a low orbit-capable 9.8 m3 air/raft, built with a mixture of TL8 and 9
components. It is designed to fit into one displacement ton of cargo space.
Two basic models exist, one powered by TL9 batteries for 2 hours operation,
and the other with a TL7 alcohol-burning power plant with 17 hours fuel.
The first is more useful in worlds without oxygen atmospheres, while the
alcohol-burning power plant can find fuel in almost any frontier or lo-tech
world. Both models feature full atmospheric sealing, and a life support
system allowing 12 hours operations.

The fast subsonic airframe carries only a pilot, and is capable of a speed
of 680 km per hour, and can achieve that speed if unloaded. It\'s true value
on the frontier is it\'s impressive external cargo capacity - it has a sling
arrangement for external cargos, and is capable of carrying 12 ton of
external cargo at 334 kmh, or 44 ton of external cargo at 136 kmh.

It\'s electronic suite is simple, consisting of a TL8 avionics and
navigation aids, and a TL9 image enhancement scope for operations in bad
visibility conditions, plus a 500 km range radio tranciever and two TL8
flight computers to assist the pilot.

The total unit costs KCr 42 (KCr 40 for the alcohol-fueled version), with
KCr 35 of that cost being with TL8 components and the remainder at TL9 (KCr
25 is the flight aids and avionics which truly dashing Scout types can
omit). A TL8 solar array unit for recharging the battery on a type 1 model
takes up 14m3, masses 28 t and costs KCr 84 in TL8 credits, and can
recharge the unit in 29 hours of standard sunlight. Other options include
an alcohol or hydrocarbon electric generator, or mains electricity on more
developed worlds.

Many IISS retirees invest their mustering-out money in one of these units,
then arrange to be mustered out on a suitable world and set up a
surface-to-surface or even surface-to-orbit shuttle service. It should be
noted that whilst the 4.5mm composite laminate shell stops many small arms,
operation in combat areas is not advised.

3.4x1.7x1.7 m air raft (9.8 m3) ; 4.5 mm composite lamitate fast subsonic
shell (0.316 m3, 0.986t, KCr 0.986 ; AF 4, max speed 800 kmh)

80 kN TL9 contragravity (0.24 m3, 0.304t, KCr 0.96 - power demand 0.144 MW

Basic Life Support (0.05 m3, 0.05t, KCr 3)

2m3 TL9 batteries (2m3, 4t, KCr 4 - 0.8 MW hrs), or 0.255 MW alcohol TL7 IC
engine (0.39 m3, 0.39t, KCr 2) plus 16 hours fuel (1.44 m3, 1.152t ; cost
Cr 5 per liter, using 90 liters per hour at full power)

TL8 Nav Aids and Avionics (0.002 m3, 0.002t, KCr 25)

TL9 Image Enhancement Scope (KCr 1)

2x TL9 Flight Computers (KCr 1)

TL8 500 km radio (0.047 m3, KCr 4.86)

1x Crewstation (7m3, 0.2t, KCr 1)

65 liters internal cargo (0.065 m3, 0.065t)

I believe this craft should be able to use the Helicopter external sling
rule on p24 of FFS2. At KCr 45 or so, I believe these things should be all
over the Imperium - they provide better lift capability than a Chinook
cargo helicopter, are capable of making orbit with a brave enough pilot and
can be packed into 1 dton of cargo space. Hell, this thing should replace a
gun on the Scout mustering out table *grin* Oh, and I calculate it at three
maintainence points, so it should be OK for years before needing a look at
with an electronics and a mechanical toolkit. Incidentally, TL8 worlds have
a per capita income of KC8 a year according to Striker, so one of these
things should cost around 7 years annual salary, or about $140 000 in
modern terms.

You could probably build a bigger version, with internal cargo and
passenger capability, at not much increase in cost or reduction in
performance, but I kept the size to something that could be palletised into
1dton of cargo space.

 Yeah, I\'ll give it a go :-

- - Certifying DOAs in the small hours of the morning in various states of
dismemberment.
- - Relatives and colleagues who insist on resuscitating corpses, or
sending the almost dead to ICU.

IMTU, Grandfather is not immortal, but he might as well be for gaming
purposes.
He survived uncounted millenia in his pocket universe, and will survive
many more.
His technology is so far advanced, nothing any party of players can
effectively do to
kill him. In effect, he is Travellers Elminster.
However he chooses not to interfere in the gaming universe anymore, for
reasons that are entirely
his own to understand. Mere humans probably wouldnt even understand his
motives even if he told them
right in their faces and even stayed around for a little Q&A.


>Grandfather?  You see, I want to make Grandfather subject to the fates not 
>ommipotent.  Grandfather is long-lived (not truly immortal) but he has to 
>have a flaw.
As to his immortality, i always figured, that he is:
a)  extremely long lived,
b)  has the technology to extend his life even further without visibe
drawbacks (kind of like the Cell-Activator of Perry Rhodan)
c)  time in his pocket universe moves much slower than in the visible
world, so that his life seems longer to us.

>where the Ancients went wrong.

His mistake was to create his progeny, to help him, but which proved to be
more of a hindrance to
his work. He was so far out, felt his work mattered more than anything else
in the universe, that 
he could not tolerate their interferance with his work and, in his view,
had to undo his "mistake", 
by killing off his offspring and bringing about the largest wholesale
destruction the universe ever
witnessed. 
Only very much later did he realize that what he had done caused so great a
disturbance,
that his work could not be continued anyway. So he instead opted to bide
his time until the 
right moment for a continuation of his work was again at hand (whatever it
was. I believe Grandfathers main project was never revealed)
Or, he felt ashamed later on when he finally discovered he had a heart,
too, and realized what he had done.  For that reason he may have retreated
to his pocket universe, helping along those races he felt most strongly
about, his "fellow droyne" (IMTU, Grandfather was something like the first
Cro Magnon to a race of Neanderthals, only that his appearance was the same). 

>Grandfather is not an active agent in the current time.  Whether, he will 
>re-emerge Secret of the Ancients seems to say: no.  My feeling is also: no.

Well, i dont think he left his toys for a reason. In fact, most of the
artifacts found
were those that were created by his "children". Only sometimes he chose to
take an active 
part, like when he seeded the Coyns to the Droyne (IMTU, prehistoric Droyne
did not need 
the Coyns to Caste. They only filled ceremonial puposes back then. Only
later did they evolve 
to realy needing them)

> The Ancients are dead.  However, long live the Ancient Project!

Ill roger that!

THE FER-DE-LANCE CLASS DESTROYER ESCORT
Conversion by Nick Bradbeer

A standard fleet-escort size ship, the Fer-de-Lance is intended to provide
screening and protection for rapid-moving frontier squadrons who can expect
to be operating outside of tanker support. Packing a combined missile/laser
armament and very thin defences, the Fer-de-Lance offers a heavy punch
followed by a lengthy reload cycle. The missile-heavy armament makes this
ship a popular choice for High Guard duty, providing coverage to the fleet
during fueling procedures.

While the Fer has no cargo bay, its surprisingly large hanger often fills
this role. The two cutters are loaded with supplies by a fleet auxilary,
whereupon they dock and are used as storage areas. While wasteful of space,
this arrangement does allow extremely fast resupply of a squadron, and also
allows the ships being restocked to retain combat readiness rather than
docking down.

The weapons load comprises four autoloaded missile barbettes, each carrying
five ready missiles. These are augmented by six single rapid-fire 400 MJ
grav-focussed remote laser barbettes, usually tied together into three
batteries each controlled by an MFD station.

Design Notes:
    I tried to keep the crew level down as far as possible - 31 was a
minimum, mainly enforced by the engineering and gunnery crews (five MFD
gunners, and four missile loaders).
    Fuel percentage is 47.7 instead of 49 - close enough.
    I included the two 50-ton cutters. A small crew, no troops and no cargo
bay suggested the cargo system above.

When we talk about fighters, and their lack of viability in Traveller
thanks to the effect of laser ROF, and the size of warships, wanting to get
a feel like \'Star Wars\' is often cited as a reason to upgrade fighter
performance.

Interestingly, the Naboo Fighters in the Phantom Menace tend to support the
Traveller feel of ineffectual fighters against capital ships. When they
attack the Droid Control Cruiser their weapons are ineffectual against the
shielding, much as a Ramparts\' would be against a Plankwell.

Taking this further -

1) the fighters in Episode IV are only effective because they actually get
through the shields of the Death Star and hit a known vulnerability. As
Armour in the Star Wars universe seems to relate to shields this means they
got past the armour and scored a critical ;-)

2) the fighters in Episode VI are only effective within the superstructure
of the new Death Star within the shield. Against capital ships they die
quickly and only score successes when they either suicide (into the bridge)
or concentrate fire on surface fittings which make the capital ship more
vulnerable (especially to the Rebel cruisers in close proximity).

Hence, I think that the answer to the argument \'I wish fighters were more
like those in Star Wars\' is that they actually are, and we only see them in
an effective role in unusual situations.

Thoughts?

If you love it, then you maybe already know that Starfleet Command, a

It looks very pretty from the screenshots.

Core System Generation:
Classic Traveller/Scouts

Extended System Generation:
World Builders Handbook with various additions, in particular:
- - from http://www.mu.org/~joe/traveller/archive/General/Worlds_and_Starports,
I use the life score if WBH indicates life is present.
- - some bits of First In seem useful and I\'ll probably pull them in. There are
good ideas dotted throughout this book.
Also note that Stewart Ferris\' world builder deluxe software will generate
WBH/Pocket Empires/Naval Squadrons stats to your hearts content, which resolves
alot of the unwieldiness of the WBH book.

Animals:
- - basic CT animal encounters

Economics
- - Pocket Empires extensions

Other Traveller Stuff
- - First In is very good, but a) it\'s GURPS and b) WBH got there first. If
you use First In and you\'re also concerned with economics then Far Trader
matches up well.
- - Grand Survey/Grand Census pretty much equates to WBH. Grand Survey has
some extra stuff on weather and the resource tables are slightly different
- - World Tamers Handbook (TNE) was horrible, at least for this purpose; but
then it\'s really a game within a game, concerned with world settlement in the
TNE era.
- - I\'ve used the alternate generation rules in the Missouri doc for worlds
outside "known space", since CT assumes civilisation - eg the starport being
generated first.

Non-Traveller Stuff
- - in an imperium game you really have to go with either the CT rules or the
GT/First In rules as the core to get worlds which match the feel of the game &
milieu
- - 2300AD has a very good system which matches well to the feel of 2300AD
- - Space Master has a system which manages to be more complex than 2300AD but
provide less detail
- - GURPS space is OK but uses a lot more words to convey less info than CT
(viz: Behind the Claw). The traveller UPP idea is simply a stroke of
brilliance.

Typical resonse "lots".

I don\'t even know if I remember: Lessee, 2 to the pint, 2 pints to the
quart, 4 quarts to the gallon... 16 cups?

ObTrav:  What \'recreational chemicals\' are illegal throughout the Imperium,

Combat pretty much only occurs between 1 and 100 diameters of a body, and
fire only occurs to a few hundred KM\'s. Mind you, I had to expand the arty
tables...

But, in play, it works well. I use a combination of the large scale rules
from Ref\'s Companion and the maneuver rules (albeit not the scale) from
Mayday and the personal/vehicular combat rules from Player\'s and Ref\'s.

And I split out the damage points for weapons into individual mounts.
Works really well on the 1-5 ships level. Standard damage mode used for
more than that (never done more than 10 on a side that way tho).

No mirror reflects all frequencies, nor 100%. A targeting mirror will need
to be 99+% reflective to THAT LASER\'s frequencies.
Reflective armor, when hit sufficiently "hard" enough WILL detonate from
the retained energy. (For proof of absorbtion, put a mirror out in the sun
for a while, and feel the back after a few hours. compare it with a piece
of black painted identical material with same exosure.) Problem with reflec
is that it is required to be "Good" against a wider range than a targeting
mirror, since laser frequencies will vary from laser to laser.

That help?

Starfire: WW1 & 2 in space. Simple, elegant, and fast. At least so long as
you don\'t do campaigns.

SFB: really fun, elegant in it\'s simplicity TO PLAY provided you ignore the
75% of the rules that are either optional, don\'t apply to your chose race,
or don\'t apply in the battle in question. Just don\'t look for "Reality", or
even adherance to "Classic Trek" combat modes... especially the Movies.

BL: a good start on a "Traveller SFB Clone".

SLAG!: Quick and easy. Adaptable for use in almost any millieu, with just a
touch of work.

Just the drawing on pg 15 of Supplement 9: Fighting Ships.  Basically, it 
looks like a box with a ball on the nose and a pair of boxes attached at the 
rear as \'nacelles\'.  Think "squared off version of the USS Enterprise with a 
Klingon bridge" and you\'ll be close...

Not to put too fine a point on this, this is mostly nonsense. The
"one theory" that suggests it could create a black hole is a letter sent to
Scientific American by a random crank; complete, utter, nonsense.

The stuff about strange matter is at least marginally possible, in the sense
that there is a theory about strange matter being able to convert normal
matter
into other strange matter - albeit under conditions unlikely to occur in the
real world. One should note that cosmic rays arrive periodically with
greater energies than RHIC will have, too.

You missed *details* in that discussion. Basicly, you *can* manage to
have a small, well protected mirror that is perfect enough to reflect
for aiming. It requires 99.99% or better reflectivity and a fair amount
of active cooling. 

You *can\'t* do the same for a missile. First off, there\'s no *room* for
the cooling system, and second, you are dealing *vastly* more area, and
area that has to be handled by launchers and fly thru "dirty" vacuum.
It takes *very* few scratches to turn a mirror that can reflect a
weapons grade laser into something that goes "boom" when that same beam
hits. As I recall *one* scratch from a passing dust partical ought to
be enough.

Gravity can *bend* light. It can\'t "reflect" it. And it takes
unreasonably high grav fields to do it anyway.

There are three main reasons (two minor, one major.) The first minor one is
that the weapon mirror is in a good, controlled clean environment; you can
be sure it has no dust grains on it, pitting imperfections due to micrometeor
hits, etc. The second is that the designers know what wavelength the laser
will
operate at, so they can use special coatings ("dielectric mirrors") that have
high
reflectivity at one particular wavelength and poor performance elsewhere.
(At high TLs, where lasers are tuneable, the coatings might be tuneable too.)

The third reason is that the laser beam is focussed; so, while it narrows down
to
a 1-cm diameter when it hits the target, it might be tens of cm or even more
than
a meter at launch - so the launch mirror is much bigger, and hence has a lower
energy density hitting it.

(At high TLs, the mirror arrangement might be more complicated. For example,
a high TL free-electron laser might not require a mirror per se; the electron
cavity could act as an "amplifier" for light, amplifying whatever beam comes
into
it without changing the direction or wavefront quality. In that case you\'d
feed the
cavity with a "seed" beam, much lower power, that gets aimed by mirrors.
At very high TLs you might dispense with the seed beam and shape the laser
by controlling the electron flow, although I think mirrors will give you more
accuracy.

I should note that you probably do need to move the whole turret to engage
multiple targets - steering of small mirrors (as opposed to the big
telescope-like
launch assembly) probably only works over a degree or so; but steering a big
telescope-like assembly can be done pretty fast - satellite-tracking
telescopes
can slew at ~10 degrees per second.

No, that\'s:

 2 pottles to a gallon

Really!

And for good only knows what reason, 1 US gallon = 231 cubic inches.

Heheheheheh... OPMV?  I recall during an anniversary of Oz going metric, the
write-ups of how some of the "oldies" were confused by things such as
"Places were now further way!" (Kilometres being smaller than Miles gave
distances a larger "number" on the old sign post), however, they also found
that "It\'s further away, but quicker to get too now!" (at a given speed, you
could travel 10K in a shorter time than you could travel 10M).  Reminds me
of our local fight over daylight savings... some dairy farmers reckon their
cows wouldn\'t know when to come get milked, and the extra hour of daylight
will fade the curtains!

  Oops - I thought you were saying that personal combat was restricted to

Okay-so the whole American systems of measures is nuts.  Why do they sell
some products by the half pint and some by the cup?  Also-why does the
military use maps measured in 1 KM square grids and gauges which read in
MPH?

By the way.  Arizona does not do daylight savings time.  I\'m not sure
why, but I resent waking up around 5 to 5:30 AM for work and the sun is

  Isn\'t the supposed thesis usually conceived more along the lines of "I like

  Ooh, flame-bait, tasty! :)

  FWIW, by way of a dumb Yank comeback, I saw some really funny stuff on 
A&E last night, purporting to be part of the Kennedy family bio\'s they\'re 
showing ad nauseum (good taste, that...) - apparently the Germans invaded
Czechoslavakia (!) in `38, or at least A&E chose to show some clips of
generic military activity at that point, and the US public was generally 
in favour of taking action against Germany at that time (`38-39). 

  I\'m quite frankly afraid to ask if this is indicative of US standards in
history instruction or whether it\'s merely entertainment. What sort of 
overall distortion filter should other Westerners apply to reality to get
the same POV as the average US citizen?

Okay - there\'s no way the crew\'s going to stay that small - expect a
complement of about 50.

Looking at it, that\'s a pretty freaky ship. No defences, no armour, and only
turrets for armament. (Compare the Chrysanthemum DE (FFS design), which is a
1000dt unstreamlined design with a pair of parallel PAW mounts, a meson
screen and a trio of sandcasters.)

Hmmm. The turrets are a product of the High Guard space allocation rules, so
it might need the missile turrets replacing with a single bay of equivalent
firepower. Fuel percentage we can match - I\'ll have to see how it affects
range.

Cutters are 50 ton standard LSP models?


++ SCURRIES OFF AND BALLPARKS UP DESIGN ++

Okay, so we have (presented in the Antti Lahtinen format):

THE FER-DE-LANCE CLASS DESTROYER ESCORT
Conversion by Nick Bradbeer

A standard fleet-escort size ship, the Fer-de-Lance is intended to provide
screening and protection for rapid-moving frontier squadrons who can expect
to be operating outside of tanker support. Packing a combined missile/laser
armament and very thin defences, the Fer-de-Lance offers a heavy punch
followed by a lengthy reload cycle. The missile-heavy armament makes this
ship a popular choice for High Guard duty, providing coverage to the fleet
during fueling procedures.

While the Fer has no cargo bay, its surprisingly large hanger often fills
this role. The two cutters are loaded with supplies by a fleet auxilary,
whereupon they dock and are used as storage areas. While wasteful of space,
this arrangement does allow extremely fast resupply of a squadron, and also
allows the ships being restocked to retain combat readiness rather than
docking down.

The weapons load comprises four autoloaded missile barbettes, each carrying
five ready missiles. These are augmented by six single rapid-fire 400 MJ
grav-focussed remote laser barbettes, usually tied together into three
batteries each controlled by an MFD station.

Design Notes:
    I tried to keep the crew level down as far as possible - 31 was a
minimum, mainly enforced by the engineering and gunnery crews (five MFD
gunners, and four missile loaders).
    Fuel percentage is 47.7 instead of 49 - close enough.
    I included the two 50-ton cutters. A small crew, no troops and no cargo
bay suggested the cargo system above.

Thankyou, my happy little belter.

Are there any deckplans/pics that one should work around?

Based on the illustraion in Supplement 9 Fighting Ships the forward sphere
seems to be common to both the Chrysanthenum and Fer-De-Lance classes.

 This looks very undergunned compared to the TNE version of the
Chrysanthenum, perhaps if the lasers were replaced by the heavy lasers given
to the Kinunir class when it was converted 900 Mj I think.

Very true, does yours have bulbous fenders and large fins, the boxy look or 
that sleek Ferrari styling with front and rear stabilizers.  I prefer the 
imitation stealth look myself.

Tell me about it. I\'m a Canadian who\'s going to be driving down to 
the US next week on vacation. I remember the last time I was there,
and asked for "200 grams" of ham at the supermarket deli. I\'m
lucky I wasn\'t arrested, given that the only things measured in grams
in the US are illegal substances... :)

The real challenge will be to figure out the price of gas: converting
$US per gallon into $C per litre... and having to remember that the
US gallon isn\'t the same as the Imperial Gallon (4.54 litres, or
160 fl.oz. for those of you south of the border)... I need a spreadsheet
just to do the calculations. 

ObTrav #1: I run a GURPS Traveller campaign. Like any other GURPS
game my group has ever played, where the rules say "yards", we use
"metres". It seems to work.

ObTrav #2: Do different areas of the Imperium use different measurements?
I would imagine that down by the Solomani Rim they use Solomani units
(1000 metres in a kilometre), while way off to coreward Vilani units
are in vogue (1,728 lishii in a guraadagarur)...

	Very good point. The only difference that I can see is that

	the attacking fighters were capable of causing enough harm,
	at least to surface systems, to motivate the Death Star
	officers to launch their own fighters in defense. Do any of

Think of a globe. or an orange.  If you peel of the skin, you essentially
have a 2 dimensional surface that was overlaid on the on a 3 dimensional
one.  Every possible location within the lower dimensional area corresponded
with a point on the higher dimensional one (On the surface of the sphere.),
but not vice versa.

The concept is the same, but with 3 dimensional space layered over a 4 (or
4+) dimensional object.  Its hard to picture as we normally think and
experience in 3 dimensions.  A 2 dimensional being would have as much
trouble understanding a sphere and how to wrap 2 dimensional space around
it\'s surface.  From his perspective, you can\'t bend that way.

This logic tends to work as long as the lower dimensional space is finite,
as ours probably is.

Excuse me, but that makes no sense. The limitations of focussing at the
ranges used basically prevent this from happening... the best you get is a
nealy cylindrical cone, and in almost all cases, the narrow end is at the
weapon. Anything else results in a fixed focus weapon, useful only at a
given set of ranges.

   I\'m just returned to this digest after a year&1/2 offline, and I\'m curios 
as to which system everyone is using;with Trave there\'s certianly room for a 
lot of different choices.Me, I\'m playing prettymuch MT,with some stuff cadged 
from TNE &Marc\'sTrav.
   A few things I\'ve decided to do ship-wise in my campaign:
   Made the tractor and repulsors come out at the same TL;in fact making them 
the same device.After all,you dont own a car that goes fwd,and another that 
goes backwards.I figured it was just a matter of having the proper gearshift 
:)
   I removed Meson weapons entirely.I didn\'t mind everything beingh 
transparent to them.That\'s an excellent commo devices.But as weapons?I didn\'t 
care for the idea that, while they penetrate anything(without any apparent 
side-effects),they can handily be manipulated to cause an explosion inside an 
object(like a ship!what\'re the chances?) following penetration.To me this has 
"Magic" stamped all over it.
   BlackGlobes are gone too. I didn\'t care for them being obviously cadged 
from Mote in God\'s Eye.They\'re all "white" now.Lower TL too.
   
   Last issue Brad was wondering why the (US, I\'m guessing) military use maps 
measured in 1 KM square grids and gauges which read in MPH?
   Brad,its to give our forces familiarity with the metric system so they\'ll 
be able to pick up a map made  ANYWHERE,and  use it effectively when we  make 
that big push against the rest of the planet.The guages remain in MPH because 
yanks are comfortable with it.Besides,we\'ll be imposing our wonderful 
american measurements once we rule the planet:)

   And AveNelso wonders
   What sort of overall distortion filter should other Westerners apply to 
reality to get
the same POV as the average US citizen?
   See above:)
   
   I\'ve found listings of  Traveller aliens on the net,but been unable to 
find CT/MT/Marc\'sTrav stats for both the Kkree and the Droyne (I missed the 
original books that had \'em).Could someone who has them PLEASE e-mail them to 
me?I\'m just looking for how to roll \'em up;any sorta special species-specific 
career tables are unimportant. 
   Another question:Fusion guns listed in MT and the ones listed in High 
Guard have different values for the same # of weapons.Which one is actually 
right?If its the HG ones,then by all means,give me Fusionguns.lol!

Sounds like a Chrysanthemum to me. That\'s been published by GDW (in
Brilliant Lances). But it\'s unstreamlined, those nacelles are light PAWs now
and it requires tanker support hand has a crew of 54.

Well, I envisaged the Fer-de-Lance as fulfilling a similar role to the
Chrysanthemum, but operating on the frontier away from tanker support.

I\'d suggest that the nav. computer stays running - then your signal GK
can say `help me - I\'m at co-ords xxxxyyyyzzzz moving at xxxxyyyyzzzz\'
rather than just `help me - home in on this beacon\' which is a bit
pointless.

It would also let the ship consider minor problems like a large asteroid
on a collision vector (time to wake the crew and abandon ship, or maybe
try the M-drive).

According to the Traveller  News  Service  that  would  be  Naval
Commander Ansel Churner on 121-1111:

    - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
    Regina/Regina (0310-A788899-A)             Date: 102-1112

    A dispatch from Terra/Sol (0207-A867A69-F) dated 121-1111
    reads: "The first known victim known  to  survive  direct
    exposure to hyperspace arrived at Terra today,  suffering
    from  what  medical  experts  are   calling   "Hyperspace
    sickness".  Naval Commander Ansel Churner, an engineering
    officer on his way to retirement on Prometheus, is  being
    held in strict quarantine until specialists can determine
    the specific  effects  the  exposure  will  have. Doctors
    working on the case are quoted as saying that preliminary
    tests  indicate  that  Commander  Churner  is   in   good
    condition, but is not mobile.

    "Three members  of  the  engineering  department  on  the
    Tyrol,  a  Rome,  Inc.   luxury   liner,   were   killed.
    Circumstances of their deaths have not been  released  at
    this time."

    Admiralty spokesmen at Regina refused to comment  on  the
    dispatch.

                                           Challenge 26 - GDW

A follow on news article states:

    - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
    "Meanwhile, medical specialists at the Demosthenes  Naval
    Hospital have confirmed the gradual recovery of Commander
    Churner from the almost  total  loss  of  equilibrium  he
    suffered as a result of exposure to hyperspace.
    - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Meanwhile, according to DGP-canon ...

    - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
    To the observer aboard a starship <snip> one second he is
    looking at a normal star field  with  a  glare  from  the
    energized lanthanum hull grid clearly visible; the  next,
    he can see only the undulating gray "nothingness" of  the
    protective jump field.

    <snip>

    The  "wall"  of  the   protective   jump   field   bubble
    surrounding a ship in jumpspace does not routinely  touch
    the ship, but hovers about a meter from the hull surface.
    While one can crawl about on the  hull  of  the  ship  in
    jumpspace, getting close to the jump  field  with  little
    intervening protection  has  dangerous  effects  on  most
    lifeforms.

    Most go temporarily insane  if  they  get  within  a  few
    centimeters of a  jump  field  barrier,  and  some  never
    recover or even die from its effects.

If you want both excepts to be true in YTU then Commander Churner
must have passed *beyond* the protective jump field  bubble,  and
come back! ... however, we were never told what he saw.  Referees
wanting to add a horror element  to  their  campaign  could  draw
inspiration from the film "Event Horizon".

Add to this that anyone from 25 to 45 was convinced in school that we
would be converting to metric soon. They sent us home with these bizarre
conversion charts that included such points of enlightenment as:
Time: No change. 
Money: No change.

Thank you Thomas Jefferson. (He pushed for metric money in the US, and
also pushed for an ~metric~ system, miles, dimes of miles, cents of miles.)

Anyway, there was never any change, and no one has any problem picking up
a 2 liter bottle of soda, but wait, a 2 liter bottle of milk? I have to 
pull out my conversion tables!

The first Nazi military incursion into Czechoslavakia took place in the
fall of 1938, in the mostly ethnic German Sudentanland. The Czechs
finally abandoned their Sudentenland border defenses Oct. 10 after the
Munich Conference clearly showed them that the British and French were
going to do nothing. It was, however, not until March 19, 1939 that the
last provinces capitulated, and all of Czechoslavakia was taken over.

  Well, presumably under Striker a bunker wouldn\'t be able to fire at
a pioneer out of its arc, and I assume that heavy vehicles can\'t tool
around the decks in AHL in attempts to get valid LOS.  :|

What are the definitions, either tonnage or mission, for the following:

  Frigate
  Escort
  Patrol Boat

I have a 2,400 displacement ton ship, armed with a PA bay, Missile Bay, 3 laser 
turrets, and a sand turret. It is fast when compared to its opponents (3G - which is 
reasonably fast for a low-tech campaign) and has Jump-3 and heavy armor.

What possible missions/description would such a class support?

Anotehr question - how many marines should be on a smaller ship, if the craft\'s stated

few marines for security and such?

We\'re strange about that kinda stuff.

BTW, what do they call a \'Quarter Pounder\' up there?  I know in France they 
call it the Royale, but the French have always been a bit weird...
 
ObTrav:  Anybody care to speculate if the Vilani secretly contacted the French a couple hundred years back & the Froggies didn\'t bother telling anybody about it?  It could help explain their cooking & their misplaced sense of superiority...

Minor correction:
Only Czechia was taken over as a protectorate. Slovakia was a (semi

Half a kilo with cheese??????????  That sucker\'d weigh over a *pound*.

I seriously doubt they call a \'Quarter Pounder\' up there a \'112 Grammer\'.

I suspect that the Death Star officers didn\'t like the idea of lots of
their surface fixtures being damaged, so launching fighters was the logicl
response. The problem was that the Death Star should have had some Star
Destroyer and Frigate escorts to handle incoming attackers. Its weapons
were all aimed at bigger, slower ships. Kind of like the problem that the
Bizmarck had with Swordfish Bombers, but reversed.

There is something in a JTAS article which increases fighter effectiveness,
but it doesn\'t make them harder to hit..

Full Thrust isn\'t bad either, especially when you modify it for Traveller.

But we usually refute that one with the point that aircraft are faster and
carry weapons capable of hurting a capital ship (eg a torp). In most WW2
cases several hits were needed with ordnance of a scale similar to capital
ship weapons to kill them...

The _I like them cos they\'re cool thesis_ is near impossible to scupper
with logic...

Well, around here we call it a "Hambourgoie" (that\'s ham-boor-zhwah) until
Louise Beaudoin leaves the room, then we get back to calling it "a Quater
Pounder" or "un Quarter Pounder" like everybody else on the continent. :-)

Nick, you\'re right.

The Chrysanthemum-class Destroyer Escort is the pseudo-Trek design with
the ball up front. The two "nacelles" are actually Particular Accelerator
weapon bays.

I\'ve some very nice deckplans for it which I found on a Star Trek site
I\'ve finally cleaned up the text on the graphics (pretty garbled).

The Fer-de-Lance is a missile corvette designed and published by FASA
as part of their Adventure Class Ships series. Nice deckplans, too.

Fighting Ships gives it PA turrets, not bays.

I don\'t think so.  The Fer De Lance is the destroyer escort on the page
next to the Chrysanthemum in Fighting Ships.  It\'s awfully ugly; a ball
with a box sticking out the back and two smaller boxes slapped on the sides
of the main box.  It looks like something you could build with Legos.  The
missile corvette in FASA\'s Adventure-class ships is the Valor-class.

TIRPITZ hung out in Norwegian fjords, trying to hide from the RAF, until
the RAF dropped a few 12,000 lb. bombs on him.  C\'est la guerre....

Sure, it\'s possible.  Heck, I\'ve designed some truly _hideous_ flying
safes, using FF&S2.  Besides, BISMARCK wasn\'t all that tough a ship

Much better is the wailing of your medicine pump when it runs dry at 0130
just after you\'ve finally manged to get to sleep with IV\'s in both arms and
a lumbar puncter in your hip.

To be honest, It\'d be preferable to the woman who\'s husband was in the bed

Well, they shouldnt have such rules, because at close range (say, 50 000 km
or less) fighters arent small enough or agile enough to stop a laser
hitting them, due to the good old d = 0.5*a*t^2 function determining how
far the fighter can get away from it\'s known position (if a laser cant hit
a known position at close range all the time, then it\'s going to be
absolutely useless at long range).

Fighters also generally dont have enough armour to absorb laser fire,
unlike real warships, and tend not to have a lot of sandcasters either.

It\'s within the range of reason to assume that for a laser to focus to a new
targeting solution takes some amount of time, and that this amount of time is
proportional to the size of the primary mirror; its not like we have any solid
information about grav focusing anyway.  Assume half a second and even at
extremely close range a 6G fighter can move by 7 meters; a 10 dt fighter only
needs to shift by 3-4 meters (depending on shape) to dodge.

Of course, it\'s also within the range of reason to assume that lasers don\'t
work that way...

In my book, if it has a spinal mount, it\'s a cruiser or bigger. If it has a
bay weapon, it\'s a destroyer. Otherwise, it\'s a frigate if it can do four
gees and jump-3, an escort otherwise. Patrol boats are non-jump escorts.

I think 2-3 per 100 dtons displacement is about right.

You might do what the RN did in the Dreadnought era, and assign a bay or
set of turrets to the Marines. Presumably they would be crosstrained.

Just out of curiosity:  what TL is this campaign\'s setting?  (I might
have some useful designs on hand, to employ as enemy craft [designed by
Another Mind (tm)].)

A caveat:  Using the Akins FF&S2 spreadsheet, there is a type of weapon
mount known as "light spinal mount"; I would consider these in the same
category as bay-type weapons (their primary advantage over bays is that,
as linear mounts, they are less susceptible to combat damage than
toroidal bay mounts).  Note that the smallest spinal mounts in HG2
require 1000 dtons (Code E, G, and J meson gun mounts).

I tend to place the minimum size of ships designated as "cruisers" at
10,000 dtons, with a spinal mount.  Smaller spinal-mount-equipped ships
are usually classified as destroyers, since their "spinal mounts" are
basically equivalent to long, narrow bay mounts.  Maximum size for true
cruisers (in our M:1100 game) is 100 kdt.  Larger ships are capital
assets (either battlecruisers or battleships).

Note that in earlier eras, capital ships tend to be smaller than in
M:1100.  Two examples:  During the Interstellar Wars, a typical Terran
battleship was about 30,000 dtons.  In M:0, the CORONATION-class
battleship was 90,000 dtons.  In M:1100, both of these ships would be
considered cruiser-sized.

HG2 uses the range of from 3/100 dtons to 3/1000 dtons.

FF&S2 seems to assume that ship\'s troops are used to supplement the

The Tirpitz spent part of the war hiding in a fjord in Norway. The Allies
tried to sink it with mini-subs (there was a movie) but finally ended up
just sending heavy bombers after it while it was docked until they did
enough damage that it sunk.

   It is the current system (by default), so naturally the list has a

   This bring up another question...what is the official release date for

Good.  Then the whole universe has not been upended by the GURPS Wave.  When
I think of TNE I invariably think of Mr. Hale (and vice versa).  What
projects have you been up to lately?

He had mentioned fourth quarter of 1999, but Loren seemed to think that the
success of GURPS Traveller was buying him time to do a more thorough
upgrade.  Marc has been very quiet as of late.  I hear he has several other
irons in the fire, which is fine.  I can wait awhile if it means a better
product.  Sorry if it sounded like I was disparaging GT.  I like the "T"
part, it\'s just the "G" stuff that turns me off. ;-)

   I visited Montreal back in 1995 to attend a conference and watch the
Montreal Grand Prix (Schumacher blew an engine much to my and several
thousand Germans\' disappointment, but I digress...) and was very much
impressed by the city and its people.  I knew enough French to read signs
(I didn\'t spend the entire four years in high school French staring
dreamily at the babe of an instructor I had...ok, yeah I did, but some of
it sunk in somehow) and wouldn\'t humiliate myself by even trying to speak
it to a native French speaker, but I had no problem getting around and
talking to people--they seemed to be able to switch back and forth from
French to English without effort.

>(apologies for obscure Quebec political humor...)

   Not at all...after seeing Quebec flags in about every other residential
window in the city, I figured it was a matter of time before Quebec tried
to leave Canada.  It hasn\'t happened, which tells me Quebec is the Texas of
Canada--Canadians first, but always Quebecers, and proud of it.  Any
politican in Quebec who thinks that the people will tolerate an attempt to
recreate New France needs a reality check.

Actually Cantor proved a few centuries ago that all N-dimensional spaces
(for N > 0) have the same cardinality. This means there is a one-to-one
mapping between points in 2D and 3D.

Any number of mappings are possible. The one Cantor used, if I restrict it
to a 2D - 3D mapping would be as follows:

Convert all spaces to unit mappings. You can do this by dividing the
position of whatever space you have by the extent of that space. Given a 3D
point with the decimal expansions of its coordinates as follows:

	x1 = i1 i2 i3 i4 ...
	y1 = j1 j2 j3 j4 ...
	z1 = k1 k2 k3 k4 ...

Then one mapping to 2D space is:

	x2 = i1 i2 i3 i4 ...
	y2 = j1 k1 j2 k2 ...

The problem is that 2D and 3D space are not topologically equivalent. This
means that distances and directions are not preserved by the mapping so,
for example, two points right next to each other in 2D space could end up
on opposite sides of the universe in 3D space. A square (or whatever) in 2D
space could map to a disconnected cloud of points in 3D space.

I wouldn\'t want to live without daylight savings time. Way up north in
Edmonton, Alberta, in the summer (with daylight savings time) the sun
sets just after 10:00 PM -- and rises just after 5:00 AM. I would not
want to have the sun rising a few minutes after four in the morning.

Of course, I could do without the semi-annual clock changing... but 
if we\'d leave it on Daylight time all year, in late December the sun
would rise just before 10:00 am...

ObTrav: how do they reconcile all the clocks and calendars in the
Imperium to the Imperial Standard? If an Imperial Standard Day is
24 hours (ie, the Terran Day), what does a planet do when it has
a rotation of 23.5 hours? If you start with clocks synchronized
so that high noon is at 12:00 Noon, 24 days later "noon" is in the
middle of the night...

Yes, but...correct me if I\'m wrong, shouldn\'t a ship\'s designation be based
not on its weapon load or size - but on the mission it can/does perform? If
it acts like a destroyer, then it is a destroyer - no matter how large or
small it is. Is this correct?

And if it is correct - then I guess I\'m asking: What is the difference
between a Destroyer, Frigate, Escort, Destroyer Escort, etc...

Heh. I\'ll forgive the mispelling (its Akins - no t. Common mistake) since
you are obviously showing me great respect - although I never did hear back
from the vatican if my canonization (spelling) into sainthood, as the patron
saint of traveller spreadsheets, was ever approved by his holiness. I expect
he\'s waiting for me to finish the next version (really, I\'m working on
it!!!!)

I know this might sound mighty strange to you, but a \'Quarter Pounder\'
up here is called a \'Quarter Pounder\'.

IMTU (set in M:1100):

The differences between the functions of cruisers, destroyers, frigates,
escorts, and patrol boats are rooted in the following concepts (assuming
that most freighters are J-1/M-1):

1.  Non-jump spacecraft intended to detect and engage hostile raiders
within a given area of space are classified as patrol boats.  In
Traveller terms, this refers primarily to SDBs.

2.  Armed starships of up to 2000 dtons, designed with jump capability
equal to that of the escorted freighters, and with sublight performance
equal to or better than that of the escorted freighters, are classified
as escorts (note that merchant cruisers, in the World War II sense, may
fall under this category).

3.  Armed starships of up to 2000 dtons, designed with jump capability
exceeding that of the escorted freighters, and with sublight performance
of at least 3-G, are classified as frigates or destroyer escorts
(depending on local usage [the two terms are equivalent]).

4.  Armed starships of up to 5000 dtons, designed with jump and sublight
performance equal to or greater than the standard for the fleet, are
counted as destroyers.

5.  Armed and armored starships of 10,000 dtons or larger (but no larger
than 100k dtons), carrying a spinal mount, and capable of extended
independent operations, are classed as cruisers.

6.  Any starship with the primary function of launching small craft for
combat is classified as a carrier (if the launch facilities require more
than twice the volume of the ship\'s armament, this usually indicates
that the ship is a carrier).

7.  Ships not covered in the above guidelines are classified as seems
appropriate to the function of the vessel in question (for example, a
9000 dton ship, with a spinal mount, may best be described as a
destroyer or a cruiser, depending on its intended function and
capabilities; meanwhile, a 4500 dton ship, with performance only equal
to the average merchant ship, will likely be classed as a large escort,
rather than as a frigate or destroyer).

Bottom line:  Patrol boats are non-jump vessels; escorts and frigates
are designed to equal or exceed the performance of merchant ships, and
operate as merchant escorts; destroyers are designed to equal or exceed
the performance of fleet units, and operate either as merchant escorts
or as fleet escorts; and cruisers are fairly large warships, designed to
operate independently if necessary.

Hope this helps....

Thanks.  That makes sense - I guess.  On my first gun crew the driver was
from Georgia, the gunner (me) from Arizona and the Squad Leader was from
Puerto Rico.  Our Platoon Sergeant was from Samoa and the Platoon Leader
from the Bronx.   We had enough trouble understanding each other\'s
"english" and then the maps and the track didn\'t use the same
measurements.  (To make matters worse the cannon measured it\'s rotation
in "mils")

As far as Traveller goes-how standardized is the language?  Accents,
Slang, etc. could provide interesting plot twists...

I know this guy on Roup who works out of a little boat that\'s usually
docked not too far from the starport anyway if you give him a holovid of
a performance he runs it on his holoplayer and records just the sound
components onto 8-track tapes like ten at a time or something which he
sells around the islands.  It\'s always worth checking in with him when
you visit Roup.  He doesn\'t pay much for borrowing your holovid but he
always has a big smile and a few bottles of that fish beer they make
which is pretty good at least after you\'ve had two or three and he knows
everybody and where to find anything you\'re looking for.  Anything. 
Tell him I sent you.

Like the dragon in the Beowulf saga, he\'s evolved to that higher plane
where he realizes the meaning of life, which the dragon shares with
Grendel:  "Find yourself some gold and sit on it."  (From John Gardner\'s

Warships of around 400 to less tnah 800 tons I class as sloops smaller than
that they are in general scouts.

The classifications are somewhat vague and vessels were often pushed into
roles for which they were not really designed for example in WW2 the US navy
had a shortage of light cruisers, various Fletcher through Gearing class
destroyers were required to fill the cruiser role as a result.

In TNE the destroyers were around 3,000 tons displacement and had a spinal
particle accelerator.

For larger vessels it does depend on the tech level etc. In my game light
cruisers are larger than 3,000 tons but less then about 8,000 where I start
my smaller heavy cruisers - most of my heavy cruisers are at 10,000 dt and
battleships twice this.

I remember talking about this on the list not too long ago.  The
Imperium itself doesn\'t have any laws about drugs.  Its member states
certainly do (some of them). Sometimes member states ask the Imperium to
help out.  Sometimes the Imperium does.  A nasty problem can arise when
a drug produced in member state A has been made illegal by member state
B, but it is highly desired by people in B.  This is one of those
situations that can lead to governments asking their advisors for
briefings on the Imperial rules of war.

My answers to your questions would then be as follows:  

> What \'recreational chemicals\' are illegal throughout the Imperium

It\'s too complicated to answer.  Maybe some bureaucracy in the Imperium
keeps records of requests for assistance from member states and can sort
that data according whether the requests were for assistance in
enforcing drug laws.  

> and just how heavily are they smuggled?  

Smuggling is the intentional transportation of something to a place
where it is forbidden or the intentional transportation of something to
a place in a manner that is forbidden, or both.

Thus if B in the example above forbids possession of the drug from A,
intentionally transporting it to B is smuggling.  If B requires that any
shipments of the drug be declaraed and pay a duty upon entry, then
smuggling it to B would mean bringing it in in some other manner, like
drop from space.  

Inasmuch as just about anything could be an illegal or tariffed item on
any given world, the "transportation" element of smuggling could be
happening every time a person, pallet, or container crosses the
extrality line, or, even more so, every time a starship makes planetfall
away from the starport.  That\'s still not smuggling, because it lacks
the "intentional" element -- but that\'s an argument the PCs will have to
make to the judge, not to the arresting officers.

The diplomacy map should be the general area map.  Then the players
would be Imperial, Solomani, Aslan, Zhodani, Vargr, K\'kree, and Hiver. 
That\'s a convenient seven, just like Diplomacy.  Then you have to assign
supply centers and regions for movement.  It could make a cool strategic
game.

This is the tough, technical part of the job of the Office of Calendar
Compliance.

Some worlds don\'t worry about this issue at all, of course:  Asteroids
just follow Imperial time, as can artificial, enclosed space stations
and the like.  

Every other world rotates around its access at its own speed.  This can
really add atmosphere to a world, but requires some work from the
referee.  There is a Poul Anderson story where Dominic Flandry is on a
world with either a very long or very short period of rotation, and
everybody kind of cat-naps for part of the day.  

That\'s really how it would be, too.  Solomani got used to a 24 hour
cycle over some hundreds of thousands of years.  Vilani got used to a
different cycle (30-something hours; see Vilani and Vargr); Zhodani to
still another cycle.  I don\'t think that several generations on a world
will make us conform to its cycle.  It would take much, much longer.

This is another recurring subject on the TML.  Do we have electronic
translators that translate everything that is being said into whatever
we prefer to hear?  Do they do that primarily by database matching or
primarily by following linguistic rules and guessing from context, much
as humans (and at least some other sophonts) do with languages?  What do
we hear when the translator isn\'t working?  

How much does telecommunications help standardize language across the
Imperium (as opposed to upon any single world) given the time lag in
interstellar travel?

Can\'t be done. Naval designations are extremely maliable and change with 
frightening/amusing regularity. What was a frigate one day can be a destroyer 
the next and a patrol boat after that. The terms all depend on when, where and 
who. Take my own ideas for the Interstellar Wars (can be found at 
http://users.netaccess.co.nz/amv/trav/promrise/ships/tcshptyp.htm) for 
instance. Under this scheme, what would be called a Cruiser in M:1100 is 
called a Frigate; same role, different name. And on top of these genuine 
differences are deliberate politically inspired misnomers, like the new Japanese 
"support ship". Honest Govn\'r that big flat area on top\'s just to allow quick 
handling of cargo, and it just made sense to put all the superstructure off to 
starboard. The large full length deck below, a vehicle deck, honest. And the 
large lifts linking the "vehicle" deck with topside, well we might want to move 
the "vehicles" in a hurry. A carrier, nah never, would I lie to you gov. 

However all that being said there are some terms which can be useful. They are 
determined mostly by mission and tend to be somewhat vague and fuzzy 
around the edges 

Captial Ships Large ships designed for the specific purpose of meeting enemy 
warships in battle and defeating them. They may have other functions but they 
are more or less incidential. In peacetime, you send them in to show that 
you\'re not messing about. Names used: Battleship, Battlecruiser, Star 
Destroyer, Deathstar, Battlestar etc. 

Cruising ships Ships designed for long range independent operations. By 
neccessity are not as strong in combat as a captial ship, but have it over them 
when it somes to endurance. There intended roles are reconnaissance and 
commerce warfare (both raiding and protecting). Names used: Cruiser, Frigate, 
Raider, Hunter etc. 

Fleet Escorts These ships are designed to support capital ships. Far smaller 
than their charges. Armed with a weapon that can do \'real\' damage a capital 
ship. Their prime role is to threaten the enemy battleline and limit their tactical 
options; and to neutralise enemy fleet escorts to prevent them doing the same. 
They don\'t have to be able to kill a capital ship, but must be able to do enough 
to be taken seriously. Also used to finish off cripples. Some larger ones may 
be capable of functioning as limited cruising ships. Names used: Destroyer, 
Frigate, Fleet Escort etc. 

Patrol Ships Designed for patrol work and escorting merchants in low threat 
areas (protecting them from Fleet Escorts). The peacetime workhorses of the 
fleet. Will be designed with good endurance and low operating costs in mind. 
These ships are not intended to stand in battle but may be sufficently well 
armed to scare off a Fleet Escort. Most navies will go for a \'High-Low\' mix with 
these, having a small number of well armed examples capable of holding their 
own with a Fleet Escort for awhile and a lot more inexpensive examples for 
general grunt work. Its important to note that since there is no submarine
equvilent in Traveller, the role of convoy escort will probably not evolve.
However, these ships will be useful against small raiders (eg pirates).
ames used: Destroyer Escort, Frigate, Corvette, Sloop, Escort etc. 

Carriers Ships intended to carry other vessels into combat. Generally make 
poor combat ships themselves, concentating on limited defensive capacity and 
maximum carrying capacity. Usually rely on supporting vessels for defense. 
Names Used: Carrier, Tender, Deathstar etc.

I\'d say it fits into the high capacity Patrol Ship or Fleet Escort model.

As a rule of thumb, I restrict Marines to Fleet Escort and above (roughly 
1% to 5% of the crew), though I do put them on some high end Patrol 
Ships.

The reason the Swordfishes actually made the attac run was that they were
slower than the targeting aids on the Bizmarck\'s AA allowed for. So the
gunners ended up \'switching to manual\' but \'using the  force didn\'t work\'.

>anyone know what happened to the Tirpitz, sister ship to the Bismark?

IIRC, it was bombed several times using Barnes Wallis\' Tall Boy and
Grandslam enormous bombs. And it was also sabotaged by an attack using
midget submarines by the RN. I can\'t remember which happened first, or
which was most successful. I can\'t remember if it was used for nuclear
weapons tests like the Prinz Eugen.

>As far as traveller, how would you design a ship that could take the type of

Hmm. Take a TL15 ship and ramp the armour to max (TL+3 IIRC for
non-asteroids), add in the best Meson screens, nuclear dampers and
sandcasters and you\'re on your way to something which will take high levels
of punishment. (Bk 5 isn\'t to hand so I may have the limits for armour out
a bit). Also make it big to help ignore criticals...

Depends on `when\' and who.

Looking at today\'s navies, the RN classifies ships by role. A Destroyer
is a seagoing escort ship specialised in area anti-air warfare; a
frigate is a seagoing escort ship specialised in anti-submarine warfare;
`escort\' is a general term for destroyers and frigates; and Patrol
vessels are smaller craft, usually assigned to coastal duties.

The USN classifies ships by size. Cruisers are big, multirole ships.
Destroyers are medium size, medium capability ships with a bias towards
one warfare speciality, but with some capability in others. Frigates are
small, cheap escorts.

I would suggest that you look at WWII definitions for comparison with
traveller:

Battleship: Ship with heavy armament, and with armour that protects it
from a ship with similar armament. For fighting fleet actions and for
bombarding enemy positions.

Battlecruiser: Like a battleship, but sacrifices some armour for speed.
Used to hunt down enemy cruiser squadrons (which it should still
overmatch); and as a heavy scout for battleship squadrons.

Cruiser: Armoured ship with a medium armament. Capable on independent
action.

Destroyer: Unarmoured ship with light gun armament. Fast. Used in
squadrons, either to fight enemy destroyer squadrons; to attack capital
ships (that\'s battleships and cruisers) with torpedoes; or to screen
friendly capital ships from light warships.

Frigate: Unarmoured ship with light gun armament. Not as fast as a
destroyer. Used to escort convoys of cargo or troop ships.

Corvette: Unarmoured ship with minimal armament. Slow. Used to escort
convoys. Cheap and nasty.

For traveller purposes, most of these definitions are fine. You\'ll need
to come up with a way for destroyers to hurt capital ships, though. I
suggest that `Escort\' is used for an unarmoured ship with very light
armament, but designed for fleet rather than convoy duties.

Depends on the tech level et al. If 2400 tons is a big ship at the time,
it\'s probably a cruiser.

No. MARDETs are less and less common these days. (I mean, how much of a
security risk is there to a warship at sea, and even if someone does try
something the crew have some weapons).

Again, the size of a traveller MARDET would depend on the ship\'s
mission.

Hmm. Take a TL15 ship and ramp the armour to max (TL+3 IIRC for
non-asteroids), add in the best Meson screens, nuclear dampers and
sandcasters and you\'re on your way to something which will take high levels
of punishment. (Bk 5 isn\'t to hand so I may have the limits for armour out
a bit). Also make it big to help ignore criticals...

A healthy dose of luck would help as well.  If memory serves, a lot of the
Bismark\'s mucking about unharmed was due to just plain bad luck on the part
of the British.  They even once attacked one of thier own ships!
(Sheffield?  or was it Norfolk or Sufolk?  Seems to me one of those two were
always running from a fight anyway.  :) )

It was actually a lucky strike by a last swordfish attack that turned the
tide for the Bismark.  As you know, she was making sail for
german-coltrolled waters and a last minute torpedo wrecked her rudders
making her circle and head back towards the british homefleet.  Wasn\'t it
Capt. Vian\'s destroyer group and the torpedo cruiser \'Dorsetshire\'
(spelling?) that finally finished her off?

ObTrav :  Imagine re-creating a battle similiar to this during a long gaming
session.  With all the odd things in space like nebulas and asteroide fields
and the like, it sounds like a very exciting game.  Has anyone done this?
Sure, its borrowing from history, but some of the best SF was taken from
history.  Prime example being George Lucas\'s Star Wars saga.

This is another recurring subject on the TML.  Do we have electronic
translators that translate everything that is being said into whatever
we prefer to hear?  Do they do that primarily by database matching or
primarily by following linguistic rules and guessing from context, much
as humans (and at least some other sophonts) do with languages?  What do
we hear when the translator isn\'t working?

How much does telecommunications help standardize language across the
Imperium (as opposed to upon any single world) given the time lag in
interstellar travel?
- ----

Translators are good for a pinch, but you really need to know the language
(if possible).  A translator can only convert words and syntax, it can\'t
portray the subtle racial or cultural nuances that may make diplomacy a
critical issue.  For instance, a person meets a vargr for the first time.
He may make a remark to his buddy like, "hey, he resembles a dog, doesn\'t
he?".  Imagine the translator the vargr has picking that up, analyzing the
syntax, and deciding to use the vargr word for "lower class life-form,
mindless noise-making animal".  Needless to say, the two \'guys\' don\'t
understand why they\'re suddenly facing a Gauss Rifle on fully auto.  :)

Part of this has already been "decided". The day on Mars is something
like 30 minutes longer than the day on Earth. 

So, data from probes like Viking and Sojourner had to be stored in
terms of local days. They "invented" the term "sol" (probably derived
from "solar day" ie the average period between sunrise and the next
sunrise). 

So the local day will be "one sol" regardless of what planet you are
on. Different planets will have different length sols. "One day" will
refer to the standard Imperial day of 24 hours. 

Currently, times inside Martian sols are tracked in hours, minutes,
seconds, etc. That\'s ok for scientific data. But it won\'t be
acceptable for anyplace people live. 

Things like tiome zones are needed for inhabited planets. And to make
them work, the sol has to be divided up into an *integral* number of
subdivisions. No fractional parts left over. I could go into a long
explanation as to why, but for now, just trust me. 

And you *don\'t* want to call these subdivisions of a sol "hours", that
can lead to confusions between standard hours and the local unit. It\'d
be inconvenient to find out that your "4 hour" air supply was 4 "local
hours" (which are only 40 minutes long) when you are 3 *standard* hours
out from base. 

Me, I\'m still trying to decide whether to call them "stans" (stolens
from some SF author or another), "duras" (stolen from David Brin), or
"chrons" (my own invention). Let\'s use "chrons" for now.

You want a whole number of chrons in a sol (to avoid time zones getting
*really* messy). And you want the number of chrons in a day to be
easily divisible a lot of differewnt ways, so as to make dividing the
sol up into shifts simpler (Who wants to deal with a shift that is 3.75
chrons long?)

Dividing the chron into smaller units probably isn\'t necessary. 3.5
chrons is just as easy as 3 chrons xxx stans.

So folks may use hours, minutes, seconds *and* chrons. Sort of like
English and metric.

As for synching clocks between worlds, you use a bit of math and *radio*
time signals. You check what the time signal from another world says,
and how far away it is, and you now "know" what time it is. Between
settled worlds you\'d establish a radio or laser link and echo their time
signal with a fixed "loop delay". That way they can tell how far away
they are and calculate the time lag. Then they just need to set up some
atomic clocks and just use the time signal as a cross check.

You can\'t just ship an atomic clock between stars because it\'s already
been established that the duration of a jump as measured on the ship
*doesn\'t* always match the duration as measured by the outside world.

The Imperium does control some substances, but only
as a side effect of other Imperial statutes. There is no
drug control or approval agency.  Psi-Enhancing drugs,
for example, are illegal under the Imperial Psi ban.  A 
few other drugs are also controlled under other 
"Imperial Security" related mandates.  A few of
these may be considered "recreational" by some 
elements of society.

Depends. Current wet navies use both methods (depends on the Navy). I
see no reason why different races in Traveller would not do the same.

Damaged by an attack of X-boats (miniature submarines); and then
attacked with Grand Slam bombs (22,000 lb., IIRC). She turned turtle in

any killing damage to Bismarck, but they did scrub off some important

I\'m messing with maps right now.

Initially I was thinking Spinward Marches, but I think Glenn\'s idea
is better, i.e., using a march larger portion of known space and
have these 7 factions:

Imperial, Solomani, Aslan, Zhodani, Vargr, K\'kree, and Hiver

So I\'m playing with the larger scale map now.

I\'m all for borrowing from history (I try not to let my players know too
early in campaign that I was a history major in college), but space
doesn\'t have quite as many odd things that have any tactical effect as
the movies would suggest.  Space is basically just empty.  

Battles usually occur near some objective like a planet (asteroid, high
port, research station, etc.), and you can have a few odd things there,
like satellites real and artificial, the high port, etc.  

When one side breaks off by acceleration, they can go a long way, but
eventually relativistic effects have to be dealt with ("she canna take
much more o\'this, sair; ye\'ll havta sloooow doon now!"), and it seems to
me that they\'re unlikely to reach another item in the star system in a
playable fashion.  I guess you could just compress the many game turns
between say, Earth and Jupiter.  I did a game like this once with Mayday
(almost 20 years ago).  We were fortunate to have a huge conference-type
table to play on.  We had to record how many _sheets_ of hex paper were
between the present and future position counters.  J.D. Burdick, who is
sometimes on this list, was there, and may remember more details.

Hmmm... I do like the concept of the rudder being broken:  

"All stations:  Damage report!" 

"Helm sir: we took a missile hit in the starboard m-drive; it\'s
offline.  Port m-drive is forcing us into an arc to starboard.  Port
m-drive control is out; the cables must be severed in multiple
locations.  I can\'t shut it down. Present course will return us to the
planet in 13 days ... where we will impact at approximately 0.25c."

First officer:  "It will be a great victory, sir.  Congratulations."

Captain:  "Victories such as this I don\'t need.  Engineering!  I need
control of the port m-drive now!  Get those fiber optic cables fixed!"

Why not?  Isn\'t that just more data and rules that can be fed into the
translator?  The translator is just a computer with appropriate software
and input and output devices (like voder and vocorder, but maybe others,
depending on the language).  

Yes, it\'s an enormous to attempt to put all the information about any
language into software, and yes, some information will not be known to
the programming team, and yes, the information is constantly changing so
you\'re constantly updating the programs (which should make the software
companies and their shareholders very happy), but even so I think it
will be worth the effort, especially at higher tech levels where
computers can mimic human (or other sophont) brain functions to "learn"
languages and improve their own programming.  

There will still be errors, but they\'ll probably be subtle -- but still
potentially devastating.

I agree in concept, but not in the specific example.  The Imperium has
never banned psionics -- that is, there is no Imperial Edict to that
effect.  The Imperium revoked the charters of the psionics institutes,
issued policy statements that psionics were injurious to the stability
of the realm, and engaged in manipulation of the media to stir up
anti-psionic attitudes in member worlds.  Member worlds passed all sorts
of laws against psionics, including laws against possession,
manufacture, etc. of psi drugs.

Couldn\'t one of the spinoffs of localized mega-G fields be in pumping gases
and liquids.  Under the control of some kind of computer processors varying
the intensity of the gravity fields in the pump could cause a high gradient
pumping action.  The size of the equipment must not be a problem if it\'s

24 hours, 37 minutes, and about 22 seconds.

I seem to recall from Kim Stanley Robinson\'s _Red_Mars_ trilogy
that the colonists on Mars continued to use the 24-hour Earth
clock, but added a single block of 37 minutes and many seconds
after 12:00 Midnight to keep the clocks synchronized with the local
planetary rotation, so that there was a gap of 37 1/3 minutes betweem
12:00:00 AM and 12:00:00 AM. The colonists had a name for that block
of time -- darned if I can remember what it was called, though...

But since they had Earth as their next-door neighbour, keeping some
semblance of similarity to Earth time made sense. The Martian colonists
divided their year into 24 months (not sure how many days in each month),
with the months named 1-January, 1-February, and so on to 1-December,
2-January, 2-February, and so on to the end of the year, 2-December.
(That one I had some trouble with...)

Makes perfect sense to me. Otherwise, analog clocks won\'t work vey
well.

Well, IMTU, it works like this:

Dreadnoughts and Battleships:Large, heavily armed, with some fighters for
patrol and recon. Generally 500KTd+, 3-4G. Dreadnoughts tend to have more
armour, and battleships more weapons, but the terms are interchangeable.

Cruisers: any ship designed for the mainstay of the battle line, ranging
generally from 50KTd to 500 KTd. Usually have fighters of their own.
Generally 3-4 G\'s

Battle Riders: smae size range as cruisers, carried by a tender... IMTU,
they are often local defese ships with insufficient tenders for full
mobilization. Much better armed. Ton for ton, the bad boys. No jump.

Destroyers: Smaller ships (25-100 KTd), with spinal mounts. Generally 4G+

Frigates: 10KTd-50KTd, no spinals. 4G+, designed for combat.

Escorts: Any 4G+ ship 1KTd or bigger, designed for combat. Usually under
20KTd, no spinals, and mostly designed for close in work, seldom any
carried craft except fuel shuttles.

Close escorts: Escorts smaller than 1KTd

SDB: non-jump patrol craft, 100 to 1000Td
Patrol Cutter: A patrol craft with jump drives.

they fill the following roles:
Battle Group:
A CruRon is escorted by a DesRon (composed of frigates and Destroyers,
usually 8 FF and 4 DD). Each CruRon and DesRon has an attached EsRon. The
Group also has a ScoutRon and a TankRon, and often a CarRon

EsRon: usualy 12 escorts and/or lighter frigates, but formally "Around
60KTd" of Escorts, close escorts, and maybe light frigates. Role is
interdiction of fighters and escorts, harrassment of shipping, and patrol.
A CruRon\'s EsRon will average closer to 90KTd, While a "FrigRon"  will be
closer to 150 KTd total. Sometimes assigned alone... but there is amlost
always an EsRon with a DesRon or CruRon

CruRon 12 Cruisers. Averages some 2-5MTd total, before the everpresent
EsRon is counted. The main line of battle, focuses on pounding on ships of
the enemy\'s main line, and on devastating planets.

DesRon:12 Destroyers and/or frigates. Usually, masses about 600-800KTd
total. Screens the battle line from enemy escorts. Engages enemy
destroyers. Generally, about half of all DesRons are not attached to battle
groups, but form the core of a Task Group. DesRons almost always have an
EsRon attached to them

ScoutRon: Usually cosists of 5 1 Ktd scouts, 20 Patrol Cutters, and 20 Fast
Scouts (J6, 4+G, 100-500Td). Job: Find the enemy, and Report. Survival
optional.

TankRon: Generally, J5 equipped, and capable of Jumping Twice on their
tankage. A TankRon is usually capable of only 3-4G, and usually defined as
"Carrying fuel  in excess of own needs totalling 0.25MTd" per \'Ron. Note:
Only under MT is this possible, as MT Jump Fuel is 5 times the Td of the
Jump drive, rather than 10% per Jn... so J5 means 6% of tonnage to JD, and
30% per 1J6 for fuel... so 2J5 totals only 66% of tonnage.

AssaultRon: Ships designed for carrying marines... In reality, a DesRon
with mostly frigates with lots of marines aboard.

BatRon: 12 Battle Ships or Battle Rider Tenders, averaging either 6, 9 or
12 MTd (Lt, Med, Hvy). A Heavy BatRon of BRT\'s will be carrying some 24-60
BattleRiders; This makes it a match for 3-4 CruRons, especially when
defending. There are almost no heavy Batrons of battleships. A Batron has
an Attached DesRon, and ususaly the batron has 2 attached Esrons plus the
DesRon\'s Esron, and an attached ScoutRon.

CarRon: A CruRon which relies upon fighters. IMTU, the main-line uses
20-30Td fighters with barbettes, armor, and usually 6+ G\'s. (6G from
T-plates, and usually some extra available from other methods of thrust,
like fusion rockets). The sheer number of targets just hard enought to take
two to three hits to know out makes them problematic. Plus the low sigs,
and sheer volume of fire, and their ability to change course rapidly makes
them much more dangerous.

AssaultGroup: A BatRon and a CruRon, or 2 CruRons, plus their attached
EsRons, plus 2-3 DesRons with their EsRons, plus 2-3 more EsRons, plus 2-3
AssaultRons, plus 2-4 scoutrons, plus 4 tank rons, and often a carron.
Basically, this type of group is intended to eliminate any and or all enemy
forces in a system within a week. Total displacement is often in excess of
20 MTd. Total targets is in the  thousands, counting everyone\'s fighters.

Actually, sleep research has shown that there will be *no* difficulty
adapting to a longer period, up to at least 27-28 hours. In the absence
of external time cues, our bodies *naturally* fall into a 26-30 hour
cycle. So synchronizing with anything up to your body\'s natural cycle
*won\'t* be a problem. 

Longer than 30 may be a problem. I\'d have to do some research. 

And shorter periods can be adapted to, though it takes at least a few
weeks. 

It\'s *really* long, and really short that are the problems.

But given that various navies have fought wars with crews doing "watch
& watch" (ie 4 hours on shift, 4 hours off shift), I\'d say that even an
*8* hour day could be adjusted to. Below that, and they\'ll just set up
a "schedule" that\'s got multiple sols (local days) to the shift cycle. 

And I\'d guess that 40-48 hours is the upper limit. After that, you\'d
just divide the sol into multiple shift cycles (ie treat the sol as if
it was several "days"). Or just ignore it.

Language translation is going to be a *mess*. Especially when you
consider that it is literally not *possible* to translate between many
languages in units smaller than a "sentence" (Example, German allows
long, complicated sentences. It also places the *verb* last. So until
the verb is spoken, you *can\'t* translate the sentence. Heck, until
that point even fellow German speakers aren\'r sure what your point is!)

It\'s not telecommunications that standardizes speech. It\'s audio
*media*. Audio recordings, Movies & video with sound tracks, and
broadcasts (which may be pre-recorded elsewhere).

So even though the Imperial equivalent of NPR, the BBS and various
broadcast networks are relying on shipped in "tapes" for their
"network" programming, they\'ll *still* standardize speech to a moderate
extent.

That *doesn\'t* mean that there won\'t be local dialects. But even if
there *is* a local dialect, people will understand the "media standard"
dialect. And probably speak it well enough to get along.

Consider the UK, the US, Canada and Australia. If you speak the dialect
used by American or BBC announcers, you\'ll be understood. And most
people will be able to speak it back at you. But that hasn\'t eliminated
Strine, Cockney, and the various other dialects of English in those
places. 

And it hasn\'t eliminated Canadian French, or Irish/Scots Gaelic.

Actually, you can have very *non*-subtle errors. For example, concepts
in one language that just plain *don\'t exist* in the other language.
This means that there are *simple* statements in one that can\'t be
translated *at all* into the other. You can attempt to get across the
concept, but that will require many sentences if not *paragraphs*. 

So expect that translator to have "untranslatable" pop out sometimes.
Or some sort of squawk that means the same thing.

	"He has <beep>savior faire<beep>."

	"This could result in loss of much <beep>s\'fik<beep>."

Given enough *referents* an English speaker can learn the concepts of
"savior faire" or "s\'fik". But that doesn\'t make either *translatable*
into English. It just means that that *particular* English speaker has
acquired the concept. The concept itself is *still* not part of
English. *If* it becomes useful enough to enough people then the word
may get adopted into English. Savoire faire is getting there.

The *subtle* things are stuff like equating "honor" with the Japanese
Bushido concept that is usually translated as "honor". They have a
*lot* of similarities. They are *not* the same thing. 

Ditto for equating "s\'fik" and "face".

Martian Time Slip. And it\'s *not* practical. First of all, you *have*
to keep track of time during that gap. What if something happens? Not
*everyone* will be asleep.

And because of what it does to time zones. Here on earth it\'s enough of
a mess when the difference between local time and the time in another
time zone is *fixed*.

Not really. It\'s not as if tracking only 24 hours in the day will
somehow keep them in synch with earth days. Every day they\'ll slip a
bit farther out of synch with Earth. In only 39 days they\'ll be a whole
*day* out of synch with Earth.

And that too is silly. Their months *won\'t* match up with the terran
ones except once in a great while. And using the same names merely
makes confusion more likely.

See above. It\'s why "time slip" type reckoning *won\'t* work.

Check some of the possible misjump results, for one thing. For another,
if the ship jumps between two systems moving at different velocities
*which* system says the jump took a "week".

I\'d say that most of the time it takes approximately the same time
inside and outside. But at least one "official" misjump table had the
internal duration being normal and the external being longer or vice
versa.

The British also pulled this stunt with their \'through deck cruisers\', and
the Americans often forgot to count the Iwo Jima class CVLs when doing
comparisons with the Soviet navy (just like they forgot to count all the
tanks in the maintainence pools when comparing tank numbers).

To haul this back onTrav, note that Famile Spofulam always practices full
disclosure with the class names of their ships - Leeegals really earned
their keep with \'Fast Extraction Vessels\' and \'Exploratory Trader\'. And of
course the \'Peaceful Magnetic Device\' that is the FS Gauss Gun (note to
self ... check if it could get satellites into orbit).

Waste heat is only waste heat if you waste it. Yes there will always be
losses. The question is how much energy is lost to losses, and is it lost as
**heat** energy.

For example a steam power plant wastes quite a bit of energy in the process
of creating steam, especially in the form of heating up the air surrounding
the boiler/reactor. Heat losses around the pipes are a function of the
insulating properties of the pipe covering.
Most of the energy of the steam utilized for work is converted by turbines,
but at most plants the steam coming out of the turbine is used to preheat
the water going into the boiler this steam is further utilized to seal the
condensers, and even the hot water that results is used to preheat the
water. The energy imparted to the steam is used very efficiently.

Initially steam piping wasn\'t insulated at all and heat losses to the
atmosphere were very high. Then engineers began wrapping piping. the
efficiency of the whole plant increased.  On the opposite side of the heat
equation, very good insulation is used when dealing with very cold
materials. Where I work we use liquid hydrogen at 2 degrees K. The piping is
so well insulated that you can touch the outside of the piping with your
hand. It has like four different layers, including a vacuum layer.

What I\'m proposing is a kind of thermocouple that will convert some of the
waste heat to electricity.  The electricity can them be stored in batteries
or accumulators or used. The system probably won\'t be able to convert all
the heat to electricity. And the size of the storage cells will limit the
amount of energy that can be stored. But we\'re talking waste heat management
here.  Radiate the heat away later, when there isn\'t a heavily armed assault
vessel ready to vaporize you. And who says that a black globe has no losses.
You can\'t break even, but nobody knows how close you might be able to get to
not breaking even.

HA, that reminds me. Long ago, as a student job, I was chief busboy peon in
the University\'s cafeteria for the night shift. The Cafeteria (and the
university as a whole) had a large number of fopreign nationals working there,
as that was the only place they could legally work and keep their student
visas. Anyhoo, one shift I had a someone from Brazil and someone from
Angola...I had to translate their english accents to each other, as their
nominal native tongue, Portugese, was mutually incomprehensible, and I didn\'t
speak Portugese...

Why should we assume that people would want to own air/rafts anyway?  A
public transportation model is so much more efficient. In the garage of my
building there sits a dozen or so air/rafts. When I\'m ready to go somewhere
I call one and it lands on the platform outside my apartment. I tell it
where I want to go and it takes me there.

Three or four minutes before I want to leave I use my wristcom or PDA or
whatever to call another air/raft, which is waiting by the time I get to the
platform. I\'d pay on a yearly basis, through a contract with the fleet
owner. They could worry about the maintenance and such.

The only ones to own an air/raft would be the very rich (status symbol) or
people who live in an area so isolated no fleet vehicle would be close
enough to reach them in a reasonable time. Of course businesses would own
vehicles, as would people on rural (frontier) worlds, and offworlders, who
might take their vehicles with them. Such vehicles would still hook into the
world wide traffic net, but their relative scarcity would make them a very
hot commodity to fence.

Local timekeeping vs. Imperial timekeeping.  The Imperial
clock/calendar is used for interaction with the Imperium (and
with other planets and with starships making planetfall); the
local clock/calendar is used for strictly local matters (like
local taxes, crop planting, possibly religious holidays, and so
on). YTUMV.

other sides big ships.

In essence a vessel with no sensors is a combat kill. It could perhaps
maneuver using dead reckoning, but its best bet would be to press the big
red emergency jump button, again removing the ship from any combat.

It also makes use of all those old scout ships.

Normally a ship entering jump will program so that it emerges with a
reasonable velocity and vector in its target system.  It could be possible
to program a jump so that the computer operated vessel emerges with a
relativistic velocity vectored towards a world. It would be very hard to
stop this.

In the TNE virus era some worlds may have been killed by early generation
virus doing just that.

Any thoughts on whether this would work and if so what the effect on a world

In Australia, we are (obviously) metric, but Maccas (Macdonald\'s) still has

Well, when designing starships using FF&S2, I generally use 1 metric
ton/m^3 as a default for calculating required maneuver drives.  FF&S2
uses 14 m^3 equals one dton.

Hope this helps.

Other way around.  I don\'t have any TNE materials on-hand, but the
Astrin was featured in TNE (and possibly as far back as Striker for CT),
long before G:T.  I know that the Astrin is in Striker II (for TNE), as
well as in the _Regency Vehicle Guide_ (is that the correct title?  You
TNEers know what book I mean.).

GT uses an average of 5 metric tons per displacement ton.  Don\'t now if
it\'s precise, but it looks a decent figure of merit.  For a real-world
comparison, 20-ft ISO containers (roughly 3m x 3m x 6 m) are about 4-dtons
and typically weigh in at around 20 metric tons.

Have you looked at all at GT: Far Trader?  It\'s got some very sound
economic underpinnings.

If I recall correctly, the "Martian Time Slip" (thanks for that one,
by the way) was established when all of the Martian colonists were in
the same location.

I would imagine that the Time Slip would be simultaneous across the
entire planet... so that it\'s after midnight for some, after 4:00 pm
for others...

The intent wasn\'t to keep in synch with Earth, it was a way to keep
using the familiar units of hours, minutes, and seconds, and to be
able to use them unchanged.

Again, the intent wasn\'t to keep in synch with Earth, but to adapt
familiar units into the Martian year. Personally, I\'d come up with an
entirely new set of "months" for Martian date-keeping, with completely
new names.

On the other hand, that means learning up to 24 new month names. A
better system would have been to just establish Earth GMT as Martian
Standard Time, and keep using the Earth date.

Misjumps don\'t count. By definition, they are jump errors -- we can
easily have them include temporal errors as well as spatial ones.

And how fast individual star systems are moving through space does not
affect how fast time passes for the system, unless the system is for
some reason moving at relativistic speeds. If I have two clocks that are
synchronized, take one on a Jump to Alpha Centauri, then jump back, I
would expect the clocks to still be synchronized.

The key difficulty is merging what Common and Civil (i.e. Roman-Germanic)
Law systems with the essentially feudal government of the Imperium.
The 3I is a government of men and not laws.

Also, there is complexity from have member worlds that can have
totally contradictory laws.

How do you define the distinction between felony and misdemeanor
crimes?  Many US states simple define a misdemeanor as a crime
for which the punishment is a maximum of one year.  Others don\'t
have the distinction at all.

What you suggested so far seems to be without a real foundational
structure for law in the 3I that agrees with canon.  I\'ve commented
specifically below.

> HIGH CRIMES (Crimes Against the Imperium / Emperor)
> Assassination

But there is a "Right of Assassination."  General "assassination" is
just another name for murder, when the victim was of high status.
it isn\'t defined as a separate crime in anything I\'ve ever encountered.
For a more "feudal"

> Treason
> Terrorism

Another "crime" which is actually just another name for other crimes, i.e.,

murder, kidnapping, assault, etc.

> Espionage
> Sabotage
> Mutiny

A military crime, technically.  If you\'re going to make that distinction.

> Rebellion / Insurrection
> Extortion / Threats Against the Emperor
> Piracy
> HiJacking
> Jury / Witness Tampering

So you presuppose Trial by Jury?

> Corruption / Bribery

Of who?  Presumable only Imperial agents and officers.  (Agent in the
"representative" capacity, not the T4 career).

> Ecocide

The Imperium rules the space between the planets.  Not the planets.
Unless its Ecodide against vacuum or jump space, this is clearly an
issue for member worlds (with the exception of systems wholy
controlled by the 3I).

> Genocide
> Misappropriation

Hmm.  Which definition are you thinking of?

> Trespassing

As a "high crime?"  Trespassing is a crime against property.
If no other crimes are committed in the course of trespassing,
its a minor crime.

> Counterfeiting

Imperial currency, I presume.  Would probably also apply to
member world currency for the impact on commerce that might
have.

> Fraud

Against the Emperor, that makes sense if its on a large enough scale.
Against Imperial Citizens?  Felony.

> Robbery

Of Imperial Citizens?  Not a high crime.

> Impersonation

Of?  Presumably Imperial authories.

> Conspiracy

To commit any other high crime, I presume?

> Racketeering / Criminal Enterprise

> Official Misconduct
> Obstruction of Justice
> Contempt of the Emperor

Are you going to attempt to define this?  I\'m not sure it can be.
I think contempt and obstruction might merge.

> Destruction

Of?  How different from sabotage?  No shoe throwing?

> Harboring a Fugitive
> Killing Protected Species

Sounds more like disregarding an Interdiction, probably IISS.

> Perjury / Subornation of Perjury
> Providing False Testimony or Report

How are these two distinct?  I suggest not at all.

> Rioting / Loiting

This is another term for other crimes.  Theft, destruction of property,
etc.
Perhaps you mean "inciting" violence.

> Breaking Medical Quarantine

IMO, better defined as ignoring Imperial authority.

> Possession

Of?  Drugs?  Not really an Imperial concern. Slaves or weapons of mass
destruction, sure.  Imperial property without authorization, that sounds
good too.

> Trafficking

Of?  Slaves?  Sure, thats clearly an Imperial crime. Other things? Not
clear
at all.

> Solication

Of?  To commit a crime?  Sure.  Of anything else?  Doubt it.

> Smuggling / Tech Running

For the Imperium, the only things that are clearly contraband, and thus,
possible to be "smuggled" are slaves and weapons of mass destruction.
Otherwise, its by the various laws of member worlds.  Unless you mean
to include violating Red Zones, but IMO, that might better be defined as
a different crime.

"Tech running"?  That could clearly only be a concern member worlds
(with the possible exception of running IISS interdiction efforts to
preserve
low-tech cultures - but then still better defined as ignoring Imperial
authority
or something of that nature).

> Burning the Imperium Flag or Emblem

Why limited to burning?  "Defacing" is a broader term.


[snip]

Ok, no offense but I\'m going to go nuts and upset you if I keep looking
at each crime you\'ve listed.  Suffice to say that some of the crimes you
list are reduntant and some of the property crimes aren\'t.

I\'m not clear what you\'re trying to do.  It almost appears as if in
YTU there is one law for everyone.  In the canon 3I, this isn\'t the
case.  It has been said repeatedly that the 3I governs the space
between the stars, not the planets that orbit those stars.  The
greatest crimes in the 3I are slavery, using weapons of mass destruction,
and the Imperial Rules of War.  After that, things that interfere with
interstellar commerce (which admittedly might allow for US commerce
clause-like inflation of power, but there are very good reasons for this
not to happen on the same scale as it has in the US).

Remember, the 3I allows member worlds to _war_ with each other.
Any scheme of law you devise has to include that.  And while I agree
there would be an agreed upon body general law governing territories
exclusively controlled by the Imperium, I\'m not yet convinced that it
would be a lengthy and exhaustive code, such as it appears you are
trying to create.  After all, there are nobles on the scene, or nearby,
that have the authority to make the rules within certain constraints.

I think you need to first build a legal foundation for YTU first, and
then see what laws would follow.  You can try working the other
way if you want, but I think its more difficult by a level of magnitude.

Some good questions to ask:
From where does the authority to create law derive?
How is that implemented?
What limits the laws that may be created and enforced?

Other things important to keep in mind:
The laws of member worlds vary _greatly_, and can be in direct
contradiction to each other.
Democracies are rare, consequently, so is trial by jury I suspect.
High nobles have some authority to make law.

That would be density 1, right? 1 metric ton = 1 m^3 is the density 
of *water.* Not very believable unless 99% of interstellar cargoes 
are water. Or am I missing something?

I am estimating something between 2 and 3, but have no real data.

That\'s density 5, around the density of earth IIRC. Seems way too

Here\'s what I have so far:

The command module\'s rounded edges simplified another design decision.
Faget wanted to use beryllium shingles on the afterbody, as he had in
Mercury, to take care of reentry heating, but Langley engineers believed
the spaceship would be traveling too fast for shingles to handle the
heat. The design group decided to wrap an ablative heatshield around the
whole
command module. This wraparound shield had another advantage. One of the
big questions about outer space was radiation exposure. James Van Allen,
discoverer of the radiation belts surrounding the earth and named for
him, had predicted exposure would be severe. Encapsulating the space
vehicle with ablative material as an additional guard against radiation,
even though it entailed a large weight penalty, was a big selling point
for the heatshield.

The source for the above material is at:

http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4205/cover.html

[the quoted material is in Chapter 2, in the section entitled
"Spacecraft Development Decision"]

Hope this helps!

 "Regency Combat Vehicle Guide" one of the last TNE products. Despite
its combat concentration, it\'s still a more useful book than T4 Emperor\'s

I believe the media is more important than the time lag to standardization.
If information is primarily via written message (like this mail list) then
local language will have dialect variations. In some cultures in the past
the written and spoken form became (or was always) decoupled. China is a
good example. One official written language, many dialects, or perhaps many
written languages with one primarily read by many, still not related to the
specific language.

If information is primarily transmitted in video or audio formats then the
establishment of Standard Galanglic is much more likely.  So the question
is: Is TNS transmitted as text which is broadcast as email (like the old
teletypes) or read by a local broadcaster in a local dialect? Is it recorded
locally where the news happens and then sent everywhere to be broadcast?
Does more news originate at Capital? This could reinforce the
standardization of language, especially if the feeling is that news
reporters are more trustworthy if they speak "official" Galanglic.

(This is very much the case in the U.S.  Over the past twenty years or so
even local broadcasters strive to speak in the bland
Midwestern/California/New York combined dialect that permeates the national
broadcast networks.)

That\'s why I said "possibly."  I haven\'t looked at CT Striker in over 15

There is a sample Imperial Marine Grav APC (TL15), but it\'s not given a 
name.  It may have inspired the Astrin, but they are quite different, apart 
from the different design sequences.

Actually, I\'ve always wondered about this - whether your continued momentum
is absolute or relative to the local gravity gradient. If it\'s relative to
the gravity gradient then you\'re changing the total momentum of the universe
(which would imply not) but if it\'s local you can bugger around with
potential energy a lot, jumping to the outside of the gravity well, sliding
down to build up speed and then jumping out and repeating the procedure to
build up more. The only way I can see to circumvent this is if part of the
jump fuel is to act as an energy sink to balance this out, but we\'re talking
about a LOT of gravitational potential for a world like a gas giant, or a
star.

Any opinions, anyone?

There was a mini campaign called The Lone Gray (sic) Wolf, about a Klingon
C8 Dreadnought on a diplomatic mission to discuss peace terms with the
Federation which became trapped waaaay behind enemy lines and had to run out
through elements of the 4th (I think) Fleet. It had a Bismarck kind of feel
to it, since you\'d run into it with light ships and have to harry it and
slow it down to let your heavy cruisers and battle line catch it. Is that
what you were thinking of?

I would say limit 3I legal code to Imperial High Crimes and Civil crimes
involving contract law.  This means that False Detention / Imprisonment and
Peonage / Slavery is an Imperial High Crime, due to Slavery prohibited by
The Warrant of Restoration. Most High Crimes should flow from the Warrant of
Restoration and its interpretation by Imperial legal scholars over the ages.
Since Imperial Law is not precedent based (Rule of Men not Laws) the
original drafting\'s should be narrower in effect than in the present day
United States. In other words, very little judicial expansion of existing
laws.

I would expect things like theft, fraud, mutiny to be crimes against Free
Trade, and punished as Imperial High Crimes. Murder on board ship might be a
violation of some Imperial Ministry of Commerce rule rather than an Imperial
crime of itself. Trade would suffer greatly if citizens did not feel safe
aboard ship in even highly patrolled core areas, because one of their fellow
passengers could kill them without fear of law. Murder at an Imperial
Starbase might be a violation of some Imperial Starport Authority rule. I
would remind those reading that murder itself is not a federal crime in the
U.S., although military bases, for instance, prohibit murder through the
Uniform Code of Military Justice. Such crimes committed in the U.S. are
prosecuted by the states. Murder on a world that is a member of the Imperium
would probably be prosecuted locally. Low Law Level worlds might not even
prosecute murder in most circumstances.

Burglary, Trespassing and environmental crimes would only be applicable
against Imperial property. Impersonation, stowaway, Identity theft would be
more crimes against trade. Like forgery and Embezzlement(that spans more
than one world) these crimes could cause a loss of confidence in the ability
of the Imperium to protect trade among worlds.  If I can\'t trust your Letter
of Credit how can I do business with you? You pursue someone whose skipped
with a jumpship **not** for theft, but because they aren\'t making their
payments, which is breach of contract, a crime affecting Free Trade.

I think you get the idea. I just don\'t see the Imperium caring about Public
Solicitation or even stalking. You might make a case for Exploitation of
Children being akin to slavery, but except for things like psi drugs I don\'t
see possession as being an Imperial crime.

I believe that the time spent **in** jumpspace does not flow at the same
rate as time in the normal universe. So while "about a week" passes for the
ship in jumpspace "about a week" passes in both systems, **BUT** the "about
a week" on the ship is 606400 secs and the "about a week" in the systems is
604800 secs.

They can, but not in relation to the sol. That\'s why I rather expect
that shifts and schedules would be done in chrons and fractions
therefof, and most other timekeeping would still be in hours, minutes
and seconds.

Sorry, atomic clocks are so precise that you can synchronize three of
them, keep one, and send the other two by plane in *opposite*
directions around the earth and measure the time differences due to
relativistic effects! They\'ve *done* this experiment.

They\'ve also measured the difference in time rate between the top and
bottom of a tall building due to the effects of *gravity* on time. The
deeper you are in a gravirty well, the slower time flows.

So you\'ve got the effects of acceleration *and* velocity on the clock
that travels *as well* as the effects of moving around in both the
planetary *and* stellar gravity wells.

I think the only real test would be to have two clocks. One on each of
two ships a few miles apart. One ship does a "null jump" (ie jump to
its current location). The other just sits there. A week later, the
first ship pops out of jump and they compare clocks. 

I\'d be willing to bet that they are different. If nothing else, there\'s
*no* external gravity affecting the ship in jump. Try, the small radius
of the jump buble may affect time as well. But that effect is *very*
unlikely to match the gravity effects of the point the ship left.

Also, since J-Space is obviusly only "loosely" connected to normal
space, expecting the time rates to match, or even have a *fixed*
relationship is a bit much. 

Anyway, given that durations of even *normal* jumps vary, it seems to
only make sense that the ratio of normal time to jump time might vary a
little. That makes the *big* discrepancies in misjumps more reasonable.

It also means that not only are there researchers trying to find a way
to make longer jumps, there would be ones trying to shorten the
*duration* of jumps. Being able to *reliably* make a jump of the normal
distance in only *6* days would be a *major* advantage. Heck, merely
cutting the average duration by an hour or two has imprtant
implications.

For one, it means that your ships have a better chance of *catching*
that ship that just jumped out of the system. If they both have the
same average jump duration, and variance in duration, there\'s only
about a 25% chance of getting there first. But any change in the
average *or* in the variance can change the odds.

Definitely. Also, by the end of the trilogy some folks will have
managed to pick up some idea of the concepts behind things like the Kif
term "s\'fik" or the mahendosat (can\'t remember the word) "ranking"
system.

If you can wrap your mind around mahen *or* kif "mindsets" you\'ll have
made a good start towards being able to play K\'kree, Hiver, Vargyr, and
Droyne the way they *should* be played. You\'ll just need to develop the
"ethology" of the species yourself since available materials are rather
lacking. At least with the Vargyr you can check out research done with
wolves, and try to project that forward.

For K\'Kree, I\'d pick some sort of herd animal that *fights* rather than
flee. Say buffalo. 

Hivers and Droyne are the real problems.

It depends on *what kind* of cargo you are talking about. 

1 dton = 13.5 m^3 or 14 m^3 depending on which rules set you use.

1 ton/m^3 is the density of water. Most foodstuffs average around this.
Grains are lighter, meats, fruits and veggies tend to be denser. You
can look up the density of various metals and rocks to get how many
ton/m^3 they mass. Aluminum is 2.??, Titanium is 4, average rock is
around 3-5, iron and copper are around 8, lead is 11.3, mercury is
13.6, gold is 19.3, and platinum group metals are up around 21-23.

You sure about that? That seems pretty light. It\'d be ok for
manufactured goods where most of the container is "air & packing". 

How do they ship stuff like lumber or steel plate? Those will be *much*
denser (lumber around 7-14 tons per dton, steel plate around 112 tons
per dton!)

No, that\'s 5 tons per *14* cubic meters. Or a specific gravity of .36.
Lighter than most woods.

Remember! One *displacement* ton is 13.5 to 14 cubic meters.

True, but what you are doing there is improving the efficiency. Even at
100% efficiency, the energy produced is limited by the temperature
difference between the heat source and the heat sink.

No, you don\'t. :-)

Hydrogen *freezes* at something like 15-18 K. Helium I\'d believe.

You are misunderstanding the terminology. For example, your
thermocouple has to have a "hot" end ans a "cold" end. Energy
production is again dependent on the *difference* in temperature *as
well as* the efficiency with which the temp difference is converted to
energy.

The lower the difference, the less energy gets produced. And it\'s a 4th
power curve as I recall.

I just did some digging and I can\'t find the equation. But the
essential point is that efficiency, source temp, and sink temp are
*directly* related. The amount of energy you can produce with an XX
percent efficient "engine" is *determined* by the difference between
the input temp and the output temp.

On a spaceship, the output temp is the temp of the radiator! So no
matter *how* you wiggle around, your stuck with that. Thermodynamics
says it\'s *impossible* to play some types of game. Your "waste heat" is
what goes out the radiators.

There is no end to the criminal laws.

I think you might look into such things as the Napoleanic Code, the
French Constitution, the German laws (name escapes me at the moment),
and the Justinian Code.

There are crimes you have missed, and some you\'ve added that aren\'t
really separate crimes.  But it would take too much time, and you\'d
have to pick a single \'authoritative\' source for the criminal law.  And what is
a crime is going to be determined in large part by who or what makes
the laws.  And the Third Imperium, the only reason the Emporer needs
to give to throw you in the slammer, is one that doesn\'t cause rebellion.

Take a look at my draft on the legal foundations.

I\'ve usually seen it in the context of containerized military cargoes.
Trucks designed to carry 20-ft ISO boxes or flatracks usually have a max
load of 16 to 20 tons.  That is a cross-country figure, so they may be
assuming the boxes will be loaded light, but it seems unlikely.

Oh, here\'s another data point.  It\'s not uncommon for cargo containers to
be washed overboard and drift at sea.  They often float just barely
submerged for quite some time.

The standardized cargo containers in Far Trader are basically ISO boxes.
ISTR one of the designers or playtesters had some connection with the
shipping industry and had confirmed that the cargo density figures were
sensible.

They didn\'t *have* shielding. They weren\'t in the Van Allen belts long
enough to need it. They tried to keep the launches to period when
flares weren\'t expected. If a flare *had* occured during the mission,
they\'d have had an hour or so\'s warning from satellites (there\'s an
x-ray surge that travels at the speed of light, followed by the high
energy protons, which tale from 45 minutes to several hours to reach
earth)

The Service Module (SM) was kept pointing towards the sun for this
exact reason. The equipment inside it, especially the liquid hydrogen
would absorb most of the protons. The astronauts would be relatively
safe in the "shadow" of all this material. 

This also affected the lander missions. It\'s why they couldn\'t go too
far from the lander. They had to be able to get back, launch, and
rendezvous with the CSM *before* the high energy protons got there.

The Imperium tends to get a bit excited about P****y, which tends to
involve a lot of the issues like \'murder on board ship\', skipping, stowaway
and so on.  This is pretty much what the Imperium was created to combat, to
the extent that it was created to do anything other than allow Citizen
Zhunastu to Rule the Galaxy.

It would be fair to put these P****y related crimes at the centre of an
Imperial law code.

Of course, ship registration comes into all this.  The Solomani would tend
to get a bit sarcastic about the application of Imperial law on board their
vessels, and so would the Zhodani, and so on.  Non-Imperial registered
ships would then be considered to be part of their state of origin\'s
territory, and thus not subject to Imperial law.  This is probably less
true for some non-Imperial states than others.  The IN probably doesn\'t
recognise certain Vargr states when it is convenient for them not to, for
example.

Then you run into Free Traders.  Some of them are probably effectively
stateless.  Most of these will, however, maintain a nominal home port,
either inside or outside the Imperium.  (Client states could be quite
popular, if they have suitable trade agreements with the Imperium, and a
conveniently loose set of laws.  Of course, they may also have agreements
regarding the enforcement of Imperial law on \'their\' ships operating inside
the Imperium.)  Some may even regard themselves as being mini-states in
their own right, or else as being part of nomadic fleet/societies.  It\'s
unlikely that the IN would accept this kind of excuse.  

In the end the stuff about the Imperium being ruled by sentients, not laws,
breaks down to:  that IN Destroyer has bigger guns than you, and is asking
you to cooperate.

There is another rather basic Imperial law, and it\'s the one authorising
the use of Imperial Warrants.  With a Warrant, you can make whatever laws
you want within your area of authority, and the Imperial apparatus will
attempt to enforce them.  Just don\'t foul up, or if you do, don\'t get
caught.  The other use of an Imperial Warrant is to order the arrest,
execution and fair trial of a preceding possessor of a Imperial Warrant.

Hmm, maybe this is how Emperor Olav implemented his changes to the
functioning of the Imperium - by handing out Warrants to all the Admirals,
authorising them to take charge of the civilian apparatus in their areas of
responsibility (with the assistance of their fleets, of course!).

And other languages, like russian, often deviate from standardized word
orders. Plus the noun-verb ending patterns, changes in pronunciation with
context (both homonyms and cases where adding a particular ending winds up
being a homonym for a different word with a different ending), and ending
derived assignment of subject vs object vs object_of_the_preposition....

Also, the problems arising from fairly effective translation are even more
amusing. One excersie we did in my russian class was for study partners to
work as follows:
	A translates from russian to english out of book.
	B Translates back to russian.
Do this a few times, and you can wind up with some really spectacular
errors, even if each translation is essentially correct. Certain
applications of this problem have already occurred in real life,
specifically in, and the bible. Many translations of the bible are in fact
translations of translations, like the King James version. (Most bibles in
local tongues were translated either from all-greek sources or all-latin
sources, ranther than from the mixture of Hebrew, Greek, amd Aramaic. The
All-greek sources generally include the original greek for those NT books
in greek. The Latin sources, especially the Vulgate, are generally
translations of the greek versions.) For example, the standard Chruch
Slavonic bible used by the Byzantine Catholics is a translation from the
greek translation used by the Byzantine patriarcate. The King James
translation was taken from the latin vulgate, which was a translation
itself of the greek version, which included translations of the old
testament and a couple of books written in aramaic. Whats more, there is a
"Modern Language Translation" of the King James! And, in most of these, one
small tidbit from the old testament CANNOT be translated with any
assurances of accuracy, since that passage is in the Torah without the jot
and tidles (the vowels)....

IMTU, it works much like this, too. But for worlds that vary significantly
(for example, Sols under 16 hours, ormore than 36) generally the locals
will use SST (Sylea Standard Time) and ignore the sol. Also, IMTU, most
starports keep a computer-averaged time baseline by the travels of large
numbers of small atomic clocks... like the one in every starhip\'s computer
(Again IMTU). It may take a few years to get a viable average, but it will
keep time consensual...

Adventure seed: Having some how stranded players on a world with a day that
is off,  and having gotten them away from the port, have some local
business deal set by local time, right near holiday. The local bumpkins may
know the shift is 3.566432 hours, but will they know when holiday is, so
that the errant travellers can get their annuity payments, TAS benefits,
and such?

Another adventure seed: Passenger comes aboard, bring a large group, and
with some impressive credentials, and says "I\'ll be back aboard tomorrow at
5" and runs back to his local office. Problem is you know he\'s going HOME
this trip. Which "2" did he mean? Local Sols? His Homeworld Sols? SST?
Ship\'s Homeworld Sols? (I\'ve done the latter to PC\'s... they assumed local
time, but he assumed their homweorld\'s time. In this case Ship\'s Reg. HW
Sols > Local Sols > SST > Psnger HW Sols... Fortunately, the passenger was
forgiving, and the PC\'s may have lost their spot in the clearance list, but
they DID wait for him. Was really fun, since they had recently installed a
Ship\'s Home Port Time clock in the lounge. And, little did they know, they
got selected by him because he was Born at the planet of registry of the
ship, and wanted to be reminded of home, and still carried a clock on his
real homeworld\'s time.)

If you have two sufficiently accurate atmoic clocks, and fly one around the
planet three times, leaving the other at one spot, they will be out of
snych. Have read that the USAF has tried this.

	To my understanding, it is not mathematically possible to have a
reversible mapping from 3 dimensions into 2 dimensions. That is, a
mapping that has the property that for every point in a 3D space,
there exists one and only one corresponding point in the 2D space,
and for every point in the 2D space, there exists one and only one
corresponding point in the 3D space.

	Sorry, but a globe is NOT a 3D->2D mapping. It is essentially a
mapping from one 2D frame into another. Both represent a *surface*,
which is 2D. Try this ... map the real world into any 2D
representation, such that for each 3D point there is one and only 2D
point. Hint: don\'t forget objects at different heights ...

I figure that most cargoes will have packing materials (reducing the net
mass per m^3), and that "full" cargo bays still allow for some space for
personnel movement, overhead clearance, etc.  I use 1 metric ton per m^3
as a "rule-of-thumb" figure for generic cargo.  If the ship\'s usual
cargo is known (for instance, a tanker carrying refined fuel to a system
with neither gas giants nor worlds with significant hydrographics), I
adjust accordingly.

Besides, most of my merchant designs tend to be passenger oriented, and
(IIRC) luggage averages about 1 metric ton per m^3.

Keep in mind that luggage has an important effect on the available cargo
space for merchant ships (at least those with a bias toward passenger
traffic).  Don\'t forget to subtract the average passenger\'s luggage
space from a given ship\'s cargo capacity.  For instance, a standard Far
Trader from T4 can expect to carry up to six High passengers, plus up to
ten Low passengers, thus subtracting up to 6.1 dtons from its 64.9 dton
cargo capacity.

Note that, under T4 standard rates for freight and passengers, a ship
can earn Cr 1000 per ton of space dedicated to freight.  High passengers
earn just under Cr 2000 per dton dedicated to High passengers (Cr 10,000
for the ticket, divided by 5 dtons [4 dtons for the large stateroom, and
1 dton of luggage], with some additional overhead for life support).
Middle passengers earn about Cr 3700 per dton dedicated to Middle
passengers (Cr 8000 for the ticket, divided by 2.1 dtons [2 dtons for
either half of a large stateroom or a private small stateroom, and .1
dton of luggage], plus some overhead for life support).  Low passengers
earn just under Cr 1000 per dton (Cr 1000 for the ticket, divided by
1.01 dtons [low berth plus luggage]).  Of course, Middle passengers
require fewer stewards and medics than either High or Low passengers.

Obviously, a ship with a high ratio of passenger staterooms to cargo
holds requires a smaller maneuver drive (since staterooms have low mass
per m^3) than a ship with a large cargo hold.

Now you see why AuricTech passenger ship designs tend to cater to Middle
passengers....

	In order to do this, you have to let the heat "flow downhill" just
like you have to let water flow downhill to generate electricity.
That means that you can only generate electricity from heat if you
have a heat sink at a lower temperature than the source ...

In other words, you map from 3-D to 2-D by approximation.  Ideally, on
larger-scale maps, you have the space to indicate relative altitude by
using such conventions as contour lines.

Of course, the accuracy of your efforts can be enhanced both by using
sophisticated surveying techniques, and by increasing the scale of your
maps (a 1:10,000 scale map is more detailed than a 1:1,000,000 scale
map).  A series of large-scale maps can also include more subtle
adjustments for such factors as the curvature of the world and the
difference (if any) between true (axial) North and magnetic North.

	When I\'m talking mapping in this context, I don\'t mean mapping as in
drawing contour lines or coming up with a rough approximate
representation. I\'m talking more in a technical sense of setting up a
mathematically-describable relationship between points in RealSpace
and points in JumpSpace, such that it\'s possible to start at a known
point in RealSpace, move (via JDrive) to the corresponding point in
JumpSpace, travel through JumpSpace to another position in JumpSpace,
and return to RealSpace at a desired location. 

	It\'s perfectly possible to map from one 2D space to another. All the
various cartographic representations are mappings from one 2D space
(the surface of an idealized earth sphere) to various other 2D spaces
(the surface of a piece of paper). Going from lat/long to XY and back
is repeatable ... if I put in one coordinate in lat/long, and get the
corresponding XY coordinates on a piece of paper, not only do I know
that I can also convert those XY coordinates back and get my original
lat/long, but I also know that anybody else will get the same
results.

	How do you do this for 3D->2D? I can\'t just mape from XYZ to X\'Y\'
coordinates ... for each X\'Y\' coordinate there\'s an infinite number
of corresponding Z coordinates. How do I generate the original XYZ
coordinate back out without foreknowledge? And if I somehow "know"
the correct Z coordinate, then it is in fact a 3D coordinate system
...X\'Y\'Z.

Somehow I don\'t think I need to keep re-setting my watch whenever I go
up into the upper floors of a tall building.

Okay, if we\'re talking something as precise as an atomic clock, you
may have a point. But when I suggested my two-clocks experiment, I was
thinking something on the order of my wristwatch -- the one that, after
10 years and three battery changes, still keeps time accurately enough
that six months after I set to to the CBC Radio Time Signal, it\'s only
two or three seconds off.

If the difference is anything less than a few seconds, I\'m not going
to sweat it. For most everyday purposes, that\'s close enough to being
in synch.

Given that we\'re dealing with a fictional, hypothetical construct
in the first place, we can give it whatever properties we want.

As I said earlier, misjumps don\'t count.

The important point is, if at Noon on Day 1 of the year 1115 I get into
my ship and do a grand tour of the Dagudashaag Sector, and return at
noon on Day 300, the clock in my bedroom back on my homeworld, from
which I started the grand tour, will more than likely be close enough
to the clock I carried with me that I\'m not going to have to worry
about it much. Even a discrepancy of a few minutes is trivial.

Now, if for every 70 days I spend subjectively in jump space (10 jumps),
71 days pass in the real universe (or vice versa), then we\'re on to
something. But I\'m not going to quibble about seconds and/or fractions
thereof.

Of course, it may be prosecuted by your victim\'s brother-in-law, his

Even if we aren\'t talking about vigilante justice, the "fewer laws, harsher

mean the people are lawless, it just means the cops have fewer
reasons/opportunities to harass you - and it also means fewer cops.

A Texas cattletown of the old west may have been almost law level 0,
but the Sheriff could still call a posse together if the need was great
enough - and then there\'s always the famous bit about the single

My 1st edition copy has "The Lone Gray Wolf" as a running series of

units - kzinti, the kitty-kats who love missiles and fighter-shuttles.
The Klingons blamed Kzinti treachery, the Kzinti claimed the Klingons
were up to something, the results were that diplomatic negotiations
turned into war, with the C8 DN low on fuel, deep in enemy territory
and in deep trouble.

The Klingon dreadnaught has limited fuel (so it has limits on how often
it can escape a particular task group by outrunning it), no reloads for
its missile tubes, and only a limited repair capability between encounters.

One interesting tactic suggested for the scenario was to take an early
risk, take a bloody nose and capture an enemy light unit reasonably
intact (boarding parties, away!!). This unit could then either be used
as a suicide ship, as a much-needed escort, or (since it *wasn\'t* low
on fuel) to run at top speed for the Klingon border once the Klingon
dreadnaught was a lost cause.

*eventually* reach relativistic speed (90-95% of c?)  For those more adept
at physics (and less mathematically challenged than myself), I have a few
questions:

1) How does one translate between CT\'s "1G acceleration" and kilometers per
second?

2) When CT says that the fuel requirements for the powerplant is calculated
to be adequate for one month\'s worth of life-support, maneuver drive and
anything else that uses EPs shipboard, how much sustained 1G maneuver does
that include, if the powerplant (and its fuel) were dedicated to the drive
alone?

3) What are the formula for calculating how long it would take (t=) for a
ship accelerating at (nG) to reach a velocity of 269,813 km/sec (approx.
90%c)?

4) What are the formula for calculating the difference in time dilation
between 90%c and 98%c (approx. 293,797 km/sec)?

I realize that the biggest roadblock to relativistic travel is the fuel
requirement.  Even though the pilot may not pass through much time at 98%c,
the engines still must consume enough fuel to sustain the velocity of the
ship (which has now become *much* more massive), every kilometer of the
incredible distance traveled.  The only vaguely conceivable way to do it
would be along the lines of, say, a *massive* electromagnetic \'ram-scoop\'
utilized to gather the scarce hydrogen between stars as a continuous source
of fuel all along the way, without adding to the mass of the vessel.  I know
that sounds pretty \'high\' sci-fi (though not quite as \'high\' as Jump...)

____________________________________________________
ObTrav:

Canon maintains that several worlds inhabited by humaniti are isolated (or
were), because the population arrived there via sub-light \'generation
ships,\' or the like.  My view on this is that long before Jump Drive would
have been invented/discovered and utilized effectively, many cultures would
have explored sub-light travel extensively.  And if a generation ship were
called for, to go out and create a colony at a distant star system, then it
is already a \'one-off\' affair (meaning that the ship\'s crew will not be
intending on meeting the people they left on their world of origin ever
again.)  They are striking out new, completely on their own in the pre-jump
universe.

It follows, therefore, that they would likewise not be concerned about the
effect of time dilation at relativistic velocity.  A generation colony ship
(in the pre-jump future) need not take a hundred or a thousand years to
creep to their new home, at least not from the point of view of the ship\'s
occupants.  If, after a long period of slingshots and acceleration and
generally building up speed, the ship\'s velocity nears c, then their
destination could be realized well within their lifetime (if not the
lifetimes of those back on their original homeworld).

Even in the post-jump universe, some people may still have a need for
relativistic, sub-light vessels.  To reach star systems that are further
than 6 parsecs away, is an obvious one.  Explorers, escapists, frontiersmen,
anyone who wants to either go very far away, or escape from their
\'timeframe\' (which wouldn\'t necessarily even require leaving the subsector).
Of course, from the point of view of anyone (or anything) travelling at 90+%
of c, great distances can be covered in little time.

In the uber-tech of the 3I, it is not inconceivable that a vessel could be
constructed to take maximum advantage of powerplant efficiency and maneuver
drive performance, for the express purpose of achieving relativistic
\'maneuver\' velocity.  If you don\'t care about the fact that the trip is,
essentially, one-way, then there are (theoretically) little limits on your
maximum range -- within one lifetime.  Fuel requirements, as I see it, would
be the biggest problem with this whole idea...

Mucho, mucho thanks for any help with the questions above!

Generally, the law of the country of registration is in force on the ship.
But other things to consider are where the ship is (assuming it comes to
port), the nationality of the victim, and the nationality of the defendant.
All of these nations, assuming they are different, have some valid claim
to jurisdiction to try the case.

Have no dbout about it.  This is _very_ messy international law.
We have the UN Law of the Sea Treaty to help ease this mess.
IMO, the Imperial Ministry of Justice would have a similar policy
established, after all, with a thousand years of history, I don\'t think
it is reasonable to believe that the Imperium hasn\'t addressed it
clearly and with finality.

So, IMTU, Murder in High Space is an Imperial crime, same as within
the extraterritorial area of a starport.  Why?  No one else _clearly_ has
jurisdiction (under a theory of the situs of the crime is the most relevant
place).
[And the Emperor has a monopoly on the lawful use of violence within
the territory he governs - except for self-defense].
However, this is in the nature of a general rule that local nobles can alter, i.e.,
interstellar travellers expect this rule, but aren\'t surprised if a local noble
decides to do something else.  What else might the noble do?
Dismiss the case, give one world the jurisdiction to prosecute and/or
\'deal with\' as Mr. Smith suggested, or whatever.


> I assume that if the crime was committed in a nations territorial limits
> jurisdiction would then go to that nation?

Well, a big question is where is the defendant.  What is not unusual
(at least prior Law of the Sea Treaty, which I am not up to date on),
is for a nation with custody of the defendant to actually conduct the
trial, but to use the laws of the nation of registration of the ship
the alleged crime was committed on.  This gets messy politically and
judicially, especially when there are drastic differences between the
laws of the two countries.

I really doubt that this would happen, though some states may prefer it.
Its much easier for the MoJ to decide which laws to apply (if not its own
as I prefer), and apply those laws.  If there is a return trip, it\'s sure to be
on the world\'s dime.

I think he was referring to "The Mighty Hood Goes Down" where the Hood
(a Fed CA) is abmushed by 3 or 4 ships (Romulan KRs, I think).

That reminded me more of the "Kobiashi Maru" <sp?> test from STII-TWoK
than the historical battle.

In addition to your "Lone Gray Wolf" scenario (I hadn\'t thought of the
Bismarck link before) there was "The Pleiades Turkey Shoot" where an
unending stream of out of date (ie early war) Klingon fighters try and
take out a Fed Carrier Battle Group and fail.

I think that this was inspired by a WWII action in the Pacific.

Why, of course! The question is, the *average* density across all 
cargoes in interstellar trade, in a typical TL-12+ society. I am not 
talking about details, I am talking about an aggregate macroeconomic 
number. Something that allows a conversion between total weight 
traded and total volume traded. Actually, if I had both numbersm I 
would have the average density I want.

Yep, for any specific ship, it\'s easy, but roughly 70% of all trade 
is going to happen with massive freighters which won\'t use small 
containers. Ores won\'t have packing materials.

Taking the density of water as the average density of *all* traded 
cargoes seems too low. Some real world estimates I\'ve seen are more 
between 2 and 3, not 1, but then again that\'s *planetary* trade. 
Containers full with liquid seem to be out of profitable interstellar 
trade in most cases, so that might push the density up.

Remember, I am talking *macro* here.

Yeah, if you establish an orbit *in* the van Allen belts. Not if iyou
are merely passing thru *quickly*.

It\'s like Chernobyl. You can actually walk thru the area with nothing
more than a dust filter and a lightweight plastic suit to keep from
getting contaminated material other you and your clothing. 

But if you want to *live* there, you\'ll need better shielding. 

Same principle.

Also, heavy shielding, but *less* that a couple of *meters* of
rock/metal/whatever will actually *cause* trouble when cosmic rays hit
it and generates showers of secondary particles.

Probably nanoseconds. But my point is that you could send three
different clocks via three different ships and they *wouldn\'t* be in
synch once they arrived.

Also, once you established the time it took for light to cross between
the two systems, and used that figure to correct time signals
transmitted between the system, none of the transported clocks would be
in synch with the place they started.

Given that there are *millions* of seconds in a year (about 31
million), a one part in a million difference in time rates between two
worlds (easy enough to do via gravity or velocity differences) would
result in a 31 second difference at the end of a year.

This is one of those things that makes timekeeping between different
worlds "interesting". For example, it only takes a mere 424 km/sec to
get that 1 in a million time difference. This is a *low* velocity for
Traveller ships. It\'s less than 20 times Earth\'s orbital velocity. But
not *that* out of line for the velocity difference between *stars*.

Try telling that to an astrogator. After boosting at one g for a couple
of hours, you are moving 72 km/sec. 72 km is an ok error in deep space.
It can be fatal near a planet.

It depends on how much time you spent in various different gravity
fields, and what sort of accelerations you ship used and for how long.

1 g of acceleration means that your velocity ids changing by 9.8 meters
per second every second. In most Traveller stuff, we simplify the 9.8
to 10. 

Here are the basic formulas:

V = A * T
D = .5 * A * T^2

V = velocity in meters per second (m/s)
A = acceleration in meters per second per second (m/s^2)
T = time in seconds
D = distance in meters

1 km/s = 1000 m/s
1 g = 10 m/s^2

1000 = 10 * T
100 = T

So it takes 100 seconds at 1 g to reach 1 km/s.

D = .5 * 10 * 100^2
D = 5 * 100^2
D = 5 * 10000
D = 50000

And while accelerating to 1 km/s at 1 g, you covered a distance of
50,000 km.

It includes one month at max accel.

Ok, that gets uglier, as the formulas I gave above quit giving the
right answers *long* before you reach 90% of c. 

	    t (unaccelerated) = c/a * sinh(a*t/c)
	    d = c**2/a * (cosh(a*t/c) - 1)
	    v = c * tanh(a*t/c)

sinh, cosh, and tanh are *hyperbolic* functions, not the regular trig
functions. 

> 4) What are the formula for calculating the difference in time dilation
> between 90%c and 98%c (approx. 293,797 km/sec)?

tau = sqrt(1-v^2/c^2)   Or tau = arcsin(cos(1-v^2/c^2))
gamma = 1/tau

so at 90% of c, tau = sqrt(1-.9^2) = sqrt(.19) = ~0.44
And therefore gamma = ~2.29

So the time rate of the observer at .9 c is 44% of that of the one "at
rest". Likewise, the moving observer is "contracted" 44% in the
direction of motion. And the "relativistic mass" would be 2.29 times
the rest mass.

For 98% of c, tau is ~0.20 and gamma is ~5.03.

Something that may help is this. If you graph v vs tau using units of c
for v, you get a circle of radius one centered on the origin.

You just flunked basic phsyics. It takes *no* fuel to maintain *any*
velocity. As an example *we* are moving at 90% of c with respect to
many distant galaxies. 

It takes fuel to *change* velocity. That\'s is change speed *or* change
direction. Both are covered by "acceleration".

I prefer to conserve linear momentum, and have the ship emerge with the
same *absolute* vector as it entered. 

Angular momentum is a *real* mess, which I don\'t want to get into.
Suffice it to say that a ship *does* have angular momentum relative to
the galaxy, the star it jumped from, and maybe even the planet nearby. 

If these are conserved, the ship *should* come oooout with a pretty
messy spin. I\'m just going to assume that J-space handles that
*somehow*.

That\'s not even a crime around here (UK) - it\'s a civil action.

Overall, I\'d agree with Bloo - very few Imperial Crimes but with
wide scope and lots of discretion to the nobles on how things work.

So, perhaps:

	No Slavery.

	No Piracy.

	No Weapons of Mass Destruction.

	Acknowledge the Imperial Calendar.

Let the Piracy clause cover theft, injury or damage to persons or property
under Imperial control and you get attacking Naval Bases, starports
ignoring interdiction and shooting the Emperor thrown in for free.

This would make an interesting strategic level PBEM.  A lone Solomani BB,

Solomani Rim War, before the sector knows of Strephon\'s assination.

I think what is meant is:

if your 3D coords are

x = 1.2341234...
y = 5.6756756...
z = 8.9089089...

then trans form to:

x\' = 1.2341234...
y\' = 5.86970586970...

(or as 1D: x = 1.58269370458....)

So to get a given number of significant figures in your position (say n),
you would need an n digit number for your x coord and a 2n digit number
for your y coord.

You could code it so that you had a 1.5n number of digits in each.

I\'ll agree that you cannot map a given 3D space onto a 2D space with a 1to1
relationship, given that both spaces are infinite, or about the same size if
finite. (Size being relative to the smaller dimensional (i.e. 2D space).

You can however map the 2D space 1 to 1 onto the 3D space, the simplest
manner of such being to fix the coordinate value of the extra dimension in
the 3D space. X2D=X3D, Y2D=Y3D, Z3d=5.

Therefore if jumpspace has more dimensions than our space you could map our
space onto it.  Of course in the case of fixed extra coordinates you are
really binding yourself into the original dimensions.

If the extra dimension was a time element than you could transit from
x1,y1,z1,now to x2,y2,z2,1week_from_now.  But then you would essentially be
traversing regular space with a different location at each point in time.

I suppose that if jumpspace had a either a different relativistic limit, or
the coordinates weren\'t 1 for 1 so that a difference in coordinates of 1M in
jump space might equal 1K difference in our space.  If a jump field where
discovered by accident you could through trial and error establish equations
to predict your trip destination given a set strength of jump field.  Not
being able to stay in jump space for more than 1 week (in normal controlled
conditions) and having the field itself insulate you from the
fabric/substance of jumpspace would preclude being able to gather much, if
any experimental data in order to build a jump space thruster to either
allow for altering your course mid jump, or speeding you on your trip.

	I don\'t see that it is necessary to map jumpspace to real
	space as you are suggesting cannot be done.  Rather, imagine
	that real space is a two-dimensional plane to those in it,
	but is the surface of a sphere to those that can perceive

	allows one to take a shorter route.

  The advantage of the on-going CD-ROM project (is that in the FAQ?) is
that it costs much less to get it "re-printed" (probably by close to an 
order of magnitude), and that it\'s of value to people who already have
many or all of the LBB\'s; i.e., would I buy a book compilation of all of
the Adventures & Double Adventures, and would my answer be yes instead
of no if it were an electronic format to simplify my records and the
creation of player handouts or PBEM ops? (No, and Yes, respectively).

  There\'s also a heck of a lot of other financial considerations against
hard-copy vs. CD release, but that\'s been gone over before.

	If you want the text of the CT books (somewhat updated) and can ignore
rules (or want new rules) these are being published by Steve Jackson
Games http://www.sjgames.com as a GURPS add on. I looked through
GT:FirstIn (the Scouts book) and decided not to buy it because
everything it covered (except the GURPS specific items) I already had in
either Book 6 (Scouts) or the MT Referee\'s Guide or TNE: Worldbuilds
guide. The Orignial GT book covers much of the CT books and has the
Library reference. 
	Not to start flame wars, but has anyone compared the background (not
rules!!) between GT and CT or MT or TNE or T4?

Well, the RN `through deck cruisers\' was to get around a UK Government
that was against carriers (or defence spending in general).

The Japanese effort is to get around their constitution that was, to an
extent, enforced on them after WWII.

Perhaps because the Iwo Jimas aren\'t CVLs - they are LPHs.

The figures are about right; there is a limit on loading which is somewhere
around 20 to 30 metric tonnes for standard freight containers. I recall
that 60 metric tonnes exceeded limits for shipping normally. It\'s a while
since I last looked at the standard.

There are actually five books, unless you\'re counting "Chanur\'s Venture",
"The Kif Strike Back" and "Chanur\'s Homecoming" as one book. The others are
"The Pride of Chanur" and "Chanur\'s Legacy".

Ahhhh yes! The two famous examples of the reverse ie Eng => Rus => Eng
(translated by a CIA Computer experiment in the 60\'s IIRC) are :

Out of sight, Out of Mind => Blind Idiot

The Spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak => The Vodka is good, but the
meat is rotten.

This is almost as good as IBM Voice type, that I was using recently to
transcribe some corporate video\'s into scripts for rewriting. It translated
"Human Beings" as "Ukrainian Barons", and "Utensils" as "Used Pencils".
Methinks we still have some progress to be made <g>.

CT Is the classic 3rd Imperium, GT is an alternate, "Strephon steps out
of the shower" CT without the Rebellion and Collapse introduced in MT
and TNE, (stipulated by SJG\'s contract with Marc, btw). T4 is way before
\'em all. So far the background\'s are all compatible, though, IMO.

  I\'d love to see Mr. MM put out a new/old Traveller. Gurps has done a great 
job of giving us consolidated volumes of source data but many of us like the 
old character creation, ship building, etc. Personally, I\'d like to see the 
classic character creation, a single "official/canon" method of ship 
building- classic mode for quick,simple ships with a compatable gearhead mode 
for those that like to tinker, and a millenia that has established empires, 
conflict, as well as vast areas ripe for exploration/exploitation. I think T4 
was on to something locking out whole sectors for GM development with the 
promise of no canon publication for those areas.
  We need to face it- to survive Traveller needs to consolidate all us 
Classic, Megas, TNE\'s, T4\'s, and GT\'s into one buying block. It\'s the only 
way FLGS will give it the shelf space to promote it and grow a new audience. 
I can speak with some knowledge on this- I own/operate a FLGS. I have GT 
front and center on display and talk it up as THE sci-fi game to play. 
Result- in six weeks I\'ve sold three books. And those were to one guy wanting 
them as source books for another game. If I wasn\'t an old geezer Traveller 
myself, the game would now be in some back corner gathering dust.
   So that\'s my suggestion- we all put away our favorite versions, 
consolidate and refine the best of all versions, and lobby Mark to hurry up 
and finish T5.

Yep - the Fed Admiral decides to risk it all on one battle. If he can kill
enough fighters, he can cripple the Klingons ability to stop him. If they
kill him the Feds lose the leverage to force a favourable ceasefire.

The Great Marianus (sp?) Turkey Shoot, I believe.

I guess there\'s a distinction between what collectors would like and what would
work for players. Personally I\'d like to see T5 published in LBB format so that
it can be built up gradually and at less risk to the publisher and lower entry
cost to the gamer. Also this would hopefully get away from there having to be a
T6, as opposed to Book 9 or Book 5, 2nd Edition.

The order and lines (Rule Books, Supplements, Adventures, etc) could be similar, and indeed the various CT
volumes might be updated for T5. I\'d also like to see the better third party
stuff (FASA, Gamelords, Paranoia, DGP given a miracle) integrated into the
process, if rights allowed. Alien Modules I\'d also like to see in a similar
format to CT, one alien per volume.

For the collector, bundles of black books could be sold in box sets with
additional goodies, as with CT.

To be honest, although I think some of the rules are better in MT and T4, there
was very little about the packaging of CT I disliked - maybe some of the
boardgames and in particular having to get Azhanti High Lightning to get better
close combat rules and Supplement 5 - nothing else*

With MT the packaging of the main game didn\'t really work: part of that was
trying to slice existing and new material into books the size of the referees
manual etc. Also once they had the books there was a reluctance to revise them
despite the number of bugs. The DGP stuff on the other hand worked like a
dream - but that was mostly new from the ground up - even when they combined
Grand Census/Grand Survey they cut very little.

* it\'s coming back to me now. Alien Realms. Atlas of the Imperium. Hmmm

The applicable equation is:

efficiency=W/Qhot= Qhot-Qcold/Qhot=1-(Qcold/Qhot)

for a heat engine carnot efficeincy=1-(Tcold/Thot)

With Qhot the source and Qcold the sink and W the work produced. This is a
maximum efficiency. Typically real world efficiencies are less than this,
usually no more than 38% or less. Maximum is around 60% or so, always
dependent on the difference between Thot and Tcold. The "game" is how much
you wiggle between those values: the efficiency and carnot efficiency.

Oh, that sounds familiar.  I have sometimes had to translate for a
Mandarin speaker and a Cantonese speaker for the same reason.  They
couldn\'t understand each other in English and their Chinese languages
are indeed two totally separate languages.  Two native Portuguese
speakers, however ... wow.

So you\'re starting with a criminal code for the Imperium.  That\'s
probably of interest to your PCs.  

I think, however, that you would be better served to take a broad look
at the interaction of law and society before trying to make a list of
all of the crimes.  What is the Imperial government\'s function in the
Imperium?  What is the function of Imperial law in an empire comprised
of member states with their own legal systems?  You should find some of
my earlier writing on this in the TML archives (which I don\'t have in
readable form! but I\'ll try to get it and post it to Steve Daniel\'s web
page) in probably 1995 and 1996.  

Bear in mind that the Imperium does not attempt to rule its member
worlds.  They have their own legal systems, which sometimes conflict
with those of other members.  The Imperium just rules the space between
systems and a few worlds that are under direct Imperial rule.  In
addition, some nobles rule entire worlds directly as fiefs.  

My view is that Imperial laws after Arbellatra\'s reign are as minimal as
they can be for a huge star-spanning empire.  The Imperium tries not to
get into the law enforcement business except for the things it
represents to its members that it will do:  deal with piracy, slavery,
and threats to the peace of the realm (espionage, insurrection,
treason).  

Another factor that you should consider in drafting this monumental work
is that the Imperium is 1100+ years old, and that that is laid over
10,000 years of Vilani legal history.  A lot of change and development
will have occurred in those time frames, so the legal system will be
extremely complex.

I\'m not sure what maritime law provides, but in the Imperium, Imperial
admiralty law governs the conduct of persons aboard ship in jump space
when the ship is jumping to an Imperial world.  (Imperial treaties with
certain neighbors may provide differently.)  The ship\'s captain may
arrest a suspect and preserve evidence, and even hold a trial if
necessary (although normally the ship will be in port in less than a
week, so a trial is presumptively not necessary).  The prisoner is
entitled to be tried at the next starport by the Imperial authorities,
but may be transferred to a place with an Imperial judicial court or an
Imperial noble\'s court.

Well, I\'d suggest that, with an uncertainty in arrival times of 1 day
in 7 (or 14%), you are probably not going to hit a planet in this
manner.

Well, ships can normally jump accurately enough to arrive on course for a
gas giant or world to skim fuel. I always played that the jump calculations
told you when you\'d precipitate so you could aim to arrive at a mainworld,
or jump a fleet together. The time just varies from jump to jump depending
on local circumsances.

Yes!  This is what I was looking for.  Your answers to my questions have

Duh.  Duh!  I\'m so stupid!  I was talking about the massive fuel
requirements involved, when I was thinking that since a ship at 98%c would
have a greater mass (~5x) than it does at rest, there would be a greater
requirement for energy (fuel) to accelerate it to that velocity.  I don\'t
know where I got from there to fuel requirements for a non-accelerating ship
(!?), which is how I worded it.  Sorry.

Thank you again for your time in answering my \'amateur night at the physics

I find the idea, that imperial laws should be as minimal as they could 
misleading. Even if that was the political aim of the Imperium, we should 
still expect a very complicated legal system comprising of:

1) Some kind of international/intercultural law in the form of treaties with 
other interstellar entities ( Zhodani, Solomani, Kkree, Hiver, Vargr States 
etc)

2) Constitutional law dealing with the internal build up of the Imperium ( 
Moot etc) and its relations to member entities. These relations to member 
entities could be quite complicated actually due to privileges granted, 
contractual agreement at the time of incorporation into the Imperium etc.

3) Penal Law which would have to be quite complicated, as it would have to 
deal with all crimes and misdemeanors perpetrated outside the legal spheres 
of member worlds, i. e. in jumpspace, in unsettled systems, on imperial 
ships, bases, reservations etc.
I should guess that most conceivable crimes could be perpetrates in these 
environments with a few exceptions like evading a purely local tax etc,
I should also think, that crimes against the Imperium and its forces are 
punishable in imperial courts.

4) Administrative and as part of that tax and customs&excise law, which would 
deal with those cases where citizens enter into direct contact with the 
imperium, be it as space travellers, imperial employees or homeownwers living 
next to some imperial base.

5) Commercial law dealing with trade between different jurisdictions.

So to create a codex of imperial law might be a bit much for a mere mortal.
What could be done might be ( as of main interest to players):

1) To collect some more important basics of constutional law

2) Deal with criminal law and procedure

( I should guess that imperial penal procedure might not include the right to 
trial by jury as that would be impractical . On spaceships and in the 
military there might even be trials without recourse to a trained judge)

3) Make trade a little more interesting by having the players deal with the 
revenue service or customs

In fact, I seem to remember reading somewhere in canon that interstellar
location is based on using these stars as markers.

Time synchronization could be relatively easily carried out with the
placement of radio transmitters about the Imperium.

All you would need is a tuned reciever to the Imperial WWV signal, 
_when_ you are would be a matter of catching what the \'current\' time is
on the radio channel and backcalculating, since you know where you are
in relation to Capital. Note, this would take until the 400\'s or so to
have propagated a signal throughout the Imperium...about the same time
the X-boat system was established, which would require rather rigorous
and repeatable time-stamping.

Note that GT uses vectored thrust so that craft can manouver and hover. This
increases thrusters mass, cost and volume by 50% (Vehicles P41 Para 3). So for
the fighter example you would need to increase the above figures.

As you point out standard thruster modules that were non-vectored would cost
almost the same for 50% more thrust (the power slice element would still
increase cost and mass by 50% though this is not a large part of the cost).

e.g. GTL10 Non-vectored Thruster module: 60 sTons thrust, MCr 0.18, Mass 3.6
sTons.

For craft not intended for planetary landings I guess you could just have one
vectored thrust module and the rest could be non-vectored.

For craft intended for planetary landings I would install CG for lift and again
have only one vectored thrust module and the rest non-vectored. Then you come
out way ahead.

Contragrav is so cheap you wouldn\'t even notice it on a starship at around
30.5KCr for 1000 sTons lift and negligible volume (28.2cf). 

Of course doing this to any commercial ships would break some elements of GT
(e.g. Far Trader). :(

This presupposes a concept equivalent to the maritime or international law
concept of freedom of navigation. In other words in international waters
nations on Earth are to allow unimpeded passage of vessels flying foreign
flags. This is of course only a general rule. A military or Coast Guard
vessel can always search a vessel registered in their own country or with
the permission of the country the ship is registered in. Hence the
proliferation of registries in countries not especially cooperative.

I don\'t believe that the Imperium has this policy. As a matter of fact I
think that it implicitly does not.

"The Imperium rules the space between worlds and leaves the dirt to the
worlds itself."

I take this to mean that in Imperial star systems the Imperium rules. Except
for diplomatic missions I see the Imperium as attempting to exercise
authority over all ships within their control zone.  This is a concept more
in line with the territorial jurisdiction practiced by nations on land
rather than at sea.

Would the Solmani or the Zhodani like this? Probably not. But I would expect
them to follow the same code. In an uncontested star system I expect that
the Imperium would claim jurisdiction from the inner edge of the Oort cloud
to the star itself.  Of course claiming jurisdiction and being able to
enforce it are two different things. I would expect that most enforcement
would be centered within the 100 diameter radius of the major world and
possibly any gas giants.  Other inhabited areas, provided they are not
Imperial stations are probably patrolled by either the reserve fleet or a
local organization.  This could be anything from the local noble\'s Huscarles
to a group of Star Rangers.

In any case I would expect them to have the authority to board any
spacecraft on legitimate excuse and be able to hold it to Imperial statues.
This said I would not expect to find many Zhodani vessels in Imperial space.
The Consulate would not want them boarded and the local populous wouldn\'t
want telepaths any where near them.  I wouldn\'t expect Imperial vessels to
have the same problem, as long as they don\'t have psi shielding. I also
wouldn\'t expect there to be a difficulty with this policy from other
interstellar governments, as long as they have the same rights to hold
Imperial vessels to the same standard.

I believe that Poul Andersen wrote this very story. I believe that it was
called Tau Zero. In relativity physics, the "tau factor" is the inverse
logarithm of the Lorenz-Fitzgerald contraction as an observer accelerates
towards the  speed of light; the tau factor starts at zero at rest, and
becomes infinity at light speed. (Definition courtesy of Rob Tou\'s Tau Zero
Page: http://www.tauzero.com/Rob_Tow/index.html )

In the story the crew uses a Bassard (sp?) ramjet to continuously accelerate
their ship. They end up accelerating so much that they allow the whole
universe to age to its end around them. Excellent story, and not an FTL
drive anywhere.

Luckily my FLGS seems to sell GURPS stuff at a good pace. I guess he get
relatively small numbers or something, because they seem to go fast. He\'s
got a fair number of used/out of print non-Traveller GURPS items also, as
well as the occasional TNE book.

Unfortunately this seems to be a AD&D summer as many of the games being
played on site this summer are in this system. Traveller isn\'t the usual
game there either, but up until May Alternity and Rifts seemed to be the
systems of choice, and a FUDGE cross-time, cross-dimensional hodge-podge.

Actually, Leonard, don\'t forget that the "*no* fuel" assumes *no* friction,
which, at velocities over 0.1C, won\'t actually be true ... Space is not a
true vacum. The decellerative effects will be based upon speed (relative to
medium), density of medium, mass, frontal area, and non-movement energy of
medium. At 0.1 C or greater, in addition to time dilation, you also have
significant radiation effects from particulate impacts upon the leading
surface, and these impacts are a decellerative effect. Trivial, but
present. At 0.5C+, they become severely erosive, rather than simply
decelerative and radiation inducing.

I wouldn\'t mind seing them re-laid-out for 8.5x11 hardcovers... I also
would hope he\'d do the GDW MT stuff in another hardcover... with the
erratta worked in. I have most of the CT materials, but run/play a variant
MT, due to better rules-self-consistency. CT/MT are fairly close. Hell, you
can use HG designs in MT... you just need to reformat the data....

I know that if MT were corrected, consolidated, and re-printed, it ouwld
sell at least 10 copies in anchorage. More if it didn\'t include the
rebellion. Even at the $40 the harcover could pull at Bosco\'s...

IMTU, the ship retains it\'s vector relative to the TWO most significant
gravity-producing objects near it when it jumps, and realigns them to fit
the two most significant at jump exit.

GT is subtly different from CT AND MT in many ways, especially in the
supplements. GT is built upon the assumption that the late 3I DIDN\'T break
up into the rebellion. That Strephon was an effective emperor. And upon
many of the personal preferences of the authors in interpreting the 3I
setting. IMHO. CT didn\'t present a coherent picture, but a framework to
hang "your own" 3I on.  MT  created a standard "3I" setting, but still left
room for hanging things off of. TNE was really a continuation of MT and
Hard Times, background-wise, in  a direction many don\'t agree with.

For example, take Imperial Warrants. In CT, there is an entry on them in
Supplement 8: Library Data A-M. In MT, not only is there the same entry,
but we find out that Norris got one that was either non-personalized yet,
or was "Bearer" issued.

GT first printing also made changes to TAS membership, passage costs, cargo
costs, nature of the Army, navy and marines (at least by the way the
templates were written).

Much of CT\'s background material was really by interpretation fo the tables
in the rules; likewise so did MT. TNE often contradictedd or failed to have
congruency with it\'s own tables. T4 was light on Background in the
rulebooks, just like CT, but unlike CT, didn\'t leave much room for
fidgeting with other backgrounds IMHO.... and often, T4 contradicted CT or
MT materials.

It\'s not that hard to make a converging (focussed) laser beam, even at long
ranges - the spot can never get smaller than the diffraction criterion
(wavelength*range/launch diameter), of course. You have to refocus for targets
at different ranges, but that\'s not too hard to design into the system (well,
designing something that refocuses from 1km to 100,000km is challenging, but
not impossible.)

The laser we\'re going to use in my Actual Job to make an artificial guide
star for astronomical adaptive optics is focused (rather than collimated) onto
the
sodium layer (100 km up.)

>I\'m sorry, I\'m just not following this ... could you rephrase this a
>bit? I\'m not making any sense out of it at all.

Georg Cantor was a 19th century german mathematician who proved that there
are just as many points in a line as there are in a 2-dimensional space as
there are in 3D space, and so on. Actually, he proved a bigger mathematical
statement of which this is a mere detail.

You can uniquely and reversibly associate every point in any N-dimensional
space with every point in an M-dimensional space, for any N, M > 0. It
seems impossible, but there is just as much room on an infinite line as
there is in an infinite N-dimensional space.

Your question was how to map points in 3D space to a 2D space. There are
any number of ways of doing this, but here\'s one easy to visualize:

Consider  a 1 unit square and a 1 unit cube. The unit can be whatever you
want, let\'s say the size of the universe. Every point in the 3D space will
be given by 3 real numbers, X, Y and Z, all less than one.  Every point in
the square will have a position uniquely given by 2 real numbers, X\' and
Y\', less than one. We want a way to uniquely and reversibly associate every
triad (X, Y, Z) with a pair (X\', Y\').

Every real number can be considered an infinite sum of polynomials. For
example, 1/9 = (1 * 10^-1) + (1 * 10^-2) + (1 * 10^-3) + .... This means
our number X can be represented as:

	X = (i1 * 10^-1) + (i2 * 10^-2) + (i3 * 10^-3) + ...

Where i1, i2, and so are integers uniquely specifying X. In fact, that\'s
how our normal decimal system works. Except we just use the digits and
leave out the "* 10^whatever", the position specifies the exponent. Let\'s
do that for the 3 numbers in our 3D space:

	X = i1 i2 i3 i4 ...
	Y = j1 j2 j3 j4 ...
	Z = k1 k2 k3 4k ...

The "i"s, "j"s, and "k"s are the appropriate digits of each coordinate in
the decimal expansion of the 3D position. So for the point (0.31423,
0.0456, 0.6959), i1 = 3, i2 = 1, j2 = 4, k3 = 5, and so on.

Let\'s look at the following set of pairs, X\' and Y\' with the following
decimal expansion, using the same "i"s, "j"s, and "k"s as before:

	X\' = i1 i2 i3 i4 ...
	Y\' = j1 k1 j2 k2 j3 k3 ...

Every digit specifying a point in the 3D space has a corresponding digit in
this new 2D space, with no gaps or overlap, and vice versa. For example,
the 3D point we gave before has the 2D mapping (0.31423, 0.06495569).

However, 2D and 3D space are not topologically equivalent. This means that
distances and directions are not preserved by the mapping. For example,
using the sample mapping above the point (0, 0.29) is closer to  (0, 0)
than (0, 0.44) in 2D space, but farther in 3D. A square (or whatever) in 2D
space could map to a disconnected cloud of points in 3D space.

So what has this got to do with Traveller? Back in the "space is 2D" thread
I proposed that the sector maps we all know and love are maps of jump
space, and jump space *really is* 2D. This would explain the problems with
3D coordinates, boundaries, mains, stellar densities, and all the other
complaints. Each point in jump space corresponds to a single point in
"real" 3D space and when you jump you jump to the corresponding point.

Leonard Erickson pointed out a flaw in this, however. There is plenty of
canon evidence that distances and directions in 3D space *really do*
correspond to those shown in the sector maps. I considered trying to come
up with a mapping that would preserve distances and directions somewhat,
but it proved difficult and would be totally contrived anyway. Normal space
maps in Mayday and Brilliant Lances are 2D also, so it\'s a lost cause.

Why does any of this matter? The geometric properties of 2D and 3D space
really are different, and the use of 2D maps for outer space is, IMHO, the
biggest departure from "hard science" in Traveller.

My descriptions might not match anyone elses, but from smallest to

Missile/Gun Boats - a very small jump or non-jump capable craft
designed to operate in squadrons against civilian craft and small
warships, and as screens and intellegence gathering assets for
Battle Groups and Fleets.

Patrol Boat - a Missle/Gun Boat assigned to patrol a system
providing customs, policeing, and intellegence gathering functions
(100 to 400 dtons)

Destroyer - a small jump capable warship designed to operate in
squadrons in support of fleet actions (1 to 3 kdtons)

Frigate - a small warship designed for long-term independent
actions involving explorations, diplomatic missions, and commerce
raiding (2 to 6 kdtons)

Escort - a small warship designed to provide support and protection
for non-warships travelling in convoy (2 to 6 kdtons)

Cruiser - a capital warship designed for both long-term independent
actions and as the major asset in frontier squadrons (6 to 20
kdtons)

BattleCruiser - a capital warship designed with cruiser armor and
speed, but battleship class weapon systems, intended for deep
penetration raids in hostile sectors (15 to 30 kdtons)

Battleship - a Ship of the Line designed to operate within a
squadron of similar ships in major fleet engagements (30 to 60
kdton)

Dreadnaught - a large Ship of the Line (60 to 100 kdtons)

Superdreadnaught - the largest Ships of the Line (over 100 kdtons)

...As for your example, if it is designed to operate independently
for long periods (wilderness refueling, extended life support), I\'d
call it a small Frigate, if it needs to travel with support ships
(limited life support, less provision for wilderness refueling,
and/or more reliance on its missiles than its beam weapons), I\'d
call it a Destroyer or Escort.

I don\'t have any doubt that the Imperial legal system will be incredibly
complex.  All of the issues that you mentioned are part of that
complexity.  Imperial lawmakers (of which the Emperor is the only one
with final authority), faced with the intrinsic complexity of an 11,000
world empire with over 10,000 years of history, would try to keep legal
matters as simple as they could.  That\'s still not be very simple.  

One way of keeping it simple is to allow local worlds to do what they
want.  That simplifies a lot of administrative headache.  Another is to
give the nobles a lot of latitude.  That also makes it easier for the
central government.  

I don\'t know how the Zhodani, Hivers, and K\'kree manage the uniformity
that we understand that they have.  The Vargr and Aslan lean the other
way, toward decentralization.

So the SDBs and colonial fleet are Imperial auxiliaries, which the
member state may use for adventures or for its own defense, until the
Imperium calls them up for a real war. I don\'t have a problem with
that.

New to the list, first post, been lurking for a day or two.

I\'d be most interested in a CD of the old materials for the reasons
Steve Hudson stated in #896.  I remember looking at ALL of those
LLBs, (or FASA\'s  LTBs, or Paranoid\'s LBsOADC (Little Books Of All
Different Colors)) in the Games Workshop store just outside of
London back in \'83.  While I have most of them, I kick myself now
for the stuff I didn\'t get then!

Anybody remember something called the "Splat Gun" ?

Living in a state where we\'re all forced onto what used to be known as
"Yukon Standard Time" or "Yukon Daylight Time", I can attest to the
advantages of solar time being an hour off of "official time"... The little
daylight there is in the winter is during the lunch hour, and just before.
Alaska used to have 4 time zones, now we\'re on a single one. Good for
buisiness (no more "5PM conference call" being  joined at any point from
3-7pm...), and it makes little difference at all during the summer. During
the winter, however, all the daylight is fading at the end of lunch. Go to
shool in the dark, get home in the dark... it\'s even harder when working an
office job... to work in darkness, work through the tiny period of light,
go home in the darkness. Fortunately, Anchorage gets a good 30 minutes of
twighlight during the winter....

As for my players, most are very aware of time differences, and failing to
use them, even in fantasy games, gets me into trouble. In traveller, I tend
to ignore them, since most of my PC groups don\'t cross enough terain to
bother with them. I use them much like Xen, as an occasional pain in the
arse.

I would like this, but I have to agree with another poster that
republishing the MT rules sans errors and "background free" would be an
even better idea!  I\'ve always thought the big stumbling point for the
whole Traveller franchise was the mis-handling of MT.  It would be nice to
do it right. 

As for the HIWG CD, that sounds like a great resource for any Traveller
version.  Any ideas when it will be available?  It seems I\'ve been hearing
about it for quite some time...

And at such time that the CD becomes available, I definitely want one.
But a republishing of the original CT materials in book form would also
be of interest to me. Someone suggested republishing them in hardcover
format, with several LBBs in one volume. I have a hardcover called "The
Traveller Book", published in 1982 -- that and the Solomani Rim LBB
are the only CT material I have.

Can anyone tell me which LBBs are included in The Traveller Book?

Two different animals, here... The History of the Imperium Working Group
(HIWG) published a lot of material during it\'s time and Bryan Borich made a
CD of their archives.  It came out last year.

The Traveller CD project is a different beast, still in the middle stages
and far from complete.  The project involves many people scanning, OCRing,
error-checking, checking, checking and checking again.  The intent is to
have a SEARCHABLE copy of all of the GDW Traveller material.  I know that
Bryan wanted to include the other published approved materials, but he has
not been able to get permission from several of them, most notably the DGP
owner.  Estimated publishing date?  Well, if he can keep getting the help he
needs for the process, maybe by the end of 2000?

No doubt to keep him from interfering with Hillary\'s attempt to shanghai the

Well, if this Bryan person wants the MT rules sent to him, AND if he gets
permission from Marc for me to do so, I\'d be happy to send him what I have.
Basically, I have Word versions of all of the MT rules, with errata fixes done.

However, I won\'t send him anything without permission from Marc.

Well, there\'s 1, 2, 3, half of Double Adventure 1, part of Supplements 1 and
2, a bit of Supplements 8 and 11, some of the Book 0 info... rather a

That\'s where the extra Mass/Volume/Cost comes from in the GT

I\'ve heard of it.  I even found a copy of the Spinward Marches at my used
computer softward store a couple of years ago for $3.

It\'s a pretty good program except that it is written to accompany TNE.  Since
I don\'t use those rules, it was of limited use to me.

I remember seeing (about a year and a half to two years ago) someone on the
list posting that all the sectors the company made are available as freeware
on the net.  I know you used to be able to get them from one of the AOL sites.

I have no idea if they are still available as freeware, but I know the company
no longer publishes or supports the product.

Tau is one for a system at rest relative to you, and zero at lightspeed.
Gamma is the inverse of tau, and thus ranges from 1 to infinity.

Tau is the ratio of "at rest" time to "moving" time. It\'s also the
observed contraction in length.

Gamma is the ratio between "moving time" and "at rest" time. It\'s also
the ratio between "rest mass" and "relativistic mass".

Alas, the relationship isn\'t accurate enough for timekeeping. The
periods might be of use for synchonizing *calendars*, but not clocks.

After a misjump that lands you in an "uncivilized" system or an empty
hex, the first thing you do is look for things like the Magellanic
Clouds. Those are a pair of satellite galaxies of our galaxy, and will
be visible from *anywhere* in the Imperium. They\'ll let you determine
galactic North, as well as spinward and coreward.

Armed with *that* info, you then attempt to spot stars that are "bright"
throughout the galaxy. Mostly Giants and supergiants. You\'ll have some
idea of which directions they should be in, so it\'s just a matter of
looking for bright stars in the "right" direction and then comparing
spectra. 

If you land in a "civilized" system, you merely use the radio to ask
where you are (assuming that the systems navigational beacons hadn\'t
already told you!). 

And for that matter, the Imperium (and other large multi-system powers)
can afford to have "beacons" on certain radio frequencies that could be
heard for *many* parsecs. These are mainly intended to help the IISS
with survey work by making it easier to determine the relative
positions of systems. But they also work for ships that have misjumped.

I have to recommend Downport!  Dealing with Sword Worlder was smooth

Just where is Galactic North?  It just dawns on me that I have read and used
this term for quite a while and don\'t know how to find it.  I was thinking
that it was (in normal astronomy) something akin to a point on the rim found
via a ray cast either from the galactic core through earth (or the
intersection of the galactic plane of a perpendicular line Passing through
earth) or a ray form this point trough the core.

I looked at the article @:
http://kids.infoplease.com/ce5/CE019926.html

And the article at:
http://cygnus.drao.nrc.ca/~schieven/news_mar94_english/gpsproj.html

And finally The Traveller Library entry @:
http://www.pcug.org.au/~davidjw/libdata/ALPHABET/D/directio.htm#Top

states that coreward in traveller refers to towards the Imperial Core or
capital.  It galactic North in traveller a point on the rim along a ray cast
either from the capital through the galactic core or from the galactic core
through the capital?

Or sure evidence that a black hole was released and is swallowing up anybody
that has seen it.  Any reports that that part of the world still exists is
the cover up.

I\'m not sure how you can decide which is the biggest departure.

I do know though, having attempted to rebuild a version of the TNE rules as
close to known science as possible, that failure to accept certain important
departures (jump drives especially and to a lesser extent artificial
gravity) does leave you with a pretty limited game scope.

Blimey, dumbass....don\'t you know *anything*? The black hole was then
scooped up on board the US Air Force\'s M1A1 Flying Saucer, cloned from the
one we bought from the Greys back in 1991 (you thought the Gulf War was over
*oil*?) which was then refuelled at Mir (which is actually a fully armed
secret battle station and the only thing holding back the BEMs) and shot out
to the L5 Lagrange point to join Elvis and all the 8-track tapes the US
Government unilaterally confiscated from its citizenry without anyone
noticing.

The wonderful thing about conspiracy theories is that whatever rational
explanation you can come up with, it\'s possible to come up with
progressively more outlandish theories to explain them away. And the fact
that there\'s no proof is the CLEAREST PROOF THAT IT\'S A COVER-UP.

Apologies to any conspiracy theorists here; I just find the concept amusing.

That is exactly what someone that was covering up the conspiracy would say.

GT: Starships. This was one of many topics that there just wasn\'t space to
address explicitly in the main GT book. There will also be a sidebar on
"wilderness refueling" in GT: Imperial Navy, if I ever get a chance to
write it.

Right now, it looks as if I\'m going to translate the rules from HG2 and
Supp 5 directly to GURPS. The fuel skimming and purifying rules in GURPS
(particularly VE2) are radically different.

I was working on a version of Diplomacy for use in the Islands Clusters.
The idea was to simulate the political maneuvering behind and between the

The map, of course, is the standard double-subsector layout.

Well, Leviathan (CT Adventure 4) was 1800 dtons, so if you stick with that
you should use a 2000 dton hull.

Hm.  I\'ll run Leviathan through GT Shipyard and post the design for you.

Actually, the passive/IR signature table isn\'t really designed to work
for things as small as cans of ravioli (I can\'t believe I just
wrote that.) The real signature should be based on its absorbed heat,
which is (0.035 m) * (1 kw/m2) = 35 W, about -3.5, with an additional
+0.5 because the can doesn\'t have intelligent radiator design, for -3.

It would have a passive/visible signature of -2.5. Mil sensor arrays
(maybe passive/14 and active 12 is what I gave my version of the
Midu) would see it automatically at about 1.5 million km in the
visible and 500,000 km by radar. Paint it military black and give it
a level of stealth and those ranges go down to 500,000 and 150,000 km.
Make it a small can of tomato paste (2cm base) and the signatures
go down by about 0.5, for 150,000 km visible and 50,000 km radar.

Lest anyone think these are unreasonable, the USAF Space Command 
currently tracks *every* object 10 cm in diameter or bigger in 
earth orbit, and there have been experiments that track objects down
to 1 cm, and several serious proposals for routine tracking of objects
down to this size with radar or visible light. And that\'s TL7-8,
with ground-based sensors.

ALso, as Dave notes, even if you don\'t see the projectile coming, since
it is going to take literally hours to reach you, (a) even small
evasive changes of course will guarantee a miss even against big clouds
of cans, and (b) the battle will be over before the cans get close to
their target...

More true. However, they also weight many tonnes and require megawatts
of power; we couldn\'t launch a railgun equipped weapons platform into
orbit, and even if we did, we couldn\'t power it.

Couldn\'t we mount a thousand square meters of 24% efficient solar panels
(~324W/m^2 times 1000 gets 324kW).  So what if it takes time to charge the
firing capacitors.  Of course with the recoil of the weapon, you might want to
either strengthen the solar array supports, or even keep the array on a
separate platform and beam power to the weapon.

  So assuming that the US is relatively rare in being that effective a
central gov\'t (Q: was the FRG behind the various terrorist groups there?),
whereas places like Colombia, Vietnam Cuba, and Peru _can_ develop local
insurgencies without foreign assistance (beyond perhaps the ideological
motivations), is the 3I likely to be effective enough to be pulling the
strings at the Empire-wide level?

  Personally, I would very much doubt it, but the doctrine that an effective
central government can prevent any opposition seems interesting.

These can be treated as \'families\'.

For example, in the 1950s, the two major factions within the NSW Police
force were the Catholics and the Freemasons.

In the modern Australian Labor Party in New South Wales, the Left faction
essentially consists of two subfactions ... the Metalworkers Union group
and the Miscellaneous Workers Union group - the Misco\'s are known as the
\'Fergusonites\', because of the influence of the Ferguson clan within it
(heck, the Metalo sub-faction coalesced due to a feeling that the Fergusons
were dominating NSW Left politics). The Breretons formed a similar clan on
the NSW Right.

I dont think I need to raise the examples of the Kennedy clan as a faction
within the US Democratic party, at least when Kennedy Sr was running the show.

In ESG terms, sub-factions could be represented by two allied (\'good\'
relationship) families, or (even better) two families who dont neccessarily
get along, but share an  enemy (it is a truism of politics that there is no
blue like a blue within a faction).

Hmm, once it\'s all done, you could rank the families by using some sort of
log function (I want 10 O6s to be equal in influence to one O7).

Thats doable. Needless to say, GMs should fix dice rolls as appropriate, to
make sure Oberlindes is on planets where Canon says it should be.

Maybe. But the pattern is there ...

I\'d say the lower you go, the more below the \'horizon\' of the Families,
Clans and Cliques you get.

Although the equivalent of Jimmy Carter\'s brother Bubba, who ran a gas
station in Georgia, is amusing ... some little D class port, with a bloke
running it who bears an *awful* lot fo resemblence to the Imperial High
Chamberlain ...

The reason I wrote this is so a GM can look up *fast* who is important on a
world, and wing it from there.

Once you have a look at the \'Family Summary Sheet\', obvious adventure hooks
will suggest themselves.

It will also let the *players* know how they rank vis a vis some Planetary
Navy patron ... if the PC group is led by an ex-Navy O6, then it is quite
possible he may have a \'courtesy rank\' equalling the local Squadron
Commandant.

Noble PCs should also get a look at the Family chart when they want, and
should get a list of who their major friends and enemies are ... everyone
else has to work at finding out who is related to, friends with or feuding
with whom ...

Working on it. I had a classified list of TNE and T4 skills for my own use.
When I read your post, I looked over my material and can add CT (from the
Starter Edition) and MT (From the Player\'s Manual). The skills are
organized differently in the different books and sometimes have different
names, but I think I can come up with a reasonable clustering for them.
Gimme a couple of days, and I should have something for you.

At least 50 kkm. 100 kkm would be easy to justify.

And the screen is the absolute bare minimum size that will do this, right ?

Meson Screens are surface-intensive ... think about upping the factor.

*grin* this is what happens when you follow a spreadsheet. See what size
Circular PAW you need to achieve a sufficient range (a million km sounds
about right), then see how much output you can get out of it ...

Good design ! Slow RoF under normal circumstances, but the ability to put

OK, but I\'d be using a couple of secondary PAW bays for that role. Or you
could reconfigure the PAW into a parallel mount (a 150m PAW is actually
only about 40% of the length of your *spit* wedge hull), and put in a
parallel meson gun ...

Journeyman is about right ;) Once you can build from the ground up, without

Seriously, it\'s a solid design.

This is a concept I have been considering for my WBD software. I will
contact you privately to discuss the matter further.

There are a few flaws in your rules, in my opinion, In particular little
consideration for TL. ie. the rules work for worlds that have attained space
travel or have an Imperial presence. What about low TL worlds. They are
unlikely to have Naval capabilities?

Any comments on Ian\'s proposed rules would help too.

Clif,

Bare with me for a second, because this is really NOT meant as
flamebait, I\'m trying to get a feel for what\'s going on in Traveller
these days. Did I read this correctly? This is your first set of
Traveller rules? Can I interpert this to mean that you came to this list
via GURPS Traveller, that your a GURPS player that is looking into the
Traveller rules? 

The reason I ask this is that we have had some debate over on another
list about the furture of Traveller and Marc\'s T5 rules now that GURPS
is out. If the above is tru it gives me hope, but also a bit of concern.

The concern is that other GURPS players will follow your lead, buying
the T4 product. Unfortunatley this is not (IMHO) the best example of the
rules. The rules themselves are ok (you\'ll get some reaction that there
are broken parts, one of the reasons Marc started to revise them to
begin with). Unfortunately Imperium Games dis a really P**s poor job
with the lay out and design that it\'s hard to get beyond that for some
of us "oldtimers"! These books MAY become collectors items someday,
stranger things have happened, bu the odds are that they\'ll never reach
the sought after status of CT or MT. My recommendation is ro read
through the rules, write to Marc at FarFuture@AOL.com and request the
draft versions of the T5 rules he\'s let out for play test and put the 2
together to play with until T5 hits the stands. Which gets back to my
concern, I really hope T5 hits the stands BEFORE too many GURPS players
grab T4 and are so turned off that they never do check out the new
version.

Vehicles:   Launch

Crew: Eng x3, Elecx3, Maneuver x2, Gunn x11, Small Craft x4, Command x6,

NOTES: 
1) The ship has an under-strength power plant (123mw short of full
requirement)  as a result, it can only accelerate at 2-G on any turn when it
fires its Particle Accelerator Bay.  If another ship acts as spotter, it could
fire PA, maneuver at 4-G but must shut off Missile Fire Directors and Sensors.
2) The 200 ton Minimal Hanger is meant for capture of disabled small
starships.  The space could instead be used as extra cargo hold (=360 tons).
3) The fuel tank allows 2 Jump-1\'s and 40 hours of thrust from the Heplar
drives, or 3 Jump-1s and 20 hours of acceleration.    

Background: This vessel was designed in a successor state to the Rule of Man
in the Fornast sector during Twilight, during a particularly vicious civil
war.   It was meant to be a commerce raider that could be easily built in the
sector\'s TL-10 shipyards from off-the shelf components by the navy and
privateers. The ships were massed produced and plans were widely circulated.
Because of its relative inexpense and its versatility, the  design proved to
be a mainstay to pirate fleets on emerging TL-10 planets all through the Long
Night.   As a result, this is a commonly found opponent of the Naval Forces of
the Third Imperium.

I didn\'t mean to say that the RULES were not up to CT standards. Most
(again IMHO) are, some are not, the QSDS system for example. But musch
of this was due to the publishing and editing practices, which,
unfortunately, were not tightly under Marc\'s control. The biggest
problems lie in the fact that T4 overall was somewhat chaotic. Elements
of the system didn\'t mesh very well. From what I saw discussed across
the net, a bit of the problem was IG\'s rush to put books on the shelve.
Another problem I think, was the lack of inhouse writing and knowledge
of the game industry on IG\'s part, thier interest pas product on the
shelf and sales, not quality or consistancy. THis is, probably why
Marc\'s taking so long to release T5. Of course theis is all speculation
on my part.


I personaly like much of the rules, in spirit if not always the exact
mechanics. They are much closer to the CT/MT rules that TNE. Of course
TNE used the same engine as 2300 so you might want to look fro a copy of
those rules

I thought it was Twilight: 2000\'s rules set. My copy of 2300 looks nothing
like TNE.

Foss\'s stuff didn\'t do much for me either. I don\'t care for the 50s sci-fi
feel of the artwork for the book.

That\'s a common complaint.

>Please, tell me what you think of this book.

I have some problems with the skill advancement system (PCs seemed to
advance to high power very quickly).

Basically though, the rules are more or less workable. There is errata
floating around. Last time I checked (pretty recently) the Imperium Games
website was still up (that\'s at http://www.imperiumgames.com in case you
need the address). The errata for the book might be there. If not, check out
http://www.missouri.edu/~ccjoe/traveller/ which contains Joe Heck\'s
excellent Traveller oriented archives, I\'m pretty sure you\'ll find the
corrections at one of those places.

        Yes, in fact some modern anti-ship missiles have an "anti-jam"
feature which if they loose the RADAR picture of the target, they instead go
after the largest transmitter down the target\'s last bearing.  As I said in
my prior post, when we were being jammed, our Electronic Warfare team could
tell us where the jamming attacks were coming from, what freqs were being
used, etc.  But the fire control RADARS for the missiles and cannon could
not sort through the interference to obtain a fire control lock.

        Yes.  The problem is that the CIW/PDW system has to take time to
attack *every* possible target.  Further, current anti-missile systems like
the US Phalanx gun engage the closest threat and keep firing at it until
they kill it.  In this situation, if the gun picks the wrong sensor blip, it
will empty its magazine at something that is not there, while the real
threat continues to close the ship.

        No problems.  EW/CEW is a very weird world;  I don\'t live in it full
time, so I hope I am being of use.

  In all seriousness, something similar to the Car Wars system would do; 
just start by building some standard frames and power plants and then 
plug stuff together later - it should work as long as you\'ve built a
template for every major type you want to deploy variants of.

        Ok.  I don\'t have FFS2, but for anyone else, its good to know.
"Costs double" as in the price of a base sensor.

        Hmmm...  I\'ll take your word for it.  I have issues with a TL 15
society unable to sling a sub 1 dton
 object for 16 minutes at 100G\'s.  Particularly if you don\'t have an organic
pilot.  But that\'s just me. =)

        Actually, the ship I was on was a Regular Force frigate, one of
three ships in the SAU being engaged.  However, yes, you are right.  The
point was to demonstrate to us how badly an all out EW offensive could shut
us down.

        Again, I\'ll take your word for it.  Still, build me a sensor, and
given enough R&D I\'ll show you how to spoof it.

        So, I\'ll scatter a bunch of TL 15 "star flares" all along my path
and spin the missles on the axis with radical angled surfaces (or some such
other tech babble that decreases LIDAR effectiveness and blinds your thermal
sensors).  I see your point, but mine is that I only have to hit you with
*one* of them, and you have to hit *all* of them.  It is the old missile
validity issue that you and I have agreed to disagree on.  =)

        Except that, really, nukes ought to white out your point defense
electronics with the EMP meaning that any stragglers that don\'t get hosed
get a free move while your scopes reset.  I think there is a
Traveller-spawned warfare game that has sensor white-outs caused by nukes...
not sure.

Very good question.  I gather someone was saying that secession
isn\'t possible from strong central governments, or something along
those lines, with others saying that Texans could do it.  As a Texan,
I must agree with the latter, the only missing ingredient being the will
of the people to do it.  But then, thats true of any state, at least through
peaceful means.  All that is required to be a state (in the international
sense) is to excercise _exclusive_ control over a piece of real estate.
To be \'legal\', another state needs to diplomatically recognize that excercise
of sovereignty.  What Texas has, that many US states do not, is a
greater capability to control its border.  It would be much more difficult
to do, if challenged, for less populous, and less densely populated
states.

But as far as a connection to Traveller?  Lets see . . .

- --Traveller is an RPG that licenses its trademark to Steve Jackson Games
for the Gurps:Traveller products.

- --Steve Jackson Games is in Austin, Texas.

- --The US Government, specifically the Secret Service, and Steve Jackson
Games have had \'misunderstandings\'.

Well, thats about as far as I can get.

But let me try to go somewhere useful:
A proposal for a Universal Country Profile

Unversial Country Profile (UCP) of
Texas B*7*744-9  Ag  200  Allegiance: USA
USA  B*7*845-9  (Ag In Ri)  300

Note: UCP needs a 2D Size scale and a new scale for Hydro.
I\'m giving Texas Ag because it does have substantial water resources,
including large acquifers and a seacoast.  Not sure how to rate
hydro for one part of a world, perhaps surface groundwater
plus some portion of sea coast.  For US law level, I\'m suggesting
an average level of 5, with 4 in states like Texas, Florida, etc., and
6 in places like Maryland, Massachusetts, etc.  The trade codes
for USA are suggested by scaling down requirement from UPP
and are only relevant to other country\'s on the same planet
or in the same system.

A UCP would be great for all those balkanized worlds out there.
And could work for multiple settlement systems, such as where
one system might have a main earth-type planet, a belting colony,
and a colony on other planets, etc., etc.  Scaling down Trade codes
would be helpful, and would be only relevant internally.  Although,
since some portions of a system might qualify for interstellar trade
classifications on their own, internal trade codes might be separated
by parentheses.

So, whats needed for a working UCP is
- - Size scale in 2D,
- - Hydro scale,
- - Internal Trade classications.

Atmosphere, Population, Government, Law and TL from UPP work
as is, although the extended Law profile from the Milieu 0 hardcover
might be of great benefit.  The Pocket Empires material also adapts
rather well to this scale, IMO.

No, we didn\'t.  Combat Arms troops get extensive and repeated lessons in
the laws of land warfare.  We have incidents like My Lai and Kent State
rubbed in our faces to show what happens when one stupid f#&k decides that
he\'s god.

I\'ve trained with the National Guard for riot control duty, and the one
thing they emphasize over everything else is restraint.

So it\'s true?  I just thought I was making random noises.  :)

Actually, the idea is growing on me - it\'s kind of cheesy, but cute.

The other alternative explanation for the MT/TNE timeline is that it is a
psychohistorical projection - what would happen if the Imperium
had a crisis?  There\'s a Vilani influence in there, particularly in the TNE
part:  Uncontrolled technological development leads to disaster.

Clif, I could give you chapter and verse answers to these questions, but
I\'m not going to, as it has bugger all to do with Traveller.

There are lots of politics lists out there - I\'m on about six - and you can
talk about this stuff to your hearts content there.  This list is about
Traveller.

And no, you can find your own lists - I\'m not telling you mine! :)

These two features will allow the quick creation of World Details for all

    There is another way to look at this. Traveller may be SAVED by it\'s
GURPS cousin. Here\'s why;
    Classic Traveller gave way to MegaTraveller in 1987...which didn\'t do so
well in the marketplace from everything I\'ve been told. TNE came along, then
T4, neither of which did that well for various reasons (although I\'ve been
told TNE did ok until GDW\'s untimely demise). Now, if I were a game
publisher, I would find it difficult to want to take a chance on a product
that has failed mutliple times (this is in some ways an unfair perception,
but it may be the way some people think). Then along comes GURPS
Traveller..and it sells, and sells well from what I hear out of Austin. This
could show to a potential publisher of T5 that there is still commercial
viability in the Traveller line, at least as far as the background is
concerned.
    My personal feeling is that if and when Traveller returns to the
marketplace, it\'s going to have to be in the hands of another small-press
company, a start-up. If I had the money, I\'d invest in such a company. Some
of you MIGHT have the money. Let\'s stay away from movie production companies
this time though, shall we? <g>

Well, lots and lots of people will share your opinion of Foss\' work,
that was one of the biggest gripes to immediately come out about the

By hiring writers that don\'t know anything about Traveller, and don\'t
care. By not paying your best writers. By not giving the writers time to
proofread your editorial and layout changes. By not showing Marc what you
publish until after it\'s in print.

THAT\'S how you can produce a \'new\' Traveller that\'s worse than any
previous edition.

The view that I\'ve taken as the behind-the-scenes Pluto\'s Secret is
that the US discovered an Ancient Site filled with partial artifacts,
etc.  No jump drive was discovered; that was truely designed by the
Solomani on their own.  The Terrans were probably inspired by the
remnants of some media storage found amidst the rubble.  Knowing that
it was possible, the US/UN spends twenty or so years exploring
gravitics research, etc, trying to make jump happen, and finally
does.

I am partial to the thought of an Ancient depository of knowledge
left by a kind hearted Ancient for the fledgling humaniti, mostly
cultural information, or possibly a family library left behind in
the flight to reach safety during a Final War strike on the outpost
on Pluto.  (Thus, explorers discovered great Ancient literary works,
someone\'s not-necessarily-good attempt at poetry, the kids\'
refrigerator art, whatever.)  The media has corrupted over the last
300,000 years, and the Solomani (and later the Imperials) are trying
very hard to advance their tech from hints gleaned from an Ancient
version of children education programs.  ("I love you; you love
me... Lieutenant, for the sake of Whoever\'s Out There, what kind of
translation is this!?!")

Thus, it is possible that Ancient Fairy Tales are pictured as
reality, and become a closely guarded state secret for over 3400
years after its discovery.

This way, the Solomani are not laden with too much of a
technological advantage (thus invalidating canon), while still having 
the inspiration to utilize the ingenuity that Yaskoydray saw in our 
species.

Ancient fairy tales may seem a bit out there, but the information
source should be a bit inoccuous for this explanation to work.  
Not everything found in an Ancient site should be the most 
militarily appropriate item.  Ancient sites were populated by people, 
and the Droyne have never been noted as racial workaholics.  
Entertainment, child rearing and other issues still exist for the 
general population, even in the middle of a Final War.  Also, it 
makes sense that this is the kind of thing people would leave behind 
in the event of a military strike, as they flee toward the nearest 
"bomb shelter" for protection.

Besides, I like the irony.  :)

Probably you could. In the real world, this is called "home on jam" - missiles
that will hit active/area jammers. In the Traveller world, this probably means
that passive sensors will be harder to jam than active - it\'s very hard, 
for example, to jam a starring/imaging optical/IR sensor; anything you do just
makes the pixel you\'re on look brighter. You can (maybe) blind the sensor
with a very bright source (like a laser), but that just makes you easier to see
for the backup sensor that\'s behind a piece of smoked glass...

The ECM rules in my sensor rules set go with this assumption - generally you
can only jam passive sensors of lower TL, and no matter what, passive jamming
won\'t hide you, just prevent a precise fire control lock.

Well, such a big array would be bulky and vulnerable (hard to point) - and
still pretty heavy; probably a couple of tons, including the hardware needed
to fold and unfold it. The solar arrays on the International Space Station 
are going to take several whole shuttle flights to deploy, and will only generate
tens of kilowatts.

    'body' => 'Fellow Sophonts,

In the TFCT (Terran First Contact Timeline), I proposed that Texas 
seceded from the US during the Crazy Years, a world-class depression 
covering most of the 2020\'s.

I see that it has sponsored a number of comments, which I greatly 
appreciate.  In answer to the improbability of the above scenario 
taking place, I wrote of Moses Adamson\'s relatively unique psionic 
special ability to lock the minds of those whom he touched toward 
certain paths.  Several other questions have arisen.  Here are the 
answers I propose:

First, this would not have happened without an outside force.  Those
of you who know the military, financial, and political might of
existing governments have argued extensively of a point that I\'ve
already conceded.  In this, you are right: in the RW, Texas would
most likely have been squashed like a grape, maybe with a fight,
maybe without.  Who knows?  No one does, but I appreciate the
feedback.

Moses Adamson used his ability on the US President, several key
members of Congress, various political supporters of other members of
Congress, and many others, in a planned manner to achieve his
albeit-unrealistic goal.  (As I\'ve said before, a handshake is all it
takes, and it\'s very Texan of Adamson to want to shake the hand of
those that are about to make decisions affecting him and his dream,
the Greater Republic of Texas.)  His plan worked for his lifetime. He
died, and no more psionic disciplines exist to keep the GRT a stable,
separate, and viable political entity.  Texas, as a nation, must now
survive on its own.  Handwave complete, now "reality" can enter back
into the picture.

The US and GRT are moving toward reunification, and the Speculative 
History after First Contact will bare this out.  They will be united 
again.

For those of you who feel so strongly against TX\'s secession, you 
have convinced me that there should be a quasi-militant group in the 
US which is striving for the subjugation of TX and its re-unification 
with US.  Any input on a name?

From Isaac Asimov\'s Foundation novels, we can see one author\'s 
version of the affects that a person like Adamson can have on a 
galactic level.  I didn\'t want that; he\'s just a Texan with a dream, 
and the dream begins to fade with his death.

Final Point:

We have a lot of international representation on this list.  In 
order to develop a more believable presentation of the political 
situation of Terra at the time of First Contact, I would like to ask 
you the following question:

What nations, in your opinion, would be placed together into the 
political multi-national trade blocs established by the UN?

I will make adjustments to the TFCT based on the responses I receive. 
 I\'d like to post a final version of the Timeline soon, but I\'d like 
to have as much input as I can get before I do, so that it more 
closely reflects the international flavor I\'m looking for, as opposed 
to my albeit-limited personal viewpoint and knowledge.

If you feel that there might be signifcant resistance to a
particular political/economic division, please feel free to mention
the presence of reactionary splinter groups opposing such in your
responses.  These add more flavor and opportunity for role-play and 
character development, as well as a source for bad guys/good 
guys/other guys.  (The Terran versions of the Ine Givar.)

Thank you for your time and support in this project.  I appreciate 
all input, and am looking forward to your replies.  WIthout the aid 
of the TML, this project would never have gotten as far as it has.

There\'s some errata for this; on a second iteration I decided that jammers
don\'t have the same scaling laws as sensors, so there\'s a whole table for 
jammer sizes in some FFS2 errata/addenda. I\'m still not 100% happy with it
(it makes jammers fairly small at the high end); it needs tweaking.

>        Again, I\'ll take your word for it.  Still, build me a sensor, and

I\'m not 100% sure about that. Jamming imaging sensors is kind of like
jamming an eyeball that\'s looking for stars. You can blind it, or create
false targets, but it\'s very hard to make it think a real target is in the
wrong place with active jamming techniques.

In the missile case, HEPlaR-type missiles really are hard to hide. They\'re
(if you do the math) putting out gigawatts of energy even for a small missile
(for HEPlaR to work it has to be fusing most of its reaction mass); short of a
nuke, it\'s hard to imagine any kind of flare that could look like one (though
not impossible.) Add to the fact that decoys won\'t be accelerating while missiles
can, and the sensors job isn\'t really that hard. The decoys end up having to be
full-fledged missiles themselves, practically...

At TL15, though, thruster-plate missiles become more practical, and
harder to hide.

If the Empress Wave is indeed propagating through the galaxy at the 
speed of light, and is due to impact the Spinward Marches in the 
early 1200\'s, then it is currently about 80 ly coreward.  That\'s 
about 24 to 26 parsecs, which would place the Wave somewhere about 
halfway through Subsectors E,F,G,H of Gvurrdon sector and all sectors 
spinward and rimward along that galactic "longitude."

Which means that it\'s already ripped through over half of the
Zhodani Consulate, including its capitol, IIRC.  (I don\'t have
resource materials here at work to check on Zhdant\'s location.  My
apologies.) 

Anything that would have affected half of the Consulate should have 
been mentioned in GT:AM1 (Z&V).  It wasn\'t, as far as I can recall.

Which means that one of three things must happen before the Empress 
Wave can enter into the official GT timeline:

1)  The Empress Wave must propagate at a speed greater than the speed 
of light.

2)  The Empress Wave will not strike the Spinward Marches until
much, much later in the timeline.  It takes more than 130 years for
light to cross a Sector along the core-rim orientation, and thus, if 
the EW is discovered by the Eighth Core Expedition, it will have to 
cut across the coreward reaches of Known Space before hitting the 
Imperium.

OR...

3) SJG would have to ignore the speed of light and do it anyway.  
Let\'s hope not, but TNE did it, so there is precedence in the OTU, 
unfortunately.

Thoughts?

You forgot

 4) SJG is legally allowed to use elements from the Rebellion/TNE
storyline. They are not, which is why, in essence, we have the whole
"Strephon walks out of the shower" alternate timeline thing.

The Empress Wave is not GT canon. Neither is Virus, the Rebellion, or
anything else after Dulinor assasinates Strephon in the GDW timeline.

Something may happen to disrupt the Zhodani in this timeline, but it\'s
not likely to be a all-disruptive as the Empress Wave was in TNE, as
that was really a plot device to collapse the Zhodani Consulate much as
the Rebellion, and Virus had collapsed the Imperium.

As outlined in AM1, there are several competing factions inside the
Consulate that may prevent them from proceeding to the Sixth Frontier
War; one will be the continued undercurrents of unrest in the Imperium.
While stopping short of outright Rebellion, I don\'t see the Imperium
getting too expansionist, which is what the FW\'s were all about.

What I do see is constant, low level friction and maneuvering along the
border, fitting right in with the currents of intrigue and submerged
conflict that sort of define the Spinward Marches in GT.

I see it becoming like the interface between the USSR and the US during
the 70\'s and 80\'s. Lots of \'incidents\', but kept quiet and stopping far
short of outright acts of war.

Actually, my fear is more that SJG will wind up publishing Traveller. 
That scares me because of the nature / flavor of many of their games

(sigh) That\'s good and bad.  I don\'t know what the answer is.  I guess
that makes me part of the problem.  I know what I don\'t want but don\'t
have a clue how to get what I do want!  What I want is Classic
Traveller, improved and updated.  I want smaller books that lie flat

Jason Kemp posted a message to the list concerning a timeline for Terra
between now and when the Terrans meet the Fist Imperium. Part of the
storyline had to do with the seccession of Texas from the United States of
America.

This sparked a number of posts about the \'reality\' of such a thing.
Thendal\'s "ask the founding fathers post" seems to be in support of the
scenario that Texas might be able to win a revolution.

That\'s how it relates to Traveller. Someone\'s trying to expand the
background, and other folks are commenting on it.

Not sure what you\'re getting at here. I like Car Wars, it\'s a fun game. I
like Traveller, which is also a fun game. GURPS products of all sorts and
flavors have been published ,everything from the hard science "Terradyne" to
the recent Discworld. Most of them don\'t get too much attention. Each one is
a sourcebook, not a product line.

Traveller is a product line not because Steve Jackson wants to get his
grubby hands on it and make it like Car Wars or Illuminati, it\'s a product
line because Steve Jackson really likes Traveller, specifically classic
Traveller. Personally, I have seen nothing but positive support for GT from
the Steve Jackson camp.

  Correct me if I\'m wrong, but isn\'t the HEPlaR drive\'s reaction mass
moving at relativistic velocities? I only know the rudiments of space
engineering, but I tried to do some rough calculations, and always ended
up with a velocity around 0.9c or so. If this is indeed the case, then
ralativistic beaming should become a factor. At these velocities a 
radiating mass should be beaming a major prcentage of its flux to the
direction of its motion, in this case away from the detecting ship. I
don\'t have any reference material with me and can\'t recall the formulas,
so I don\'t know how close to c you have to get for this to be a
significant influence, but it seems to me, that an object coming directly
at you under fusion drive might not be quite that simple to detect.

I think the GDW Solomani book set 001-0 to 19 Jan 4521 (which happens to
be a Sunday, according to "cal").  Leap days cause the Imperial calendar
to drift, so 001-4 is 18 Jan 4525, and so on.  If my quick math is right
001-1117 would be 4 Apr 5637.  The first Oneday (002-0) would then be a 
Monday, although the week cycle would get out of sync on 001-1, since on
the Imperial calendar Holiday has no weekday.

You know, "anno" might be a better choice; "ano" is a word in Spanish,
and it has nothing to do with "ao", the similar word for year....

Depends what you mean by \'relativistic\'; IIRC (haven\'t looked at the
computations recently) its between 5% and 10% of c, which is somewhat under 1%
dilation (if its over 12% of c, it\'s impossible even assuming all the reaction
mass is fused, since 100% hydrogen to helium fusion is only about 0.7%
conversion).  

Real issue is, even if 99.9% of the energy goes backwards, a HEPlaR thruster
still outputs upwards of 10 megawatts per newton of thrust.  The smallest
viable missiles probably have upwards of 100 kN of thrust, so that\'s a terawatt
of power.  A gigawatt of (unmasked) power going forwards is still plenty
visible....

Waves can travel faster than the speed of light.  An example of this
exists in some spiral galaxies where the "arms" are just areas where a
wave has activated the stars in that region while the dark space is where
the stars have "died".  The actual stars aren\'t moving (faster than
light) but the wave that activates new stars propagates faster than
light.

  OK, duly noted. As I said, I\'m not a space engineer. This, however
brings up another thought: TNE used HEPlaR in _everythig_ right up to grav
belts IIRC. The use of plasma drives iside an atmosphere always struck me
as somewhat dubious, and with these figures suicidial starts to have about
the right ring to it. Any thoughts? How have others dealt with this issue?

I don\'t believe the spiral density waves that make stars travel faster
than light. (In fact, I\'m extremely sure they don\'t.) 

There are other kinds of waves that can travel faster than light, but they
always turn out to involve some kind of subtle trick and never carry information;
basically they have to involve things that are repeating again and again and/or
things that have been set up well in advance. For example, if you had a 
bunch of people spaced out at 1 km intervals, each with a very accurate watchh.
Person 1 is told to raise his arms when the watch reads 12:00:00.000000
and lower them a millisecond later. Person 2 is to raise their arms at
12:00:00.000001, person 3 at 12:00:00.000002, etc. From a distance it appears
that the front of people-with-their-arms-raised is travelling at a million
kilometers per second, faster than light - but this is only possible because
conditions were set up in advance; no information is being sent faster
than light. Similarly the "Empress Wave" could only travel faster than 
light if it was prepare din advance and/or its only the latest in a series
of such waves...

re: the wave in G:T - in 1120 (the official G:T timeline) how far through the
Consulate is it? Will it have reached the capital yet? There was evidence in
the "official" rebellion timeline for internal fighting in the consulate...

Loren has dropped remarks indicating that Strephon was at the Longbow site
at the time of his assasination, so there is *something* interesting going on.

Actually, waves can\'t go faster than light, though things that resemble waves
can.  The limit is that something with non-zero information content (which
means non-zero energy) cannot travel faster than light.  Various simple
meta-objects can travel FTL fairly easily, at least for short distances (for
example, if you use a laser to create a spot of light on the moon, you can make
that spot of light move faster than light fairly easily).  Presumably what
you\'re referring to is a phenomenon like that.

Of course, none of this applies in traveller anyway.  A fast (high manuever)
ship with reasonable jump capability can easily pull off time travel in
Traveller.

HEPlaR was always a magic handwave.  If you interpret it remotely realistically
using HEPlaR in atmosphere is a quick method of suicide, as your exhaust
slamming into the atmosphere outside will create the equivalent of a low-yield
nuclear weapon (a HEPlaR thruster capable of lifting a person produces energy
equal to 2-3 tons of high explosive per second).

  My immediate impression of GT was, that it was closer to the CT look and
feel, than any other version since CT. (Including T4, but that\'s just
IMO.) Of course this might just be because I have never actually _played_
CT, just read through a lot of the material as reference.
  
  Be that as it may, I at least like GT a lot, and am going to buy
everything that comes out for it. (At least as long as the quality remains
at current level.) I\'m not saying GT doesn\'t have its glitches, there are
some things that really annoy me (mostly small ones). The overall feel,
however, is that this is the most solid and professional work done for
Traveller in a (far too) long time.

Car Wars and Illuminati are board/card games. It\'s tough to compare a RPG to
a board game; very different style. A much more apt evaluation is to look at
the quality of their RPG products, which are GURPS and IN NOMINE, and in
both cases (considerations of quality only) the seem to do ok. I certainly
like GURPS Traveller; it captures the \'feel\' of the Classic Traveller
setting in the way technology works and such very well.

Interesting..how exactly do you "improve and update" Classic Traveller and
still be able to call it Classic Traveller? Sounds to me like what you\'re
asking for is Traveller 5 :)

I know people are going to hate me for this, but just trying to bring back
Classic Traveller ala 1977 is simply not going to work. Other than those
systems that have been in continual publication since those days, games that
old will be seen as too archaic and limited for today\'s audience. and I do
not want to go back to the days of characters with two terms with 4 skills
and who die while being rolled up. A game that captures the SPIRIT of
Classic Traveller while giving me useful systems, good characters and good
combat rules is what I want...and that sounds like GURPS Traveller to me,
and it sounds like what I HOPE Traveller 5 will be.

  The CIA was behind Uncle Ho, Fidel, _and_ Sendero Luminoso? Wow, I must
really be behind on my reading.

  OTOH, the 3I had IRIS, and they couldn\'t even convince anyone else that
they existed - talk about covert!

  FWIW, yes, I would entertain the possibility that those movements were
essentially endogenous and lacking physical support from outside, although
I\'d never seriously considered their being backed by the CIA as an option.
Kind of like an Nth Communist International?

None.  I doubt that the UN could "establish" political multi-national trade
blocs.  "Recognise" would be a better term.

At the moment the UN is essentially incapable of doing anything much
without the support of the US and/or the major European powers.  Thirty
years is not really enough time for that to change.  (For comparison check
out 1969 and today, although comparing 1939 to 1969 might be more
instructive.)

However, bloc emergence could happen from below.  The question is:  how do
they emerge as real, independent powers?  OK, leave Europe aside for the
moment.  Consider Latin America.

Could Latin America form a real trade bloc that excluded the USA?  Perhaps.
 Would it be easy?  No.  How could it happen?  Well, it would involve a
certain amount of violence....

IMTU, I\'ve assumed certain political upheavals in Australia and Indonesia
that have given rise to closely politically aligned governments that have
hooked the two economies together.  This has been in the face of opposition
from other countries that didn\'t appreciate the nationalisations that
occurred...

I don\'t want to impose my model on anyone else.  I\'m just indulging my
prejudices, and lobbying to have them accommodated to a certain degree, but
I don\'t feel the need to make them canon, or even "canon".

This will give a better result, no matter the breadth of your viewpoint and
knowledge.  Actually, we still have a problem in that pretty much everyone
seems to be from developed countries with European-derived cultures.  Some
of the other lists I\'m on have people from Third World countries, and their
perspectives are quite interesting, but alas they don\'t play Traveller...

At least we have reasonable political breadth.  (Far-left to far-right!)

There are plenty of these in any potential bloc.

In Australia, there is still a fair current of anti-Asian sentiment that
would be opposed to a "looking North" strategy.  They would prefer
Australia to be allied to the US.  There are also alternative ways a
Northwards strategy could be carried out.  It could be driven either by the
left or the right, and the results would be quite different, and would be
opposed by the "out" group.  It would be a situation of "not their bloc,
but ours".  An example would be the different RW responses to recent events
in Indonesia.  Some Australian groups supported ex-President Suharto to the
bitter end, while others publicly called for his overthrow.  The same
division is occurring with respect to the current President, Habibie.

Any bloc will have internal and external opponents.  To some extent, which
are active depends on who the individual referee has running the place.

You should be seeing more of that front ramp in the near future :)

With the color, part of it is a function of the size of the texture map.  I
used alot smaller map than the ones I did / am still working on for the Free
Trader, simply for speeds sake.  I also kinda\' wanted to keep away from
using alot of black lettering so that it wouldn\'t interfere with burn
streaks.  A fair amount of it disappears anyway when you convert it to
grayscale, which is what the G:T books will be in.  Later down the road I
may do some more work with it.  In the meantime I\'ve got a starport or two
to build!!!  :)

They are a bog-standard starship laser, except rather than a big bank of
accumulators linked to a battery or power plant, you use a big chemical
cartridge. Cartriges are 1 kilo per megajoule of input at TL11-12, 0.5 kilo
per megajoule of input at TL13-15.

Thus, a thousand kilos of cartridge at TL11 should give you enough juice
for a 200 MJ output grav focused laser ... the problem is that small lasers
are short ranged until X-ray lasers come along at TL13. You also need a
beam-pointer for what is in effect a one-shot weapon.

It isnt that effective, but it\'s better than pissing off the IN by using
nukes.

The page reference is p51 of FFS2. Technically, you shold also include an
autoloader and an evacuator, but I figure it\'s a one-shot weapons, so you
can leave them out. Just dont expect to recover any bits afterwards.

  That\'s correct, TNE and T200 2nd ed. use esentially identical rules. (As
did every other GDW game published at that time IIRC.)
  The Traveller rules that do have some similarity to 2300AD are the ones
in MT. The task systems are very similar, except thet 2300AD used 1d10
instead of 2d. I\'m not sure if there are other similarities, but at least
I can\'t think of any right now.

The same thing circumstances existed in TNE.  It should\'ve been well through
the Consulate w/ no effect in CT or MT sources.  In Real Life (tm), it\'s
because it hadn\'t been thought/written up yet.  DGP had ideas about
"Sparklers" and "Baddies from the Core" so there was concrete evidence
something was going to be happening, but not through most of the history of
the Consulate.   TNE used the evidence of this to support the EW.  The same
thing applies to the Vargr Extents.

There *have* been various surges of unrest and violence in the Vargr Extents
(at least according to Vilani & Vargr).  We don\'t have as solid a history on
the Zhos as DGP did for Vargr, as they never got their Wizards & Lizards
published.  I don\'t suppose there is a complete manuscript floating around? :
)    There are periods in the general Zho history that could be the result of
interaction w/ the EW.  Most specifically, for MTU at least, the Core
Expeditions coincided with crescendos in the effects of the various EW
phenomena.  In any case, they\'re intimately related to the Core Expeditions,
even if only through being the route cause.

Still, the Empress Wave is too often conceived of as a monolithic
event/phenomenon, when instead it\'s more likely to be a number of possibly
related phenomena, all of which could interact differently with different
individuals..  The wavefront itself seemingly has no appreciable affect.  It\'s
whatever phenomena follow the wave that seem to rip the Consulate apart (quite
suddenly) in 1201 by somehow inducing Zhodani on Zhodani violence.

Alien Races I left alot room IMO for the EW, from TNE, to still exist.
Whether it will as was intended in TNE, I don\'t know, but I doubt it.

It moves *at* the speed of light, according to the Regency sourcebook and
emanates from the galactic core.

For it to actually be the "real" Empress Wave would require: 

   4) Someone who knew what the EW was and what it would do.  It\'s author
isn\'t (yet?) associated w/ G:T.

   The local insurgencies in Viet-Nam started without foreign assistance, but

Ok, first an apology.  I was one of the most recent "what does this have to do
> w/ Traveller" posters, and I did it while opening up cans of worms in
other messages.  This was probably just a tad hypocritical.

Yes, sorting out what happens to the US is important.  The idea of it
having a bit of a crisis is, IMO good.  This frees up the rest of the world
to form whatever blocs they (we) want.  Otherwise, its genuine economic and
military power would act as an obstacle to bending the world into the shape
material such as "Prometheus Rising" suggests it in.

Incidentally, I just had a look at the old CT Solomani module - it doesn\'t
refer to super-national blocs, just nations.

Maybe the expedition to meet the Vilani was partly a face-saving prestige
project, to show that while the US was down, it wasn\'t out.

In any case, holding the US together, and putting it back together again,
is a heroic enough project to keep any number of PCs busy.  Of course,
whether or not it\'s Traveller, rather than some other game, is another
question.

<Sigh>  Writing a future history that would annoy the least number of
people was never going to be easy - that\'s why I\'m glad someone else is
doing it, and trying to do it right.

Well done, Jason!

I\'ve been GMing PBEM Traveller for four years now, and playing in
PBEM\'s for six.  I\'m afraid I have to report that there *are* no
rules.  ;-> I can try to give you a few guidelines, though...all
IMO.

Go to www.pbem.com and read the articles there on PBEMing.  The
advice given there (last time I looked) was good, but a good bit
more structured than I run my games. 

Go rules light.  The players shouldn\'t be bothered with rules at
all.  Give the players the background, the situations, and they play
their characters, the GM worries about everything else.  In my
games, the GM does all the die rolling, and there isn\'t as much of
that as in a FTF game.  The important thing is to keep the game
flowing and the players involved, not adhering strictly to any rules
or rolls.  Roleplaying over rollplaying is how *I* do it.  Ok, it
helps that I\'m a heretic...or this might be why I *am* a heretic...I
don\'t know.  ;)

Be prepared for failure.  Sometimes, games just die.  Players drop
out, and you can\'t find folks that fit in with the group.  There are
scenarios that worked great FTF, that just don\'t fly when you PBEM
them.  The GM, and/or players, burn out, get busy, lose interest, go
on vacation, or drop out.  All this happens with FTF games, of
course, but with PBEM\'s you\'ve invested much more time and effort
and failures feel much worse..at least they do to me.

I\'ve found that the sort of players that thrive in a PBEM aren\'t
always those that are good FTF players.  Lots of people are shy and
under-aggressive FTF, but blossom in the PBEM environment.  The same
can be said for people that like (or need) to think things out
before they say/do something...in FTF games they are always being
drowned out by the snap judgment, fast talkers, but in PBEM\'s
things move slower and the thoughtful can get their thoughts
together, written, and out to the GM in a timely fashion.  

It is also important for both the GM and the players to be a
passable writers.  If the player can\'t write coherent paragraph the
GM, and the other players, will devalue their input.  If the GM
can\'t make the game "come alive" in writing the players will lose
interest and the game will die.

Be prepared for *slow* going.  In my "Akus Moby" game we\'ve spent
over 2 real-time years covering 6 weeks of game-time.  This is
because we\'ve been constantly interacting and roleplaying the entire
6 weeks.  In the "New Worlds" game (currently on hiatus, hell.."It\'s
dead, Jim!"  ;-) we covered about 18 months of game-time in just
over a year of real-time, because the game was a series of episodes
with long periods in between that we didn\'t play out.  What you have
to do is find a speed that fits your group and your style of game.
With Akus, if *everybody* isn\'t posting once or twice a day the game
is going too slowly and I worry about the game petering out.  OTOH,
I\'m also in games where the rate is more like once a week..or a
month.  It just depends on the game, the GM and the players.

One thing to be careful about is situations where some players post
every other day and others post a dozen times a day...that happens!
It\'s really easy to let the rapid posters dominate the game and
drown out the slower posters.  You usually can\'t speed the slow
poster up, they generally have good RW reasons for it, so you have
to either slow the fast people down to a "party" average, or be
prepared to give them side plots that keep them busy, but don\'t let
them get ahead of the "party plot"...or both.  I currently have *6*
separate plots going in the Akus Moby game...not including the main
plot that the "party" is pursuing...and this is for a game with 8
players.

There\'s more work required in GMing a PBEM than a FTF game.  You
have to really craft your posts to the players to make the world and
situations seem real.  You have to put your exhibits (deckplans,
maps, pictures, etc) in electronic form and get it to them.  You
have to maintain your (and their interest) when one or two days, or
more, drag between moves.  You have to keep things organized and
juggle a dozen balls in the air without dropping any *and* be
willing to pick up and juggle any balls your players might drop too.

OTOH, if you are lucky, you get to play with *excellent* roleplayers
you\'d never have a chance to get together on one room.  And you\'ll
make some good friends, too.

I can\'t comment too much, because as far as I know there weren\'t that many
copies of the other magazines that came out this way (Philadelphia). I\'ve
picked up a couple of JTAS issues from local bookstores, but I\'ve never seen
_any_ of the DGP magazines anywhere.

However, from reading your list I\'ve got to say that I like the JTAS method
of handling things the best. In fact, I still use them extensively now,
almost like additional books for Traveller.

I\'m not sure whether I\'d enjoy the other types of magazine as much, or use
them as often.

I have heard this theory before and don\'t buy it. If there was an Ancient
base on Pluto during the IW timeframe, how is it that the Ancients could be
such a mystery for thousands of years? At the rate Ancient bases appear in
some campaigns, I\'m amazed the Vilani didn\'t have everything figured out
while Earth was in the iron age.

Moreover, I\'m tired of every mystery and anomaly being explained away by
the Ancients. I think there was a letter in the MegaTraveller Journal
saying the same thing. There are thousands of parsecs of space over
hundreds of thousands of years in the Imperium, hasn\'t anything but the
Ancients happened in all that?

To add something constructive to the discussion, here is the reason Pluto
is red-zoned IMTU:

Even before interstellar contact Terran astronomers were puzzled by Pluto.
Its mass, albedo, and orbital characteristics didn\'t match accepted
theories. Early space probes showed a totally smooth, featureless sphere
and spectral analysis of the entire planet was that of a black body. Sensor
readings showed a homogenious interior. Probes landing on Pluto\'s surface
disappeared completely, like into an ocean, leaving ripples on the surface
but no trace of the probe beneath.

The planet was declared restricted and landings prohibited, but the
Interstellar Wars halted further examination. During the Rule of Man many
theories about Pluto were proposed, including that it was an Ancient
artifact, a vast ball of molecular acid, or some kind of wormhole. AAB
records showed that the Vilani, too, had encountered similar planets but
considered them an uninteresting kind of space hazard. Experiments
conducted from an orbiting research platform demonstrated that Pluto
conserved the mass, momentum, and charge of items hitting it. High-speed
impacts at shallow angles would spray particles of ices, oxides, and
hydrides, which had properties quite different from the planet as a whole.

Research was abandoned during the Long Night, but with the rise of
interstellar exploration Pluto\'s secret was investigated again. Nuclear
scanning and advanced computer modelling showed the planet was a kind of
atomic slurry composed of many atoms all at a state of maximum entrophy; it
was a completely new form of matter.

Since material scattered from the surface did not have the same effect as
the planet as a whole it the assumption was that Pluto contained some kind
of super-catalyst, something which triggered rapid chemical reactions in
anything it came into contact with. Experiments with reactive and inert
materials bore this theory out. It was hypothesised that at some time in
the past a particle of this super-catalyst hit Pluto and gradually
converted the entire planet.

The Solomani Confederation built an enormous industrial station in Pluto\'s
orbit during the early 100s to use the planet for chemical synthesis. The
station was plagued with accidents and eventually closed down in the late
400s when damper-mediated chemical synthesis proved cheaper and safer. The
owners dismantled the station and the Confederation red-zoned Pluto to
prevent any future accidents. It remains an interesting space phenomenon
into the 1100s.

I realize this is hardly canonical, but I wanted an astrographic, rather
than social, reason to red-zone Pluto, and this seemed more interesting and
less damaging to the established history than an antimatter planet or
something.

Comments by anyone with more knowledge in physics or chemistry are welcomed.

When my Army buddies and I played 2300 AD, we compiled skills list from
numerous gaming systems and made a master list.  Does anyone know of such a
list in creation, now?

I\'m afraid I\'m going to have to make some additions to this skills list in
T4 and also add some Bondian attributes to the list, like Perception and
Comeliness.  I can\'t understand why Perception and even Hearing aren\'t seen
as essential attribute stats.

For one thing, if the character is a 12 comeliness female, she\'s GONNA get
through Med School
 one way or the other, if she has any ambition and is a little lacking in
scruples.  After Med School, she\'ll find it easier to get a job, get
promotions, raises, notice, etc.

That\'s just the way things work with humans, at least outside Zhodani
territory.

Ducted fans (which "Vampire Fleets" makes legal for thrusters for robots)

I would probably allow the focal array to be half the normal mass/volume and

Possibly allow the combustion cartriges to be one-half normal volume and mass
also since they don\'t have to contain coolant and evacuator/cleaning gasses (which are 
a significant fraction of the needed supplies for a real-world chemical laser.)
That certainly makes combustion laser warheads practical at TL13 (non-grav x-ray
lasers.) Generous refs might allow x-ray combustion lasers at TL12 at some 
penalty. (In the real world, tech seems to have gone this way - we\'ll have TL8 
chemical laser weapons fielded before we have direct-energy weapons.) 

Another choice for civilian weapons is the "BB" type fragmentaiton 
weapon - that detonates at a thousand km into a cloud of ~10 gram 
penetrators with a few tens of MJ of energy each. Detonating that far out
you only have a 50/50 chance of catching an evading military target with even
one
BB, but a 2G target should catch 1d6 of them. The missile is extremely
easy to shoot dwon, even at 1000km, but again vs civilian-quality fire
control has a chance of penetrating.

(Both types - chemical laser and fragmentation - appear in my work-in-progress
Military Combat System as good civilian choices.)

You\'re assuming a 20th century worldview here.

1.) That 12 comeliness female may be from a world where _all_ healers are
female. As a result, her scruples and charms will not work. Or, in a culture
that is simply female dominated, perhaps the roles might simply be reversed.

2.) The background of Traveller can be assumed to be relatively enlightened,
even a 50/50 mix of men and women teaching at a med school makes the plan
you outline much more difficult.

3.) Comeliness is vastly overrated in an interstellar culture anyway. Keep
in mind that current standards of beauty and attractiveness (in the U.S. and
Europe at least) are relatively recent. These standards vary from continent
to continent, and further country to country. What may be attractive to some
may be disgustingly freakish to others.

And that\'s only on one small planet! Multiply that by a couple thousand
human inhabited worlds, toss in a couple of utterly alien human cultures
(the Vilani being the most notable), and the standards of beauty they might
maintain...

and voila! Your scenario is less and less likely to happen.

Again, beauty is in the eye of the beholder.

Great work Jesse. To be honest, if I was making a 3D model of a ship I
would work off the deck plans and not drawings. So you noticed that the
deck plans and drawings don\'t even come close to matching each other as
well? Get used to it, in my experience most artists know nothing about

A) Physics
B) Engineering
C) Traveller

You could shrink the two front \'snouts\' slightly to make it match the deck
plans a bit more without doing severe injustice to published drawings. At
least your turrets are domes and not WWII-era naval guns.

I suggest making the front loading ramp longer; that\'s a pretty steep incline.

The wooden crates seem a little anachronistic.

If you really think this is one of the ugliest ships in Traveller, you
haven\'t seen a Donosev-class survey ship yet.

He was referring to the Japanese.  The Viet Minh were not doing so well till
the OSS stepped in and armed them.

Of course the US also pressured France to stay out of IndoChina after the
war, but they didn\'t and the friendly Viet Minh turned on the French. I bet
the same weapons and supplies the OSS supplied worked real well against the
French too.

Kinda along the lines of "Hey, why doesn\'t our client state want us to come
back and take over again?"

Bows and arrows?  Gee, I guess the Royal Army of His Britannic Majesty,
King George, had fallen on hard times.

Read a history of the French resitance.  The most effective weapon they
used was a single-shot .45 calibre pistol.  You had to disassemble the
thing to reload it, and the effective range was about 2 meters.  The idea
was you shot a well-armed German and took *his* gun.

For that matter, we had all of the things you mention in Vietnam, where we
fought mostly against foot mobile irregular infantry armed with SKS rifles.
 All the tech didn\'t help.

Why waste a SEAL?  That\'s horrible force management.  We had complete and
absolute air superiorty in the Gulf War.  Saddam is still thumbing his nose
at us.  Satellites have really helped locate those two men in the Nevada
desert wanted for killing a cop, or the suspected bomber hiding in the
Carolina woods.

Consider also that the Virushii (from an old JTAS) are considered to be
excellent doctors and surgeons.  Virushii look like armored hippos with six
limbs.  

Speaking as one of the chronically ill, trust me:  med students don\'t get
by on looks.  I\'ve laid in bed while a thrid-year got grilled by the senior
resident on my case.  You have to be sharp to be a doctor, even at TL8!

The one time I ran a Solomani campaign, my explanation was that they had
found a burial site on Pluto that contained thirty human bodies.  Age:
300,000 years.  It wasn\'t an actual Ancient site, with all the neat TL35

Oh yeah.

This is all assuming standard Traveller. In GURPS Compendium I, there\'s a

I don\'t doubt it. This is a good point. I have yet to meet a doctor who made
it by on looks alone. I was just addressing the scenario that Cliff

  Heck, for the other end of the spectrum look at East Germany - the state
apparatus folded like a house of cards before the continuous pressure of
their own citizenry; amusingly, the leadership bowed to the inevitable even
though the various security bodies could probably have maintained a brief
emergency regime/civil war.

Walker Jane Productions is looking for popular-radio style music to use
in its feature film "October".  If you are in a band, or you know
someone in a band that is looking for exposure, have them contact me.

I have received CDs of bands from all over the US, and I am looking for
those special few songs that perfectly compliment the story.  Although
this is by no means written in stone, we are playing around with the
idea of releasing a CD comprised of music used in the film.



WHAT we are looking for--

We\'re looking for popular-style music--like the songs you\'d hear on the
radio.  Something that would play on the same radio station as music by
U2 is what we\'re looking for.  I\'ve heard a couple of songs that I
really like, and if you are familiar with "You" by Cadillac Voodoo Choir
or "I Am" by Train, you know two of them.  The movie is a love story,
but every song used in the movie doesn\'t have to be (and shouldn\'t be) a
love ballad.  We need different kinds of songs for different parts of
the film.



WHAT we are NOT looking for--

This is a low-budget production.  We\'re not looking for music that will
require a large contribution from our budget to obtain rights.  In fact,
many of the bands we\'ve talked to are willing to let us use their songs
just for the exposure it will give them when the film comes out.  Like I
said above, we may assemble a soundtrack CD--but this is still to be
determined.  We\'re not looking for Rap, Hip Hop, Jazz, Blues, or Country
style music.



A little about the film--

The story centers around a man named Christopher.  Like so many of us,
he
was struck with the first sight of a girl, years ago, back when he was
in
high school.  (__Captured with a glance__ is a lyric used in "You" by
Cadillac Voodoo Choir.)

She\'s the one he talks about when the guys are over, playing poker.
She\'s
the one he thinks about when a song hits him just right, or the weather
changes, putting him in that particular mood.

He was crazy about her the whole time he spent in high school, but
nothing
ever matured between them--always just casual friends.

The story picks up with Christopher, years later, at a poker game with
his friends,
when he learns that one of his close buds has seen her.  That old
familiar flame
comes back to him.  It\'s weird how it can hurt like that after all the
time.

He makes his decision, right there, that night.  He\'s got to do
something
about it.

"October" is about unconditional love.  It\'s about loving somebody so
much that you can\'t eat, sleep, or keep you mind
from racing while you do even the simplest things like watching TV.
It\'s about the kind of love that borders on obsession.

It\'s about the crazy things that feelings like this will make you do.

And, "October" is about what it feels like when love like this goes
unrequited.

The film is not a romantic comedy.  It\'s a romantic drama.  I\'d put it
in
the same genre as Good Will Hunting, Chasing Amy, and Indecent Proposal,

leaning towards the first two because of its independent nature.



How to submit material--

Send me an e-mail and tell me a bit about your band.  I\'ll give you the
address, and you may forward a CD to us.  We listen to every CD we
receive.

Pax Rulin subsector (and the one alongside it) was originally described in
the old GDW Adventure 4: Leviathan as at 1107. This explains the Zhodani
world in the "Referee\'s only" section.

The whole sector was subsequently written up in Travellers Digest 20 as at
1120. By then, Pa\'an was listed as Na. The writeup does not include some of
the material from Book 4, though this may have been deliberate in some cases.

Finally, the sector would have been affected significantly during the New
Era timeframe, for a variety of reasons. I think that New Era stats were in
The Regency Sourcebook, which I do not have to hand.

You can probably buy these easily enough. If you want Adventure 4 and can\'t
get it from NZ, email me and I\'ll sell you my copy if you want it (postage
to NZ from Australia is presumably cheaper from elsewhere). There isn\'t all
that much about the world in Supplement 4 really, you could just as well
ignore it and go with your own thoughts.

(Oh yes, I seem to remember an adventure in Challenge or JTAS set somewhere
in Trojan Reach in classic era times, though I don\'t believe it was in the
coreward part of the sector and certainly didn\'t involve Pa\'an).

The other complementary idea is to explain what beam pointers actually do -
if a beam pointer focusses the beam so it\'s the optimum width at a
selectable range, then you clearly dont need one for either personell
weapons (just fix the focus at five kilometers) or missile warheads
(factory-set at the \'combustion range\').

Welll, why not allow \'One Shot Combustion\' at 1 MJ per kilo at TL9, 2 MJ
per kilo at TL 10-11, 4 MJ per kilo X-ray at 12 and 8 MJ per kilo X-ray at
14 ?

I\'ll gearhead up some combustion lasers given these assumptions.

Yeah. Mostly because of the no-nukes rule.

I\'ve been following this discussion closely, and would like to add my 
two cents.
A few years ago I read "The Fist Of God" by F. Forsythe. It went into 
great detail covering low-tech ways to hide things from high-tech 
surveillance. Technology is a good force multiplier, but it is not the 
crystal ball that most people assume. Too much reliance on high tech can 
be a weakness.
The thought of the Texas Nat\'l Guard squaring off against the Regular 
Army reminded me of another great book, "The Art of Manuver" 
(non-fiction) by Robert Leonard. I highly recommend it to anyone 
involved in military oriented campaigns. The gist is that you don\'t have 
to (and shouldn\'t) line up toe to toe with your opponent and slug it out 
until only one person is left standing. Would the Texan\'s have to go 
tank to tank with a Regular division, or could a brilliant tactician 
find a way to win without directly engaging the Regulars?

To quote Cheif Enginner Scott: "Y\'kanna change the laws of physics"

Right now at TL8, we\'ve *already* hit the limits for solid and liquid
fuel rocket engines. ISPs of around 250 and 450 respectively. 

100 g for 16 minutes is a delta-V of about 96,000 m/s. dV=Ve*ln(mass
ratio). Ve= 9.8 * Isp. So:

96000 = 9.8 * 450 * ln(mass ratio)
21.8 = ln(mass ratio)
2.84e9 = mass ratio

So you\'d need a starting mass of around 3 *billion* tons for your 1
dton projectile if you want it to be able to boost at 100g for 16
minutes. 

Or else you need an Isp that\'s *way* up there. Let\'s try a mass ratio
of 2.

96000= 9.8 * Isp *ln(2)
14e3 = Isp

You can easily get that sort of Isp with an ion drive. But you can\'t
get the required *thrust*. So you\'d need at least a gas core nuclear
rocket to achieve that 100g 16 minute performance. 

And even at TL15 getting something like that into a missile will be
difficult.

The courts set up by the *winners* (cf Nuremburg).

And for that matter when it gets down to the question of whether or not
an order is legal, often the civilian authorities get involved.

During the Veteran\'s Bonus March on Washington, General Douglas
MacArthur disobeyed *explicit* orders and set troops and tanks on the
marchers. He only got away with it by making it look like the President
had ordered it.

And how well can TL15 irregulars foil the TL15 government\'s intrusion efforts?

Is there any intrusion effort that cannot be countered?  Not yet.

Of course, response need not be in kind.  In the Texas example, my primary weapon
would be video cameras with live hookups and I\'d do everything I could to protect
the signal.  Public relations can tie the hands of the intruding government in
many cases.
One accident/attrocity/massacre and the fight may well be over.  I\'d fake the
attrocity.
Maybe even fake it before the real fighting starts, and then cut comms to sell
it.
Then \'fix\' comms with more footage.  And all this by way of diversion as my
agents
in the field [deleted by Greater Republic of Texas Security].

You can imagine what a few well-placed Texans behind enemy lines could do
to the technologically dependent and sensitive C3I structure of a US government
at odds with a secessionary state of over 20million, well-equipped, high
technology
possessing rednecks with attitude.  Keep in mind that for every Texan in Texas,
there are 2 that are elsewhere in the country.

Inborn, Interpersonal, Physical, and Vice were "cascade" skills - a player
who rolled one of these whilst generating a character had to immediately
choose one of the individual skills which were grouped under that cascade,
as follows:

     Inborn - Artisan, Carousing, Instruction, JoT, Leader
     Interpersonal - Admin, Interview, Liaison, Linguistics, Steward
     Physical - +1 Dex, +1 End, +1 Str
     Vice - Bribery, Disguise, Forgery, Gambling, Intrusion, Streetwise

As I never bought any of the T4 books (too pricey for my budget, and I
hated the artwork), I can\'t say if the concept of cascade skills was
continued in T4, or what any of the equivalent skills would be.

The few *Traveller Chronicle* issues I\'ve been able to get my hands on were
more like MTJ (or possibly JTAS - I\'m not really familiar with that) than

     The US won by making it too expensive for the British to keep fighting in 
North America.  They had other wars going on at the same time they felt were
more important to win.

     There is also the theory that some British Generals really didn\'t have
their
hearts in the fight.  Fighting the Americans, who mostly were of good
British stock,
wasn\'t same as fighting the French.

     Oh ya, the new legal limit is 10 rounds, not 15...

One of the (successful) defences at Nuremburg was that allied commanders
had ordered similar actions. It worked for one of the German submarine
commanders (his lawyer pointed out that American sub commanders in the
Pacific used the same tactics - case closed).

     During the Japanese occupation, the Viet-Namese were getting assistance
from the OSS.

     By the late 70\'s they had plenty of material left over that the
Chinese and
Russians poured in during the Civil War with the South (You don\'t think they
built all those tanks?), plus all the stuff the Americans left behind.

Unfortunately there\'s an HST map of pluto (heavily interpolated, and perhaps
somewhat exaggerated, but basically reliable) that shows a non-homogenous surface.
Cool idea, though.

One alternative reason to red-zone Pluto could be liquid (superfluid) helium
life forms, beloved of Larry Niven though not wholly plausible...such life-forms
could be extremely vulnerable to contamination and hence need protection. 

Another reason: lingering radiation damage from some early interstellar war,
in which a Vilani fleet tried to conduct ice refuelling on Pluto\'s
surface and was hammered with nukes. 

The Ancient site isn\'t actually as terrible in this context as it could be,
since Sol was known to be of considerable interest to Gramps; there ought to
be *some* evidence left over. Of course, maybe the only evidence remaining is
a nanotech weapon (that only works at 10 kelvin) that turns anything it 
touches into goop...

  Would a fusion-ramjet be something like the fusion air-rams featured in
GURPS Vehicles? That is, suck in local atmosphere (using fuel scoops as
intakes maybe), then use the fusion reactor to supeheat it and ram it out
as reaction mass. We have been using something of this sort to hanwave
away the problems associated with HEPlaR and atmospheres. Is this even
theoretically feasible?

  As for the ducted fans, I\'ve been using them in 2300AD. (I use FF&S1 to
design my ships and vehicles in this game too.) However, it seems the
ducted fan stats given in FF&S1 are somewhat pessimistic. Even at TL-14 it
seems pretty difficult to design anything that will fly under ducted fans
alone. Should this be so? Also, should the thigns be quite this
astronomically expensive?

\'Course, if you use grav cargo bots (like\'ll be in some upcoming pics), then
you don\'t need no steeeenking cargo ramps :)

The crates just kinda\' ended up that color for the time being.  Alot of real
world cargo shipping containers range from a dirty orange all the way to a
burnt umber color (deep chocolate brown) in the reference photos that have.
They also don\'t currently have any texture maps.  Finished product for G:T
and future use on my site will look more realistic and less wood-like.  Of
course, on backwaters they may just ship it with whatever they have per an
earlier TML thread.

Damn, forgot about the Donosev!  That must be because one of my "friends"
LOST my copy of the DGP World Builder\'s Handbook.  I\'m still pissed at him
for that.  You\'re right, that\'s one fugly ship.

See ya!

got the number down to something like 90, compared to the approx 130

The number of Cascades was reduced to 3 (Aircraft, Blade Cbt, and
Gun Cbt), but most skills were grouped into related Clusters.  The
clusters worked much like cascades did, ie. if you get the cluster
you must pick a skill from its list, but you don\'t get a default
skill to other skills within the cluster.  The cascades did give a
default skill to other skills in their lists.

If you want skills that aren\'t listed you can add them, like I
did, even make up new clusters or cascades if you want.  I\'ll admit
it gets to be a lot of trouble if you then need to change the career
tables, but you will probably want to do that.

IAC, and IMO, the closest matches for the skills you asked about
are...

The answer to your first question is "yes".  They are simply selling off
the stock of the game they published (T4).

Of course, these products will float around in the used gaming product
market for the next decade or so, so I\'d say they were not exactly truthful
in saying this was the last chance to buy "Traveller" (T4 or otherwise)
ever.

As for T5, always in motion is the future.  Marc is patiently and carefully
developing the next incarnation of Traveller.  I will insert a dose of
skepticism here, although I am optimistic, and say that he has many steps
yet to take before a T5 book or books is/are published.  There is such a
thing as a "vanity press" which will produce whatever you desire in book
form for a price, but finding a "real" publisher, some company willing to
risk capital on a print run, and able to distribute to book/game stores,
would be preferable.

With Imperium Games lying in ruin behind it (GDW\'s end cannot be blamed in
any way on Traveller, debatably), T5 may be a bit of a hard sell.  It is
quite possible that the "legacy market" is the only one left (without
significant publicity efforts), and that market cannot absorb more than a
few hundred copies.

Our role, then, is to encourage a new market for Traveller items.  This
would have to be a grassroots effort to enlist young men and women (or boys
and girls) with a measure of disposable income to play Traveller in some
form so that when the next version of the game does arrive, there is at
least some new group of customers waiting for it.

I would suggest that we all go out and become middle school teachers, but
practicality intercedes.  Finding a game store and hosting an active game
one night a week is a close second.  Hosting a game period is a good third.

Strategically, the release of T5 could benefit from "Star Wars Hype", but I
don\'t think this is in the same category as the original movie\'s "splash".

Just my thoughts.

They were already spacefaring then, so it\'s still kinda hard, no?  Hell, they
were spacefaring 1000 years before teh Sumerians started using cuniform
script.  Yet Terrans caught and passed them in a few centuries.

Well I don\'t think they\'re used *that* much, but are still too readily
accepted as a solution, especially pre TNE.   In fact, my campaigns haven\'t
run across an Ancients site yet.  But that\'s in TNE, who\'s authors had the
same opinion as you. : )  Now we\'ve run into Droyne and Chirpers a few times
and one player has gotten pretty curious about the Coyns...

I\'ve already pretty much discarded the Ancients theory for MTU.  I was
thinking a Skunkworks type thing.   Rats & Cats only said the Imperium red
zoned it and *then* the Solomani kept it in force, but didn\'t seem to indicate
that it had been interdicted *before* the Imperial occupation.   An ancients
site would\'ve been interdicted since the Interstellar Wars, if not before.

<snip>

Wow.  That\'s pretty good.  Probably what i\'ll use.  That or a skunkworks... or
better yet, both. : )

No, not really.  Canon doesn\'t say what\'s there.  In fact, there seems to be
indications it wasn\'t interdicted until the Imperials occupied Terra.

Imperium Games owes a bucketload of money to a number of creditors and also
has a history of taking people\'s money and not giving them anything in return;
at one point (and maybe still, for all I know) they were barred from selling
their stock of books, as their license had lapsed, and there were all sorts of
legal wranglings going on.

This cropped up a month or so ago. I think Marc was asked on the list if this
was legit, in light of what he had said before, regarding their right to sell
the material, and he didn\'t answer, unless I missed it.

IOW: caveat emptor!

But the frogs couldn\'t have taken Normandy alone.  The French were conquered
and it wasn\'t their resistance that liberated France.  Shooting one Nazi and
grabbing his gun is different from liberating your own country.  American
could have done much better in Vietnam if the politicians gave the

AK-47?  I don\'t know.  That\'s like starting the .45 vs. 9mm debate) American

Oh, come on!  That was a decision made by Bush.  American troops were ready
to go stomping in there like bad asses and pull him out of there.  The
politicians want us to believe that the reason they didn\'t do it is because
they aren\'t bullies.  I\'ve already voiced my opinion about why they didn\'t
attack him, personally.  And with these last 90+ bombs/missiles, it seemed
like someone was pulling punches.

First of all, how do you know that they are still there?

Second of all, how do you know they even exist?

Third, they aren\'t giving their location away by attacking any targets, as
in the situation I described above.  I would hardly call it a war...

This got me thinking.

Do the Aslan and Vargr have certain strategies they prefer to employ when
fighting?

If they are anything like their non-upright counterparts, this is what I
envision:

ASLAN would use "hunt" in isolation, using stealth and silence, getting as
close as possible and then pouncing with tremendous damage (maybe using a
cloaking device?).  Or, they may just run down their "prey" with speed.
Perhaps their ships would have spikes on them and they would just ram their
enemies, not visible until almost too late?

VARGR would "hunt" in packs and pick the weakest target and overwhelm it
while the others ran away.  You could hear them "a mile away" and could pick
some of them off, but they\'d get their "food" for the day.  Whether on the
ground or in space, they would have some kind of "howl" mechanism (hailing
frequency?) that would send chills down a human\'s spine.

Whaddya think?

Certainly the consensus in the public literature is that we\'re a long way from
that level of (useful to tactical commanders) satellite recon; there are 
not that many imaging satellites, they have narrow fields of view, they take
time to point to new targets, and they only pass over given pieces of territory
periodically. Satellite recon is a theatre-level asset, not something for
"what\'s over that ridge". 

>>ObTrav: How intrusive can a high law, TL15 government be?
>If they can see through solids...

Probably they can\'t see through solids very well; of known traveller
technologies, only radar could really do this, and it\'s not hard to make a 
wall opaque to radar. Certainly they can\'t see through walls from satellites.
On the other hand, by TL-15, visible-light satellite imaging probably has 
reached the point where a cop on the beat can call up a real-time satellite
picture of who\'s waiting for him around the corner, at centimeter resolution.
There may even be a real-time record at a frame per second or so of the 
whole planet at 1 meter resolution and major cities at 1cm resolution,
going back a couple of hours...

So felons (=PCs) fleeing the scene of a crime could be tracked (until they
got indoors) by reviewing the tapes, if the crime was discovered in an hour.

But if a brilliant tactician refused to work for the Regulars after the
govt. oftened him better pay, threatened him and his loved ones, had the
media blackbawl, they could send some brilliant assassins to put him on ice.

A Texan militia would be looking for new highly-skilled recruits and it
might not be apparent that they are working for the other side.

Not that i want to rehash this yet again, but the battles were won, just not
the campaign.  Tet was defeated.  It was the political will that was
destroyed.  Of course, the campaign had no objectives that could be
accomplished that would\'ve allowed us to say "we won, we can leave now."   If
it would\'ve been to kill or drive off Ho Chi Min, that would\'ve been one thing
(the Soviet reaction another).  Instead we shouldered more and more of the
ARVNs role and it became politically unviable to continue. 

Ob Trav.  In the Spinward Marches region, pick a world in the Federation or
even Arden itself.. a world that has been courted by the Zhos and Imperials.
Toss in a seperatist movement on a world and and toss in the Darrians or
Swords Worlders to be the French.  Just because no guerilla wars have been
recorded doesn\'t mean they haven\'t happened...  Now connect all teh dots. : )

Yeah.  Don\'t use a SEAL, let to black UN Helos take em out. ; )  Saddam is

Depends on the govt and law level, no? ; )  As far as the Imperials...  IMTU
Imperial Intelligence mostly watched anything they cared to.  They were just
discrete about it.    In the Coalition, which is still young and developing
its traditions, there are competing factions of thought for it\'s intelligence
apparatus.  One of which is mentioned in TTCs Long Way Home and could go over
quite wrong as they "practice" on the home front.

If the coppers are on the side of the secessionists, is the UN going to
recognize their authority if they are the enemy?

  They would have happily dealt with the Devil to achieve national liberation
 - they later did with the Chinese and there wasn\'t much difference to tell
between the two from their POV. They certainly weren\'t real thrilled to have
the Japanese staying there.

...
Russians poured in during the Civil War with the South (You don\'t think they
built all those tanks?), plus all the stuff the Americans left behind.

  Of course not - they can thank heaven for the global politics that made
their entrepots for Soviet-bloc goods strategic sanctuaries.
  
  Plus, the NVA had a lot of experience; the PLA had learned some unpleasant
truths against the Indians but those lessons evidently weren\'t directly
related to battlefield application.

  To a certain extent, the 3I can look at a lot of its\' member states as
being (internal) clients, or at least the ones that are either on the
frontier of the time or are big enough to be potential pocket empires in
their own right. It must certainly contribute to keeping the Imperium an
awfully careful overlord.

Thanks for the reply, I\'m currently interested in the Aslan Ihatei Fleets
and the Imperial responce toward them following the assassination of the
emperor in 1116. My take on all this was that the Imperium was distracted
by the assassination, internal rioting and poor planning (with a little bit
of bad luck thrown in for good measure) thus allowing the Aslan fleets to
capture 20 systems (as per MT Rebellion Sourcebook p.60) during 1118 and a
further 10 or so in 1119.

Also, one of the keys to this has been the _Blitzkrieg_(?) approach adopted
by the Aslan. I\'ve assumed that the previous Aslan Ihatei fleets have been
small (2-3 hugh people movers with half a dozen or so escorts) and once
they found a suitable system (occupied or not) they would settle and stop
advancing. I\'ve formulated an Imperial responce to this and it has worked
in the past (a history created by me, so it\'s going to work :). The actions
following the assassination by the Aslan were more forceful and involved
hugh battle fleets to force the Imperial forces backward and exposing their
boarder worlds to colinisation. These fleets would continue to advance,
attacking key worlds and forcing the Imperial forces backward.

One of the problems I\'m facing in constructing a timeline of events is the
length of time needed to capture a world. I realise this is kinda like "How
long is a piece of string?", but has anyone given any thought to this,
given TL, population size, bases present etc..?

Also, has anyone considered the possibility of compiling a Best of TML
site/newsletter/document with the key topics of the year in summary (eg.
deck orientation, micro-jumps, background music etc...). Just a thought.

Well, sorta depends on what you want to see on the other side.  Neutrino
sensors, densitometers, and (as far as I can tell) neural activity sensors can
see through walls, though none of them are horribly useful for surveillance
purposes (hm...ok, I can detect people with fusion plants in their basements,
grav tanks in their basements, and can detect people at short range with
extremely limited information about who they are).

I would be surprised if they don\'t have chemical sensors which can track by
smell, however, though I don\'t immediately recall sources for such a device
existing.

What happened to the sort of thermal imaging shown in Patriot Games and in

I would think that would be enough to even see that a husband was sensing an

Look at Star Trek. You do not need a big ship. A 100-Scout is large enough to 
handle most task and situations and keep the main PCs busy. And let them make use 
of there skills!!

Keep the PC/NPC ratio at 4:2 so you the ref. can interact with them. If they have 
no NPCs the story can possible focus around the relations between the players. 
Which ist not always a good thing.

If you want to have more Exploration Displacements with you on the trip, take more 
Scout Ships with you. So you can introduce sudden changes with pushes and pulls.

Well, I don\'t know about your TL15 hypothetical, but if its similar to
the Texas example, the oppressed oppposition has the very best of what
the oppressing government has and is in many ways one of the vital legs
of the larget government.  Imagine a three-legged stool with California,
New York and Texas as legs (sorry other states, its just an example);
remove one leg, or just _weaken_ its ability to support the weight and PLOP!

I don\'t know from Tempest.  Some of the key US defense contractors making
those cruise missiles, weapons, etc., are in Texas.  Wouldn\'t be too hard to
stockpile in preparation.

BTW, this discussion is getting too widely scattered between whatever
the TL15 hypothetical actually is and a Texas succession.

I\'d rather not get into the Waco issue.  But the Branch Davidians had all kinds
of problems, including a lack of substantial public support. I think there can
be
little disagreement that the media there did at the very least slow down the
ATF/FBI.

Nothing brilliant.  Its an old trick.  In World War I, the Germans took over
Belgian telegraph wires and broadcast false reports of French aggression
and requests for German assistance.  Of course no one would believe those
but that wasn\'t the point.  Confusion was.  IIRC, they did something similar
in WWII.

I\'m not sure what makes me sadder - what my country did in Vietnam, or the
fact that so many will not admit the alliance we were part of got our butts
kicked.

Allied troops in the southern portion of Vietnam had all the political
rights they needed - free fire zones etc . Direct intervention in the north
was limited by the threat of Chinese intervention, which the allied powers
wished to avoid for obvious reason. I\'m really not sure what else Johnson
could have done, but I\'m sure the proponents of the \'stab in the back\'
theory will be able to think of something.

I\'m sure it wont be anything useful, like instituting a crash course in
Vietnamese for all soldiers pre-posting.

Quite simply, the Americans and their allies were out-thought and
out-generalled, and were completely unprepared for the reality that the
Vietnamese were going through a social revolution (eg land reform in the
Mekong delta ... best way to turn a Communist into a Christian Democrat is
to give him a quarter-acre, two pigs and a dozen chickens. Unfortunatly,
much hard work and effort by the RVN government turned the Mekong delta\'s
landowning pattern back to a few big landowners and lots of landless
peasants).

Clif, let me introduce you to the Political Facts of Life, as they apply to
Iraq.

Fact One : There are two and two halves viable governments in Iraq.
Government one is the Ba\'ath Party (aka Saddam, relatives and buddies).
Government two is the Communist Party of Iraq, who are unreconstructed
Stalinists. Half number one is the Kurds. Turkey, a US ally, has a Kurd
Problem, and avoiding a viable Kurdish state in ex-Iraq is an absolute key
of Turkish foriegn policy. Half number two is Iran, who would quite happily
set up a puppet state among the Shi\'ites of the south.

Everyone else is in exile, dead or both. I\'ll say one thing for Leninists -
they are damn good at surviving very oppressive governments.

Fact Two : Iraq has lots of oil. While it is not exporting it, it\'s share
of proven world reserves goes up.

Fact Three : Iraq is between Iran and the Western client states of the Gulf.


Now, the UN forces *could* have knocked over Saddam at the end of the
Second Gulf War (remember the first one, where our good buddy Saddam was
fighting those nasty Iranians for us ?) ... the problem is what you do
next. Iraq isnt post-Nazi germany, which had a democratic history at least.
It isnt Vichy France, where you could construct a client state after
conquest that could maintain order for you. It\'s Iraq, and the Ba\'ath party
has been liquidating it\'s opponents for thirty years.

What ye shall sow, so shall ye reap.

Now, hauling this ruthlessly back onto Trav, the Imperium will often be in
a situation of kingmaker.

What does the Imperium do when it has suppressed a rebellion ? Does it
install and attempt to maintain a puppet government, or does it \'restore
order\' and then sail away, with a warning not to do it again (isnt it Dlan
that has that nice sterile band around the equator ?).

	If you want some grist for your thoughts on insurgency, the military, plus
alot of good Traveller ideas, read the Sci-Fi book series   "Falkenberg\'s
Legion"  by Jerry Pournelle and S.M. Stirling _the books are Falkenberg\'s
Legion (consisting of two older books The Mercenary and West of Honor combined
in one volume), Prince of Mercenaries,  Go Tell the Spartans, and Prince of
Sparta.    It\'s future history has been more or less rendered moot by the
collapse of the Soviet Union, but it has a lot to say about how the military
must act in response to classic leftist insurgency (the answers may not always
be pretty, but ring more or less true).  Besides, they are a ripping good read
(and each one is actually better than the last).

Interestingly, according to Kings Regs, the defence of "I was just following
orders" was a legal and valid one until ... guess when ... early 1944!

According to recent (past couple of years) article by a Judge Advocate type
(don\'t remember whether he was US or UK Armed Forces) was that it was *still* a
valid defence, just under more restricted circumstances.

For example, as I recall from the article, he gave the example of a junior
soldier (he must have been UKAF) who was given an order by a trusted senior
officer or NCO ... the argument would be that the junior soldier would have so
much trust in said superior that he would not even be able to concieve that the
order was illegal.

Of course, I doubt they allowed *that* defence at Nuremburg, which was about
legal-seeming revenge more than "justice". (Not that most of the bastards didn\'t
deserve to hang, but why be legalistic about it if you can\'t make it stick
without making up and bending the "rules" as you go along).

Uhhh...Hollyweird is not a generally good place to get an idea of how
realistic some sensor mode would be. Bluntly: No way, no how, not
through walls. No matter how good of IR sensor technology you have,
putting an insulating wall between you and the sourse will degrade your
resolution really, _really_ fast. Think air scatters IR badly? Wait till
you try to image it through concrete and fiberglass. The equivalent of
trying to read a paperback through 6" of mud.

At very best, you will be able to resolve people\'s locations behind very
thin partitions.

All those glorious false color Hollywood SFX look great, but are
physically impossible.

Now..._outdoor_ IR scanning like that, perfectly doable; we do it today.
Most night vision systems also can use an IR illuminator. All the nifty
false color stuff requires is a reasonably fast signal processing
computer.

Uhhh, stay with me, now.  I wasn\'t talking about Vietnam at that point.
That was the Texas scenario.  One SEAL rucking a Nuke to an objective near
the opposition\'s HQ.  With a backpack nuke and a handheld detonator you
could hold the very people who want to shoot you hostage.

I was under the impression that thermal imaging was based on a different,
much-less-portable, technology.

IR usually makes hot/warm things look brighter than the surrounding area on
a sort of grayscale or monochrome screen, from what I have seen.

Thermal imaging, on the other hand, assigns a bright color to a certain
level of temperature, so that now, instead seeing an illuminated man, you
now see a man with a red shape in the center of his chest.  If it is cold
outside and he has been out there for a while, his fingers will probably be
a few shades of color different than the rest of him.

Yes, I know.  I used the goggles and bought my own used AN-PVS-2A Starlight
Scope(for my AR15A2 Delta HBAR) which appeared to have been sold to the
Israelis after it served in Vietnam.  It cost me $1700 dollars and did not
resemble thermal imaging, at all.  In fact, the newer generation Starlight
Technology in the late 80\'s, gave better contrast than my Vietnam era scope,
but it replaced the detail with a "snowy" kind of contrast.  I\'m familiar
with how things got brighter when I shined my flashlight with IR filter at
something, but neither scope revealed HEAT, so I don\'t even know WHY you
brought up IR when I mentioned thermal imaging.

Well, that\'s what canon seems to imply...

1) the external Imperial borders in almost all canon material (with the
exception of the Vargr and Zhodani) are described as stable.

2) There are far, far more planets within the Imperium, than on the border.

3) Strike and Siege (which implies combat missions against planets) are
common Imperial Navy assignments (Battle - which implies combat against
other ships is relatively rare).  This would indicate that the Navy is used
far more often against targets that do not have naval defenses (because they
depend on the Imperium for those very defenses?) than those that do.

4) Police Action, Counter Insurgency, and Internal Security are common
assignments for the Imperial Army and Marines.  Counter Insurgency and
Internal Security definitely imply use within the borders, Police Action
(and Raid for that matter) are kind of non-specific - they could go either
way.

5) I can\'t remember where I read it, but I am pretty sure (sigh, that\'s
definitive, isn\'t it?) that Type 6 governments within the Imperium (unless
otherwise defined) are Navy imposed Governors.

Based on this, my Imperium is not the \'nice\' place that seems to be the
dominent ideal on the TML...

Aslan are not related to cats. In fact, they only kind of look like cats. If

I would tend to disagree with this. Vargr are, after all, sentient. I think
that they would react mostly like humans in combat. The differences would be
subtle. I\'m not sure though, I\'d have to pay closer attention to dogs. :^)

Sort of.  They\'re both IR sensors, though.  Best I know its kind of like the
difference between black and white and color -- IR sensors can only detect
brightness, thermographs can also detect peak emissions frequency

With attitude?  I\'ll say.  Do you all wear big red "S"es on your chests,
too?

Y\'know, I just got done telling Joe Kemp (the original poster on this thread)
off-list that what probably set a lot of people off was not the details of
his timeline, but the focus on the GREAT STATE OF TEXAS*, of which he just
happens to be a citizen.  To be fair, what\'s in his timeline is fairly 
mild - mere hometown pride.

But then, you go ahead and provide a textbook example of the extreme
version.  Good job.

Guess what, Bloo?  A lot of non-Texans think of you much like the French
Quebecois:  loud, arrogant, annoying, and not nearly as special as they
like to think they are.

Yes, this is a flame.  Apologies to the rest of the list for this moment of

Just a "me too" expression of "wow"

Personally, I think this series of pictures of yours sets the standard
for Traveller pictures.

The Foss stuff used in T4 didn\'t fit all that well, and some of the
old B&W stuff from things like "Fighting Ships" was frankly awful. I
can now point people at these ships and say "that\'s Traveller".

I\'m not sure what you are disagreeing with.  Hunting in packs?  The
electronic howl?  The whole paragraph?

I can see where their long distance communication (howling) may have been
adapted to wireless use, especially if commo is not a regularly manned post
on a Vargr ship (missiles, after all, are the only proper way to reach out
and touch someone) - to answer a hail too quickly might be a submissive
behavior in Vargr.  In that case, an electronic equivalent to a \'howl\' might
not be that far out of charactor.

Indeed, the aggressive posture that Vargr \'Corsairs\' assume may have
originally been the long distance version of \'pack\' behaviour (perhaps
something similar to \'counting coup\' to establishing who is dominent), and
our apish reaction (holy sh*t, kill them!!) of reactive hostility may not
have been appropriate.

So far as infantry tactics, I don\'t see any reason that \'pack\' mentality may
not be appropriate.  I envision three basic types, followers (beta Vargr
following the leaders) who cluster around leaders (Vargr with established
charisma) and rogues (alpha Vargr without established charisma and unwilling
to accept the established authority).  The \'rogues\' will be the dangerous
ones, as they will be trying to establish themselves and will be
unpredictable.  Most are killed (if not by the enemy, than by the leader
they are trying to usurp.)

Hmmm...I\'m going to have to re-read my Vargr modules - now I\'m interested!

thread put me in mind of a civil war game I\'ve played. No, not the civil
war in 1860\'s US - the civil war in 14th century England. Avalon Hill\'s
_Kingmaker_, a War of the Roses simulation.

In _Kingmaker_, you have various factions competing to be the power
behind whichever claimant attains the throne. However, just to keep
things interesting, the business of government goes on unabated while
this little armed argument flares up all over England. Peasant revolts,
raids by Scots highland clans, piracy, even an assault by the French
on the English outpost of Calais. These events can pop up and pull
away your most powerful lords at a moments notice. 

"Damn! We\'re assaulting London, where in Hades is Lord Mowbray?"
"Sire, Mowbray and his knights were called away at the last minute
to put down an uprising in Wales. His office as Marshal of England,
you know. He\'ll be back in a fortnight or so."

These external (and internal) matters were just as, or even more
important than the civil war that was going on - what matter which
royal claimant won the throne if the French invaded (again) and
took the whole country away from everyone?

How this relates to the Texans?

The Texans need to wait for (or engineer) some external, global crisis, one 
that will take up all the resources and attentions of the US Federal 
government. While the US is otherwise occupied, make a calm, reasoned 
withdrawal from the country. Do all possible during the confusion to 
legitimize the Republic of Texas as an independant country, and hope that 
the US is so desperate for international approval in the aftermath of the crisis
that they\'ll be leery of bringing Texas back to the fold by overt means.

ObTrav: Would there be a client state willing to touch off a frontier war,
hoping that the border readjustments afterwards (a la Fourth Frontier War)
would change the situation enough to gain their freedom?

Or (better yet for adventure seeds), an extremist faction from this
client state?

That\'s not what I read about a big wargame "I can\'t remember where" that
took place not more than 2 years ago.  They even had Grid coordinates.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
My brother is a commo tech in the US Army. His team in a wargame
had a satellite link - they ID\'ed an "enemy" Major from a satellite-based
real time video, and were thus able to direct a light unit to his location
and capture him. Except for a few hairy minutes when the "enemy"
commo techs managed to hack into their wireless wide-area-network,
my brother\'s team was never without real-time unit locations (and usually
accurate unit identifications) of all "enemy" assets.

However, this wargame was specifically devised to test what was possible
for tactical use of satellite data - the investment of gear, assets and
trained personell was much higher than usual to allow these tricks to
work properly. There\'s no telling how long it will be before such a wealth
of information becomes standard operating procedure for our military.

You\'re making some assumptions here. You\'re assuming the opposition
will have something remotely resembling a central HQ. 

You\'re assuming the US wants to use weapons of mass destruction
on their own soil - ok, the Republic of Texas may call it RoT soil,
but Uncle Sammy still thinks of it as his own. Not to mention the PR
hit when you pop a nuke on downtown Corpus Christi. (Though I could
see the looney who came up with the backpack nuke plan having a
plan to blame it on the insurgents.)

You\'re assuming the RoT sepratists have enough assets in any one place
to make a nuke (even a "backpack nuke") an appropriate weapon to use.
The very existance of such weapons makes dispersal necessary, if you
realize your opponent has the will to use them.

(For example: a book _The Ayes of Texas_ by Daniel Da Cruz, the
Soviet Union has tricked the US into an alliance, pretty much on the
USSR\'s terms. Texas secedes rather than allow a Soviet fleet to make
a "friendship visit" to a Texan seaport. Soviets say they are coming in
anyway. Several hundred thousand Texan volunteer civilian militia are wiped 
out in minutes during the first battle of the war, as they didn\'t realize the 
Soviets had nerve gas and - more importantly - the will to use it. Pretty far 
fetched, but what the hey.)

Then permit me to educate you on how sentient beings who were(are?) the most
highly trained infantry in the world in the late 80\'s whooped up on their
foes.

I am speaking of the OPFOR at Ft. Chaffee, Arkansas, a.k.a., the Joint
Readiness Training Center.  In saying they are the most highly trained, etc.
I only quote U.S. Army literature, understanding that there is some bias
there, but let me describe these guys...

Once night fell, these 11 Bravo\'s and 19 Delta\'s(grunts and scouts) spent
their "workday" probing perimeters and working to wreak simulated death and
destruction.  They did this EVERY workday, then during the day they went to
see their girlfriends in town.  I know because I had the luxury of "rapping"
with two of them while I had them in my custody.  A sergeant scolded me for
talking to them, but I wasn\'t giving anything up(except a mock ignorance).
Besides, frickin\' S-2 never even interrogated them.  Eventually, they died
of their simulated wounds which we never made it a priority to bind.

Literally like ghosts that disappeared as soon as they got into the
treeline, they talked to each other with bird noises.  Their reputation
preceded then, so that after a week of not hearing from our Special Ops guys
who jumped in, we were thoroughly spooked.  (even knowing it was only a
game)

Before they attacked they howled like coyotes.  Some of them sounded sickly.
It gave a person goosebumps when you were smart enough to realize that was
who it was.  (Some dummies thought it was coyotes.)  After they attacked and
had became one with nature, once again, they howled again, marking their
victory and departure.

That is how sentient beings waged war, apparently.  Why should the dog-like
Vargr be deprived of the same?

    Why doesn\'t NASA or some other government body, say the dept. of Energy
Scale up the Russian Topaz reactor to power the station?  For that matter
you could put up ten of the existing model to power that orbital railgun.

    The use of on orbit reactors like the Topaz would not only increase

of orbital power systems, but the reactor wouldn\'t be as susceptible to

  This actually came up in a conversation today; the Turkish military has
a Really Good grasp on _why_ it doesn\'t want independent Kurds, anywhere.
Doesn\'t mean that their goals are rational, but that\'s not very relevant.

  Whatever the policy-makers on the spot decide - this is Traveller after all :)
I actually like the outline in Tancred; the 3I will accept that the new regime
is the same as the old regime even if it\'s aware of just how the faction change
came about. Loyalty matters, requiring anything much more than that would take
a great deal of intervention to maintain in the long term, which is not how
the Third Imperium seems to be inclined.

    My understanding was that Thermal Imagery detected Thermal Radiation,
while Infra-red detected variations in actual temperature... Of course I
have
no idea where I got this, so I don\'t have a way to check my "facts".

I meant every word.

"Simulation" is a very general term. Chess is a simulation (albeit a
highly stylized and abstracted one) of ancient mass combat. Modern
flight simulators can be highly realistic and accurate simulations of
true-to-life aircraft performance.

Avalon Hill\'s _Kingmaker_ is a simulation designed to highlight the
difficulties of running a civil war while you still have responsibilities
to the business of the kingdom.  It\'s not intended to be realistic down
to the logistics of marching your troops across England.

Any maker of wargames (or computer games) will tell you that you
have to prioritize what you are simulating. Does your new Traveller
ship combat simulator intend to highlight logistical problems of fleets,
or detection problems of single picket ships? What you do not directly
simulate must be abstracted. A fleet combat game will tell you what
your picket ships detected, but may not have the level of detail that
would allow you to pull patrol tricks and get a better scan of the
opposing force. A single-ship combat game would let you try the sneaky
tricks, and have rules for them, but wouldn\'t (or at least shouldn\'t) have
you spend time making resupply decisions for every ship in the sector.

_Kingmaker_ happened to focus it\'s simulation on political maneuvering
and the possible effects of outside forces on the war, rather than placing
the detail priority on combat, logistics, or movement. It\'s not a detailed 
medieval combat simulator, nor was it intended to be.

There may be some residual problems from the hacker (cracker, whatever) who
had a go at the Pyramid computer that also held the TNS mailing list.  They
did send out e-mails encouraging people to resub.  However, I\'m not sure
the resubscription process worked properly; I never got the confirming
e-mail and haven\'t gotten those new TNS entries either.

I disagree to a large extent. "The Traveller Book" was excellent for its
time. However, especially recently, the bar has been raised for the look and
feel of RPGs lately.

RPGs must be art heavy, and must be art heavy with, at the very least,
decent art. Even SJG has picked up on this recently, which is a really good
thing to some, and a really bad thing to others.

There\'s a reason, and it\'s partially technological and partially
psychological. Back when Traveller first came out, "art sparse" was just
part of the times. GDW was a wargame publisher, and their rules showed it.
The layout was good, information was easy to find, however, art was sparse.
This wasn\'t a bad thing by any means, especially since Traveller was sold
through hobby shops... Wargamers were the first market for Traveller (and
other RPGs) and they expected an RPG to be light on art and heavy on rules.
Technologically, it was relatively difficult to do art-heavy layouts. That
was what the industry dealt with.

All that changed in the early 90s, and it\'s never been the same since, nor
will it ever be the same. First of all, it\'s important to note that gaming
outlets have changed considerably. I\'m not sure about other areas of the
world, but here on the East Coast in the U.S., there are very few dedicated
hobby shops. Wargaming has been dead for years (at least as a popular
hobby). Comic book stores are where the sales are at these days. If there\'s
one thing I know about comic book fans is that they like art... Whether it\'s
traditional comic books, or anime and manga they like their rulebooks
artwork heavy. TSR and White Wolf are the leaders in sales and take a look
at _any_ of their books. In a couple of cases, these companies aren\'t even
using black and white art anymore!

Whether using the new terrain of the RPG industry is good or bad is purely
up to the individual reader. It\'s a matter of necessity these days, not just
an extra perk.

There are a number of things in Trav that are hard to sell to younger
players too, but I won\'t get too into detail, since I\'ve gone there one too
many times on this list. Suffice to say that winning over new players _will_
make older players angry in one way or another.

Keep in mind it\'s not always quality or completeness that counts though.

And doing a reasonably good job of it...

 While you might find some Vargr going to great technological effort to
emulate their ancestors (Terran canines, for those of you just joining the
Traveller scene), much of what you describe was bred out of them during their
uplift by the Ancients. It is a truism of sentience that much of the instinct
that kept your non-sentient ancestors alive to develop into you is utterly
replaced by the sentience they developed. The result is that (in the case of
the Vargr) primitive hunters will re-develop the pack hunting techniques, but
only as learned behavior, not as instinct. More advanced Vargr may consciously
develop "The Pack" as a military tactic involving selective targetting and
concentration of fire. The howl is probably the hallmark of a few units of
nutcases the Leaders send in first...

 In the case of the Aslan, however, the only ones who use the solitary hunt as
a real-life tactic are the Assassins. Others use it for actually hunting and
for relaxation, but again the instincts surrounding hunting have been wiped
out by sentience and technological development. Past material shows that the
closest Terran equivalent to the Aslan are the Shogunate-Era Samurai of Japan:
In politics and in war, you maneuver your opponent to a place where you can
either publicly destroy him, or have him publicly destroy himself. Stealth is
a tool for making maneuvers, not for the actual destruction...

 Apologies for being so obtuse. It just came out that way...

The easy space opera feel of turning the Vargr into nothing more than...
well, dogs.

When I was reading excerpts from that book by Desmond Morris a little while
ago I was fascinated by how _subtley_ our behavior was related to that of
our ancestors. My apologies that I can\'t remember the name of the book, it\'s
quite popular though.

Anyhow, that\'s what I was trying to get at. We\'re not quite the apes we used
to be, and I don\'t think that the Vargr are quite the canines that _they_
used to be. At least not precisely the dogs they used to be.

Maybe because on a high TL battlefield such behavior would be (at the very
least) contrary to survival?

Remember, we\'re not simply talking about a modern day battlefield here. Your
example is excellent, as long as audio sensors are relegated to the old Mk.
I Ear or something similiar.

I\'m not saying that your idea\'s _bad_, I\'m just saying Vargr wouldn\'t be
terribly effective on the battlefield in such a case. Further, responses to
a combat situation can be entirely different. In one case, a group of
corner-yahoos in front of a bar might group together and beat someone to a
pulp. On the other hand, a trained special forces sniper might off a guard
at a distance and move on to another location before a search party could be
organized to track him down.

Two different approaches to taking someone down. Of course, there are
thousands and thousands more. Forcing Vargr down a narrow path in a military
situation based on the behavior of their non-sentient ancestors makes them
pretty much useless on a battlefield, and not the threat to the Imperium
that they have been portrayed.

For example, a personal fight between two humans might be resolved in a
fashion much like our ancestors, alot of "chest beating" and yelling in an
attempt to drive off the opponent. However, the battlefields of Europe in
WWII were very different situations.

Some elements might be similar, but I doubt that the Vargr would act just as
dogs do.

  Assuming that you\'re not genuinely paranoid, it might be worth considering
that he\'s suggesting that this is not the appropriate place to discuss the
politics or world-views involved (just as we\'re not discussing AD&D either).

  If he\'s correct, then failing to do so is to state that your "freedom of
speech" _really_ means the "right" to intrude on others privacy; I understand
that there are forums for conspiracy theories and alternative politics.

In general , I don\'t bother with "RPG" stores. Amazon.com usually have
what ever you want and cheaper than the publisher too.

Otherwise, for new and special items,  I go straight to the

In fact I suspect this may be their first real combat mount, a
submarine or similar sized naval vessel has easily enough power to
drive one of these things.

They don\'t have to be so massive.

The ones I was talking about include one that is about 1.5m long and
can be carried by a single technicican. (minus power supply, of
course)

Probably the most "operational" one is 6m long, designed to fit into a
main battle tank turret.
The power supply ( an MHD ) is mounted on  two seperate tracked
vehicles, one for the MHD, the other a bank of capacitors.

Yes,  the whole system weighs several tonnes, but the turret itself is
lighter than a normal MBT turret,  (no need for the heavy breech block
of a conventional gun)and the power requirement could be provided by
generators that have already been orbited.  Rail-guns need much less
power than destructive lasers, which have also been seriously proposed
as orbital weapons.

The major problem (other than political ramifications) of having an
operatinal rail-gun in orbit would be in keeping it supplied with ammo
if it ever had to fire repeatedly in anger, and protecting it from
opposing rail guns.

Most planning involves mounting such things deep in the Moon , or in
re-positioned asteroids, with built-in refineries to produce ammo.

My friends and me we have decided to begin a new campaign of Traveller,
and we\'ll use the GURPS System, some of the members of the group are
more comfortable with this system. The Campaign is in Spinward marches,
more precisely in the subsectors of Querion, Darrian, Vilis, and Sword
Worlds. I bought \'Behind the Claw (BH)\' and when I began to compare with
the data of CT and MT, I found differences in population and government
codes, some can be explained, but others are too dissimilar.
For example, Darrian (0627) has in BH a Population of 2100000 when in CT
and MT the Pop code is 9 (~2billion). I suppose that this is an errata,
nobody has reported a minor Maghiz or a disaster of similar
characteristics, but I am finding too much differences.

Are they changes in the Classic Canon or simply a lot of errata?
If they are errata, anybody has the list of errata of BH?
There is any reason to not include the info about the number of Gas
Giants and planetoid belts?

Another Questions,
Anybody has converted the stats of the VRF Gauss for the GURPS system?

What do you think of the problems to trade between Darrian, Sword
Worlds, and Imperial Frontiers? My players will play with a FarTrader
with this idea.

In GURPS Traveller, What happens with the costs of Life support
systems?, Are they free now?

That\'s why I *much* prefer Andre Norton\'s "Forerunners". It\'s a
*generic* term for any civilation that disappeared before the oldest
surviving civilization. And there are *hudreds* of more or less "known"
Forerunner cultures, and it\'s thought that there are likely 10s or even
hundreds of thousands of such cultures.

Well, since the late 70s, it\'s been known that Pluto has a moon that\'s
almost as big as it is. Which explains some of the density anomalies.
The old calculations were based on an incorrect diameter. 

Also, it\'s been known since the 40s (or earlier) that Pluto just plain
didn\'t have the mass to be the source of the orbital perturbations that
had been used in settuping up the search that found it. In essence, it
was a *co-incidence* that Pluto was in the search area. 

Now as for your odd version of Pluto, nothing *chemical* will work.
It\'s too cold for any chemical reaction to proceed all that fast. So
probes *couldn\'t* be converted all that fast. 

There are some exotic particles that could produce interesting effects.
For example, there\'s a property called "strangeness" that\'s not found
in normal matter. But if a particle with a strange "charge" was to get
dumped into a large chunk of normal matter, under some circumstances,
more strange particles can be produced. The end result would be a
macroscopic chunk of "strange matter". 

You\'ll have to do some literature searches for the hypothesized
properties of large chunks of strange matter, but they might just let
you do something interesting with Pluto.

Explosions are easily explained, since strange matter could act as a
catalyst for various sorts of nuclear reactions.

    'body' => 'There is a lot of confusion over what IR and thermal imaging really
are. That\'s because nobody really agrees on what the terms themselves
mean. IR is just an abbreviation for infra-red. The infra-red band
begins at the end of the visible spectrum (near-IR), which is around
800 nm, and extends all the way out to 25 000 nm or so (far-IR).
Common usage is that middle- and far-IR are called thermal.

The US military currently has systems that work in the near-IR bands,
as well as middle-IR and far-IR. The near-IR are all image
intensifiers. They take incoming "light" and amplify it so that you
can see images. This is what the starlight scopes are. (Actually these
devices work in the visible and near-IR range. The aviators have a
special version that filters out the lower end of the visible
spectrum, the blues and greens, to allow them to use the goggles in
specially lit cockpits.) Example: ANVIS (Aviator\'s Night Vision System).

The middle-IR devices are typically man-portable and use uncooled
technology to detect thermal radiation (often in the 3-5 000 nm
range). The detector works by displaying the intensities on some kind
of screen. The display is always in greyscale (since you don\'t have
any discrimination between wavelengths that you would need to get
color [not that it would be very meaningful to us anyway]) and can
(often) be switched between "white-hot" and "black-hot". These systems
are usually the smallest and have the shortest range (<< 1 km) but
fewest logistic requirements. Example: SRTS (Short Range Thermal Sight).

The far-IR devices are typically vehicle mounted and use a cooled
detector technology to detect thermal radiation (often in the 8-12 000
nm range). These devices usually have a longer range (>1 km) but
require extra power, "air bottles" (the coolant), or both. It also
works as either a "white-hot" or "black-hot" intensity based system.
Example: TIS (Thermal Imaging System on M1A1 tank).

When you see color images, the color is a "false color" that is used
to (hopefully) enhance your understanding of the image. For example,
an insulation salesman may show you a picture of your building with
blues for cold spots and reds for hot spots. What is not readily
apparent is what temperature counts as cold and what for hot!

(I hope my examples are still current--it\'s been a few years since I
did this stuff.)

GT:BTC has some interesting info on this  subject  re  the  Sword
Worlds.  It states (p127) that pre-5FW the Imperium had  tried  a
succession of "punitive occupations".  Then at the end of the 5FW
they tried setting up the Border Worlds (a  puppet  state  buffer
zone) with questionable success.  Okay, this wasn\'t a  suppressed
rebellion but it does illustrate the Imperial  mindset  on  Iraq-
like intractable problems.

Then there was the heavy-handed  military  response  to  the  Ine
Givar on Efate just prior to the 5FW.  The Imperium\'s  equivalent
to the US\'s Viet Nam situation?

Finally, there are references (in CT) to \'gunboat diplomacy\'  ...
as if such things are the norm.

The Imperium seems to exhibit a degree of arrogance in seeing its
military superiority as a simple solution  to  all  things.  Thus
many social problems would be  repressed  rather  than  resolved.
This may have been a large part of what Dulinor wanted to change,
and why (in non-GT) the Imperium fell apart so quickly  once  the
might of the Imperial Navy became neutralised.

Bruce is absolutely right.  I haven\'t seen the Washington films, but did
see Patriot Games. 
The footage in Patriot Games is legit, but remember that the scene is in
the middle of a desert (cold) at night (cold) and the subjects (hot) are
inside just GP medium tents.  In other words, no real barrier to the IR
sat picture.  And the resolution isn\'t that great, just as Bruce said,
people\'s locations....

And the outdoor stuff?  What we can do is incredible....

I\'ve been very impressed with the recent trend in the Texas Revolts 
threads.  Many of the list have brought the discussion into ObTrav 
terms, and presented some interesting ideas on Secessionist style 
campaigns on the borders of the 3I (mostly in Spinward Marches.)

However, several other threads have started from this thread, and are 
now covering richly diverse subjects.  In order to better meet the 
needs of those who are (or possibly are not) interested in some of 
these divergences, would everyone consider changing the subject 
ling of any Texas Revolts post they are responding to, to something 
more appropriate to the subject matter at hand?  In this way, 
discussions might be more easily followed by those whose curiosity 
has been raised by that particular subject matter.

BTW, thanks to everyone who has been so supportive of my "hometown 
pride" within the TFCT, and those who have challenged it with 
constructive support behind their posts.  It is the strength and 
validity of the supporting details that help to sway me in making 
appropriate changes to the timeline or revealing some of my 
campaign\'s "spoiler" background.  A well-written post backed by 
supportive details does change minds, and I\'m glad to see that a vast 
majority of the respondants on this list follow this approach.

Again, thanks to everyone who has responded, both on the list and 
off.  Your input has helped me to make the concepts behind my 
campaign\'s timeline much stronger, and has opened my eyes to a 
broader viewpoint as I learn from the unique knowledges each of you 
possess and offer to the list as a whole.

In Service and Appreciation,
Jason

PS  Also, as far as Pluto is concerned, my mind has been changed by 
the presentation of various individuals on the list.  I like the 
individual gravesites of 30 humans buried 300,000 years ago.  
Researched by Terran archeologists during the early to mid IW period, 
it was soon forgotten until the early 3I era.  The Solomani begin 
doing advanced research on Pluto, and after the 3I take the Sol 
System back, they interdict the area and continue to build on the 
research lines followed by the Solomani.  This seems to make the most 
sense and ties in well with most canonical sources.  (And it\'s not 
another Ancient site.  :) -JDK

Clif,

I\'m sure he meant that these are subjects on which many people feel
strongly, and discussions on these will degenerate into shouting matches
without any additional value to the Traveller discussions ongoing.  Or
at least that the hard feelings outweigh any benefit to the Traveller
discussions.

Prudence dictates that on the norm, we not discuss things on-line that
cause angry and bitter discussions.

Cheers.

Yup.  And we all wear Stetson hats, snakeskin boots, and carry lassos and
whips, and drive cattle from one part of the ponderosa to the other, and
shoot people with our Colt Revolvers or Winchester Rifles.  Get along,
little doggie.  Yee haw!

I gave a textbook example of hometown pride?  Well, hellfire and tarnation,
pardner!  I don\'t think my comments were pro-texas, as opposed to other
states.  Texas was the focus of the discussion that, as you correctly point
out, I didn\'t start.  My comments were in that context.  If it were Oregon,
my comment might well have been:

Talk less, read more, pard.  The point applies equally well to Oregon.
You\'re looking for disagreements where there are none.  The point,
in case your still missing it, is that _any_ secessionary state will likely have
a large pool of supportive natives integrated into the political/military
infrastructure of any oppressive government, attempting to prevent
a seccssion.  Those ex-residents could easily hamper efforts of the
oppressive government.

Is that sufficiently abstract for you?  Pardon me for staying in context.

So?  Lots of people group lots of other people into inaccurate stereotypes
all the time.  I\'m not sure who you\'re insulting more: Texans, Quebecois, or
your self.

That was more of a spark.  You can\'t cook no barbeque with that.

Well, from what I hear, millimeter wave radar should be able to do much
the same thing. Give decent images thru typical house walls. But I
agree that IR won\'t do it. And millimeter wave radar is *active* rather
than passive, making it a much iffier proposition in a combat situation.

TNE used the GDW house system which was the T2K engine, slightly
modified and updated.  Not the original T2K, but the d20 verson of T2K.

The House Rules system was used in Cadillac\'s and Dino\'s, Dark
Conspiracy, TNE and T2K.  All the weapons, equipments and characters are
completely interchangable between these various games.

2300, originally published as 2300AD used a rule set most people likened
to MT in design but still quite different and original.  Many of the
ideas in Star Cruiser, the starship combat system of 2300 found their
way into Brilliant Lances, the starship combat system for TNE.  These
would include things like, detection phases, x-ray detonation lasers,
and sensor white-out from nuclear detonations.

Not to mention the complete removal of contact missiles in a starship
combat arena, you\'re firing at something 30 meter\'s long from 180,000 km
away, it\'s moving, you\'re moving and you\'re missile only has so much
fuel and manouvering ablitity do you honestly think you have a hope in
hell of actually hitting the target.

All in all the TNE rules system works nicer and doesn\'t rely on 1/2
d6\'s, let me get out my ginsu knife, you can cut a d6 with it.

There was a screw-up in email between MJ Dougherty and Neil Frier in
Britain and Loren Wiseman in Austin during the (very tight) production of
BtC, with the result that much of what you see is essentially a first
draft, without extensive error checking.

SJ Games maintains an official errata page, at:

http://www.sjgames.com/errata/gurps/traveller-behind-the-claw.html

but there isn\'t a lot listed there yet. I don\'t know if there are more
errata working their way through the system or not.

Languages, customs, Customs, and psychology -- those are your big problems.
 Make sure your characters have the right set of social and professional
skills to wend their way through all the attendant red tape.

If you feel like it, you can also make different industrial standards a
hurdle to cross-border trade (e.g., the Zhodani will not use 110/220vAC
current at 60 Hz, or metric measurements, for their industrial machinery).

Essentially yes, although the food produced by the life support system
isn\'t all that appetizing. Use the costs for restaurant meals in GURPS
Space (p. 37; Cr 5 to 40 per meal) as a base for costs of fresh food, then
discount as appropriate (80%) for buying in bulk and fixing them yourself.

The port fee in GT was increased in part to compensate for reduced life
support costs (i.e., it includes filter changes and such).

    'body' => 'To All Interested Vilani Enthusiasts and Geerheads,

In Phase Two of Project: StarRise (my First Contact campaign), I am 
intending on running the PCs through a short tour of duty aboard a 
Vilani Scout/Exploration Vessel, as part of a mixed Terran/Vilani 
crew.  This allows me to pursue an exploration style game with some 
of the cultural integration opportunities found in the early 
ST:Voyager episodes.  (Good roleplay!)

This type of mixed crew mission is mentioned in canon; such 
references are the source for this phase of the campaign.  While such 
an occurence doesn\'t quite fit what we\'ve known of the Vilani 
mindset before Terran contact, I\'m trying to find a way to make it 
work as a source of adventure for my PCs.

I assume that the Ziru Sirka has a variety (albeit small) of 
exploration vessels used in it\'s rare moments of expansion.  I am 
looking for details regarding such vessels.  If none have been 
detailed, I would be very interested in seeing what suggestions 
anyone had for their construction, and possible even a few examples.  
(The system used to construct the vessel(s) does not matter so much 
to me, as I will be translating the results into HERO System format, 
due to Gamer Psych Lims.)

I do know that the following restrictions apply:

1)  The vessel(s) should be of TL11 (that\'s Traveller, not GURPS.  I
don\'t have my GT book with me to translate.  My apologies.) 

2)  The vessel(s) should be able to hold enough crew for 3-6 PCs, and 
at least 3-6 NPCs, if not more.

3)  Flattened disk hull design is prevalent in Vilani designs.

4)  If armed, the Vilani preference at the time was missiles 
predominately.

5)  Crew complement must include a Steward (Shuligii) to prepare 
Vilani meals.

6)  Vilani designs tend to be larger than those used by Terrans.  
(i.e. the common merchant vessel of the Ziru Sirka more closely 
resembled the subsidized merchant than the free trader of CT).

Crew Member Question:

Besides Vilani, are there any suggested Minor Races that might have a 
crew member represented onboard the exploration vessel?

I have plans of including a Vegan, but there are no other canonical
minor races of the Solomani Rim (not including the Cymbelline
Chips (sp?)).  I\'d like to give my PCs other opportunities to meet 
new races, and would prefer to use canon sources before diving into 
Minor Races of my own creation.  Maybe I can dig some 
interesting races from Alien Archives.  I\'m sure there are some 
interesting races in old JTAS articles, etc, who have been part of 
the Ziru Sirka before First Contact.

This campaign is an introduction to Traveller for most of the
players, and I want to "raise \'em right."  :)

Thanks in advance for any assistance granted.

Well, this is probably going to restart the semi-Annual US 2nd Amendment
argument, but it DOES have some very interesting Traveller implications.

First - for the USA side of things (and perhaps more generally), my
response would be \'What is the inherent difference if I am killed by the
5th round in a 10-round magazine or the 15th round in a 20-round magazine?
Why is there a general assumption that I, as the owner of a semi-auto
weapon, am out to gun down several dozen school children or postal workers?
The 10-round limit is yet another \'feel good\' government measure that
accomplishes nothing, but makes people THINK the government is doing
something meaningful.  Western Civilization, particularly the USA, has a
tradition of assuming innocence until guilt is proven,  The only exception
to this seems to involve firearms; it seem to be automatically assumed that
firearms owners are guilty of at least wanting to murder someone.

Now, the real actual On Topic part of the discussion.  A large portion of
the Traveller rules are taken up with rules for combat and weapons use, as
well as a sizable set of weapons statistics.  Based on experience and
first-hand observation, I have found the typical Traveller player to be
pretty well-armed; how many of you can claim their character party has NO
firearms/lasers/non-melee weapons?  I am sure some can make this claim, but
the majority cannot.  Tis is reflected by (or is a reflection of) a lot of
the published Traveller adventures; folks in Traveller society tend to be
well-heeled in the weapons department.  There are actual reasons in
Traveller to have these weapons; the Traveller Universe is NOT a friendly
place.  You have Zho Infiltrators, SolSec Agents, IneGivar Terrorists,
Pirates, Bandits, Oppresive Governments, Corrupt Corporations and other
things that occasionally require weapons to get around.  Toss in the
occasional unfriendly alien critter (sentient or otherwise) and the odd
leftover Ancient Warbot, and it quickly becomes apparent that the Traveller
Universe is armed for a reason.

However, there are many worlds that strongly restrict weapons.  These
worlds have bee unpopular with Travellers in my experience (high law levels
are not only a problem for weapons-toters, they are also uncomfortable for
everyone else).  The Imperium does not seem to take any direct position on
private weapons ownership, but probably does not allow folks to carry
around backpack nukes and meson weapons, and I imagine there are some
rather stringent safeguards on FGMPs.

So, how does the Traveller Universe feel about these well-armed Travellers?
On High-Law worlds, these folks tend to keep their arsenal in the extrality
zone of the Starport, I imagine.  But how many times has a character in
your game smuggled an illegal weapon onto a high or medium law world \'just
in case\'.  And how many times did that weapon turn out to be needed?  In my
experience as a player, GM and observer of others\' games, this has happened
quite often, and is also quite often the thing that saves the party from
certain death.  The GM often expects this, and plans on using it as part of
the adventure.  The players might get caught, or the players might face a
foe that requires a weapon for an easy escape.

So - in the Traveller Universe, are there Imperium-wide organizations like
Handgun Control out there trying to get Imperial laws restricting weapons?
Is there a social stigma for those who own weapons, or carry weapons
openly.  Does the Imperial media portray weapons as inherently good,
inherently evil or merely as tools?  Are there any Imperium-wide weapons
manufacturers (personal weapons), or are these generally built by local
companies (using Imperial standard designs for military contracts).  Does
the Imperium exercise exclusive control of FGMPs and PGMPSs?  Which
immediatey begs the question Is there a thriving black market in PGMPs and
FGMPs?  And finally, what sort of restrictions are there on explosives?
Not only bombs and hand grenades, but HEAP rounds for hand-held weapons;
these are by definition also explosives.\\

IMTU - there is no Imperial-level Handgun Control movement; this is handled
at the planetary level.  However, the Imperium does in thoery hold
exclusive control of PGMPs and FGMPs, and yes there is a black market in
these weapons.  HEAP rounds are explosives, and so are covered by the Law
Level restrictions.  The Imperial media (unlike the modern media) views
weapons as tools, neither inherently good not evil.  Some Imperial
megacorps DO make weapons, but most weapons are made by smaller local
companies, using standardized Imperial designs when selling to Imperial or
Planetary miilitaries.  The Imperials have standard designs for planetary
militaries as well, just in case the local army has to be pressed into
Imperial service; makes logistics less cumbersome if you know all TL9
troops will use the 4.75mm Assault Rifle round and the 38mm RAM Grenade.

Sorry for the long post, but I have noticed that for all of the firearms
laws flame wars we have had, we have never really gotten into the Traveller
implications of this subject.  Please think about this and respond about
your ideas about weapons necessity, laws and ethics in the Traveller
Imperium.  Try to avoid the very tempting flame war aspects.  And of course
remember that anyone who disagrees with MY opinions about weapons laws is
OBVIOUSLY wrong.  ;-)

I guess in some ways yes, and in other ways no.

I\'m not sure if you\'ve seen GT or not, but the basic rulebook is pretty
heavy on art. On the other hand, it\'s pretty heavy on rules and text combat.
To me, it\'s a very happy medium.

The market has changed though. If the next version of Traveller is to
survive (or even thrive) the designers have to realize who the modern market
is comprised of.

Personally, I\'d love to see new players brought into the Traveller fold. The
success of GURPS Traveller is heartening in a big way. However, from my
reading the message boards on Pyramid, it seems that many of the GT players
were either people who played Traveller extensively, people who checked it
out because of the SJG hype around it, and people who have roleplayed for a
long time and had already heard good things about Trav but never played it.

It\'s a shot in the arm, but only time will tell if Traveller can get the
attention of fresh, new players.

  Just IMO of course, but the best White Wolf products (for example) don\'t
really sacrifice content for artwork. In their best books both atrwork
_and_ text are excellent. True, there are some really lousy ones, but then
I have yet to see an RPG product line that didin\'t have these.

Because thermal imaging does infact involve detection of infrared photons.
The problem is that the word "infrared" is used in a very sloppy sense. 
Many people use "infrared" to describe any photons with wavelengths longer
than the longest your eye can see (0.8 microns) out to just-short-of-microwaves
(0.1 millimeters, 100 microns.) All of these are technically infrared.
A lot of relatively simple detectors - including camcorders, many sorts of
starlight scopes - are sensitive out to about 1 micron, so they can technically
see a tiny bit of infrared, assuming there is 0.8 - 1 micron light
available. 

If you want to see objects by their own radiation, though, you need something
better. Warm (room-temperature) objects give off most of their radiation
at infrared wavelengths around 10-20 microns, so you need a very different
kind of infrared detector to image objects from the radiation they emit, which
is what is normally called "thermal imaging". 

More precise terminology might be to refer to the following ranges:

Near infrared (0.8 - 1.6 microns): very easy to detect (especially below
1 micron), but only "sees" things being illuminated by ane xternal light
source (like a flashlight with an IR filter.) 

Mid Infrared (3-5 microns): You can get really nice mid-IR cameras for about
$25,000 these days. This can "see" objects by their own thermal radiation,
letting you see warm bodies, etc, although it\'s not quite as good for
cold metal objects (like, to drag this back to Traveller, spacecraft hulls.)

Thermal Infrared (10-20 microns): More expensive/complicated, better
sensitivity to cold objects 


The question of whether the display you see is color or black-and-white
is completely seperate from the wavelength used; that\'s just a matter of
image processing - whether "bright" is assigned to "white" or "red". 

Thermal IR is often more sensitive to subtle temperature differences at
room temperature, but not by much. A nice mid-IR camera (I\'ve worked with
these quite a bit) can see blood vessels in your face, and see warm spots
on something that a person has been handling for a minute or two afterwards.

Great, so the Imperium Games disease hits Steve Jackson Games as well.

Isn\'t anyone in the RPG industry capable of telling dick-head
accountants and managers that it will be finished when it\'s finished,
and that they _won\'t_ be allowing the company to release the product
until it\'s properly tested ?

Surely no-one was really relying on getting "Behind The Claw" exactly
on time and a couple of weeks, or even months, delay in production
wouldn\'t have bothered anyone who wanted to buy it ?

I really don\'t understand game companies or the people who work for
them.

Firstly, how can a game company stick to a ridiculously tight release
schedule, when there is no need for such a schedule in the first
place, and secondly, how can any professional (and I\'ll admit I\'m
being "nice" by including game designers/writers as "professionals" )
allow a product to be released with their name on it that hasn\'t had
rudimentary checking ?

Or has no-one in the game industry got the guts to stand up to idiots
?

Not really - most thermal imagers detect only brightness at a single
wavelength and use post-processing to convert that into a temperature estimate.
The real difference is whether you\'re using something that\'s only sensitive
to 1 micron but has been marketed as "infrared" by unscrupulous people, or 
something sensitive to the longer IR wavelengths that warm objects give off.

Most fights between humans are charisma battles.  Everybody remember
grade/high school?  "I\'m going to kick your ass/kill you/etc,.  Nobody
really got hurt, but the winners standing among his peers soared.  Maybe
Craig can tell you about the day he had his alpha moment.  :)

In Infantry OSUT, we had to unlearn those instincts, since we had to kill
our opponents.  It was more difficult than you might think.  We have a
culture that values violence as long as it doesn\'t get out of hand (think
about the popular sports.. boxing, American rules football, real football,
rugby).  We value the concept of an Alpha leading our pack to the fore.  A
Vargr would want a more personal relationship with the alpha.  A Vargr
might find my devotion to the 49ers silly, since the Denver Broncos are
obviously the better leaders, and even then I\'ve never met the leader of
the 49ers, so how can I be impressed by him?

That being said, I think the Vargr military might be more efficient than
the average Imperial unit.  Like the pirates of old, leadership posts would
be held based on crew confidence.  A leader who loses the confidence of his
followers is going to be challenged and replaced.  So every squad leader is
going to have the complete confidence of his squad, and late leader is
going to have confidence in his platoon leader, and so on up the chain.

Urp.  Ramming at Traveller velocities is a good way to turn you and your
enemies into rapidly expanding balls of plasma.  also, since most sensor
will find ships out to almost 1 million km, sneaking up isn\'t an option.
Aslan males would want to be seen fighting, to increase their chances of
being in the clan\'s Song of Heroes.

While the Vargr do have a pack mentality, remember that they are
intelligent.  A Vargr could easily be trained to act as a sniper, and wait
in perfect silence to attack a single high value target.. the same way that
a group of drunken Aslan could charge a single target howling at the top of
their lungs.

There is a problem in ascribing to much from the Aslan/Vargr base creatures
to the aliens themselves.. The Aslan are not big kitties, and the Vargr may
have been wolves at one point, but now they are a fully sentient race.  Or
to put it another way, we\'re primates, but I don\'t know of any battle in
World War II where the opposite sides stood up, screamed, waved their arms
and flung feces at each other, which is how chimps make war.  You can see
that sort of display behavior in humans, but it has changed.

Perhaps the Aslan, descended from chasers, have a taste for pursuit
operations, and tend to see things from a black and white chaser/chased
position.  Considering their culture, they have a strong surrender reflex
(ever watch cats fight?) and Aslan who had never fought humans would but
completely un aware that somebody could fake a surrender.  Vargr do tend to
gravitate into packs, but that doesn\'t mean they won\'t use the best tactics
available when they do fight.

IIRC, T2K second edition came first, then the same system was used for
Cadillacs and Dinosaurs, Dark Conspiracy, and finally TNE.  I clearly
remember being excited that I could use my DC and T2K books with Traveller.

T2K v.2.2 brought T2K in line with the d20 system, but the base game
mechanic was well established.

[pause] there.

[snip]

>So - in the Traveller Universe, are there Imperium-wide organizations like

IMTU there are several...dozen.  All claim to be "Imperium Wide", most have
a concentration of employees and sponsors on one high pop world and a
scattering in the nearby region...and almost no measurable presence
anywhere else.  None are listened to by the Imperial Goverment on Capital
since they leave these things up to local governments and try not to get
involved.

>Is there a social stigma for those who own weapons, or carry weapons

This varies so widely from place to place there can be no real answer.
Even in the U.S. (never mind the rest of the planet) in Boston I\'d be
arrested for carrying a gun on general principles, licensed or not.  In
Alaska there are some places where only a fool would go out without a hefty
weapon for bear protection, and I once read that there is, in fact, a law
against camping in some areas of Alaske without a gun handy.

No, gun mores must vary from place to place.

That said, there may be "regional" standards of behavior for any type of
activity (guns, sex, clothes, language), especially around high-pop worlds
which are probably the source of many of the nearby planets\' inhabitants,
or at least their mainstream entertainment vids.

>  Are there any Imperium-wide weapons

Yes.

Yes.

>Does
>the Imperium exercise exclusive control of FGMPs and PGMPSs?

No, but IMTU you need to get an Imperial Permit for military grade weapons,
unless they are transported as cargo (i.e. in sealed containers).  such
permits are generally intended for mercenaries, and are obtained from the
Imperial Authority in the area (That is, the local nobility or a ranking
Naval officer where no nobles are in residence).  Having such a permit does
not mean free reign to blow things away, but it does tend to keep pesky
local customs folk from confiscating that nice grenade launcher you picked
up.

The permit itself ranges from a scrawled signature on a hand written note
saying "This guy may carry what he wants" to a formal document listing
eachand every weapon and its ammunition loadout.  Enforcement varies just
as widely, and someone with the former permit may find it inadequate in a
space controlled by an authority which issues the latter.  Barring serious
destruction, however, most authorities would limit their penalizing to
confiscation and destruction of unauthorized weapons.

>  Which

Of course.

>these are by definition also explosives.\\

Dont forget TNT, nitroglycerine, ammonium nitrate, tritium, gasoline, etc
etc.  Generally, weapons are restricted if they can be called "Military
Grade".  This varies somewhat, but the line is generally drawn at fully
automatic slug throwers larger than 7mm, vehicle mounted semi-automatic
cannon larger than 40mm, Any fusion or plasma weapons, and anything like
artillery.  Note that this gives Imperial citizenry the authority to own
single shot rocket propelled grenades, direct fire rocket launchers,
handheld lasers of any type, hand grenades, large caliber rifles (remember
the "crunch gun?"), mount a 35mm cannon on the ATV, and many other
permutations.  This is mainly because the Imperium is stilll a wild place
in some areas and such weapons are needed to "tame" the local wildlife
frequently.  Note that the rules change for starship mounted weapons.

Explosives are another story entirely.  Aside from restrictions on weapons
of mass destruction - which is taken very seriously IMTU - there are very
few Imperial restrictions on what you can carry around that goes "Boom".
Someone carrying tritium or enriched uranium would be scrutinized, but as
soon as the records showing their history of building fission power plants
is produced, they will be unmolested.

One theme runs through my campaign.  The Imperium is not a consistent
place, and you may find things very different at the next port of call.

Aside from political issues - flying RTGs to Saturn is hard enough,
flying a full-fledged reactor in LEO would be painful - reactors don\'t actually
buy you all *that* much in power-to-weight over solar in earth orbit, 
particularly for a manned mission (which would need lots of shielding) and 
a very long duration one (20 years or so for the Station, so you\'d need
replacement reactors or cores.) There\'s also (legitimate) worry about 
the effects of inadequately-shielded reactors on sensitive gamma-ray
telescopes in nearby orbits...

I\'m not aware of any railguns currently outside of laboratories or test
benches, and I\'d like to see a citation...there are artists conceptions and
Army wouldn\'t-it-be-nice-if sketches, but such things really are still 
at the viewgraph stage.

Sort-of true, but the lasers that are proposed for orbital use these days
are generally chemical lasers (which have better efficiencies and use
storeable fuel rather than electrical energy), and are operating at power
levels appropriate for thin-skinned missiles, not anti-tank.

Planning in the sense of "science fiction", not "current/plausible military

Because of the memories of that satellite disintegrating over Canada a
while back. Hell, NASA has enough trouble launching reactors on
interstellar probes, much less sticking a _bigger_ one in orbit, LEO at
that.

The is no political will to do that, and as we\'re finding by discussion

Aslan might put more value on active sensors, then...and maybe on ships
custom-tuning the precise frequency of their lasers, so that you can
tell whose laser fire hits a given target.

If you need 30 rounds to defend yourself..

BTW:  In the Army I served in, my rifle was locked behind two heavy doors,
could only be issued to me on an order from an officer, and any live ammo
had to be accounted for to every last piece.  I once was grilled for two
hours because a single round of 5.56mm had been found under my bunk (never
mind that my weapon was a 7.62mm.)  There is a world of difference between
the weapons policies of the armed Forces and being a civilian weapons owner.

Some points to consider about the Aslan Ihatei incursion into the Domain of
Deneb in 1118:  (All of this is IMTU)

1) With all the naval bases in Tobia and Pax Rulin Subsectors the Aslan
should not have been able to advance as they did if the fleet was at full
strength.  The solution I used IMTU was two fold - firstly, after the fifth
frontier war the old \'crust\' strategy (of defending every Imperial world)
was revamped into a more flexible reserve interior fleets strategy -
meaning less frontline ships were available to meet the initial Aslan
advance.  Secondly what frontline ships there were had been ordered by
Norris in early 1118 to move coreward to counter Zhodani threat and Vargr
action.  This left Trojan Reach \'in the capable hands of the reserve
fleets\'.  IMTU this is a mistake of Norris (he underestimated the Aslan
\'pressure\') but to be fair he had many holes in the dyke to fill and only
limited fingers...

2) IMTU Reserve fleets are maintained by individual worlds (and are more
akin to colonial fleets).  This means that there are really only four
capable reserve fleets in Trojan Reach - Tobia, Albe, Neumann and Perrior
(unless I missed one those are the high pop, average stellar worlds).  In
between these worlds are tens of low pop, low tech (or both) worlds which
can be subjugated by one Aslan colony ship - let alone an Aslan Cruiser.

3) An economic analysis shows that a world like Tobia should have plenty of
reserve fleet capacity to defend its subsector (Hans? I believe this is
your cue...:).  IMTU the reason the Aslan can overcome Tobia subsector is:
1) A critical mass of Aslan Ihatei had been building for some time to
Rimward, kept in check by the \'Fleet Controller\' with their colonists in
low berth - waiting for an appropriate world to colonise.  In early 1118
this flood is released into Imperial space.  2) Duke Andrew(?) of Tobia
(and senior sector Duke) kept his fleet around Tobia to protect against an
attack there rather than defending outliying worlds.  The attack on Tobia
only did come after he reversed this policy in late 1118 and began trying
to expel Aslan from their \'homes\'.  Duke Andrew\'s other mistake was to
treat all Aslan as the same (thus uniting them) rather than dealing with
each clan individually and keeping them fragmented.  Tobia is attacked
while most of its fleet is spread among several other worlds by a united
Aslan Battle Fleet.  (Duke Tobia committed suicide as the first Aslan drop
troops landed on Tobia).  IMTU The Aslan invasion pretty much runs out of
steam in mid-1119 when the number of new fleets entering Imperial space
lessens and the new sector Duke at Gazulin begins turning clans against
each other.

4) IMTU each Aslan fleet is a separate entity, out for its own ends.  The
reason the Aslan advance so fast is that they don\'t take time to conquer,
or secure each world, but each fleet advances until it finds a suitable
world, unclaimed by another Aslan clan, and stops.  This inevitably means
that the low pop, low tech (ie defenseless) worlds are taken first, leaving
small islands of high pop, high tech worlds which can only be taken (later,
in 1119) by alliances of clans.

You might be interested in my timeline for the Aslan Invasion (at least up
until mid-1118 when I had decided there was to be a large fleet battle in
Pax Rulin subsector - but my players don\'t know that yet).  It can be found
as a series of TNS articles for my campaign at:

The ninja clans of the Iga Province might disagree, thought they WERE of the
belief that a successful mission was one where you left no trace of your
ever having been there.

But because the Iga-mono were not as well armored and well-equipped as the
Samurai, stealth was their means of survival and of evening the odds.  They
didn\'t wear black for nothing.

Would it?  Has anyone playtested these "strategies" and wouldn\'t a "morale

go out the window, since psyches are still a major factor in high TL
battles?

How about some kind of beam that made a "speaker" out of all of the solids
of the ship, so that everyone on the ship would hear the howl surrounding
them?  Like a backwards Laser microphone?  Instead of reading the vibrations
of a solid to "listen" it could MAKE vibrations in a solid to "speak"...

Why does technological evolution have to occur in parallels?  Couldn\'t the
Vargr have non-game-imbalancing technologies that the humanoids don\'t yet
understand?  Only if your players were a bunch of Vargr "on the inside"
would you have to come up with some kind of explanation for the technology.

Military textbooks had the common attack stategy of communist forces down to
 a diagram(punch a hole through the center of the perimeter and fight your
way out while another part of your force flanks, I believe it was).  Knowing
the strategy didn\'t make them any less of a threat.

Remember "Maverick" in "Top Gun"?  Goddess Kelly McGillis tried to teach him
to follow NATO strategy but he, instead, lived up to his name.  He was just
an individual playing the cowboy.  The majority follows the standard
strategy.

The thuds and booms of artillery and tank rounds makes for good
chest-beating and suppressed forces often yelled at each other.

Some dogs are already smart.  Vargr would be much smarter dogs.

How many are familiar with the Kafer in 2300 AD?  They basically acted like
Roaches (after which they were named, in the German).  Slow, at first, until
you threatened them.  THEN the battle would get intense!  (Not that little
ol\' Roaches try to fight off a human...)

Whether this is fully accurate or not(I think that it is probably not the
best analogy), Kafer had a "strategy" that had to be learned.  They rarely
broke out of this "strategy".  Now, it might be argued that Kafer aren\'t
"sentient" during the first few rounds of combat...

By the way, is 2300 AD supposed to be a limited portion of Traveller
history?  If so, does Traveller history officially mention and explain what
happened to the Kafer?

Maybe they could make a comeback?  "We need a few good aliens."  Instead,
the heavens are raining cats and dogs.  Maybe some aliens like the one in
the two "Species" movies?  ;)

Right. There are two principle night-vision technologies: Thermal
imagers; and light-intensification units.

Light intensification units work by significantly amplifying the low-
level available light at night. This can be moonlight; starlight;
artificial light reflected of clouds; whatever. They tend to `whine\' due
to the nature of the electronics used. They are typically configured to
give a monochrome (green) image.

Thermal imaging systems work by detecting infra-red radiation (heat
radiation) emitted from the targets. They are now sensitive enough to
pick up a human body; a smear of hot rubber from a car tyre on tarmac;
etc. All but the newest are cooled by gas; giving them a limited
operating time. The gas compressor emits a low, droning noise. They are
typically configured to give a grayscale image; although some units use
a false-colour map to give the `Hollywood special\' pictures everyone
expects.

Individual weapon and personal night sights tend to be LI units; vehicle
mounted units and search-and-rescue gear tends to be TI.

Hmm, you may be on to something there...  I couldn\'t help but laugh when
some silly show was on and some standardly armed Army soldiers faced down a
bunch of pistol-shooters at point black range who jumped into the back of a
deus and a half type truck...  The pistoleros did better than the same
number of Army soldiers.

What crap!  Up to 50 meters, if not more, I could drop EVERYONE, provided I
didn\'t get shot first.

It depends on the spin they put on it.. The Texas leadership can run to the
UN saying "Look at these hypocrites!  They supported Bosnia and Kosovo, and
even Eiteria, but when we want to peacefully sever ties, they attack us!
We reserve the right to defend ourselves!"  Then make sure that the BBC has
excellent support in covering every attack made by the US.  Watch world
opinion turn against the US aggression.  Watch several countries recognize
the Republic of Texas, especially after a few backroom deals concerning oil
are made.

They might well consider passive locks to be a "lesser" victory, given the
code duello the Aslan live under.  I can see Aslan ships doing the samurai
declaration of honor as they cruise to engagement range.

This of course a cultural thing, and has little to do with their
evolutionary roots.  We are descended from shit-flinging primates, and have
developed an amazing variety of methods for combat etiquette.

on that world as unarmed (or poorly armed) as well. 

I suspect this is a matter of group preference more than anything else. My
groups have never been fond of running combats, and so we tend to avoid
them - especially lethal ones. (Well, my groups once I graduated high
school!) I know of other groups where rolling a new character is a common
occurence - and I don\'t play with them because of that.

OTOH, my players used their wits, and thus couldn\'t be totally unarmed
short of a lobotomy.

	Our group normally gms in a round robin format, so we all run the
game at one point.  As background I setup a Marine who served 8 terms.
(Forced to serve the 8th and did 4 combat missions. He went to commando
school early in his career and served ~80% combat missions according to
the old lbb marine book.  We encountered a extreme law level world that
did not even allow knives.  We being players decided the evil GM was out
to get us without our weapons.  I found a WONDERFUL method of getting a
sword past customs in a LEGAL manner.  My marine general (ret) put on his
full dress uniform.  In our campaign the dress uniform for a marine calls
for a saber.  Walks to starport gate.  Guards into planet proper throw
fit.  BIG argument ensued.  The locals insisted he could not wear the
sword.   He insisted he HAD to wear the sword or not be in uniform.  He
pointed out military personnel were entitled to wear their uniforms on
planet.  Pointed out (somewhat wrong but... <g>) people do not use swords
as a weapon in this day and age.  After about 2 hrs the guards found
someone willing to make the exception.  Nothing happened that required the
sword, but it did make an interesting precedent and a good chance for some
roleplaying.  This works (in our campaign because of the following
rulings)
	1) Marine dress uniform includes a saber.
	2) Retired military personnel are still entitled to wear the
           uniform.
	3) Local governments prefer to not annoy the imperial government.

	We do not have major weapons restrictions.  As long as people keep
it on their ship or store it in a bonded locker they are allowed to have
most man portable weapons and armor.  The BIG problem can be acquiring the
weapons in a legitimate manner.  It takes a lot of pull to acquire high
explosives or plasma weapons.  We have had characters muster out with a
PGMP if they had a reason to use one in service.  Very few people have
been allowed to buy one.  Our rule of thumb is don\'t do anything stupid
and you don\'t get squished.  Otherwise the Emperor will get annoyed.

In his excellent comic book "Buck Godot: Zap Gun for Hire", Phil Foglio has
two of the characters attacked by a ninja-like alien.  Grabbing Par, the
alien hisses "you will reveal the location of the Winslow, or I will FLOSS
HIS TEETH!"  to the general merriment of the victims.  As they laugh their
appendages off, the ninja sulks away muttering "well, that\'s a really big
threat where I come from."  You can\'t expect an alien attack to work on a
human.  You can\'t even translate cultural threats well.  For example, if
you see a woman dressed all in white wearing a veil, what do you think?  If
you are from a western culture, you probably think "she\'s a bride, how
nice."  If you are from many Asian cultures, you think "how sad, a close
family member has died and she\'s going to the funeral."

The Soviet battle doctrine was based on the German blitzkrieg which was
based on successful cavalry attacks from the Napoleonic Era.  It was more
of attack everywhere until you achieve breakthrough.  At that point, focus
all your reserves on that spot and exploit it.

You\'d probably get a better reaction if you didn\'t reference really awful
movies.. I\'ve known real Navy pilots who tell me that "Maverick" not only
would never have gotten an invite to Fightertown, but would have been
pulled from flight status within a month of reporting.  Real pilots are
professionals.

The difference is of course that 155mm HE shells can blow you into a fine
red mist.  Getting into someone\'s face and puffing up your chest cannot.  

>A classic scene is the V.C. on the wire in "Apocalypse Now".  "G.I.,

Once again, quoting the media isn\'t the best bet.  I was trained to shut up
and stay quiet, to the point where I let an "enemy" patrolman take a leak
on my back one night.  Despite my urge to move, or to leap up and beat the
crap out of this guy, I remembered the mission and tolerated it.  Never did
find out who did it...

No, Vargr are a sentient race.  We are not simply smart apes, we\'ve gone
far beyond that.  We have reactions that are tempered by intelligence,
since we do not simple react on instinct.  When my fight or flight reflex
is triggered, I have many more option than my primitive ancestors.

Uh, no.  The Kafers were named for the perceived resemblance to roaches.
The Kafers were a race that was of generally low intelligence until they
were threatened, then an analog to adrenaline would boost their brain
functions to allow quick reactions.  Cockroaches are speedy little buggers
that are always alert.  (I know, I lived in San Jose\'s answer to Joe\'s
Apartment for a year.)

Reread the "Invasion" supplement.  Some of the Kafer leadership tried
unorthodox tactics.

2300AD was based off the Twilight: 2000 history and is not an official part
of the Traveller/Third Imperium universe.

Gack!  "Species"?!

Aslan and Vargr are cats and dogs only if you play them that way.  A better
analogy would be samurai and Sioux.  Bringing the Kafer into Traveller
might be fun, but difficult to do.

I haven\'t been able to find the article, but my reference was in a
1986 or 1987 (yes, that long ago) edition of International Defense
Review. It showed two photographs of the weapon system, one of the two
support vehicles, the other of the gun in action, and a simple block
diagram of it\'s parts. This system was discussed as part of an article
on NATO\'s Air/Land Battle 2000 doctrine.

It\'s possible it may have been a "spoof" but the IDR people were
usually pretty good at detecting that sort of thing.

A current reference after a quick web search  shows a 30mm x 2.2m
version at http://www.utexas.edu/research/cem/rd/rd02/02.html
It says "Weighing a modest 385lb, this gun can be breech supported in
a tactical configuration".

It\'s possible this is the developers being optimistic, and the photo
on this site is of a laboratory version, but if that was the best they
had, I\'d be surprised to find it on a public web site, especially
since the lab claims to have been working on the devices since 1979.

Like MIRACL ?

I was under the impression that these lasers used chemicals to
generate the power
that was then used to power the laser, not directly generate the laser
from chemical fuel.

If that\'s the case, then the power could be used to power a rail gun
instead, surely ?

Planning in the sense of studies actually funded by the US DoD.

True, I read of it in an article by Jerry Pournelle (or was it Harry
Stein, I\'d have to dig up the magazine from the archives) in a 1981
science fiction magazine,  but he had the reference to the actual
study.

You can call it science fiction if you like, but when Kennedy made his
speech about putting men on the moon, that was also "science fiction"
at the time. It didn\'t prevent the existence of serious research on
the subject.

However, I shouldnl\'t have said "current" planning, I\'ve no idea  what
they are currently planning.

Which was EXACTLY my point, if your perceptive skills had been keen enough
to see through the reference to "Top Gun" long enough to get to the meat
without being biased by said reference.

I was in an Air Cav Squadron.  For the most part military pilots ARE more
professional than Tom Cruise, but they ALSO hotdog it every now and then.

Take the Marine pilots who knocked down that gondola in Italy(was it?).  The
was an episode of hotdogging that got caught.  How much doesn\'t get caught?
Military people can go on and on about how professional they are, but if
they were all so professional, they wouldn\'t have OER\'s and EER\'s.

Once again, you didn\'t see through the reference.  The scene I referred to
had a V.C. yelling, "G.I., F---- You!" repeatedly.  The American who M-79\'ed

Many animals don\'t simply react on instinct.  It has been sufficiently
demonstrated that animals reason and feel emotion.  The only difference is
that there is a language barrier, so many I.Q. points, and we have gotten a
better education.  How many I.Q. points before you become "sentient"?  Are
mentally handicapped people NOT sentient?  This is all just so much human
vanity.  Thinking themselves so much wiser, they named themselves "Homo
Sapiens Sapiens", "Wise, wise man."  Look around.  We aren\'t so wise.  We
don\'t even LIKE wisdom.  If we did Proverbs would be a best seller and
Wisdom Literature would sell movies, not sex and violence.

I remember being excited about that too.

Actually, Tw2K v2.2 tweaked the house system again, based on what
I\'ve been told.  Some of the combat rules from TNE got changed
*slightly* in v2.2 of Tw2K.

Like all systems, <grin>, I have problems with the GDW house system,
but the basic ideas behind mechanics did seem solid to me.

Problems I had:

    1.  The task system *played* too complicated for me:  Add two
        numbers, multiply or divide the total and compare to the
        roll of a d20 *looks* beautiful, but for me, played ugly.
        Call me math impaired, but I prefer to avoid multiplying or
        dividing *during* task resolution if I can.  Multiplying and
        dividing (and raising to powers) should be done before or
        after game play.  Adding or subtracting is OK.
        
        I would have liked, something where you added to or
        subtracted from the Asset (Target Number in T4 terms) to
        represent the Task difficulty.  For example:  Easy +6;
        Routine +3; Difficult 0; Formidable -3; Staggering -6;
        Hopeless -9.
        
    2.  Attributes having so much more influence on tasks than skill
        levels.  I feel MT (and CT, though its dm\'s) gave the
        characteristic too little weight and TNE and T4 gave it too
        much at the top end and too little at the bottom end of the
        scale.
        
        Hard to fix if you retain the traditional Traveller 2 to 12
        (+2 or 3 for career improvements) spread for Attributes.  If
        we could reduce that spread let\'s say use 2+(2d6/2) up, to
        get a spread of 3 to 8 (+ no more than 2 for career
        improvement), it would help a lot, IMO, and still give
        plenty of spread for diversity.  And of course, you might
        want to increase the *number* of skill levels a character
        gets a little, but just a little.

    3.  For a lot of reasons, I would *prefer* using d6\'s and having
        a pseudo-normal distribution to using a d20 and having a
        uniform distribution.  BTW, I *do* think the 1d20 combined
        with the multiply/divide was a neat way of producing a
        curve-like result with a uniform distribution.
        
        I think using 3d6 and a fixed +/- 3 step for the tasks would
        give similar results.  It would also let us use the more
        common d6\'s *and* have a scale that is pretty much identical
        to the GURPS scale.
        
    4.  The personal wound/injury/damage scale/procedure.  It was
        too complicated in some ways and too soft on wounds, IMO,
        lots of folks disagree with me, of course.
        
        The reduction of Attributes, like in T4, *is* a good way of
        modeling wound/injuries, in that it makes it harder to
        accomplish future tasks, and I\'d like a Wound Level System
        similar to TNE\'s (actually I like how FUDGE does it better)
        for handling unconsciousness or death.

    5.  Why isn\'t there a unified combat procedure than goes from
        personal to vehicle to ship levels?  The pieces are there to
        do it, but the methods for handling things like penetration,
        DV and AV are different...not a lot, but enough to be a
        pain...IMO.  
        
        Were I doing it, I\'d probably rescale FFS to match the
        numbers from GRUPS vehicles and use the GURPS scales from
        personal all the way up to starship combat.  Yes, there
        would be some *big* numbers for AV and DV of a Tigress, but
        that\'s better, IMO, than the complication of multiple
        scales.
        
IAC, we\'ve argued these issues too many times to count, so we
probably shouldn\'t get into another argument about it now.  ;->

The players in my PBEM are struggling with the firearm restrictions
on a planet at the moment.  All firearms off Starport property are
highly regulated, kept in designated armories, checked out to ranges
or for set periods of time for hunting, and tagged with tracking
devices.  A character could get 5 to 10 years for uncontrolled
possession of a firearm and 2 to 5 for *any* concealed weapon.  So
far, they are obeying the laws, but I can tell they feel somewhat
uncomfortable not "packing"...and as there have been several murders
involved in the plot so far, I can understand it.  ;->

No, chemical lasers burn fuels together in such a way that the reaction
product ends up in an excited state, which then lases before it has time to
drop into a non-excited state. No electricity involved, which is part of why
they\'re tempting for aircraft/space applications.

I would be astonished if there\'s a real DoD study that discusses (at anything
other than the "someday, it would be nice if...") relocated asteroids as
bases for self-sustaining railguns. Also annoyed. When Kennedy talked about
landing on the moon, it was something that was plausible with available 
technology within the next decade. Relocating asteroids to Earth orbit 
is not, by many decades. (And a US with the lift capability and technology
necessary to do this could carry up a heck of a lot of conventional ammo
without going to the bother of shipping asteroids...)

Reminds me of the Kzinti from Star Fleet Battles.

It seems the Kzinti were a bunch of big space-kitties, divided into clans.
They spent most of their time having innumerable civil wars with each
other. This caused a fascinating side effect: their starships were optimized
to fight other Kzinti starships. 

Thus when they first tangled with other interstellar states, their starships
came off badly by comparison. Simply put, there were weapons and
tactics the Kzinti ship designers never allowed for. Their standard
cruiser designs were good enough to take on the (similar) cruisers
of the next clan over, that was good enough - especially as actually
shooting at each other was probably a highly ritualized endeavor.

Imagine an Aslan cruiser making first contact with a human warship.
If the Aslan ship was designed for ritualized clan warfare, it might
have powerful active sensors, no stealth, many small craft (so
individual Aslan could attain honor as fighter pilots), perhaps heavy
armor and light weapons (the objective is to show your skill and
courage superiority, not to kill the guys who might be your next
set of brothers-in-law). It might also have no defenses against certain
"dishonorable" weapons...Meson Guns maybe?

Then you have the human ship, designed for a one-shot-one-kill high
threat environment. Stealth, extensive passive sensors, killer spinal
mount heavy weapon, probably light armor (if they saw you you were
dead anyway). Different tools for different jobs.

You know I thought of that (the concept, not doing it) when I was at good ol
Marine Corps Recruit Depot.   When we were on the firing line, I noticed that
quite a few of the line PMIs had sidearms.  : )  The moment your muzzle
awareness goes hideously wrong enough that u\'re sighting in on someone on the
firing line (much less the anyone behind the line), my bet is there\'s a 9mm
slug or 2 in you.  You\'d be extremely lucky to get more than one pull of the
trigger off before getting shot or appropriately manhandled.  At least, that\'s
MCRD.   Since boot camp, excepting the pistol range (duh), usually only the
ammo techs have sidearms IIRC.

Never been on an Army range (well I was, but we were using it on our own).

Firstly, how can a game company stick to a ridiculously tight release

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
I believe the problem is that most game companies don\'t own their
own professional-grade printing equipment.

Quality printing firms have production schedules. The better the firm, the
tighter the schedule. If you want your publication printed, you schedule
a date with the printers, telling them what you\'ll need - how many pages,
what kind of stock, what kind of colors, etc. This date is months in
advance, and you base the date you want on your professional opinion on 
how long it will take to get the book together - written, artwork, proofs, etc.
When the printing firm can actually work you in will change the date
even more.

Now, you could wait until you had the book done, proofread, all
up to snuff before you even set the date - but the book (and all the
production money you\'ve invested) would then sit on a shelf for months
on end until the printing firm had an opening.

If time gets tight and you\'re behind schedule, you can miss your "date"
at the printers. They then have to break down your stock and setup
stuff and store it while they wait for you to get done. Their other jobs
may not be ready for them to work on yet, as the other publishers
are tight on deadlines too - so their machines sit idle, costing them
money. Money they will probably be charging you, in addition to what
you\'ll spend when you do get done and are ready to get it printed.
Miss your date by a day, you spend lots of money and wait another
big chunk of time before your product is printed and on the way to
the retail stores. Meanwhile, the interest on what you spent on this
project keeps accumulating.

When deadlines close in, something has to give. It\'s unfortunate that
product quality checking is so often first, but the alternative may be
no product at all. Granted, the company should take error-laden products
as a warning to allow more time for the next project - but it\'s a simple
fact that some books take longer to get together than others.

The binding energy of Phobos is about 1.6e16 joules (this is from memory - 
I think gravitational binding energy goes as (m^2/r) and Earth\'s is about
2x10^32 joules.) That\'s probably more than the amount of antimatter the
Imperium could manufacture (and deploy efficiently) at TL15...but is only
about 16 tonnes travelling at 1000 km/s (55 BL hexes per turn, or 6 G for
4.6 hours.) So it doesn\'t even require a particularly relativistic missile - 
a big battlefleet could carry several hundred such missiles. The carrying
ship could do most of the acceleration before entering jump and emerge
at Mars\' 100-d limit moving at 1000 km/s, drop the missiles (which 
adjust their course accordingly). The defence is to intercept these with ones
own big KKMs, so the rest of the fleet has to come in to provide PD fire to
protect the deimos-busters, or you keep lobbing them until Deimos runs out of
countermissiles.

Lesson: fixed installations in the Traveller universe are undefendable. 

Possibly Deimos - if it really was a major naval base - would have a 
really big maneuver drive and some maneuver capability to defend against this
attack (even a hundredth of a G would help with not being where the
attack expects you to be, since the attacker (if they\'re jumping in) is using
two-week-old positional data. In that case, the first task for the Imperium is
to destroy the maneuver drive.

(Other Lesson: it\'s not nice to fool with conservation of energy...)

I *think* there were experiments with pretty large rail-guns on the
Eglin Reservation during the mid to late 80\'s. Might have been
rumors, or disinformation, for all I really know.  

These experiments supposedly had something to do with SDI research,
but I think it\'s more likely to have been anti-armor or tactical air
research...actually probably all three.  ;-> I haven\'t heard about
any large-scale followups, though.

Hey, at the high school I went to (not all that long ago) we weren\'t even
allowed to have a wargaming club. We could still play RPGs or wargames
though.

It had nothing to do with the irrational cry of "satanism" (which was a hell
of alot less influential, at least here on the East Coast, than many folks
think, in fact I only lost one gamer in my youth at the height of the
satanism scare), it had more to do with the equally irrational cry of
"teenage suicide".

I don\'t know how many younger folks are out there on this list (I just
turned 23 myself), but the next generation of gamers are not the young
teenagers, they\'re the older teens and the early twenty-somethings. All of
my peers are in this age group, and I\'ve never, ever had a problem
converting someone, male or female, hip or not, to roleplaying.

Of course, this is all just personal observation. It may be based on
personal charisma or something else... However, there are _plenty_ of
roleplayers out there. One of the things that people have to realize,
however, is that AD&D and White Wolf\'s WoD, being the most popular, are most
people\'s entry into the gaming world. As long as we have the folks (and it
happens on this list and in GURPS circles _plenty_) who feel the need to
point out how stupid and moronic these games (and the people who play them)
are... as hobbyists, we\'ll be killing ourselves.

As long as there are folks who down Magic (and other CCGs), AD&D and WoD and
their players, the hobby will remain completely divided. The hobby will have
no growth potential. People have to learn to accept that the hobby has
changed, is changing, and will continue to change.

Yep, that\'s how I understand it works, and that\'s why deadlines are
deadlines.

Of course, if we weren\'t talking about all those color plates and
fancy artwork that some of you seem to *require*....<grin>...

Personally, I think the LBB are *the* standard for game books, but
I\'m an old fogey, so what do I know.

	In regard to  Imperial weapon restrictions, The "Rules of War"  prohibit the
use of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons,  that seems clear enough.
Otherwise it seems to be strictly local matter, with one big exception.  In at
least one version of the game (I think it was either MT Imperial Encyclopaedia
or a T4 book)  it says that NOBLES, including their entourages/bodyguards have
a right to bear arms.  I\'ve taken that to mean that they are above planetary
restrictions. Commoners, on the other hand are bound by planetary law only.
One only has to look at our friend Dulinor to see just how far the Noble\'s
right to bear arms extends.	
	IIRC Gurps Traveller says that the Extra-territorial  Starport grounds
allow one to carry just about anything, as long as you don\'t use it.
	As to FGMP\'s  I\'ve always ruled that these were in the governed by local law
level,  but since there are few very high tech planets, with very low law
level, and  with an indigenous Industrial base that could actually build the
weapons, they are really not very availible.  Additionally, since any merchant
or ex-scout can buy a Laser cannon for his ship that can destroy buildings,
powerplants, hospitals, dairy farms and hippy communes, the dangers of FGMPs
and explosives shrink a bit in comparison.

There *is* a barrier to IR in that case - the atmosphere. The imagery is
supposed to be Thermal Imagery, from a satellite. The atmosphere *does*
have two wavelength windows for IR; but these work well at short
distances. Not through the whole thickness of the atmosphere. This is
one of the reasons that most short range air-to-air missiles are IR
guided; but long range ones are radar guided.

Not quite, more like the necessities of modern publishing have hit Steve
Jackson games.

Maybe, maybe not. It doesn\'t really matter in the long run, because that\'s
not the reason for the problem. Steve Jackson farms out its printing to
different printing plants. There are contracts involved, specific dates that
have to be met. Add to distributors into that mix and you\'ve got even more
of a mess...

It may have bothered the distributors. It may have bothered SJG, who most
likely gave a certain amount of their budget over to printing the book.
Money that could have gone to getting another supplement out _had they
known_ the book would be "a couple of weeks, or even months" late!

SJG is not a charity. Other gaming companies are not charities. They are
businesses. They exist to supply gaming materials to the gaming public at a
cost. It would be nice if we lived in a utopia where everyone just wrote
roleplaying material and turned it out for the fun of it... However, we
don\'t. (As a side note, the Internet is changing that a bit, dedicated
people like Jeff Zeitlin, Joe Heck, Keven R. Pittsinger and others have
given us _free_ webpages that have stuff that is of professional quality.
Remember to thank them, and others like them, profusely).

>I really don\'t understand game companies or the people who work for
>them.


It\'s not that hard. Keep in mind that they are businesses, and they are
people _working_ for businesses. SJG does not want to go the way that GDW or
a host of other gaming companies have gone. The roleplaying crunch has hit
everybody, and it has hit everybody hard.

A business can\'t make money if the money it already has is tied up in
projects that are waiting to be perfected. In fact, running a company like
that is a sure way to be out of work in short order.

Seeing as these "game designers/writers" who you feel free to slander are
trying to expand your hobby for a fraction of the money that devoting their
time to a "real job" would give them, I feel that you should show them a bit
more respect and give them a little bit more leeway.

Seeing as the folks who are working directly on Traveller are your peers on
this mailing list, I feel that you should choose your words more carefully.

The roleplaying hobby has been drying up over the last couple of years.
There has been a good deal of turmoil in the industry. There have been major
changes in the American hobby market (with all due respect to my foreign
brethren). In the late 80s and early 90s the market fractured completely.
There was reorganization on all levels. Companies that had existed and
survived for a decade or more were feeling the pinch. Some companies managed
to come out on top by being in the right place at the right time (R.
Talsorian games had a shining moment, White Wolf games, formerly a minor
player in the market rose quickly up the ranks, exploiting a market that
nobody else even knew existed).

Now, roleplaying companies have to be run like businesses. That\'s the stark
harsh fact of the real world. There are deadlines presented by _everybody_
involved in the business.

Let\'s set up a hypothetical, yet very realistic situation. SJG (or any other
gaming company) sets a deadline for a book. Since this is imaginary, we\'ll
make it a GT book. This GT book has a deadline not because Steve Jackson
wants it that way, or the accountants demand it that way. No, the reality of
the situation is that money has to come in. Now gaming shops, in their
industry news leaflets see that a new GT book is coming out. Some of these
shops are run by people who could care less about GURPS, SJG, or even
Traveller. However, they know that they had several special orders for the
last GT book. So, different stores now want to buy this book. They either
send their money to SJG\'s wholesale department (if the store is able to do
that) or they send their money to a distributor. Now these stores have given
real money to someone else. In turn, the distributor gives real money to
SJG. Steve Jackson games sets aside the money it had gotten from a recent
printing of another book to print the new GT book.

Now, there\'s a whole lot of money from a whole lot of people floating
around. Now, SJG waits to release a game until there are no errors. A week
passes. Another week passes... A month passes...

Now, the distributors are all starting to get mad. They could have ordered
extra copies of the latest, hottest, Spider Man comic. The hobby shops get
mad, because _they_ could have ordered copies of the latest hottest Spider
Man comic AND  whatever else they need to sell, like more Magic cards, or
additional issues of "Knights of the Dinner Table".

So now what do you have? You have the fans, some of whom feel ripped off
because they were really waiting for that new book before starting their GT
campaign. You have the hobby shops, who are really mad because they know
that SJG is late with the game. You have the distributors, who are fuming
because, not only do they have money down on this new book, _but_ they have
hobby shops calling all the time asking if it\'s in yet!

So, the faith retailers and distributors have in SJG is absolutely shot to
hell. They may carry some more SJG stuff for a little while, but not too
much. SJG loses tons of sales because their stuff isn\'t on the shelves to be
perused by potential customers. SJG flounders for a little while, and starts
to lose money. They lay people off. Due to budget constraints, the GURPS
Traveller line is cancelled. Loren K. Wiseman stays on as art director, but
soon, the company begins to fall apart. They try, but can\'t pay their
writers. Nobody wants to write for them. Nobody wants to carry their books.
They go out of business...

Then, a few months later after the gaming public sees that all GURPS stuff
is marked down 20-50% they realize SJG is gone for good. A couple years
later, many gaming fans are heard to say in passing conversation "Man, it\'s
such a shame that SJG is gone!"...

>Or has no-one in the game industry got the guts to stand up to idiots
>?


Tell that to the people who have to make rent on their storefront in order
to sell this stuff. Tell that to the distributors who have to keep the
orders to the local stores filled. Tell that to the people at the
roleplaying games who are trying to make a living in a dying market and have
to put up with constant bitching no matter _what_ they do!

1) We don\'t have freedom of speech.  Unless this is the arrogant assumption
that this list is totally American.

2) This list is for the discussion of Traveller, and the community on the
TML tends to be reasonable as to what can be discussed. But you continue to
ignore warning signs, and blunder into arguments like a bull in a china
shop. Clif, please try and avoid responding when people push your buttons.
I would actually rather you weren\'t removed from the list (as some of your
Traveller related postings were quite interesting), which is cutting you a
lot more slack than other people here. But if you carry on like this Rob
Miracle will get more complaints and then you get cut out of here.

Please try and wait and think over what you post - maybe overnight - before
you send it. Think if you\'re likely to be off topic or enflame another list
member. You\'re entitled to your views, and others have theirs. But the way
you present them is likely to get you cut out of the forum, and then what
good is free speech if no-one listens to the voice?

Timeline, yes. Rules system, no.

However, seeing as Tw2K had slightly different timelines depending
on the version, the question would be *which* timeline did 2300
evolve from?  ;-p  Or did Traveller 2300 evolve from Tw2K v1 and
2300AD from Tw2K v2? ;-/`

I\'ll second Titan Games as a good source.

If it is an SJG product, you can order direct from them too.

<< Never been on an Army range (well I was, but we were using it on our own).

I learned to shoot a handgun at the NYCPD range at Rodman\'s neck in the Bronx
when I was in the academy. I remember that ALL weapons were unloaded (you
loaded on the firing line), and you left the line unloaded. If you unholstered
your weapon anywhere except on the line, and only on the command "draw your
service revolver" (presumably now a service pistol...), you were IMMEDIATELY
fired.  The range instructors had no such prohibitions and I bet that their
definition of "fired" is different if a recruit gets dangerous...

The one exception was after the day\'s shooting we had to clean our weapons
before we turned them back in, and then we wouldn\'t see them again until the
day before graduation, when we were given our weapon and shields to take home.
That was a hell of a feeling...

An amusing sidenote was that the Dept. of Corrections used work release
inmates as custodians to clean up the range. Every couple of years a recruit
takes a crap, and leaves his gunbelt in the john. It\'s very funny to see a
prisoner in an orange jumpsuit walk up to a range officer and say "I found
this in the bathroom...". The inmate gets a LOT of good time towards his
release, and the poor recruit is now unemployed...

Ob Traveller: gosh this is tough...hmm...wacky NPC encounters?

Yeah, the Vargr are the most humanlike of the aliens, but the Hivers have
*GOTTA* be the most alien.

Ack!  That\'s equivalent to a disabled Kinunir (~16000 metric tons) moving at
only 32 km/s (under 2 G-turns)!  Are those numbers right?

Deimos may be the smallest moon in the Solar System; it masses only around
two trillion tons, and probably has a volume of about as many cubic meters.

Most of the other moons left off the extended UWP list have diameters under
200 km (size S) and are therefore too small to show up even there; Phobos
and Deimos both get missed this way.  The gas giants look like this:

  * Jupiter: Io, Europa, Ganymede, Callisto.  
             (Amalthea just misses at 196 km)
  * Saturn:  Mimas, Enceladus, Tethys, Dione, Rhea, Titan, Hyperion, 
             Iapetus, Phoebe.
  * Uranus:  Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, Oberon.
  * Neptune: Proteus, Triton, Nereid.
             (Larissa just misses at 192 km)

As I recall, only Proteus was missed on the extended UWP chart, and that\'s
because it was discovered by Voyager 2 in 1989.  There\'s probably a couple
of dozen asteroids that would qualify if listed individually.

1.   MT to T4 conversions

Clif asked:

>
>And these, also?
>
>Interview
>Recruiting
>Liaison

Vice, Physical, Inborn, and Interpersonal are cascade skills - that is,
they refer to a set of skills from which you pick ONE skill, for example:

Academic (Cascade)
     Admin
     History
     Linguistics
     Persuasion
     Science (Cascade)
     +1 Edu
Economic (Cascade)
     Admin
     Broker
     Legal
     Trader
Inborn (Cascade)
     Artisan
     Carousing
     Instruction
     Jack-of-all-Trades
     Leader
Interpersonal (Cascade)
     Admin
     Interview
     Liaison
     Linguistics
     Steward
Mental (Cascade)
     +1 Edu
     +1 Int
Physical (Cascade)
     +1 Dex
     +1 End
     +1 Str
Vice (Cascade)
     Bribery
     Disguise
     Forgery
     Gambling
     Intrusion
     Streetwise

Most of the list have already been translated by Eris, although I disagree
with him about the following:

>Interview.......Interrogation

Interview is a "Serves as" skill in MT. Specifically, it "serves as"
Interrogation-1, although the reverse does not apply in MT. Interview was
created by DGP so that their journalist, Akida Laagir, had a unique skill.

Maybe you could stretch this in T4 (although I would make it
Interrogation-1) if you really feel that you need to keep this skill.

>Recruiting......none, Carousing or Fast Talk might do

I think Fast Talk is just for the initial encounter - this is the "Eddie
Murphy" skill. ;-)  Recruiting skill is used to determine a potential
hireling\'s true worth, so perhaps Admin or even Investigation or Diplomacy
are better choices. Even better, roleplay through three levels: Fast Talk
for initial contact, Investigation/Diplomacy/Interrogation for the
interview, Admin for the final paperwork. ;-)

>Liaison.........none, Carousing and Admin might do

_Diplomacy_ is a thinly-disguised version of Liaison; both really do the
same thing, but I think that Marc wanted the nobility to have something to
do (this is the basis of the Milieu:0 campaign) and therefore needed more
skills based on Soc.

Of course, feel free to vary all of this in your campaign - I do! I allow
the following additions IMTU:

Academic
     Instruction
Interpersonal
     Interrogation (if appropriate to the service)
     Persuasion
     Streetwise
Vice
     Stealth

And if you are adding Physical as a T4 "cluster", I suggest you include
Athletics, Dance, and Throwing to the cluster list.

2.   Skill Set Discussion

The differences in the skill sets are due to the way game designers choose
to model people\'s abilities. Some systems, such as AD&D, do not use
specific skills as a basis for their characters. In AD&D, the basis of a
character\'s abilities is their character class. Fighters cannot cast
spells, while magic-users cannot fight very well. Thieves can pick pockets,
but cannot cast healing spells, the purvue of the cleric. Secondary skills
are just that - secondary. They are an afterthought, thrown in to round out
and/or differentiate a character. However, this system allows a small party
of five or six PC\'s to be balanced - the mix of abilities should be
sufficient to deal with most things a GM throws at them.

Other systems are based on skills rather than classes. Some of these, such
as Rolemaster and - dare I say it - GURPS, are IMO too detailed in their
differentiation of skills (proponents of these systems prefer to call them
"comprehensive"!). I have found that it can be difficult to create a
balanced party. Too often, a scenario calls for a skill that the party
simply doesn\'t have.

I think it is better to have a smaller selection of skills, and allow the
skills to be reasonably broadly-based. This is a juggling act to produce a
balanced, inclusive, and playable skill set. Traveller does this reasonably
well. For example, "Electronics" allows a character to do everything from
repairing a vehicle\'s wiring, to installing lights in a house, to repairing
a computer\'s circuitry! In "reality", these are broken down into different,
individual specialities (in fact, supplementary rules such as the "Imperial
Academy of Science and Medicine" exist for just this purpose). However,
from a *game* perspective, a house electrician will be pretty useless to a
party who have to repair a shot-up control panel on their grav vehicle!
Thus the broad nature of the skills, and the use of Serves As skills (MT)
or Cascade skills (T4).

The other way that Traveller clumps skills together is through Cascade
skills (MT) or Clusters (T4). These are primarily used in character
creation, allowing the player some measure of choice over the skills their
character asquires while still retaining a certain randomness (ignore this
discussion for TNE). I recently completed MT-style character generation
systems for Police and the Imperial Ministry of Justice (neither up on my
site as yet, sorry!). To do this, I used Cascade skills throughout the
skills selection tables, just as MT did. In fact, I even stole a few new
cluster groupings from the IRIS chargen article in Challenge. Randomness
WITH choice - it is possible!

    'body' => 'Dear Folks -

I have designed vehicles using both _Striker_ (v1) and _Megatraveller_, and
was always unhappy about the "all-round" armour used in MT. It works fine
and is logical for space vessels, but not for planet-based combat vehicles.

Therefore, I created a spreadsheet to remodel the armour for MT vehicles,
and it is available on my website. This is an attempt to re-distribute the
armour UN-evenly over their surfaces, achieved by estimating the total MT
armour volume in _Striker_ terms, then moving it around.

Admittedly, it does this in a quick-and-dirty way.

First, you must estimate the vehicle dimensions. You are given a little
help though a table that gives basic dimensions based on an arbitrary ratio:
width = 1.5 x height, and length = 4.5 x width. However, YOU can modify the
final dimensions if you are not happy - just make sure it all multiplies out
to give the same vehicle volume as before!

Second, it assumes that "slope" was never taken into account before, and
therefore uses the slope factor to improve the armour class of the
vehicle.

[If I was doing this "properly", I would have to recalc the "real"
original thickness *including* the slope modifier, so that everything
equals the overall armour rating. However, I think that the vehicles that
come out of the standard MT design process are wounded enough, and deserve
the extra help. Besides, I want the system to be quick, not a full re-build
of every design!]

For some, like the second version of the Trepida (below), I simply cheated
and DOUBLED the base thickness so that it comes out looking like a real
tank instead of a tin-can. It\'s either this or re-design the sucker!

I worked out the system using a number of examples from _101 Vehicles_,
specifically the Lancer, Gram Grav APC, and Trepida.

Lancer Combat Vehicle (_101 Vehicles_, p 18)
     Base MT AV: 50G (bonded superdense)
     Effective thickness (Striker/MT) = 80cm hard steel
     Real thickness (Striker) = effective thickness / toughness / slope
          = 80 / 14 / 1
          = 5.7143 cm bonded superdense
     Arbitrary dimensions: 20m x 4.5m x 3m (length/width/height)
     Assumed Slopes: Front radical, Sides moderate, remainder nil
     Re-calculated armour: Front 12.47cm, Rear 5.72cm, Sides 5.86cm (each),
          Deck 5.72cm, Belly 4.5cm
     Re-rated Armour: Front 67, Rear 50, Sides 55, Deck 50, Belly 47

Gram Grav APC (_101 Vehicles_, p 9)
     Base MT AV: 43E (Crystaliron)
     Eff thickness = 43.6cm hard steel
     Real thickness = 8.72cm crystaliron
     Dimensions: 6m x 4.5m x 2.5m
     Slopes: Front and rear moderate, remainder nil
     Re-calculated armour: Front 10.667cm, Rear 5.814cm, Sides 10.38cm,
          Deck 9.52cm, Belly 6.72cm (this uses fractionally too much
          armour, actually 0.06m^3 too much - well, I can live with that!)
     Re-rated armour: Front 50, Rear 43, Sides 45, Deck 44, Belly 40

Trepida Grav Tank (_101 Vehicles_, front endpiece), without doubling
     Base MT AV: 40G (Bonded Superdense)
     Eff thickness = 33.6cm hard steel
     Real thickness = 2.4cm bonded superdense
     Dimensions: 9m x 5m x 3m
     Slopes: Front radical, sides and and rear moderate, remainder nil
     Re-calculated armour: Front 4.8216cm, Rear 1.9056cm, Sides 2.4720cm,
          Deck 2.4000cm, Belly 1.7016cm (this uses 0.01m^3 too much armour)
     Re-rated armour: Front 56, Rear 42, Sides 45, Deck 40, Belly 36

Trepida Grav Tank (_101 Vehicles_, front endpiece), WITH doubling
     Base MT AV: 40G (Bonded Superdense)
     Eff thickness = 33.6cm hard steel
     Real thickness = 2.4cm bonded superdense
          (now double it - a quick-and-dirty cheat) = 4.8cm BSD
     Dimensions: 9m x 5m x 3m
     Slopes: Front radical, sides and and rear moderate, remainder nil
     Re-calculated armour: Front 12.4643cm, Rear 3.8096cm, Sides 4.9524cm,
          Deck 4.8072cm, Belly 2.4000cm (uses 0.0066m^3 too much)
     Re-rated armour: Front 67, Rear 50, Sides 53, Deck 48, Belly 40
          (There, THAT looks a bit better!)

Sorry to correct Bruce, the Dean of Traveller T4 Sensors, but the MT rules
included densitometers. These could give you a density map of an object\'s
interior - rather like an Xray. This is why I don\'t have many objections to
laying out starship deckplans during boarding actions, rather than
(AD&D-tyle) having the map "rezz" in front of the characters as they
move...

Admittedly, it is a Difficult task to see through superdense and above. I
rule that even on success the images received are fuzzy, but sufficiently
detailed enough for computer enhancement to produce a floorplan.

1.)  Not everyone on this list is from the United States.

2.)  This list bandwidth is generously provided by MPGN, which stands for
the "MultiPlayer Gaming Network" or some-such. This bandwidth is provided
_free_ for us to use by them, even though it brings them no profit. In fact,
I\'d be willing to bet that many folks on this list don\'t even know what MPGN
is or what their major product is. I will give away this much of a hint: It
has nothing to do with Traveller. This list is a courtesy given to us by
folks who could, most likely, find better use for that bandwidth than
allowing us to use it.

In summary: There is no such thing as freedom of speech on this mailing
list. Period.

It\'s not just the three of you either... There are more people, people who
spend time and effort so that other people don\'t have to, for no money and
no real recognition. That\'s what I was getting at with the side note to my
rant.

Dear Folks -

I finally got around to publishing the Unresolved-class G-Carrier on my
"Hyphen\'s Traveller pages". Here is the outline ( the "pretty" version AND
spreadsheet listing are available on my site):

TL 15 UNRESOLVED G-CARRIER

The Unresolved-class G-Carrier was commissioned by Adifux Inc LIC Pty Ltd
as the company\'s primary means of surface transportation. Two of the
company owners (the Aslan noble Sir Eoraokortitrikhue, OEG, of Rhylanor and
the Droyne noble Sir Ervmisbe, OEG, of Auitawry) specified that the
external shell be identical to the time-honoured Resolve-class, allowing
them to hide a high-performance vehicle inside a fa

Content-Disposition: inline
Content-transfer-encoding: quoted-printable


ade that would not
arouse suspicion - in effect, creating a Q-ship. Even the fusion gun has
been modelled to look as much as possible like the Resolve\'s standard
laser. As long as the vehicle is driven as though it were a Resolve (with a
cruising speed of 315 kph and top speed of 420 kph), most people don\'t give
it a second look. However, a close visual inspection will show that the
"laser", at the very least, is not what it seems.

A normal extrality line inspection of the vehicle will not reveal the
nature of the craft. A close inspection will reveal the extra sensor
equipment, and a suspicious customs officer may wonder about the thick
armour and the high-tech power plant (half the size of the original but
with three times the output!). However, Low Law Level worlds (3-) will
generally allow the craft through. At Moderate Law Levels (4-7), even a
vehicle-mounted laser is illegal, and will not be allowed past the
extrality line. In this event, the weapon must be removed before the
vehicle can proceed. Fortunately for Adifux, they have a competent Vargr
engineer (Sir Dakhrongkae, OEG) who can dismantle the fusion gun and
conceal its components behind panels in the cargo area (they even plug
in!). Only an extremely close inspection and scan of the vehicle will
reveal the weapon when it is hidden in this way. However, it takes at least
half a day to reassemble, reattach and realign.

The vehicle only has half the passenger capacity of the original and costs
three times as much, but the owners believe that the extra performance and
on-board equipment more than compensate!

There are many atmospheric windows in the IR, and in many of them the
end-to-end absorbtion is less than 50% - much less than 50% for dry
sites. (I usually worry about this in the "looking up" direction, of
course, but it works both ways.)

IR missiles tended to be short ranged more because of primitive detectors
(mechanically-scanned single-element detectors) than anything fundamental.
A $60,000 commercial IR camera (about the size of a bulky camcorder) can
see commercial jet aircraft at 20 - 40 miles with no special image processing
or optimization (I\'ve done the test myself.)

I remember reading in an old issue of Ares about this theory.  It dealt
with how war might take place on a system level.  The author theorized that
the "owning" empire would have a large number of remotely guided and
commanded \'darts\' orbiting somewhere beyond the farthest planet.  When the
need arose to keep the local system in line, the order was given to change
the trajectory and begin acceleration.  This would give the guy on the
ground a chance to resolve the dispute peacefully, but having a big stick
just in case.

I could be wrong - as I said, it\'s from memory - but Phobos/Deimos are
pretty small. In fact, they\'re probably held together as much by mechanical
forces/rigidity as gravity, which implies that one might need several times
more energy to disrupt them; still, overall they\'re pretty small and wimpy.

No, we just have to met higher expectation levels with the artwork. Have a

Or the WW stuff. Although in the latter case style may overpower content a

Elric! and Legends are the two better examples, Elric especially as it is
B&W, and clear.

Consider the examples in Imperium and the background about Vilani/Terran
contact.

Missile Boats, Beam armaments, Missile Cruisers etc. The Vilani were
hidebound to a style of combat.

Sorry for the massive over-quoting here- but I thought it necessary to make
sure that the general jist of this convo. was kept "on track" so to speak,
it\'s
rather simple for people to repeat what was already covered in the above
information...

Well Matt... When playing Twilight 2000, I\'ve come across (I believe) three,
not two systems. We\'ve got Starlite, Infrared, and Thermal imaging systems-
Unless two of these are the same with differing names...

You\'ve summed up Starlite (Light Intensification), and Thermal sites really
well above... But, that still leaves Infrared rather open. I REALLY wish I
could
remember my source for this- because I\'m in no way qualified to say this on
my own accounts and experience (Except starlite)...

Anyway, I *think* the difference between IR and Thermal is that one picks up
on Heat  while the other picks up on Radiation itself... Somehow, that
doesn\'t make sense since "Heat" and "Thermal" are basically synonymous though.

I always thought that IR gave you the simple black and white view with varying
shades of gray, while Thermal imaging gave you the special Hollywood type
visual affects like what you see on Predator...

Anyone who knows for sure- please speak up... especially if you have info.
sources for reference, as I\'d like to be able to tell my players very bluntly the
differences- and have the material to back up those statements...

Later.

Better yet...read about the original (in a number of stories in Larry
Niven\'s Known Space series).

Seems they first encountered a human ship with a big honking laser
driving a lightsail (IIRC, and Niven _did_ take liberties with physics).
They had telepaths on board the Kzin ship, who reported that these
furless apes were _so_ stupid that they had ventured into interstellar
space with NO weapons!!!

Such easy prey, Ha! 

IIRC there was like a handful of badly burned Kzin who limped back home
in their mostly wrecked ship after the \'unarmed hairless apes\' turned
their drive onto the attacking aliens... The Kzin really feared us for a
while there.

On the Army range at Ft. Wainwright, AK, there were men behind glass in a
tower (because of the cold).  If you were at the end of the line, you could
pop your buddy with one round and just switch to 3 round burst and fire
away.  Heck, you could light up the tower while you were at it.  A fortunate
soldier could crouch in the pit and be safe, unless the round arched into
the metal side of the pit (was made with a big metal pipe) and ricocheted
into him.

The humans cut the Kzin ship apart with their comm laser, a big honkin laser

I just need to figure out the best Traveller system and key it in.

You could sugest it to that Vargr over there...

(The one with the FGMP...)

to run.  :-)

Any "morale modifier" that would be a result of such an activity would be
balanced out by the fact that Vargr numbers would dwindle due to being
vaporized by high-powered plasma weapons.

I could think of a couple of things that the Vargr would do with such a
technology that would be much more useful. I\'m sure the Vargr would think
that other uses would be much better.

Maybe. The concept is pretty much moot, however. We\'re not talking about two
empires that just met last week. We\'re talking about two empires that have
been in contact for hundreds of years.

Yes, but: punch and flank is a million miles away from "howl and get picked
off by enemies".

Hmmm... I stand by my statement even in light of your confusing Top Gun
analogy: If Vargr always chose the "howl and run" tactic you outlined, they
would be predictable AND ineffectual. Not caring whether or not your buddies
get fragged as a result of instinct is kind of silly. As a result, they
would not revel in their instinct but try to suppress it. If not, they\'d
lose by rapidly dwindling numbers.


>The thuds and booms of artillery and tank rounds makes for good
>chest-beating and suppressed forces often yelled at each other.


The booms of artillery and tank rounds also have another, more practical
purpose. That purpose is blowing up the enemy. The main purpose of tanks and
artillery is not bravado, as in my analogy, but destruction of vehicles,
structures and personnel.

>A classic scene is the V.C. on the wire in "Apocalypse Now".  "G.I.,
>Fuc-BOOM!"


An example from a movie that was intended to highlight the madness of war
does _not_ support your argument. Personally, I always thought that sequence
illustrated a severely wounded soldier\'s attempt at dying quickly. Again, it
has nothing to do with my "chest beating" example.

>Some dogs are already smart.  Vargr would be much smarter dogs.


Yes, so smart as to be _sentient_. Sentience, to me at least, indicates that
they have many options open to them. Not merely one dictated directly and
shallowly from their canine ancestors.

No. Kafer did not act like roaches. Not one bit. They acted like creatures
with a low degree of sentient intelligence. However, when they felt
threatened, their brain chemistry would begin to change, and they\'d get
smarter and smarter. They were a dull-brained sentient race that got more
intelligent when threatened. However, despite the fact that they were
relatively stupid by human standards, they still built weapons of high
technology and hovercraft, and all kinds of nifty gadgets. They weren\'t
animals when they weren\'t in danger, they just weren\'t as intelligent or
organized when they weren\'t in danger.

No, they are quite sentient, just not extremely bright. There is a
difference. They were capable of building vehicles, weapons, and starships.

There seems to be a conceptual confusion here.  What is it for something to
be a \'simulation\' as  \'simulation\' rather than (say) merely a game?  You
need to know what you are trying to simulate and in what way.  It obviously
cannot be wholly identical (for then at the very least it would not be a
simulation any more).  I suggest that Chess is a simulation of nothing!
Though it may have originated in some highly abstract war-game.

Simulate 
1 - to assume falsely the appearance of signs of (anything); to feign,
pretend, counterfeit imitate; to profess or suggest (anything) falsely.

2- To have the external features of to present a strong resemblance to
(something)

etc. (OED Vol. ix, Si-St, p. 68)

In what way does \'king maker\' ( A game I very much enjoyed, like Ludo and
snakes and ladders) in any way give even the appearance of reality?
Consider just a few possibilities about what some wargames are supposed to
simulate?  Command and control, commuunications, (usually the best they can
hope to acieve, and the least satisfactory), effects of various weapons
against various targets, etc. (usuallly crude statistiucal moddelling - at
best) The claim is usually that in some salient way, and in a way which is
pertinent to the objective, that the game is focussed upon, the game
imitates reality.  ( it is not even a matter of prioritizing the parts of
the simulation)  

I suggest that if kingmaker can be considered a simulation of the war of
the roses then: first, squad leader is an simulation of command and control
at the company level!
Second, there is nothing that cannot count as a simulation of something
else, and with Thales we say that everything is water.  Possibly not
incorrect, but then to make the claim that something is a simulation is to
make no claim at all. ( A simulation as opposed to what?).  This simply
robs the concept of any substantive content.  

*_Kingmaker_ happened to focus it\'s simulation on political maneuvering
*and the possible effects of outside forces on the war, rather than placing
*the detail priority on combat, logistics, or movement. It\'s not a detailed 
*medieval combat simulator, nor was it intended to be.

The level of abstraction in kingmaker is so high, and the mechanics so
clearly arbitrary (Forgive the slip into loaded language), that I suggest
it is not even vagulely a simulation of the political machinations of the
powers struggles in 15 century England.  It is simply a beer and pretzles
game -  and a good one at that.

I don\'t *think* we need to add a higher rainfall. Places like the
Olympic peninsula (temperate rainforest) and some tropical areas are
already about as wet as it\'s *possible* to get (rather like Venus as
envisioned by Ray Bradbury and others. Eternal rain....)

I\'d say there\'s a temperate distinction here. Also, ocean communities
tend to be dominated by things like dissolved nutrients. That\'s why the
big fish harvests are in polar areas, where the nutrients carried by
deep ocean currents come to the surface.

And as I noted: "Deep Ocean Vent" :-)

If dealing with *sufficiently* alien life forms, it may be possible to
add a few biomes or to shift the temp/precip ranges some.

Read the book(s). In "Patriot Games" Clancy makes a point that the
satellite images could *not* resolve things like faces. A key point was
when someone noticed a female terrorist sunbathing, and there was a
comment that the analysts had determined (in their spare time) what
size breasts a woman had to have for the satellite to be able to show
her as having visible cleavage. As I recall, it was fairly large. 

This turns out to be a critical point as it lets them identify a
terrorist group.

I\'m working on a full article on this. Shift/watch lengths in the real
world range from as little as 4 hours (Navy) up to 12 hours (some
medical and industrial workers). 

Differing sol lengths are a factor. But research has also shown that
the average human when cut off from cues about the passage of time
tends to settle into a *28* hour cycle. But lighting changes,
especially the equivalent of "bright sunlight" will "reset" this
internal clock. 

I suspect that humans can adapt to sols are short as 12 hours and as
long as 30+ hours. By the time you get to 36 hours, it may make more
sense to have two "work days" per sol. 

Someplace like the moon could either ignore the sol, or, if they do
need to worry about it, they might divide it up into a convenient
number of sub-sols.

That\'s getting into things like "fiscal years". Which are likely to be
Imperial year based, unless there are industries (such as agriculture)
tied to the anno. 

And remember that 30 days or 91 days is apt to be some odd number of
sols.

Oops. I may have that backwards...

Or if they are a civil engineer working on *big* projects where
"nuclear demolition" charges are used. Given nuke dampers, the use of
nukes in civil engineering is almost dead certain. It\'s *much* simpler
to place a medium sized nuke, and then clean up with a damper than it
is to set off *thousands* of smaller charges (or one *big* charge of
conventional explosives). 

On the other hand, if you are Joe Redneck, who has been known to hang
out with "questionable" organizations, the local law enforcement types
are going to go over you with a fine tooth comb.

This paragraph makes very little sense to me. You can claim anything
is a simulation, and then of course your claim will be qualified with
how close to reality it comes, and what is abstracted. I have yet to

At least we agree on something - it is an interesting game.

And the assembly of political factions, the dichotomy between
peacably functional organs of government and internicine slaughters
and the continual pressure of foriegn and internal crises had no bearing
on the events of 14th c England, and thus a GAME that requires
someone to balance these factors (or at least allow for them) will
serve no purpose to understanding a historical reading of these
events?

To the nit-picker, the most strenuosly researched simulation is nothing
but a game.

adult resident be issued a permit to carry a concealed weapon, unless
they\'re a convicted felon or have a history of mental problems.  So I have
the right to do so, and even own a weapon perfectly suitable for such
purposes.  However, I don\'t carry it, and in fact haven\'t even bothered to
put in the paperwork for a permit, because I don\'t need to to carry a
weapon.  In theory this is how things should work: it\'s there if you need
it,  responsible individuals decide their own need.

The problem is that as population density (numbers, not IQ) rises, the
number of irresponsible individuals also increases.  Which means more
gun-toting yahoos, and more innocent bystanders to get shot.  Most US
firearms mores, and the laws enforcing those mores, are based on a low
population density.  In those areas where the density is higher, more
restrictions are imposed on firearms ownership and use, as well as other
aspects of society (zoning, traffic etc.)

Traveller implications:  on worlds generated by the standard random process,
higher population worlds tend to have higher law levels.  Those worlds with
low law levels either are undergoing long-term civil unrest with large areas
essentially abandoned by the authorities, or else are tenaciously clinging
to \'frontier\' traditions.  And as for the existance of Handgun Control type
organizations in the Imperium?  Highly unlikely.  Such pressure groups
depend on the ability to mobilize public opinion, about which the Nobility
does not give a damn.  Now, it\'s possible that the consort of a high-ranking
noble, crippled by an assassination attempt, could make it her life\'s work
to rid the galaxy of personally owned weapons, but this would be more a case
of behind the scenes lobbying rather than the mass media campaigns of the
present.

The original reason that I bought the Kafer sourcebook in the Mid 80\'s was
due to the fact that I thought it was "Early Traveller" timeline and the
Kafers might be the Vegans.

After some mail from Marc and the discussions of the 2300 list it seemed
like the the Vegan Aut. District was just what would happen to the Kafers if
2300 lead to the ROM.

Don\'t forget, that after repeated stimulation, Kafers could become

A stimulated (intelligent) kafer was far more dangerous than his human

THey were just "confused" during the first few rounds.  Then they got nasty.

I have to agree. Here in Texas it is illegal to carry a concealed weapon
without  a permit, but you can get one.  The reason some of us don\'t get a
permit is due to the fact that carrying a concealed weapon is only a
misdemeanor. (I swear my lawyer gave me that advice).  Then again I never
carry a concealed weapon unless I travel.  So, there is probably no Imperial
Task force to catch handgun carriers, even if it is illegal.  It is just too
much trouble and the legal ramifications are probably nil, unless you have
600 misdemeanor arrests for carrying that concealed snub pistol.

Yeah, but eventually the Kzin pushed humanity back to Earth and *almost*
defeated us before we relearned how to fight. Then there was recovering the
colonies, discovering what the Kzin had been doing with their "food", buying
(or was it stealing) the secret to FTL flight, dealing with the Outies and the
Puppeteers, and lots and lots of back and forth wars with the Kzin...

Niven\'s long story arc is excellent reading that covers dozens of books and
stories.

  Hmm, I was too busy playing Titan to get a look at the copy of Elric! at
the table, but the Traveller Book appears to have about 15-20% of the space
devoted to artwork and diagrams of various sorts. Let\'s assume that B&W vs.
colour makes no real difference in function (and as for covers, G:T says a
lot about how the people at SJG assessed the marketing trade-offs), and the
question really comes down to how _much_ art, as upgrading to current styles
and standards in B&W art would seem to be a given.

  So, is 20% too much or too little, and where should the line be drawn?

Yep, but the poor devils kept retooling and trying again.  It was
the one thing that kept the humans from turning on themselves once
they rebreed for the "warrior genes" 

Ob Traveller...maybe if there had been a really formidable opponent
for the 3I they would have concentrated on them and not turned on
themselves.

I student taught highschool and loved it, now I teach Texas history to
backwoods rejects here  in Texas.  These kids are the real life "trailer
trash" you all laugh about.
Life is rough for them and they take it all out at school.
Of course now that I am Dept. Head, I am pushing for a reduced teaching
load, gotta take care the History department you know.

I like that idea, but then again I see the Fractures in the 2300 timeline.
Humanity had a foe, but the allied nations kept getting in each other\'s way.
But I do think the 3I would have benefited from really good opponent.

A jump-1 drive can go anywhere a Jump-6 drive can, it just takes longer.

If you want an uninhabited system just pick one that has a population of
zero. Or do you mean one that has *never* been visited before? This is
unlikely in the Traveller background, especially if it\'s one the players
can easily get to in their Far Trader. If it really is unvisited there is
probably a good reason for it; like anyone who lands there blows up or
something.

Why does it have to be "unvisited" anyway? Why can\'t something new happen
on a planet that has been visited many times? Just because a system has
been visited, or even inhabited for thousands of years, doesn\'t mean
everything about it will be known.

If you really must have an unvisited system you could make it a rogue
planet passing through known space at a high fraction of C. This wouldn\'t
have been around before to be visited, and would require pretty hefty
manuever drives to rendezvous with anyway. This idea is from a Larry Niven
short story.

  I would strongly support the thesis that the OTU does leave everything
except weapons of mass destruction to the member worlds; the Navy (both
Imperial & its\' Colonial adjuncts) is the only genuinely significant
military power in the Imperium*, and getting stuck in administering
things that the Imperium has chosen to avoid is a non-starter.

 (* _not_ political - if a sector decides to start ignoring the 3I then 
what can be done? The SAR may not have been a bad solution, and it may
have been only when the rats started getting naughty that both a reason
and a justification for a decade long campaign of suppression appeared;
the rest of the 3I almost certainly paid increased taxes to fund the SRW).

  Where I start wondering about "arms control" is when it becomes obvious
that any starship, and virtually any ship, period, is a strategic "weapon
of mass destruction" in Traveller. As recently pointed out it only requires
so many G-turns for the shattering of small planetoids to become practical,
and without an explicit L-Hyd usage for a reaction drive any Far Trader can
deliver dozens of one ton nickel-iron slugs to the local pre-Stellar gov\'t
of choice.

  Hmm, 200 such slugs, a full thrust course from Jupiter to Terra, deploy
and Jump at the erstwhile turn-over point, and what happens to Mr. Gates? :>

I second *and* third this motion.  Actually, I could live without the CD.
IMHO, you shouldn\'t need anything more than the rules, six-sided dice, a
legal pad and imagination to play an RPG.  Of course, sourcebooks and
spreadsheets do make things nice - especially if you\'re a gearhead or just
an addict for details.  Moreover, I\'d be slap happy if Miller just
republished all the CT stuff as is.

 Certainly, but I was refering specifically to the Samurai and their lords,
not the entire culture of Shogunate Japan.
 If by carefully chosen statements, messages and
actions, none of which were individually dishonorable to use, you could goad
an enemy into a mistake in court or on the field of battle that would bring
about his death, suicide, or loss of honor or station, then you won.

 My line above about stealth applies much more clearly to the Aslan,
actually...

Where\'s the 2300 list?

I forwarded this \'cos it was interesting, rather than because it was right.
 I\'ve read the fine print - there\'s some pretty loopy stuff in there.  They
seem strangely bothered by France.  Apparently they\'re a little too
independent of US foreign policy.

Actually, there has been a certain amount of schmoozing going on between
Russia and China of late.  I think it\'s because they\'re both losers and
weren\'t invited to the party.  Anti-American here more or less means not
supporting bombing Iraq or Serbia, and not doing what the IMF says.

Remember, these guys are probably ex-CIA.  They might be prone to see
threats where other people wouldn\'t.

Really?  Do you think that the parents who do that are capable of
seeing any difference between D+D  and  other  RPGs?  I  remember
when I was in high school in Canada my principle gave in and  put
a blanket ban on  _all_  RPGs  on  school  property  (even  after
class) and closed the official school  gaming  club.  Rule  books
(etc) were subject to instant confiscation.

(I also remember all us \'rebellious\' gamer-types  abandoning  our
homework in favour of memorising every RPG table ... in D+D,  CT,
etc ... so we could continue without needing rule books  present.
Ah, those  were  the  days  ...  gamers  with  a  real  sense  of
commitment!)

Parents who scream about demon  worship  in  D+D  do  so  out  of
ignorance.  So be prepared for  that  ignorance  to  extend  into
game system \'differentiation\' (or lack of it).

I\'m coming to this thread a little late but according to  my  WWF
atlas ... biomes, realms and regions are as follows:

    "Biomes are ecological regions, defined in terms of their
    plant and animal life, and usually  identified  with  the
    prevailing vegetation types.  UNESCO  has  designated  14
    major  biomes,  distributed  across  eight   zoographical
    realms: the Nearctic, the  Neotropical,  the  Palearctic,
    the Afrotropical, the Indomalayan,  the  Australian,  the
    Oceanian and the Antarctic."



    Major Biomes:

    - Tundra communities and barren arctic deserts

    - Temperate needleleaf forests or woodlands

    - Temperate broadleaf forests or woodlands and  sub-polar
      deciduous thickets

    - Temperate grasslands

    - Cold winter (continental) deserts and semi-deserts

    - Evergreen Sclerophyllous forests, scrub or woodlands

    - Tropical grasslands and savanna

    - Warm deserts and semi-deserts

    - Tropical dry or deciduous  forests  (including  monsoon
      forests) or woodlands

    - Sub-tropical and temperate rainforests or woodlands

    - Tropical humid forests

    - Mixed  mountain  and  highland  systems  with   complex
      zonation

    - Mixed island systems

    - River and lake systems



    Climatic Regions:

    - Polar (ice cap and tundra)

    - Cooler humid (subarctic and continental)

    - Warmer humid (Marine west coast, humid sub-tropical and
      Mediterranean)

    - Dry (steppe and desert)

    - Tropical humid (savanna and rain forest)

I can cash cheques drawn on Canadian or American banks, or International

Yup, but I\'ve always taken that to mean blade weapons and sidearms, not
things like assault rifles.

And if a noble uses (or loses) the weapon, they may be subject to Imperial
justice, or to some local laws.

mines for arms smuggling. Seems the chap who bought that last sidearm paid
you to lose it...

I don\'t run a formal club*. 

I\'ve been tinkering with a new 101 book: 101 Lessons. While the BITS
marketing department doesn\'t feel there\'s enough market to make this a
viable product, I think we could probably manage a PDF file on the BITS
website. Besides, the marketing department\'s better half is a teacher :-)

Anyone interested in working together to create some science fiction
resources, tips, etc for teachers?


*This is because, if I _do_ run a formal club for a couple of years, I
could be _required_ to do so forever. With the present government
situation here, I\'m being very careful to leave myself manuevering room.

Over the holidays I read somewhere ("New Scientist" I think, but am not
certain) than deep-rock bacteria may well have more biomass than any other
lifeform. 

We definately need to include alien biomes, especially for other
biochemistries. 

Also, many Earth biomes were very different before grass. We should
include these for planets where plants never incorporated silica needles
into themselves - that mutation radically changed Earth.

One interesting factoid I\'d never thought about;  A 500 kph wind on a
planet with an atmosphere 1/10th the density of Earth\'s would only have as
much "push" as a 50 kph wind at Earth\'s atmospheric pressure for most
purposes.

By the way, anyone know the difference between "sublimation" and "evaporation"?

during this time period?

What races might be encountered as members of a vessel\'s crew?

What races might be used in a military fashion against the enemy?

What races were on the side of the Terrans?

What races were on the side of the Vilani?

What races were caught in the crossfire?

What of the Bwaps?  The Tahavi?

By canon, we know that the Aslan didn\'t have jump drive capacity at 
this time, and the Vargr were waaayyyyy on the other side of the Ziru 
Sirka, hitting the Vilani on their coreward side.

I don\'t recall  reading of any Hiver, K\'kree, or Droyne involvement
in the IWs, or with the Ziru Sirka for that matter. 

It sounds kinda boring if it\'s just the Humans beating each other up,

Evaporation is the transition of state of matter from a liquid phase 
to a gaseous phase.  A good example would be the evaporation of water 
spilled on the concrete sidewalk on a warm, summer\'s day.

Sublimation is the transition of state of matter from a solid phase 
directly to a gaseous phase (skipping the usual liquid phase 
in-between.)  Rare under normal (Terran) conditions (room temp, 1 
atm), but a good example of an exception is dry ice, which goes from 
a solid state directly to a gaseous state at room temp.

Don\'t want to bore you with the specific details.  Hope this helps.

Greetings fellow technophiles.

I was wondering last night about the Meson Screens in G:T.  I was
wondering if there were TL-11 or TL-13 versions.  So I went to my drawing
board and tried to reverse engineer the things.  Using Vehicles as a guide
I found out that the meson screen seems to be a new species of  animal in
and of themselves.

Using 20,800,000 DR/sf as a guide these numbers seem to be the best match
for a "basic" 1DR/sf unit:

TL-12 Meson Screen   0.004lbs   0.1cr    0.001kw

At first I thought it was the TL-12 Force Screen with DR x10, until I
noticed that the price is justabit different.

Results of using these numbers:

20.8MegaDR = 8320lbs (4.16t)  2.08Mcr   208,000kw
As no volume is listed, I am assuming the thing may be mounted in a pop
turret, therefore
V=wt/20 or 416cf

Power requirement:  20,800kw of TL-12 fusion slice  4160lbs(2.08t)  41.6cf
104,000cr

Total unit: 457.6cf(1 space)   6.24t   2.184Mcr

Now I am not too clear on the rules for pop turrets  but I am assuming
that they\'re going to add some more mass, volume, and cost to the thing,
hopefully within 42.4cf.  But from what I can see this is pretty close to
the things in the GT book.  Has anyone else played with these things?  How
close am I?  Is it good enough for Imperial governmnet work? :-)

Some  more questions.  How small can a Meson Screen be?  The GT rules
would seem to indicate that even a fighter could have one.  At 1 space a
10ton fighter could resist 10400DR vs. Mesons (yikes!)

Also, there are no rules for creating the Black/White globes, yet.  I am
wondereing if we should just use the Force Screen tables at face value.
The descriptions in Vehicles seem to fit with how the traveller versions
work anyway.

So suggestions, comments, criticisms from my fellow gearheads?

But, remember, one new component has been added to the mix today: we
are the parents!  Seriously, many of us who have been gaming Traveller
since the CT days are now the parents of middle schoolers, myself
included.  If my sixth-grader said she wanted to join a gaming club
I\'d be all for it, obviously.  She is already a sci-fi fan (I wonder
how that happened?) so, after explaining the good and bad, right and
wrong of gaming based on our family code of morality, I\'d encourage
her.  IMO, the ignorance should be diminishing.  But what do I know!

The other possibility is that Phobos was hit with a smaller explosive
device that *slowed it down* enough to cause it to fall from orbit.

Orbital mechanists may correct me, but wouldn\'t it be possible to explode a
somewhat smaller warhead on the (correct) surface of Phobos and reduce the
orbital velocity below that threshhold which allows it to freefall while
"missing" the planet?

Of course, I may be whistling in the dark if the amount of energy required
(in one explosion) is as much as (or exceeds) that which would blow the
thing apart.

I seem to recall that the amount of energy to blow the moon out of its
orbit (ala Space 1999) was more than the moon could endure without blowing
apart.  Of course, then there\'s the amount required to propel it at speeds
large enough to travel to other planets...

This has great Traveller applications; Instead of a near-C rock from the
outer system or Oort cloud, just detonate a nuke on the surface of that
small moon to bring it down.  I\'m sure that enough study and computer
calculations would be able to put it right on top of the deep meson site
(then again you probably need not get that close).

Sublimination is going directly from a solid to a gas while evaporation
is going fom a liquid to a gas. CO2 sublimates - as fas as I know, CO2
never liquifies at standard pressure - it\'s either a gas or a solid.

Fair point - the reason I mentioned it is that it has good b&W art.

Hmm. Not sure - I\'d have to go through the books and get an idea. However,
I would argue that the MT layout and material was amongst the best in any
RPG. Clear and professional. I wouldn\'t want to see more.

I\'d love to see something like Jesse\'s Grendel\'s Daughter Free Trader Pic
used for T5\'s cover.

It\'s been tried.  Ship B disappears, never to be seen again.

Same thing happens if you launch something like a fighter while in Jump space, 
IIRC.  Either way, it\'s a good way to discover the truth behind 
reincarnation...

Er, my mistake.  Ship *A* disappears.  Ship B comes out where it was supposed 
to.

Quick, someone hand me a beer!  I think my head is swelling with all the
great comments I\'ve gotten on my Traveller pics.  Oh shit, it\'s only 10am
here in California......It\'s gotta\' be 5PM somewhere in the world, where\'s
the bar?

Thanks Dom!  I have plans to pitch Marc on useing stuff, but I\'ve got to get
the G:T stuff done first.  Once that\'s done and nothing else is in the pipe,
I\'ll start work on my masterpiece to knock his socks off and into LEO :)

(c) Kzinti must be really, really, really stupid. The Kzin had reactionless
gravity drives capable of hundred-G accelerations, while the humans had
only fusion rockets - and contrary to Niven, a fusion rocket makes a terrible
space combat weapon, especially against anyone who has ten times your
acceleration. The Kzinti could have used kinetic-energy weapons
to sterilize Earth any time they wanted...fortunately, as you said, the
Kzin wanted slaves, not a wasteland.

I would suggest that this is a IYTU decision.  There is no "Canon" to back
up directly any statement/assumption.

Of course, there is the fact that someone (Naval Research?) must have
thought of doing this and tried it, but since there is no mention of the
results you can probably infer that they failed.

In my own TU, in the above example, both ships A and B would never be heard
from again.  No wreckage, no signal, just never emerge from Jumpspace.

This allows me to come up with what happened when I get around to it, and
denies the least number of possibilities.

  I just get worried by stuff that looks roughly as useful as an embassy
advisory (Spain good, backwoods of anywhere with an on-going insurgency
Bad - what a surprise!). I really hope that they went into detail as to
the fact that "Anti-American alliance" here really means that they\'re 
both bitching through diplomatic channels about the US, but they\'d both 
much rather see the other lose relative power first.

  To a certain extent it may simply be that there\'s brownie points to be
gained here at Anglo-American expense, and both of them expect to be net
importers of petroleum products before too long, last I\'d heard. There\'s
also the fact that pandering to the Arab/Islamic (plus Iran, of course)
audience may increase their influence in the former SSR\'s of central Asia.

  But allies? About as likely as the K\'kree and Aslan getting together :)

I would think that A\'s attempt to enter Jump would fail without disastrous side
effects.
Its already in jump space.  So you couldn\'t even charge the lanthanum grid.
A would just sit there like a lump.  I don\'t see why the jump drive of A would
work at all.
Am I missing something?

Even the most modern air-air missiles follow this sequence - the IRIS-T;
AIM-9X and ASRAAM are all short range, IR homing missiles (with far from
primitive seekers - ASRAAM can be told to choose what part of the target
it hits); while AMRAAM, the improved AMRAAM and Meteor are all active
radar medium range missiles.

Sure, you can see an aircraft-sized target. Now look at the example in
question - resolving human sized targets; engine blocks on vehicles; and
even a cigarette from space? Even assuming a low-earth orbit satellite
(bringing with it narrow field of view and short view times for any
particular target), you are looking at 100 miles up.

In the book, the imagery was not real time, and was from a
photoreconaissance satellite. In the film, the imagery was realtime and
from a thermal imagery satellite.

Further, if ship A has two seperate jump drives installed, performs a
jump, and sometime during the week fires up the second jump drive,
it is also never seen again.

As far as I know, canon is silent on this, which is a good thing.

Personally, if my PCs found themselves in a situation like this I might use
it as a way to introduce time travel or travel to alternate dimensions. As
an example, PCs might find themselves in the Wilds in the New Era, or the
Regency, or maybe somewhere during the Terran/Ziru Sirka wars. On the other
hand, it might be interesting to transport the PCs to somewhere far, far
away in the galaxy. Possibly somewhere simply disorienting (deep in Hiver
territory), hostile (deep in K\'Kree territory), enlightening (deep in
Zhodani territory), bizarre (one of the various "fringe" sectors from old
third party CT materials), or just completely new and unheard of...

Of course, if the PCs aren\'t involved, YMMV.

However, some excellent ideas from the list in the past may serve to spark
your imagination. Someone mentioned once that J-Space might be an Ancient
artifact. Of course, it can be an Artifact from precursors of the Ancients
(not canonical, but maybe some even older race "built" J-Space, kind of like
the interstellar "subway" in Contact).

Of course, it could just be a common or garden misjump.

BTW: Erwin Fritz, was it you who designed the Rorani and asked me to draw
it? I came across some sketches in my sketch book and I could finish them up
if you still need them.

The Kzinti stole their technology.  They are not a race of thinkers or
inventers.  They are wariors and little more than that.  They can run the
machines they stole and duplicate them using these same machines but
deprived of the stolen tech. they are fur covered cave men.  The beings they
stole their tech. from stole it from an older race that was enslaved by
another low tech. race that were powerful telepaths and dominated them.
That race wiped out most life in the galaxy in a civil war 1 million + years
before mankind evolved.  The tech. controled by that telepathic race was so
great the some of that race survive in indistructable time bubbles.  They
are so feared by the few humans that know of their existance that any action
is justified in killing the few of that race that survived.  The Man-Kzin
books are very conspiracy theory heavy.  The secret masters are try to keep
the lid on entirely to many boiling pots.  It\'s a good series.

Nope. IIRC, IR, in this context means a IR detector with a big IR
searchlight on it. It is an active sensor, relying on reflected
radiation, whereas Thermal Imaging is a passive sensor, relying on
emitted radiation. I\'ve seen these, some of the old \'starlight\' scopes
also had big IR lamps on them for operation in \'no-light\' vs \'low-light\'
situations.

Yeah. though things are going to be weird at first, when Terrans
encounter Vargr.  They\'ll speak just enough of each other\'s body
language to _really_ mess things up. Remember, humans and canines ahve
lived together in packs for at least 40,000 years, long enough for
significant evolution to have occured on both sides. (perhaps it\'s
longer...just the other day I read that there is at least one genetic
divergence study that shows that domestic dogs and wolves seem to have
diverged over 100,000 years ago. If that\'s the case, we\'ve been living
with them for a heck of a long time.)

Your methodology appears sound at first glance, but I\'m not sure that I\'d agree
with the premise.  We hashed this out once on the list back in 1991 or so, and
came to the conclusion that any vehicle intended to face a threat force with a
reasonable 9plug in your favorite estimate) grav vehicle contingent couldn\'t
really depend on having a preferred orientation to the threat -- with the possible
exception of the underside which you could always keep to the ground.  Therefore,
having armor the same thickness all around was not unreasonable, and I believe
I cited at the time something I\'d read regarding the US M1 tank, which was facing
the 2-D version of that problem, since it was designed with heavy front armor, but
was now expected to face an all around threat in the current doctrinal environment,
thus showing that real military thinkers were working along the same line of logic
as the TML. (-:

Note that those rules are hardly official (nor are they specifically targeted
at Traveller, though there is enough information to create a sort of black
globe generator).  There are aspects to the canonical black globe which are
very hard to imitate in GURPS (actually, they don\'t make a whole lot of sense
in Traveller either), because GURPS capacitors can absorb huge amounts of power
and can get rid of it really fast.  A one displacement ton capacitor in GURPS
is about 25 tons weight and can absorb the energy from three shots from the
standard spinal meson gun, and you can radiate that energy back out again at an
incredible rate.

Note that FF&S seemed to cheat on the black globe issues by limiting the black
globe capacitors/HPGs to throughput equal to their capacitance per space combat
turn, which makes _no_ sense but does make overloading screens viable.

  Has anybody else noticed something funny about these TL conversions? I
was under the impression, that (Traveller)TL-8 was supposed to be what we
have today. (GURPS)TL-8 is most certainly not this. GURPS High Tech ends
at GTL-7, and GURPS Ultra Tech begins at GTL-8.

  Another thing I\'m not too sure about is (T)TL-16 = (G)TL-13. Looking at
older Traveller products the leap from TL-15 to 16 doesn\'t seem to be that
big, whereas in GURPS the difference between TL-12 and 13 is a huge one.
With portable antimatter weapons viable AM power and living metal (to
mention just a few) GTL-13 is getting dangerously close to sufficiently
advanced technology. I\'d thing the very first stages of GTL-13 would
appear at Traveller TL-17. (FF&S1 puts the first antimatter power plants
at TL-17 IIRC.)

I forgot to mention:

For those of you just digging into GURPS Vehicles (for building GURPS
Traveller vehicles, of course!), there is a whole host of extensions by
Jonathan Lang and MA Lloyd on GURPSNet which add quite a bit to the book.
Go to:

http://www.io.com/GURPSnet/Archive/Vehicles/Construction/V2ad/

Simply perusing the archive at:

http://www.io.com/GURPSnet/Archive/Vehicles/Construction

Can also get you some signifcant ideas.

There are also many, many designs in the archive. Go to:

and select your flavor.

Naval Architects Manual, I would believe. A small booklet in the Star

BTW I totally agree, that the said design sequence is seriously flawed.
I only ever designed a few small ships with it, and it was sheer hell all

Nope, but I am working on the Galactic work ups for Daibei & Alderan...  If

Shrug.  According to classic traveller I should be flying around in a grav raft

Actually, the conversion should be that (GTL) 11 is traveller TL 14-16 or so --
GTL 11 includes early force fields and antimatter power plants, by TL 12 you
have personal deflector shields, vehicular antimatter power plants and
weaponry, and a few other technologies.

The technology conversion was the subject of significant complaints during the
original playtest, which were apparently mostly ignored.

I don\'t think it is in jump space. Ship A is in a pocket of real space,
contained in jump space.

Well, the one thing I thought of was that you couldn\'t give program accurate
jump coordinates into ship A\'s computer, because you don\'t know where, in real
space, you are. So you\'d be guaranteed a misjump, at the very least.

Anyone read Frederick Pohl\'s Gateway? I\'d probably play it like that. You count
up how much food you have, and divide by two. If you haven\'t emerged from jump
space by then, you start drawing lots for suicides.

I could use them for my library manual, but the urgency\'s gone. One of my PCs
adopted one as a pet. However, due to an unfortunate boarding incident with some
LSP troopers, the Roran died.

Depends how strong they are.  At the levels in Traveller, not really.  In order
to stop conventional (not ETC or gauss) bullets with a field a meter deep, you
would need 30-50 thousand Gs.  High velocity gauss weapons might require a
million Gs or more.

It is useful as an anti-riot measure, though.

IMTU, I\'d warn the intrepid astrogator that this move has never been 
recorded in the 1k+ years of Imperial Interstellar Exploration History. 
If they really want to try it I\'d say "Roll 2d6 and pray."
(NO skill will help this one!)
2=both ships are destroyed in an incredible display of jumpspace 
pyrotechnics.
7=ship b is thrown out of jumpspace early (misjump), ship a never 
finished the shift into hyperspace.
12=one serious misjump to God only knows where (but they\'d be alive...)

An unlearned observation:

8Gs is only 80 m/s or so, so the 12 cm KEAP round doing 3,600 m/s will now
only hit you at 3,520 m/s.

I don\'t think it\'ll help much, and it\'d be cheaper/less mass/less energy to
just layer on a little more superdense.

In SJG\'s current _Murphy\'s Rules_ compilation, the following rule
appears on page 36:

   "Sitting In Times Square, Waiting For The Ball To Drop"

In Steve Jackson Games\' GURPS, the basic set of rules tells us that
Technology LEVEL 8 begins on JAN. 1, 2000.  At his time such items as
human cloning, powerful EXOSKELETAL SUITS, pistol sized LASER WEAPONS,
and immensely powerful CYBORGS ALL become AVAILABLE!  [all-cap items are
boldface in original]

(The illustration shows two men, one in a mundane suit, and the other in
what appears to be a vacc suit.  The one in the vacc suit is saying,
"Hold on, my watch says that I\'m due for a technological revolution in
30 seconds!")

This points out quite nicely the fact that tech levels are arbitrary
conventions used by statisticians, and not real things. :-) TLs don\'t
change abruptly, they flow into one another. A civiliation rated at a very
early TL 8 can appear *completely* different one that is rated at a very
advanced TL 8.

Potential plot hooks are, of course, left to the readers\' own imaginations. :-)

You\'re already in jumpspace, so whatever the lanthanum gird and jumpdrive
does when it starts up in normal space won\'t work.  I\'m not jump engineer,
but it seems to me that jump drives \'warp\' normal space/time.  They\'re
designed to warp normal space into jumpspace.

If thats true, and it is for MTU, not that this has ever come up, then the jump
drive is _not_ designed to warp jump space into jump space.  There is
no normal space for the jump drive to do its magic to.  No normal space to
grab and then to subsequently bend.

Ok, ok, I see it coming.  The ship is in a normal space bubble that is inside
jump space.  I say so what?

Does a jump drive \'connect\' and entry point and and exit point?
Or does it simply point you in a certain direction, and then drop you
out of jump after a certain amount of time?.

If it \'connects,\' then real space bubble or no, there is nothing to connect to
at
the other end.

If it just pushes you into jumpspace for a certain amount of time, well, then
maybe
Ka-Boom, but I think I can twist my way out of that corner.

Jump space and normal space exist \'side-by-side\' in the universe.
A jump drive cuts off a bubble of normal space and pushes it into and through
jump space.  Whatever is in the bubble is no longer in normal space, but is
rather in jumpspace, albeit bubbled.

When something is in jumpspace, its in jumpspace, bubble or no.
So, it cannot push into jumpspace because its already there.

If you change the metaphor from bubbles to holes, then maybe I agree,
a hole being a rip in the \'fabric\' meaning that its a gap in the relevant
material, i.e.,
a hole in jumpspace would have no jumpspace in it and nothing in jump could
go through it.  Whereas a bubble doesn\'t rip the fabric, but rather, pushes
through
and around it.

Now if that real world bubble in jump space can only be created in normal space
and then pushed into jumpspace, trying to create another bubble, within the
bubble
jumpspace won\'t work because the hardware just isn\'t capable of grabbing onto
enough normal space to do the trick.

Boy oh boy thats a mess, but it makes sense to me.

From Survival Margin (p55) (a TNE book):
(\'TNS\' is a Traveller News Service reporter.  IK is Ililek Kuligaan,
defected former head of one of Dulinor\'s intelligence services)

TNS:  Yes, well, having already alienated Archduke Dulinor, you have now,
rightly or wrongly, incurred the wrath, deadly wrath, some will point out,
of 17 powerful intelligence organizations by my count, including Imperial
Naval Intelligence, Naval Counter-Intelligence, the Imperial Ministries of
Information and Justice, IRIS, the Vermene-
....
[the Vermene, of course, are the Tukera lines security organisation - that
is they are the private security service of a chunk of the nobility!]
....
IK:  First of all, I should like to point out that these enemies are not so
powerful as everyone imagines.  Were they half so powerful as everyone
believed, the Imperium would not have disintegrated into the state in which
we find it today.
....
IK:  And what do they [Intelligence agencies] tell their rulers?  Exactly
what they already know their rulers want to hear.  ...  And with each
intelligence organization whispering this same lie [victory is around the
corner] into the ear of each faction leader, how is this war to reach an
end.  It will reach its end over our dead bodies.
....
IK:  ... they became experts at bureaucratic infighting, at fighting for
their agendas within the government, and not at diligently searching for
the truth, not at courageously reporting unpleasant truths to their
superiors....

OK, this is *not* an impartial account.  (And I left lots out, and still
probably overquoted!)  By this view, the Imperial intelligence services do
exhibit the negative characteristics Matt suggested.  But then again, it\'s
an unbalanced account, and usually they probably aren\'t this bad. 

During the FFW, there was infighting between Naval Intelligence and the
pro-Santanocheev Office of Naval Information, according to Spinward Marches
Campaign (CT).

Well, I\'m glad we got something useful out of the post I forwarded.  I
hoped it might amuse someone, but apparently not...  <sigh>

Here we go.  This works for me.  Your jump drive can\'t work because you
can\'t focus it on any real space to depart.

I think I\'ll use it as a left-handed monkey wrench that grizzled old
engineers
send novices off for.

"Spacehand Jones.  Get in the jump shuttle, fire up the jump drive and jump
back to Regina.  Get my left handed monkey wrench from my desk at the
Naval base, and then jump back here.  I forgot to grab it before we
entered jump space.  And don\'t let me catch you without that wrench!

AFAIK, 2300 came from 1st edition T2000. 2300 was written in 1988 according
to the box, and therefore predated T2000 2nd edition by several years :)

Nope, just a big honking laser, being used directly as a photon drive. 
Ship was named the _Angel\'s Pencil_ -- long, thin drive/service core with
lifesystem in a rotating ring around the midsection.  Only Ian Banks has
better ship names than Niven. :)

Actually, *none* of the Kzinti survived the engagement, and the ship was

and discover just how big a problem they\'d stumbled onto...

Actually, when Basic was put out we were condsidered to be at GTL 7.
We are generally considered to be currently in transition from GTL 7 to GTL 8.

Hmmm, you might try asking Zane Healy, he might be able to do it.  Oh, wait

Illustrator 5.5, or ClarisWorks 4.0 depending on how well they can be cut

Glad you enjoyed it; I didn\'t, really, despite many glowing
recommendations.  Found the characters mostly wooden, the politics and
motivations far-fetched; the physical setting and science were nice, but
that didn\'t make up for its failings as a story.  Read all of \'Red\' and a
third of \'Green\' before giving up with a sigh.

> By the way, anyone know the difference between "sublimation" and

Sublimation is a direct phase change from solid to gas.  What solid carbon
dioxide ("dry ice") does at 1 atm and room temperature is the most
familiar example.  It\'s "dry" because it has no liquid phase at 1 atm.
Evaporation is a phase change from liquid to gas.

Until the players realize that, while computer games have AIs that limit
their actions, RPGs have far fewer constraints.  (At least, I know that
_I_ have been frustrated by computer games that wouldn\'t let me try what
I wanted to try.  I\'m always willing to accept that I may fail, but
dammit, let me _try_!)

Actually, according to the classic Traveller material in front of me we
should already have: air/rafts and GCarriers, our energy sources should be
fusion, and we will have perfected weather control. Mind you, these would
not be new technologies! The newest would have been invented 9 or 10 years
ago!

Now, in addition, we\'d already have or soon will have: laser rifles, ablat,
beam lasers, reactionless drives A through D, and limb regeneration. Our
scientists had better get cracking, though! We only have a year (or two, if
you\'re going to be technical) to get these technologies out!

However, we won\'t see cloning until TL 13, which is above average Imperial.
That could be quite awhile.

Yeah, I know the cloning issue has been handwaved with the Vilani/Solomani
thing. It still makes me laugh a bit though.

So here\'s my question concerning _Traveller_ TLs:

Classic Traveller and T4 are exactly the same with their TL scales, which
would put us currently at TL9. However, MT and TNE use a modified scale,
which puts us firmly in the middle of TL 8. Which one of these is right?

Personally, I\'ll take the GURPS TL system at the moment, since it _is_ the
only one that doesn\'t seem terribly broken.

Let\'s see, also according to GURPS, contragravity and reactionless thrusters
don\'t appear until quite a bit later. Of course, it was a simple matter for
Loren to move the development up a bit to cover this. At the same time, no
force fields (other than black globes and white globes) exist _at all_ in
the Traveller Universe. Several other technologies that are listed in
various GURPS books don\'t exist either.

IMHO, good thing. The way the TL conversion comes out for me is fine.

By WHAT plasma weapons?  Any SMART ship would run from the pack and leave

You\'re talking about a RPG, "dude"!  Since when are you LOCKED IN to the

I DIDN\'T outline a "howl and run" tactic, my reading

No one said that they had to stand off at a "pot shot" distance with targets
on their chests when they "howled".  Besides, making a speaker out of the
ship may give them the time they need to close the distance.

They wouldn\'t be the only ones whose forces would be dwindling.  And who is

been made?  You, I guess.

Sure, but I had said that military units tend to have SOP\'s, standard

damned silly rituals.  Have you ever seen an "ADJUTANT\'S CALL"?  I couldn\'t
even wring the story behind it out of either of my S-1\'s when I was in the

So you are saying that roaches have a high degree of sentient intelligence?

HEAVY DUTY equipment would be a better description.  I don\'t think a thud

it qualifies as "nifty."

That would be contrary to the canonical treatment that jumpspace is a set of
alternate dimensions that don\'t normally apply (in a known way) to the normal
universe.   See the Imperial Encyclopedia and the article on Jumpspace by one
Marc Miller (on Kagehira\'s AAB) or the SOM for a more in-depth theory.  I seem
to remember somewhere else, too, but can\'t seem to remember from where.  What
the jump drive does is put u in those alternate dimensions (which have their
own properties).  What you\'re talking bout my make for a good sci fi ftl, but
it is not a Traveller jump drive.   This is even ignoring the whole lanthanum
grid thing (you could just substitute lanthanum "coil" for "grid," after all).
: ) 

Now, as for our hypothetical, it shouldn\'t normally have a beneficial effect,
under normal circumstances, or it would be a relatively common procedure (and
thus defined).  Maybe u could get a Quasispace thing that Star Control 2 had
layered onto Hyperspace, but you need a specially calibrated drive or... boom.
Or no boom today, but boom tommorrow.  ; )

I always enjoy this discussion - it brings up so *many* humorous points!

Most people argue that either nothing will happen, or that it will be a
disaster once the jump field forms.  I\'d like to posit that it *will*
generally be a disaster, but that the field will never get the chance to
form.  Let us consider:

1) Jumping takes energy.  A *lot* of energy!  The fuel consumed is, in CT
terms, enough to power the ship for at least a year under normal usage.
Someone else can work up the figures, but under any incarnation of
Traveller, the Jump Drive uses the majority of the fuel available in a ship
(and therefore, the majority of the energy available to the ship) in a very
short period of time.

2) It has become pretty much accepted that the Lanthanum grid is used to
open the portal to J-space and give the ship the vector it needs to travel
through J-space.  I would assume then that the energy that the J-Drive
generates is put on the grid in such a fashion to accomplish this.

Now, as a Navy veteran, one of the first things you learn aboard ship is how
to drink.  The *second* thing you learn is to stay away from the antennas
with the red bases and from the radar dishes.  The red base on an antenna
indicates that it\'s a transmitter, and everyone knows what us crazy
Firecontrolmen do to seagulls with the ships radars... ;)  For the rest of
ya - radiant energy burns.  Think of the jokes about wet poodles and
microwave ovens.  The effect is similar.  And the most powerful radar on a
ship uses a relatively minor portion of the ship\'s available energy (it\'s
still a lot, just not relative to the *total* energy use of a ship.)

Back to Jumping - Ship B is sitting in the (hanger, launch tube or hull
grapple and/or cargo hold) and starts to power up the J-Drive.  Lots and
lots of energy is transformed from fuel to whatever the J-Drive creates and
is dumped onto the grid and *transmitted*.

What happens?

A lot is going to depend on the environment that ship B is in.  Is the
environment pressurized?  We just had a wonderful thread not to long ago
about jumping from an atmosphere.  My personal belief is that once the
energy field exceeds the dialectric value of the atmosphere, you are going
to get arcing between the grids.  Additionally, the hullmetal that the ship
is in proximity to probably makes a great conductor, and even if it is not
being used as a return path for shipboard circuitry (which would allow Ship
B to dump it\'s energy directly into the main power return for Ship A\'s
reactors), it will still allow for arcing between Ship B and Ship A when the
path to Ship A (possibly through any connection points between ship A and B,
such as docking grapples, landing claw, etc.) is shorter than the space
between the grid.  The energy in the field will be, if you are lucky,
drained off in the process of welding Ship A and B together (or vaporizing
significant portions of the hull) - otherwise the J-field isn\'t going to be
*anything* like what you would expect.

Additionally, while the field is still forming - atmosphere or no - it will
be expanding.  While there is a great deal of debate on what the effective
radius of the J-field is, that is to say how much N-Space environment is
maintained around the ship, I think it would be safe to say that the field
actually extends quite a distance from the ship beyond it\'s effective
radius.  It is very well established that when a field grows and shrinks
relative to a stationary conductor, it transfers energy from the field to
the conductor - that is how transformers work.  So you generate this honking
big field either inside a ship, or in proximity to the hull and you are
going to directly transfer energy from the J-field to the
power/data/structure of the mother ship.  So, the hull or internal structure
of Ship A is going to be energized.  Again, if the return path for ship\'s
power is through the hull (I would assume that it will be), then this power
is going to be shunted into the ship\'s electronics and power systems.  If it
is not, then all the portions of Ship A that are in \'conduction\' are going
to be energized to a high extent.  Those portions of the ship that are
\'insulated\' from Ship B will not.  This will leave an area between the two
portions of the ship that have and energized conductor on one side,
separated from a non-energized conductor by (ahem) a dielectric.  This, by
the way, is a fundemental definition for a basic electrical component - a
capacitor.  And when something passes between the two conductors and allows
it to discharge...  (also, if the field exceeds the value of the dialectric,
you will get arcing within Ship A similar to what was described in the above
paragraph.)  Again, the effects on the mother ship are not going to be
pleasant, and the J-field, assuming it forms at all, is going to be *very*
different that what the astrogator would expect.

As the field grows, it will also affect the personnel in Ship A.  You will
be exposing them to the raw energy that far exceeds anything that a radio
antenna or radar dish puts out.  The only question whether the Vargr or
Aslan preferred their human cooked or raw...

All this before we even start discussing how the high-power initial field
generated by Ship B (to breach the barrier between N-Space and J-space) will
affect the relatively low-power \'maintenance\' field of Ship A, whether or
not the J-fields are in phase, out of phase and how that would affect them,
how the ship\'s artificial gravity would affect the forming of the J-field,
etc...

There is no 1371.  Move along.  Do not discuss this.  All that is important
is that we were never here, this never happened, and 1371 never existed,
right?

Please look into the little red light...

no, that\'s a function of language.  Modern English to be exact, coming from

Clif, one of the first lessons at the Infantry School is that standing out
is bad.  I was a sniper.  My first priority is the radioman.  My second
target is anybody who looks like he\'s in charge.  Ever hear the Infantry
Motto, "follow Me!"?  Imagine the result in morale when the LT jumps up,
screams that stirring slogan, and immediately gets several new holes in his
face and chest.

Screaming and taunting your foes is great when they can\'t hit you.  The
*only* modern force that makes use of such an effect is the Highlander
Regiments, who still bring pipers to the field.

I have, three times.  When did we get into space?  You seem to be wavering
back and forth to whatever position best supports your odd theory.  In
space, I simply turn off my radio.  No howl.  On the ground, I use that
howl to warn everyone that the Vargr attack is imminent.  Hint from an
11B1V:  announcing you are about to attack is generally a bad thing.  The
NK/Chinese found this out in 1951, when American soldiers and Marines would
be alerted by the whistles and trumpets used to coordinate activities in
the radioless PLA.  Yes, they had nightmares about those trumpets, but they
were home,e alive to have those dreams.

And warn the victims that they were locked?  Why?  We are talking about an
intelligent race.  If they want to kill a ship, they are going to use the
most effective means at their disposal.  There might be Vargr cultures that
would consider giving fair warning, but this wouldn\'t be a racial trait.

I feel compelled to point out that howling is how wolves in the wild talk
to each other.  Biologists have identified many distinct calls, mostly of a
territorial nature.  Attacking wolves are silent, as not to startle prey.

Ah.  The personal attacks begin.  Lovely.

We are discussing the Vargr, a game construct that has been around since
about 1980.  We know that the Vargr have been in contact with humaniti
since the time of the First Imperium.  For every published setting, Vargr
and humans have a long history.

Read up on Patton\'s early battles against Rommel.  Patton got ahold of
Rommel\'s book, "The Tank in the Attack", and based his defenses on what he
learned about Rommel\'s thought processes.  Kicked Nazi butt.

There is a world of difference between an Army facility where you run
against other Americans playing the OPFOR, and being in a situation where
people with guns are trying very hard to kill you.  Trust me, you do not
howl, you just thank God that you didn\'t die today, and hope that you don\'t
die tomorrow.

You keep going back and forth between space and ground..

OK, this "howl ray" can turn the entire ship into a speaker, send an some
sort of audio signal through the vacuum of space, and be fired from such a
distance that the target ship can\'t respond effectively.

Makes Virus look positively plausible.

Your entire premise seems to shift as needed.  Why bother if the missiles

But that\'s not what they were designed for.  Which is what you seem to be

it\'s piss-poor fireworks.  On the enemy\'s ridge, it\'s a spectator sport.

Yet I have never been ordered to wave my arms over my head to make myself
look bigger, howl at the top of my lungs, and hurl feces to gain an
appointment to PLDS.  That is the difference.  Yes, the Army has SOP, and
those are *based on the logical needs of modern warfare and the Army
mission.*  Did you think that the Air-Land strategy just cam out of thin
air?  It\'s the evolution of everything we learned in Vietnam, along with
the known capabilities of our forces and the enemy.

No, roaches are insects.  They are nocturnal, are react poorly to light,
tending to scatter for dark areas.  The have lousy eyesight, and smell
through their knees.  They are dumber than bricks.  But they will survive
us humans, and probably whatever replaces us.

Why not?  Kafers are bigger and stronger than humans, so they can handle
heavier recoil.

You said "They basically acted like Roaches (after which they were named,
in the German)".  We have pointed out that the Kafers aren\'t anything like
roaches.  Nothing at all.  It was a nickname referring to how ugly they are
to human eyes, and their disgusting eating habits.  Their name for us
translated as "Meat Being."

>So by your previous statement, are you saying that the palmetto bugs here in

Wow.  What we have here is a Jump-7 of a divergence.

Please read carefully Clif:

In the game setting 2300AD, there is a race called by the humans "Kafer",
their name for themselves is Vah.  This race is a four-limbed, warm blooded
race descended from a scavenger/hunter species that evolved on Gamma
Serpenti-III (Ka\'ra!ah [Cruel Mother]).

This race is intelligent.  They build starships.  Palmetto bugs don\'t do
that.  This race also has a cultural fear of the "Smart Barbarian", due to
the nature of their history.  We fit the mold of the Smart Barbarian to a tee.

As far as I know, the Palmetto Bugs are not going to invade, but they could
be working for the government.  You never can tell.

I have encountered two theories about where they would end up.

1.  They end up on a planet wholly dedicated to ball-point-pen
lifeforms.

2.  They find themselves buried in an infinite number of unmatched
socks.

Okay, now take a pack of snipers who howl from the shadows and then quickly
descend with grav belts upon a village of weak, unarmed enemy sympathizers.
That\'s the vargr strategy I\'m describing.

Fine, but a surprise attack scenario I am describing hand-in-hand with the
quick convergence upon the weak target in an overwhelming pack (escorted by
volleys of armament, of course) would be benefited by an unsettling howl.

Then maybe you\'d better go jump on the Army PAO officer\'s desk at Ft.
Chaffee for saying that the OPFOR were the most highly trained soldiers in
the world?

No, I\'m not!  I am continuously talking about both.  "Stand" doesn\'t
necessarily mean "on the ground."  You can stand off at a distance, even in
space.  It\'s an expression.  "My girlfriend was a bit \'stand-offish\',
today."  That isn\'t really describing actual distance on the ground, is it?

When did I ever say that couldn\'t respond effectively?  If they had the same
sort of ray and could get the thing pointed at a vargr ship they could do
the same.  Gee whiz.  You guys must LIKE trying to put words in my mouth.

The howl is in a LASER, jerk-off!  It travels at the speed of light!  It can

They ARE like roaches in that roaches will SPEED UP when they feel

No shit!  I wasn\'t the one whose reasoning was saying that palmetto bugs are
sentient, anymore than I was saying dogs or cats are sentient, was I? What I
DID do was question the poster\'s standards of what IS sentient, which seemed
to be a rather fuzzy science for said individual (I don\'t even know his
name...).
