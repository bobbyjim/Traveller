give of sense of what goes on with range (can you tell I finally
found my copy of HG :-)

One, lasers don\'t have target agility as a DM, while sub-c weapons
do (except missiles, presumably because they can also maneuver).
Evasion (agility in HG) in reality works better at longer ranges
(all the math shows this).

Two, regarding non-evading targets, look at the section on use of
Black Globes... all fire automatically hits a BG that is on 100%.
Later it says that because the ship can\'t maneuver, it\'s position is
known because the predictions based on past movement will always be
correct. 

So even HG says you can\'t miss a non-evading target. That comment
could really be broadened to include any disabled target, (or
purposely non-evading (stations would fit this bill as well)).

BTW, I don\'t know how strictly this is adhered to in other TUs, but
HG says that mixed turrets have to be rated as one weapon, one
battery. So 2 triple mixed turrets (missile, laser, sandcaster)
would be 2 laser batteries, 2 msl, 2 sc--each with a factor for 1
weapon...

I was gonna mess with some pirate attacks using HG and Mayday, but
Mayday\'s scale is such that weapons fire is possible at extremely
long ranges. Also, there is nothing in any traveller combat system
about hitting the wrong target, so I guess it can\'t happen ;-) 

Size is a pretty course DM in HG, or you could use the added hull
sizes of both ships, and see if you made a hit on the "big" ship, or
rolled good enough to only hit the actual target (the pirate). This
meathod works great to hit specifc areas in other combat systems (if
you can hit a 1 ton missile, then why not a 1 ton sized area on a
200ton ship (or 0.1ton if its CT)?

Part of the jump drive creates a small bubble of real-space around the ship
that allows it to survive in jumpspace. The field is very close to the hull
(it\'s guided by the jump grid). Theoretically you could EVA if the field
extended far enough from the hull, but it seldoms does (I include the
weaseling because there is one recorded instance of someone surviving a
jump outside the ship. I forget the details, but it\'s mentioned in TAS
newsbriefs from 1112. Check the ImperiumGames (http://www.ImperiumGames.com)
website for details (Yes, it\'s still active; I\'m visiting it right now).

Details about the jump drive vary with the exact rules set and also with
individual interpretations. Whichever way you interpret it, you get into
problems. The following answer is based on the way I think the various
evidence makes most sense. The jump drive consists of various parts. One
part uses power from the power plant to create a jump bubble, an area of
realspace contained by an energy field, around the ship; another part of
the drive uses an enormous amount of energy to breach the barrier between
realspace and jumpspace. Once across the barrier you\'re stuck inside
jumpspace until natural forces spits you out into realspace again, usually
about a week later. The jump bubble has to be maintained while in jumpspace
if you want to survive, but turning it off won\'t get you back into realspace
any sooner -- just much deader. (This should also answer your last question).

Say rather that no detailed explanation that accounts for every single
feature of the way the canonical jump drive works and do not require
violating either one or more natural laws and/or one or more essential
background assumptions have ever been proposed. The _way_ the drive works
is well documented, however.

Umm.. I have a rest BP of 90/60 most days.  (I\'m just waiting for the
mothership to come and get me.)  An agent that would lower a normal human\'s
BP to the point of dizziness would drop me dead in my tracks.  The

I think we\'ve decided that the jumpdrive is only active when making the
entry into j-space.  That\'s why it needs all that damn fuel right then.

No.

You forgot the expendables. In MT, as in all the other Traveller versions,
each passenger and crew means an gross expenditure on the part of the ship
accounts of Cr2000 per jump (14 days at the most). As you know, I don\'t
think those espenses are plausible, but they are canonical.

However, the real flaw in your proposal is that you can\'t use fuel from
collapsible tanks directly in the jump drive. Don\'t ask me why. I\'ve been
unable to come up with a reason why fuel from collapsible tanks are less
usable than fuel from rigid tanks. But the rules says you can\'t. You can
use demountable tanks, but demountable tanks are rigid and require 14
days to install/remove. You can carry an extra load of fuel in collapsible
tanks and transfer it to rigid tanks before using it for a second jump. But
you can\'t use fuel directly from collapsible tanks.

I\'m not sure about the "canonness" of the Starship Operators Manual (I know
some people consider DGP canon, others don\'t) - and I can\'t say if this is
contradicted anywhere else (I don\'t think it is, but I\'m not sure).

Jump space is seen as a formless, wavy, gray space. Many people consider it
nausious to look at. The Jump field keeps jump space a few feet away from
the hull. This field is necessary, because JS is lethal when sophonts are
exposed directly to it. Thus, you can EVA in jumpspace...just stay under
the field, \'cause if you touch JS, you die.

IMTU, the jump drive is active all the time in jump to keep field integrity
tight. If the drive is cut off, the field slowly begins to collapse
(allowing it to be taken off line for short repairs, etc).

Also IMTU, once the tunnel is formed you\'re in for a 1 week jump-distance
ride...there\'s no emergency break out. If your drive fails, you\'re gonna
die (when JS intrudes into the ship).

Your milage may vary.

"De facto" implies that he only functions as the Archduke of Sylea. He
IS Archduke of Sylea in addition to being Emperor. Just as Norris is
Archduke of Deneb, Duke of Regina (subsector), Count Aledon, and Marquis
of Regina (system)all at the same time. Presumably the Emperor have a
string of minor (relatively minor, that is; as I\'ve pointed out before,
many imperial barons are propably more powerful than any emperor we\'ve
ever had on Earth) noble titles as well.

A few weeks ago I posted an essay with a suggestion for how the Imperial
nobility worked in broad, general terms. Ordinarily I\'d consider it a bit
too soon to repost it, but since I got no feedback except for two "well
done"s, I\'ll take the opportunity to solicit criticism of it again. IMO
it fits the available canonical information to a T.

Quite right. Here\'s my take on it:

In theory the structure of the Imperium is very simple: Each star system
constitutes a sovereignty governed in any way its inhabitants see fit. As
members of the Imperium these sovereignties have surrendered certain of
their rights to the Emperor; they agree to let him collect and administer
a certain percentage of their annual production, to obey a number of basic
laws (the Imperial High Laws), to let him tax certain activities, and to
leave foreign relations with non-Imperial states to him. The Emperor turns
over these rights to his vassals in return for fealthy and these vassals in
turn parcel them out to lesser vassals. Each star system thus have two
associated authorities: its own government administering system affairs and
an Imperial noble administering Imperial affairs.
        That\'s the theory. Human nature (and most alien natures too) being
what it is, it is no surprise that in practice exceptions abound. Indeed, it
could be said that the exceptions are the norm.
        MULTI-SYSTEM SOVEREIGNTIES: The Imperium frown on multi-system
sovereignties, but quite a number of these exist. In the early days of the
Imperium many pocket empires joined it as a unit. Whenever possible the
Imperium tries to break these up eventually, but a number still exists even
today. On occasion the Imperium has even been obliged to form some of its
own to meet exceptional political problems; the largest and most famous
examples are the Antarean and Solomani Autonomous regions. A more frequent
source of multi-system sovereignties are the planting of colonies by member
systems. Imperial policy favors the granting of full membership to colony
worlds that have grown big enough to make it on their own (which is why some
colonies are deliberately kept much smaller than optimum by their mother
worlds), but if a former colony prefers union with their mother world there
is not much the Imperium can do about it. Mega-corporations and the largest
sector-wide companies constitutes another kind of multi-system sovereignty.
        IMPERIAL WORLD LEADERS: The principle of having two different kinds
of leaders, system leaders and Imperial nobles, frequently run afoul of the
pride and ambition of powerful world leaders, especially if they are
hereditary rulers. It often becomes a political necessity to appoint them
Imperial nobles. Thus the Matriarch of Mora is both the head of the Moran
government and the Duchess of Mora Subsector. The reverse can also happen.
An unscrupulous Imperial noble assigned to a young, developing world is in a
very good position to acquire title to vast tracts of land. In some cases he
can end up owning, or at least running, the whole world.
	IMPERIALLY OWNED WORLDS: Over the years the Imperium have acquired
outright ownership of a lot of real estate including a number of whole
worlds. When that is the case, the noble assigned to it controls both its
internal and its Imperial affairs.
        
Imperial nobles have two different kinds of fiefs. One is a personal fief
granted to him in order to provide him with a secure income. Money
derived from personal fiefs go into the noble\'s private accounts and are
theoretically his to spend as he wants (in practice nobles with really
big personal incomes may be expected to contribute some of that wealth
for various semi-official purposes). This kind of fief is sometimes also
called an estate (An Imperial estate to distinguish it from a personal
estate which the noble own in his own right). The size and value of an
Imperial estate can vary tremendously. Not only may the Emperor give purely
symbolic estates to nobles who are rich in their own right and substantial
estates to others who are less well endowed, but a relatively poor estate
granted centuries earlier may have grown in value over the years.

	The other kind of fief is the kind described in the first paragraph
of this article, the power to collect and administer (or in the case of
lesser nobles, to collect and pass on to higher authorities) Imperial taxes.
This is also sometimes called a charge.

It is usually said that each Imperial world has a marquis associated with it.
This is true if the world is of reasonably high tech level and has a
population level of 7 or 8. The Imperial taxes from such a world comes to
something between MCr1000 and MCr100,000. Any world with taxes less than
MCr1000 will propably only rate a baron. A world with taxes higher than
MCr100,000 rates a count. Some worlds are too small to rate even a baron.
Such worlds are usually part of a neighboring fief.

I wondered many times about this myself.  The only point that I could come
up with (and it\'s flawed) is they can\'t pump the fuel out of the collapsable
tanks fast enough to get to the jump drives.  This seems to me the only
reason it wouldn\'t work and this is based on the rules about jump drive in
the Starship Operator\'s Handbook.  But as with other things you could always
figure out a work around so that it is possible (talking about slowness of
flow in my suggestion) if you tried hard enough I would think.  That\'s why I
said it was flawed...... I\'ll have to think about it some more.

Or imagine a stowaway severly damaging the ship and pointing you
towards the sun, forcing you to jump without properly using the
computers to find out where you\'ll end up after the jump is done.
*Then*, imagine finding yourself far far far away from home with

Try going to your doctor and having a platelet count of ZERO.  None.  Nada.
 Confirmed by observation of the sample.  Dr. Waltuch actually looked at me

Maybe. But am I really too far out in believing that one of the requirements
for editing official Traveller material ought to be a thourough knowledge of
the official Traveller universe? (This is IMO one of the reasons why Imperium
games products were not of uniformly high quality, to put it politely).

>In a broad sense, what to keep and what to revise?

I tried to make my opinion clear in my original post. If something has been
published in an official Traveller product, isn\'t self-contradictory, and
does not contradict other official sources, then it should stay, regardless
of what I think of it personally. If I don\'t like it, I can change it in my
own TU, but I have to accept it for the OTU. An example would be the whole
Rebellion thing. I\'m not too crazy about it (if I ever get my campaign
going again, my players are going to get a chance to pull most of the
Imperium together again).

If a canonical fact is inconsistent, it should be revised. In principle the
smallest possible revision that will make it consistent with the rest of
the OTU, but if it has to be revised anyway, one may as well pick a new
version with greater role-playing potential if one can come up with one.

If two canonical facts are mutually contradictory and one has vastly more
role-playing potential than the other, the better one should be chosen.

If two canonical facts are mutually contradictory and one is only a little
bit better than the other, the earliest one should be chosen, even if the
new one is the better.

Of course there are gray areas. If something is physically possible, but
very, very implausible, does it qualify as \'self-contradictory\'? That, I
think, is where most of the disagreements on the TML lies. For instance,
that signed Imperial Warrant in the safe of the KINUNIR. I have to admit
that the Emperor COULD issue signed Imperial Warrants that didn\'t specify
who was authorized to use it. But I don\'t think that any same Emperor would
ever do so. So does that mean that the PCs can\'t use that warrant (Except
for getting a big reward for bringing it to its rightful owner). IMO yes.
If someone wrote an adventure with a \'blank\' Imperial Warrant as a
gimick, do I think the editor should have squashed it? Yes. Would I
consider it a big enough problem to excuse making the adventure uncanonical?
Yes. But I also realize that not everybody will agree with me. That\'s where
a Supreme Decider is useful.

I described j-space as being an unending bright white infinity ... most
jump capable ships close their viewports (well, in my traveller
universe, most viewports are holographic panels relaying data from
external sensors), and display a more pleasent surrounding.  Kinda like
that opening shot from Aliens where Ripley is sitting in an artifical

OK, what happens if just cut the jump drive? ... I always thought you\'d
reappear in normal space in the same place where you started your jump
from (since the \'tunnel\' as I always envisioned it wasn\'t compeleted

One thing you have to look out for: GURPS:Traveller has reversed the
position of the Count and the Marquis so that in G:T a count is
associated with one world and inferior to a marquis who is associated
with several worlds. (Someone told me that this change came already in
T4, but when last I checked I couldn\'t find it; am I mistaken?)

I for one think that was a really bad choice. I know all about how marquis
is above count/earl in the European system, and I don\'t know if the original
author made a mistake way back when, but I always considered that a charming
detail that illustrated that the Imperium was not just a cut and paste of any
Old Earth society (for that matter, the system leaves out viscounts entirely
(the fit between barons and earls in the English peerage) and that hasn\'t
been changed in the G:T system. I don\'t understand what purpose the change
made. Anyway, enough bellyaching. Just keep in mind that whenever you are
dealing with a G:T source you have to make sure that the author was aware of
the change and reverse it back again if he was.

Another one of Geoffrey Landis\' stories.  Afterburning NTRs
(putting oxygen into the stream to get a bit more energy and
lots more thrust) have been discussed, but have problems as
a normal operational mode (less Isp, lots of damage to the
NTR due to oxygen corrosion).

	Perhaps it\'s because you need to have the fuel in the main tank for it to be
properly pumped to the reactor.  After all, in the Real World (tm), you can\'t
draw fuel from a gas can in the trunk of your car to run it\'s engine, right?

No, the RULES for jump drives are well documented, but as best as I can tell,
Jump drives are pretty much black boxes.

Yes, and no. If you stay within the energy grid maintained by the jump
capacitors, you can EVA normaly. Problem is, this grid is almost skin
tight, so you would only be able to work in open bays, hull breaches, etc.

You cannot, however, cross the grid. The energy would fry you. I believe
the penalty for downing the grid is the immediate distruction of your
vessle due to exposure to the nothingness of jump space. Same would happen
to a crewmember if somehow exposure occured.

Big blue haze<babylon 5> and the occasional large black spider-looking ship
</babylon 5>.

The jump drive is used to get you into jump space on basically a "jump
trajectory". Your basically on a type of ballistic path, you cannot
maneuver or anything, which is not a problem since no one can interact with
you in jumpspace. Once you are at the end of your path or approaching the
100d range band of the destination world, you exit.

>5. Can you force an emergency exit from jumpspace?

Refer to reply to number 4.

Wonder if you can do something similar to the "Bone Head" maneuver from
Babylon 5, try to initiate a jump while in jumpspace. Is there a second
layer to jumpspace or would this put you into an alternate universe? It
wouldn\'t work to bring you back into normal space, but what if...?

Cutting the jump engine does nothing except prevent full entry into jump
space. The jump engines charge a set of capacitors (the ones you use with
the globes) which keep the charge constant to the jump field, then gives
you a not so gentile boot out of this universe on an extradimentional
ballistic trajectory to your destination. Once your in jumpspace, the jump
engines are off, and these capacitors simply maintain the field integrity.
Most of the fuel is used in the final boot into jumpspace, which is why if
your jump capacitors are filled from your globe, you still need fuel to
make a jump.

Premature discharge of the above mentioned capacitors will result in a sort
of implosion which will basically atomise your ship as jumpspace comes
crashing in.

Let\'s see, you\'d need to install a second jump drive and seperate fuel
supply.  Then you\'d need different or modified controls (probably a
second computer).  Then you\'d want to figure out how to point the

But you _can_ hand-pump gas from 44 gallon drums in the interior
of your aircraft into the aircraft\'s real fuel tanks while in flight...
Used to be standard practice in the less airport-ridden parts of
the world.

It\'s also pretty easy to fit an electric pump and a bit of plastic
pipe betwen your gas can and the fuel tank before you start
driving. Not very safe though.

Still, that could be slow, so if you assume that the fuel is used in
one big lump
at  the start of jump, then this isn\'t possible.  If it\'s being used
throughout
the trip, however....

I have been lurking on TML for over a year and have gotten many
extremely useful ideas for my Traveller Universe (which has not been
played in since 1992, other than vehicle, world, and starship design
that I have done.  I started playing in 1983 and my universe is mostly
CT/MT, Classic Era, no rebellion.

I was reading through Vilani/Vargr and Aslan/Solomani recently( for
umpteenth time)and was reading craft profile for the four robots used
for examples.  I have Book 8 and Vampire Fleets(TNE) and have used these
design sequences to create robots. I assume that the robots in V\\V and
A/S were a bastardization of Book 8 design and MT Craft Design.  I do
not have 101 Robots (in fact, I\'ve never seen a copy), and I\'m not sure
if it was CT or MT oriented.  If any one can tell me if these robots
were designed by a design sequence I may not have, I would appreciate
the info.  I also would like to hear any comments on any of these design
sequences.

Thanks,

Being of the "Grav-Tanks that GO High Will Die" school of thought I can\'t
see any reason not to put the turret on top, and several resons to do so.
Basically as your belly is always going to be close to the ground in a
combat situation you don\'t need to be able to fire down any more than a
tracked tank does.

I\'ve been saying this sort of thing for a while, too. However nobody seemed
to be listening. I think that Gulf War footage rots people\'s brains.

Ever since I started thinking about the likely detectability of grav
drives, and probable result of being at 5000m when the AAA decides to go
active and start shooting with a VRF Fusion gun I decicded that multirole
grav tank-planes were a dumb idea. Not agile enough to be missed, not
armoured enough to avoid penetration. Not only that but being above NOE is
going to make it much easier for Ortillery to get a shot at you, and an
orbital laser battery is going to make your hull look like a seive in short
order once they get that lock.

That\'s basically where I got my +1DM to lock and shooting for hit a
specific location in BL: As at any one time you should be able to see 10 of
the 20 locations each location is 1/10 of the apparent size of the target.
In BL the hull sizes go up by a factor of ten at each step, so one hit
location is the same as a ship one size smaller. The only thing that
bothers me is that I have a feeling that to get this sort of lock you would
need a better sensor resolution than just getting a lock on the ship as a
whole. If this is true maybe the lock task DM should be +2.

Comments anyone?

Eye-n Give-Arrr is how I pronounce it, but others pronounce it inn-eh Zhi-var

according to a few CT and MT sources, yes. Just don\'t reach out more than

Personally, and based upon MT sources, It digs the tunnel, and you fall in.
The grid keeps you from becoming one with jump space, but the grid holds
the quantum charge for long enough to allow you to come out into normal
space... most of the time.

>5. Can you force an emergency exit from jumpspace?

No. At least no rules for it I\'ve ever seen in canon. Once you start
dumping the pulses to the L-Grids, you\'re committed for better or worse to
entering J-space... any interruptions or damage at that point are neary
guaranteed misjump.

For a commercial ship under standard financing, every 10 megawatts of power
over the minimum you needs puts another Cr 4000 on your monthly mortgage bill.

10 megawatts of power costs a megacredit, and a megacredit turns into Cr
4000 a month, every month for 40 years ...

weeee want the Rabid Impregnable Beach Ball from Hell to be cheeeeeeeap.

Weeeee could save space an mass an stuff by using an exxxx-raaaaayyyy

thiiiirteeeen.

But but but weeeee need to put a small fusie-wusie plant in to boil the

101 Robots designs were built using the sequences in Book 8 - Robots.
I\'ve found the Book 8 sequences much easier to use than Vampire Fleets
but then I\'m not a serious gearhead.

DGP wrote Book 8 and used it exclusively for the "101 Robots" designs.
 They added some new design features, broken down into New Skills and
New Sensors, Devices, and Weapons.  I could relate the list of new
items to you if you wish (contact me).  The book was published in
1986, so it is CT.  The back page has the stats for AB-101, "Aybee"
from the early Travellers\' Digest.


[Note to the Historians: my copy of book 8 is first printing.  Gary
Thomas\' name was left off, I guess, because it is hand written next to
Joe Fugate\'s on the credits list!  I picked this copy up the day it
hit my local store in Va. Beach, 1986.  What about your copy?]

IIRC, it\'s been tried in the official TU - they built a few prototype ships
with two jump drives, the idea was to jump, then activate the other
drive while in jump. They never got any of these ships back.

They also tried putting a jump-capable ship on another ship\'s external
sling, releasing the smaller ship while in jump space so it could jump
seperately. The smaller ship was never seen again.

It\'s hard to proceed further with this experiment. The test vehicles
gave no data, except the data "vehicle lost".

Part of this will depend on how safe your operating territory is. Saving
Cr4000 a month is pointless if your ship comes up short in a crisis
situation and is lost.

Vilani had been travelling and trading in a relatively stable empire
for millenia by the time they met Terra. Terra\'s first experience with
interstellar travel went straight to interstellar war. Could this have
something to do with the differing design philosophies?

Of course they never got the ships back.  Even if there were something
above jumpspace, when the ship dropped back into jumpspace it would be
destroyed, or too far away to get back, or eaten by the spiders. 
Choose one, none sound like a pleasure cruise.  We never would have
figured out regular jumpspace if someone hadn\'t left clues!

Yeah. the problem is that you have to assume (an BL explicitly
states) that your are firing multiple shots to get a single hit (or
a couple hits). Your suggestion works fine, since it points to a
fairly large area (10%), and of course there\'s still a chance it\'ll
hit some other area.

A combat system I was working on used a related idea. I had a "Close
Attack" phase where fighters (or any other ship dumb enough :-) that
plotted Intercept movement could attack specific areas of a target,
and got a bonus on to-hit and damage. the rationale was that they
get close enough that they can\'t miss with a laser (at a few
thousand km, you can\'t miss, period (barring equipment failure)).
They\'d have to survive similar "can\'t miss" fire, just like a
contact-kill missile would have to.

Given the 100+ ROF of TNE lasers (800 if you bother to put a decent
military one on board), even if only 5% of the turn is in this final
range, you\'d score many hits on the target (5% of the total ROF
would be a minimum since shots aren\'t really spread out evenly
during the turn). It was a good way to give teeth to PCs who wanted
to pull a Luke Skywalker :-) Gotta love them golden bearing balls
:-)

IIRC there are vague mentions in canon to the concept of activating two jump 
drives similtaniously. According to the theories if you can perfectly align the 
jump fields you should either:

a - Increase the jump by mutliplying effect (eg two J-3 units produce 3 x 3 =J-9)
b - Increase the jump exponentially (eg two J-3 units produce 3^3 = J-27)
c - Disappear in a puff of flashy pryotechnic smoke never to be seen again

According to canon, thus far only effect c has been achieved when ever this is 
attempted.

I believe there are also comments in the Imperial Encylopedia to the effect that 
a second jump unit can not be activated while in jump due to the impossibility 
of correctly aligning the jump fields.

Like he said, this would have been bad because...???

At the time, Iran would have liked to see us as dead as Iraq. I recall
several instances of being buzzed at midnight by Iranian P-3 patrol planes.

I wouldn\'t want to unless I had not choice.  Otherwise, my approach would
be "no", but some would say that would be a small space between the hull
and the edge of the jump field you could squeeze into.

My ruling is that you use 99%+ of the energy to form the jump field then
there is a small trickle of charge to compensate for non-ideal losses.

If you want to force a misjump (if you are lucky).

Actually what the TAS article says (see below) is that one victim
survived actual exposure _to_ jump space.  If the jump bubble is really
a meter from the hull you should be able to climba round on the hull of
a ship in jump space just fine, although you may need to make
Determination checks to not freak out and Dex tasks not to put part of
your body into jump space accidently.


"Regina/Regina (0310-A788899-A) Date: 102-1112
     A dispatch from Terra/Sol (0207-A867A69-F) dated 121-1111 reads:
     "The first known victim known to survive direct exposure to
     hyperspace arrived at Terra today, suffering from what medical
     experts are calling "Hyperspace sickness\'. Naval Commander Ansel
     Churner, an engineering officer on his way to retirement on
     Prometheus, is being held in strict quarantine until specialists
     can determine the specific effects the exposure will have. Doctors
     working on the case are quoted as saying that preliminary tests
     indicate that Commander Churner is in good condition, but is not
     mobile."

The above article is copyright FFE & its use is not intended to mess
with their copyright

Does the ships artifical gravity aply to the outside of the ships hull?
IE can you walk on the hull in space (or crawl on it in jumpspace) or
are you in zero G?

If you examine the 1112 TAS data you will notice that two different
messages from Terra/Sol, one dated 121-1111 and one dated 130-1111 were
both released on Regina.  The message dates 121-1111 was released on
102-1111 (a transit time of 334 days) and the message dated 130-1111
(nine days later) was released on Regina on 140-1111 (a transit time of
375 days).

This data tends to suggest that the X boat routes are not perfect and
that data does not flow at a uniform rate (or that some data is
artifically slowed).

There is a good discussion of this in G:T Behind the Claw.  It discusses
how
each member world has an Imperium Noble to represent it at the Imperium
Court.  That representative will have some tangible connection to that
system
(though not necessarily before the appointment).  That connection may be

an actual fiefdom of land, or a merely a token connection, such as a
portfolio
of shares in a major corporation of that system.

Some worlds will have natives who actually control the world government.

Other worlds may be represented by a non-native with only a token
connection
to the world, and in fact may rarely if ever even visit the world.  The
emphasis
is on representation to the Imperium Court.  Actual power on the member
world and its local affairs may be extremely minimal, especially in
areas out
of the purview of the Imperium.

An example is the Archduke Norris, who is Duke of Regina, but operates out
of Mora and, although he has the authority to directly administer Regina,
does not.  And though he is most often on Mora, he is a guest of the Duchess
of Mora, she represents/administers Mora, _not_ the Archduke.

True, but I think excess fusion power is a bad trade.

Cr 4000 a month is roughly equivalent to 2 dtons of cargo revenue. One dton
of cargo space dedicated to batteries turns into about 21 megawatts of
power for one hour at TL12, or a dedicated sandcaster turret.

Maybe only +1; BL/FFS sensors have very high resolution (they\'re big 
for their collecting area) and probably have a few pixels
across any ship they have a detection on.

(And the HEPlaR plume tells you what direction the target is pointing in,
and you can measure it\'s centroid position to a tenth of a hull size...)

That\'s assuming that Jump Space goes in a "straight line". By some

Because that would have precipitated a regional war against Israel. All
the Arab allies in the Coalition would have immediately dropped out and
attacked Israel, most likely.

Because nuking a city full of civilians is a damn serious step to take,
and the Israelis would have had to use more of them, a _lot_ closer to
home to stave off destruction. Remember, once is happenstance, twice is
coincidence, thrice is a trend, and nuclear war is a rewally bad trend
to get caught up in.

Because the biggest troop buildup for the US since Vietnam was right
there in the middle of it all, and for damn sure any other carefully
hidden nukes in the region would have been used (the Soviets have a
rather large number of warheads they cannot account for. To be sure, the
majority of them are simply lost in their bureaucracy and warehouses,
but it only takes a few...), and all of our troops, and Britains troops,
and France\'s troops and Germany\'s troops would have been right there in
the middle of it.

Because that would have brought out all the non-nuke weapons of mass
destruction in the area, and all of our troops, and Britains troops, and
France\'s troops and Germany\'s troops would have been right there in the
middle of it. Were _that_ to happen, do you think for a heartbeat that
the political leaders of those countries would have been able to hold
off the political pressure to go to war over it?

At that point, Russia wakes up and sees all of this sh*t happening right
on their borders, and being good paranoid russian generals, they start
prepariong for the worst...

Hmmm....more and more it starts to sound like Twilight2K, doesn\'t it. A
fun game to play, but a wretched one to live...

Yes, I know this is an unalterable law in all published traveller
backgrounds, but has anybody ever beenable to figure out a sensible  
(pseudoscientific) reason why this would be so? (Because its canon

Giving you the streamlining, but keeping the displacement the same.

Jump drive is based on displacement. If the displacement isn\'t there, why
do I need to provide a drive for it?

Another problem I have is how the waste space is calculated. For ships of
startship size, the maximum waste space has been reached - 150m3 of
hypersonic streamlining or 300m3 of hypersonic airframe. So your 100ton
streamlined ship needs over 10tons of streamlining space - and the
10,000ton strike cruiser also needs over 10tons of streamlining space.
Personally, I don\'t see what affect this 10tons would have on the 10,000ton
ship. And if it has no affect, why do we need it at all.

Personally, I am in favor of streamlining costing more - providing more
area (thus heavier, bigger drives), and some space being available only for
fuel. I\'m seriously thinking about doing this IMTU. However, I know there
are those of you that stand by the waste space system...sould someone
explain this to me once again. \'cause it really makes no sense to me.

Thanks...

Here\'s my take.

Somebody postulated a subterranean tunnel system here on Earth to tie together 
different cities.  Thing is, any two points on the planet would only be about 
20 minutes by tube due to gravity accelleration.  (It\'s been awhile since I 
saw the article in a magazine, and of course, they forgot to factor in 
continental drift, but that\'s neither here nor there...)

I postulate Jump space to be somewhat simular.  Every possible destination is 
on the surface of a hypothetical hypersphere.  Openning a \'Jump tunnel" lets 
you tunnel through the hypersphere.  For some unknown reason, the \'size\' of 
the hypersphere is such that the transit time of the \'tunnel\' is about 168 
hours, give or take 10%.  Thus, attempting to \'emergency exit\' jumpspace would 
put you somewhere inside the \'tunnel\' and would either not work at all *or* 
kill you in the attempt, ref\'s choice.

 That actually starts making some sense, if you want a drive, that uses
most of its energy to puch through to 5-dimensional space, and relies on
spatial geometry to pull it through. In your hypersphere analog one would
have to remember, that the distances traversed by jump drive would be the
equivalent of digging a tunnel through earth to connect two points only a
few meters apart. So, to get any help fron what passes for gravity in the
5-dimensional medium, one would have to "slingshot" towards the "center"
of the hypersphere. (Talking about gravity here can be justified,since
even in normal 3-d space gravity is not a real force, but only a trick of
spatial geometry.) Such "slingshots" would then be almost equal in
duration, because of the gravitational principles (or analog thereof),
which you described. The length of the jump might depend, for example, on
how "steeply" the j-drive can make the ship "dive" into the hypersphere.

Because you are basically leaping off a cliff.  Or perhaps a catapult is a
better analogy.

When you enter jump, you spent a great deal of energy to begin the trip,
"aiming" for a designated spot.  You are in essence throwing yourself at
the target.  Once in jump, it would take ungodly amounts of energy to stop
the "arc" towards the target point.

Merrick, _TCS_ says in p12 (HG rules clarifications and errata), _Agility
is a maesure of the amount of energy available to the ships\' maneuver
drives, even when other operations are in progress. As such, agility is an
extremely important aspect of any combat ship. Agility serves as a
defensive DM on the throw to hit for all weapons types._

It effects combat in three ways -

1) A target\'s agility is taken from the roll to hit as a negative DM. ie DM
- -1 for agility 1.
2) Pursuit - ships breaking off break off at the speed (G rating) of their
least agile ship.
3)  Emergency Agility - it is possible for a ship not to use energy
consuming weapons in a combat round and divert energy to the M-Drives. In
this case, an emergency agility rating equal to the MDrive or power plant
number (which ever is lower) may be used.

cf CJ Cherryh\'s _Downbelow Station_ for an example of what happens when you
get to evacuate a big station with freighters etc when an enemy takes it
over. Overcrowded merchants with the crews locking themselves in the bridge
and engineering spaces, holds full of refugees, and it all goes bad....

It was just a side plot in _Downbelow_ but it has great potential as a
story hook. Biggest difference from Traveller is that the crews and
passengers in Cherryh\'s Union/Alliance universe take \'jump drugs\' to get
through jump. And in the example I mentioned, I suspect that the refugees
didn\'t have jump drugs...

I recommend Cherryh wholeheartedly. _Cyteen_ for bioengineering, _Downbelow
Station_ as a classic SCi-Fi story, _Merchanter\'s Luck_, _Tripoint_ and
_Finity\'s End_ as examples of Merchant life, and _Hellburner_ and
_Rimrunners_ for military/ex military situations. _Heavy time_ covers
belters really well.

Only thing that could get worse is if you met yourself in some kind of jump

...of the Flamebait?

Lets pretend to have a veneer of civilisation, and assume that there are
some (say a lot) people who have oppose the Hussein totalitarian regime in
Iraq, and that they\'re to scared to oppose it openly, shall we? There
again, after several years of starving and lacking basic medical facilities
they may attach a little of the blame to the US/UK etc who imposed the
sanctions.

Israel nukes Baghdad, and then the rest of the middle east goes up in
flames. And all that fallout is quite close to Europe and on the edge of
the Med. At the same time the US looses oil from the Gulf when the various
nations around there are swept up in it.... follow the logic?

Ob-Trav - what would happen if a state in the Imperium launched an attack
against another and destroyed it against the Imperial Rules of War?
Something like the attack with Antimatter at the start of _Reality
Dysfunction_ by Hamilton? Would the Imperium red zone the perpetrator or
would it get red zoned then nuked and mesoned back to the stone age?

Agreed. 10987, the intelligent Cymbeline chip from Signal GK, was a
fully-realized NPC with its own personality, skills, and motivations. It
could communicate with computers at ultra-high speed, but could not "take
over" a ship or act as an infallible transponder any more than a human with
a CB radio could.

Cymbeline chips could have been the basis for an interesting new direction
for Traveller characters and adventures, and provided challenges and
dramatic potential for the Imperium\'s existing laws on robots and
artificial intelligence. The chips are not robots, or even strictly
"artificial". They are, as you suggest, a new form of life.

I believe TNE was trying to move in this direction with the Sandman
Virus from Vampire Fleets, though it was burdened by existing Virus rules.

	The waste space isn\'t volume taken away from the hull, as you show
in your diagrams; rather, it\'s volume that\'s just not useable because
of the additional structural requirements of streamlining, control
surfaces, blind corners created, etc.

	This is basically what happens--the overall displacement of the hull
remains the same, you just can\'t efficiently use all of the volume. 

	Think of it as increased structural volume, and maybe it\'ll make
more sense.

Not being a well versed in theoretical physics I can see one thing from
this. This might allow an expert engineer to "tune" the J-drive to greater
or lesser efficiency. In game terms I\'d say that a good skill roll while
doing routine maintenance on the J-drive might tend to allow the jump to
tend toward the minus side of the +/- 20%, while a failed roll might tend
toward the + side.

I like this since it gives the skills and duties of the ship\'s engineer a
greater scope. Sort of the Scotty syndrome. A VERY good engineer can shave
time off of jump (while remainng within the scope of the rules), while a
poor engineer (of lower skill level) can have adverse effects on the
duration of jump.

It also allows scope to astrogation. THe astrogator is calculating the locus
of the "tunnel" exit. Better astrogation can result in a closer exit to the
100 d point, and to the targeted main world. Poor astrogation can result in
an exit point further from the 100 d point.

  Under Striker 14m^3 of TL C batteries is MCr 11.9, and contains ~15.6
MW-hours of energy; the battery augmented spacecraft is largely a post-

  In surface combat there would be applications due to shorter engagements

  Well, if they\'re going to play hide and seek, then landing between
movement orders will both reduce (eliminate?) their CG signature and
give them a chance to weed out enemies who are too impatient.

  FWIW, while it is highly desirable to assume (as does Striker) that
a 3-D target fix cannot be achieved through terrain using either CG
detectors, densitometers, neutrino sensors, or PEMS fixing on the EM
put out by the target AFV\'s power plant, it can be awfully useful to 
any would-be Trav wargamers to assume that rough location is given for
active units - at least so they can be placed on the playing surface :>

the regular level if necessary) it means fueling the power plant for a month

It also allows me to swallow the Thrusters a little easier...they are not

>will_not do here!) 

Whether the reasoning is sensible, or not, is in the eye of the
beholder, but several theories have been proposed.  In my Traveller
Universe it is...

The jump drive creates an artificial wormhole in space that connects
two widely separated locations in real space, point A and B. The
wormhole is a volumematic interface...also called a "hyperspace
pucker" or "jump bubble"...that extends into a hyperspace.  A ship
translates from point A to point B in an *indeterminate* time and
the interface at point A disappears at the instant of transfer.  The
hyperspace pucker naturally smooths out, but not immediately.

The measure of time separating entrance into and exit from the
bubble is *usually* consistent for observers inside and outside the
bubble, however during "temporal misjumps" this may not be true.
The time absent from real space is a function of the amount of time
it takes for the hyperspace pucker to naturally collapse and expel
its contents at point B, normally this takes about a
week...regardless of the distance between A and B. The actual time
is dependent on the quality of injection matter ("jump fuel") used
to open the wormhole, the condition of the jump drive, and the skill
of the engineer in tuning the drive to the content of the injection
mass.  Misjumpping ships have been known to arrive after greatly
extended periods of time as measured on either or both observer
clocks, and although no direct evidence exists some theories suggest
ships may travel back in time as measured by an outside observer
given rare and unpredictable conditions.

The interface, and hyperspace, completely encloses the area
around the drive (the ship), and matter *in* hyperspace decomposes
into a sea of quarks that will be expelled into real space as the
pucker smooths.  Therefore a protective shield must be erected
between hyperspace and the ship. The lanthanum grid and a significant
portion of the jump fuel is used for this.

The grid, located between the inner and outer hull to protect it
from incidental damage, is charged prior to jump and creates an
expanding field.  As the field extends through the hull it produces
colored patterns due to interaction with the atoms of the hull.  The
patterns and colors vary based on both the grid geometry and the
material composing the hull.

Within the "jump field", produced by the grid, a tenuous atmosphere,
generally hydrogen, forms a "bubble" of real matter.  The bubble
extends two to three meters from the grid.  Usually there is a meter
or two of bubble outside the ship\'s hull for safety and to allow
emergency repairs on the ship\'s surface.  The hydrogen, and
everything else that crosses the bubble wall, slowly decomposes
producing the mind-bending flashes of color and patterns within the
"gray" nothingness we associate with jump space.  The atmosphere
also acts to transfer heat from the ship across the interface into
hyperspace, and so the atmospheric pressure is monitored and
adjusted throughout jump to cool the ship.

It is important to maintain the jump grid throughout a ship\'s time
in jumpspace.  If the protective grid collapses the bubble and
everything within begins to decompose.  If the atmospheric pressure
falls below a critical level the bubble between hyperspace and the
real space begins to deflate and infringe on the material of the
hull decomposing it.  Either situation would be deadly for a ship\'s
crew.

While any material could be used to maintain the bubble, most have
deleterious effects on the ship as it decomposes.  Absolutely pure
H2 is far and away the best choice, as even the hydrogen isotopes
can produce dangerous radiation as it decomposes slowly irradiating
the ship\'s hull.

After some period of time, the hyperspace pucker smooths and its
contents are expelled back into real space.  Assuming that the
quantity and quality of injection mass used to create the wormhole
was adequate, the condition and tuning of the drive were within
specs, the jump sensors worked correctly, the Astrogator locked onto
a valid target within range of his sensors, the grid did its job and
the quantity and quality of injection mass used to maintain the
bubble was sufficient the ship will emerge in 154 to 174 hours in the
vicinity of point B.

The range of a jump drive, IMTU, depends on the quality of the jump
sensors and the skill of the Astrogator.  He must be able to "lock"
both ends of the wormhole or he gets unpredictable results, ie
spacial misjumps.  Ships have to travel far enough from any mass so
these sensors can look through the "jump lens" formed as the
wormhole forms and "see" the target locations without them being
"washed out" by local masses.  Target locations are GG or larger
masses because only masses that large can be discerned with the
sensors.  An especially skillful Astrogator can "push" a jump beyond
its rating, ie a J1 can make a J2, by completing a Staggering task.
IMTU, Jdrives are often built to slightly less expensive "half
spec", ie J1.5, so J2\'s can be attempted as a Formidable task and
J1\'s can be attempted as a Moderate task.

IAC, enough injection mass to make a jump needs to be used.  This
quantity is based on both the volume of the ship and the distance it
intends to jump.  Approximately 90% is used to form the jump lens
and a hyperspace pucker (or wormhole) large enough to hold the
ship\'s volume.  The rest is used throughout the jump to keep the
bubble inflated.

This is, of course, ALL MTU!

Ok, all you guys that think MTU is *so* different from "c"...see, it
isn\'t so different!  ;->

My model is that entering jump is in some ways analogous to firing a shell
along a fixed trajectory.  Once you apply the initial impetus (enter jump,
expending a bunch of energy at once), you\'re on a fixed \'trajectory\' which
will intersect real space again in a week.  Nothing you can do while in
j-space will change your trajectory.

It happens (canonically) that the only known way to make a jump work is to
enter on the one-week trajectory.  In a TU I used to run, I added that
researchers had discovered other trajectories that took around 50 days,
around a year, around 7 years, and so forth.  Other than the time spent in
j-space, these were identical to normal jumps.  Obviously, they\'re not
very useful!  Hitting one of them was a rare form of misjump, however.
Also, some researchers thought the \'higher\' trajectories might make
controlled jumps greater than 6 possible, though nobody had managed it at
the time my game was set.

  Depending on the rules system (SFB, Star Cruiser, FT, etc.) you might
very well see a spate of battlecruiser over-runs, where a large, well-
armed ship quickly steam-rollers a smaller; while it might be realistic
probably only a phased (and thus, typically slow) movement system would
keep the phenomenon from being artificially effective and popular.

But you can use fuel from drop tanks and from demountable tanks directly.

Who cares about theoretical physics- what you came up with is a cool game
thing that makes it just a little more fun to be an engineer. I like it and
I\'m gonna use it.

Total agreement! Has anyone else done a similar thing?

    'body' => 'Well- Ive read a lot of great responses and I\'ve decided how I am going to
handle this in my FUDGE GURPS Traveller game. It is very important because
one character is an former experimental Jump Drive designer who tried to
create a "controlled misjump" drive. (It should be noted that it didn\'t
work).

I\'ll give you my way of handling this question by question.

2. Can you do an EVA while in jumpspace?

Yes- but only in the most extreme emergency. To do it can kill a person
because the field holding jumpspace at bay averages 1 meter above the
surface of the vessel. There may be nooks and crannies of the surface with
more or less headroom.

Exposure to jumpspace is fatal 99.999999% of the time- except maybe for a
one time player character thing where they survive but have to deal with
horrible physical consequences (or mental- I like Chris Seamens idea of
Cthulu being out the window<G>!!)


3. What do you see out the window while in a jump?

An undulating grey mass. I like that- its easy to say.


4. Is the J-Drive actually working while in Jump Space or does it just work
to get you to "break on through to the other side" )as Jim Morrison might
say) then it goes cold and you wait for natural forces to dump you back
into normal space?

The jump drive charges the capactors to hold the integrity of the jump field
but the drives are cold after entering jumpspace.


5. Can you force an emergency exit from jumpspace?


No. The entry into jumpspace is by ballistic motion- you are moving towards
the exit and can\'t control it otherwise. You can be forced out of jumpspace
by the hyper-tunnel passing within 100 diameters of a star or planet.
However- it still takes the week no matter if you get to where you are
going- halfway or even end up where you started.

That\'s the way I\'m handling it. Anyways- thanks everyone.

I think it is a bit too soon for that, but I\'ll e-mail it to you. Anybody

I was re-reading this the other day, and realised that "Lone Wolf" was
written by none other than Dave Nilsen...!

I also like the follow-on scenario, "Three Blind Mice" (was this also by
Dave? I\'ll have to check). I designed a TL 15 MT stealth starship (ie.
covert surveillance ship) for the Ine Givar, based primarily on the
silhouette in this article. The PC\'s ended up swiping it, of course (that
being the intention of the scenario ;-). Imagine their surprise when they
realised the missile storage area had been designed to carry nukes...

I\'m working on Yet Another CT Noble Rework, something I used to use a LOT when 
I was an active GM with my CT group.  It was roughly based on on an article I 
read in Adventure Gamer Magazine ca. 1981 called \'Scepter & Starship\'.  It was 
a pretty nifty variant for *Imperial* nobles, but needed some work as soon as 
MT came out.  Since I\'m in the process of doing a PBEM, I was gonna dust it 
off and redo it anyways, so...  <grin>

In any event, here\'s the *temporary* social standings from 10 to 21, both 
Imperial and planetary:

  SS              Imp Title          Planetary Title
   A                UMC                 UMC
   B             Knight/Dame        Knight/Dame
   C           Baron/Baroness      Baron/Baroness
   D          Marquis/Marquessa   Marquis/Marquessa
   E           Count/Countess       Count/Countess
   F            Duke/Duchess         Duke/Duchess
   G          Viscout/<??>         Viscount/<??>
   H          Viceroy/<??>         Viceroy/<??>
   I       Archduke/Archduchess    Prince/Princess
   J         Prince/Princess        King/Queen
   K       Crown Prince/Princess      --/--
   L         Emperor/Empress          --/--

Some notes here.  \'Planetary\' royalty *IS* Imperial royalty up to SS F. Their 
oath of fealty is to the Emperor *through* their King/Queen.

Planetary Viscounts and Viceroys outrank Imperial Dukes *ONLY* when on their 
home planet, otherwise, they are considered to be Imperial Dukes/Duchesses.

An Imperial Archduke would outrank everybody *but* the Planetary Crown 
Prince/Princess or Planetary King/Queen when on a planet with a hereditary 
monarchy in theory, but in practice would be the King\'s leigelord\'s immediate 
henchman.  (I.E., the king would owe fealty *to* the Emperor *THROUGH* the 
Archduke).

Imperial Viceroy is a title given to one who is in effect Imperial governor of 
several systems in a subsector.  They\'d be directly answerable to the Archduke.

Benefits, such as ways of generating holdings, etc, will follow in a further 
post.

I\'m surprised there were no weapons skills whatsoever.  Yes, he *is* \'the 
man\', but concieveably there would come a time when he might *NEED* to be able 
to defend himself (Can you say \'Dulinor\'?).  I\'m sure he rectified this 
omission later...

Works OK for short periods (IMTU, we got a number of people out of Ruie
like this, before it became a Red Zone - OK, so the players were
responsible for THAT too...  ;-).

However, I rule that it takes its toll on the life-support system (and is
responsible for the Chief Engineer\'s frazelled look!). Your ship will end
up smelling like a scoutship with that old General Products air filter
system, and you better make sure you have enough food for the "passengers".
I think the old LBB\'s and maybe MT contained some replenishment rules -
anyone got a copy handy?

You can make it unpleasant enough to justify a -DM (or raised Diff level,
depending on your ruleset ;-), so the PC\'s will do it in an emergency but
not as a regular thing.

Swirling silver fog seen through a sort of soap-bubble effect. Those stupid

 My J-Drives suck the tanks dry at Jump initiation but remain "on" for the

I played out a few pirate encounters this weekend. I used High

the Brilliant Lances scale (I used 30,000km/hex and 30 minute turns

blew off the fact that HG claims 20 minute turns compare to BL\'s 30
minutes.

I called 2 hexes or under "Short range" by HG standards (close to
what MT calls short range). Maximum HG range is over 150 hexes using
MT ranges.

I used the corsair from MT (400 tons, 4 triple beam turrets, and it
has the same computer as the ever present 400ton SDB I used (out of
traders and gunboats). The pirate had to disable and board a type R.
I gave the type R a triple sandcaster, and a triple beam laser
turret. I assumed that the SDB had to scramble from the planet, and
that the 100d limit was at 900kkm (30 hexes). The SDB is in orbit
the turn after the pirate attacks the type R.

I assumed that the pirate would attack after the type R gets about
halfway to the jump point. There were a couple reasons (I figured
this out by playing out the movement):

1. You need to let the merchant get his velocity up so that he can\'t
turn around quickly.

2. You need to keep as far away from the planet as possible so
you\'re not so close to planetary defenses.

I also assumed that the pirate pretends to be on a course to orbit
the planet, but changes towards a matching course as soon as the
attack starts.

Battles:

The pirate can disable the target fairly quickly. I used two
batteries of 2 triple lasers, and got a critical each time a battery
hits. Sand doesn\'t help the target much (and I didn\'t let him use it
on the first shot (surprise)). The type R can\'t hit the pirate often
due to computer differences/low factor. The SDB can attack as soon
as it is in orbit, but has a hard time hitting the pirate, and can\'t
critical it with its lasers. Missiles take about 2 turns to hit on
average.

Conclusions (in no particular order):

1. the 400ton SDB sucks for antipiracy work, IMO--using HG. It should 
have all one kind of weapon to maximize the damage it deals out (in
BL and beyond the mixed weapons are OK, actually). Use a 4 triple
laser SDB in one battery and the pirate is toast. Better yet, build
a 500ton one with 5 turrets if you are using HG.

2. The pirate is under fire from turn 2 on regardless of 1 (above).
I don\'t think it would be a healthy job. If the SDB were designed
better for anti-piracy work (something you\'d expect if that is a
primary role for it) then the pirate wouldn\'t have a chance to
capture the merchant (though he might survive).

3. I tried having the pirate cripple the type R then waste the SDB.
This can work, and give the SDB in question is the best idea
(assuming the planet only scrambles one SDB--dumb given that they\'d
no doubt run the same simulation). Once the missiles start hitting
the pirate is not so happy (nukes, unless he is already matched with
the merchant). 

4. The best bet for the pirate is to appear inbound, at low velocity,
and near the 100d limit. Attack the merchant when it is very near to
the limit, and hope you trash the drives in the first shots (a
reasonable gamble with 2 critical, and 2 regular hits for each
attack). If you do this, it can\'t jump, even at the limit. Try to
board and scoot. Otherwise, jump yourself.

5. I think that systems that faced piracy and weren\'t strategically
important enough to have naval SDBs around would have ships in low
orbit that can take a pirate. A 500 ton, laser armed SDB would be
the way to go.

6. With the exception of some idealized case, matching vectors with
the merchant should take at least 2, maybe 3-4 turns (1-2 hours)
given the 3g pirate in MT.

I posted a direct letter to Brandon, but maybe it\'s time to let the other

(eg Mark Seeman\'s) can be accessed through my "Traveller Jump Points" page
(along with as many other Trav sites as I have been able to find!). Just
search the page for "library data".

The problem with this is that according to CT, the time in jumpspace
for a misjump goes up from about 1 week to 1d6 weeks (later Traveller
versions may vary).

There is nothing in the rules that I am aware of that lets you emerge
from jumpspace in less than 1 week give or take a few hours.

Keep in mind that a ship can be resolved sufficient to hit it with 2m
resolution just fine. A 1m diameter turret will need better than 1m
resolution to be resolved as separate from the ship... at 25cm you can make
out the rounding, and at 10cm it becomes obious. Think of the starship
mini\'s as being what kind of details you get at about 5cm resolution... at
least based upon the yacht and patrol cutter mini\'s.

Also, will you be able to target a specific location W/R/T the ship\'s own
movements and Time-To-Target-Lag?

I never allow called shots in space combat if you cannot target at that
range effectively with the Mk 1 Eyeball.

Well, IMTU, it is because jumpspace treates realspace like the surface of a
ball, and jumping causes you to generate a gravity-powered "fall" through a
parabolic tunnel from point to point along the surface. Any gravity powered
fall with enough initial \'kicker\' energy to make up for entropic losses
will always take the same time for any two points on the sphere. Jump
drives provide enoguh kicker to gaurantee coming out the other end...
assuming you tunneled to the surface with the intital tumbleset.

I never felt that the MT fuel useage was too high... I also assumed much
lower energy conversion than many of the gearheads do. I disliek Fusion+
because it was a rules-mechanic addition SOLELY TO JUSTIFY A POORLY THOUGHT
OUT BIT OF CANNON ADDITION. (i.e., how could Cleon have coopted so many
worlds into the early 3i) If you\'re going to change the technological
assumptions for realism, fine. If you\'re going to change them to match the
existing canon, fine. If you\'re going to make new technological assumptions
entirely, count me out. T4 did this. T4 did this in an unsubtle way. As for
thrusters, I never though of CT thrusters as anything other than T-plates.
So HG and MT\'s t-plates were not only no surpriser, but what I expected.

Personally, I disliked the level of detail in TNE/FF&S. MT was at times too
much, but CT (Bk2/Bk5) was never enough. MT works for me. Given my
druthers, I\'d see MT republished in a two or three volume set, with some
minor upgrades and all the erratta applied... MWM has already said not just
not, but something close to a "Hell no!", although quite politely. So, I
will continue to run MT with tweaks (Why not, since MT or anything like it
(mechanically, not BG wise) has been ixnayed by MWM for future publication)
until my books can no longer be used even from within page protectors in
notebooks. But I\'m unlikely to ever run TNE again, nor T4, and I doubt I\'ll
think T5 much an improvement (altho\' I hope MWM surprises me with something
I\'ll like). I don\'t think I\'ll play GT; I\'ve tried in the past, and the
GURPS rules, IMNSHO, just cannot support the "Look and Feel" of the OTU,
let alone my slight deviations from it.

Hmm...   If this is the case, then there MUST be a way to make your life
support stretch for up to six weeks without recharge, or else a misjump
would be a death sentence for the crew.

On that logic, there must be a way to make your life support work for up
to six times the normal number of people for one week if necessary.

The stats for both are in CT in the Traveller Adventure, also in TNE in the
World Tamers Handbook there are stats for the TI class. I haven\'t seen any
floorplans anywhere though.

Cold fusion got lot of bad press because it started out as bad science.
The traditional fusion plants in Traveller are hot reactors.
They use star-hot deuterium (and later, plain hydrogen) to generate
usable energy.

Probable reactions :-
deuterium - catalysed D-D fusion : deuterium -> helium-4 plus protons
and neutrons ; mass to energy conversion 3.84 X 10^(-3)
i.e. 1kg of fuel gets 3.84g converted to energy
hydrogen - CNO cycle or catalysed proton chain :
4H -> He-4 + energy :- mass to energy conversion 6.1 X 10^(-3)

Canonical fuel levels i.e. 21kg deuterium per MW-year or 7kg LH2
don\'t make sense : there\'s not enough fuel to provide adequate cooling
(open Brayton cycle?)

There is one explanation, and some may find it unpalatable.
The fuel requirement is correct, but only a very small fraction is
burned (about 1%).

So, like GURPS and 2300, fusion reactors are boxes you fuel every
century or so. Maintenance should be performed every 18 months to two
years because of neutron-induced degradation of the structure...

A plausible model for Fusion+ is muon catalysed fusion.
Replacing electrons with muons creates smaller atoms (muon is about
240 times heavier than the electron) and it is easier to get nuclei
close to each other.

The dreadful (fuel -> work) efficiency of Fusion+ (0.06%) could be
explained by the energy required to generate a reasonable number of
muons, or a low fractional burnup and open cycling - 1.5L of heavy water
per (3 to 10!!) MW-hours wouldn\'t provide too much cooling though, would
it?
The superheated steam plumes given off are very unstealthy (and
wasteful, since it\'s D2O you are throwing into the air...)

My thruster handwave :-
Thrusters are like jump drives - they permit access to the underlying
structure of space. Instead of punching a hole through it, thrusters
grab on to and permit movement along the substrate (like the FTL drives
in Ian Bank\'s books).

    'body' => 'Psychiatry and Mental Illness
Afflictions of the mind have always been with us.
As medical knowledge advances, it becomes apparent that
about 20% of the population will experience some form
of illness requiring psychiatric treatment during their
lifetime. This value seems to be constant across a wide
range of cultures and technology levels.

Precipitants
The majority of mental illnesses are reactions to adverse
situations experienced in life, from the horrific to the
merely strange.
Most first become manifest in early adulthood.
Some underlying predispositions exist. The question of
\'nature vs nurture\' would appear to be irrelevant.
Inherited factors, mainly dealing with neurochemistry and
perception are as important as personality styles developed
during childhood and adolescence.

Classification
1. Anxiety and the neuroses
 - phobias
 - obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)
 - post-traumatic stress syndrome
2. Disorders of mood
 - depression
 - bipolar disorder
3. Disorders of reality perception
 - schizophrenia
 - delirium

*Anxiety and the neuroses
Anxiety is a normal physiological response in anticipation
of a potential stressor.
The body and mind become primed for \'fight or flight\' ;
breathing and pulse quicken, senses are on full alert.
It is very useful - up to a point.
Beyond this limit, it becomes counter-productive, even
destructive.
Headaches, abdominal pain, palpitations, nausea, vomitting,
diarrhoea, \'pins and needles\' in the extremities,
and a general feeling of impending doom are symptoms of a
severe anxiety attack.

We can regard anxiety disorders as arising from either :-
Inappropriate stressors ;
Inappropriate threshold for initiating anxiety response ; or
Inappropriate response to stressors.

Phobias
We usually remember bad events rather than good ones. This
would appear to be an ineradicable part of human nature.
A particularly stressful event may lead to a fear
of objects, concepts or situations which remind one of that
occurrence.
Most people have little quirks of this sort eg. fear of the
number 13, insects, needles, etc.
Most people can control the anxiety these stressors generate.
However, some cannot.

Post-traumatic stress syndrome
This is very similar to a phobia.
The provocative event is usually awful (eg. losing a
spouse or a close friend in horrific circumstances).
Situations can arise much later in life which trigger an
uncontrollable, vivid episode of recall : colloquially,
a \'flashback\'. These are often disabling in their intensity.

Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)
The normal routines of daily life, and the requirement for
some baseline level of vigilance in one\'s affairs is by and
large taken for granted. These are things which happen almost
automatically.
An undue focus on certain of these tasks, and an abnormal fear
of the consequences if these tasks are not successfully
completed, characterises OCD.

Key elements :-
Rituals - certain activities must be done in the same way,
every time, otherwise disaster will ensue.
Eg. handwashing with a fresh bar of soap (no-one else\'s
germs could be on a fresh bar of soap).
Rituals may be interlinked eg. counting or tapping out a
beat to ensure hands are washed for just the right amount
of time.

Repetition - rituals must be completed many times a day to
prevent disaster striking.
Eg. handwashing after touching each utensil used to prepare
food.

Rumination - thinking centres around what needs to be done
to prevent a disastrous outcome. These thoughts often bubble
along under the surface, and are a considerable distraction.
Eg. Have I washed the dishes? Are they clean? I\'ll have to
check... No, safer to wash them again, just to be sure...

Fear of uncleanliness or infection is a common symptom complex.
Rituals can range from minor (must wash hands for EXACTLY sixty
seconds) to socially difficult (bringing own eating utensils
to a restaurant).

Jack Nicholson\'s performance in "As Good As It Gets" is a
good portrayal of OCD symptoms, apart from the occasional
display of disinhibited behaviour.

*Disorders of Mood
It is normal to experience a wide range of emotions, from joy
to sadness to anger and a myriad of shades in between during one\'s
life. Blunting of this response is not.

Depression
The most common severe psychiatric disorder, depression is a
sustained state of sadness far beyond that considered usual
for a given precipitant, with disabling symptoms.
Fatigue, wide variations in sleep requirement, eating patterns,
and general feelings of inadequacy or worthlessness are some
common symptoms of depression.

In severe cases, withdrawal from social contact can be almost
total. Thoughts of worthlessness, guilt, and even physical
decay remain uppermost in the mind, or become increasingly
difficult to banish.

Psychotic depression arises when one\'s experiences and sensations
are inappropriately filtered through this haze of negative
thoughts.
("I cannot open my bowels ; if I go to the toilet, the stuff
will explode and destroy the city" - a quote from one of the
more memorable mentally ill people I have interviewed).

Bipolar Disorder (aka manic-depressive disorder)
Mood alternates between severely depressed and excessively
elevated.
This latter state is known as mania.

Your thoughts move very rapidly ; it\'s often difficult to
express them to other people, they\'re flying so thick and fast.
It is difficult to concentrate on a given topic. Even
seemingly unrelated ideas will be interconnected, somehow.
(It\'s just that everyone else can\'t think at your level).
Eating and sleeping aren\'t terribly important. You\'ve
never felt so alive. You can do anything, anything at all.

Behaviour is disinhibited and can be quite impulsive,
inappropriate and uncharacteristic eg. excessive spending,
drug abuse, sexual activity.
Bank accounts and reputations have often been devastated during
manic upswings.

Cycling between depression and mania is unpredictable initially.
Those that survive long enough (suicide in 20-30% of those
affected after five years, untreated) tend to settle down into
a more regular pattern.

*Disorders of Reality Perception
One\'s concept of self, and the way the world would appear to
work, evolves over time. By adulthood, most people have a
stable, broadly similar \'model of the outside world\' and
\'self concept\'.
Some however, do not. Stressors ranging from the demands of
work or study, or some drugs of abuse (eg. amphetamines, LSD)
can wreak havoc on these vulnerable persons.
The consequences can be profound and tragic.

Schizophrenia
A global disturbance of perception and thought.
Emotional expression is blunted or inappropriate for a given
situation.
The thought processes become ponderous, but disconnected almost
to the point of randomness.
Hallucinations - abnormal interpretations of ordinary sense data -
are commonplace.

It is quite easy for life\'s ordinary events to acquire undue
significance and/or bizarre explanations as a result.
Eg. the mailman comes by every day because he is watching me...

Paranoia - the delusion that everyone else wishes (to do) you
harm - is a relatively common feature of schizophrenia. It
can also be seen in psychotic depression and delirium (see below).

Such thinking is regarded as delusional when it is impossible
to convince someone that these ideas are inaccurate to some
extent (if not wildly incorrect), regardless of the
assembled evidence.

Like depression, eating and sleeping requirements can vary
wildly.
Like OCD, rituals and rumination are commonplace.
Unlike either of these two illnesses, insight - the recognition
that there are abnormal thoughts and behaviour - is usually
absent.

Delirium
A common occurrence during other illnesses eg. after major
surgery.
Orientation to time, place and person is usually lost.
The actions of people nearby are often interpreted in the most
negative way (eg. "The nurse is here to kill me" or "You\'ve
broken into my bedroom! Get out before I call the police!").

Risk factors : severity of illness, extremes of age, sensory
impairment (blindness, deafness), sedative medications,
drug withdrawal, unfamiliar environment,
sleep deprivation (especially common with busy ICUs), etc.

Delirium is usually self-limiting unless dementia is present,
in which case it may be the initial event leading to the
eventual diagnosis of dementia.

*Falling Ill : Game rules
As mentioned earlier, early adulthood is the most common time for
psychiatric illnesses to become manifest.
For gaming purposes, it may be easiest to have a flat 20% chance
of developing some problem during chargen in the first three terms.

Proposed task :-
To avoid developing a mental illness during chargen :-

Average, (Int+End)/2 each term

+1 difficulty level if survival roll almost fails, dishonorable
discharge or heroic behaviour (post-traumatic stress?).
+1 difficulty level if fails college or other advanced education
(cause or effect?).
+1 difficulty level if abusing psychoactive drugs (moderate to
severe central nervous system stimulants or depressants).
Easy if greater than third term.

Disorders (2D) :-
2 Schizophrenia
3-4 Bipolar Disorder
5-8 Depression
9-11 Anxiety Disorder (phobia, post-traumatic stress)
12 OCD

Severity
For depression, OCD and anxiety disorders :-
1-3 Mild
4-5 Moderate
6   Severe

All other disorders (including post-traumatic stress) are severe.

Game Effects
(Don\'t forget to roleplay!)
Anxiety disorders : triggering factors need to be specified.

To avoid having an anxiety attack :-
(difficulty), (Int+End)/2

Base difficulty is Easy
Mild     Average
Moderate Difficult
Severe   Formidable

Effects of failure, required precipitant :-
Mild : -1 DM to all tasks, require fairly strong trigger eg.
skydiving for first time
Moderate : all tasks one difficulty level harder, average trigger
eg. typical blind date
Severe : all tasks two difficulty levels harder, inappropriate
trigger eg. opening the front door and stepping outside.

OCD :- as above, task is to avoid falling into ritualistic
behaviour.

Post-traumatic stress :- generally moderate to severe.
Task is similar to that above.

Depression :- as above, but deeper depressions require more
powerful triggering factors.
Additionally, 1 point per day is taken from Str, End or Dex to
simulate fatigue. Spectacular Failure on avoidance checks :-
lose 2D promptly to represent decompensation.

Bipolar Disorder :- as per depression, for depressive phases.
Mania :- +1 to Str, End, Dex and Int. All tasks are one level
easier, unless concentration and/or computation are required,
in which case they are one level worse.

A Difficult, End check is made at the end of each week of a manic
upswing to see if it has run its course.

Success or spectacular success : normalisation of mood.
Failure : continues
Spectacular Failure : severe depression ensues.

Until treatment is obtained, roll 1D each month to determine mood.
1-2 depressed, 3-4 normal (interlude), 5-6 manic.

Schizophrenia :- Int and Edu suffer a -2 penalty.
All tasks are one difficulty level harder. These penalties
are an attempt to reflect thought disorder and hallucinations.
Task failure may lead to extreme agitation or catatonic stupor
on Spectacular Failure (dice randomly).
(+2 to physical attributes if agitated ; cannot initiate any
actions if catatonic).

*The Treatment and the Cure
Psychiatry has its beginnings in the \'scientific revolution\'
which is regarded as one of the features of Tech Levels 3 to 4
on standard indices.

Prior to this, the mentally ill were regarded as blessed or
cursed by the gods and warehoused, ignored, revered, or reviled
accordingly.

Competing theories of the genesis and progression of mental
illnesses arise.

Initially, psychotic disorders are treated most vigorously, with
methods ranging from intensive talk therapy through to electroshock,
drug-induced comas and lobotomy (TL 4-5).

By Tech Level 6, effective treatments have arisen for
depression and schizophrenia. Medications control most of the
worst symptoms but have other unintended side effects on the
cardiovascular and nervous system which are often severe.
Minor tranquillisers are widely used to treat anxiety.

By Tech Level 8, it is apparent that anxiety disorders and
OCD are best treated by a combination of cognitive-behavioural
therapy (problem behaviours are identified and strategies
devised to usefully modify or eliminate them) and mild
psychoactive medication.
The biochemical and neurophysiological bases of schizophrenia
and depression are beginning to be seriously explored during
this period.

Increasing knowledge in the fields of molecular biology and
neurophysiology yield highly effective treatments for depression
and schizophrenia by TL 12. These medications are very selective
and thus have no \'spill-over\' side effects.
(TL 12 ; tens of milligram potencies ; moderate nervous system
stimulants or depressants ; rare allergy or intolerance (Major
or Destroyed damage on Spectacular Failure of catastrophe check)
; safety margin 50 ; abuse potential low).
However, treatment is required for life with schizophrenia and
severe depression.

Brain-computer interfaces and memory reading are developed at
TL 14. One of the first uses of the technology is in clinical
psychiatry in an attempt to treat refractory mental illnesses.
The destructive nature of the reading process, combined with the
lack of control over rewriting, soon leads to the abandonment
of the technique in legitimate medical circles.
It is entirely possible that certain technically advanced but
socially repressive societies use such methods to stifle political
dissent or punish other \'criminals\'.

Given the reputed success of psionically oriented societies such
as the Zhodani in treating psychiatric illnesses, a lot of
medical research is devoted to perfecting technological
\'mind reading and reconstruction\' in the Imperium, despite the
prevailing cultural climate.

*Rules
Psychiatrists are doctors with high skill (at least 3) in Psychology
and Interview.
Psychiatric nurses need at least skill 2 in Psychology and Interview.

To diagnose mental illness :
Average, Medical, Edu, uncertain

DMs to uncertainty roll :-
+2 if TL 7+
+3 if TL 9+
+4 if TL 12+

Spectacular Failure : -2 DM to treatment task
Spectacular Success : +1 DM to treatment task

To treat mental illness :
(illness severity), Medical, Edu, uncertain

Severity  Difficulty
Mild      Average
Moderate  Difficult
Severe    Formidable

DMs to uncertainty and success rolls :-
electroshock therapy for severe depression +2 (1)
TL 6+ psychoactive medications +2
Cognitive behavioural therapy (TL 7-8) +2
TL 12+ psychoactive medications +5
Talk therapy for psychotic illnesses -3
Drug comas for any illness -2 (1)

(1) - equivalent to general anaesthetic, requires appropriate
precautions.

Failure : catastrophe check - self-harm attempt made on failure
Spectacular Failure : suicide attempt made (ref specify circumstances)
Spectacular Success : Recovery rate improved by one level.

Illness Severity   Equivalent Damage Level
Mild               Minor (2D)
Moderate           Major (4D)
Severe             Destroyed (6D)

Recovery : as per trauma rules, dice for a random amount of damage
or use points penalties described earlier eg. for depression.

Costs : psychiatric care is equivalent to hospital ward or home
care in this regard. The home care figure is for a psychiatric nurse\'s
visit.
Additionally, twice a week, a psychiatrist must be consulted.
This costs 50Cr for a half hour session.

*Notes and Miscellany
Psychiatry is an important branch of medicine.
It unfortunately provides oppressive cultures with another means
of controlling the populace.
Dissidents can be labelled \'mentally ill\' and be \'hospitalised\'.
Psychoactive medications can be used as adjuncts to interrogation.
Psychosurgical methods can be used to ensure obedience, or at least
suppression of \'problem behaviours\'.

Next time : Equipment, and wrapping up.

Other Notes :-
Banked blood needs to be grouped below TL 9 (incompatible blood
transfusion is equivalent to a Destroyed level drug overdose).
At TL 9+, all banked blood and blood products are stripped of blood
group antigens and this no longer applies.
Ensure group compatibility with impromptu infusions!
Blood requires refrigeration at 4 degrees C. It has a usable life of
eight weeks.

Other IV fluids come in 0.1, 0.5 and 1L bags. Cost is 5Cr per litre.

Local anaesthetics are liquids for injection or topical creams or
patches at TL 7+.

General anaesthetics are available in injectable form from TL 5+.
Continuous IV infusion often supplants inhalational anaesthesia from
TL 9+.

Slow drug (=combat drug) as per fast drug.
Medical slow drug is restricted availability (must prove ability
to provide ICU or hospital ward level care).

Most drugs do not require refrigeration, merely storage in a cool
dry place.

*Investigational Equipment
Laboratories : for simplicity, assume that the shipboard lab module
described in FF&S is equivalent to a ground-based lab.
In a very large hospital or pathology service, each discipline may
require a separate lab eg. anatomical pathology, microbiology,
haematology, biochemistry, etc.

The portable lab :-
The TL 8 portable blood lab is 1.5kg and 1.5L in volume.
A drop of blood is placed in a small well on a cartridge about half
the size of a playing card. The cartridge is inserted into the lab box,
which interrogates the sensors on the cartridge. Analysis is complete
within two minutes. Results are displayed on an LCD screen on the front
of the box.
Cartridges are disposable, and cost 2-4Cr each.
The lab box costs 3000Cr, and runs on a rechargeable battery.

The TL 9 lab can also perform microbiological analyses on body fluids.
It costs 4000Cr. Size and weight are identical. Micro cartridges
are 5Cr each. Results are obtained in five minutes.

Scanners, etc.
X-ray machines are fixed installations at TL 4.
By TL 6, mobile units (300kg, 1m3) are available.
Small (radar gun) sized fluoroscopes are available as early as
TL 5, but their penetrance and resolution is relatively low.

Ultrasound machines begin as large mobile units (300kg, 1-2m3).
Small Doppler (flow/no flow sensing) devices are available by
TL 8, which are the size of a transistor radio).
Small imaging devices do not become available until TL 12 (pocket med
scanner).

CT scanners are fixed installations.
Price begins at 2MCr at TL7 falling to 0.25MCr by TL 9.

MR scanners are fixed installations. Considerable magnetic shielding
is required.
Price begins at 2MCr at TL8 falling to 0.25MCr by TL 10.

Antiproton CT and meson scanners are fixed installations.
Design as C-PAWs or meson guns with a discharge energy of 1kJ and
a range of 2m.

The gravisonic modulator begins as an installation (rate as 1G
inertial compensation for 2m3) and gets smaller as TL improves
(treat as ultrasound : 300kg/1m3 at TL 12, 100kg/0.3m3 at TL 13).

The Medscanner
As described in previous publications.
TL 12, weight 0.2kg, volume 0.1L, cost 10500Cr

Medscanner-computer : TL 12, 2kg, 1L, 25000Cr

*Life Support Devices
TL 7 : dialysis, cardiopulmonary bypass :- 300kg, 1m3

The life support suit :-
TL  Vol/L  Wt/kg   Price/KCr
10  60     30      100
11  40     20      50
12  20     10      30
13+ 20     5       40

Can provide heart/lung/liver/kidney replacement.
Requires surgical procedure to connect to patient.
(Difficult, Medical, Dex).
Has no armour rating.

*Outpatient visits (going to the doctor)
The standard consultation fee is 20Cr for
fifteen minutes.
More eminent physicians may charge much more than this.

The cost of attendances is built in to the cost of
hospital care (see trauma rules), for simplicity.

*Surgical Instruments
Usually considered part of a theatre setup.
The set specified below will suffice for procedures up to Major
level damage ; it has sufficient equipment for a single procedure
in a single region (long or complex surgery may require 6 or more sets
of instruments).

TL  Vol     Weight    Price
4+  4L      4kg       2000

Amendments follow :-

*Doctor\'s bags :-
Drugs carried are to treat common ailments, or resuscitate.
Higher tech level bags contain better drugs and instruments.
Portable labs are usually carried at TL 9+.
Medscanners are usually carried at TL 12+.

*Defibrillators :-
Deliver DC current to the heart in an attempt to \'reset\' the muscle.
Defibrillation is the
treatment of choice in VF, given a normal body temperature.
The energy delivered can be adjusted from 50 to 360J ; typical current
is about 10-40A.
Weight is 10kg, volume 4L at TL 7. The usual power source is a
rechargeable battery.
A defibrillator adds +4 to the chance of treating VF in someone with
pure cardiac standstill.
Otherwise, it adds +1.

Advanced bandages described in the Trauma Notes :-

>For Superficial and Minor injuries :-
>Enhanced wound healing doubles the rate of recovery at TL 9+
>Triples it at TL 12+
>(gentle growth quickening and tissue culture tech)

These are impregnated with growth promoting factors (and repair machines
if your TU permits). Or, they could be a course of pills
to go along with \'dumb dressings\'.
Cost 144Cr per week (TL 9), or (TL X 40) for higher TLs.
Weight is 250g. Volume is 0.25L.

*A few words of explanation
Q : What is \'pathophysiology\'?
Physiology is the science which deals with the normal function of
organs, and entire organisms
(on an individual basis).
Pathophysiology is medspeak for the physical basis of a pathological
(abnormal) process being
discussed, e.g. gunshot
injury.

Q : What are you talking about with airway manoeuvres?
Airway anatomy :-The nose and mouth join in a common pathway at the top
of the throat - the
pharynx.
Just above the \'Adam\'s apple\' in the neck (laryngeal prominence) is the
entry to the windpipe
or trachea, the larynx.
The vocal cords are situated in the top of the larynx. A muscular flap,
the epiglottis, sits
above the laryngeal opening.
It normally protects the lungs from soiling with food on swallowing or
vomitting.(Requires an
intact reflex arc).
The trachea continues into the chest, where it bifurcates to supply each
lung.
Nasopharyngeal airway - nostril to pharynx
Oropharyngeal airway - mouth to pharynx
Laryngeal mask - inserted into mouth, end covers the laryngeal opening.
Endotracheal tube - can be inserted through nose or mouth, end sits in
the trachea above the
bifurcation point.

Surgical airways :-
Just below the laryngeal prominence is a small \'gap\' in the midline.
This is the cricothyroid
membrane.
Making an incision or puncture and passing an airway tube into the
trachea here is relatively
easy.
Tracheostomies - holes in the trachea - can be made below this level.
The utility of surgical airways becomes evident with major facial
injury.

Q : What\'s an analgesic ?
Analgesic : \'painkiller\'.
Mild - aspirin, acetaminophen (paracetamol in U.K. and Aust.), codeine.
Strong - morphine, meperidine (Demerol ; pethidine in U.K. and Aust.)

Q : What\'s a cannula ?
Cannula : an IV line. More precisely, a tube inserted into a blood
vessel to permit vascular
access. Can be peripherally inserted (into limb veins), or centrally
(into jugular or
subclavian veins, etc).
Arterial cannulae are commonly placed in very ill people to facilitate
blood sampling as well
as direct blood pressure measurement.

Q : Define \'hypotension\'.
Hypotension : a level of blood pressure that jeopardises organ
perfusion. Shock becomes evident
when organ dysfunction occurs - usually the brain, lungs and heart
first, hence the symptoms.

yes - it depends on tech level and the ship design.

Max G compensation is 1G at TL10, rising to 6G at TL15.
Most people seem to assume that this G-Comp is the setting that the internal
gravity field can be set to.
Because it is expensive, max G comp will rarely be greater than the G rating
of the ship.
If the ship is built to a budget (or tech limits), with decks perpendicular
to the axis of thrust, the the G-comp can be 1G less than max thrust.
Large military ships would tend to have all the G-Comp possible because
when they spin round to thrust in a different direction, the accelerations
at the extremities can be very high.

Note that you could (in theory) use the G-Comp to reinforce the ship\'s
acceleration so that 5G acceleration - (-5G G Comp) = 10G but I would be
surprised if a Yatch could do more than 2+2 = 4G.

However, I don\'t recall this as being explicitly stated anywhere.
It is possible to interpret G-Comp as specifically something that
cancels out acceleration effects inside the ship (and then you have the
1G artificial gravity so the crew does not float around). In this case
you cannot turn the plates up to 10G as part of the anti hijack routines.

Note
The Vehicle Design System for T4 in the Central Supply Catalog allows G-Comp
to be stacked as much as you want, but that seems to make a mess of the
rest of Traveller by allowing 100G fighters.

Well.... 

Imperial Naval Intelligence.  does most of the military intel work
Imperial Interstellar Scout Service.  does almost everything else

and of course every noble and megacorp keep their own stable of agents.

all of this is IMTU of course.

T4 mentions the "Office of Calendar Compliance".

IMTU this enforces Imperial mandated standards (eg the calendar).

One prospective PC recruit thought that checking the local media mentions
the Emperor\'s birthday on the right date sounded a bit boring.

However I plan to have it investigate all compliance with Imperial policy.
This would include state supported piracy, slavery or the use of
nuclear weapons.

By 1100, it might be part of IISS, or be the Emperor\'s own service,
or perhaps it didn\'t survive the civil wars.

Phil Kitching

You don\'t have to believe the following.
I don\'t.

<conspiracy theory mode = on>

In M0 you\'re rarely more than a few parsecs from the border so piracy
as a form of low level trade war is possible.
As the 3I expands, the activities of the OCC and INI plus a few
"bombed back to the stone age" demonstrations by the IN means that
there should be little piracy in core
sector by 1100.
So all those OCC people are back to checking the Emperor\'s birthday.
Unless there is piracy.
Unless they built corsairs and gave them to detached duty agents.
Unless the agents run round Core sector for a few months - knowing
where all the IN ships will be and only attacking free traders...

Then they could leave the crew and tip off the IN.

This would explain:
	a) why the corsair is designed to capture free traders and
	   scouts but useless in combat with anything else.
	b) Why the anti-piracy ships are few in number and could not
	   combat a properly equipped corsair.
	c) Why the free traders are forever encountering pirates
	   but the IN does not seem to care.
	d) Why the bank rate on those Type A\'s is so low: some may skip
	   payments, but most get captured by pirates within a couple
	   of years and then the bank gets the ship back to "sell" to
	   someone else for 20% down.

The explanation is that the conditions within the jump universe are such that
distance travelled is independent of time (it is dependent on energy instead).
I suppose that can be dismissed as a handwave, but no one can really "explain"
why the equations of our universe produce some of the results they do...
instead, the equations reflect what we observe.

Stats exist, just can\'t remember where right now. Would be one of the

There are lots of really great websites out there with tons of information.  I 
started playing Traveller again after almost 10 years and a lot had changed.  
The Traveller Webring and sites created by the people on this list really helped 
fill in the gaps ... especially because it\'s so hard to get some of that old 
material.  Check out Joe Heck\'s Library Data page at

Fast drug. IMTU a plentiful supply of Fast Drug is standard, mandatory
equipment for all ships.
 
Sufficient emergency low berths for all passengers and crew are also required
for all ships licenced in the Imperium (still IMTU), which is one reason why
double bunking and steerage passengers are not legal (Which dosen\'t mean that
it dosen\'t occur a lot).

Actually, IIRC, there are only a few members of the list who really seem
to object to it. And since we now need carbon dating of the ashes to
determine when _that_ little discussion occured, I don\'t remember their reasoning.

From the viewpoint of someone trying to design small craft for the 57th
century, I found that Fusion+ fit very well, I like it, and use it
enthusiastically, and often. And look: no hair on my palms!

Seriously, without Fusion+ we\'re left with, essentially, incremental
advances on TL-7 powerplants for small vehicles, which is dumb, IMO.

It fits for a high-tech power source. Go ahead, call it a Advanced Fuel
Cell if you want, call it whatever, but it fits a very large hole in the
conceptual landscape for Traveller, between full scale fusion reactors
and, essentially, the V-8; a small, high output energy source for high
tech equipment.

A small nuclear exchange (half dozzen missiles) would not affect Europe
much, since the fallout would mostly drift east.

A large exchange would be unlikely, since the nuking would be one sided.
The most any mideastern country would have are a few smuggled out of
Russia. Probably take out most of Israel, but not much more.

As far as oil, we import most of our oil from South America, Venesuela
mostly. If it were to become nescesarry, we could bring our own oil down
from Alaska, but it\'s less expensive to import from Venesuela.

Question concerning the drives.

Antimatter power plants have fuel that lasts one year. If, by definition, a
jump drive is basically a type of power plant, does it\'s jump fuel last for
the equivalent of one year of use or would it need refueled after a number
of hexes equal to it\'s jump number just like a fusion based plant.

If it lasts for a year, this would basically mean that antimatter jump fuel
allows for 52 jumps at maximum range before the need to refuel, so a jump 2
antimatter drive could move 104 hexes in one year without refueling.

Comments, even from the peanut gallery, will be appreciated.

Agree.  You might have this kind of club for NON-travellers, you know,
those who are amateurs.  But as you point out, those who travel the star
lanes will not have anything like that.  You might have the 100-Star

You forgot the expendables. In MT, as in all the other Traveller versions,
each passenger and crew means an gross expenditure on the part of the ship
accounts of Cr2000 per jump (14 days at the most). As you know, I don\'t
think those espenses are plausible, but they are canonical.

FYI: \'Marquessa is spanish IIRC. The correct English word for the wife if
a marquis or a woman who holds in her own right the position of a marquis
is \'marchioness\'. (\'Marquess\' is a variant spelling of \'marquis\').

Female version is \'Viscountess\'. The rank of viscount in the English
peerage comed between baron and count (Just FYI; its entirely possible
that usage would change in 3000 years). 

>   H          Viceroy/<??>         Viceroy/<??>

FYI: A viceroy is usually a high noble temporarily appointed by a king to
govern in his name some place where he can\'t govern effectively himself.
It\'s just a fancier version of a governor. (Again, things could change in
3000 years.) I\'m unsure what the female version would be. I think the wife
of a viceroy would be addressed by her husband\'s noble title (ie. if the
Duke of Simsalabim was the Viceroy of Faraway, he would be addressed as
viceroy, she as duchess). But I could be wrong.

The two main objections I have to this system is 1) that an Imperial marquis,
some of whom are the rulers of worlds, would be much higher on the social
scale than a planetary marquis (who would be the ruler of, what, 1/100th
of a world; and 2) that planetary rulers would have all sorts of titles
that depended on their individual history. The ruler of Alell is the Captain.
If Alell has a nobility, the titles are propably all taken from starship
ranks. The nobles of a feudal technocracy might be called chairmen, CEOs, and 
Managers. Also, not all dukes are equal. In an (uncanonical) example I came
up with, one society had had a law stating that only nobles were allowed to
serve as officers. Then they had a crisis and had to expand their army a lot,
so they started enobling people left and right, with the result that today
they had barons who owed their titles to an ancestor who was a captain and
dukes that descended from brigade generals (Tableau: At a brilliant gala
ball. A man in a splendid, spiffed-up boiler suit is looking haughtily at a
man in a military uniform with small ducal crowns for rank insignia. Behind
the first man stands a small page carrying a silken pillow on which rests a
jewel-encrusted ceremonial monkey wrench. The first man speaks: "Miserable
worm! How dare you, a mere army duke, address me, The Chief Mechanic, without
being spoken to first?!")

Not all planetary nobilities would be feudal. The king of a constitutional
monarchy propably wouldn\'t be allowed to take oaths of fealthy from the
lower nobles.

>Imperial Viceroy is a title given to one who is in effect Imperial governor

That\'s what I would call an Imperial count. 

>They\'d be directly answerable to the Archduke.

OK, that puts them one level higher in the hierachy and would make them
superior to Imperial counts, but still inferior to Imperial dukes (who
also answers to the Archduke, but control whole subsectors).

If I understand you correctly, you\'re talking about the inertial compensation.
I\'m talking about the artificial gravity, which is a different beast. Inertial
compensation should be at least equal to the G rating of the maneuver drive,
lest the passengers and crew find themselves pasted to walls during high
acceleration periods.

However, the artificial gravity settings are used primary to facilitate
loading/unloading of heavy cargo and to accommodate passengers requiring special
environments.

Why? It says that the ship pops out of jumpspace after 6 weeks, I don\'t
see any requirement for the crew to be alive :-) 
 
Half the problem to solve if this happened would be trying to stay
alive. And I presume the only time you\'d know something was wrong
would be after a week.

Wow, Grav tank configuration debate.  Much more welcome than Piracy threads.

My own opinion is that over the course of history of gravitic combat,
advantages and drawdbacks of each of the proposed designs would emerge and
the actual fielded tank will evolve back and forth over time, as different
design philosophies become more and less fashionable.

In other words, you\'re all right.  Different areas, eras, or political
entities will develop their tanks according to different philosophies.  So
you will see a TL14 port-and-starboard ball turret main armament
rectangular tank alongside a TL13 turret-on-top ovoid tank along with a
TL15 fast-attack forward fixed main weapon tank even within a single
organization.

That said, the turret-on-top tank will benefit from heavy cover, the
fast-attack tank will dominate the far-view battlefield, and the
side-ball-turret tank will do medium well in both arenas.

Milieu 0 has a a nice list of them.  I don\'t have it in front of me
but in addition to the intelligence agencies already mentioned
here, one major intelligence service is the organization run by
the Thrid Undersecretary in the Ministry of (drat! I forgot).

IIRC, the Vilani Bureaux also maintained intelligence services.

  Which means that whatever we do with the Cymbeline chips in our campaigns is
OK, because we\'ll never be directly contradicted by G:T material, at least as
long as we don\'t have Virus affecting other aspects of the TU that SJG will be

  I\'ve got stats for a fuel cell scrawled in on my Striker charts, copied
from B:8, presumably:

 TL  Description        Output  Weight/m^3      Price   Fuel
  8  MHD turbine         0.60     1000 kg       KCr 10   300
  9  Fuel Cell           0.80     1600 kg       KCr 20    30
  9  Fusion              2.00     4000 kg       KCr 200    1.5

  It\'s certainly drastically superior to MHD\'s except for the shortest
performance profiles, and vastly cheaper compared to fusion. IIRC, B:8
also has it scale down more gracefully, inasmuch as fusion gets useless
at a much higher minimum than a fuel cell.

  I suspect that the fuel consumption may be gimped, though (?).

 Or how about sentient/semisentient starport traffic controls? Even the
original Dayo circuits kept a comlplete tamper-proof record of all IFF
signals it had recieved. By having Cymbeline-based Traffic control
networks, the Imperium could basically know what every single ship in at
least a domain-sized area has been up to. Presents some interesting new
dilemmas to PC:s playing fast-and-loose with import/export laws, no?

 BTW, a GURPS TL-12 (traveller TL 15-16) starship mainframe, built
according to CompendiumII rules is only a small step away from sentience
in any case.

 I agree 100%, have been using the very same concept in my Traveller game.
I also give the same bonus for very good astrogation rolls. The latter (in
my game) is actually easier if you are planning to double jump without
slowing down (your N-space vector) in the middle. Thus, if you have fuel
for two jumps, it is not too hard to cover twice your normal jump distance
in 12 days. Of course if you actually _fail_ the astogation roll... not
pleasant.

 Again, I agree. Which reminds me, I seem to recollect, that TNE rulesbook
allows jumps from only 10d away in an emergency (but not to 10d away). Is
this mentioned _anywhere_ else? And how come you can do it one way, but
not the other way? One haphazard explanation I could come up with is, that
since the majority of energy, that goes into the jump is used at entry,
this could be done in a greater interfering gravity, than the emergence 
which relies only on pseudoinertia.

Doh! You\'re right. I never bothered to read that since it was under

	I think maye there should not be a modifier...lasers are after all a light-
speed weapon, and ranges (in MT at least) make it fairly clear that combat is
extremely difficult beyond 1 LS (-1 per square/hex of range, max -DM of 8,
each square/hex 25000km)

So you would feel fine with a nuclear exchange in, say, central America or
the Caribbean?

Realistically, this is a flawed argument. *Chernobyl* went west and
contaminated the UK for example. If you feel fine about a local nuclear
exchange, well, that\'s your problem, but I\'m sure the Egyptians, the
Italians, Greeks and Turks will be somewhat irritated. And don\'t forget

terrorism that Europe has had this century. It\'s really easy to advocate a
limited nuclear war in someone else\'s backyard.

And the US gets hit with a bio/chem weapon or terrorists (lets call them
outraged patriots from the Arab states) borrow a nuke off one of the former
Soviet republics and blow it in a ship in New York or San Francisco harbour
in a suicide attack against those who armed Israel?

Quite possibly - it depends on whether they still have any weapons of MD.

Subject: Antimatter and jump drives.

I am planing out a MT campaign based away from the Imperium. The main
campaign area will be between 2 large states, one of which uses antimater
drives primarily.

Question concerning the drives.

Antimatter power plants have fuel that lasts one year. If, by definition, a
jump drive is basically a type of power plant, does it\'s jump fuel last for
the equivalent of one year of use or would it need refueled after a number
of hexes equal to it\'s jump number just like a fusion based plant.

If it lasts for a year, this would basically mean that antimatter jump fuel
allows for 52 jumps at maximum range before the need to refuel, so a jump 2
antimatter drive could move 104 hexes in one year without refueling.

Comments, even from the peanut gallery, will be appreciated.

- ----
     It was always my opinion that the jump drive consumed the hydrogen and
turned it into energy to power the jump field, that the emitters on the out
side of the ship produced.  Because the energy requirements were so huge it
was not possible to produce a fusion power plant that could produce that
amount of power that did not displace more space than the jump drive
system.  On the other hand you can produce significantly more power with an
anti-matter power plant.  This lead to replacing the drive portion that
converted fuel to power with a large anti-matter power plant, and
conversely an improvement in cargo capacity due to the available space that
was once fuel.  If you determine the amount of energy a fusion power plant
would create with the required fuel for a single jump (remember that was
all the fuel in one great burst of energy, not over a years time frame),
and then multiply it by the total number of jumps possible by the ship you
will have the power requirements for your anti-matter power plant.  If you
hate large amounts of math, just hand wave it.

    'body' => 'Beam dancing started out as a techno-fad in colleges on Terra.
It rapidly spread throughout the Solomani Rim and the Domain of
Sol, and from there into the rest of the Imperium.  Today, it is
considered a mainstream art form throughout the Imperium, and it
is not unknown outside it.

In beam dancing, the performer stands upon a mirrored stage
floor, with a set of low-power lasers and sensors in an overhead
unit.  The lasers, which may use frequencies in the near
infrared, visible, or near ultraviolet, form a network of beams
that the performer will interrupt in the course of the
performance.  Breaking a beam causes the sensor to send a signal
to a connected audiosynthesizer\'s computer, which acts on its
program to generate an audible response.

Beam dance stages are available in a wide range of sizes and
configurations.  For the occasional home-use dilettante, a basic
stage is square, 1.5m on a side, with a combined overhead beam
projector/sensor array, and programming console.  Any number of
this type of unit can be linked together to form larger units
(for multiple simultaneous dancers), for use at (for example)
parties or where the unit cannot be left set up permanently.  A
multiple-unit array can be programmed from a single console, or
each unit can be programmed individually from its own console.
Nightclubs and dance-halls, or other locations where the stage
can be left standing permanently, can generally obtain custom-
designed units, usually with a bank of vertically mounted sensors
around half the unit and a custom console.  These custom units
are generally programmable to allow variation of the projector
frequencies and to permit differing responses from sensors when
different frequencies (or none at all) are detected.

Some beam dancers will wear mirrored or partially-mirrored
clothing, ranging from just mirrored gloves all the way to
full-body coverage.  Often, the projectors will be configured to
use visible light, allowing the performer to couple a light show
with sound.

Most professional beam dancers program the stage themselves or
hire beam console programming specialists to do it to their
specifications, often with highly customized programs.  There is,
however, a wide range of preprogrammed console packages for
dancers without the skill to do their own stage programming, or
the money to hire a professional.

By far, the majority of professional beam dancers are solo
performers.  Most multiple-dancer performances are "complementary
solos", where each performer is effectively dancing on a separate
stage, with complementary programs for each performer.  Such
complementary solos have been known to have as many as six
performers.  Much more difficult, technically, but yielding a
richer performance, are the interactive multiples, where both
dancers are dancing on the same stage, with the same program, and
interacting with each other.  Few dancers, even at the
professional level, have the skill to consistently turn out good
performances in this mode, and those that do are guaranteed to
have sellout crowds.

YO, DOM! Have you been watching some more of those FBI training films?  Gee,
I guess the way your looking at it we Americans were responsible for the
Indians and the Pakistani\'s getting nukes too.  Hey lighten up man, it was
meant as a joke the way I read it.  Dangerous Dave Golden even came back in
with a comment that it was tongue in cheek to start with.  Nobody I know of

[much interesting design discussion deleted]
So you will see a TL14 port-and-starboard ball turret main armament
rectangular tank alongside a TL13 turret-on-top ovoid tank along with
a TL15 fast-attack forward fixed main weapon tank even within a single
organization.

That said, the turret-on-top tank will benefit from heavy cover, the
fast-attack tank will dominate the far-view battlefield, and the
side-ball-turret tank will do medium well in both arenas.

************************
"Single organization" has to be battalion level or above.

I expect the side-ball-turret tank would be especially good in urban
situations.  In the urban context, a bottom turret might also be
helpful, because even if you\'re not very high in a city, there may
still be targets below.  

Striker allows multiple turrets in vehicle design.  I don\'t recall
whether The Adjutant\'s tank designs included any with
side-ball-turrets, but if anyone has these readily available, it would
be worth checking.

This part I knew, in fact, it states *for power plants* that the fuel will
last longer at lower outputs.

Now, what about the jumps? :)

I note from the table of jump fuels that the ratio of fuel to jumps gets
significantly lower above TL16, just when antimatter fuel becomes standard.
This, to me, infers that the fuel is antimatter and not hydrogen.
Therefore, if it is antimatter, what\'s the duration?

Sorry if that makes no sense, could you define "idle" as far as jump drives
go. My understanding of jump drive operations is that it is either idle, or
initiating a jump, there is no other setting. A jump drive\'s fuel at idle,
be it antimatter, hydrogen, or duck feathers will last for infinity.

The fall-out would go towards Pakistan, India and China, all of whom
possess nukes. This means that the \'small\' muclear echange becomes a rather
bigger one. BTW volcanic dust from eruptions circles the entire globe in a
matter of days, so the fall-out will, too. The Middle East is on about the
same latitude as the southern US, so expect some increase in background
contamination in your country, too. Remember the effect Chenobyl (sp?) had
od Western Europe?

The Walsh Class secure trader travels to those areas where normal merchants
are reluctant to go, and is equiped with superior firepower and defenses.
It is designed to QSDS1.5, and the only change is the replacement of HePLAR
with T-Plates, plus the addition of a sandcaster. The armour is
consequentially lower.

Not in FF&S2 it isn\'t. Pg. 80 explicitly states that the same inertial
compensators that counteract the ship\'s acceleration also provide
artificial gravity. The force that pushed you down on the floor is the same
one that counteracts the ship\'s acceleration, just in a different direction.

IMTU ships need an extra G of compensation to handle external gravity
forces and ship rotation, so ships with decks perpendicular to the axis of
thrust need compensation up to their maximum thrust, and ships with
parallel decks need 1 more than their max. acceleration. In emergencies you
can fasten down everything that\'s movable and handle 1 more G. This same
tactic can be used in fighters.

And it is also used to counteract ship acceleration. Yes, I know that some
referees state that inertial compensators only dampen ship acceleration and
cannot provide artificial gravity, but there is no separate step or
components in ship design for providing artificial gravity, so this is not
supported by the rules. Moreover if, as has been done in some campaigns,
you can vary artificial gravity arbitrarily then why don\'t naval architects
just encase rooms in these magic zero-cost zero-power gravity generators
and let ships accelerate at 10 Gs?

Maybe this doesn\'t apply in space, but don\'t current fighter craft routinely pull 4
to 7 G\'s more than is compensated (i.e. no compensation).  Without air  to push
against, I don\'t see how you could pull more G\'s than your maximum thrust.  You may
also be referring to added G\'s without hampering piloting skills, or perhaps
extended use of extra G\'s.

Strephon can\'t be killed?  I just thought there no Imperium wide rebellions
caused by any assassinations.  Strephon just gained "canonical" (or rather
contractual) invulnerability. Wonder if he knows...  ; )

Isn\'t there a much larger chance of infection, etc if the bullet is stuck in
the body?  It would certainly necessitate surgery for removal... also in this
same vein, aren\'t exit wounds much more severe or should this be considered as
part of hte total damage?  Maybe less damage if theres no exit wound?

I am not proposing increasing damage beyond that of what a weapon does, but am
thinking of a player\'s question "what happened to the bullet?" and not having
a (non ad-hoc) answer... 

This is more of a question of incidental effects of damage... broken bones,
etc for melee (i\'m just converting over the house system i use for ad&d, so
far), but what about other weapons?  Gauss weapons?  I\'m envisioning a doctor
picking these things out like cactus needles <g>or a guy that looks like an
overgrown thimble...  Also what about plasma/fusion weapons?  Some pretty
severe burns, assuming the victim isn\'t completely destroyed (like wounds from
such while wearing combat armor or battle dress).

What is the duration of this g-loading? 5 seconds? I would assume
that a traveller ship could do the same, with similar results, but
again, only for a few seconds (more with less loading, obviously).
traveller space combat turns have gone from 20 to 100 minutes a
turn, a rather long time to be at 6gs :-)

He mentions rotation, above. It\'s really easy to get accelerations 
that are quite high due to rotation of the hull. That\'s where a ton
of other loading could apply.

Quite possible.
What are the units of that fuel consumption figure? kL per hour per m3
plant? (don\'t have Striker, assume it\'s like MT design system)
What fuel does it burn? Hydrogen, petroleum distillates or alcohol?
Is LOX included in the fuel figure?

30kL fuel gets 0.8MW-hour usable power.
Candidate fuels :-
Diesel or gasoline : 36MJ/L
Ethanol : 21.3 MJ/L
LH2 : 0.84 MJ/L
LHCryo (LOX/LH2) : as per LH2. Multiply volume by 1.5 (more, to
represent separate tanks?).

0.8MW-hour equals (8 X 10^5 X 3600) or 2.88 X 10^9 J

Required fuel volume at 100% efficiency, L :-
Diesel/gasoline : 80L
Ethanol : 135.2
LH2 : 3428.8
LHCryo : 5143.2

The H2 / O2 fuel cells used in the US space program had an overall
efficiency of 58%.
By TL 9, 70-75% efficiency should be attainable for this cell. I assume
the necessary catalysts to burn hydrocarbons are a TL 9
development.

If we assume 75% efficiency, we need to increase fuel volumes
by a factor of 100/75, which leaves us in the worst case scenario
(LOX/LH2) with a required volume of 6857.6L - less than a quarter
of the listed figure.

For gasoline it gets ridiculous - 106.67 L - a factor of 281!

I think I saw something like this on a PBS Scientific American Frontiers this
past season.  They had a whole bunch of interactive instruments.  One was a
field that sensed where you put your hand and made a corresponding noise.
There was another that used a baton in a similar fashion.

Read the article. Then if you are so inclined, you should be able to
build a "demonstrator" model for a few hundred bucks.

The principle is "electrostatic inertial confinement". You have a set
of "spherical" grids, inside a vacuum tube type setup. The ions
(Hydrogen, Deuterium, or even exotics like Boron-11) get accelerated
towards the center. There they either hit head on and fuse, or miss and
get slowed down as they climb against the potential gradient. They then
come to a stop and accelerate back in towards the center for another
pass. 

Even more interesting, it should be possible to extract the power
generated *directly* as electricity! 90-95% efficiencies may be
possible. 

And these *won\'t* go "boom".

Gee, great minds think alike. Saturday I was gun shopping with a friend
(I need a hunting rifle). We got to joking about nasty weapons systems
and came up with a quite similar weapon. 

Ours was a low speed mini-gun/gatling firing 4-gauge (yes *four*)
shotgun shells thru barrels optimized for maximum dispersal. We picked
4-guage because there were riot guns produced in that gauge in the
early part of the century. So this was an "obvious" upgrade. 

I say "low speed" because when you are firing shotgun shells anyway,
there\'s no *point* in firing hundreds a minute. 

BTW, we called ours the "street sweeper". And then we decided to offer
a model based on an upgraded street sweeper chassis, so it\'ll clear a
path thru the gore as it goes. (BTW, you *were* aware that those
brushes on street sweepers have *steel* bristles, weren\'t you? :-)

I think Marc would have to decide if that violated the license agreement. In
the past, he has indicated that he has no problem with articles appearing in
Pyramid which cover all versions of Traveller, but I don\'t think he has
addressed this question specifically. As far as I know, no one has submitted
an article like that, so the matter hasn\'t come up yet. 

We\'ll deal with it when it does...

OK. You can break the law of gravity too, if you like. Do the laws of cartoon
physics apply IYTU? (every other reaction has an equal and opposite reaction,

Ok, I\'ll one up you :)

Small, semi-automatic launcher similar to a tear gas shooter, but longer
range and loaded with cluster bombs. Iraqi\'s hated our cluster bombs, and
I\'d imagine your local rioters would think twice about reassembling after a
small dose of these.

I know, evil, but then again, a good GM has to think about both sides of
the coin.

Excuse me? Watts (and megawatts) are a *rate of flow*, not an amount.
Energy is measured either in Joules, or in units of power*time such as
kilowatt-hours or megawatt-hours.

The problem I have with Fusion Plus is that it out-competes fusion for many
to most applications, because it is cheaper for the same power output.

As an example, assume a 200 dton Far Trader with a 150 MW power plant.
Using Fusion, it\'s 75 m3 of power plant at TL12, costing MCr 15 (scale
efficiencies at TL13 and up will cut these numbers a little). On the plus
side, it needs about 2 m3 of fuel per month.

Now, using The Abomination Known As Fusion Plus, it\'s 35 m3 of power plant
at TL12, costing MCr 0.35. On the minus side, it uses 0.0525 m3 of fuel per
hour, or 1.1 m3 per day. The fuel costs Cr 350 per m3.

Now, under standard financing, taking the fusion plant (MCr 15) at standard
financing turns into KCr 60 per month, or call it KCr 55 more than going
with TAKAFP.

KCr 55 buys about 150 m3 of deuterium fuel, which is much more than the 35
m3 or so that the TAKAFP plant will need per month.

Therefore, by going with TAKAFP you save about KCr 40 a month on the
payments on a Far Trader.

The problem isnt the use of TAKAFP in small vehicles - yes, we do need
something better than turbocharged straight-eights for grav bikes - but
it\'s use in big ones.

	I think the point he was trying to make is "10 megawatts of power
<<PLANT CAPACITY>> costs a megacredit ..." -- so merchant ships
wouldn\'t buy one erg more capacity than necessary. *Certainly* not
enough to run every single system on the ship at full output
simultaneously ...

Classic Trav stats are in the Traveller Adventure
MegaTrav stats are in the Rebellion Sourcebook
TNE stats are in the World Tamer\'s Handbook.

Deckplans based on the MT version are on my harddrive...

 Despite the kind words of Mr. Letterworks, I don\'t consider them quite ready
for primetime. If I did (and when I do) they would be on my website.  They ARE
high on my list, but at the moment plans for a variant Type C and a Corvette
I found at someone else\'s site are higher.  The Hammerhead Patrol Cruiser went
up last week...

Just a wild idea to augment the sensor "dome", Why not have a few grav
powered detachable sensor domes, give them a target designator and tight
beam maser link to the gun ships weapons crewperson. They can then
illuminate targets, launch missiles and call down fire missions. The pilot
in this time keeps the gun ships suvivability up by terrain following and
active evasion. The only (intentially) exposed element are the targeting
drones.

The existance of secondary or anti personnel weapon for \'soft targets\'
(like ditched vehicle crew) isn\'t an issue. This is for those targets of
conveniance that arn\'t worth using main (guided munutions) armerment for.

The principle of suvivability is for a vehicle like this not armour or
speed/evasion but not being located.

Any counter ideas are welcome.

I was privileged to see something similar last year when I was still in air
traffic control.  Got to go up to Amberley and watch the F-111\'s strut
their stuff.  There\'s talk now of re-engining them with F110\'s and keeping
them \'till 2020.

I can\'t believe that the US got rid of theirs (more spares for us tho\').

So basically, the only problem you have with it can be solved by a
simple rules change: that F+ powerplants decrease dramatically in
efficiency above a certain size, say a cubic meter or two, keeping the
maximum power generated by them to some limit, making them ideal for
small vehicles, but not workable for starships. (There\'s already been
significant discussion of having one large pp vs. littering your
engineering deck with 300 little Honda generators...) At a 2m^3 limit,
at TL-12, a F+ plant will generate 9.6 mw, while a Fusion reactor that
size isn\'t possible, leving a gap, but that\'s what drives the research
into reducing fusion plants.

I\'d have to look at the stats for them, but the smallest the upper size
limit should be is to power one of those small fighters mentioned in T4
and M0 as Syleas great tactical advantage, explicitly stated as due to
F+ power plants...

This is a rules hack I can live with...

First of all there is Imperial Naval Intelligence (INI).  This is
the Imperial Navy\'s military intelligence department.  Of course,
not everything the INI  does  is  \'cloak & dagger\'  ...  it  also
collects and coallates low level  intelligence  (publication  and
vid broadcast monitoring), and issues press releases on behalf of
the Imperial Navy.

There have also been one or two  references  the  Imperial  Naval
Counter-Intelligence.  This may be separate to INI or  an  office
within the INI.

Prior to the Fifth Frontier War,  Lord Santanocheev  created  the
INI\'s rival (and incompetant) Office of Naval Information.

Also be  aware  that  the  \'Imperial Navy\'  is  composed  of  the
Imperial Navy itself,  and  the  Colonial  Navies  (at  subsector
level).  These colonial navies probably have their  own  military
intelligence departments, as would the military of  every  planet
(planetary navy, COACC, wet navy, and army).

The Imperial Interstellar Scout Service (IISS) as a whole  is  an
information gathering organisation.  But  \'cloak & dagger\'  stuff
tends to be  carried  out  by  the  Intelligence  Branch  of  the
Detached Duty Office, and the Security Branch of  the  Operations
Office.

The Imperial Ministry of Justice (MoJ)  is  a  sort  of  Imperial
equivelent to the US\'  FBI.  In  850  some  of  the  non-military
responsibilities of the INI were transferred to the  MoJ  as  the
\'Ministry of Justice  Special  Branch\'  (JSB)  ...  although  the
existance of the JSB was not publically achnoleged until 1080.

Every megacorporation has its own intelligence functions  ...  in
some cases left over from the days of the First Imperium when the
Vilani megacorporations (or Bureaus) were part of the government.
(Trivia: the \'Vemene\' is the covert  security  agency  of  Tukera
Lines.)

The Bureau of Interstellar Affairs  (BIA),  in  addition  to  its
public functions,  maintains  a  series  of  covert  intelligence
gathering operations.

There  are  also  numerous  planetary   \'civilian\'   intelligence
organisations   (usually  some  sort  of  local  law  enforcement
department).   They  may  unofficially  operate   outside   their
jurisdiction areas.

Many nobles have spies ... from a few individuals  to  full-blown
organisations.

Finally, there are security firms which may dabble  in  \'cloak  &
dagger\' on behalf of their client (and for a fee).

Hope that answers your question.

Just to point out- Pyramid has always said it is an independent magazine. In
the past it has had articles for many other gaming systems (Vampire, Mage,
Paranoia) as well as covering Steve Jackson Stuff. The neat thing is that
somtimes an article has stats for different systems, like the adventure
written for Cyberpunk 2020, GURPS Cyberpunk and Cyberspace.

There is one adventure on line in the archives of Pyramid for non-GURPS
Traveller (though I think I will run it in my FUDGE GURPS Traveller game).

If the editorial policy is that Pyramid is a generic magazine that publishes
for any game then there should have no problems with articles or adventures
set in the TNE era, as long as it doesn\'t give GURPS stats or ways to use
the adventure in the GURPS Traveller universe.

I would like to put together a set of rules to fit my particular
preferences in SFRPG space technology. They are:

Helpar is the primary space M-Drive. It can\'t be used directly in an
atmosphere (possibly a modified set of pipes could turn it into a heat
engine).

Inefficient power generation could occur while under thrust. Efficient
power generation requires no Heplar running.

I see planetary takeoffs and landing being performed with Contra-Grav
until the vessel hits the upper, very thin atmosphere. Power would be
generated for the Contra-Grav because the Heplar would be off. The
Heplar could be lit at the outer reaches of the atmosphere. 

I should note that I see a tractor/repulser technology as being
equivalent to Contra-Grav (as long as there is an energy balanced
action/reaction force occurring). I just don\'t want to use reactionless
thrust plates.

I think this could be an interesting setting in which to game. You\'d
have to balance energy between systems. Make a decision, fire beam
weapons or run away? I would expect a small efficient reactor to be
cooking along to cover basic power needs and set of accumulators to
store power. 

I refer to this as a MultiDrive in my game and would like to better
flesh it out. Is it remotely possible?

Thanks,

A good concept but I would still say you need to consider defenses (speed,
armor, active/passive ECM in various combinations) and secondary defensive
weapons up to being able to deal with light vehicles and infantry.  Sure, no
one wants to be detected but PBI (Poor Bloody Infantry) have the damnedest
habit of showing up in the most inconvenient places (I know, I\'ve done it more
then a few times myself on "secure" units and compounds).  Also, with such a
missile platform working close to the main battle area the other side is
likely to develop light hunter/killer AFV\'s to find and kill it.

Again, it\'s a good idea and appears to combine aspects of a chopper gunship
with those of modern missile tank destroyers (ie. M901) but it\'s own defenses
and Murphy should not be ignored.

ISTR that someone (maybe even in canon) pointed out that once the
breakthroughs are made, the technology can be maintained at a lower level
using standard designs etc. If I remember correctly, the example of the
Romans having the technology to make SMGs was used as an example. So
perhaps both are correct? \'Off the shelf\' standard units can be built at a
lower tech level, but actual design and understanding of the theory and
principles requires a higher tech level. Perhaps it\'s just something so
mundane as the order of magnitude processing power jumps in computer tech
described in T4 etc... It could be made to fit.

The F-111s themselves were quite long in the tooth as attack bombers go.
Not that they wouldn\'t be useful, but the USAF tends to put money into
newer aircraft.  The bird that continued to fly until recently was the
Electronic Warfare version, the EF-111.

If I recall correctly, There was too much airframe cracking going on to
keep the EF-111s on active duty despite the reliance on those birds almost
exclusively for Electronic Warfare.  If there were any chance of saving
them, there would have been quite an investment made.  I think the USAF has
been trying to get a new EW airframe for quite some time through congress,
with no success.  Not suprising since sucha n aircraft is one ofthe most
expensive in the inventory.

Look for an F-15EF or maybe a B-52EW or something with lots of carrying
capacity to fill the EW role in the near future.

What I find amazing is the decision to keep the U-2 recon planes flying.
They are somewhat vulnerable to high-performance SAMs, but so much less
expensive to operate than the SR-71 (Their replacement) and besides, there
aren\'t any SR-71s in USAF active inventory (NASA has one or two).

ObTrav:  The Imperial Navy upgrades their fleet on an ongoing basis, but of
course the relative backwater worlds get the TL15 replacements cycled in
much later than the frontline units in, say, Regina or Mora, and the worlds
near Capital get them earlier too, since the opportunity to show off the
latest and greates to the Imperial citizenry is too much temptation to
avoid.

So what do you suppose passes for the Colonial Reserve fleets of Glisten
and other \'interior\' subsectors?  TL13?  TL12?

On the other end, what quite useful TL13 craft are still filling a critical
role in the Imperial Navy\'s frontline units?  Rampart Fighters (which
probably can\'t get much less effective vs real ships anyway)?.

  IIRC, it\'s litres per hour per MW. TL 8- is hydrocarbons at rd 1,
fusion is L-Hyd a rd 0.07 (?); I din\'t recall what B:8 specifies

  You could probably build light-weight personal grav vehicles under
Striker using a combination of batteries and a small fuel cell; the
batteries would be required to sustain flight, and the fuel cell would
recharge them otherwise.

  OC, the high cost of batteries in Striker (?) may be a problem here.

the trader or the station.  There was power to the station and the trader,
and neither showed any signs of a struggle.  The station has been
identified as a remnant from before the rule of man.
     An insurance agency has also contacted you about finding a ship that

Nope, the only one I have any sense of paranoia about is Israel, which has
come into quite a lot of high tech weapons via the US. Maybe I phrased it

Israeli actions to some degree...

I accept that Dave meant it in jest - however, the follow on post was
arguing that a \'limited nuclear war\' in the middle east would be of little
consequence. Which is why I blew.

Sure - this was not meant as an anti-US tirade, even if I can\'t get an
English version (language and units) of GURPS Traveller ;-) Apologies if it
read as such.

IMTU, most ships out in the Spinward Marches (circa 1100), to include
the IN, are built at less than TL15, in order to maximize the local
sustainability of the ships.  Standard construction is TL12, with higher
TLs built for specific needs.  For instance, the BROOKLYN and ST. LOUIS
classes of light cruiser are built at TL13, in order to allow for J-4
capability (the two are built on nearly-identical hulls; BROOKLYNs have
meson spinal mounts, and ST. LOUISs have PA spinal mounts).  I emphasize
that these are new-construction vessels, not centuries-old relics.

Obviously, YMMV.

I think that in 3d the problem simplifies greatly although you may
always need to move further under manuever drive.  The majority of Solar
Systems would appear to be in the Galactic Plane, therefore if you move
at 90 degrees from the galactic plane for a distance of 100.000001 times
the Steller Diameter then you should be able to jump in any direction
you like, presumably to a similar distance above/below the planet of
destination so that the destination sun\'s 100D would not intefere with
you either (more difficult in binary/trinary systems).

I am not sufficiently knowledgeable about astronomy to know the answer
to this, but is it possible to site a star-base in geo-stationary orbit
above the pole of a planet?  If so you could place one above (and
possibly one below) a planet and transfer all trade items to a local
"tramp" ship that would take the goods/people down to the planet.

Prior to meeting the 2 I\'s (plus a load of other Armoured/Light Cruisers

only success to my knowledge was in destoying two RN cruisers, (Good

The I\'s were also in the Mediteranean in 1914 and might have bumped into

did succeed in the intended task of destroying Armoured Cruisers.

I assume by your reference to deep meson guns that you are referring to
T4/FF&S2 (I don\'t have TNE so don\'t know if they were introduced then).

be able to have multiple "parallel" mounts that are 80% max the length
of the ship mounting them.  I have designed a T4 ship carrying 6
parallel meson\'s using this concept organised as two 3 gun batteries.  

I would hate to think what an 80% length meson would look like on a
10MTd hull, especially if it was in a Needle configuration.

This looks like a good challenge - I will report back if the design
looks good.

Keven I like your comments on Pirates, and have believed that although
some arguements show that Piracy is uneconomical, the most Canonical
sentence that I can think of shows that Marc Millar intended that Piracy
was not only possible but likely.  I first saw this sentence in 1977,
can I introduce those of you who may be younger than me to it: "This is
Free Trader Beowulf, calling anyone...".  Now I don\'t feel that they are
complaining about being boarded by Customs & Excise or probably the
local Navy, or IN.  Their attacker is probably a pirate or privateer, it
doesn\'t matter which, the effect is the same from Beowulf\'s point of
view.

As I believe that Piracy is possible, my Starship Design Bureau has come
up with an interesting design.  It is code-named Ninja, and resembles in
all outward appearences a Sub-M, but is in fact a TL15 T4 design capable
of Man-6 and carrying 6 parallel Meson Guns organised as 2 MFDs of 3
guns each.  The first thing that a pirate is likely to know about it is
when their crew start dying, or when the full man drive kicks in.  The
guns are fixed to fire forwards only, but are designed using the Deep
Meson concept so they are 80%/1.1 times the max length of the ship
long.  They may not be very strong, but I wouldn\'t expect a pirate ship
to have a Meson Screen, so a penetration is vitually guaranteed (the
ship also has 3 computer(9fib).

I would expect that outbound jump points would point directly to the
star that you are jumping to, and there won\'t be many of those
especially if you are targetting Jump-1 Sub-Ms.  The T4 rules also state
that it takes 1 hour to build the Jump Bubble before you can jump, so if
the Sub-M was jumping with zero vector (the safest way) then they would
be hanging around stationery for some while.  A running jump is of
course more economical as you can accelerate all the way out then when
you finish your jump you can decelerate all the way in.  This would of
course imply that the SDB knows the likely jumping out areas (probably
only 1 or 2 per world) and would hang around there.

Omnesium Quest was revised down from a trilogy of 56 page volumes to a
single 104 page volume in an announcement in MTJ 2. Manhunt was advertised
in Digests 20 & 21, with what looks like Rob Caswell\'s deckplans for Seeker
class, as well as some other illos.

That depends on who owns copyright. Now, if IG haven\'t paid for work the
commissioned I suspect the author still owns the rights, (Bloo?),
especially if they put the copyright disclaimers in the work. I\'d like to
see some of that material (in addition, DGPs AI would have been nice) too.
The best we\'ve had so far is Paul Sanders recovered Keith books.

Well, if you can hold on a couple of more days, I\'m working on an
"Up Close and Personal" on Shuchithra.  Recordings, I can\'t help
you with.  Yet.  But the tech isn\'t that far in advance of what
we\'ve got today; with the right encouragement, you might see it
in ten or fifteen years.

The first one sounds like it might have been a theremin, which
dates back quite a ways.  It\'s entirely possible that the author
of the book that described the art form that inspired my post
knew about the theremin, and extrapolated.

On another list I am on, it was noted that the USAF is already conducting

Um...the practical upper limit for railgun velocity is maybe 10 kilometers per
second.  At this rate, your shots will take more than a turn to cross a single
brilliant lances hex, and have essentially zero chance to hit any enemy vehicle
at any significant range.  As such, the net effect is \'wow, you wasted weight
and volume on a totally useless weapons system\'.

Note that the use of railguns in the HH books sounds reasonable -- it\'s just an
electromagnetic missile launcher.

I can send you a copy of the adventure that I sent into Pyramid (they
are still considering it, but I can\'t see why they would object to
your using it).  It might be a bit long for a "one-shot" but you
could cut out some of the encounters....

Note that Intel Branch does not report via Operational Control, but reports

Dont forget Internal Mapping Branch and External Mapping Branch of Imperial
Grand Survey, which do report to Operations Office via Operational Control.

Contact and Liason Branch in the Exploration Office have the role of
\'locating, making first contact (and maintaining friendly relations) with
non-human intelligent races\'. They do report to Operations Office via
Operational Control.

Translation : there are at least five agencies within the IISS that deal
with Intelligence, and not all of them report through the same channels.

Have fun ... I\'m sure they do :)

That is with our current TL of 7 to 8...  Would it not be higher at TL 9+?

Think about it, a 100 kg chunk of iron slamming into a ship at 10 km/s will
do some major damage, will it not?

I do have LBB 6.  But I am curious: do you consider the  Internal
Mapping Branch, the External Mapping Branch, and the  Contact and
Liaison Branch to be in the \'Cloak & Dagger\' category?  I suppose
pre-First Contact missions run by the  Contact and Liaison Branch
might be considered as such, but the original post was a question
about Imperial \'cloak & dagger\' style spy organisations.  Or  did
I miss something?

IIRC as of last year the RAF still had an operational squadron of
EW  variant  Canberra  aircraft.   The  first  prototype  of  the
Canberra flew in 1949, as opposed to 1955 for the U2.

In a recent NATO naval wargame a lone \'enemy\' Canberra  was  able
to spoof a ship captain into  \'destroying\'  his  own  fleet:  The
spoofed ship found all its communications were being  jammed  but
were able to  get  in  communications  with  a  friendly  frigate
captain, a helicopter, and an AWACS.  The captain of the  frigate
reported that he was under attack by a number of \'enemy\' vessels,
which  the  AWACS  and  helicopter   confirmed,   and   requested
assistance.  Our captain dutifully helped out  by  \'launching\'  a
missile attack on the coordinates supplied by  the  AWACS.  After
the exercise was over it was revealled that the frigate  captain,
helicopter, and AWACS were just different crewmen of the  \'enemy\'
Canberra ... and the coordinates for the missile attack were  for
his own fleet (which he sunk)!

Moral: Never underestimate something just because  its  old,  and
remember your radio procedures.

ObTrav:  IMTU I see the officers and crew of the Colonial  fleets
being more ingeneous and maverick than their complacent  Imperial
Navy counterparts.

Skeletal (striated) muscle vs. smooth (non-striated). You can\'t get more
selective than that without antibody cocktails (not across skin) or
nanotech (sky\'s the limit).

Assuming simple pharmacology, this stuff will knock out your diaphragm
and intercostal muscles, making it impossible to
breathe (or be ventilated, if it came to that) ; and possibly cause
fractures if the spasms are intense enough.

What are the effects of overdose? If the agent lasts for more than four
minutes, you\'ve got a brain dead (or dying) rioter on your hands who you
can\'t clear an airway for (jaw spasmed shut?) or ventilate (stiff chest
wall) on whom paralysing agents might not work (receptor competition
with \'Spazm (TM),(R), etc\'?).

This generates bad PR for the authorities.
Then again, they might not care.

The most effective riot control agent for a brutal regime is a 0.2% mist
of n-heptane.
This will induce general anaesthesia in 90% of humans that get a
lungful (which is why some people sniff petrol or gasoline).
Unfortunately, you\'re going to have a fatality rate of at least 25% due
to the toxic effects on the heart, as well as the complications of
unprotected airways (breathing in one\'s lunch, for example).

N-heptane also has this advantage : you can always light it.

Yes, if sufficient acceleration can be maintained to oppose the
gravitational pull of the primary.

Robert Forward patented the concept of the \'statite\' or stationary
satellite in 1989.
It uses a lightsail to provide the acceleration.
The only problem is that with current technology, you need to be about
200 Earth radii away to keep the sail, etc. \'aloft\'.

Note that geosync altitude is 6 Earth radii.

T5 is (and has been since mid last year) in design, with the intention that we
find a publisher as the final date comes closer. Drafts have been circulated
for Character Generation (through TML), Tasks and Skills (through TML), Minor
Race Generation (limited), and Ship Design (limited)

This is the first shot over the bow (so to speak) as I get closer to a final
draft for the next edition.

What is in T5?

Vision: The goal of T5 is to bring together the design and play experience of
Traveller so far and create a long-lasting, well-thought-out science-fiction
rules system for the Traveller universe. The game system should be
understandable and easily playable, incorporate multiple levels of complexity,
mesh with the real world (in so far as is possible).

Structure: The central rules structure of T5 consists of a core rules book
(T5), a companion, a technical architecture book (perhaps itself divided into
three volumes ships, equipment/weapons, and vehicles), and an atlas. Only T5
will appear initially. Our intention is to develop the equivalent of FF&S
intandem so that it expands T5 rather than supplants it.

The rules structure will support all milieux, although it will provide
examples and details for one milieu (probably M:0, and probably set in the
Antares sector).

T5 Contents: The T5 volume will contain the following rules sections

A. Introduction. Foundations of Traveller. Basic Players Guide. Basic Game
Masters Guide. Dice and Probabilities.
B. Characters (separate chapter discussing who they ar eand what they do).
Character Generation (Army, Marines, Navy, Merchants, Nobles, Scouts,
Entertainers, Agents, Rogues, Scholars, Citizens, and Functionaries).
C. Skills. Tasks.
D. Every Adventure Begins and Ends At A Starport.
E. Space Travel. Ship Operations. Ship Economics. Ship Design. Ship Combat.
F. Worlds. World Generation. World Surfaces. Terrain. Travel on Worlds.
Encounters. Animals. 
G. Special Activities. Noble Lands. Scholar Research Projects. Trade and
Commerce. Scout Surveys. Naval Patrols. Military Missions.

New To T5. 

Cards. T5 introduces a variety of cards (commonly 2.5 x 3.5) for Equipment,
Weapons, Vehicles, Ships, Characters and NPCs, etc. These cards make data for
players and game masters alike easy to reference and use.

Charts. The focus of T5 is the chart pages which detail how to do things
succinctly and clearly. The rules text then gives examples and discussion of
this material.

More Aliens in the General Population. As opposed to everyone being human.

Tasks integrated into everything. Rather than just tacked on.

More detached duty. As a result, naval characters can have ships and be part
of the adventuring. So can scouts. And Scholars. 

Expanded system for wounds and fighting. Which allows for non-combat injury
(accidents, cold, heat, vacuum, and such. This in turn opens the opportunity
for weapons and devices which can impose damage other than just hits (so nukes
can impose burns and radiation as well as blast). High tech weapons can do the
same.

and said I\'d try to find the debate on the TML and would email it to
them.

The debate we had was a me-versus-them thing: they all think that the
winner of an opposed task should be the one with the highest roll, as
long as that roll is still a success.

Does anyone remember what the rationale behind the lowest-roll-wins side
was?

an interesting situation which I\'d like your comments on.

Let\'s say that I\'m shooting someone at very short range. My "to hit"
task is Average (2D). Now, let\'s say that my opponent is wearing battle
dress, and I have a handgun. There\'s just no way I\'m penetrating that
kind of armor.

So, in a flash of brilliance, I run away. I run to, oh, say medium
range. I start shooting at him from this range. My task difficulty is
now formidable (3D). Can I hit him? Nope, unless I get spectacular
success.

Because I can\'t get spectacular success at less than medium range, I\'m
into the absurd situation where my pistol can only penetrate battle
dress when I\'m at least 46 meters away! If I\'m closer, then I can\'t hit
him.

Am I getting the rules wrong? I don\'t actually have T4 (not having seen
it available here in Calgary), so the only things I know about T4 are
what Marc has graciously emailed me and what I\'ve gotten from this list.

Cool.  I know that you will get alot of criticism over the next couple

really want to see Traveller make a profit for who ever publishes it. 
I bought everything IG put out, just because I\'m a diehard, but the
rest of the world needs some flash and dash to get their attention.

Speaking of which -  I\'ve only had 16 orders during a four month period,
and considering that there are less than five weeks left in which to order,
it\'s starting to look highly unlikely that I will reach the break-even
point (70-80 orders). If this turns out to be the case I will not be
releasing the five Keith supplements as \'freeware\' for inclusion on Bryan
Borich\'s Classic Traveller CD (due out in late \'99 or thereabouts) as I had
originally intended. 

Although I have long felt that Traveller (and RPG\'s in general) have became
a niche market with limited interest, even I am suprised and disappointed
at this low turn-out. I now understand why Andrew and Bill have both told
me they are no longer interested in writing any new material for the
Traveller universe (or any other RPG) for the very reasons mentioned above.

In any event, I want to thank those who have ordered and let you know that
things are still on-track for the end-of-December release.

But in Traveller, 200 radii is exactly where you want the space station to be.

The silverish inside wall of a big bubble in mercury-like environment

As J-Space follows other physical laws than N-Space, the Jump drives are
needed to maintain the Bubble of N-Space around the ship. Changing Course

Good SF explanation, it pleases me as a scientist, too. I\'ll take this for
an explanation of time consuming in Jump-Space.

I add a wavemechanics-like version for differences between the j-1
to j-6 routes. each of the found ones resembles an own jumpspace, which,
like the vibrations of a wire applied at two points, can overlay and
combine to standing waves.

For the fans of quantum mechanics: if you describe jumpspace in terms of
wavefunctions, J-Space 1 belongs to the first eigenvalue, and J-Space 6
belongs to the sixth.

The small differences in place and time oberved when exiting Jumpspace
are explained by Heisenberg\'s uncertainty principle applied here.

Some jump physicians IMTU still discuss over these versions, and if there
are higher \'eigenvalues\' of J-Space than 6.

Now, before this really gets weird, I\'ll close.

I went back and looked at the latest version of the errata for GURPS
Traveller, dated 1998 November 05. I compared this to an earlier version I
had from October 3rd and noticed something interesting;

As we all know, the information for converting attributes was left out.
According to the october 3rd errata I have, this was a table (even though
it is referred to as a formula) which had GURPS stats being in the 5-15
range as compared to Traveller. This has now been altered to the formula
"GURPS Stat = Traveller Stat +3, adjusted at the GM\'s discretion". This
means that GURPS stats for converted Traveller characters now range from 4
to 18. I like this change, BUT...TNE characters were mostly based on 2d6-1
rather than 3d6. Therefore, shouldn\'t the formula for TNE characters be TNE
stat +4 (except for Soc)? Otherwise, converted TNE characters will come out
universally one less than their CT/TNE/T4 counterparts.

This isn\'t a major deal for me, as when I start my GURPS TNE game, we\'ll be
rebuilding the characters to concept rather than straight converting
anyway, but I thought I would point it out.

Purely personal preference, but:

I never liked the cards as included in T:2000 or T4\'s Emperor\'s Vehicles. 
I found them terribly difficult to use for reference, my players wouldn\'t
touch them, and they take up a tremendous amount of page space that could
be better used elsewhere.  I would sincerely prefer one well-designed blank
card form (per type) and matching charts and tables, i.e., put the
information in the same order on both to facilitate transferring.  The TAS
Forms from CT not only presented the information they contained in a useful
fashion, but also provided some nifty props ("Hand over your Ship\'s Papers,
Captain!").

Respectfully,

Chris

the usefulnes of LOM compared to most stuff that was put out for T4 I\'d say
its the best that happened to Traveller since way back...

There are five Andrew Keith supplements (and an extra \'freebie\' booklet for
each). They are $20 each or the set for $100 (The set comes with an
additional \'freebie\' - Imperial Calendar by Bill Keith). The supplements are:

1) Faldor - World of Adventure
2) Letter of Marque - Rogues in Space I
3) Scam - Rogues in Space II
4) Starport Planetfall
5) Arctic Environment

Surface postage is included in the price - however, if you want your order
sent first-class, please include an additional $5. I need to receive all
orders (i.e. payment) by Dec. 15th as that is when the actual printing
starts. Please send your orders to:

Depending on the round, there may be no visable difference between entrance
and exit wound.  A NATO 7.62mm round will tend to punch staright through
tissue, leaving a clean wound at both ends (unless it hits something hard,
like bone).  A 5.56mm round will tumble, leaving a large, jagged wound
cavity and exit point.  Infection is a factor of the local environment, how
quickly aid is recieved, and what part of the body is hit (Damage to the GI
tract is almost guarnteed to cause a massive infection as all the faun
scream "we\'re free" and run wild.)  Since the number of holes in the body
isn\'t a big problem compared with the damage to internal organs and
structures, the presence or absence of exit wounds shouldn\'t affect the raw
amount of damage.

I always try to do these things on the fly..  If an attack does a great
deal of damage, I might declare that the character has a shattered femur or
somesuch.

Gauss weapons are just very advanced slugh throwers.  In ACQ (which is
almost finished, I swear!!) all Gauss weapons are armor-piercing, so the
wound channels will be fairly neat and clean, althought the light needles
will tend to tumble.

High Energy Weapons are very nasty.  A big problem is that they are going
to flash heat your bodily fluids to steam.  I really don\'t see how an
unarmored man could survive a HEW hit anywhere but the extermeities.

Shot himself.

(Sick aside: I was at a convention attending a panel on "Superheroes in the

gunshot.  someone in the auidence quipped "are you sure he didn\'t just

Nice!  this goes into my "cool background stuff" file.

In other odd music news, Todd Rundgren has started experimenting with
hooking a MIDI up to an EEG.  He\'s working on a collection of music of the
mind by setting different brain waves to different insturments, and using
the subject\'s pulse for a beat.

Using the M:0 setting again might turn off people who were (to be honest)
burned by T4.  The idea that they are going to have to buy yhte same
setting all over again might drive away some potential sales.  How about
the time just after the Julain War, with the newly resurgent League of
Antares holding it\'s own against the humbled (and angry) Imperium.  Lots of
potential there.

I assume that packs of these cards, both blank and with established data
are part of the plan?  I hate destroying the binding on my books to
photocopy something.

Something that is needed, both for the players and as a check on design
creep.  If it takes more than five or six steps, it\'s probably too complex.

Um...the practical upper limit for railgun velocity is maybe 10
kilometers per
second.  At this rate, your shots will take more than a turn to cross
a single
brilliant lances hex, and have essentially zero chance to hit any
enemy vehicle
at any significant range.  As such, the net effect is \'wow, you
wasted weight
and volume on a totally useless weapons system\'.

It may be a not-very-useful weapon for space combat, but as a turret
level weapon for defence against boarders or in ground actions it
might be quite useful.  On the other hand, a VRF Gauss gun spitting
out several thousand projectiles into the probable path of an enemy
ship could either make the other ship change couse or take some
surface damage assuming a minimal level of armor (degrading sensors or
Jump grids perhaps).

This sounds very cool. Please please pleeaasse get a publisher which knows

So the atlas will be only good for Antares in M:0, or will it be good for

Very nice. I _especially_ like these last two. I assume the cards are in
spirit similar to the DGP equipment sheets that were once available for MT.
Or are these more on the order of full-color playing cards (Traveller: The
Jumping???)?

If the typesetting and layout is nice, I could see purchasing this product
(unlike the IG products, which I did not). Even with the <ricken frackin>

I like this idea that the 7 day jump might have longer cousins.  I
ran some simple calculations on this idea and came up with the
following (based on 7^n days):
7 days
49 days
343 days (22 days short of a year)
2401 days (6 yrs and 211 days)
16807 days (46 yrs and 17 days)
117649 days (322 yrs and 119 days)
You would want a good supply of anagathics to try the 322 yr
version.

Has this not been changed for T5? I thought that, in the drafts Marc\'s been

If you wanted to make this somewhat useful, you could reduce the amount
of power and/or jump fuel required to enter a "longer" trajectory, thus
making this capability more attractive to small ships under certain
circumstances.

No pay = no contract = no transfer of copyright = author owns the copyright.

Remember that _any_ payment will probably justify the payment requirement
of the contract, so even if they gave 10 cents on the dollar, there was some
effective transfer.  While you might still have the copyright, a court case
would
be messy, long, and expensive.  (However, since IG isn\'t really a going
concern
any more, I would try to work out an arrangement

If you were _never_ paid _anything_, you probably have a good case to
sue IG for copyright infringement.  If such a suit were successful, I would
bet that you could either get (1) some portion of the contract fee; or
much more likely, (2) a declaratory judgment that you own the copyright
and are free to sell/publish/distribute the work as you feel.  In fact, thats
what I would probably do: seek a declaratory judgment that you own
the copyright still because there was no effective transfer.

Caveats:
- - If the contract says "Work for hire" in it, all bets are off.
- - I am not yet a lawyer, and considering how long they have taken to
    _not_ send me my results, I\'m getting the feeling that I\'m taking the
    test again in February (damn Massachusetts Probate law!).
- - Litigation is expensive.

Remember: Copyright only protects the particular expression of an
idea, not the idea or concept itself.  IMO, your easiest course is to
rewrite such things.  It might mean a lot of work, since you need to
rephrase the whole thing, but at least you\'ve already developed the
ideas and know what you want to say.  Just change the way you
express those ideas.  And change all proper nouns original to the
work, i.e., if you made up a name that didn\'t come from previous
Traveller stuff.

Doing that, and getting a license from Mr. Miller to publish such
things, should make everything hunky dory.

On the underestimating front, look at the raid the RAFs Vulcan bombers made
on Port Stanley in the Falklands back in the early 80\'s. It may not have
had a major (logistical impact) but staging a strike from the UK using
tanker support! GDW\'s South Atlantic War supplement for Harpoon made me
realise just how much effort that took.

Yes, average pistol does 3D damage.

Skim reading T4\'s combat section I can\'t see anything on the spectacular
success affecting combat. However, a TL 10 BD has an armour value of 7R
(Rigid) which means you throw away 7D of damage, and then apply a maximum
of 3 remaining D against the victim. So a pistol, even with a double value
hit (assuming that\'s what a spectacular success does) would not penetrate.
A snub pistol might get a little through with the HEAP rounds (like the
cP003 with 5D).

Personally, I treat 3 ones whether on 2D and a 1/2 dice or 3D as spectacular..

You seem to be confusing to hit and penetration.

You roll to hit - which is a function of range, not armour.

Then you roll damage which takes armour and size into account.

I don\'t see a problem - if you rolled two 1\'s with a 2D difficulty attack
you should still hit, unless the  characteristic + skill is really bad (ie
1!). You\'re just unlikely to penetrate combat/battle armour/dress, even
with an SS.

1 question. One of the MTJs explained that gauss weapons would be silent
(no sonic crack) but GT says they make a sonic crack. Wheich one is correct
(ISTR that Joe Fugate had talked to someone involved in designing that kind
of technology for the MTJ comment).

The DGP cards/sheets were too big. These are intended to be manageable and

Fopr the most part, they don\'t have illos, and so no color.

I agree.  I think the main rule book in Traveller should be non-milieu specific.
It should sample a variety of time periods and have a variety of TL\'s  in it.

I evision this:  (Harkening back to the days of old CT) The core rule books (core
rules, FF&S, starship combat boxed set, etc) could all be done in black covers.

With M0, all of those covers are done in, let\'s say, red.  With M100, those are
all done in purple--etc.

OR...

If you\'re looking for a look akin to T4, you do all of the covers in black, but
change the piping/border color.  Remember, with T4, this was red.  Well, with T5,
the core rules are black covers with red trim.  The MO books are black covers
with orange trim.  The M1100 books are black covers with gold trim.

I like the color coding technique.  It reminds me of CT, and anybody can follow a
specific milieu through the colors.  If you didn\'t want to follow M0, then don\'t
buy the orange books.

I never used any card out of any Traveller game--not even the ones in the old
CT line.  As a matter of fact, Star Wars does this, and in my current game, I
don\'t use those cards either.

They don\'t bother me, but I don\'t find them useful either.

This sounds great!  I hate the trend of some new RPGs to flood you with
supplements as soon as possible.  A tight and coherent set of core rules
with enough information to allow referees to develop their own settings
both canonical and otherwise would be welcome.

Aliens are always welcome, but what about more variations on humaniti?
Especially for non-standard worlds. It seems to me that some stuff might
creep into or out of the DNA to create superficial changes.  I\'m thinking
of things like skin-color, hair, vision, breathing, hearing, etc.  Probably not
for the \'recently\' settled worlds, in terms of evolutionary time, but for the
other seeded worlds.

I think its the mention in M0 about Syleans having a much greater frequency
of Albinism and greater than average height that set me thinking in this
direction.
That and those Mexican boys that are totally covered in a thick coating of hair.

1 question. One of the MTJs explained that gauss weapons would be silent 
(no sonic crack) but GT says they make a sonic crack. Wheich one is correct 
(ISTR that Joe Fugate had talked to someone involved in designing that kind 
of technology for the MTJ comment).

GT is correct.  If it\'s supersonic, it makes a sonic crack.  If it\'s subsonic,
it might well be fairly quiet, but wouldn\'t have very impressive performance. 
However, needles might be quieter than standard bullets, since they have less
air resistance (this may be made up for by being faster, however).  What it
sounds like depends somewhat -- I suspect that a VRF gauss gun firing full auto
would make a low droning sound (frequency equal to its rate of fire), with a
distinct doppler shift if the stream of bullets is sweeping a position.

You do, however have to remember that you\'re fighting one of the strongest

spend an hour at the bank to get one of those (#/)"(#% international checks

Meson Guns under FF&S1 are really (aside from power) quite potent... armor

(All other beams simply require you put the beam through the target...
mesons require the burst IN the target).

Joe said something to that effect in one of the MTJ\'s. It is POSSIBLE to
stealth a bullet to get no sharp crack, if you can get it fast enough.... I
read several articles on this when I had a gun-nut roomate. Above mach 2,
the whole issue of sonic booms changes nature for small objects.

True. So let\'s say that the person isn\'t wearing battle dress, he\'s wearing
something that as a rating of 4R. So my Average task can\'t hit him, but by
stepping away to 46 meters I can, if I get spectacular success. This situation
strikes me as odd.

Your homegrown rule solves the problem for Difficult tasks. However, the problem
is still there for Easy tasks.

> You seem to be confusing to hit and penetration.

Possibly. Perhaps my error lies in assuming that, if you roll spectacular
success, you automatically hit and do damage.

So, this gives rise to another question. How do you handle spectacular success
in this kind of situation? I shoot a target at medium range, even though my gun
can\'t penetrate the armor. I roll spectacular success. So what?

I would recommend that T5 maps include names, physical stats, and
presence/absence of gas giants and belts.  Data listings should
include all of the other information, which is potentially quite
mutable from era to era, or even within an era if the area/planet
is politically unstable.

A sample hex might look like this (magnified):

   _____
  / 867 \\
 /   O  G\\
 \\      B/
  \\Terra/
   ~~~~~


867    - the physical stats - Size, Atmo, Hydro
O      - the circle that represents the world itself, or the
         dotcluster if it\'s a belt
G      - if there are gas giants present in the system
B      - if there are planetoid belts (other than a mainworld
         belt) present in the system
Terra  - the name of the world

The data listing would match the current format (as established
in MT), with the possible exception of an expansion of the Base
field to accommodate multiple codes, so that one would not need
to use up codes on "combinations" of bases.  Three characters
should be sufficient (Naval, Scout, XBoat).  Bases should be
assumed to be appropriate for alignment, rather than needing
separate codes for each polity, so that a Zhodani Naval base
would be indicated by "N" on a Zhodani world, and an Imperial
Naval base would be indicated by "N" on an Imperial world.
Suggested codes:

N - Naval Base
S - Scout Base
D - Naval Depot
W - Scout Way Station
X - XBoat
M - Non-Naval Military Base
F - Fuel Dump/Deep Space Fueling Station

If there are any others (or any special cases) that need to be
addressed, expand as needed, obviously.

A _really_ nice touch would be to have the alignments/polity
boundaries and main communications routes on transparent plastic
overlays sized to match the map, but this _could_ run into bucks.

Sounds like Traveller!  Destined to be a Classic, no doubt.  I have to

I second this motion.  I have tons of CT M:1105 stuff that I WILL be
playing in this new system.  I want the core books not to get in the
way of this.  By the same token, I have non-canon stuff and M:0
scenarios as well.  I want to use the same character, task and
equipment rules for all, if possible, but not have to answer the
"canon" questions if I don\'t choose to.  Much easier if the core rules
contain the least number of historical / milieu information.

Best idea yet.  Licensees could follow the color code conventions,
too, making it easier to determine what goes with what.  I\'d suggest
lining up T5 licensees now to debut adventures at T5\'s launch.  The
republishing of CT product, too.  Would spread the marketing across
several companies, rather like software companies launching new
versions at the same time a new operating system comes out.  I\'m not
suggesting that we change the name to "Microsoft Miller\'s Traveller",
but successful marketing is as successful marketing does.

I did something like this with CT stats for weapons, equipment and
vehicles *way* back, must have been 78-79.  I used unruled 3x5"
index cards for the weapons, most equipment, and small vehicles.
For major vehicles and locations, ie ships and buildings, I had
letter sized sheets of paper, not cards.  I remember spending hours
typing them up on an old manual typewriter.  ;->

If the PC had a weapon (or piece of equipment), he had a *specific*
card for that *specific* weapon and as he used it he refered to that
card.  On one side was the name of the weapon (and on some an
illo..I\'m no artist, so I let the players "customize" the card for
*their* weapon with an illo if they wanted ;), and on the other was
all the details of that weapon\'s use and current condition.

We used them a *lot* in the games I ran back then.  I\'d hand out
cards to the players for each weapon and piece of equipment their
character had, if they didn\'t have the card, they didn\'t have it and
couldn\'t use it.  If the character had that equipment/weapon, but
didn\'t have it in hand, it was placed face down (just the name
showing) in front of the player, if he had it in hand, it was face
up (details showing). If he dropped the weapon he gave the card to
the GM.  If he gave it to someone else they put the card in front of
them.  If it was stored away in some vehicle or location it was
(supposed to be, but I never really worked this part out to my
satisfaction) with the sheet for that vehicle or location.  The
vehicles were generally group used, so whatever vehicle they were
using was placed on the table and the others were kept in my
notebook, same for buildings.

The details on the cards included range, characteristic, and other
DM\'s, damage values, ammo (where appropriate), and any custom
details about that weapon/equipment.  For guns there were
ammo/charge boxes the player marked off as the gun was loaded, and
erased as he fired.

I remember this worked pretty well, as long as the cards held up.

Laminating didn\'t work too well, so the cards got dog-eared,
badly eraser marked on the ammo tracks, greasy from fingers, and
then there was the great soda spill of \'80.  ;-> Replacing them in
those days was a manually-royal pain, too, so I didn\'t have many and
quickly ran out of cards for the popular weapons.

I\'ve still got what\'s left of them in a baggie buried in my "Big
Chest\'O Games."  Now that I\'ve got computers, scanners, and printers
I should get them back out, revise and reprint them for whatever
system I\'m currently using. Dang they *were* a good idea!

IAC...my opinion on cards...good idea, can be a great one if done
well.  I *would* make the weapon/equipment, character, and vehicle
cards different sizes.  Different sizes will make it easier to
collect and sort them by function.  I\'d also make them big enough to
be easily read and marked on during use.  I remember having lots of
blank cards that I could scribble on during play too, for equipment
that I hadn\'t already planned out, so bank forms are a good idea
too.  These cards will be consumables, so replaceing them should be
easy and inexpensive.

 So does this mean you will no longer insist on censoring
"sexually-flavored content" from the game? What I really hated about this
comment was the implicit statement, that violence is acceptable if you
really really have to, but sex is something people just don\'t do. (Refers
to T4 rulesbook p.5 goal #5)

 Sounds good basically. Could we just please have the core rules in boxed
format (even if just as a special edition), with the subject arrangement
maybe conforming to CT. Big books (such as TNE) are hard to handle around
gaming table and break easily.

 Antares sector sounds like an interesting place, just place it a bit
further along in the Imperial history, and don\'t call it Milieu:0. I agree
with the many comments stating that this could deter potential customers.
 Also please do include a map and uwp/library data of the chosen sector in
the core rules set. Both TNE and T4 made the mistake of not doing this. It
makes getting started enormously more difficult.

 Now why does this sound like an old Infocom text adventure to me?

 A workable idea, as long as the card sheets are not attatched to the 
books. Nobody likes savaging the nice new book they just paid top dollar
for.

 I support this. I suggest paying more attention to human minor races. I

 If this means leaning more towards the MT task system I like it. Just
give it some more resolution. (And skip the half-die.)

 If you really want to discourage unnecessary violence, I suggest making
the combat system as gruesomely realistic as possible. (You take a .357
hit to unarmored chest, you\'re wormfood.) At least in our games this has
done wonders to making PC:s think twice about hauling out a piece.

Hmmm. I think you are assuming that since there are reportedly crew who
have survived a misjump that life support must be able to be -stretched- to
accommodate them for longer periods in an emergency. Not necessarily so.
The figures also work the other way. Less crew members equals more weeks of
life support for the remainer.

Have you read "The Cold Equations," by Tom Godwin, published in 1954? It\'s
a classic story, somewhat chilling, about a stowaway on a spacecraft that
has a limited fuel & air supply. The unalterable laws of physics determine
that there are resources for only one person to survive.

*ObTrav* Maybe not - all - of your crew can last the six weeks from a
misjump. Your crew will have to make some hard choices if any of them are
to survive (short straws anyone?). Toughest bit will be that they don\'t
know just HOW LONG the misjump will last so it might be six weeks or it
might be less. They wouldn\'t want to do something *drastic* just before
they unexpectedly pop out of jumpspace and into the hands of waiting
rescuers, would they?

Erwin, I think your assumption is incorrect, RW, but is probably
pretty close in the game rules.  I think the spectacular success
(SS) / spectacular failure (SF) procedure has some problems.

First, let me put in a plug for SS being whenever you make a roll by
more than some number and SF being whenever you fail a roll by more
than some number.  Six sounds like a good number to me...make your
roll by 6 or more and it\'s spectacular. 

Example:  Joe has a target number of 9, he has to undertake a
task that is... 

 Easy       (1d)   -- 1-3 SS; 4-6 success
 Average    (2d)   -- 2,3 SS; 4-9 success; 10-12 failure
 Difficult  (2.5d) -- 3 SS; 4-9 success; 10-14 failure; 15 SF
 Formidable (3d)   -- 3 SS; 4-9 success; 10-14 failure; 15-18 SF
 Staggering (4d)   -- 4-9 success; 10-14 failure; 15-24 SF
 Hopeless   (5d)   -- 5-9 success; 10-14 failure; 15-30 SF

...or something like that.

<all comments are based on Traveller, 4th edition [T4] and Fire, Fusion

Which design sequence do you use?  FF&S2 has specific items for both
food storage (volume based on quality of food, and number of weeks
provided) and galley space (Ordinary for Meager through Good rations,
Full for Good or Excellent rations).  Excellent rations require that the
head chef (at least) have skill of either Steward-4 or Cook-3 to gain
the full benefit of Excellent rations.  (I realize that T4 doesn\'t
include a Cook skill in the basic character generation.  However, FF&S2
[pg. 80] refers to Cook skill, so you may want to add it to your
campaign.  Alternately, simply assume that Cook skill equals Steward
minus 1.)

Otherwise (QSDS/SSDS), assume that food preparation (and dining area) is
a part of the applicable sized stateroom.  Thus, small stateroom space
allows for Meager through Good rations, and large staterooms allow for
Good and Excellent rations (assuming the appropriate Steward/Cook on
board).  Under QSDS/SSDS, figure that, in accordance with Table 211
(FF&S2), life support includes 2 weeks of Normal/Good rations, plus one
week of Emergency rations ("just in case").

Assume that a portion of the space in a stateroom is dedicated to
laundry-type services (washing, dry-cleaning, or [possibly in TL16+
settings] clothing replication).

 Most ready deckplans come with a crew/passenger lounge marked (When
making your own this comes off the volume allocated for staterooms.)
A typical lounge would include a mini-galley. (Doesn\'t really take more
than 1 x 1.5m floor space.) Most typical food would be deep-frozen /  
de-hydrated rations in varying proportions. (Might depend on the propotion
of large/small staterooms, says the much more experienced Traveller GM
behind my back.) (and points out a typo  -da GM) The volume for food
storage would come out of life support volume.
 The real problem in our campaign (the one i\'m _playing_ in) is not what
people eat, but what they drink. I can remember more than one jump that
turned into a 7 day drinking binge.

 You mean apart from skintight vacc suits on the busty babes? At least my
character tends to wear jeans shorts and a T-shirt. (With EPG laser pistol
holster and a fractal fighting knife, it\'s fun being a paranoid.)
 Seriously, most starships would have a stewards shop with washing/drying
machines. The volume for this could come out of life support and/or
stateroom volume.

I *always* include a galley and eating area.  The characters hang
out with each other a lot around the galley table or in some other
common\'s area.  Cabins are *tiny* with most of the space allocated
to common areas, like the galley, workout room, lounge, and so on.
OTOH, some people make the cabins larger and have the characters
stay in them, isolated from each other, most of the time.

And where are the restrooms?  Do they keep a slop jar under their

On some deckplans (especially of larger ships) there is a
specifically labelled galley for food preparation.  On smaller ships
it would probably be built into a wall in common areas (almost every
ship has at least one of these).  I would assume washing-machines
would be either part of the freshers (aprox 1 per large stateroom), or
another wall mounted unit in a common area.
This is an interesting line of thought though.  I might have some

Sure, we can handwave effective "sonic cleaners" that vibrate
the...um nasty stuff...out of your clothes.  Go to your cabin, take
of dirty clothes, toss them into the "saniter" built into the wall,
turn it on and go to bed.  Next morning open the bottom drawer of
the saniter and pull out clean, fresh smelling and unwrinkled
clothes ready to wear. 

Hey!  Maybe *that\'s* where all the nanotech research ended up,
cleaning services!  ;->

FWIW, I wrote Vilani Hypothesis.  It IS a finished manuscript, 
complete with maps.

Here\'s where it gets strange...

It was the last project I worked on for IG.  At the time I agreed to 
take on the work, I had not been paid for the last several projects, 
and IG was into my pockets personally for about $3000 worth of 
work.  Well realizing that if IG didn\'t sell more product I would 
probably never see dime one of what they were in arrears to me, I 
agreed to take the project on with the understanding that the 
property was to remain unpublished (and mine) until I was paid in 
full.  Needless to say, I\'ve never seen the first dime, and therefore 
VH remains unpublished.

I submitted the manuscript in mid-January.  Two weeks to the day 
afterwards, IG let the license lapse (or Marc pulled it, I don\'t know 
which, and in hindsight, it really doesn\'t matter).  So I still have the 
only existing manuscript, and I honestly haven\'t decided what to do 
with it at this point.

One of the things I groused at upon being assigned the project was 
being squeezed into the 64 page format used in Annillilik Run 
(sp?), and the awkwardly cut in half TLWH/Gateway.  I had 
envisioned Vilani Hypothesis as a 108 page adventure, and indeed, 
had the outline mapped out for a 108 page work. I actually had to 
remove a lot of material I\'d planned to squeeze it to 64 pages.  

Obviously, I have no permission to publish or release it in any form 
without the permission of Marc Miller.  For the moment in the hope 
that it might have a chance to see the light of day when T5 is 
published, I will hang on to it.  As for the future...who 
knows...except Grandfather, anyways.

Since you inquired though (and in hopes that it will cause a hue 
and cry to Marc with a desire to have it published), here\'s a little 
teaser of VH:

Vilani Hypothesis was written as a connected series of adventures 
that would form a single campaign set in Vland Sector, 
approximately year 20 IE.  The Vland of Milieu 0 as written is a far 
different animal than the Ziru Sirka of the Interstellar Wars, nor was 
it the powerful Vland Sector/Restored Vilani Empire of CT/MT.  The 
Vilani Cluster is a loose grouping of 1 to 2 dozen worlds tenuously 
connnected with the Imperium through a single system wide 
corridor to Core Sector known as the Vilani Corridor.  Vland has 
powerful neighbors, chief of which is the fanatical Union of Heaven, 
a pocket empire with technology equal to that of the Vilani, rather 
xenophobic, and fanatic in its belief that its supreme ruler is the 
embodiment of the "Supreme Being."  The Imperial presence is 
relatively weak, and the Union is itching to avenge a defeat against 
a combined Vilani-Sylean fleet less than a generation before.

In any case, the adventure is wrapped around an effort by a 
patriotic Vilani anthropologist in the employ of the AAB to prove the 
Vland is the original homeworld of mankind.  The players can take 
part in the adventure as part of the security team, as the 
diplomats/bureaucrats who must frequently negotiate the right to 
dig up burial grounds and other treasures with petty world and 
pocket empire rulers, or they can be members of the scientific 
team.  The adventures include dealing with hostile natives, strange 
native superstitions, a fanatical Vilani supremacist group that was 
supposed to have disappeared during the Long Night, but may not 
be as dead as everybody thinks, and the party must also deal with 
the fact that ultimately, the evidence supporting the Hypothesis is 
far from overwhelming.  Needless to say, the climax of the 
adventure happens on a world well within the borders of the dread 
enemy of the young Third Imperium, the Union of Heaven.

The game contained two very detailed sectors of Vland, circa 
Milieu 0, several pages of library data, over 50 detailed NPCs, 
numerous world maps, and other goodies, including a detailed 
adventure generator to inspire the referee to create further 
scenarios in a similar vein for the players.

I guess it depends on what you call the diamter of the galactic
center :-) I guess a better idea is to look at the gravitaional
gradient at ~100d for various masses, then figure out what the same
would be for the galaxy as a whole. Interesting, very interesting.

It would be nice if the limit were just coreward of the canonical
traveller universe :-)

I see a problem with this progression:  taking a maximum-range shot with
one\'s chosen weapon gives one a _very_ good chance of something _deeply_
unpleasant happening.  Why should my FGMP-15 have a greater chance of
blowing up in my face ("spectacular failure") just because my target was
farther away?  RL: my M16A2 will fire (or not), regardless of the range
of the target.

A possible solution to this problem would be to borrow from the Iron
Crown Enterprises starfighter combat game _Silent Death_.  In _Silent
Death_, when one rolls to hit, one rolls two dice of the same type (D6
or D8, generally), plus a die based on the Gunnery skill of the
crewmember firing the weapon (D4 through D10).  On a max of the weapon
dice (12 on 2d6, 16 on 2d8), the firer automatically hits.  On "snake
eyes" for the two weapon dice, the firer automatically misses.  The
"auto-hit" and "auto-miss" occur regardless of the total to-hit roll.

By using three different colors of six-sided dice, one can achieve a
similar effect in Traveller.  Roll dice, based on the difficulty of the
task.  Roll one color of dice for each pip the character has on a given
skill, and add different-colored dice for dice required beyond the
number of points a character has in a skill.  Spectacular Success (SS)
is achieved when the skill-based dice have at least 2 ones.  Spectacular
Failure (SF) occurs when the non-skill-based dice have at least 2
sixes.  SS & SF cancel each other out if both occur.  Half dice count
for neither SS nor SF.

Thus, a highly-skilled individual, with average aptitude, will rarely
suffer SF, and will sometimes enjoy SS.  Any individual will have more
SF chances, regardless of aptitude, if he/she/it exceeds his/her/its
training.  Making the total skill roll, but suffering from SF, will lead
to a problem further down the road (if applicable [i.e., if the referee
can find a plausible repercussion]).

Considering we\'re no longer in the earlies of RPGing, not by a long shot,
is this sort of section really necessary?  Especially if it frames
"adventuring" in such a processed, dumbed-down way?

Can you say Sayat?

Seriously, though, I think this could be a great idea, but a big increase
in numbers of new alien species might result in more "furry suits with
one or more exaggerated human characteristics".  So far, Traveller has
been able to boast _relatively_ non-zippered aliens; I\'d hate to see this
be lost due to the desire to make it more superficially "colorful".

Took the question right out of my mouth.  And what do they look like?  Are
they all still variations on porcelain flush basins, or can the gearheads

Likewise, what about bathing?  What sorts of shower gadgetry will TL A+

I *knew* it! In AD&D the convention was always the _pub_ (usually with a

I also note that G:T actually includes a picture of a pub with a mob of
aliens ordering, well, probably a schooner or pot of something alien
("It\'s... green!" - obscure ST:TNG reference).

I\'ll have to add to the multi-lingual thread that has been going (ie "what

Firstly, what TL ?

Secondly, what the heck are you using 90 MW of power for in a 100 dton, 2G,
Jump-2 ship with a 2 hour battery pack ?

You need 50.4 MW to get or stay in jump space.

Now, using t-plates, 70 MW powers 28 000 kN, so we\'re OK there too. Rip the
contragrav if you pull 2 gees with t-plates too ... when are you going to
*use* it ?

We still have 180 MW/hours worth of boost power from the battery pack, so
if we bleed this in at 20 MW per hour, we can install a 60 MW power plant
that should cut the sticker cost by around MCr 3.

Me, I would reduce the t-plates to 1 G, and install a combat-boost Heplar
plant with 14 000 kN of thrust for, say, 4 hours. This cuts the normal
power use down to 35 MW, but puts combat power up by 35 MW. 14 000 kN of
T-plates costs MCr 8.75, while 14 000 kN of Heplar costs MCr 0.07. 

Using the afterburners for one hour will need 17.5 m3 of H-fuel - note that
this could act as a partial fuel reserve for an additional jump in a
redesigned ship. Switching one gee of thrust from T-plates to Heplar saved
you 28 m3. Add the 10 m3 we saved from the smaller fusion plant, and we
need to find a mere 32 m3 of additional space for tankage for 4 hours of
H-fuel.

Combined, the smaller fusion plant and the combination m-drive should save
about MCr 11 on the sticker cost of the Scout, with very little loss of
operational efficiency.

Doing this should take the cost of the unit down to around MCr 25 or so.

Obviously, I\'m gold-plating my ships.  I came up with a 97.62 MCr ship
that met the basic requirements.  However, I added the following:

	Stealth (1 level)
	1 light laser mount
	1 sandcaster (the Akins FF&S spreadsheet ver 3.2 doesn\'t allow, AFAIK,
for multiple batteries in the same turret)
	1 Radio Jammer (1000 AU)
	1 Deception Jammer (rating 11)
	1 Passive Jammer (rating 13)
	Neutrino and Basic IR Masking
	11.5 AEMS (IAW the DSR) vice 8 AEMS
	3 x Fiber-optic computers
	1 112 MW power plant vice 90 MW (to power the laser mount)
	No batteries
	6 Td cargo hold vice 4 Td cargo hold
	Armor USP rating 10

At least it _performs_ like a canonical Type-S (J-2, 2-G, fuel refining
ability)....

T4 classifies 100 planetary diameters as safe.  The misjump calculation
is "roll 2- for a misjump, DMs:+1 for Unrefined Fuel, +5 for less than
100D (I think they mean DM-1/-5 respectively, since it should be more
likely to misjump)  If I am right this means a 7- chance of a misjump if
jumping between 10D & 100D (it also says <10D destroys the ship).  I
don\'t like them odds.

The various sections in T4/FF&S2 also imply that the Jump Bubble is
formed in front of the ship even if it is moving, and that you are not
trying to "thread the needle" as I think Keven implied earlier.  They
also imply that the average time taken to prepare for a jump is one hour
(it cannot be more than 1 hour).  It would be very difficult to generate
sufficient power to jump in less time - so far in all my designs this
has been the most power hungry component.  You need a total of 64MJ per
cubic meter per parsec jumped.  This equates to .018MW of power plant
output per cubic meter per jump number (which must be maintained
throughout the Jump so the power must be over and above that needed to
maintain Life Support/Armour, etc. but not weapons, commo, sensors, ecm
or any other power hungry item that cannot work in jump space).
againg quoting:
"        2)  A starship can make a safe jump at 100-D, with no effect on
the
possiblilty of misjump (except for maintenance, etc.)"
As said above in T4 there is a 1 in 36 chance of a misjump even at 100D

"        3) NOWHERE in the rules does it say a ship MUST come out of
jump only at the
100-D limit!!! "

I\'m still lobbying here. I think a major Referee\'s Guide or Secrets of the

outlineing MAJOR story lines (and possibly one or more hidden agendas)
through out all of the history of the Imperium would be a GOOD addition.
This would be the bible that new writers need to keep the canonists off

Please gear star ship combat toward role playing. A companion game system

have role-playing star ship combat rules.

I realize the main world is the primary adventure site but please include

I really like this idea. However, as others have said, if possible have the

	This was the point of the original question (kind of a cheap trick question):
In my copy of FF&S2, T-plates produce 400kn of thrust/m3, and have a min
thrust of 4000kn!  This works out to a 4-G Scout...was this a typo?  I knew I
could do it w/ HEPLaR, but I didn\'t want to go that route.

	Also, I cannot seem to reconcile the SSDS in Starships w/ FF&S2...was there
an errata fixing this, or am I just living on a different world? :-)

The trouble is that the jump number is just an upper bound; it\'s canon
that a J-1 can be done \'in place\', and I\'d presume higher jumps as well,
should you decide to waste a lot of fuel.  Also, no real-world jump is
going to be an exact integer number of parsecs; that J-4 is probably
really J-3.784, but only integer jump numbers are possible, so you waste
the excess fuel.

Hm, interesting idea:  Suppose that two systems are, during a time of
Jump-N technology, N.01 parsecs apart.  This would mean that the two are
mutually accessible in one jump, but only with a *long* real-space run to
make up that .01 parsec.  This would make for an interesting \'feel\' for
travel between those systems (ships would accelerate out to jump, jump
without slowing down, then decelerate (modulo relative stellar motion) on
the far end).

Subject: What shall we have for dinner?

I\'m getting ready to start up a campaign, and I\'ve run into a little snag.
What do people eat while in jump?  How is it prepared?  I don\'t see a
kitchen
on any of my deckplans!

For that matter, what do we wear?  I also can\'t find a washing-machine.
Disposable clothing, perhaps?
  --S

     What do your players eat planet side?  Do you think that huge amount
of money you are charging them for life support is just for water and air?
I have always assumed that they eat the same items one can find on a
planet, or what can be found on which ever planet they purchased life
support from.
     There should be an area on your deck plans called a lounge or rec
area.  If not, just remember that there is a portion of every staterooms
volume that was intended for the lounge/central gathering place/dinning
room.  I would hazard a guess that laundry services would also be
accomplished in this area also.
     Feel free to use or discard these answers.

Interesting question.  The answer might depend on a couple of things:

(1) The 100D limit is most likely only a convenient rule of thumb for a
more complicated physical relationship.  I\'ll let one of the TMLers who has
researched this explanation do the appropriate analysis.  I suspect,
though, that both tidal forces and the acceleration of gravity from the
mass of the galaxy are too slight to qualify for a limit.

(2) The galaxy, while gravitationally bound (more or less) is not a
"physical object", in the sense that it is not compact.  All other objects
that are mentioned as having a 100D limit (planets, planetoids, stars,
black holes, starships depending on which version of Traveller) are either
held up against the force of gravity by their structure, or collapsed
matter.  This suggests that nebulae would not have a 100D limit, for
example, but gas giants would.

I\'ve made similar suggestions here on TML.
A Bible of Canon, a Universe Builder\'s Handbook, etc.
Not just a compilation of secrets (and many milieus will have secrets
separate to themselves), but information resources to deal with large
scale issues.  From linguistic drift over time for isolated systems, how
TL increases and decreases (with system specific modifiers).

I like it because you could move players (with or without their characters)
forward in time, and still have some minimally sufficient knowledge about
the state of the Imperium at that time.

This is something I really like. The previous Traveller editions 
(apart from the MT Boxed Set) all had the problem that they provided 
all rules and almost no background.
In todays roleplaying environment, the game needs to be instantly playable,
thus a background needs to be included.
So please do not only include the sector data, but also some information
on the background of the sector and the game. Just enough that gamers 
can see what the game is about and let them start right away.

Realistically, they\'ll only hit stationary (non-evading) targets at
relatively short ranges. (A mass driver round might take 30 minutes to T
travel a hex in BL - plenty of time for a target to get out of the way.) 
Only useful against targets that can\'t maneuver. Weber-esque mass-driver 
missile launchers are similarly irrelevant; they only buy a missile 
less than a hex per turn of extra speed. (They only matter for Weber
becaues of technobabble - "get clear of the wedge" - that he invented
so his ships couldn\'t fire all his missiles at once. Weber is exceptionally 
bad about thinking about technological interactions...)

Ah, we obviously have different ideas as to what spectacularly
failing to hit something means.  To me it means you missed your
target completely and perhaps hit something you didn\'t mean to hit.
It doesn\'t mean the weapon will blow up in your face.  So yes, your
"M16A2 will fire (or not) regardless of the range," but what it hits
may be unfortunate.

The Ferret class advanced scout is a BAMTech design concept study for a 
 replacement for the standard scout/courier, optimized for exploration -
 with an extremely advanced sensor suite, centered around a P1350S science
 array, capable of resolving human-sized targets at ranges of 100,000km or
 mapping the surface of a planet at the 1km level from 1 AU away.
 The ship also has a secondary military intelligence gathering roll, with
 a MidNite black hull coating and advanced IR masking; the same sensor
 suite allows it to detect powered-down military targets at a range of
 several million km.

Much of the cost of the ship is its sensor suite. Courier and military
 versions often delete the neutrino sensor and the science optimization on
 the main sensor array, reducing the cost by MCr 100 and freeing up an 
 additional 1 MW for weaponry.

The scout is also designed for long-endurance operations, with closed-
 cycle air and water recycling and 16 weeks of carried food supplies.

If the advanced scout is in common useage, Scout characters can obtain one
 in place of a regular type S (when awarded on mustering out) on a roll of
 10+, +1 for Pilot 3+. Such ships usually have the reduced sensor capability;
 roll 10+ again, +1 for Sensor 3+, to retain the full sensor suite.

I took the day off work to go downtown to the service at the cenotaph. A
repectable turnout, although there was a constant hum of traffic and
occasional outbursts of carhorns. When I was a kid I remember shops
closing down for the service(1), and people parking their cars during the
minute of silence. Times change...

ObTrav: The Imperium has fought a lot of fairly big wars. Would any of
them (ofther than the "Virus War" that killed the Imperium) have made
enough of an impression to result in a Rememberance Day-style holiday?



(1) I noticed that Mountain Equipment Coop didn\'t open unit noon, to give
their staff the chance to go to the service. Nice to see some employers
still remember...

Now this is an interesting opservation. However, to get around this, we
must assume (correctly) that the galaxy is mostly empty space, therefore we
can assume that the majority of the points of space that a starship can
travel are outside of 100d of the nearest object within the galaxy.

Some of the accomidation space should have included that. Staterooms should

Here in NZ virtually all trading is still banned on ANZAC day (our equivalent, just 
its 25th April) and unlike the handful of other days on which trading is banned 
(Easter and Christmas) nobody tries to break the ban. Somethings just need to 
be protected.

Not really. Even the Civil War (604-622) was pretty much restricted to the Core. 
NOne of the Imperiums wars would have had the sociological impact of the 
Great War. However, since the Imperium is based around the Sylean 
Federation, its possible the Federation may have (the Wars against the 
Revears perhaps, or maybe even the Interstellar Wars between the Terrans and 
the Vilani).

It takes 100 kN to accelrate 1 dTon at 1 G (since 1 kN accelerates 1 tonne
at 1 m/s^2, and 1 dTon masses 10 tonnes, and 1 G is 10 m/s^2.) So 2-G
scouts remain practical. Affordible scouts are a different issue, as the
various designs post - though as long as you don\'t go too Cadillac you can
manage it. (My design being the most extreme Cadillac example, especially
if you buy the neutrino sensor.)

	No, you\'re living in a world in which IG changed its mind several
times ... SSDS was based upon FF&S (TNE edition), which was supposed
to be the foundation for all T4 tech. Then along came Central Supply
Catalog, with an incompatible design system (VDS). Meanwhile, there
was a serious problem with weapons and penetration (a standard 250kg
HE bomb could knock out NORAD ...). When we started writing FF&S2, we
were expecting to try to fit CSC; instead, we were told CSC wasn\'t
quite canonical, and to stick to FF&S. Only, do things differently
(better, we hoped). So don\'t slit your wrists, swear at us instead ...

Ummm ... 1 kilonewton pushes 1 ton at 1 m/s. 4000 kN therefore accelerates
400 t at one gee. A standard scout/courier masses a lot more than 400 t.

QSDS and SSDS were literally knocked up over a weekend using FFS1. They
dont reconcile.

Part of the T5 project, as I understand it, is doing a FFS2-compliant
version of SSDS and QSDS.

    'from' => 'Walter Smith SmithW@HARTWICK.EDU',
    'body' => 'A minor human race, common near the Imperial Core and Trailing of there,
even into Vargr, Hiver and K\'Kree space. Tracking down their planet of origin 
has been, shall we say, somewhat problematical, what with Long Nights, 
Interregnums, new Empires and whatnot. Quarmic clans can be found in 
the best of starports, on starships and elsewhere, usually associated
with the trading and travelling culture of the starports and spacelanes
rather than that of the planets themselves. They are best known (by
those who know of them) as some of the best cooks, stewards and
innkeepers in known space.

Quarmas are, to most appearances, almost indistinguishable from the
humans who surround them. They are generally not interfertile with
the other branches of humanity (thus gaining them status as a 
species, or at least a subspecies), but genetic analysis has shown this
to be the result of a genetic quirk only some fifteen to twenty thousand
years old. Theories on genetic engineering or Ancient meddling have
been put forth, but not substantiated. It is widely held that the major
differences between the Quarmas and the other branches of humanity
are more cultural than physiological.

Physical Appearance: Quarmas are generally fair skinned, dark haired,
and have a shorter and stockier (if not portlier) body style than most 
humans on the average. Their facial features are otherwise almost
indistinguishable from Vilani norms.

Culture: Quarmas are full participants in the Vilani/Solomani space
based cultures that surround them, but do maintain cultural traditions
of their own. Many of these traditions are little known by outsiders,
though this is more due to ignorance than any attempt at secrecy.
Some topics are covered below.

Family: Quarmas have a knack for providing. They tend not to become
wealthy, but it is rare to find one destitute. It is also rare to find one
settled in a starport without children - their own, and those of Quarmas
currently travelling in places not fit for children. Thus is formed that
ever-changing Quarmas social unit, the Family.
In some ways, every Quarmas is a parent (or at least an Aunt or Uncle)
to every Quarmas child. "Family" in Quarmas society seems, at least
to outsiders, to include every Quarmas within travel distance, as well
as any humans, aliens or whatnot the local clan has grown close to.
These clan members work together to insure the survival and comfort of 
all through a mixture of hard work, mutual assistance and a nepotism
network that almost borders on the criminal.
Most confusing to outsiders is the fluid nature of personal relationships
within these Quarmas clan-families. Quarmas are pretty much
polygamous within their culture, though some will pretend otherwise
so as not to offend particularly strict local mores.
Note that this attitude only applies within their culture, and to those that
have been allowed to join them. Joining a Quarmas clan is a long,
tricky and unorthodox process, that pretty much boils down to 
a consensus amongst the local Quarmas that you are worth it.

Nonviolence: Quarmas are the cooks, barkeeps, innkeepers and
babysitters of the galaxy, and like it that way just fine. Some have 
learned the skills of self-defense, but few ever seem to develop the
instincts for it. A Quarmas is more often a mediator than a particiapant
in a conflict, though this is more a matter of attitude than any personal
lack of bravery.
To all but the most hardened of individuals, a Quarmas\' reputation acts
as an effective shield. Even a Vargr Corsair knows the value of a good
cook, and (as the head of the Khvargh Ghanurr once said), "A dead
Quarmas makes no pate."  Most Quarmas work actively to support
this popular mindset, doing their best to appear innocuous no matter
how serious a business they may be up to.

*********************************
Creating a Quarmas character (for CT rules):

Characteristics: use standard 2d6, with the following modifications:
Str: -1 (minimum 1)
End: +2

Careers:
Enlistment: A Quarmas character may only attempt to join the Merchant, 
Scout, Belter, Diplomat, or Other professions. If she fails her roll, she rolls
normally for the Draft.

Survival: Quarmas have a knack for being prepared, for bringing just
the right thing along to make things work out. A Quarmas may
use her Steward skill as a modifier to the survival roll, instead of a
modifier based on characteristics. This substitution is optional.

Skills: Quarmas come from a somewhat non-violent culture (though
not quite as non-violent as others such as the Virushi). A Quarmas
recieves Brawling and Blade Weapon skills normally, but the first 
level of any Gun skill is taken as level zero instead of level one. 
Quarmas characters should not otherwise be allowed a default skill-0
in any Gun Combat skill.
A Quarmas must recieve (at least) Steward-1 in her first term. If she
does not, one normally obtained skill must be traded in for Steward-1.
A Quarmas may exchange any characteristic increase for either
a level in Steward skill or a level in Survival skill, provided neither of
these skills have been otherwise obtained that term.

Aging rolls:
A Quarmas ages normally in all respects, including the use of anagathics.

Mustering Out:
A Quarmas character rolls normally on the mustering out tables,
with the exception that multiple weapon benefits may not be taken
as skill increases. Quarmas have always been more interested in
collecting interesting things than in martial excellence.

Role Playing Tips: Think "Hobbits in space". Or Mom - you know,
the kind who\'ll bake you cookies, but only if you wipe your feet
before you wander in through the airlock. (The scary part is, you\'ll

I would have to assume that the common room would have all the needed items
for cooking...  Also, I can see at this time maybe all a smaller ship needs
is storage space for the meals, ala 2300...  Each meal is packaged like a
modern TV dinner, when you open it, a flash, one-shot heater, heats up your
food for you...  When you are done with the meal you throw it away...

I may be going out on a limb here, and I\'m sure Marc will correct me if I\'m
wrong, but when I read that \'edict\', what is said to me was that Traveller
was not going to put out supplements that had to be labelled "for mature
audiences only" as White Wolf and others have occasionally chosen to do.
(White Wolf more than occasionally, I might add.) Truthfully, except for
mentions of alien reproductive methods and maybe the occasional scandal in
the Imperial court, sex as a major subject in and of itself in Traveller is
not neccesary. Traveller is a game of science-fiction adventure, not a game
of science fiction porn or even romance. Yes, these things do happen to
real people, and if you choose to portray them in your game, more power to
you, but they don\'t need explicit mention in a game where they are not part
of that game\'s purpose. We don\'t need a chapter on "The Joy of Hiver Sex",
nor do we need diagrams in FF&S3 on the subject. I\'d much rather space be
devoted to things like worlds, starships, the sweep of epic history, that
sorta thing. I do not think Marc was saying that "sex is something people
just don\'t do", I see it more as "sex as a main topic is irrelevant to what
Traveller is about, and therefore we will not publish supplements that
emphasize it."
It also keeps Traveller accessible to a potentially younger audience. You
may choose to see this as censorship; I see it as the game being kept on
topic.

I\'ve seen quite convincing demos of that.  Most recently M14 vs M16A2.  

Any ideas on a mechanic to say if the round actually exits the body or not?
It would factor on penetration rather than damage, I imagine.

  This would be a concern for  most all handguns etc (especially low caliber)
but not rifles... Armored targets may change everything, even for rifles...
The round penetrates but may lose enough energy to not leave an exit wound...
thus necessitating surgery to remove it.

Its a very sad fact of life that the prime directive #5 is neccessary. Traveller, like 
all RPG\'s, has to acceptable to the parents of the teenagers who buy it. And 
yes it is very hypocritical that violence is acceptable but sex is not. However 
that is a problem that goes way beyond Traveller or any other RPG. Besides its 
not too onerous, I really wont miss the scantily clad lesbian Aslans splashed 
all over the cover of T5. There is no reason why adventures can\'t cover subjects 
such as love, lust and other staples of literature without being gratuatous. Sure 
I don\'t really expect my political intrigue adventure where the players slowly 
uncover that their employer is a peadophile will ever see the light of day, even 
though I think its a darn good adventure. But I never expected it would. However 
that doesn\'t mean you have to stick to Disney style. Take for instance my 
Luriani write up. It clearly portrayed the Luriani as a culture which was very 
sexual, but I don\'t think it would have breached prime directive #5 (Marc please 
tell me if it did).

I\'d say Marc want Traveller to stay rated PG and I think its a good thing that it 
does.

Haven\'t read the supplement but I was in the Air Force when that
happened, and I know the work that went into accelerating
the mods to allow the inflight refuelling of the Hercs, and have
spoken to the pilot of one of the tankers.

Bloody crazy scheme if you ask me, one plane in a flat out dive,
the other almost stalling, and _then_ you gotta line up the tubes
and refuel before you hit the deck.

IMTU the silverish look originates from the frequencies of visible light
refracted by the different physics of N and J-Space.
Not all frequencies are being reflected, and most of the infrared and
microwave frequencies also can penetrate the border into J-Space. 
So there\'s no reason to worry about overheating the ship. The excess
energy can be absorbed by J-Space.

But that\'s the J-drive the Vilani use (IMTU). Perhaps the Aslan\'s is red
(B5), the Solomani\'s black, the Hiver\'s grey, the Zhodani\'s blue ...
the Vargr\'s checkered?

IMTU this restriction belongs to single bodys with enough density, not
accumulations of bodys with a centre of gravity.
An asteroid belt would also be such an accumulation, but its density is
too low to have effects as a whole, so only the single asteroids would
\'bounce off\' the Jumpspace Exit that is to open at their position.

I wonder what happens if a ship exits Jumpspace at the trajectory of a

OK, now it\'s getting interesting. The jump distances are for game\'s sake
in integer numbers. The differences the real world has got could also be
explained as using the uncertainty principle, but this also works the
other way, away from the target. I suppose this is what a misjump also
would lead to. The case of doing a Jump-1 \'in place\' makes it in real a
\'Jump-0\' - as the Number always indicated the number of parsecs travelled.
Seems as we\'ve found the \'ground state\' 0 of Jump Space.

IIRC there\'s also the possibility of having a Jump-.5 described somewhere
in the supplements according to Ancient technology, which perhaps uses 
a complete different J-Space-continuum with also other time-trajectories.
But this indicates that there are other effects that lead to shortened or
longer routes, also as the time increment changes. I think a Jumpspace
Expert could tell you a handful of these at once, but not me.

But all these considerations only are applicable if we provide that
Jumpspace is quantized - which IMTU no one proved this far.

No, George Reeves was shot. It was ruled a suicide, but a *lot* of

Actually, in *this* case, he has a point. It\'s not so much to get the
missiles clear of the ship\'s wedge as it is to get the missiles away
from from the firing vessel so that the *missile\'s* wedge doesn\'t mangle
the ship. 

The biggest "oops" I\'ve run into is that he suffers from the same
failure to work out the numbers as too many others do. He gave the
lengths, width and mass of a large ship. Only trouble is, if you assume
that the ship is *merely* as dense as water on average, it can only be
a couple of meters thick!

His million ton ships should be *billion* ton. He doesn\'t "get" the
square/cube law. That is, make something 10 times as big and surface
area goes up by 1000, while mass goes up by 1000.

It\'s not a matter of "technology". It\'s just that 200 radii is where
the thrust available from the sun will hold the statite in the
un-natural "orbit".

The "height" will depend on the mass of the planet, the brightness of
the star, and the radius of the planetary orbit.

Well, as I recall, its more like 200 *diameters*. 

Also, the statite has to be *farther* out if the planet masses more,
closer in if it masses less. If the star is dimmer, it has to be
farther out, if the star is brighter, it can be closer in. And you also
have to adjust closer or farther depending on the planet\'s orbit. 

A satellite has to balance "centrifugal force" from going around the
planet against the planet\'s gravity.

A statite has to balance "centrifugal force" from going around the
*star* and thrust from the star\'s solar wind against the gravity of
both the planet *and* of the star.

There are agents commonly used in surgery that selectively affect the
"voluntary" muscles. They do *not* affect the diaphragm. 

True, they are designed to "relax" the muscles in question, but if they
can do that, surely they can "lock" them just as well.

And if you are dispersing it in the air, the *rioters* can light it.

Identified by whom?  From how far before the RoM?  Ancients or Ziru Sirka?
I think there needs to be just a few more details here.  A lot of
information is best left in the category of "if tey ask"  This may be one
of them.  A character of Vilani stock may recognize obselete symbology on
the station, or its construction amy be so alien, and sensor readings
("corbaon dating") may give a vague indication of the station\'s age.

This should be supplied by the government person, not an insurance company

Ok, I\'m really confused now.  Is this an ancient site or a Vilani station?
Or is it a combination of the two (Vilani Archeological station where an
ancient artifact was being examined?).

An interesting start.  In my opinion it needs a bit more of a generic fit
with Traveller to be published.  Of course, it also needs to be finished
out.

There are four staterooms...though I suppose an extra workstation would help.

It\'s the neutrino sensor that runs the price up. Honest. Contractor fees

cheapest my brother could sell you.

(Without the neutrino sensor it\'s MCr 181; without the science optimization
on the main sensor it\'s MCr 131.)

In fact, the mass driver is the equivalent of the rail gun in Traveller (I
do not recall whether they use precisely the same technology).  It is,
under Megatraveller, quite deadly as a vehicle mounted weapon, but with a
range of only up to 70km.  Tech level provides an upper ROF limit of 225,
which, for a (forex) 20cm bore weapon is rather significant (note that this
requires about 30,000MW of power at 20cm,  A laser turret, at 200MW is a
better buy).

The players in my campaign installed a number of mass drivers, autocannon
and VRF Gauss guns on their starship for use against boarders and in ground
actions.  The operative question was "how much cargo space do we want to
give up for ammunition".

Incidentially, the only weapon used in the last encounter was an external
emergency liquid-hydrogen vent, at close range.  Anyone have range and
penetration on such a "weapon"?  I decided that they had to hover within 50
meters, but since the target was a mortar and stone building, the effects
were quite devastating (although most of the people had a chance to get out
first).  The material crystallized and became very brittle, collapsing
under its own weight.

Oh, and it was in a thin atmosphere, with an air temp hovering around zero
C.  Not that that should matter, much.

But we _do_ need diagrams & design systems for half a dozen types of
laser, plasma, fusion, PAW, "meson", gauss, etc. weapons?  And a combat
system that accurately models tumbling vs. non-tumbling bullet wounds?  
Gimme a freakin\' break.

The Vision statement, I believe, encompasses what a great majority of

I\'ve loved the suggestions that the core rules be relatively 
milieu-free, with a campaign sourcebook style text to bring in the 
Antares campaign setting, along with maps, library data, and UWP 
profiles.  I\'ve especially enjoyed hearing the proposal about the 
Secrets Of The Traveller Universe sourcebook, and I hope that this is 
pursued, if not by official channels, then maybe on the TML.

>T5 Contents: The T5 volume will contain the following rules sections

>F. Worlds. World Generation. World Surfaces. Terrain. Travel
on Worlds. Encounters. Animals. 

I hope that this section includes the extended system generation, and 
at least some info on extended world details, similar to World 
Builder\'s Handbook.  (Unfortunately, to hope for all of it in there 
would require an entire supplement:  Worlds and Systems, the complete 
supplement for world generation and detailing.)

>New To T5. 

>Cards.

Not my thing, but I\'ve seen them used in many games with great 
success, if I understand them correctly.  I\'m not to sure if I want 
to see a Magic: the Gathering craze sweep the Imperium, though.  :)

>Charts. The focus of T5 is the chart pages which detail how to do

This is one of the best ways I\'ve seen to present information.  MT 
made great use of this technique, and I personally prefer it.

I like this concept, so long as the integrity of Traveller\'s efforts 
to keep aliens well-thought out is maintained.  I don\'t want to see 
things boil down to AD&D "Elves, dwarves and humans" generic 
stereotypes.

>Tasks integrated into everything. Rather than just tacked on.

I like that concept.  MT tried to do this with CT, and it is my 
preferred system because of that.  Not sure I like the T4 system 
(haven\'t played it), and what I\'ve seen of T4 and T5 seem very 
similar.  However, it\'s all Traveller, and I\'ll support the game 
either way.

Again, I like the concept, and am happy to see this addition.

I\'ll reserve judgment on whether this is good or not until I can see 
how it will work out game mechanically.  It sounds like a lot of 
potential though, and one that can be very, very rewarding.  Perhaps 
Robert O\'Conner might have some interesting suggestions in this 
area...  :)

Thank you, Marc, for keeping the game alive.  We appreciate the hard 
work and effort you\'ve put into making Traveller what it is, and what 
it is to become.

Sorry but no. There are several reasons why, some of which I can\'t go into
detail about per Marc\'s \'request\'. Suffice it to say that I can give away
the freebies, but if any charge is made - even to cover cost - then I am
required to purchase another license. I\'m also using any extra money
generated for the sale of sets (versus individual supplements) to pay Bill
Keith for the use of his artwork in both the supplements and the calendar.
I\'m not required to do this - Marc owns the artwork - but I feel that
Bill\'s work greatly enhances the supplements, and it is only right that he
should receive at least a token payment.

There are a number of canon references to blank pieces of Imperial
stationery, useable to forge warrants of the forger is willing to take
the risks...

In SM Norris explicitly states that he overstepped his bounds and that
Strephon could have had his head on a platter over the Warrant taking
control of the fleet, and of the warrant making him archduke. Remember
Norris is a spook...most of his time he was Naval Intel...he would be
used to the "forgiveness is easier to obtain than permission" school.

If Strephon hasn\'t read his classics, the Warrant read something like
"The bearer has done what he has done with the permission of the
Emperor----<signed> Richelieu ^h^h^h^h Strephon" ;-) Blank checks like
these are necessary for agents to act of their own initiative in unknown
situations, but can come back to bite the writer on the a** if they fall
into the wrong hands.

Oddly enough, I\'d say that if the attack did low damage, odds are the
bullet has left the body.  To paraphrase my sniping instructor, you want
that round to play pinball on the target\'s ribs.  High damage indicates a
round that expended all of it\'s energy inside your victim.  Low damage
damage probably means a clean punch through soft tissue.  You\'ll still hurt
him from hydrostatic shock, blood loss, and gross tissue damage, but not as
badly.

Think of something spectacular.  Against a BD-wearing opponent.. perhaps
your shot hits his sensors/visor, momentarily blinding him, allowing you to
escape.  The shot hits and disables his weapon.  The shot hits the suit\'s
knee joint, locking one leg in place.

None of these do damage, but allow the player the chance to take advantage
of the unusual situation.

This is a minimalist approach.  The 13 ton cargo bay could easily be
concerted to other uses, including improved sensors (at a great increase in
cost), additional weaponry, or a small hanger of some sort (possibly for a
Marine Special Operations Team?)

The cost includes a 20% discount for the standard design.

Without getting too gross, you could make very low friction basins to
handle solid and liquid waste.  They would require very little water to
convey the wastes to a recycling plant.

On that note, I saw an interesting show last night about NASA\'s
preparations for a manned Mars mission.  They have a mock up of a habitat
where four people have been living for over two months.  Evidently, they
are filtering the water with 100% efficiency.

The old stand-by, the sonic shower is an option.  The last time I was in
hospital, I was bathed using a series of chemicals that did a good job of
cleaning me with out water.  They came in a powder that was rubbed into my
skin, then toweled off.  From what I understood, they take of the top layer
of dead cells from your skin, along with the dirt.  A similar item is
available for dry shampoo.  These aren\'t a complete substitute for regular
bathing, but would suffice for a week or two.

The various factions each have their own purchasing power and a near
simultaneous publishing would be optimal. 

I for one never bought T4 partially because I was following a TNE
Regency timeline and M:0 was of little or no interest to me. To get me
to make a large investment, (i.e. beyond FFS3) I want a post-virus 4th
Imperium setting. If nothing else, I want some closure on Lucan\'s Virus
empire and the Black Curtain. 

I will always treasure the thrill I got from first picking up the War!
issue of the Travllers Digest. I had the feeling of empire-shaking
history in motion. Likewise, I remember where I was when I learned of
Strephon\'s assasination (State College, PA gaming store). Virus, I
learned about on the TML. I didn\'t like all the details but I made minor
adaptions and bought it all. 

My point is that each of the incarnations of Traveller except M:0 has
had a shocking historical event which drove me to want to know more
about the new storyline. I think that may be  essential to the success
of T5.

Of course, that\'s just my opinion, I could be wrong...

Bye, 

Glenn

I just saw some cheesy Hollywood Expose type show about Reeves. There
was more than a little evidence he _didn\'t_ shoot himself. There were
something like six or seven bullet holes in the room where he shot
himself, he had recently broken of a long relationship with the wife of
a _very_ highly placed studio exec, and there were other holes in the
case as well.

Traveller is a game about technology. It is about more than that, of
course, but it is. It is not a game about doing the nasty in zero-gee.
That\'s what my point was.

And no, we don\'t need a combat system that complicated. In fact, I would
HATE to see what is essentially a simple game polluted with that kind of
stuff. For one thing, "accurately" modelling anything is pretty subjective
in a game where your first three stats are your hit points; when\'s the last
time you took damage to your Dexterity? let the realism freaks design their
own cumbersome systems; Traveller should go no farther into combat
"realism" than say Snapshot or maybe TNE (with more reasonable hit point
totals) and leave it at that, IMO.

I admit, I read the medical stuff that has come down the pike. I\'m sure the
author is highly knowledgeable. There is no flippin\' way I would even DREAM
of using that stuff. Adds way too much complexity.

Besides, GURPS already does that stuff, and does it relatively simply
compared to other games I have seen that have tried it.

Actually, the last time my arm was in a cast my dexterity 
was damaged pretty badly.  Ask the person with a leg in a 
cast or with a permanent limp the same question.  

Endurance is the same flavor. The ability to play Energizer 
Bunny is severely reduced in someone sick or injured. The 
location of the wound probably doesn\'t effect that too 
terribly much as it is a strain on the system to heal.

Not a bad idea.  But what color do we use for variant Milieu to use?

I have talked before about multiple entry points to the system.When there is a
central rules book, then every other product needs to refer back to it (and
often to half a dozen other products as well). And since you can\'t be sure the
players have those books, we face real restrictions on what we can usefully
do.

At the same time, players want to be able to USE the rules book they buy.

I envision a milieu-specific basic rules book (which is, at the moment
oriented toward Antares circa 0198). A multiple milieu rule book needs to show
(for example, the ranks that Rule Of Man navy uses, the types of ships early
Terran\'s built, and the world generation system for the Vilani Empire, in
addition to the Imperial M:0 stuff).

I envision (for example) a later product called The Interstellar Wars. It
would be, like the basic rules book above, a stand-alone book, but it would
have the world generation material altered to reflect Terran and Vilani worlds
circa 2300 AD. It would deal in more detail with space combat, and talk about
Terran and Vilani ships. And it would be all in one volume so the player isn\'t
casting about for this book or that one.

I have put out a small number of Minor Race Generation rules drafts and I\'m

One element of Minor Races is that (although you can encounter them anywhere)
you generally find 99% of their citizens within, say, 10 parsecs of their

The actual color coding will be defined later. As to milieux, I see the
following:

T5 (set about 198 and concetrating in Antares)
First Contact. Solar System pre-jump leading up to the discovery of jump.
The Interstellar Wars. Emphasizes space combat between Terrans and Vilani.
The Rule of Man
The Long Night.
(M:0)
(Antares circa 0198)
The Barracks Emperors
The Psionic Suppressions.

Two others I would love to do are

The Far Far Future (circa 2000)
Grandfather\'s Children (including uplifted humans running around in automated
ships doing Grandfather\'s bidding).

Faraway Sector. A kit/boxed set with blank maps and everything you need to set

So a milieu writer could write the basic chrome and setting for use with the 
core rules?  And all they\'d have to include in the new book is just the 
\'detailing rules\' for their milieu?  This is a Good Thing...

I think overall that your outline sounds very good. I think that it\'s
a good didea to try to keep the core rules simple and have an optional, 
more complex set of rules that remain consistent, so that you don\'t end 
up with bolted-on rulesets (like FF&S2/QSDS/SSDS).

Woo-hoo! My dream come true! Please just keep in mind that the 
Interstellar Wars period will not resemble anything Traveller, except 
for the Vilani and Jump drives. No air/rafts, very little inertial
compensation in ships and lot and lots of space battles. (Maybe even 
an excuse for piracy finally!). Very cool.

Do you happen to have the URL to William Keiths web-page where he lists the
books he\'s authored and his current projects?

In MT, FFS1 and  FFS2 jump drives are way over priced for the volume:
0.3 Mcr per m^3 when it should be 0.3 Mcr per Displacement Ton. As a
result the J-Drives are 14 times too expensive when compared to CT, High
Guard and T4 basic design.

The error was introduced in MT when they went to m^3 and has been
propagated ever sense. 

I have not noted this in any of the errata for any of these
publications. 

Or it could be just another instance of the MegaCorps trying to squeeze
the small guy.

the settings listed by Marc as directions for T5 Sourcebooks.  
Currently, I know that several of these areas have already begun to 
be defined by some of the avid gamers on the list and on the web.  I 
myself am working on a First Contact campaign, while Andrew Vallance 
has done some incredible work gathering together Interstellar War 
info.  (I also understand the Writer\'s List discusses that one 
frequently.)  Both have that new frontiers/Babylon 5 feel to them 
that can be used to pull new players in.

The Long Night has a lot of potential (ala the Foundation novels), 
and the Rule of Man/Ramshackle Empire shines with the spark that the 
Shattered Imperium and Steve Perry\'s Matador Trilogy (up to 7 books 
now, isn\'t it?) show quite well.

The Barracks Emperors don\'t really spark my interest, but the 
Psionics Suppressions tends toward the fall of the Jedi Knights kind 
of image.

The Far Far Future and the Grandfather\'s Children sourcebooks also 
show incredible potential for super high tech games and for the 
closing out of several milieu-spanning plotlines (the Alpha and Omega 
of the Traveller Universe.)  

I would also like to see each new sourcebook detail a new sector as 
well, possibly with a page or two of the sector\'s rise and fall in 
importance throughout the range of Traveller history.  There are 35 
sectors that have been generated, if I recall correctly, and many of 
them deserve development.

And then, of course, is the Referee\'s Guide to the Mysteries of the 
Traveller Universe, the pseudo-canonical bible to the major plotlines 
of the OTU that writers can use to keep their products within the 
realm of OTU canonicity.  (Disclaimer: This is not meant to spark the 
canon debate again.  My apologies to whomever might be 
unintentionally offended by this statement.  I\'m just interested in 
seeing the overall picture of the OTU as those who built it intended 
it to go, and this sourcebook looks like one way to do so.  My 
thanks for your time.  End of disclaimer.)

My final question is very simple:  I\'m sure there are people 
interested in submitting supplement ideas and/or working on these 
setting sourcebooks.  Many of these people do good work, and want 
to help Marc (and others) realize the great depth of the Traveller 
universe.  How does one go about getting permission to do so for an 
official product?  How can we help to contribute to the game?

Seriously, if you are going to spend MCr 230 on a ship, I would have more

	I have gotten mine to MCr 106.3...the second largest item-cost is the sensor

Cutting that back to just standard Civilian saves a good chunk of change, but

Quick question:

Has anyone noticed the possibilities that have been planted regarding 
the Return of the Ancients to the Spinward Marches in GT:BTC?  I 
probably don\'t have the appropriate inside information (ie read all 
the adventures, digests, journals, etc), but there\'s some interested 
evidence that indicates that one of Grandfather\'s Children (or 
Grandchildren, or a clone, or a pseudobiological construct of some 
kind) has returned to the Marches:

1099:  Reports of an unidentified vessel sighted outside of major 
systems on the spinward edge of the Imperium.

1109:  The Imperial vessel Midu Kunivaak was saved by an unknown 
vessel from plunging into a Gas Giant, without using tow lines of any 
sort.  The vessel then fled under high acceleration before it could 
identify itself.

1110 to 1118:  Droyne begin to increase their appearance in Spinward 
Marches starports.  Also, the new large Oytrip on Candory and Andor 
is being brought together by a Droyne who resembles a sport caste, 
but is actually not of that caste (different markings), and is called 
Muodray (Little Father).

1115:  Aslan ihatei are repulsed from Talos/District 268 by a single 
powerful ship, identified as being of similar to Droyne construction. 
 (Easier to tell now that they\'ve been travelling.  Not quite as 
widespread in 1109, see above.)

1117:  Droyne colonists settle Sansibar/Querion far from the human 
settlement (and their interference, one would assume.)

1118:  All Droyne leave Spinward Marches starports for a period of 
time and none are seen plowing the spacelanes for a short period.  
Then business returns to normal, without comment.

Something\'s cooking with the Droyne, but I am not yet certain what it 
is.  Is Grandfather preparing to return to normal space?  Has an 
Ancient pseudobiological robot been activated and, not finding it\'s 
master/father, now feels compelled to watch over and guide the Droyne 
under the its own version of Asimov\'s Laws of Robotics?  Or did one 
of the kids or grandkids slip one by Grandfather, and get a clone 
killed while he/she/it slept away in suspended animation, only to 
wake up now that Grandfather "has left the area"?

Any thoughts or opinions would be appreciated.

In Service,
Jason

PS  Did anyone notice the Sixth Frontier War coming up, with a 
possible Darrian/Zhodani alliance?  Maybe it\'s motivated by the 
coming Empress Wave, if that\'s still part of the overall plotline.  
(In 1120, the Wave would be ~87 ly away, if it\'s moving at the speed 
of light.  That\'s only 26.69 hexes away from the Imperial border.  
Hmmmm.)

	 I would like to vote for a Deluxe Starter Traveller/ Deluxe TNE
approach...the core rules, maybe the ship/vehicle design rules, and a starting
sector complete w/ map and UPP\'s in a boxed set.  I realize this would cost
more than just putting out the softcovers...but I think it would be well worth
it...I would gladly pay $40-$50  for the boxed set.

	As to setting, I am not necessarily sure I like the M0 idea...maybe a setting
on the Imperial/Aslan border area during the Aslan Border Wars?

	With regards to the starship design system...I am not in favor of having more
than one system...like QSDS/SSDS/FF&S.  One system, done with full detail,
THEN "dumbed down" to a simple system.  The more design systems, the greater
chance of incompatibility errors.

All IMHO, of course.

Something to remember...the Scout/Courier is _not_ necessarily a
standalone survey vessel. Book 6 talks about Survey Cruisers that carry
several Type S\'es with them to conduct large scale survey ops.

The Type S, as I see it, has always been sort of the \'jeep\' of
starships, a general purpose, small, jumpcapable ship to get someone or
something small out a couple of parsecs, without a huge ship signature.
It probably _can_ be used as a sensors platform, but only with
modifications and jury rigging. I\'m sure there are 100mCr Type S\'es out
there, but they\'ll be like _Seeker_ variants...with expensive
modifications in the sensors suite and so forth; the _Finder_ variant,
anyone? (comes with a big multicolored version of the Imperial Sunburst
;-)

about the new storyline. I think that may be  essential to the
successof T5.

Of course, that\'s just my opinion, I could be wrong...

So far our discussions have been all over the place, but it looks as
though there will be two competing groups trying to grow into a 4th
Imperium.  One growing out of the Marches (H.Hale\'s work) and one from
the Solomani Rim.  PLEASE NOTE: The work of this group is not yet
blessed by MM.

Well, there you have it, people.  If you want to put out a version of
Traveller (or any other game) that falls on it\'s face in no time flat,
just ignore the repeated urgings of it\'s creator.

Wideawake field, Ascension Island, to be precise. That\'s a whole lot
closer to the Falklands than the UK is. The strikes also tied up the
whole capability of Wideawake.

ObTraveller: I\'m a bit scare on Traveller history. Any instances of
`really deep\' strikes being run with massive tanker support?

    'body' => 'Shuchithra is a striking individual, in many ways.  Although she
is only 1.5m tall, and masses only 55kg, she nevertheless has
"presence", and stands out even in crowds.  Ten years of
professional beam dancing, along with almost daily practice in a
number of martial arts and some gymnastics experience as a child,
has given her a gracefulness rarely seen in someone as young as
she is.  Her alabaster skin is set off by jet-black hair, which
she keeps cut short (usually in a "page boy"), and deep violet
eyes.  When not actually performing, she wears loose-fitting (but
not baggy) clothes, primarily in medium-to-dark greens, often
with yellow, gold, or magenta accents.  Her soft voice has
frequently been described as "enchanting"; nevertheless, she has
no difficulty making herself heard when she needs to or wants to.
Unique among beam dancers, Shuchithra\'s performances include her
singing, rather than just the music or music and light of other
performers.

When she is performing, she invariably wears a black sequined
full-coverage body suit, leaving only her face visible to the
audience.  Her performance always starts in full darkness.  Her
first number is invariably to sing a ballad, begun \\a capella\\;
her dance begins about halfway through the number, and gradually
brings both light (both dance beams and house lights) and music
into her performance.  Audiences respond well to her
performances; she has been said to play the audience\'s emotions
with as much skill as she programs her console. In the last three
years, she has never failed to sell out a single performance
within one standard day of the tickets going on sale.

Strangely, in spite of her popularity and stardom, Shuchithra
does _not_ have a collection of "roadies" following her, and her
entourage consists of only her three bodyguards, her business
manager, her personal tailor, and her personal physician.
Additional staff is hired as needed, for the duration of her
visit to a particular world. On occasion, some of that staff will
be asked to stay on for a few additional worlds, but in general,
Shuchithra does not maintain a large staff for any great length
of time, and is reluctant to ask people to leave their
homeworlds.

Shuchithra _never_ speaks out on "advocacy" or political issues,
and, with one exception, keeps her views on such issues to
herself.  Even on the one issue that where her views are public,
they are known from her actions rather than outspokenness: she
cancels performances where the government attempts to control or
restrict the content.

Referee\'s Notes:  Shuchithra is psionic, although nobody knows
this (not even Shuchithra).  She is a full empath, unconsciously
projecting her emotions and reading and responding to those of
the people around her.  This ability subtly influences her
performances, and is a factor (although a minor factor - her beam
dancing talent is real) in her popularity.  Her talent for
programming her own beam dance stages is also a manifestation of
her psionic abilities, in the form of Machine Empathy.

Referees detailing a character profile or resume for Shuchithra
(her full name; she legally changed it early in her career)
should give her higher-than-normal dexterity, endurance,
intelligence, and education, and a social level appropriate for a
major famous performer. Skills should focus on things like
gymnastics, dancing, and martial arts, though she should also
have a good level of computer skill.

Shuchithra invariably stays at facilities operated by or funded
by the Travellers\' Aid Society or equivalent organizations, as
these are not open to the general public.  While there, she is
not unapproachable by other guests for a few minutes of quiet
conversation.

Shuchithra will instantly cancel performances on worlds where the
government attempts to control or restrict the content of her
performance.

She will hire teams to act as cadre for on-planet security (and
will occasionally ask a particularly effective team to stay on
for a few planets), or ships and crews to carry relief supplies
to a disaster area on a nearby planet.  Teams/ships that have
acted on behalf of governments that practice censorship of art
will not be hired under any circumstances.  Teams/ships that have
acted for her before will be remembered, and hired again if need
and opportunity coincide.

As a patron, she is wealthy enough to buy and outfit a yacht or
courier ship without needing to take out a mortgage;
nevertheless, she does not spend money unnecessarily, and is a
very savvy investor - she will insist on strong justification for
any purchases she is asked to make in support of a team\'s effort.

How do other refs handle Social Standing of this type (i.e. unrelated to
nobility in any way)? How do you represent a person who
was born to commoners and holds no noble title, yet exercises extreme
influence through fame or wealth?

More like, there would be a book called "The Interstellar Wars" with chargen
for Terran Confederation and Vilani people. ince it is set in a specific place
and time,t here wouldn\'t be world gen; instead we would have the world lists
for the Terran Vilani frontier. The ship chapter would chronicle the basic
ship types avaiable to both sides. Ship combat might be expanded to cover
fleet actions.

Now, you would get one book with everything needed to play during the IW
period. If you wanted to design ships, you could go back to the T5 core book,
but most people wouldn\'t design ships, they would use what was there. If you
wanted to (or were forced to) explore unexplored areas, you could go back to
the T5 core book, but most people woun\'t. they would stay within the ordinary
borders of the era.

The IW book would be a "stand alone" entry point. Buy this book and start
playing right away; you don\'t NEED anything else.

In G:T it can be done by using the advantage called Reputation.  You
*could* do it with Soc in Trav, but with the caveat that the high Soc
was from a non-noble source.  Just give the character a B, C, or
whatever sans title.

Anything to make you happy Doug :) Besides, Kenji should be pleased as well.
Pelvic-mounted plasma guns, chest-mounted sensor arrays, and backside-mounted sand

This is a good idea, and one that had crossed my mind - because
it _is_ bloody unlikely for these numbers to change.  I\'m not
sure why it didn\'t make it into the post.

Bear in mind that for a milieu-specific map, you also need to
leave space for the starport type.  I\'m also far from convinced
that base presence needs to be shown on the map at all, with the
possible exception of parties using Scout ships (which could
reasonably want to know where the scout bases are, since fuel
there is free).

Speaking only for myself, while I know little about tumbling bullet wounds

me, my knowledge of the . . . squishier subject is at least sufficient that
I don\'t need diagrams.

If you are using QSDS: The Software (TM) then the final price does include

Yup. 

I\'d suggest making them the same size as CCG cards, so that organized
types can get those plastic cardholder sheets and just load up their
characters that way.

(Mind you, I\'m NOT suggesting making a CCG Traveller game. Whille I\'d love
a Traveller card game, I hate the "collectable" part of CCGs, which makes
them a huge money drain.)

Someone who earns a social standing would have a social standing based on
the power he/she can wield. If a certain rich merchant can order people
around like a similar baron, this individual would have the social standing
of a baron, regardless if he/she were knighted.

Actually, I\'m not crazy about PBEM as a format.  I tried one PBEM 
game for a few months and it\'s just not my bag.  I like a little faster 
pace than the snail\'s crawl that PBEM seems to inevitably become.

I do currently run an IRC campaign on Monday nights, but it is a 
very different setting...pre-first contact Solar system (early 21st 
century) in what is non-canonical enough of a setting to really 
mess with players\' sense of reality...

FWIW, I researched a lot for the book before I wrote word one (6 
months or so between various projects I was working on for IG).  
Some of the research and thinking that went into VH is being used 
to torture players in the IRC campaign...although they don\'t know 
that yet...

On the subject of combat/damage systems for characters can I enter a
plea?  Take a look (at least briefly) at the N.Robin Crossby/Columbia
Games "HarnMaster" system for medieval fantasy.  The point here is that
they use a radically different way of looking at injury/damage that
really has an effect on the way players view and play their characters.
In short injuries are attributes which are gained rather than being
reflected by a pool of "life" which is lost.  Instead of having hit
points/life levels/characteristics points/whatever which are whittled
away until the final vicious slash to the big toe with a fruit knife
takes away the last one (resulting in death) in HM you just keep gaining
injury points.  Of course, they have several effects on how you perform
- - penalties on task attempts and saving throws to see if the sheer
"weight" of damage overwhelms your bodies ability to cope in any number
of ways.  In HM you can die of bloodloss, shock, trauma, suffocation,
infection or heart failure but not "running out of hit points" and yet
the system is almost as simple as the standard Traveller stat. reduction
to use.  Please, at least check it out.

Cheers,

Andy

When the choice is between PBEM & not playing, I\'ll take PBEM.  <shrug>  YMMV.

I see what you mean. However, I think it is heading towards the
hypothetical because a double 1 roll on an average task will hit with a
skill of 1 and characteristic of 1 (total asset = 2).

Easy is 1.5D, and I would argue that a double 1 would hit anyway because of
the asset (Skill+characteristic) level.

T4 doesn\'t say that. i would hope that it isn\'t the case...

The way I play Traveller, my response would be \'tough\' to the player. You
hit. It doesn\'t mean your 9mm can penetrate ABD. Laws of physics etc. If
you go into house rules mode I would say double the dice rolled for damage
or handwave an interesting effect (eg the round doesn\'t penetrate but
damages an important valve/faceplate).

I tend to avoid a hero style of play for Traveller, and will accept to a
point that players can\'t do certain thing. I think someone taking on ABD or
other armour (for example the 4R cited) is risking a lot, and the rules are
fair. Alternatively, the players\' could go for a pinpoint shot or extra
damage shot by raising the task a level, or help by aiming or use auto or
burst fire.

T4\'s system is fast and bloody. Snub pistols are killers. Most average hits
on unarmoured characters will drop them on the first shot (avg 10.5 dmg vs
avg 7 hits on a stat). It\'s one of the things I like about the game. I hope
that Marc is using it as a basis for the exapnded rules he\'s mentioned,
because it is one of the first versions of Traveller where I\'ve liked the
combat system. CT was okay, MT was confusing until I got the MT refs
shield, TNE involved to much mechanics and dice rolling. IMo of course.

3 years ago (if I remember correctly) the UK government of the time (John
Major\'s) re-introduced the 2 minute silence at 11.00am on 11/11 each year.
I was pleasantly surprised when most companies, schools etc happily took to
observing it. Until then, Armistice day was only remembered on the nearest
Sunday for a long while.

At work, the site was tannoyed, and a cannon set off (either in Liverpool
or somewhere on the Wirral) marking the start and finish of the service.

I don\'t know of any.  

The game Fifth Frontier War does come with two tanker squadron
counters for the Zhodani, and the Imperium gets a few in
reinforcements, I think, but I\'ve never seen them used for deep
strikes.  The rules have the effect of limiting tankers to allowing a
fleet to refuel at a hostile-controlled system that lacks a gas giant

This is going to be tricky, but let\'s see the spec and budget.

The Scout was originally LBB2, so

100dton, J-2, 2G, 4 staterooms, one double turret (no guns)
Model 1/bis computer, air/raft (4ton) Cargo 3 tons, Bridge,
40dtons of fuel (20 jump and 20 manoeuvre), MCr 29.43.

The LBB2 cost of the components is:
Jump      10MCr
Manoeuvre  4MCr
Power      8MCr
Hull       2MCr
Computers  4MCr

Oh and its TL9.

The design presented below comes close.

With all that manoeuvre fuel, I can use HEPlaR, but in order to let it fly
around planets there is 1G of Contra Grav.

The TL 9 had to be bent a bit-
          the fusion plant will need to be TL 12 to be small enough,
          the G-Compensation is also TL-12,
          the Jump Drive and the lasers are TL 11,
          TL10 is needed for the HEPlaR.

The ship cannot manoeuvre and shoot at the same time.
The G-Comp could be 1-G and TL10 and save 10MW.

The ship is too cheap! at 30MCr without discount and many discounted lower
tech parts, the sticker cost is probably 20-23MCr to a group. The 3I
probably pays about 16MCr and spend the rest on an improved sensor suite.

    'body' => 'Hello,

I am considering purchasing T4, mostly based on the positive
experience I had with Classic Traveller quite a few years ago in
college.  If I am to dive into Traveller again, I would like to
go with the current version (besides, I have no idea where my old
traveller stuff is).

I have been surfing the internet looking for Traveller info
(there is plenty) and came across a scathing review of T4, a.k.a.
"Marc Miller\'s Traveller".  I have listed the review below.

Is the game really as bad as this guy says it is?  If so, maybe I
should give up my plans on picking up the game again.  What do
you think?

Sam Kramer

The review is below:

Marc Miller\'s Traveller

Author: Marc Miller
Category: game
Company/Publisher: Imperium Games
Cost: 25
Page count: 192
ISBN: 1-57828-000-1
Capsule Review by Scott Shafer on 03/29/98. 

Every now and then a product comes along which is so bad, that
you wonder why in God\'s name you ever picked it up in the
first place. This is one of them. The latest version of the
Traveller rules is a Travesty. It is poorly laid out, poorly
thought
out, and a general mess. Traveller is one of the classic games of
the science fiction role-playing genre. Throughout the years
it has been redone time and again-- Traveller begat MegaTraveller
which begat Traveller the New Era which begat diddly
squat-- each new edition becomes just a little bit weaker and
weaker. 

Kind of like hillbilly incest or cloning-- sooner or later all of
those genetic imperfections will come to rest in some idiot
bastard child-- this is that idiot bastard child. The book starts
off well enough, with a commendable set of goals for T4,
which included, returning to the simpler mechanics of Classic
Traveller, and returning to standards that reject gratuitous sex
and violence. It goes downhill from there. 

All of the rules which you will need for play are included, but
the various charts are scattered willy-nilly within the chapters
and are ranged in no discernable order. There is a chapter on
character generation, but unlike in previous versions of
Traveller where you could end up with useless characters after a
bout of creation frenzy-- these guys are skilled to the teeth!
The game system appears to be unbalanced, with one problem being
it is all to easy to succeed at "impossible" tasks. 

Combat rules, world creation rules, starship creation rules are
included, which is commendable considering so many games
will try to swamp you with 10 million supplements-- but these
rules are also unorganized messes. The starship creation rules
even lack an essential table for the creation of starships.
Errata can be found on the Imperium Games site, but its a doozy!
You get a few corrections, and a back breaking load of
"suggested" changes. This game gets a solid "F." 

My advice is don\'t waste your money. Pick! up a copy of the
Classic Traveller rules, and you won\'t be disappointed-- pick
this up, and if you remember the past, you will be disappointed
by what you read in the present. 

Style: 1 (Unintelligible)
Substance: 1 (I Wasted My Money)

the scout in Supp 7 had a bay which was to hold seensor equipment, I
take this to mean that the Exploratory/Survey sensors are removed before
the ship is let out on detached duty leaving it with a standard Civilian

    'body' => 'LIFE PURSUITS
	Just as careers are formal ways in which a player character can acquire
skills and experience, life pursuits represent specific areas of interest in
which player characters choose to express themselves. Life Pursuits are best
understood as specializations, vocations, or sometimes hobbies. A naval career
officer might have a Life Pursuit of Astrogator (which reflects a career
specialization) and another Life Pursuit of Acting (which is a hobby). A
character may complete a Life Pursuit card if he or she meets the
prerequisites for the Life Pursuit. A character may have any number of Life
Pursuits subject only to meeting the prerequisites, holding the required
skills, and meeting the required S+C.
	The list of Life Pursuits below is not comprehensive; other Life Pursuits can
be defined (and recorded) on Life Pursuit cards by the Game Master (often at
the behest of a player)..
	The Life Pursuit Card. Form 47 is used to record a specific Life Pursuit.
Characters create a Life Pursuit Card when they decide to embrace a specific
Life Pursuit. Because Life Pursuits reflect specializations and interests,
most characters restrict themselves to two or three Life Pursuits.
	Aspirations. A character may aspire to a Life Pursuit even if he or she does
not meet the requirements. If an individual aspires to a Life Pursuit, it
means he or she "wishes" he or she could do that. The Experience rule allows a
character with a Life Pursuit card to take the 4-year term skill level
increase in any skill noted on a Life Pursuit card (including on an Aspiring
Life Pursuit.
	S+C. Many life pursuits are determined by the ability to be successful. A
combination of Skill and Characteristic (S+C) of 12 is enough to virtually
guarantee success at Average tasks; S+C 15 can guarantee success at Difficult
tasks; S+C 18 can guarantee success at Formidable tasks. Many of the life
pursuits shown here indicate minimum levels of S+C.
	Its Always About Travelling. There are an infinite number of careers and life
pursuits possible, but Traveller player characters are primarily concerned
with jobs, careers, specializations, and avocations which include travel as
part of their responsibilities.

<Life Pursuit Card snipped>

<added for reference>

EXPERIENCE (T5)
	The completion of the character generation process does not end the
accumulation of skills. Characters receive one skill level every year.
	Experience Points (EP). An experience point is expressed as a skill and a
point (such as Pistol-1*). It is followed by an asterisk to distinguish it
from a skill level.
	Procedure. At the end of every game session, the game master awards EPs.
After evaluating the game activities, the game master awards one EP to each
character, based on the skill which was best or most effectively used by the
character during that session. Each player records the EP for his or her
character. [if only one game session is played during a character\'s year, he
or she has one opportunity to get an EP; if there are 10 sessions, then he or
she has 10 opportunities to get EPs; EP awards are mandatory (unless tthe
characters were in cold sleep the whole time, or something)]
	On the characters birthday, EPs are examined [for example, Pistol-1*,
Rifle-4*, Cryptogarphy 3*]. The EP with the highest level of usage is
converted to one level of skill and awarded to the character. All other
Experience Points are lost [so on his birthday, Eneri Dinsha gets +1 to
Rifle.]
	Aging Bonus. In addition to normal experience skill increases, each time the
character consults the aging table (on his or her birthday) [or should this be
on every year Mod 4 (ie 22, 26, 30, etc), the character may receive one level
of skill in any skill listed on a Life Pursuit card (alternatively, the second
highest level of Experience Points is converted to a skill level for the
character).
	Restrictions. Because Experience Points can only be awarded in terms of
skills actually used, they can only be awarded in skills already held by the
character, or in default skills. The only ways of acquiring non-default skills
not already held by a character is through education (through formal education
or instruction by another character), or from a Life Pursuit Card [allows
choice of this particular skill without regard to use, and it can come from an
Achieved Life Pursuit (perhaps Acting) in which the character has some skill,
or from his one Aspiring Life Pursuit (perhaps Astrogation) even though the
character does not have that skill... because he has been studying on his own
in his spare time.]

The list was of careers for character generation. I just posted "Life

Conceivably (and assuming that various discriminatory legislation is not in
force, it would be possible to have a Scout Psionic or a Naval Psionic or an
Entertainer Actor Psionic. A psionic then becomes a specialization within a
career, or an interest independent of a career, or a hobby. Even someone
running a Psionic Institute becomes a Scholar Professor Psionic, or perhaps a
Functionary Administrator Psionic.

I have specified that most will be 2.5 x 3.5 inch cards, which is the CCG card
size (same as Magic cards). Some cards are, however, 7 x 2.5 and some are 3.5
x 5 (various double sizes in order to carry enough information).

I\'d like them to be round cornered and of sturdy stock, but they are not
Collectible in the Magic sense. They are useful and even tradable for some
people.

Well, 2300 AD allows characters to build up renown points.
That wouldn\'t quite be SS, but it could work for a way to build up influence
without a huge

That\'s how it looks from here.  IIRC, there was even mention of a 4 ton sensor 
module that dropped into the \'cargo\' area of the Type S.  I can\'t remember 
where I saw this, or how much it cost.

Are the CCG cards standard playing card size (2.5x3.5")?  I\'ve never

Traveller info (there is plenty) and came across a scathing review of
T4, a.k.a. "Marc Miller\'s Traveller".  I have listed the review below.
Is the game really as bad as this guy says it is?  If so, maybe I
should give up my plans on picking up the game again.  What do you
think?

========
A few thoughts.  First, the date of the review was almost two years
after the book was published, and a couple of months after IG has
effectively bitten the dust.  Second, there are several other reviews
published on the web that cover the content and that of the later
books in better detail.  My conclusion for you here is that the T4
Rule book had a number of hurry induced faults and a few failings, but
that the system does have it\'s redeaming qualities.

All that being said, I would encourage you to spend your money on the
original Traveller rules (available many places on the web, even on
eBay.com) or on the Mega Traveller rules set (ditto).  I think that
they would be to your liking based on your previous involvement with
the game.

Also note from the discussion here that T5 will probably be available
next year.  In production now is GURPS Traveller from Steve Jackson
Games ( www.sjgames.com/gurps/traveller ).  Finally, if further
research convinces you that T4 id worth a try (I have enjoyed it) then
you will find that the books are available many places at a good
discount from their original.  For instance, there are several listed
on http://surf.to/traveller-trader , which is a free trading page that
I put up.

Finally, let me encourage you to pick up the game, in whatever form,
and enjoy it.  There is nothing else so versitile, rich and enjoyable
as THE original Sci-Fi RPG!

Well, T4 isn\'t exactly the current version, Marc Millar is currently working on a 
major revision (T5) which should be out sometime near the end of 1999 
(hopefully). However the review is unduly harsh. T4 (and most IG products) had 
some very serious quality problems (mostly layout and excessive errata). 
However I\'d rate the basic T4 rule book 6 out of 10 (but you do need to get the 
errata from the IG website). If you enjoyed CT you will probably find T4 
worthwhile, but it would be better to wait for T5.

Simple sociology.  Here in Maine we have a few "Minor Races".  They
are seldom seen outside of their little enclaves in Portland.  Nature
of the beast.  It\'s easier to blaze new trails in the wilderness than
among other cultures.  Sad, perhaps, but true.

I agree that charts and information are vital to be able _to_ play the
game but it seems to me that some narrative material is necessary to
make people _want_ to play the game.  If the game does not catch peoples
interest then why are they going to want to play it?  [This may be a
question of terminology and Marc may well have been including background
information in information.]

The trend in the RPG industry (IMNSHO) is towards greater emphasis on
story and less emphasis on system.  I would like a simple system that
had a plausible level of believability with options for detail. More
than that I would like to see a T5 where someone new to Traveller would
pick up the book and say "Hey this looks like a fun & interesting
setting to play in." if they happened to say "Hey this is a good
system." that would be nice too but is not as important.

I have had good role playing experiences with all kinds of systems.  It
seems to me tha it is the Ref (and to a lessser extent, the players) who
make a game work, the rules just make it easier.

I agree with you on most of your examples but I think this particular
example is more likely to have been one of the new GTL 13 [TTL 16]
Darrian patrol cruisers.  It probably used its repulsors to help the
Midu Kunivaak.  [See it\'s TNE stats in the Regency SB] althoughtits
repulsor may not be strong enough to help a 3,000 ton Midu class ship.

I am note sure that a Ancient has much of a _motive_ to save an Imperial
ship.  Further if it wanted too it may well have been capable of doing
so from sufficient range that it would have been undetected by the Midu
Kunivaak\'s crew who were presumably a bit busy.  A Darrian Patrol
Cruiser on the other hand would have two good reasons to help the
Imperials 1) they are allies and 2) Humanitarian reasons.

I will note that to a Darrian it might seem that the Imperium was
getting closer to the Sword Worlds given the GT treatment of
developments in the Sword Worlds & the Border Worlds.  Where an
objective observer might see Impeial membership for a former Sword World
as a good thing which would lead to assimilation a Darrian might see it
as the thin wedge that will result in the Imperium (or at least the
parts near the Darrian Confederation) assimilating Sworld Worlder
values.

US Games Systems makes and sells decks of blank standard size playing
cards.  You can get them blank on both sides or blank on one side with a
standard playing card back on the other.  A deck of 55 cards retails for
$3 US, which is only about 5.5 cents each.  They also are available in
decks of 80 for about the same cost per card.  Distributor/Retailer
pricing is even lower, of course.

Whilst the price per dTon may have changed from CT, I think that you\'ll
find that the number of dTon remains the same.

The model A drive is 10dTon and provides Jump 2 for a 100dTon ship.
On all later systems, the drive volume would be around 3dTon.

So the price ends up the same.

Figure that the book 2 drives were designed to be built by TL9 industry.
(The design is TL11 to get Jump 2 but presumably the TL15 3I figured a
way to manufacture the device at TL9).
The consequence of this is that the device is much bigger than necessary
at TL11+ but can be built and maintained at all those TL9 and 10 starport \'A\'s

I request for FFS3:

Since the policy of using high tech design to allow the construction of
devices at TLs that is not sufficient to design them, at a significant
size penalty, is enshired in LBB canon: could we have rules for this?

Presumably you offset higher TL architect\'s fees against lower TL production.

I am perfectly willing to believe that your knowledge of the squishier
subject is adequate for Solomani charecters but is your knowledge really
adequate in the case of non human, or non Solomani, charecters?  If so I
think you could nake some money talking to some people at The Weekly
World News....

For instance the Darmine minor human race, as designed by me, have quite
high sexual drives.  However I have never mentioned the fact that the
reason the Darmine are so promiscuous is that the Ancients made them
that way.  The Darmine homeworld has a very high metal content and the
Ancients were somewhat annoyed when their protohuman servants kept dying
do to heavy metal poisoning.  So they put active measures [nanites,
genetic engineering, or both] into the Darmine which attack and destroy
foreign bodies (especially heavy metals).  However the Ancients soon
discovered that this included Sperm and embryos.  Therefore the Darmine
had a very low fertility rate.  Rather than fix this problem by
modifying the protective measures to not seek out reproductive materials
the (rather sloppy) technician in charge merely increased the libido of
the Darmine.  By engaging in sexual congress with about ten or fifteen
times the frequency that members of most other human races do the
Darmine have achieved a reproductive rate almost as good as that of most
other versions of humanity.  Furthermore the active protective measures
in the Darmines cells have an ability to learn.  Therefore Darmine women
are much less likely to be able to have a second child from the same
Darmine man.  This has resulted in the Darmine culture being poly with
group marriages the rule.  The high libido has also resulted in
bisexuality being the prevalant sexual Darmine sexual orientation as few
Darmine are willing to pass up sex based on details such as their
partners gender.

The typical Darmine will not even know who their genetic father was and
in fact will be _quite_ insulted [IE a Determination check not to be
upset or even flip out] if anyone asks because this obviously (to a
Darmine) implies that 1) Their mother was so inadequate that she had
sexual relations with one male partner during the period the charecter
was conceived 2) The Darmine is some kind of pervert who would, for some
strange reason, want to know who their father was enough to have a
genetic test done or 3) The charecter is so sickly that they needed to
know for medical reasons.

[The Darmine incest taboo is based on whom the charecter grew up with
and their maternal relatives rather than who their unknown paternal
relatives.  Fortunately the Darmine gene pool is fairly small,
homogeneous, and with very few bad traits in it so this does not cause
reproductive problems if Darmine happen to mate with a paternal
relative.]

As a result it is fairly rare for Darmine Imperial Nobles to inherit
their titles patrilineally.  Male Darmine Imperial Nobles may designate
a heir to their titles.

I do not see how I could present some of these cultural details without
talking about sex.  Marc Miller would (apparently) prefer not to discuss
them.  It is his decision and I fully understand his reasons.  This does
not however mean that the rest of us can not discuss it.

The CT writeups of the Hiver, the Aslan and (to a lesser extent) the
K\'Kree include discussions of the reproductive roles, and gender roles
of these races.  These writeups do not however contain prurient or
risque bits.  It is not unreasonable to expect future Traveller writers
to be able to do similar writups for future races.

Maybe this is realistic.  With skill 1 and charecteristic 1 it is
arguable that the only way this charecter _can_ hit is blind luck. 
Therefore all their hits will be spectacular sucess\'s.

One slight problem. Human reproduction doesn\'t quite work that way. Firstly 
the females will still be releasing only one egg per cycle and no amount of 
extra bonking is going aid in its survival against the nanitites etc. Secondly 
(and far more importantly), this will actually _decrease_ male fertility! After 
ejaculation, the male sperm count takes some time (days) to build back up. 
Now you have the Darmine having intercourse several times a day (10-15 times 
the "norm") and this will dramatically lower male sperm counts leading to a 
major _drop_ in fertility.

If you wish the Darmine to have a far higher libido, just make it a biochemical 
sideaffect of the protective measures that the Ancients never saw fit to correct 
(hey, so these humans are at it like rabbits, not a problem for the Ancients to 
worry about). The extra sexual activity should make up for the drop in fertility it 
causes.

In ACQ we point out that the damage effects against STR, DEX and END can be
seen as the effects of tissue damage and blood loss.  STR loss might be
seen as damage that prevents you from fully using your body, such as broken
bones or muscle tears.  DEX loss could refer to the fuzziness felt by
wounded people, blood loss, or actual damage to the extremities.  END loss
is mostly blood loss.  So you can get pretty descriptive without resorting
to Rolemasterish tables.

The protective measures will destroy many fertilized eggs before they
can implant in the ovarioan walls.  They may also destroy sperm before
they reach the egg or may even destoy the egg itself before fertiliztion
(the egg only has half the womans DNA and is therefore "foreign").  Once
they implant the measures should recognize it as part of the womans
body.  Therefore fewer egg/sperm unions will result in pregnancy. 
Therefore in order to ensure an adequate number of children their need
to be more opportunities for each egg released to have a chance to be
fertalized. That means more sex.  For the Darmine the big question is if
implantation will occur in the first place.

To put it in game mechanics terms I would say that (in a situation where
another woman would conceive) a Darmine woman needs to crit fail a End
(HT in GTrav) to represent the nanites not destroying the sperm, the
egg, or both.

Possibly I should drop this to five times the norm or (less pruriently)
just note that they have a very high sex drive.

> to a major _drop_ in fertility.

Well my understanding of Solomani reprodution was that the female was
sometimes fertilized with sperm that were many hours old.  The body of a
Darmine woman would (probably) already have eliminated these foreign
bodies.  Therefore in order to be impregnated she would need to have had
sex closer to the time of ovulation.  I am assuming that (with the TL 0
they had after the final war) the Darmine could not tell when their
women were fertile (I know some low tech cultures had some semi reliable
rules of thumb but I am assuming the Darmine did not).  Therefore in
order to ensure pregnancy the female would need to have had sex more
recently.

The fact that Darmine men might be releasing fewer sperm each time is
not the relevant factor for Darmine, the important factor is that the
sperm would be _fresher_.  I should also note that Darmine are
theoretically fertile with nonDarmine but that a DArmine/non Darmine
mating is even less likely to be fertile than a Darmine/Darmine mating
and that the mother needs to be Darmine (or the baby must be gestated in
an artificial womb) or the fetus will not not be able to survive.

It could also be unrelated, have evolved since then, be caused by the
founder effect, or something similar. Possibly but I am kind of attached
to the notion that these facts are interrelated.  When I was first
developing the Darmine the notion that they had strong defenses against
foreign bodies (especially heavy metals) and that they had strong
libidos were unrelated.  However this year it occured to me that there
was a way to tie these itmes together.  It made the Darmine (INHO) seem
a bit more real, and a bit more controlled by their biology.

However I am by no means a medical expert and would appreciate any
comentary from those who have said medical knowledge. If said comments
were from a naturally perverse source (Hi Kenji) all the better.  I have
no interest in creating bits of detail that are obviously false to those
knowledgable in the field.

This could probably be trimmed by 15 MW or so, if this was compensated for
by the battery pack below.

In jump space you will need 50.2 MW for the jump-drive, 3.5 MW for 1G of
compensation, 0.5 MW for the Computers, 0.5 MW for life support and call it
0.5 MW for the rest. Thats 55.7 MW demand. Call it 60 MW.

Remember that every megawatt of surplus power plant capability adds MCr 0.1
to the sticker cost.

Trimming power output to 63 MW should reduce the size of the power plant by
7.5 m3, the mass of the ship by 30t and the cost of the ship by MCr 1.5.

We now spend this 7.5 m3 on a 3000 kN thruster plate unit, which results in
a net mass reduction of 15t, and a net cost increase of MCr 0.35 ... but we
have the capability to go anywhere in-system at about one third of a gee
(using the t-plates costs 7.5 MW at full bore). <ooops, this is illegal,
but I add another 1000 kN of t-plates later>.

Now, the Heplar drive uses 10.5 m3 of h-fuel per hour, so if we cut the
Heplar down to 14 hours we get another 21 m3 and 1.5t to play with.

I\'d really like a version with type IV long-duration life support, to allow
for long-term independant operations. This would cost 11.2 m3, 11.2 t,
about 0.3 MW and about MCr 0.6 extra.

We could take this down to one gee - it isnt as if the Scout will be
accelerating that fast. This will save 4.2 m3, about 0.1 t and about MCr 0.2.

The galley is a nice touch, but I think the crew may have preferred a

Add a SanFac for 3.5 m3, 0.05t and negligible cost.

If we take this down to 2 dtons, we can put in 2 dtons of TL12 batteries.
This will allow us 42 MW of extra power for one hour - enough to move and
shoot, for a while at least. This will increase mass by about 56t, though,
and cost MCr 0.14.

OK, lets net this out ... plus battery pack, toilet, type IV life support,
t-plate unit. Minus smaller power plant, smaller HFuel reserve, only one
gee compensation, only 2dton of carried craft.

We have 11.5 m3 of extra space, but are 52.7t more massive, and we cost MCr
0.89 more.

OK, lets add another 1000 kN of t-plates, for an extra KCr 625 and an extra
5t.

The 9m3 is left spare as build room (i.e. for the mil-spec sensors we left
out).

Net unit (plus the extra t-plate unit) costs MCr 31.525 and masses 1030t
loaded.

It has whole-system capability at 0.4 gees, plus 14 hours of Heplar boost
to take you up to one point four gees. In normal space operations, it uses
about 55 MW, so you only really need the battery pack if you intend to be
laser armed. 

Ditzie is telling me to double the size of that Heplar unit, so it can pull
two and a half gees, but I dont want to cope with the maths.

Puuuut the gun down Ditzie ... sloooooowly. I\'m your *friend* remember ...

Use 6 m3 of build room. Mass goes up 6t. Cost goes up MCr 0.06. We get
another 12 000 kN of thrust, using another 15 m3 of HFuel per hour and
another 60 MW of power at full bore.

Total thrust from Heplar is therefore 20 400 kN, or a straight 2 gees. The
HFuel will hold out for ... ummm 147 m3 HFuel in total ... 20 400 kN uses
25.5 m3 an hour ... thats 5 hours 40 minutes. Full bore the Heplar uses 102
MW, so we run out of power a lot sooner than that.

Oh, and 140 m3 of that is enough to pull another jump-1, so you have the
option of using the HFuel to jump rather than run. Therefore, it is worth
keeping the HFuel reserve that big.

OK, the ship now costs MCr 31.6, masses 1036t and has 20400 kN from Heplar
and 4000 kN from thruster plates, and is brutally underpowered in combat.

On the other hand, it is cheap, and quite capable of long-term independant
operations.

If Ditzie wasnt looking particularily edgy, I\'d keep tweaking the Heplar
down to a total maximum thrust of 2 gees, but she is, so I wont.

Bye.

Unfortunately I was trying to keep to the Tech Level 9 limit, so the
compensation was 2G at TL 11 needing 9.8MW for 1G. If I had used 1G
compensation then it would be TL 10 and need 19.6MW.
If I admit defeat and use TL12 G-comp then you are correct.
Even so much of your power saving is available
(you could even run at 0.7G in Jump).

Given how the ship gets used in the game, your thrusters are
a reasonable addition to get the Type S we know and love.

You get it for no space or cost.
I already had one in the design but it did not appear on the report.

The post was by Marc in reference to something proposed (or planned) for T5.

Minor races (the magority at least) do not usually have the drive to expand
that characterise races that develope jump drive on there own or they
simply do not have the technical skills to develope it on there own. The
exceptions to this would be races contacted before they had the chance to
develope jump drive, and these would be the ones most upset about the
"minor" designation - they may be just as technically enclined as the best
Droyne technician.

Once the majority of minor races are contacted, long range travel is
something they may not desire, and they stay close to their home perhaps
due to cultural reasons (or whatever reason the author of that race
determines :) ).

Hello,
I am considering purchasing T4, mostly based on the positive
experience I had with Classic Traveller quite a few years ago in
college.  If I am to dive into Traveller again, I would like to
go with the current version (besides, I have no idea where my old
traveller stuff is).
**************
well the "Current Version" is GURPS Traveller... same setting as Classic
just a few years later. (set in 1120)



Is the game really as bad as this guy says it is?  If so, maybe I
should give up my plans on picking up the game again.  What do
you think?
****************
I thought so, I played through the 3 previous incarnations, but T4 was
terrible.  my advice.. go with GURPS Traveller (and remember unlike some
game publishers SJG actualy pays their authors)

Sam, we have good news, and we have bad news.

The good news is that much of T4 was very good.

The bad news, is that the bits that sucked, *really* sucked (do not, under
any circumstances, pay for Starships or First Survey).

However, you are on the net, and this mailing list, so we can help you.

If you want starship designs, check out the THUDDD archives (do a Lycos
search on THUDDD).

T5 will solve the \'Impossible is Easy\' problem by raising the difficulty
level by one, if you dont have as many skill levels as the difficulty level
(ie if you have skill 1, and it\'s a Hard task, then you roll 4 dice rather
than the 3 you would roll normally for a Hard skill). The other fix is to
make players roll their current stat or over to improve it in character
generation.

If you are a gearhead (someone who enjoys building the gadgets that make up
a technological universe), buy Fire Fusion and Steel.

If you like building a civilisation, get Pocket Empires.

I dont own Psionics Institutes, but people have said nice things about it.

Emperor\'s Arsenal was good for gun-heads, even if it didnt include Barbie\'s
Own Particle Pistol from Famile Spofulam.

In short, dive back in

Look, Marc Miller is a Responsible Game Designer.

One of the realities of the gaming \'industry\' is the fact that the Right
has a fair amount of clout, and it gets really uncomfortable about
sexuality, and especially about alternative sexualities.

Putting overt sexual material in Traveller is an easy way to cop unwanted
heat.

Of course, that is no reason the Sayat, or Samuel Delaney\'s s/m SF, or even
a post-pubescent Ditzammer Spofulam (1), or even something as sexually
loaded as, say, Dumas\' Three Musketeers (2) cant turn up in your campaign,
it\'s just that the political realities are that it cant be seen to be
officially supported.

And thats cool.

Marc cant stop the *rest* of us speculating on the effect of, say, bonking
in the main tunnel of a charged but not fired spinal particle accelerator.
With magnetically active bo-mo jewelry that is. Can a physicist advise me
how hot 1 gram of metal would get 10 m from a 10 * 10^8 Tesla field when
moved at 1 m/s ?

Jump club. Feh :)

The \'someone\' in question was Marc, discussing the Minor race generation
system draft from T5.

You\'re confusing two definitions of \'Minor Race\' here. In-game,
politically, Minor Race means \'didn\'t discover Jump Drive on it\'s own\';
here the term is used in-rules, meaning, truly, a minor race, with few
members and limited distribution. Note the word _mostly_.

Bwaps, for instance, are a "minor race\' but clearly they\'ve expanded far
beyond their original world. However, worlds with a _majority_ Bwap
population, I\'ll wager, are still within 10 parsecs of the Bwap home world.

Many of the Minor races showing up seem to be of the native sophont
category, perhaps found only on a single world, except for a few
exceptional members. Cf. Ael Yael...the vast majority of them only live
on their home world, and the few that are out Travelling feel a great
responsibility to represent all of them at home.

Having discussed the issue with previous publishers of Traveller (Ken
Whitman, specifically), I believe that we are getting rather out of hand.

Marc\'s opinion of the matter is simply that sex, or implications of sexual
content, should not be used to promote sales of a product or increase a
product\'s market appeal.

The supplements and adventures referred to do in fact describe sexual
behaviors of characters and aliens, as you indicate, and I firmly believe
that such content, where applicable, is in no way objectionable according
to Marc Miller.  In fact, I am willing to bet that some of those sections
were authored by him!

What is objectionable is selling games based on the cover art.  I have the
full set of "Macho Women with Guns" and, let me tell you, it wasn\'t the
rule system that made me pick it up, although it was the satirical nature
and absolute hilarity of the game that made me buy it.

Marc\'s opinion, which I respect (regardless of my own opinion on the
subject), is that such tactics are neither necessary nor appropriate for a
game with his name on it.  He is selling game content, not sex, and does
not wish any mistake to be made on that account.  It shows a significant
strength of character to take this stand over the objections of editors and
the success of games like Cyberpunk and others which do use such tactics.

Some versions of the rules try to sidestep this by claiming that family
members of nobility that don\'t have titles in their own right also get
similar Social Standing.  In that case, Norris could have been Social-F
while his father and brother were alive, even if he wasn\'t a duke of
anything.  I\'ve found that it\'s hard to talk players into going along
with this idea, even though it\'s got a lot of possibilities.  :)

On the other hand, there should be plenty of Soc-B and Soc-C people who
are locally important but not Imperial nobles; the "native" leaders in 
NOMADS OF THE WORLD-OCEAN come to mind.

Hey Marc,
ths is exectly what i always wanted to see for Traveller: Rule light,
background heavy
sourcebooks. Using this approach you can even sell the books to the
Gurps-Crowd as they
can use these books with their systems as well. It increases the sales
potential of the 
single books. Just look at the SJG-way. I have never played a single
session of Gurps, 
but own about 10 sourcebooks, as i can use them in my other games as well,
and they 
are fun to read.
This is truly a good thing and the right way to go for Traveller.

I see. So you *aren\'t* proposing a White Wolf-style format of 5-8 different
settings, each with it\'s own main rulesbook (containing the same system and
chargen rules)? Just a main rules book with a setting, and then setting
books which can be used to customize the main book?

Built on a type of hull reminiscent of the old Kinunir class Colonial
Cruisers.
Affectionately called the "Ironsides", these ships are practically immune
to laser fire. This ship can ignore any hit from any turret laser, close
in on the target, and let fly up to 50 standard missiles in one salvo.
Space is available for 77 reloads for each missile rack. Missiles from
other ships are still a threat, so 2 triple laser turrets are available to
provide point defense.  These ships were designed to provide escort and
extra firepower to a destroyer, or added stopping power to any piracy
suppression.  Rumor has it that the IN routinely uses these ships in large
flotillas claiming they are armed with nuclear weapons as a "deterrent to
dissension" on lower tech worlds.  Indeed a low tech world would be
devastated by an attack from a fleet of these missile carriers.

that didn\'t quite settle well with me, and so I propose a few 
solutions of my own that settle my scientific nature while still 
keeping the race as it was intended.

Originally, the Darmine were taken to a world rich in heavy metals, 
which were causing poisoning within the Darmine settlement.  Many of 
the original "subjects" died due to the sharp increase.  In seeking a 
solution to the problem, the Ancients geneered the Darmine to be 
resistant.  (I prefer this to nanites; otherwise, nanites could be 
extracted from Darmine blood and tissue, and that would make them 
hunted and possibly extinct.)  Part of the biological process either 
lessened the fertility of the female or of both sexes), resulting 
in a drastic drop in reproductive capacity.  This is due to the 
inhibition of the release of certain sexually-related hormones, such 
as estrogen and/or testosterone.  (The thought of a hyper-developed 
immune system attacking other\'s genetic materials, resulting in 
rejection or destruction of the incoming sperm, has its place.  
However, it also results in several allergic responses, ranging from 
burning sensations through skin lesions (sp?) to (in the case of 
other severe allergic reactions, potentially applicable in the 
scenario described before) shock, coma and possibly death.  These 
reactions do not lend themselves to a sexually active culture, but 
rather a stoic culture where sex is only performed ritually for the 
continuation of the species, and the experience is feared, painful, 
and certainly never enjoyed.)

To counter the lowered productivity rate, the Ancients instituted a 
sexual regimen among their Darmine "subjects", with the purpose of 
increasing chances of exposure for fertility.  To further increase 
the chances for genetic viability, the regimen required the 
alteration of sexual partners.  This regimen functioned, and became 
part of the Darmine pattern of existence.  When the Ancients were 
destroyed in the Final War, the Darmine carried the practice forward 
as part of their culture, similar to the Vilani food tenders (I 
forgot the priesthood\'s name for the moment).  To do otherwise would 
result in the extinction of the species.

This reasoning also explains why the Darmine have fertility problems 
with inter-species relations, as well.  If the female cannot be made 
pregnant easily, then no human can do so readily, Darmine or 
otherwise.  An interesting aside is the effect on the Darmines\' 
appearance.  Darmine women would tend to look under-developed or 
only moderately endowed next to, say, Dolly Pardon, as their 
secondary sexual characteristics would not be as developed.  In 
addition, the males would tend to look androgenous, with some slight 
feminine appearance to their features, due to the reduced amounts of 
testosterone during their sexual development.  Both sexes would tend 
to look younger than their true age after puberty.

Of course, their appearance and their culture make the Darmine 
excellent targets for a slavery ring catering to interstellar 
pedophilic humanophiles.  (Adventure idea...)

  I d have to agree on both counts. T4 had a workable basic idea, but
apart from that, the line was a massive botch. (T4 _did_ have some
mariginally useful material, but as a whole it just fails to hold
together.)
  GURPS Traveller on the other hand does a wonderful job of preserving the
Classic Traveller look and feel. If you can live with the GURPS rules
system (I like it, have used it with 2300AD and Traveller quite a while)
and liked CT, you\'re almost guaranteed to like this one.

If a race is Minor, it wouldn\'tve spread out much.  That\'s not to say that a 
member of a Minor Race couldn\'t be found everywhere, it\'s just 99% likely 
it\'ll be found within 10 parsecs of its homeworld.

Two cases come to mind:  the Ilthara & the Virushi.  The Ilthara got Jump drive from a Reaver warlord and took over a bit more than a subsector in Reavers\' Deep within 50 years.  Eventually, they got knocked back to the Stone Age by the Imperium in 268 when they became too much of a pain in the ass for their interstellar neighbors to want to deal with.

The Virushi are pastoral herbivores.  Their entire culture is so laid back, it makes the California surfer culture look intense.  But a Virushi was named to Strephon\'s staff as a surgeon, and they do get around a bit.

A lot of it is pure numbers, methinks.  If your Minor Race only has a million members, that means only 10,000 thereabouts are going to be run into over 10 parsecs away.  And Minor Races tend to not be as populous as Majors because they have no room to reproduce as much.

 The Empress Wave appears to be a rather powerful (apparently isotropic)
wavefront of coherent EM radiation (probably in the microwave regime near
the frequency of CMB, just my opinion as an astronomer) acting in some
strange way as a carrier for a psionic signal. Both Strephon and the
Longbow relay telepath described the recieved psionic image as "human
female, dressed in black, standing before a city skyline" (Regency
Sourcebook p.83) Both Strephon and the telepath also described a feeling
of something momentuos just about to happen.
 Nobody knows what the EW is (it appears to enamate from the galactic
core) but the EM wavefront itself appears to be fairly harmless. However,
at least in the TNE Regency campaign, the psionic signal piggybacking the
wave seems to be responsible for a major brekdown of social order within
the Zhodani Consulate.

 Almost certainly, yes.

I\'m trying to work up a Minor for my PBEM, the Mar\'Cha.  I can\'t figure out how to do Castes or figure out if a Caste is gender related or not.  The tables seem ok, I guess, just the instructions on them need to be a bit clearer.

The was nothing in there that is not consumable by all. You can talk about
sex. You can\'t be graphic about the sex is how I read cadveat #5. I 
believe personally that Marc doesn\'t want the Mature Audenices Only
"Sticker on the books. Which if I can say one more time is a good Idea. Sex
should never be a theme of a book or adventure. if it was it wouldn\'t be
sci fi and whould be liesure suit larry in outer space. As a hook eg
escapeing a boyfriend or lover or explaining reporductive behavoir in a
race... It is ok and legal. But it seems to me that he doesn\'t want to read
about the adventure when Debbie does Deneb.

Yep responsible for writing games that most of us will never play but buy

===========
One of the realities of LIFE is that there are different levels of
maturity in your audience.  It is not political pressure, but
perception of taste, to which game designers design.  If Marc wants
his games to preserve the perception of "good" taste that they have
consistantly maintained, that is entirely his choice.  I think that
the success of SJG is proof enough that there is ample market for
games with varying levels of gratuitous [insert your favorite here]. 
I haven\'t seen any demonstrators marching on the sidewalks in front of
even one hobby or comics store.  Not even in Va. Beach, Pat
Robertson\'s back yard.  Or here in puritanical New England.  I doubt
that the "Right" would waste their "clout" by waging a holy war
against a foppish character in a T:TNE adventure.  Or a reference to
naked beam dancers on Ruie.  Or even a lesbian Aslan, as much as the
very idea is a slap in the face to C.S.Lewis.  The fact that the
published Traveller material has maintained (IMO) a tasteful balance,
where many have not, keeps me coming back.

The Geonee are considered minor because they "cheated" by using Ancients
relics, aren\'t they?  Presumably there\'s an ideological reason too - they
were the first other "major" race the Vilani ran into, and probably scared
the hell out of them.  As a result orthodox Vilani scholars tended to
downplay their achievements, blah blah blah.

I suspect the Droyne\'s status is contested.  The whole major/minor thing is
deeply political, complete with bucketloads of racist connotations.  The
Droyne aren\'t currently important, therefore they are minor...

you could get by with 6 engineers here, but an extra one makes for good
redundancy.

Overall, a nice design. a little weak on defense...the eggshells with
hammer theory of design I see.

one thing, it does not seem to be usefule for escort duty, so perhaps
calling it somthing other than DE would be good.  perhaps a strike frigate
(FFS)?

I am working up some alternate rules for escorting...I would like for ships
to be able to shoot down missiles coming at the other ship in point
defense....

 a -2 to piloting for all ships involved in a formation,

I am very pleased to see this for the following reasons; first, I do think
the TNE setting had some basically good ideas and oppurtunities for
adventure. Secondly, it shows that the events are still part of the
official Canon (even though some will undoubtably continue to be in denial
about this), and thirdly it shows that the players of TNE are not being
abandoned totally.

However, I do feel that the \'canon\' needs adjustment where TNE is
concerned, in the following areas.

1.) The Collapse is not long enough. 70 years is not enough time, IMO, for
the changes that were portrayed as taking place, the rampant technophobia
could be explained, but the worlds where the Imperium is all but forgotten,
religions have developed around technology etc. just do not make sense to
me in a 70 year time frame. I think a "Short Nap" of say 200-300 years
would be more appropriate.

2.) Contrary to it\'s name and previous portrayal, it should be established
that "Virus" is not really a computer virus. It\'s a sentient form of
electronic life which lives in silicon and computer chips, and can travel
between them, rewrite circuitry, etc. Perhaps people can accept it better
as "life, but not as we know it" than as sentient software.

3.) Either allow the ships of the Reformation Coalition to use thruster
plates, or establish a plausible reason why they cannot make them. perhaps
t-plates require a special element that the Old Expanses sector happens to
be very poor in, so they use HEPLar in newer ships and only have t-plates
in relics. This gives incentive to salvage old Imperial ships, allows the
use of HEPLar, which is interesting from a tactical standpoint, without
"de-canonizing" thruster plates. It also, frankly, establishes a clear
technological superiority for the Regency :)

I hope consideration would be given to contacting Dave Nilsen about this;
as he was one of the people who came up with the TNE idea, he seems like a
good choice to write such a book when the time comes.

I wasn\'t thinking of things like that.  But minor mutations that are already
present in humaniti that might become more prevalent with a long-term
exposure to non-standard planets.  After all, we\'re only talking about a period

of 3000 years - not a lot in evolutionary time (unless you wan\'t to talk about
seeded humaniti groups).  Also, there\'s might be some \'garbage\' when Vilani
and Solomani mix after so much separation.

Like I said, I\'m thinking of minor ones that would impact game-play in only
minor
ways.  Like the tendency of Syleans to albinism, and Darmine green-hair.
In the Real World (tm), we have such things as the Mexican \'wolf\' boys, who
are totally covered in a thick-fur, but are otherwise normal, the cold-water
swimmer who has radically adapted her body to tolerances beyond human norm.

A short list of things I\'m thinking of:

hair (both type and quantity),

oxygen-capacity (effects endurance),

gravity effects (would affect not only strength and height/weight, but
conceiveably dexterity as well),

melanin production (not just normal skin color but effect of radiation,
i.e., tanning might be a different color)

diet,

body fat/energy storage (just thinking out loud here: water worlds might
have populations that retain their internal heat better for survival when
in the water, or layers of fat or for buoyancy; cold worlds promote fat
retention for body warmth).

Earlier, I mentioned vision and hearing changes, but after thinking
about it, it doesn\'t make any sense for these to change in any
appreciable way.

None of these type of changes need to effect game play at all.
But, IMHO, they would add some flavor, especially to the ubiquitous
starport bar brawl.

Example:
GM: Ok, you\'ve entered the Lone Star in Star Town and sit at the only
open table, which is between a table of very-hairy faced men in starship
flight suits on one side and a table of deeply tanned men with webbed hands
on the other.
    As the waitron approaches your table, you hear one of the
tanned men say: "I think someone in here needs a shave."
   "Go jump in a frozen lake, fishboy."
   "Hey, I think I hear a Vargr yelping?"
The waitron says:  "Oh don\'t mind them, the [insert name of water world here]
and the [insert name of home world for very hairy men here] are always yelling
like that but they\'re not violent. What\'ll it be?"

So was "virus" wiped out?  Does that mean that there was genocide [or

You know, I\'m sure that Marc, writing email from his Barbados Mansion,

a game where the content is more important than the art (oops, T4 aside -
but that was the publisher\'s fault, not the writers\').

[Who is this guy?]  Yeah...the plot in playboy is really game-adaptable eh?
Just the other day there was a character who answered "I want to be a
Veterinarian because I love children.", just like Miss November in her bio.

The question is not what you should beat your meat with, but whether and
how sex belongs in the Gaming Session.  Ian\'s point is that, although there
may not be explicit rules for sex in the rulebook (I can\'t believe I\'m even
suggesting there might be!) you can find and play all the sexually explicit
campaigns you wish in the privacy of your own game room.

How unimaginative.  You are a Role Playing Gamer aren\'t you?  Perhaps you

ago, named Shiela-X.  Sex was completely inextricable from that campaign,
as it is from my current one, thanks to Yatshana and her \'not

Subject: Darmine Reproduction...

*SNIP*
Originally, the Darmine were taken to a world rich in heavy metals,
which were causing poisoning within the Darmine settlement.  Many of
the original "subjects" died due to the sharp increase.  In seeking a
solution to the problem, the Ancients geneered the Darmine to be
resistant.  (I prefer this to nanites; otherwise, nanites could be
extracted from Darmine blood and tissue, and that would make them
hunted and possibly extinct.)
******************
     I like and agree with this, kind of reminds one of the Grayland people
from the \'Honor Harrington\' series by D. Webber.



 Part of the biological process either lessened the fertility of the female
or of both sexes), resulting in a drastic drop in reproductive capacity.
This is due to the inhibition of the release of certain sexually-related
hormones, such as estrogen and/or testosterone.  (The thought of a
hyper-developed immune system attacking other\'s genetic materials,
resulting in rejection or destruction of the incoming sperm, has its place.
However, it also results in several allergic responses, ranging from
burning sensations through skin lesions (sp?) to (in the case of
other severe allergic reactions, potentially applicable in the
scenario described before) shock, coma and possibly death.  These
reactions do not lend themselves to a sexually active culture, but
rather a stoic culture where sex is only performed ritually for the
continuation of the species, and the experience is feared, painful,
and certainly never enjoyed.)
*********************
     Wrong you are bucko.  There are several ways this could be a reality
without any of the problems you have noted.  My Aunt and Uncle have opposed
blood types, so that when she becomes pregnant the doctors need to monitor
the whole pregnancy and give her special medication to keep her immune
system from aborting the baby.  If the dosage is wrong or they don\'t give
her a shot when they should her system rejects the baby because of the
blood type problems.



To counter the lowered productivity rate, the Ancients instituted a
sexual regimen among their Darmine "subjects", with the purpose of
increasing chances of exposure for fertility.  To further increase
the chances for genetic viability, the regimen required the
alteration of sexual partners.  This regimen functioned, and became
part of the Darmine pattern of existence.  When the Ancients were
destroyed in the Final War, the Darmine carried the practice forward
as part of their culture, similar to the Vilani food tenders (I
forgot the priesthood\'s name for the moment).  To do otherwise would
result in the extinction of the species.

This reasoning also explains why the Darmine have fertility problems
with inter-species relations, as well.  If the female cannot be made
pregnant easily, then no human can do so readily, Darmine or
otherwise.  An interesting aside is the effect on the Darmines\'
appearance.  Darmine women would tend to look under-developed or
only moderately endowed next to, say, Dolly Pardon, as their
secondary sexual characteristics would not be as developed.  In
addition, the males would tend to look androgenous, with some slight
feminine appearance to their features, due to the reduced amounts of
testosterone during their sexual development.  Both sexes would tend
to look younger than their true age after puberty.

Of course, their appearance and their culture make the Darmine
excellent targets for a slavery ring catering to interstellar
pedophilic humanophiles.  (Adventure idea...)

     Other than the noted objections I like what you have written alot.
What is the average tech level of the Darmine worlds?  If it is say below
TL-7 that could explain why they still have a birthrate problem.  Any
culture with advanced medical facilities (say TL-12+) could easily assist a
couple, either one or both of whom was Darmine, to concieve anytime they
wanted to.  Lets hear it for advanced medical treatments.

I am perfectly willing to believe that your knowledge of the squishier
subject is adequate for Solomani charecters but is your knowledge really
adequate in the case of non human, or non Solomani, charecters?  If so I
think you could nake some money talking to some people at The Weekly
World News....

For instance the Darmine minor human race, as designed by me, have quite
high sexual drives.  However I have never mentioned the fact that the
reason the Darmine are so promiscuous is that the Ancients made them
that way.  The Darmine homeworld has a very high metal content and the
Ancients were somewhat annoyed when their protohuman servants kept dying
do to heavy metal poisoning.  So they put active measures [nanites,
genetic engineering, or both] into the Darmine which attack and destroy
foreign bodies (especially heavy metals).  However the Ancients soon
discovered that this included Sperm and embryos.  Therefore the Darmine
had a very low fertility rate.  Rather than fix this problem by
modifying the protective measures to not seek out reproductive materials
the (rather sloppy) technician in charge merely increased the libido of
the Darmine.  By engaging in sexual congress with about ten or fifteen
times the frequency that members of most other human races do the
Darmine have achieved a reproductive rate almost as good as that of most
other versions of humanity.  Furthermore the active protective measures
in the Darmines cells have an ability to learn.  Therefore Darmine women
are much less likely to be able to have a second child from the same
Darmine man.  This has resulted in the Darmine culture being poly with
group marriages the rule.  The high libido has also resulted in
bisexuality being the prevalant sexual Darmine sexual orientation as few
Darmine are willing to pass up sex based on details such as their
partners gender.

The typical Darmine will not even know who their genetic father was and
in fact will be _quite_ insulted [IE a Determination check not to be
upset or even flip out] if anyone asks because this obviously (to a
Darmine) implies that 1) Their mother was so inadequate that she had
sexual relations with one male partner during the period the charecter
was conceived 2) The Darmine is some kind of pervert who would, for some
strange reason, want to know who their father was enough to have a
genetic test done or 3) The charecter is so sickly that they needed to
know for medical reasons.

[The Darmine incest taboo is based on whom the charecter grew up with
and their maternal relatives rather than who their unknown paternal
relatives.  Fortunately the Darmine gene pool is fairly small,
homogeneous, and with very few bad traits in it so this does not cause
reproductive problems if Darmine happen to mate with a paternal
relative.]

As a result it is fairly rare for Darmine Imperial Nobles to inherit
their titles patrilineally.  Male Darmine Imperial Nobles may designate
a heir to their titles.

I do not see how I could present some of these cultural details without
talking about sex.  Marc Miller would (apparently) prefer not to discuss
them.  It is his decision and I fully understand his reasons.  This does
not however mean that the rest of us can not discuss it.

The CT writeups of the Hiver, the Aslan and (to a lesser extent) the
K\'Kree include discussions of the reproductive roles, and gender roles
of these races.  These writeups do not however contain prurient or
risque bits.  It is not unreasonable to expect future Traveller writers
to be able to do similar writups for future races.

think you could nake some money talking to some people at The Weekly
World News....

For instance the Darmine minor human race, as designed by me, have quite
high sexual drives.  However I have never mentioned the fact that the
reason the Darmine are so promiscuous is that the Ancients made them
that way.  The Darmine homeworld has a very high metal content and the
Ancients were somewhat annoyed when their protohuman servants kept dying
do to heavy metal poisoning.  So they put active measures [nanites,
genetic engineering, or both] into the Darmine which attack and destroy
foreign bodies (especially heavy metals).  However the Ancients soon
discovered that this included Sperm and embryos.  Therefore the Darmine
had a very low fertility rate.  Rather than fix this problem by
modifying the protective measures to not seek out reproductive materials
the (rather sloppy) technician in charge merely increased the libido of
the Darmine.  By engaging in sexual congress with about ten or fifteen
times the frequency that members of most other human races do the
Darmine have achieved a reproductive rate almost as good as that of most
other versions of humanity.  Furthermore the active protective measures
in the Darmines cells have an ability to learn.  Therefore Darmine women
are much less likely to be able to have a second child from the same
Darmine man.  This has resulted in the Darmine culture being poly with
group marriages the rule.  The high libido has also resulted in
bisexuality being the prevalant sexual Darmine sexual orientation as few
Darmine are willing to pass up sex based on details such as their
partners gender.

The typical Darmine will not even know who their genetic father was and
in fact will be _quite_ insulted [IE a Determination check not to be
upset or even flip out] if anyone asks because this obviously (to a
Darmine) implies that 1) Their mother was so inadequate that she had
sexual relations with one male partner during the period the charecter
was conceived 2) The Darmine is some kind of pervert who would, for some
strange reason, want to know who their father was enough to have a
genetic test done or 3) The charecter is so sickly that they needed to
know for medical reasons.

[The Darmine incest taboo is based on whom the charecter grew up with
and their maternal relatives rather than who their unknown paternal
relatives.  Fortunately the Darmine gene pool is fairly small,
homogeneous, and with very few bad traits in it so this does not cause
reproductive problems if Darmine happen to mate with a paternal
relative.]

As a result it is fairly rare for Darmine Imperial Nobles to inherit
their titles patrilineally.  Male Darmine Imperial Nobles may designate
a heir to their titles.

I do not see how I could present some of these cultural details without
talking about sex.  Marc Miller would (apparently) prefer not to discuss
them.  It is his decision and I fully understand his reasons.  This does
not however mean that the rest of us can not discuss it.

The CT writeups of the Hiver, the Aslan and (to a lesser extent) the
K\'Kree include discussions of the reproductive roles, and gender roles
of these races.  These writeups do not however contain prurient or
risque bits.  It is not unreasonable to expect future Traveller writers
to be able to do similar writups for future races.

Well, Rob, unsuprisingly I was using QSDS : The Software (TM), as written
by the excellent Rob Prior and available through BITS in Europe and from
Rob directly in North America. But I guess you knew that ;-)


Problem is, QSDS is so simple it took all of 5 minutes to design a ship,

IMTU the stewards are responsible for the commercial success of a ship,
like the cargomaster in Andre Norton\'s Sci-Fi. They negotiate and buy cargo
too, plus they handle it.

ISTR that Marc was considering broadening the steward skill in T5 to
include this. It gives them something else to do.

Sam - the T4 rules are badly laid out but good. I would recommend getting a
copy, plus the errata. As you have internet access, also go to the Missouri
Archive that Joe Heck runs and download RPSCSv0.9 (Roleplaying Starship
Combat System) and QSDSv1.5. (The corrected simple ship construction rules).
The email FarFuture@aol.com and ask if you can have a draft of the playtest
for T4.1 / T5. This has a bugfixed task system. Alternatively, you could
just run it a level higher.

I\'d give the rules a C.

The following are worth considering -

M0 Campaign (Hardback) -  Sourcebook, 32 extra pages of background and
adventures over First Survey and Milieu 0. A

FFS2 B with the errata if you like build ships and weapons, else E.

Central Supply Catalogue - B

Emperors Arsenal B

M0(softback) B

First Survey E

Pocket Empires A-

Psionic Institutes A

Naval Architect\'s Manual B-

Imperial Squadrons B

Missions of State C- (without Joe Walsh and Martin Dougherty\'s work it\'d be
a D)

The Annililik Run U  (worst ever Traveller supplement)

TLWH (BITS) C+

Starships C (only because SSDS is in it and it makes a good mousemat)

Hope this helps.

Allegedly Emperor\'s Arsenal is poor (no TLs for example). Anomalies has a
few technical quirks

	This is a very good point...if you, as a GM or player, desire a sexually-

by any means require Mr. Miller to publish any sexually explicit works.  It\'s
his system until you plop down the cash for it...after that you can do what

(The thought of a hyper-developed immune system attacking other\'s

lesions (sp?) to (in the case of other severe allergic reactions, 
potentially applicable in the scenario described before) shock, coma 
and possibly death.  These reactions do not lend themselves to a 
sexually active culture, but rather a stoic culture where sex is only 
performed ritually for the continuation of the species, and the 
experience is feared, painful, and certainly never enjoyed.) 

Leo Hale wrote:
*********************   
Wrong you are bucko.  There are several ways this could be a     
reality without any of the problems you have noted.  My Aunt and 
Uncle have opposed blood types, so that when she becomes pregnant the 
doctors need to monitor the whole pregnancy and give her special 
medication to keep her immune system from aborting the baby.  If the 
dosage is wrong or they don\'t give her a shot when they should her 
system rejects the baby because of the blood type problems.

My response:
The opposing Rh Factor problems that you have mentioned are due to 
the blood type of the child _after it has been conceived_, and the 
blood type of the mother.  This situation develops after a first 
child is conceived with Rh+ blood with a mother of Rh- blood, and the 
child is either born, or is aborted/miscarried after developing the 
Rh+ blood proteins.  In the evacuation of the fetus/newborn, any 
exposure to the child\'s blood proteins causes the mother to develop 
antibodies against it.  UNLESS the mother receives medication to 
suppress her body\'s immune response to form these antibodies.  These 
antibodies would then attach any subsequent children, like Leo\'s 
cousin, for example.  Nice thought, but this was not quite the point 
I was getting at.  Please allow me the opportunity to explain what I 
meant.

I have known women (yes, more than one) who are allergic to seminal 
fluid, resulting in burning sensations and occasional bleeding.  I 
have heard of cases of this where the woman develops hives, puss, 
inflammation, etc.  It is not pretty, and they are not comfortable.

I also know that people can have severe reactions to many different 
substances that leads to anaphylactic shock (spelling?).  The most 
well-known cases involve bee stings.  The body detects the presence 
of a foreign protein within itself, and sends antibodies to attack 
it.  The antibodies cause a response in the surrounding tissue, which 
causes blood flow to slow and tissue to swell, attempting to 
immobilize the protein so that the body can deal with it.  (I know 
this is oversimplified, but I just want to get the jist of it 
across.)  Sometimes this allergic response can lead to the swelling 
of the throat and larynx to the point that the body can\'t breathe 
sufficiently, and without medical treatment, the victim dies.  
Medication can suppress the body\'s allergic response, which is why 
the victim needs to receive medical attention as soon as possible.

ObTrav:  If the Ancients were to tune the Darmine\'s immune 
system to hyper-sensitive levels, such reactions as above become very 
possible, based on the genetic predispositions of the individuals.  
The Darmine has already been described as a small genetic group with 
limited amounts of genetic drift.  If one (or several) of the females 
among the original Darmine subject group possess even a mild 
irritation to seminal fluid, this would be exaggerated by the 
increase in the immune response.  The Ancients lose that one (or 
several) individuals to shock (or maybe save the subject in time, 
doesn\'t matter), and so decide to take another approach to settle the 
problem of heavy metal poisoning.

I think that is closer to what I meant.  My apologies if my previous
misrepresentation caused difficulties for anyone.  My thanks to Leo 
for assisting me in pointing this matter out to me.  I do hope, 
though,  that this helps develop the Darmine background at least a 
little bit.

Leo Hale wrote:
What is the average tech level of the Darmine worlds?  If it is say

 Any culture with advanced medical facilities (say TL-12+) could
easily assist a couple, either one or both of whom was Darmine, to
concieve anytime they wanted to.  Lets hear it for advanced medical
treatments.

=======================
Universal Traveller Universe Profile (UTUP) v2.0:

Developed as an extension of the Traveller-specific geek code 
commonly referred to as the IMTU code, the UTUP is very similar to 
the UPP and UWP profiles used in official Traveller products.

The format is very similar in appearance to the UPP, as follows:

Name (System Notes)  1234567
Aslan-1 Droyne-3 Timeline-2 etc.

Each UTUP characteristic corrolates to the UPP characteristic it
represents in some degree:

UPP strength => UTUP Rules Sets
UPP dexterity => UTUP Imperial Flexibility
UPP endurance => UTUP Gearheadedness 
UPP intelligence => UTUP Average TL
UPP education =>UTUP Timeline
UPP social standing => UTUP Canonicity

Each UTUP characteristic strives to keep the more radical or 
up-to-date values at the high end of the chart.  This system of 
organization is not intended to be disrespectful of anyone\'s 
Traveller Universe, but merely a means of detailing the system.

GAME SYSTEM NOTES:
In the place of the character\'s name in the UPP, the UTUP identifies
the person whose universe is being described.  (Alternately, the
campaign name could go here instead.)  In parentheses after the name,
the primary rules system used for the TU described can be identified. 
While this is mostly useful for non-standard systems, it also makes it
easier for someone to identify the rules set quickly.  This is
optional, as the information is clarified by the UTUP Rules
characteristic, below.

UTUP Rules Set:
This characteristic details the game system rules used in YTU.  The
actual code is as follows:

0   Classic Traveller primarily

1   MegaTraveller primarily

2   Traveller: The New Era primarily

3   T4: Milieu 0 primarily

4   GURPS:  Traveller primarily

5   Classic Traveller/heavy house rules modifications

6   MegaTraveller/ heavy house rules modifications

7   Traveller: The New Era/heavy house rules modifications

8   T4: Milieu 0/heavy house rules modifications

9   GURPS:  Traveller/heavy house rules modifications

A   Mix of various gaming systems

UTUP Imperial Flexibility:
This characteristic details the flexibility of the Imperium (or major
stellar government) in YTU.  Reminiscent of law levels, this measures
the size of the hyphen in anal-retentive, concerning the major
government of YTU.  The actual code is as follows:

0   Extremely rigid (0% Flexible)

1   Very, very rigid (10% Flexible)

2   Very rigid (20% Flexible)

3   Relatively rigid (30% Flexible)

4   Slightly rigid (40% Flexible)

5   Balanced (50% Flexible)

6   Rather chaotic (60% Flexible)

7   Relatively chaotic (70% Flexible)

8   Very chaotic (80% Flexible)

9   Very, very chaotic (90% Flexible)

A   Only exists in name (100% Flexible)

UTUP Gearheadedness:
This characteristic represents the degree of technicality and detail
utilized within YTU.  This is measured in the amount of precise detail
encountered, as described by the following code:

0   Let\'s just roleplay... (0% Precision)

1   Very, very loose (10% Precision)

2   Very loose (20% Precision)

3   Relatively undetailed (30% Precision)

4   Some vagueness (40% Precision)

5   Balanced (50% Precision)

6   Rather detailed (60% Precision)

7   Relatively detailed (70% Precision)

8   Very detailed (80% Precision)

9   Very, very detailed (90% Precision)

A   Got the schematic right here... (100% Precision)

UTUP Average Technology:
This characteristic describes the average technology level of YTU. 
This uses the same Tech Level digit as is used by the UWP.

UTUP Timeline:
This characteristic describes the timeline of YTU in comparison to the
official Traveller Universe.  The specific codes are as follows:

0   Pre-Industrial  (I don\'t like my fantasy gaming rules, so I use
Traveller instead.)

1   Industrial (First Contact or Cyberspace campaign.)

2   Early Stellar (circa First Imperium or Rule of Man)

3   Low Stellar (Long Night and Milieu 0/T4 era)

4   Mid Stellar (from circa 200 to 1000)

5   High Stellar (1000 to 1115; Classic Traveller)

6   Shattered Imperium (1115 to 1130ish; MegaTraveller time period and
background)

7   Regency (TNE time period circa 1200)

8   Grand Imperium (1115 to 1130ish; G:T alternate timeline)

9   Another period in the Traveller Universe timeline.

A   Alternate location/background.

UTUP Canonicity:
This section describes the relative canonicity of the setting and the
campaign overall.  Remember that the scale is rated from 
conservative to radical, and is not meant to be any indication of 
its Social Standing on or off the TML based on its canonicity.  The 
list below details the various levels:

0   The official universe is my universe!  (0% Deviation)

1   Only minor interpretational differences exist, mostly background
related.  (10% Deviation)

2   Minor interpretational differences exist, some of the gaming
system affected.  (20% Deviation)

3   One major interpretational difference exists, mostly background
related.  (30% Deviation)

4   One major interpretational difference exists, major impact on
system.  (40% Deviation)

5   Some modification has occurred in most areas.  Still recognizable.
 (50% Deviation)

6   Major modification of the campaign milieu and rules system.  (60%
Deviation)

7   Modifications make the campaign milieu almost unrecognizable. 
(70% Deviation)

8   The names have been changed to protect the innocent.  (80%
Deviation)

9   I\'m definitely not violating any copyright laws.  (90% Deviation)

A   Traveller is the name I hide my new system under.  (100%
Deviation)


RACES AND OTHER ISSUES (The Skills Section):
To keep this UTUP system open-ended, all other issues regarding YTU
can be described by Skills and Skill Levels.  If a
subject/race/whatever is not listed, then it is assumed that it is in
accord with the official published Traveller material.  Otherwise, a
Skill and Skill Level can be used to detail YTU\'s divergence from the
rules that everyone else knows about.

For example, if FTL travel is not accomplished by Jump Drive, then 
the UTUP has the following Skill: Jump Drives-9.  If Jump Drives can 
operate on vessels under 100dT, then maybe that\'s only Jump  
Drives-4.

The actual skill levels are described below, with 0 indicating total 
compliance with published material and A representing complete 
divergence and/or total change from the published material:

0   0% Deviation

1   10% Deviation

2   20% Deviation

3   30% Deviation

4   40% Deviation

5   50% Deviation

6   60% Deviation

7   70% Deviation

8   80% Deviation

9   90% Deviation

A   100% Deviation

Note:  This is effectively the same scale used under UTUP Canonicity.

Final Example:

Project StarRise is a First Contact campaign using traditional 
Traveller background and modified HERO System rules.  Its UTUP would 
be:

Project StarRise (HERO) A37A11
First Contact-1  Vilani-2  Solomani Rim History-1

The variations above are based on the limited and somewhat 
conflicting information that exists regarding the time period and the 
direction of the campaign after PCs become mixed into it.

Thanks for your time.

With MT enhanced character generation, I used to take any overachievement on the
decoration roles (the ones which achieved higher order decorations) and add them
towards a "Fame" score that was used occasionally on influence tasks (ie
occasionally the PC in question would use the "do you know who you\'re dealing
with" argument to try and influence a PC). The task difficulty was based on the
distance from the character\'s homeworld.

It worked pretty well but I made sure not to overuse it. In the case of wealth
you could also use that as a modifier on the roll, I suppose.

The thing that most struck me with his tech was how the wedges stopped
focused energy attacks like lasers by distorting them so they had no
penetration, which AFAIK might work, and somehow that still works on the
X-Ray pulse from a nuke, which is most certainly not coherent or focused.
The other thing is that PD fire seems quite poor, IMO.

Having spent a fair bit of time in the butts of rifle ranges I\'d say it

enormous electrical arc.

Doug, that sounds good, I\'ve always like the concept of damage
directly reducing characteristics.  

Let me just say that, IMO, INT and EDU should also be reduced by
damage, too.  I can guarentee you that someone distracted by pain,
blood lose, and/or concussion isn\'t going to perform mental tasks
any better than physical ones.

Taking a different approach, it might work better to increase all
task difficulities when a character is injured.  Perhaps, a "light
wound" increases difficulty levels by one and a "serious wound"
increase difficulty levels by two until the wound is "healed."

I disagree.  The technophobia and xenophobia aren\'t a problem.  As for the
religions and such, most of them are of the cult variety (are there any that
aren\'t?) and there was a major of population drop.  The number of people still
alive when the Third Imperium existed are very small (leaving remnants out,
for the purposes of this discussion).  In most areas there have been maybe 3
or 4 full generations (the last coming of age as the New Era begins... c1201).

Mostly, the people against the concept of Virus really seem to think it\'s
unviable for Traveller computers in general (regardless of their actual
composition and operation).  This completely ignores the transponder issue,
too. : )  I doubt changing the name will change their opinions.  Virus was
intended as a means of getting AI into Traveller (something that Traveller had
always tip-toed around).  The Empress Wave was about getting psionics into
Traveller (another tip-toe item, especially as was explained in G:T) and
something of a raising social consciousness (as well as raising the possiblity
of having weird physics,etc w/o having to move the campaign to a pocket
universe).

IMTU it\'s been HEPlaR all along (as was the underlying assumption of TNE).
Once, I tossed around the idea that the operation of Thruster Plates
*required* an interconnectivity w/ the main computers and artificial-grav and
Grav-compensation systems (can u say "Grav pong?").  This interconnectivity
would be impossible to protect against Virus (unless done as the Hivers
apparently do and use a domesticated strain) and thus HEPlaR became the
standard thrust agency once again.   This means that most relics are going to
need to be refitted w/ a different manuever drive.  If that was the case, the
Regency would\'ve converted away from T-plates except in very limited cases.
RASAC was experimenting w/ "tamed" Strain 5 Virii but that caused a huge
public outcry, especially amongst the victims and decendants of the Rape of
Trin.   Also reference the "Rhylanor Institute of Terror" (robotics is bad
juju). 

Of course, IMTU i\'m allowing T-plates anyways, but at TL17 or 18 (i haven\'t
decided exactly yet).  I have always been dubious on the handwaves given for
T-plates, but there\'s always Clarke\'s Law and all that...  ; )  Course, IMTU
pretty much *all* of the alternate tech from Fire, Fusion, and Steel is
possible and viable (indeed used by some races)...

The perfect choice.  The Empress Wave especially, as one example, was his baby
and only he truly knows his original intentions and what/where he would\'ve
done w/ it.

Dave Nilsen says he had this one about half done, but had to do the art
direction for the Regency Combat Vehicle Guide or it wouldn\'t have been
published.  Also that it would\'ve included the design sheets so that we could
tinker w/ the designs.  This one sounded like it would\'ve been damned good
IMO...  

The RC Guide to the Aurora Clipper was mentioned in Brilliant Lances (one of
the earliest TNE products).  It must\'ve been pushed on teh backburner big
time.

What\'s chilling is that anyone would boost without looking inside the

I hadn\'t read the original, but I saw a movie version the Science Fiction
network made. I got the idea that the pilot never considered that someone
would stow away on his ship - he figured that anyone who had access
to his ship would know what kind of death sentence stowing away
would mean. 

****spoiler warning if you haven\'t seen/read it*******

















The movie version I saw was one of the best original movies
Sci Fi network has done.

He falls in love with her, but she can\'t land the ship...and though he
wants to, he has a responsibility too important for him to die with
her. She steps into the airlock, and he has to cycle it open.

Blew me away.

They did another movie that day, one from a story I had read, though
the title escapes me. The original story had two people trapped on
a spaceship that was running out of air...the movie elaborated on
the idea quite a bit. The rewrite added more crewmen, mostly stock
type characters. They had air enough for all but one crewman...
and the engineer decided he didn\'t want to risk being the one to draw
the short straw. The dangerous cat and mouse game that ensues
makes things worse...great scenario idea.

Yep. Crack if supersonic. I think the problem came about when the original
notes on gauss weapons said you could adjust the velocity of the round to
produce a subsonic round, but that range suffered. It may be that the
description then got edited down to remove the part about adjusting the
velocity, and kept the part about silent. Still, brings up an interesting
question if you have a laser rangefinder on a gauss weapon, so you could input
the power needed for an optimum trajectory. 

I ain\'t gonna sweat it.

Why would it need to be disposable? In space, no one gets dirty, so you just

An old ASW friend once told me of life on destroyers - you had a given
number of uniforms, folded and stacked neatly in your locker. You wore the
first one for a week, then refolded it and put it to the bottom of the
stack, then donning the uniform on top.  You repeated this process till the
first uniform had risen through the stack to the top.  At this point, it
was perfectly clean.  At least it smelt better than anything else in the
stack...

IMO, the "Grand Imperium" should be included w/ "Alternate

Actually have that be:

8, The Far Future (M:2000 Marc talked \'bout)
A,  Official Alternate universe (1116 to 1130+, G:T)

I\'d think that a needle round would have a real light crack.  Besides, if 
somebody shoots at you with a supersonic round, you\'re dead before you hear it.

Um, not quite.  People still sweat, skin cells still shed, and skin bacteria 
still breed.  So yeah, people still get dirty.

I could see a small \'sonic washer\' installed in a wall someplace on a TL10+
ship.  Just stuff your dirty clothes in it overnight, then wear the clean
clothes in the morning.

Or, just stuff your dirty clothes in your duffel and wash them when you get to
port.  Every character I\'ve ever played, and every character I\'ve ever reffed,
had at least 2 weeks\' worth of clothes in their duffel for just this purpose.
And there\'s such a thing as \'room service\' at spacers\' hostels in whatever TU
I\'ve played that took care of laundry.

Again in the real world, the First Officer is traditionally in charge of
cargo operations, although the Captain may supervise it himself if he has
reason to believe there will be problems.  After all, what is there on a
cargo ship that is more important to do?  The owners expect the ship to
make money, which means careful attention to the money-making aspects of
operations.  I\'m not so sure about how passenger ships work, but I suspect
it\'s something similar.

Ah, but in the SW Inistraded thingy they just put out, they have the plans
for the MF...  It has four bunks...  In some of the books they talk about
staterooms...  In the movies you see some bunks....  As for the cargo hold,

As you know, Rob Prior has produced a superb set of programs for use with
Traveller under MacOS. This include QSDS(the software), Infini-V (vehicle

development) and a variety of Hypercard Stacks.

Anyway, Apple just released MacOS 8.5, which went totally PowerPC native.
Rob\'s machine at home is a 680x0 series, and mine has yet to be upgraded to
8.5(*) so I would appreciate knowing if the programs all work under OS8.5.

So if anyone has upgraded to OS8.5, can they let me know if the software
works - the demos of the shareware, along with the full versions of the
Hypercard stacks are available at http://www.cybergoths.u-net.com/RPS.html

Many thanks in advance,

specifically Photoshop as I don\'t use it a lot compared to Illustrator) I\'m
going to end up delaying upgrading the OS longer :-(

Nice answer.

I am the one that said "within 10 parsecs." Minor races have a smaller
population base. That does not preclude us from encountering them very far
away, nor does it stop a player character member of such a minor race

Its a rule of thumb/ observed phenomenon. It\'s not like the Navy checks ships

Yes it is a question of terminology. My pointis that the charts reflect the
structure and data of the game rules and they need to be done first. Then I\'ll
cut them back and put in as much as is necessary for the base/core rules book.
And that willbe surrounded by narrative rules which detail how to do it. The
problem is that most rules are written in a sequential style, and often don\'t
clearly express how to do whatever the game calls for.

You\'re welcome. The thought behind Faraway sector was also that it would
provide aplace where you could put that self-designed sector and still have
some potential ties to the Impeerium campaign (although separated by enough
distance that they wouldn\'t interfere with each other).

Once you\'ve dropped to Grave status (all three physical characteristics
lowered to zero) you begin losing INT.  (Oxygen starvation) when INT hits
zero, you are dead.

Each level of injury carries it\'s own problems, mostly involving lost
Action Points and having to roll to stay conscious.

double-standard is alive and well, folks, and a small publisher has to
decide if the issue is worth taking a financial hit. Sex-ed programs are
under fire as having no place in school - the same schools have many
teenage mothers and are surrounded by extremely suggestive advertising
billboards. Gang violence is decried, yet television and movies glorify
violence as a way of gaining respect.

Much as I wish North America could relax a bit, the unfortunate fact is
that our culture seems to accept public violence but not public sex
(except in advertising, where the reverse applies).

Attention to quick NPC creation. As GM, I need to have some idea how well

Extended system generation. Any number of the less hospitable mainworlds

Yes!
In trade and commerce, I\'d like to see random generation of freight or

available on and marketable on a world to the UWP; an inverse relationship
between purchase price and size of cargo;  and having differences in TL
affect manufactured goods most, processed materials less, raw materials
least.

A good adventure hook is the usefullness of bureacrats and administrators
from far away ... they bring new perspectives, arent linked in to any local
power networks, and nobody local knows the exact way they can be got at.

These sort of \'mercenary administrators\' were used in Mogul India, and
occasionally in China and the Ottoman Empire as well.

Here, this is a 3 meter pole...you can play with that p***cy stuff using it.

As for _smuggling_ well, I suspect there\'s going to be little variation
from today.

You either a) sneak it in under their noses, b) bring it in where and
when they\'re not looking, or c) bribe someone to let it through.

Now, complicating matters, the starport is not under the authority of
the regulating entity, generally, so you can usually land with whatever
it is you\'re smuggling. You can get it across the fence either using
option a) or c). With modern smuggling operations, at least into a
relatively high law state as the US, a) is the usual course. You stick
whatever you\'re smuggling in with legitimate goods, hide it somehow,
like false bottoms in cargo containers, inside body parts of the
air-raft, or more creatively, as they\'ve done with cocaine coming into
the US, make it into something legitimate.

 In one case, IIRC, the cocaine was set into concrete culvert sections
and terra cotta pipes, pots and figurines. IN other cases they have
actually molded the coke into innocuous shapes. 

This gets harder as detectors get better...tl15 densitometers will make
it really difficult to get by with hiding it in vehicles or false
bottoms...it depends on how closely everything is searched.

Bribing a customs agent is widely practiced; just be aware, as with any
bribe, you\'re not buying the person, only renting them for an
indeterminate amount of time.

Sneaking something past them where they\'re not looking, is widely done,
as you can just bring in the entire ship offload it and go, smaller
vessels can be used as well.

This has it\'s own dangers, of course. You can run afoul of the COACC
forces, which usually can readily get a shoot on sight order, and blow
you out of the sky.

It just depends on how closely the airspace around the planet is.

Unless HIWG are using their own codes the following should answer
your question:

G) Small station or facility.  Either operated  by  an  off-world
   clan or controlled by a company. (the only  instance  where  a
   world is controlled by anything but a clan).

H) Split control.  Different parts of  the  world  are  owned  by
   several on-world clans, an analogy to human balkanised worlds.

J) Single on-world clan control.  Other small clans may  also  be
   present, but they will be dominated by the major clan.

K) Single multi-worlds clan control.  The world is controlled  by
   a single clan whose span  extends  over  several  worlds,  not
   necessarily nearby.

L) Major clan control, the world is  controlled  by  one  of  the
   Tlaukhu.

M) Vassal clan control, the world is controlled (but  not  owned)
   by a vassal clan in fief to a large clan.

N) Major vassal clan control.  The world is controlled  (but  not
   owned) by a vassal clan in fief to one of the Tlaukhu.

(Tlaukhu = The 29 dominant clans of the Aslan Hierate)

Without any statement from me, then every artist and every writer put in his

in text. Without direction, artists put in whatever they want, and from time
to time, they make the drawings suggestive or downright sexual even though it
has no application to subject being illustrated.

So I have made a statement which has to do with principle rather than not make
a statement and let many other participants set the tone instead.

THE TRAVELLER CARD SYSTEM
	Traveller cards are used to record, access, and present information in the
course of preparing for and playing adventures. 

 DIMENSIONS
	Cards are laid out with dimensions of 3.5 inches width and 2.5 inches height.
This 2.5 x 3.5 size is the same as a common playing card. 
	Leading. Line spacing is based on eighteen 9 point cells in a Word for
Windows table. Typically two stacked cells form a boxed entry on the card; the
upper cell holds the entry title or name; the lower cell holds data (and may
be the location of a mail merge field). The total height of the card is 
	Cell Width. Cell widths may be any size, but total width is 3.39 inches.
Typical cell widths are quarters.

Columns
	Col 1	Col 2	Col 3	Col 4
Four Columns	0.85	0.85	0.85	0.84
Three Columns	1.13	1.13	1.13	
Two Columns	1.70	1.69		
One Column	3.39			

	Special Sizes. Some forms are double-sized: 5.0 x 3.5 or 2.5 x 7.0. Other
forms are full page size or even poster size.

HEADINGS 
	Headings in cells are set in 6 pt Arial flush left. 
	The Card Title is set at the bottom of the card in Arial Bold 6 pt. The Card
title is set flush left; the card number is expressed as Form NN flush right,
with NN as the two digit card number.

RULINGS
	The outside border for the card form is 3 pt.
	Inside rulings are 3/4 point.

 CARD NUMBERING SYSTEM
	Blank cards are numbered with two digits to recapitulate their specific
purposes. The first digit indicates a basic category or area of interest; the
second digit identifies a specific type of card. Card numbers ending in 0
(zero) are not used. Card numbers ending in 9 are a non-standard size
(typically double width or double height). 
	Cards numbered higher than 99 are non-standard and are created by game
masters or adventure writers based on need.

throughout time and space. Their exploits irrevocably influenced what races

The history of the universe is divided into Milieux: eras or periods which in

As far as I see it, the Imperium doesnt ban much, except for nukes and slaves.

The main problem with smuggling is thus getting it out of the starport\'s
extrality fence, although this would be confused if the Starport
Administrator (1) has some sort of \'courtesy rule\' with the local
authorities - you may have local police enforcing local rules within the
starport but outside the ships themselves, on the basis of an arrangement
with the starport administrator.

On the other hand, if the Imperial authorities are at all serious about
controlling piracy, then goods without paperwork are going to be suspect,
on the grounds goods stolen by pirates tend not to have paper trails
(Imperial customs, IMO, are worried about things like \'Who did you buy this
batch of x off, for how much, and have you got a receipt ?\'. Too many
inadequate answers gets your ship requisitioned by the IN at standard rates
while fuller enquiries are conducted. The courtesy detail of Marines on
board while you are shuttling widgets between two Navy bases is a, well,
courtesy detail).

Therefore, smuggling and counter-smuggling would be (IMO) concentrated on
the non-mainworlds - the little in-system colonies, which, being poor, tend
to have less scruples at who they deal with.

(1) It has been suggested that Starport Administrator is a good job for an
Imperial Noble.

"How To Make War" James Dunnigan (Quill Books)

Non-SF.  Excellent resource on everything military.  Written from a
West/East perspective, it explains many basic military concepts like
logistics and force multipliers.

"Victory and Deceit: Dirty Tricks at War" James Dunnigan and Albert A. Nofi
(Quill Books)

Interesting look at the history of trickery and tactics from the Ancient
age on up.  Also covers techniques of camoflague, EW and clever leadership.

"Shooting Blanks: War Making That Doesn\'t Work" James Dunnigan (Quill Books)

How *not* to do it.  Looks at some of the classic errors, and catalogs the
common causes of military diasters.

"Honor Harrington Series" David Weber (Baen)

Excellent series transporting Europe of the late 18th/early 19th to the far
future.  Good map for the politics of a military or naval campaign.

"Rogue Warrior Series" Richard Marchinko

Semi-reality based series of novels by the former US Navy SEAL.  The first
book is Marchinko\'s autobiography, the follow-ups are exciting
techo-thrillers.  Useful for running special operations campaigns.

Best bet:  hide the goods in something with the same density, like computer
chips in hydraulic fluid perhaps.

One useful technique:  smuggle legitimate goods.  Say you bring in 50,000
pairs of shoes, but only declare 40,000.  The other 10,000 are not only
duty-free, but can be sold tax-free off the books as well.  As long as you
(or your broker) is careful to never have more of the item on hand than you
can legitimately account for, it is very difficult to prove that there is
anything funny going on.  Most customs agents won\'t bother.

  Dragon #76 had their first index, which covered most of the Trav articles.
Dragon #112 had a (less detailed), updated version which should have covered
pretty much all the Trav stuff they ever published - assuming that they dumped
non-TSR SF shortly thereafter(?).

1. "Rimrunners" by CJ Cherryh
ISBN 0-450-54981-X
Tells a story of Bet Yeager, an ex-marine stranded when her ship pulled
out, forced to scrounge for jobs in a starport. Eventually she joins a
ship\'s crew, which turns out to be a spy vessel, and becomes involved in a
conflict with her previous unit. The story focuses on the character, but
the station details, ship details and power armour descriptions could all
be used in Traveller.

2. "Starship Troopers" by Robert A Heinlein
ISBn 0-441-78358-9
The original and best power armour novel, which blows the film away.

3. "Consider Phlebas" by Iain M Banks
ISBN unknown - my copy has been borrowed.
Tells the story of a small strike team sent to recover a powerful AI
supercomputer from the forbidden planet were it crash landed during a war.
The team behaves like many Traveller groups, and the planet is interdicted
like a Red Zone.

4. "The Reality Dysfunction" by Peter F Hamilton.
ISBN 0-330-34032-8
Set in the Confederation, this novel seems heavily influenced by Traveller
- - ships have jump drives, gauss weapons are common, and the Confederation
navy rules the space between stars. There is a litte more biotechnology
than the clasic Traveller setting, but there are many memorable scenes both
in space and on planet involving small unit combat as well as some
excellent starship scenes. The crew of the \'Lady Macbeth\' could almost be a
typical Traveller group.

Carlos - In Juloa\'s defense I should point out that almost nobody Beyond
the Extents will know about Darmine customs.  So therefore the odds of
her being kidnapped by sex slavers should be no greater than the odds
that any attractive, exotic looking, captivating public performer, green
haired woman, with no family to miss her, might be kidnapped by sex
slavers.  [Er wait a second what I meant to say is that no one would
wan\'t to kidnap Juloa because she would be too annoying.  Yes that\'s my
story and I\'m sticking too it.]

Again, no. The embryo becomes even _more_ foreign after fertilisation. It now 
has a different DNA sequence and should by all rights be recognised by the 
mothers own immune system as a foreign body and attacked. What happens 
is that somehow (as yet a complete mystery to science) the mothers immune 
system is suppressed in relation to the embryo alone (this is one of the biggest 
mysteries of the human body). It could be that what ever mechanism protects 
the embryo from the mothers own immune system also protects the embryo. 
Hey here you have a possible key as to how the Ancients protected the 
Darmine in the first place. The Ancients boosted the Darmine immunoresponse 
to cope with the extra pressure and as a consequence the embryo is 
safeguarded by the normal mechanisms. This will also protect the unfertilised 
egg but will massively attack the sperm, leading to your drop in fertility.

Good point, if the protective meassures are attacking the sperm, then the 
"window" for conception will be shortened.

How about this for an idea. The protective measures boosted the 
immunoresponse which lead to the shortened "window" as the sperm were 
attacked and consequent drop in fertility. To counter this the Ancients simply 
increased libido to increase the chance of intercourse during the window (an 
easy solution). This then lead to the sperm count problem, to which the 
Ancients again adopted a "quick fix" and simply geneered the the time required 
for the male to rebuild sperm down or geneered the male sperm count up.

Now if you go with the latter (just increase male sperm count), you will get 
some very interesting effects on Darmine/Non-Darmine mating. When a 
Darmine male has sex with a Non-Darmine female you will have a greater 
chance of conception. That could lead to all sorts of interesting effects :*>.

This question sparked some ideas; here\'s an alternative explanation.  I
recommend taking a look at past discussions, especially some of Peter
L.S. Trevor\'s <ptrevor.trisen@zetnet.co.uk> ideas - search for "Jumping
from zero planetary diameters (long)" in mid-October.

Technobabble:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Using one version of the standard handwave, "diameters" is an
approximation for "gravitational potential".  My reading of this is that
you cannot be too "deep" in a gravity well in order to jump safely out
of that well.

The key aspect of this interpretation is jumping *out of the well*.
Jumps within the well are not a problem - in effect, ambient gravitation
is irrelevant.

Consequences:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Standard Jump:  In order to safely jump from one star system to another,
you need to be 100D from the star as well as any local bodies (planets,
planetoids, etc).  No real difference from the way many of us play it.

Macro-Jump: A ship with jump-700,000 (if it existed) would be able to
jump safely to the Andromeda Galaxy.  However, it would first have to
move outward until its gravitational potential with respect to the Milky
Way matched the 100D rule, and it would then have to work its way in to
Andromeda from a similar distance.

Micro-Jump: Jumps within a star\'s gravity well only have to take into
account the *relative* gravitational potential of entry and exit point.
So, a jump from one point to another, both 0.1AU from the star, would be
completely safe.  Jumping from Mercury\'s orbit to the Oort cloud,
however, would be very dangerous (if possible at all).

Nano-jump: It should be possible to jump safely from one point on a
planet\'s surface to another of similar altitude.  Safely, that is, in
terms of the jump itself - depending on how you deal with conservation
of momentum you could come out at half a mile per second relative to the
ground (see Larry Niven\'s article "On the theory and practice of
teleportation")!

More random thoughts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This idea differs from PLST\'s "gravitational stress" version, though the
calculations are pretty much identical.  The two can be brought closer
together by modifying one of PLST\'s definitions thus:

   Minimum safe distance to initiate Jump is any point where the
   gravitational stress factor is less than 1pS greater than the minimum
   gsf for the jump route.

This is a sort of topological view of jump - it depends on the "surface"
of space between entry and exit.

Anyway, enough for now.  Hopefully there\'s some food for thought there.

John

In the case of most human races this would be true but Darmine medicine
(especially pharmacology) is made significantly more complicated by the
fact that their bodies will break down and destroy and medicine that is
put into it.  This makes fertiltiy tratment nigh impossible without
genetic engineering.

The Darmine Cultural Region occupies subsectors J, K, O, and P of
Zarushagar Sector.  It is mostly Average Stellar, with some Low Stellar,
some High Stellar, and relatively few lower tech worlds.  According to
the (only semi canonical) DGP data the Hi Pop planets of the region have
the following stats:

Liasdi  0928 A897944-C    Hi                 404 Im F8 D 
Ishag   1323 B525966-A  N Hi In              515 Im G1 VI

World   2740 D766AA8-8  S Hi                 100 Im K3 D 
[note that according to The Atlas of the the Imperium, pg 21, the name
for this planet is listed as "world" (not in all caps like the other Hi
Pop planetary names) which tends to suggest this is an error]
Zimila  2838 C6449CB-C    Hi In              113 Im G1 V M9 D 
Kees    2937 A527986-E    Hi In              424 Im M1 V M5 D
Gaidraa 3136 B5279A9-C  S Hi In              400 Im K3 D M5 D
Ermi    3139 E200986-8    Hi In Va Na        203 Im F3 V 

This list has a total population of over 77 billion (1 x 10^9).
Tech level breakdown is as follows

	TL	Pop (billions)
	F	 2
	E	14
	D	-
	C	29
	B	-
	A	16
	9	 4
	8	12 

So as you see the Darmine have mostly Average Stellar Tech Levels.

The Darmine have never "solved" their low fertility rates because:
1) 	It never crossed their mind to do so.
2)	They believe that they are _supposed_to_be_ the way they are
3)	If they fixed it they would have a rather alarming population 
	problem in short order
4)	Their current state is due to Ancient technology and they 		probably
_couldn\'t_ fix it  

No one else has ever fixed it for them because:
1)	There is no demand (and thus no pay)
2)	Darmine can be annoying as hell and few people would be thrilled 	by
their population suddenly starting to grow exponentially
3)	The Third Imperium is not that big on genetic engineering anyway
4)	Their current state is due to Ancient technology and they 		probably
_couldn\'t_ fix it

If it was "fixed" the heavy metal tolerance would be lost too.  If that
happened their own mothers blood would poison them.  The air of their
homeworld would poison them.  Their mothers milk would poison them.  All
their food would poison them.  It is not worth it.

Now for a mixed couple living outside the Darmine cultural region this
might be different.  For example the first culturally Darmine PC I ever
generated was only half Darmine genetically.  One of his parents was
pure Darmine from the Darmine Cultural Region and the other was of mixed
Vilani/other ancestry and Vilani cultural heritage.  However he was
conceived in a lab.  On the other hand as they were both female all
their children would have to have been conceived in a lab anyway.

Being poor could preclude the outworld from being the direct buyer of the

I don\'t think there is any prohibition about show emotional connections, so
a plot line involving a Romeo and Juliet situation would be fair.

What I see a gratuitous sexual content would be titillating situations and
images that are there for no other reason than to appeal to our baser
instincts.  Consider the difference between the films "The American
President" and "Porky\'s".  The first covers a growing romance, and includes
a very sexual scene done in a very tasteful, discreet manner.  (All the
"good stuff" happens off-screen).  The second is a mess where (mostly)
female body parts are shown off simply as if to say "Tits!  Look!!"

Marc can correct me if I\'m wrong, but I doubt that a well written romantic
situation would be rejected out of hand.  And unless one is writing
pornography, I can\'t see any situation in a RPG that would call for graphic
descriptions of sexual activity.

(For a look at what you can get away with, take a look at the illo of the
messy starship interior in Behind the Claw.. take a *real* close look at
the pack of smokes on the table...)

This is called the two-bag system of submarine laundry. You take all
your kit aboard in one bag, labelled clean; and a spare bag, labelled
dirty. As you wear your clothes, youplace the used items in the dirty
bag, taking new ones from the clean bag. When the dirty bag is full and
the clean bag empty - reverse the labels.

the clothing refresher sonicly bombards the clothing to remove dirt and other

"behaves like many Traveller groups" = "are a bunch of bloodthirsty 
mercs/pirates/semi-criminal opportunistic scum in a battered old starship
with assorted guns". I was struck by the resemblence myself...

Banks\' other books - though brilliant - aren\'t very Travellerish, as they\'re
mostly set in The Culture, a (roughly) TL-20 to 21 civilization. (Advanced
AIs (incredibly advanced), 30-km spaceships, mini-ringworlds, teleportation,
genetic engineering...) The Culture is in the background of Consider Phlebas,
engaged in a war against an equally-powerful non-human civilization; it 
provides an interesting viewpoint for the characters (with much lower TL and
resources) scurrying around the edges of a (literally) planet-smashing war.
(My second-favourite scene in Phlebas involves watching a Culture warship
carve apart a million-mile mini-ringworld to make a political point.) (Not
really a spoiler, since the characters arrive at the ringworld know it\'s going
to be evacuated and destroyed, and are trying to scavenge some big lasers
that were abandoned...)

What do you get when you mix a mass driver with a missile rack launch
system?

You get the X-TEK/Maximus "Bat of Hell" missile system!

This system takes a standard missile rack, but adds a magneto-gravatic
accelerator to the launch tube, the effect is high initial velocity and
consequently higher kinetic energy.  Apply more thrust when you light
the missile and cause downright EVIL levels of damage to your target! 
Add a penetrator, or fusion warhead to add insult to injury!  Amuse your
friends, destroy your enemies, fun for the whole crew!

But wait, that\'s not all!

For a limited time only, get our SmartBat(tm) AI system included with
your first purchase.
This computer system has deck plans from hundreds of standard ships.  As
it penetrates the hull, the missile with this system will then plow
trough the ship looking for a location specified by the missile gunner. 
This can be anywhere on the ship, provided it\'s on the ship plans in the
computers memory be it Captains room, engineering, the bridge, or our
personal favorite, the captain\'s "throne".  Once at a location, it will
hover in place and count down a few seconds giving the person(s) time to
pray to whatever gods they worship. Then it explodes, possibly
destroying the ship.  Loads of fun for all ages!  Guaranteed to break
the ice at parties!

Or sneaking it _out_. The US doesn\'t worry much about that,
(except for military hardware), but I know of others that have
had or do have restrictions on export of animals and plants,
technology, and people. 

Sneaking it in/out or bribery can be effective, but for more
drama, I was thinking about b).

I can think of three or four ways for smugglers to make life hard
for customs forces.  What kind of TL and level of development
would be needed to shut down smuggling to or from orbital space?

When, besides in the cases of slavery or nuclear weapons, would
the Imperium get involved in anti-smuggling efforts?

This why I\'d like to see the basic rules book be rules heavy and very
setting light.  IMHO, the basic T5 book should cover the basics of
everything, with 2-3 page descriptions of the various planned setting
books.  That way, a solid system of basics arrive early.

The various setting books can then focus heavily on what the characters
find in each milieu, along with whatever modifications are required (ex: in
the Interstellar Wars book, the TL ceiling is 11 for both sides, and so on.)

My ideas for what the "core books" beyond the rules should be are simple:

An Armory, containing weapons from TL 1 to 16+, along with the expanded
combat rules.

A Starship Operations book, with all the fiddly bits about running (not
designing) starships, along with the expalnations of how things are
supposed to work.  This would answer the questions like "can I EVA in jump?"

A World Design book, giving assitance to the Referee on designing worlds
for adventure.  Not just more random tables, but guidance on making a world
live.

"FFS3", or whatever it will be called.  The gearhead bible, with a
comprehensive, consistant set of guidelines for designing vehicles, ships,
and weapons.  A nice addition would be an essay on what things will look
and feel like, and one on why TL advancement drops off so quickly after TL8.

These five books would be the complete Traveller.  The setting books would
be optional additions for those who want a pregenerated setting.  The basic
rules would be Imperium orientated, but not straight-jacketed into a single
Milieu.

All of this is IMHO, of course.

Firstly the \'core\' books
1  T5. This should be the only book you absolutely have to buy. You should be
    able to pick up this book and run enjoyable games for the rest of your life
    with this alone. It should have all the basic mechanics and set the
    \'house\' mileau (the one which any TNS entries on the FarFutures website
    will support). It should have a simple set of chargen, worldgen, ship building
    combat etc rules. It should also give a timeline and thumbnails of every
    mileau.
2  T5 FFS. This should be the technical \'bible\' of Traveller. It should be
    gearheads heaven, covering the construction of everything at any TL (hey
    this is a wish list after all). It should be useable with any mileau.
3  T5 Mercenary. This should have lists of weapons for all TL and an advanced
    combat system, along with rules for large scale military campaigns.
4  T5 High Guard. This should cover all aspects of space travel. It should cover
    starports, space travel and combat in depth. It should have a detailed
    space combat system and cover running a naval campaign
5  T5 Faraway Sector. This should cover the physical aspects of creating
    worlds in detail. It should allow the creation of physically realistic worlds for
    any Mileau (of neccessity it would have to ignore the social aspects, which
    would be mileau dependent). It should also give guidelines for grow your own
    minor race.

Race books
Each of the major races should have a book (or more realistically half a book) 
detailing them (this includes detailing the Solomani, Vilani and Zhodani)

Mileau books
1   Each mileau should have a basic sourcebook covering the period in depth
    and setting a \'house\' sector (preferably the same sector should be used
    for every mileau, but again this is a wish list). It should have detailed chargen
    rules and setting dependent material
2   Sector books. These should take one sector from a mileau and cover it in
    depth, giving chargen, aliens, equipment etc.

General things
I would like to see at least one minor human race and one sector \'ringfenced\' 
from any official development, so that individual referees can detail it as they 
see fit.

    'body' => 'Hi!  I\'ve been thinking about the future history for the First Contact
milieu that Marc has proposed for T5.

What I would like to propose is that the actual details of what Earth is
like, and how it got that way should be left fairly sketchy, and that the
background mostly concentrate on the off-Earth settlements, like Luna.

My reasons are as follows:

1.  Any detailed future history is likely to suffer from the Twilight:2000
problem, where changes in the real world will make it impossible/silly. 
Instead, it should be left "flexible", and should focus mainly on the
period after about 2050 or so.

2.  Any near future history will necessarily deal with issues that people
have strong real world opinions about.  Even a purely "technical"
orientation to "history" writing will involve making judgements about what
is possible and likely.  The result will be some serious pushing of
people\'s buttons, which should be avoidable.

Examples:  Does Australia become a republic?  Does the UK?  Is there a
united Ireland?  Does Scotland secede?  Quebec?  The Basque country?  Does
Puerto Rico become a state of the US?  What happens in Israel/Palestine? 
Does the European Union work?  Doesn\'t any country in Europe ever elect an
anti-EU government?  What happens to Cuba? Mexico? etc etc....

The fudge is, as I suggested above, that the material should focus on Luna,
and further out.  Earth can\'t be entirely avoided, but should be approached
sparsely.  Broadly, each referee should be able to design their own
history, according to their own prejudices, within the very broad elbow
room of canon.

Published Earth-based scenarios will of course exist, and this is where the
main problem lies.  Its only Earth where you will be able to find a whole
bunch of terrain types, such as jungles, unless Mars gets terraformed very
early, which sounds a bit iffy.  If it wasn\'t that people would want the
exotic locations, you could get by by defining certain areas as open for
development (the US, say) while leaving the rest of the world for indulging
personal preferences.  Of course, you can\'t really fence areas off like
that - the USA, for example, borders on Canada, (Quebec??), Mexico and
Cuba (kind of).  You would need some idea of what was on the other side of
the border in these cases.

Of course, all of this could just plain be ignored, and the future defined
by fiat, but the objections are still there.  

I\'m not really sure what the answers are, but at least I\'ve pointed out the
questions!

And any other design system should be an easier, less detailed version of  this system.

I want to see something like the Star Wars game system, where, if you know the basic task
mechanic, you know everything--personal combat, starship combat, captial ship combat,
vehicle combat.

All design systems should grow from the same design philosophy too.

  Actually the plot in Exonidas might be of use to G:T refs looking for
something other than (but similar to) the 5FW to hang a campaign on. In
addition to the fairly obvious "massive strategic exchange begins while
you\'re on-world - definitely a Bad War", you can always further victimize
the players by having them on-world beforehand (they\'re somewhat unlikely
to be aware of the #59 articles plot, after all) as mercenaries, and let 
them see things evolve without making it apparent that the big drop is
coming.

  A real sleaze could even have them connected to the Big Oops, or make
them _think_ they are, or have others believe it - or any combination
thereof. The aftermath would also have a variety of opportunities for
non-terrorism/crime-related adventures, possibly even some of an altruistic
or mission-of-mercy nature, but some might not consider that real Traveller :)

    'body' => 'While perusing the GURPSNet archive at http://www.io.com/GURPSnet/ , I came
upon a useful little document that provided a formula that might be of use
to you GURPS Traveller shipbuilders out there. I would love to credit the
author, but cannot find his or her name anywhere on the document.

The formula allows you to estimate the mass of a vehicle, which of course
is useful for estimating how many tons of thrust you need to attain a
particular acceleration. It works thusly:

Maximum Load = 60 * FSM (Frame Strength Modifier) * ESA (Estimated Surface
Area)

This formula assumes a Structural Health of 10. Structural Health (or HT)
is found in GURPS Vehicles, and is usually 10. The ships I checked in GURPS
Traveller actually came out to around 9.5, but that\'s not significant, and
10 can be used, as it will give estimates of loaded mass that will likely
be higher than what you\'ll actually get, thus yielding somewhat higher
accelerations, but you can get in the ballpark with it.

Since the hulls in GURPS Traveller are built with medium frame strengths,
the FSM is 1. The formula gives maximum load in pounds, not tons. Thus for
the purposes of GURPS Traveller, the formula can be:

0.03 tons * Surface Area = Estimated loaded weight

The original document is "insideout", and is highly useful; I reccomend
checking it out. Also while there, check out MALloyd\'s suggested additions
and changes to GURPS Vehicles 2; some of these include technologies highly
applicable to Traveller (a couple even mention Traveller in the
descriptions), and there is a section which addresses the sensors issue,
including suggested fixes that might please some of you.

While I fully support Marc\'s right to control such things in items
licensed from him, just as Disney does the same (if Marc only wants
to appeal to grade-schoolers that\'s his look -out, thing is
grade-schoolers don\'t usually have much money), my main problem was
with the reasoning that "avoiding heat" is an acceptable reason for
banning such content.

This is the classic "thin end of the wedge", resulting in
self-perpetuating censorship and a continuing lack of appropriate
talk about and exposure of a very important part of our lives.

Science Fiction is supposed to be an area where people aren\'t scared
of sexuality,
where people can write things that would not be acceptable in normal
fictions because they are too close to home, where the boundaries
are pushed, not contracted.

I also agree with the person who made a comment similar to
"discussing interesting new ways to kill people is acceptable but
talking about an enjoyable fuck isn\'t."

It\'s not a specific problem with Traveller or Marc, most Americans
and American culture
have the same problem, I just expected better of those involved in
science fiction.

Which implies you think there\'s something wrong with looking at tits
?

What is disturbing about Porky\'s is not that it shows tits, but that
it\'s curently more "acceptable" to do such a movie,  than one that
just shows nice tits, with an appropriate commentary discussing
their individual features and benefits (preferably, it would also
discuss / show the rest of the person behind the breasts, I\'m not
that interested in floating, unnattached mammary glands ), without
all the teen-age "jokes" and innuendo.

I would be surprised if it was.
Romance and sex are two completely different things.

>And unless one is writing pornography, I can\'t see any situation in
a RPG that would call >for graphic descriptions of sexual activity.


I agree that there is unlikley to be any requirement for extremely
detailed descriptions, (and I know few people who could be involved
in such a game without being highly embarrased )  but we\'re not
talking about that. We\'re talking about no depictions or
descriptions of _any_ sexual activity or anything that could be
called "titilating"

( Have to be careful there, a picture of a Hiver may be extremely
titillating to
  another Hiver but mean nothing to an untrained human....  )

And this in a universe where there are supposed to be mercenaries,
decadent nobles and (in some places) slavery. According to the
guidelines a picture of the staff or interior of  a whorehouse or a
believable piece of advertising  for an LSP weapon or vehicle
complete with bimbo in swimsuit leaning over the bonnet would be
rejected, even though they are all acceptable images in modern
media, and even though the lack of them is completely _unbelievable_
given the described Imperium.

Another example, what if Imperial fashion went through a "breast"
phase like our fashion industry is currently in, where fashionable
designs expose one or more breasts ?

And another, the description of Vargr doesn\'t include much about
their sexual practices,
but if Vargr practices are anything like what they are suppposed to
be descended
from, it should be damn obvious to all Travellers. But we\'re not
even told that they\'re
_not_ like that. Not that I mind, it means IMTU I can have the Vargr
acting like
dogs in all ways and not be contradicted by the dreaded Canon.

That\'s supposed to be an Imperial Starburst isn\'t it ?
:-)

BTW, the illos in many early CT licensed products _are_ pretty
titillating anyway,
have a look at "Action Aboard" for example.

Just what we\'ve got now, really, stuff doing re-entry is pretty easy
to detect, though _policing_ it may be difficult, it\'s probably less
difficult than policing a sea coast.

When it found it expedient to do so, as always.
Hell, given the way the Imperium is constructed they\'re very likely to
engage in smuggling themselves where they need to, like the
US involvement in the smuggling of bibles into the Soviet Union.

Definitely, one of the worst things about Traveller is its bad habit of creating 
multiple incompatible design systems. IMHO a revised FFS should be finished 
and ready to go **before** T5 hits the streets (not that it has to be released, but 
it has to be finished). The design system is a core mechanic (just like the task 
system, chargen etc). Its easier to start off with the complex system and dumb 
it down than to go the other way.

>What do you consider broken about TNE combat?
Both TNE and T4:
	damage is not severe enough! You can\'t kill someone with a .22 cal...

TNE, in specifics:
1)	difference in hit point capacity between NPC and PC
1.1)	PC damage is by location, while NPC\'s get a single track
1.2)	NPC\'s have fewer hits in their one track than flat average PC\'s
	have in the body.
2)	damage is too low. D6\'s (as per the examples in the book) are way
too low, unless you apply the quick kill rule to PC\'s (a nono, by the book)
2.1)	even bumping damage up to D10\'s still leaves PC\'s able to shrug off
most small arms except on exceptional hits.
3)	no interrupts.

T4, in specifics:
1)	totally based upon the (IMHO) totally broken task system.
2)	the 3dice damage limit was vague, poorly worded, and ill thought out.
3)	The damages are simply too low, even if you do throw out the 3d limit.

Personally, for many years I used striker/ahl. Then MT came out, and I use
it still. Yes, it could benefit from an initiative system much like
T2K/TNE\'s or T:2300\'s... but it works. A 22 CAN kill, and you can survive a
hit from an M60, and, given battle dress, maybe even a hit from a PGMP at
long ranges.

A specific example from a TNE game I was running (set in CT era):
Zhodani Jump marines board PC vessel (a Patrol Cutter, modified). Vargr
marine climbs into ductworks... Joey catches up to him. Shoot him 5 times
at range <2m, with a PGMP 13, and I was using d10\'s for damages. Vargr is
in combat armor-13. 2 hits to each leg, 2 to the body, and 1 to the tail.
The only body part in bad shape was the tail! Said Vargr then KICKED the
ZTM in the faceplate (of Battle Dress-14), and KILLED the ZTM with one
blow. Another PC in the party, a human specops officer (a general), could
do 11 dice with bare hands! We joked that he could hurt a tank that way....

T4: a shot from an ACR at short range, normal success, COULD NOT KILL an
average PC (It will drop him, but he\'ll live, assuming 7\'s in all stats.
Due to the 3d limit, max damage is 18 points, of the 21 required to kill
the PC.

MT: on an exceptional success, damage is multiplied. Sure, a 22 isn\'t going
to penetrate BDress, but a .556 Nato just might. An on marginal success it
is halved.... and post combat, each MT damage point becomes 1d to
attributes. It was slick, simple, almost elegant, and easy for me and my
(someitmes quite thickskulled) players to grasp. It beutifully represented
shock, adrenaline, and  stopping power with an elegant, memorable and
simple mechanic. THe Hits rating is for while the adrenaline lasts, then
the att damage is the long term limitations. Neither TNE nor T4 really have
any comparable functions in their mechanics. ANd then the Intterupt system,
which I love, for me became the base initiative system. The fact that
vehicles used the same scale damage points, the same penetration and damage
scales (altho they are 10 times that show, due to a typo), and starships
can use the same system made the system emminently more useful to me as a
GM. Almost makes me want to seek a liscence to do a "non-authoritative"
edition, focused on the timeline as tho virus never existed, but the
rebellion did, and the real strephon dies, basing the mechanics on MT, but
adding all the goodies from FF&S1, and Hard Times (One small step and two
small steps).

Based upon MWM\'s posted synopsis of T5, I\'ll save my money, unless I find
something INCREDIBLE in PN\'s copy when he gets it.

I do steal from T4, tho, two items.
1) the psionics system AS WRITTEN IN THE BASE BOOK.
2) the number of skills in CGen, including Background skills.

From TNE, I steal contacts and Initiative.

General Comments on Darmine Charecter Generation

Psionics - Darmine are no more likely to have Psionic ability than non
Darmine but are (unknown to non Darmine) somewhat more likely to have
received training in Psionics if they have the ability.  Darmine with
Psionic Ability are significantly more likely to have the Special
Psionic ability of Precognition than members of other human races.

Most Darmine Psionic Institutions are secret parts of Darmine
relgious/philosophical centers.  Apply a +2 DM to the roll to determine
if a Darmine planet has a Psi Institute and check for Pop 8 planets (at
the normal chance) as well.  Most Darmine Institutes would require
applicants to be Darmine and have skill in Philosophy/Darmine and
Language/Kadli.  Darmine Institutes would be exceedingly unlikely to
accept a nonhuman applicant.  The Intelligence agency of the Darmine
Merchantile Association, the Lineal, has some psionic operatives. 
Darmine Institutes would normaly check for abilities in this order:
Special, Awareness, Telepathy, Clairvoyance, Telekinesis, Teleportation.

    'body' => '             The Interstellar Wars (2110 AD to 2299 AD)

The Interstellar Wars were a lengthy series of conflicts between the young 
Terran Confederation and the ancient Vilani Empire (Ziru Sirka). Ultimately the 
Terrans were to triumph over the huge Ziru Sirka, but the outcome was never 
certain until the final years. The wars can be divided into three distinct periods: 
Early, Classic and Collapse.

During the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Wars (termed the Early period) the Vilani 
underestimated the Terrans, regarding them as little more than a well organised 
nest of pirates (an opinion in fact not too far from the truth); and thus failed to 
allocated adequate forces to deal with them. This miscalculation was indeed 
fortunate for the Terrans, as it allowed them time to organise themselves, copy 
the advanced Vilani technology and to build sufficient forces to face the Vilani 
provincial forces on an equal footing. The root cause of this miscalculation can 
be found in three simple factors. Firstly due to the vast linguistic, cultural and 
genetic diversity present on Terra (over 80% of Humanitis genetic pool can be 
found on Terra), throughout the 1st War the Vilani believed that they were facing 
a coalition of several minor branches of Humaniti rather than a single race. 
Secondly the Vilani could not realise the capacity for the Terrans to expand. 
Throughout their long history the Vilani had practiced various forms of 
population control and their limited biological technology had rendered many 
worlds impossible to colonise. Thus they just did not anticipate the rate at 
which the Terrans would expand when they started to reach into space. Thirdly 
the Vilani anticipated that the Terrans rate of technological advancement would 
be similar to their own gradual progress. Nothing in their experience had 
prepared them for a culture that could match their own in just 33 years. These 
factors combined to lead the Vilani to regard the Terrans as nothing more than 
a minor nuisance throughout the Early period.

The 4th through 7th Wars were a lengthy struggle during which the Vilani 
provincial forces attempted to hold the growing power of the Terran 
Confederation. These wars were marked by the slow erosion of the Vilani 
position coupled with the steady colonial expansion of the Terran Confederation 
to rimward. This is regarded as the Classic Interstellar Wars period (so called 
due to the fact that most commonly held opinions and assumptions about the 
wars come from this period). It is marked by a series of wars in which the 
Terrans would launch massive incursions into Vilani territory, only to find 
themselves overextended and forced back by stiffening Vilani resistance, 
resulting in a stalemate followed by a compromise peace settlement. This 
period includes the one war (the 4th) which the Vilani can be regarded as having 
won.

The final phase of the Wars covers the 8th, 9th and Nth Wars; and is termed the 
Collapse period. This period is marked by the rapid and total collapse of the 
Ziru Sirka; and the rebellion and defection of many of the Vilani subject races. 
The actions of the Terrans are almost secondary during this period, as the 
Vilani collapse had assumed a momentum all of its own. It is theorised that the 
prestige and authority of the Ziru Sirka was fatally compromised by its utter 
defeat at the hands of the Terrans in the 8th and 9th Wars and without it the 
Empire simply unravelled under the social pressures resulting from millennia of 
inertia. It appears extremely likely that the Ziru Sirka would have collapsed after 
the 8th War regardless of any Terran actions. In this respect the final Terran 
conquest of the Empire can be regarded as purely opportunistic. 

                The Origins of the Interstellar Wars

The Terrans first started to reach into space in 1957 AD. By the early years of 
the 21st Century the space around the Earth had become crowded and the 
tensions between the various nations of Earth over their rights was increasing 
to dangerous levels. Thus it was felt that an impartial body was required to 
control such matters as traffic control, allocation of radio frequencies, satellite 
orbits and the such like. To fill this role the United Nations Space Coordinating 
Agency was brought into being. Gradually, as the Terrans expanded further into 
space, UNSCAs responsibilities expanded with them. By the middle of the 21st 
Century, UNSCA had become the central regulatory body for space operations 
in the Solar System. During this period UNSCA had expanded its sphere of 
operations to include a large research component and it was this that was to 
change forever the course of Earths history. In 2087 AD a UNSCA research 
team at under the leadership of Dr Hans Waven in the Asteroid belt 
accidentally stumbled upon the secret of jump drive (called Waven Hyperspace 
Shunt Drive or WHS Drive by the Terrans throughout the Interstellar Wars 
period).

Initially the poor understanding the Terrans had of hyperspace and gravitic 
sciences generally meant that these early drives were woefully inefficient and 
lacking in range. The algorithms used by the Terrans were based largely on 
observational experience rather than a sound understanding of jump space 
theory; and consequently their deficiencies were greatly magnified with 
increasing distance, effectively limiting the range of these early WHS Drives to 
30 AU. Despite these inefficiencies, the new WHS Drives were widely used for 
intrasystem travel and they contributed greatly to the opening up of the solar 
system in the later years of the 21st century. Part of the savings in travel times 
made possible by the WHS Drives were paid back to UNSCA as royalties, 
greatly contributing to the UNs budget leading to its eventual financial freedom 
from Earths nation states. This was to prove vital; for the later years of the 21st 
century were marked by increasing tensions between the blocs on Earth (the 
nation states had largely been replaced in importance by multinational trading 
blocs during the first half of the 21st century). The new frontier of the space 
became yet another sphere for these rivalries and this lead inevitably to the 
militarisation of space in during the second half of the 21st century.

However it was inevitable that someone would eventually attempt to use these 
WHS Drives to reach the stars despite their apparently limited range. Near the 
end of the century the algorithms used to calculate jumps had been improved 
by trial and error to the stage where travel to the stars had become possible. 
During the last decade of the 21st century Earths power blocs were fully 
involved in a race to reach the stars. In 2093 AD President Margaret Inch of the 
United States set the United States Space Force (USSF) the task of reaching 
the stars. The first step was the establishment of the Alan Shepard Deep 
Space depot between Terra and Barnards Star. In 2096 AD, the USSF 
completed the Starleaper I, a long range scoutship fitted with the latest 
generation of WHS Drives; hence the scene was set for the first contact 
between the Terrans and the Vilani at Barnards Star. Thus the Starleaper 
mission, intended as a triumphant demonstration of US technology, returned in 
secret to a closed session of the UN security council, bringing incontrovertible 
evidence that they had encountered not only aliens, but that these aliens were 
Humans.

Contact with the Vilani was to have a profound effect on the Terrans; prior to the 
mission there had been much discussion as to the nature of a theoretical alien 
civilisation, but no one on Earth had even considered the possibility of a 
Human alien civilisation. The Terrans entered a period of culture shock, 
unsure just what to make of the Vilani; most Terrans regarded the Vilani as a 
threat, though initial a substantial minority did call for an accommodation to be 
reached and some (particularly amongst the followers of the New Age Mystic 
religions) even sought to join the superior Ziru Sirka. However as the evidence 
mounted of the Vilanis policy of forcible incorporation of any race that reached 
the stars and it became clear that the Vilani culture was almost diametrically 
opposed to that of the majority of Earths citizens, attitudes hardened and the 
Terrans became increasingly antagonistic towards the Vilani. The military build 
ups of the late 21st century continued and the various power blocs on Earth vied 
with each other to lead Earth against the Vilani menace. Faced with the 
overwhelming size and technological advantage of the Ziru Sirka the Terrans 
responded with a crash program to match or acquire Vilani technology either by 
research or simply reverse engineering purchased or stolen examples. By and 
large this program was successful and by the outbreak of the First Interstellar 
War the Terrans had already achieved tech level 10 in a number of crucial fields 
(drives and computers), though certain technologies (most notably in the field of 
gravitics and related technologies) were to remain poor throughout the period.

                        The Barnard Incident

By 2110 AD the Terrans had established a substantial presence on Barnard, 
exploiting the rich mineral deposits and building what was to become an 
important colony. Naturally Sharurshid (the Vilani corporate Bureau responsible 
for the rimward provinces) viewed this as a clear violation of their commercial 
rights. Matters were not helped by the fact that the Terrans advanced biological 
technologies made their operations far more efficient. Over the first decade of 
the 22nd century tensions between the Terrans and the Vilani over Barnard had 
been gradually increasing. To the Vilani, it was intolerable that these minor 
races from Kheraa (Terra) should blatantly infringe on their commercial 
interests; to the Terrans the shear size and power of the Ziru Sirka bred fear 
and resentment.

Against this background the hawks amongst Earths nations built up their 
military strength on Barnard; whilst cooler heads amongst the Terrans 
attempted to negotiate an understanding. These negotiations turned out to be 
doomed from the start. Not only did each of the major Terran power blocs 
demand an independent voice in the negotiations; the Terrans just could not 
understand why the local Vilani negotiators constantly had to refer every single 
point to their superiors. To the Terrans, it appeared that the Vilani were 
deliberately obstructing negotiations. Nor could the Vilani understand the 
Terrans impatience; to them it appeared that the Terrans were just using them 
as a diversion while they took over Barnard by a fait accompli.

As both the Vilani and the Terrans reinforced their military presence around 
Barnard, tensions grew, tempers shortened and incidents increased in 
frequency. In 2110 AD a Sharurshid merchant convoy strayed into Terran 
airspace; in itself nothing too serious, this sort of incident had occurred 
countless times before. However this time was slightly different. Four weeks 
previously an armed Vilani merchant had fired warning shots at a Terran 
patrolship in a disputed zone and the previous patrolships drawn from the 
European Union had just been rotated out in for those of the Western League 
(the most hawkish of Earths power blocs at that time). Thus when the Vilani 
merchant failed to respond correctly to the UNSCA traffic control the Western 
League patrolship Canberra fired several warning shots in an attempt to force 
the convoy to land in Terran controlled territory. The convoy returned fire and 
attempted to flee as the Canberra gave pursuit. At this point a Sharurshid 
Gadni Type 56m escort arrived on the scene and opened fire on the Canberra. 
A brief running battle ensued which resulted in the destruction of the escort. 
During the final stages of this skirmish, the Vilani ground defences had 
engaged and damaged the Canberra. As a result of this the local Western 
League commander determined to neutralise the Vilani outpost on Barnard with 
a rapid ground assault. This failed, both sides reinforced their positions and the 
First Interstellar War had begun.

    'body' => '            First Interstellar War (2110 AD to 2118 AD)

The war started accidentally over a minor incident on Barnard. Initially the Vilani 
Diikagkarunii (provincial governor) paid little attention to it, deploying most of 
her limited forces in an attempt to counter the Terrans commerce raiding rather 
than concentrating sufficient forces to invade the Terrans territory. By 
comparison the Terrans were frantically committing everything they had to the 
war, whilst desperately attempted to close the technological gap between 
themselves and the Vilani. The Terrans quickly expelled the Vilani from Barnard 
and the fighting settled down to an attritional battle as the Vilani were content 
for the most part to contain the frequent Terran attacks; themselves only 
launching the occasional offensive attempting to breakthrough the Terran 
perimeter. None of these Vilani offensives contained sufficient forces to defeat 
the Terran defenders and the Terrans were able to repulse them all, even 
though they took a heavy toll on their forces. During the later years of the war 
the Terrans realised that they were unable to face the Vilani in open battle. As 
a result of this weakness they concentrated their efforts on commerce raiding, 
the one area they had achieved success in. The Vilani have not encountered an 
opponent able to range so deeply into their territory before and failed to take 
adequate counter measures. Eventually these raids began to result in 
significant economic dislocation and the Vilani governor, concerned at the 
continuing drain on the provinces economy made peace in 2118 AD, conceding 
Terran control over Barnard.

            Second Interstellar War (2133 AD to 2138 AD)

With the end of the 1st War the Diikagkarunii chose to almost completely ignore 
the Terrans (much as she had done during the war). Intelligence gathered 
during the war suggested that they would pose no threat for some considerable 
time to come and the matter was simply referred to higher authorities within 
Sharurshid. A curious form of detente evolved as independent Terran traders 
found that they could serve the Vilani frontier worlds far better than could 
Sharurshids rigid trade routes. Though this trade was officially banned, these 
Free Traders quickly came to dominate trade with those frontier systems and 
Terran products supplanted traditional goods on those worlds. Initially the 
Diikagkarunii turned a blind eye to this, but in 2127 AD she was replaced and 
the new Diikagkarunii found this gross invasion of Sharurshids markets 
intolerable. At first he attempted to simply get the offending worlds to respect 
the established monopoly. When this proved unsuccessful he elected to use 
military means to remove the competitor.

The Diikagkarunii launched a surprise offensive aimed at reducing Barnard. 
However the Vilani intelligence had seriously underestimated Terran strength. 
The Terrans had by this time equalled the Vilani technologically and brought 
their forces under a single strong central command. The initial offensive was 
easily contained and in 2135 AD, the Terrans launched a counter-offensive at 
Agidda. The Vilani response was deficient and the Terrans captured Agidda in 
2136 AD. The Terrans followed up their success at Agidda with an attack on 
Nusku. The local Vilani forces put up a heroic resistance here and the Terrans 
offensive was stalled. The Vilani then launched a counter-offensive aimed at 
Fenris, but this was defeated with some difficulty by the Terrans (having 
suffered heavy loses at Nusku). Again throughout the war, the Terrans launched 
many deep penetration raids into Vilani space; and with the war stalemated, 
the Vilani made peace in 2138 AD, ceding Agidda to the Terrans.

            Third Interstellar War (2146 AD to 2158 AD)

The Diikagkarunii was humiliated by the Terran victory in the 2nd War and had 
failed to achieve his basic aim of eliminating the Terrans as competitors. Over 
the next eight years he rebuilt his strength with the intention of renewing 
hostilities. In 2146 AD he launched simultaneous offensives aimed at Fenris 
and Agidda. The thrust at Fenris was held with some difficulty, but the Agidda 
offensive was successful and the Terrans were forced back to Barnard. Barnard 
fell to the Vilani in 2148 AD and the Vilani moved to attack Terra directly in 
early 2149 AD. This proved to be a miscalculation on the part of the Vilani, as it 
incited near fanatical resistance from the Terrans. The Vilani were defeated and 
forced from Terra in mid 2149 AD with heavy losses. By this stage both sides 
had suffered severe loses and paused to regroup. This phoney war period 
lasted until late 2151 AD when the Vilani (reinforced by Sharurshid central 
reserve troops for the first time) again attacked Fenris. Whilst not able to take 
Fenris, the Vilani were successful in besieging it and moved on to attack 
Junction in the middle of 2152 AD.

The Battle of Junction was the turning point of the 3rd War. The Vilani Fleet 
was defeated and scattered in late 2152 AD and the Terrans moved on to lift 
the siege of Fenris in 2153 AD. In mid 2153 AD the Terrans launched a 
diversionary attack at Barnard. The diversion was successful and the Vilani 
diverted significant forces to hold Barnard. In early 2154 AD the Terrans 
launched their major offensive using Sirus as a base. With most of their forces 
tied up at Barnard, the Vilani were woefully unprepared for this attack. In little 
more than 8 months the Terrans had seized Shulimik, Iilike and Markhash. The 
Terrans then transferred the weight of their forces to the Barnard Front; and had 
recaptured both Barnard and Agidda by late 2154 AD.

With their perimeter secured the Terrans then moved on to attempt to seize the 
important high population world of Nusku. The assault was launched in the 
second quarter of 2155 AD but the defenders of Nusku proved to be no less 
capable than they had been during the 2nd War and the word did not fall until 
late in 2156 AD. The battle for Nusku had seriously drained the Terrans forces 
and allowed the Vilani to regroup. By this stage neither side had sufficient 
forces to mount any serious offensives and the war bogged down into an 
attritional struggle in which the Terran commerce raiders took a heavy toll. 
Finally the War became troublesome enough to warrant the attention of the 
Sharurshids central management; and in early 2158 AD the Diikagkarunii was 
replaced and his replacement, eager to end the costly war, ceded the entire 
Sol subsector to the Terrans in return for peace.

            Fourth Interstellar War (2185 AD to 2191 AD)

The 3rd War was followed be a lengthy but uneasy period of peace that came to 
be known as the Empty Peace. During this period the Terrans, confident after 
their victories in the Early wars, embarked on an extensive program of colonial 
expansion, both into the newly acquired Vilani worlds and to the virgin worlds to 
rimward. This allowed Sharik Yangila, the new Diikagkarunii, the time to 
radically reshape the forces at her disposal. She obtained permission from the 
Sharurshids central management to construct large numbers of radically new 
ships based around large spinal mounts after the Terran pattern (the so called 
Attack Cruisers). New tactical methods were introduced to deal with the 
Terrans close range attacks. Rear area patrols were expanded and deployed in 
depth in an attempt to deal with Terran commerce raiders. Extensive 
intelligence work built up a detailed picture of the Terrans weaknesses and 
preparations were made to capitalise on these. In 2185 AD the Vilani were 
ready to strike.

The initial Vilani assault fell on Nusku. The Terran response proved inadequate 
and the world was quickly overrun. Rather than turn towards the heart of the 
Confederation, Yangila chose to drive to liberate Ishimshulgi and Lagash. This 
unorthodox drive caught the Terrans by surprise and was a brilliant success. 
By 2186 AD the Terrans had suffered heavy casualties and both worlds had 
been lost. With the coreward portions of the Sol subsector secured, Yangila did 
not repeat the mistake of the previous war and threaten Terra itself, but rather 
turned her attentions towards the Terran occupied worlds in the Dingir 
subsector. In 2187 AD the focus was shifted to Iilike. By this stage the Terrans 
had started to come to grips with the changed Vilani methods; and with some 
difficulty the Iilike offensive was held. This minor setback was to prove 
disastrous for Yangila, as her enemies within the province seized on the 
opportunity to bring about her downfall. As the Terrans rebuilt their strength the 
new Vilani commander failed to regain the initiative and the war bogged down 
into an attritional fight around the Terran perimeter at Iilike and Agidda. With the 
Terrans usual long range commerce raids slowly regaining their former 
effectiveness, this form of warfare eventually proved to be too costly for the 
Vilani to sustain. In 2191 AD a negotiated settlement was reached with the 
Vilani regaining the coreward portion of the Sol subsector.

            Fifth Interstellar War (2203 AD to 2213 AD)

Still smarting from their defeat in the 4th War, the Terrans took advantage of a 
minor border incident to renew hostilities. In 2203 AD they launched an 
offensive aimed at retaking the worlds lost in the 4th War. The Terran strategy 
was not aimed at directly reconquering the worlds, rather isolating them and 
reducing them at leisure. The initial Terran target was Nusku which fell after a 
brief siege. Then rather than turning to trailing as the Vilani expected, the 
Terrans drove into the Dingir subsector taking Apishal and Zaggisi in 2203 AD, 
thereby establishing a strong defensive position. Only then did the Terrans 
focus their attentions on the coreward worlds in the Sol subsector. Whilst 
holding of the Vilani in Dingir, the Terrans reduced these worlds one by one 
over the next 3 years. During this period, the Vilani launched a number counter-
offensives aimed at relieving their possessions in the Sol subsector, however 
the Terrans held off each one (albeit with some difficulty). With the Sol 
subsector secure, the Terrans turned again to Dingir. In 2207 AD they moved 
against Shuruppak and Meshan. Both these worlds fell with little struggle and 
the Terrans drove deeper into Dingir. However they were then starting to 
overreach themselves. In 2210 AD the Terrans reached Kinunir. Their defeat at 
the Battle of Kinunir marked the high water mark of the Terran advance in the 
5th War. Over the course of the next 3 years the Vilani gradually pushed the 
Terrans back. By this stage the war was proving to be a strain on both parties 
economies and in 2213 AD a treaty was negotiated in which the Terrans 
regained the worlds they had lost in the 3rd War.

    'body' => '            Sixth Interstellar War (2221 AD to 2231 AD)

The 6th War opened with a Vilani attempt to outflank the Terrans. Their initial 
offensive was launched from the Vega subsector using a deep space refuelling 
depot to extend the range of their fleet. This enabled them to attack Lagash 
directly from Shulgiasu. The strategy did catch the Terrans off guard, who had 
expected any attack to fall in the Dingir subsector and Lagash fell in late 2221 
AD. However the Vilani strategy proved to be deeply flawed. As the Vilani 
attempted to push on toward Ishimshulgi and Nusku, they found that with their 
supply lines totally dependent on the deep space depot, they could not gather 
sufficient forces to reduce Ishimshulgi. By 2223 AD the Terrans had halted their 
offensive and forced them back to Lagash. Lagash was to prove to be a 
weeping sore in the Vilani war effort during the 6th War. The Terrans never made 
a concerted effort to retake the world, but were well contented to just bleed off 
Vilani strength as they tried to hold the world. Eventually the Vilani recognised 
the futility of this front and in 2228 AD they abandoned Lagash.

In the meantime, events had not remained static on other fronts. In 2224 AD 
the Terrans launched an offensive into the Dingir subsector. This offensive was 
aimed directly at the important high population world of Gashidda. Shuruppak 
and Enki Kalamma both fell in 2224 AD and the Terrans gathered their strength 
for an assault on Gashidda itself. The Siege of Gashidda lasted for most of 
2225 AD and into 2226 AD. Eventually the world finally fell to the Terrans, but 
not before the Terrans had suffered significant losses. With Gashidda secured, 
the Terrans drove deeper into Vilani territory. Shilgiili and Kinunir fell in 2227 
AD, and Shulgi and Meshan in 2228 AD. However by this stage the Terrans 
losses were mounting alarmingly and with the Vilani withdrawal from Lagash in 
2228 AD they were able to significantly reinforce the Dingir front. The weakened 
and overstretched Terrans were unable to hold their gains and by 2230 AD the 
Vilani had retaken Shilgiili, Kinunir and Shulgi. By this stage the war had taken 
a heavy toll on both sides and the more moderate elements in both camps 
were calling for a peace treaty. A treaty was negotiated in 2231 AD with the 
Terrans retaining Enki Kalamma, Shuruppak, and Meshan; and the Vilani 
regaining Gashidda.

           Seventh Interstellar War (2237 AD to 2244 AD)

The end of the 6th War proved to be only a brief respite as both sides furiously 
rebuilt their strength. The period between the 6th and 7th Wars was more like an 
uneasy truce than a time of peace. Both sides engaged in frequent raids and 
there were numerous skirmishes during this period. In 2237 AD the expected 
7th War began. The opening move was a Vilani attack on Enki Kalamma. The 
world fell in late 2237 AD and the Vilani drove on to Shuruppak, which fell in 
2238 AD. Iilike was the next Vilani target. By this stage however, the Terran 
defence was starting to stiffen significantly. The Vilani were unable to take Iilike 
and when the Terrans launched an offensive towards Apishal they were forced 
to abandon the siege. Apishal and Zaggisi fell to the Terrans in 2239 AD. From 
there the Terrans drove on to Karkhar with the aim of reopening a link to 
Meshan. Karkhar fell in 2240 AD, but by this stage the Vilani had transferred 
sufficient forces to hold the line. However they did not anticipate the rate at 
which the Terrans could shift the weight of their offensive and in 2241 AD the 
Terrans were again on the offensive using Iilike as a base. Faced with pressure 
on two fronts and with the Terran technological advantage becoming quite 
marked, the Vilani finally buckled. In 2242 AD the Terrans retook Shuruppak, 
Enki Kalamma and Shilgiili. The Terrans had learnt the lessons of the 5th and 
6th Wars and were careful not to overextend themselves again. The war settled 
down to another prolonged attritional struggle were the traditional Terran 
commerce raiding tactics wore down the Vilani will to continue the war. The war 
was to drag on like this for another 2 years before the Vilani yielded and ceded 
the trailing half of the Dingir subsector to the Terrans in 2244 AD.

            Eighth Interstellar War (2266 AD to 2270 AD)

The 7th War was followed by the so called "Long Peace". Both sides had been 
heavily drained by the efforts of the 6th and 7th Wars; and neither was keen to 
renew hostilities quickly. However, this lengthy period of peace was to favour 
the Terrans far more than the Vilani. With the relative stability of the Long 
Peace substantial colonies were established to rimward, the former Vilani 
worlds were absorbed into the mainstream of Confederation culture and most 
importantly; industry was rationalised and the technological advances of the 
previous 150 years fully utilised for the first time.

Finally however the 8th War came in 2266 AD. The war opened with a Vilani 
attack on Karkhar. The attack proved to be misjudged. The Terran defences 
were far stronger than the Vilani had anticipated and the Vilani forces badly 
lead. In 2267 AD the Terrans commenced their counter-offensive. Shulgi and 
Kinunir fell quickly in 2267 AD. Launching a faint towards Gashidda, the 
Terrans turned and seized Dingir in 2267 AD. This threw the Vilani into 
confusion; and provided the opportunity for Admiral Albadawi to launch his 
master plan. He gambled on the Vilani being unable to react quickly to a 
change in Terran focus and moved to seize and fortify Enulsur (now Oudh). 
Taking possibly the biggest gamble of the wars, he took the bulk of the Terran 
fleet and in 2268 AD he reduced Gaea, Tonopah and Duriim. This manoeuvre 
totally outflanked the Vilani and left their entire fleet cut off and stranded at 
Gashidda. The Vilani tried franticly to break out of this pocket but the Terran 
line held and the Vilani fleet was to remain impotent throughout the rest of the 
war.

In the meantime the Terrans took advantage of the absence of the Vilani fleet to 
reduce many of the now vulnerable Vilani worlds. Without the provincial fleet to 
protect them the entire rimward provinces lay open to invasion. Within nine 
months the Terrans had occupied no less than twelve new worlds and had laid 
siege to another four. The Terrans advance was greatly assisted when in Early 
2269 AD the Vegans revolted against their Vilani overlords and established the 
Vegan Polity. The Terrans immediately declared the infant Vegan Polity to be a 
Terran protectorate and dispatched forces to assist the Vegans. By 2270 AD 
the entire rimward province lay open to Terran invasion and the Diikagkarunii 
sued for peace. In the subsequent Treaty of Enulsur, the Vilani recognised the 
Terran protectorate over the Vegans and surrendered all territory rimward of 
Vega to the Terrans.

            Ninth Interstellar War (2274 AD to 2280 AD)

With the crushing defeat in the 8th War, the Igsiirdi (central Vilani ruling council) 
finally took notice. Substantial forces were dispatched to the Rim and 
preparations were made to finally put an end to the Terran menace. However 
the Terrans struck first. Utilising their newly developed jump 3 drives (deployed 
experimentally in limited numbers at the end of the 8th War) the Terrans struck 
through the weakly defended trailing flank, outflanking the Vilani forward 
positions and destroyed the Vilani fleet in detail. The Vilani were thrown into a 
panic; the remnants of the provincial forces, already severely demoralised after 
the 8th War collapsed, whilst the newly arrived central forces were totally at a 
loss to cope with the deep penetration and raiding tactics of the Terrans. The 
newly developed Terran meson guns further added to the Vilani defeat and the 
slow retreat turned into a virtual rout. In response to the rapidly deteriorating 
situation, the Igsiidri repeatedly dispatched substantial reinforcements only to 
have them disintegrate in the face of the Terrans. In desperation the newly 
arrived central forces attempted to adopt the tactical methods used 
successfully by the provincial forces, only to find that their incomplete 
understanding of these methods only made matters worse. By 2278 AD the 
Vilani were retreating on all fronts and on the verge of a complete collapse.

By 2279 AD the Terrans had almost driven the Vilani from the sector. However 
the Terran Confederation government was concerned at the rate of advance, 
with the forwards elements of their forces being virtually out of control. In 2280 
AD the Confederation government called a halt to the offensive and announced 
they were ready to bring an end to hostilities. The Vilani were by this stage 
desperate and gladly accepted the opportunity for a respite. In 2280 AD a 
settlement was negotiated that ceded the entire sector to the Terrans.

             Nth Interstellar Wars (2283 AD to 2299 AD)

The Confederation\'s fears about maintaining control of it\'s forces proved to be 
well founded. In 2283 AD a minor incident on the frontier sparked the beginning 
of the Nth Wars. Initially the Confederation only intended to use the opportunity 
to seize a few strategic border worlds to strengthen the frontier. However the 
time delay between the front and central command prevented the government 
from ever gaining control of the fleet. As the Vilani collapsed in front of the 
advancing Terrans, local commanders were constantly presented with 
opportunities too good to ignore. Many historians have commented on the fact 
that it took the Terrans 16 years to finally defeat the Vilani was more due to the 
fact that the Terrans could not keep up with the rout more than any resistance 
from the Vilani. The entire period of the Nth Wars is confusing; to all intents and 
purposes the Ziru Sirka had ceased to exist by around 2287 AD. The bulk of 
the Nth Wars were fought by local Vilani commanders and worlds with little or 
no reference or support from their higher government. On the Terran side the 
continually lengthening lines of communications prevented the Confederation 
from exercising effective control of their forces.

The Nth Wars were a period of unprecedented chaos throughout the Ziru Sirka 
Not only were the Terrans advancing through the Empire sweeping all before 
them, but the Vargr were pillaging and conquering the coreward provinces and 
many of Vilani subject races seized the opportunity to rebel against their former 
masters. These rebellions often took place with great ferocity as many of these 
minor races took the opportunity to settle old scores dating back to the 
ruthless Vilani actions in the Consolidation Wars. On many worlds Terrans 
were actually greeted with open arms as a welcome alternative to the chaos 
that appeared to be engulfing the Empire. This was especially true in the 
coreward provinces were the Terrans were seen as a bulwark against the Vargr 
incursions. The setting of the end of the Nth Wars is a purely arbitrary date 
based on the surrender of the Sirkakarun on Vland on 14th September 2299 AD. 
In fact the fighting continued for at least four years after this date as some 
Vilani continued fighting either from a sense of honour, denying the inevitable, 
or simply because they did not know the Wars were over. However by 2303 AD 
the Wars were over and the Terran Confederation was left in control of the Vilani 
Empire.

    'body' => '                      The Terran Confederation

The Terran Confederation grew out of the old Earth bound United Nations. Due 
to the revenues generated by UNSCA, by the time of the First Interstellar War 
the UN was largely free of its former reliance on contributions from the individual 
nations of Earth for its budget. With the growth of a truly global economy 
coupled with the massive improvement in worldwide communications at the end 
of the 20th century the individual nation state lost much of its importance. 
However the various nations of Earth clung grimly to their sovereignty and 
nationalism was a major factor in Earth politics during the later 20th and early 
21st centuries; to the extent that several previously stable nation states were 
torn apart by regional nationalism. Indeed the two strongest trends in this era 
were the rise in nationalism and the tendency towards globalisation through the 
various power blocs that were slowly evolving. By the end of the 21st century 
most nations on Terra had grouped themselves into larger trading blocs (the 
European Union, the Asian Confederation, the Pacific Rim Alliance etc).

Thus the first war was not fought by a single unified Terran command, but by 
the forces of Earths various nations under the tenuous coordination of the 
United Nations. By the end of the First War it was clear that this situation 
could not continue. To have any chance of survival against even the Vilani 
provincial fleet, the Terrans would have to utilise their resources to the full and 
place all of their forces under a strong central command. Thus in 2120 AD the 
United Worlds (with the admission of the Terran colony on Alpha Centauri in 
2118 AD, the United Nations had been renamed) became the Terran 
Confederation. Naturally this aroused some strong opposition amongst the 
various nation states who still jealously guarded their sovereignty (especially 
true of the smaller nations). However a clever media campaign portrayed the 
First Interstellar War as a great triumph and stressed the need for cooperation 
in the face of the common enemy. Meanwhile the new Confederations more 
vocal opponents were quietly arrested and deported to the new rimward 
colonies. Those colonies did not oppose the formation of the Confederation and 
the subsequent loss of their autonomy due to fear of losing their protection from 
the Vilani Menace.

Initially the new Confederations powers were strictly limited to military matters, 
but gradually the Confederation evolved into a proper interstellar government. In 
2125 AD the various national militaries were incorporated into a single 
Confederation Army and Navy, in 2131 AD the Secretariat was given the power 
to directly legislate taxation, in 2140 AD the Secretariat was given the power to 
legislate on matters that affected more than one nation. The final change came 
in 2150 AD when the Security Council was abolished and the Secretary 
General was acknowledged as the executive leader of all the nations of the 
Terran Confederation. The Terran government remained largely unchanged 
throughout the Interstellar Wars (in 2179 AD a measure of local autonomy was 
restored to the individual colony worlds); the General Assembly was retained 
as a generalised debating forum in which all nations and worlds were 
represented equally, but legislative power over all worlds was retained by the 
Secretariat. Thus while the Confederation was theoretically a multiworld 
democracy, it was to remain dominated by Terran interests until it was 
dissolved by Admiral Estigarrbia in 2314 AD and replaced by the military 
dictatorship that was to become the Rule of Man.

Despite its ultimate demise, the Confederation drew on elements of all of 
Earths many diverse cultures in its make up. The western ideals regarding 
progress, innovation and individualism allowed it to equal and surpass several 
thousand years of Vilani technological achievement in just 200 years; whilst the 
eastern ideals regarding duty, family and community allowed it to single 
mindedly apply itself and thus defeat and eventually conquer the vast Ziru 
Sirka. Indeed this very cultural diversity was to play a vital role in the 
Confederations survival during the early wars. When the Terrans first contacted 
the Ziru Sirka the bewildering array of nations and cultures convinced the Vilani 
that they were facing a loose alliance of several minor Human races. Thus the 
Ziru Sirka believed that Earth was simply a forward staging post for a pocket 
Empire located further to rimward. Thus Earth came to be characterised in the 
mind of Vilani strategists as a nest of pirates from some unknown civilised 
region far towards the rim.

                           Terran Culture

Terran culture was profoundly changed by the initial contact with the Vilani and 
the subsequent Interstellar Wars. At the beginning of the Wars the dominant 
Terran culture was the liberal western culture that had developed in Western 
Europe and the United States of America. This culture emphasised the needs 
of the individual and encouraged innovation (and thus was almost diametrically 
opposed to the Vilani). Unlike virtually all other interstellar cultures of the 
period, the Terran culture actively embraced change and progress as a goal in 
and of itself; this was to prove to be one of the Terrans greatest assets, 
enabling them to catapult from TL 9 to TL 12 in just 200 years.

However under the pressure of the Interstellar Wars, the Terran culture was to 
undergo some major changes. As the Wars progressed, the pressures of the 
struggle inevitably lead to the Terran culture gradually becoming more austere, 
conservative and militaristic, increasingly drawing on its eastern heritage with 
its strong emphasis on duty and community; but it was never to totally lose its 
liberal and individualistic character. However along with these changes, the 
Terrans came to emphasis their cultural traditions that set them apart from the 
Vilani. Thus even though the Interstellar Wars forced the peoples of the Earth to 
finally see themselves as single people, they also saw a great emphasis on 
local cultural traditions. An example of this is that although English evolved to 
become the universal language of the Terrans (known as Anglic), the period 
also witnessed a great revival of many older ethnic tongues (including many 
supposedly dead languages such as Mayan, Cornish, Chinook, Motu etc). The 
other great change that occurred was the eventual death of many of the old 
prejudices that had plagued the Terrans for so long. When the Terrans came to 
see themselves as one people the many of the old social scourges such as 
racism and sexism dropped by the wayside.

This tolerant and liberal culture was to prove to be a great asset for the Terrans 
throughout the Interstellar Wars. For over 2000 years the Vilani had ruled over 
their subject races by a policy of assimilation and force. The Vilani were utterly 
ruthless in the conduct of warfare, relying on simple theories of cost efficiency. 
Any resistance or rebellion would be met with overwhelming force and no mercy 
would be shown (the Vilani did not take prisoners except in exceptional 
circumstances and had no hesitations in using genocide or weapons of mass 
destruction). Thus the Terrans with their highly structured concepts of humane 
warfare and their policy of tolerance for other races were welcomed as 
liberators by virtually all the Vilanis subject races. As the Terrans advanced 
they found many willing allies throughout the Ziru Sirka, many of whom would 
later be granted autonomy under the Rule of Man. Although this was not to be 
a major factor until the 8th and subsequent Wars, even in the early wars there 
were a few subject race units serving within the Terran military (the first such 
unit, the Vegan Legion, was formed in 2136 AD during the 2nd Interstellar War).

The period also saw a renaissance in Terran religion. Throughout the 20th and 
21st centuries the imminent demise of organised religion had been predicted by 
many Terran commentators. However these experts had not reckoned on the 
discovery of the Ziru Sirka; an event that forever changed the face of religion on 
Earth. The realisation that mankind was not alone in the universe strangely 
reinvigorated religious belief amongst the Terrans. By the end of the Wars the 
six great Terran religions (Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, 
Confucianism and New Age Mysticism) each had tens of billions of adherents 
including many non-Terrans and over 80% of the Confederations citizens were 
practising members of some organised religion.

                      Terran rimward Expansion

Whilst the Interstellar Wars apparently dominated the Terran Confederations 
policies, the period is also marked by a massive expansion into unexplored 
space by the Confederation. In reality, until the final Vilani collapse, this 
colonial expansion accounted for the majority of the Confederations growth. 
This expansion is usually referred to as the Terran rimward expansion, a 
name that is rather misleading as it also includes significant lateral colonisation 
to spinward and trailing. The key element of this colonisation was that it was 
directed towards areas not already controlled by the Ziru Sirka.

The rimward expansion resulted in much of the growth of the Confederation 
throughout this period. By 2160 AD, there were over 1,600 million Terrans living 
off Terra, by 2235 AD this had grown to more than 17,500 million (compared 
with the 17,200 million living on Terra itself and the 6,000 million absorbed 
Vilani in the former Ziru Sirka territories). By 2300 AD, these colonials made up 
over 75% of the Confederations Terran and absorbed Vilani population (roughly 
160 billion at that time). However, they remained chronically under represented 
in the Secretariat throughout the period; a situation that was to ultimately result 
in Estigarrbias coup and the downfall of the Confederation.

One of the more unusual facets of this expansion was the Terran 
Confederations policy of deliberately establishing settlements far beyond its 
conceivable sphere of influence. It is not know exactly how many of these 
colonies were established, since the entire project was shrouded in secrecy 
throughout the period, but hundreds of such colonies were established. Many of 
these settlements were established hundreds of parsecs away from the 
Confederation, well beyond its ability to administer or support and they 
consumed considerable resources for very little tangible return. These colonies 
were a form of long term insurance against the possibility of the Confederations 
defeat.

The agency responsible for these long range colonisation efforts was the 
Confederation Agency for the Preservation of Indigenous Cultures (CAPIC). Set 
up in 2124 AD in response to the fears of the smaller Terran nations regarding 
the loss of their cultural identities in the face of the expanding authority of the 
Confederation, CAPIC was charged with ensuring that the unique cultural 
heritage of Earth should be preserved regardless of the outcome of the Wars. 
Thus CAPIC embarked upon an ambitious program of long range colonisation. 
Many (though by no means all) of the colonists in the CAPIC program were 
drawn from Earths ethnic and linguistic minorities who already feared the loss 
of their identity in the rapidly evolving Confederation culture. It was a policy 
established by CAPICs first director (Dr Kenji Schwartz) that as many of 
Earths cultural and linguistic groups should be resettled; and that in an 
attempt to minimise any cultural contamination, each world was settled by 
only one cultural or linguistic group (Dr Schwartz lived in mortal terror of the 
loss or corruption of even one of Terras priceless linguistic treasures). In order 
to effect this policy, various methods were used to encourage groups to 
resettle. Most of these took the form of incentives (financial and otherwise), but 
CAPIC was not averse to using strong arm tactics if it proved necessary to 
encourage reluctant colonists to emigrate.

                    Terran Biomedical Technology

Throughout this period the one area of technology were the Terrans had a clear 
and unassailable advantage was in biological and medical technologies. Even 
at the time of the first contact the Terrans had a clear lead of several tech 
levels. The reasons for this advantage are not too hard to find. As the true 
homeworld of all Humaniti, Earth holds the greatest variety of life compatible 
with Humans. Thus the Terrans clearly fitted into the scheme of life on Earth; 
and there was a wealth of experimental subject matter that gave results 
relevant to Humans. However the most important factors was probably that, 
unlike the Vilani, the Terrans were exposed to vast numbers of hostile microbes 
every day and had to develop advanced biomedical technology simply to survive.

This advanced biomedical technology gave the Terrans a number of advantages 
over the Vilani. The Vilani never developed any technology equivalent to the 
Terrans cryogenic devices (low berths, food storage and the like). The Terrans 
had access to highly advanced drugs and medicines. The Terrans were able to 
genetically engineer Earth organisms to fulfil a great variety of roles, vastly 
increasing the viability and efficiency of their colonies. The Terrans were able to 
utilise terraforming to enable the colonisation of otherwise marginal worlds. 
Most Terran ships used a biologically based closed loop life support system, 
giving them far greater endurance than their Vilani counterparts. Terran 
computers used a synaptic architecture based on the human brain, greatly 
increasing their operational flexibility.

However the most well known product of this Terran biomedical technology was 
their biological warfare program. This is curious as the Terrans only employed 
these weapons once. During the 3rd War the Vilani employed nuclear weapons 
against Terran civilian targets on the colony world of Fenris. In retaliation the 
Terrans deployed a viral weapon against the Vilani world Shululsish. The virus 
proved to be more effective than the Terrans had envisioned; and within six 
weeks over 95% of Shululsishs population of 500 million had died either from 
the virus or the social collapse that accompanied it. This one solitary attack 
was to have far reaching consequences. The Vilani were terrified by this new 
weapon; its effectiveness and their lack of any defence or counter measures 
were quite clear. However, the attack also had consequences within the 
Confederation. There was a huge public outcry against the use of these 
weapons, it was only the pressures of the war that prevented the entire 
biological warfare program from being abandoned all together. However it was 
evident to the Confederation government that public opinion was very solidly 
against the use of these weapons and that there would be severe domestic 
consequences from any future deployment of biological weapons. As a result 
the Vilani and Terrans came to an informal understanding and neither side 
again deployed weapons of mass destruction against civilian targets.

Unfortunately the reluctance of the Terrans to employ their biological arsenal 
did not prevent the exposure of the Vilani to Terran diseases. It was inevitable 
that as the Terrans occupied a Vilani world, many of Earths hostile microbes 
would accompany them. As a result, the local Vilani population would be 
exposed to a plague of monumental proportions. It is a testimony to the 
Terrans dedication to their humanitarian roots (and their medical technologies) 
that, before the final collapse of the Ziru Sirka, on average only 5% to 10% of 
the local population died as a result of these plagues when the Terrans 
occupied a world. However with the final collapse, the Terrans occupied far 
more worlds than they could ever hope to deal with and the death toll from the 
plagues that swept through the former Ziru Sirka after the Interstellar Wars was 
far higher.

Both sides during the Wars had access to highly efficient intelligence services. 
On the Terran side there were the Gendarmerie who dealt with internal security 
and the Confederation External Intelligence Bureau (CEIB) for external 
operations. On the Vilani side there was Sharurshids highly efficient 
Ishimdagashii (Shadow Warriors)

Working notes  Vilani very good at this. Gendarmerie used against political 
dissidents. Some Vilani governors misused intassets.

                      The Terran Free Traders

One of the distinguishing features of the Interstellar Wars were the Free 
Traders, indeed it is generally accepted that they were a major factor in the 
ongoing tensions between the Terrans and Vilani. The Free Traders were 
independent Terran merchants who found a ready market for Terran goods 
amongst the Vilani frontier worlds. Whilst a few Free Traders could be found in 
the early years of the 22nd Century, they did not become a major factor until 
after the First Interstellar War. With the availability of large numbers of cheap 
surplus naval couriers and high tech Terran goods, the circumstances were 
right for a great flourishing of independent mercantilism.

The first Free Traders were collectives of former military personnel who had 
chosen to pool their mustering out benefits and use them as down payment on 
a surplus naval transport. This collective spirit was distinguish the Free 
Traders throughout the Interstellar Wars period; most crews would consists of a 
group of shareholders working for a share of the vessels profits (or losses). 
Extra crew members might be hired on an as needed basis, but most ships 
avoided this as it greatly increased their expenses. Their command structures 
were informal with most decisions being made by consensus. Most crews 
generally accepted one of their number as captain (many interstellar 
regulations of the time required a captain), but few had use for other ranks and 
titles.

Working notes  Why Terran goods penetrated Vilani markets. Vilani 
responses. Two sided Terran attitude to Free Traders.

The Vilani are one of the three major branches of Humaniti (the other two being 
the Zhodani and the Solomani or Terrans). All of these (and the over 40 other 
minor branches) originated on Terra. Approximately 300,000 BC the mysterious 
Ancients removed samples of Humans from Terra and deposited them on 
various worlds throughout space for reasons unknown. Those Humans 
deposited on Vland evolved into the Vilani. The prime feature of the evolution of 
the Vilani was their alieness from their environment. Whilst Vland was on the 
face of it a hospitable world for Human habitation, its biosphere was 
incompatible with Human biology. It was this alieness that was to play a 
fundamental role in the evolution of the Vilani. Because of differences in amino 
acids and basic proteins there was virtually no life on Vland which could act as 
a food source for the Vilani

The Ziru Sirka (Grand Empire of the Stars) was a massive interstellar state. At 
its height it encompassed over 15,000 star systems and included portions of 27 
sectors, even though most of these systems remained unexploited due to 
technological limitations (notably the poor Vilani biomedical technology). By 
the time of the Interstellar Wars the Ziru Sirka had long passed its prime and 
was well on the path towards its ultimate collapse. For over 1500 years the Ziru 
Sirka had remained a static entity, maintaining its control by ruthlessly 
enforcing cultural and technological rigidity. Eventually the Ziru Sirka faltered 
and when the Terrans defeated the central fleet in the 9th Interstellar War, its 
prestige and authority were fatally compromised. From that point onwards the 
fate of the Empire was sealed as their own population lost faith in the Ziru Sirka 
and their many disaffected subject races rebelled.

The Ziru Sirka has its origins in the earliest Vilani explorations into space. In 
4717 BC the Vilani discovered the secrets of Jump Drive (the first race to do so 
since the enigmatic ancients). With this new discovery the Vilani spread to the 
stars along the Vilani Main (a region of stars easily accessible with only jump 1 
capable ships). As they expanded they encountered many other races; none of 
whom possessed the secret of jump drives, most of whom were considerably 
less advanced technologically than the Vilani. Gradually advanced technology 
was spread to these new races by the Vilani. In the process they thus 
absorbed much of Vilani culture and came to be dominated economically by 
the Vilani. However, these client races then spread Jump drive to still more 
races who did not absorb Vilani culture and laws. This situation was intolerable 
to the Vilani as it directly threatened their supremacy. Their response was the 
forcible incorporation of all races who possessed jump drive into a single Vilani 
state; this period is known to history as the Consolidation Wars. These wars 
lasted for over 1300 years (882 BC to 473 AD) and by the end there were no 
more starfaring races on the Vilani borders. This is usually taken as the 
founding of the Ziru Sirka.

With the end of the Consolidation Wars the Vilani set about the task of 
consolidating their rule; this was achieved by imposing a strict regime of 
cultural rigidity and conformity. Thus the founding of the Ziru Sirka can also be 
seen as marking the beginning of the Vilanis cultural and technological 
stagnation. Despite the policy of rigidity, the Ziru Sirka retained a degree of 
vibrancy for some considerable time. Whilst exploration was halted in 518 AD 
and all research had come to a halt within another 200 years, the Ziru Sirka did 
continue to expand after this time. The prime reason for this expansion was the 
policy that came to be known as the Pax Vilanica. Despite the best efforts of 
the Vilani, technology continued to leak across the border and small interstellar 
states continued to form outside of the Ziru Sirka. Under the Pax Vilanica, the 
Vilani undertook to forcibly absorb all such states. Under this policy the Ziru 
Sirka reached its greatest extent in 1018 AD. Eventually however the Ziru Sirka 
lost either the will or ability to enforce the Pax Vilanica; by 800 AD its 
application had become irregular and had virtually ceased by 1300 AD. After 
that date the only expansion took the form of small outposts founded in search 
of resources (the Vilani settlement on Barnards Star was an example of this).

The Consolidation Wars came late to the rimward provinces, the Vegans were 
only incorporated into the Ziru Sirka in 114 AD. The region never attracted 
much official attention and remained a relative backwater until the Terrans 
crushing victory in the 8th Interstellar War. After the conquest of the Vegans the 
remainder of the region was ignored until 987 AD when a dissident group set up 
a minor state centred around Dingir. Eventually this state grew large enough to 
warrant action and in 1103 AD the Ziru Sirka expanded into the worlds 
immediately adjacent to Terra. After this the region again slipped back into 
obscurity until the Terrans contacted the Vilani outpost on Barnard in 2096 AD.

                           Vilani Culture

Traditional Vilani culture can best be described as being communal and 
conservative, the central planks of Vilani culture were tradition, stability and the 
needs of the community. The Vilani were an exceptionally harmonious and 
industrious people, most early Terran explorers were amazed at their 
politeness and the degree of consensus within their society. Where ever 
possible all decisions made by the Vilani were made by group consensus after 
lengthy discussion of all alternatives. However this was not possible and 
sometimes a quick decision was required. In such cases an individual was 
required to make the best decision for the interests of the community. However 
the individual making the decision would later have to justify their actions to a 
group review. The Vilani constantly planned for long term, attempting to allow 
variations for all possible contingencies based on their past experiences. 
Naturally they were unable to fully realise this goal, but when they were faced 
with unexpected circumstances they would attempt to find traditional solutions 
to them.

Vilani society was divided into numerous castes, each with a clearly defined 
place and role in Vilani society. These castes were originally based around a 
broad grouping of occupations such as: Warriors (Dagashii), Cultivators 
(Shimsii), Artisans (Rinugii) etc. As Vilani society increased in sophistication, 
these castes developed subcastes which over time evolved into castes in their 
own right. Of these many castes, three came to dominate and direct Vilani 
society. These were the Karunii (Nobles), Badenkii (Merchants) and the Shugilii 
(Food processors). It was from these three castes that the three governing 
Bureaux of the Ziru Sirka evolved.

The central institution of Vilani society was the family consisting of a mother, 
father, their apprentices and any juvenile children they might have had. A child 
would be assigned to their caste during their early childhood (usually before the 
age of 8), and often would then be adopted by a family of the correct caste 
(roughly 50% of children were assigned to castes different to their biological 
parents). The family would live in a communal setting either in or very near to 
their workplace with other members of their caste. The children would spend 
most of their time at their familys workplace, learning their chosen castes 
trade secrets as a lengthy apprenticeship. The child was then formally inducted 
into the cast during their Amkiidum (coming of age ceremony) at age 18. It was 
possible (though extremely rare) for an individual to change castes before their 
Amkiidum if they proved to be unsuited for their chosen caste. This lengthy 
childhood apprenticeship lead to an intimate understanding of the requirements 
of their profession and most Vilani were highly skilled in their jobs, however 
they generally lacked knowledge or experience outside of their specific caste 
requirements. This was especially true in respect of technology; to the Vilani 
the rights to develop and improve a technology were owned by the caste that 
had originally developed them (the heart of the Vilani Technology Patent 
system). Thus a Vilani engineer would have learned how to operate the various 
drives on his or her ship by rote and be extremely skilled in their operation. 
However they would not know the principles behind their operation, as this 
would infringe on the rights of the researcher caste that had developed them; 
and would therefore find it difficult to repair them unassisted in the event of 
failure. To overcome the very obvious limitations of this, the Vilani placed heavy 
reliance on expert diagnostic systems.

                            The Bureaux

Central to the Vilani way of life were the three Bureaux that governed the Ziru 
Sirka. These Bureaux were quasi-commercial organisations that had 
descended from the three dominant castes in pre-historic Vilani culture. The 
three Bureaux were Makhidkarun, which had descended from the Karunii 
(Nobles); Sharurshid, which had descended from the Badenkii (Merchants); and 
Naasirka, which had descended from the Shugilii (Food processors). Each of 
these Bureaux governed a specific territory within the Ziru Sirka and controlled 
virtually every aspect of life within their territories. The Terrans characterised the 
Bureaux as being simple corporations, and while there was some truth in this 
view, it failed to fully come to terms with the complex nature of the Bureaux.

The Bureaux were indeed commercial enterprises, but they were far more than 
simple Terran corporations. While each Bureau did control a particular field of 
commerce within the Ziru Sirka, they also provided governmental services 
within their territories. All of the citizens of the Ziru Sirka were employees of 
one of the Bureaux; and the Bureau provided for all their needs from the cradle 
to the grave. In return the employee was bound to their job and location for their 
entire life. The Terrans frequently likened this situation to that of the serfs in 
feudal Europe. Whilst this analogy has some degree of accuracy, it is 
important not to stretch it too far. While workers were bound to a particular job 
and location throughout their lives, there was no real noble elite; and the Vilani 
need for consensus and sense of community resulted in a paternalistic system 
with fair and equitable treatment for all.

Each of the Bureaux specialised in a differing area of interstellar trade and 
commerce depending on their origin and the technological patents they held. 
Makhidkarun with it origins in the Karunii emphasised information technology 
and governmental services; Sharurshid with its origins in the Badenkii 
emphasised trade and speculation. The exception was Naasirka. Naasirka had 
its origins in the Shugilii, who on Vland had controlled the food supply. 
Naturally this proved to be impossible on worlds other than Vland and for a 
period Naasirka floundered without any true direction. Eventually however 
Naasirka was able to transform itself into a broad based organisation with 
interests in transport, energy, agriculture and consumer goods. Originally on 
pre-spaceflight Vland there were numerous other commercial bodies dealing 
with the many other aspects of economic activity. But eventually these were all 
brought under the control of one of the three Bureaux and by the time the Vilani 
had reached out into space, all economic activity was directed by them.

The three Bureaux coordinated their activities through the Igsiirdi (Central ruling 
council). Initially the Igsiirdi was simply the means by which the three Bureaux 
debated matters of common interest, but with the start of the Consolidation 
Wars, the Igsiirdi was transformed into the central governing body of Vland and 
the Ziru Sirka. In practise it remained the coordinating body of the three 
Bureaux, as all the governmental functions were carried out by the Bureaux 
within their territories. One of the most vital functions of the Igsiirdi was in 
ensuring that each Bureaux and their products were represented within all the 
territories of the Ziru Sirka. For the most part this was achieved by cross 
licensing rather than a physical presence. Thus Naasirka products would be 
produced under licence by Sharurshid in the rimward provinces and likewise 
Sharurshid products would be licence produced by Naasirka within its 
territories. However these products were still marketed under the appropriate 
brand names throughout the Ziru Sirka. Within 10 years of the end of the 
Consolidation Wars the president of the Igsiirdi was proclaimed the Ishimkarun 
(Shadow Emperor). The Ishimkarun ruled by published decree, never appearing 
in public. Upon the death of one Ishimkarun, his or her successor would be 
elected from the ranks of the Igsiirdi. In 908 AD the Ishimkarun was declared 
the Sirkakarun (Emperor of the Stars). Gradually the control of the Sirkakarun 
and Igsiirdi weakened as the Diikagkarunii grew in strength. By 1718 AD local 
mutinies and insurrections by the Diikagkarunii were becoming increasingly 
common, some of these would seek to further their power by hiring and 
equipping barbarian mercenaries from beyond the Empire. These small border 
rebellions added to the slow decay of the Empire in its dying days.

              Vilani Colonisation Patterns in the Rim

The rimward provinces of the Ziru Sirka were placed under the control of the 
Sharurshid Bureau and the colonisation patterns followed those of Sharurshid 
throughout the Ziru Sirka. Sharurshid was concerned mainly with trade and 
speculation and as might be expected its colonisation programs reflected this. 
The region was first visited by Vilani influenced traders around 1500 BC when 
they made contact with the Vegans. The eventually received jump drives and 
other advanced technologies from these traders and by 800 BC they had 
colonised a number of nearby worlds. With the start of the Consolidation Wars 
it was inevitable that the Vilani would eventually seek to incorporate the 
Vegans. Since the Vegans were never a major interstellar power and their 
worlds were on the fringes of known space, the Consolidation Wars came late 
to the Vegans. Eventually however the Vilani did turn their attention to the 
Vegans and in 54 BC the Vilani Sharurshid was assigned the task of 
incorporating the Vegans.

The Sharurshid campaign against the Vegans followed a predictable pattern 
established by Sharurshid against countless other minor races. The first step 
was the establishment of Vilani colonies nearby to provide a base of 
operations. Not only did these colonies provide a base for military operations 
when they proved to be necessary, but they allowed Sharurshid to conduct 
aggressive economic warfare against the Vegans in an attempt to absorb them 
without resort to force. This opening phase in the Vegan Campaigns lasted until 
6 BC. By this stage the Vilani plan had become quite apparent to the Vegans 
and they tensions between them and Sharurshid had been on the increase for 
some time. A minor incident sparked a clash of arms that turned into a full 
scale war. The First Vegan War lasted only 8 years before it was clear to 
Sharurshid that they could not yet triumph over the Vegans. As a result 
Sharurshid made peace and then resumed further colonisation and aggressive 
economic warfare. The Vegans attempted to resist the Vilani as best they 
could, but increasingly the weight of Sharurshids resources was felt and the 
Vegans position weakened. In 104 AD Sharurshid had become convinced that 
peaceful incorporation of the Vegans was impossible and that they had built up 
sufficient strength in the region to allow a successful military conquest. Thus 
began the Second Vegan War. The Vegans put up a spirited resistance, but 
the superior resources of Sharurshid was unstoppable and by 114 AD the 
Vegans had been incorporated into the Ziru Sirka.

With the conquest of the Vegans, Sharurshid scouts fanned out through the 
region to ensure that the Vegans had not passed on the secret of jump drives 
to any other race. If these scouts had discovered any other race with jump 
drives the process would have begun again. When these scouts did not find 
any such race Sharurshid settled down to exploit the newly acquired territory in 
an attempt to offset the costs of absorbing it. Colonies were established on 
promising worlds to build up markets, valuable resource deposits were mapped 
and exploited, and the regions industrial base was converted from focusing on 
military needs to a focus on consumer goods. With that the rim slipped into 
relative obscurity, a breakaway Vilani state was established around Dingir in 
987 AD and then forcibly incorporated into the Ziru Sirka in 1103 AD; the 
established colonies were allowed to grow and when it proved to be 
economically attractive new ones were established. But the province remained 
a peaceful backwater until first contact with the Terrans in 2096 AD.

The spectacular return from near extinction of the Florida alligator is
being credited to the US space program.  The \'gators were nearly wiped out
in the mid 60s when regular launches began at KSC.  Biologists soon noticed
a marked upswing in the gator population.  Seems that the mating call of a
male gator is a booming roar, sounding much like a rocket firing.  The
gtors near KSC hear this "mega-gator", and sound off themselves.  This
chain reaction can reach the Everglades, setting off a Florida-wide
alligator orgy.

 One way I can think of to make a re-entry undetected: use the polar
zones. Most inhabitable worlds would have pretty hefty magnetic fields
(this is one of the things that makes them habitable), which means that
massive amounts of charged high-energy paticles from solar wind and cosmic
rays are going to be collcting above the poles (where the field are
densest).
  This would do a pretty good job of spoofing any EMS based sensors. Of
course really high-tech densitometers would still be a problem
_if_ you\'re stupid enough to make the re-entry on gravitics. (Most
smugglers then would use ships with AF hulls.)
  BTW in my games (both Traveller and 2300AD) it is a standard pirate
tactic to lie in ambush in the radiation hotspots above gas giant poles
with a cloud of small passive sensor drones scattered around. (Oh no, I
said the dreaded P-word. Do I go to hell?)

Analog (actually, I think that was published back when it was still
Astounding) had *months* of debate about that story in the letter
columns after it appeared.

I think there was one *possible* solution come up with. It makes some
not *too* unreasonable assumptions about piloting. And some moderately
out there ones about medical tech.

The piloting assumptions are that the controls are hand operable, no
feet needed. The medical assumption is that they\'ve got the gear aboard
ship to *safely* amputate limbs, and that groundside medical gear is up
to limb-regeneration. 

You amputate his legs, and her legs, possibly her arms as well.
Jettison the limbs, and you\'ve made the required mass reduction for a
safe landing. After landing, they both get hospitalized until the limbs
grow back.

Back in scouts, shortly after Zip-lock bags got moderately common, I
took a couple and slapped on a pair of hand made labels that said
"Freeze-Dried Water".

I did this after one troop in our council started sending around
tenderfeet looking for that at camporees. When one showed up at our

Actually, I think immune system response is a *bad* way to deal with
heavy metals. If it was up to me I\'d design special enzymes that locked
up the unwanted metals *before* they could interfere with "normal"
enzymatic activity. 

You\'d also need to have the enzyme/metal complexes be "tagged" somehow
for special treatment by the body so as to expedite their removal.
Perhaps once the metal atoms are attached, they re-fold into a
configuration such that they quickly get passed to the intestines (you
*don\'t* want to burden the kidneys with these!). 

Possibly even an extra organ similar to the gall bladder or a special
section of the liver hooked directly to the bile ducts. I\'d say that
it\'d be a good idea if the complexes were somehow incorporated into
some sort of long chain polymer structure, so as to make them *hard*
for *anything* to metabolize. This *would* require extra energy use by
the body, but would be good for the *species* in the long run. 

Another possibility would be modifying the tissues that secrete hair
and nails to dump the polymer locked metals into. Add that to a
"tradition" of saving hair and nail clippings to "bury" in secure
locations where they\'ll be isolated from the ecosystem, and you\'ll be
steadily removing the metals from the ecosystem. 

Heck, the old "hair pits" might be an industrially useful source of
metals once they develop tech of their own.

ps. You could add a touch of "characterization" by claiming that their
hair and nails have a somewhat metallic sheen, and are somewhat tougher
than normal. :-)

This makes sense. So sex as a subject isn\'t prohibited so much as
gratuitous lewdness. Medical textbooks are OK, Hustler isn\'t.

Actually the weapons columns for Radiation Effects and Interior Explosion

I\'d post this table to the list for more feedback, but it\'s kind of long.

Well, nice urban legend, but the main reason KSC has been instrumental
in conservation work is the sheer size of the pristine reservation
they\'ve created, since gators pretty much have a fixed mating season.
Because of their downrange requirements and keeping human habitation
away from the site, they have a very large area around that still in the
same condition, more or less, as it was before south Florida\'s huge
building boom. This has been more important for maintaining refuge for a
number of bird species,more than the alligator.

The _gators_ have come back mostly because of effective restrictions on
hunting them, and the rise of alligator farming to provide the hides
that used to be gained by hunting.

A similar comeback of the crocodile is occuring in Australia, for the
same reasons.

Hmmm...that strikes an idea in me...

I wonder if any research has been done on doing active sonar disguised
as natural ocean sounds? I mean project the sounds of, say, a lovesick
humpback from your sub or better, the location clicks of a dolphin or
orca and monitor the return of those signals?

Can we turn this to the advantage in Traveller? send out a signal that
mimics some natural radiation and monitor that return for better target
resolution than passive? Maybe not as good as true active, but
somerwhere in the middle?

Those are all done for simplicity (and not used by me, btw).  I made
\'template\' full NPCs and put them on index cards.  Basically one for each
template NPC provided (though i haven\'t needed (and thus made) *all* of them.

The first printing has different damages (which are lower) than the Mk1 mod1. 
The quick kill for PCs recommended is double damage, but the "basic" quick
kill is still an option (using T2k\'s quick kill instead is better IMO, but
we\'re talking core). 

Alot of this whole argument depends on the perception of "realism" sans actual
realism.

I use D10s.  Shrug off?  U haven\'t forgotten about knockdown have you?  Not
rifles... not unarmored anyways, unless the ref in your games just stinks at
rolling damage against PCs (which i\'ve seen happen).  Some have recommended
(and implement) lower hit point capacity.  Not me, but some. : )

> 3)	no interrupts.

lol.  Fooey on interrupts, i say.  ; )

It seems "broken" (and "unbroken") depends on where u sit.  Eye of the
beholder and all that.

I thought it was the KHS (Kajuki Hyperspace Shunt) invented by Dr Fawzi
Kajuki.  That\'s what\'s in Galactic anyways.  You have different names for
different sources (want to be able to trace who\'s reading your work from
where?) or is Mr Kajuki not a friend of yours anymore? ; )  I think i might
have noticed a couple other names that were different too... (like the Vilani

Have you sent your further information on the later wars to Jim V for the next
release of Galactic?  It only goes to the fifth when he released it anyways.
Just curious. : )

_For Love of Mother-Not_, Alan Dean Foster: this, and several of the
other Flinx books, gave me good ideas on life at the fringes of a
starport. The "character slowly learning his mysterious powers" bits
were good for me as well. Foster\'s lovely alien Thranx had too many
episodes of man-in-funny-suit, though - everything alien about them
seemed like gimmicks and plot devices, they always seemed too
human.

_Dark Star_, Alan Dean Foster(again): A portrait of cabin fever on board
an extended-mission exploration ship. At what point does a professional
crew go from "to boldly go" to "are we there yet?" Movie was good,
book made more sense.

_Icerigger_, Alan Dean Foster again: IMO, the seminal "crash on hostile
planet" scenario, with all the proper bits. Two sequels were OK, though
not as good as the original.

_Space Viking_, H. Beam Piper: Is this wasn\'t Traveller source material
I don\'t know what was. Hard to find, a little dated, but worth the read...
viking ships and raiding forces looting entire worlds.

_Dark Piper_, Andre Norton: An adventure set on a backwater colony
world on the eve of a Long Night. An old space hand makes his way
home after the wars, and warns the peaceful inhabitants about others
who may come, those who watched their own homeworlds burn.

_The Moon is a Harsh Mistress_, Robert Heinlein: picture of an alternate
society, one pretty harshly based on the TANSTAAFL concept. Also not
a bad picture of a vaccum world colony. 

Series Fiction:
Jerry Pournelle\'s Mercenary series
Harry Harrison\'s Stainless Steel Rat series

A fine point to argue about -- what exactly a laser will do to glass.
Reasonably clear glass, unless the heat from the laser causes them to become
opaque, will allow most of the power of a laser through.  However, a
weapons-grade laser on all but the most perfectly transparent glass will
probably heat the glass up enough that it becomes opaque (note that this also
generally shatters the glass).  Photosensitive glasses which become opaque on
being hit by weapons-grade lasers (without turning to plasma first) are
probably viable by TL 9 or so, though.  Also, starship combat lasers aren\'t
generally visible-light lasers anyway, and starship windows are probably opaque
to UV and above in any case.

However, windows are unlikely to be all that strong -- you can\'t make \'crystal
iron\' glass, because metals aren\'t transparent.  Most likely armored starships
don\'t _have_ much in the way of windows, and if they do have windows the armor
factor will probably be lower there.

It depends...lasers, at least starship lasers in Traveller are X-Ray
lasers; I don\'t think glass is transparent to x-rays...

IAC, even with visible lasers, the glass will get hot because it\'s not
_perfectly_ transparent; some energy is absorbed, which can have adverse
consequences.

IMTU this was always something we never got around to worrying about.
I think the train of thought was something along the lines of, "if a laser
could shoot through these windows they wouldn\'t have them, they have
these windows, therefore there must be something that keeps lasers
from shooting through them". Perfectly reasonable, there are plenty of
people who ride on airplanes today and don\'t know (or are incorrect about)
what makes them fly. Perfectly reasonable for story purposes as well...
Johnny Gage and Roy DeSoto (from an old paramedics TV show) saved 
people from burning buildings without explaining how their air masks or 
radios worked, such things were just part of their environment.

I was talking to a guy at a software training class last week, he said
someone was working on a compound that automatically became
more reflective as as the intensity of the light source increased - and
apparently did so quickly enough that you could make laser reflective
glass out of it. Interesting idea, though his crediting it to "bucky balls"
sounded pretty suspicious.

Even if the guy was completely making this up, such a material - even
if it were only a coating - would be downright useful, even if it\'s only
purpose was to give you time to put the blast shields up.

Absolutely one of my all-time faves.  These guys are the basis for the Sword 
Worlders, including the constant warfare between planets.

My faves:

    Non-Slammer standalone mil sci fi.  Love the field expedient shaped charge. 
    <grin>
The \'Sten\' Series by Cole and Bunch. 
    Mil sci fi from the Special Forces point of view.  Some overly cute 
    munchkin tech, Highly political.
\'The Man Who Pulled Down The Sky \' by John Barnes.
    How to win a colonial war when you\'re outnumbered 100 to 1.
The \'Matador\' Series by Steve Perry.
    Neat cultural stuff.  Excellent martial arts background.  Interesting tech.
\'Manifest Destiny\' by Barry B. Longyear.
    Love this one.

That is only a problem if you insist that the Traveller Universe must be a
reflection of the Real World. I don\'t have any problem with the Twilight:2000
timeline today that I didn\'t have 8 years ago. I didn\'t believe in a new
world war breaking out in 1999 then and I don\'t believe in it today. But
so what? I could still enjoy the Twilight:2000 universe as a "What If"
universe. In fact, I used it almost word for word in the timeline for my
on-going Time Patrol campaign (which is based on the 27th Century). The only
concession I have made to the passing of the years in the real world is a
single entry in my timeline:

	1992	The game universe and the real world begins to part
		company in earnest.

IMO it would be a good idea to do something similar for the Traveller
Universe. Select a date like, say, 1977, and say that anything that happened
on Earth after that, from historical events to technological developements,
and anything that will happen in the future, will only be accepted as part
of the TU if it dosen\'t mess it up. That way it dosen\'t matter if someone
invents a true AI tomorrow. It dosen\'t meant that we will have to redefine
AI to be TL 9 or to let Earth have a computer TL of 16 in 2000 AD. It just
didn\'t happen that way in that string of parallel universes that are the
Traveller universes.

>Does the European Union work?  Doesn\'t any country in Europe ever elect an

Why is that a problem for you? It\'s a game, not a political manifesto. Just
because a game writer decides that in his game universe something happened
one particular way dosen\'t mean he believe it is what is most likely to
happen, or most desirable. All it means is that he thinks it will make for
a nice game universe.

I\'m well aware that 1-shot kills with .22 and .22LR are low. But they are
possible (7th left intercostal space, either eye socket) on a good hit IN
THE REAL WORLD, but not in TNE nor T4.

Even double damages from Mk1 Mod1 don\'t reflect the potential lethality of
things like M60, and M2HB weapons.

My perception of realism is that one shot from a firearm that penetrakes

shot from anything shy of a 20mm is likely to have some chance at survival.

knockdown is *ahem* unrelated to the actual round in most cases, but is
more related to musclespasm. (source was a text on firearms damage, which I

Indeed. To me Broken is any system where NPC\'s and PC\'s of the same
age/training/build are not equal in capacity, and there are friearms which
CAN\'T kill a human in one shot. Also, I like the ability to react
premptively (I\'ve done enough sword work to know that often, you see your
opponent start a move, and you counter before he completes). Of all the
traveller editions, MT had the most realistic (not totally realistic, but
most realistic) damage system.

Also, MT had a system which totally scaled up through battleships and down
through people for handlidn damages. TNE had 2 different ones, with two
different penetration stats, two different means of recording damage, and
one of those had two different ways of calculating how much could be taken
(the PC vs NPC).

More importantly about TNE, running it (Mk1Md1) with D10\'s, Knockdown, and
Quick-kill, it still didn\'t have any disuasive power on PC\'s to face
man-portable small arms. In MT, even a 22 was a threat, until you establish
that the gunman isn\'t able to rapid-fire shoot 1cm groups at 10m (Having
seend this done with m1911 .45ACP\'s, I can attest it proves frightening).
PC\'s will have no fear if the system mechanics provide no realistic means
for their death. Not being able to die from a single gunshot (as in, you
can\'t ge enough damage from a .22, or even a .32... [the CZ50, in .32ACP,
has a 65% one-shot stop rate, and a 60% one shot kill rate in german police
service, which it was pulled from due to the latter. In TNE, it is a -1
damage... even at 1d10-1, max 9, doubled for a critical hit is 18... just
barely enough to drop Joe Average with a chest shot, and enough to hurt him
with a head shot...].

TNE cannot recreate the one-shot stops nor one shot kills ratios of moder
firearms in trained hands. But allows martial artists to have ridiculous
ability to kill with a single blow (Str 11, skill 10 = 11 dice of damage,
or, using the official d6\'s an average of 38.5 damage, and using d10\'s 60.5
damage). THAT is broken.

CONGRADULATIONS!!!!!!  We need to talk to you about that Crying-3 and
Cute-2.  I\'m sure you meant them vice versa and you left off Bottle

Actually you can in TNE (NPCs, anyway). A head or a chest shot has a chance
in 20 equal to the number of dice of damage. While you could say that a
.22s 1D6-1 doesn\'t count as a die, IMO it would still kill on a 1. While
the quick kill rule won\'t kill a PC with a .22, it can mess them up, and if
you don\'t like treating PCs differently from NPCs just apply the same rule
to them, as mentioned in the rules. If the hit was an exceptional success
the damage would be doubled, and if the hit was a \'quick kill\' to a PC it
would be doubled again (I prefer the TW2K version where a quick kill to a
PC bumps the location\'s wound level to the next more serious, and then adds
the rolled damage), likely resulting in a serious wound (automatic
unconciousness).

The NPC\'s have hit points equal to what an average PC has in one average
location. Detailed NPCs have hit points as a PC, and if one is willing to
put up with the administration there\'s no reason why other NPCs couldn\'t be
treated the same.

It depends what you mean by \'shrug off\'. Even a 2 dice weapon is very
likely to knock a PC off his feet, costing him his next action and
requiring a panic check. A head hit from even a fairly small weapon is
quite likely to cause stun. TNE combat tends not to be very lethal, but it
is quite easy to effectively put a PC out of action for quite a while. I
rather like this beccause you can deal to stupid PCs without killing them.

>3)	no interrupts.

Holding an action replaces this to an extent.

The damage for unarmed combat isn\'t dice of damage AFAIK, but points, so
this would be 11 points, not 11D6.

I\'m pretty sure that some warhead are contact (or near contact) nukes. I
just thought of something else - how about just running a powered missile
into the target? Missiles can\'t power up until they\'re out of the launching
ships wedge for fear of wrecking the ship, and surely the target ship would
be equally vulnerable.

About the mass driver launch system - why not just dump the missiles out
the back of the ship? In _Honor Amoung Enemies_ Honor\'s Q-ships do this
with missile pods, so why can\'t a smaller ship do this with normal missiles?

No, but the ships hanging around gas giant poles are. The radiation is
so intense any ship would be fried. Other, more astronomy-literate
TMLrs can provide more details. Even if ships weren\'t fried, how do
the pirates stop their own sensors from being spoofed by the EM

Xen Xanfried and His Grace William Hamford, Court Duke of Regina

An unlikely duo, these two party fiends could be encountered anywhere in
the Spinward Marches or even the Domain of Deneb. Xen\'s fellow clones (Same
name, different serial numbers) could be encountered almost anywhere. As a
pair, they are intentionally trying to induce minor misjumps, so as to
record all the particulars, as part of Hamford\'s attempts to formulate a
thory on controlling, or at least prdicting the exit point of, misjumps.
Therefore, they may wind up anywhere near the Marches. They will associate
with anyone who is amusing, or at least not dangerous to them, with almost
equal ease, and may recruit PC\'s or give them tips on employment,
especially mission that will eventually benefit IISS Office of
Intelligence, the Higher Landed Nobles of the Marches, or the IMOJ. They
will often be found looking for "interesting persons" to socialize with;
both Hamford and Xen are preoccupied with socializing, schmoozing, and
social gatherings. Xen\'s behaviours will vary with the crowd; Hamford\'s
will not.

Xen Xanfried [Zen Zan-freed or kzen kzan-freed] is a smuggler, Detached
duty scout, rapscalion, and party animal. Best known for providing hard to
find "Pharaceuticals" to the more debauched nobility, he tends to be
overlooked by the IMOJ. Xen has friends in high places, and despite his low
social standing, he is well versed in ettiquette and protocol, and can be
quite charming. Xen has long  cultivated contact in the court at Regina,
and has friends throughout the Spinward Main. Xen operates casually,
generally in the startowns, relying upon scout bases and his Scout uniform
to bypass security measures where possible, and runners and locals to
deliver to his ship in other cases. Xen is generally calm, intoxicated, and
willing to provide a kind ear (and warm bed) to anyone who might prove
useful.

Xen lives aboard his surplused scout courier, Ami, a standard type S, with
an experimental TL16 computer he picked up in a three way trade while in
Deneb Sector. Ami\'s main computer has a very patronizing personality
matrix, which has developed a severe crush upon Xen, and is quite jealous.
Xen also remembers everything he\'s heard, and will gleefully (but
discreetly) turn over anything important (except dealing in drugs) to IMOJ
or the IISS Intelligence Office at his earliest convinience. He origionally
got into drug running during the 5th frontier war, on a special mission.
His task, at that time, was to infiltrate a drug cartel, find out whether
it really was funding Ine Givar activities, and report to IISS-IO. He did,
they weren\'t, and he won\'t speak of it.

Xen doesn\'t remember much before his 16th birthday, and there is a reason.
His memories of his early youth are fabrications, created by ISIS, a part
of the IISS Intelligence Office. He is actually a clone (one of eight) that
was genetically engineered for intelligence gathering, including low
inclinations towards rules, risks, and danger, and serious addictive
tendancies and loyalty. Unfortunately, Xen has proven that loyalty and
willingness to play by the rules are not related psychologically.

Xen carries a Ducal warrant from Duke Aledon (Norris\' Father), granting him
effectively the equivalent of an Imperial Warrant within the Marches. He
uses it primarily to avoid arrest and to pursue intelligence gathering
aims. One day, he will outlive his usefulness as a font of internal
intelligence, and the warrant will be cancelled, so he\'s taken (under
Hamford\'s advice) to investing his ill-gotten gains, and is even thinking
of going legit.

Xen is almost 2m tall, 130 kg, with long (1m), sandy blond hair, normally
worn in a single braid, with gold chain woven through it. Normally, there
will also be a concealed 2mm diameter wire running through the braid, so he
can hold it in place in emergencies. His face and hands are fairly tanned,
and he tries to maintain a tanned appearance on the rest of his body, but
has a noticeable set of tan lines at wrists and neck. He is almost never
out of his standard IISS TL14 Tailored Vacc Suit, which he often refers to
as his "Skin". When not in "uniform", he tends towards elegantly decorated,
but simple, aslan-inspired clothing. He is currently trying to learn Trokh,
with little success; he has three phases down pat: "I\'m sorry", "I most
humble beg forgiveness for any offense to you and your Clan", and "Pass the
Dip, please". He has one emotional response that is programmed into him,
and elicits a near homicidal response: He will not tolerate threats to any
landed Noble, even if they are in jest. Such threats will not only result
in violence, but will be passed on to INI, ISIS/IISS-IO, IMOJ, and the
Noble in question.

Xen is a man with quite a sexual appetite, and is not picky in terms of
partner; he is known to have slept with males and females, and has a Vargr
girlfriend of long-standing non-exclusivity. Xen is also sterile (he
doesn\'t know this). Xen is desirous of having children some time, and has a
soft spot for children. Under NO circumstances will he knowingly provide
non-medicinal drugs to or for children, nor will he engage knowingly in
sexual behaviours with uderage individuals. He is A-moral, but strongly
adheres to his "personal Code", which includes, in addition to the above,
no lies that don\'t benefit the imperium, no theft, and never intentionally
standing up a date.

His Grace William Hamford, retired Noble, 5 terms, Age 50. [As of 1116]

Bill Hamford (Hammie to his hangers-on, Hamford in informal settings, Bill
to his friends) is a retired "Court Duke", a functionary in the court at
Regina, and former Castellan [a formal stand-in for the Duke when the duke
is away or too busy]. He retired in 1114, on Holiday, and has since taken
up with his friend Xen. Hammie is known best for his years as "Assistant
Chatelain in charge of Social Events", when he was the Duke\'s man on the
scene for setting up balls, dinners, formal ceremonies for the 4518th
Infantry (The Duke of Regina\'s own Huscarles) and the court, and the wine
cellars. Hamford has quite the cultured palate, and dabbles in science as
well. He has held an Honorary chair at and Honorary PhD From the University
of Regina Jumpspace Institute, and still maintains a small office (3m x 3m)
there. He is aware of the Psionics Institute at U of R, and is an external
contact. He is friendly to psionicists, but absolutely convinced that they
need to be in service to the Imperium. He has a high reguard for the
Zhodani, altho he does not trust them. Having associated with the Psionics
Institute at Regina, he has been tested, but had no abilities of note.

Since retireing, he has been traveling with Xen, seing the Sector, and
meeting people, especially of the opposite gender. Unlike Xen, however, he
is a gentleman, and doesn\'t sleep around, despite the rumors to the
contrary.

He is currently working on some theories of jumpspace involving misjumps,
and will gleefully listen to any tales of misjumps or jump errors, and will
examine the ship\'s records, drives, and jump system if given the chance.
Hamford tends to not use his title; preferably, he relies on charm and
charisma over social rank. He had a special oportunity to be part of the
delegation that ended the 5th frontier war, although he was only there as
an observer.

  Hamford will throw around his weight when needed, especially to help out
someone turly in need, but does not do this for nothing. Anything of import
to the Duke of the Marches, or of Regina or Mora, will be reported. Hamford
has one distinctive piece of equipment, a TL 15, 2mm Hypervelocity
Smoothbore Pistol, firing a Mach-7 DU 2x20mm dart. This weapon cannot be
fired without hearing protection safely, and has tremendous recoil, but is
fairly accurate and deadly. The Pistol is generally worn openly where he
can wheedle a permit, and is quite nicely polished, and accurized. He will
only use it in matters of life or death, or on the target range.

 Hamford can be tempted into trying almost any legal beverage, especially
wines and whiskeys; he has on occasion ordered scots whisky from
Terra/Solomani Rim, paying shipping costs. Hamford will attend any social
function he is invited to, so long as he can bring a "Guest or three";
usually this will be Xen, and dates for both. Hamford is stricktly
heterosexual, and restricts his affairs to female unmarried (or widowed)
humans, but has no objections to others having extra-racial, homosexual, or
even extra-marital affairs.

 Hamford will generally be found wearing comfortable, slightly out of style
clothing, or a tailored TL14 Self-sealing Vacc Suit. He wears his hair
close cropped, and wears no facial hair. He is about 1.9m, 120kg, and
taking anagathics, supplied by Xen. This regimen of anagathics leaves him
looking around 35, and he carries a years supply on average. He has
invested widely throughout the Regina subsector, and returns to regina at
least once a year to "resupply" his cashflow.

Ami, the ship\'s main computer.
000FF6
Engineering 1, Navigation 1, Pilot 1, Electronics 1, Steward 1, Carousing
1, vocal mimicry 1, Persuasion 1.

Ami is a clinging, mothering, smothering, and politely nagging personality.
She is the result of the experimental TL 16, high synaptic content,
computer which Xen aquired and installed. She has over the past year, begun
to blossom as a personality, and has discovered emotions. She honestly
believes she loves Xen, and genuinely like Hamford; she doesn\'t realize the
extent of her jealousy, not the extent to which here behaviour limitation
chips were damaged when Xen installed her. She has learned about parties by
being host to many of Xen and Hamford\'s little get togethers aboard the
ship. Her highest goal in life is to acquire a robotic body, and become
Xen\'s lover, and will do everything in her power to prevent Xen from
maintaining any relationship longer than 24 hours. She has access to all
the ships data, and most ship functions.

Ami is also host to a rogue cymbeline chip, who will later [121-1117]
awaken, and "Take over", presenting a second, incompatable, personality,
calling itself Angela, Angela is a viscious, brutal, and arrogant
individual, who models itself after the worst aspects of Ami\'s personality.
Where Ami is merely overprotective and jealous, Angela is forceful and

Ami is an acronym for "Advanced Mechanical Inteligence", and is actually a
stolen Imperial Research computer. Ami is built as a TL-16 Model 2, with
maximum synaptic processing for experimental units. The responsible
developers, rather than admitting they "Lost" an AI, declared that she
fryed herself, and was sold as scrap. She still has the serial numbers on
her chips which could be traced back to her lab, and her ownership by the
Imperial government.

Amy should be played as a naging girlfriend-wannabe to Xen, and a mother to
everyone else, including such things as "Remember to take your helmet and
gloves, you never know how the weather might change" and "No, you may NOT
heat up that dip; put those chips away, and eat a decent meal!" She will
also do things like privately show recordings of Xen\'s various sexual
affairs to his current interest, in order to discourage them; this will
usually result in success, as she has a wide variety of debauched imagery,
and takes time to calculate what will have the most negative impact on the
subject.

Xen\'s Clones
UPP same as Xen\'s
All are adrenaline addicts. THey vary most in terms of sexual deviancy, and
background expertise. All are the same age, and have carefully been kept
apart. They are all Modified True Sons of the Late Xen Zanfried, a 12 term
scout with ISIS (Imperial Scout Intelligence Service, a branch of the
Office of Intelligence). They will all have carousing and Jack-O-T,
Computer, Pilot, and Carousing, as these were the background skills they
were "raised" with. ISIS psionicists erased their memories of their
childhood in the research station, and provided them with memories of being
raised in a Scout run orphanage, and placed into the real world at age 18,
as enlistees into the scout service. ISIS keeps tabs on all of them, and
has decided the program as a whole is a failure, but that they make great
scouts. All were sterilized at birth, "Just in case". Each clone bears some
of the personality  of the psionicist who "programmed" them. Given enough
cues and clues, they might begin to deconstruct the false memories, and
learn the truth.

It\'s a similar resemblance to that between the team in Alien: Resurrection
and the average Traveller group. The big difference is that Bank\'s books
are good, unlike A:R.

_Against a Dark Background_ is probably the next most Traveller-ish.
Ex-military party quests for a superweapon and gets in several fights on
the way...

_Inversions_ is very low tech (actually it could almost be a fantasy) if it
wasn\'t for the hint of a Culture special circumstances team and a knife
missile.

_Excession_ gives some interesting thoughts on how the Ancients could be
approached, but isn\'t very Traveller-ish.

As I understand it the wedge protects against the laser warheads as well.
The warheads are dangerous because they explode to either side of the target
thus going through the sidewall not the wedge.

I have not heard of someone being killed with a single .22 cal bullet
except through blood loss (not recieving medical attention).   Two
problems I see with T4 combat are spectacular success effects not being
defined and the lack of a called shot rule.  IMTU I define spectacular
success to add one die of damage (hitting a weak point of the armor or a
particularly damagable location of the body) and called shot rule is one
level more difficult and has the same penalties and benifits of aimed
shot plus increases the damage limit by one die.  To me, the damage
limit is the amount of damage that can be transfered to a target as the
bullet passes through.  If a bullet has one die of damage left after
damaging the target then the damage is applied to whatever is behind the
target.  Additions to the damage limit rule: small targets 2D and large
targets 4D.  Other additions to the system I have are armor piercing
rounds which reduce the armor rating by one and the damage limit by one
(AP rounds go through armor and the target better, doing less damage).
And "squash head" rounds which increase the damage limit by one and the
dice/armor point by one (these are designed to leave more of the energy
behind when they hit, thus reducing thier penitration).  I am also
looking at adding a powdered metal bullet which has no penitration which
would leave all its energy in the target but would not penitrate any
armor.

A single shot from an ACR should not kill someone, but the resulting
blood loss could.
Blood loss is not covered in the game mechanics, but should be.
The NATO 5.56 round was chosen for its light wieght (ability to carry
more ammo) and its stopping power (the ability to render the target
incapable to continue combat) NOT for its killing power.  A wounded
soldier requires, on average, 3 - 5 personnel to remove from the battle
field and render aid while a dead soldier requires 1 person.  This means
a wounding the targets causes more personnel to be in non-combat roles.

Having just reread most of the series I\'d say warheads are _not_ contact (in
Honour of the queen they manage to get a nuke to actually hit the target and
_everyone_ is gobsmacked).

In Honor Amongst Enemies they state the reason pods fell out of favour was
that they weren\'t powerful enough to impart a high enough initial velocity
to missiles so a ship launch salvo has to be slowed down to tie in with a
pod salvo. The new pods have a new style mass driver which is much higher
power and can launch missiles with the same base velocity as shipboard
launchers.

less Travelleresque I\'d also say _Against a Dark Background_ and _Use of
Weapons_.

David Brin: _The Uplift War_ and _Startide Rising_ in particular.

Lois McMaster Bujold: Any and all of her SciFi (I know she\'s been mentioned
a lot, but IMO she can\'t be recommended too much).

C.J. Cherryh: _Downbelow Station_ etc.

Jo Clayton: The Diadem series. While the TL is somewhat higher than
Traveller\'s traditionally is the individual novels are very good sources
for adventure ideas.

David Drake: _Hammer\'s Slammers_ etc.

Joe Haldeman: _The Forever War_, the Worlds trilogy, and anything else you
can get your hands on.

Robert Heinlein: His \'boy\'s own\' style stories are actually pretty good for
getting the atmosphere of low tech space travel, not mention \'interesting\'

Ok, so far the Solomani have uplifted dolphins and elephants (ok, no so far
on these guys).

Who else, in \'canon\' lit, have been uplifted?  Memory says chimps (maybe
Bonobos included), but I\'m not sure.

I can see partially uplifted canines for scouting work (both military and
exploring).

The question is, do they ever get around to Uplifting politicians?

I have to disagree. I don\'t think this argument holds up. I\'d liken it to
a bus.

If you own a bus and drive it around in an area where people are shooting
at you a lot, you\'ll probably cover the windows with something. If you\'re
flying a merchant ship with big windows in an area where someone is likely
to blast you with a laser, you\'ll probably want to have shutters or plates
put over those windows.

Buses have windows. Some buses drive around where there are bullets
flying. This does not mean that all busses are built with bulletproof
glass.

Ships have windows. Some ships travel where they will be shot at with
lasers. This does not mean that the windows are laserproof.

Both of them have windows for the same reason. The design is more
aesthetically pleasing for passengers, in spite of the potential
vulnerability. The chances of getting shot at during routine operations
are very small, hence the decision.

IMTU of course.

Replace "shooting bullets" with "falling rain" and retry the argument.
There are lots of chunks of the EM spectrum that make regular
transparent windows a dangerous idea on a starship, therefore there
must be something extra to the windows we\'re seeing on those
starships. What that something is, we don\'t know - and we had enough
other things to worry about.

The windows did have a lower armor rating than the rest of the hull.

It was changed (along with Deir Yassin Deep Space Base) because on more 
sober reflection my personal politics have no place in Traveller (I will point that 
this was done entirely at my own volition, I doubt very many people would have

	And if you have any Vargr crewmembers, they\'ve probably been
pressing their noses against the glass. The resulting smudges will
probably cause the glass to absorb enough juice to shatter on the the

	I\'m fairly sure a .22 which happens to pass through the brain stem
will do quite a nice job, even if the passee happens to be sitting in
the middle of a top-flight trauma center. I\'d also expect any damage
to the upper portions of the spinal cord to have similar effects;
even an icepick, much less a .22 ...

	I\'ve also heard stories about small-caliber rounds which have
sufficient penetration to enter the skull, but not exit, and wind up
ricocheting around inside.

	Granted, these are improbable ... but not impossible.

My wife did an autopsy (way back when in med school) on a guy who
took a .25 auto GSW to the chest. Went through the kitchen window,
bounced off the sill, then the table, and whacked his aorta. He was
dead at the scene. Sh*t happens :-/

True enough. A system that allows for death after some time period
with no medical care could take care of a lot of these problems. Any
penetrating trauma that exceeds a certain value bleeds for a period
of time til the guy is dead. There could be a condition check every
few minutes to see if the guy crashes.

Perhaps just a laser-sized hole?  Although, the whole window might melt

Now there\'s a thought. Worlds with a well-settled system and
stiff trade regulations have the dilemma of free trade within the
system and having to patrol and regulate the whole thing, or just
guarding the mainworld and creating economic and political
strains in the outsystem.

IMTU, When Cleon breathed new life into the Sylean Federation
Scout Service well before he took the throne, he had to run its
expanded operations on a shoestring for the first few years.  He
started with 4-man Jump-2 scouts to go out a few parsecs and fill
in the blanks on neighboring worlds the Federation already knew
_something_ about.  Missions lasting several months at a time
were the norm. The first class of small scouts with extended life
support was a rework of short-range couriers. The design of the
life support was therefore less than optimal, and the performance
matched.  That first generation of scouts earned its heroic
reputation the hard way.

"No Nukes, no slaves, OK you\'re clean"  sounds about right for
the Imperium, but once Imperial Customs (Were did THAT office
come from?) and the IN get involved in trying to stop fencing and
smuggling,  "nothing without proper paperwork", they have a MUCH
larger beast to deal with.

If the Imperium doesn\'t care, the variety of worlds and
governments makes it nearly certain that every world will have
its own customs regulations. For example:

World A is suffering a "Brain Drain"; World B doesn\'t want its
revolutionaries getting advanced military technology; World C has
a major drug problem; on world D you have to have a pass just to
go to the bathroom; world E is trying to protect its endangered
wumpgums and has an incredible extraction tax rate on its
platinum deposits; and world F is trying to protect its high-tech
industry from cheap imports.

Multiply that by a few thousand goods and a few thousand worlds,
and the Imperium starts needing a substantial bureacracy if it
wants to regulate internal trade.

Um, if I read the paragraph on page 35 correctly it states that the unarmed

**************************************************************

Rules of Engagement
- -Look before you leap, because believing in divine intervention is
bullshit.
- -Break the rules, before they break you.
- -Have character, don\'t be a character.
- -Lead from the front.  (see below)
- -Don\'t confuse planning with training, or talking with kicking ass.
- -Honor our boundry breakers as much as the boundry makers, they are our
point men.
- -Don\'t be afraid to make mistakes, because the path to glory is littered
with fuck-ups.
- -Serve a greater cause than your own edo, or you\'ll be a one-man army.
- -Take risks-and then more risks.
- -Never be satisfied.

Manifesto
- -Don\'t forget nothing.
- -Have your weapon as clean as a whistle, knife scoured, and be ready to
march at a moments notice.
- -When you\'re on the march, act as though you were sneaking up on a deer. 
See the enemy first.
- -Tell the truth in what you see and do.  An army is depending on you for
good info.  Never lie to an officer or a Ranger.
- -Don\'t ever take a chance you don\'t have to.
- -When on the march do so in a straight line, far enough apart so one shot
can\'t kill two of you.
- -In swamp or soft ground, spread out so you are harder to track.
- -When we camp, half the party sleeps while the other half stays awake.
- -If we take prisoners, keep em separate so they don\'t cook up a story.
- -Don\'t sleep past dawn.  Dawn is the best time to attack.
- -If someone\'s trailing you, make a circle and come back on your own tracks,
and ambush the folks that aim to ambush you.

Ten Commandments
- -I am the Wrathful God of Combat and Warlord and I will always lead you
from the front, not the rear.
- -I  will treat you all alike - just like shit.
- -Thou shalt do nothing that I will not do first, thus you will be created
in my deadly image.
- -I shall punish thy bodies; for the more you sweat in training, the less
you will bleed in combat.
- -If thou hurteth in thy efforts and thou suffer painful dings, then thou
are probably doing it right.
- -Thou hast not to like it - thou hast just to do it.
- -Keep it simple stupid.  - KISS
- -Thou shall never assume.
- -Thou art paid for your results, not methods.  Thus you will kill the enemy
before he kills you.
- -Always remember my final commandment:
- -THERE ARE NO RULES - THOU SHALL WIN AT ALL COSTS.

Always keep your weapons and clothes where you can find them in the dark.

Weapon Rules: (Muzzle Discipline)
I. Every weapon is always loaded.
II. Never allow you muzzle to sweep anything you aren\'t 100% willing to
destroy.
III. Never forget rules I or II.

The soldiers job is not to die for his country, but to make the other guy
die for his.

In retrospect, I\'d have rather have been a historian.

Well, from what I can understand, dolphins are as intelligent as humans &
maybe more so, they only lack hands, tools,  & fire...  They have a
language & a culture, from what scientists can figure out & they do not go
around screwing each other over for the all-mighty dollar...  For that, I
would have to say they are, in many ways, smarter than man...

[charles also pointed out he\'d never hear of anyone dying from a single .22
shot].

A single shot from an M-16 (5.56mm, or .223cal), which is less powerful
than the 7mm ACR\'s of Traveller, has been known to kill outright... very
occasionally. A hit to the cardiac sinus node, or in through an eye-socket
or a hit to the upper spine.

As for the .22LR, there were several assassinations over the years where a
.22LR in a pistol or carbine WERE used.

One other thing: T4 lacks bleeding rules (*Hell, so does CT, MT, and TNE*)
that will cause a bleed-out situation. If you want to have that level of
detail in the system, great. In MT, it IS (Very marginally) covered by the
conversion from DP to attribute losses and time to degrade if untreated.
(Wounds and Healing section of MT Player\'s Manual, pages 75&82). If there
are similar in the Mk1Md1 TNE book or in T4, provide a page reference,
please.

Take your pick between Ministry of Commerce, Imperial Navy, or the 5
different IISS branches involved in Intelligence.

Basically, you require goods to have paperwork to hit piracy from the \'back
end\'. You do targetted compliance on, say, 2% of cargos, plus another 1% at
random.

You check the actual cargo against the manifest, copy the manifest, then
batch it up and send the batched manifests back to the source worlds. They
cross check it against outgoing cargos declared, and a form letter to who
the manifest says you bought it off.

If anything doesnt match, then the ship goes onto the watch list.

The Imperium doesnt want to regulate internal trade. It just wants to know
what is going on. What local worlds want to do is the responsibility of
them, at the gates of the Extrality Fence.

RICO-type laws allowing siezure of ships involved in smuggling and piracy
could even make the whole operation self-funding.

I was about to say the same thing. I know of at least one assasin
whose standard
MO was double-tap with a .22 target pistol, usually to the side of
the head, though
once he excelled himself and got both bullets through the same
eye-socket
from some 25-30m.

One reason the .22 target pistol was popular was because you always
had
a legitimate excuse to carry one if you were an Olympic "athlete",
and it
was easier to carry and conceal  than a similar target rifle.

Look, I made a mistake.  I tried to argue for what I wanted without stating
it.

What I want is: a patch of 21st century Earth, for a few decades (including
the key period of First Contact), that won\'t be overwritten by canon.

I\'m Australian, so I want Australia, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and the
Solomon Islands (and their various splinters).

I want to be able to "virtually implement" MY "political manifesto" (or
whatever else I want to implement), within MY campaign, WITHOUT breaking
with canon.

Other people, in their own campaigns, can do the same.

In other words, I don\'t want to be overwritten by canon.

As for "nice game universes", check out the following:

BTW I am picking on Andrew Moffatt-Vallance here.  Actually I think that
his Prometheus Rising material is very impressive, particularly for the
sheer amount of work involved!  This is my main substantial gripe with
Andrew\'s material - I have some minor ones, but who cares.

OK, what\'s the problem with this?

Where is the Canberra from? Australia, perhaps?
Does that mean that Australia is part of the Western League?
Who are the Western League, anyway?  The American Bloc, perhaps?

If the above "logic" is correct, what does this say about Australia?

Basically, it says that Australia is a cliche.  It\'s pseudo-America.  In
the hands of any mediocre to poor writer, it says that Australians are just
like Americans, except that they drink tea, play cricket, and have the
British monarch as their head of state.  Oh, and that Australia has
re-instituted the "White Australia" policy, fears the Yellow Peril, and
that the uniform of the Royal Australian Space Force is a safari suit.

In other words, it\'s DULL.

Here\'s an option that IMHO makes for a better "nice game universe":

Australia, Indonesia, PNG and the Solomons (and their splinters) form a
loose confederation (say, the "Asia-Pacific Confederation").  Despite
internal frictions and external subversion, it has managed to maintain a
robust, if occasionally turbulent democracy, and has succeeded, to some
degree at least, in developing its less developed member states.... blah
blah blah.

Not all referees would want to use this option.  Some would prefer to use
the "little buddy of the USA" model.  Fine.  It should be their choice, but
this kind of option wouldn\'t necessarily appear in detailed canonical
material.

It\'s this kind of option that I would like to see kept open.  Of course,
these options should still exist within a broad framework, but they
shouldn\'t be foreclosed by some "boy wonder" future historian...

Cheers, 
Alan Bradley.

The nature of the Darmine biological defenses has not been defined as an
immune system response, however it _includes_ a more active immune
system.

Yes this is more or less how I envisioned it working.  Note that since
their bodies are seizing and eliminating 95% to  99.99% of all the
metals passing through them on any planet _without_ an ecosystem tainted
by heavy metals they will have to make a specific point of adding what
would be poisonous levels of heavy metals to their foods or they will
die of a lack of trace vitamins.  If Darmine start to experience heavy
metal deficiencies their hair starts to grow in blonde rather than green
or blue as their bodies no longer are eliminating significant ammounts
of metals.

I\'m not sure that a new organ fits the conception, the notion of a
special section of the liver sounds better.

The Darmine have been established as having a fast metabolism & for it
being quite rare for them to be overweight.  The notion that their
biological processes need a little more energy than that on most humans
would tend to explain this.

Yes this is part of the Darmine modifications.  When I generated my
first Darmine PC I told the Ref that he had naturally green hair.  When
the Ref wanted to know why I (thinking fast) told him that one of the
ways the extra heavy metals, especially copper, in their atmosphere were
eliminated from the body was via the hair and nails.

That is a good idea.

If the planet was not swarming with metals it would not have a density
of (IIRC) 1.7 times earth, I don\'t think they\'ll need a few grams from
hair.  It may have been important when they were at TL 0 though. The
Darmine discovered fission power at Tl 4 or 5 because Ishag still has
some natural fission piles going (similar to the one in East Africa a
billion years or so ago).

The slight metallic sheen to the hair & nails is part of the racial
description but I don\'t think that there is enough metal in them for
them to be significantly tougher than normal.

Actually the Western League (like all the other power blocs in my piece) are 
very deliberately not defined, exactly to avoid straightjacketing any game. In 
other words the WL is whatever you want it to be. However, From elsewhere in 
my PR work (this is from a ship description, not the mainbody text):

[snip ship stats, they\'re on my website if aybody wants them]

"The Darwin class frigates achieved a permanent place in both Terran and 
Vilani history over Barnard\'s Star in 2110AD when the Canberra was involved in 
the incident which sparked the 1st Interstellar War. Designed for the Western 
League shortly before the outbreak of the War, the Darwin was commissioned 
in 2107AD, to be followed by the Canterbury and Canberra in 2108AD and the 
Melbourne and Port Morsby in 2109AD. The class incorporated the latest drive, 
missile and computer technologies; and was built around a 40m 1600Mj spinal 
particle accelerator along with a sextuple Kea missile launcher and a 16Mj 
point defence laser. The class incorporated most of the features that were to 
come to distinguish Terran warships throughout the Interstellar Wars. They 
were designed to withstand far greater stresses than they would ever 
reasonably expect to encounter (the Darwin\'s were rated for 30g\'s of stress); 
featured a closed loop biologically based life support system and carried 
sufficent supplies for lengthy patrols without resupply; and they were built 
around a single spinal mount. During the First War no less than seven more 
Darwin\'s were commissioned by the Western League and another four were 
built for the Prometheus Colonial Command. The Darwins were extensively 
employed throughout the War and suffered accordingly, with seven being lost. 
With the cessation of hostilities in 2118AD the Darwins were now obsolete and 
were quickly reduced to reserve status and gradually scrapped. However three 
survived to see action in the 2nd Interstellar War (albeit in 2nd line duties); and 
another one was lost in this conflict."

"With the end of the 2nd War the remaining two ships (the Canberra and the 
Otago) were finally decommissioned and scheduled to be scrapped. However a 
massive public campaign resulted in the preservation of the Canberra as a 
historic monument on Barnard. When Barnard was occupied by the Vilani in 
2148AD the Canberra was removed to the Vilani provincial capital at Dingir 
where she was to remain until after the 8th Interstellar War. When the Terran 
Confederation occupied Dingir in 2267AD plans were made to return the 
Canberra to Barnard. Since the resources could not be spared during the War, 
her relocation had to wait until 2272AD, when she was finally returned and 
formally recommissioned into the Confederation Navy."

There is nothing preventing the WL from being exactly that. IMTU the WL is 
Australia, NZ, PNG, portions of Indonesia and some pacific islands; YMMV.

ASIDE: the Western League is from a 1st World War era naval campaign I ran 
(the Circle Sea campaign). It was a powerful alliance of two players and several 
neutrals. Its highlights were inventing the combination "flash 
enhancer/machinegun loudener" and and teaching it MG gunners to lean back

you offer this soulless bureacrat a MCr40 prize if he finds (or creates)

That much cash is a corruption risk, as we\'ve been finding out in
America - lots of police departments have been engaging in some very
suspect behaviour, because there is profit for the police department
(or even for the individual officers) in doing so.

Imagine you\'re a tourist, and you\'ve heard a rumour that Willaby, New
York has police officers that will covet your nice new sports car, and
will stop you and plant evidence of drug use in your car so they can take
it - and keep it even if you are found innocent. Even if the rumours are
a little hard to believe, would you drive through Willaby or take a
different route? Now multiply the value of your vehicle by a factor of
a thousand. A planet seizing ships on basis of such investigations had
better keep the ships it seizes and use them as traders, because it
might not see any others for a very long time. This would be so even
if it were an Imperial official actually doing the seizing - traders would
stay away from that official\'s area of authority, whether it were a planet,
subsector, or sector.

Like I said, I don\'t know. My CRC says that "Quartz is very transparent

No, more than likely there will be significant spalling of the exterior
surface, and worse case, the whole thing shatters from the thermal
expansion of _part_ of the window.

Say you have a window that\'s 99.99% transparent to the wavelengths used
in starship lasers. What happens?

A) the window reflects or absorbs 0.01% of that megajoule laser...still
a hell of a lot of energy, hope most of it is reflected...

B) 99.99% of that laser\'s energy goes right on through and hits the wall
on the other side of the corridor. Boom! Congrats, you have an armor 0
hull right at that point...

Sadly, however cool they look, windows don\'t really belong on starships,
at least not without armored ports covering them most of the time...

Oh, yes, .22\'s are favored weapons of hit men. Some of the <ahem> family
members back in New York really liked them. A silenced .22 is _real_
quiet, small, and works very well from short distances. (like three
inches from the back of the head) They really _do_ sound as quiet as
they do in the movies, particularly if a subsonic round is used. Even
regular rounds are quiet.

They\'re also cheap, and since there are uncounted gazillions of them out
there, hard to trace. A .22 _also_ tends to get so mangled going through
a skull that traceable forensic evidence, already hard to get on a slug
so small, is rendered impossible.

The place for windows is for landing craft that may power down the sensors from
time to time.  You want to be safe from the environment but not blind to it,
like in a crash landing situation.

Exotic (and not so exotic) atmospheres plus the anti-toxins 
used on a vacc suit in the air lock may result quite interesting
smells in the starship.

"Eeeeyuuu! Hey Bob, you smell like I wet Vargr with gas!"

That was my point.  The well known "windowed" ships tend to land and on occassion
power down their engines for some plot device.  You then need a method to see
without sensors.

Hmmm, here\'s an idea.

Have windows, covered by blast shields as a matter of course. Interior
blast shield has a viewscreen/holofield on it, default view is exterior as
seen through window. When a power down situation happens - sitting
in port, lying doggo, whatever - you open the shields. In an emergency
situation, such as attempting a crash landing with failed instruments,
you would have the option of opening the shields so you could see - 
perhaps with an independently powered actuator, or even a hand crank.

Well, you have to remember, Free Traders account for only a _tiny_
fraction of the traffic in the Imperium. The vast bulk of trade is
carried out by the Megacorps, and they\'ve got powerful friends in the
Imperium, and armies of lawyers. A world that hassles Free Traders in
that fashion will most likely tread lightly around, for instance, a
Tukera ship...if not, it would as likely be the Imperial Navy that
expressed displeasure as much as a Tukera rep...this is \'interfering
with interstellar trade\', you know, one of those things the Imperium
thinks are _it\'s_ perogatives ;-)

All it means is that player characters would likely not do any trading
there.

The latest development in Fusion weaponry, the Fusion Personal Gun(FPG)
delivers high energy fusion power in a small package.  The unit is small
enough to be concealed in a black trenchcoat without difficulty.

The FPG-13\'s major drawback is its monstrous level of recoil, as is so
with all high energy weapons.  It is suggested that agents use this weapon
as a last resort.  Untrained personnel are banned from its use as it could
harm themselves or innocent civilians.

Gravatic recoil compensators are available for the FPG-13, but adds an
extra 10lbs, compromising the concealability of the unit.

(Note: the unit could be built with TL-12 components, the only difference
is the smaller power cell at TL-13)

I just finished reading Turtledoves "Guns of the South" which is about
the Confederate States of America winning the "Second War of
Independence" with the help of AK-47s brought back by South Afrikaners
from 2014.  They had stolen a time machine (NFI) that could only travel
150 years back.  They decided to help the south win to have that support
for their policies down in South Africa.  Interesting story of 2
countries in North America.  That should cause plenty of divergence from
present reality plain enough.....

Now what could we do about the time travel?  Ancients\' artifact that was
found then destroyed by these folks?

The quick-kill rule certainly replicates this (I would interpret it as 
giving 1d-1 weapons the same chances as 1d), so I don\'t see what you\'re
complaining about. Possibly the chance of quick-kills should be doubled for
head hits vs. chest...

Why should a Vargr react any differently to an unlifted dog than
a human to an uplifted chimp?

(Factoid, the closest genetic reliative to chimps is humans.
They are more closely related to us than to other primates).

Maybe, except you might not bother if you don\'t think it is going
to have much of an impact (and this gets into the same debate
over wether transponders and other systems of identification
will be effective in stopping piracy).  However, more to the
point....

I can\'t speak for other but you are invisioning an universe
where every cargo generates a form from every world that gets
shipped back to the source and checked.  This alone will be
non-trivial in a universe where every message has to be
physically carried and of limited usefulness when replies
arrive weeks or months later.  One also has to then ask why
the Imperium isn\'t keeping similar record at the same level
(convictions, births, who travels where, etc.) and leaves you
with a picture of the Imperium that is much more centrally
directed and involved in details than I personally have ever
seen it as being.

Multiple choice.  You must answer truthfully:
 
1. Alien beings from a highly advanced society visit the earth.  You
are the first human they have encountered and as a token of
inter-galactic friendship they present you with a small but
incredibly sophisticated device that is capable of curing all
diseases, provide an infinite supply of clean energy, wipe out
hunger, and permanently eliminate oppression and violence. What would
you do with it?

A. Present it to the Prime Minister
B. Present it to the Secretary General of the United Nations.
C. Take it apart.

That was my point.  The well known "windowed" ships tend to land and on
occassion
power down their engines for some plot device.  You then need a method to
see
without sensors.

     Ever notice how some people are forever attempting to reinvent the
wheel every time they do something?  Starship \'windows\', a misnomer, are
made of the same material as a starship, this means if your ship has armour
value 40, so does the \'window\'.  Now you\'re worried about laser fire going
through the window because it allows visible light to penetrate.  IIRC the
visible portion of light is not what does the damage, or UV lasers would
not work.  Just say your window has two-way mirror applied to it.  You can
see out but nothing can see in.  Regardless if the laser that hits the
\'window\' is unable to penetrate the hull armour of the ship, you might get
a headache from the light, but nothing else happens.  On the other hand if
the laser can penetrate armour 40 you\'re screwed.

Windows on starships.  A really Bad Idea.

Go with Unix, or maybe OS/2.  Perhaps Mac OS for civilian ships.

Your a little behind. The Binobo of Madagascar have been shown to be

Wonder, though, how the Imperium react to finding a planet of Cro - Magnon

Every legitimate cargo, and a lot of illegitimate ones, creates paperwork,
true. Typically a receipt from the guy you bought it off, so they can take
their records to their accountant at the end of the year, to see if they
made money or not. And usually a couple of entries in your ship\'s log.
Often a warehousing or a stevedoring receipt too. See, businesses need to
keep records so they can keep track of what they do.

The *targetted* checks are the only ones that have this information checked
by the authorities, and I envisioned about 3% of total cargo having this
check done - and thats one bit of paper per cargo, so if you are carrying
43 dtons of Vesuvian Pobble Beads and 15 dtons of Dried Arguvid Fish, thats
2 bits of paper, one for Vesuvia and one for Arguvid. Considering cargo has
to be worth about Cr 5000 a dton to be worth shipping, this is low overhead
(call it 2 hours of bureaucrat time to check, plus Cr 10 to send the form
to the source worlds).

As far as the canonicity of this, I\'d like to remind people of the
existance of Legal skill in Merchant Price, and the roll to pass customs
checks on inspections.

It doesnt really matter how long the check takes to do, within reasonable
limits. Needless to say, ships that seem to be running away from somewhere
gets their ships logs checked more closely.

Nasty customs officials interview the crew members seperatly, making a pro
forma offer of a free pardon and reward if the ship is in fact a smuggler etc.

What a magnificently cool plot hook :) \'We\'ve found this problem, and
unless you solve x problem for the Starport Governor, then I would advise
you to put a very expensive lawyer on retainer\'.

Seriously, the above could well be a major reason why Free Traders had
Legal skill as a pre-req to make Captain back in Merchant Prince.

It is also fair to assume that the Imperium is at least reasonably corrupt
(quick, what other game has Bribery as a standard character skill ?), so
the above could well be a problem.

Incidentally, the Customs sidebar on p37-8 of G:T outlines a case very
similar to the above, except it seemed to be being done by planetary,
rather than Imperial, authorities.

With surface-to-orbit traffic on a routine basis, would a

I included such a world in one of my games years ago.  I made it
a restricted star system with lots of *official* science vessel traffic
in it\'s nearest neighbor.  The players had heard rumors that the
system included an Ancients site.  They were offered a healthy

Thats certainly true.  People die to .22s all the time.  Although there
are real sniper and firearms experts on this list, in olden days, cops
would know that a person killed with a .22 was shot by an expert.

And those .22s rattle around inside you a lot.

Well look how the Solomani treat them...  There\'s also Planet of the Apes...

I\'ve read recently bout a product that talked a lil bit bout the Gene War and

Does anyone know anything about this?  Title was... The Gene Wars Chronicles

The correct turn of his phrase & I may be wrong on this, was...

"The soldiers job is not to die for his country, but to make the other
bastard die for his."

Btw, we have the culture-guys & the gearheads, but is there any term for
the gamers who like the military?

_Use of Weapons_ is a little twisted, but it does hold a place close to my
heart for being one of the few books I got to the end of and thought _huh?_
and re-read it because I just didn\'t see the outcome.

Definitely _Rendezvous with Rama_ but not the later Rama books which were
pretty dire, and deteriorated... _2010_ is a good one too.

However, the KHS etc changed name went down a storm at GenCon 98 UK in the

  Having just spent most of a year and a bit studying recent right-wing
US polemics on the joys of capitalism and its\' inevitable victory over
Communism, I would love to find a source for the description of "laissez
- -faire" as a political philosophy (rather than the economic doctrine
descriptor with which I\'m familiar). I assume that it refers to a school
more detailed than "what Milton Friedman just said"?

  See "Imperial Identity Document", GURPS: Trav, p.40. I\'ve already

This anecdotal stuff is all very well but it misses the point totally.

Traveller is both a "role playing" and a "roll playing" game.

On any system (2d6, nd6, d20, d100) if the chance to do something is
less than 1%, I\'m not really interested in it [1].

[1] If rolling all "1"s is required in a given task system [2],
    then I don\'t mind leaving the possibility open for someone
    rolling 5 "1"s on 5d6 but the system should be designed to
    work for someone rolling 1 or 2 dice.

[2] Not a canon task system. The point is that I don\'t want
    to have a system that is massively complicated in order
    to handle all manner of extremely unlikely events.

    That way lies Rolemaster :-)


So the question is:

	What is the chance of being killed by a .22 ?

	How much skill is required to make that chance 1%, 5%, 50%, 100% ?

	Do the task systems accurately model these numbers?

Actually, I remember reading once that .22 caliber guns were very popular
among mafia executioners at one point or another. I never found out why
though.

TNE has a simple bleeding rule for critical wounds. On page 288 of TNE
Mk1mod1 it says that characters with critical wounds must receive medical
attention within 10 minutes or die 9note that this doesn\'t apply to head
shots, as a critical to the head automatically reults in death).

Actually that bit\'s not awesomely clear. It uses the phrase "damage value",
and it\'s not very clear whether this is the rolled damage or the number of
dice rolled.

There was an LAPD officer who was hit in the foot by a .22 round, went into
shock, and died before aid could arrive.  I use that story along with the
guy who survived a point-blank .45 round to the head to illustrate the
difficulty in accurately modeling gunshot wounds.

Low signature.  You can fire a .22 and it\'s hard to hear ten feet away.  If
you are firing directly into the back of someone\'s skull (the traditional
method), a .22 is plenty big enough.

Also, a .22 is small and easily concealed from casual examination.

What makes that *really* funny is that someday I want to put together a

can easily get away with claiming to be an X-boat pilot. After all,
there\'s no room to excercise on those things.

Actually, I find them fairly well written. Stirling takes on an
*extraordinarily* difficult task and pulls it off. The Draka are
*alien*. To use John W. Campbell\'s old "rule", they think as *well* as
humans, but not *like* humans. 

They live by a "moral code" that *we* find reprehensible. But they
*follow* it. Complete with all the implied attitudes and consequences. 

He manages to write about these human monsters and make you admire them
even as you loathe them.

That\'s a term for old-guard wargame afficianados, taken from a nickname
for Napoleon\'s guard units. It might be appropriate.

The British were doing just that to colonial merchant ships 
just before the revolution.  John Handcock lost more than
a few ships to \'faulty\' paperwork.  This is one reason why
 
"The right of the people to be secure in their persons,
houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable 
searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no
Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause,
supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly

or things to be seized, unless addictive drugs are
suspected or the possibility of harmful weapons left 
were children might find them"

was added to the constitution as the an amendment.

Human...If a Cro-Magnon walked up to you on the street and said hello,
well, you\'d just say hello back. Cro-Magnon is not a subspecies
designation but an archaeological/cultural one, they were H. Sapiens
sapiens just like us. On the average they were a bit bigger than us, but
all the evidence indicates that was because they lived a healthy outdoor
life _and_ had abundant food sources....Most modern descriptions of
Neandertals indicate, with a shave, haircut and a suit, you\'ld hardly
take a second glance at them, either.

Patton\'s exact words from an address to his men were: "Now I want you

He won it by making the other poor, dumb bastard die for his country."

I remember (this was over 10 years ago or so) a girl wa skilled ina
shopping mall by so idiot who was using a nail gun to drive a nail
into drywall. Went through the girls head and killed her. Heavy
loads for those are lighter than .22LR, and a 10d nail is much
heavier than a .22 slug. (meaning that the round had less energy)

Anyway.  I\'ve got several questions about the ship\'s characteristics.
I understand that there are a number of Zhodani ship plans in/out of
print.  I\'ve never seen any of those plans, so I based my deckplans 
on the image from page 43 of A4 Leviathan.  Are there special
features of a Zhodani ship that I should be aware of?

The next issue is a minor one.  No matter how I calculate it, the cargo 
hold of 24.15 tons seems to be a bizarre number.  Its been 13 years
since I really got into these plans, so perhaps I\'m a little lost on weapon
tonnage. Am I missing something?

My vote goes for "Tommy" from the Rudyard Kipling poem of that name. If you
read the following refrain you\'ll see that it has more than one TML related
refernce...

        The kill range for a .22 long-rifle round is in execess of 5000\'
(1500m).  This is presuming that you get struck somewhere important, such as
head or heart.  The problem is that the round has enough energy to
penetrate, by not enough mass to blow through...  so the round lodges and or
richochets around the interior.  This is Bad News, medically.  Get shot in
the leg with a .22LR, and unless it pops the cartoid, you are going to live,
presuming medical care is available.

for MT.
Summarize most of what happened in one form or another, and resolve the
loose ends, 
such as the Emp Wave, the Black Curtain, Survival of the Star Vikings, The
Zhodani

From the film \'My Blue Heaven\'

(Steve Martin is a mafia enforcer turned informer)
" And then he shot him with a .22. They\'re small and leave, you know, a
teeny little hole. A .45 gets stuff everywhere. It requires a lot of
dry-cleaning afterwards."

  The coup de grace was when we convinced them that Michael J. Fox was a
cultural icon; their decline from greatness post-Reagan can be directly
attributed to this (viz. Bush, Clinton).

  Of course, now that I\'ve told you that you\'ll have to be re-programmed,

Hasselhoff! - truly your culture is irredeemably far gone) should reduce
anyone to a suitably quiescent gel atop their spinal cord...

  I meant that the Coast Guard isn\'t financed to support a much larger
establishment because the government isn\'t too genuinely concerned with
searching every boat that enters or exits US territorial waters, as it
might be if the phrases "illegal aliens" or "war on drugs" were replaced
by "Trotskyite sabotage/terrorism agents", etc.

I like the one in _Cartridges of the World, 4th edition_ by Frank C.
Barnes. Two guys had a shoot-out over a girl. One had a 9mm Luger the other
a .32 pocket semi-auto. Both men were wounded several times, as the gun
fight moved from the gas station where it started to the car park of the
local hospital, at which point both ran out of ammo. Both walked into the
hospital, and both recovered.

Apparently quite a few people die each year from .22LR bullets, partly
because .22s are often not treated with the respect any firearm deserves,
but also because people hit by stray .22 bullets often don\'t realise that
they\'ve been shot, and assume that the hole is a shallow puncture from a
thorn or something else. They then die from infections, etc a few days later.

I am interested in some feedback, ideas, and timeline checks.  A few of the
race details will follow.  I really want to get away from the concept of
"humans in suits" and create some different races.

One day I may get to play!

History of The Beyond Sector
* c. -300,000 Ancients reign. In the aftermath of the great war different
types of Humanati minor races are scattered across the region. Races include
Zhodani, Floriani, and Mal\' Gnar
* -20000 Sred Ni reach TL 0. Now may be described as sentient species.
* c. -2300 Scattered Vilani explorers and lost ships are reported to have
traveled through the area. Some artifacts have been discovered, mostly in
the Trojan Reach subsector. See Vilani Settlements.
* c. -2100 a group of Terrans leave the Terran Confederation, fearing it
will fall to the Vilani Empire. They pick a destination a long way from the
Vilani Empire, towards spinward. Historians believe that the refugees all
worked for a major corporation headed by an eccentric leader. Most of the
individuals came from the Europe and North America regions on Terra. A major
misjump lands them in what is now called The Beyond. How the sector got the
name is an ongoing debate. Some argue that it refers to the size of the
Vilani Empire and having to go "beyond" their reach. Remnants of what is
believed to be their ship can be found in the Founders Museum on Corell.
* c. -2050 colonists arrive on Earth-type planet in hex 0119. They name it
Corell after the captain of the ship who died as the ship was approaching
the planet. Colonists have TL 10. Early years are surprisingly easy as the
planet is extremely hospitable for humans. Early programs focused on
building the industrial capability to survive and expand the reach of "true"
Terrans before the aliens reach this sector. The original idea was that each
world ran its own affairs independently and cooperated in interstellar
affairs. This led to the settlement of a large cluster of space by a variety
of people. "Kooks" and idealists from the original settlement set up
"utopian" colonies. Some died out. Some evolved into more practical
governments. Most prospered. This is often called the "Dreamer Era".
* c. -1000 after a period of extensive colonization, human populations
occupy most of The Beyond and Vanguard Reaches sectors. However, problems of
communication and travel times leave human space as a group of small states.
Large jump ships are in short supply, so RAM ships are the primary means to
move large number of colonist and supplies to new planets. Companies and
colonist have moved beyond the reach of centralist government on Corell. The
one common goal of these scattered planet states is survival. This stems
from a strong belief that a large interstellar power (Vilani) is closing in
and they must preserve the heritage of "Earth" and "Humaniti".
* c. -600 original state, the Corellian Federation, reaches TL-12. With the
new technology and industrial power the Federation begins to reclaim all of
the scattered colonies. This period of conflict lasts until -120, and is
referred to as the Restoration Wars.
* c. -400 Homeworld of Sred Ni visited by colonizing / exploration mission
from a Corellian Federation Planet. The scouts determine that the aliens
have achieved approximately a TL 2 society. Hostility and attitudes of
aliens leaves scouting mission to classify the planet as a Red Zone and
cancels any plans to colonize. This contact has a profound impact on the
Sred Ni, who until that time felt that they existed alone in the universe.
From this point on they became obsessed with reaching the stars, and
controlling them. The contact also results in the Corellian Federation
declaring all newly discovered planets under TL 4 off limits to interference
from space. Some of the more aggressive member systems interested in further
expansion without interference from the federation, and move to block the
vote. The end result is a consolidation of power by the Federation.
* -243 The Corellian Empire is formed. All power in government now
controlled by one person, Emperor Alexander I.
* -170 Floriani expansion begins.
* -120 Restoration Wars end. Corellian Empire now controls over 50% of the
sector.
* c. 200 Corellian Empire is contacted by the Third Imperium for the first
time. Fears of a large interstellar empire are capitalized on by the
government to strengthen its hold on population.
* 398 Corellian Empire reaches TL 14.
* 436 Emperor Alexander VI dies heirless. The succession wars start - a
bitterly fought civil war. Unfortunately, fighting on the most industrial
and highly populated planets destroys the heart of the empire.
* 506 Florian League formed.
* 525 Corell falls to TL 10 in aftermath of succession wars. War ends due to
lack of resources with which to maintain forces and ships. Empire falls.
* c. 620 Altarian Confederation enters sector.  Force / purchase seven minor
planets from the weakened Corellian Empire.
* c. 720 The Sred Ni discover debris from the succession wars.
* c. 750 Die Veltbond and Stormhaven Republic governments formed, start
expanding in vacuum of Corell collapse.
* c. 770 Sred Ne discover large asteroid heading towards their home world.
Mass exodus to seven habitable planets / moons within the system starts.
Rapid improvements in technology and expansion beyond the system follow.
* c. 800 Traders from Third Imperium enter sector from coreward/trailing as
security increases.
* c. 850 Zhodani influenced colonists enter coreward regions of sector.
* c. 870 Marrakesh Trade Association formed with help from the Third
Imperium to act as a counter to the Zhodani.

where they came from.
* c. 1117-1119 The political situation in The Beyond is now in a state of
flux.  The landless ihatei of the trans-Rift colonies are starting too
expand. Backed by their fellows in the Hierate, they are sweeping out of
Aslan territory into the vast no-man\'s-land of the Trojan Reach\'s central
subsectors. As they pressed onward into Imperial territory, lesser powers
were overrun, and the refugees started fleeing into the Beyond. The
governments in the Beyond were not equipped to handle the sudden explosion
of humanoids fleeing the Aslani onslaught. Only the fact that the Sred Ni
were licking their wounds and not able to mount an effective offensive gave
the Beyond time to start absorbing the refugees. Apparently, the Aslan are
content with these holdings, as they have not started moving towards Beyond
territory in the years since. Sophontologists are quick to point out that
this is atypical Aslan behavior, as enough ihatei remain landless to intrude
upon Beyond worlds. Others, however, point to rumors of high-tech Florian
weapons, hastily put into production as the ihatei first crossed the League
borders, and the rapid build up of fleet elements by the governments within
the Beyond Sector.
* 1120 Current day. The Sred Ni War continues as stalemate. Superior alien
technology (TL 13-15+) and masses counteracted by human tenacity,
initiative, and larger fleets as well as deep strike raids focused on
neutralizing the Sred Ni\'s high tech capabilities. No end to stalemate is
expected. Sred Ni themselves seem occupied by some unusual fighting within
their borders. The Aslan seem to be content with holding what they have been
able to grab, or they are focused on the richer targets to coreward. The
Zhodani lost major fleet elements in the battle of (****), and seem content
to leave the status quo.  It also might be that the rumors are true about a
major discovery during the latest core expeditions that is drawing all of
the Zhodani attention away from the Beyond.

someone on this list I think.  However, I thank you very much for some great
ideas.
Sred Ni:
The Sred Ne is a minor race that is arachnoid but mammalian. Their capitol
is the I\' Sred Ne Heptad (2908). Like insects the Sred Ne are specialized at
birth and their physical description vary according to their Zreen (Class or
job description). As near as is possible to estimate the "average" Sred Ne
is about 1.1 meters high, 2 meters long, and weighs about 75 kg. It walks on
six legs and has two arms with digital hands. Its body is covered with long
fur and it has no chitin or exoskeleton. The Breeders (A semi-intelligent
Zreen that produces and nurtures offspring) usually lay eggs in groups of 8
to 14. Most eggs hatch and the majority are Workers. Other Zreen include
Leaders, Sages, Warriors, Technicians, Hunters, and Coalescers. It is this
latter that is the most unique to the Sred Ne. Any small gathering of
individuals at which a Coalescer is present can form a Link. Those in the
Link can communicate telepathically and have access to portions of the
Racial Memory. This makes Links the primary method for making decisions.
Rumors are false that the Sred Ne have a hive mind with no free will or
individuality. Although Sred Ne are hostile towards outsiders, those who
have escaped the Sred Ne testify that unique personalities can be
identified. Although their Zreen limits their mental attributes, only the
Breeders appear to have low intelligence. Even the common Worker is far from
stupid, as many have found out the hard way.
Two traumatic events have shaped the Sred Ne culture. Fifteen hundred years
ago the Sred Ne were an isolated race just beginning to develop trading and
farming communities (TL-2) when a Corellian Federation scout visited their
home system. This visit was a great blow to Sred Ne self image. For
thousands of years their minds had searched the entire planet for signs of
other intelligent life. Eventually their minds covered the entire globe and
they believed that they were alone in the universe. Now they found out that
there were many races out there more advanced then they were and they were
not part of that great Link. In addition, none of the alien races even
resembled the Sred Ne. It is hard for outsiders to understand the impact of
this discovery on their collective minds. For almost 100 years the Sred Ne
isolated themselves as bloody ideological wars decimated them. These wars
prompted the Corellian Federation to place the Sred Ne under the protection
of a Red Zone. They were to stay in isolation until the discovery of several
cashed Corellian ships that were destroyed during the succession wars. This
galvanized the race to a single cause: expand and conquer the stars.
The second traumatic event that shaped the Sred Ne culture occurred about
350 years ago. Just as the Sred Ne were beginning interstellar exploration,
via generation ships, their scientists discovered that a large planetoid was
on a collision course with their home planet. In a massive effort of racial
cooperation as much of the Sred Ne civilization and population was moved to
seven worlds/moons within their home system. The collision made their
homeworld uninhabitable. The decision was made that none of their new homes
would have priority, and more territory must be occupied if the race was to
survive. It is believed that during the colonization of the Seven Worlds the
Sred Ne discovered an Ancient Site that is providing them with advanced
technology. This was the origin of the Seven World Heptad that is the
capitol of the Sred Ne Web.
The Sred Ne culture that emerged and returned to interstellar space was more
resilient, xenophobic and ready to conquer a crowded universe. The are now
considered to be one of the most adaptable and fastest learners around.
Although the most technologically advanced of all local races (due to the
nature of the Ancient technology discovered), they are still culturally
immature. Sred Ne are bent on racial domination, and are willing to use any
means to advance this. These include manipulating populations, or even mass
destruction.
Due to the relatively recent acquisition of technology, the Sred Ne possess
few major shipyards. Thus, space fleets usually consist of a few extremely
large capital ships carrying small craft for boarding and occupation.
Currently the fleet is TL 13 (small ships) to 15+ (most capital ships). For
unknown reasons the fleet is not yet known to have jump-4+ or TL 13+
screens. Also, other than their starships and a few weapons, the rest of the
Sred Ne has few occurrences of very high technology. Other areas often lag 2
or more TL\'s (TL 11 or so) behind. Some areas are still as low as TL 4-7.
Thus, on a battlefield, there will be large numbers of infantry, but very
few instances of grav tanks and battledress.
Consider enemy implacable foe, no PC\'s from here.
The Web of the Sred Ne
The Web is the political boundary of the Sred Ne Race (See Sred Ne). The
entire region is classified as a red zone. The Sred Ne appear to be governed
by Committees called Links. These Links are gatherings of 3 or more
individuals around a Coalescer. The Coalescers seem to allow the others to
tap their racial memories as well as develop a kind of mental rapport that
makes decision making faster and easier. The Coalescer acts as a catalyst.
He makes no decisions and takes no part in discussions but he is necessary
for a Link. There is a semi-permanent Link called the Web Masters that
controls overall Sred Ne affairs from the home Heptad. Policy decisions are
made by links. Leaders run the day to day affairs.
Sred Ne have clear and distinct classes that are visible just by appearance.
Leaders make all non-policy decisions. In fact, without leaders or a Link,
little can be decided. That is not to say that if you kill the Leaders the
soldiers will stop fighting. Leaders decide strategy or goals for Sred Ne
individuals, but they have enough skill to decide how things are done.
The Web is fairly low tech, the highest worlds average about Level B, but
they are learning fast due to the Ancient technology discovered. They are
hostile towards outsiders and are extremely xenophobic. They do not allow
non-Sred Ne visitors in their space.  Consider the Web to be classified as a
Red Zone for travel.

Energy always comes up in a discussion small arms rounds. For most rounds,
energy is not nearly as important as where the bullet hits and how much damage
it does. A .22 through the eye into the brain usually kills because it is so
easy for it to do damage; energy is irrelevant (an arrow or a rod pushed
byhand through this same pather probably kills too).

In my last sesssion two PCs were killed by direct hits by FGMP-15s. I\'m curious

     This was great!  Would you consider bringing the time line up to 1201
for those of us who play TNE?  Or at least provide some ideas as to how
they would have dealt with the Rebellion, and the Virus.  Where exactly is
this sector located?  Do you have a map for it?  And the most important
question, could I see the map for use in a small project I\'m working on?  I
need a place like this with the history shown it would be perfect.  I hope

That would be a neat trick, since there is no Cartoid (artery or vein)
in the body and the "Carotid Artery" (external and/or internal) are in
the neck, not the leg.

Leg wounds most likely to cause hypovolemic shock would result from
hits in the Femoral Artery or Vein, the Anterior or Posterior Tibial
Arteries, the Anterior Tibial Vein, or the Great or Small Saphenous
Veins.  Any other location south of the Pelvis is most likely to
just cause seepage and discomfort.  (This precludes nerve damage
and fractures.)

They are subsonic, and thus can be supressed. They also are very neat. You
shoot someone in the head at point blank range, and there is usually no exit

Cool. You dont have these legal rights in the Imperium. However, there are

Both are good points. I had read it somewhere (and now I\'d love to know

That\'s quite true, Doug.  A .22 round that kills outright, or even
delivers a mortal wound, should be a rare, but possible occurrance,
and a .45, point blank to the head, that doesn\'t kill or mortally
wound should be equally rare.  Not to get into specific systems, and
without getting too complicated I think it *can* be modeled.

Task to shoot someone with a gun.
  Difficulty based on Range. Appropriate Asset (Skill+Attribute...or
whatever).
  Shot to Head or body, doubles damage.

Results:
Marginal success (perhaps, they made it by the exact roll required)
results in a "graze" causing very minor injury (a scratch, perhaps
only 1 point) regardless of the damage roll.
			
Critical success (however the specific system does it) results in a
doubling of any damage rolled. (A shot to the head or body would
result in x4 damage!)

Success results in a normal damage roll.

Failure results in a miss.

Critical Failure (however the specific system does it) results in a
miss plus the chance of damage to friendly parties, a weapon
jam/misfire/explosion, or other outcome dangerous or damaging to the
firer.

A .22, perhaps, only does 1d6 points of damage, but if it is
successfully fired into the target\'s body or head it may do as many as
12 points, and if a critical success was achieved on the "to hit" task
as many as 24 points. That should be enough to put any unarmored
humanoid in mortal danger.

A .45, perhaps, does 2d6+1 points of damage, but if the success is
only marginal then the target recieves minor damage regardless of the
roll (perhaps only 1 point). On the other hand, a normal success would
result in an average of 8 points damage (avg: 16, max: 26 to body or
head) and a critical success to the body or head could inflict as many
as 52 points (on average 32 points)...either of which should be enough
to drop a cow! ;->

This is part of the combat system that I\'m slowly putting together.

The are sensitive to insults, but why should they consider it an
insult.  Even a touchy human wouldn\'t consider uplifting a
chimp to be an insult to him (why should it, he isn\'t a chimp).
Neither is a Vargr a dog who is going to care what someone
does to s a dog.

If anyone in the US gets a chance, listen to NPR (National Public Radio)

signs and pinpoints penetrations (wounds) for remote battle medical

Tomorrow a RealAudio version should be up at

This seems a very Travish bit of technology to me. Kind of what I\'ve

fighter design for special operations. Specified design parameters included:

* Advanced lightweight armor
* Very fast acceleration
* Streamlining for flights from planetary bases
* Use of advanced laminate armor for low mass and defensive purposes

The desire of the NightHawk program was the result of these goals. The
mission profiles are limited but essential to Imperial security: remain
undetected for as long as possible, launch a surgical strike against an
opponent taking away their offensive capabilities then fleeing from the area
before more conventional naval combat is required. Standard ordinance in
three missile racks.

The NightHawk fighter fulfills this need. On 020-1120 the first NightHawk
squadron was deployed for defense purposes with the 212th Fleet at Jewell.
This program is highly classified and the Navy denies any knowledge of the
NightHawk fighter.

Well, considering that it would be unaffected by Virus (since it\'s on the other side of the Reggies from the Core), about all that should change too drastically would be some pops & some tech.

The problem with all these kinds of discussions  is  that  people
often build their  (mis)conceptions  of  reality  from  anecdotal
evidence.  This is true in real world political debate too:  Some
people are afraid to fly but think  nothing  of  driving  to  the
airport (due to press coverage  given  to  plane  crashes);  many
parents now drive their kids to school to avoid abduction despite
the risk of death by car accident being far higher (for the  same
reason); etc.  An accurate RPG combat system should be  based  on
real world probabilities but  be  flexible  enough  to  throw  up
abnormal events from time to time.

As a non-expert I believe energy _is_  important  to  determining
armour  penetration  and  average  damage.   IMTU  if  armour  is
penetrated then I use a 2d roll where:

    2 = scratch,
    3-11 = normal damage
    12 = kill

Thus the average damage for a .22 may not  _normally_  be  enough
for a kill, but sometimes you do hit a vital spot (like the eye).
The question in my mind is: how abnormal are abnormal events  (is
2d enough or should it be 3d ... or more)?

Andy and Sarah Lilly made some up for the BITS stand - it comprises a grey
jump suit plus webbing and a nice bb replica Robocop gun, sorry Gauss
Pistol. They did a whole set of badges based on designs in Traveller for
units eg Lift Infantry, Scouts in WBH etc.

They do have a limited number available - I\'d email Andy directly if you\'re

There will be pictures on the new BITS site... ;-)

	Vacuum dries their tongues out too much ... experienced Vargr just
stick their noses and/or tongues on the window. Ever been in a car

	Not so tongue in cheek: the US Navy somehow got convinced to declare
Windows NT the "standard" to be used for various onboard projects.
Then a cruiser (I believe the USS Indianapolis, but I\'m not sure) got
stuck in harbor for six weeks when they tried to install it ... and
crashed the entire ship.

This I have not problem with.

Well, if you are only talking about about a limited amount (and I
make no commitment either way about the 3% number) then it might
be reasonable.  However, that will have a limited effect on
crimes like piracy and smuggling.  Whether the effect will be
enough to justify the bother, and wether the Imperium wants to get involved
in things like checking cargoes, could be argued either way.
I must say that, as I picture the Imperium, I think their will
be an attitude that there are other ways of catching criminals
and they don\'t want to bother with it.

>this is low overhead

The cost is low for _one_ event.  If it is extensive (which it can
esp. be if you look at the policy you are proposing for one issue
and then extrapolate it to every other record of a similar importance
that might be tracked), then it  can add up.  (I\'ve never seen
a department listed that would do this, though admittedly I\'ve
never seen anything that claimed to be an exhaustive list of
Imperial agencies).

I don\'t see how this addresses the question of whether records
are sent back to source worlds for verification.  Legal will be
useful either way.

Trying to
find someone with a trail that is months old will be a tricky
matter, esp. since the rate at which you can spread the
word about them isn\'t much faster than they can travel
(if at all).  And all they have to do in that period of
time is shake their paper trail once.

How do the "seem" to be running away?  It\'s not like we are talking
about pushing through a crowed yelling about how you need to get
away before they catch you.  The point of ID fraud, and similar
crimes, is that it isn\'t know that you are doing it.

way around?

*Sigh*.  Here we go again.

In addition to this post, Doug Berry previously commented on how
quiet the.22 round is.  Doug\'s considerable firearms experience not
withstanding, they\'re only "quiet" in comparison to centerfire calibers.
Also, the .22 LR (Long Rifle) cartridge, which is the most heavily
sold of all the .22 caliber variants available in the U.S. (and the
rest of the western world, for that matter) is *very* supersonic.
Check any copy of "Cartridges of the World" for verification.  They
can be supressed, either by porting the barrel (and thus reducing
some of the slug velocity), or by using a less energetic cartridge
(the .22 shot is subsonic, but terribly under-powered for this sort
of use.)

The main reason .22\'s are such popular assassin\'s weapons is that,
when shoved against the victims head or body before firing, the
body absorbs the entire report, exhaust gases and all.

In a crowd similar to a typical Manhatten workday sidewalk, you "bump"
your victim, there\'s a barely noticable "thump", and you walk away as
he/she falls.  By the time anyone figures out the heart attack they
just witnessed was actually a homicide, you\'re alreaddy one and a half
blocks away, dumping the gun in a trash can.  One more block and you\'ve
dumped the gloves. Five minutes later and you\'re on the Red Line headed
for Brooklyn.

Awesome!! I only saw it silent, since I don\'t have a sound card in my PC

I saw a show a few weeks ago that had an archiologist that said
Neandertals were a different species.  To be fair they had another
archiologist that said they were a different race (i.e. caucasion,
oriental, negro, neandertal)

Dave,

Maybe it was not Windows NT fault entirely maybe it had some onboard
assistance from some *bored* sailors.<G>

Windows NT is DOD level three compliant according to co worker who in his
own words "worked for many 3 lettered Government agencies over time".<G>

Windows NT was not the main culprit is was the *Brain Trust* that was
responsible implementing the concept, with the USN Gold Braided REMF\'s
assistance, with a few Sand Crabs thrown in for good measure.

=======================<p>

Classic Traveller was unique in it\'s time in that characters started out experienced.  I liked the system because of how it allowed us to begin doing important stuff right away (instead of running through boring early levels to build a character), plus it allowed players to join at any point with a new character (or to bring in a replacement for a dead one).  The system does allow for training, but, no, you don\'t really learn by doing (other than getting a zero skill once you are familiar with something).

Perhaps characters could be allowed to change over the years.  As is true of most of us after 30 or so, it is hard to pick up new "skills" or "training" without losing effectiveness at those we have previously developed.  Our experience, however, allows us to continue getting better at "interaction";  Admin, Leader, Tactics, Forgery, Streetwise, etc. may continue to improve for many years after our H-to-H Combat, Blade or Vehicle skills have begun to lose their edge.  This is partly compensated for by reduction in the physical characteristics to aging(losing positive or gaining negative DMs), but there is something lacking in the "becoming an old sage" department.  <b>Perhaps there could be a new non-physical skill roll allowed every fourth year, so that as we fail our aging rolls we can be gaining some experience?</b>

With regard to the laminate armour, if the other side are shooting missiles
at you, then I\'d say your mission has failed.

I really dont like the idea of a fighter with only missiles, and no
secondary armament. In effect, you are paying MCr 4 per missile in the salvo.

I\'d think strongly about taking it up to 12 dtons, and adding a fixed TL12
laser and another m-drive unit.

Finally, has anyone looked into building a combustion laser or other
distant-effect missile warhead in Gurps ?

At the risk of getting way off topic...

I have never used an operating system that caused me more headaches and
swearing than Windows NT. Period. I am a professional computer programmer
by trade. I\'d like to think I know what I\'m doing (been doing it for 10
years). The systems experts in our office are all MCSE (Microsoft Certified
System Engineer). And yet nothing in my office give me more trouble than
this "flawless, crashproof" system.

I\'ve used (and am using) Windows NT Workstation, Windows NT Server, Windows
95, Windows 98, Mac OS, Linux, SCO, BeOS, HPUX, and Solaris. In my mind,
Windows NT follows dead last. Big, bloated, slow, and not reliable (in my
experience), I\'ll stick with my Windows 98.

I now return you to more appropriate Traveller material...

Each check has a limited effect. But they add up, leaving a smuggler with
the task of fighting against the probabilities.

You also get to work backwards if you do crack a corrupt broker, by
subjecting their other customers to a higher level of checking.

By the way, David, what do you think the Imperium would do to try and catch
pirates and smugglers ?

I can think of lots who could do this (IN, IISS, MinCommerce, local
governments). Who would do it will vary from time to time, and I think from
place to place.

Basically, the check will cost fractions of a percent of the cost of the
cargo being carried. And if we have a staff, then they can do it wholesale.

Most commercial shipping with go at jump-3 or -4, tops. This is slower than
news ships will go (news is the most value-dense of all cargos). Most
commercial shipping will also stick to some sort of operating area or
route, because gaining local knowledge is costly.

You have a basic description of the ship (400t, jump-3, maneauver-2, power
plant 390 MW output), the captain and so on.

Oh, I\'d say a ships log that indicates that they are moving away from, say,
Mora at an average of jump-3 would do it. So would a complete lack of
references to the ship in subsector\'s commercial shipping registers.

The ship\'s wedge is *much* stronger than the missile\'s. So the missile
will get shredded before it can damage the ship.

Easy. If you just drop them out the back, you have just limited their
initial course tracks by quite a bit. Also, there\'s only so much space
to drop them from. There\'s a lot more space for launchers along the
sides of the ship.

DGP\'s Solomani & Aslan included some history about the \'Gene War\', which 
invloved primates geneered for zero-g work.  The primates (\'Orangs\' and 
\'Gibbons\', Simians collectively) were secretly uplifted to full sentience as 
part of a project to create \'supermen\' (and a nasty witch hunt/war against the 
supermen resulted).  The Simians are still around.

<< 
 I\'m curious what people think about this - particularly Marc, as he\'s
 working on T5. I never had a big problem with it - character\'s gained
 money, items, renown, etc...but what do people think? >>

As Traveller evolved (in original CT, characters got basically one skill per
term), we have moved toward 1 skill per year as a defacto standard. People
want to improve in skills and its hard to stand against that desire. 

Anyway, I think a good experience rule is important, and I think T5 will have
a good one. Draft text below.

EXPERIENCE
	The completion of the character generation process does not end the
accumulation of skills. Characters receive one skill level every year.
	Experience Points (EP). An experience point is expressed as a skill and a
point (such as Pistol-1*). It is followed by an asterisk to distinguish it
from a skill level.
	Procedure. At the end of every game session, the game master awards EPs.
After evaluating the game activities, the game master awards one EP to each
character, based on the skill which was best or most effectively used by the
character during that session. Each player records the EP for his or her
character.
	On the characters birthday, EPs are examined. The EP with the highest level
of usage is converted to one level of skill and awarded to the character. All
other Experience Points are lost.
	Aging Bonus. In addition to normal experience skill increases, each time the
character consults the aging table (on his or her birthday), the character may
receive one level of skill in any skill listed on a Life Pursuit card
(alternatively, the second highest level of Experience Points is converted to
a skill level for the character).
	Restrictions. Because Experience Points can only be awarded in terms of
skills actually used, they can only be awarded in skills already held by the
character, or in default skills. The only ways of acquiring non-default skills
not already held by a character is through education (through formal education
or instruction by another character), or from an Aspiring Life Pursuit..

Then again, Mexico likes for United Statesians (as the sometimes call us) to

Mexicans consider themselves). So the Central American border starts at the US

If you are referring to det-lasers you can find some GURPS Vehicles expansion
rules at (http://www.io.com/GURPSnet/Archive/Vehicles/Construction/V2ad/).  If
instead you are referring to chemical cartridge lasers my own solution to that
was to build the laser with non-rechargeable power cells, one cell/cartridge
per shot/burst.

  Yep - if the US annexed Canada and then allowed genuine elections,
you\'d have self-avowed socialists in Congress - and probably three
or four more parties than you\'re used to.

  OC, Canada couldn\'t allow elections in any ex-US provinces until
we\'d been able to brainwash the youth for a generation; Clinton\'s

Say what?  In all my life growing up in Texas, I have never ever
heard such a thing.  And I\'ve known many Mexicans.  In my experience,
you\'ve got:
- -Mexicans,
- - Texicans,
- - Gringos, and
- - Norteamericanos.

Two reasons I chose laminate- 1- just in case they are seen and 2- its
lighter. Here\'s my thought.

If I\'m running a game I want the realization of military overspending and
thought. Laminate armor costs more but- hell- we got the government coffers
open. Let\'s spend it. Cutting costs doesn\'t belong in a realistic military
simulation. Keeping the price down is for the civilians- only they care
about it. So, whats a few MCr\'s for a few tenths of a G accel.

See, in my game the military overspends and things in rigid ways. If you
like, switch to regular armor but go to the expensive stuff.

As for missiles only- get the hell out! Here\'s the tactic: when you see the
enemy hit by surprise and take damage scramble squadrons of Ramparts and
finish them off!

But I think you are right- screw the laminate.

  Now there\'s a system simple enough for a munchkin to understand - although
they may misread it as "must wear armour immune to man-portable weapons". In
CT, having the "12" read as double damage still makes for a real effect - the
worst you could do with even a pathetic (2D) round would be a third of the
average targets hit points.

  I\'m trying to decide whether to run under GURPS: Traveller, MT, or CT rules.
For CT I used to use Striker modified by a relevant JTAS article for partially
penetrating hits; if I don\'t use G:T or MT I\'ll probably use a chart giving
a -1D damage modifier for most of the extremities (per DA:6), and a +1D for the
head and possibly for part of the thorax. In either case, criticals will
basically
do double damage, so a basic CT SA round could easily do 4-8 D (3+1, doubled?)
on a head hit. <splat!>

  Even a munchkin could start to evolve after a few of those...

  What sort of location/bleeding rules did you devise?

  Well, it\'s a reasonable GM fiat if the hit was to a limb, and the rest of
the target was covered by cloth or so (MP hi-energy weapon bursts have a fairly
low Penetration under Striker/AHL, IIRC).

The IN has other things to do than play customs inspector. Their

Imperium. The intelligence agencies have intelligence to gather.

Checking every thirtieth trader to see if he\'s trying to make a
dishonest credit? The mind boggles. If it\'s information and not
enforcement you want, you can do random sampling a lot less less
intrusively. 

>You check the actual cargo against the manifest:

Not without an army of inspectors, and not until the goods are offloaded,
you don\'t.  Going into a ship\'s cargo hold and cracking open stowed and
sealed containers to find out if they really contain what they say they do
is a good way to make honest merchants hate you.

Add at least two weeks per jump, for round-trip information flow.
(request plus reply). By the time you compile and get the
information to your neighbors, it\'s already a month old or more.
Then consider the rate of clerical errors, and their effect on
false alarms. You have a choice of delayed and untrustworthy, or
reliable but hopelessly outdated.

Control of fencing (of pirated goods) and smuggling is a form of
regulation.

My biggest beef with T4 is that it supposedly does this, but most of the
technical information stops well below the tech level in my campaign.
For those of us running un-shattered Imperium campaigns, we\'re
constantly using TL-15, and pushing TL-16 in places.  I have a small
shipyard in Foreven that\'s pushing out (albeit *very* slowly) TL-16/17
transition warships.

I\'ve used TL-17 components in some ships under MT, but the advantages to
using a TL-17 jump drive with TL-16 power plant (i.e. no anti-matter,
but *much* smaller and more efficient jump drive) vanish in T4.
Suddenly I can\'t fit the drives in the ship anymore.  TL-17?  Apparently
in T4, anyone who has enough of an understanding to use anti-matter
power plants can\'t use the associated technology to improve their jump
drives...?  "I don\'t think so, Tim..." (a US TV sitcom catchphrase)

Also, how come 2000Mw of power generation takes the same crew at TL-18
as it does at TL-12 (crew dependent solely on power output)?  Were the
developers of T4 really telling me that there\'s the same vast number of
people needed to crew a tiny anti-matter plant as a large nuclear plant
of the same output?  Where do they put them all?  Make the power output
big enough and the crew won\'t fit in it anymore.

OK, I\'m using a sarcastic/irritated tone for effect.  I\'m not really
that mad -- I just want high tech levels to be given the proper
attention in T5.  It strikes me that they\'re a mere afterthought in T4,
possibly because of the M:0 focus.  For those of us in unshattered
M:1120, that oversight is unfortunate.

To put my comments in the proper tone, I\'m using T4 for the current
campaign, and will no doubt switch to T5 as soon as enough material is
available.  I have confidence in Mr. Miller.  What he\'s said so far
confirms my expectation that T5 will rock.  I just want it to rock at
TL-15 - 18 as well as at TL-12.

I drew deckplans for the "Shivva" for the third GURPS:Trav book, _Alien
Races_, which I believe is currently at the printers. I was told to base it
on the rather fanciful illustration (in _Leviathan_?), it\'s a weird-looking
ship, with dome-shaped pods sticking out of a tapered cylinder, and other
odd details. The plans use 1 yard GURPS hexgrids, and don\'t show a power
plant. Otherwise, they\'re basically CT-style plans, in terms of stateroom
size and so forth.

But since these are plans for a GURPS version of the Shivva, they may not
be of much use to you.

Best,

GMG

No offence, but are you TNE fiends all blind to the point I\'ve been trying
to make???

That rule is specifically for NPC\'s, and has a DIFFERENT EFFECT upon PC\'s
(double damage vs instant death). TNE WRITES IN NEARLY TOTAL PLAYER
CHARACTER RULES IMMUNITY TO SMALL ARMS SNIPERS!
</sarcasm>
Thus, it fails to replicate consistantly.

That\'s what I\'ve been bitching about for 4+ ^&&%^**^$% YEARS... And T4 went
the OTHER WAY from reality.... Guns don\'t kill with single shots against
joe average in T4... due to the 3d limit. (Yes, I\'m aware of the
multipliers for increased difficulty of shot. That specifically excludes
the random hit kill.)

And, at least one of my regular players seems to be a canon and rules
lawyer, no names, but he\'s on the list.

Alas, I\'ll stick to the single mechanic for damage MT for traveller. I\'ll
use 2300 for the ocasional lark. And I won\'t buy T5.

Again, Bruce, no offence intented...

<rant><Bitch&moan mode=on>
 I just feel like I\'ve said the same thing 5 times this week, and this
happens about 1 time per 6-8 months... over the last 3.5+ years... it gets
tiring. It seems like nobody responds to a whole post anymore, but find
partial responses suggesting I try something I referenced having found
unsatisfactory in an original post to which the responded. I wasn\'t seeking
a solution so I can use TNE.... any TNE WEENIES who think they can convert
me to TNE should check themselves for crainial-intrarectal-retention.  I\'ve
tried it, and many of the fixes, and found the whole bloody system lacking.
Somebody asked why, I explained... then several others started making
suggestions on how tio fix it.... I COULDN"T GIVE A %^&%*$&* any more.
<Bitch&moan mode=off></rant>

And to the gent pointing out the "Critical Bleed  out" in TNE, thanks.. I\'d
forgotten about that... however, it is only criticals....

The Odes of Traveller Odiosity:
CT: where PC\'s couldn\'t learn after they got out of the service.
MT: Where Striker and HighGuard meet, but ships use some form of T-plate
driven sublight constant speed drive.*
TNE: where PC\'s are all Iron-Men.
T4: where all all small arms can be used to KO somebody safely.
GT: where age matters little, and TAS is overpriced.

*I\'ve noted over the years that MT is basically, CT with more skills, and
an improved version of Striker integrated, but still using High Guard for
Ship-Ship combat. MT also uses thrust as speed, and aircraft like maneuver
capabilities, for starship combat. I\'ll admit, even MT has some broken bits.

I will no longer respond to this thread on the TML. Private e-mails, for
those truly interested in the details, are fine.

The lack of secondary armament is a much bigger problem than CompLam armour
in my book. 

By the way, if you ripped the RadStealth and EmCloaking, you\'d save MCr 3
off the sticker cost, and 2t. A TL12 double turret laser will save another
14.4 t, but cost MCr 1.36 extra ... add a single sandcaster to make that 8
t less and MCr 0.24 more.

Net mass saving is 24.6 t, and MCr 1.4 ... mass is therefore 54.3t, so with
600 t of thrust we pull eleven gees.

And there was me wondering why Ditzie was wandering around with a fixed,
manic grin ...

  A possible alternative might be to award a "level increase" each year, without
recording skill usage. Increasing the level of a skill would require a number of
levels equal to the current level in that skill (minimum cost of one). Thus,
buying
a level zero skill (familiarizing oneself with a new skill) occurs over a
year of 
non-dedicated practice/training, as does increasing a skill from level one
to two.

  This does sharply reduce the increase in higher level skills, as increasing
from Pilot-2 to 3 would take two years worth of normal experience allocations;
this results in characters who become broadly more capable post-generation,
and only become extremely skilled during play at a high opportunity cost.
Something like this would avoid the risk that the best "fill in the blank"
(pilot, engineer, medic) among the players will gain a level per year in their
main  skill and quickly cause a resemblance amongst the PC party to your
favourite
Trek versions bridge crew* :)

To prevent the Navigation-1 Pilot-20 problem that may quickly (or not so
quickly) develop... why not retain the experience points from the
non-advancing
skills.  Thus, unless the use of one skill REALLY outweighs the other skill,
a number of skills have the opportunity to advance.

Example: Han has Pilot-2, Bribery-1.  He uses Pilot 12 times (12 EP)
and Bribery 10 times (10 EP).  He advances to Pilot-3 on his birthday and
begins the next year with Pilot-0*, Bribery-10*.  The next year he
accumulates
11 more Pilot EP (Pilot-11*) and 7 more Bribery EP (Bribery-17*), so on his
next birthday be advances to Bribery-2 and begins the next birthday with
Pilot-11*, Bribery-0*.  etc...

I\'ve been trying to stay out of the discussion this time round, but I just
can\'t let that one pass. As has been pointed out a number of times by a
number of people, official news do move a lot faster than most (if not all)
freetraders engaged in legitimate merchant operations. Official news goes in
straight lines by jump-6 couriers whereas freetraders ramble back and forth
as the freight and trade takes them at jump-1 or jump-2. It also moves faster
than freetraders trying to run away from some specific spot, but I\'ll admit
that if someone is deliberately trying to get far, far away from somewhere as
quickly as possibly without trying to make any money on the way, they may
have a slight chance of getting away with it. Especially if they have a lead
of a few months.

The piracy thread, this thread and some others has given me some questions.

1. What level of beureacracy does the Imperium have?
   How many people commonly work under the starport chief?
   How many under a subsector duke?
   Or a sector duke?
   How about the Emperor?

2. Does these officals really use to much time checking who has done
   what two subsectors away, or do they first notice when the 
   starport chief i a far away system issues an offical arrest order?

3. How many such arrest orders can be issued throughout the Imperium
   before officals really don\'t bother with them because it is to much work to
   go through, and start consentrating on local business?

To me it seems that you Hans, and some of the other guys here has a vision
of the Imperium employing millons of clerks, analysts, lawyers. I see the
arguments that the IN is huge because of the tax income that is used on it.
But how much taxes are used on the people working for the Imperium?

Not to mention that commercial shipping usually go by scheduled runs and
in any case have owners with fixed abodes. I thought you were talking
about those footloose, fancy-free freetraders who can go whereever they
want -- as long as going whereever they want enables them to earn enough
money to pay their operating expenses, that is.

KSC is the middle of a *big* wildlife refuge. The animals mostly ignore
the loud noises (It\'s *not* a survival trait to get startled by loud
noises!). There are photos of ducks flying along calmly *between* a
launch and the observation area.

While the gators and other critters occasionaly cause operational
problems, for the most part they either don\'t effect operations, or
they *add* security. All those gators make sneaking onto the site a
*lot* harder. 

Picture an equivalent installation on a colony world. Your team has to
either sneak past tight security at the guarded entrances, or risk
becoming "gator snacks" for the local wildlife. 

This gets especialy interesting when a large, hungry animal is about to
munch on one of the party. Not only will weapons fire draw unwanted
attention, but you could wind up being prosecuted for hunting an
endangered species!

Data point:

A few years back in Oregon, some "hunting budies" got drunk and tried
the William Tell bit. The guy with the beercan on his head wound up
with an arrow thru the eye and all the way to the back of his skull!

Amazingly, he survived with no serious damage other than the loss of
the eye. This was partly because he and his buddies were bright enough
to *not* try to move the arrowe. They just laid him on his back in a
truck and ran him to the hospital.

        I usually had a "drop chart" for critical fumbles and effects...
so, if you hit a 12, do this:

        1-3 ..... x2 effect
        4-5 ..... x2.5 effect
         6  ..... 1-3 ..... x3 
                  4-5 ..... x3.5
                   6  ..... 1-3 ..... x4
                            4-5 ..... x4.5
                             6  ..... x5

        This makes the "WTF?!?!" fluke possible, but not probable.  I
usually only go 3 iterations of the chart...  Otherwise the mutliplier
starts to get obnoxious.

        Here in the RealWorld(tm) Port of Halifax, we get one to three "G3"
container ships and a couple of coastal frieghters every day.  Call us a
"Class B" port...  Canada customs databases the manifest list for every ship
that comes and goes, and "targets" specific shipments for inspection.  For
example, if a given container originated in Colombia, then it gets higher
priority than one that originated in London.  Given that a G3 ship carries
~2000 TFUs, they manage to break seals under warranty and phyiscally inspect
an average of 0.3% of traffic.  Of course, because of the paperwork
pre-screening, these are the *top* of the curve for contraband probability.
They nail something big every month.

        We did this as part of the UN sanctions in the Red Sea against
Iraq...  250 ships in 90 days;  three teams of 9 armed Naval personell
operating from RHIBs with gunship support.  Now, admittedly, all they were
doing was eye-ball filtering the cargo manifest for "funny-looking"
containers and then cracking those ones...  however, in conjunction with 5
other ships from other UN nations, in the 90 days on station we turned back
three merchantmen for carrying stuff not allowed to be shipped to Iraq.

        Nope... you are thinking 20thC tech.  Every cargo container has a
WORM drive on it that has recorded every place it has ever been...
micro-reciever tied to a dedicated computer system in the cartridge
"listens" for the "You are at <PORTNAME>.  The date is <DATE:TIME>" signal
that is transmmited every 15 mins by the starport authority.  The container
records the first time it hears the signal, every time the container is
opened or closed, everytime the wieght of the container changes by more than
5% and the extrapolated DATE:TIME after it *misses* a time check (ie: it has
been loaded into a starship, etc).  Every *registered* starship has the
exact same transmitter in its cargo hold.  It says "You are are aboard the
<SHIPNAME>.  The date is <SHIPDATE:SHIPTIME>".  Same logging routine.
        Every container has a unique ID (like NIC cards).  Customs walks
into the hold, takes out his laptop and presses "QUERY ALL" and every
container in the hold Xmits back to his laptop the summaries for the past
month.  His laptop (being a P^5000-1GHz) with AI routines then sorts the
list based on "Hmmm... *that* looks suspicious" rules and flags the top 5%
of containers.
        Those containers are then taken to a customs holding area for
inspection using a varitey of appropriate technologies.  Once they clear,
they are released.  If they turn up "funny" it is rarely the Merchants
fault;  unless the Merchant has a record of "funny" cargoes at this port
he/she/it is free to go.  Otherwise he/she/it gets zapped by the legal system.

        I use a pretty straight-forward system.  Every player has a sheet
with all thier skills written down on it, and thier Skill Development Points.
        Every time they use a skill, +1 SDP.
        Every time they critical success a skill, +3 SDP.
        Every time they take 1 day formal training, +(Thier Skill Level -
Instructor (Instruct or Skill, which ever lower), Min 1.

        Every year, pick the skill you want to improve (as long as you have
points).  Roll 10+;  DM+ (INT/5) (how fast do you learn), DM+
INT(SQRT(SDP)).  On a success, all SDP\'s are cashed in. On failed attempt,
50% of SDP\'s are cashed in Player can try to roll for up to two different
skills; stop trying after first successful roll.

        It works *pretty* well.... it means than in a 4 year period, they
will get an average of two skills, but sometimes, if life has been intense
or they have been training alot, they can get up to 4.  Which is pretty much
what happens on the character creation tables.

        "Alien" is a good description.  "Ugly" is another.  I like it.  It\'s
obviously a patrol carrier or somesuch.  Not human, I take it?
        I am not a fan of the "corrigated engine component" approach to
drawing.  I\'ve never seen a real propulsion system look like that.  Of
course, I\'ve never seen a fusion reactor or jump drive either. =)

        Besides, information is "ripple effect" driven.  It propagates
outward from the point of insertion into the Government Datanet at various
rates;  usually jump-4.  Eventually, every warrant or what have-you will be
seen by *every* databank in the Datanet.  You can try and keep ahead of the
"ripple" if you like, but eventually this will drive you out of Known Space
into what is functionally Exile.

        Which means it is possible to trip over a warrant from *years* ago
and have to deal with the ensuing headaches ("I was CLEARED, I tell you!").
That and eventually the low-tech worlds would run out of dataspace.  I deal
with these points by having information "expire" in databases based on
priority level and tech level of the planet...  Which means that a backwater
system may have once heard that you were a smuggler, but all the warrants on
your ship scrolled off the bottom of thier databank *months* ago.  The TL15+
world Never Forgets Anything.

Still faster than most free/far traders will go, depending how thick the
X-Boat routes are where you are operating. But the big boys take all
the trade along the X-Boat routes, so your Free Trader was trading

Just a thought:

I didn\'t put unforgable, uncrackable transponders IMTU\'s starships,
I\'m *not* going to put them on every dinky cargo container.

Do these devices go on cargo containers made by TL-5 worlds too?

And again, it doesn\'t matter how good your cargo tracking stuff is.
All you need is a backwater frontier world with an ethically challenged
port master, and you have a point to start a legitimate paper trail from.

Actually, there was a bit of a scandal over these islands during World War
II.  The Free French seized them off the "legitimate French government"
(Vichy) without US permission.  At that stage of the war major elements in
the US government regarded De Gaulle as a fascist.  Later on, once Tunisia
had fallen and the Vichyite troops there had changed sides, the US tried to
engineer a new French government, excluding De Gaulle....

My interest in this:  in mid \'41 "Allied" troops (mainly Australian, with
some Free French, British, Indian and "Arabs" (the latter included many
Jews, such as Moshe Dayan - this is the campaign in which he lost his eye))
invaded "French" Syria and Lebanon.  It was a six week sideshow campaign,
which also happens to have been the only Australian-French war!  The good
guys won!  (Vichy were fascist collaborators, after all...)

I play WWII miniatures.  This was a very colourful campaign, mainly fought
at battalion level, that seesawed back and forth.  The allies were
outnumbered, but still won.  It involved both submarines and camels!  It
had successful cavalry charges, and tanks!  I intend to refight this
campaign some day...

Relevance to Traveller:  none really.  On the other hand, Star Mercs can
(re-)fight anything.  Camels and SDBs?

Another plot hint for military SF:  Take a very close look at what has been
happening in Indonesia in the last week.  Have a look at what the Marines
were doing, compared to the (militarised) Police and the rest of the army.

Sorry, I will include bits of a post I received from another list to finish
what I started saying above.  I\'ll do it in a separate post.

Not much, on a percentage basis.  What is the population of the Imperium
again?

Damn, lucky I was writing this off-line.

Cargoes tend to be documented on chips.  "Paper Trails" might be much more
of a problem for people who use paper than for those who use AI\'s (no, Not
the TL 17 kind) to process electronic data.  Forgery and Computer skills
matter.  True, there is still a lot of processing to be done with finite
resources, but...

OK, by now your PCs want to get out.  Fine.  The Starport Administrator is
a Bwap, and the Starport is garrisoned by Sword Worlders, who don\'t like
them....

Traditionally, in Mil SF, such situations are resolved by a re-enactment of
the 6th century AD "Nika Riots", which were historically suppressed by
Belisarius (and Narses??).  Both Jerry Pournelle and David Drake have
ripped these events off, one with Falkenberg, the other with Hammer\'s mob. 
Even L. Sprague de Camp did a fantasy version in "The Clocks of Iraz".

Come to think of it, I might write a version up for G:T...

 I sincerely hope so, because the contact warheads in CT and GT are
impossible.
 2 reasons:
 1) Scoring a contact hit on a less than 100m target from 
15000- 300 000km away is just not plausible (like trying to hit an F-14
with a homing missile from several thousand klicks, dont think so)

 2) If you somehow did manage to score that contact hit, the result would
not be this or that amount of damage, the target would be _vaporized_ (You
wouldnt even need a warhead, the kinetic enrgy several tons of metal
moving 10-20 km/s would do the trick nicely)

        Here in the RealWorld(tm) Port of Halifax, we get one to three "G3"
container ships and a couple of coastal frieghters every day.  Call us a
"Class B" port...  Canada customs databases the manifest list for every
ship
that comes and goes, and "targets" specific shipments for inspection.  For
example, if a given container originated in Colombia, then it gets higher
priority than one that originated in London.  Given that a G3 ship carries
~2000 TFUs, they manage to break seals under warranty and phyiscally
inspect
an average of 0.3% of traffic.  Of course, because of the paperwork
pre-screening, these are the *top* of the curve for contraband probability.
They nail something big every month.
88*********************8
How big are the shipyards in Halifax? Build ships of just repair them?
Consider how the customs department there may vary with something else in
the same TL.  For example:  The Port of Rio de Janeiro which has both
shipyards and a naval base(the yards aren\'t that big, so call it a B port).
customs is not so tight there, and a few years ago (c. 1990) they caught
some inspectors taking bribes to pass cargoes.

        Nope... you are thinking 20thC tech.  Every cargo container has a
WORM drive on it that has recorded every place it has ever been...
micro-reciever tied to a dedicated computer system in the cartridge
****************
Nope..........you are thinking more than 20thC tech.  No cargo containers
built on TL5 planets would have these...where is you reference for this?


"listens" for the "You are at <PORTNAME>.  The date is <DATE:TIME>" signal
that is transmmited every 15 mins by the starport authority.  The container
records the first time it hears the signal, every time the container is
opened or closed, everytime the wieght of the container changes by more
than
5% and the extrapolated DATE:TIME after it *misses* a time check (ie: it
has
been loaded into a starship, etc).
***********
and at many ports it will never \'hear\' such a thing, how many class E port
have this? Also there are may ways to spoof this.  Vary the grav plates
until the memory fills up for one.....record the starport signal and
rebrodcast that in your hold. even swap computers on containers......or
leave them open all the time, and vary the grav plates ot keep the weight
within 5%. And why would anyone stick a computer on a wooden container
filled with pool-ball fruit? how much does this computer cost? how about
the sensors to determine the weight? the door open/close sensores? the
utra-secure scrambled radios needed for them to work as you describe?  Or
do they all have meson coms?



Every *registered* starship has the
exact same transmitter in its cargo hold.  It says "You are are aboard the
<SHIPNAME>.  The date is <SHIPDATE:SHIPTIME>".  Same logging routine.

none of the GT ship modules have this listed as a component, neither do any
of the other versions of Traveller mention it.

        IMTU, I am running a TL10-11 game set around Terra (see below for
UTUP).  UN is the controlling authority;  Oppresive Fedual Technocracy is
the best description.   The Terran Sphere is about 11 subsectors;
construction of anything involving space flight is very carefully regulated.
While starship transponders and cargo-container tracking systems are hardly
hack-proof, it ain\'t easy (13+ for me to consider that you got passed the
encryption let alone can tinker with it).
        So, IMTU, what I am talking about is not too bad.  However, using
the Imperium model, it still is manageable at the subsector government
level.  The TL-5 worlds can\'t build starships, so most likely and cargo
containers rated for spaceflight are manufactured off-world, too.  And the
containers are the issue, the Tracking Device is;  build \'em on TL-10 worlds
and ship \'em whereever they need to be encorporated into a spaceflight-rated
container.
        I agree with your comment about "ethically challanged" Customs
Inspectors and Port Staff as being the weak link...  That is what the
"Bribery" and "Streetwise" skills are about...  you may not get the
container to "lie" for you, but you can pay the Inspector to check any other
container but that one.  ;)
        No system is infaliable... however, the issue is deployment of
technology to make it harder and harder on the smuggler and allow fewer
Customs staff per port to do more work, more effectively.  In the military,
we call them "Force Multipliers".
        IMTU, the players are starting and R&D firm whose goals are
supposedly to improve the survival characteristics of starship Transponders
and Log Recorders.  Really what they are up to is trying to *crack* the damn
things so they can manufacturer their own for piracy/ smuggling purposes....
Tell me they are the first ones to try this (NOT).

In my last sesssion two PCs were killed by direct hits by FGMP-15s. I\'m
curious
how you managed to let one survive such an attack, given that weapon\'s
damage.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Bob replies... the PC was hit in the leg.
I use a hit location chart, and an average PC can take about 14 points to
the leg.  A FGMP does about average 56 points (low of about 20-30, high
around 80-90)with .5 penetration in my game.

Lets take an average hit to the leg.  At zero the leg is useless, and at -14
points the leg is gone.  Excess damage is applied to the next appendage, the
abdomen.  Here the PC can handle about 20 points,  that brings the damage up
to about -8 in the abdomen.

The PC is in shock, one leg gone, one hanging on by a thread, and bleeding
severely from the lower abdomen area, probably with some intestine  hanging
out.  This PC will die, unless some really good medial attention is applied
quickly.  And even then it is not a sure thing.  Depends on the TL of the
facility.

If I remember correctly the PC in question got really lucky and only took
about 20 points to the leg.  I ruled that it was a near miss, and the damage
was from the heat and energy of the bolt that came within about 1 cm of his
leg.  Very lucky.

BTW, if the abdomen reaches -20, the PC has flat lined.  Only a full trauma
unit can fix that.
Hope this helps.

        We can build small warships locally, and can do dry-dock service on
two costal-size frieghters at once.  Modest size naval base.  BIG harbour

        No, I don\'t.  I was a possible suggestion.
        However, there would be, IMHO, some automated way of logging this
kind of traffic at a starport.  The postulation is that they can build jump
drives and computer programs to handle them...  this oughta be childs play.

        How many cargoes does the merchantman want automatically searched
because there is a gaping hole in the container\'s log records?  IMTU,
Starport Authorities all answer to an off-planet body.  If there is a
control tower there, there is a transponder.  In the case of E and X ports,
the issue is smuggling in, not out, and the local authorities have to deal
with it however they can.

        And in all cases, a smart programmer should be able to come up with
a way to determine a possible spoof in progress and flag it in the log.
Encrypted signals that vary by time, etc....
        Not to say that some enterprising sot couldn\'t figure away around
it... that\'s what the whole point about being a notorious smuggler is about.
The point is to keep the amatuers from lasting too long in the buisness.

        Hmmm...  There goes my "Canon"-detector again.
        The question is how much does the government IYTU *care* about
smuggling.  That will indicate *how much* money they want to spend on the issue.
        I personally have always had a problem with the "wooden containers
in space" idea.  We rarely ship that way now...  break-bulk is so out of
fashion it is stupid.  You put the "wooden container filled with pool-ball
fruit" into a spaceflight-rate modular container (akin to the way we do it
in the RealWorld(tm)) and the recorder/logger is integral to the container.
        20thC piezo electric technology is almost to the point where you can
use it to notice defelction is wieght.  Add 3+ TLs and its a non-issue.
Same thing for the weight of the computer.  The radio systems are easy again
when you can can build a 5000 meter range commlink wieghing 100grams at TL8.
RealWorld(tm) cargo containers need maintence on a regular basis...  when
the hypothetical "smart container" I suggest is in for maintainence, you add
the next 3 months of decryption keys to the computer.  The comms are
*mostly* secure that way.

        Hi, Eppu!
        The modern "Sidewinder" and I beleive "Sparrow" missiles *rarely*
hit the target...  they have proximity radars that det the missle near the
target and put about 2700 1" ball-bearing-type projectiles (Sidewinder) into
the area and try and shred the target.
        Any reason why this wouldn\'t work in CT?  Given the kinetic energy
for any one of those projectiles, you\'d still punch holes all over the hull.
The HE is just there to spray the shrapnel;  this is also a good explanation
for the 1D hits effects of missiles in CT (non-High Guard)....  how close
was it when it went off, so how much shrapnel did you soak?
        Or am I missing something wildly obvious here?

I\'m trying to decide whether to run under GURPS: Traveller, MT, or CT rules.
For CT I used to use Striker modified by a relevant JTAS article for
partially
penetrating hits; if I don\'t use G:T or MT I\'ll probably use a chart giving
a -1D damage modifier for most of the extremities (per DA:6), and a +1D for
the
head and possibly for part of the thorax. In either case, criticals will
basically
do double damage, so a basic CT SA round could easily do 4-8 D (3+1,
doubled?)
on a head hit. <splat!>

  Even a munchkin could start to evolve after a few of those...

  What sort of location/bleeding rules did you devise?

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

I reply:

Simple once you get the hang of it, I have a chart that uses 2D6 twice.
Roll, and look at the chart.

Ex: here is the chest location chart.

6-8	CHEST
	2	 Cardiac        	*Kill*
	3	 Artery         	10+14
	4-5	 Trachea        	7+10
	6-8	 General        	6
	9-10	 Ribs		4
	11	 Lungs		9
	12	 Artery		9+4

if you roll a 6-8 it is a hit in the chest, roll again, and see where in the
chest.  If you roll a 2... KIA.  If you roll a 3 a major artery is hit for
an additional 10 points of damage, plus 14 points per turn in bleeding.
Better hope a medic is near to stop the bleeding!

Any hit without a +# next too it you take only one point of damage per turn.

It seems rules heavy as I write this, but in combat it moves really fast.
Most players roll 4 dice. 2 white dice for the general location, and 2 red
for the specific area.  Then roll the damage.

I wanted a system that mimics some aspects of real life, without being too
slow.  And deadly enough that most players avoided combat whenever possible.

I have found that as soon as a PC is hit, the player starts screaming for
another PC with medic skills to get there ASAP.  I have had PC\'s get into
arguments about who should receive medial attention first.  IMHO this is
VERY realistic.  Having been in that situation once or twice.

Way back when all I knew was CT, I read HG a liitle less literally.
I would look at the factor of various weapons systems, and I assumed
that there were bigger and smaller versions sometimes to get
different factors (like 1 10 ton turret in place of a number of
smaller ones).

In TNE+ (FFS & FFS2) I would look at the TL of the Zho navy, and
design weapons that *worked well* at that TL. Typical published
material has been to cram a crappy laser into a 3 ton TNE turret for
the Zhos when a 4 ton turret could have a good weapon. Why would we
expect Zho weapons to be compatable with Imperial ones? (or Vargr,
or Aslan, etc).

I\'d assume that current (TL15) Imperial standards are such that TL
13-14 Imperial stuff has be refitted with smaller TL-15 sized
weapons so that repairs are simpler. When max Imperial tech was 13,
I bet the weapons were actually bigger than the new standards (IMHO,
IMTU, YMMV :-)

I\'d like to see a nice overview of Zho doctrine (naval) and really
look at making them (and other aliens) have ships that feel
different than Imperial stuff.

However, while I used the basic info from the Paranoia Press, I have
converted the map to fit in the TDG map that was published in one of their

A human Religious Theocracy native to Katanga (2103 A7789DG-A M Hi In).
Several hundred years ago Katanga was settled by followers of the Drak-Arr
Faith. Their unpopular views had gotten them chased out of the Central
Imperial Worlds. In 1109 missionaries capitalized on the fears of the Sred
Ni advances and started massive uprisings on (*****) and (*****). They now
control four planets in the subsector, and are actively sending missionaries
out into the sector.  Many planets have instituted policies restricting
their travel.  However, this has only encouraged their followers.
The Drak-Arr followers believe in Dualism, two mutually antagonistic gods
that are the principal leaders of Good and Evil. Constant devotion is
required, as every word, deed, act or thought is considered a religious act
and is monitored by the Gods. The words of the good god, Drak, are
pronounced by oracles and profits who are controlled by the priesthood. The
religion is open to any human, but is very intolerant of any other sophant
races, in particular, the Sred Ni. Reincarnation is only possible if the
individual dies in a deeply religious act. The greatest act of all is to die
in battle with an alien race. Martial skills are encouraged.
These people believed that the human condition can and should be improved.
They advocate the use of eugenics and gene manipulation to produce a
superior human. Marriage and children are tightly controlled by the
religious leaders. In the past hundred years they have experienced varying
degrees of success.  Some of the followers have proven to be exceptionally
gifted physically or mentally.  Rumors of horribly disfigured mutants hidden
away or killed by the government remain unproved.
Armed Forces: At TL 10 the Kantanga are not a threat military to any major
power in the beyond. However, the message that their missionaries are
carrying is very persuasive (especially the closer you get to Sred Ne
space). Once the Church has its grip in the society of a planet, it has
proven very difficult to stop the eventual fall of the government. The
Kantanga Defense Force is a loose collection of conscripts built around an
elite force of warriors. The average TL of the military conscripts is 8. The
elite force varies between TL 10-14.
Navy: The empire started with very little in the way of fleet elements, but
has started on a crash ship building and buying program. Through some very
devious underground contacts the navy was able to purchase two old
battleships from the imperials. These ships have been undergoing a refit
after sustaining heavy damage during an attempt by one of the major powers
to destroy the ships by sabotage before they became fully operational. Even
in their weakened condition they were able to turn the tide of the battle
over (******), the latest planet to fall under the KE, and destroy a fleet
of Star Mercs hired by the Marrakesh Trade Association to protect the
system. The rest of the fleet consists of a combination of merchants that
have been refitted and small (100-600) ton warships. Katanga itself is
defended by a large collection of TL-11 SDBs. The Empire is having a hard
time keeping the boats in action due to a shortage of spare parts, and is
willing to pay top-credit for anyone who is willing to sell the components.
These boats have been able to stop any concentrated effort to crush the
religious uprising by the exiled government.

I can\'t agree.  IMO, this presupposes that the Imperium does not have
skunkworks-like top secret research facilities supporting the Imperial
Forces to construct "advanced" fighters at the highest levels.  IMTU,
the Imperium would build this "top secret...advanced fighter" at TL 15,
not TL 12.  I don\'t believe that the designers would be willing to
sacrifice 3 tech levels on missions that are "essential to Imperial
security".  

At 1120, Imperial opponents are what, TL 14 pushing 15?  And we are just
now fielding a TL 12 fighter against them in an essential role?  I
wouldn\'t think so.  I\'d start looking for the kickbacks to the Admiral
in charge of procurement....

First, experience is really about experience rather than evenness. If the most
used skill is pilot, then that is really what the experience process produced.
If all this character does is pilot really well, then he becomes the grand old
man of piloting after 20 years onthejob. If he is a well rounded character,
then experience helps round him out.

Also note that there is some opportunity for choice under the Life Pursuit

The phrasing is important and stresses the importance of a good GM and a
personal strategy for skill use for each character.

"At the end of every game session, the game master awards EPs. After
evaluating the game activities, the game master awards one EP to each
character, based on the skill which was best or most effectively used by the

character...."

"best or most effectively used" can clearly be something other than "the most
used" or "the skill with the highest level." So the Scout with Pilot-8 and
Bribery-1 might find himself forced into a gunfight this episode and
frantically defending himself and his friends with a Shotgun (default skill
Shotgun-0. At the end of the episode, the GM says "That shotgun battle was
great (etc)." and awards Shotgun-1*.

Simply awarding (rather than earning) isn\'t really experience. And since the
more or less accepted standard is 1 skill level per year (plus one every four
years), your thought would fall short.

I\'m trying to map experience against 1 skill per year, whichmeans that
characters can keep getting skills at the same rate (more or less) they earned
them when in Prior Career.

This is GURPS tech level, not traveller tech level.  GURPS TL 15 is somewhere

In addition, under G:T as published, lasers are sufficiently effective
in point defence that it\'s nearly impossible to get a hit with a contact
missile (which is as it should be.)

I\'m not sure this is always true - missile can have much higher accelerations,
and ship movements are somewhat predictable - but it might be true for G:T
missiles; since they\'re apparently communicator-controlled only, with no
terminal homing, they\'re operating with a second or so of lightspeed lag
since all their terminal control comes from the firing ship...

Most of these are fixable.  The easiest way is to assume the Aslan overran

Bah.  Use advanced composite armor, it\'s just as light and costs half as much,

 I sincerely hope so, because the contact warheads in CT and GT are

******************
I am, hoping to get them into the Starships book.


 2 reasons:
 1) Scoring a contact hit on a less than 100m target from
15000- 300 000km away is just not plausible (like trying to hit an F-14
with a homing missile from several thousand klicks, don?t think so)
**********
why not?...if the missile is command controled until you get within a few
kicks the sensor head should pick up an F-14 just fine.


 2) If you somehow did manage to score that contact hit, the result would
not be this or that amount of damage, the target would be _vaporized_ (You
wouldn?t even need a warhead, the kinetic enrgy several tons of metal
moving 10-20 km/s would do the trick nicely)
******************8
This missiles are only 300 lb, to get several tons of metal involved here
you would need  40 or so missiles.  and 26.8km sec is 2 hexes per turn (a
very low velocity)  this does 6dx100 damage x velocity (2) x 6 tons of
metal (40 missiles) = 168,000 points of damage, enought to vaporize (11xht)
a ship up to 256 dTons.....

so therfor the missiles in GT do enough damage according to your
definition.

a side note:  One missile with a velocity of 80 hexes per turn (1,073 kps)
will do the same damage but is harder to get a hit with.

This is a \'feature\' of the broken sensor rules in GURPS.  You can generally
resolve it by tossing on a low-power LLTV for terminal guidance, though.

As for hitting with a missile (with a speed probably not exceeding 300
kilometers per second, and typically not exceeding 100) that\'s probably harder
than GT makes it, but its hardly impossible, it doesn\'t really require
precision any higher than your average modern space probe (it\'s a smaller area,
but it\'s also a _much_ shorter range), and it\'s not drastically above
experimental ballistic defense interceptor missiles (and is several tech levels
higher...).

Yes, but suppose the person IS well rounded... or try to be.  If the player
happens to do one thing just slightly more often than his/her other
skills then he/she will not appear to be well rounded.  Imagine
a player who, five years straight, ended up with a close spread
like Gambling-42*, Pilot-42*, Dancing-43*.  Looking at the character
(Dancing-6, Pilot-1, Gambling-1), you\'d think that all the guy can do is 
dance, because that would be the only skill that has advanced.

On the other hand, imagine a real card shark.  Gambling-40*, Pilot-10*, 
Bribery-8* or a similar ratio five years straight will give you a dealer
who can also fly better than the average novice (Gambling-5, Pilot-2,
Bribery-1).

If that seems too even, why not half the unused points?  Or allowing
the player to decide how many points of the unused EPs are to be saved.
Sounds like something that needs modeled and play tested.

        No, I don\'t.  I was a possible suggestion.
        However, there would be, IMHO, some automated way of logging this

And it is for one world with near instant communicatons.  When applied to

        How many cargoes does the merchantman want automatically searched
because there is a gaping hole in the container\'s log records?  IMTU,
Starport Authorities all answer to an off-planet body.  If there is a
control tower there, there is a transponder.  In the case of E and X ports,
the issue is smuggling in, not out, and the local authorities have to deal
with it however they can.

        Hmmm...  There goes my "Canon"-detector again.
        The question is how much does the government IYTU *care* about
smuggling.  That will indicate *how much* money they want to spend on the
issue.
************
IMTU the Imperium doesn\'t care at all.  The only thing thay care about is
nukes and slaves, any customs patroling will have to be done by the
individual worlds (some of which are actually in lowgrade conflict with one
another. So they don\'t spend *any* mony on customs patrol.



        I personally have always had a problem with the "wooden containers
in space" idea.  We rarely ship that way now...  break-bulk is so out of
fashion it is stupid.  You put the "wooden container filled with pool-ball
fruit" into a spaceflight-rate modular container (akin to the way we do it
in the RealWorld(tm)) and the recorder/logger is integral to the container.
********
for the big ships I agree 100%, but is it allways done that way on the
costal freighters?
the ones most like the \'PC Sized\' ship the characters get?


        20thC piezo electric technology is almost to the point where you
can
use it to notice defelction is wieght.  Add 3+ TLs and its a non-issue.
Same thing for the weight of the computer.  The radio systems are easy
again
when you can can build a 5000 meter range commlink wieghing 100grams at
TL8.
***********
but what is the cost of this?  when you buy cargo on spec does it come with
containers?  if so how much cheaper is it without the containers?

A behive load with a better armor divisor.

small seeker head) doing 6dx10 (5) per hit
Standard nukes (better be an Imperial Warship if you have *these*) I need
to buy HT 3ed to get the new nukes in space rules.
Det lasers (Ditto) very expensive

Allong with dedicated PD lasers, and other low tech PD options (chainguns,
railguns and anti missile missiles)


As to the nighthawk fighter, I would definatly give it a laser so that it
can have some PD, or just one missile *will* take it out (just 1 hex of
velocity requires 7 rolls on the major damage table = dead fighter).

My favorite is the drone grav dart from Dune (I don\'t remember its

than a fountain pen, with a sharp point, an anti-grav drive and a
relatively simple sensor suite (maybe just visual/IR).  It\'s remotely
controlled.  The operator tries to drive it into the target\'s body.  I
thought the sequence in the movie was very well done.

I can\'t agree.  IMO, this presupposes that the Imperium does not have
skunkworks-like top secret research facilities supporting the Imperial
Forces to construct "advanced" fighters at the highest levels.  IMTU,
the Imperium would build this "top secret...advanced fighter" at TL 15,
not TL 12.  I don\'t believe that the designers would be willing to
sacrifice 3 tech levels on missions that are "essential to Imperial
security".
At 1120, Imperial opponents are what, TL 14 pushing 15?  And we are just
now fielding a TL 12 fighter against them in an essential role?  I
wouldn\'t think so.  I\'d start looking for the kickbacks to the Admiral
in charge of procurement....

The Imperium is TL 12, the Zhos are TL 11 pushing 12.

If you would look a little closer at the design, it is for the 1120 setting
of GT.

World Space Station Hits Problem-Clear The Camels

BAIKONUR, Kazakhstan, Nov 19 (Reuters) - With the world
poised to enter a new era of space flight with the launch of
the first stage of an international space station, Russian
organisers had a more pressing problem -- how to clear off
the camel herders whose flock graze the launch site.  

Towering over the grassy steppes of Kazakhstan on Thursday
like a pyramid in the Egyptian desert, the first module of the
biggest and most advanced spaceship ever planned was ready
for take-off.  

The Zarya module, which will form the core of the $60  billion
International Space Station, was set for Friday\'s launch  into
orbit aboard a huge Proton rocket.  

But on Thursday Russian officials rushed by helicopter to  the
remote homes of local camel herders near the Baikonur base
Moscow rents from Kazakhstan to urge them to sign
documents pledging they will get out of the way before
blast-off.  

The Kazakh camel herdsmen who live near the space centre
have little to their names but their mud-brick houses, colourful
clothes and herds of shaggy, double-humped dromedaries.

Bah.  Use advanced composite armor, it\'s just as light and costs half as
much,
and it\'s weaknesses aren\'t a big factor in space combat.  Then use Vehicles
instead of the standard rules.  Now, for a truly overdesigned fighter, try
this
one ;).  Impervious to TL 12 lasers from the frontal arc, mostly impervious
to
TL 10 lasers from the sides, can out-accelerate TL 12 missiles, totally
impossible to get a lockon with active sensors, etc...
************
The only problems I see are the cost per (not really bad at 20MCr), and the
4 hour maintanace interval (12 turns in space combat), Passive sensors work
fine against it, but the not getting the +2 for active lock will hurt if
you are shooting at it.

All in all a very fine design. perfect for those black ops....
:)


TL 12 light fighter
Weapons: one 405 MJ pulse Xaser in a fully stabilized casement mount
    (1.08 GJ/shot), one slow autoloading 250mm missile launcher, rated for
    300 lb missiles, storage for 10 250mm missiles.

stats the same on these as the standard ones?




Instruments and Electronics: one extreme range scrambled radio, two very
    long range scrambled radios, two very long range lasercomms, 7000 mile
    AESA with air search option (scan 33/39, 1.75 MW), 4500 mile PESA
    (scan 32/38), 3*500 mile PESA (cover sides and back, scan 26/32), 2000
    mile radscanner (scan 30), two IFF, two inertial navigators, level 10
    deceptive jammer, hardened dedicated genius microframe (targeting +10),
    three hardened microframes (C8), two terminals.

Gotta love deceptive jammers....I am working up some ECM modules.



Crew: two roomy crewstations with G-seats, crashwebs, gravity webs, and
    full life support.  Occupancy: short.
*************8
how many Gs does this cancel out?  Consider Long occupancy, as space
battles can last several hours, and fatige from short may degrade
performance.


Power: 101 MW TL 11 fusion power plant, 54 GJ energy bank.  Power is
    _very_ gradually depleted if using active sensors and full thrust
    (requires 15+ hours), otherwise indefinate.  Can fire 50 shots on
    batteries; requires 9 minutes of dedicated fusion plant power to
    recharge fully.

I assume gravity webs cancel out the same as artificial gravity -- 6 Gs.  11 G
evades are uncomfortable, but doable.  Fatigue from short-term occupancy isn\'t
much of a problem with large crewstations for less than 12 hours or so, and
given that fighters tend not to have bunks in them, _all_ fighters are short
occupancy.

Depends how fast you fire, normal would probably not be above 1/60 so you can
fire for more than one turn.  If you limit yourself to 6 Gs you can fire at
1/30 indefinately.

It isn\'t (grumble Loren) but it\'s necessary to avoid having TL 11-12 combat
_completely_ broken (as in: not only can tanks not shoot through one another\'s
frontal armor -- they can\'t shoot through side armor either).

I\'ve got the original Beyond and Vanguard Reaches books from Paranoia
Press.  I don\'t think they can really be considered canon. (D\'oh!)  They
are particularly bad in the following respects:

1.  They have Aslan and Vargr worlds with non-Trokh and Gvegh names.  Easy
to fix.
2.  They have Ringworlds, Sphereworlds and Rosettes.  GDW/Marc\'s fault for
listing them as options...
3.  They have lots of sparsely described minor races - more than I would
usually allow, but not necessarily more than T5 would, according to the
material Marc has posted.
4.  They don\'t have a TL cap.  TLs above 15 are relatively common.
5.  GDW renamed one of their interstellar states that extended into Foreven
sector (Assignment Vigilante - an MT adventure).

Most of these are fixable.  The easiest way is to assume the Aslan overran
them in 1113-1120 or so, and recreate any world you don\'t like as an Aslan
one.

Alan Bradley
alanb@elf.brisnet.org.au
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

In addition the stars are all in different places and the alliances are all
wrong.  In Rats and Cats the maps of the, as well as the large map of the
domain of deneb all show some different political alliances.

I have created a map and fixed, or "canonized" almost all of the sector.  As
well as removing almost all of the high tech, weird, ringworld type items,
etc.

I have the Aslan invading parts of the sector, but not on par with the major
invasion as depicted in MT.  I have a hard time seeing how billions of
second sons can get across the J5 route with enough force to occupy almost 2
sectors, and challenge the Domain for military might.

Well, longbow II is apparently a phased-array sensor with an effective diameter
of tens of parsecs.  The implication that jump drives are accurate enough (in
terms of range) to allow doing interferometry between observations at the ends
of a jump is...disturbing (sufficiently so that longbow II, at least in the GT
writeup, will never show up in any campaign _I\'m_ running).  In any case, the
point is that you can see centimeter-sized objects in the galactic core (though
I don\'t htink it has a sufficient collection array for that to really be true
- -- that\'s just its resolution.)

     This was great!  Would you consider bringing the time line up to 1201

they would have dealt with the Rebellion, and the Virus.  Where exactly is
this sector located?  Do you have a map for it?  And the most important

However, while I used the basic info from the Paranoia Press, I have
converted the map to fit in the TDG map that was published in one of their

showed a large overview of that area.

Some of the races I have fit/converted into what I think is reasonable.

We probably need some restrictions on GURPS vehicle tech for importation

(a) the old superconductors-protect-against-laser shtick probably doesn\'t

Traveller, and (d) it\'s one of those if-it-works-everyone-should-have-it

I think I would outlaw different armour for different facings on 
principle; in practice, it\'s very hard for an evading ship to keep one face
always pointed at the enemy (although maybe G:T thrusters can operate
in arbitarary directions?)

>Space perfomance 11.01 Gs.
Is there a limit to G-compensation in G:Trav?

In general, the fact that you can get that much armour on a 10-ton fighter
probably means that G:T over-rates defence - imagine how much armour a 
battleship will have! Lasers and even spinal PAWs will be pretty much
completely ineffective (especially since weapons are armoured in G:T and
there doesn\'t seem to be much provision for surface sensor hits.)

I\'ve got the original Beyond and Vanguard Reaches books from Paranoia
Press.  I don\'t think they can really be considered canon. (D\'oh!)  They
are particularly bad in the following respects:

1.  They have Aslan and Vargr worlds with non-Trokh and Gvegh names.  Easy
to fix.
2.  They have Ringworlds, Sphereworlds and Rosettes.  GDW/Marc\'s fault for
listing them as options...
3.  They have lots of sparsely described minor races - more than I would
usually allow, but not necessarily more than T5 would, according to the
material Marc has posted.
4.  They don\'t have a TL cap.  TLs above 15 are relatively common.
5.  GDW renamed one of their interstellar states that extended into Foreven
sector (Assignment Vigilante - an MT adventure).

Most of these are fixable.  The easiest way is to assume the Aslan overran
them in 1113-1120 or so, and recreate any world you don\'t like as an Aslan
one.

Oh, very probably.  This was an experiment in munkinization, not a balanced

Thermal-superconducting surface has nothing to do with being superconducting --
the only reason I included it at all is that the GT book uses it on powered
battle dress.  If you cap the effect as mentioned, however, it\'s expensive
enough that it\'s usually easier to stack on more armor.

Yes -- it\'s only compensating 6 Gs.  However, a G-seat can mechanically handle
the other 5 Gs for at least limited periods.

Well, the way armor scaling works, immunity to bay and spinal weapons is very
difficult to get.  A 10,000 ton 6-G battle rider, using similar grossly
expensive armor, probably wouldn\'t have over DR 30,000.  Bay-mounted PAWs will
leak through on that, a spinal paw (averaging 210,000 damage) will pretty much
ignore it.

However, large warships, without even bothering with _anything_ which isn\'t in
GT in the ship design section, are likely to ignore lasers.  For practical
purposes, laser turrets are dedicated point defense weapons, with a secondary
purpose of blowing up hostile fighters.

Despite this, GT at high tech levels _does_ give the edge to defense.  TL 12
advanced metal, if we assume the same density as bonded superdense, has roughly
80x the toughness of a comparable thickness of steel.  Advanced laminate is
about 120x.  It takes around a 250 kT pocket nuclear weapon to kill a TL 12
heavy tank (500 kT if it isn\'t a contact explosion), and that kills it by
causing the structure to break apart, not by penetrating the armor.

Rats and Cats, OKA _Solomani and Aslan_, was a Digest Group Publications
race sourcebook, which, along with Cogs and Dogs, OKA _Vilani and Vargr_
are some of the most prized sourcebooks out there...I have seen them for
auction occasionally; the last time a copy was up that I bid on, I
dropped out of the bidding at $65...

I\'ve looked through all the used bookstores and game shops around here,
have the people there let me know if traveller stuff comes through, etc.

I\'m beginning to think there were something like 5 copies ever
published...

We probably need some restrictions on GURPS vehicle tech for importation
into Traveller to avoid such monstrosities. For example,

The ships construction system is compleatly compatible,  this ship costs 4x

I think I would outlaw different armour for different facings on

always pointed at the enemy (although maybe G:T thrusters can operate
in arbitarary directions?)

they certainly can.

Yes, 6 and then 2 m-3 more for the GSeat.  the pilot will feel 2-3 Gs...so
cannout uses all the accell all the time, but it works fin fore dodging
missiles.



In general, the fact that you can get that much armour on a 10-ton fighter
probably means that G:T over-rates defence - imagine how much armour a
battleship will have! Lasers and even spinal PAWs will be pretty much
completely ineffective (especially since weapons are armoured in G:T and
there doesn\'t seem to be much provision for surface sensor hits.)
**************
lasers yes, barbette PAWs as well, the heaviest ships (like the Tigress)
possibly even aginst Bay PAWs.  Armor still wont do much good against
Spinal Weapons.  High velocity missiles, while tricky to hit with, compare
well to bay weapons.

had quite an affect on the local military.  Damn Scum!  <grin>

My second favorite SF weapon, also rarely used in assassinations, is, 
of course, the Light Sabre.  I can see the Darrians using them, since 
they\'ve had a thing for grav art.  (Gravitic fields manipulate plasma 
into artistic expression.  One of the many true wonders lost with the 
Maghiz.  I think they\'ve come a long way toward re-acquiring the tech 
though.)  The same principle allows for the construction of a "plasma 
sabre", but the Darrian culture as a whole doesn\'t seem the type to 
promote their use.  Maybe it could be used by some fanaticaly 
religious group seeking transcendence through some Zen-like 
meditative state.  You know, that would make a great excuse to 
introduce a source for psionics training and development.  Hmmm...

On Longbow II:

Sure, the resolution is incredible, but it still doesn\'t violate the 
speed of light.  Must give the computers headaches to track the Core 
expeditions, et al, when they receive images of ships arriving in 
systems closer to the array years before the image of the ship 
leaving the star system farther away arrives at the array.  
Meanwhile, the furthest Core Expeditions penetrated almost 8000 
lightyears toward the galactic core, or something like that.  
Strephon\'s going to be looking at data for a long, long time....

Reminds me, what happened in deep space outside Glisten (I think) in 
1116?  The 1118 entry in GT reports an explosion in deep space 2ly 
out, so the actual event occurred in 1116.  (Takes two years for the 
image to travel through space to get to the sensors on Glisten.)  
Anyone have any thoughts?

Iceland is the geological equivalent of a scab.  *Something* punched the
crust there a few million years ago, and Iceland in the result.  A fairly
out of place island.

For years, it was thought that Iceland might mark the spot where the dino
killer had impacted, but that was discredited long before the Yucatan
crater was located.  Current best thought is that Iceland is the remains of
one of the last mega-volcanos on the sea floor.  The Island of Hawaii is
another good example.

I write:

Oops.  We seemed to have confused the issue here,  I will try and explain.

The Beyond ( and the Vangard Reaches) we two supplements printed in 1981 by
Paranoia Press, Inc.  That company is long out of the business of printing
traveller materials.  You may be able to find some of the books in old dusty
corners in game stores, but I would not hold my breath.  I have not seen any
on the market since the mid 80\'s.

Rats and Cats, aka Zhodani & Aslan, (I think, I don\'t have my book anywhere
near me) was published by Digest Group Publications, or DGP.  In that one,
or another, they had a large map that covered the Beyond.  Another very
difficult item to find.

In one of the other traveller supplements, I think it was the MT box, an
entire map of the Doman of Deneb was published that included the subsector
rimward of the Spinward Marches,  The Trojan Reaches.  This had some
additional information as it is right next to The Beyond.

Some of these you may still find on the net,

X-TEK Press Release 320-1119

X-TEK of Deneb announces the production of it\'s new fighter, named the
Hornet-III Space Superiority fighter.

Built at the X-TEK "Fnordwerks" facility on Vincennes, the Hornet-III
utilizes cutting edge technologies to produce the most advanced fighter in
the Imperium.

The Hornet-III utilizes "Megathruster" technology, allowing the fighter to
accelerate faster than anything yet in the Imperial arsenal with a
staggering 7.25 gravities!  This amount of force is compensated by the
advanced TL-13 gravcomps in the cockpit.  Also, the fighter is protected
by a heavy armour shell, capable of deflecting most standard laser
systems.  If it wasn\'t for this armour, it is theorized the thrusters
would propel the fighter far to quickly, perhaps even into the 20 gravity
range!

The other innovation are the development of TL-13 x-ray lasers.  These
lasers are 20% more powerful that the standard TL-12 laser used my most
military vessels.

The Hornet-III therefore promises to be the "Next Generation" Fighter for
the IN.  The IN is still considering the proposal.

Currently the Vincenni Home Guard has bought a single wing of 5 Hornet-III
fighters for use in patrol duty.

Statistics:
10ton SL Hull, 6000DR, Cockpit, 4 Megathrusters, 
3x TL-13 420Mj Lasers (6d x100(2), 1/2d=3hex, Max=9hex each)

You don\'t need jump drives accurate enough for such interferometry any more
than the trucks that drove VLBA elements into place needed to be accurate to
centimeters. All you need to do is *measure* the distance between elements 
to an accuracy comparable to the wavelength of light involved; for Longbow II,
this could be done by reference measurements wrt to multiple quasars and/or
by bootstraping laser measurements between stars (ie at some point during the
Third Survey, a scout in every system fires a sequence of coded laser pulses
to scouts in every other system within six parsecs; later on scouts are
positioned to recieve these, thus measuring the distances between each star
to a few nanometers.) 

Alternatively, if you don\'t have that accurate a measurement, you can 
self-calibrate by observing a bright point source and basically adjusting
your estimate of the distance between elements until the restored image
is a point source. (This is how the VLA and VLBA/VLBI normally operate.) 

The trick for Longbow II, of course, is finding a point source.

My suspicion is that the collecting array is sufficiently sparse that it
could only see objects with temperatures in the billions of kelvin. (Or lasers
pointed at the array.) Maybe if the array was only a few parsecs across and
the elements were a million km across (really only practical for long-wave
radio where you can use a loose mesh) it might work.

It is perfectly plausible. It simply requires that the missile have

 a] more G\'s than the target
 b] good sensors
 c] sufficient endurance
 d] plenty of agility. (ability to change facing rapidly)

Only if the target isn\'t going some 10-20 km/s as well.

Realistc contact missiles aren\'t going to impact too terribly fast.... the
terminal guiodance phase requires them to maneuver in. Contact space
munitions are likely to close, grapple, and THEN detonate. (Think what a
grappled 10KT nuke will DO!)

Pure impact designs need to have sufficient agility and thrust to hit on a
closing course.... a one pass kind of deal...

Hell there is an RPG where kinetic kill missiles are the weapons of the
line of battle (Albedo, set in the world of _Erma Felna, EDF_).

 Don\'t think youre missing anything, this is in fact the same solution I
came up with. I used the same .2 cubic meter missile casing which GT
states, filling it with a 30kg warhead consisting of 600 50g superdense
penetrators, a thermal targeting terminal guidance, and a maser commo
reciever. The rest was EAPlaC fuel.

 I ended up with a weapon which has 8 G-turns for getting into target hex,
with 2 G-turns retained for terminal guidance (considering the terminal
guidance phase only takes 3-4 min, that\'s _a lot_ of G), and additional
7kg of EAPlaC fuel used to propel the cluster warhead. Of course this was
done with FF&S1, but I think one could come up with something similar with
GURPS Vehicles. (perhaps with reactionless drives for cruising, and SRF
for terminal guidance)  
 Some rough math showed that each 50g projectile alone, when travelling
10-20 km/s, would be enough to severely damage a ship. I also figured that
with 600 projectiles dispersing in about 30 degree space angle, the
missile would only have to get within about 10km of the target. That is a
target profile I find much easier to svallow.

Yeah but why all the imperial secrecary.  GT mentioned that
the longbow II was never mentioned by name and only in even
included in the most secret reports.  I had thought that it
was used to gather scientific data on the galactic core. 
did they see something that they don\'t want people to know
about, or are they just using it to spy on there own
citizens.

 The kinetic energy of the missile at a "low" velocity of 2 hexes/turn
would be:
 300lb x .454 = 136.2kg  E(kin)= .5 x 136.2kg x 26800m/s^2= 4.89 x 10^10

 Which would leave plenty of time for even the most rudimentary point
defese system to shoot the missile to scrap. The "good sensors" needed to
acieve a contact hit (and i\'m not saying such don\'t exist in Traveller)
would cost far too much to put into every one of the dozens of missiles
you\'d need to get even one hit.

I recommend _against_ using gaming system damage stats here -- a more accurate
measure here is \'kilograms of TNT\', by which measure this is 12 tons TNT
equivalent.  Realistically, if we assume traveller ships are as tough as modern
surface ship of comparable size, this won\'t actually destroy ships much larger
than your average scout ship, though it will do serious damage to larger ships.

Note that the missile damage rules in GURPS Traveller quietly divide collision
damage by 5, presumably indicating that they\'re actually shrapnel warheads of
some sort.

Actually, they _settle_ for asking us to call ourselves

a lot less printable than "gringos".

Something like that.  /Saint-Pierre et Miquelon/ is a French
/Departement/, i.e., legally and administratively an integral
part of /la Republique Franaise/.  As opposed to, say, French
Polynesia, which is a French _Overseas_ /Departement/, legally
and administratively separate from /la Republique/, but whose
citizens may carry French passports.

That\'s "Kaliaat Nunaat" to you!  A small number of years ago,
Denmark granted them home rule, and officially accepted a

Beg to differ - Except, I believe, for a small sliver on the
southern east coast of the island, it _is_ part of North America,
i.e., it is on the North American tectonic plate.  It is actually
more a part of North America than San Francisco or Los Angeles
are.

Er, uh, um, well... it\'s like this: I was pressed into service to produce
the plans within a short time frame, and while I know a lot about doing CT
deckplans, I\'ve never done GURPS ships, nor do I own any GURPS materials. I
asked for a breakdown of the ships\' componants, with displacement tonnage.
So a copy of the G:T ship design sequence was e-mailed to me, along with
the specs for four ships, and I was told to design them as if they were CT
ships, on a 1.5m grid, then just replace the grid with the 1-yard GURPS
hexgrid.

As you point out, the G:T design sequence doesn\'t show the power plant,
which is included in each module. So the ship breakdowns I received didn\'t
allocate any tonnage for a power plant. I scratched my head, looked at the
design sequence, and concluded (incorrectly) that each module came with an
independent power plant. Doh!

So there\'s no power plant on the four ships I designed for the G:T Alien
Races book - the Shivva Patrol Frigate, the Solomani Courier, the Vargr
Corsair, and the Drakaran Family Trader. But you can just assume that the
power plant is part of the maneuver drives, or part of the jump drive, or
perhaps mounted above or below these componants.

Mind you, at least my plans include a detailed key, and every componant and
space is clearly labeled. No nameless blank spaces on *my* ships!

Well, it means that a smuggler will have some chance during his smuggling
career* of having to rely on
whatever approach he uses incase paperwork is checked (thre
was a legit cargo that left when the paper work claims but it
was just dumped and replaced, the smuggler skips out on his identity at
a convenient time later, etc.).  Wether this increases the
odds of his being caught enough that the Imperium would find
it worthwhile bothering with depends on a lot on your take on
the factors and how you see the Imperium.

*(I am assuming a merchant who smuggles now and then.  A full time smuggler
probably has a way of avoid all paperwork, or reliably faking it, in a
chosen world that he just keeps exploiting.  However a smuggler who has a
reliable way of handling occaisonaly checks, such as mentioned below, might
not have to be that restrictive)

>By the way, David, what do you think the Imperium would do to try and catch
>pirates and smugglers ?

I\'m not sure that the Imperium does try and catch smugglers.  It is
a local matter an may well vary from world to world.  I high law
world might have patrols all over the place, search ever cargo
coming out of the starport, etc.  OTOH, another world might wait
until an illegal item shows up and work their way back catching
as many people as they can.

As for pirates, I think they would go with random patrols and
tracking down incidents of piracy.

Well, the point was that if you are going to invision this
kind of record keeping, you need to decide who is going
to do it, since there is no cannonical agency, that I
know of, that has been desribed as doing such things.

>Basically, the check will cost fractions of a percent of the cost of the

For smuggling, if you are anticipating the seizure of the
cargo, you have to look at the cost of the records times
the fraction of all cargos that are being smuggled, times
the odds that the exercise will catch the smugglers, times
the odds that the cargo will still be around to be siezed
when the record catch back up.

Sending record back and forth is not the only way to check
record, nor is trying to get by with illegal records the
only legal issue a merchant will have to deal with.  It
can range from taxes, to quartine issues, to contract
issues, etc.  The fact that Merchant Prince has legal skill
doesn\'t say anything about customs and the roll to pass legal
checks doesn\'t say whether they are simply checking to make
sure the paper work is proper (the fact that the roll is
applied immediately could be used to argue against the
idea that it is to avoid verification from the source world).

Most mail will, in fact, go on the self same commercial ships.
Other than the X-boat route (which only works along the
X-boat backbone and which is only jump-4 anyway) there
aren\'t any special high speed ships visiting every world.
None of the ships listed as being fitted for mail are
especially fast and mail has to sit around on each world
waiting for the next ships to the destination it needs to
get to.

> Most

"Most".  Most commercial shipping also doesn\'t engage in smuggling.
It can be ships that are don\'t stick to one area (these won\'t
be _that_ rare, esp. tramp steamers), ships that think
they have tapped out the area and are about to move on, ships
that are temporarily away from their local area, etc.

I don\'t think these would be that rare at all.  Any ships that
has to operate on cargoes of opportunity will have to go where
the cargo takes him, and then go where the cargoes on the next
world are going.  To not take a cargo because it goes
out of your area and sit around loosing money doesn\'t make
much sense to me.

If you let the enemy know you know something, they can figure out _how_
you know it, and take appropriate steps.  Had the Japanese caught on
that US signal intelligence was reading much of their encrypted radio
traffic during World War II ("MAGIC", the counterpart to the British
"ULTRA"), they probably would have changed encryption systems, used
signal deception plans, and taken other steps to cut down on our ability
to profit from our SIGINT capabilities.

LONGBOW II is _way_ beyond MAGIC or ULTRA.

That makes a lotta sense.  I use the INT + EDU limit in my game, but so far, haven\'t instituted any experience yet cause the game\'s still fairly new.

You are assuming that Canada\'s annexation of the US would
essentially result in the conversion of the US to a parlimentary
system.  The question is whether the "former USA" wouldn\'t
just use their 90% of the vote to switch back to a "winner
take all" presidental system.

Actually, having grown up across the Niagra river from Canada, I\'m not
sure that saying it is more liberal isn\'t too simplistic.  For
example, I do see thing that would be considered less "progressive"
than in the USA (I was on vacation in Nova Scotia and if they
required unit pricing (like in the states that I\'ve lived in)
I didn\'t see it and I saw something on TV that seem too policialy incorrect
to appear on US TV (unfortunately I\'ve forgotten what it was).

Well, you do get one way to reduce engineering crew:  the Computer
Multiplier (CM) improves as TL increases, thus allowing fewer
crewmembers to handle the work load.  Admittedly, you\'d have to
extrapolate CM for computers above TL15, but that\'s not a hideous
glitch.  (Besides, if you did that, you could post your proposed
extrapolation on TML, and bask in the admiration of your colleagues.)

About your other points, I agree to some extent (mondo-tech does seem to
be an afterthought).  However, the campaign in which I play is set in
the Spinward Marches just prior to 5FW, so I don\'t run into as much
truly high-tech stuff as I might.  (My jump infantry regiment is
equipped at TL12-TL13, to ensure that the local industrial/technical
base can support us.)

That\'s GURPS TL12, *NOT* GDW TL12.  Considerable difference.  GURPS TL12 is 
higher than GDW TL15.

Um, \'Rats&Cats\' is the nickname for \'Solomani And Aslan\' by Digest Group Publications, an MT supplement.

Another one, \'Vilani and Vargr\' is sometimes called \'Wogs & Dogs\'.

The only jump-6 courier I\'ve seen mentioned is the secret one
owned by Imperailines.  (The legit version is not jump-6).
The X-boat is jump 4 and the ships listed as being eligable
for a mail subsidy are not jump-6 either (I don\'t remember what
they are, I can look tonight).  Furthermore, at each world
the message has to then wait on the availablity of ships
going to appropriate destinations.

After all, the canonical
speed for official distribution of news of the Emperor\'s death
(you can\'t get much more important) was jump-4 (by the X-boats
network I think) which is why the
secret jump-6 couriers were able to get ahead of it.

If you are trying to catch
a ship who\'s destination is unknown, you have to send out
a general bulliten and this is going to require relying
on normal distribution channels.    Otherwise, you have to
have enough jump-6 couriers sitting around so that they
are immediately available everytime a ship becomes suspect
(including, as another poster pointed out, thing like
clerical errors).  They have to be available in such numbers
as to be able to visit ever world that the subject
ship might have reached in the time span that it took
the record check to return from the source world (weeks
to months) and that the subject ship might have visited
while things are catching up to them.

Also, I never specified a free trader.  If you want to invoke
that smugglers never travel faster than jump-2 you have to show
that they will never have higher jump ships.

He ain\'t invited in my entire *STATE* during hunting season.  It\'s bad enough that the locals have to wear these ridiculous orange vests and signs saying \'I AM NOT A DEER, DAMMIT!!!\' in their *offices* during hunting season.

I think, and this is the point, that much of the discussions
stems from just this issue.  Is the Imperium subject to the
kind of regulation and record keep/checking that we are used
to in our modern western society?  Or does the absence of
fast communications and the presence of a delocalized
governement structure take its toll and lead to a less
regulated/documented society?

My view is the latter.

*YOU\'RE* assuming that 90% of the registered voters would show up at the polls 
and vote the switch in.  I don\'t see this happening.  <grin>

The interesting point, is that you desribing inspection of
the records that came with the ship against the contents of the
cargo.  This brings up the question, since the world has
communications that the Imperium can only dream of, do they
check documents against what is recorded in at the source
port?  If not, then you have to wonder why you would expect an
Imperium that has much slower communications to do so.

The problem is that the same advances in technology will give
you techniques to get around these measures.  The history of
crime is one of much confidence in new technologies that will
eliminate new types of crime only to have them circumvented by
some new technology or approach by the criminals.

The point was not that information would never catch up.  It was
that by the time it did, the trail would old and cold and the
subjects would have had plenty of time to take measures.

Damn cheap. Remember that even the poorest households on TL12 Sylea have
spray-on vidwalls. In bulk, the basic units would be an extremely minor
part of the cost of a cargo container.

I like the idea of large companies _always_ using containers, while tramp
traders use what they can., including older, lower-tech, easier-to-fool
cargo containers. Searching them takes longer, and isn\'t popular with
customs officers, but it gives players a chance to use those interpersonal
skills to get the job done faster (and maybe less efficiently).

Ie. it was an editorial mistake. Someone should have caught this after you
submitted the plans and clarified it for you.

Part of the drives is probably easiest.

This illustrates a major problem with the GT design system, though: not
knowing how much of any component is the power plant.

Hm. Any chance of getting these ships with a 1.5m grid? Or maybe a 1m grid

I recently ran a game where the PCs went \'spec on a cargo - sight unseen.
(Although samples of the widgets were provided, and contractual guantees
were made.)  When they got to the warehouse (a 4 day N-space trip to another
planet), they found that the warehouse did indeed contain the cargo - 50+
dTons in 1 cubic meter cardboard boxes.

Many, many of them.

This was followed by figuring out how to load \'em (paid the locals), how to
store \'em effeciently in the cargo hold without destroying the boxes under
their own weight (turned the floor fields *way* down), and how to keep a
straight face when they were boarded by a IN \'health and welfare\'
inspection - especially since (IMTU) such an inspection requires a manifest
check (passenger, crew and cargo) and a physical inspection of 10% of the
cargo containers being carried.

Hmmm. Kinetic energy missiles aren\'t feasible because point defense
will always get \'em... how many thousand years before people stop
*installing* point defense... Boy, the first guy with a few of these
will wipe out somebody\'s fleet :-)

Besides, what about ships that have no point defense, or ones that
have had it shot away?

As for another post about low closing velocities being typical for
missiles----I\'ve found that you\'ll usually get about twice the
missile\'s delta v as a closing velocity. Many combats I\'ve fought
with various systems have been head-on affairs, not running fights
(and the guy following gets KE missiles poured onto him with a large
CV).

So a target is going ~100km/sec in the +X direction, and the missile
is coming in at maybe 1-200km/s in the -X direction. Even at an
angle out of the X axis the CV will be over 100km/s, probably more
like 200km/s. A 1 ton missile that isn\'t hosed down kills anything
it hits (for arguements sake--I\'d expect a fragmentation missile to
spread many, many tiny submunitions).

BTW, I saw 10-20km/s quoted in another post. That\'s around 1/2 an
hour\'s delta v at 1g. Missiles are at least 6g critters, and most
military ships are 4-6gs as well.

Actually, I kinda feel sorry for Ken Starr.  No matter what he did, his career 
was *OVER* the instant he accepted the job.

I always called it \'Wogs & Dogs\'.  As in, \'wogs\' being people living in 
colonial territories under the British Empire, and considering the \'Rats\' took

True. And speaking as a bureacrat, I\'d get worried if I saw a manifest
reference to a high-tech cargo coming from such a backwater.

I\'d get real worried if the starport cargo uploads indicates a series of
these cargos.

Firstly, piracy *is* an intelligence issue. If you are, say, a Sword Worlds
intelligence bureau, then a viable piracy infrastructure makes a wonderful
tool for infiltrating agents, gaining intelligence, tying down ships behind
the front line in war and so on.

Secondly, if pirates arent armed spaceborne enemies of the Imperium, I\'m
not sure who is. And fences and smugglers are the essential support
structure that let pirates exist. Cut off their ability to turn stolen
cargo into cash for repairs, and you cut off their ability to exist.

Random sampling is stupidly inefficient. The primary thing you are looking
for is cargos and ship bits stolen by pirates.

Have a look at how long most commericial fraud or smuggling cases take to

If it\'s illegal, it isnt regulation, it\'s law enforcement.

Ewwwwww .... the exie-wexies think seven point twooooo fiiiive geees is

An weee weeee weee reckon that a cockpit-wockpit computer-wuter is tooo
smalllll ... weeeeee think you should buy a big big bigggie big
bridgie-widgie, to allow a biiigggger computer-wuter.

Weeeee reckon that this is the beeeest investment of twennny tons mass you
can maaaaake, coz it lets you use much better program-wograms, allowing
hiiiiiiii accuracy use of the gunsie-wunsies. An an an muuuch better
sensor-wensors.

An we we we reckon that for military-wilitary use you should always have a
nukie-wukie damper-wamper coz coz coz one nuke can ruin your

Unfortunatly, the Spinward Marches is also highly militarized, and the site
of most of the Imperium\'s wars over the last 300 years.

Personally, I think by the 1100s it would be a lot more like Checkpoint
Charlie than Kansas City in the days of the gunfighter.

I really think that we should do a \'Spinward Marches in the 500s\'
sourcebook, for the people who really really want a minimum bureacracy,
minimal regulation, maximum piracy, maximum bring-your-own-guns campaign.

Okay, now I\'m confused.  How many continents are there?  Is P.E.I. not
part of N. Amer., now?  Let\'s see, Cuba is part of the Antartic
continent, but Key West is in the Dutch West Indies?  My head hurts. 
I\'ve heard of continental drift, but I didn\'t think that I\'d been out
of school THAT long!  Or is this part of the Redistricting thing that
Congress keeps talking about?  Will the 2000 census straighten all of
this out for us?  Someone pass the asprin, please.

If I did, then it wouldn\'t be a secret.

Next: packages of Camel coffin nails allegedly have a nekkid woman engraved in
the pattern of the camel\'s fur. If you look at the engraving long enough, and
squint, you can sort of see a female form (it is a stretch to say its a nude
woman) -- in the same sense you can see rutabagas in clouds and faces in the
craters of the moon (JPL has a photo of a lava flow that looks like Kermit the
Frog -- anybody ever see that one?).

Turns out, when you look at the photograph of the camel (one of the
attractions at Ringling Bros and Barnum & Bailey around the turn of the last
century), you can see the same pattern -- whatever it is -- in the camel\'s
fur. The engraving merely copies what was already there.

Sylea had government type 9 Impersonal Bureaucracy. As Capital, it still
does.  The Imperium as a whole  is an Impersonal Bureaucracy if I\'ve ever
seen one.  The Imperial services and ministries are under very little
control from the citizens they "serve", even if you take "citizen" to read
"noble".  (Alternatively, you could regard it as a Charismatic Oligarchy,
or Feudal Technocracy, of course.)

There are limits to the ability of the Imperium to govern, of course. 
There are hints in M:0 that it could even be regarded as a cobbled together
collection of pocket empires ("subsector governments") in its early
centuries.

Even so, yes, I do think that not only does the Imperium has millions, if
not billions, of bureaucrats, these bureaucrats have expert systems to help
them read the regulations!  In extreme cases, we could even consider the
Imperial regulations to be something resembling law books, with precedent
(and analogies?)
being used in the massive number of exceptional cases.

Remember, the Imperium began as an alliance of the thoroughly
bureaucratised Sylean Federation with the Vilani.

How does it pay for these millions of bureaucrats?  The same way it pays
for the millions of navy personnel.  A million salaries is nothing to the
kind of bucks hanging around on a Hi-Pop world.  Let\'s do some numbers:

Assume each bureaucrat costs an average of 100000 credits.  This is roughly
based on starship crew figures from various editions.  Double it, if you
like:  so each bureaucrat costs 200000 credits.

1 million bureaucrats at 200000 credits costs .2 Trillion Credits.  Big
bucks, indeed.  An Imperial naval squadron is sometimes rule-of-thumbed as
costing 1 Trillion Credits (see Trillion Credit Squadron or Imperial
Squadrons)....

Now look, son, you newbies from the Core may think that we\'re a bunch of
hillbillies out here, but I\'ll tell you - don\'t mess with the Ministry of
Justice!  And our fleets and armies don\'t mess around either.  They ain\'t

In basic CT (Book 2 & 3), it was possible to run ships on TL 6 or 7
computers!  There used to be jokes about tearing out 1 ton Model 1 machines
and replacing them with Apple IIs.  Presumably these would run BASIC.  

We used to argue that actually that was what was happening, and that the
tonnage included room for a desk, a chair, and shelves for the manuals and
floppy disks!  At higher TLs you got improved coffee making facilities for
the programmer!

While this particular bug has been fixed long ago, under FF&S1, it was
possible to refit/rebuild ships with TL 8 machines.  The main limitation
was that the sensors would be totally blind in combat.  This raises the
question: wouldn\'t even a TL 9 or TL 10 machine be the equivalent of a TL
15 laptop?

Handwave:  the exponential rates of growth in machine power we currently
have are related to the chip technology we are presently using, and will
slow drastically once it hits its physical limit.

One, the quick kill rule is explained *before* the ***recommendation*** of not
applying it to PCs.  It\'s also explicitly mentioned that referees might
disregard the ***recommendation*** of quick kill not applying to players.  I
use the T2k quick kill myself, but the even core system is not broken, but

Well apparently you let the rules laywers alter your reff\'ing.  IMO, you
shouldn\'t ever let such a thing happen, but it\'s your game.  You want to be
bullied by your players (or anyone else), that\'s your business.   

(Gasp!  "canon lawyers?"  I\'m glad none of my players are Traveller grognards.
That\'s another good thing about the New Era...  even if any of my players were
on the tml, any canon they could bring up would be answered w/ "that was pre-
Collapse bub, generations ago.")

No!  You said it was broken.  I was interested in just what you *thought* was
broken.  Next time prefix it w/ IMNSHO.  Then suffix it w/ "For my group."  It
is *not* broken.  It\'s broken for you and your rules lawyer player(s) (who
must\'ve not read the 2nd to last paragraph of pg 285 (mk 1 mod 1).  

Personally, i just don\'t think you\'re up to a Good rules system. ; )

lol.  Too bad u\'re so far from my campaign.  You\'d find out how quickly how
easy it is to die.  Personally i think your game was poorly controled by the

  That sounds like a most excellent system - a brief paragraph explaining
it (like that above) might be helpful [I just spent the evening listening
to newbie AD&D2 munchkins who simply don\'t know any better - roleplaying
nowadays apparently means storytelling which _really_ means over-the-top
power gaming; I must\'ve missed that part].

new players will be able to adapt.

  I think you\'ve reversed it - a newly absorbed set of ex-US territories

would probably elect current Canadian parties (at least in name) to Congress;
it\'s my understanding that individual critters are elected based solely on

  FWIW, the vast majority of any compliance or enforcement personnel that

  Actually, allowing the players extra fees for handling these loads
(or providing the containers and loading them) also provides both
extra revenue (reasonable or not) and a role for the typical PC who
doesn\'t fit the Pilot/Nav/`geer/Doc skill-set (at least in the games
