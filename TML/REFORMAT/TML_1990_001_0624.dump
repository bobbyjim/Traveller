I\'d like to apologize again for the problems last night.  It was
programmer error.  Everything will be back to normal tonight.

I realize that not only were the barrage of tiny digests annoying, but
that the multiple copies of the same thing was confusing.  I also
realize that some of you pay to download these messages, and cannot read
them until they finally get into your computer.  I also realize that
some of you are forced into reading all this mail whether you want to or
not -- at 1200 baud.

If it\'s any consolation, I am receiving piles of mail bounces off of
inactive accounts, so I am not getting a moment\'s peace.  Guess I\'m
getting appropriate punishment.  I\'m also answering individual inquiries
of the form "wha\' happen\'?".

In the mean time, I will offer to resend any digests to anyone of you
who asks.

We now return you to your normal nightly and biweekly 50K-byte digest
digesting (unless I screw it up adding the code to sort starship designs
to the end of the digest).

TMLers:

Well, after much testing (I figured out how to test the digester
successfully, which should help avoid things like last night), the TML
digests are now sorted as I talked about in previous messages.  The
recipe is this:

	beginning of digest: messages smaller than 6K bytes
	middle of digest:    messages larger than 6K bytes
	end of digest:       vehicle designs, regardless of message size

Notice that long (non-vehicle design) messages are kept in the middle of
the digest -- this keeps all the snappy dialogue at the front.

A vehicle design is any message which contains 10 or more of the
following strings, ignoring case, with * a wildcard that matches any
number of arbitrary characters (in other words, this very message should
qualify as a vehicle design, as would one that listed craftid 10 times):

craftid:  Disp*=    power:    Loco*:    Sensor*:  Def*:     Crew=     
hull:     Config*=  Dur*=     Comm*:    Off*:     Control:  Accom*:   

TMLers, Let me know if this is a boon or a bust to you.

subscribing to a few now defunct mailing lists and reading internet news
I can safely say that the idea of TDR is approaching that of oblivion.  

What!

I commit heresy?

Actually, let me just list in order of events what I have seen most of
these *ideas* go , and then my response on what we should do:

1)  There is a mailing list or group that has a common theme of gaming.

2)  After a certain amount of time of some realing good posts someone posts
the idea that we should all write a game.

3)  For about 3 days (I\'m very serious about that number, not 2 or 4, but
3), people start posting ideas of what can be improved.

4)  On the fourth day someone suggests a name for the project.


******So far, so good.  ********

5)  Then the inevable group of posts start:

    a)   Copyright infringement laws.  This stream discourages people some.
    b)   Making money off of our work.  This stream discourages other
people even more.
    c)   Who is going to be in charge, and who does what.  This stream
really discourages people, because the very least they want is a deadline.
Remember, for most of us this is a hobby, albeit, an extremely entertaining
one (some believe ranks right up there with sex and food gluttonly).
    d)   "We should write computer programs that do all this."  Discourages
people who don\'t want to write computer programs, and don\'t care to drag a
computer to their session.
    e)   The formatting of the text.  Discourages people some , because we
are already receiving this mailing list, why does it have to be something
special again?  I mean, I am happy with getting this mailing list.  In the
same thread, I expect in 2 days, someone will say that a seperate offshoot
mailing list should be formed.  Irritates people, because now they have to
worry about more digests.
    

********DANGER*******

At this point, someone posts a letter, pleading with everybody else to get
on track.

{[

As one aside, I made a comment last Saturday during my groups Traveller
session (which started late, Sat at 1300, when it was suppose to start Fri
at 1800):   "All we seem to be able to decide in is our group indecision
and to put off making a decision for 2 hours."

This amused everybody then , and I think applies to the situation at this
point.  (By the way, our problem was what shall we do for lunch and
dinner?).

]}

AND, at this point , that poster is generally ignored.

6)  About 25% of the original people who liked the idea start on something.
50% continue arguing about the points in number 5.
25% go on to something else.

This all  happens about 1 week after the above problems start.

7)  After a while, everybody goes on to something else, except for the one
guy who originally posted the idea.


8)  AND, after a while, we are left with lots of posts concerning a
nonexistant game we were going to work on, and a lot of people wondering
what ever became of the project.



**********NOVEL  IDEA************

The original idea was proposed that we examine the MegaTraveller system,
and post our revisions of what each section should be.  Improve the system.

(At this point everybody is nodding their head and wondering why I am
wasting bandwith).

We are starting on number 5, folks, and pretty soon we will be at step
number 8.


Why don\'t we just post our revisions.  Now, we have some guidance and a
goal.  It is the same as before, except for a general theme.

The problem with number 5 issues, is that we are not a company.  This is
not our means of making a living.   At number 5, we are already discussing
something that should be discussed AFTER we have come up with some really
nifty ideas.

1)If you want to put it in Tex, LaTeX, Word, *ruff, *roff, or even SWAHILLI,
do it then.  It will come to you off this mailing list, and you can format
it for your own desire and tastes.  

Me:  I will take it into ASCII, dump it to a NexT machine, and then use the
Laser WRiter to print off a nifty looking copy.  And I will dump a copy to
the MAC for future use.

2)Computer programs.  Those who want them, go ahead and write them.  Noone
is stopping you.  Just don\'t tell me that I have to write a computer
program.

3)Copyright and making money.  Let me just say one thing....
So far on this list we have discussed the game, and played with changes.
We have not done anything illegal.  These posts are for our use, and whoever
we want to distribute them to for free.  Hell, if you charge money for a
letter I wrote I probably won\'t care.
  But, if any of us find out that someone has published our material
without asking us, then they will never , ever, get anything published
again.  All a publisher needs is a plagarist, to cause them headaches.
And, those of us who see our stuff in print, will cause those headaches:
end of matter.

4)Who is in charge, and who does what.  As for who is in charge, I don\'t
care.  We are just a group having fun.  Maybe there should be people who
keep us on track and remind us of things that need to be done.  These
people will appoint themselves.   

As for who does what, who cares .  If we see it needs to be done, and if it
needs to be done badly enough, it will get done .  (Whoa! Awful sentence!)
As for me, I said I would do some stuff with Trade and Commerce, because I
want it for my campaign.

If the material that someone writes is not very good, we will discuss it and 
try to improve it or rework it (or ignore it and drop it).  AS WE HAVE DONE
MANY TIMES IN THE PAST.

Folks, IF YOU WANT TO DISCUSS THE ISSUES OF NUMBER 5 IN THE FUTURE, PLEASE
JUST POST AS YOUR SUBJECT   "NUMBER 5:" AND THEN I WILL KNOW TO SKIP IT,
FOR IT WILL BE A WASTE OF TIME.

When we have a bunch of stuff collected together, maybe then we should
worry about what  do with it beyond our group.  

Thank you for your time in reading this, I will now proceed back to discussing
the game and any improvements or whatever....

There have been some link problems getting it to a UNIX system to post

commonly asked questions:

>What printers does it support?
	The whole thing is designed to be run on anything. Consequently
all of its output is dumb terminal ascii. There are one or two programs
that use Epson FX-80 escape sequences and are clearly marked. Two programs
only run under TurboC and use graphics. Other than that nothing fancy.
I would very much like to see other front ends written and will gladly help
interested people.

>I use a [insert wide variety of hardware]
	Perhaps I should have asked what operating system and compiler
people use. It has been throughly tested under MS-DOS with Lattice and
TurboC compilers. It will be tested on a SUN running SUNOS (BSD 4.3).

	This file contains a brief description of each of the programs.
See _progname_.OUT for a sample output. All the times mentioned in the
outputs were done on a 20MHz 386.
	To compile copy one of the make files to makefile and type "make
all". You will probably have to modify it a little. There is only one 
compile time constant that is in magic.h. Define bit16 if your compiler
compiles ints to sixteen bits and comment it off otherwise.

so I can update the information. In particular I would like proper UNIX

				Jo Jaquinta

				November 1990

SYSGEN1 xx yy zz
	This is the level one system generation program. It produces basic
mainworld information.

SYSGEN2 xx yy zz
	This is the level two system generation program. It produces extended
system information.

SYSGEN3 xx yy zz
	This is the level three system generation program. It produces 
information comparable with world builder\'s handbook.

SYSGEN4 xx yy zz PlanetName
	This is the level four system generation program. It produces 
surface maps for a planet. It prints a high level map on the screen then
asks which triangle to expand. The triangles are numbered as in (A)
	 /\\  /\\  /\\  /\\  /\\             	 /\\
	/ 1\\/ 2\\/ 3\\/ 4\\/ 5\\    	        /1 \\
	\\ 6/\\ 7/\\ 8/\\ 9/\\10/\\ 	               /____\\
(A)	 \\/11\\/12\\/13\\/14\\/15\\   	(B)   /\\ 0  /\\
	  \\16/\\17/\\18/\\19/\\20/  	     /2 \\  /3 \\
	   \\/  \\/  \\/  \\/  \\/  		    /____\\/____\\
	Next is will ask for a specifier. Each of the 20 big triangles is
expanded as per (B). If no specifier is given you get the whole large
trianlge. If a specifier of 1, say, is given you get the top little triangle.
This is recursive. Thus a specifier of 131 gives the top triangle of the lower
right triangle of the top triangle of the world triangle. Get it? Well,
play around with it and see.
	Lastly it asks for size. This is basically the number of times to expand
while printing. This size 1 is as is, size 2 is two on a side, size 3 is 4 on
a side, ....
	You can expand down to 16 triangles per side. The program doesn\'t
limit you but you will see it starting to get really ugly. Again, 
experimentation is the best approach.

TTIMES xx yy zz
	This program computes the travel times between planets of the
star at the given system. It only computes them for the top layer though.

DETPRINT xx yy zz PlanetName
	This prints out level 3 details on a planet in English. Included are
physical stats, principal cities, local customs, local religion, law levels,
tech levels and hex row seasonal temperatures.

ORIGIN xx yy zz NumberPeople
	This is for finding origins of NPCs. You give it a system and the
number of origin planets to find. It first calculates the total population
from the vacininy then randomly selects planets based on population. It uses
the level 2 figures for the entire system to determine population.

SCANNER xx yy zz
	This is a simple interactive region examining program. It uses the
ANSI clear screen command. While in it the keys X, x, Y, y, Z, z shift along
the given axis. a, A, or + transpose amongst the three axis. The screen 
maintains the level 1 info on the center system. 2 and 3 print the level 2
and level 3 information. Q quits the program.
	Really primitive.

TIMTBL xx yy zz time
	This prints a timetable for departing ships for a given system. The
time is measured in days and is an arbitrary number. The data is in the 
following format:
The Franhe (Arnelia) out of Sosen (9985 9981 10012)
	Departing 10 for Mouthit (9999 9998 10004)
	26 High berths 2 booked, 3 standby
	7 Low berths 2 booked

The _name_of_ship_ (_owning_corporation_) out of _origin_ (_coords_)
	Departing _day_ for _dest_ (_coords_)
	_total_ High berths _n_ booked [i.e. high passage], _n_ standby [i.e. 
middle passage]
	_n_ Low berths _n_ booked
The closer a ships gets to its departure date the fuller it will be. I used
it for a simple PBM game over the net that withered away.

SCAN xx yy zz
	This is really just a shell to search outward for whatever you want.
At the moment it prints where it is when a key is pressed and otherwise
searches for the mythical planet "Polo". Unless you are actually searching
for Polo you want to modify the program. It uses level 1 information but
that is easily changed (with the expense of speed). I have used it to look
for water worlds, high governments, etc... [see also capital].

NAME xx yy zz NumNames
	This uses the languages tables for the given system to produce
names. It produces as many names as given but the default is one.

HEXMAP xx yy zz time
	This is for producing a standard 15,000 mile per hex space map
for the area surrounding a planet. The time is optional to give settings
for the satelites. It doesn\'t seem to work for all planets correctly.
It first asks for the planet, then prints a list of the satelites and what
page they would appear on. It then asks for the number of pages wide and long.
It writes to the specified file in strips. Each is designed to fit on your
standard 8" paper in condenced mode. The strips can then be seperated and
taped together for your battle map.
	Try tracing the routes of the ships in coloured pencil as the
battle progresses. We did once and it was really worthwhile. Just like the
tatical maps in Star Wars!

PRMAP xx yy zz PlanetName
	This prints a triangle map of a planet surface. It prompts for a
file name to store the result in. It is straight ascii. It will ask for 
a triangle, specifier and size. See sysgen4 for an explanation of what 
these mean.

EPMAP xx yy zz PlanetName
	If under MS-DOS this prints a map to the PRN port. If under UNIX
you will want to change the line in the file or else a file called PRN will
be created. The graphics are printed with standard Epson FX-80 compatable
outputs. It will ask for a triangle, specifier and size. See sysgen4 for
an explanation of what these mean.

TCMAP xx yy zz PlanetName
	This is completely analagous to PRMAP except it prints the output
on the screen. It is only compilable under TurboC.

SECPRNT xx yy zz
	This prints a 10x10x10 "sector" starting with the coordinates given.
It uses Epson FX-80 compatable escape sequences for italics, and underligning
(to indicate POP of worlds). Waits for a keypress between pages.

CAPITAL xx yy zz
	This is similar to scan except it searches a 10x10x10 "sector" starting
with the coordinates given. It was originally used to determine the best planet
as a captial for a "sector". The current example searches for the highest tech
level. It uses level-1 information.

" ... or experimental versions ..."
Sounds like prototypes to me.  Besides, in due time the Imperials should
learn how to copy the things.  And one or two places are now TL 16, and
should be capable of designing them.  The Darrians probably have a few
hidden away somewhere; and two Vargr worlds are TL 16, according to the
old Vargr Alien Module.

This depends on how the PC\'s get hold of it.  (Assuming that they do, of
course - and assuming that they role-play properly, and don\'t make use of
what the players read in various manuals.)  If they got one by looting an
Imperial warship, they are probably more powerful than they have any right
to be, but can probably interrogate someone from the ship.  If they got one
the same way as the Navy did, by looting an Ancient base, and if the Navy
hasn\'t been publishing documents about black globes, then the PC\'s  will
not know what they have, or what it does.

I don\'t see the danger.  If the ship has absorbed enough energy to make the
jump, it absorbed the energy into the jump capacitors.  If it still exists,
it hasn\'t overloaded the capacitors.  There should be no risk of overload
due to trying to jump - either the capacitors are sufficiently charged for
the jump, leave them alone; or they need a little more charge, give it to
them.

Good point.  TDR is neutral enough that GDW won\'t have a copyright cow,
etc.  As for the predicted immenent demise of TDR: 8-P we shall survive 8-)

BTW: random vehicle design commentary; if you attempt to use a COACC engine
in another vehicle, be Very Very careful.  from analysis and comparason to
existing engines, they\'re twice as powerful (or more) than they should be.
My COACC rework is taking this into account, and making some other changes,
but you might want to think twice about the Fusion-Rocket powered starships.

	I\'ve been having email conversations with Robert Dean about what to
do with maneuver drives.  I\'m going to relist some of the salient points and
conclude by asking a question I asked Rob... whether strict reality or 
retaining compatability is more important.

[i\'m trying to be neutral but probably failed... 8-]

	The first point is that it\'s obvious that the current description
and justification for maneuver drives won\'t cut it as is.  
	Second point is that it doesn\'t matter for most ships that players will
deal with, as a simple change to thrust-based will not change the maneuver 
drive mass-to-performance for most \'normal\' ships.  Counterpoint: there are 
a lot of non-\'normal\' ships out there, and any such move would render the
designs incompatable.  Subpoint of this would be a \'flavor-of-game\' alteration,
because heavily armoured naval ships would end up with 1-G or less and most
player ships will be able to RUN AWAY 8-) ...
	Third point: my pseudo-physics explanation for reactionless and 
volume-based drives seems to work, and it remains compatable. 
	Fourth point: so does Rob\'s thrust based... and it\'s easier for some
people to swallow.

[rob, fill in here if i missed anything important...]

Anyway: my conclusion is thus: we can make one of two changes; either go
with the easier-to believe thrust based drives, and render starships outside
the \'normal\' range incompatable (and possibly less useful [personal comment])
or, we can accept the somewhat further-out volume based system and remain
compatable with previous design rules.
	I have a personal preference for which way to go, but since it\'s not
just my project, other people ought to have a say.  Let the debate begin 8-)

BAD NEWS!!!

     Earlier I posted a "if it ain\'t broke don\'t fix it" warning.  This is
a "if you can\'t fix it leave it alone" warning.  During lunch today I took
to playing with some numbers.  From an earlier post I got some figures for
a scout/courier (I don\'t have books at work so I have to trust these numbers)
that said:

     Displacement - 100 tons
     Unload Mass  - 1084.0707 tons
     Acceleration - 2G

     Now the amount of energy obtained from the fusion of 1 ton of hydrogen
into helium is 2.58 E6 Joules (roughly).  This assumes all the mass 
difference between 4 hydrogen and 1 helium is converted to energy.  Since
this is not true, the actual energy output will be lower.  

     A scout ship accelerating at 1G for 1 hour will cover a distance of
63568.8 km and be travelling at a speed of 35.3 km/s or 127,137.6 km/hr.
The amount of energy consumed during the hour will be 6.76 E14 Joules just
to propel the ship.  This is equivelant to 2.62 E8 tons of hydrogen!

     Clearly manuever drives are going to violate physics or they will not
work.  Notice this makes no assumptions about how you move the ship the only
assumptions made are its mass and acceleration and that it starts from rest.
Energy must be conserved.

ANOTHER TOPIC

     I read in (1766) black globes by Paul Baughman -

Why can\'t it maneuver?  With reactionless thrusters which don\'t emit anything
to be absorbed by the field, you should be able to maneuver all you want.  Of
course, you can\'t *SEE* where you are going, and running into an asteroid
(after you drop the field) could ruin your day, but what is the handwaving-
pseudo-technical explanation for why you can\'t maneuver?

END OF EXERPT -

Correction - you emit energy.  In order for the ship to move it MUST exchange
energy with the "rest of the universe" which it can not do while in a
Black Globe.  Reactionless (imho) means that it does not generate the force
by expelling matter out the exhaust.

     The deeper I look into Traveller\'s physical problems (prompted in
part by all the talk on the lists) the more I find that many of the places
that violate physics do so because its more intertaining and playable (and
more like the movies and books we\'ve all read).  Places I\'ve seen that may
not be fixable include Jump Drive, Maneuver drives, Anti-Gravity, repulsor
or tractor beams, and nuclear dampers.  Some of these can be talked around
using pseudo-physics and handwaving at least to the point that they\'re not
glaring problems.

     Then there are the places where the physics is easy enough to fix but
do we really want to.  An example of this kind of problem is the travel
times between planets in a single star system.  The problem is these
calculation assume you go straight from planet A to planet B accelerating
half way, decelerating the other half.  Aside from being EXTREMELY energy
inefficient, this is not possible.  All movement will be effected by the
gravity of the two planets and the sun(s) forcing the craft to fly some
sort of hyperbolic (or parabolic) path at least near the planets.  You
simply can not "warp out of orbit" in a straight line no matter how much
thrust you ship has let alone with merely 1 - 6 G\'s.  Now we can fix this
but the travel times may become unacceptably long and, even though this
is a violation of the laws of physics, it doesn\'t really impact on the
game (that is it doesn\'t NEED to impact on the game).

     It bothers me when games ignore physical laws blatantly but I am coming
to see that it is often neccessary if we are to have the games reflect
the kind of science fiction movie/book settings we\'ve come to expect.
Interstellar travel and trade, huge fleets battling for control of the
empire, robots, technical wonders, and heros and heroines fighting for
noble causes (or greed).

I hope this didn\'t spoil your day!

All very true.  But the last sentence really should end with "...just some
tools, a little time, and the NECCESSARY SKILLS."  In this I think the point
that Adrian makes is correct: without Mechanical-1 or better, you probably
shouldn\'t be allowed to do it unpenalized.  Trying to bent a caved-in clip
or a bent leaf-spring back into shape (the CORRECT shape) is a difficult
task, as anyone who has tried can tell you.  On the other hand, clearing
a jammed cartridge does not typically constitute "repairing damage" in the
MT sense, since it takes no special talent other than the ability to operate
the weapon.  you might want to treat a cartridge jam as "superficial damage",
a bent clip as "minor damage", a broken trigger or firing-pin as "major
damage", and a bent barrel/crushed receiver as "destroyed".

In fact, the Imperial Encyclopedia does list the velocity as 1500 m/s.

MT does NOT list gauss weapons as being "recoilless".  They list them as
being "low recoil", which is appropriate.  If you consider both F=ma and
Newton\'s 3rd Law ("Equal and opposite reaction") then the amount of enery
delivered to each gauss needle (and thus acceleration, since the needle\'s
mass is constant) is equal to the amount of recoil energy delivered to
the gauss weapon firing the needle.  Since the weapon outweighs the needle
by several orders of magnitude (4 gm. vs. 3.5 Kg., in the case of a gauss
rifle), the recoil of the weapon is going to be virtually zip.

End of story.

	My first proposal: let meson screens give an effective armour factor
against incoming meson weapons rather than simply stopping some of the
incoming fire dead.

	I don\'t really understand the physics involved, but the way I
understand the Starship Operator\'s Manual and the Refs Guide, meson
screens are supposed to slow down the incoming meson packet and make
it detonate outside the ship.  Hopefully every incoming meson packet
will be slowed down, which means that the fire will no longer hit the
delicate central parts of the ship.  Instead the fire will hit the
more robust outer sections.

	Sure, if you slow the packet down enough it won\'t hit you at all.
Unfortunately, large spinal mounts have a nasty tendancy to cut through
meson screens without showing any ill effects.  I don\'t really see any
ratonal for having a hit or miss result.  Using the screen as armour means
that every incoming meson weapon will be effected.

	Anybody like to comment about this idea?  If there are any real
complaints I\'ll retract the idea.


	Someone mentioned synchronising your fire with the flicker of
your black globe.  I like this idea also.  The current rules give a lot
\'evidence\' that the weapons fire in discreet lumps.  (meson packets are
mentions, missiles are entities, pulse lasers are too, Fusion/Plasma guns
would most likely fire shots.  PA\'s fire bursts also.  Beam lasers most
probably wouldn\'t).  Why not allow firing while the globe is flickered
off?  Other starships wouldn\'t be able to detect your turning off your globe
to let a battery of missiles out (the distances involved are large, I don\'t
have my ref\'s guide here but the distances involved are quite sizable even
at the speed of light) ---- they are simply too far away to react before you
turn your globe back on.  Since globes are experimental at TL15 (whatever
that really means), it could be dis-allowed until TL16 which means the game
will not be alter much (who runs campaings over TL15????).

	And finally, some random ramblings about how I think TDR should come
out.....

	I think that a complete re-write is totally out of the question.  It
would be too big a task to do in our spare time.  I\'d prefer to see an
evolution of the current rules into something that contains more internal
consistancy (and a better basis in real physics).  This would mean that,
we don\'t just throw something out because it seems silly.  We\'d have to
either alter the definition a little to make that thing possible or throw
the thing out and replace it with something plausable.  (the reactionless
drive makes a nice example of both choices:  throw it out and replace it
with a reaction based drive or try to find some justification for it, i.e.
find something for it to push against).

	For starships (one of my pet areas :-), I\'d like to see some
intermediate values put into the tables.  There is no reason for a spinal
meson gun-A to be as inefficient at TL15 ass it is at TL12!  It would
probably be possible to build a real working meson gun given current
technology (I think they are actually used to burn cancerous stuff out
of people), it would not be practable to do so.  The communication gear
has a nice set of intermediate values (even if they are a bit simplistic),
why not everything else???? [ the answer is that it would make for too many
extra tables ]

Your figure for the amount of energy from fusing 1 ton of
hydrogen into helium is about 2.6 MegaJoules.  Now, an
engineer :-) would look at that and say "We currently have
power plants that put out thousands of Megawatts, and they
certainly aren\'t fusing thousands of tons of hydrogen every
second.  I must have goofed."

I double checked and got:

Hydrogen: 1.00794 grams/mole    Helium 4.0026 grams/mole

4 H  -  1 He  =  0.02916 grams/mole of matter converted to energy

1 ton of Hydrogen is 992122.547 moles so there are

(992122.547 moles * 0.02916 grams/mole) = 28930.3 grams of
matter converted to energy.  Or 28.93kg since I hate cgs :-).

Use E= m * c^2 to get

E = (28.93 kg) * (3.0 x 10^11 m/s)^2 = 2.60 * 10^24 Joules

Your figure for the energy consumed by a scout ship accelerating 
at 1G for 1 hour, 6.76 E 14 Joules, is correct.

So using the new figure for energy from fusing, this scout ship
will have consumed

[ 6.76 E14 Joules  /  ( 2.60 E24 Joules/ton of H fused)] =
        = 2.6 E-10 tons 

or 260 micrograms of Hydrogen fused.  I think we have the 
reverse problem!  This process is too efficient!  To burn
(how much does a scout ship hold?) 20(?) tons of hydrogen
in 4 weeks of constant use, we\'d have to operate at, oh...
0.0000002% efficiency (within a couple orders of magnitude)

Hello,

	Sorry to barge in late on the discussion, I am fighting the dark
forces for a proper account.

	In any case, Operating a weapon should be considered a class skill.
That is -

		If you know how to operate a single weapon in a class, then
		you can operate ALL STANDARD weapons in this class with
		reduced efficiency UNTIL FAMILIARIZATION. After a given
		period of time has passed (and the new weapon/weapons were
		in use) the skill is acquired fully.


	Fixing a weapon is a problematic affair. Of course, machining firing
pins and slides is quite beyond anyone lacking a Mechanical-x and AT LEAST
one level of (Mettalurgy - in parenthesis, I don\'t think MT has one). BUT!,
identifying what is wrong is quite simple - a complete stripping shows that,

     Oh, certainly.  I just generally associate the word "prototype"
with "newly-developed experimental device."  If you are copying some
pre-existing thing, it\'d call that an "experimental copy."

     If the device is something that *you* developed (including the
theory behind it), then I\'d assume a better understanding of the
device on the part of the developers.

     Personally, I\'d rather have one of the recovered Ancient artifacts
rather than a new-made copy (though I *think* that there were only
2,000 of those that were found).  I\'d tend to distrust the understanding
of the copiers.

     Unless it\'s a derelict.  As I recall, there is mention of several
black globe-equipped drelict ships here and there in the official
publications.  Like the _Kinunir_, for example.

     No, but if they feed the correct power into it, it\'ll turn on
(possibly damaging the surround).  If they don\'t, then it *should* do
nothing (I admit, *if* Grandfather used proper fail-safe design
philosophy).

     Ah, but what if your jump capacitors are fully charged, you\'re
preparing to jump out of a *very* dangerous situation, *and your globe
gets hit again*?  More energy (possibly a great deal more, depending on
how many opponents you have to deal with) is channeled to your already
fully-charged jump drive capacitors.  Result?  Boom.

     What I was obviously insufficiently clear in saying was that it
was probably not a good idea to *plan* on using that particular method
of escape *unless* you have the added safety margin of a few extra
capacitors to deal with that pesky problem of last-microsecond hits to
the globe.  If jump capacitors were all I had, I would plan on using
different tactics (unless, of course I just happened to be in the
situation by chance--then I\'d press the jump drive\'s "doit" button).

     I just like to have ample safety margins whenever possible--could
you tell?  ;-)

m,y suggestion.  (-: (-:  However, a few extra points could be considered...
most heavily armored naval vessels can or do carry lightly armored auxiliaries,
which would still be larger than the typical players vessel, and could chase
them down as they tried to accelerate away at 2Gs.  Any retention of the volume
bases system needs a clear explanation of what happens in the close proximity
of a planetary surface when you attempt to use your maneuver drive (even if
that explanation is a clear statement that Nothing Awful Happens).  As it
stands now, there is a strange zone of incompatibilty when you cross the line
between "vehicles" and "spaceships" that would be retained.

By the way, does anyone out there besides Metlay go back as far as the first
edition of High Guard?  The one that clearly stated that you could use your
maneuver drive as a fusion gun in an emergency?  I, personally, would be in
favor of dropping this whole thrusters business and replacing them with
"reasonable" fusion rockets...something that the physics types cook up based
on "reasonable" fusion efficiencies, current engine weight categories, and
calculations starting with exhaust velocities of the resulting helium/hydrogen
stream.

[I for one had a mint copy of Edition 1 High Gaurd in High School.  It
was so worn I had to glue in page hinges to keep the book from falling
apart.  I eventually gave it away when I got the second edition of High
Gaurd.  Just after I got the first edition, I did a "Trillion Credit
Squadron" sort of campaign with two of my players -- one designed a
dozen really big TL15 ships, and was so positive he was indestructible
he invited me (the ref) and the other player to do our worst.  With our
thrifty spending we built about 50 medium-sized TL13
battleships/carriers and a giant decoy ship.  They each carried about
500 100-ton modified scout vessels with 6G manuever drives and triple
beam turrets.  The Scout ships were surface-mounted on the
battleship/carriers.  When the battle began (instigated by the player
with hubris), the decoy lumbered out and immediately drew the proud
player\'s fire.  The scout ships launched, used their lasers as point
defense, and swarmed over to the attacking player\'s fleet.  The primary
damage inflicted was the point-blank fusion gun effect of the scout
manuever drives.  The battle ended predictably, with the
battleship/carrier player losing the giant decoy and only bring about
1/3 of his fleet into the combat -- the fusion drive scouts won the day.
Notably, I developed a statistical combat system for the scout ships -
since there were thousands of them flying around. -- James]

    'body' => '	Various people have been posting about manuver drives and how to make
them obey physics without changing the system too much.  I spent a fair
amount of time working on this last January, and posted some of the
results.  I\'ll summarize to conserve bandwidth.  My basic feeling is
that conservation of energy is worth fighting for, even if other physics
violations are used.
	It is IMPOSSIBLE to have a truly reactionless drive that does not
violate conservation of energy.  This follows from the principle of
relativity and the fact that reactionless drives by definition violate
conservation of momentum.  I can post a proof if there is sufficient
interest or disbelief.  It is possible to have a "pseudo-reactionless"
drive similar to grav thrusters.  The assumption needed is that the
vehicle with the drive is using it to push on the planet (or whatever)
just as if it had wheels and was in physical contact, conserving
momentum.  In order to conserve energy, however, the energy required to
accelerate at a fixed rate is going to rise steadily as the vehicles
velocity increases.
	Example:  A grav car massing 1000 kg that starts at rest accelerates at
1 meter/sec^2 for 10 seconds, giving a speed of 10 meters/second and a
kinetic energy of 50,000 kg m^2/s^2 = 50,000 joules.  This is the amount
of energy that must be provided to the drive assuming 100% efficiency. 
Now assume it accelerates for another 10 seconds at 1 m/s^2 (same
acceleration for same amount of time).  It is then is moving at 20 m/s
and has a kinetic energy of 200,000 joules for an increase of 150,000
joules, which must be provided to the drive.
	A plausible way for the drives to work is assume that they have a
maximum power, and the acceleration thus drops as the vehicle\'s speed
increases.  Also, some power input should be required to hover, even
though none is theoretically required, since the velocity is not
changing.  This "coupling energy" could rise as the vehicle gets farther
away from the planet, since the gravitational field is getting weaker.
The starship thruster plates could have a coupling energy that would not
depend on distance, as before.  Note also that braking would require NO
energy, and in fact you could get energy back (regenerative braking).
	One point that has been raised is the potential playability problem if
the formulas for acceleration are "too complicated".  Actually, they
will be much simpler than similar formulas for finding the acceleration
of an ordinary automobile (ever wonder why they give the acceleration as
0 to 60 in x seconds?), as well as being simpler than a rocket (mass
isn\'t changing).
	I am working on a set of rules for manuver and grav drives based on the
"pushing against a planet/star" idea and I\'ll post them soon.

	Sincerely,
			Guardian of Energy Conservation

It\'s still wrong anyway.  You can\'t fuse 4 H (=4 protons) into a He (=2 protons
+ 2 neutrons); you need two deuteriums (an isotope of hydrogen with a proton
and a neutron) or an ordinary hydrogen and a Tritium (=proton + 2 neutrons).
You could also have some exotic reactions with 3 atoms, or perhaps involving
lithium.

I always assumed Trav refining plants were heavy hydrogen isotope extractors,
although why having too much ordinary hydrogen in the fuel should cause
misjumps is a mystery.

Unfortunately I don\'t have a molar weight for deuterium handy.

My feeling is that over the changes in TL we should plan for a continum from
one extreme to the other in TDR, from where the drives are horribly
ineffiecent, to where you never fill your fuel tanks.  I think we should plan
rules to cover differing technologies of space drives.  It might be that you
have campaigns that use ion, fusion and fission rocket in the same game.

One other thought.  It might be that only a small part of the hydrogen used in
a spacecraft is fused.  It might be that the majority is used in the rocket as
reaction mass.  Possibly at some TL\'s it might be required for cooling
purposes.
On the other end of the spectrum, most people assume that the energy is from
the fusion of hydrogen to helium.  Has anyone considered fusion other elements,
or fusing multiple elements at high TL?

drive systems that rely on taking a ship out of our space-time and plopping it
temporarily in some "hyperspace" or "jump space" are going to violate
relativity.  (Specifically, you will invariably get reverse time travel.)
Here\'s why:

FTL, by definition, gets you from A to B faster than light can do it.  Once you
get to B, you can accelerate in normal space back to A until your velocity is
near c.  Start your FTL drive again, and you will arrive back at A in your new
reference frame, moving at just under c, some time before you left.  The only
way to solve this problem is to have ONE reference frame.  That is forbidden
under Special Relativity.

If you didn\'t follow that argument, here it is in a different form.  Say A is
the Earth, at noon.  Using your FTL, you jump to Alpha Centauri and arrive
there at 1 pm.  Accelerate in normal space toward Earth, get near c.  You are a
real stud and can take 40 G\'s of acceleration or whatever.  3 pm your time, 6
pm Earth time, but your reference frame still includes the Earth of two weeks
ago.  (Don\'t forget that information can\'t travel faster than light.)  Try
using your FTL again.  Whoops!  Back at Earth two weeks before you left.

What does this all mean?  Traveller doesn\'t work, nothing works, you are
doomed, SFRPG\'s will never be realistic.

Well, I think this underscores a more fundamental problem than all the physics
problems in Traveller.  Basically, folks, most of you have lost sight of the
fact that Traveller is a GAME.  In fact, it purports to be a ROLE PLAYING game.
If you\'re in it for space combat, tough shit.  There are many excellent space
combat systems available.  The point is to have fun.  Granted, some of the
inconsistencies grate on people\'s nerves, but when you get right down to it
there is nothing you can do without violating some laws of physics.

I\'m not really flaming the efforts of people to make Traveller more bearable,
but what some of you are trying to do is model reality.  You can\'t do it.  I\'ve
been watching all this talk about Black Globes and reactionless thrusters, and
I just have to laugh.  As long as you don\'t get a free ride (i.e., getting
something for nothing), what\'s the problem?  Who cares about the nitty gritty
details?  _I_ know the rules are "wrong," so do you.  {shrug}

Hopefully, the people who are going to spend all their time working on TDR will
realize that they are trying to fix the more broken aspects of Traveller
(trade, weapons, etc.) without losing sight of the fact that it is an RPG.
I applaud the effort.

As for ASCII, I can see how a lot of people would want to get straight ASCII
text and print it out.  I would recommend that the people doing this use Emacs
or else use a word processor that has an ASCII output option -- you\'re going to
want to use some kind of formatting for all those wonderful tables.

For those who want a nicer looking presentation -- something you can put in a
flex binder and show to people, or at least have readable -- I am willing to
put in my time and convert the final results into a machine-ready form so that
the docs can be typeset.  Then it is a matter of making the PostScript files
(or whatever) publically readable.  I would also be willing to make hard copies
and send them out via snail mail to whomever is interested in having nicely
typeset docs instead of unreadable dot matrix output.  (Just send me a check to
reimburse me for reproduction costs.)

And since no one on the TDR team is interested, I am willing to help coordinate
development of software for ship design, character generation, etc., assuming
that the TDR people are going to get all the algorithms to be self-consistent,
easy to understand, and amenable to computational algorithm.  Obviously, there
will be nothing to "jabber about and argue over until it dies of inertia" if
the TDR people do their jobs right.  IF.

I gotta see this.

allows fusion of ordinary hydrogen through some heretofore unknown exotic

This means that Mr. Day\'s interpretation of fuel refining as extraction of
heavy isotopes from lighter ones (of hydrogen, that is) is WRONG.  As I
understand fuel refining, the difference between refined and unrefined fuels is
that unrefined fuels contain hydrogen in combination with other atoms (i.e.,
the fuel contains methane and water and other shit in addition to pure H).
This seems to be echoed by other physics-minded refs I\'ve spoken to.  Military
craft are often fitted to use unrefined fuels, and presumably can refuel at a
gas giant or on a water world -- and this fits the general scheme of things.

That\'s what I thought, until I added the mass of 4 Hydrogen atoms
and found it to be greater than the mass of one Helium atom.  THinking
about it, a single hydrogen atom could be converted into a neutron
(neutron = proton + electron), so on paper, you could get a helium
atom from 4 hydrogen atoms.  I doubt it\'s so in real life.

There are a lot of other things involved (like neutrinos and such)
which I\'m no guru on, so could some physics guru take over from here?
And I never expected my result to be the final word.  It was just a
ballpark estimate.

And as for "this thread is silly, Traveller is supposed to be fun":
There are some of us who think that trying to explain Traveller rules
in terms of real life lots of fun.  Oh yeah, if relativity is having
problems explaining jump drives, change relativity.  I\'m sure Einstein
never intended relativity to account for *everything* in the universe.

First of all let me say that I have as little to do with physics as possible...
so doubtless this is nothing but more hand-waving.
Lots of people have been saying that you can\'t have a reactionless thruster
because it violates conservation of momentum, or a jump drive because it
violates casuality.  But isn\'t that just according to the physics we know now?
Wait!  Before you take Plasma Rifle in hand to blast me to atoms, isn\'t it
possible that in the next, what, 5,000 years, that enough progress will be made
in physics to show that what the ancient Terrans (circa 2000) thought was
impossible might become possible?  Perhaps in 3-D space and Einsteinian Physics
FTL drives are impossible, but in 6-D space and Baughmanian physics it is not?

I hereby put forward a theory for your consideration.  There are actually six
dimensions and that there is a limit to how fast information can travel.  This
limit is six parsecs per week.  This limit shall be known for ever afterward as
the Speed of Rumor in a vacuum.  I can show mathematically that nothing can
travel faster than Rumor.  Of course, you probably won\'t understand the math...
;+))))

Semi-seriously, though, our knowledge of things scientific is progressing
constantly, so why assume we currently know all there is to know about physics?
Aren\'t there things we know now that were once proved impossible?  Isn\'t it
just possible that the things we KNOW now will be disproved in the future?

Please allow me time to engage my Black Globe before you reply.  ;+)

I just finished reading Knightfall and I\'m still perplexed by something
that happens fairly early on the piece. My rating of Knightfall: the
plot is okay, but the trading rules and Massilia sector data are more
worthwhile.


****SPOILER WARNING Skip to the next message if you don\'t want to know

In one of the early "nuggets" the player\'s ship is boarded by a patrol
cruiser under the pretense that the player\'s travel log did not agree
with the library data of the cruiser. What gives here? As far as I knew,
only the ship id was broadcast via the transponder. How did the patrol
cruiser captain get hold of the travel log to compare against library
data? Does this also imply that the system authorities have the travel
logs for all ships? If the players had never been to the system before
how could the cruiser have their travel log in the archive? This fairly
minor detail really bugs me. Does anyone have a reasonable explanation?

On a related note, how do you handle customs in your campaign. For
example, does every starport have a customs station that all characters
must pass through to get access to the startown? What happens when
someone tries to take an illegal weapon onto the world? Who stops them?

Lots of questions, not many answers!

Cheers, Iain.

My honest, impartial opinion, is that GDW won\'t give a flying f*ck if someone

In earlier mail i complained that I don\'t like some of Metlay\'s TDR ideas.
Let me explain more clearly why...

	What we\'re trying to do with TDR is Fix things...things we see as brokeand things we want to see done better.  Ideally, we\'ll come up with a much
better set of rules that the current ones for what we\'re addressing.
	This does us no good whatsoever if it ends up the \'internet version\' of
Traveller.  As long as we\'re keeping it quiet and not distributing it or info
about it, nobody else is going to find out about it, use it, or benefit from
our work.  If 95% of the MT players/GM\'s never find out about our better rules,
we\'ve wasted 95% of our effort.
	Now, the BEST way to get our new rules out is a combination of the way
we\'re doing now (electronic) and the way the majority of people get their rules
and supplemental materials: through the people who make the game.  GDW has
published a lot of expansion material that edges towards what we\'re doing, m
mostly in Challenge, and has licenced other people to do other things that they
thought were good.  They\'ve no reason to fear us as long as we\'re not trying to
take their game away.  Which we aren\'t, we\'re just trying to make it better.
	I say we tell them about it.  Ask them for input.  Ask them if they\'ll
either run some of the TDS stuff in Challenge or not object to running it 
somewhere else.  {Challenge will almost certainly leap at the idea...they\'re
starved for Traveller articles right now).  That\'s how I see the best way to
spread the good word 8-) 

	And I have a proposed middle ground for the Public Domain issue: I\'ll 
hereby allow free electronic redistribution w/o restriction of any of MY work
or anything that i help with, but I don\'t relinquish copyright.  I think that\'s 
the only balanced solution.

Oops.  I checked.  There are fusion chains in which a proton decays to
give a neutron.  But the isotope reactions are a couple of orders
of magnitude more efficient, according to the ``Spaceflight Handbook\'\'.
I also remember that the plans for BIS\'s Deadulus probe (to Barnard\'s Star)
called for fusion fuel pellets primarily of deuterium/tritium.  More
tomorrow (and hopefully some numbers).

I\'d rather have the Ancient version for another reason - it\'s probably a

And if they make a good job of looting the Kinunir, they are probably more
powerful than they have any right to be.  Wait till they get caught in
possession of nuclear missiles, Marine battledress, and a black globe.

Perhaps I should have said "I don\'t see the _extra_ danger".  If, as a result
of using the globe, your capacitors are fully charged, you don\'t choose to
jump, and you get hit again, boom.  Answer: if your capacitors are fully
charged, you switch off the globe pronto, and try to discharge them as quickly
as possible - e.g. by jumping.

There is a safety marging available if your jump drive is capable of more than
a jump 1.  Let the capacitors get sufficiently charged for a jump 1, then
execute a jump 1.  If your jump drive isn\'t capable of more than jump 1, then
it\'s probably the sort of ship you want to replace anyway as a first priority.

...from a nuclear physicist, if that counts for anything.

First off, Robert, I would LOVE to argue stellar physics with you-- your
premise that the Sun runs on "ordinary hydrogen" is correct, but you\'ve
failed to realize what "ordinary hydrogen" IS. It\'s mostly protium, but
there\'s a plenty large enough trace percentage of deuterium and tritium
in it to let a deuteron+deuteron=alpha+gammas reaction take place. The
fusion drives in Traveller refine fuel to eliminate nonhydrogen atoms,
and what\'s left is only partly deuterium, but that part is plenty to get
a good reaction going. If you want abundances, energy yields per atom,
etc., I suppose I could post them, but let\'s not get ridiculous. The 
primary difference between protium and deuterium, the presence of a neutron,
makes all the difference between fusion and fizzle. If all you had was
protium, you\'d need to combine a four-object collision that has a vanishingly
small reaction cross section with electron capture and other weak interactions.
Not impossible. Possibly even practical, in a plasma bath the size of a star.
But with deuterium around in as much quantity as it is, why bother?

And the reaction really takes off if there\'s tritium involved... the problem
there is that we get extra neutron flux, i.e. hard radiation. But I suggest
that we leave this part of the rules alone-- my next post, which will appear
tonight or tomorrow, will have (among other things) what a real fusion 
reactor\'s yield is predicted to be, and how fusion would work if I were 
running this universe-- excerpts from the proceedings of a FASCINATING
conference on fusion that took place recently.....

a personalised mug. When sipped it murmmurs, moans and sweet nothings with 
increasing intensity as the liquid is drained until with the last drop the 
ejaculations reach their natural climax. Price 1600Cr (they clubbed together).

I assume 10Cr = $1.

Following on with the ideas inherent in flickering black globes ...

(I\'m taking most of this info from Interceptor/Centurion/Leviathan
board games and Legionnaire RPG, from FASA)

They developed a gravitational field effect that generated (I think)
several thousand Gs on it\'s surface - the first time it was tried
the thing imploded and took out most of the lab as it drained it\'s
power source (don\'t we just love inventions that blow up!?)

So the guy came up with the idea of flickering it on and off - this
avoided the exponential curve of the power drain, and still provided
the practical effect.

When the system became portable, they started using it for fighters,
as a marvellous way of stopping laser and mass weapons (yes, photons
at speed have mass ... it\'s just when they\'re at rest that they don\'t)
but found that the constraints of the power supply meant that the flicker
rate couldn\'t really be varied much.

The methods of firing at a flickering ship were either to keep the weapon
trained continuiously (in the case of laser and particle weapons), or to
try to synchronise the attack with the flicker. Synchronisation proved
to be the best in terms of power expenditure, and so lasers attacked at
the flicker-rate-range for that model of target.

On the ground, the grav-tanks could carry much more equipment, and so
were able to have more control over their shields. However, as the distances
on the ground were much less than those in combat in space, ground bases
units were able to employ painting lasers, whose sole job was to contact the
shield and by varying it\'s frequency was able to figure out the flicker
rate of the target. This information was then broadcast to every unit,
and the shield was effectively negated.

The grav-shields take a finite amount of time to generate and dissapate,
although short, and this time delay is the basis of the painting laser -
once it has analyzed the flicker rate, it has <x>ms to transmit the
information to other units, before the rate changes.

Simple game mechanics - Legionnaire is a d10 based game, and so it
uses a single d10 roll to see if a shield has been penetrated - the
shields have flicker values of 1 to 9 (quoted as 10 to 90, just to
sound good - note that a rate of 100 doesn\'t flicker, and destroys
the user as in the initila experiment).

The relative cost of the differing rates, and the improvement in protection
can be sensibly modelled using the distribution of 2D6, as in ...

|                                            |          _/----

+----                            +----
   Bell curve distribution                     Cumulative distribution.
(apologies to any real statistitions out there ... I think it\'s clear :-)

Basically, the cumulative curve can be used for both cost and effectiveness,
as the lower rates are cheap but useless, the mid-range ones climb steeply
in both categories, and there isn\'t much difference between 80 and 90 ...
Note that this is slightly different from FASAs approach, but I think it
makes a bit more sense ...

Perhaps a proper rule master could tidy this idea up a bit ...
And hey! What about the TDR then ? I\'m not submitting this as it\'s not
completely worked out ... anybody willing to help out? (like, do it all!)

The general rule here in the states is that when you file your flight
plan, you check the box labeled "adcus".  Then you make sure you\'re
on time.  "adcus" means "advise customs".  Normally in the U.S. if
you\'re fair-weather flying (navigating by ground reference, good 
visibility etc.) flight plans are optional.  When you go accross the
border they are mandatory.

Canadian customs is great to work with.  U.S. customs SU**S!  They
are surly, obnoxious, and prone to charge you fines for failing to
declare your pet fish on departure.  Almost all good-sized airports
in North America (the ones served by >1 commercial airline and near
a city > 100,000 people) also have a full-time and on-call customs
office.

In MT terms, then I call these class A and class B starports.  They
*will have* customs.  Otherwise, you might have anything you feel the
adventure needs.  Special ops, duty-free ports, whatever.

I and some others whose names are etherialized did some work with

Jo (Yoquinta  sp?) has done some good mapping stuff, and Dan and Mark Cook

If you\'re a star, it\'s very possible.  You can also get a neutron from a proton
by positron emission.  There are lots of things that can happen.  And, yes,
neutrinos do play a role in energy conservation and such.  We still haven\'t
totally resolved the issue of neutrinos coming from the sun.  (Remember that
neutrino deficit people keep talking about?  It\'s real, and only now people are
trying to explain it away by "neutrino oscillation," that is, the mixing of
"flavors" of neutrinos.  This, incidentally, has an impact on the detection of
neutrinos.  If the physics is right, then detectible neutrinos should be
converted to undetectible types with greater and greater probability as the
distance from the source increases.  This should probably play a role in the
TDR rules, just to put a limitation on the range of neutrino scanners that is
"realistic.")

By the way, things like Jump Drive and such work just fine if you specify that
they only work in ONE reference frame.  A standard out -- hand waving wise --
is to use the reference frame at rest with respect to the cosmic background
radiation.  That way, you avoid messy stuff like time travel, and you can
always detect microwaves, so it\'s not as though you\'re ever "blind" -- they\'re
everywhere!  I imagine in TDR that a standard piece of equipment in the sensor
suite of a ship is some kind of "Big Bang microwave detector" which must be
used to align the ship with the proper ref. frame.  If damaged, the ship might
misjump or even (gasp!) be sent into never-never land.  Literally.

HOW I\'D DO FUSION IF I RAN THE TRAVELLER UNIVERSE (and how humaniti would
do it if they could):

Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Series A Volume 271,
1988, carried the proceedings of a conference on the theory of Aneutronic
Fusion Reactors (AFRs). Unlike Neutronic Fusion Reactors (NFRs) like the
deuteron-deuteron and deuteron-triton reactors being developed at Princeton
et alii, AFRs utilize a different sort of fusion reaction with different 
yields and byproducts for more favorable results. An overview:

NUCLEAR FISSION: Fuel is enriched uranium 235/238
                 Waste is assorted uranium, plutonium, thorium
                 Reaction is: U+n=2 pieces+more n\'s
                 Easy to build and run
                 Fuel is costly and dangerous
                 Waste is radioactive and useless
                 Containment vessel becomes "hot" after a long time
                 Can be designed to make bomb-grade materials like plutonium
                 Some designs can runaway; all can melt down
                 Theoretical limit of efficiency: 33%
                 Requires heavy shielding during and after use
                 Power yield per ton: circa .001 MW
                 Smallest feasible reactor: not sure, it\'s used on subs.

NFR (D+D, D+T):  Fuel is ordinary hydrogen or even water
                 Waste is ordinary hydrogen, water, some helium
                 Reaction is: D+D=alpha or D+T=alpha+n
                 Difficult to build and run
                 Fuel is commonplace and cheap
                 Waste is clean and harmless
                 Containment vessel rapidly gets VERY "hot", must be replaced
                 Can easily make bomb-grade materials like tritium
                 Primary hazard is meltdown, though it wouldn\'t be easy
                 Theoretical limit of efficiency: 50%
                 requires progressively more shielding as it runs
                 Power yield per ton: .01 MW
                 Smallest feasible reactor: 100 tons, 1 MW

AFR (the ideal): Fuel is either lithium-7 or (ideally) helium-3
                 Waste is helium
                 Reactions are: p+7Li=2alphas, 2x3He=alpha+2p NO NEUTRONS!
                 Extremely difficult to build and run
                 Fuel is somewhat costly but harmless by itself
                 Waste is clean and harmless
                 Containment vessel never gets "hot"
                 Cannot be used to make bomb-grade materials of any sort
                 Cannot runaway, explode or melt down
                 Theoretical limit of efficiency: 100% (85-90% easy)
                 NO SHIELDING NECESSARY, NO RADIATION HAZARD
                 Power yield per ton: 1 MW
                 Smallest feasible reactor: 1 ton, 1 MW 

By "feasible" that means economically feasible for a TL 8 economy. Helium-3
is one tenth the cost of Uranium, and one kilogram-equivalent of the stuff
would give power equal to that obtained by burning 100 metric tons of refined
fuel oil. If we extrapolate efficiency increases and shrinking lower limits,
we get down to the manpack fusion piles of TL 13 and up. They\'re cheap to run,
environmentally safe, don\'t make a mess, tremendously efficient, and are 
perfect for civilian use because they can\'t be converted to weaponmaking.
Not bad, eh? So what\'s the catch? Simple: they require operating conditions
an order of magnitude more difficult than the ones Princeton\'s been trying
to reach for decades now. But with grav plates, it might be possible.

What would this mean in Traveller terms? Well, power plants would become tiny
and power worries would vanish; wilderness refueling would become impossible
under most circumstances (or can you get helium from a gas giant?); refined
fuel would be a lot less dangerous (liquid helium can\'t explode) but more 
costly (liquid helium is tough to keep liquid), and there wouldn\'t be any such
thing as unrefined fuel any more. And other game-balance-altering effects as
well, but those will do for a start. (No, they won\'t be put in TDR if i can
help it: the rules are enough of a mess as it is.)

Just a little something to chew on for those of you who wanted to see what an
"Advanced" culture would do for power (assuming we don\'t discover dilithium
crystals and antimatter any time soon)....

PS.  Note the power plant efficiency: 1 MW for 100 tons weight for fusion,
unless i got my numbers crossed. How\'s that compare with the rules?

submissions.  This article details the archive structure, criteria for
acceptance, and some future plans.

The archive will be divided into directories, based on subject matter.
Material in each directory will directly pertain to a specific aspect
of game rules.  The initial directories are as follows:

    TDR/admin          - Transaction affecting the TDR development process
                         itself; this catagory will NOT be used frequently.
    TDR/char_gen       - New rules for character generation.
    TDR/char_classes   - New character classes: including both basic and
                         extended character generation.
    TDR/char_skills    - New skill sets for characters, which conform to
                         the new character generation rules.  May also
                         include mechanisms for defining new skills not
                         already listed.
    TDR/combat         - New combat rules (personal, mass troop, vehicle-
                         to-vehicle, and space combat).
    TDR/mail_archive   - Month-by-month archives of E-mail between submitters
                         and the TDR Administrator or the TDR Archivist.
    TDR/misc           - Anything that doesn\'t fit into one of the other
                         specific catagories.
    TDR/physics        - Rationales for the physical behavior detailed in
                         the above rules.
    TDR/task_rules     - New rules for resolving non-combat related tasks
                         within the framework of a TDR game.
    TDR/trade_commerce - New trade & commerce rules.
    TDR/vehicle_design - New rules for designing ALL vehicles.  This covers
                         all vehicle forms: land, water, air, and space.
    TDR/vehicle_lists  - New vehicles designed according to the new rules.
    TDR/weapons        - New weapons (or modified existing ones) which conform
                         to the new combat rules.

I will accept any complete rule set (or complete draft) which fits into one
of the above catagories.  I will also accept additions and/or modifications
to rules sets which have already been archived.  I will AUTOMATICALLY reject
any submissions that consist of only general discussion about a particular
aspect of rule development or WIBNI ("Wouldn\'t it be nice if...") letters.
This type of dialogue should remain within the confines of the TML.  Only
submissions of specific rules should be sent to the archive.  I will also
REJECT any rule set sent in piecemeal.  Submissions must be complete packages
which contain sufficient breadth to deal with the subject matter (character
creation, combat, etc.) in it\'s entirety.

Requests for the addition of a new rules subdivision (i.e.  a request for 
a new catagory for rules on alien race creation) may be submitted to the
archive.  They will be forwarded to and reviewed by TDR administration.
If the request seems reasonable, a new catagory will be added to the
archive and an announcement will be made via the TML.

When you make a submission, remember two points.  First, plain ASCII only,
no special formatting languages.  I will automatically discard anything
which violates this requirement, regardless of the merit of the actual
submission.  Second, be sure to preface the submission with a synopsis.
If the submission is long, I may not have the time read it in it\'s entirety
to determine where it should be filed in the archive.  If I\'m in a hurry,
and I can\'t decide where it belongs, it may end up filed in the TDR/misc
directory and forgotten.  You are thus forwarned.

I will make a \'best attempt\' to responde to any questions regarding the
archive, especially those which only require a short answer.  I would
prefer to deal with E-mail only, but for those of you who what more immediate
feedback, I can be reached at (503) 750-2949 from 8 AM - 5 PM weekdays, and
(503) 754-1605 evenings and weekends after 10 AM Pacific time.

Within the next month or two, I will be announcing a \'standard format\' for
all vehicle submissions (once a draft set of design rules are in place),
which will lend itself to bursting.  This will allow faster seach and
retrieval from the archive.

Cardinal Rules -

1) Always check your math -

2) Always "think" about your answer (does it make sense) -

3) Never ASSUME that YOU no longer NEED to do 1 and 2 above -

SORRY!!!  Lunch and physics (number crunch) don\'t mix.  As several of
you were quick to point out there was a GROSS error (to say the least)
in my calculation of the amount of energy released by the fusion of 1
ton of hydrogen to helium.  (In my defense - several of you who pointed
out the error did not get it right either!)  CAREFUL calculation indicates
that the amount of mass converted during the fusion of 1 ton of H to He is
about 7.1 kg or about 6.40 E17 Joules (big difference)!  The remaining 
calculations were correct and assuming 100% efficiency you would need about
1.1 kg of Hydrogen to power the ship for 1 hour.

DID YOU EVER HAVE ONE OF THOSE DAYS...As if the above wasn\'t enough.  I
pointed out that assuming a straight line flight path was incorrect. 
That is true.  I said it was inefficient (extremely).  That is also true.
Rob Dean pointed out that the wasted energy is insignificant.  In the
Traveller time frame that is true as well.  The point was the assumption
of a straight line flight path was incorrect.  I IMPLIED that if we were
to fix this problem in-system travel time might become unacceptably long.
This is not correct.  Some quick calculations (yes, I know but I checked
them carefully this time, honest!) show that the difference between a
straight line flight path and a correctly curved flight path for a powered
vehicle would NOT be sufficiently different to justify the worry.  

The point I was trying to make was that some physics problems need to
be fixed, some can be fix, some can\'t be fixed, and some shouldn\'t be
fixed.  I simply picked a bad example.

Changing gears now...Jim Baranski says:
>Has anyone considered fusion other elements, or fusing multiple elements
>at high TL?

In stars at least, H fusion is easier (requires lower temperatures) and
(if I remember correctly) generates more available energy.  Stars can
pass through several buring stages: Hydrogen to Helium, Helium to Carbon,
(its been a while but I think the next couple reactions are) Carbon to
Oxygen, Oxygen to Silicon, and lastly Silicon to Iron.  Fusion reactions
beyond Iron *use* energy.  Similarly fision reaction produce less energy
(in general) as you go down toward Iron.  Iron is the most stable element.
Point is - Hydrogen is VERY abundant, the easiest to fuse, and yields the
best energy returns why use anything else?

Robert P Poole says:
>All FTL drive systems that rely on taking a ship out of our space-time
>and plopping it temproarily in some "hyperspace" or "jump space" are
>going to violate relativity.

Bear in mind this all off the top of my head.  If I get time I will look
into this further but ... first the ship accelerates to near light speed
special relativity does not apply.  Special relativity deals only with
constant velocities - no forces, flat space.  Second if the jump drive
takes the ship "out of our universe" into another (higher?) dimension
then even general relativity is not binding - ie it *can not* predict
what will happen.  Moreover, upon leaving our universe you break contact
with all mundane space reference frames.  Traveller says that if you
jump out to a point in space it takes 1 week (120 - 200 hours).  If you
jump back *immediately* it takes 1 week (both are from your point of
view).  If you ask a passerby how long have you been gone he will say
"Two weeks".  What ever physics governs the transfer to jump space and
the time in jump space obviously "fixes" causality!  Incidentally there
is some debate (as I recall) as to whether causality must not be violated.
Also consider worm holes which can exist within general relativity.  They
allow EM radiation to travel at FTL speeds.  I don\'t remember the various
consequences or restrictions.

Lastly Iain Fogg says:
>On a related note, how do you handle customs in your campaign.

In my games, patrol boats monitor the ships around the planets to watch
for those that would try to land at places other than the Starports so
presumably to avoid customs inspectors.  Much as the Coast Guard does
for US coastlines.  At the Starport, all ships are routinely boarded and
inspected for contraband or their goods are taken to bonded areas and
identified as having not been approved.  The goods can then be inspected
later. 

As for individuals, they *may* have luggage searched like in International
Airports and usually have to show ID Papers.  They also pass through
metal + ??? detectors which will pick up any weapons.  In my game, all
*legally* obtained weapons can be detected because the Imperium requires
that this be the case (in the same way all plastic explosive made in the
US can be detected because the gov. tells the makers to make it that way).

Generally I simply assume this is being done with character consent unless
they are trying to smuggle something or I want to cause trouble then I
role play the customs.  As for patrol boats stopping character\'s ship, I
do it from time to time - "random safty inspection" or the like.

Whoops. Red-face time from the nuclear physicist who hasn\'t done nuclear
ASTROPHYSICS lately.... I\'d forgotten the proton-proton chain, so don\'t
waste time correcting me, OK? However, deuteron-triton fusion is immensely
easier to get working in terms of favorable fusion conditions, and if the
reactors using deuterons in Trav are as inefficient as the rules say they are
then you can kiss proton-proton fusion goodbye. Unless we postulate that the
Trav reactors ARE proton-proton reactors ALREADY, which would be stupid
considering that at a TL where a crummy proton-proton reactor would work, a
combination deuteron-deuteron reactor and hydrogen enricher would be orders
of magnitude more efficient, and a helium-3 reactor would be easier still
and cleaner and more efficent and---- you get the idea.

A few thoughts...

On fusing hydrogen...I\'m not sure we need an exotic process as much as
we need a LOT of heat and pressure, which advanced technology might be
able to provide.  Why develop this when you\'ve got lots of deuterium
(one percent of one percent of the UNIVERSE is deuterium)?  Because 
hydrogen is 73 percent of the universe.  

(I could be wrong on this, but I don\'t think the sun does much more
than provide a LOT of heat and pressure to get is hydrogen to fuse...
I vaguely remember hearing somewhere that this is a very slow process
compared to other fusion reactions and that might be why it would be
less than profitable.)

By the way, does anyone know anything about what would be involved
with designing a fusion transmutation plant?  The idea is simple...if
you have a lot of hydrogen, but very little silicon or aluminum, or
anything else under the element 26 line, and you have practical fusion
power, you should be able to simply fuse the stuff up until you have
what you want.  Okay, okay, I know it has got to be a LOT more com-
plicated than that.  That\'s what I\'m asking...what would be involved
in this kind of operation?  Could it be done in the first place (it
sounds like it should work, but there may be some aspect of physics
that I don\'t know about that would make it impractical or even
impossible)?

As for the speed of light stuff...

I don\'t really care much for game purposes.  I just assume that we
manage to find a way around the speed of light limit (I actually do
not use Jump Drives, but assume that spacecraft can transfer between
solar systems using Stargates, like the ones in 2001, and it is an
instantaneous deal; I find this more plausible, although I\'m sure
people will disagree with me on this).

Of course, if it really does bother you, but you want to run an
sf game, and use something like the Traveller system, I will recommend    
an alternative scenario.  I\'m using something like it as the background
for the sf I write, which I fear is trash, but you might see the novel
in 1992 or 1993 if I ever get it finished and if anyone is silly enough
to buy the damn thing.  Build on the following assumptions and see
what you get...

1) Faster than light travel is impossible.
2) Slower than light travel up to 1% the speed of light is easy with
  spacecraft using fusion drives (and much faster ships, usually used
  for interstellar colonization, can be built using matter-antimatter
  or laser-propelled lightsails, but this is a more complicated
  process)
3) Space industrialization becomes common.  People discover that it
  is not difficult to built million-person habitats massing 75 billion
  tons (more or less) from common materials found in asteroids and
  the moons of major planets.  In addition, these habitats are roomy
  and pleasant (if necessary, they could support a lot more people than
  just one million), being cylinder habitats about 10 km. by 40 km.
4) It takes about one trillion tons of raw materials to build a 75-
  billion ton, million-person habitat.  
5) The available mass in the asteroid belt of an average solar system
  is about two quintillion tons (2 x 10 to the 18th power).  Far more
  mass is available from any large moon.  Silicon, common in these bodies,
  can be used for solar panels (the mass listed includes panels that
  will provide sunlight and one megawatt per person out to the orbit of
  Saturn, or an equivilent), so you do not even have to use up hydrogen
  for fusion power.
6) It may take about nine hundred years for a colonial population of
  one million to expand in a virgin solar system until its population,
  now in the billions, can send out its own colonies.  Colony ships
  are built for speed, and can cross 10 light years in only one century.
  Thus, the rate of expansion for humanity is one percent the speed
  of light...ten light years every ten centuries.

7) If we do not meet nonhumans in space, we can make our own through
  genetic engineering, uplifting of nonsophont species, etc.  (See 
  Bruce Sterling and David Brin for interesting ideas.)

8) Fusion driven spacecraft can cross a solar system in weeks, meaning
  that a solar system starts to resemble the world in the days of sailing
  ships in terms of how quickly people can move from one habitat to
  another.  The cometary halo becomes the haven of all kinds of craziness
  because no one can patrol an area that extends out to a light year or
  more when your best ships can only move at a tenth of the speed of
  light, or maybe a little faster.  (And there are more than a trillion
  cometary nuclei...tons and tons and tons of raw materials, including
  hydrogen for fusion power...in a cometary halo.)

9) There are more than one million solar systems within a five hundred
 lightyear radius (which might be reached by colony ships in fifty
 thousand years) of Sol system.

Think about what human society and humanity might be like in fifty
thousand years if all this is true.  In particular, keep in mind that
even if you are limited to one solar system (except when you want to
start a new campaign by sending your players off to a new system in
suspended animation) that one solar system, if you really develop its
possibilities, is a pretty big place.  Enjoy.

I am not a nuclear physicist but an astrophysicist and as such should
point out that deuterium+deuterium is not a primary reaction in the sun.
The level of deuterium is kept depleted by interactions with hydrogen
(protons) forming helium-3 (+gamma).  In low temp stars this is the end
product of fusion.  In slightly higher temp stars He-3 + He-3 -> He-4 + 2H
also occurs however note that NONE of these reactions release neutrons like
the D+D reaction!  At about 2E7 K a whole slew of additional reactions
become possible all still falling under the title of p-p chain nuclear
fusion.  None of those release neutrons either.

Here on Earth the D+D and D+T reactions are used because they are better
reactions for fusion technology at our TL and we can use whatever material
we like (as opposed to what is available).  And you are right they DO give
off neutrons.

Perhaps a better fuel choice at the TL of Traveller would be D+p which is
fairly easy to do but has a relatively low energy yield (about the same
as D+D and about 1/3 D+T) or Li-7 + p or B-8 + positron both of which
have large energy yields (3-4 time D+p).  Bear in mind these numbers are
for conditions *inside* a star ie high temp, high pressure, high density,
plasma reactions.  Needless to say, ground (ship) based reactors will
work differently but not that differently.  Think of the breakthroughs
in EM containment fields or laser ignition systems.  And, hey, let\'s not
rule out various forms of cold fusion!

Robert P Poole says:

Two things: First we detected neutrinos from 1987a (the supernova) from
distances much larger then the ranges given for the neutrino detectors in
Traveller (of course there were a hell of a lot of neutrinos coming out
of 1987a).   Second the detection technology will have improved greatly by
that TL (they not running around with large vats of cleaning fluid after
all) so more of the neutrinos that are detectable will be detected.

A different issue (referencing both of the above) if you choose the 
"correct" fusion chain then you can use reactions that do not emit neutrinos
thus rendering your power plants "invisible" to neutrino detectors!  Which
brings up a different point - if Traveller says that neutrino detectors
can detect power plants (because of the fusion presumably) then they must
be using reactions that give off neutrinos rendering our arguments mute
unless we want to remove the utility of neutrino detectors from the game
(which I don\'t).  That is the use of the neutrino detectors isn\'t it?

Gravity for stopping lasers?  This would work for missles, maybe, via tidal
effects, but not lasers.  The G-field would provide a doppler shift to the
shorter wavelengths, *INCREASING* the destructive energy applied to your hull.
This is exactly the opposite of what you want.

About neutrinos:  Yeah, so we detected neutrinos from a distant supernova.  But
think about how much energy that supernova generated.  It goes without saying
that even though a supernova is distant, it also puts out a lot more neutrinos
in a few seconds than most starts put out in many, many years.

As I recall, the neutrino detectors in Traveller are there for detecting enemy
ships in combat, the idea being that you can home in on the fusion plant of the
enemy ship which is bound to produce neutrinos.

It seems to me that these neutrino detectors are probably going to be sensitive
to the flavor of the neutrino, i.e., whether it is a mu-neutrino or an electron
neutrino, and will either react or not depending.  With flavor mixing falling
out of theoretical quantum mechanics, we could be seeing a significant decrease
in detection at distances on the order of 1 AU.

About FTL:  I\'ve heard the argument before that "if it ain\'t in this universe,
we can\'t know what laws apply to it."  The SR reverse time travel result falls
out of the discontinuity which permits superluminal propagation.  I am pretty
sure of my sources.  Apparently, the method has nothing to do with it, it\'s
strictly the fact that there is a propagation from point A to point B faster
than a photon could do it that gives the time travel result.

Note I am not talking about wormholes, which are weird animals.  But it is also
a "known fact" that causality can be violated inside wormholes.  So, the only
question I have is, who wants to get the electrons stripped of his atoms first?

which mines silver came from by the distribution of the isotopes of the trace

All these different Fusion reactions are *real* interesting, and it would be
nice to have someone summarize them as library data, but I don\'t think it\'s
necessary to get into this detail in TDR RULES.  As far as the rules go, we can
just pick a fusion reaction which fits nicely as the reaction commonly used in
TDR, and allow powerplant TL differences to indicate the different fusion
techniques, and perhaps pick different fusion reactions for different TLs.

And I can have an adventure about a secret research station working on a
neutrinoless reactor!

"Point is - Hydrogen is VERY abundant, the easiest to fuse, and yields the
best energy returns why use anything else?"

Well, I don\'t know anything about fusion physics, so I\'m speaking from
ignorance.  I\'m assuming that there might be other fusion reactions which might
have advantages other then generic H.

But then, metlay is saying helium-3 is a more efficient reaction, and you\'re
saying hydrogen gives more energy???  which is it?

As far as FTL causing causual problems...  I just don\'t see it, and don\'t care
about it in game.

I always wondered what refined and unrefined fuel meant.  I never did
understand how you could have fusion reactors, some of which operated on
unrefined fuel,and some which operated on refined fuel.  For that matter, I\'ve
always given my ships refineries or unrefined fuel reactors.  I guess the
current discussion indicates that refined fuel is D, and unrefined is H???

So what does everyone think of the MT combat system?  I haven\'t used it much
(I am only now setting up a group of semi-regular players) but it looks...
cumbersome.  Is it?  The part that looks awkward is the interupts.  You have
two groups the playes and the NPC\'s:  P1 wants to move 4 squares N1 interupts
P1 and P2 interupts N1 so P2 goes then N1 goes then P1 moves another square
and the whole thing starts over!  I am doing this right aren\'t I?  Is this
system as messy to use as it looks?

I like the concept of the interupt that is being able to shoot at someone
who is ducking from cover to cover.  This is a fault in games that have 
everyone move then everyone shoots.  What if we used a system something like
Twilight:2000.  Everyone acts on their dex rank (dex/3 round up).  On dex
rank 5 all the fives go - move or shoot on rank 4 the fours and the fives go
and so on till one where everyone goes.  There is a list of possible actions
that you can do during a dex rank and everything in a dex rank occurs at
the same time.  Weapons may need a rate of fire (ie 1/dex rank or 1/2 dex
ranks or 2/dex rank etc).  If one side has surprise then only that side gets
to go.  If you do the same thing every dex rank (declare at the beginning-
no changes during the round) then you go every dex rank regardless of your
dex rank rating.  This would allow "slow" character to lay down cover or
suppressing fire for faster characters by firing every dex rank.

If this sound interesting AND if MT combat is really as messy as it looks
would anyone be interested in seeing a complete and compatible write up
of this system?  I think it should be easy to take from Twilight.  The games
are similar in some ways.  In fact 2ed. Twilight uses a task system that
appears to be similar to MT but I\'m not sure as I don\'t have a copy of 2ed.
only 1ed.  Can anyone with a copy of 2ed Twilight comment on that as well?

Combat is the part of the game that I like the best.  I would like to find
a good, "realistic" (careful-my definition of realistic may vary from 
yours :-) ), and yet quick and easy combat system to use.  One that doesn\'t
bog down play with tons of charts and tables and dice rolls but still adds
some realism (like hit location).  I also find it difficult to go from
hand-to-hand to melee to gun fire with one system.  Does anyone else have
this problem?

If you don\'t think the Twilight combat system is a good idea I am open to
suggestions.

         1          2                   (with a 7% mass decrease)

  The sun continuously shines because of this nuclear fusion.  However
from a small power station on earth (by contrast to the giant sun) the
fusion energy released cannot be obtained because of the very low reaction
rate.\'\'

This reaction has a slow rate (10e-24 of the ``cross-section\'\' of the
Deuterium-Deuterium reaction) because of the small chance of a colliding
proton decaying into a neutron + positron + neutrino.   But maybe Traveller
fuel plants could use this reaction with the aid of a nuclear damper in decay
rate increase mode ?

Keishiro then goes on to describe three ``generations\'\' of fusion reaction
(each requiring higher temperatures).

1st Generation:
``      2    3     4     1 
         D +  T =   He +  n   + 17.6MeV
        1    1     2     0
has the greatest possibility of being utilised.\'\'

``The half life of T is 12 years so none exists naturally.\'\'
But it can be synthesised as an intermediate stage of
        6    2     4
         Li + D = 2 He + 22.4 MeV
        3    1     2

[Lithium has never been mentioned in conjunction with trav plants, so scratch
this one].

2nd generation:
``Hydrogen found on earth includes Deuterium in the mass ratio of 1:5000\'\'

                   3     1
                    He + n + 3.27MeV
                   2     0
        2    2  
         D +  D =     OR [with about even probability]
        1    1
                   3    1
                    T  + H  + 4.03MeV
                   1    1

``An oilcan full of heavy water will supply enough energy to run a car for a
lifetime if the car has a fusion engine.\'\'

Yup !  Looks like Trav fusion engines are massively inefficient.
This reaction also outputs neutron radiation and the evil radioactive hydrogen
isotope tritium: half life 12 years, diffuses through anything, gets into
water, organic compounds, YOU!

3rd generation reactions:
``
        1    11       4
         H +   B  =  3 He + 8.7MeV
        1     5       2

        1     6       3    4
         H +   Li =    He + He + 4.0MeV
        1     3       2     2
\'\'
Nice because it outputs nothing but helium (but requires Lithium and/or
Boron again, so forget this one for Trav).


Effieciency of Trav power plants
- - ----
The prescence of neutrino detectors in MegaTrav, and the fact that 1 ton of
gas giant atmosphere from your refuelling shuttle can be refined
into 1 ton of fuel, not just 0.2kg of Deuterium, is strong evidence that the
proton-proton reaction is somehow used in Trav power plants.
The reactor will probably incorporate sort of weak-interaction rate
increaser (a nuclear damper related device or other handwaving).

1MeV = 1.6e-13 Joules

Avogadro\'s Number: 6e23 per mole

          1 2
1 Mole of  H  weighs 0.002kg
          1

          1 2
1 Mole of  H  releases 0.5 * 6*10^23 * 27.05*1.6*10^-13 = 1.3*10^12 J
          1            

          1 2
1 Ton of   H  releases 1000/0.002 * above = 6.6*10^17 J
          1

Striker
- - ----
  A TL15 fusion plant outputs 6MW, using 1.5l/hour fuel.
  1l fuel weighs 0.07kg = 7*10^-5 tons.
  Energy out (according to book) = 6*10^6 * 3600             = 2.2*10^10 J
  Energy out if 100% efficient   = 1.5 * 7*10^-5 * 6.6*10^17 = 6.9*10^13 J
  => Efficiency 0.032%    (about 0.01% at TL9).

MegaTraveller
- - ----
  A (large enough) TL15 reactor outputs 18MW using 9l/hour.
  This is 3 times as much as a Striker reactor, but needs 6 times as much fuel
  => Efficiency 0.016%

TL16 plants are marginally better.  And then at TL17 antimatter plants appear
(Hmm... wonder why there aren\'t many TL17 planets around :^)

If Trav plants were using the D-D reaction, they would be 7.4 times
more efficient... about 0.25%.

You can think of any number of excuses for poor inefficiency.  Just how
do you extract useable energy from a fusion reactor anyway ?  Apparently it is
somehow theoretically possible to extract electric current directly; this would
be so useful you might not be too bothered about efficiency.
Current power stations need huge amounts of cooling water.  Can you radiate
off waste heat fast enough from a small starship ?  Possibly the vast majority
of the fuel (99.984%) is just vented off as cooling.

It\'s a shame there isn\'t a bit more variety in Trav fusion plants over the 
tech levels, especially considering that low tech chemical fuel power plants
about double in efficiency every two tech levels.

PS Orca\'s original 0.0000002% was based on H-H fusion being 4*10^6 times better
than it really is due to c being wrong, and the calculated energy release
should have been per 4 moles of H, which corrects it to  0.8% efficiency.
Where did you get the amount of fuel used from ?  Are maneuver drives more
efficient than power plants ?

Well, perhaps everything isn\'t exactly real-world scientific (like, let\'s
not get into physics flaming!) but you remember the Einstein experiment
that involved watching the sun eclipse a star, and they proved that gravity
had an effect on photons ... well ... the idea here is just to stop the
laser hitting properly - anything that deflects it by even a small amount
is good, as lasers have to hit parallel to a surface to do the most
damage.

Basically, the shields throw such a huge spanner in the works that if
they don\'t totally negate incoming weapons, they at least screw up the
aiming, detonation and so on ...

(Mind you, that\'s AOK for 1/2 man fighters, but how do they protect
 the Leviathan ships ? They\'re several kilometers long ... Hmmm ...)

Subject: Open question to the TML
Organization: personal mailbox at The Next Challenge
 
I\'ve been passing along the TML to Scott Kellogg, so he\'s been
seeing your responses to my recient posting of his ship designs.
(Albeit with a time lagg.) Well he\'s been busy again and I have
about 58k worth of them. Scott has been running his own campaign
and has dropped our characters down on a planet that is essentially
in the middle of World War II, at least as far as technology is
concerned. After taking a fighter in the ship\'s bow, (the tail is
still sticking out of the hole right now!), I get the feeling we\'ll
be here for a while. In this new bunch of designs Scott has re-
created some of the craft of WWII TL\'s.
 
My question to the TML, (considering the problems from my last
massive posting of Scott\'s stuff), is does anyone mind/object?
Here\'s a listing and brief description of what I\'ve got waiting;
 
****************************************************************
 
Ballistic Missile Sub TL8 "Typhoon" Class "Red October" subclass
     Meant to simulate either the book or movie version.
 
Attack Submarine TL8 "Alfa" Class
     "Alfa" class attack sub is featured in \'The Hunt for Red
     October\'
 
Heavy Cruiser TL 15 "Atlantic" Class
     "Atlantic" class heavy cruiser typical of the Imperium
 
System Defence Drone TL 15 "Watcher" Class
     Used by Imperial Navy and Scout forces the \'Watcher\' series
     is usually deployed from an Air/Raft bay. Four \'Watcher\'s can
     be stored in a bay. With its fuel scoops it can spend up to
     a year inside a gas giant\'s atmosphere or submerged in an
     ocean before requireing maintenance.
 
Reconaissance Drone TL 15 "Lurker" Class
     A TL 15 smart weapon. The \'Lurker\' is used primarily by
     Imperial ground forces. The Army and Marines use it for
     patrols, guard duty, harrassment raids as well as systematic
     search and destroy missions. 
 
Patrol Submarine TL6 "Gato" Class
     This is the Fleet Type sub from the Pacific theater of WWII.
     Don\'t you hate it when players drop in on your nice little low
     tech planet and proceed to loot, kill and maim and you don\'t
     have anything to throw at them?  Just wait till they try to
     refuel...
 
Dreadnaught TL 15, "Kokirrak" Class
     "The \'Kokirrak\' class dreadnaught is one of the more common
     classes of capitol ships in service in the Spinward Marches;
 
Attack Submarine TL8 "Los Angeles" Class
     The US Navy\'s big attack sub. It is the early version, before
     the fitting of 12 verticle launch tubes for Tomahawk missiles.
 
Fleet Escort TL 15 "P.F. Sloan" Class
     "The \'P.F. Sloan\' Class fleet escort is intended for routine
     fleet security and support.
 
Dreadnaught TL 15, "Plankwell" Class
     "Plankwell" class dreadnaught a more specialized ship than
     the multi-task oriented \'Tigress\' class. Lacking the extensive
     troop complement and the large fighter screen, the "Plankwell"
     fulfills a more traditional battleship role, as the center of
     a fleet of supporting ships.
 
Darrian Fixed Wing Air/Raft TL13 "Saab" Class
     The \'Saab\' is renouned as the safest air/raft in operation.
 
Fast Cutter TL 15 "Sparrow" Class
     The \'Sparrow\' class cutter is designed for use as an auxillury
     by warships.
 
Heavy Fighter TL 15 "Talon" Class
     The \'Talon\' class fighter is commonly carried aboard heavy
     carriers and other naval vessels.  Occasionally, a ship which
     does not ordinarily carry fighters will substitute a \'Talon\'
     for one of its launches. 
 
Light Tanker TL11 "Cow" Class
     The \'Cow\' class tankers were concieved as a supplement to
     \'Wolf\' operations.  A \'Cow\' can easily support two \'Wolves\'.
     More often it is called upon to support more by making
     multiple fuel runs.
 
Tanker TL11 7-11 Series
     In order to use the heavy firepower of the \'Wolf\' carriers,
     they travel in large numbers. Fleets of one hundred to one
     thousand \'Wolves\' are common. These fleets are supported by
     large numbers of \'7-11\' series tankers.
 
Light Intruder TL 15 "Fox" Class
     The \'Thunder Fox\' class light intruder is the Imperial Navy\'s
     equivalent of the attack sub.
 
Light Intruder TL 15 "Thunder" Class
     Fuctions as squadron coordinator and houses the squadron\'s
     black globe.
 
Dreadnaught TL 15, "Tigress" Class
     Although some older battleships of greater displacement remain
     in service, the \'Tigress\' class dreadnaught is the largest
     line-of-battle vessel currently in service with the Imperial
     Navy in the Spinward Marches.
 
****************************************************************
 
Is there interest for these designs? Unless I get a lot of
objections I\'ll wait three days and post Scott\'s stuff in small
amounts to keep from swamping the list again.

For those who dont remember, the Alcyon is a jump tender, a tetrahedron
with three riders and a bridge up front.  I sure wish I remembered the
formula, but alas do not.

Other small vehicles I recall are two grav bikes, an air raft, and grav
bus, and a submersible.  There are also small craft that might be
carried by the Aurora, Paladin, and Talisman.

    'body' => 'Back in grade school and high school in the late 60s/early 70s, there
was a common poster in science classrooms that gave data on various
sorts of reaction drives.

I remember the figures for a few sorts of drives (all figures to one
significant figure)
drive			specific impulse
chemical		400 (shuttle main engines are about 420)
"nuclear heating"	800 (Heinlein\'s ships using "single H")
fusion			600,000
photon			30,000,000

Specific impulse is (roughly) defined as pounds of fuel per second per
pound of thrust. Or you could use kilos, or tons. (Yes, I know that we
are mixing mass units with force units, that\'s the way it\'s done)

When I first bought Traveller I checked, and found a comment that
stated that a ship running at 1g on maneuver drive would have about a
weeks fuel. I worked out the specfic impulse, and it came out very
close to 600,000. I guess they read the same chart. Note that a Saturn
V (6 million pounds thrust) would only need 10 lbs per second of fuel
if it used a fusion drive. 

This makes calculations *very* easy. And note that for a manuever
drive, the "inefficiency" is because you *have* to throw away a lot of
the fuel as reaction mass.

Also, note that the exhaust plume is *very* hot. Probably glowing in
the ultraviolet! You\'d see it as this incredible purple color. And
"tailgating" isn\'t advised. And landing will tend to burn holes in
*anything*. 

The *basic* rocketry equations are quite simple, though you can mostly
ignore them for a fusion drive as the mass ratios become so low, that
you can ignore them for most manuevers. 

Finally, a photon drive, is nothing more than one *hell* of a laser. 
I
would be like. You could easily use it for carving *planets* into
chunks!

Oh yes, with the scale of fusion they have in Traveller, you don\'t
*need* transmutation. Just convert rock, asteroids, *garbage* into a
plasma. At a high (but not unreasonably so, compared with some of the
fusion reactions discussed here) temperature, *all* chemical bonds
fail. So you can run the plasma thru what amounts to a overgrown mass
spectrograph, and seperate out not just pure elements, but likely pure
*isotopes*. And after the capital costs, it\'d be cheap to operate. 
Store "junk" elements as convenient compounds (like silicon dioxide) 
and use the rest. So what if gold is only a few parts per million? 
Guess how much that adds up to from even a *small* asteroid.

student specializing in stellar astrophysics.)

The fusion debate on TML has been going on for a while now and
most of the arguments have been factual, but I think many of
the posters have been presenting facts without thinking about
what they want to say.  The important question to address is:
How should powerplants work in TDR.  We can decide on what 
sort of energy efficiency we want and then figure out how the
power plants work (and fudge them to make them work out right,
this is what GDW did, but not terribly well) *or* we can figure
out how the power plants are going to work and let our game
mechanics be decided by whatever ramifications the physics has.
I favor the latter.  It\'s no more work and it\'s more realistic.
The disadvantage is that it would make TDR look less like the
familiar Traveller.  It is apparent that Metlay, Dow and some
of the others on this net have become aware that Traveller Done
Right may have very little resemblence to Traveller.  

First off, let\'s assume that a ship\'s power plant uses D+D for
its reaction.  Now we fudge fuel requirements for various things
to give space and weight figures that we like.  There are some
things that we can\'t fudge, though.  First, fuel skimming.  Since
about 1% (from memory) of natural Hydrogen is Deuterium, skimming
for fuel will now take 100 times longer than it used to (how long
it would take using a p+p cycle, to my knowledge, has never been
stated authoritatively.)  Note that if a majority of fuel intake
is used for reaction mass, this isn\'t a problem.  We could have 
power plants use p+p and then skimming is still viable.  Then we 
must have rules for "supercharging" the engine using higher 
concentrations of Deuterium.  We could also use one of the higher 
level fusion methods Metlay suggested, but that would prevent skimming 
altogether.  I think the first option is best.  In any case, we 
calculate energy conversion (and mass loss using fuel as reaction 
mass, regular Hydrogen could be used for this.)

>From the choice of power system, many things have been decided for
us.  Can neutrino detectors work?  Well, that depends on what type
of fusion reaction is used (as an occasional twist, specialized
ships might be built using a different fusion change.)  The important
thing (and this will go for computers, maneuver drives, jump drives,
screens, and weapons too!) is to decide how something will work,
figure out the consequences and if we don\'t like the consequences,
start over having the system work a different way.  Note that
the "committee" method is especially unsuited to this as people\'s
opinions on which way things work will differ.  I say since its 
Metlay is in charge he can decide.  Since he also knows what he\'s
doing with game mechanics and physics, he can figure out the 
consequences.  Of course this has him doing all the work, but that\'s
what I had said earlier.  Any serious game designer knows that
you have to do all the hard work by yourself.

Oh, as a note to the person who asked (if they had the endurance
to read this far:-), we can expect Deuterium concentrations on 
earth to be roughtly the same elsewhere in the galaxy.  Any excess
Deuterium created in the p+p process gets eaten up quickly
in a D+p reaction that has a much, much higher cross section than
p+p.  The 1% D rule can be expected to hold true just about everywhere.

Quick reality check here; just how strong a gravitational field do you need
to have any useful effect on an incoming laser beam?  What effect is such a
field going to have on any mass in the vicinity?

    'body' => 'I\'ve been reading quit a bit about TDR on the TML here.  I\'m all in
favor of it, and I\'d like to submit a few ideas of my own.
 
 
TDR FORMAT:
 
First, I like the idea that it will be distributed in ASCII.  This will
allow anybody with a computer to be able to format the text as they
desire.  This will also make it easy for someone to modify the rules,
and still have them neatly printed and bound, if desired.
 
 
WEAPON MAINTENANCE:
 
Several people have also been discussing the extent of the maintenance
a player can perform on a weapon with only skill in that weapon.  With
today\'s weapons, a soldier can fix a problem with his weapon 90-95% of
the time.  This would include replacement of most parts.  The rest of
the time he turns it over to the unit armorer, who should be able to
fix the problem in less than an hour, given the right tools and parts.
I would imagine that a few special wrenches might be needed once in
awhile, but other than that, most of the tools needed would be
available in any hardware store.  I realize that I\'m talking about
weapons that rely on exploding gasses here, but I think a lot of this
would apply to energy weapons, too, or else armorers in units with
man-portable energy weapons would be overloaded with things to do.  A
good guideline for weapon-skill-only maintenance might be this: If it
needs something more complicated than a screwdriver, see the armorer.
For energy weapons, a simple multimeter might also be allowed for WSO
repairs.  Also keep in mind that as the TL of the weapons increases,
the average education of the man using them will tend to increase too.
 
Here might be a sample from FM 328-9401, "Maintenance for the M89
Fusion Gun, Man-Portable"  [The FGMP-15 to us].
 
Symptom: Excessive Recoil       [Remember that the FGMP-15 has a
                                 grav-compensated recoil absorbtion
                                 system]
 
Problem: Bad recoil compensation grav units.  Check resistance across
each recoil compensating grav unit.  If resistance across any of them
is less than 1000 ohms or greater than 5000 ohms, the unit is probably
shorted or burned out.  Replace the unit, and turn the defective one
into your armorer. [Only an ohmmeter and possibly a screwdriver is needed.]
 
Problem: Excessive power is sent to fusion chamber magnets.  Check
magnet power distribution module...... [you get the idea]
 
Anyone who knows the principles of operation behind a weapon should be
able to fix most problems.
 
 
MANEUVER DRIVES
 
I like the idea of reactionless drives, which probably implies
anti-gravity technology in one form or another.  With reaction drives,
the fuel requirements are so immense, and the endurance of the vessels
using them so short, in-system travel becomes difficult without using
jump drives.  I don\'t think this is any fun.  I think space travel in
traveller should be about as difficult as air travel today.  Besides, I
like the idea of a solid state drive.  I think there\'s a certain
elegance about a large ship slowly and silently lifting away from its
landing pad.
 
The system that _Striker_ used for grav vehicles seems quite workable,
and this could be easily extended to spacecraft.  Each grav module can
provide a maximum of n kilograms of thrust, and the designer adds
modules until the desired performance is reached.
 
When I used to referee, I told my players that each module generates a
virtual gravitional field, or VGF, and that on-board avionics can
control the module to put the VGF anywhere in relation to the module.
This would translate the pilot\'s commands to actual ship movements.
The VGFs would only act upon the modules themselves.  This would allow
different modules to have forces acting on them in different
directions, possibly producing a net torque on the spacecraft.  This
would eliminate the klugey solution of having a large gyroscope in the
middle of the craft.  See the diagram below.
 
 
      * - VGF            *
                        +----+
                       <     Ship    |
                        +----+
                                   *
 
In this diagram, the ship would rotate clockwise.  The 6G limitation
could be imposed by saying that grav modules can only be made so thin,
and power-supply frequencies have to be increased as the amount of
"thrust" is increased.  To eliminate large phase differences between
different parts of a grav array (array = bunch of modules) the modules
have to be made thinner and thinner as wavelengths decrease.  At 6G\'s,
they can\'t be made any thinner.  Agility can be described as using
extra energy to produce additional VGFs which would move the craft up,
down, or sideways while the biggest VGF would be moving the craft
sideways.
 
 
VEHICLE DESIGN
 
I think that TDR should have a vehicle design system that would apply
across the whole range of vehicle sizes- kind of like a "unified field
theory" of vehicle design.  Again, I think _Striker_ has the right
idea.  I like Striker\'s system because you know that the resultant
vehicle is x meters wide, y meters tall, and z meters long, unlike
MegaTraveller.  The designer would use the same rules for designing any
kind of vehicle, whether it was a motorcycle, grav tank, submarine, 100
ton merchant ship, or 100k ton dreadnaught.  In some circumstances, one
might pick the dimensions of the vehicle, and be given a formula for
picking armor, and determining the usable volume, like for aircraft.
 
Some examples of vehicles that I would hope to be able to apply such a
design system to:
 
Motorcycles
Passenger Cars
Civilian/Military Trucks
Aircraft (All types)
Water-borne vessels
Hovercraft
Grav Vehicles
Spaceplances
Spacecraft
Starships
 
COMBAT SYSTEM
 
I like the Azhanti High Lightning/Striker system of combat where
separate rolls to hit and penetrate are needed.  If a hit location
chart (arms/legs/torso/head) is added, the problem of taking cover is
resolved- if the part of the body hit is under cover, then figure in
the armor value of the cover when rolling the penetration.  This also
makes it easy to adjust for different ammo types in certain weapons
(like the ACR).
 
 
CHARACTER GENERATION
 
I like the character generation system as it now stands, but how about
adding a few new occupations in additions to Scouts, Marines, etc?
Suggestions: Police, Lawyer (useless in some campaigns, great for
others), Techie (a catch-all for electrical engineer/auto
mechanic/telephone repairman/computer programmer types).
 
 
I\'m interested in seeing what other have thought up for TDR, but
haven\'t seen any submissions yet.

The "Official" policy is that if 10% of the TML verbally/electronically
expresses a desire to see it, you can post it.  If there is significant
protest (equal or greater numbers), an alternate form of delivery needs
to be set up.  I think you are wise to test the waters before sending a
slew of designs out.

I will remind the TML that Vehicle designs are now automagically moved
to the end of every TML digest, so that people no longer need to wade
through them to find "conversational" messages.

I am getting ready to run a Trillion Credit Squadron campaign (I want to
generate my campaign political history) and have a few questions.

First, how are you doing tech level increases?  How much should I charge to
increase a planet\'s TL?  This is never covered in the rules,  (At my players
and I haven\'t seen it) but is necessary.

Second, how about Colonization?  How do you keep a planet docile after you\'ve
invaded it?  How badly does bombardment mess up GNP?

If noone has worked this out already, I\'ll post what my group works out.
If someone has this kind of thing typed in, I\'d appreciate a copy.

	   Anyone with Jack-O-T or sufficient mechanical acumen would fall in this
area.  Class Scientist, any military tech, etc.  It might be useful to have a
character class called Engineer which specializes in technical skills, but I am
not convinced this will add much to the game.

At this stage of the game, I\'m looking at the proton-proton chain for
Traveller fusion designs and have almost (but not quite) decided that TDR will
officially adopt proton-proton reactions and leave it at that. The reasons are
entirely founded on game mechanics: neutrino sensors wouldn\'t be as useful as
slow neutron sensors if the plants used D+D or D+T; refueling from gas giants
becomes ridiculous or impossible unless we assume the plant can burn straight
protium; the TL sliding scale for plant efficiency makes no sense if D+D or
other reactions are considered -- only p-p reactions could be blamed for a
reactor that\'s so criminally inefficient even at TL 15; military contractors
would gladly sacrifice efficiency for refueling ability (remember the cardinal
rule of ground combat in the 20th BEK-- cut the fuel lines and the tanks can\'t
go vroom any more. Imagine how interesting a desert war would be if the armor
could burn sandstone or other easily-found-in-the-wilderness junk? 

So unless there are further arguments, TDR will go to Protium-based
proton-proton chains for fusion tech, and assume that "refined fuel" is pure
liquid hydrogen and "unrefined fuel" is liquefied gas giant atmosphere or
water (and since I live two blocks from Dow, I\'ll beat him to a pulp in person
when he raises the question of water being more efficient storage of hydrogen
than LH2, so the TML won\'t have to. |-> )

Being a proto-lawyer myself, I thought I\'d throw in my two cents here. In my
opinion, a lawyer can be just as useful in a variety of campaign settings as
any other character class.

There is a lot more to being a lawyer than a wealth of legal knowledge (Legal),
although it is important. A lawyer has to deal with a wide variety of people
(Liaison), from professionals (Admin) to the lower strata (Streetwise and
Carousing). Plus, a lawyer has to be able to get information out of people and
piece things together (Interview/Interrogation). Being able to sift through
huge amounts of information and do effective research may require a certain
facility with computers. Further, various areas of the law may indicate
specialized knowledge: corporate/commercial lawyers would tend to have economic
skills, while lawyers in technical fields (ex. patent law) would have some
expertise in engineering or something similar. You get the idea.

So, even if the campaign won\'t directly involve legal matters, a good lawyer
should be able to serve effectively in other roles. I\'m more or less testing
that proposition in the PBEM game...

FYI, a past issue of Challenge had an extended version of the Law Enforcement
character (like the Police you mentioned.) Sorry, can\'t remember which one, but
it wasn\'t a recent issue. I may be roused to do an extended lawyer generation
system for TDR, or is there any other law-type out in TML-land?

On an unrelated subject, let me say that I like vehicle designs on the TML. I
have archived them and squirreled them away on floppy for a future reference.ay
After all, why reinvent the wheel? I don\'t mind occasional large groups of
designs (like from Robert Dean) but I DO mind a daily flow of HUGE chunks of
designs that goes on and on for many days, like from Scott Kellogg. I would
MUCH prefer smaller, more spread out chunks. Thems my $.02 worth.

We never generated any rules (because we never got the TCS game going),
however the tech levels were to be broken down into sub-categories as
mentioned in the World builders handbook. This also implies which
categories depend on others, eg: most depend on the power Tech Level.
We had decided to make the improvment of a category a multi-part
research project (reserch projects as described in the referee\'s companion).
The players would buy research groups (actually fund them), who would then
try to complete the stages to improve the tech levels of each category.

This is fine in isolation but there are two other complications to consider
1) Influence of higher tech worlds. (Research should be a lot easier if
you can just take a trip to your higher tech ally, and get copies of their
research papers, working examples, etc).

2) Population inertia. Just because the world develops a new tech level
doesn\'t mean that the population will use it and move the world to the
new tech level. Take a look at the Vilani culture as described in the
Vargr and Vilani supplement from DGP. We come from a culture that seems
to embrace technological advances, not all will, especially if technology
caused the culture some pain. (eg: many post-nuclear war stories have
people rejecting technology in case history repeats itself).

While the Jump-6 limitation is reasonable, why stay with the 6G limit?
Just make it MUCH more costly (in power terms) to hit those high gees.

Does the use of some sort of power function for grav power sound more
correct?  Thus

       Power = (constant) * ((grav * mass)^(scale))

Scale of efficiency and the power constant decrease with increasing TL,
making high G\'s feasable at higher TL\'s.  The actual volume/mass of the grav
array might decrease a bit with higher TL\'s, but the biggest gain from the
higher tech is decreased power requirements.

Worlds that have better High-Common TL then air-travel TL might have a
decreased scale value, while the reverse would apply to the constant value.
In addition, the use of wings in an atmosphere would reduce the constant value
to a small degree.

I feel that unifying this much is too much of a good thing.  A car is not
a boat, nor is a sub a spaceship.  There should probably be three sets of
design rules, based on a common core:

   Ground vehicles: Cars, trucks, etc.  No grav stuff, but includes hovercraft.
   Watercraft:      Boats, subs, etc.
   Aircraft:        Grav craft, spacecraft, etc.

I think it should be broken up a bit just because of the differences in design
philosophy.  If you wish to make an aero-car, you would use the basic aircraft
rules and add vehicle stuff.  A sub-plane would use either the aircraft or
watercraft rules, depending on primary emphasis.

>COMBAT SYSTEM
>
>I like the Azhanti High Lightning/Striker system of combat where

IMHO, the "overall body damage" system is outdated and should be
eliminated.  Also, the direct use of characteristics for "hitpoints"
should be dropped in favor of a more abstract system (perhaps similar to
"STAR WARS").  Each character is given a "toughness" rating (based on Strength,
Endurance, and some racial modifiers -- kkee should be tougher then humans).
When a character\'s armor is breached, the "degree of damage (DOD)" is determined.
If an optional hit location table is used, head hits might be DODx10, arms
DODx1/2, etc.  By cross referencing the DOD with teh toughness, you can
determine wounding (superficial, light, moderate, serious, critical, lethal).

This system would retain enough of the old system, but add some "space
opera-ish" taste.

A though just hit me (*clonk* :).  If TDR deems that grav drives are
reasonable (probably at high TL\'s if my power function idea is used),
actual thrust sould be primarily along the axis of the ship, with limited
thrust on the sides.

Generally: sides =1-6,    1  ^
                         6 2 |
                         5 3 forward
                          4

Assume: rear = full power, front = 2/3 power, rear flank = 1/2 power,
        front flank = 1/3 power.  Round down (space combat)

(gravatic drive is at center of gravity, aligned along the axis).

Rear Thrust  Front  Front Flank  Rear Flank
    1g         0g       0g          0g
    2g         1g       0g          1g
    3g         2g       1g          1g
    4g         2g       1g          2g
    5g         3g       1g          2g
    6g         4g       2g          3g

A ship designed with a 4g max rear thrust may apply up to 2g forward as
breaking thrust.  If the captain wants more, he will have to turn around.
In addition, the ship may face the enemy and still retreat, if the
armor in the fron is heavier.

VECTOR MOVEMENT

The last bout of vector combat I played with was MAYDAY, many years ago.
I don\'t know how MT does it, but how about this.

Forward vector: Current vector with respect to the ship\'s axis.  positive
indicates forward, negative indicates backward.

Slip vector: Thrust added by rear flank thrusters produces a slip vector,
either Left or Right.  These vectors are added to the forward vector.

Drag vector: used to counteract slip vectors.  Right drag will cancel
right slip on a 1-1 basis.

Reverse vector:  Using forward thrust to counteract forward vectors.

When ships rotate, the vectors change names:

           Forward   Left-Slip    Right-Slip
Left Turn   R-Slip   Forward       Left Drag
Right Turn  L-Slip   Right Drag     forward

Course "A" has these vectors: F4, L2
Course "B" has these vectors: F2, L3, R2
Course "C" has these vectors: F6, L-4    (drag left 4)

the *\'s indicate the plotting path.  S is starting point, F is ending point.
As you can see, large drag and slip vectors can be simplified to
forward vectors with small slips or drags.

Thus, drag converts to slip at the cost of forward vector and reversal
of dirction.  (as shown on path "C")
Equal left and right slips cancel, to produce one forward vector, per
canceling, with the excess becoming the actual slip.

which might otherwise get lost in the \'background noise\'.

tributors can, well, \'coordinate\' their work through the appropriate
coordinator.

I know that some of you have already talked to me about TDR.  A lot
more of you have talke to Metlay about the same thing.  Please don\'t

  know about you. :-) -mfc ]

Hopefully, most of the TML readers that are interested will have signed
in by the middle of December.  This means that coordinators for each
of the sections should be announced via the TML before Christmas.

We want to focus all of this energy being expended over the TML into

The implication was not that you would overload due to the jump, but that
the incomming energy might overload the capacitors regardless of your desires.
Depends on how the globe is wired into the capacitors.

This is the normal case now.  Major heavy military ships simply cannot
outrun most civilian ships.  This is why you have smaller, lighter armored,
military ships for chasing down civilian ships!  Note that this is not true
of bulk cargo ships that are fully loaded.  It is only true of "speedsters",
smuggler\'s craft (which are far more powerful than they *appear* to be), and
*empty* bulk cargo ships.  Or so has been my (limited) experience....

Time for some number crunching.  First, a correction to the above.  It\'s
momentum, not energy, that Newton\'s 3rd law deals with.  Figures for Traveller
assault rifle and gauss rifle come from Book 4; figures for M-16 assault rifle
come from "The Armory" by Kevin Dockery, in brackets in the assault rifle part
for comparison.

	Mass of a fully loaded assault rifle = 3.33 kg	   (3.635 kg)
	Mass of a 6mm slug from assault rifle = 0.005 kg   (0.00365 kg)
	Velocity of slug = 900 m/s			   (999.7 m/s)
=>	Momentum of slug = 4.5 kg m/s			   (3.65 m/s)
By Newton\'s 3rd law, momentum of rifle = 4.5 kg m/s in the other direction.
=>	Velocity of rifle = 1.35 m/s			   (1.0 m/s)

	Mass of a fully loaded gauss rifle = 3.90 kg
	Mass of a 4mm needle from gauss rifle = 0.004 kg
	Velocity of needle = 1500 m/s
=>	Momentum of slug = 6 kg m/s
=>	Momentum of gauss rifle = 6 kg m/s the other way
=>	Velocity of rifle = 1.54 m/s
=>	A gauss rifle is no more a low recoil weapon than an assault rifle.

The gauss rifle gets its extra penetration from the small calibre plus the
greater impact; it gets its extra damage from the higher kinetic energy.
How it gets a low recoil is beyond me.  Maybe it incorporates a reactionless
drive. :-)

    'body' => 'Robert P Poole said basically that FTL travel is impossible.  I will agree,
IF we add the proviso:  "With Our Current Understanding Of Physics!"

So many times in history, someone has said "not possible, the universe
doesn\'t allow it", it has turned out later that it WAS possible, only
our knowledge was incomplete, or the evidence misunderstood, to give
the impression that the desired ability was impossible.

I\'ll even admit (reluctantly :-) ) that the percentage chance of FTL
working is MUCH less than 1%, but until we know everything, we cannot
eliminate that last little bit of uncertanty.

Still, Robert has a valid point:

	DON\'T GET BOGGED DOWN TRYING TO MAKE EVERYTHING "REAL".

It is sufficient if it is "close", or even as long as it is internally
consistent and not too obviously externally bogus.

Example, FTL is necessary to reduce travel times to something that can be
used within the framework of an RPG game taking place on multiple planets
around different stars.  Yes, it mucks up with our current understanding
of physics, but it is needed, so give it a mild handwave and continue on.

However, a "reactionless" drive is probably NOT necessary.  Having
only "reaction" drives puts a whole series of other problems into
fairly well understood fields.  Allowing higher efficiencies than
are now possible, through some plausible means (such as controlled
fusion), can reduce interplanetary travel times to something more
tolerable.  On the other hand, long trips leave lots of time for
fun and games like "self-improvment" (Gee! I didn\'t know this ship
had a shooting range!), and "capture-the-bridge" (I don\'t understand
*why* the Captain is soooo upset!).

Robert?  You seem to fall into the same category of people who say
"It\'s Just A Show!  Get A Life!"  To which I say:

	So What!  WE LIKE TRYING TO FIGURE IT OUT!

It doesn\'t matter if we KNOW that it isn\'t going to work in real life,
it\'s enough if we can come up with something that doesn\'t bend too many
rules and is internally consistent!  The question is, which rules are
we going to bend and by how much!  THAT\'s what we\'re arguing about! :-)

Which is *precisely* what the TDR development team is going to have to
do.  Decide which rules to bend and by how much.  Yes, the trade rules
and such are desparately in need of fixing, but how can you fix them when
you don\'t know how long it takes to get from here to there, or how much
it\'s going to cost you to transport that cargo over that distance?

Without having both maneuver and FTL drive pinned down, you can\'t figure
what is "reasonable" for cargo/costs/sizes/values/etc...  Sure, you can
come up with some pretty good formulas, but you need some constants to
plug into the formulas so that the number of useless cargos generated are
not so many that you roll dozens of times before you get one viable cargo
that doesn\'t even fill your cargo space!  Yet the cargos generated should
allow for the chance that bad choices will lead to financial problems.

I suppose that the first thing to do is to decide what features depend
on which others, praying that there aren\'t too many circular dependencies.

Here, I\'ll start the chart:

	Maneuver Drive ____
		^          \\
		|           > Ship Design ----> Cargo Viability
	FTL Drive _________/

Before you can develop good formulas for generating cargo, you have to know
how much it costs to transport the goods and how long it takes to get there.
(Some cargos are perishable.)  Before you can know that, you have to have your
ship design methods layed out, because without that, you\'ve no idea what your
average ship capacities are.  Before that, you have to have some idea how your
Maneuver and FTL Drives work, because they will affect what you can get away
with in Ship Design.  Before that, you have to decide just how your FTL drive
is going to work.  Like, are you required to move away from gravity wells for
it to work efficiently?  How far?  This will affect what your maneuver drive
must be capable of for your FTL drive to work.  If you\'re not required to move
away from a gravity well, then do you have to be outside atmosphere?  If not,
then why bother with a maneuver drive anyway?

Get the idea?  Yes, the design process is probably going to be somewhat
iterative, but if you get the basics nailed down carefully enough, the
rest shouldn\'t be too bad.

	    ABOVE ALL, MAINTAIN INTERNAL CONSISTENCY!

I don\'t think there\'s anything that ticks an RPGer off more, than a
game which isn\'t internally consistent.  Such inconsistency normally
shows up in the rules, making it hard to play.

				    Good Luck!

You\'re picking nits, Adrian.  Assume the following symbols:
        m = mass of the gauss needle
        a = acceleration of the needle at the barrel mouth
        M = mass of the gauss rifle
        A = acceleration of the rifle in the opposite direction
If ma=F->, then MA=<-F, right?  By definition, "Momentum" is the magnitude
of F, without the vector component (staight out of Halliday & Resnick\'s
"Fundanemtals of Physics").

These values are slightly off (you\'ve listed the UNLOADED wt. of the M-16
and the slug velocity is a little low for a std. DoD issue M193 ball round),
but I accept your point.

Let\'s qualify that: it\'s no more low recoil that a 5.56mm assault rifle.
I don\'t argue this, ever.  The flaw in your argument is assuming that the
5.56mm assault rifle IS NOT ALSO A LOW RECOIL WEAPON.  It is, in fact,
just that.  Have you ever fired an M-16?  You can do it with one hand,
you know.  It has almost no kick.

If compare the M-16 to a "real" assault rifle (my definition of "real";
you\'re mileage may vary), like the 7.62mm ARM/AR Galil, there\'s a noticable
difference.  Chambering the NATO M59 ball round, the values for it are:
        Mass of a fully loaded rifle = 4.07 kg (w/ loaded 35 rnd. clip)
        Mass of std. slug = 150.5 gr. = 9.75 g. = 0.00975 kg
        Velocity of slug = 2789 ft/s. = 850 m/s
        Momentum of slug = 8.29 kg m/s
using the same math you use (which I\'m not contending, BTW), we get:
        Velocity of rifle = 2.04 m/s
This is about 130% that of the gauss rifle and the MT Player\'s Manual refers
to this type of weapon as "Med. Recoil" (see the entry "Assault Rifle (7mm)
on pg. 76).

Let\'s compare the momentum of the 5.56mm slug to a different, but popular,
American round: the std. .22 Long Rifle round.  According to "Cartridges
of the World" - 6th Ed., it has the following stats:
        Mass of std. slug = 40 gr. = 2.59 g. = 0.00259 kg.
        Muzzle velocity of slug = 1150 ft/s. = 350 m/s
        Momentum of slug = 0.908 kg m/s
Now, if we use that round in my Ruger 10/22 (a .22 semi-auto sports rifle),
which has the following weight:
        Mass of loaded rifle = 4.8 lb. = 1.8 kg.
We get a recoil momentum of:
        Velocity of rifle = 0.5 m/s.
Now, that\'s only about 37% of the M-16, and about 33% of the gauss rifle.
(I guess that makes it a "No Recoil" weapon.) :-)  The reason I include
this round is that I\'d wager that almost everybody on the TML has fired
a .22 cal. rifle (or pistol) and some point in their life, so it gives
a common ground for interpretation.  The 7.62mm round fired by the Galil,
on the other hand, is a Winchester .308 round in civilian life; a big
game hunting round.  The 5.56mm M-16 is about in the middle, as is the
gauss rifle (although tending slightly towards the higher end).  This
pretty definitely puts both of them in the "Low Recoil" catagory, at
least by MT combat standards.

One last point, the MT Imperial Encyclopedia (pg. 71) states that standard
equipment for the gauss rifle includes gyrostabilization.  If that addition
doesn\'t make it "Low Recoil", then I don\'t know what does.

     I had to look twice at this.  If "Leviathan" is being used as an
adjective, then okay.  If you mean the merchant ship from Adventure 4,
that\'s only 53.5 meters long (from the specs).

     Come to think of it, I\'ve never heard of a ship several kilometers
long in Traveller.  Even the big ships from Supplement 9 aren\'t anywhere
near that big.  Have I missed something?

Some questions have been raised about the relationship between TDR and
the companies publishing MegaTraveller; I think these should be answered 
clearly before we finish anything concrete.

I should soften my statement that we are going to avoid mingling TDR with
involvement from GDW (unlikely at best) or DGP (somewhat more possible)
"at all costs." Obviously this can\'t be done; the gaming community is a 
small one, and word gets around. So the policy I\'d like to adopt is one
of careful distancing from the "official line" until we have something
to show for our efforts. Remember-- we\'re doing these rules because we\'ve
seen several areas of Traveller, which is overall a wonderful game, that
are, well, BROKEN. And we want to fix them, basically. So what we\'re 
doing here is creating OUR vision of a repaired MT rules system: Traveller
Done Right. This defines the parameters of TDR as a product: we are not
licensed by GDW to sell it, therefore we cannot, so it MUST be made
available for free, and we cannot represent it as anything remotely 
resembling officialdom. Recall DGP\'s efforts to "fix" Traveller resulted
in MegaTraveller, a major overhaul whose improvements have often been
ignored in the light of some of the bigger gaffes. We\'re taking the next
step with TDR, but somehow I doubt that either GDW or DGP is willing to
consider Traveller rev 3.0 just yet. So we need to get our ideas out there
and have them playtested and beaten upon for a while, resulting in updates
and improvements once in a while and in the end, a system that maybe, 
POSSIBLY, might get looked at by GDW and DGP as a worthwhile variant or
addition to the MT rules. This will take years, and as long as copyright
is retained we will always have the option of licensing, but as of now
any involvement with DGP or GDW on an official level is out of the question.

That having been said, let me second Mark\'s motion and say, get the rules
in BEFORE we try to decide how to distribute them; stop talking and start
doing, folx. (And lest ye point at me, I have a few things of my own on
the way: with Dow, a fixed trade/commerce system, and on my own, an 
expanded skill list and the beginnings of a TON of equipment and weapons
data.)

Traveller on Fusion:

On page 83 of the Referee\'s Manual it refers to hydrogen fuel and
hydrogen gas (unrefined fuel).  Hydrogen gas is skimmed from gas giants
which we all know are not pure hydrogen but rather hydrogen compounds.
Therefore it seems reasonable to assume that the fusion plants use plain
hydrogen as fuel.  Burning unrefined fuel means injecting hydrogen
compounds (such as water or methane) into the reaction chamber and letting
the ultra-high temperatures break down the molecule and fuse the hydrogen.
The problem with unrefined fuel then is that you have less hydrogen per unit
volume and more non-fuel particles in the way.

Assuming then a p-p chain like reaction (or a related reaction such as the
C-N-O catalytic fusion cycle) neutrinos will be emitted and be detectable
as moving neutrino "hot spots" in the otherwise stationary neutrino
background.  Triangulation will allow estimates of range for reasonably
close targets.  Flux will allow estimates of energy generation.

About Refineries:

I can find no place that says 1 ton of skimmed material will be processed
into 1 ton of refined fuel, therefore since this makes no sense it must not
be the case.  Refineries are rated in kiloliters/6 hours.  I take this to
mean, given raw material, the refinery can produce x kl/6 hours.  How much
raw material depends on the gas giant (or more generally the source).  
Remember 1 ton actually means 13.5 kl (a volume).  So the referee needs to
assign a percentage yeild to the material being processed.  One way to
estimate the percentage yeild of a material would be to estimate the number
of molecules present in 1 kl.  Then multiply by the number of hydrogen atoms
in each molecule (ie 2 for water).  Then see what volume that much hydrogen
would occupy.  The ratios of the volumes is the percentage yeild.  You 
could say that the purification times are for some averagy yeild and high
yeild gas giants would take less time while low yeild gas giants would
take longer.  For mixed material simply use ratios ie if water yeilds 25%
hydrogen and methane yeilds 40% hydrogen then something thats half water
and half methane would yeild (25/2 + 40/2) 32.5% hydrogen.  This can get
very messy very quickly so an alternative is to simply classify the gas
giants as average, high, and low yeild and then adjust processing times
accordingly. (Note the numbers for water and methane are made up.)

Speaking of Volume:

Has anyone considered compressing the hydrogen?  That is putting the same
amount of fuel into a smaller space thus allowing more room for other things?
What I like to do is design the ship as normal but then when I draw it I
don\'t put in the fuel storage until last.  This allows some "artistic" 
flare when laying out the ship.  i can put in hallways and common areas and
the like (within reason) then when I am finished I take the left over space
and put the fuel in there.  If there isn\'t enough left over space, then the
fuel is compressed!  I usually end up with about a 2 or 3 compression ratio
at most.  The actual weight of the ship would be higher than calculated
from the books but not alot because the extra space is not used for additional
equipment (cargo space or staterooms or the like) but rather for open spaces
like hallways.  Comments?

Okay, I just can\'t stay out of this discussion any longer.

When the unrefined fuel enters the reactor, it takes additional energy
to break apart the moecules and ionize the atoms -- considerable energy
in the case of all non-hydrogen elements.  So, the reactor must be run
at a higher fuel flow rate than was necessary for refined fuel, to get
the same output; or in the case of jump engines, it may be difficult to
get power flow to be well-regulated, depending on vagaries in the mix.

Also, the garbage elements absorb neutrons and other particles; in
general, causing the reaction to be less controlled, and slurping up
still more energy.  The isotope transmutation and added scattering leads
to residual radioactivity of the reactor chamber, and accelerates the
normal plasma bombardment/destruction of the chamber\'s walls.  The end
result is that the reactor chamber needs replacement much more often,
sensors controlling the reaction are more likely to fail, and with the
increased radioactivity one is more likely to have ionization problems
in nearby electronics and power control circuits.

Commercial engines are DESIGNED to run on refined fuel, so they are
smaller, lighter, less shielded, and have less robust control
mechanisms.  Military drives that run on unrefined fuel are built much
more like a brick caca house, are designed to have the reactor chamber
replaced easily and quickly in the field, have more backup control
mechanisms, plus lots of spares are on board to replace the occasional
failure.  The waste reactor cores can be easily and cheaply placed in a
military rad weapons dump somewhere, and so on.  It\'s only money, and
the military is allowed to spend lots of it.

> Has anyone considered compressing the hydrogen?

I was always under the belief that fuel hydrogen was stored as a
cryogenic liquid.  Liquids are awfully hard to compress.  The only
possible compression I see possible is to solidify it, which is very
hard to do (need very high pressures) with hydrogen, besides which you\'d
need to thaw it out to use it in the engines.

I tend not to worry about deck plans being real accurate; they are there
as additional detail to make the fictional universe more palpable.
Besides, the "rule"books indicate that 10% slop either way on deck plan
volumes is acceptable.  I also figure that there are many nooks and
crannies aboard the vessel which are difficult to depict on deck plans,
but are used by something, either freeing additional room for fuel or
actually used for fuel storage itself... as a case in point, have you
ever done a deck plan of a Scout-shaped ship? With such a shape, it
doesn\'t translate real well to paper (how big a triangle do I draw to
map deck 1? deck 2? Heck, I\'ll make a rough guess :-).

If you think about it, there\'s less truth to this statement than you may
think.  At the current TL (ours; 8, I think) cars and boats are almost
identical: they both have internal combustion engines; they both are
semi-waterproof (cars from the top, boats from the bottom); they both
have similiar ranges, speeds, and capacities.  The same is true for
subs and spaceships: both have self-contained life support systems;
both are large, cumbersome, and expensive; both require extremely high
tech guidance and propulsion systems; both require crews of >1; both
require exotic fuels (LOX and hydrazine for the rockets, uranium for
the subs); etc.

Well, at high TLs, where do you draw the line?  When does a gravitic ground
vehicle stop becoming a ground vehicle and start becoming an air vehicle?
If you\'re going base your rule separation strictly on type of propulsion
system, how granular to you get?  What is an air cushion vehicle: ground,
water, or air?  Why slam it into ground vehicles when it could just as
easily be put in one of the other two?  This seems highly arbitrary to me.

By creating a single "unified" set of design rules, you no longer have
to worry about those (artificial) boundaries.  If the rules big enough
to cover everything seem unwieldy, you simply design them such that
certain unneccessary components become optional (like weapon, environment,
and computer control components for a skateboard).  In a modular, unified
system, you have the best of both worlds: everything is designed the same
way, but you only use what you need.  And the biggest plus of all is that
you don\'t have to duplicate common design rules for separate systems.

If this is the kind of combat system you want, then you\'re probably gonna\'
love the one Iain Fogg and I are almost finished with.  Heavily based on
Cyberpunk\'s "Friday Night Firefight", it uses weapon damage translated
into wound types: Flesh, Serious, Critical, Mortal, and Dead.  These
wounds are modified by a BODY TYPE (Very Weak, Weak, Avg., Strong, Very
Strong), so that a K\'Kree would naturally be tougher that a Human.

Wait and see.

    'body' => 'RE: TDR rules categories & help

While I don\'t think I can add much in the way of writing concrete rules, I\'d be
happy to review rules submissions, and in general bounce ideas around.
Is there a TDR category for that, or are such a dime a dozen? :-)  I\'m not up
on the lastest Traveller, but have good experience with \'classic\' Traveller,
and designing homebrew rules systems.

RE: Survey list

You know, this is the first time that I\'ve ever seen anything resembling a list
of who\'s who in the TML.  Don\'cha think it would be nice to know a bit about
who\'s who?  who knows, maybe there are some Traveller types near me???

RE: TDR rules categories

Should we have rules dealing with world\'s TL as mentioned in the TCS question?
What\'s the chances of varying TL pieces of equipment actually working together?
In one of the Star Wars books, the Falcon\'s control system gets shot up, so Han
Solo cobbles together a \'fluidics\' control system;  I thought it was laughable!

RE: TDR drives

In general, Traveller ships seem to have two or three types of drives: jump
drives, and maneuver drives, and perhaps gravitic drives.  The Jump drive is
used for interstellar travel, the maneuver drives are used for interplanetary
travel, and the gravitics drives are used to land the ship without damaging the
real estate.

I don\'t like having to have three drives, but they seem to be necessary. 
Assuming that the maneuver drive is a reaction drive, you need some other sort
of drive to land without destroying the place.  Are there other ways to land
ships?  Are there reaction drives that are not destructive?  Some scenarios
have space ports have gravitic landing platforms, and scorched earth wilderness
landings.  I kind of like that.

If you have a gravitic landing drive, perhaps it\'s combined with the shipboard
gravity equipment, so that it\'s essentially free?  In any case, I\'d like to be
able to design ships without gravity equipment.

I definitely don\'t like the idea of the maneuver drives being (anti)gravity
drives.  In my mind an antigravity drive has to have a nearby mass to work
against, and I question if antigrav vehicles should work further in space then
low orbit.  I\'m sure there are ways to explain it away, such that the gravity
drive generates a gravity field, and the ship falls toward it, but for some
reason it goes against my grain.  It seems like pulling a rabbit out of a hat! 
Does anyone else have such misgivings?

I like the idea of maneuver drives being reaction drives.  Traditionally
spacecraft have always had some kind of jets or exhaust, even the highest TL,
and I don\'t want to change that.  However, it seems that the physics doesn\'t
work, if I\'m following the TML discussion correctly.

There are other possibilities for maneuver drives other then a reaction drive
or a \'rabbit out of a hat\' drive, and I hope we can decide on one that fits for
TDR maneuver drives...

Discussion?

RE: TDR unified design rules

It\'s the only way to go!

RE: Combat systems

I like the idea of being able to figure out where a character has been hit, and
take that in account for damage, but such rules ***must*** be simple and
PLAYABLE!

RE: vehicle movement

I hope that TDR will use the MAYDAY vector movement rules, instead of the
\'zones\' gimmick use somewhere in Traveller...

I agree that if the recoil of a GR is equivalent to an M-16 then it
should be classified as LOW recoil.  The combination of low recoil,
high velocity, low cross section and high round mass make the GR very
nice from a military ballistics standpoint.

The GR should also be able to fire ultra-rapid multi-round bursts like
the HK Gll.  It fires 3 rounds so rapidly that the last round is out
of the weapon before the recoil can change the aiming point.  This makes
it MUCH more likely that at least one of the 3 rounds will hit the
target (unlike most modern assault rifles where the action must cycle
completely between each round thus moving the \'aiming\' point of each
subsequent round many mils).  The side effect of this is that the net
recoil for the burst is increased.  Tech 8 and 9 ACRs should probably
have this capability also.

Another area I\'d like to see discussed is the use of gyrostabilizers
on personal weapons.  It seems that they would make the aiming process
more difficult unless they kicked in at a relatively late stage in the
process (maybe activated by trigger pull).

shipping going on.  I think it\'s more likely that only rare refined alloys
would be shipped.  In general, it\'s better to ship finished products, rather
then raw materials which in general abound.

Let\'s think about the real world...  plenty of bannannas are shipped from SA to
NA.  Why?  Because we can\'t grow bannannas here.  Why do people eat bannannas?
Beats me!  Mostly because they are cheap food, and they taste good.  Why are
they cheap, because they can grow them cheap and ship them cheap.  But it\'s not
something people "needed" to have, and thus ordered, it was probably a market
that had to be developed.

Another example... Cars.  We make cars in the US, why do we ship them from
Japan to the US?  Because Japan can make them cheaper and better then we can,
and ship them to us and *still* have them be cheap (and better).

Some more examples of raw materials... Oil, steel, ores...  Today all these
materials are shipped all across the world, mostly from areas which have a lot
of these materials to areas which don\'t have them.  And industrial areas have
to import materials which they don\'t have locally which they need for their
products, but the imported raw materials should be a small portion of the total
raw materials used.  Japan, for instance imports a lot of raw materials because
they have very little "raw material" there.

However, these activities are all taking place on a global scale, where these
raw materials do exist only in certain places in the world.  I have a hard time
believing that the same circumstances will hold when you are shipping between
planets or systems.  I would think *somewhere* on a planet or system there
would be a quantity of X.  It may be produced in one place in a system, and
used in another place in system, but I doubt much would be shipped outsystem.

Various levels of development also have an effect on shipping.  A colony
system, traditionally imports all it\'s manufactured goods, and can pay for them
only with raw materials; a colony will not have developed all it\'s resources
and industries.  A developed system will probably be able to have developed
resources and industries and be relitively self sufficient, and will be
exporting manufactured goods.  A system that has been settled for a *long*
time, like Terra, may have squandered all it\'s resources, and *have* to import
raw materials, like Japan does, and will have to be able to add sufficient
value to make it worthwhile.

Can we take this into account on shipping charts?

     I like to reply to one point in your message.  You said that commercial
drives were intended to eat refined fuel, while military drives would eat
unrefined fuel.  This is a carryover from old Traveller that has no existence
in the new design rules, as far as I can tell.  What all military ships have
in the new design rules (and all commercial ships, if they\'re sensible) is the
fule purifier.  As big and bulky as they are under the new rules, they are 
still cost effective when used on commercial ships, at least according to the
current (broken) trade rules.

How does gyrostab make it low-recoil?  My understanding of how gyros work (not
comprehensive, by any means ;+) don\'t let them absorb recoil, just help you
keep the gun pointed at the target.  Gyros resist torqueing moments (is my
terminology correct? ) but the full recoil should still hit your shoulder
(wrist, whatever...).

Yes?  No?

    'body' => 'Last week I spouted off about being more interested in working with
TML sophonts on programs to help the GM, than in directly addressing
TDR rules-generation stuff.  This has sparked some interest, and some
heat as well as light.  This message is a summary of CAT to date, a
list of existing participants, and (I hope) removal of some floatsam.

Current participants:
	Richard Johnson		richard@agora.hf.intel.com
	Chuck McKnight 		mcknight@tusun2.mcs.utulsa.edu
	Paul Dale		grue@batserver.
	Dan Corrin		dan@engrg.uwo.ca
	
Others who seem to be interested, by their archives and TML comments,
but who have not actually offered to join in the discussion:
	Jo Jaquinta		lgrant@maths.tcd.ie
	Robert P. Poole		tarquin@athena.mit.edu
	Mark Cook		markc@hpcvss.cv.hp.com

Actually, Mark has participated, but his priorities are for TDR.


We, so far, do not actually have a co-ordinator.  We usually just copy
everyone who is participating, as I am with this message.  This one I
felt should be echoed to the TML as well -- sort of a gentle reminder
to others that if they are interested, they can join in.  The feeling of
most of us is that software is better done quietly in private (and 
wash your hands afterwards. :-)  Actually, we\'re deliberately trying to
avoid committee-think.

Our primary goal right now was IMHO best expressed by Dan:
	A pc in front of every ref? I could care less. I want a pc in
	front of *me* while I am refing. So do others on the list, and 
	I just think that we should get together to program so we don\'t 
	waste our efforts.

Chuck is currently doing MSDOS ports of existing software on the TML.
Dan and Paul are working on a Deck Plan generator, and I\'m just trying
to collect everything so I can see what programs I want to port to 
what machines.  My eventual goal is to have a bunch of programs we can
put together as a package for distribution, a package that covers most 
of the most-needed stuff.

I think most of us are out for personal fun, not profit.  We\'ll take the
cash if it falls in our laps, though.


Mark and Dan have been discussing the role of CAT<-->TDR.  My view, shaped
largely by Dan\'s, is that we\'re programming for ourselves, and sharing 
information.  Right now we\'re doing MT rules, because they exist.  If,
in the future, someone (or several) want to port the programs to TDR rules,
we\'ll help all we can.


I\'m not sure what Robert Poole is doing, but did understand he was archiving
software for TDR, or something like that.  Robert, if you get your copy,
please let at least one of us know if and how we should co-ordinate
efforts.

I haven\'t had a chance to test this so if any of you have some time to try it
out, or analyze the numbers (or ideas) please let me know.

Two things that I have left out: Law School and Medical School.  If anyone
cares to add them, feel free.

I changed the rules for College because the way they have it in MT it just 
doesn\'t seem worth wasting an entire term just for a couple of points of Edu.

Please see the the very end of my post for a list of new and modified skills.
If you don\'t like the changes it shouldn\'t be too hard to undo them.  Just add
a Field table for Genetics and remove the one for Psychology.  You should also
replace one of the Bio entries under the Biology Field table with Genetics.  
However, I don\'t think Genetics should have a separate skill of it\'s own unless
you break some of the other science skills down, too.  Then you could just make
them cascade skills and leave the tables as I have them.

  It seems that the mailertrouble was harder to do anything about than
I thought. Someone with admin priviliges have to (probably) delete my
mailbox after copying it up to my homedir.

  So far everyone here has been singularily unhelpful:

  "Talk to someone else."
  "I\'ts bound to be your own fault."
  "Yes, I\'m the one that you should talk to about emergencies, but this
   isn\'t an emergency, this is just your private problem and I don\'t
   care how or if you solve it."
  "I don\'t have root privileges." "But you one of the administrators?!." "As I
   said, this is your own problem."
  "You shouldn\'t have such a large mailbox." "I didn\'t have a large mailbox.
   I had just a handful in it, I have had over 50 messages there before and it
   always worked." "Well, you shouldn\'t have such a large mailbox. If it hadn\'t
   been so large this would never had happened. No matter the size of it, it 
   was too large because this happened." (Spoken by someone who didn\'t have
     a faintest about what really had happened with it and didn\'t think it
     important enough to let me explain what had happened.
     Jeez! Where do they dig them up?)
 
  The matter is made somewhat worse because I\'m waiting for stuff to a con
here in Gothenburg to arrive in the mail now soon and the deadline is sunday.

  As you might tell, I\'m not in a good mood at all right now.

  I would apreciate it if everyone could delay your mails to me until next
monday. This include TML digests, PBEM things and TDR things and the testing
of the ship design and everything else. The reason for this is that
they might disappear into the big bit bucket by accident or carelessness when
my mailbox is repaired on sunday(?). Im also not sure how much the mailbox can
takes befor it crashes for size reasons. If that happens then the flightpath of
the natural waste products is really going to intersect the moving parts of the
rotating air-stream creation implement:(

*| 
*| Last week I spouted off about being more interested in working with
*| TML sophonts on programs to help the GM, than in directly addressing
*| TDR rules-generation stuff.  This has sparked some interest, and some
*| heat as well as light.  This message is a summary of CAT to date, a
*| list of existing participants, and (I hope) removal of some floatsam.
*| 
*| Current participants:
*| 	Richard Johnson		richard@agora.hf.intel.com
*| 	Chuck McKnight 		mcknight@tusun2.mcs.utulsa.edu
*| 	Paul Dale		grue@batserver.
*| 	Dan Corrin		dan@engrg.uwo.ca
*| 	

Add me to that list.   I am MORE than willing to participate.

*| We, so far, do not actually have a co-ordinator.  We usually just copy
*| everyone who is participating, as I am with this message.  This one I
*| felt should be echoed to the TML as well -- sort of a gentle reminder
*| to others that if they are interested, they can join in.  The feeling of
*| most of us is that software is better done quietly in private (and 
*| wash your hands afterwards. :-)  Actually, we\'re deliberately trying to
*| avoid committee-think.
*| 

OK.  So maybe the fact that the stuff I\'m working on already is
written in C++ won\'t be a problem?   How many folks out there have
access to a C++ compiler?

*| Our primary goal right now was IMHO best expressed by Dan:
*| 	A pc in front of every ref? I could care less. I want a pc in
*| 	front of *me* while I am refing. So do others on the list, and 
*| 	I just think that we should get together to program so we don\'t 
*| 	waste our efforts.
*| 

My current project for MSDOS is a program called "refaid."  This
program would allow a ref to create "people, places, and things"
and associate them with other "people, places, and things."  Sort
of a tailored RDB program.

*| Chuck is currently doing MSDOS ports of existing software on the TML.
*| Dan and Paul are working on a Deck Plan generator, and I\'m just trying
*| to collect everything so I can see what programs I want to port to 
*| what machines.  My eventual goal is to have a bunch of programs we can
*| put together as a package for distribution, a package that covers most 
*| of the most-needed stuff.
*| 

This is the one facet that I had not anticipated working on for
refaid.   

*| I think most of us are out for personal fun, not profit.  We\'ll take the
*| cash if it falls in our laps, though.
*| 

My plan was to release refaid as a user supported program.  Send me
$ if you want, but mostly I am writing refaid for the fun of it.

*| 
*| Mark and Dan have been discussing the role of CAT<-->TDR.  My view, shaped
*| largely by Dan\'s, is that we\'re programming for ourselves, and sharing 
*| information.  Right now we\'re doing MT rules, because they exist.  If,
*| in the future, someone (or several) want to port the programs to TDR rules,
*| we\'ll help all we can.
*| 

I think that any programs that get written should have both
elements of regular mainstream traveller as well as TDR.  If
released as source code, compiler/preprocessor directives can be
added to the code to conditionally include/exclude TDR and or MT.

*| 
*| I\'m not sure what Robert Poole is doing, but did understand he was archiving
*| software for TDR, or something like that.  Robert, if you get your copy,
*| please let at least one of us know if and how we should co-ordinate
*| efforts.
*| 

I spoke to Robert Poole and I plan to clean up some OT npc
generation programs that I wrote and post them with him.  I also am
going to (I don\'t know when, I\'m real busy right now) port this old
code to MSDOS and release it as executables.  I also want to write
some documentation before releasing it.

I\'d love to see all this happen.  I just hope it doesn\'t die a crib
death.....

Yes AND no, Paul.  You\'re right that gyros don\'t absorb any recoil (you\'ll
still get kicked in the shoulder just as hard).  But that\'s not the point.
>From both a real-life military standpoint AND a RPG standpoint, the
detrimental effect recoil has on accuracy is barrel climb.  Virtually
nothing else matters.  While the gyro won\'t do anything to eliminate
in-line recoil (from the receiver back into your shoulder), it will
significantly reduce barrel climb by damping rotation of the weapon
in any axis.  This means that you are less likely to drift off target.
>From there, the benefit is obvious.  (BTW, this is why almost ALL modern
assault rifles have stocks which are DIRECTLY in line with the receiver.
By being designed that way, they cause a higher percentage of the weapon
recoil to be delivered as in-line recoil, thus drastically reducing the
rotation of the weapon due to recoil.  Result: more accurate weapon at
high ROFs.)

they shipped stuff from one place to another because X didn\'t exist at point B.
But how much of this will be going on, when the basics oflife can be provided
with a planet or a system?  There will still be markets for stuff like tea, and
furs, exotic stuff from far off places for people who have a lot of money to
blow, but fewer raw materials.

Another factor is can a TL 12 planet produce *all* the goods required by a TL
12 economy?  Can the same planet or system produce consumer goods, power
plants, jump drives, computers, weapons, air rafts, body armor and hulls?  I
tend to think not.  I think that it\'s much more likely that planets will
specialize on high tech products, and will export only computers, or only air
rafts or grav tanks.  Supposedly every developed planet has a starport andcan
build spaceships, but that doesn\'t seem likely.  It seems more likely that only
one planet in a dozen will make a business out of building ships, probably
making the hulls, and importing all the rest.  To do *all* of the economic
activity involved in making a business out of building ships would wear out a
planet quite quickly, I would think maybe a couple of decades.

Can we take these factors into account on shipping charts?

        RATIONALE:  As it now stands, two vehicles, such as tanks, that

        of control points.  Since most vehicle hulls (aircraft are an
        exception) don\'t do much but sit there, it doesn\'t seem like it
        should be necessary to use controls on them.  I realize that 
        certain things are included in hull controls, like hood and trunk
        releases on your car, but it seems negligible.  In almost any 
        vehicle that is not extremely heavily armored, the contribution 
        to the total number of control points by the hull is negligible 
        anyway.

        As the rules currently exist, I think the quantity of command 
        crew is vastly inflated, which is why I reduce it like the bridge 
        crew.  Most of the really bad inflation comes in when you have 
        120 or 150 marines on board, and I usually figure that if I have 
        just decided that there are 150 marines, that includes their 
        officers and admin personnel.  I also don\'t see the need to add 
        stewards to the crew when there is a fair amount of slop in the 
        numbers already.  To provide personal service to high paying 
        passengers, yes.  To wait on the crew, no.

        DESIGN EVALUATION
        
        This section can be retained as is, with the following excep-
        tions.  
        
        Damage:  Calculate based on weight, not volume.  Also figure in 
        the factor of ten for personal combat rules to allow more differ-
        entiation of vehicles at lower sizes.  So new hull values become 
        Weight/1.5 (inoperative) and Weight*1.7 (Destroyed).  Values for 
        power plant and locomotion are figured as before, on a percentage 
        of the weight rather than the volume.
        
        For space faring craft, normal acceleration now becomes 
        thrust/weight.  If this value is less than one, the craft cannot 
        lift off from a standard gravity planet. For operations near a 
        planetary surface, figure speed of spacecraft based on 
        (thrust/weight)-1 to account for power required to maintain lift.
        Agility is equal to the acceleration available after all other 
        systems have been powered.

I\'ve gone one better, I\'ve made a model of a scout ship, with a removeable
top, and lots of internal detail.  It\'s based on the deck plans GDW put
out in the old Traveller supplement 7, "Traders and Gunboats" - the same
plan also appeared in the introductory adventure which came with the
De Luxe boxed set.  I had to add in a few things, such as the power plant
and the computer!  I also rearranged the middle section, after I found
that in the wedge-shaped hull, the forward staterooms were only suitable
for dwarves who didn\'t get claustrophobia - the ceiling and deck came
together.  What I did was turn the middle section round, so the crew
common area is directly behind the bridge.  The ceiling and deck still
come together, but there\'s a large quarter-circular chair or sofa in the
forward port corner, and a game console with seats in the forward starboard
quarter, so the higher floor doesn\'t matter - it\'s part of the seat.  I also
moved the cargo bay, because where they had it, there wasn\'t enough height
to allow 3 tons.  Unless, that is, I was to make it long, broad and low,
which wouldn\'t make it useful for many types of cargo.  Besides, I wanted
that place for the forward undercarriage leg.  The ship has reaction drives,
so nyah to all you reactionless fans! :-)  It looks better with exhaust
nozzles, anyway.  I also put in several small thrusters for manoevering.
As for fuel - anywhere I haven\'t put something else is fuel space.

Either you\'ve misread "Fundamentals of Physics", or Halliday & Resnick are
wrong, or the universe has changed since I learnt physics.  Momentum is a
vector.  That\'s how momentum is conserved.  Before firing, momentum of rifle
= momentum of needle = 0.  After firing, momentum of rifle = MV, momentum of
needle = mv, MV = -mv, so MV + mv = 0.

Force is also a vector.  It\'s rate of change of momentum.  If MV = -mv at any
time up to when the needle leaves the barrel, and MV and mv have had the same
amount of time in which to change, then F = -f.

Those values were taken straight from the book, and the weight I quoted was
for a M-16 with a 30-round magazine.  Don\'t blame me if Kevin Dockery got 
them wrong; give us the right figures!

So in TDR, put gauss rifles and 5mm assault rifles in the same recoil class.

So, 5mm assault rifles and gauss rifles are low recoil; 7mm assault rifles
are medium recoil; 5mm pistols are very low recoil.  If anyone is really
interested, I\'ll do similar sums for 9mm pistols, 7mm bolt-action rifles,
and SMG\'s.

Doesn\'t the ACR also have that?  Is the ACR also low recoil?

This depends on what the equipment is.  I can imagine using TL3 sails to propel
a TL9 water ship in an emergency (a lot of them, though!) but I have trouble
using pieces from one TL 7 computer in another TL 7 computer.  Making a TL 8
computer talk to a TL 7 printer is feasible, as long as the TL 8 computer is
not an IBM PC - making that talk to anything is a serious problem!

Reaction drives are bound to be destructive.  It\'s all down to Newton\'s 3rd
law.  Without doing sums, force pushing ship up = force pushing ground down.
If mass of ship = huge, force pushing ship up = lots, so force pushing ground
down = lots, so being under the ship isn\'t a good idea.  Gravitic landing
platforms - you mean a big repulsor that lets the ship down gently without
the ship doing anything?  Nice idea, and I expect the ship gets charged some
CR for it.

And at TL <8, you have to.  Which is why the Shuttle has a big, hard launch
pad.

This was discussed on rec.arts.sf-lovers some time ago.  It\'s about as likely
as making the ship out of iron and fixing a big magnet to its nose.  Either
it has a reaction (the gravity well pulls the ship towards it, and the
generator pushes the ship the other way) or it doesn\'t, it\'s a reactionless
drive, and I\'m tempted to post my proof that reactionless drives can\'t work.

The sums don\'t work.  The physics do, or the Space Shuttle wouldn\'t get off
the ground.

Well, the correct answer is the obvious one; the universe has changed!
No, seriously, I misread Halliday & Resnick.  I\'m sorry.  It\'s been a
long time since college physics classes (too damn long, obviously).

The loaded weight for the M16A1 combat rifle (w/ loaded 30 rnd. clip)
is 3.72 Kg. (see, I said you were close).  The listed weight for the
standard NATO 5.56mm cartridge slug (designated M193 by U.S. Army)
is 56 +/- 2 grains, which translates to 3.629 +/- 0.13 grams.

Now my face is even redder.  I didn\'t realize that, in your note, the
values on the left were for the MT assault rifle and the values in
parenthesis were for the M-16.  You mentioned something about "brackets"
and I couldn\'t find any (to an American, these "[]" are brackets), so
I just assumed you\'d left something out.  In re-reading your note, I see
that your values are correct (so close to the ones in my references that
quibbles over the difference are pointless).

We intend to, I promise.

Definitely interested.  If we provided data, how many would you be
willing to crank out for us?

Yah, the ACR also has gyros.  Boy, I\'m sure consistent.  When I make
mistakes, I make \'em EVERYWHERE. :-)  However, given that the ACR is
a 7mm (and 9mm) weapon, apparently the in-line recoil is sufficient
to put it into the "Medium" range.

I have to disagree again, Mark! :-)

One of the reasons Traveller classes weapons as low, medium and high recoil
is that some people fight in zero-G.  A low recoil weapon (e.g. snub pistol)
is better for use in zero-G than a high-recoil weapon (e.g. PGMP) because
it doesn\'t send you backwards at great speed into the wall behind you.
There\'s also the matter of the strength of the person holding the gun, and
the effect the recoil will have on someone who isn\'t holding it properly.

Well, three days have passed and no one has objected to posting
more of Scott Kellogg\'s designs. (In fact there has been no
comment,except for the moderators.) So here is *A* ship design.
I\'ll keep each posting small, so as not to disturb anyone too much,
and not more than one per day. Again I only get together with Scott
every two or three weeks, so feel free to contact him directly if
speed is important.

Remarks:  For those of you who don\'t know, the \'Alfa\' class attack 
sub is featured in \'The Hunt for Red October\' as one attacks the 
main characters in the climax of the story.  (Great Book!  
Excellent Film!) 
 
    Here is a question, how well would a densitometer see a 
submarine?  It has roughly the same density as the medium around 
it, and when a densitometer has a penetration of 250 meters, is 
that in vapor, or liquid or solid?  Vacuum and air I would say are 
probably negligible, but what about water? 
 
    This is nearly a pure guess.  I reviewed George Herbert\'s 
guidelines for sub building but I found that the MegaTrav rules 
just aren\'t up to building a real submarine unless there is 
something seriously wrong with my calculator.  George suggests that
a sub should be able to safely dive to 10 meters times it\'s armor 
rating.  Well, while I have no reason to doubt him, it is 
impossible to get the \'Alfa\' down to the depths it is supposed to 
be able to reach.  This may be due to the fact that the real thing 
has a titanium hull and MegaTrav does not cover that.  Where the 
numbers don\'t add up I have deferred to reality.  ie the Alfa is 
said to reach 900 meters safely.  The above should reach only half 
that.  Basically, I used the weight of the sub as my main 
guideline.  She displaces approximately 3375 metric tons dived and 
approx 2630 metric tons surfaced.  Oops, make that \'He\' (Russian 
ships are masculine) 
 
    Supposedly, The real sub has a 462MW Fission reactor.  Rob Dean
gave the guidelines for the transmission (2*tracked of same TL w/no
suspension).  George Herbert\'s formula for submarine speeds gave 
the approximate speed the \'Alfa\' is supposed to have. 
 
    The passive sonar array is again a guess, so I threw out a 
number:  10 sensors in an array, 20 for 2 arrays.  For Periscopes 
I used heavy robot arms with double the weight and volume and 
price. 
 
    I got the performance numbers from GDW\'s Harpoon, and "Modern 
Submarine Warfare" by David Miller and John Jordan, Salamander 
Books \'87.  The \'Alfa\' has the above listed reactor, speeds, 
weapons and compliment.  All the rest is Scotty playing with 
numbers. 
 
    Torpedo tubes?  Pure speculation but here is what I used:  
Cost=1.5MCr, Power=0.5 MW, Volume=3Kl, Weight=6tons 
Torpedo=1.5Kl. 
    I realize this is full of holes, but for what it\'s worth, here 
it is.  I would greatfully appreciate any input. 
 
Scott Kellogg 
 
P.S.      Going over this design has made me appreciate just how 
inadequate the design rules are in giving the full feel of a ship.
The rules go down to devices costing tens of credits, tenths of 
liters, hundreds of watts, and tenths of kilograms.  Previously, 
this prompted me to think that if a device isn\'t listed it just 
ain\'t there.  When craft cost in units of millions it\'s easy to 
just say, "Sure!  You must have several airlocks on board."  But 
when you look in the listed craft description there are usually a 
lot of omissions of components you would have taken for granted. 
 
Now I\'m more of a mind to take craft descriptions as general 
guidelines, not gospel.

Remarks:  "The \'Atlantic\' class heavy cruiser is typical of the
Imperial designs for such ships:  a long flattened structure
studded with weaponry, flaring aft for rudimentary control surfaces
useful in fuel skimming.  Well-armed and well-armored, it fulfills
the basic design requirement of meeting the enemy and winning in
battle.
 
    The \'Atlantic\' class, however, is fast approaching obsolesence,
and is not the equal of more modern vessels in the Imperium and
neighboring regions.  The slight disadvantage of 5-G acceleration
and agility 5 (sic) are telling in otherwise equal engagements, and
make the class inferior enough to affect strategic judgements
concerning its commitment.
 
    An upgrade program to enhance the class was considered, but
decided against because of cost, although a number of enhanced
prototypes have been reported.
 
    The class of cruiser has lately proven popular with the Navy
for independant missions, especially beyond the Imperial borders. 
Used alone, the ships are capable of a variety of diplomatic and
scientific operations.  Used in squadrons, they provide a useful
show of force or reinforcement for friendly client-states.  The
ship\'s cargo hold can be used to barrack up to 100 marines for
small commando operations, boarding parties and general ship
defence.
 
    Reportedly, some examples of the \'Atlantic\' class have been
fitted with black globe force field generators.  This has not been
confirmed.
 
    Construction:  \'Atlantic\' class heavy cruisers were produced
by a variety of yards throughout the Imperium, including within the
Spinward Marches.  Ling Standard Products constructed four examples
at Mora/Mora in the period 1020 to 1030.  The last \'Atlantic\' to
be produced first flew in 1050 at Deneb.
 
    A total of 794 ships were ultimately produced, of which
approximately 500 remain in service.  Depending on progress in
current ship construction, and on the remain in service.  Depending
on progress in current ship construction, and on the astrographic
region, the \'Atlantic\' class heavy cruiser may be considered a
first line or a second line ship.  They are being phased into
second line assignments by the Navy as rapidly as newer vessels can
be obtained.
 
    Transfer:  Approximately sixty examples of the \'Atlantic\' class
have been transferred, sold, or disposed of to client states of the
Imperium.  Recipients include several Vargr nations along the
Corridor, Aslan colonial governments allied with or friendly to the
Imperium, and many local human worlds within the Imperium.      -
Supplement 9:  Fighting Ships
 
    The Atlantic figured heavily in an old Traveller\'s Digest

    'body' => 'Jim Baranski asks about frequency of shipping in the Traveller universe, and
suggests that it would be similar to the sixteenth century on earth in many
respects. Yes but...

Since I have read more than I care to think about on the subject of trade and
economics from antiquity to the early renaissance (in pursuit of putting
together a working model for use in fantasy and war games), a better analogy
is probably caravan trade.  Sea-borne trade carried a lot of bulk goods over
coastal routes (e.g. Polish grain to France) because of the low expense of
shipping versus land transport.  Caravans were so expensive that only the
highest value luxury goods could be carried along.  Which version of things
we will model our revised economy on depends, as someone pointed out recently,
on how economical starships are to operate.

As far as planetary self-sufficiency goes, the most important factor to consider
is probably population rather than tech level.  If you have a planetary
population in the billions (9+) there is no way, no matter how cheap star travel gets, that they are going to be able to depend on imports for the necessities
of civilization.  Buy high tech weapons from the planet two jumps over, yes.
Import bananas for the wealthy, yes.  Import wheat or iron ore? No.  Planets
with populations of less than 100 million start to resemble, economically,
single nations on present earth, and probably would have export specialties.
I have always figured that a "Non-industrial" planet might still export
small specialty manufactured goods, and the concept of an "agricultural"
planet comletely covered with farms deserves to be relegated to the same scrap
bin for low imagination as "swamp worlds", "desert worlds", and so forth.  The
simplest planetary ecology is not going to be summed up in one word
(except perhaps, "Vacuum world").  Anyway, I\'d like to see the trade system
take into account the population as being a major variable in determining the
quantity of trade.  Some examination of the balance of trade issue should be
considered as well.

Now from a gamemaster\'s standpoint, I\'d be interested to know how this all 
translates into an answert to the question "If I walk into a class B starport
on a Pop 7 world jump-2 from its nearest neighbor, how often can I expect to
find a departing starship?".  I tried one time to come up with a little 
estimate of total merhcant ship tonnage in a region, based on an estimate of the
fraction of a planetary Groos Product provided by trade (using Trillion Credit
Squadron), and came up with things like 3-4 thousand merhcant ships of various
sizes plying the Sword Worlds subsector.  Seemed high, but when I built 
navies for the Sword Worlds with TCS/High Guard, Narsil, a Pop 10 world, ended
up with 300 100,000ton battleships, and 800 or 900 supporting ships down to
2000tons in size.  Maybe.  The Traveller Adventure gave one the impression that
ships were pretty common.  Ah well, enough random thoughts on that.

been pointed out on the list that a minimum armor of 40 for a spacefaring
craft is ridiculously high, I thought I would take a quick look at the pressure
vessel calculations in my chemical engineering references.  

As two sample calculations, I considered a cylindrical pressure vessel capable
of containing one standard atmosphere of pressure (14.7psi)  <Sorry about the
English units--I\'m an engineer>.  I considered it to be made of mild steel,
with no special alloys, etc, giving a yield strnght of approximately 50,000psi.
I also ignored end cap effects.  I decided that a safety factor of 2.5 was 
sufficient, so I put in a value of 20,000psi as the maximum allowable stress
in the skin.  At those conditions, a cylinder 10ft in diameter would need a wall
thickness of less than 0.05 inches, which is less than Traveller armor value
1.  A 100ft diameter cylinder (ship sized) would require a wall thickness
of 0.44 inches, about Traveller armor value, between Traveller armor values 3
and 4.  50,000psi mild steel would be the equivalent of armor type A (soft
steel).

The result of this little investigation would suggest that vacuum resistance is 
not a valid reason to retain an Armor 40 minimum for spacecraft.  Is anyone out
there capable of figuring out how thick a cylinder has to be to support its
own weight at up to 6Gs?  (I\'ve probably got it around here somewhere.)  This
would give us an idea of how much structural strength would be required to
resist acceleration. (assuming that the weights of interior components more or
less included the structural members necessary to brace them...)

more meaningful -- James]

While we are on the subject of weapons (i.e., mayhem), I have a subject
I thought might interest people.  One of my biggest problems in designing
a combat system (something I would not wish on my worst enemies...well,
maybe a couple of \'em) is that the system seems to break down in the 
medium range between weapons clearly designed for people and those clearly
designed for vehicles.  If you use a straight multiplication to determine
damage from muzzle energy, etc., you get something that means no one can
survive being hit by a rifle round--true, rifle rounds do produce a lot
of damage, but much of it ends up being wasted...literally, blowing through
the person and on into the air or space behind him.  If you try to use a
curve of some kind, you generally get better results, overall, but you 
always seem to get an realm of vehicles and/or weapons that seem either
overprotected or underpowered.  For example, using my system, a full battle
tank with case-hardened steel armor (most contemporary tanks) has armor
protection up to 200 points (300 in front), and its 50-ton body gives it
about 240 points of "body."  A tac missile (TOW, etc.) generally does
between 300 and 600 points of damage, depending on the type.  Since you
need twice the body of a vehicle to destroy it (the first level is for
disabling it, but not so badly it could not eventually be repaired), this
means you need between 700 and 800 points to utterly destroy it.  Now,
you can get this with a TOW-type missile with a lucky shot (maximum for
the three kinds of weapons, including double damage for very good shots,
are respectively 864, 1152, and 1728 points), but from what I have heard,
the average shot of a TOW should do a tank pretty well. 

Now, of course, it cannot be very good for the player characters inside
the tank who take a couple of hundred points of damage, if they are hit by
what is left of the blast after penetration (which my system tells you to
check for), and there is also the chance that fuel or ammunition will be
hit, and perhaps this is why the TOW is so dangerous, since most of its
damage is in the form of extreme heat.  Perhaps this is what is meant by
"a killed tank"--it does not matter to the crew inside the tank that their
vehicle could eventually be rebuilt, even after a bad hit, if they are
now crispy critters.

Is the system underpowering weapons?  Perhaps...but under the same system,
the average 15-ton fighter aircraft it blown right out of the sky by a single
missile hit, unless it is an enormously unlucky shot.

I have "solved" the problem by adding fudge rules that say the GM can declare
any hit that penetrates the hull of a vehicle to do crippling or killing
damage (which is very useful for getting rid of NPCs once the plot no longer
requires them).  I do not really like this, but it seems to be the best way
to keep my system both fairly realistic and playable.

I was wondering if anyone else had similar problems, suggestions, comments,
etc.

Well, depending on how you like to do things, you could always configure your 
as a spaceplane, and land with the assistance of wings and an air breathing
engine of some sort, or for that matter, land as a glider.  \'Course, you only
get one chance...(-:

P.S.  There are a number of potentially useful technologies that Traveller\'s
reliance on grav manipulation overshadows.  Laser launch systems and 
beanstalks are two that spring immediately to mind.

He suggests that caravans made a better model for star trading then water
shipping.  He mentioned that sea shipping was quite a bit cheaper then
caravans, especially in bulk.  I agree with him mostly, but I am wondering why
expensive cargos were shipping in caravans then ships?  Why wasn\'t all shipping
(where possible) done by sea; was there any advantages to shipping by caravans.
Was it substantially quicker, so that expensive cargos could have a quick
turnaround?

Will space trading have a similiar dichotomy?  I can see that in a system
economy, bulk cargos may be shipped on long minimum energy orbits in unmanned
freighters taking years to reach their destination at certain TL.  More
important cargos will be sent on faster conventional ships.  Is a similiar
scenario possible with interstellar trade?  Will this happen regardless of TL?

Rob mentions that population is a big factor in self sufficiency.  I agree that
the important factor is the size of the economy involved, and population is
probably a good measure of this.  I touched on this in mentioning the amount
that a system was developed mattered.  

The population will determine how high a TL a planet can support, and the
amount of trade per population can determine how much TL can be imported.  Can
we put this in the rules?  This way we can describe how well equiped a high
tech, but only just planted colony is; and where the native TL meets the
imported TL on what economic level.

I in general agree that a planet ecology can\'t literally be summed up in one
word.  non-industrial planets will still export *some* things that only are
made there (for whatever reasons).  An Argicultural world, I would imagine
could  exist only if there is an special argicrop (ie spice) which is only
grown there.  (or else the planet has for some reason decided to stay at a low
TL world where the majority economics is providing for their own *basic* needs
such as food)  The same thing for \'mining\' worlds, etc.  Bulk products will be
shipped only if there is something special about the product.

In shipping between planets/systems of different TL, think about shipping
between the US and SA or AF.  There is *very* little technology in some parts
of AF and SA.  This would be even worse in space trade because I don\'t think
we\'d have the massive trading of stuff *to* the US that we have now: bannannas,
coffee, oil, etc.

Let\'s see... you say that Narsil a 10 billion pop world (or am I off a place?)
had 300 100Kton battleships, etc?  this sounds *very* high to me.  We have,
what, 5 billion on earth here, and we have a couple of orbiters.  granted the
difference in TL is substantial, and I may be off a digit of pop, but I still
think it\'s high for a planet, even for an entire developed system.  and these
are just militery ships.

I can\'t imagine how this is economically possible.  what do you suppose is the
maximum population of an earth-like planet, anyway?  surely it goes up with TL.
You can synthesize food, and recycle metals.  How long before you have to
recycle water and air in the same fashion, and the planet becomes a large space
ship???  (wow, what a concept!)

I have a hard time relating to such megatonnage shipping between the stars as a
matter of course.  I more likely expect that the average 5 billion pop planet
is likely to have 1000 1000 ton ships...  maybe a good guideline would be ship
tons equal to the pop for military & commercial ships owned & operated there?
With a variance from nothing to double for some planets?

I remember thinking that there was a lot of usefull economc stuff in TCS, but I
don\'t remember how realistic it was.

necessary to maintain the separation of the multiple wall layers, potential 
effect of inertial compensators on the whole mess, and so on, I realized that
there would be no simple way to calculate any sort of answer.  However, the
Armor 40 equivalent would appear to be way too high, and something like an 
armor 8 minimum might be more "verisimilitudinous".  (Feel more realistic)

Judging by bits and pieces of things I\'ve run across about the Long Duration
Exposure Facility hauled back from orbit earlier this year, I\'d expect that
even a minimally armored structure would last for many years in normal space--
which could probably be ignored for normal gaming purposes.  Now if someone w
wants to suggest that we should put a minimum thickness on starship hulls to
account for resistance to whatever wierd stresses one might experience in
hyperspace, I\'ll go along with the idea.

(esp. if you consider a spacecraft lifetime of 50+ years)
and the average damage from a collision will be greater due
to larger particle size.  Minimum design standards would
reflect this.

You\'re right, recoil does have a VERY strong effect on a combatant in
zero-G.  My comments (above) were strictly addressing combatants on
a planetary surface, or some other "gravitized" location.  Within
that limitation, I still stand by those statements.  And I still maintain
that gyros do nothing to reduce recoil; they only damp the rotational
effect it has on a weapon.  A weapon that isn\'t already "Low Recoil"
won\'t be helped by gyros, if used in zero-G.  The combatant will still
get thrown all over the place.

As for a weak person holding the weapon, or someone holding it improperly,
I doubt that gyros would help either of those folks, either.  A weak
person needs gravitics to reduce the weight of the weapon AND it\'s
recoil (ala PGMPs).  A person holding the weapon improperly deserves
the broken fingers and/or shoulder-blade. :-)  Again, I suppose
gravitics would help there also.

In fact, that\'s EXACTLY what Iain and I are doing.  For the initial pass
of the TDR combat rules, we are not considering the recoil effect of a
weapon on a person in zero-G.  It should be an easy thing to tack on
after the more weighty problems get resolved (like cover and auto-fire,
right, Iain?). :-)  However, in our combat system, recoil has a very
definite effect on ROFs for single shot weapons and on accuracy of
auto-fire weapons.

I\'m sure you\'re right that the recoil factors are given just as reference
for the Ref. in zero-G combat, since they don\'t appear to have any effect
on the "to hit" or "damage" rolls in current MT combat.

Yes, Jim.  TDR work IS going to be done separate from TML.  That\'s the
whole idea.

We\'ve already seen a fair amount of evidence that not every TML reader
IS interested in TDR.  Also, while lots of interesting ideas get thrown
out on the TML, nothing very concrete every seems to come of it.  With
SIGS, on the other hand, you\'ve got a group of people who are dedicated
to a very specific goal.  You also have a lot less background noise.
By way of example, working separate from the TML, Iain Fogg and I are
almost finished with a first draft of a personal combat system for TDR.
Folks have been bitching about MT combat on the TML for as long as I
can remember, but what rule changes have you seen generated as a result?
(BTW, for the rest of you TDR combat SIG members, it\'s only a first draft.
Iain and I are going to circulate it in the SIG about the middle of next
week, just as soon as I enter the changes from our last debate.  Then
you all can rip it to shreds.) :-)

Every government and large commercial organization does exactly the
same thing.  You create special committees to work on specific problems.
Then, when they produce a potential solution, you offer it to the
larger group (TML, in this case) for comments and a vote.  That\'s
exactly what we\'re doing here.

This is my point.  I wouldn\'t mind following the vehicle design debates,
or the trade & commerce discussions.  But I rarely would expect to have
any worthwhile input, and I\'d probably only save the final result.  Why
give a lot of people the opportunity to frequently interrupt a group of
focused individuals when those interruptions might seriously slow down
the production of something useful?  If an individual is interested
enough to offer SIGNIFICANT input to a SIG, then they should join it,
not just kibitz.

> PS failing that, put me one all the TDR mailing list.

I won\'t do that, Jim, and here\'s why:

They\'re not mailing lists, per se, since no one is responsible for
making a broadcast (like James does for TML).  It\'s just to let
each member of a SIG know who else to send to, so as to solicit
feedback (LOTS of feedback).  If you are particularly interested
in one or more of the areas, and feel you have something useful to
contribute, then join a SIG (or SIGs), by all means.  But if you
just want to listen in and occasionally kick out an idea, you\'re
better off waiting for a draft from the SIG to come out.  The
members of the SIG are better off too.

If it sounds like I\'m trying to discourage you, you\'re partially
right.  We want dedicated, involved people in the SIGs, who plan
to devote an obscene amount of time to producing new rules for TDR.
We\'re not expecting complete new rule sets overnight, but we would
like to see some tangible results during this presidental administration. :-)

If you\'d like to get involved, send me a list of the SIGs you
want to join (not all of them, for heavens sake!) and I\'ll add
you to them.  I\'ll also make sure that all the other SIG members
know you\'ve joined.

BTW, for the TML at large, I\'m no longer going to announce new
SIG members to the entire readership, since only the current
members of a given SIG need to be advised.  If anyone is interested
in the current membership of a particular TDR SIG, send me a letter
and I\'ll let you know.

Remarks:  Used by Imperial Navy and Scout forces the \'Watcher\'
series is usually deployed from an Air/Raft bay.  Four \'Watcher\'s
can be stored in a bay.  With its fuel scoops it can spend up to
a year inside a gas giant\'s atmosphere or submerged in an ocean
before requiring maintenance.
 
    It can operate autonomously or under direction by other forces
in system using its extensive communications and encryption
software as well as its extensive electronic counter measures to
prevent it\'s being detected or reprogrammed by enemy forces.
 
    The most frightening thing about the \'Watcher\' is its patience. 
It can be dropped into an enemy held gas giant and just sit there. 
Its small size makes it extremely difficult to find, making a gas
giant very dangerous to refuel from.  The drone will not attack
until it has either a clear advantage or a high value target in a
bad position, like a battleship in the act of fuel skimming.

Remarks:  A TL 15 smart weapon.  The \'Lurker\' is used primarily by
Imperial ground forces.  The Army and Marines use it for patrols,
guard duty, harassment raids as well as systematic search and
destroy missions.  The \'Lurker\' never tires.  All it uses is
ordinance.  It emerged late in the Fifth Frontier War were its
tactics were honed.  Typically, the Marines would set one up with
four HEAP cluster bombs and send it to seek out battle dress
troops.
 
    The drone\'s fuel scoops allow it to remain on patrol for
extended periods provided it has access to water.  Because of it\'s
endurance, the \'Lurker\' inflicted casualties on Zhodani morale and
severely damaged the Vargr offensives.  They could arrive at any
moment with a special delivery package.  Psychologically, it is one
of the worst situations to be hunted by a machine.  It has no
sympathy, no pride, no worries, no hate, no mercy; it sees you only
as a target to be killed.

    'body' => '     Here\'s a problem for y\'all to tackle:  Does anyone know of a program
(or at least the necessary formulae for writing such a program) to
determine what the view looks like of an arbitrary solar system from the
surface of one of the bodies within that solar system at a given time?
     For instance, consider the Regina system.  It consists, first of all,
of a trinary star system.  One star is the primary, one star is a brown
dwarf orbiting the primary at close range, and the third is a far companion
orbiting the primary at a range beyond the orbit of the outermost planet.
     In orbit about the primary (and its brown dwarf companion) are 5
planets, including 2 gas giants.  In orbit about the far companion are 4
planets, including 1 gas giant.  Two of the planets orbiting the primary
have satellites, one with 3, the other with 5.  Similarly, two of the
planets orbiting the far companion have satellites, again, one with 3 and
the other with 5.
     Regina is one of the satellites orbiting a large gas giant that orbits
the primary.  So, if you were standing on Regina, looking up into the sky,
what would you see?
     Presumably the other planets wouldn\'t be visible, at least not as
anything other than points of light.  But what about the other 4 satellites
orbiting the same gas giant which Regina orbits?  How well would they be
visible during the day?  During the night?  What about the gas giant
itself?  How large would it appear from the surface of Regina?  What
about the primary star?  What would it look like at that distance?  Would
it merely be an exceptionally bright star, or would it look more like Sol
does from Terra?  The brown dwarf would presumably be invisible in the
glare of the primary, but what about the far companion?  Furthermore, how
much light does Regina receive during the day?  When the primary disappears
behind the gas giant, as it probably will every Reginan month, the primary
is eclipsed.  How long does that eclipse last?  Presumably far longer than
the eclipses we have here on Terra.  That could be a VERY significant
feature of Reginan life (and covert actions).  And when it is night and the
gas giant is in the sky as a "full planet", how much light is reflected
onto Regina?  Is it a "false day"?  If so, that too would have a
significant effect upon how covert actions are conducted, as there would be
a period of each month in which the cover of darkness doesn\'t exist.

     I know that there are programs that show the positions of the planets
in our solar system or how the night sky appears at various times, but I
haven\'t seen anything which allows the user to enter data about an entirely
fictional solar system and then pick a location from which to see the view.
Having a picture of the view would be nice, of course, but all I would
really need would be a text description of the situation.  Any suggestions?

P.S. By the way, I think I\'d be interested in helping with any MT GM aid
program writing.  My only problem would be finding enough time to do it,
but count me in for now.

    'body' => 'Dean talks about caravans being a good model for space travel and there has
been some conjecture to this.  Also, people have been wondering what would
prompt shipping of goods from other systems.

A few reasons why I think people will be dispersed throughout space, receiving
goods from other planets.  

1)Overpopulation.   The population on planets exceeds whatever TL exists in
the food industry.  Either population control is instituted or people are
forced into space.  One other way would be to import extra food from other
planets.  As we are seeing today, large corporate farms are an extremely
profitable method of food production.  A high scale of automation combined
with a huge amount of working area can provide food for many people at
relatively low cost (which translates to profitable business).

Finding a large amount of land in one area would be easy of the planet had
a low population, or low population in select areas.  Either way, the
number of people on the planet do not exist to make business profitable .

2)The necessary support industry is not available and would be too costly
to transplant.
  Unless you are providing a very basic good you will need support
industries to provide you with your raw materials.  In the same light, the
people who manufacture raw materials need the other industry as customers.
Today, we have an extensively integrated industry, but this has grown from
smaller and smaller manufacturing facilities as the demand increased.
  Raw materials plants today are being constructed to produce a huge amount
of material.  One example is maleic anhydride which is used in a number of
petroleum products (lubricants, paints , etc).  Maleic anhydride is
manufactured from benzene and usually using a vanadium oxide catalyst, but
it always goes to be made in other products.  I read a report about a plant
being contructed to produce a 100 Million tons per year, which will cost
investors about 120 million dollars in three years.
  A plant like this could not be easily built on a remote planet unless the
buyers were already there, or the source (in this case : benzene) could be
easily provided and there were buyers elsewhere.


  One thing I am assuming is that space transport will be a cheap industry.
In the Traveller universe we can see this: there is extensive mining and
manufacturing in space to make the construction of space vessels relatively
cheap.

  Land caravans were used instead of sea transport because of the danger
and thus relatively costly expense of sea transport.  Improved navigation
techniques allowed for faster and relatively safer (less chance of getting
lost) routes.  Also, there were many areas that could not be easily reached
by sea, and would need a land caravan anyway.  People who already had the
resources of a land caravan were used from certain cities, as opposed to
going to theoretically closest city and hoping to get transport.  Improved
transportation techniques and the development of roads changed this too.

  Additionally, once you get a space faring population why would there be
interest in transplanting a whole society and making it self sufficient?
This would be extremely costly and unattractive to everone but the
extremely wealthy (individuals and organizations).

  In conclusion, I think that as a society on a planet gets older and more
populated it will become more and more self-sufficient, but because of its
initial integration with off planet business it will always have trade with
off-planet interests.

Well, a fusion drive flame will be *very* concentrated. Check any of
the Med Ship stories by Leinster. When landing or taking off
unassisted, the drive flame will cheerfully burn holes in the ground. 
But they\'ll be *small* holes, compared with the size of the ship.

No, reaction drives will work just fine. It\'s just that some people
hear "reaction drive" and think of our current *chemical* rockets. A
fusion rocket uses 1/1500 of the fuel. So they *do have reasonable fuel
requirements, and endurance. I checked the original rules, and a type-S
scout would *still* be able to run it\'s manuever drive at full throttle
for a week if you assume it is a fusion rocket! Or ships should have
similar endurances.

Excuse me? I know of *no* other alternatives.

Anyway, here are some figures that should put this in perspective.

Using the "standard" figure of 600,000 for the specific impulse of a
fusion drive, a 1000 ton *mass* ship (not 1000 tons displacement, which
is what Traveller uses) would need 864 tons of fuel to run it\'s drive
at 6 gs for an entire day. Or only 144 tons at 1g. 

Re: unrefined fuel

Please note that since the Pioneer and Voyager missions, the outer
planet are now considered to have atmospheres of impure hydrogen. Ie
hydrogen with methane, ammonia, etc present as *impurities*. The reason
we used to think they were *mostly* methane and ammonia, is that those
are the only components that show up easily on a spectrogram of the
planet taken from Earth.

There\'s just enough *non* hydrogen in Jupiter\'s atmosphere to be a
nuisance. I think Neptune and Uranus may actually have moderate
percentages of compounds as atmospheric components at high altitudes, 
but even there, you are still dealing mostly with hydrogen.

I\'ve just finished some routines to handle tables, such as RPGs use.
I\'m going to post them to alt.sources soon, but I\'d like a little
"pre testing" just to make sure they come out of the shar files OK.

The routines are designed to write character generation programs, but
should be useful for lots of other RPG type applications.  There are
routines to read in tables, print them, free them, and use them in
several different ways.  In addition there are some dice rolling routines
which take text strings like "2d4+2" or "1d100" and roll them.  The
table routines are designed to be object oriented, so you can add new
types of tables, and new operations on tables fairly easily.
Finally, there are two simple applications, a computer buzzphase generator
and a cyberpunk style name generator.

If you find these routines interesting, then please grab them from my 
archive server and play with them a little in the next week.  Send me email
if there are any problems.  To get the files you must send two seperate 
message to the server.  Both should contain a path command, one should 
have a ``send programs table03a.shar\'\', and the other ``send programs 
table03b.shar\'\'.  For example, if Saddam Hussen wanted them, his two
email messages would look like this:

path saddam@army.iraq.middle-east.earth
send programs table03a.shar

path saddam@army.iraq.middle-east.earth
send programs table03b.shar

Or something like that.

There\'s another reason for armouring the ship.   Let\'s take a ship and
accelerate it at 1G for one day.  At the end of the day, its speed is
9.8 * 24 * 60 * 60 = 846720 m/s.  Now let\'s assume that a small bit of
rock hits it.  Unless it\'s fairly well armoured, the small bit of rock
will pass through it and its occupants with somewhat greater ease than
a gauss rifle needle would pass through a piece of paper.

Mark\'s Handbook of Mechanical Engineering (remember that I am a chemical ^H

Since I have commented on usage rates of nuclear fission fuel in the past, I
felt that I should look things up to see what was really what.  If I am reading
the numbers correctly, and using the density of fuel as given in the referee\'s
manual, and assuming that we are using this fission pile to generate electricity
by steam turbine, and assuming that we are using fuel enriched to 5% fissionable
material, burning it dwon to 1% fissionable material, and that you achieve a
30% efficiency on conversion of heat released to electrical energy (reasonable),
it would appear that your fuel consumption should be about .0013 kl/year/MW.
My first guess, to make things come out right, was to assume that the number
given, .003 kl/MW was per year, which looks like it wasn\'t a bad guess.  

This means that in order to keep fusion competitive, we really need to increase
its fuel efficiency by a couple of orders of magnitude.

I was reminded of this when the latest issue of Challenge (#47) came this 
weekend, with two short adventures using low tech level spacecraft designed
per the rules in Challenge #45, and the nuclear fuel outweighed the ion
reaction mass in the ion drive module by a factor of 30 or 40 to 1.

ships I have uploaded using Charles Gannon\'s low-TL space design sequence
have been reasonable.)

My two cents on a variety of things -

"Robert S. Dean" <rsdean@crdec8.apgea.army.mil> says:

Personally, I like this format.  It adds uniformity and readability.  I would
like to see more robots.  No offense to vehicle designers but I, at least
for now, have more use/need for robots and small starships (less than
2500 tons).  My players are not interested in military activity and large
starships are out of their reach.

Speaking of scheduled releases, has anyone heard anything about the new
adventure that\'s coming out (soon?) called "On the Edge" (I think)?  It
set in the Spinward Marches but usable anywhere.  Its due out in \'91 and
that\'s all I\'ve heard so far.

About Trade/shipping:

With respect to Jim Baranski\'s posts (1869 and 1879) I agree.  It seems to
me that a planet\'s import/export market will be driven by population,
tech level, and trade classification.  Large populations are needed for the
work force to mine raw materials, to manufacture finished products, to 
grow food/livestock, or to consume finished products and food/livestock.
The tech level will influence the desirability of an item.  Why use TL8
computers if you could get TL15!  The trade classification indicates that
planets speciality or needs.

The comment that all planets will have raw material (unless it has been
used up already as may be the case on an old planet like Terra) is 
generally okay but you can have planets/systems that are low in heavy 
elements.  These systems will not be origin worlds for life (since life
is filled with heavy elements like iron) but may be colonized (why?).
If the system is a second or third generation system (ie was formed very
early in the life of the galaxy) there would be little heavy elements
present and they would be deep in the core of the planet.  Heavy elements
all come from stellar deaths (basically) so early on few stars would have
died so forming systems would be poor in heavy elements.  A planet in this
predicament would probably be poor and have to import *everything*!  On the
other hand, the gas giants of such a system would be very pure.  They 
could be the source of some of the cheapest fuel in the Imperium!

Looking back over what Jim wrote and what I just wrote brings up an
interesting point.  Trade is using *during* the game that means it needs
to be a quick resolution type system.  Your players don\'t want to sit
around on their hands while you determine what a planet has to offer.
Maybe there should be a simple, reasonable system for routine use or for
players who aren\'t interested in trade as the main theme for a game and
an advanced, expanded version for times when that is called for kind
of like the starship operators manual.  For the streamlined version
maybe a variation on the MT version or the Classic Traveller version
could be used.  Just make a couple of patches to the most glaring holes.

What about Cargo?  Do you mean to imply that some average weight should
be assumed for acceleration calculations or should you recalculate with
each cargo run or ignore cargo?  Otherwise (after a brief once over) it
looks good to me!  I am glad to see that you didn\'t start over from
scratch but rather fixed the existing system.  I don\'t want to learn an
entirely new game, I just want some of the holes filled!

Two things: First I been looking in the various MT books and have come to
the conclusion that when they say "reactionless" they mean using no
reaction mass or no exhaust.  A variation on anti-gravity technology or 
the like.  Second anti-gravs are reaction drives (they push against gravity)
but aren\'t destructive (no flatten houses or people when one flys by).

for me with sf games is that they mostly ignore the real impact of space
industrialization.  Even if only one percent of a planetary population
likes being in space, what will happen in the long run is that their
children will grow up thinking of living in habitats as natural, so they
will expand into space rather than go back to a planet.  

The resource base is pretty simple.  A fully developed solar system could
have five or ten billion people on a planet, but hundreds of billions living
in habitats near asteroids, around gas giants, or in the cometary halo.

The "geography" of such solar systems would resemble an ocean full of 
archipelagos, hundreds of large groups of habitats, each centered around a
resource base like an asteroid.  Each archipelago might have thousands of
individual habitats (L5-type city-states with anywhere from ten thousand
to ten million people apiece...my own estimates are a low end of 40,000
and a high end of 1,000,000, but you could build larger or smaller and 
get away with it).  Trade in such a society would be limited by the
demands of physics.  Fusion-powered spacecraft will be very cheap once
we get fusion under control (matter-antimatter is more fuel efficient,
but with fusion the fuel is hydrogen, which is very plentiful)...well,
cheap in relative terms, spacecraft will still be expensive, but fusion
drives will be very efficent.  For most ship designs, most of an 
inner solar system (Earth-to-Ceres, etc.) will be a matter of a week
or two of travel (assuming you don\'t use jump drives for intrasystem
travel) and a few weeks to the outer system (Earth-to-Neptune, etc.)
and several months to several years for parts of the cometary halo.

In other words, sailing ships of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries,
and, to some extent, steamers of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.
And a society that would resemble, in some ways, Europe, if it were
broken up into physically separate power blocs...or what the world
might be like the centers of culture were as divided as they are now
(Europe, America, China, etc.) but we only had 1800-1900 sailing/steaming
technology for travel.

By the way, I use a figure of 1 million for the Isp for fusion drives 
(about what the Daedelus project people suggested), and 20 million for
matter-antimatter drives (which is a bit more than what Charles Sheffield
suggests, but easier to deal with in games terms than the 18 million he
proposed).  (Much easier to do the numbers this way, and it does not
affect the realism of the game in any significant manner.)  The average
spacecraft in my game world uses 30% of its mass for fuel, which, at 
one gravity, gives it 352,000 seconds of thrust, which means spacecraft
will go to about 1,600 km./sec., and then coast at about one billion km./
week until they are ready to slow down, and then slow down (this leaves
a 10% reserve of fuel for mid-course corrections, etc.)

I will admit to vanity when I say this, but I really like the way I have
worked this out because it means that every single fully developed solar
system (Tech 11 or Tech 12 or more) is an enormously exciting place, with
the equivelent of dozens or even hundreds of worlds in every solar system.
Imagine, fellow GMs, the kind of intrigues you can have, with dozens of
powerful governments and megacorporations vying for influence, vying to
control the lives of half-a-trillion people, and this is what goes on in
every single solar system in your game world.  (And, if you like complex
and paranoia-inducing plots, remember that at this level of complexity,
you have governments and corporations so complex, and with so many levels
in their hierarchy, that different branches will be trying to screw each
other over...)

Enjoy.

To the best of NASA\'s knowledge, the LDEF was never hit by anything larger
than a pinhead in two years of flight orbiting around the Earth. To use
this, and other data from man\'s limited exploration of his universe so far,
to make guesses at how a Traveller starship must be armored, isn\'t a good
idea. In my opinion, the 40-minimum should be preserved in any economically
viable ship design, for essentially one reason: high-velocity fragments.

The odds of getting hit by an asteroid larger than a sand grain on a trip
through the Asteroid Belt in our system at relatively low speeds (Voyager
took years to get to Jupiter, you do the math) are infinitesimal. But what
about a ship that plies a thousand different star systems or more for well
over a century, often at near-relativistic speeds? At a rough guess, once
a year or so it\'d go through a Trojan point or meteor swarm in a hurry, and
run a very real chance of something fairly big striking fairly fast. And if
you don\'t think a ten-gram impact getting turned into energy would hurt a 
ship with a 1-inch-thick skin of aluminum alloy plating and honeycomb core
(std. NASA design), think again. The entire starship combat system of another
game I admire intensely, ALBEDO, is based on what happens to a ship if a half
dozen small chunks of metal impact on it at near lightspeed. (In fact, if one
were to follow the economic logic of Dow Rieder\'s Robot Drone Missile Swarm
system, the MT universe and ALBEDO universe would have identical combat 
strategies!) Starships don\'t put that much of their cost in hull armor; even
factor-40 bonded superdense is a pittance compared to the computer and drives.
It\'s good insurance on the part of the manufacturer to see to it that a random
strike won\'t cripple the ship and kill the crew; so I would say that the 40
rating is not a PHYSICAL requirement for construction, but a LEGAL requirement
for minimum safety that an underwriter would insist on before financing the
ship\'s construction. You can build an airliner without firefighting equipment
or onboard oxygen or advanced IFR gear. You\'ll save a bundle. But would you
be able to find a buyer?

Just my two cents\' worth. Thanks to Dow Rieder for his input on this.

wish to volunteer ideas and so on in a noncommittal way. Registry on a SIG is
a player\'s statement that he or she is serious about contributing actual 
material; submissions to TDR itself are the end result of this. So we have a
multi-level discussion going on, with no lowering of involvement at the TML
level. How\'s that sound?

    Admittedly, it is going to be outclassed by almost any
starship, but consider, most starships primarily rely on
electromagnetic and other sensors meant to find targets either in
air or in vacuum.  I can\'t think of many spacecraft that have audio
sensors.  A densitometer might find the sub, but remember the sub
is the same density as the water around it, and besides most
civilian spacecraft don\'t have densitometers either.  Of course if
your players do have accurate sensors you can always throw a wolf
pack at them...  or a battleship...

Remarks:  "The \'Kokirrak\' class dreadnaught is one of the more
common classes of capitol ships in service in the Spinward Marches;
a total of four BatRons of this type serve on permanaent station,
with harbor assignments at Rhylanor, Regina, Jewell, and Mora. 
Generally, one squadron of Kokirraks is dispersed into independant
ships with ancillary escorts.  On patrol, the ships combine
training operations with routine patrols amd reaction operations.
 
    The \'Kokirrak\' is a preferred ship for flagship operations due
to its extensive admiral\'s quarters, which include command and
communications equipment, as well as entertainment chambers.  The
ship is capable of controling a large fleet engagement within a
system, as well as holding its own in battle; the combination of
fleet controller and line-of-battle ship makes it an asset in
nearly any space combat situation.
 
    Troops:  Normally, the \'Kokirrak\'s do not carry troops.  It is
possible to install modular quarters for up to 2,000 troops
(usually only 1,000 are carried) in the cargo hold.  A squadron of
eight \'Kokirrak\'s can carry between 8,000 and 16,000 troops or the
equivalent of a reinforced division.
 
    Black Globe Generators:  This class of dreadnaught, when
originally designed and constructed, mounted black globe force
field generators.  Over the years, various ships have suffered
black globe generator failures, and the devices have not been
replaced.  When encountered, there is approximately a 50% chance
that the ship will mount a functioning black globe (factor-4).
 
    The \'Kokirrak\'s are one of the older classes of dreadnaughts
in Imperial service, and are now being phased out of service. 
Within the last decade, several ships have been disposded of to
other services such as the scouts, and to other governments,
including sector navies and client-states in the Spinward border
regions of the Imperium."   - Supplement 9:  Fighting Ships

I looked back over what I said, and there was one important thing that got 
left out of my remark.  I think that a better analogy for interstellar shipping
than 16th century sea trade would be the pre-15th century caravan trade.  
The critical difference is that by the 16th century you had direct sailing 
routes with these exotic far-off places that provided those goods that you 
were willing to spend enormous amounts of money on, like silk and pepper.  
Ultimately, this decreased the price and made them available to larger 
quantities of people, so that, tea drinking for example, was common in 18th 
Century England despite the fact that every pound of tea was carried thousands
of miles by sea.  A caravan had to make many intermediate stops, as do our 
starships, for the equivalent of refueling.  A sailing ship\'s cruising radius 
was only limited by the amount of food and fresh water it could carry (and 
even water could be obtained), which meant that voyages of many months (and 
even years) were achievable.  This has a strong effect (I think) on the 
economics of the transportation method.  So a caravan, I think, was more like 
our ships--to make a journey lasting months across a desert (space) you had 
to stop frequently (weekly) at towns and oases (planets and star systems) 
along the way.  A sailing ship would be the functional equivalent of a 
starship that needed no jump fuel.

Well, maybe so.  On the other hand, it might well be more economical to 
accept occasional damage and pay for repair costs.  A possible analogy would 
be modern automobile windshields, which could be made of bullet proof glass.  
We don\'t because the odds of getting a stone chip big enough to require 
replacing the window are small enough that it isn\'t worthwhile.  It would 
become even less worthwhile if you could patch your windshield for small 
dings, rather than replace it. As far as this applies to TDR and vehicle rule
redesign, I am more interested in the moment in coming up with reasonable
values than I am in trying to rationalize the odd rules that currently exist.

Wrong.  I don\'t have the mass for a scout handy, but it was close to
1 ton per kl = ~1350 tons for the whole ship.  2 G\'s for a week gives
a net velocity change of  ~12,000 km/sec.  Using the speed of light as an
upper bound for the exhaust velocity we get a minimum mass fraction
of 4% just for reaction mass (totally ignoing energy requirements).  This
gives 54 tons mass needed.  The scout had 20 disp tons of LH2 for the
powerplant and manuver drives = 20 tons mass - not enough.  Check
your math before making specific claims.

Subject: (1908) Shipping: Interstellar Trade: Why?
 
"A few reasons why I think people will be dispersed throughout space, receiving
goods from other planets."
 
"1)Overpopulation.   \'creates a market for food\'

The only cure for overpopulation is population control.  Emigration may have
some effect on it, and feeding it only makes it worse.  I really have a hard
time believing that it\'s economical to feed a planet from another planet as a
matter of course.  You need a *good* reason to have a sizable population on a
planet that can\'t support it.  It makes much more sense to put the people where
the food is.

I agree with you that Traveller seems to assume that space shipping costs are
negligible, but on the other hand, player traders can make out quite well. This
doesn\'t match up.  Run some scenarios past yourself.  Say you have a planet
full of people in one system, and a farming planet in another system.  Assume a
reasonable price for the food, and add in the trading cost, and see what you
get.

"2)The necessary support industry is not available and would be too costly
to transplant."

This does happen out of necessity in small colonies or research stations.
But, given the shipping costs in the players guides, I can\'t see it being
economical to import bulk goods.  small amount of goods will always be traded,
as not much is needed, and it\'s cheaper to trade for that, but the more that
you need something, the more important it is to produce it locally.

"Land caravans were used instead of sea transport because of the danger and
thus relatively costly expense of sea transport."

Whhhhat?  Caravans are more expensive then sea transport, that\'s why bulk goods
are sent by sea.

"Additionally, once you get a space faring population why would there be
interest in transplanting a whole society and making it self sufficient? This
would be extremely costly and unattractive to everone but the extremely wealthy
(individuals and organizations)."

I don\'t know of anyone or any group that wouldn\'t rather be self sufficient if
it\'s economically possible.  Again, you seem to assume that transport is
cheaper then development, which I would argue against.

Rob Dean discusses comparing structural strength of modern and Traveller
spacefaring vehicles... I\'d like to make a few comments.

Current vehicles are very, very fragile.  As are current airplanes.  Given the
amount of use (and type of use) they are subjected to, a better comparason 
would be with a naval ship than with a Space Shuttle.  A naval ship run 
aground in port simply waits for better tide to get off; were a space shuttle
to land off-field, it would be a $2 billion sculpture.  I can\'t imagine
that Traveller ships, indended for in excess of twenty years of nearly c
continuous use, would be built anything but very, very strongly.

Also, problems such as atmospheric re-entry heating have to be taken into 
account... without extensive cooling or insulation, all sorts of problems
occur with thin-skinned vehicles.

Besides, if anyone bothers to figure out gas giant skimming loads and such,
i suspect they\'re going to be um Huge.  [Believe me; one real-world project
I\'m working on is a spacecraft that aerobrakes at Jupiter... 8-) ]

On the other hand, everybody MIGHT have bulletproof glass in their windows
if they ran the risk of breaking one and SUFFOCATING before they got to

     Probably due to differing circumstances.  Back in the last century,
there were good economic reasons for having some ships travel from A to
B as quickly as possible while others were able to take more time
reaching their destinations (presumably, things are still that way--I
don\'t know, since what I know about ocean travel is primarily military).

     In deep space, however...  In one of Larry Niven\'s Known Space
stories (I *think* it\'s "Borderland of Sol"--one with Beowulf Shaeffer,
anyway), the protagonist makes the comment that hyperdrive has only
one speed, and *there is never any reason to dawdle in space*.  Human
beings can adapt to a wider range of environments than most people
would think, but vacuum is notoriously low in vitamin content.  ;-)

     The same factors obtain in the Traveller universe.  There are
different distances that individual jump drives can traverse, but as
far as the ship is concerned, they all move at the same speed:  one
jump per week (assuming quick refueling and a need to get somewhere
in a hurry).  Half that if the ship in question wants to spend some
time in port for trading, laying in supplies, performing simple
repairs, and whatnot.

     There *could* be the equivalent of clipper ships, but that form of
travel would be so ruinously expensive (since the ship won\'t be making
any money along the way) that the cargo had better be *extremely*
valuable (possibly more valuable than I can imagine, and, like Han Solo,
I can imagine a *lot*.  :-) ).

     Actually, now that I think about it a little bit, there *is* (well,
at least *was*) something like a clipper route in the Imperium.  The
IISS operates an _Azhanti_High_Lightning_ class cruiser to do nothing
but carry wine from Earth to Capital for the Emperor\'s table (I\'m told
that tokay is very good, but *really*...).  Note that it takes a *large*
agency of a major government to be able to afford this.

     Now the question becomes "Is there a commodity valuable enough to
justify special multi-jump dedicated shipping?"

the Ref\'s Manual\'s 25tonnes/kl is absurd, as that is the same as a specific

19, and (without looking it up) I think the oxide must be lower.  I dislike it

You have your choice.  What the game currently does with small vehicle .
performance is to calculate it based on the cargo space being completely filled
with water.  This would give you some sort of approximation.  Personally, I\'d
do that, plus calculate an empty accelration in case you need to take off in
a hurry sometime.  I realize that the trade people (are you listening?) will
have to come up with cargo densities if you want to recalculate on the basis 
of each cargo.  You may want to do it...it wouldn\'t take long, especially
if you have a full load of one commodity.

One of the campaigns I ran several years ago was tailor made for
someone who wanted to run characters that were the equivilant of
the owners of the China Clippers.  I had (thanks to one of my
players) a ship design that became very popular within my campaigns
that was a rough analogy to it.  Unfortunately the breifcase that
the design (and its copies) was in turned up missing one fine day
and I lost a lot of good designs as a result.

I agree.  I only use the basic character generator and selected parts from
the advanced sections (such as college and military academys).  I had always
planned to expand slightly the pre-service skills section for the basic
system in a way similar to the college expansion posted a few messages ago.

I have not designed many ships but I don\'t see how you go from thickness to 
armor value (or vice versa).  Again, I have not designed but maybe half a
dozen ships but if I understand things correctly a 100 ton ship occupies a
volume of 1350 cubic meters and has a mass of 40 tons.  Multiply by 33 for an 
armor factor of 40 and by 1.25 for soft steel and you get 1650 tons for weight 
(mass).  I believe a minimum surface polygon enclosing the volume listed would 
be a sphere 685.6172 cm in radius.  I don\'t know the density of steel but the 
specific gravity of iron is about 8 gm/cc (which means the density of steel 
is about the same?).  If you assume a mass of 1,650,000 gms and calculate the
thickness of the skin of the sphere you find it to be 0.0349 cm or about 
0.0137 in.  If the density is greater than 8 gm/cc then the thickness will be
even less.  Somebody check these numbers, you know how bad I am with numbers!
Assuming no miscalculations, wouldn\'t this coupled with your calculations 
mean that the hulls should have a higher armor rating?

True but these limit ships to civilized, high tech planets.  Anti-grav 
allows the ship to come and go when and where it wants (which is good for
smugglers and the like).

If we accept that 40 is a "legal" requirement, or a "nice to be safe" engi-
neering standard (and I\'ll accept either argument as being reasonable), how 
should I handle something like Scott Kellogg\'s space going fighter planes?  If 
you are part of a planet attempting to declare independence from the Imperium, 
or protect itself from Aslan or Vargr invaders (my Spinward Marches bias is 
showing, I know) or whatever...what penalty do I invoke to make you design 
things for high survivability when you only need them for orbital work, or 
only expect them to last for one combat engagement, or whatever other reason 
that you can think of that would lead you to cut corners on "safe" practices? 
I hesitate to say something CAN\'T be doen, when the truth is that it SHOULDN\'T 
be done. With all the disparate cultures of the Imperium, I can readily be-
lieve that there would be some where you could find pilots willing to fly 
unsafe but cheap (and therefore numerous) craft in defense of their homeland.  
Need I mention Japan and the Second Global War as an example from ancient 
Earth history? In a similar line, what about the "triple computer for spacego-
ing craft" rule?  At 60 MCr a unit for Model 9\'s, maybe it\'s worth only put-
ting one in a fighter and accepting the losses.  (My TL15 Lance and Javelin 
fighters had 75% of their cost sunk into a triple computer system--so with one 
computer you could buy twice as many.)

Good Discussion so far...

I like your idea of having system with *large* number of space habitats.
The impact that such a setup would have on trade is that it\'s even more likely
that whatever you need, you can get it within your system, hence an even less
need for trade with other systems, mostly stuff that cannot be duplicated.

RE: Metlay, Armor

You give (micro)asteroid collisions as the reason for ships to have armor 40
minimum.  Let\'s think about this a bit more.  What defenses do ships have
against asteroids?  shields?  not that I\'m aware of.  point defense lasers? we
have those, but I\'ve never heard of any rules or scenarios dealing with
avoiding asteroids or microasteroids.
 
I personally would not like to have my main asteroid defense be how thick my
hull was, because there\'s eventually a bigger asteroid out there with your name
on it!  I\'d want some kind of active defense.  First off some kind of
detection, and then some method for destroying or avoiding the asteroid.  how
small of a asteroid are we likely to be able to detect?  how small of an
asteroid is dangerous?  Is there a set of undetectable, but dangerous
asteroids? maybe I\'ll take the train, yeah...!

PS I agree with all the policy about TML and TDR that\'s been explained...

I think economically, intersystem, it does NOT make sense.  Why? Because
of the cost of idle inventory all those slowboats travelling 30000 AU\'s
or more, means.  Were I doing business, I\'d have no problem paying
multiple times the price for shipping, so my money wouldn\'t be tied up
in enroute waiting.  If I turned 50 times the business with the same
cash, I could pay up to 49 times my profit margin to make the deal and
make the same profit.  Not to mention the capitalization cost of all
those slowboats....

Unless the planet can not grow its own food because of its composition or
atmosphere but turns out to have a fortune if raw materials and is a handy
place to manufacture things (you can\'t breath the air anyway so why waste
time, money, and energy on pollution controls).  Moreover, if people are
hungry and can get the money they WILL PAY ANY PRICE for food no matter
where it comes from (homegrown or imported).  I as a trader do not care about
solving their problems (overpopulation) just in selling them the product that
is currently in demand (food and maybe birth control devices?).

If you can produce it locally.  Sometimes the "need" for something not
locally produced or producable arises against the will of the populace or
as a result of skillful manipulation of the market (ie make them *think*
that they can\'t live without even if they can\'t live with it like cigarettes).

As an example of a different (but not necessarily better) trade system, here
is a brief overview of Star Trek RPG trade system.  There are 8 basic 
catagories into which all trade items fall.  These are:

Foodstuffs and Agricultural Goods         Cr700        100 SCU
Normal Minerals and Raw Materials         Cr1000        70 SCU
Radioactives and Special Minerals         Cr1500        30 SCU
Drugs and Refined Medicinal Agents        Cr2000        50 SCU
Low Tech Manufactured Goods               Cr1200        90 SCU
Medium Tech Manufactured Goods            Cr2000        70 SCU
High Tech Manufactured Goods              Cr2200        50 SCU
Luxury Items                              Cr250 x d10   10 SCU x d10

The number following each catagory represent the base price/scu and the
base consumption/planet.  The SCU is Standard Cargo Unit (ie a ton in MT).
Each planet is given a rating in each catagory to represent its interest in
those items.  Low ratings imply an abundance of the items (like they\'re made
or grown there) a high rating implys a low supply and a great demand.  There
are 8 ratings starting at 0.25 and increasing by 0.25 up to 2.00.  The trick
then is to buy on a planet with a low rating in a catagory and transport the
cargo to a planet with a high rating.  For example buying iron on a planet
with a rating of 0.75 would cost Cr750/ton, selling it on a planet with a
rating of 1.5 would get you Cr1500/ton.  While you can buy as much as you
like how much you can sell depends on the base consumption.  In the example
above you could sell 70 tons to the planet at Cr1500/ton the next 70 tons or 
part thereof would by sold at one step lower (1.25) or Cr1250/ton, the next 70 
tons would be at Cr1000/ton and so on.  This is to reflect saturation of the 
market.  Population comes into play as a multiplier of the base consumption.
Very high pop planets multiply consumption by 4, high pop by 2, moderate pop
by 1, low by 0.5, very low by 0.25, and colony or station by 0.1.

Player skills are used to adjust the "apparent" interest a planet has in a
given catagory.  During purchase a successful roll would decrease the rating
by one step, a extreme failure would increase it by one.  On the selling planet
success would increase the rating by one and extreme failure would decrease it
by one.  Other skills could adjust the demand (successful marketing strategy).

As an example of how to translate MT trade clases into this system consider:

MT Trade Class        UTP (Universal Trade Profile)
Agriculturial         1 2 1 4 4 5 6 5 (Moderate)
Industrial            4 5 5 4 3 2 1 6 (Very High)
   where 1 = 0.25   5 = 1.25
         2 = 0.50   6 = 1.50
         3 = 0.75   7 = 1.75
         4 = 1.00   8 = 2.00

Ag planets would have low interest in ag products since they are readily
available.  Similarly they would have a relatively low interest in raw
materials (since they don\'t do manufacturing extensively).  Drugs and low
tech items would have normal interests while medium and high tech items and
luxury items would by in demand.  The moderate pop is used to modify the
base consumption.
The industrial planet would have a normal demand for food (it produces some
or most of what it needs but imports other types that can\'t be grown there
plus some to suppliment its own crops) and drugs (most planets will).  A
reduced demand for manufactured goods and an increased demand for raw materials
(but not greatly increased because, obviously, most of the material must be
present to support cheap manufacturing).

These numbers are pulled out of thin air.  Careful thought could set up a
better set of numbers and modify them for things like tech level and
multiple trade classifications.

I\'ve been toying with the idea of using this type of system (modified of
course) in my Traveller game but I have been waiting to see what comes out of
the TDR trade system.  If some (ie more than 1 or 2) of you are interested, I
could flesh this out and recast it in MT terms.  Using this as a basis, you
could use tables to determine the actual cargo type and limit the available
tonnage.  Moreover, there could be some modifiers for certain cargos.  This
was not done in Star Trek RPG to minimize bookkeeping and because there is
no way to list every possible cargo type anyway.

It\'s the different jump sizes that will make the difference.  A jump to a
system 1 parsec away takes one week; a jump to a system 3 parsecs away
takes 1 week for a jump-3 ship, at least 2 weeks for a jump-2 ship, and at
least 3 weeks for a jump-1 ship.  "At least", because if there isn\'t a
system in between to allow refuelling, or the ship isn\'t carrying extra
fuel, it will have to go the long way round.  There may not even be a long
way round; this is especially a problem for jump-1 ships.

A fast ship (i.e. one with a large jump number) won\'t need to make money
along the way, because it won\'t come out of jump-space along the way.  But
the cargo will need to be very valuable (like tea was to the British
Empire :-) in order to be profitable, because a high jump factor means a
lot of fuel, which means a lower proportion of the ship is cargo space.

Or a large megacorporation.  Several Lightning class cruisers had their
main weapons removed (i.e. all but the turrets) and were sold for use as
big merchant ships.  One kept its main weapons, because the company in
question had good lawyers and found a loop-hole, and now trades with the
Vargr.

I will have to admit that I didn\'t do the calculations that way, although I
probably should have to be valid.  Like any good engineer, I merely looked
the answer up in my handbook, which in this case is the design system from
Striker, where each armor value was equated to a certain thickness of hard 
steel.  To get an armor value, you took the thickness, multiplied it by a
fudge factor for the material, and then compared it to the table.  So that\'s
where those numbers came from.  If somebody would like to do a surface area
to weight correlation for each of the basic configurations, it might be
handy.  In Striker, everything was a rectangular block, so when you mult-
iplied the face dimensions by the armor thickness, you always got a valid
weight.

Jim and Rob have raised queries about starship armor. I hope that this 
eventually gets codified on the TDR SIG, but one worry at a time....

Rob, there is NO reason that a local navy can\'t make an armor-8 ship.
Turn the "impossibilities" in the rules into "not really a good ideas"
and there you go. But be sure to add tasks for the ref to nuke the 
resulting rattletraps with passing chunks of matter....

Jim, active defense against micrometeoroids is essentially impossible;
there is a large class of rocks that are too small to see, much less
shoot at and vaporize, that could hull a thin-skinned ship at high speed.
Armor (especially (turn up the gain on the Physics Nullifier, Dow!) "bonded
superdense") is the easiest way of dealing with said problems.

There are circumstances where one must take one\'s chances, though. Anyone
ever see "Conquest of Space"? It was a 1950s movie about the first manned
mission to mars, about 50/50 lousy filmmaking and truly visionary ideas.
There\'s a scene where a passing cluster of micrometeoroids whips by the
outbound ship at a fairly high relative velocity while two of the astronauts
are outside performing some sort of instrument adjustment. Ross Martin takes
a high-V frag through the vacc suit and dies horribly. I was about six years
old the first time I saw that film; it scarred me for life. |->

All this is true however a simplified first cut at the problem might be
to use p^2 = a^3 where p is the period and a is the semimajor axis.  For
example suppose there is a gas giant around which 3 moons orbit.  The middle
moon is where the players are and they want to know where the other moons
are and when the gas giant eclipse the sun(s).  Calculate or set a period for
the middle moon with respect to the sun (this takes into account the motion
of the gas giant ie our moon has a period wrt the stars of 27 days but the
time between full moons is 29 day its period wrt the sun).  If you know the
semimajor axis of the other moon in terms of the semimajor axis of the middle
moon you can calculate the periods (or vice versa).  An example:

    Moon      semimajor axis  period
     1            1/4           1/8
     2             1             1
     3             4             8

Therefore if the middle moon has a period of 8 days then the inner moon is
1 day and the outer is 64.  Alternatively, given the periods you can find the
semimajor axis.  With this knowledge, pick where you want the relative
positions to be initially then as time passes you can estimate where the new
positions will be and can say where in the sky things are.  Using this data
and John Kim\'s angular size equation you can calculate the percentage of the
orbit of the moon that is in the shadow of the gas giant and therefore how long
the eclipse lasts.  This can be done for each moon.  In fact if you assume
circular orbits (which can be show to be generally the case as high ecc. objects
tend to get there orbits corrected) you can sketch out the system in question
for some aritrary time (like 001-1100) and then calculate how many orbits or
partial orbits have elapsed for each object and figure its current position
for any future time.  This ignores lots of interesting physics but for the
purpose of the game its sufficient.  For more details on this calculation
look up Kepler\'s Laws in any basic physics or astronomy book.  

If you have a Mac (or access to one) there is a program called Voyager that
would be of some use.  There are PC programs as well, I just can\'t remember
their names.

If I ever figure out these blasted rules.....



How do you calculate the amount of fuel those darn power plants
need using the MegaT rules?   I won\'t even repeat the figure I came
up with... it was ridiculus!

	Here\'s the scenario:  
	
		A 2000T ship (volume 27000kl, Weight 600, etc.)
		Jump 3, 3G manuever drives...
		
	What I figured out so far (and poke holes here where needed) is this:
	
	To obtain Jump 3 with this ship I need:
	
		80 Jump units, for a total volume of 1080kl, and a weight
		of 2160 tons.  This would need 800kl of fuel (I want this
		ship capable of 2 jumps at jump 3.)
		
		So far so good... ( I think )
		
	To get 3G of manuever I need:
	
		160 Maneuver drive units, for a total volume of 2160kl,
		and a weight of 5600T.  Power required would be 11,200MW.
		
	Now here is where I get screwed up:
	
	I want there to be double the amount of power available than
	what engineering needs for agility considerations.  Therefore I
	want my powerplant to generate 22,400MW.  Looking at the charts
	I find that I need 3734 fusion power plant units at a volume of
	3734kl, and figuring out fuel I\'m not so sure about... 
	
	Rob? Metlay? Anybody out there want to help a High Guard refugee?

Note that the "tdr_admin" SIG is for requests, complaints, and comments to
TDR SIG administrators, and is not likely to get bigger. :-)

If anyone has mailer problems to these addresses, it may be correctable by
changing "@hpcvss.cv.hp.com" to "%hpcvss.cv.hp.com@relay.hp.com".  This
has solved the problem in at least one case.

I will be administering the mail lists.  If you want to join one or more
of these SIGs, send a request to "tdr_admin" and you\'ll be added.

These mailing lists are already up and running, so they can be used
immediately.

The 100 displacement ton sphere will have a hull surface area of
615 m^2.  At a (sphere wt= x 0.8?) normal hull, it would weigh
1320 tons.  That\'s 2.15 tons/m^2.  Or 215 g/cm^2.
	Now, I don\'t know how much you all know about real
spacecraft design, but 200 g/cm^2 is at the low end of what\'s healthy
for long-term radiation exposure in deep space*.  Permanent facilities
ought to be more.  (about a factor of two more, maybe three.  But
200 g/cm^2 is in the right ballpark).

	WHat do current spacecraft weigh? about 2 g/cm^2, ranging up
to 3.  Why do they get away with this?  They stay within earth\'s magnetic
field (which deflects both solar radiation and Galactic Cosmic Radiation or
GCR) and out of the high-radiation Van Allen belts.

	So, to answer the \'why\' of \'why are they that thick\' we can plead
crew safety 8-), and the \'how can i make it less\'; if it\'s for near-orbit use,
and you don\'t mind a (lightly) irradited crew, it can be a lot less.

* deep space radiation falls under two sections; that produced by the sun
in solar flares (intermittent) and the cosmic ray background, constant
in the galaxy.  Generally, the same amount of shielding will keep 
flare doses at safe short-exposure levels and the continuous GCR at
safe long-exposure levels.  I can copy some NASA info on this for anyone
that wants it.

If you\'re only interested in an occasional eclipse or two,
it\'s a great idea.  The impression I got from the original
letter (I don\'t save these for much more than a day so I
can\'t check) was that he wanted to know what the night sky
would look like given a certain time and place.  If you use
T. L. Hayes\'s simplification for this, you get the boring
(in my opinion) result of all the planets/moons/suns lined
up in one line in the sky.  I like to imagine the view at
Regina as something like the Saturn mosaic JPL released,
with a moon here and there.  I suppose you could fake it.

I\'ve got the Saturn mosaic as a very well done digitized
bitmap (640x480x256) if anyone\'s interested.  You can even
pick out some of the background stars (I could almost swear
one group is the Pleiades...)

What I meant was 1,650,000 kgs.  This gives a thickness of 33.27 cm.  This
looks more like what it should.  I told you I was bad with numbers.  Hard
to believe I graduated college!  Fortunately, in physics and astronomy you
do most of your work with symbols (which I don\'t have problems with, really!).

I agree, you still need an active defense system of some sort. However, no
matter how sophisticated your sensors are, there will be space dust smaller
than they can detect. There is also a size below which there is no point
trying to destroy incoming objects because they are too hard to hit.

The objective of a ship designer will be to strike a happy medium; Have an
active defense system that can destroy or evade larger incoming objects, and
a passive system (shields, armour) that can handle the objects that are too
small for the active system to deal with.

Ideally you want a fair amount of overlap, in case your active system misses
something (or is overloaded by sheer volume of debris). Hence the reason for
a large amount of armour on ships.

Remarks:  "The \'P.F. Sloan\' Class fleet escort is intended for
routine fleet security and support.  Fleet escorts are assigned in
quantity for local or system defense any time that several
squadrons or a fleet are present.  If it is remembered that Sloans
are lightly armed and armored, then their performance can be seen
as admirable, although they cannot withstand major engagements."-

Remarks:  "The \'Plankwell\' class dreadnaught is a more specialized
ship than the multi-task oriented \'Tigress\' class.  Lacking the
extensive troop complement and the large fighter screen, the
\'Plankwell\' fulfills a more traditional battleship role, as the
center of a fleet of supporting ships.
 
    For decades, the Imperial Fleet in the Spinward Marches has
included at leas one BatRon of \'Plankwell\' class ships, but
recently (1102), the last such squadron was rotated to the
strategic reserve in Corridor Sector.  Sentiment in Naval and
Sector circles runs high in favor of returning at least one BatRon
to the Marches.
 
    \'Plankwell\' class dreadnaughts are named for notable admirals
in the Imperial Navy.  The class name is taken from Grand Admiral
Olav hault-Plankwell, a sector admiral in the Spinward Marches who
rose to Grand Admiral of the Marches and lead to the defeat of the
Outworld Coalition during the First Frontier War (589 to 604). 
Following his victory in 604, he lead the fleet to the Core,
personally dispatched the Empress Jaqueline I, and took over the
government.  The result was the long, bloody Civil War; Olav was
the first of the Emperors of the Flag.  Although Olav is in
disrepute as an emperor, Grand Admiral Plankwell is still
remembered and honored for his achievements as a naval commander
in the First Frontier War; significantly his name has not been
assigned to any ship in the new \'Cleon\' class of battleriders,
named for Emperors of the Imperium.
 
    Modular Construction:  \'Plankwell\' class dreadnaughts were
built using a modular construction technique which has proven cost
effective in commercial ship-building.  A central strut or keel
serves as a foundation, bracing the drives and aligning the spinal
mount, while all other parts of the ship are mounted to brackets
or strengthened points along it.  The technique allows separate
costruction of the various modules (such as quarters, electronics
areas, fuel tankage, and control areas), with a final mating of all
the variusl componants being performed only after the drives and
keel have been tested and accepted.  There was some initial concern
that the connecting points would be focusses for weakness in
battle, but the losses of two separate \'Plankwell\'s in combat has
been attributed by investigating boards to strategic
misdirection."  -Supplement 9:  Fighting Ships

Subject:  Why Trade?  Or, the Tail Wagging the Dog.

I\'ll try to keep this short (ha!).  I have a major problem with the people who
keep posting messages telling me why trade won\'t work in Traveller (or TDR) and
therefore should be dropped.  I assume you want to keep the "look and feel" of
Traveller (large interstellar governments, interstellar Travel, etc), and to do
 that you *MUST* have trade.

If interstellar trade in impractical, there is no economic connection between
systems unless one is a captive colony of the other, and there is very little
reason for a system to have these colonies (barring Religious Destiny).  There-
fore, no peaceful cooperation, no interstellar government, no passenger
traffic, etc.  Traveller is now set in ONE highly developed star system.  I
think we have a problem here ;).

Fortunately, we don\'t even have to change very much of MT to make interstellar
shipping a prosperous ongoing business.  We just have to look at the numbers
from a new direction.  First, let\'s look at the value (Man. Sug. Retail Pr) of
a "typical" cargo, say one ton of metalworking tools.  A metalworking tool kit
displaces 50l and sells for 1500Cr.  One tn=14 cub. m.=14000l.  Assume packing
materials are incredibly inefficient and occupy 40% of available volume, you
still have 8400l of cargo space = 168 kits = 252000Cr.  If shipping accounts
for only 5% of final cost (less than it does for most goods currently shipped
internationally) then a starship must be able to make a typical run for 12600
credits per ton of mean cargo carried.  I haven\'t generated typical expenses
for a free trader or far trader, but somehow I don\'t think this will be a
problem <g,d,&r>.

Obviously, the only problem with making trade in MT profitable is that the
cargo and freight rates have been grossly underestimated.  Perhaps noone ever
built a 14 cubic meter crate and filled it with trade goods?

BTW, the metalworking tool kit is NOT  particularly high pr/vol item.  Try
doing this with clothing, or vacc suits, or any other item on the equipment
lists.  Even bulk chemicals, such as Water Dyes.

The best news is that the ship design folks seem to be on the verge of deciding
that fuel consumption is far too high unless most of that is tossed out the
back as reaction mass for the maneuver drive.  This makes fuel cost for Jump
relatively small, increasing the relative profitability of interstellar trade
(not to mention making higher jump trading vessels more practical).

BTW, in case you haven\'t noticed, I\'ll be joining the Trade & Commerce SIG.

"Unless the planet can not grow its own food because of its composition or
atmosphere but turns out to have a fortune if raw materials and is a handy
place to manufacture things."

My point is that a population will not be someplace where the bulk necessities
of life do not exist without a ***good*** reason.  Sure, a people may be on a
planet to exploit a resource, but they are more likely to be as small a number
as possible, existing on the native resources or synthetics, rather then
*expensively* haulling the necessities of life to the planet, just so that
people can live there.

In short, there has to be a good reason for people being where the necessities
of life are not.

Hi there!  I\'m a new member of the TML, although I\'ve played Traveller in
its various incarnations for several years.  In catching up on the 
discussions in this group, a couple of questions for y\'all came to mind --

Some time ago, there was a discussion about the validity of the Paranoia
Press version of the Beyond map, and the question came up whether Digest
Group had plans in that direction or not.  I don\'t know either, but
someone who has a copy of the old Beyond map might be able to tell 
something.  In Trav.Digest #20, the Trojan Reach map shows a gov\'t called
the Florian League in subsector E of the sector which seems to stretch
into subsector H of the Beyond.  If this gov\'t doesn\'t exist on the old
PP map, then the Beyond has been totally wiped.  Despite the problems
this might cause (Garonne/Haldensleben was referred to in both GDW\'s
"Azhanti High Lightning" and as part of PP\'s "Vanguard Reaches" sector)
this might not be all bad.  The old Vanguard Reaches had _four_ TL17
worlds, three of which were Zhodani clients...in comparison to the single
one in the entire Imperium.

Which brings me to number two -- what\'s the deal with Sabmyqys?  From what
I understand, there once was an article or reference to them in JTAS, may
it rest in peace. :)  Would somebody *please* clue me in to some info
about them?  I\'m very curious about this elusive race who somehow has 
managed to flaunt the apparent fluke of probability that keeps the Imperium
in general at TL16 and below.... :)

Thank you in advance,

be higher but that simply makes the skin thinner.  Units should be obvious

Remarks:  The \'Saab\' is renouned as the safest air/raft in
operation.
 
    The Darrians have a strong distrust of Grav Vehicles.  When the
Maghiz hit their TL16 planet it fused all the grav modules in
existance.  Their current regulations concerning the building of
grav vehicles stipulates that they must be able to land in the
event of a total electronic systems failure.  The \'Saab\' class
air/raft is designed to do just that under any circumstances.  It
has electronic circuit protection as well as a fiber optic backup
computer in case two standard computers fail.  In case of a total
computer and power failure, the craft has simple aircraft controls
to enable an emergency landing as well as a 7 seconds of battery
power.  The craft\'s unpowered landing speed being 21 meters per
second, it would take 1.9 seconds to bring her to a COMPLETE stop
leaving 5.1 seconds of power to bring her down in a vertical
landing.  Though this may not sound like much, but it really is
quite a long time from a pilot\'s point of view.  This, coupled with
the inertial compensators to cushion the blow, plus seat belts and
air bags, almost anyone can make a safe landing.
 
    The craft can land in water if necessary.  And as a last resort
when the craft can not land safely, the craft has two ejection
seats.
 
    Two radios are carried in addition to the standard battery
powered Emergency Location Transmitter.  Assuming the main
batteries have not been TOTALLY drained one can easily call for
assistance as the power requirements of the radios is negligable.
 
    Please note.  This is not a standard grav vehicle.  This is a
light aircraft.  It can take off and land like an Air/Raft, but it
can not be expected to fly in anything other than light winds, ie.
11 knots or 20kph.  Normal Air/Rafts would be designed to be
unaffected by air currents.  In contrast, the \'Saab\' would catch
the winds like a kite.  Watch out for those take off and landings!
 
    Normally, the \'Saab\' will take off and land vertically.  It
will rise clear of obstructions and then the wings unfold. 
Reversing the process for normal landings.  If on water, the wings
do not fold as they contain outriggers similar to the PBY Catalina.
 
    A military variant is available with two outboard wing
hardpoints for 462626 Cr.  Max external load=900kg,
Weight limit for vertical takeoff=490kg w/no internal cargo. 
Standard load=2 neutrino homing missiles.

had some valid points, as far as I am concerned.  I picked up a copy of 2nd
Ed Twilight:2000 in August and haven\'t had much of a chance to sit down and look
it over.  In fact, I haven\'t even tried to generate a character.  Until today...

Friends, you know I can deal with complicated systems.  However, the character
generator in 2nd Ed Twilight had me tearing my hair out in a few minutes.  
Can you imagine:  Numerous references to tables at the back of the book without
                  page references

                  4 year career increments (wonder where they got that idea)
                  that generate great characters like the cowardly Ranger who
                  was still a private after 16 years in the army.

                  Complicated character generation worksheet with spaces too
                  small to write in, and covering most, but not *all* things
                  that you need to track.

                  Hit points that allow an average character to take at least
                  4 shots from a .44 magnum pistol in the chest and another 1-2
                  shots in the head without being more than "slightly wounded",
                  which has little game effect.

                  College educations which do not increase your education 
                  statistic, so that if you don\'t have enough education at the
                  age of 17, you\'ll never make it to grad school.

Ugh.  If I am reading the book correctly, the average unarmed fighter would
have to kick the average character in the head 11 times to render him 
unconscious.

I don\'t know about anyone else, but this is massively inconsistent with the
"realistic, gritty" flavor the game seems to be attempting to produce.  The
typical character would only be slightly wounded by a hit in the chest from
a .50cal machine gun.

I have no intention of buying any further 2nd Ed Twilight:2000 products.

of some concern to me when it comes to handling tech levels.  

Should we give some thought to what the lowest tech level should be that could
implement a technology if they didn\'t have to discover it?  Many of the low
tech worlds in the Imperium and its near neighbors are either deliberately
\\limiting technology, or recovering from disasters of one sort or another, right?

I am tending at the moment to think of TLs as being primarily limits on material
technology.  As a couple of examples--there is no real reason why someone armed
with the proper knowledge could not build a hot air ballon or a man-carrying
glider of some sort in Ancient Greece.  Some applications of gunpowder would
be possible at that level, too, although cannons might not be (I don\'t recall
whether the Greeks could cast bronze in large quantities).  CPR, a valuable
medical technique, requires no equipment, and could be used by someone in 
a stone-age situation even though it wasn\'t developed until sometime in TL7
the way the game calculates things.  (Of course, without a hospital and rescue 
squad it might not be quite as valuable...).  The first patent on a hovercraft
was granted in something ridiculous like 1879...power to weight considerations
were the main reason it probably couldn\'t have been built.

(Speaking of hovercraft...I happended to look up stats on the Navy\'s LCAC
air cushion landing craft today.  With 10MW worth of engines, it can lift
150 tons, and still amke 50kts--80 or so kph...in MT 10MW will lift 100
tons with nothing left over for thrust)

Anyway...some of the spiffy high tech things might be available at substantially
lower tech levels in a rather clunky form.

Remarks:  The \'Talon\' class fighter is commonly carried aboard
heavy carriers and other naval vessels.  Occasionally, a ship which
does not ordinarily carry fighters will substitute a \'Talon\' for
one of its launches.  The class was designed late in the Fifth
Frontier War after the \'Viper\' class escort fighter was deployed
and represents yet another triumph for Naval Architect Dr. Hloch
(The Traveller\'s Kelly Johnson).  It saw limited action in the war
but distinguished itself in the final battle of Calit{Spinward
Marches 1515} when elements of the Imperial 23rd fleet ambushed and
severely mauled the retreating Zhodani 40th Fleet after their
defeated thrust for Rhylanor{Spinward Marches 2716}.
 
    The \'Talon\' has a 23 ton bomb bay installed.  This is usually
empty as are the 5 hardpoints for external ordanance.  Though
unpressureized, the bay, when used is more often used for cargo
when it can carry 23.3Kl.  Alternately, it fuctions as the
fighter\'s air lock.
 
    The 5 fusilage hardpoints are almost always left empty but can
mount multiple missile racks to carry up to thirty anti-ship
missiles externally.  These racks are then fired off in a manner
similar to the \'Viper\' and the \'Indianapolis\' fighters in one large
volley as a factor 7 missile battery.

On the contrary, Kepler\'s law does not restrict you from having the planets/
moons inclined to the plane of the orbit of the primary body.  I suggested
it as a simple way to tell where along an orbit the object would lie without
going through detailed astro-mechanical calculations.  A little trig and
knowledge of the inclination would easily allow you to determine the angle
above or below the ecliptic (reference the main planet).  All this assumes 
you really want this much detail but you don\'t want to spend a lot of time
doing detailed calculations.  To generate a "sky view" simply determine
where all the objects (visible ones) are along their orbits then assuming
you know or have set the angle of inclination and the nodes you can easily
determine the apparent asimuth and elevation of the object of interest.

What you do need to do is make a lot of simplifying assumptions like all the
orbits are circles (so you can tell from the period where along the orbit
the planet is) and none of the orbits (nodes) precess otherwise you may as
well go back to the full calculations using orbital elements.

Perhaps we should install (or assume these are already installed?) a
navigational deflector (like the Enterprise has) based on repulsor technology.
All it does is project a beam of repulsive force (how does it do this I
wonder) in the direction of motion and "sweep" back and forth clearing a
path through the MICRO-meteroids/asteroids.  It would have little effect on
anything of any real size (to prevent if from being used as an extra weapon)
but then things that big are a) rare and b) easy (relatively) to avoid.

Ok picture it, the Imperium, 1101, the TL Megacorporation discovers a planet 
dripping with raw materials.  Duke Hayes, the president and owner gets the
official governmental OK to exploit the planet for all its worth (I pulled
some strings of course).  The atmosphere is poisonous, the soil is so 
metalic that it won\'t support any editable plants.  The corporation set up a
colony to mine the planet.  Since its a waste to send empty ships to pick
up the raw material I send full ships!  Ships full of food, water, clothes,
anything I can sell.  This way I get some of the money I\'m paying them back
and my ship\'s make money going *both* ways!  Keep in mind that I am paying
these people a small fortune to live and work here under these conditions.

Because this is a long term project the miners marry and have children or
bring their families with them (for the promise of money "Honey, its only
2 or 3 years then will be rich!" except I\'m charging outragous prices for
basic goods and the miners never make much of a profit).  The children
grow up thinking of this as home.  But I\'m getting a head of myself.

Once things are going smoothly, I set up manufacturing facilities because
it cheaper to make the stuff here then to export the raw materials.  This
requires more people and more support people to do the mining, manufacturing,
starport services, schools for my employee\'s children etc, etc.  Boom! Planet
pop is now say 4-5 (not bad).  There is minimum self support because of the
poor conditions for growing food.  Now that there is a starport however those
damnable independant traders start showing up with their cheap foodstuffs and
other supplies so I must lower my import prices to avoid loosing money.  Now
my miners are really begining to make money, tangable money that is.  By now
many have invested many years in the company and this is their home (such as
it is) and they don\'t want to leave.

By this time I have made a pile of money and maybe others have successfully
petitioned for access to the planet and I loose my monopoly so I start selling
off all the things I own on the planet while it still is a monopoly (mostly).
Some I sell to other corporations, some the my former workers who now live
there.  Since this is now an employee owned operation they can do what they
want but they are unlikely to leave because now they "own their home" in
a manner of speaking.  So more time passes and more children grow up here
thinking of this as home.  Some leave, some don\'t.  Living is not so hard
now because lots of cities have been built to house all the people.  Doomed
parks and gardens have been created by the people who live there so maybe
some of the food needs can now be met locally (but it is expensive since
you need to purify air and water and probably import the original soil).  
It may still be cheaper to import food especially considering the amount of
money that can be made on the manufactured exports (no over head for pollution
control or the like).

Maybe this is not the best explaination for why a "worthless" planet would
have a sizable population but it shows the idea.  Don\'t under estimate the
power of the mind to accept "home".  Many people don\'t leave the places
they were born and raised in even here on Earth today.  Long term projects
will create families and communities that may be totally supported by 
imported products.  Why set up agriculture on a planet you (the megacorp.)
intend to throw away when your done?  For the employees?  Get serious there
are millions of people who will work for these wages!  Let them import food!

There was no Florian League in PP\'s version of Beyond.  I haven\'t looked
at the maps for a while, but I think subsector H was the Darkling Regions,
with little or no large-scale government.  I believe that DGP\'s Trojan
Reach is more or less completely incompatible with PP\'s Beyond, and
effectively drives the final nail into the coffin of Paranoia Press.

I haven\'t read this article (in Challenge 28) for a long time, but I
don\'t think that Sabmiqys was ever a member of the Imperium.  If I
recall correctly, the world was strictly isolationist, and their high
technology was all their own work.  There\'s no specific reason why
Imperial worlds shouldn\'t eventually achieve higher tech levels --
they just haven\'t managed it yet.

   Yes, you will be shipping supplies to the mining colony instead of
   deadheading.  However, I think that you underestimate the amount of cargo
   space available for supplies.  Setting up a colony requires *lots* of
   equipment, and supplies.  Any extra cargo space would be devoted to mining
   and refining equipment.  Once the colony starts producing refined material
   instead of raw material, the amount of cargo space available will drop like
   a rock, yet the colony will be larger and require more supplies.  I duobt
   that there will normally be surplus to create a homey atmosphere, unless the
   place already provides most of the raw requirements of life, so that there
   is room for extra imports.

   As an aside, that kind of equipment do you imagine Traveller has for taking
   raw material, ie water, ice, sand, rock, hydrocarbons, gases, and producing
   air, water, food and fuel?  Or will all of this have to be imported?  I
   don\'t recall seeing much in this vein in Traveller.  I assume that fusion
   fuel can be refined as on starships, that water can be purified from water
   and ice, and that air can be made from water and oxides.  what about food? 
   I suspect that if synthesized food is possible, it will be de jour in the
   mining colonies.
 
"Once things are going smoothly, I set up manufacturing facilities because
it cheaper to make the stuff here then to export the raw materials.  This
requires more people and more support people to do the mining, manufacturing,

my miners are really begining to make money, tangable money that is.  By now
many have invested many years in the company and this is their home (such as
it is) and they don\'t want to leave."

   This is about what I consider par for the course for a mining colony to
   eventually develop into an industrial planet.  Either the company will
   specialize in exporting widgets, or framisis\'s which are always in need on
   the planet will start being made at the colony.

   Also, though, I believe that a large number of young adults will leave the
   place if it does not show promise to them, and go elsewhere.  For a small
   colony this may more then offset any population increase.
 
"By this time I have made a pile of money and maybe others have successfully
petitioned for access to the planet and I loose my monopoly so I start selling

to import food especially considering the amount of money that can be made on

   As long as the basics of life can be produced on the planet, inculding
   synthesized food for the lower masses.
 
"Maybe this is not the best explaination for why a "worthless" planet would
have a sizable population but it shows the idea.  Don\'t under estimate the

   It\'s a plausible scenario, given some premises.  How common will it be,
   though?  I believe tht it will only take place on the most favorable
   planets.  As with current development, the best places will be developed
   first, ie the planets that already have some of the resources needed.

Hello again!  Thanks to those of you who answered my post concerning
"The Beyond and TL17 Worlds" from a few days back.  I suspected that
the PP stuff was totally booted....

I was looking at the sector maps from the sunbane ftp archive the other
day, and out of curiosity downloaded the Trojan Reach map.  I think it
might be, well, wrong.  The bases, allegiance, port, and gas giant
codes look ok, but the UWPs conflict w/ published subsectors. For example:
  *ARCHIVE COPY*
 [unnamed] 1209 X336855-0          R 410 Na  G3V
  *Adv. 4: LEVIATHAN / Travellers Digest 20*
  985-373  1209 X775000-0            020 Na  K6V M3D
The other maps I\'ve seen seem to be more or less ok, but I can\'t check most.
Ummm...just thought I\'d point this out for those of you who might be
interested.

	"HUH!" Grant sat bolt upright in bed, shaking in a cold sweat. He 
wiped a damp hand across his eyes in the darkness, and wearily got out of bed. 
Damn nightmares, he thought disgustedly, staggering into the bathroom.

	"Are you all right, Captain?" Hector\'s voice held a carefully 
developed note of concern as Grant clambered up the ramp onto the Bridge.
"You aren\'t due to be awakened for another half hour...."
	"I\'m fine, Hector," Grant said with a sigh, sitting down at the helm 
position. "I woke up early, that\'s all."
	Sanchez pulled his head and upper body out of a nearby maintainance
panel and surveyed Grant carefully. He was clean-shaven and shipshape, as 
always, but his eyes were red and shadowed. Sanchez shook his head as he 
closed up the panel.
	"Dreaming about Ymir again, Skipper?"
	Grant jerked as if shot, then settled into his chair with a short 
laugh. "That predictable, am I?"
	"I\'ve known you for nigh on twenty years, Skipper," Sanchez shrugged. 
"From Ascalon to Easter, there\'s nothing like Ymir for a helmsman in the 
Suleiman Cluster to practice on. Two decades, most of \'em in space, and only

	"I try, Wu-Shun, I really do," Grant grimaced, flipping through the
cargo manifests for the hundredth time. "But that one mistake-- all the damage 
it did.... it really shook me up."
	"Damage? You tore off one hardpoint, wrecked the deep radar, mangled

	"I never should\'ve tried to fly her again. That misjump...."
	"We got a tow to Upirzanu, didn\'t we? The Serendipity turned out to be 
stolen goods, didn\'t it? The Navy and Hortalez honored our contracts, and we

gone wrong! We could be dead, or in prison, or we could\'ve run into something 
even worse than what we\'ve seen already!"
	"Worse than what we\'ve seen already?" Kherkhoulloth came in, yawning 
and running a hand through his black mane of still-damp fur. "We\'ve crawled 
through the guts of Arcodiga, stopped a war on Easter, stopped another war
on Gwathui--"
	"Not yet, we haven\'t," Grant said mildly. "That\'s the Navy\'s job. We 
just gave them the goods they needed to do it."
	"Minor point," the irrepressible Vargr laughed, hopping into the 
Navigator\'s chair and lighting up the holodyne in a dimmed pattern of reds and 
browns well-suited to his eyes. "We\'ve delivered treaties, been bombed halfway 
to the Ancients, bounced off a mountain--"
	"This is where I came in," Grant groaned.
	"And managed to keep our homocidal Solomani-hating cybernetic death 
machine and our government-toppling movie director from getting us all 
killed," Kherkhoulloth finished with relish.
	"I heard that," O\'Connor\'s voice came over the intercom.
	"So did I," echoed Jaeger\'s voice. "Captain, you up?"
	"Right here," Grant smiled. "Nice to know I\'m the last one out of 
bed."
	"Not quite," Hector\'s voice interrupted him. "Doctor Fell is still 
asleep. He is not scheduled to take his station until fifteen minutes from 
now."
	"He\'ll never make it," Kherkhoulloth sighed.
	"He\'ll make it," Jaeger\'s voice replied evenly. "He won\'t smell very 
nice and he may not be dressed, but he\'ll make it. I don\'t know where you
find these types, Captain."
	Grant finished flipping through the manifests. "Fell\'s a good man," he 
said mildly. "He needed our help and we needed his. Anyone have any complaints 
about the way he does his job?"
	"He\'s a loose cannon, Captain," O\'Connor\'s voice held the barest hint 
of annoyance. "He\'s used to acting on his own, and he doesn\'t think through 
his options before doing dangerous and irreparable things."
	"Not all of us have a Model 2fib in our frontal lobe, O\'Connor," 
Kherkhoulloth snarled. "Come on, give him a break!"
	"Do YOU trust him, Kherkhoulloth?"
	"Of course not," Kherkoulloth shrugged. "I don\'t trust ANYONE. But the 
point stands: I don\'t know what you were driving at when I walked in, Sanchez.
We\'ve seen more weird crap since we shipped out together than any of us has 
seen in a decade or more-- everything from religious riots on Vega to trying 
to sell maple syrup and plastic Buddhas in a war zone. What do you mean,
something even WORSE could happen to us?"
	Sanchez glowered at him. "Hi ho," he muttered darkly.
	That shut Kherkhoulloth up. Along with everyone else. 
	"Good morning, all!" The iris valve to the Bridge opened and admitted 
Fell, who tossed a lank swath of dark hair back over his bald spot and took 
his place at an empty holodyne with a pleasant nod to Sanchez, who slapped him 
on the back as he left the Bridge for Engineering. "I trust I\'m not late?"
	"Right on time, Christoph," Grant nodded. "Try to get ASTC on the 
horn. We\'re ready to take berthing; and I\'ll try not to do a repeat of Ymir 
this time."
	"You always say that before each landing," Fell frowned. "One of these 
days, I\'d like to hear exactly what happened on Ymir...."
	"Not while he\'s at the helm," Jaeger\'s voice came suddenly. "We\'ll 
settle in at a bar once we\'re down, and we\'ll tell you all about it...."

Since Metlay descided to post that portion of a novel, I suppose I
can get away with posting an outtake of a story I\'ve been in the
process of writing for a while now... Chapter 1:

					* * * * * * * * 


They were in a festive mood.  Then again, they were always in a
festive mood.   The sounds of a loud party filtered throughout the
yacht as did the smells of good food, and the slight reek of
alchohol.  Noone was watching the instruments on the bridge.  If
they were, they would have seen the larger ship approaching.  

Slightly more than twice the size of the yacht, it approached
noiselessly.  A beeping emmitted from the collision avoidance
system and the on duty helmsman woke up long enough from his nap to
stab a finger at a button to silence it.

The yellow indicators turned red as the larger vessel closed, drew
along side and established a parallel course that paced the
yacht. The revelers had no idea of the danger that approached.

The duty helmsman shifted in his chair slightly, adjusted the hat
over his eyes better to close out the light and began to snore. 

In the cargo area, by the main airlock, a steward\'s assistant was
removing bottles of wine from a rack.  He spotted one of the
engineering lackies climbing down a companionway.  "The stuff we
stowed for you guys is over th..." A silenced weapon spoke once and
the steward was thrown back, a bottle smashed, and a puzzled look
came over his face.  His mouth tried to form a question that was
never uttered as blood gushed forth from where an eye was supposed
to exist.  His now lifeless body slid to the deck.

The engineering hand removed a panel from the wall, cut three
wires, and removed a module.  Moments later, the airlock opened and
six individuals of various races entered.  One tossed the engineer
a submachinegun and a bandolier and three of them went to the turbo
lift.   The remaining four went aft.

In the main gallery, the party was going strong.  Drink flowed
freely and food was consumed in obscene quantities. 

In the center of the maelstrom of activity was a rather bored and
rather disgustedlooking young man of fifteen.  
In his lifetime he\'d seen his eldersas well as his older cousins act 
in this manner and vowed when it was his turn to take the reigns of
power from his father, this sort of activity would not be at the
expense of the estate his father would leave him as it was now.
"No," he thought to himself, "my aunts, uncles, and cousins just
sponge off my dad, and he lets them!"  "Have some wine Derek!"
shouted his uncle Jarns, "you\'re old enough now!"  

At that moment the loud staccato of firecrackers was to be heard
from a passageway.  The partiers were stunned into silence.  The
bodyguards that were assigned to Derek closed distance with him and
grew very alert.  

With the dying of the last echos from the firecrackers came the
three maurauders wielding their weapons.  One of Derek\'s guards
attempted to draw a weapon from inside his tunic.  The other placed
himself as a human sheild between Derek and the intruders.  If
anyone had been watching the forehead of the guard drawing his
weapon they would have seen a red dot of light appear a fraction of
a second before the 9mm slugs from a four shot burst arrived.  Two
of them striking the guard and the other two spending themselves on
the wood clad walls on the other side of the gallery.  One of the
other intruders also fired a four shot burst at the guard who was
playing human sheild.  All four of these rounds found flesh to bite
 into, as one round impacted the base of the man\'s skull.  The face
of this guard exploded in a shower of blood that spattered over
some of the guests resulting in a terrified hysterical screaming
from one lady in particular.  

The now dead bodyguards crumpled to the floor leaving Derek
standing more or less alone.  One of the shooters asked the third
individual "is that the boy?"  A nod and they grabbed him and
pulled him effortlessly in spite of his struggles to the doorway.

"I am Lieutenant Drazin of the Solvanian Freedom Party " intoned
the being who had not untill this point done any of the shooting.
"I expect and will recieve your full cooperation " he went on "or
more of you could end up as these did..."  

The the engineering assistant and one of the other boarders
appeared at the doorway.  Drazin looked at the engineer and he
nodded.  "I have taken the liberty of having all doors, hatches,
and turbolifts locked so you won\'t be strolling around the ship.
Please make yourselves comfortable, young Derek Thalman the second
will be coming with us.  Feel free to continue your birthday party
for him, if everything goes as I expect he will celebrate many more!"

They left at that, taking Derek with them.  After a few minutes,
the more bold of the guests tried to open the sliding damage
control hatch in the passageway.  It was, as promised, locked tight.
Someone tried to overide it at a terminal in the main gallery.

Unnoticed at first, hydrogen gas and an accelerant were pouring in
through the life support ventilators.

The privateer vessel "Wraith" was pulling away from the yacht.
Drazin and an older greying human were watching it get smaller in
the viewport.  

On the yacht, within the central ductwork of the life support
ventilation system a greyish blob with a timing device on it had
been left behind by the boarding party.  At the predetermined
moment in time an electrical current passed through the blob a
white-hot ball of expanding gasses were created.  This ignited the
now explosive mixture of hydrogen gas and air.

>From their places on board the privateer, Drazin and his commanding
officer watched as the yacht became a silently expanding fireball
and scattered debris.  "Is our guest comfortably situated?"  "Yes
General"  "Good, the first phase of our plans are complete.  Let us
hope that the elder Thalman is as reasonable as we expect him to
be."

Hmm... does anyone know how widespread these discrepancies are?
I suspect the data in the archives were early drafts.  It\'s possible
that the folks at DGP forgot about the data in Leviathan when they
were originally working out the Trojan Reach and corrected it later
when it was published in the Digest.  The base/allegiance/port/giant
codes would be correct because they were taken from the Atlas of the
Imperium.  If this is true then the problem should be isolated to
the 2 subsectors that were published in Leviathan.
 
Can anyone confirm this?

I thought there was already an anonymous ftp repository for vehicle

		A Magic (Mana) System for Traveller


1) Add a mana stat (1-6) to each Planetary Profile

2) Let a period be the world\'s day / mana stat 
	Example: Terra 24 hrs/ 1 = 24 hour period 

3) Each Magic User gets his (Endurance * 10) per period in mana points

4) Magic Users start training at age 14 and may learn no new spells 
   after initial training unless they return to their home world for
   6 months / spell learned

5) All MUs use the following table for prior service:

	Enlistment				9+
	DM +1 / Mana level of Homeworld
	DM +1 INT 9+

	Survival				10+     *
	DM +1 / Mana level of Homeworld
	DM +1 / Terms served

	Position				9+
	DM +1 INT 10+
	DM +1 END 11+

	Promotion				10+
	DM +1 INT 9+

	Reenlist (terms 2-5)			6+	Manadatory if made !
	Reenlist (terms 6+)			12+	Manadatory if made !
	DM +1 INT 9+

* IE low mana level worlds have few old Magic Users


6) Position is used by the player later in the campaign to call on help
   from his magic guild. The higher the position the better the chance of
   help and the more difficult the task the less chance for help. The 
   decision to help the PC is strictly in the hands of the GM using the
   above guidelines. The positions are:

	Rank	Name		Benefits if any

	1	Novice
	2	Apprentice
	3	Acolyte		Aid spell (share mana)
	4	Journeyman
	5	Adept
	6	Master

7) So far 6 catagories of mage are defined, this is by no means an 
   exhaustive list ! Feel free to add to it in the spirit it is presented
   and in scope of the Traveller game. The six catagories and their 
   automatic bonuses are ( all get magic skill):

	Dancer		Dex+1
	Chanter		IQ+1
	Charmer		Soc+1
	Summoner	"Demon" Lore
	Iconist		Magic Lore
	Generalist	Any 1 of Above


   Additionally there are special limitations for each class:

Chanters always act at the end of the combat round because their spells
require an incantation or song (Exception see spell FAST CHANT).

Dancers/Charmers are inherently (genetically) magic beings and must come
from a Mana-3 world (or higher).

Iconists\' magic is always via a focus (Icon)
	Examples: Runes, Charms, Jewels, etc
	From Literature: The Blue Adept

Some Summoner spells cost IQ loss if failed !

Generalists are the true wizards (Jack-O-T) of this system. If a Generalist
takes a spell from another track (s)he performs it a 1 level lower.

Muan Gwi, in the Vegan Autonomous District: late 1118

	He was tired. The exhaustion fogged everything, made images and 
memories somehow hazy and indistinct. They drifted past him, flashes of color 
and life, close enough to touch if only he had the strength....
	"Captain Khagariilian Grant?"
	"Yes?" Grant looked up from the landing strut he was inspecting. A man 
in his mid-forties or so was standing there, wrapped in a black coat against 
the chill wind of the Muan Gwi plateau. He held a small briefcase in one hand, 
and the other was extended for a handshake. Grant took the hand, cautiously.
	"He\'s clean, sir," came O\'Connor\'s voice in his ear. "I scanned him
from the ship. There\'s a shotgun in his briefcase, but he can\'t trigger it
from the outside."
	Grant nodded. "What can I do for you, Mister....?"
	"Cameron." The man flashed a winning, perfect smile. "J. J. Cameron,
Ling Standard Products. Might I have a few moments of your time? I have a 
business proposition that you might find very interesting."
	What is your name?
	The voice intruded on the memory, blotting it out.
	Go away, he said wearily. I was remembering.
	What were you remembering?
	He frowned, or tried to. I don\'t remember, he thought. Why not?
	What is your name?
	He struggled for a moment, then answered. Grant?
	No good. Turn up the gain another point, he\'s almost there....
	Grant\'s mind crackled like a candle in rain and went out.

	"Have you ever heard of Dag, Captain?" Cameron poured a glass of water 
for himself and handed the pitcher to Grant. 
	"Dag? Nope, not offhand," Grant said mildly, pouring a sip for 
himself. He looked around the conference table. "Any of you?"
	"Not me," Jaeger said mildly, accepting the pitcher.
	"Nor me," Kherkhoulloth said, stuffing another fistful of canapes into 
his mouth and chewing vigorously.
	O\'Connor was silent, thoughtful.
	"I\'m not familiar with the word either," Fell muttered, grabbing the 
canape plate from in front of Kherkhoulloth. "GIVE me those, you philistine!"
	"Sanchez?"
	I know. I know! I know that I know. At least I think I know. Do I 
know? I don\'t know WHAT I know any more. It\'s so confusing....
	"Hmm? Oh, well, I know what *I* mean when I say \'Dag,\' but I doubt 
that\'s what Mr. Cameron means....Dag is a kind of electrical insulation for 
vacuum-sealed high-current devices. It\'s sort of a blackish-grey gunk, kind
of like modeling putty. You dilute it with ethanol and paint it on, and it 
dries to a film...."
	"That\'s the stuff I mean, Mr. Sanchez," Cameron nodded. "There are 
thousands of different uses for Dag in the Imperium, and thousands of 
different formulations to meet those uses. Most of them have been around for 
centuries, and all of them are public-domain. Nobody\'s bothered to try to 
patent a new form of Dag since the Third Frontier War or thereabouts; there 
simply hasn\'t been a market for it." Cameron leaned forward across the table 
earnestly. "What would you say if I told you that a chemical engineering firm 
is preparing to issue a radical new Dag formulation that could drastically 
alter the way in which Jump drives are constructed?"
	Yow! What a concept! A new kind of Dag....
	Good evening, and welcome to another episode of This Old Starship, 
with your host, Wu-Shun Sanchez. Hello, I\'m Wu-Shun Sanchez, and welcome to 
the show. Tonight, we\'re going to see what we can do about cleaning up this 
crufty old Jump drive. We\'ll need our basic tools, some ethanol and Dag
							and Dag
						and Dag
					and Dag
				and Dag
			Dag
		Dag
	Dag
	What is your name?
	TerraDag.
	No, that\'s the answer to the SECOND question....
	Blue. I think. Or maybe pink.
	That\'s the THIRD question. Focus! What is your NAME?
	I don\'t know. Do I have one?
	Yes. Learn!

	"TerraDag." Sniff. Sniff. Smells like he\'s telling the truth....
"Funny name for it...."
	"That\'s only our codemark for it, Mister, er, Kirkowloth." Kae! What 
pus-awful pronounciation. Humans! "We don\'t know what its makers call it. In 
fact, we don\'t know anything at all about it, other than the fact that it 
reportedly exists, and that the place that manufactured it was located on 
Terra." 
	Terra? Kakh TSAKHA! No go, bro. No no no! No way. I didn\'t ship 
halfway across the Universe to hobnob with my genetic predecessors and 
eighteenth cousins....
	"Acheson Chemicals, the company that manufactures most of the Dag 
formulations currently in use in the Solomani Rim, was reportedly quite close 
to a breakthrough at the time of the Solomani invasion. They later claimed 
that the experiments were failures, but sources close to the lab think 
otherwise. We need to make sure."
	"Why?" All this fuss over some black gunk. Go figure.
	"Because if it does exist and the Solomani have it, then the Imperium 
must have it as well. Even little things like a new Dag formula can mean big 
differences in military buildup and resupply. Suppose this stuff DOES allow 
them to refit damaged ships faster than we? Then what?"
	"Then it\'s strategically important to learn about it for sure." I 
smell money here all of a sudden....
	"Precisely. Which brings us to the matter of payment." KA-CHING!
	"If you come back with evidence of the new Dag\'s existence, you\'ll be 
granted a free voucher for your next annual maintainance check at any starport 
with a Ling Standard shipyard. For greater degrees of success than that, the 
pay scale slides upward accordingly." Hrrrrr. Annual maintainance, on a ship 
like the Torch, comes to-- whoa! Carefully now, don\'t let this fish off the 
hook....
	"Um, what would we get for a, er, a COMPLETE success?"
	"Well, I\'d define that as being a sample of the new Dag, or notes on 
how to make it, along with a reasonable idea of the Solomani\'s knowledge of 
what it is and can do, or lack thereof. If the overall picture were favorable 
enough, I could probably write up a Form 662 as part of the \'reasonable 
expenditures\' for this mission, and send it off to Hortalez et Cie...."
	"A F-F-Form Six S-Sixty Two?" Sniff. Whew! What\'s got into the Captain 
all of a sudden? He\'s sweating like a Bwap! "You\'re not SERIOUS!"
	"Of course I am, Captain. This is a risky job; it should carry the 
largest practical reward if well done."
	"\'Scuse me, but for the ignorant among us, what\'s a \'Form 662\'?"
	"A lien forgiveness. He\'s saying he\'ll pay off our lien on the SHIP!"
	"Say WHAT?"
	Roukh! That\'s worth over, uh, hmm, uh, SIXTY MILLION CR--
	What is your name?
	Kherkhoulloth. Now where was I? Remortgage the ship, and--
	WRONG ANSWER.
	Shut up. Remortgage the ship, and with the money we could-- could--
	Turning it up another two points.
	Be careful. This isn\'t a human you\'re dealing with here.
	<snicker> It isn\'t much of a Vargr, either.
	HEY! What\'s the idea? What are you doing to me? Where am I?
	What is your name?
	Kher-- Kh-- Kh-- Mama! I feel sick! MAMA!
	What is your name?
	MAAMAAAAAAAAA!
	What is your name?
	...
	What is your name?
	...
	WHAT IS YOUR NAME?
	Snarl. Grit. Spit. Name? Name. Name--
	Tsssssssohhhhhhhhhhhhhh-- GUKH!

	"How\'s this one sound," Grant said, shuffling through the papers on 
his lap. Selecting one, he began to read aloud. "Captain James Hudson. 
Smuggler and small-package trader, skipper of the IMSS Inexplicable. Runs 
drugs, guns and occasional refugees back and forth across the Frontier with 
the Solomani. Not well-known, and likes it that way; on Terra to scope out new 
connections." He looked up at Jaeger. "OK?"
	"Very nice." A sharp one, our Captain. Leaves his own story flexible 
enough to include us all. He could\'ve been something, without that damned 
ethical streak. Speaking of which.... "How\'s his profile compare with yours?"
	Grant shifted uncomfortably. "He\'s, uh, well, he\'s sort of what I 
think I would\'ve become if I\'d had a rougher start and a few more bad breaks."
	"Excellent." This is going to be fun, after all.
	Fell finished jotting notes with a flourish. "Hristos von Newton, 
small package broker, pickpocket, cardsharp and second-story man. Utterly 
without scruples or loyalties, other than to himself or to money." He looked 
thoughtfully over at Grant, and began to write some more. "Why does he stick 
with, ah, Hudson? Hmmm. Not loyalty, that\'s for sure. Perhaps mobility? Yes.
Mobility and availability of useful cash flow and muscle. A good base of 
operations. Yes. Yes. It\'ll work...." His voice trailed off and he continued 
scribbling.
	Kherkhoulloth looked over the neat lines of script, and sighed. "Not a 
lot can be done to hide a Vargr in the Rim, but maybe if I go on the mental 
end of things it\'ll turn out OK...." He cleared his throat. "Tsogukh. He\'s an
ex-Corsair and Imperial Marine, discharged dishonorably for excessive cruelty 
to prisoners of war in the Fifth Conflict. A grunt-- reckless, tough, and mean 
as the Ancients." He chuckled weakly. "That oughta get me killed well enough."
	"What\'ll we do for a navigator?"
	"Oh, he does that as a hobby. Self-taught."
	"Eesh." Where does he come UP with these things?
	"I\'ve got Chief Engineer Edison, obsessive-compulsive gearhead and 
certified cybersicko," Sanchez chuckled.
	"I thought we were trying to be DIFFERENT," Fell grinned.
	Sanchez returned the smile. "If you think I\'M bad, wait\'ll you meet 
this guy! He talks in subsections and paragraphs rather than sentences...."
	"I think I\'m going to have to create a virulently pro-Solomani 
identity," O\'Connor said abruptly. "It makes the most sense."
	"YOU?" He\'s lost what\'s left of his mind! "You HATE the Solomani!"
	"Precisely." O\'Connor\'s artificial voice was as coldly efficient as 
ever. "My psych profile will be well-known to the Solomani Security people we 
may run into. It\'s vital that it be buried far deeper than any of yours, and 
covered by something that will deflect all suspicion." He paused. "Wolf 
Nyborg, I\'ll call him. Raised on Scaramouche, arrested for pro-Solomani 
terrorism and forced to enlist in the Imperial Marines as an alternative to 
jail. Nurtured a violently anti-Imperial attitude through his career, learned 
enough about killing to rebuild himself as a death machine, and cashiered."
He flexed a steel hand carefully. "I hope the cybergear they give me can match 
this stuff. What about you, Jaeger? You\'re going to be toughest to explain."
	"Not really. I have researched the Solomani political records in the 
region where we\'re going, and have selected a suitable world for my origins:
Hasdrubal, in the Kukulcan subsector. It\'s a charismatic oligarchy, the family
Tchorgin occupying a position of absolute power and commanding unswerving 
loyalty from the populace. Lord Mikhail Tchorgin of the Family Tchorgin, a 
gadabout and dilettante, was kidnapped by Hudson\'s crew in an attempt to get 
away from pursuing authorities. He fell in with his captors, and his aplomb, 
suave manner with the Solomani authorities, and skill as a negotiator led them 
to keep him on. In exchange for his aid, the crew abides by his behavior and 
gives him the treatment due a Tchorgin, namely respect and deference at all 
times, as befits one of noble birth--"
	That\'s enough. He\'s ready. Shut him down before he makes us all sick.
	Jaeger, or what once was Jaeger, slept.

	What is your name?
	Hmm. Infinite possibilities. Identities as easily shed as a suit of 
old clothes. If it works, of course, but I would be surprised if it didn\'t.
That fellow Cameron seemed quite confident-- of course, it isn\'t HIM in the
chair right now....
	What is your name?
	Oh, bother. It\'s THEM again. What do they want now?
	Can you hear me?
	This is quite amusing. All my lives, lined up like index cards, ready 
to be shuffled and read back at random. Buried original intellect, indeed! If 
they only knew....
	WHAT IS YOUR NAME!
	Ach, this is getting tedious. I suppose I should answer them, if only 
to shut them up. Let\'s see, now....
	I beg your pardon?
	Getting a response now, sir. We must have been off tune a bit.
	Excellent. Hello, can you hear me?
	Of course I can hear you, you fool. You\'re yelling in my ear!
	Ah. Hm. Allright, let\'s try it again. What is your name?
	Ah, tada, tada. Hmmmm. Clovis Cruikshank, Imperial News Network. 
Specialist in tawdry tales of slime and debauchery. You know the type? 
"Innocent Alien Girls Sold to Human Slavers For Houses of Sin," that sort of 
thing.
	WHA-AT? What the hell is he talking about!
	I don\'t know, Doctor. There\'s no "Cruikshank" in the profile!
	There isn\'t? Oh, dearie me. Well, how about Tibor Trench, Private Eye? 
Meanest, rattiest private dick what ever walked the streets of Cairo, hoping 
to score big on his next case....
	Trench? TRE-- Has he gone crufty on us?
	Um, no sir. No. I got a lock on that last name. Tibor Trench was a 
real PI all right; he was in the news a while back as being wanted by both the 
Imperium and the Solomani for smuggling. Crossreferencing-- ah! And Cruikshank 
was the name of the scandal sheet reporter who wrote about him selling slaves 
in one of the INN off-titles. He must\'ve been reading the paper just before we 
came in, or something.
	Ah, that explains it.
	Hook, line and sinker. You fools!
	Did he say something?
	Negative, Doctor. Just random noise.
	Random noise? Don\'t you wish. Hurry it up, I\'m growing bored....
	Let\'s try it again... What is your name?
	Sigh. Hristos von Newton. Or Doctor Christoph Fell. YOU pick one.
	WHAAAAT?!
	Good lord, sir, he must be balanced EXACTLY on the Threshold! We\'ve
never gotten anyone to stabilize there before. We ought to study this while we 
can....
	No time. Give him another half point.
	....Done, sir.
	What is your name?
	Newton. Newton, Newton, Newton. Please go away.

	Memory access. Recent movements and time lapse since last conscious 
period. Repeating request. Repeating request. Respond. Respond!
	O\'Connor frowned; something was very wrong. His internal time scale 
should have kept the time flawlessly while he was out. But now it wasn\'t 
answering at all.
	Run basic diagnostics. Run basic diagnostics. RUN--
	He gave up. There was no answer. All of the systems were shut down. 
Every last one of them. Whoever was working on him had to have been half 
cyberneticist, half brain surgeon. Fortunately he hadn\'t told anyone about his
internal backups. Just a few moments to activate them....
	What is your name?
	Daryavayush Michael O\'Connor. Imperial Marines, Free Space Ops.
	Good, very good. Now relax. We\'re going to increase power.
	Increase power? To what? I don\'t like the sound of that! Let me get 
the backups going, so I can get the hell out of here! 
	He fumbled in the darkness for the backups. They weren\'t there.
	Oh my God, he realized, with sick horror, they\'ve cut them off. 
LITERALLY CUT THEM OFF! My arms-- my, throat, my ear, my EYE-- my, my BRAIN--
	THEY\'VE MUTILATED ME! 
	O\'Connor screamed. He screamed and screamed, until the rising tide of 
blackness dissolved the screams into meaningless gibberings, then into static. 

	"Captain Hudson?"
	"Yo." Hudson\'s eyes flew open. He was lying on a couch in what smelled 
like a hospital ward. His head ached. He sat up, slowly and painfully. "Where 
am I?" He glared at the white-haired man standing by the bed. "Who\'re you?"
	"I\'m J. J. Cameron, of Ling Standard Products," the man replied 
anxiously. "It was our comsat that hit your ship. This is terrible, terrible!"
	"Hit the--" Hudson remembered with a jolt. The crash! The Inexplicable 
had spun in, flailing like a harpooned daghadasi... dagha... Dag? 
	Hudson frowned. Dag?
	"Are you all right? You took a pretty hard hit to the head...."
	"I\'m FINE!" Hudson threw himself angrily out of bed, and looked around 
for his clothes. They were lain neatly over a chair by the bed, and he threw 
them on, ignoring Cameron. "Where\'s my crew?"
	"Waiting for you outside. Please come with me." Cameron led Hudson out 
to the lounge, where four men were sitting and sipping at hot drinks, 
conversing in low tones. They got up hastily as Hudson entered.
	"Back among the living, eh, Cap\'n?" Newton\'s voice had lost none of 
its usual sneer. 
	"Yeah, looks that way. Anyone seen the ship?"
	"I\'ve looked it over extensively, Captain," Edison snapped. "It 
requires (1) minor repairs to forward landing struts (2) extensive stress 
check of Jump drive components (3) rehulling of port fuel tank section aft."
	"Lovely. Just damned LOVELY!" Hudson turned on Cameron with a snarl.
"Your corporation\'s paying for those repairs, mister."
	"Of course, of COURSE," Cameron soothed him. "We wouldn\'t THINK of not 
doing so. We\'re so terribly sorry about what happened...."
	Hudson ignored his plaintive bleatings, and looked hard at Nyborg, who 
was still sitting on the couch, head in hands.
	"Wolf? You all right?"
	Nyborg looked up at Hudson, then stood up. He rubbed his eyes, 
scratched one hand with the other and said, "My hands itch. Sir. And I\'ve got 
a headache. And my eye hurts, the left one. And my ear, too. And I have a sore 
throat. And my mouth tastes like someone went to the bathroom in it. Otherwise 
I\'m OK. Sir."
	"Bitch, bitch, bitch," Newton grinned. "You\'ll be fine, you louse."
	"Of course he will," Tchorgin said indignantly. "Stiff upper lip and 
all that, after all. We shall perservere; what does not kill us shall only 
serve to make us stronger."
	"Yeah, yeah, right," Hudson sighed. "Where\'s Tsogukh?"
	Edison began, "They were having some trouble with him--"
	"RRRRRAAAAAGGGHHHHHHHH!" The bellow of rage and pain split the air of 
the hallway. A door splintered open with a crack, and an orderly came flying 
out backwards into the hallway. After him came an apparition in a hospital 
gown, two-plus meters of tautly stretched, growling Vargr muscle, spotted
dirty brown and black, bandaged about the head. For the barest instant, Hudson
paused. That\'s not right, something inside him said. He was a LITTLE guy. 
	Wasn\'t he?
	"CAPTAIN!" Tsogukh roared. "WHERE THE FTAKHN ARE MY CLOTHES?"
	"Settle down, before you hurt someone," Hudson rapped out. "Your 
clothes ought to be right back in your room, you stupid furball."
	Tsogukh looked over his shoulder, turned and walked back into the 
room, and came out a moment later, zipping up his jumpsuit. "Sorry," he 
rumbled to the orderly, who was just getting up.
	"Okay, that\'s all of us," Hudson nodded. He turned to Cameron. "Take 
us to our ship!"
	"At once. Follow me, gentlebeings," Cameron said smoothly, leading the 
crew of the Inexplicable toward the exit. "And as we walk, let me explain a 
little job opening I have, for a crew that\'s not afraid of working the border
regions...."

          Objsize=Lrg, EMlevel=Faint
 
Remarks:  Because of their small size, low cost and high fire power
\'Wolf\' class carriers are often called upon as commerce raiders. 
A problem with the \'Wolf\' class carriers shown in operation is
their slow refueling and low jump capacity.  While their irregular
configuration allows them to launch their fighters rapidly, they
can not skim fuel.
 
    The \'Cow\' class tankers were concieved as a supplement to
\'Wolf\' operations.  A \'Cow\' can easily support two \'Wolves\'.  More
often it is called upon to support more by making multiple fuel
runs.
 
    When performing as commerce raiders, a single \'Wolf\' and \'Cow\'
will typically travel alone conserving fuel as much as possible to
allow multiple jumps giving the two ships sufficient fuel to travel
a total of jump 3 without refueling.
 
    Ships in class include:  Holstein, Kou, Doe, Mare, Jersey,
Heifer, Nanny, Vixen, Manatee, Bitch, Hen and Goose

          20 \'Wolf\' class carriers) Cargo=1277Kl, PurePlant=24hr,
          Objsize=Lrg, EMlevel=Faint
 
Remarks:  In order to use the heavy firepower of the \'Wolf\'
carriers, they travel in large numbers.  Fleets of one hundred to
one thousand \'Wolves\' are common.  These fleets are supported by
large numbers of \'7-11\' series tankers.
 
    Like the \'Wolf\' carriers, the \'7-11\' tankers prefer to use
their emergency agility to their laser battery.  Normally, they
stay out of the fray and do not fight unless they can not run.
 
    Ships in class include:  Seven-Eleven, Gulf, Chevron, Mobil,
Shell, Merit, Exxon, Esso, Sunoco, Texaco, Amaco, Liberiya Maru,
Manaport, and BP

Remarks:  The \'Thunder Fox\' class light intruder is the Imperial
Navy\'s equivalent of the attack sub.  They operate in wolf packs
of 6 intruders and a core intruder.  The core is identical to the
other intruders with the addition of a factor 1 black globe set to
enclose all 7 ships in the field when they are docked together. 
Together they have a configuration of 0SL.  What\'s it look like?

History:  The best known engagements by the \'Thunder Fox\' class
were the raids by Rainbow squadron under the command of Lt.
Catherine Dragoon (known as Black Cat), in the relief of
Jewell{Spinward Marches 1106} during the Fifth Frontier War.  The
Zhodani 10th fleet were orbiting the planet protecting their
beachhead on the minor northern continent.  Imperial SDB\'s and
other fleet elements from the 125th Imperial fleet were making
small raids on the 10th fleet.
 
    Rainbow squadron would power down to minimum and use long range
sensors to locate targets in orbit.  Then they drifted in with the
black globe up.  SDB\'s would continue to monitor the targets while
the squadron closed in.  Using Maser communicators locked on the
surface of the black globe the SDB\'s could continue to transmit
tactical information to the closing hunters.  With this
information, and by monitoring the light and gravitational energy
input from the black globe in conjuction with inertial navigation
the squadron knew the exact location of the enemy when they dropped
the screen, dispersed and opened fire.
 
    The Zhodani had no warning of these raids.  The raiders could
bring their reactors up to full power with no neutrino emmissions,
all being absorbed by the black globe.
 
    Without any warning, the Zhodani had no defences operating. 
They were sliced up by the quick and agile opponants.  When they
managed to start returning fire the raiders would quickly jump and
escape.
 
    The Zhodani were forced to keep defences powered and manned at
all times, forcing them to keep refueling at a furious rate.  This
put a large strain on their crews.
 
    The psionic officers were hardest hit.  The only way to locate
the squadron with its black globe up was with psionics and scanning
empty space at long range quickly exhausted them.  It is rumored
that many became dependant on psi-drugs from this mindbreaking
labor.  The pressure to find the raiders was heavy; Zhodani society
places strong obligation on psionic officers to protect their
crews.  But as their psi powers deteriorated, the pressure of the
raiders increased as Rainbow squadron got more experienced in the
operation.
 
    In mid 1108 the \'Rainbow Leader\' recieved extensive damage. 
Lt. Dragoon transferred the black globe generator and her command
to the \'Rainbow Vixen\' and continued the raids.  Slowly, Rainbow
squadron was being eroded as the individual ships took damage in
thier raids.  Eventually, after several transfers of command the
black globe was damaged beyond repair.  Lt. Dragoon then took her
last three ships and on 59-1109 broke the blockade out of system
and brought out the first indication to the rest of the Imperium
that Jewell continued to hold out.
 
    Lt. Cdr. Dragoon then returned to Jewell in command of
\'Lightning\' Squadron manned by the veterans of \'Rainbow\' Squadron
where they continued their siege breaking efforts till the end of
the war.  Captain Dragoon was awarded the Starburst for Extreme
Heroism for her actions in the war.
 
Design:  The \'Thunder Fox\' chief designer was John Kellison with
the assistance of a young Dr. Hloch.  Nevertheless, it is known for
the \'Hloch Touch\' ie:  Strong emphisis on agility and simple
control systems such that the pilot need not be distracted by odd
positioning of controls.  The large holo display is only used by
the squadron commander and the black globe screen crew.  This was
the first project Dr. Hloch really got his talons into.  He was
strongly influenced by the exceptionally capable designer John
Kellison.

Remarks:  "Although some older battleships of greater displacement
remain in service, the \'Tigress\' class dreadnaught is the largest
line-of-battle vessel currently in service with the Imperial Navy
in the Spinward Marches.  Each BatRon of \'Tigress\' class vessels
is virtually a fleet unto itself, as each ship carries thirty
squadrons of heavy fighters (with ten FHs per squadron). A BatRon
of eight ships carries 2,400 heay fighters.
 
    At present, only one \'Tigress\' class BatRon is deployed in the
Spinward Marches, assigned to the 212th Fleet, at Rhylanor. 
Additional \'Tigress\' class BatRons  are generally assigned one per
sector.
 
    Deployment:  In war, the ideal deployment of any BatRon is
together, as a unit.  In peace, various \'Tigress\'es are often
scattered throughout a region on peacekeeping missions, or to show
the flag.  Several individual \'Tigress\'es have been deployed among
the worlds of the Five Sisters subsector to enforce the amber zone
blockade of Candory and Andor.
 
    Similarly, \'Pantheress\' was dispatched (much to the chagrin of
the Zhodani government) to recieve the body of the Imperial
Ambassador to Chronor upon her assassination in 1104.  Given the
circumstances of her death, it was difficult for the Consulate to
object.  The ship\'s weaponry was ceremonially sealed, but that
would mean little in an actual fight.  Imperial newstapes treated
it as a propaganda coup for months.
 
    Construction:  The \'Tigress\' class is produced using an armored
spherical hull with the single spinal meson gun mounted centrally. 
A large armored port protects the gun during non-combat operations;
the port itself contains the focussing equipment for the weapon
beam.
 
    Within the sphere, layered decks hold the various on-ship
functions such as quarters, computer and electronic equipment, fuel
treatment, and maintainance areas.  Appended to the back of the
sphere is a large heavy fighter launch and recovery installation. 
Fighters are launched to the rear, to starboard, and recovered from
the rear, to port; this arrangement prevents them from entering the
meson beam when it is in use, as well as providing some armored
bulk between the fighters and the enemy."
 
    -Supplement 9:  Fighting Ships
    Somebody was dispairing that the \'Tigress\' class wasn\'t redone
for Shattered Ships of the Squabbling Imperium so I took a whack
at it.

Remarks:  If you haven\'t read the book, READ IT!  GOOD STUFF! 
Honest!  The above is meant to simulate either the book or movie
version.  Where differences come up I have noted them.  You have
your choice of either a ducted water jet, or a Magneto-Hydrodynamic
drive as the \'Caterpillar\'.  For those who don\'t know about MHD,
essentually, it works by passing a current through a tube of water
running through the ship and using magnetic fields to move the now
\'magnetic\' water.  (Yes, I know that\'s not a very good explanation,
but that is my limited understanding of the process.)  Both drives
are much quieter than normal propellers.
 
    I threw this one together from Harpoon and "Modern Submarine
warfare"  along with George Herbert\'s design notes. (TML-V1:19?). 
For the different drives I used the following.
 
    I got the speeds from Harpoon and used George\'s formula for sub
speed to calculate that 195 Mw would produce the desired speeds.
 
    Ducted hydrojet:  I simply doubled the requirements for the
screws.
 
    For the MHD drive I took the weight, volume and cost of a tech
9 195Mw fusion plant and used that.
 
    For the 650mm Torpedo tubes, I used the following, .5MW, 6Kl,
12 tons, 2MCr.
 
    For the missile tubes I used .1MW, 60 tons, 80Kl, 10 MCr.
 
    The \'Typhoon\' has two interior hulls, these divide the
powerplant and screw drives up.  The Torpedo rooms are similarly
divided with 2*533mm and 2*650mm per room.
 
    In the Traveller universe, the \'Typhoon\' class sub represents
a formidible system defence boat @ TL 8.

To All TML\'ers,
    Please forgive the multiple postings of Scott Kellogg\'s
designs. I realize some people are bothered by them, especially in
large amounts. I\'m leaving for Xmas vacation soon, and wanted to
get all of his stuff to the TML before I leave, and since Scott has
moved recently, (maybe out of my local area soon), there will
probably be fewer postings from Scott in the future.

Since someone asked me for a DGP Writer\'s Guideline. I figured the list might
want to have a copy. 

Disclaimer : I have no connection with DGP whatsoever. Other than that I know
a few people in it.

- ----
 It is important for us to emphasize that you must be serious
 about wanting to write or draw for MegaTraveller. That means you
 are willing to commit to deadlines, and that you are willing to
 be adaptable to our needs.

 Here\'s your first tip to going places as a contributor:

  "Save us doing your work for you."

 For example, if we get your written piece, and it contains misspelled
 words, then WE have to fix them. What that says to us is "this guy\'s
 sloppy. He doesn\'t even care enough to take a few minutes and
 look up words in a dictionary. He\'d rather make US do it." That\'s a
 good way to get on our black list.

 Here\'s another example: if you send us a piece, and you make some
 reference to a prior bit of history and you get the dates wrong (because
 you just put the dates in from memory), then we get real nervous. We
 think: "this guy is careless -- here\'s a reference that is wrong. How
 do we know any of his other references are right?" Now WE have to go
 and check all your references.

 See my point? You should have enough professional courtesy to do your

 job carefully. To many people think they can be sloppy and get away
 with it.

 So if you really want you submission to stand out from the pack, put
 just that extra bit of effort into it to make sure you got things right.
 Do that, and your work will move to the top of the stack every time.

     As many of you may have read in issue #16 of The Travellers\' Digest, we
are currently looking to expand our base of illustrators for our product line -
primarily in the area of interior (B&W) illustrations. Unfortunately, GEnie is
not as convenient a submission vehicle for art, as it is for writing - thus
all interested are still limited to mailing in work to our offices (Digest
Group Publications, 8979 Mandan Ct., Boise, ID 83709).
     We are looking primarily for pen & ink work, but we\'re open to pencil
work if the technique and contrast are good.  Our Artists\' Guidelines go into
detail about our needs.  They may soon be posted here, but till that time, you
can request a copy via GEnie and we can send a copy your way.
     Once again, with the ambitious release schedule we\'re anticipating, we\'ll
need a greater baseline of illustrators.  If you feel your work is good, you
can produce under a deadline, and you have a good feel for the "look" of
MegaTraveller; we\'d like to hear from you.
     Please send all inquiries to my attention:

 WRITING GUIDELINES
 The easiest way to "break into" writing for us is through our magazine,
 The Travellers\' Digest.  (Once we know your quality, we can consider you
 for other products.) We will not take anything too "far out".  Remember
 that everything we publish must be officially approved by Game
 Designers\' Workshop.

 MATERIAL USED
 Query letters: Send a query letter first, not a complete manuscript.
 Tell us what subject you would like to write about, the "slant" you
 would take, and a proposed length.  If we like your idea, we will invite
 you to submit a finished article for consideration.

 If we don\'t like your idea, we\'ll let you know before you\'ve invested
 hours on something we can\'t use.  What usually happens is that we like
 some of your suggestions, but not others. Remember first impressions
 count, so make those query letters sizzle!

 "MegaTraveller Adventure": These adventures take place after Strephon\'s
 assassination; length runs from 2,000 to 8,000 words.  Opportunities are
 rife here.  Adventures for other products like campaign sourcebooks --
 heavy on adventure and background -- can run as long as 100,000 words,
 but we publish fewer of these.

 "Gaming Digest":  A regular column dealing with aspects of roleplaying
 in general and MegaTraveller in particular, running from 1,500 to 6,000
 words.

 "Traveller Tech Briefs":  A regular column dealing with new and exciting
 technology for players and referees to include in their games.  Length
 runs from 1,000 to 4,000 words typically, but longer articles are
 sometimes used for special topics. These are written from the point of
 view of the Third Imperium, not present-day Earth.

 "Medical Digest": A regular column, like "Tech Briefs" but dealing with
 issues relating to high- tech medicine. Length runs from 2,000 to 6,000
 words.

 "Sector Maps, Library Data for the Sector":  This is usually written
 in-house, but exceptions (especially with library data) can occur.
 Query first.

 "Travellers\' Cache (formerly Traveller Arsenal)": A regular feature,
 giving equipment stats, a description, a task library, and an
 illustration for various weapons and equipment available to characters
 in the game.

 Ship Plans: "Innovative" is the key word here. Always query first.

 Other Traveller material:  Query first.

 2300AD material:  Adventures, colony descriptions, rule enhancements,
 character encounters, technology, starships, and whatever...

 MANUSCRIPT STYLE
 Your entire manuscript should be typed, double- spaced, on 8-1/2 x 11-
 inch paper with ample margins on either side.  Please include your name,
 address, and phone number (very important) and the approximate number of
 words.  Remember to number the pages.

 You may also submit articles on a Macintosh disk, in MacWrite format
 (12-point Geneva, ordinary margins), or on an IBM-PC disk in ASCII text
 format. We also accept ASCII text sent to us via e-mail on GEnie or
 Compuserve.

 PAYMENT RATES
 We pay one cent per word (a word is 5 characters, including spaces) for
 all rights at time of publication. This rate is negotiable if you are
 previously published and well-known.  We will also send you two
 complementary copies of whatever product your work appears in.

 We are willing and eager to help non-published writers break into print,
 but they must be serious.

 If you have questions, feel free to contact Joe Fugate, Editor, Digest
 Group Publications, 8979 Mandan Ct., Boise, ID 83709-5850; (208) 362-
 3094. E- mail address on GEnie is J.Fugate.

DGP ART GUIDELINES

MegaTraveller  has established its own unique "look"; in many ways as defined
as that of Star Trek  or Star Wars.   The best way to establish the proper
feel for the look of the game  is to study the illustrations of several of the
artists who have worked on it: William H. Keith Jr., David Deitrick, and Tom
Peters are all fine examples to follow. We prefer for MegaTraveller art to
have a "plausible" or "realistic" look to it, rather than a caricature or
cartoon-like appearance. In some cases, we may deliberately order cartoons,
but these are the exceptions and we will plainly state when this is what we
are asking for.

The best sources to page through for samples of art include GDW\'s Traveller
Book, Traveller Adventure, Library Data supplements, and back issues of The
Journal of the Traveller\'s Aid Society, as well as our own works: The
Travellers\' Digest, Referees\' Gaming Kit,and Worldbuilders\' Handbook.

The Shattered Imperium is a very large place, taking years to traverse in even
the fastest starship. This vastness, by its very nature, makes for a wide
variation in mechanical design, clothing, customs, and so on although there
should be a standard of consistency when dealing  with any of the standard
starship designs.

MegaTraveller has an established technological progression, so take care not
to create out of place technology . . The safest approach when drawing
technology that is part of any faction\'s service is to send us a sketch first
or ask, during the assignment process, where references can be found. As you
can see, having access to a library of the game\'s previously published
material is beneficial to both you and us.

With the advent of the Rebellion, it is not out of place for some
MegaTraveller technology to have a hasty or makeshift look, especially when
dealing with military technology. The battles have  raged on for over 4 years
(gametime), and many of the technological support networks have been disrupted
- - thus, the services have been doing all they could to keep their existing
equipment operational.

STANDARDS AND RATES We are always looking for new artists to support our
products.  If you have not yet sent us a small portfolio of your work, please
do so (send only non-returnable xeroxes) and let us know what you like to
illustrate: spacecraft, aliens, people, spacescapes, etc. Please include a
SASE with all submissions.

We are looking mostly for clean, crisp pen and ink line art or high
contrast/well-toned pencil pieces.  If you wish to produce a work in another
type of medium, please contact the art director before doing so.  We prefer
that the work be produced at twice the published size (i.e., a quarter page
piece done to fit in a 90mm x 110mm space should be drawn at 180mm x 220mm)
and that it be done on durable material, such as bristol board.  If you wish
to use shading film on your work, do not use more than 42.5 line, since it
will not reproduce properly. Please be sure to package your work with a sturdy
backer (like corrugated cardborad) so it does not get damaged in transit. If
sending by US Mail, AT  LEAST send your package with insurance.

Unless an alternate arrangement is agreed upon before hand, payment is made
upon publication (allow a couple of weeks for processing). Our starting rates
are as follows:  $12 for quarter page (85mm wide by 110mm, finished size),
$22.50 for half page (175mm wide by 110mm), and $45 for full page (175mm wide
by 240mm). Higher prices are paid for works by name artists or superior
quality.  Rates for color cover art are negotiable (starting at $250); contact
the art director for further information. In addition to monetary payment,
complimentary copies of the product will be sent to all contributors.

Digest Group Publications buys first North American reproduction rights.
Additionally, we buy all "gaming rights".  This means that the work is not
authorized to be resold/reprinted for use in any other game system. We pay for
all additional uses of illustrations (not including advertising usage) at a
rate of 30% the original price - thus, if we reuse a piece of your work, you
will receive a payment and complimentary copies.  The single exception we have
to our second use policy is with our Travellers\' Digest covers.  When we
purchase those, it includes purchasing the right to reproduce a smaller B&W
version in the opening of that issue\'s feature adventure. All originals are
returned to the artist.

There are a number of reasons that work may be returned for re-execution, but
the primary reasons are that the work is not reproduceable or does not conform
to the conventions established for MegaTraveller. If you are unsure of your
work\'s "accuracy" to the MegaTraveller universe, we encourage you to send in
xeroxes of your preliminary pencils for approval. Please do not send
unsolicited art.  We usually have specific art needs and prefer to give you a
specific assignment.

All portfolios and art-related inquiries should be sent to: Rob Caswell- Art
Director (GEnie address = R.CASWELL); 8979 Mandan Ct.; Boise, ID, 83709. *s

 DGP STYLE GUIDE 
If you are going to write manuscripts for us, you can get a leg up on your
 competition (other writers) if you follow our style. Here, spelled out in
 black and white, are some of our preferences. If you follow these guidelines,
 you immediately eliminate a lot of editing work we have to do to get your
 manuscript in shape -- and, of course, if you save us work, we love you for
 it.

 BAD PHRASES AND WORDS
 Phrases and words we prefer to avoid using...

 Phrase/word     Replace with      Comments
 ----  ----  ----
 due to          because of        "due to" means you owe somebody money
 etc.            and so on         etc. ugly, "and so on" more readable
 utilize         use               avoid all "ize" words, "use" much better
 very            (just pull it)    "very" too general, be more specific


 PUNCTUATION GUIDE

 Using an "em dash" (--) in place of a semicolon (;) is more modern style.
 Use a semicolon only sparingly. Ocassionally, a colon (:) is appropriate for
 variety.

 Examples:

 When generating a gas giant, roll 3D for density; at times this will yield...

 Preferred...
 When generating a gas giant, roll 3D for density -- at times this will
yield...

 Okay once in a while for variety...
 When generating a gas giant, roll 3D for density: at times this will yield...

 Note: DO NOT capitalize the first word of the phrase following the colon (:).

 I wouldn\'t say *don\'t ever* use a semicolon; just limit its use to rare
 ocassions.

 Use "bangs" (!) sparingly! Overuse of the exclamation point weakens the
 emphasis and makes the text look cheap!! So watch out for this!!!


 OTHER GUIDELINES

 We use one space between sentences, not two. Word processing folks use
 two spaces between sentences, typesetters use only one. You can guess which
 camp we view ourselves as being in.

 Use tabs to align text columns, not spaces. Tabs are easier for us to work
 with since we can move directly to typesetting the table. Otherwise, we
 have to manually go in and change all your spaces to tabs the hard way.

 At the beginning of a paragraph, put in one tab for the paragraph indent.

 Any place where you want us to put in a bullet, type a small "o". For
 example:

 o Option 1: This option lets you ...
 o Option 2: With option two...

 and so on.

 Note we do our section headings with all CAPS.

     Is simple: Re-write the code so that the GDW copywrited stuff (I assume
this is tables and whatnot) is stored in a data file.  Then distribute the
code (which will no longer contain any copyrighted stuff) along with
instructions to the user on how to create the necessary data file.  The
user can then generate the file from GDW material, or better yet, from
stuff that he/she makes up on their own.

Megatraveller ships & Vehicles.

This is with regard to the ships posted recently by someone from Sweden
Unfortunately I lost his address so I cannot mail directly to him. 
It appears that there are a few or more errors in those designs that people
might want to know about.

1. Patrol Cruiser Type T-Mk2 and Type T-MFG 
   The Powerplant output of 4428Mw is insufficient to power the ships as they
   atleast require 4800Mw if using antigrav maneuver and over 4900Mw if using
   thrusters. Increasing ouput would likely increse the cost of the ships
   while also reducing its endurance etc. The version I have been using and
   one that has been posted is very similar. However it has a 5008 Mw Pplant
   and its endurance is 14/44 upgradable to 24/71 by using extra internal
   fuel tanks.

2. Vargr ships.
   I was under the general impression that Vargr ships were maxed out at TL13
   and that was the overall max TL for Vargrs. Even though I have seen 
   Kedzudh at TL16 etc. Overall there ships would in general be under TL15 as 
   a rule. Most GDW Vargr ships are souped up TL 11 ships.
  
   Anyway that is my only disagreement with the VF etc.

   However the Corsair is another story. First a model 2 comp is insufficient
   to control over 20000 CP which this ship has. A fairly simple upgrade to
   4 ought to do with slight modifications to other control systems.
   My other question is with regard to the fact that it is such a \'tight\' ship.
   It is barely able to function at TL15 and supposedly it has been around for
   atleast a millenium. Plus a corsair usually/mostly operates far from
   established(read TL15) worlds how do u repair it. On a related note, the
   \'Imperial\' corsair can\'t function on a model 2 either.
  
   So a Vargr corsair at <TL15 say around TL13 would be interesting to see.
   I have designed a few ships and it appears that old Traveller ships have
   major problems translating into MegaTraveller. It seems that under TL15
   those designs are practically unworkable. High Guard seems to translate 
   well unless the ships have anything over a 1 or 2 armor rating.

   However I would like to see more ship designs up here on TML. I would like
   to contact this person on e-mail as I seem to have lost his address. So 
   would the person please contact me.

As Ameer has pointed out: several of the ship designs I posted had
some flaws. Here is the errata:

Place: A battleship somewhere between Capitol and Dlan
Time: Sometime around mid 1118

Lucan <points> "Dulinor is in that ship that\'s escaping at 4Gee\'s, I 
	command you to pursue and capture him, Admiral!"
The Admiral <squirms> "That is impossible, Your Imperial Highness, Our
	Type T/Mk2\'s only has a 3Gee drive!"
Lucan <jumps up and down and proceeds to chew up the carpeting> 
	"I will have that naval architect *shot*!"
The Admiral "Things like this have happened before, Your Imperial Highness,
	Remember when the new designsystem came and all the battleships
	went from Jump6 6Gee Agility6 to Jump6 1Gee and No agility in just
	oner day!"
Lucan <whines> "They\'re all against me! It isn\'t *fair*! I will immediately
	proclaim an Imperial Edict to the effect that all my ships shall
	have Jump6 6Gee and Agility6 and those of the rebels just Jump1 1Gee
	and no agility!"
The Admiral "As you wish, Your Imperial Highness"


The Errata:
Type T/Mk2 and T/MFG:
(correction) Both these ships shall only have a 3Gee drive.

The Vargr Corsair:
(correction) This ship *was* designed with a Model4! The Model2 is
a typing error (All controls fits in with a Model4)

Type VM:
(correction) The computer shall be Model3. The controls 89 Hololink and 
one HoloHud. Price will be 114,233 MCr (incl 20% discount)

Type VJ-14:
(addition) The computer is slightly too small. The Vargr solution is to
add 49kl of electronic (TL7 non-linked) controls at the expence of some
cargospace. These controls is *not* controllable by the onboard computer
and handles the Environment! The Type VJ-14 in generally considered to be
a Red Zone and is to be avoided at all costs!
The data will be: Electronic = 490 units, Wt Power and Cost is inconsequential.

Type VA:
(correction) This ship also requires a larger computer: The Mod1bis is
replaced by a Model2, Price will be raised by 2.4 MCr, cargo will be
4.5 kl less.

Also: I have modifyed the Armour materials table a little making LoTech
materials cheaper and HiTech more expensive. I use a Price Mod of 1.2
for ordinary TL15 starship hullmetal. The price increase visavis the
standard is in nearly all cases just a few %.

The other Vargr ships seem to be ok, But if anyone spots any strange stuff,
please let me know.

Hi all!

Shattered Imperium question:

According to the map in the Rebellion Sourcebook, Deneb is right on the edge of
disputed/dangerous/whatever territory.  Same for Regina.  So where does Norris
hold court?

Also:

1) PC\'s buy ship.  40-year loan.
2) Shortly afterwards, Referee destroys ship.

Is it:

3) Insurance pays off loan?    (i.e., "does such insurance exist?")

Or...

3) PC\'s in debt forever w/o ship.

They don\'t have the ship yet, so take your time...  :-)


Thanks, folks.

- -Bob

I say yes, insurance does exist. I usally make it part of the ships monthly
payment, something like today, car insurance is required by the loan companies
so I would think that this would be a requirement, by the people that loan
monies for Starships.

No problem,

Hi!
I remember someone asked about algorithms for hex mapping a while back
There is a posting on that by Jon Watte (d88-jwa@nada.kth.se)
I repost it here and I hope he won\'t be mad at me (again :-)

Algorythms, I presume. (*I* don\'t have english for native language,
so don\'t blame my spelling)

2 minutes of thought yields:

A hex map can be represented in a plain 2d array. From now on I
presume you are familiar with hex numbering:

0000        0002        0004
      0001        0003
0100        0102        0104
      0101        0103
0200        0202        0204

etc.

One easily notes that every second column is half a hex lower
down. This is no problem; just raise it:

0000  0001  0002  0003  0004

0100  0101  0102  0103  0104

etc.

Now, to display this array (say, array[X_SIZ][Y_SIZ] of char)
you use the following function:

void
display(a)
char ** a;
{
	int x, y;

	for(y=0; y<Y_SIZ; x++) {
		for(x=0; x<X_SIZ; y++) {
			move(x, x&1 + y*2);
			addch(a[x][y]);
		}
	}
	refresh();
}

if move(x,y) moves x == column, y == row (curses is other way round)

Second problem, movement. Say you are in hex yyxx and want to go
in direction d where 0 = N, 1 = NE, 2 = SE etc. (North == up)
the quick & dirty solution is:

void
move(x, y, d)
int *x, *y, d;
{
	switch(d) {
	case 0:
		*y--;
		break;
	case 1:
		*y -= (*x &1) ? 0 : 1;
		*x++;
		break;
	case 2:
		*y += (*x &1);
		*x++;
		break;
	case 3:
		*y++;
		break;
	case 4:
		*y += (*x &1);
		*x--;
		break;
	case 5:
		*y -= (*x &1) ? 0 : 1;		
		*x--;
		break;
	default:
		/* Invalid move */
		;
	}
}

Of course, you\'ll want to check against movements running of
the map too... :-)

These functions do everything for you - it isn\'t any harder
than that !

I agree with Greg Givler, but add that the insurance company is likely
to investigate the claim carefully.  This could add lots of
opportunities to foist bureaucracies and picky insurance officials on
the players.  Wonderful mini-adventure.  If the circumstances are
unusual enough, the characters may be bound up with haggling for months.

Insurance companies are NOT going to let players get away
with anything.

1. Player buys (or leases) an expensive vehicle.
2. Vehicle is damaged or destroyed.
	(actually that was originally "Referee destroys..."
	 that\'s an "Act of God" and won\'t get covered.)

The insurance underwriter does not want to pay for a starship
that he (or she) cannot *guarantee* really was destroyed.  This
is hard to prove when communication is so poor.

The underwriter probably insisted on a clause that said he (or she)
would not pay if the ship was damaged or destroyed by an act of
war or piracy.

The underwrite will try with all of his (or her) might to show that
the ship was destroyed by the players\' negiligence, lack of training,
or whatever.

The cost of even a really cheap starship makes a lot of fighting in
courts worthwhile.  Yes, the insurance is required by the lending 
institution and is payed each month with the mortgage, but that does
mean the players got a good underwriter.

I like it, it has all the good things that a Traveller GM needs,

Report on Damage: "Dear Hortalez-et-cie, Last wonday when my Free Trader "Noisy
Roamer" was parked on Regni starport, Regina/Spinward, It suddenly was attacked
by a large vicious building owned by the Regni Starport Authority...."

If the ship is big and valuable (name a ship that isn\'t :) the underwriter
would probably send out an investigation team to the site of the accident to
inspect the wreckage. (This is a great opportunity for adventures: The
underwriter is the Patron and the PC\'s the ones who are going to do the more-
or-less-covert investigation of a suspected MultiMegaCred insurance scam.)

If the insist on on-site inspections they would probably have a clause that
voids the insurance if the ship is taken out of Imperial Space. (If the under-
writer is a Mega, that is (Hortalez?). If it was insured by a sectorwide or
smaller they might even forbid travel outside one or more sectors.)
In any case: Redzones is a no-no. (and amber might be too, if the players have
settled for the really cheap insurance)

There probably is high-risk insurances for ships doing potentially dangerous
things (like trading in Corridor). But these tend to be *very* expensive and
would have to be payed separately.

Two additional questions:
How much of the total value would the underwriter pay?
and
These Scoutships... Any ideas on iiss policy regaring ex-scouts crashing 
scoutships? I would tend to the wiew that they would look through their
finger if the ship was smashed when it was doing things which was in the
interest of the iiss or the 3Imp. 
BTW "Look through their fingers" imply "not pressing charges", unless the
scout got nobled by the same mission it would probably  have been the last
scoutship that the iiss lent him/her/it.
If it was destroyed during some semi-legal stuff, he would probably be hit
over the head with a 29MCr fine (and perhaps a few years in the slammer)!

James once used that phrase for describing the process of designing ships
for MegaT.

Here are some small notes that I\'ll hope will help people with their dental
work :-)

The dividing of starship components in %-components and tonnage-components
is old and have been rehashed many times in JTAS and TD. 
In essence it is an observation that certain components always take up an
certain % of the ship for a given performance. For example: A jump4 drive
always need 5% of the ship\'s volume (excluding fuel) regardless of the ships
volume.
The tonnage components is the components that have a fixed size (like
staterooms and turrets). A triple Beamlaser turret at TL13 will always have
an volume of 13.5kl regardless of if the ship is an Type S scout or an 
1,000,000 ton Experimental Battle Intruder.

The main %-components is the Jumpdrive, the Manueverdrive, the Lifesupport, and
to some extent, the Agility. (The agility is really shakey, see below)

In the data below, the volume of an component, the powerplant required to
power it and the fuel required to keep the plant happy for 30 days is added
to obtain a % of the ships volume that have to be dedicated to obtain the 
stated performance in a certain area.
For calculation purposes the powerplant is divided into parts grouped with the 
equippment the part powers. In the final design the powerplant is placed as a
unit, of course.

These examples is only correct for TL15 and for ships with total powerplants
over 14kl (and of course for MegaT). Inconsistencies between the components
and the "Total:" line comes from rounding errors.

Jump:
(the % includes the drive and the fuel required for one jump at max performance)

            Jump:   1     2     3     4     5     6 
                  ----
            Drive:  2%    3%    4%    5%    6%    7%
            Fuel:  10%   15%   20%   25%   30%   35%
            Total: 12%   18%   24%   30%   36%   42%


>From this table one might learn that a Jump 6+6 ship is a distinct possibility.
It would need 7% for the drive and 70% for the fuel, and that would leave 23%
for everything else. Riftbreakers anyone?

Manuever:
(The % includes the drive, the part of the powerplant that\'s needed to power
the drive and the fuel needed to fuel that part of the powerplant for 30 days.

    Manuever:     1       2       3       4       5       6
               ----
    Drive:       2.0%    5.0%    8.0%   11.0%   14.0%   17.0%
    Powerplant:  0.6%    1.4%    2.3%    3.2%    4.0%    4.9%
    Fuel:        3.7%    9.3%   14.9%   20.5%   26.1%   31.7%
    Total:       6.3%   15.8%   25.2%   34.7%   44.2%   53.6%

Note that if you want a Jump6 6Gee ship with 30 days endurance you need to
dedicate 95.6% of the hull to plants, drives and fuel!!

Environment:
(The % includes basic env, basic life-support, extended life-support, grav
plates, inertial compensators,  the part of the powerplant that\'s required
to power it and fuel to fuel that part of the powerplant for 30 days)

    Components:  3.3%
    Powerplant:  0.4%
    Fuel:        2.7%
    Total:       6.4%

This means that for a given hull you can only use 95.6% for useful components 
(useful for other things that keeping the crew alive, that is). The environent
% can be reduced by various strategies, such as not installing grav and inertial
compensators for the fueltanks. That will lead to problems with getting a smooth
feed from the tanks to the jumpdrive if you have engaged in any acrobatics
(used agility, turned the ship etc) during the rounds before the jump.
(The fuel will be sloshing around like nuts, and baffles is only effective to
a certain degree.)

Agility:
(The % includes the part of the powerplant that\'s neccesary to obtain the
required extra power to achieve the given agility and the fuel to fuel that
powerplant for 30 days).
The Agility is the most unpredictable characteristic of a ship. It is dependent
on the ships unloaded weight and the excess powerplant output.
The data below assumes that the ship has an average density of 1 ton/kl.
The density of ships varies from around 0.5 for a bulk cargo ship to around 2
for a heavily armored SDB. Large drives, powerplant, or any amount of armour
tend to raise the density and large cargoholds or fueltanks tend to lower it.
The Density for unarmored combatships is around 0.9 to 1.2
This table will give atleast an approximation of the investment in volume needed
to achieve a certain given agility.

     Agility:      1       2       3       4       5       6
                ----
     Powerplant:  1.0%    2.1%    3.1%    4.1%    5.1%    6.2%
     Fuel:        6.7%   13.3%   20.0%   26.7%   33.3%   40.0%
     Total:       7.7%   15.4%   23.1%   30.8%   38.4%   46.2%


Well then: How is all this data used? 
You add together all the tonnage-components (weapons, cargo, subcrafts, state-
rooms and computer etc and the powerplant and fuel for all of this). Then
you compute how much % of the hull is needed to achieve the needed performace.
Divide the tonnage of the tonnage components by this percentage to get the
hullsize. Choose the next larger hull to ensure place for electronics, crew,
sensors, and controls. Design and adjust until it works.
Lets say that you want to design a longhaul cargoship that can transport
20,000 kl of cargo and performs at jump4 and 1Gee (no agility).
The Environment requires 6.4%, Jump4 needs 30%, 1Gee needs 6.3% for a 
total of 42.7%. 
We guess that the crew will be around 10 persons, 10*54=540kl, no weapons,
no subcrafts, Model4 computer: 33kl for a total of 20573kl.
20573/0.427=48180 kl total volume. A 4000 hull (54000kl) seems about right 
and also leaves extra room for electronics, crew, sensors and controls.

Anyone out there care to participate in a play-by-email adventure?

I think I can wrest a little time from my schedule to moderate, if
people would like to play...

If possible, I\'d like to try to run the adventure (campaign if it
goes that far) double blind.  That is, players mail the characters\'
actions in, I try to decode the overall effect, and then post the
publicly visible result.  Communication between characters is OK,
too, if I get a copy. (Referees are notorious busybodies.)

I\'m not sure yet whether to have pre-generated characters, or to
have players use their own.

Public feedback on the list until we decide if this is going to
happen, please.

     Hey, if someone told me that their ship had been attacked by a
*building*, I\'d be suspicious too.  :-)  Really, I think it would
tend to depend on what *type* of ship was involved.  An armed merchant
would, I think, have a somewhat lower premium than an unarmed one,
conditions being what they are these days, since it would be able to
fight back, and thus provide a deterrent to attack by Var...ah,
pirates...  :-)

     At the same time, the insurance problem is probably having at least
as much of an effect on interstellar commerce as, ah, the "current
unpleasantness."  The underwriters have probably marked off large sections
of territory as "too dangerous; go there and void your policy."  A
prudent Captain just won\'t go there, since he can\'t afford to lose his
current underwriting.  Why?  Well, insurance policies usually have ceilings
on how high the premiums can go, so most of the existing policies (at
least, those that predate the assassination) are probably running at
bargain-basement rates (at least, by current standards).  If a Captain
loses one of these policies, he would have two problems:  1) the new rates
for a new policy would be enough higher than his old one that they would
seriously impact his revenues (perhaps enough to slowly bankrupt a free
merchant on a marginal route), and 2) he obviosly did something dangerous
(like going into the wrong subsector) or some such thing to convince his
old underwriter to terminate his policy.  It\'s going to be *very*
difficult for him to find a new underwriter under those circumstances,
and give an added boost to his new rates if he does manage to find one.

 >Two additional questions:
 >How much of the total value would the underwriter pay?

     In most cases I\'m sure they would pay the current market value of
the ship.  That\'s what happened to me when my old car got totalled--I
received the current cost of my old car (an \'80 Mustang).  I had to add
some of my own money to that to get a new car (well, newER).

     That would be a problem--the ex-owner would need a new loan to
get a replacement ship, in a lot of cases (I\'m sure used ships are
selling at a premium, these days).  Unfortunately, losing your old
one would tend to make you a poor risk...

 >These Scoutships... Any ideas on iiss policy regaring ex-scouts crashing 
 >scoutships?

     Depends on what else gets wrecked in the crash.  The ships that are
released to detached duty are getting near the end of their service
lives in the first place.  If just the ship is wrecked, I think the IISS
would tend to say, "Oh well.  Write the ship off."  However, if there was
a substantial amount of property damage as well (like, say, crashing into
a fuel tank farm sited next to a residential area) as possible loss of
life, the IISS would throw the ex-Scout to the local wolves as well as
slapping him with a massive lien themselves.

Play be mail sounds most interesting. I have done it several times with
board wargames (including Fifth Frontier War) with friends who have
scattered accross the country over the years. It\'s great fun.

Idea for PBM: Journal 15 (I think) has an interesting article on starship
reposessors. I\'ve always thought that this would be interesting for a
mail game, with one person/group being the people who stole the ship
and the other person/group the reposessor. I\'m up for it. What do you
folks think?

	Has anyone out there really used the MT space combat system.
If so I have a few questions that I would like answered. 
	1. How do you handle Sensor Tasks. The rules say only one task is
	free next costs one battery of fire. It seems to imply that there
	is no point in having fighters or 100 t ships they only have one
	battery most of the time. As Fire requires two tasks, Scan+Pin
	it seems to be flawed.
I\'m reading this as one SET of scans. Each set being Scan+Pin. Other option 
being that Scans are being done routinely and don\'t cost anything. 1st Pinpoint
is free, 2nd Pinpoint cost one battery and so on.

	2. What about engaging multiple contacts. How do u scan for and engage
	more than one target. A 400t warship probably has 4 batteries and 
	if it thinks it can engage and destroy 4 fighters shouldn\'t it be able
	to? As it is it will need a pinpoint for each fighter that means at best
	it will engage 2 fighters with one battery passed over and one firing
	defensively.

	3. I have mixed feelings on the rule that says that u have to roll
	again if target has moved 1 or more hexes/squares. Even if a square is
	25000 km.

	4. I disagree heavily with the move system in which u can choose any
	speed less than max and any direction every turn. At slow velocities 
	yes but a 1G ship going 750,000 kph going in one direction should
	not be able to in the next combat round to go 750,000kph in the other
	direction evn when allowing for 3D effects. In game terms thats a speed
	of 25 squares/hexes I think. 
I have been working on a very simple(and probably nonrealistic) turn mode 
system with mods for agility and pilot skill.

	5. How do you handle Ship\'sTurret Weapon Skill. Rules say replace
	Comp Mod or Wpn Mod by Skill but If your ship has anything over a 
	Model 3 and a decent UCP factor High Gunnery Skill is meaningless.
I have been thinking of using the HighGuard version: every 2 levels of skill
over 1 give u a beneficial +/- 1 mod. Use for Pilot skill too.

I\'ve never tried any of the PBM games discussed on Notes, since none of
them really interested me.  This, however, sounds like something more
my speed.  I think it might be a kick.

Just for the sake of consistancy, I think we might want to take Richard
up on his offer to pre-generate characters.  This would help the beginners,
like me, mesh with you more experienced folks.

If a PBM game does start up, count me in!

Two people played.

I can\'t remember how long it took in real time; in game time, I have not seen
a game go beyond the second year.  And even before then, the Imperium was
winning; we extended the game for curiosity, to see what would happen.  If it
had gone on till 1111, like the "official" version, there would have been no
Zhodani presence in the Spinward Marches, with the exception of Riverworld and
maybe Cronor.  It is just about impossible to do any damage to the immense
number of SDB\'s present there.

One rule I tried was to allow scout squadrons to be attacked using the
bombardment factor, rather than the attack factor.  The assumption was that the
attack factor represents major weapons (spinal mounts, and possibly bays); the
bombardment factor represents turrets, and maybe bays.  It would be these
bombardment weapons which would be used against the small scout ships.  The
real reason was, it seemed stupid when an Imperial scout squadron met a Zhodani
scout squadron and all they could do was make rude gestures at each other.

The Sword Worlds didn\'t tend to live long.  On turn 6, the Imperials get their
Rimward Forces reinforcements.  The book says they can be brought in on that
turn or any later turn; I bring them all in at once, hopefully with an admiral
with plotting factor 0, and they go and flatten the Sword Worlds invaders,
followed by the Sword Worlds themselves.

There is one Imperial admiral who usually ends up winning the war.  He has
plotting factor 0, tactical factor +3.  Unfortunately for the press who might
want to make a hero of him, his name is Goolanzoon.  There is a similar Zhodani
admiral, but their names all sound weird to us Imperials anyway.  By contrast,
the two supreme commanders have plotting factor 4, tactical factor -1 - they
are a liability to any fleet saddled with them!  They usually get dumped on
some out of the way world, so no fleet has to visit them and get taken over.

hiya,

Count me in any play by email adventure. I\'d simply love to play.

I\'m also willing to comment about any ideas put forward. I tried to figure
out how to run a trillion credit squadron campaign by e-mail.  The big problem
we came up with was how to adequately run combat without turning it too
simplistic.

Running the adventure double blind would be the most entertaining but it
would involve a lot of work for the moderator.

PBM? Well....

I\'m thinking it over. I normally avoid PBM like the plague, but with this
bunch it might be worth trying. 

As for what sort of adventure: A repo scenario might not be bad, and it
would certainly be easy enough to get a starmerc story going, too. I, on
the other hand, enjoy high finance, car chases, and the occasional "whit
whit whit" of a subsonic Gauss pistol from a dark alley. Heh. lots of serious 
headscratching and mystery solving is also a nice touch; kneejerk reactions
involving nuclear weapons have their place, but there are more subtle ways of 
dealing with one\'s troubles.

Where would it take place, and when? The Solomani Rim as the Rebellion really 
gets cooking (1118 or so) is where my own campaign is currently situated, but 
I suppose the Marches are the best known area for most....

[Oh, by the way, folx: I\'m not back from Tenessee, nor will I be for a couple 
more weeks. I\'ve just discovered remote logins. Yippee!]

Back amongst ye,
Thy historian of all things Travellerish,

metlay

PS: What I do NOT like is even easier to sketch out: Overpowered parties
(overpwered villains are fine). People running aliens who act out of character 
("well, he\'s a K\'Kree warrior with a STR of 25 and he likes to be left alone 
and eat hamburgers. What\'s wrong with that?"). And, my most pet peeve of all, 
the one thing I have never seen run or played well in this game: Psionics 
(Take your pick: either "Oh, he can\'t sneak up on me, I\'m reading his mind" or 
"You mean this guy I\'ve been running with for a game year is a psi? Geez, I 
really feel bad about this, but I blow him away when his back\'s turned.").
Sigh...

PPS. I haven\'t much to add on the insurance question, other than to point
out that people had better come up with a more forgiving scenario for the
finance and underwriting of starships, even before Doolie wasted Stref with a 
quick one to the ole cardiac, or I can easily demonstrate that it would be 
economically impossible for anyone other than a planetary or larger government 
to own or operate a starship, period. I would like to answer the other 
question posed in the original posting, though: since the Archdukedom carries 
with it no additional enfiefment, and the fact that the Archduchy of Deneb has 
not had an Archduke for centuries (neither did the others, until Stref brought 
them back, but he never named an Archduke for Deneb), I find it highly 
unlikely that Norris would relocate himself to Deneb upon ascending to 
the Archdukedom. When he\'s not travelling about his domain, putting out 
brushfire wars and screaming at the Lakht Aorlakht, he\'s almost certainly at 
home sweet home on Regina, or on his ancillary lands in Yori.

PPPS. There may be another chapter in the story of Grant and CO. in the works, 
but we\'ll have to see....

anyway, it\'s nice to be back.

ciao!

I have played it twice with friends.
We played for 6 and 8 hours, approx. 10-12 turns if I remember correctly.
We never achieved a decisive outcome, but I think the Imperial side looked
good.
We tried to play by the book, even the rule that makes TankRons almost
impossible to use, unless you sacrifice them.
I like it very much, but have too few traveller-fanatic friends.

Accursed editor!  I have a bad feeling that this is going straight to James,
and not the list.  I also bet that it used the wrong subject.  Sigh.

[Yep, it did.  I spell-checked it, put a meaningful subject line on,
and resent it for you.  I\'d rather people send something, anything, to
me, rather than stay quiet out of fear of administrator wrath.  What I
mean to say is, thanks everyone for the contributions! -- James]

  I have started work (slowly) on revising the traveller rules to more
accurately reflect real world physics in their starship design sequences. 
While it is true that I have not the foggiest idea how much fuel a fusion plant
takes, I would bet it is a lot closer to the gurps statement (The plant
includes fuel for 200 years of straight operation; longer than the designers
expect the plant to last) than the traveller conception (A fusion plant may get
as low as about a thousand miles to the gallon.)  As a result, I am shifting
some percentages about some. Here are the axioms I hope to work under:

  1.  Space is taken up separately for power, locomotion, stardrive, agility,
life support, and living space.  These represent the lion\'s share of the ships
initial volume in many cases.  Power plant fuel is trivial for fission, fusion,
and antimatter (in effect).  Jump drive fuel may not be, if the ship needs to
bleed it off as reaction mass as they travel through Jump space.  Manuever fuel
is mostly used for heat sinking.  The thrusters themselves are reactionless,
but the ship needs to blow off immense amounts of mass to move.  Otherwise, the
numbers make no sense at all.

  Most of the "fuel" used for increased agility and for life support power I am
assuming is used as reaction mass for small thrusters in the first case, and as
raw materials in the second.  If fusion is good enough, one could synthesize
many basic raw materials out of the plasma.  I would bet that TL15 fusion is
that controllable, and possibly earlier types as well.

  2.  The primary limit on a ships capacity is volume.

  3.  Computers are so fantastically adept by the end of TL8 that they can do
just about anything.  The need for controls and control panels is to display
information to the human operators.  Their whole function in life is not to do
the small stuff, but to do the risky maneuvers.  This is why a low engineering
skill does not matter much, while a high one does.

  4.  Anyone with a ship, no matter how bad, is wealthy.  It has a power plant
to power a small city, enough resources to outdo a basic machine shop, and
more computing capacity than the NSA.

  I will get some hard numbers for this, possibly using the neat set of
percentages of hull volume worked out by a net compatriot a few days ago.  (I
do not have my mail folder with me, so I can\'t give proper credit.  It was
posted to the list.)

  I will also let you know on how the "equipment by tech level" chart works
out.  It is coming along slowly. but I have a few items worked out.  I warn
you, I wandered rather far from the tech levels posted in the traveller books
when talking about computers and materials.  The rule is that each tech level
about doubles what came the tech level before.  I also rule that a tech level
is about fifty years of uninterrupted progress.

  See y\'all.  Any suggestions about technical problems in the traveller rules
would be appreciated, as long as I am a-fixing.

  Thanks much

Already there are seven who have indicated desire to participate in
the Play-by-Email adventure.  If your unsure if you want to do this,
GIVE IT A TRY!  We can always kill your character later :)

We\'re currently straightening out mail paths and so forth.  I\'d like
to get the preliminaries out of the way soon so we can start about
the Beginning of February.

This will undoubtedly be a MT variant; I don\'t know the rules well
enough to enforce them strictly at a table.  I\'m not even going to
try that by electronic fiat.  Instead, this will be pretty free-form
until we get the hang of it.

Turns sould be about once each week, and I\'ll just post the general
stuff on this list.  Private stuff will be private - and I\'m not
giving out the addresses of the other players, so if you want to
plan subterfuge with another character mail to me and I\'ll forward
it.

Feel free to use your own characters.  I\'m easy, but one of my pet
peeves is "character inflation".  Use your own judgment.

If there are any more general questions, I\'ll answer publicly.
If anyone has a *particular* kind of adventure they want - something
their favorite journalist has always wanted to investigate, or
whatever, I\'ll listen.

Finally, for this adventure, I\'ll keep it local to the list (even
though there has been some feedback about interest from
rec.games.frp).  Mainly I want to make sure I can handle the load of
this before I expand.

There was a great sector map of the Hinterworlds in _Challenge_ 39.  Subsector
maps, library data...  Nice.  That\'s my vote.  My own campaign is in the
Marches, and life is confusing enough.  I could have a Xerox-attack, if we all
agreed to consider it \'fair use\'.

Oh, I protest!

I ran a long-term AD&D campaign (11 *real* years, at least for three of us!) in
which psionics were a favorite plot thread.  Not overpowered, not invincible.
It was the most dramatic, most mature (in both game and behavioral terms) and
most interesting part of that campaign.  Yes, Psi can get out of hand if you
are careless (or just unprepared).  But the depth of that campaign was amazing.
Those players still talk about reviving that game when we need a *rest* from
Traveller.  (Maybe in another 11 years?)

My current campaign has psionic plot threads, although it\'s been two game years
so far, and noone has picked up on it.  I have great hopes for this campaign
now that all the players have a good grasp of the rules (well, pretty good).

Is anyone else using Psionics in their Traveller game?  What sorts of things
are you doing, and do you have actively psionic players?

Fellow Travellers, I have a problem.  I\'m new to the game (less than a
year) and am playing MegaTraveller (as classic Traveller refs. are scarce
these days).  My dilemma is that none of the MegaTraveller products detail
the entire Imperial (at least from the map standpoint).  I see from the
archives, however, that classic Traveller included something called, "Atlas
of the Imperium", which sounds like exactly what I\'m looking for.

Are these still published?  If not, does MegaTraveller have something
comparable?  I need the bigger picture.

Thanks in advance,

I\'ve never actually played Traveller or MegaT (gasp!), but mostly because when
I started looking for a good sf game, I found 2300AD (was Traveller: 2300 then)
first.  So I\'m tolerably familiar with the task system and the mechanics,
excepting anything that\'s different between the two systems--I think there\'s a
few things--but I\'m not too familiar with the setting.  With that out of the way
   I\'d be very interested in joining a PBeM game.  Sounds like fun.

	Just a rough survey of the game.
>-How long did it run? Real time and play time

	I have only played the game a couple of times and both times we 
	never finished. I remember that setup took quite some time. But
	the rules were fairly simple and easy to play. 

>-Results?

	I the beginning if you are the Zhodane, you should have big successes

	I really enjoyed it although it took a while to play. As I said earlier
	I thought that the rules never got in the way of the enjoyment. 
	so although I have never purchased the game, I have considered 	
	purchasing the game serveral times. That statement in itself says

Well, In Real Life(tm) naval combat a lockon (pinpoint) is in effect until
volountarily broken or broken by the target by heavy manuevering, electronic
countermeasures, or decoys etc.

Disclaimer: All I know about Real Life(tm) naval combat I\'ve learned from 
Harpoon II, Jane\'s Fighting Ships, and a book about electronic warfare.

In Traveller terms I guess this would be translated to that a pinpoint is in
effect until the target has made a task to break it (Max once per turn)
(suggested DM\'s, Pilotskill, Agility, computerlevels, ECM)
The *number* of simultaneous lockons is the real limitation. 
A suggested limit is equalt to the computer number. Model1 or 1bis => 1 lockon
at a time, a Model9 could have 9 simultaneous lockons.

The rules about 1 free sensor task and 1 per battery I would leave alone.
If this was combined with the above changes, It would lead to that a small
ship is forced to spend several turnes to locate and fire upon an opponent.
But a large ship could still not pinpoint several hundred targets and blow
them off the face of space. I believe this is in the interest of game-balance.

There is just one problem, though. When I try to mail you the mail bounce...
<Big embarrassed grin> While I realize that this might be a problem for 
a PBeM, I still hope that there is some way (some path) around it.

Count me in, richard. But a few questions/comments:

1. I think your enforcing a freeform game is of vital importance. Rules
lawyering plus mai delay equals dead game. I, for one, do not plan to rgue
any decisions you render, although I do reserve the right to complain
(privately) if and when someone who knows better does or says something
that\'s inconsistent with the Traveller universe.

2. I also agree with your decision to limit the game to the TML. I\'d also
recommend placing a ceiling on the number of players, and on the number of
characters (pref. 1 to a player).

3. One area in which I will raise a voice of dissent, tho: the choice of
characters belonging to the players already. Before I can choose an
appropriate character I need to know the level of experience, wealth and
power the party will have, and where the campaign will take place. An
adventure for a group of thirty-year-olds is very different from one for
a group of fifty-year-olds; the latter usually have much less stamina and
brawn, but have ridiculously high skill tallies. I personally prefer 
running characters/parties that are down on their luck and looking for a
way out of financial troubles, but if I\'m to be running with nobles who
own their own navies I\'m not going to pick a pauper for my character. 
And so on. I can bulldoze my way through most of these objections, but I
need to know ahead of time, at a minimum, where the adventure will begin,
to within a sector or so. Is this an impossible request?

4. My mailer munges origination addresses. Please post or Email your
own address, so I can direct further communications to you. My Email 
address is metlay@vm1.cis.pitt.edu.

5. And if you need something in the old history books that you don\'t have,
feel free to ask. My job as TML historian overrides any concerns I have
about keeping my character alive. Or anyone else\'s, for that matter. |->

Best of luck, and I\'ll see you all in the Starport!

dim the lights,

Which brings up the question, how do you find a group of people
with whom you can play Traveller (other than PBM Traveller,
that is)?

I\'m just getting started with Traveller (I did play a few times
way back in 1983): I bought and read the Mega Traveller Player\'s
Guide, rolled up a few characters for practice, and think the
game sounds great, but what\'s next? The local game stores have
a few numbers of groups playing D&D and war games, but nothing
for Traveller players.

	So you want to find a Traveller group....

	Good embleer luck, brother. If my own experiences in that respect were 
any indication, you\'re in for a long haul. But I\'m hoping that if I can pass 
along some of my thoughts on the mistakes I\'ve made to you, maybe you can do a 
short-cut on the time I\'ve spent.

	Please keep in mind my perspective on this subject: I consider myself 
a Traveller referee first and foremost. Despite the other games I\'ve played, 
run and written, my first love has always been Traveller, from the day I 
discovered the game in early 1978 until today. Because of that, I\'m much less 
willing to compromise on the people I ref and the campaigns I organize than
you may be. But if you have a good idea of how important or unimportant this 
game is to YOU, then you\'re capable of deciding on how stringently you wish to 
follow my advice. 

	First, examine your own motives. This should be done not only for 
Traveller, but for any game campaign about which you care. Are you doing it 
because you\'re just curious about the way the system rules run? Are you just 
interested in giving SF as opposed to fantasy RPGs a try? Have you heard good  
things about the universe provided by the manufacturer?  Or are you basically 
looking for a good time, with the potential to develop a serious and ongoing 
campaign if it turns out that the rules ARE your cup of tea? These are 
important questions: they determine how strictly you\'re going to demand that 
your players follow the rules (and yourself as well), they let you exercise 
criteria for choosing gamers that are appropriate for the level of interest 
and involvement you desire, and they help you avoid people with attitudes that 
are, while not necessarily "bad" or "wrong," simply not going to mesh with 
yours or the other players\'. Sound complicated? It is. And it should be! In my 
experience as a gamer, all thirteen-plus years of it, I have learned one vital 
truth: People with whom you game on a regular basis become very intimately 
connected to your life. They become, in a very real sense, a significant chunk 
of your circle of close friends. (For some poor folx, they are their ENTIRE 
circle of friends.) You\'d better like them and the way they approach your 
game, or they\'re going to make your life hell. I know; I spent the chunks of 
time from 1979 to 1983 and 1984 to 1987 running games for a strong-tempered 
admixture of people I really liked and people I just put up with, and I 
decided in 1988 during an unwilling and forced departure from gaming that if I 
were ever to run another campaign, I would damn well LIKE the people with whom 
I gamed! And now, in 1989-90, I\'ve done that and am very pleased with the 
results. Give it some thought and compare it to your own experiences; I think 
you\'ll see what I mean.

	Second, I can suggest a few places for finding players, and a few 
places which are, in my experience, NOT good for finding players, and why. 
	It\'s been my experience that posting notices in game stores is an iffy
proposition at best; you get a huge spectrum of gamers, both good and not so 
good. If you want to do this, you should follow two basic ground rules: first, 
list any criteria (level of experience, age, etc.) that you feel are important 
to you on the notice; you then have the right to reject out of hand anyone who 
answers the notice in violation of your expressly stated desires. Don\'t worry 
about sounding like a snob; remember, if all goes well, you\'re going to be 
seeing these people on a regular basis for a long time! Second, never promise 
anyone anything over the phone. Meet them face to face and take them out for a 
burger and fries or something, or run a trial game. But get to know them and 
hear how they talk and act, before you go letting them in. Be honest with 
yourself: do you need the aggravation of dealing with someone who sets your 
teeth on edge? You don\'t have to be impolite, or even to close the door 
permanently on a possible gamer; if they aren\'t appropriate, just don\'t put 
yourself in the position of HAVING to take them. The same goes for running ads 
in either the local gaming papers (if there are any) or in the nationals 
(CHALLENGE has an ad section that\'s either free or cheap that posts requests 
from refs and players all over the world), or advertising on the computer Nets 
as well. But never, never underestimate the importance of meeting prospects 
first!
	Another popular place to meet local gamers, ones who usually have a 
lot of experience in a wide range of games, is the Gaming Club of your local 
high school or college, depending on your age bracket of interest. In 
particular, college Gaming CLubs attract a decent number of grad students and
older folx who are looking for mature gamers with whom to play. In a perfect
world, anyone who walked into a Gaming Club would istantly be beseiged by
interested, interesting people eager to get an exciting new campaign going. 
In practice, however, this is rarely the case. I\'ve dealt with gaming clubs in 
about a half dozen colleges in the past thirteen years; they\'ve netted me some 
of the best and worst gamers I\'ve ever met. Once again, conversation is a 
great way to spot good and bad prospects-- there\'s something about gamers that 
lets you learn volumes about their playing style, just by interacting with 
them in a social situation for a bit. I believe that this largely is due to
the social-interactive nature of RPGs in general. Whatever its source, it\'s a 
lifesaver. Again, remember you\'re not after "good" and "bad" GAMERS, or "good 
and bad" PEOPLE: you\'re learning about gamers who may be "good" or "bad" 
PROSPECTS for YOUR game. Don\'t damn somebody forever simply because they don\'t 
agree with the way you do things. But that doesn\'t mean  you have to put with 
them on a weekly basis for the next year or two, either.

	In your search, it pays to find people who are willing to either learn
the rules to a degree you deem appropriate, or who are willing to at least get
into the mindset of the game. Nothing ruins a Traveller game more than players
who moan, "I *hate* this combat system/time scaling/set of rules of psionics/
what have you! Why can\'t this game have blasters/magic/teleportation/Vulcans/
what have you?" You should make it clear from the outset with whomever you
meet that you\'re getting a group together to play Traveller, that will at
least try to appreciate Traveller for what it is. You\'ll get one of three
answers:
 	1. "Well, okay, but I\'d really rather play (fill in the blank)." 
	2. "Well, okay, but I need to absorb the rules first. Do you mind?"
	3. "Yeah, sure, great! I\'m looking forward to it!"

	None of these three classes is clear-cut in their suitability or lack 
thereof. For instance, if you don\'t have your heart set on Traveller (often, 
people who are having trouble getting a Trav group together are actually 
saying that they\'re having trouble meeting ANYONE who plays RPGs), and you 
meet a good-sized group of likable people who all want to play something else, 
then maybe you should go with the flow on this bunch, and keep an eye out for 
other prospects as you go. (I met all of the members of my current Trav game 
but one, while running a (blegh) D&D variant campaign that took three years to 
wrap up.) People who fall into the second category need to be judged on a case 
by case basis; my current group consists of five people, only two of which  
knew anything at all about Traveller before the campaign began. The other 
three taught themselves on the fly, and did a damn good job of it, too.
	It\'s the last category you have to watch the most carefully, though. 
If you were careful about selecting people before you got down to discussing 
rules, you should be okay, but Traveller, like any game, has its points where 
the wrong sort of attitudes tend to collect. I recently attended a wedding 
reception for a colleague in the Pitt Physics Department, an informal dinner 
where many people from his various hobbies had a chance to mingle. I hadn\'t 
known it but he was a member of a local gaming club, perhaps Pitt\'s but I\'m 
not sure. Anyway, so here I am, getting some cheez nips from the cracker tray, 
when this guy next to me strikes up a conversation, and it went something like 
this.
	HIM: "Hi. You a friend of the bride\'s?"
	ME:  "Uh, no, the groom\'s actually. We work together."
	HIM: "Oh, you\'re in Physics! Okay! I know him from Game Club."
	ME:  "Game CLub? You play role-playing games?"
	HIM: "Yeah, man! You too?"
	ME:  "Well, yes, actually. But he and I have never--"
	HIM: "HOT SHIT, MAN! What rules do you use?"
	ME:  "Traveller...."
	HIM: "TRAVELLER? EXCELLENT GAME, man! Fukn AWESOME! Me\'n my friends 
we\'ve been running this Traveller game for a while now, it\'s gettin\' kinda
lame because the ref is like a total DICK, but it\'s still a lotta fun, I run 
this Imperial Death Squad Trooper with like an FGMP-16 FUSION rifle and battle 
dress and shit, and me and my friends we were doin\' this sorta crossover thing 
with Call of Cthulhu, y\'know? Anyway, we were all holed up in this hotel and 
these things were attackin\' us and I was blowin\' em away, man, ain\'t NO fukn 
Elder God gonna stand up to no FUSION GUN, man, and so I\'m goin\' BABABABABOW, 
just BLOWIN\'em away, when like this total GEEK I\'m runnin\' with screams, 
\'THEY\'RE COMIN\' UP FROM THE BASEMENT!\' and he starts just un-LOADING his Gauss 
Rifle down the stairs, an\'-- SHUT UP, BITCH! I\'m GETTIN\' you yer fukn TUNA 
PATE\'! \'Scuse me a second, will ya?"

	Need I say more? The point is that Traveller doesn\'t suit everyone, 
nor does everyone necessarily suit Traveller. But if you exercise a little 
care and look at the gaming community in general where you live and/or work, 
you can actually do pretty well for yourself. One other worthwhile way to meet 
other gamers, although it\'s hit-and-miss, is second degree referrals: other 
people who are good gamers who are at least on speaking terms with the people 
you meet and whom you can meet through them. The best gamer I\'ve ever played 
with was referred to me by a mutual acquaintance, whom as it turned out 
neither of us could stand playing with.

	The essential point to remember is that there are a lot of gamers out 
there, and your task is not only to hook up with them, but also to hok up with 
the ones you enjoy playing with. If you keep that in mind, you can get in 
contact with ANYONE, even the groups in your local store that only advertise 
D&D interest, and find worthwhile people. At worst, you could do what I did, 
and suffer through a fantasy game for a while while building up a player base!

	Anyway, good luck to you. Let me know if any of this does you any 
good; it\'s a subject on which I feel strongly.

PS. The following is encased in strong personal-experience-only disclaimers:
Traveller is the only RPG I know of that has absolutely no implied sexual 
bias. Women in Traveller are as strong and competent as their male 
counterparts, and there are no overlaid images of "the sexy SF bimbo in the 
skintight vacuum suit zipped open to the navel" like one tends to get in games
like Space Opera and Star Ace. This is a huge plus for Traveller, as it tends 
to attract not only the small but eminently worthwhile subgroup of female 
gamers, but also those male gamers who are able to leave their sexual hangups 
at the door when they come to play, all of which leads to better gaming. Keep 
this in mind when shopping around for suitable people.

	My observations of the talk on running a PBE-M Traveller game have led
me to a couple of conclusions:

  (1)	There seems to be an awful amount of interest in playing the game.
  
  (2)	It also seems clear that there will be too many players for the game.

  (3) 	If we could get a couple of people to run different games it would 
	probably be convenient to all the people who want to play.

	Anyway, I myself would be interested to get in on one of these games.
My only problem is that I\'m more familiar with the  old Traveller and the new
MegaTraveller is "in the mail."

        I agree with Kevin McFadden\'s latest message - there do seem to
be too many people for one game to be run smoothly. Is there any other kind
soul who would be able to GM a game?
        Regardless, while I wish to get in on a game, I\'m a little fuzzy on
some basics. Is MT a "must" or can us "Classic Traveller" people still use
our material? As I\'ve mentioned to our prospective GM, I do think we need to
know a little more about the game, *if* we will make our own characters, or
at least have that option. Particularly as regards equipment and weaponry,
especially.
        Finally, I\'ve sent a couple of messages to our brave volunteer for
GM (whose name escapes me at the moment, sorry!) but I am unsure if you have
got them or if they vanished in the system somewhere. Please contact me here
(sylvain$n@dayton.bitnet - preferred) or at sylvain@udcps2.cps.udayton.edu to
let me know that I can stop worrying. :-)
        I do hope that this gets off the ground, and works!

(WARNING: possible spoiler for the old \'Murder on Acturis Station\' adventure)





hiya,
	I like the idea of a Repo scenario, but I think that something along
the lines of \'Murder of Acturis Station\' would take advantage of the medium
better.  E-Mail makes all player/GM communication private (unless the GM
decides otherwise).  Also E-Mail would make it very difficult to determine if
another character was a REAL player or a GM NPC!

An investigation scenaro like Murder could be challenging (The player character
murderer would be quite exciting.  But, the player might be an NPC and nobody
could tell the difference).



Just some random thoughts.  Any comments anyone?

I\'m still very intested in seeing how this turns out!

About the PBeM game--a thought on characters.
I really like the idea of pre-generated characters--or at least an outline--from

necessarily have or know the rules well can participate.  (Which happens to
include me.)

I feel kind of stupid for asking this, but what is the difference between T
Traveller and MegaTraveller.  I take it that they are set in the same universe--
   is the only difference a rules revision?  Could someone give me a brief outli
   ne of the background.  I\'m afraid I only know 2300AD.
I like the idea of a murder-mystery game, with all players run independently.
That sort of thing never seems to work very well in a standard game setting (I
don\'t mean running independently--that wouldn\'t work at all).

Sorry, but GURPS is wrong, and Traveller is much closer to being correct.
For the drives alone it can easily be shown that the "thousand miles to
the gallon" is correct.

First of all, there was a paragraph buried in the original rules that 
gave fuel consumption as an option. I worked it out and it gave an Isp
of 600,000 for the drive. (which incidentally matches the figure given
for a "fusion drive" on a chart that NASA seems to have put in 90% of the
secondary school classrooms in the US during the 60\'s) Isp relates thrust
and fuel consumption as follows: Isp =thrust(in pounds)/fuel consumption
(in pounds per second). Astute readers will notice slight problems with
dimensionality in this calculation. More astute readers will realize
that this is expected when one uses the same unit for mass and force. 
Anyway, to get 6 million pounds opf thrust with such a drive (same as a
Saturn V) you need 10 pound per second of fuel. This is enough to move
a 3000 ton ship at 1g. So much for 200 years of fuel...

If you want to figure it yourself, the standard rule of thumb is that a
fusion reaction converts .1% (.001) of the reaction mass into energy. So
you can figure from that how much fuel in needed to get how much energy.
This gives an lower limit for fuel consumption. It\'ll likely take more as
the equipment isn\'t going to be 100% efficient at turning the energy released
by the reaction into power or thrust, or whatever.

Ah, the grand war. . .  I have rather fond memories of arriving at a
convention, all set to run a session of Traveller, the premise of my
adventure was that the players had been hired to make first contact
with a rather nicely located planet before the _EVIL_ Zhodanis could.
The players had been told that the Empire was very close to war with
the Zhodanis and that they should be careful.  I had just finished
briefing the players when one of them who had hit the dealer\'s room
held up the new JTAS with "WAR!" in large letters across the cover. .  .

The game went really well by the way.  Every character was created
secretly.  Everyone of them seceretly worked for a different side in
the universe.  They picked one of the Zhodani spies as their leader. .  .

I can tell more about the adventure if asked.  We were refered to as
"The Traveller display hit by a hand grenade."

There seems to be considerable interest in a PBE-M game - perhaps too much.
But what type of game would be best suited for our situation - a large
number of individuals running around ?

Well, I would suggest that a "treasure hunt" would be ideal.  Perhaps
something like this...

	"One of the richest and most eccentric individuals in the
 	 known universe died recently. His will contained only the
	 following text:

	 The source of my wealth will be given to the first person
	 or group who finds and understands my question to the following
	 answer.

			Answer: A cat from Alcyon

	 good luck..."

No, Atlas of the Imperium is out of print. It might be possible to 
find it in some obscure stores, though.

For MegaT there has been talk from DGP about UPP\'s for 35 (?) sectors
on computer file. 
(A quick calculation makes an estimate of atleast 150kbyte)
A note in "Worldbuilder\'s Handbook" said that it would be available in
january 90 but it seems that it has been delayed.

     Yup.  Tough to run.  Not really in and of itself, but more from the
way some players (try to) use (abuse) it.

     There\'s a solution to this one.  I\'ve had to deal with it several
times ("I\'m just walking along, listening to the mental currents...").
The solution is...Psionic Strength Points.  Okay.  Joe Munchkin\'s new
*favorite* character "Biff the Absurdly Over-Muscled" has a PSR of 10.
He wants to walk along using telepathy as a warning device.  The Ref
says, "Okay," and, unbeknownst to Joe, strikes off one point *every ten
minutes*.  Yes, that\'s right--he uses up his psi in just over an hour
and a half.  Then, later, when he wants to use his psi in, say, an
interrogation, the Ref says, "That\'s unfortunate--you used up your psi
points hours ago, running continuous telepathy."  Needless to say, Joe
will try to "book lawyer" his way out of this (if necessary, he\'ll
whine) with some (usually quite creative) misinterpretation of the
rules.  The Ref\'s attitude should be, "Tough."  Eventually, Joe will
learn the lesson of Traveller Psionics (see below).

     I haven\'t seen this one, since my players tend to take the
pragmatic attitude that *any* extra power in their hands is a good
thing that might come in handy later.  Of course, this doesn\'t mean that
*NPCs* feel the same way...  :-)  Seriously, though, this kind of
situation is a perfect example of the other half of the Traveller
Psionics Lesson:

          Psionics are neat and flashy and can (occasionally) be useful,
          but they don\'t buy you enough to be worth the effort.

     Think about it.  They\'re hard to get (Psi institutes are *very*
rare, not to mention difficult to find), by the time you get them,
you\'re probably old enough that you have a very low strength, and they
provide a source of continuing danger to the possessor.

     Once a party figures this out, psionics ceases to be a problem.  At
least, that\'s how it has worked for me so far.

On page 21 of the MT Referee\'s Guide, there is a listing of the planets in the
Regina system.  Now the maximum orbit determination shown on page 26 says to
throw 2D for both primary and companion stars, with modifiers up to +8 listed.
That seems to indicate a maximum orbit of 20.

Now, the listing shows Thermidor, Olybrius, and Alise orbiting Cent, but Alise
is in orbit 25.  The remaining planets outward orbit Assiniboia, with Harcourt
at orbit 30 and Regina at orbit 55.

a)  I don\'t get this, and am reading it wrong.

b)  This is a typo.

Can anybody help me out on this?  My players are looking at some in-system
travel, (next session) and I am at a loss to tell them how long it takes.
(A a travel-time from Regina to Harcourt is my immediate goal...)

Thanks.

	I don\'t know how widespread Renaisance became but I will bring it up
anyway.  Basically it was a Traveller campaign that pitted players against 
each other; physically and economically.  The way I remember it was that each
participent decided what type of character they would play.  Examples of 
this are smuggler, merchant, pirate, etc.... You could also be the head of 
a populated world or system of worlds. These last ones also included keeping
your people happy, fed, all the problems we have now.  I don\'t really have any
specifics but I remember that it was played "blind."  No player knew who the
other player was... for all you knew you could have been attacking your best
friend.  If anyone knows of it let me know, or if there is enough interest I
could get my friend to try and hunt down the guy who ran it.

Hi,

I\'ve been reading the Traveller PBE-M discussion with great interest
and would love to play!

Seems heaps of people are interested in PBE-M Traveller roleplay.
Anyone interested in PBE-M Fifth Frontier War/TCS as well??

Jim Cunningham mentioned he\'d played Fifth Frontier War PBM. This has the
advantage that the mechanics for a PBM FFW are already reasonably play-
tested so there shouldn\'t be any hiccups in the rules. As Paul (grue@...)
mentioned we tried working out a PBM TCS but got bogged down in combat.
If FFW has already been converted to PBM all that much better.

Unfortunately, I\'ve never played FFW and know only the a basic outline
of the game.  I guess that it could probably accommodate quite a few
players though, one player per major fleet should be optimal.

Incorporating the "fog of war" rules from TCS (i.e. each fleet admiral
knows only what intelligence information he is given by scouts, local
planetary bases, etc. And no one has complete knowledge (except the GM,
of course!) about current locations/sizes/etc...) could make it interesting.

Comments? Suggestions?

Eric.

I\'m not sure that the Isp is usable for reactionless thrusterplates...
This "fusion drive" is probably more similar to the "fusion rocket"
in the COACC.

I looked fusion up in a physics textbook and it states that for standard
deuterium fusion with all its secondary stages. (First deuterium fuse
with deuterium to produce various hydrogen and helium isotopes and free
neutrons and assorted other radiation. Then some of these products fuse
to make some more energy.)
The book gives the energy gained from fusion of one atom of deuterium
(including all byproducts etc) to 13E-13 Joules. 
The occurance of deuterium in hydrogene it states as 15 to 100,000.
(Deuterium is a hydrogene isotope).
One gram (1E-3 kilos, 1E-6 tons) of hydrogene contains 6.023E23 hydrogene
atoms, and will thus yield 11E9 Jouls. 
One ton of Tech15 plant uses 0.009 tons of H2 per hour.
This translates to about 99E12 MWatts per per kl of plant per hour or, in
other words, 99,000,000 MW per kl of plant...

(I hope I havn\'t done any errors too big to explain away:-)

Hi all-

I expressed interest in in playing the email game (like everybody else),
and I\'d still like to play, but it\'s plain that the interest level is pretty
high, and I wonder if Richard is going to have time/energy to integrate 20
different turn responses every week or so...

Is there any way that a second pair of fingers might help?  Possibly as part of
the double-blind setup?  As an alternative, possibly a second campaign.  I
would be willing to volunteer as a helper, or possibly a second referee.

In my experience, more than four players makes life hell for the referee, and
makes campaign depth and complexity difficult to maintain.  How many people are
we really talking about?  Some coordination is necessary.

I\'m sending this to the list, rather than Richard, because I\'m not really sure
if he\'s getting my side mailings.  ("Richard, blink if you can hear me...")

FFW by mail was a blast. A friend of mine was reffing, and another friend
and I sent him fleet movements, combat orders, etc., which he would then
resolve and send back to us. The fog of war element added a great deal
to the game, and adding this to the game system which already involves
a great deal of fog by requiring players to plot several turns in advance,
made this real interesting. Add to this the fact that the ref threw in
a few outright lies to simulate glitches in inel gathering and you had a
real mess much like trying to plan and run a real war. PBM also has the
advantage that your opponent is not sitting at the other end of the table
waiting for you to make your move. If your schedule is as hectic as mine,
its handy to take a half hour or so when you have it and study the map.

The only real problem with the game is play balance (read: it\'s impossible
for the Imperium to win) due to the game being rushed through production,
but this can easily be fixed by altering the victory conditions and/or
increasing the Imperial reinforcement arrival speed. If anyone wants to
get a game going, I\'ll be happy to dust off my copy along with the PBM
modifications which we made up. Because of the amount of traffic (there\'s
a helluva lot of paperwork involved) I\'d suggest using U.S. mail
for this.

I was disappointed when GDW did almost nothing with the war in terms
of adventuring. There was quite a build up for the war (as licensees
we got to hear the story ahead of time, which was great fun) but them
they didn\'t do much with it. The same seems to be true for the Shattered
Imperium-- the few adventures which have been done only barely touch
on the subject.

This sound s like just what the doctor ordered I think that being able 
to play an admiral in the Zhodane or Imperial fleet would be a hoot.

I have been looking for war games that do just that, think of being Lee
approaching Gettysburg, not know who or where Meade was, thinking that
Reynolds would be a better choice. Not having your cavalry to give you
the intelligence to make rational decisions. This is what a war simulation
is for me.

These are certainly new things to try in FFW!

My apologies to all of you who have responded to my request to start
a play-by E-mail game.  Immediately after posting to the list, I
discovered (well, er, uh, more like got kicked around by) a serious
bottleneck in mailing from oresoft.  I\'ve been experimenting with
numerous addressing methods to work around it, and think it\'s just
about licked.  I will get around to checking mail and so forth
*real soon now* 

Enough people have responded to warrant either two parties or a
large expedition.  Let me know what you prefer - or rather what your
characters prefer.  I will probably have one or two "shills" (aka
NPC\'s), but you won\'t know who they are; the *patrons* might be
player characters :).

Please give some thought to making your character multi-dimensional.
Get into his/her/its personality.  How old are they?  What are their
hobbies?  Why are here?  Do they like people?  Do they have old
emotional or physical scars they try to hide or show off?  Are they
rebels or conformists?  

Don\'t tell anyone (necessarily).  Just try to keep these sorts of
things in mind.  It will make for much more interesting character
interaction.
	Richard

No, it isn\'t. I did similar calculations for High Guard back in the bad
old days
and came to the same conclusion: the power plant/manuver drive did not use
enough fuel to account for the kinetic energy of the ship after
accellerating at
say, 1G for a month.
	The problem is that the MT manuver drives are not rockets! The fact
that they are reactionless has a fundamental effect on how much energy can be
given to the ship in the form of velocity. See below.

Your physics looks fine to me. The way the rules stand, fusion powerplants
are hideously inefficient. It is even worse than your calculations show,
because
you assume the hydrogen has not been enriched in deuterium in any way --
meaning that more than 99.9% of the fuel is just thrown away, or vented for
cooling, or whatever.
	The problem with the Mega-Traveller power plants and manuver
drives is very subtle. The inefficiency of the power plant is masked by the
remarkable (read: physically impossible) efficiency of the manuver drive.
Having a reactionless manuver drive not only lets you violate Newton\'s
3rd law (reaction for action), but conservation of energy as well! As far as I
can tell, it is impossible to have a reactionless drive without this property.

Example: Take a standard scoutship, which masses 916 tons full, has drives
that require 350 Mw to accellerate it at 2G\'s, and has enough fuel for a month.
Suppose it accellerates for a month in one direction. At the end of the
month, it
is travelling at 5.08E8 meters per second, giving it a kinetic energy of
1.182E23 Joules.  During that month, the drives have used 3.5E8 * 3600 * 24
* 30 = 9.072E14 Joules, giving an effective efficiency of 1,303,000,000%
(I want a drive like that for my car...)
	The energy to power the drive doesn\'t have to come from a fusion
plant. It could just as easily come from batteries, or lots of people
riding bicycle
generators. The fact that it usually comes from fusion plants just helps
to hide their extravagant fuel use.
	The fundamental problem is that the manuver drive uses energy
at a constant rate, but gives the ship kinetic energy that goes up as
the square
of the time, assuming constant accelleration. This means there is NO fixed
number for drive power consumption that won\'t eventually start giving you
free energy, after going in one direction for long enough.  Sooooo.... if you
want your system to be consistent, you have to give up either reactionless
drives or conservation of energy. I personally favor keeping the drives,
because they work in game terms, which is really the important part.
	The powerplant problem is more serious, because fusion plants are
used for things other than powering ship drives.  The MT fusion plant outputs
and fuel usage are lifted directly, unchanged, from Striker. This bothers me,
since it makes fusion plants not much better than fuel cells in terms of fuel
use per unit of output. Since they just took the numbers from Striker, and
made them apply to starships as well, I would prefer to go back to the
numbers from High Guard, which worked better (1 kl of fuel to power 1 kl
of plant per month at TL15, instead of 6.48 kl fuel per kl of plant as
it is now.)
If you think things are bad for starships, try designing a robot with a fusion
power source....

	Anyway, I thought people might be interested in the results I got.
Comments and error corrections welcome.

*I know* have requested a slot in the Play-by E-mail game coming up
shortly.  There might still be a few I\'ve missed so don\'t panic if
you don\'t see your name.  Everyone who wants to should get in.

Bob Mahoney						Bob Moynihan
Gerald Williams					Fredrick Krage
Nicholas Sylvain				Greg Givler
Joshua Cunningham				Cynthia Lee
Dan Corrin						Steven Owens
Jan Peterson					Eric Halil
(Mr?) Bertil (Please send your name)

So anyway, those of you who sent in your requests early, never to
hear from me *DONT PANIC*.  You should all get mail in a day or two
(I hope).

This was, unfortunately, not a test.  Thanks for your patience if
not your understanding.

With the large number of people who have expressed interest in a pbm game
I thought I\'d just sit on the side and watch, but no, my desire to play is
to strong.  So if it works count me in too.

As to character generation.  I think having people inform the GM as to the
type of character they wish to play, being as vague or detailed as desired,
and have the GM generate/supply the charater that best \'fits\' the scenario
would be a good idea.  This way the GM can  also assure that some skills 
that are essential to the scenario are out there.  A few well placed unusual
skills can also act as a good misdirect.

I would also be interested in a FFW PBM if someone else can ref it.  I
think having 3-4 people per side would be kind of neat.  I could finally
dust off that copy in my attic and use it again!

Count me in if anyone plans to run such a puppy.

Oops, I seems to have made a fumble mishap. Well, that\'s what happens when
one uses a book to gain a temporary skilllevel :-)

The MWatt should have been Joules. This changes the final figure to
27500 MW per kl. Coming from a lump of machinery 1m x 1m x 1m this sounds
somewhat large (to say the least) , so the best solution might be to reduce the
fuelconsumption.
On the other hand, TL15 can be used to justify almost anything :-) so a simple
solution is to increase the fusion pp outputs with a factor 1000.
That way on kl of TL15 plant will produce 6 * 1000 MW, and if it was
part of a 14+ kl plant 6 * 1000 * 3 MW (18,000 MW) which is resonably close
to 27,000 MW.

A suggestion, why not correct both things and with the same amount? If both
energy production and energy consumption is increased, lets say, 1000 times
(volume etc left untouched) the net change would be zero (Aside from a
net gain in space available, because the volume of the part of the power-
plant thats dedicated to supply the non-drive components is reduced by a
factor 1000.
Of course, the definition of agility would have to be changed, or else every
tom, dick and harry would have a ship with Agility 6.
As a definition of agility I would like to suggest the enery required to 
make the ship rotate along its long axis with a certain speed.
This way, agility would be dependent on the mass of the ship *and* it\'s
configuration. (A ship with lots of stuff sticking out here and there is
harder to turn than a ship shaped as a sphere.)
Presumably, ships with AirFrame config should also get a agility bonus when
manuvering in atmosphere,because they can use aerodynamics to make faster turns.

My Physics is a bit rusty, but bertil\'s calcuations seemed a bit wrong to me:

> The book gives the energy gained from fusion of one atom of deuterium
> (including all byproducts etc) to 13E-13 Joules.
O.K. I don\'t know any different here.

> The occurance of deuterium in hydrogene it states as 15 to 100,000.
> (Deuterium is a hydrogene isotope).
Fine

> One gram (1E-3 kilos, 1E-6 tons) of hydrogene contains 6.023E23 hydrogene
> atoms, and will thus yield 11E9 Jouls.
Here is where I have problems: 
Via Avogradro\'s number one mole contains 6.02217E23 atoms (minor correction)
One mole of hydrogen weighs 1.008 grams (again minor correction)
	1 gram contains 5.9742E23 hydrogen atoms
at 15:100,000 this is 8.9613E19 deuterium atoms
at 13E-13 joules each this is 1.1656E8 Joules

> One ton of Tech15 plant uses 0.009 tons of H2 per hour.
> This translates to about 99E12 MWatts per per kl of plant per hour or, in
> other words, 99,000,000 MW per kl of plant...

0.009 tonnes is 9000 grams, at 1.1656E8 Joules each...
now we have 1.049E12 Joules per kl over 1 hour, one Watt is 1 Joule/second
divide by 3600 seconds in an hour, gives 2.9140E8 Watts
which is 291.4 MW of output per kl of plant... (assuming 100% efficiency,and
non-enriched fuel).

I suggest that you recheck your figures. You have that starship traveling at
5.0e8 meters/second. But lightspeed is only 3e8 m/s!! And at 1 g, ignoring
relativistic effects, it\'ll take nearly a year to reach lightspeed.

A month at 1 g gives a velocity of 2.5e7 m/s. This is 1/12th lightspeed and
close enough that you\'d have to worry about relativistic effects a bit.
(tau=.997) 

The figures *I* mentioned came from the original 3 books. And there was
nothing in there about the drive being reactionless. That\'s an *assumption*
that was made by so many people that it became official.

A "reactionless" drive can be handled by assuming that it "pushes" on the
rest of the universe. This would give (in effect) double the efficiency
of a reaction drive. Gravitic effects work that way, but then you\'d have to
explain why the people inside the ship experience *any* acceleration.

BTW, nobody ever asks what happens to all the helium (and unfused hydrogen)
with reaction drive, no problem. It\'s the exhaust. But on a ship with a 
reactionless drive, you either store it, or dump it. Both require changes
in the way things work. 

Dumping it means you leave this nice trail of helium for the sensors to 
pick up. Storing it, means that the tanks aren\'t empty (and leads to
other problems as well).

Here are the initial guidelines and intro for the E-PBM:


1.  Generate you own character (The one individual who asked me to
    do his - I shall.  Just give us all a few days to get the mail
    working.)

	One character ONLY!  And try to keep inflation down - especially
	if its one of your old favorites.  If you\'ve got a few really
	neat items, I want to know (so the bad guys can be prepared.)

	Keep your character handy.  I don\'t really need to know lots of
	detail about him/her/it.  I do need to know: race, general
	career (scout, journalist, demolitions expert, Imperial fleet
	tactics officer, etc), and general age and condition (right
	forearm prosthetic/cloned, retired old scout curmudgeon, etc)
	Have this information ready when we finally get these x-boats
	running on schedule :).

2.  ALL OF YOU CAN PLAY!  Briefing follows:

	You have been recruited to perform an
    in-depth, in-force reconaissance of an apparently dead ring
	world.  We need several teams; one for contact, one for
	exploration, one for security, one for scientific and historical
	analysis, one for transportation.  Team leaders and mission
	commanders will be selected from the volunteers.

	For security reasons, you do not need to know the exact location
	of this discovery.  Navigators will be given coordinates and
	programs when needed.  The exact details of the missions still
	need to be worked out, but your primary objectives are:

		a) materials, processes, and technology
		b) historical information about the authors of the structure
		c) arms, armor, and weapons of strategic and tactical value
		d) medical knowledge 
		e) other, as assigned

	Some of the volunteers on this mission will have psionic
    training, and medical teams will be issue psi-enhancing drugs.
	psi-screen devices will be available from ship\'s stores.  Let\'s
	try to keep our personal prejudices to ourselves, I\'m sure
	everyone who volunteers has our best interest at heart.

	[REFEREE ASIDE - if you, as a person, like or dislike psi in
	play, this seems to be a good time to tell your character to let
	it show through.  We might get some good infighting going on.
	As for whether it works, well I\'ve ref\'d it before and all the
	players loved it; let\'s see what happens.  At worst we\'ll just
	off the buggers :) ]

Please count me in on a play by e-mail game.  I just joined this mailing
list and hope I am not too late to play.

  I know and have the original traveller rules and have played, but do
not own MegaTraveller.

  I think that the (previously made) suggestion that players send in a
basic or detailed outline for a character and the GM fills in the
details sounds best to me.

For those participating in the E-PBM that\'s statring up:

I don\'t care whether you use the original Traveller rules,
MegaTraveller rules, or even one of the many variants that has been
seen through the years (such as in White Dwarf magazine).  This is
true for characters and for your own personal task rolls.  Just pick
one and stick with it (no choosing best of three...)

My aim is to have a mutually enjoyable sience-fantasy adventure in a
universe that is *mostly* MT-compatible.  That is, I am going to use
MegaTraveller rules as the basis for the vast majority of decisions
I make.  The game will have the "look and feel" of MegaTraveller (I
hope), even if I fumble a few ref-critical task rolls myself :)

Because of the inevitable time delays with mail, you will note a
certain "laissez faire" approach to things.  This puts a little
additional burden on the players, but should add to the realism
(whatever that is) of the play.  id est: don\'t bring your favorite
character, just to gem him/her/it shot right away by someone else\'s
favorite character.  I can\'t/won\'t prevent it, and it won\'t be much
fun anyway.  If you\'re going to antagonize the party (vs co-operate),
do it subtly, so the adventure continues, and your character has a
chance to make a getaway.

Any more questions?

About the discussed Fifth Frontier War PBM game. How about
making it a multi-player game with each player an admiral?
Each one doing his best to implement orders, gaining
intelligence, getting reports back to superiors and coping with
unforseen circumstances? The GM could assign the admirals
randomly to players. Whoever has the senior admiral on each side
will be in Commander-in-Chief and formulate policy (And don\'t
forget that the Darrian, Vargr and Sword World admirals will have
objectives which are distinct from those of their respective
allies). Any non-player admirals should be junior to player
admirals, and plotting factor would be dropped (since that is,
I gather, a device to simulate the information lag that is
absent from the board, but would be there with a vengeance in a
PBM game).

I\'d love to participate in such a game, but would need some
information, since I don\'t have FFW (alas). I do have the
Megatraveller map of The Spinward Marches and a copy of the
FFW rules.

    they don\'t show up.

Well, sort of.  The C-in-C can formulate all the policy he/she/it
wants, but policy directives should be routed through the ref to take
effect when and if the ref (and the receiving admiral*) decide that
they arrive.

*Of course all of your subcommanders are trustworthy and would NEVER
fail to receive an order they disagreed with.

Never?

No, never!

Never?

Well...hardly ever...

PS: I\'m both very interested in playing and rather snowed under; have
a copy of the game (played once) but no clear place to set it up; etc.
Looks like I\'ll have to wait for a second run later this year (hope
there is one).

Dropped a decimal -- should be 5.08e7... thanks for catching that. That
means the drive will only be 13,000,000% efficient. Oh well.

from my post:

I was referring to Megatraveller. Check the Ref\'s Manual p.56:

"This new, artificially generated force pushes against a vessel\'s
`thrust plates\' themselves, which make true reactionless thrusters
a reality for starship-sized vessels."

Not until MT was the power consumption of the manuver drive given
(High Guard had power plant energy point figures, but that was in
addition to powering the drives.)  There was never anything in the
old set that said the manuver drives were rockets, either. Everyone
I ever discussed it with assumed they were rockets, as did I, since
that was the obvious explanation for the high fuel consumption.  I don\'t
know what Marc Miller and co. intended them to be at that time. Metlay?
My guess is that they were intended to be reactionless all along, otherwise
why switch?

This would cause BIG problems for warship design, since the limiting factor
for many designs is power for weapons, and this would make it 1000 times
easier to get.....  It would probably work better to reduce the fuel needed
for the power plant, while keeping the output the same.

Once more into the breach!
Damn the torpedoes.  Full ahead!

1.  I can *hear* all of you just fine.  I\'m receiving your mail (a 
	veritable flood of it - gee this is fun!) at both intel and
	oregon software.  You can write to me at either address - use
	the one that works better for you.
	
2.  I\'m now switching ot plan "B" - I\'m going to try to use the 
	intel address for mailing out.  You\'d think a software company
	could make its !@#$% mailers work!

3.	Consequently, you wil ALL get a new mail test messages, even if
	you already got one.  To date, no one has confirmed receipt of a
	test message - even though they haven\'t all bounced.

4.	Thanks for the offer Bob.  I\'ll let  you know.  Right now,
    though, I have a couple of non-net players who have offered to
	help with a lot of the grunt work.  20 messages a week?  No
	problem - right now I\'m bouncing 20 a day!

	I\'m not really worried about the overhead.  Check the list for
	the preliminary mission briefing.  I think we can find a spot
	for everyone to be happy.

5.	Thanks to everyone who is still interested, even after this
    fiasco.

I will send you a copy of it.  

Why did I write it in C++?   I wanted to start learning the language and it 
seemed the thing to do at the time.   

This same program is being co-developed in Lattice C for a MSDOS machine at

"virtual objects" won\'t work! :-{   GRRRR!

Any takers?

Check out the job openings below and decide what you want to do -
I\'ve got plenty of adventure for all (I hope).  At least I got ideas
enough to keep you all busy for a while.

Each team will ideally have 5 or 6 characters.  You should expect to
have your character participate in at least two teams; for example
an engineer with an assault rifle.  

Send your conceptions to me, so I can assign them and get back to

[suggestion for defining agility as the amount of energy required to rotate
the ship about its axis at a certain rate]

Sorry, but rotating the ship, and changing course have nothing to do with
each other. Check the rules on plotting space combat in the old rules or grab a copy of MAYDAY. Both use correct physic in showing the result of course changes

If you are going "north" at 5 km/s, and you use the engines to give yourself
5 km/s of "east" velocity, you are now going "northeast" at 7.07 km/s! You have
to kill the "north" velocity and then add the "east" velocity if you want to
go "east". This could be done with one "burn", I *think* it would be a 7.07 km/s
burn applied in the "southeast" direction!!

Ain\'t physics fun?

ps. don\'t evenn *think* about arguing that the drives can get around this via
"magic" physics. This stuff is taking place in an area of physics where we
know what the loopholes are. (If you want "inertialess" drives, that\'s a 
different matter, but don\'t forget to watch you intrinsic velocity!! :-)

What is the opinion of the readers in this group concerning compatibility
between Striker/High Guard and Megatraveller.

The reason I ask is because many of the tables in the Referee\'s Manual
are copied directly out of Striker or High Guard (with few or no changes).

Should these Megatraveller tables be the same?

Specific examples are the armor tables (they changed the armor toughness 
values -- Striker) and the configuration costs (High Guard).

Things such as computers were wrong to begin with.

If you have any comments at all about this stuff, please send them to me.

Thanx in advance.

Imagine two ships: 
The first one is a fast smuggler with Manuever 6 and Agility 0
(He trusts his engines to keep away from trouble)
The second one is some type of fighter with Manuever 6 and Agility 6

The smuggler is trying to penetrate a RedZone and the fighter is there to
stop such cases of hooliganism.

They have agreed to use the old Traveller (vector) rules :-)
(In fact, I think that the new MegaT system of Space combat movement is
quite unrealistic, To be able to stop travelling by "circling in the same
square", SHEESH!)

In the combat, both ships would move in a totally similar way, since there
is no provision for the effects of agility in movement.
(Of course, it would still affect firing (if they used higuard  or MegaT 
for firing).

That a course change from "north" to "east" requires a "southeast" burn is 
pure "Vectors 101", But the problem is *HOW* to *MAKE* the southeast burn.
Since the trustors works best pushing the ship forwards, a ship wanting to make 
a burn in a certain direction would have to turn to that direction before making
the burn.

Agility helps to make the ship harder to hit, presumably by enabling it to make
small, rapid changes in course. This would indicate that the agility is a 
measure of the ships ability to change course rapidly (It has been stated 
officially that the agility is a measure of the ships ability to change course)

If the agility is a measure of the ships ability to change course, and ships
change course by first turning, then burning,and the Manueverrating is the ships
ability to make the burning, then the Agility must mean the turning.

In the example above this could be implemented by plotting which way each ship
points, and letting high agility ships change this direction faster than the
low agility ships. This would make it quite simple for the fighter to follow the
smuggler, and give agility a real impact on space combat aside from just being 
the ability to "jinking" the ship to make the opponent miss.

For those making the ultimate mistake of playing around with a
ship design system (all right, all right, I\'m glad I did because I
ended up with one I like, but it took a LONG time), and wondering
what kind of Isp, etc. you get from fusion drives, my method may be
helpful.

I cheated.

According to ON CIVILIZED STARS, and a few other sources, a Daedelus-type
fusion pulse starship can reach between 12% and 15% c as a terminal 
velocity.  I understand the Isp for this vessel was about 1,000,000.  I
have been told by people who know physics a lot better than I do that 
the D-He3 pulse system the Daedelus people talk about is inefficient,
that fusion drives using a containment system to raise the temperature
of the plasma to enormous levels and then direct the superheated plasma 
as high energy reaction mass could give much higher Isps.

Suffice that, all things being said and done, I assume a standard fusion
drive and 30% of your ship\'s mass dedicated to fuel will give you a peak
velocity close to 2% c.  If you were loony enough to build a multi-stage
vessel with the Daedelus\' 50-to-1 fuel-payload ratio, you could get a 
terminal velocity (no way down) of about 30%-35% c.  Of course, if you
want to build a stl starship, the real choice is matter-antimatter, which
I have arbitrarily placed as being 10 times better than fusion--a single
stage vessel with 30% fuel can go to 20% c and decelerate down again,
multi-stage vessels can reach true relativistic speeds.

In other words, I assume that fusion drives with several thousand years
of technological improvements, scientific breakthroughs, and engineering
refinements behind them can do 2 to 3 times better than the early 
prototypes being designed by people who were still (at the time) 50
years away from producing controlled fusion power.  Or am I being
too optimistic?

Stuff about Mayday, I would have included the mail article, but we have
changed vaxes so the system is without any type of emacs support. And
I don\'t know vi at all.

I remember playing Mayday once. It was quite fun and very physics intensive.
Also, I remember that the game took forever. We did a space battle between
to 100 ton Scouts with triple turrets, Laser, Sand and Missile. It is 
quite an interesting game.

In addition to the discussion on velocities and vector addition:

Things aren\'t quite so simple (as simple addition) when speeds approach c (speed
    of light: 300 000 km/s).  because the net velocity can never exceed c, a
"horizontal" thrust can decrease "vertical" velocity.  Special relativity gets
really weird at times (this is relatively ordinary.)

To Dow, and Bertil, and the other wranglers over fusion drives:

There is no official line about the operation of maneuver drives in
Trav Classic, to the best of my knowledge. The information was codified
and made "official" by Digest Group, probably with no knowledge that
they were asking for trouble from people who could work out the math.
I\'ll be honest: I avoid starship combat like the plague in this game,
and when I need a starship designed, well, I, uh.... Oh, hell, I may
as well own up and be honest. I get *Dow* to do it for me. There, I\'ve
admitted it, I\'m a lazy slob who can\'t stand the aggravation of 
haggling over tonnages when the drives can generate enough free power to 
push ANYTHING. So sue me. |->

Anyway, for what it\'s worth (that and 50 yen gets you a video game), I have
always assumed that fusion drives were reaction based. It makes maneuvers
like the Jerusalem Shuffle take on a whole new meaning.

Agility: it is amazing how much is required to keep from getting
sucked into these discussions :)
(was Starship design revamping)

Bertil Jonnell and someone (please forgive me for fogetting your
name) have been discussing the role (roll?) of agility in space
combat.  I\'m afraid I\'m no clearer now than when I read the rules.

Let me summarize how I see things:

1.  The MOST acceleration you can get is 6-g.  Period.
		(Rules)

2.  In space there are 6 degrees of freedom; 3 linear, 3 rotational.
		(Physics - ignoring time)

3.  A change in any one degree of freedom will have no change
		on the others.  (Physics again)

4.  Agility is a figure you use (somehow) to determine who has
		"initiative" in a space combat (I think?) or you use to
		deterrmine how easy it is for your ship to make `sudden\'
		changes in speed or direction. (Rules I think)

5.  Agility is a number between 1 and 6, inclusive.  (Rules)


One of the following two is (I believe) the proper way to interpret
the rules.  Which one?

******* EITHER:

`agility\' is a number you *subtract* from you maneuver number 
to find out just how much acceleration you can get in a real hurry.  
i.e. if you have maneuver 4 and agility 1, you can get 3-g `right now\' 
and 4 once you line up the axis of the ship with the direction you 
want to go.

******** OR:

`agility\' is a value you can *add* to your maneuver figure to 
indicate how you could overstress the drives and hull in emergency 
situations (like combat) for short times.  i.e. if you have a maneuver 
4 and an agility 1, you can get 5-g `right now\' and 4-g only a `short\'
(whatever that is) time later.

Which makes more sense, both in terms of rules and "the real
universe"?

- ----
Technical comment - related but not directly to the above...

The effect of either of the above scenarios is the same.
Space battles become `running battles\' or set-piece battles.  Even
at the maximum short-term 12-g limit of the second method, you could
not actually maneuver fast enough to escape the guns behind you;
those guns can rotate much more slowly and still track.  The *best*
you can hope for is to break their lock-on by sudden, violent,
maneuvers (aka jinking) until you can enter hyperspace or get help.
The second-best is to turn and fight.  There is no real advantage to
a high maneuver number except that it lets you get away.

Of course there\'s always JATO boost. :)

Some remarks on Agility --

	According to the Ref\'s Manual, agility is "the ability
to change your craft\'s orientation over time". It then gives a
rather poor example involving the _Queen_Mary_ and a rowboat.
The example is bad because water resists passage strongly, and
can be pushed against while space does neither. However, the
definition does look reasonable. In the Starship Operators\'
Handbook, published by Digest Group and an official part of
Traveller, the operation of the manuver drive and agility are
discussed in detail.
	The manuver drive is a collection of "thruster plates"
that push the ship (reactionlessly) in whatever direction it
wishes to accelerate. The key to agility is that the plates
are more effective in one direction (usally forward) than
others. Thus, like rockets, the ship has to change its
orientation to face in the direction it wishes to accellerate
in order to use its drives at full effectiveness. In order to
change its orientation, the "best" method according to the
Handbook is to rotate the ship around a central gyroscope
of superdense material spinning at several million rpm\'s.
The other method discussed is using attitude jets.
	My understanding of how agility works is that a high
agility ship can change its facing very quickly (in a matter
of seconds) so it can change its direction of thrust.
This enables it to "jink" rapidly, throwing off fire since
at the ranges for space combat (~25,000 - 250,000+ km) the
speed of light delay becomes important. It doesn\'t matter
how large the absolute velocity of the ship is, because the
ship\'s future position can be calculated and aimed for
("leading" the target); the important part is the how quickly
it can change its vector. Any ship can vary its vector in the
direction it is pointing by pulsing the drives on and off, but
this gives only 1 degree of freedom. The ability to change the
direction of thrust quickly (by turning the ship) allows the
ship to jink in any direction, thus making it harder to hit.
	How the ship converts its power to agility (using the
formulas given), and how much is needed for optimal dodging,
is a different question. I can try to check out the reasonablity
of the formulas if people are interested.
	If anyone has questions, comments or corrections, let
me know.

	Xboats in Megatraveller

	I don\'t know if anyone else has tried to design Xboats
using the MT design rules, but I got some interesting results
so I thought I would post them.
	When I built my first Xboat according to the specs from
Traders and Gunboats (Jump-4, no manuver drive, 2 staterooms, etc),
I ended up with room left over. A LOT of room left over -- more
than half the ship! I added a 1G manuver drive, since the reason
the original Xboat didn\'t have one was lack of space. There is
still a lot of space left over, so you can put more stuff in if
you want. Maybe it could be used as a cargo carrier...:-)

	The only change needed at TL13 is to double the size and
cost of the powerplant, with a slight increase in fuel.
	I don\'t know about other people, but if I were a scout
I would much prefer this ship as a mustering-out benefit. A
cargo capacity of ~50 tons and Jump-4 would make for a quite
good merchant, and its cheaper than a scout to boot.
	I have designed quite a few ships, mostly merchants
and small warships/pirates, so if there is interest I could
post them. Comments welcome.

It depends on two things: 
1. MegaT does not require a ship to have a bridge. That\'s 270 kl extra to
play with.
2. MegaT jumpdrives draw much less fuel than before. But, fuel for one jump-2
does *not* equal fuel for two jump-1 anymore!

Regarding Xboats:
There is enough room to easily fit a Jump-6 drive, and perhaps, enough
fuel to power *yet another* jump at jump-6. It all depends on whether the
manueverdrive runs at full power during jump, or if it just powers the 
Environ and Controls, and if you refrain from installing certain parts of
the environment stuff in relatively unusable parts of the ship like the 
fueltanks. (May have som effects by non-smooth feed of the jumpdrive and
resulting higher frequency of misjumps, though)

Regarding this Xboat:
I am not sure, but shouldn\'t a ship have a computer with a number equal to the
max jump it can perform? I\'m sure this was the case in {Old|Classic|Version1}
Traveller, and I assume that this have not changed...

I\'ll try to post the very strange design I got on file at home: The proof that
is is possible to make a scoutship with Jump-6 Manuever-6 and Agility-6, 
What? Cargospace? Weapons? Well, no, not really, but is such things really
necessary? :-)
(It is a design that assumes that the fuel consumption en-route in jumpspace
is low.)

Obligatory Joke:

Paranoid Player: "All this is really yet another proof that the *real* reason 
behind why the Xboats is just Jump-4 is that the Imperium wishes to keep
the great unwashed in the dark when issues of importance arise!"

Other Player: "Oh, I always thought that \'the great unwashed\' was a K\'Kree
vaccsuit!"

     I just took a look at Supplement 9, Fighting Ships, and the Xboat was
listed as a *TL10* design.  I haven\'t had any time to check this out with the
design rules (and won\'t, for that matter, for several days), but would this
make a difference?

     Again, the reference I have handy (right under my Amiga, as a matter
of fact, in the keyboard garage) says TL10.  Then again, it also gives TL9
for the Type S Scout/Courier.  I can remember getting a substantial
improvement on that by upping the Tech Level to 15 just with High Guard
rules.

The first of those is probably from "High Guard", in which Agility also acts
to hinder incoming fire from meson guns and particle accelerators. (The roll
to hit gets the target\'s Agility subtracted from it.)

> 5.  Agility is a number between 1 and 6, inclusive.  (Rules)

Between 0 and 6.  A ship might not have a manoeuvre drive, e.g. X-boats.

> One of the following two is (I believe) the proper way to interpret
> the rules.  Which one?

"High Guard" calculates a ship\'s agility by dividing its available power by its
tonnage.  "Available" means power which isn\'t needed for weapons, computers,
etc.  Which means that some ships can have 0 agility, even if they have working
manoeuvre drives.  A type S scout ship with a pair of lasers is one example.

There is also "emergency agility".  To work this out, divide the ship\'s power
by its mass.  Forget weapons, computers, etc. - this is an emergency, we want
to _move_!  However, the emergency agility may not exceed the ship\'s manoeuvre
rating.

That\'s the quick\'n\'dirty way.  Assuming the ship doesn\'t have a big enough
power supply to drive all weapons, computers and manoeuvre drives at once,
I allow calculations to be made on how much power is given to weapons, how
much to manoeuvre, etc.  The agility is then calculated as usual.  Allocating
power like this gives the engineer PC something to do.

This is something I never liked.  All weapons are in turrets.  A ship ought
to be able to have fixed weapons.  Either the same weapons, but taking much
less space; or bigger weapons in the same space.  In particular, a fighter
ought to be able to take a big missile on a fixed mount, instead of those
small 50kg things in its turret.  That way, it might be able to do some harm
to a decent sized ship.

In your article (W. Dow Rieder), you states that there is LOTS of room left
over in the Xboat.  I don\'t have the new MT rules, but there is still lots
of room left over in the old High Gaurd rules.  As I recal in Traders and
Gunboats, it says that all that extra space is used for a VERY big computer
to store and encrypt/decrypt the mail that is being sent along the route.

So if you were to take out the computer(which as I percieved, was around
20 tons), you would have room for a manuever drive and cargo.  But also
don\'t forget that the X-boat is not streamlined.

Hi!
I remember someone asked about algorithms for hex mapping a while back
There is a posting on that by Jon Watte (d88-jwa@nada.kth.se)
I repost it here and I hope he won\'t be mad at me (again :-)

Algorythms, I presume. (*I* don\'t have english for native language,
so don\'t blame my spelling)

2 minutes of thought yields:

A hex map can be represented in a plain 2d array. From now on I
presume you are familiar with hex numbering:

0000        0002        0004
      0001        0003
0100        0102        0104
      0101        0103
0200        0202        0204

etc.

One easily notes that every second column is half a hex lower
down. This is no problem; just raise it:

0000  0001  0002  0003  0004

0100  0101  0102  0103  0104

etc.

Now, to display this array (say, array[X_SIZ][Y_SIZ] of char)
you use the following function:

void
display(a)
char ** a;
{
	int x, y;

	for(y=0; y<Y_SIZ; x++) {
		for(x=0; x<X_SIZ; y++) {
			move(x, x&1 + y*2);
			addch(a[x][y]);
		}
	}
	refresh();
}

if move(x,y) moves x == column, y == row (curses is other way round)

Second problem, movement. Say you are in hex yyxx and want to go
in direction d where 0 = N, 1 = NE, 2 = SE etc. (North == up)
the quick & dirty solution is:

void
move(x, y, d)
int *x, *y, d;
{
	switch(d) {
	case 0:
		*y--;
		break;
	case 1:
		*y -= (*x &1) ? 0 : 1;
		*x++;
		break;
	case 2:
		*y += (*x &1);
		*x++;
		break;
	case 3:
		*y++;
		break;
	case 4:
		*y += (*x &1);
		*x--;
		break;
	case 5:
		*y -= (*x &1) ? 0 : 1;		
		*x--;
		break;
	default:
		/* Invalid move */
		;
	}
}

Of course, you\'ll want to check against movements running of
the map too... :-)

These functions do everything for you - it isn\'t any harder
than that !

Suprisingly few for yes, most had time constraints. Though I\'m sure
all of us have school/jobs (or both in my case :-)
Programmer:
YES:		3 	NO:		5 	YES/PROBLEMS:	4
We can assume all programmers will test, however a few people testing
who didn\'t develop the code is good.
Tester/consultant:		3 

If you would like to program, would you be interested in being lead
or co-lead programmer (you would be responsible for coming up with
the preliminary design)?
I placed reluctant yeses, and time constrained people in the co-lead
position. Due to limited number of programmers, this seems kinda heavy
on the leader side.
YES:	1 	CO:	3 	NO:	3
(The only yes was mine..I guess i\'m the voulunteer).
People for Co-lead are:
	Peter Berghold
	Richard Johnson (Design)
	James Perkins
	Bill Morrison (Post Xmas? - Listed as No)

Do you think we should use a co-ordinated programming effort using
software engineering techniques, or should we proceed in an ad hoc
manner with everyone contributing as they have time?
Wide opinions on this one.(note "\'s are teken from peoples
responses)...Coordinted wins out:
"Is this project so complex that we need formal techniques?"
"A co-ordinated effort is a *must* (this means software engineering
   techniques)." (Good thing I am in the process of getting a
master\'s in Software Engineering...)
Most of you specified that it should be fun. I alwyas find that coding
something I like is fun. However if we are to have a good product, there
has to be a certain level of coodination.
Co-ordinated:	7 	Ad-hoc:		2	Both:	1

Do you possess knowledge in the following areas, and to what degree?
As expected a wide variety of backgrounds, For the scale, None, some are
self-explanatory, though I had to guess sometimes as to how a person\'s

General Implementation Considerations
- ----
(On to the more difficult/subjective questions....)

   System Considerations - This is to provide a general direction for deisgn.
   ----
   If Build 1 is one program that generates strict Traveller/MegaTraveller
   systems, what do you envision Build 2 as being (eg. more functions
   to build 1, a planetary information generator taking input from
   the build 1 program, a trade/X-boat route generator taking input
   from build 1, etc)?
This was probably the least understood question particularily the
concept of "build". Actually Bill\'s response to his own question was counted
as "confused" - all the people who never really got around to answering the
question  perhaps it is me that is confused? :-)
Planet info:	5 	Maps:	1	Confused:	5

   How should we represent the (as yet unkown) data types?
   [Binary/Record | ASCII] [Single File | Multiple Files]
(This may be a design problem anyway, but preferences from the user is
important - actually the hardest part of design is the specification, as the
user doesn\'t know what he/she wants, ie. the entire questionaire is really
a ploy on the part of us software engineering types (Bill and Myself):-)
(One Enterprising person already has a basis for the file structure)
Strong opinions on this one, binary was perferred by some solely on space
(ie. they don\'t have much, ASCII for readability)
Binary:		2 	ASCII:		8 	Both/Either:	2
Unanimously (of those who answered this part) Multiple files.
Single:		0 	Multiple:	9

   Should our production system be one program or a series of programs?
   If a series of programs, how should we break them up (physical, political,
   scale [sector, subsector, system, planet], other)?
One:	1
Series:	9	Scale: 4	Order:	1	Compatability: 1
It looks like series wins out, the method of splitting was in contention.

   What co-ordinate system should we use for sector numbering?
   [Reference|Galaxy Centre|Other]
As far as I know there is no "official" numbering scheme, the sectors are
referred to by name, however computers perfer numbers, and referring to
them by name (index in name file) is actually an "other" sector numbering
scheme)
Reference:	4 	Centre:		2 	Any/Unsure:	4 
Other:		1

   Should we include some data items used by other gaming systems
   (E.g. Galactic Conquest, Exploting Space, Other Suns, and Space Opera)?
I guess the result of this is to include the other system stuff as an
option, perhaps at compile time, so the data files don\'t have extra fields.
Yes:	7
No:	4

   Should we include religion generation (for example from the world builders 
   handbook), as this may be offensive to some?
Ditto.
Yes:		5
Optional:	4
No:		2


   Capabilities Considerations
   ----
   The following is a list of capabilities that may eventually be included
   in the final build of our system. On a scale of 1 to 10 (1=soon,
   10=later), please indicate at what stage a certain feature should
   be included into our system. A "1" generally means \'to be included in
   build 1, and a "10" means \'to be included in the last build before
   production - if at all\'. Remember to add your own write-ins.

The first numbers are the responses, the last the average. If you
want other statistics (ie. median, std. deviation) calculate them yourself.
I don\'t guarantee the averages, but the raw data should be correct.

First Build Considerations
- ----

These are general items/capabilities that we may want to consider for the
first (primitive) build of our generation system. Please feel free to add
items at your descretion. If you feel an item should be left for a later
build, please indicate with "LATER". Also, feel free to elaborate on any
item you believe needs more attention.

   System Considerations
   ----
   Should the first build be one program generating strict (only
   information currently in Traveller/MT/World Builder) systems (This
   would be the frame around which everything else is built)?
Yes:	8	No:	1

   Should we generate our system from scratch or should we use the
   "real" system generator or James Perkins\' system generator as a
   *framework* around which to build our system (This means re-writing
   some of the code in those systems to conform to our deign)?
(An interesting note here...james voted in favour of a scratch start)
(one person\'s note was to use the parts/subroutines in JP\'s program, or
the Real program as a basis, ie. scratch, using some old stuff.)
Yes:	3
   Real:	0
   Real/3D: 	1
   James P:	1
Yes/Scratch: 5

   If we use either of these systems, should their capabilities by
   included in build 1 or in subsequent builds?
Build 1:	5	Subsequent:	0

   Should the first build be one program unto itself, or should we
   begin with our \'series of program\' from the start?
One:	3	Series:	5
   
   How much control over the random generation do we want the user to
   have (UPP(system) level, stellar level, planet level, or more)?
(One person suggested using a constant seed on a pseudo-random number
gerator as data, the problem would be, keeping the order constant ie. if
I generated the solomani rim first, and someone else did the spinward m.
there would be no consistancy, and if we did it in a pre-determined order,
you might wait a while for the data on world 10000.)

Little:	3
Some:	2
Much:	5
 Editing:	2
 Interactive:	2

   Compatibility Considerations
   ----
   Please indicate if you feel that we should seperate output for each
   "compatibility level", exclusively target one system, or whatever.

(No also include those who don\'t care if the output is compatable at this level)
   Traveller Compatible:
Yes:	9	No:	1
   MegaTraveller Compatible:
Yes:	10	No:	0
   World Builders Handbook Compatible:
Yes:	8	No:	2
   Other generation system(s):
Yes:	5	No:	5

Subject: Table handling routines
To: morrison@gatech

[I think people on the Traveller Generation list might find this 
interesting, maybe even useful...]

I\'m  working on a set of C subroutines to use and manipulate tables, 
such as are commonly used in FRP and computer games.  I\'m posting 
this message for two reasons.  I\'d like some beta testers, and I\'d like 
some feed back on the features I\'m providing, to make sure I\'m writing  
something that others will find useful.

Here is the design, please give me any feed back you have:

There will be one public data type (table_t) and a small number of 
function calls:

tb_read:    Read a file containing a table into the program.  These 
	    tables will have a simple format, which will be easy for 
	    a person to create and modify.

tb_tbl:     Prints out the table in troff/tbl format.  Mostly for 
	    debugging.

tb_use:     Makes a dice roll on a table, returning a character string 
            result.

tb_dump*:   Dumps a table in a human unreadable format.

tb_load*:   Loads a previously dumped table.

tb_choose*: Given a number, returns what rolling a number the table 
            would have given you.  (tb_use uses random numbers.)

tb_query*:  Returns information about the table.  Possible queries
            include, a tables name, the sort of dice rolled on it,
            (for multi tables, the list of column names, etc.)
               

Functions marked with a \'*\' have not yet been implemented; please tell 
me if you think they should be.

Inside the implementation there will be several types of tables, 
although this will be hidden from users.  Each table includes a name, 
the dice roll (ie "1d100", "2d4+1", etc.), the source (p24 of Greyhawk, 
for example), and the information on mapping dice roles to results.

So far I have three types of tables, simple, multi, and change:

Simple tables look like this:
(roll 2d4)
2   first-result
2-6 second-result
7-8 third-result

Multiple tables look like this:

(roll 1d4)
roll   elf dwarf human
1       1    1     0
2       3    3     0 
3-4     4    7     1

And change tables look like this:

(roll 1d8)
light normal heavy   result
 1-4    1-2    1        1
 5-8    3-6    2        2
  -     7-8   3-8       3

Specific questions:

1. New table types?
    a. What other types of tables would you add?

2. New function calls?
    a. Which of the functions marked with a \'*\' do you want the most?
    b. Which of the functions marked with a \'*\' do you want the least?
    c. If you want tb_load/tb_dump, please say why.  Is it to load 
       tables as quickly as possible, or to have tables which can not 
       be read by users of the system, or both.  Should this dump format 
       be machine dependent, or does it not matter?
    d. What queries would you support in the query function call?

3. Scripting and Debugging?
    What sort of debugging would you want?

4. Right now, adding a new table type requires a relink, so it can not
   be done "on the fly".  Is this a big problem?  A small one?

5. Right now random numbers are generated with srand/rand.  Should this
   be changeable at run time?  What about at compile time?

(Order all of your suggested improvements, most important first.)

Now about beta testing this stuff:  

The three tables types and three function calls will be ready to beta 
test in two weeks or less.  If you want to be a beta tester, please 
email me.  Besides email address and phone number, please include the 
type of program you will use these routines for. (ie. random monster 
encounter table for AD&D, or Planet generation for Traveller, or 
whatever)  If you use these routines for beta test, I\'ll expect a copy 
of the program you create, so I can start a regression test suite.  
(This has the nice side effect of you knowing that future releases will 
always support your programs, since they will be used for testing.)  I 
hope to have 5 or 10 beta testers.

For non beta testers who want this stuff:

Just hang out.  In a month or two I\'ll post how to get copies of version 
1.0 to the same newsgroups that I posted this email.

Actually, I\'m glad to see people volunteering in the event that I cannot
continue as moderator. Since everyone is mentioning scripts for doing
things, I have a copy of the "digestify" program used by various
newsgroups (sun-spots, uunet groups, etc) to automatically create digests
from articles saved in a mailbox. Since I\'m not (read can\'t) use the alias
mail feature at our site to automatically reflect mail, it\'s the only
automation I really need.

BTW, I still have no further info on to what connectivity I\'ll have
come Jan 1, but I\'ll keep you all posted.

Subject: DESIGN_SPEC

Well, I guess I\'ll fire an opening salvo.  Here\'s a proposal for
"build one", version 0.0

THIS IS REALLY LONG!!!!! ("Danger, Will Robinson...")

I am primarily going to talk about the interface, and user
considerations (that\'s my job, and I don\'t what I\'ll do to
the real designers with this..)  As much as possible, I have
tried to interpret the results of Dan\'s questionnaire and use
them here.

- ----General Considerations----

1.  Build one produces subsector maps, solar system maps, or
    sector maps, in Megatraveller format.

    Build two is another program that adds more mapping capability.

    Build three etc. add more functionality, compatability and data
    base usage of the star system files generated.
 
 
2.  The primary output is postscript; letter-sized paper.
 
3.  Secondary output is an ASCII file that can be used for data
    manipulation (data-base type search/sort, etc.) as well as for
    mapping.
 
4.  The computer terminal is used to control the program, not as
    an output device (except for preview).
 
5.  Program control (terminal stuff again) should be to VT-type
    terminals ("stdio" ?).  This gives the greatest compatability,
    and allows dial-in users.
 
- ----Output Map Considerations----

Subsector Maps----
 
The "standard" sized (see MT ref\'smanual, page 20) hex map
of a subsector (8 X 10 hexes) has the following characteristics:
 
    It is half a page.
        We will use a whole (8.5 X 11- inch) page (just to
        start an argument).
 
        Because we will generate more detailed world information, and
        because we will use the computer to search and sort through
        this more detailed data for us, we don\'t need to have a summary
        of the sector\'s worlds right next to the map.
 
        If we print the map "landscape" (sideways on the page -
        "Portrait" is printing on a page with the narrow side of the
        paper at the top), then we have half a page for notes and
        information that is more textual than visual.  Conversely, I
        have used full-page maps, with larger hexes and prefer them
        even though it means the world information is elsewhere.  (Of
        course, all of the more useful, more detailed world information
        is elsewhere anyway.)  Probably we should use of the page for
        map; we\'ll need room for a key and some of the more imiportant
        notes.
 
    It has numbered hexes; I\'m not sure we need to to this.
 
    Hexes are shown.  We should show hexes.
 
    It has the name of each world at the bottom of that world\'s hex.
    We should do this also.
 
        We can play with type sizes and faces (this is PostScript)
        till we find one suitable.  When you photocopy small letters,
        a medium sans-serif face, like Helvetica, copies the best.
 
    It has the starport type identified.  We should, too.

        This is a single bold-face letter.  I suspect some worlds may
        have more than one starport.  Do we put simply the best one up?
        Do we somehow indicate > 1 class A starports?

    Types of military establishments are shown.  We should show these
    too.
 
        This is done by hollow or filled icons, a star for a navy base
        (I suspect we could use a hollow star for a local navy base, a
        filled one for "Imperial" navy (whatever that is now.), a
        triangle for scout bases and stations, and a square for naval
        depots.  I believe judicial selection of a typeface will give
        us these as characters, so we don\'t have to "draw" them on the
        map.

    Type of primary world is indicated.  We should show stars, instead.
        (another argument?)

        Hollow or filled circles, or other appropriate images, are used
        for the world, to indicate it\'s type.  I think, from our
        discussions and from the responses, we\'d rather see some indi-
        cation of the star in that location, and whether it is single
        or multiple.  If you\'re like me, you color in these circles by
        hand to indicate the color of the star; it makes a very pretty
        map.


In general, for subsector maps, we should do pretty much what has gone
before, only use up a whole page for the map.  The actual file structure
we choose to do this, you experienced programmers can decide; just try
to pick one that we use later for other things (like data base queries).

Sector Maps----

For Sector maps, the official method is to have subsectors named
by a single letter.  The naming is alphabetic (A,B,C,...P) and in
the same order as the way we normally read.  I don\'t know which way
is "up" though; I THINK it\'s spinward.
 
Sector maps should have less detail.  They should show only the
following information:
 
        Class A starports
        A-to-A trade lanes
        MAJOR X-boat routes
        Major military bases
        Subsector Capitols
        significant political boundaries
 
Sector maps should also be on a full sheet of 8.5 X 11 inch paper, but
should not have the hexes drawn on it (it would get cluttered).
 
 
Solar System Maps----

I think we should save the output side of this until later.  There
should be a lot of detail that we need to consider with respect to
later builds and functionality.  (i.e. I didn\'t do this yet)


Other Maps----

See above...

- ----Interface Considerations----

Most of the general thoughts about the interface, I listed in the
overall design thoughts.  We should try to steer clear of hardware
dependency on initial builds.  (I think we could maybe do this
modularly so that the machine-specific interfaces could be "hung
on" later - any thoughts?)  Thus we should:

        Limit output to ASCII, printable characters (and the space)
        Use line oriented graphics (e.g. 24 lines, 80 columns)
        Use only one color (well, one bit plane)

With this in mind, I propose we lay out the screen something like the
following example: (I hope you\'ve got 80 columns)

- ----i think I counted about right----
 
 
I envision one line of the screen indicating what command is being
used, and a second that tells the user exactly what to do next
(i.e. "Create Base - Select and World and then make a menu selection.")
 
The map area should be continuously updated while the user is
interacting with the program.  When in mapping mode, the user can
select worlds from it (can we do this?), and when n DB mode, it can
highlight the world being edited.
 
The user of the program will need to be able to issue the
following commands:  (feel free to add some if you see the need)

Project Commands:
        Create DB file (=city, world, solar system, subsector, sector)
        Create map file (from DB file or random)
        Delete file
        Rename file
        Edit map file
        Edit DB file
        Save file
        Print file
 
Edit Map Commands:  (notice that these WILL alter the DB file, too)
        Select (move cursor (somehow) to desired spot on map display)
        Unselect (escape?)
        Make X-boat Route (select end points, or many points...)
        Make Trade Route (ibid)
        Make Political/Military Boundary
        Edit World (select world --> enter DB file)
                   (indicate that mode is changing)
        Add Base/Starport (submenu when star selected?)
                Navy
                Scout
                Depot
                Starport
        Delete Base
        Delete Starport
        Delete World
        Delete Trade Route
        Delete X-boat Route
        Delete Political/Military Boundary
        Enter Edit DB File Mode
        Exit to Main Menu level
        Save file
        
                 
Edit DB File Commands:
        Open file
        Save file
        Move up one level (I think the DB is logically heirarchical?)
        Move down one level
        Add a record
        Delete a record
        Modify a record
        Scan records
        Enter Map Edit mode
        Exit to Main menu level
        Save file
        Save record
 


As you can see, there are three basic modes of operation.  The program
comes up in the Main mode, which offers commands to directly operate
the program.

The second mode is primarily for "touching up" maps; for making sure
that routes and boundaries are correct, etc.

I picture the Edit DB file command set being intitally in a "scan
records" mode.  In this mode, a list of records available at that level
is displayed, and the user selects the one to play with.

- ----Command Descriptions----

Project Commands:

These are available when the program first comes up.  This is the
Main Menu level.

Set Path default        Establishes a pathname prefix to attach to
                        all file names.  For example, setting a
                        path default of "/usr/rdj/trav/" (we might
                        have to watch out on this when converting
                        to other systems) will cause the program
                        to look in this directory for all files and
                        to write files here, too.  equivalent to
                        the UNIX "cd" or the VMS "set def" command.

                        Parms:  pathname


Create DB file          I\'m not sure if this should be a DB "file" or
                        a DB "record".  The structrue seems logically
                        Heirarchical (city -> world -> solar system ->
                        subsector -> sector).
 
                        This is ALWAYS randomly generated.

                        Parms:  MT-rules || SpaceOpera || other
                                densly || sparsely populated
                                black holes on || off
                                nebulae on || off
                                TL limits (user-supplied)
                                other?

                        When we get this defined, we\'ll have a way to
                        transfer universes around.


Create map file         The map needs to use the information in a DB file
                        to get itself drawn.  This is the file that is
                        converted to the chosen output style by the
                        "print map" command and sent to the output device.

                        This file needs to still be in an editable form
                        so that mode two will work.

                        Parms:  DB-filename


Delete file             Removes a specified file from the user\'s disk.

                        Parms:  filename


Rename file             Changes the name or location of a specified
                        user file.  Origin and destination names are
                        required.  Rename should work with entire DB
                        files, but not with individual records.

                        Parms:  source_filename
                                dest_filename


Edit map file           Changes the program to mode 2, for editing
                        an already created map file.

                        Parms:  filename

Edit DB file            Changes the program to mode 3, for editing
                        an already created data base file.

                        Parms:  filename


Save file               Saves whichever file is open under the same
                        name (and path) in which it was opened.

                        Parms:  none


Print DB file           Copies a specified data base file to a specified
                        output device, in ascii format.  (use a filter
                        to TROFF it, if you want).

                        Parms:  filename
                                printer_id || terminal_id


Print map file          Copies a specified map file to a specified output
                        device, in a specified format.
 
                        Parms:  filename
                                printer_id || terminal_id
                                ascii || PostScript || other


Edit Map Commands:  {Mode 2}
(notice that these WILL NOT also alter the DB file)

Set Path default        Establishes a pathname prefix to attach to
                        all file names.  For example, setting a
                        path default of "/usr/rdj/trav/" (we might
                        have to watch out on this when converting
                        to other systems) will cause the program
                        to look in this directory for all files and
                        to write files here, too.  equivalent to
                        the UNIX "cd" or the VMS "set def" command.

                        Parms:  pathname

Open a map file         Opens a file from the default directory with
                        a (.map?) suffix.  Displays a list of available
                        files.  The user scrolls up and down this list
                        until the proper file is highlighted, then
                        presses <return>.

Set Path default        Establishes a pathname prefix to attach to
                        all file names.  For example, setting a
                        path default of "/usr/rdj/trav/" (we might
                        have to watch out on this when converting
                        to other systems) will cause the program
                        to look in this directory for all files and
                        to write files here, too.  equivalent to
                        the UNIX "cd" or the VMS "set def" command.

                        until the proper file is highlighted, then
                        presses <return>.

                        Output: Once the file is open, the top-level

In case you hadn\'t noticed by now, I\'m still out to lunch about

>Subject: Relative distances and sizes in the Universe.

    Several weeks ago I posted a request for slide sets comparing the
relative distances in the solar system and the other stars:  It would
seem that slide sets of this scale system are rather hard to come by.
I sent out a request to several other computer networks, along with
calling a number of planetariums, museum stores, and searched through
various scientific catalogues, all without significant result.

    I was able to use my resources and gather some information
from several friends on various types of relative celestial scales,
and have come up with some relevant information.

    The first selection depicts the solar system on a major league
baseball field from E. C. Slipher\'s "Planet" section of THE WORLD BOOK
ENCYCLOPEDIA P, VOLUME 15, Field Enterprises Educational Corporation,
Chicago, Illinois, 1964.  If the Sun were the size of a United States
half-dollar (fifty cents) on home plate, the planet Mercury would be
120 centimeters (four feet) away, Venus would be 225 centimeters
(7.5 feet) away, Earth would be 315 centimeters (10.5 feet) distant,
Mars would be 480 centimeters (sixteen feet) away, Jupiter would be
1,650 centimeters (55 feet) from the Sun (at the pitcher\'s mound),
Saturn would be 3,030 centimeters (101 feet) away (near second base,
and the last planet in the infield), Uranus would be 6,075 centimeters
(202.5 feet) away, Neptune would be 9,540 centimeters (318 feet) away,
and Pluto would be 12,615 centimeters (420.5 feet) distant from the
Sun, deep in the outfield.
 
    To compare planetary diameters, if the Sun were the size of an
average beachball, then Jupiter would be a golf ball, Saturn a Ping-
Pong ball, Uranus and Neptune marbles, Mercury and Pluto pinheads,
and Venus, Earth, and Mars would be about half the size of tackheads.

    The next comparison scale comes from the "Life on Other Worlds"
section of Carl Sagan\'s PLANETS, LIFE Science Library, 1966.  This
one depicts the solar system on a map of Europe and Africa, with the
average distance between the Sun and Earth, 150 million kilometers
(93 million miles) - also known as one Astronomical Unit (A.U.) -
now equaling 240 kilometers (150 miles).  If the Sun were situated
in Norway, Saturn would orbit just south of Italy, and Pluto would
be 10,400 kilometers (6,500 miles) away along the Cape of Good Hope
in South Africa.
 
    The next source on various celestial scales comes from THE
STARFLIGHT HANDBOOK: A PIONEER\'S GUIDE TO INTERSTELLAR TRAVEL, by
Eugene F. Mallove and Gregory L. Matloff (John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New
York, 1989, ISBN 0-471-61912-4, hardcover), which gives the following
description on page 5:  If the Sun were the size of a one-centimeter
(0.4-inch) marble, then Earth would be 0.1 millimeters (0.004 inches)
in diameter and one meter (39.37 inches) from the Sun.  The planet
Pluto would orbit 42 meters (139 feet) from the Sun, and Proxima
Centauri - the Sun\'s nearest stellar neighbor - would be 292
kilometers (175 miles) away.
 
    The next two books listed are both authored by Neil McAleer.
The first is THE COSMIC MIND-BOGGLING BOOK (Warner Books, Inc.,
New York, 1982, ISBN 0-446-37932-8, paperback).  On the front cover
of the book, the following comparison is made (one of my favorites,
from an aesthetic point of view):  If the solar system out to the
orbit of Pluto could fit in a coffee cup, the Milky Way Galaxy
would be the size of the North American continent.
 
    On page xiii - If you had a specially-designed automobile
which could handle the rigors of spaceflight, it would take you
201 billion years to "drive" from the Sun to the center of the
Milky Way Galaxy at 161 kilometers per hour (100 miles per hour).
Also, if the solar system were 2.54 centimeters (one inch) across,
the Milky Way Galaxy would be 161,000 kilometers (100,000 miles) wide.
 
    On pages 3-4 - If the Sun were the size of a sixty-centimeter
(two-foot) beachball, Earth would be the size of a pea and 6,450
centimeters (215 feet) away.  The planet Jupiter would be a large
orange 31,680 centimeters (1,056 feet) distant from the Sun.

    On pages 12-13 - If the Sun were a 14-centimeter (5-inch) orange,
Earth would be a sesame seed fifteen meters (49 feet) away.  Pluto
would be the size of a grain of millet six hundred meters (3,400
feet) away, and the star Alpha Centauri would be four thousand
kilometers (2,500 miles) from the Sun.
 
    On page 83 - If you could fly a specially modified Boeing 747
jetliner through space at 965 kilometers per hour (six hundred miles
per hour), it would take you 1,903 years to fly from the orbit of
the planet Uranus out to the orbit of Neptune.
 
    On page 128 - If the Sun were a basketball in New York City,
then Alpha Centauri would be another basketball eight thousand
kilometers (five thousand miles) away in Honolulu, Hawaii.
 
    On page 129 - If you traveled at the speed which the APOLLO
spacecraft used in an average six-day round-trip journey to Earth\'s
Moon (approximately 40,000 kilometers per hour/25,000 miles per hour),
it would take you 850,000 years to reach Alpha Centauri.  By contrast,
the faster PIONEER 10 and 11 and VOYAGER 1 and 2 Jovian probes will
reach that distance (4.3 light years) in only eighty thousand years.
 
    On page 161 - If you used a starship traveling at one-tenth the
speed of light (300,000 kilometers per second/186,000 miles per second)
to reach the farthest star in the Milky Way Galaxy, the ship would
take 800,000 years to reach it from the Sun.  If one Astronomical
Unit (A.U.) - the distance between the Sun and Earth, which is
roughly 150 million kilometers/93 million miles - were reduced to
2.54 centimeters (one inch), then that farthest star would be
127,000 kilometers (79,000 miles) away.
 
    The next selection is from the other Neil McAleer book, THE
MIND-BOGGLING UNIVERSE (Doubleday & Co. Inc., Garden City, New
York, 1987, ISBN 0-385-23039-7, paperback):
 
    On pages 10-11 - If the solar system out to Pluto were 2.54
centimeters (one inch) in diameter, then the center of the Milky
Way Galaxy would be 609 kilometers (379 miles) away.  Also, to
walk one A.U. at five kilometers per hour (three miles per hour)
would take 3,500 years.  To drive one light year at 88 kilometers
per hour (55 miles per hour) would take 12.2 million years.

    On page 15 - The Milky Way Galaxy\'s longest spiral arm of gas,
dust, and stars is 125,000 light years long.  It would take an
automobile driving at 88 kilometers per hour (55 miles per hour)
1.5 trillion years to cover that distance.
 
    On page 35 - An automobile driving at 88 kph (55 mph) would
take 52 million years to reach Proxima Centauri from the Sun.
 
    The next selection comes from THE UNIVERSE...AND BEYOND by
Terence Dickinson (Camden House Publishing, Ltd., Camden East,
Ontario, Canada, 1986, ISBN 0-920656-48-X, paperback):
 
    On pages 16-19 - If the actual distance between the Milky Way
Galaxy and the Andromeda Galaxy (two million light years) were shrunk
to a typical book-reading distance, then the most remote galaxies
known would be 1.6 kilometers (one mile) away.
 
    If the Sun were shrunk to the size of a 2.54-centimeter (one
inch) Ping-Pong ball, Earth would become a dust speck 240 centimeters
(eight feet) away, with the Moon being an even smaller speck just
6.25 millimeters (0.25-inch) from Earth.  Jupiter would be a pea
1,200 centimeters (forty feet) from the Sun, and Pluto is a dust
speck nine thousand centimeters (three hundred feet) away.  The
Oort Cloud of comets surrounding our solar system would be the
size of atomic particles and reside several kilometers distant,
with the comets themselves averaging several meters apart from
each other.  The Alpha Centauri trinary star system would consist
of two walnuts (Alpha and Beta) and a pea (Proxima) 640 kilometers
(four hundred miles) from our solar system.

    If Earth\'s solar orbit were reduced to the size of a United
States dime, the average distance between stars is now a little
over one kilometer (1.6 miles).  The Milky Way Galaxy would be
the actual size of Earth.  The distance to the Andromeda Galaxy
would be over half the actual distance between Earth and the Moon.
 
    If you could hold the Milky Way Galaxy in your hand, the stars
in it would be sub-atomic in size, and the Andromeda Galaxy would
be 210 centimeters (seven feet) away.
 
    My final textbook selection comes from CYCLES OF FIRE, by
William K. Hartmann and Ron Miller (Workman Publishing, New York,
1987, ISBN 0-89480-502-9, paperback):
 
    On pages 14-15 - If Earth were the diameter of a microparticle
of soot, then the Sun would be one hundred times larger, the size
of a mote of dust, or one hundredth of a millimeter across.  The
solar system would be the size of a saucer, and the Oort Cloud of
comets would exist several house lots away.  Alpha Centauri would
be another dust mote one to two city blocks from the Sun, and the
Milky Way Galaxy would be the size of North America.  Some of the
other nearby galaxies would be the varying sizes and distances of
Earth\'s continents.  The known limits of the Universe would stretch
halfway across the solar system.
 
    My friend and co-worker Drew LePage came up with some various
calculations on the celestial distance scale:
 
    If the orbit of Pluto were the size of a U.S. dime, this would be
the size of various distances in the Universe:
 
    Earth\'s orbit would have a diameter of about 0.5 millimeter (about
half the thickness of a dime).
 
    One light year would be about 15.2 meters (49.9 feet).

    One parsec (3.26 light years) would be about 49.7 meters (163 feet).
 
    The closest star would be 65.4 meters (214 feet) away.
 
    The closest one hundred known stars would be inside a sphere about
    640 meters (2,100 feet) across.
 
    The Sun would be 456 kilometers (283 miles) from the center of the
    Milky Way Galaxy.
 
    The Milky Way Galaxy would be 1,520 kilometers (945 miles) across.
 
    To put intergalatic distances into perspective, if the Milky Way
    Galaxy were the size of a dime:
 
    The orbit of Pluto would be about the size of a hydrogen atom.
 
    The Andromeda Galaxy would be 41.8 centimeters (16.5 inches) away.
 
    One megaparsec would equal 61.9 centimeters (2.03 feet).
 
    The recently discovered "Wall" of Galaxies would be about 40 meters
    (125 feet) to 60 meters (190 feet) away, about 3 meters (10 feet)
    thick, and extend for at least 100 meters (300 feet).
 
    The most distant quasar known would be about 2.6 kilometers
    (1.7 miles) away.
 
    The size of the observable Universe would be about 5.7 kilometers
    (3.5 miles) across.
 
    If nothing else, these figures should give some idea as to just
     how incredibly vast the known Universe is.

I currently have a library of table handling and random number
generation routines out in beta test.  If you want to be a beta tester,
or just want to see the documentation, please email me.  I\'ve listed
some of the features below.  I can also send a more detailed design to
people who want to give me feed back on it.

random numbers
   Takes strings representing dice rolls ("2d10", "1d8+1", etc.) and
   returns the number.  Also can generate random cards from a deck.
   Has logging/playback facility.  Untested facility to return floating
   point numbers between 0 and 1.
 
table routines
   Can read in, use, and print out tables.  Currently supports two
   types of tables, but is designed to be extendable to to other types.
   Tables are stored in a human readable format (and can be created with
   any text editor).

Subject: Re: Traveller Computer Programs

I doubt if anyone at GDW even knows what shareware is much less
understands the concept.  There are no computer jocks (at least that I
know of) with the company.  Almost all their software comes out of house.
Oh they write a few small programs for their PCs, but that is the extent
of it.  The office PCs are used for standard business programming (mainly
text processing). A few of them may even have a PC at home.  GDW as an
business is not currently on any computer network (although I am told
that one of the staff is privately).

If approached correctly you should have no problem, but shareware is not
a concept that is easy for non computer programming types to understand.
You have to stress that this is a simple playing aid that anyone could
write for themselves and all you are doing is saving them the trouble.
You should minimize the profit side of it, but not hide the fact that you
are asking money.  They have been pretty liberal in the past about giving
permission to zerox out of print games, etc..

At any rate, I\'ll be seeing Frank and Loren next week and if a get a
chance to talk to him and I remember (note we will be quite busy with
other things so this is very doubtful) I\'ll try to bring up the subject.

Bill,
I have subscribed to the Trav mailing list for a while and have enjoyed
the System Generation Digest.  I would like you to add me to the
discussion group.  This is a broadcast mailing list, right?  That is,
there is some email address, and if I mail something there it goes to
everybody on the list.  Boy, will I be embarrassed if THIS is the
broadcast address.

I was one of the people who started the Universal Simulation Mailing
List; I recently posted to rec.games.programmer the source to a
continental drift simulator I wrote.  It generates planet maps that
look very realistic.  Although I have been reading planetary science
journals for six years or so, it\'s just a hobby.

Although I missed the Survey deadline, let me give you a few comments.
I strongly believe ASCII is the right format, so that I can use a text
editor to fix up or create input to one of the programs in the toolset.
I am not interested in MegaTraveller format specifically; I think the
programs should generate _more_ information than MT needs.  Perhaps
there could be an output filter which would take output from the
toolset and print it out on a MT-standard form, if there is such a
beast.

Hope to hear from you soon.

Slight problem. To a first approximation, Isp=Ve/g
(that is, the specific impulse equals the exhuast velocity divided by
the acceleration due to gravity at the Earth\'s surface)

This means that the *maximum* Isp is a bit over 3e7 seconds. And it
would be achieved by having an exhaust velocity of C!

Also your final velocity is determined by your exhaust velocity and
mass-ratio. I think it is Vf= ln(Mr)*Ve.

Ok, with an Isp of 1e6, Ve = 1e7. so for 2% of c as a final velocity
you need a mass-ratio of 1.8....

With Isp=6e5, you need Mr=2.7. not too shabby...

Metlay isn\'t kidding when he says that a reaction type fusion drive
will make things "interesting".

A nice way to remove small annoyance is to do a "burn-off". Just come
in for a "touch and go *powered* landing. Tail first.

A classic example of doing this with a scout is given in Andre
Norton\'s "Soiux Spaceman".

BTW, anybody ever tried mixing Norton\'s stories with Traveller?
I suspect they\'d fit rather well. And they\'d be a great source of
plots for lazy refs. (especially since so many of them have the same
*starting* plot elements. Makes it hard for a player to figure out

The major difference would be that it couldn\'t be jump4! The TL-Jump progression
is something like this (typing from memory, but 90% certain :-):
 
 Jump1  Jump2  Jump3  Jump4  Jump5  Jump6
  TL9    TL11   TL12   Tl13   Tl14   TL15

So the Xboats would have to be TL13 in order to have Jump4. But I don\'t think
that would make them significantly "larger" internally than a TL15 xboat.
The Jumpdrive is not TL dependent.
The Powerplant is heavily dependent by TL.. but it will be very small on an
Xboat.
A quick estimate gives that a Jump4, 1Gee Xboat would have to spend around
45 percent of its tonnage to Drives, and enviro and fuel and stuff.
That would leave 740 kl. Minus 2 staterooms and a 20 ton (big as a launch)
databank and some controls, this would leave about 350 kl as excess space.
This is just enough space for fuel to fuel an additional Jump-4!
So even a TL13 Xboat should be able to make 2 Jump-4...
(Hmm, Jump4+4, is that Rift capability?)

Sure you can, It is mentioned in the Solomani Alien Module that they often
use fixed mounts. I would think that a fixed mount would take the same 
power, but require less room (maybe as low as 1/3), meigh appropriately less
and perhaps be 25% cheaper.
The limits as detailed in the module was that any craft may only have as many
hardpoints occupied by fixed mounts as it has computernumber.
They also gave each weapon a -2 to hit. (Mayday system)
Looking at the way spinal mounts is treated in MegaT a fixed mount would
have to be pointed at the target in order to be fired. 
(And they would be practically useless for defensive fire)

An other method is to intstall a big bomb-bay (just cargo with a hatch in the 
floor). This would have room for about one 1000kg bomb per 0.75 kl or something.
Just fly over the target and open the hatch...
Even a little ship could take a B52 sized cargo.
For really effective ground-attack, put laserguidance kits on the bombs...

(I\'m going to try to always post on Tuesdays so we all have at least
a little time to do the `right thing\' before the next turn.)

- ----
After the usual hassles just arriving at a new place of work, you
are given the customary mild stimulant of choice.  Since almost all
of you are humanoid (at least so far), this will probably be some
disguised form of caffiene.

You have not reported to Turnskaad Enterprises, or any building
belonging to them.  Instead you are assembled in a conference room
at the Inn of the TAS.  You are never without escort, but are
generally free to wander around.  (Kind of like a convention :)

You are on yet another typical rock in space type world (the 
actual location is kind of immaterial to the game).
TL here is 13.  You are near, but not in, a city of about 600,000
humanoids.  The city is by a small bay formed by mountains and the
delta of a fair-sized river.

As you assemble, you notice around you little of the typical
conference-room paraphenalia.  Instead, only the omnipresent
security teams, and two small groups (1 robot, 2 beings) constantly
sweeping for information-intrusive devices.

A small, stocky, white-haired gentleman steps on the podium and
tests the acoustics.  Moving behind the lectern (c\'mon there\'s gotta
be a lectern) he begins.

	Greetings travellers!  Thank you for volunteering for what will
	perhaps the most exciting exploratory mission of our lifetimes.
	The numbers and quality of applications we have received
	indicate the importance of our undertaking.

	Today, the first of you begin your training.  I\'d also like to
	briefly introduce those who have been accepted and indicate
	their team assignments.

	Let me begin with your mission commander: Admiral Nanadl Nggemen
	Gr.  Count Gr has recently retired from a distinguished carreer
	in the Darrian Navy.  You can see from his uniform that his
	experience has been, well, .. practical.  I believe there is no
	finer individual than Count Gr to lead this mission.  Count, you
	will be briefed in detail on the mission and its objectives.

The Count is a slim, rugged, Navy man.  He appears to about 40
standard years old.  He wears a chest full of medals and ribbons.
Anyone with experience notices right away that he only keeps *really*
good ribbons on his uniform - the rest are probably buried
somewhere.  Even the novices will notice the SEH ribbon.
He definitely has more an air of confidence and competence than of
bravado or impressiveness.  Vets might recognize the partly-empty
eyes that have seen too much violence, too many young people killed.

	Next we have the current members of the transport team:  Etienne
	De Mer, Morgan Gray, Jaron Voga, and Eneri De Aith.  We have not
	yet determined the command representative from this team, nor
	the team leader.  You gentlebeings will be briefed on your
	expected duties, and will be trained accordingly.

These four have the look of a shared religion.  That religion being
flight.  It\'s obvious in their demeanor that they see things at the
controls of a ship that other creatures can\'t, or don\'t conceive
of.  Etienne wears a space-navy uniform.  Not nearly the ribbons nor
the distinguished air of the Count, but still quite confident and
capable.  The other three have the `look and feel\' of Scouts.  There
is no doubt from their comraderie, they\'re a club.

	In engineering, we currently have only one team member: Ralf.
	Although scout trained, Ralf has demonstrated technical and
	repair abilities that more than qualify him for this mission.
	Ralf will be briefed on his duties (if the ref can ever
	successfully send mail to his player...).

Ralf seems in his 30\'s.  He is not in uniform.  He seems quiet, and
perhaps a little nervous to be the center-of-attention, if for only
a little while.

	In security we currenly have three top-notch crew mwmbers, and
	two outstanding applicants.  The three who are here are: Andon
	Shrike, Anton Devious, and Sergeant-Major Hammer.  We have an
	offer out to a Marine major and a detective. (so their player\'s
	will know in case the mail fails again.)

These three look like they\'ll never get along.  One is a Marine
officer, one a COAC pilot, and one regular army.  Andon Shrike, the
pilot, mid 30\'s, seems distant and quiet.  Anton Devious, the
Marine, would remind many of the legendary Oliver North.  He is
friendly and outgoing.  Hammer, the merc, seems like a jaguar
patiently waiting for prey.  

	In medical and bioscience we have only one crewmember so far:
	Dr. Christian Van Der Merwe.  The good doctor is quite capable
	of providing insight into any new biotypes we might encounter,
	as well as seeing to our own medical needs.  I only hope we
	don\'t burn him out.

There is really nothing that distinguishes this doctor from
thousands of others you\'ve seen.  Just console yourselves knowing
that there\'s something inside that makes him special.  (NO I\'m *NOT*
saying he\'s psi!  Only that he might take a little while to get to
know.)

	In physical science we have Karl Morser and Johann Abuko.
	Doctor Morser is well-versed in many sciences.  We have also
	assigned him to the generalism team.  Mr. Abuko has great
	experience in physical systems and computer modelling.

Dr. Morser is kind of small.  He smiles and jokes, and you\'re left
kind of wondering what he found funny.  Johan Abuko is missing an
eye.  He\'s kind of stocky and very quiet.

	In social sciences we have only one team member so far: Dr
	Werner.  Dr. Werner has contact experience and years of field
	research.

Dr. Werner is a complete opposite to Abuko.  He obvioulsy likes
where he is, and is mildly enjoying not only the newness here but
just having people around.  He is tall and slender, late 30-ish.

	Finally, on our generalist team we have three so far.  Doctor
	Morser you\'ve met.  Say hello to Rigo Edmonsen and Andreas
	Spear.  Captain Edmonsen has worked in urban environments the
	last few years and can help out in engineering from
	time-to-time.  Mr Spear has a broad general background and a
	variety of experience from around the galaxy.

Spear is young, muscular, and mildly flashy.  Edmonsen is mature,
conservative, and sober.

	Now please take a few minutes to get acquainted.  If you\'d like
	to request a different assignment and/or a second assignment, do
	so now.  Next week we wil introduce new members, assignment
	changes, and make necessary equipment purchases.

	The general preliminary mission briefing will be after lunch.
	Re-assemble here are 13:30 local time.

And then he turns you lose.

{Referee shell `on\'}
Use this week to get to know each other as best you can.  If you
choose to talk openly, just use the list.  If you want to talk
privately to someone, mail to me and I\'ll forward it.  This might
take a little longer, but should add spice to the game.

General Mission Briefing is in turn 0.1

This mail thing is driving me nuts, but I think we can work around
it.  If you want to play (and aren\'t already) get your character to
me this week if possible, next at lastest (unless it\'s unavoidable -
if I have to I can work you in later as a bad guy or soemthing).  If
you need me to gen a character for you, let me know *immediately*.

Turn 0.1:  Preliminary Mission Briefing

After lunch, the white-haired gentleman again mounts the platfom,
but eschews the lectern.  The lights dim and he speaks.


We have recently received information from one of our private scouts
that a ringworld exists in a nebula not far from here.  Our scout
was able to make only one pass, and that off the ecliptic, so we
don\'t know much about the overall picture. We have named this find
`R-alpha\', after the code sequence used ot designate the find.

(A holo of a slim, shiny band reflecting the light of a yellow-green
star forms near the speaker.  This is a moving holo, obviously from
the cameras of a passing ship, and time compressed.  The band slowly
resolves into what must be a ring, although the nearer side is
washed out by the light of the star.  The ring is almost vertical in
the holo.)

The one pass indicated excess energy generation at several
locations, habitable oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere, and methane.
Methane does not occur except as a by-product of animal life, or
geological metamorphasis, so we strongly suspect widespread life.

(The holo shows 8 or 9 distinct "warm spots" on the ring as the star
characteristically dims through an IR-viewing filter.  The ring
rapidly expands, and then the time-compression slows as the camera
pans to follow the inner surface of the ring.  Geographic features
such as low hills and small seas are visible.  So are clouds.)

Whoever built this didn\'t create it for just a game preserve.  We need
to explore it as much as possible in the next few months.  Naturally
there is potential for huge economic and miltary benefit if you can
uncover information, artifacts, and so forth.  We have posted a bond
of 10,000 ICr for the first working artifact found.

(The holo fades out. The lights come back up.)

Also, discoveries like this are hard to keep secret.  Time is
critical.  We estimate you have at most six months to do all your
investigative work before competitors force you off the world.  If
you can get back in time, we can make at least a salvage or
colonization claim on R-alpha before someone else can move in.

Because of the nature of your teams, and of this world, you will be
spending extended periods well away from other teams and from your
ship.  You need to be prepared.  We are providing inital training,
and making certain equipment available to you at a reduced cost.
Your checks will be held here until your return.  (Isn\'t that just
like a big outfit, to collect the interest on your labor...)

The command team will assign specific missions, deadlines, and
goals for each of the other teams.  Generally, the command team\'s
assignments are orders to be followed, but specific implementation
details will be the responsibility of each team.

The transport team\'s job is to get you there, back, and where you
have to go while you are there.  Submersibles, air rafts, and ATVs
will be available once you\'re there.  Try to choose equipment and
tools that are transportable, so these guys can do their job.

The engineering team is along to keep things working, and to 
manufacture what you will need as the need arises.  If you know any
good drive specialists and/or ships\' engineers, steer \'em our way.

We can all see the need for a security team.  (actually that\' up to
your individual characters whether they can...)  We don\'t exactly
know what we\'re getting into down there.  Whoever build R-alpha
might have defensive surprises lined up and waiting for us.  On the
other hand, security might just be moving crates for a fully
cooperative crew, or it might mean repelling alien boarders.  Stay
frosty!  Additionally, we want security to have a look at anything
that might be a native weapon.  Could be some interesting stuff to
learn there.

The medical/bioscience team\'s job is manifold.  They need to keep
everyone healthy.  They need to investigate what, if any, medical
disciplines were used by the creators of R-alpha and to make use of
them if necessary to combat alien infection.  Additionally, they
need to classify and catalog as many indigenous life forms as
possible, and together with the social science team, determine if
contact is appropriate.

Physical science\'s job is to make a stab at the technology of the
builders of R-alpha, if you can find enough remains to make it worth
their while.  We especially want to know the obvious things, like
did they know something about drives we can learn?  What kinds of
materials did they use to build this world?  What kinds of machines
did they use to build it?  etc.  There\'s bound to be some strange
stuff on our new world, look to these guys for the answers.

The social science team is there to find out about how the creators
lived, how whoever is there now is living, and make contact if that
seems appropriate.  If we can remain on peaceful terms with the
natives, we\'d certainly prefer it.

Finally, we have generalists on the crew to help out where needed
and to, more importantly, try to provide a `gestalt\' of R-alpha as
it is and as it was; to provide some meaningful framework for what
was, what is, and why.  

Again folks, think on what you will need to perform your mission.
You might have to live off the land, you might need to move quickly,
and you might need to fight hard just to survive.  Next week we will
move out to the asteroids, where the Alcyon is parked, and where we
have a supply depot to help you make final personal and mission
purchases.

As a parting word, we still need scientists and engineers
desparately.  Of course we still examine resumes for all positions,
but do recommend us to your friends, so you won\'t be shorthanded
when it\'s time to do the work.

Are there any questions?

Go ahead and ask public questions publicly.

This ship requires that you use the "no fuel used by the manueverdrive

races to see who can get from Kashuggus to Capitol fastest :-)

The EMMasking is intended to make it usable (awmigod, it *is* usable!:-) for
clandestine operations, like if the IISS want to take sensorreadings on the
latest additions to Chronors planetary defence installations etc.

     I just took at look at my original copy of Book 2 (eleventh printing)
and I noticed something...  Tech levels aren\'t mentioned at all in reference
to drives.  Not at all.  The only mention of tech level I saw in Book 2 was
for *drugs* (what *they\'re* doing in Book 2:  Starships, I don\'t know).

 >So the Xboats would have to be TL13 in order to have Jump4. But I don\'t think

     I don\'t know about that...  How about the *size* of the drive?  The
higher the tech level, the smaller the individual components are, and the
more room you have for goodies.  At least, that\'s how it was in High
Guard.  I don\'t have that much experience with MegaTraveller\'s craft
design system (yet).  A Jump 1 drive took less of a percentage of the total
volume of the ship at TL15 than at TL9, as I recall.

     Didn\'t the original Xboat design *not* have a power plant?

     Yup.  At least one Rift-crossing route can be done by Jump 5 ships.  If
a ship can cross eight parsecs on one load of fuel (even if it takes two
weeks), then it should be able to cross the Rift without too much trouble.

Why I can hear you, but you can\'t hear me...


Maybe you folks can help  (this is technical TL8 computer junk...)

At Oregon Software (aka `oresoft\'), we are connected to uunet.
For some reason, our mailer routes TO uunet THROUGH:
	reed!ogccse!rutgers!uunet...

Aside from the inefficiency, this would not be a problem, except
that Oregon Graduate Center (OGC) changed their name to OGI, and
also the mailer to ogicse.  Consequently, almost everything out
of oresoft bounces - it doesn\'t know ogccse.

How do `we\' (in a generic sense - we have no system manager)
fix this?  I suspect there is a file in /usr/spool/uucp/...
somehwere that\'ll do the trick, but I\'m a writer not a software
type, so help is needed.  (also our software types are not unix
folks [yet], but VMS compiler folks for the most part [ugh].)
- ----  any help will be most beneficial to the E-pbm


About the other acoount: agora.  agora is a public-access xenix
system (286 xenix I think).  Intel has been kind enough to allow
mail hookups through there, but sometimes agora stuff gets dumped to
the ether because of high traffic loads from/through intel.

Consequently, I use agora for almost all my outgoing mail, but
sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn\'t.  It would sure be nice to
make oresoft behave.

So that\'s my plea for help.  Oh, I believe we\'re using smail if that
helps any.

Thanks
	Richard Johnson


(I know it doesn\'t really belong on this list, but you guys are the
ones putting up with the foolishness.)

Wow...what an intorduction, I am *really* impressed so far.

Richard mentioned that these "public" messages should be used to gather info
that everone would be interested in. However if I mention my character, then
the fact that richard doesn\'t want to give out the player\'s addresses becomes
irrelevant.

This gentleman introduced everone but himself. Who is he anyway?

Define artifact. The standard definition is:
ar.ti.fact \\\'<a:>rt-i-,fakt\\ n (1821)
...
    1a: a usu. hand-made object (as a tool or ornament) representing a 
    particular culture or stage of technological development
...
This means the first tool, hammer, sword, etc, is worth Cr10,000? or
do they mean the first TL 17+ thingy?

Some other general questions:

How big is the ship? What can we put inside? The intro mentioned subs.
I sure hope that there are some automated probes and robots for doing
some of the observations.
Was the system cleared for construction of the world, or are there other
planets or planetoids in the system. Specifically a gas giant for
refueling. However other planets could serve as an intial base.
How do we determine the command team representative from our group?
Do we just have an election, volunteers, or since it pays more, fight
it out?
"The TL here is 13", does this mean no TL 14+ equipment? Does equipment
purchased come out of our salaries, or is there a budget for the mission?
Are there any company represetatives coming? or are we on our own? Is there
a seperate crew for the mothership, or do some of us have to volunteer to 
stay behind with the ship?

Public Questions:

This one I won\'t ask loudly, I expect that everybody should know the answer
already: but since we players don\'t know: What date is is?

What is the estimated minimum technological level to build a ringworld?

How long could it last untended?

How large surface area does R-alpha have?

Do we get access to a full report from the scout who discovered it?

Was any kind of transmissions or signals from R-alpha detected?

Did it radiate neutrinos?

Any signs of large scale constructions (other than the ringworld, that is :-)
on its surface on the closeups?

What resolution does the closeups have?

How large is those "low hills and small seas" on the surface?

What are we waiting for?:-)

People,
	Could everyone posting a message regarding the play by mail
game be sure to put E-PBM somewhere in the Subject: line?  It would
make it much easier for me to archive all pbm mail in a separate
folder.  I usually archive all trav-list mail that I find interesting
enough to keep in one folder, but want to maintain a separate folder
for the pbm stuff.  I use vm for a mail reader, and take advantage of
it\'s automatic archiving capability, but I need some special way to
flag pbm mail so I can archive it before it sees that it\'s from the
trav list and puts it in that folder.

	Richard, did you get my character?  Something you might try
for getting mail out is to specify the path to uunet, i.e. to mail to
me, try sending to reed!ogicse!rutgers!hamblin.byu.edu!jlp (note, I
skipped uunet -- rutgers should be able to reach me directly).

Thanks for the replies, although I was left a little confused.  I\'m
assuming that there are ways to improve the Isp (actually, the EJV,
but it works out to the same thing) by NOT simply smashing deuterium 
and He3 together like mini-H bombs, but using your fusion power plant
to power a containment field (magnetic?  I guess so) that will heat
reaction mass, like normal hydrogen, to such horrific temperatures
that it spews out at velocities that give you much better fuel consumption
than the Daedelus-type starships.  The convention Isps of 6E05 to 1E06,
I have been told, are based on our bomb-versions of fusion...if we had
really efficient fusion power, we could heat and direct the reaction
mass much more efficiently.

For those who have been discussing this issue, let\'s put it this way,
my fusion engines, unless I\'m setting this up wrong, a 7:3 payload-fuel
ration (i.e., 30% of the ship is fuel) will let you reach about 2% c
and then decelerate down again, or let you reach 4% c and keep going
forever until you hit something.  What kind of Isp would be required
for this, and if we can use magnetic fields to contain plasma at
several hundred million degrees, it is unreasonable to assume that 
this kind of Isp could be achieved.  If it is, is it possible that
"fusion" engines actually sweeten the mix with a little (magnetically
stored) anti-hydrogen?  (Is this the galactic version of adding a 
nitrous tank to your car?)

Thanks in advance.  Take care all.

Mark

	First, a few things for the esteemed members of this mission.  In
answer to a previous post, a believe that a ringworld is at least tech 13,
possibly tech 25.  Going purely from science fiction, namely by Larry Niven,
a ringworld is huge, having an area of some millions or billions of Earths.
The ringworld featured by Niven lasted for several thousand years before
it was discovered.  Well, we shall see what we shall see, that is what
Richard will tell us we see...

   Now for Richard\'s part...

located in Worcester, Massachussets.  I seem to be getting through to
you, but not vice versa.  Your new mail path seemed to work, i.e. I 
received a message from you through normal e-mail, and not through this

I\'m afraid that I\'m going to have to put off the Fifth Frontier
War for a while. To make a long story short I\'m overworked.
That may change, and if it does I\'ll announce it here.

As for the Travller PBM, it is very interesting. I have two
questions:

1. Can I play a Droyne?
2. Can I get equipment from the World Builder\'s Handbook?

Also, the new issue of the Digest is out. Some neat stuff in it;
you might want to check it out.

	The program in the following shell archive will allow one to
	explore a universe of over 1,000,000 stars. The idea was for it
	to be used as a campaign setting and would be ideal for anyone
	running a PBeM game on more than one world. The program should
	generate the same universe for everyone allowing mutual exploration
	and discussion.

	This program is level-1 and only generates mainworlds. Later
	levels will generate entire systems, geological data and all the
	way down to regional and city maps. If characteers can turn to their
	library data and pull up info on almost anywhere in the galaxy then
	why not the players?

	I don\'t mean to tread on the system-generation sublist\'s toes but
	this is rather different. Instead of a suite of programs to
	generate systems to suit the flexibility of individual\'s campaigns
	I have accepted rigidity for scope. The code is built in such
	a way that a host of subsidiary programs can be generated based on the
	central routines (sector maps, trade routes, ...).

	I have the later levels planned and specified but time pressure
	will delay their release. Any volunteers are most welcome.

1.  About three hours ofter I sent in the last message, describing
in painful detail, how our mailer was broke - it mysteriously
started working correctly.  I say mysteriously because no one here
fixed it!   (Thanks, whoever hacked our system :)

2.  To Nicholas Sylvain:
	I have your address as sylvain$n@dayton.bitnet
	The problem is that niether mailer I have will accept a $ as
	a legal character.  They won\'t accept \\$ either.  So I can\'t
	mail to you.  I do have a very little on your character - please
	send more.

	If anyone out there knows how I can get around this - let me
	know!  PLEASE!   (He\'s been incredibly patient with this  whole
	fiasco.)

Richard
	Turn 0.2 coming up soon :)  Your questions (some of them) will
	be answered.

Just give me a fusion gun :-) and there be no tribbles atol (Sorry couldn\'t
resist)

The answer, at least from my view point is "That is why we are taking a contact
team!"  The ring world is very large.  Lets just assume a G2v star and a 93
million mile habit orbit.  Circumfrence = 2*PI*R.  There are probably several
sentient races that don\'t even know about the other.

Unless you are like me :-)  I am using a different post a turn address than
where I receive the mailing list.  Only he has my post from address.   So I
can send stuff from here as General Things, but I won\'t accept mail from other
players regarding the game at this account.  Actually it is rather painful
haveing the addresses different, but oh well....

I would assume artifact to have the Traveller Definition of:
    1a: a usu. hand-made object (as a tool or ornament) representing a
    particular culture or stage of technological development by the race
    know as the Ancients.

Yes, but in MegaT every craft require a powerplant to power the computer

It seems that the MegaT vehicle design system is incompatible with the 
Traveller Universe Background, at least when it comes to questions about 
Ships, Jumps and Rifts in various combinations.
This looks to me like a major bug.

Hi.  This is my first message, though I\'ve enjoyed reading for quite
awhile.

I was attempting to "detail" a few systems within the spinward marches,
looking at interesting (read hi-tch, low law, etc...) worlds in particular.
and I came up against the small problem of the large number of M5+ type V
stars in the marches.

These stars, you might notice - have no habitable zones!  they all end up
as -141 iceballs, even the rich ones, or the agrarian, or etc.

Is there a good distance (below orbit 0, presumably) to put these worlds.
Or Are al these worlds really iceballs? (I was perturbed to find that some
already published non-iceball worlds turn into iceballs under world-builder.)

any advice would be welcome.

paul

Question and Answer Session:
- ----
{Our lecturer has just concluded the preliminary briefing.}

Are there any questions?  Yes.


	Well you introduced us.  Who are you?

Oh.  I\'m sorry.  I\'m Adam Khervatchkov.  I\'m senior project engineer 
for Turnskaad Enterprises.  Since our headquarters are so far away, 
I\'m basically in charge of the operation here.


	What exactly do you mean by `artifact\'?

We\'re searching for unique and previously unknown items.  We\'re 
offering the reward for a truly natable scientific, military,
historical, or economic find.  It doesn\'t have to be a TL17
`thingy\' (of course that wouldn\'t hurt).  It does have to be
something that we as a multi-racial empire have never before
built, dreamed of, or considered.  Like a practical way to 
communicate with plants, or make a jump 7, or just be able
to have a viable artificial intelligence.


	How big is the ship? 

I presume you mean the Alcyon (notice I swiped at least one thing
from all thos ideas you folks posted :))  when you say `ship\'.
I\'d like to defer this question for a day or two. (because the ref
needs to go crunch some numbers...)


	What can we put inside? 

See previous answer.


	The intro mentioned subs.  I sure hope that there are some 
	automated probes and robots for doing some of the observations.

Yes there are.  You have both disposable and recoverable probes and
robots for this mission.


	Was the system cleared for construction of the world, 
	or are there other planets or planetoids in the system? 
	Specifically a gas giant for refueling. However other 
	planets could serve as an intial base.

We did not see any gas giants in the system.  We did see some asteroids
so we presume the systme was largely cleaned out.  However, there is
water on the surface, and there is trace hydrogen in the atmosphere 
of R-alpha.


	How do we determine the command team representative from 
	our group? Do we just have an election, volunteers, or since 
	it pays more, fight it out?

Well I certainly wouldn\'t want to fight very many of you for that 
privelege - doesn\'t pay that much.  I feel that this is a decision
you really do need to work out for each team.  Sometimes there is
an obvious (at least to me) choice.  Mostly, you\'re all just *good*.
Why don\'t you star off rotating the assignment for a few weeks at a
time?



	Some of the equipment I\'ve seen around here is kinda
	obsolete.  Got anything better at your warehouse?

Well, Turnskaad is interstellar and has managed to avaoid most of
the ravages of the current wars.  We might have some of the more
sophisticated gear, depending on what it is, of course.



	Does equipment purchased come out of our salaries, 
	or is there a budget for the mission?

That depends on the equipment purchased.  We don\'t expect you to
come up with the cost of sophisticated nav programs, for instance,
nor for anti-ship missiles.  Anything that is obviously mission-
required is covered.  We think we\'ve covered most of that - but of
course you\'ll want to verify it.  Items that are personal we expect
you to pay for.  Items that are expendable for the good of the
mission, each team has a budget for.  (Basically, ask for the
best.  If I think you\'re gettng out of hand, I\'ll charge you double :)


	Are there any company represetatives coming? 
	or are we on our own? 

This mission is your baby.  I will probably drop by to check up
your status, exchange mail, etc. though.


	Is there a seperate crew for the mothership, or do 
	some of us have to volunteer to stay behind with the ship?

With any luck, you can find a docking bay and make it work, and then
you can just park it.  Actually, that is one of the questions the
science team needs to look into: How did the creators of R-alpha
produce null-gravity for ships?  There\'s no evidence of `orbital\'
stations.


	A lot of us here have our own ships, and would much 
	rather drivethem there than use yours, no offense intended.

We were counting on it.  If you run into trouble, there\'s numerous
reasons for havng more than one ship.  If you don\'t, there\'s
numerous reasons for having more than one ship.  All of you with 
scout and merchant ships should bring them.  Extra cargo room, too.


	"Umm, just how big is the ringworld?  

Its stellar radius is roughly 1.5 X 10^8 kilometers.  It\'s roughly 
3000 kilometers wide.  It has `vertical\' sides roughly 100 kilometers
high, to hold in its air.  Actually, in a general sense, it is one
*huge* valley between two *tall* mountain ranges.


	So how large surface area does R-alpha have?

Roughly 10^12 km^2.  This is on the order of 10^4 times the surface
area of a planet like Terra.


	And how long will we have to explore it?  

Not long.  Only a few months at most.  We expect, knowing how 
communications and response work, that at least two of the major
belligerents for the throne will arrive in 4 to 6 months time.
Rather than `explore\' per se, we\'d prefer you concentrated on
getting everything you can from R-alpha.  Physically and scientifically.



	Also, if there is an undiscovered sapient race with some degree
	of technological development, what will be mission policy 
	regarding contact and establishment of relations with the locals?"

That\'s up to the on-scene commander.  Just remember that they\'re a lot
less likely to be welcomed into civilization when and if Lucan and Dulinor
start duking it out over \'er under? their heads.


	What is the estimated minimum technological level 
	to build a ringworld?

16 I believe.  Possibly 17.  It\'s certain that our present/previous
empire certainly isn\'t/wasn\'t too close.


	How long could it last untended?

Go find out how long this one been there.  I reckon the structure is
inherently unstable, it wouldn\'t take much, or very long, to destroy 
it if its inner workings shut down.  Maybe a better question is how
did R-alpha\'s creators build technology that could sustain itself in
their absence (if they are absent)?


	Do we get access to a full report from the scout 
	who discovered it?

This is basically the full report.  It was a one-way remote scout
probe.


	Was any kind of transmissions or signals from R-alpha detected?

Yes.  Various kinds at various ranges.  They were all low-level and hard
to differentiate from the stellar radiation until the probe was close enough
to get a good angular separation.  There seems to be all kinds of 
passing all over the backside of the ring.


	Did it radiate neutrinos?

(I want to defer this until I look up what neutrinos indicate besides
 nuclear fusion - RJ)


	Any sign of large scale constructions (other than the 
	ringworld, that is :-) on its surface on the closeups?

You mean, like those roads there?  The close-ups we have are rural.
Although at larger scale (not-so-close-up) it looks like there are
sea ports at least.  Probably cities.


	What resolution do the closeups have?

About 2.5 metres at 530 nm wavelength, about 3.5 metres at 1000 nm
and about 2 metres at 300 nm.  This is for the closest of the lot.
It gets worse further out.


	How large are those "low hills and small seas" on the surface?

The seas you saw look to be in the Red Sea to Mediterranean Sea range, to
use a terrestrial analogy.  The hills are no more that 1000 metres high.
Except, of course near the edge, where they virtually `touch the sky\'.

 
	What are we waiting for?:-)

The remainder of the mission crew (about half the players), and for 
the referee to finish geting his act together and straighten out the
chaotic mess he gave himself. :)


	This one I won\'t ask loudly, I expect that everybody 
	should know the answer already: but since we players 
	don\'t know: What date is it?

I\'m not sure.  I didn\'t specify because I wanted to let players
adjust it to their own particular campaign needs.






Let me now clean up a few more loose ends.
First, an apology.  It\'s doctor Abuko, not simply Mr. Abuko.

Second, I\'d like to introduce four new crewmwmbers who have just
been accepted:
	Dave Sokuku, who will probably be joining the social sciences
	team.

	Iadlvref, who will also be joining the social sciences team.

	Mac Witfield, a distinguished and practiced generalist.

	Nishu Neriika, who will joining the transport team.

(These folks are just as dinguished as the resto of your crew.  Dave
is a scout.  Looks to be in fine shape for someone who probably has
been doing desk work - lots of muscle tone, rather than mass.
Friendly.  Iadlvref is small and wiry.  When you first lay eyes on
him you just can\'t decide whether to really like him or permanently
distrust him.  He seems cordial, honest, and as beutiful and deadly
as a pit viper.  Mac is in civvy clothes.  His eyes wander
constantly, but far from aimlessly.  He is young, too.  Finally,
Nishu, another navy man (er critter).  Also decorated.  Clearly
looking for something more than flying a desk.)


more later...

     Arrgh!  I can\'t stand it anymore.  I was trying to be good, 
trying to keep quiet, but I just HAVE to say something about fusion 
and agility.  Behold two Gazoid comments:


AGILITY

     At first glance it would appear that Agility and Acceleration
are unrelated.  Yes indeedy do.  After all, one is the ability to 
rotate the ship, while the other is the ability to accelerate in a 
straight line.  Starships lack the tires, wheels, fins, wings, flippers, 
or any of the other things which force terrestrial, aquatic, atmospheric, 
or waddling vehicles to make trade-offs between agility and acceleration, 
so these qualities should be independant.  
     Or should they?  SOME mechanism is required to rotate the ship.  It 
might be attitude jets, momentum wheels, thrust deflection, or even a 
team of trained Psionics with the Vertigo power, but it has to be there. 
And the moment of inertia of a starship, even a puny Scout, is 
considerable -- 100 tonnes, 30 meters long, you don\'t rotate something 
like that just by kicking.  Unless you are Very Big.  In which case you
probably don\'t need a starship.
     In fact, to really whip a starship around (like in a few seconds or 
so) the attitude jets have to produce a significant fraction of a \'g\'.  
And that kind of acceleration does not come cheap.  Really.  Honest.  
Would I lie?


FUSION DRIVES

     Everyone seems to have had a fine and dandy time calculating the
specific impulses for various fusion reactions.  This is tonnes of fun,
good clean sport, and provides hours of opperating pleasure.  It also
omits one Important Consideration:

     Why assume that the drives are 100% efficient?

     There is no reason to assume that fusion drives will be 100%
efficient.  In fact, there is good hard experimental evidence to the
contrary.  I have read in non-classified sources that modern
thermonuclear bombs are only 10% efficient.  My own crude estimates, 
also based on non-classified sources (I am, after all, a non-
classified kinda guy) tend to confirm this.  
     Consider the implications:  Drives must meet demanding requirements.  
They must opperate for hours, channel all their thrust in one direction, 
and protect their opperators from heat, shock, and radiation.  Bombs do
not need to meet any of these requirements.  In fact, it is the function
of bombs not to meet these requirements.  It is part of the very nature
of bombs that they FAIL a single one of these requirements, and do so
in as spectacular a fashion as possible.
     If such a simple device as a thermonuclear bomb can only achieve 
10% efficiency, it is reasonable to suppose that thermonuclear reaction 
drives will be far worse, in the vicnicity of 1% efficiency, which works 
out to an exhaust velocity of 100 km/sec or thereabouts, which, oddly 
enough, is about the exhaust velocity of Eight Worlds ships.



SPECIAL BONUS GAZOID COMMENT: FUSORS

     After a lot \'o diddling, I came to the conclusion that fusors and
drives had to meet such a strikingly different set of requirements 
that I could not believe they would be in any way related.  So it
is in the Eight Worlds.  Drives are open ended linear pinch devices,
much like the late unlamented Tandem Mirror machine at Livermore,
and burn D + D --> T + p or He3 + n in vast quantities.  Fusors are
small high-field devices like the Altocampus machine at MIT, and
burn p + Li6 --> He3 + He4  (\'To dream, the impossible dream...\').
Since the products of this reaction are both ionized, they can be
run thrugh an MHD generator to produce power without any of the
nasty bad neutrons associated with less sexy reactions.
     I have, of course, made a complete table of specific powers,
specific impulses, efficiencies, and whatnot, but its at home, I
am not, and I haven\'t looked at it for five years anyway.  If
anyone is really interested, I can dredge it out (dredge dredge).

     Hmm.  Yeah, as I recall, the powered systems on an Xboat were supposed
to sort of "parasitize" power off the jump drive (from the jump capacitors,
presumably).  Nowadays, of course, that idea won\'t work (as per the Starship
Operator\'s Manual [Vol. I]).  Sounds like the Xboat network needs some
overhaul...  :-)

     Why?  The Rift is just a region of space where stars (and, hence the
important commodities, like planets, that can be found near them) are
unusually sparse.  The J-5 route is simply a path across the Rift where
the worlds are "only" 5 parsecs apart.  Many ships don\'t have jump drives
that good, and won\'t be carrying any extra fuel.

     There are good reasons for not carrying that much fuel (enough for two
jumps, that is).  For a commercial ship, more fuel means less cargo, therefore
less revenue.  Remember, to a trader, not making money is a Bad Thing.  From
the military viewpoint, well, having that much fuel (which is singularly
bulky--one metric ton of liquid hydrogen takes up 13.5 cubic meters; one metric
ton of *water* only takes up *one* cubic meter) means having fewer weapons
and smaller magazines--not good, especially in extended battle conditions.
Check the combat advantages of battleriders over battleships for an example.

Organization: personal mailbox at The Next Challenge BBS
 
      Hello,
 
      I\'m new to the list, and playing MegaTraveller, (four
months for both), and this is my first posting. 
 
      I have a question about psionics, basically are there
any sources that give good hints, suggestions, etc., on the
use of them in MegaTraveller? I\'ve found the rule books to
be more tantalizing than useful.
 
      I\'ll explain my reason for asking. I rolled up a
character, got a good psionics rating and a *SPECIAL* ability.
The GM came up with material psychogenesis, the creation of
matter/antimatter via psi. To make a long story short I\'m
*retiring* the character as she unbalances the game.
 
      As an example; the ship the party was travelling on
was being pursued by a much larger pirate vessel that could,
and probably would, stomp us into atoms. I simply created a
milligram of antimatter directly in front of the pirate ship.
Need I describe what the matter\\antimatter explosion did to the
**HYDROGEN** fuel?
 
      Another example; the party was captured by the bad guys.
After waiting a while the bad guys attempt to interrogate the
party individually. The interrogator, in what is obviously a
torture chamber *politely* asks my character in a chair
directly under a devices with lots of blades and stuff. I
refused, he insisted, I refused, he starts to press a red
button, I placed a thumb sized piece of sodium in the center
of his brain, he dies horribly and yuckie.
 
      The GM agrees with my decision to retire my character. So
I\'m trying to find information on psionics and their uses. Any
one out there have any??
 
      Thanks in advance for info, pointers, or hints.

The big determinig factor (besides the primarys luminocity and the distance to
the primary) for the temperature is the worlds Albedo, (ie the factor of how
much of the energy that the world recieves that is reflected off it).

Ye olde "Scouts" had a quite good system for determining albedo by determinig
the proportion of different kinds of terrain on the planets surface. Totally
unworkable by hand but perfect on computer. 
The percentage of clouds and their reflectivity had the single largest
influence on the albedo, and the percentage of clouds was given by Atmosphere
and Hydrographics. But tailoring the reflectivity of the clouds one could 
achieve pretty much any surface temperature.
(and make some doubletalk to the players like: The clouds on Ruie seems to be 
very dark, probably tainted by dust or pollution...:-)

In the example of Ruie (which I did some weeks ago) even this was not enough,
and I had already fudged the greenhouse factor. In the end, I had to put it 
in an orbit about 80% of orbit 0. (orbit -0.2? :-) to give it an temperature
above zero.

If anyone is interested I have an Excel worksheet (for the Mac) that produces
a temperature worksheet if given some basic input about the world.
(a real hack but it workes). I\'ll try to post it if anyone is interested.
(It has one drawback, it uses the luminocity figyres from "Scouts", and
WBH has totally different figures (probably adapted to the system it uses
for determining temperature.))

Ah, but that\'s for acceleration from 0 to (roughly) 10 m/s.  Do the same
computation for 1000 to 1010 m/s and you get about 10 terawatts.  Yet
obviously the same rocket hardware would do either job using the same
amount of fuel and energy.  Clearly you\'re not measuring what you think
you are.  What you are measuring is the amount of energy needed to do
that bit of accelerating by pushing on a fixed object.  That is, with
a catapult rather than a rocket.  The math is right, but you have to
apply it to what you\'re actually pushing on, which for a rocket is its
exhaust jet.

>    While not a very large ship....  It still has enough room...

Actually it\'s pretty sizable, I\'d say.  That\'s the size of an Invincible-
class aircraft carrier.  For solar-system work we can build them a lot
smaller.  However, let\'s assume that mass for convenience.  Now, the
power requirement to expel a jet with a mass flow of (dm/dt) and an
exhaust velocity of v_exh is 0.5 * (dm/dt) * v_exh^2.  So we need to
figure out the mass flow and exhaust velocity.

Mass flow depends on how long a mission we want to fly and how much
fuel we want to carry.  Let\'s say we\'re going to the asteroid belt
and back.  In very round numbers, that\'s a round trip of 1e9 km.
For continuous acceleration (i.e. one half of each leg of the trip),
time = sqrt(2*distance/acceleration) = sqrt(2*250e9/10) = 224000.
That\'s a quarter of the trip, so the whole thing is 900000 seconds,
about 10 days.  As for fuel, if we don\'t want the fuel tank to
dominate the whole ship, a fuel fraction of maybe 10% is tops.
So that\'s 2e6 kg of fuel, giving a fuel flow of about 2 kg/s.  Clearly
fuel pumps, at least, will not be a problem.

Now, what about exhaust velocity?  There are roundabout ways to
compute that, but thrust = (dm/dt) * v_exh due to conservation of
momentum, so we can do it fairly directly.  Thrust to push 20e6 kg
along at 1 gee will be about 200e6 newtons.  (We assume a constant
thrust; in practice one would throttle back a bit as the ship burned
off fuel, to keep acceleration constant, but that complicates the
arithmetic no end and does not affect the result much.)  So v_exh =
200e6/2 or about 100e6 m/s.  The numerate reader will have gone
"gulp!" on seeing that number, since it is about 1/3 of the speed
of light.  Clearly spaceship Invincible\'s engines are going to be
a pretty remarkable piece of engineering.  But we press on...

We now have the numbers we need.  Assuming 100% efficiency and no
losses whatever, spaceship Invincible\'s fusion generator output needs
to be 0.5 * 2 * 100e6^2 = 10 petawatts.  The numerate reader is
having a terrible coughing fit at this point.  For the innumerate:
a petawatt is a million gigawatts, and the entire power output of Earth,
right down to cooking fires, is a small fraction of *one* petawatt.
Clearly, Invincible\'s generators are, um, impressive pieces of
engineering in their own right.

Clearly 100% efficiency is optimistic.  Let\'s say it\'s only 99.99%.
Then Invincible\'s cooling system has to dissipate a mere terawatt
of heat.  (The numerate reader\'s coughing fit returns.  A terawatt
roughly equals the electrical power generation of North America.)
The easiest way of cooling something is with flowing fluid; radiating
heat into space is much more hassle.  Assume we use water; it\'s cheap
and available in quantity, and it\'s a good coolant.  Melting from
ice and boiling to steam both introduce hassles, so let\'s say our
input is water just above freezing and output is water just below
boiling.  That\'s a temperature rise of about 100 C.  The heat capacity
of water is roughly 4200 joules/kg/C, so each kilo absorbs 420e3 J.
So to carry away 1e12 W, we need about 2400 tons per second.  Oops.
Spaceship Invincible has a *bad* cooling problem.

What\'s more, the numerate reader, having recovered from his coughing,
observes that since E=mc^2, boosting the fuel to 1/3 of the speed of
light requires converting about 5% of its mass to energy (we speak
sloppily here for clarity; physicist readers will please keep quiet).
No wonder the power requirement was massive.  The n.r. goes on to
observe that fusion simply doesn\'t convert that big a fraction.
Invincible\'s power requirement just cannot be met by fusion, period.
Antimatter might do; Invincible would need to burn about 50 grams
per second (remember that each gram annihilates its own mass in
normal matter).  Optimistic fans of antimatter propulsion think that
straightforward application of current technology might perhaps get
antimatter prices down to $1M/mg.  Invincible\'s operating costs will
then be fifty billion dollars per second.  I don\'t think even DoD
can afford to fly this spaceship.

I could go on, computing things like radiation output from the power
system, size of heat radiators, etc., but the numbers all come out to
be preposterous.  Not just difficult, but beyond current abilities by
so many orders of magnitude that straightforward extrapolation of
today\'s technology won\'t do -- breakthroughs will probably be needed.

The moral of the story is, don\'t get intoxicated by the possibility of
easy fusion.  It may give us the solar system, but it will not give us
1G constant-boost spaceships.  They are fundamentally hard to build;
still better technology will be needed.

**********************************
Etienne approaches the other members of the Transport team.  He is
dressed in a one-piece flight suit with many pockets.  The rank and
squadron insignia have been removed, but there are several mission
patches still on the suit.  Most of them can be recognized by most
sapients as being major battles that  were fought by the Imperium in
recent years.  Etienne is a little over 6ft and about 165lbs. [sorry, I
will convert to metric next time :(]  He has hair that used to be brown
but has been bleached by the sun, he also has a very dark tan.  He wears
mirrored sunglasses often, even indoors.  There is an empty blade sheath
at his right hip.

	Bonjour, as our gracious host said I\'m Etienne.  I\'m afraid

	Have any of you heard anything?  What is the Alcyon, is she just

If any gentles out there have a list of equipment from MegaT already
typed in could you mail it to me?  I really just need name, price, and
weight.  Please don\'t go to much trouble.

Richard,
  Should we do any shopping now or wait until we reach this supply
depot?  Do our watchdogs let us go to the city?  How about that briefing
we (the transport team) were promised?

To all, how do you get accent marks on this stupid machine!!!  French
just doesn\'t look right without them.

I agree.
I think that is what I was aiming for when I wanted to define agility as
rotational energy and speed.

Regarding fusion drives: Since the fusiondrive is supposed to be internal
and not drive around as a "simple" rocket engine, the efficienct figure of 
a few percent for the powerplants seem a bit low. 
(The last estimate was (I think!) around 250 MW /kl. Max TL15 is 18 MW /kl)
 A efficiency of around 15-20 percent would seem more appropriate. 
I don\'t think the analogy with a bomb is applicable here, a bomb is in the 
process of blowing up, scattering its fuel far and wide (at least in the later
stages) and a powerplant could seprate the unused hydrogene from the helium and
refeed it.

And let\'s hope that the powerplants continue to use a hydrogene or deuterium
only reaction. It\'s hard to scoop up Litium in a Gasgiant:-)

The Rule Book is about all I have seen.  You may also want to check out Alien
Module 6 (I think) The Zhodani.  There are also several of the small adventures
that deal with Zhodani and converslly with psionics.  If you can find back
issues of the Journal of the Travellers Aid Socitey and Challenge Magazine,
then you may find some stuff there.  (Sorry, at 12:49 in the morning after a
long day, I don\'t have the energy to dig through them all :-)

Your GM started it . . .  I think the psychogenesis was a neet idea, I think
it may have been implemented wrong.  First of all, the creation of matter is
something that is like REAL difficult.  (Something I heard in a chemistry class
once.)  I would say making Anti-Matter would be even harder.

Now, if we look at it from the view point of your psychogenesis takes matter
and reorganizes it, then we can proceed.  Lets ASSUME your PSI level is 8 (Real
good) and that you can reogranize matter/anti-matter into a new form.  You
should have several skills that go with it.

  1.  Create Gasses (Hydrogen, Oxygen, etc)
      Level 1, 1 Point + 1 point per volume.  1 liter = 1 point, 10 liter=2
      points, 100 liter=3 points and so on.  Maybe put a cap of 10,000 liters.
      Thus at level 8, if you dumped all of your points you could create
      10,000 liters of Oxygen at standard pressure.  And expend 6 psi points.

  2.  Create Liquids
      2 points + 1 point per volume starting at 1 ml and working up.

  3.  Create Soft Solids
      3 points + 1 point per volume starting at .1 ml

  4.  Create Hard Solids
      5 points
  5.  Create Heavy Solids (Uranium, Lead, Gold, etc)

You can see how this is progressing.  Now you need task rolls for this stuff.
An example task of making anti-matter would require a Skill of 8, 8 points for
0.0001 grams, 9 points = 0.001 grams, 10 points = 0.01 grams, 11 points =
0.1 grams and 12 points = 1 gram.  The chance of success is an Impossible Task
(19+ I believe) + Skill.  Thus with an 8 Psi, one could create 0.0001 grams of
anti-matter on a roll of 11 or 12.  On a mishap, you are touching the
Anti-Matter and you and anything within 1Km is destroyed.  This puts that skill
in perspective and makes that power considerably more balanced.  Also you can
put limits on how far away you can create things and if you can create them on
the other side of a solid surface.  (A wall or Skull blocks your
psychogenesis).


Now what can we do to keep from retireing this character.  You and the GM sit
down and decide that this skill is unbalancing and you want to correct it.
During the next session, the character takes a 4mm slug from a Gauss rifle to
the head.  Some brain damage is suffered.  Full recovery happens, but the
ability is gone or drastily reduced.  Also, you could have the trama awaken
another ability to replace the psychogenesis if you just want to get rid of
that.

It also makes for some story material for the GM and it will make the players
more aware that the GM will not hesitate to "waste" a character.  Though in
this case the character recovers, but it may take a few game sessions for this
to happen.  The party could have to deal with the tramatized body for a while
on a planet where there are no medical facilities that can save her.

These of course are just suggestions, but lets try to salvage the character.

	Looks like the double-blind idea isn\'t working out.  Maybe that\'s
okay ( less work for Richard, after all ;-). 

Anyway, here goes:
***************************************************

Jaron Voga looks up as Etienne De Mer approaches. Voga is a slim, short man,
height about 175 cm, massing ~70 kg.  He also wears a flight suit, but
lacking any insignia except shoulder patches bearing the emblem of the
Imperial Interstellar Scout Service and the Exploration Branch of that
service.  Brown hair graying a little at the temples, and a "spacer\'s tan"
from the neck up, from spending enough time in a vacc suit to get one.

	Greetings, Mr. De Mer.  Most people just call me Voga.  I\'m afraid
that you know as much as I do about this expedition.  I for one look forward
to being out in space again, but being dirtside has its perks, fresh air
being one of them.  
	As for our duties, my specialization is in sensor systems.  I crewed
on a Donosev-class scout for awhile, so I hope the Alcyon is as well
equipped.  What of our fellow team members?

Nishu has just moved to stand with the other members of the Transport
team.  He wears a navy uniform of some sort:  black jacket with grey
trousers and shoulder panel.  On the breast pocket is a patch, a black  
circle with five silver stars [emblem of the Five Sisters subsector].
He has no insignia, but the uniform seems to indicate a low-ranking
officer or high-ranking rating.
Nishu himself is a large, broad-chested man.  He has brown hair, brown
eyes, and a well-kept beard.  He seems relaxed and friendly even in
this novel situation. 

	Bonjour, as our gracious host said I\'m Etienne.

"Glad to meet you," he says, extending a hand to Etienne.  "I\'m a
 new arrival of sorts myself."

        What is the Alcyon, is she just
	a transport, or is she armed? 

"I don\'t think we\'ve been told what sort of ship she is, yet.  I expect
 that she\'ll be at least minimally armed; these are dangerous times."

	Which one of us is the poor soul
	who gets to join the command team?  Who is navigator?

"Well, I don\'t know about the team leader, but I\'m hoping to end up as
 navigator myself.  I\'ve had experience in the navy as a navigator and
 sensorman."

	On a lighter note would anyone like to explore this nearby city
	(assuming our watchdogs allow us to) [a small smile]?  I plan on
	enjoying myself my last night near anything civilized.   For
	those who would like to join me, Allons-y, for the rest, Abientot.  

"Excellent idea!  Let\'s ask our host, shall we?"

Somewhere in here, Nishu will turn to the rest of the Transport team
 and find out what positions each is planning to fill (pilot, etc).

Greetings, fellow PBEMers and other folks.

I recently bought MegaTraveller to replace my "Classic" Traveller set of
materials. I like MT very much, and am very impressed with the wealth of
information contained therein.

However, I have run into a problem. I was going through the craft
descriptions in the Imperial Encyclopedia, and was idly punching some
numbers to figure out jump ability and power plant fuel consumption.
I received a rude shock when the numbers didn\'t add up. Please let me
know if I am doing something wrong, so I can rest easy at night. :-)

For example, let\'s look at the give TL15 Scout/Courier design.

864 Mw / 6.0 MW per KL of power plant = 144 Kl of pp.
144 Kl of pp. * 0.009 Kl of fuel req\'d per hour/ Kl of pp. = 1.296 Kl fuel/hr
1.296 Kl fuel/hr * 24 hours/day * 30 days endurance = 933.12 Kl fuel
Listed fuel size is 515 Kl. What gives?

For fun, let\'s try the TL15 Fighter design.

186/6.0 = 31
31 * 0.009 = 0.279
0.279 * 24 * 5 = 33.48 KL fuel
Listed fuel size is 33.6 Kl. Close enough.

What\'s the problem here? I tried it for some other designs, but the numbers
still don\'t match. Someone, please help.

The reason your numbers don\'t match is that they do not take into
account economies of scale (Ref guide - same page as power plants)
For a power plant of size 14+, output is tripled. For working backward,
any ship that has a power output of 252 Mw or more, has 1 kl of
plant per 18 Mw of plant, instead of 1 for 6 Mw.
	This makes the power plant fuel for the scout as:
864 Mw / 18 = 48 kl of plant * 0.009 = 0.432 kl fuel/hour
0.432 * 24 * 30 = 311.04 kl of pp fuel.
	Now the Jump drive fuel is 5x the jump drive volume,
or (5 + 5 * Jump number)% of the total ship volume. For a scout,
this is 15% * 1350 kl = 202.5 kl of jump fuel. (Note that this is a
change from classic Traveller).
202.5 + 311.04 = 513.54 round to 514 kl. The book lists 515 kl,
so they probably rounded seperately.

>For fun, let\'s try the TL15 Fighter design.

>186/6.0 = 31

>Listed fuel size is 33.6 Kl. Close enough.
	Whoever designed the fighter also forgot economies of
scale for the power plant, so you aren\'t the only one...:-)
	The fighter design in the book is bogus for several reasons.
The big one is that with the rules as given, it is impossible to get a 
TL 15 power plant with a 186 Mw output! For plants from 10 to 14 kl,
the output is 12 Mw per kl, so the largest output plant at that level
produces just under 168 Mw, then it jumps to 252 when you hit 14 kl.
The easiest way to fix the fighter is to give it a power plant of 14 kl,
producing 252 Mw, and it just has some spare power for Agility. The
masses given for the fighter are a misprint (the figures listed are for the
enclosed air-raft), so you will have to work out the mass. I don\'t have my
figures handy, but I could post my version later if you want.
	This ignores the issue of whether the amount of fuel used is
reasonable for what we know about fusion....(rant!...rave!..sorry :-)

	I have found the number of errors in the book vehicles to be
rather disturbing, especially since working through the designs is
usually the only way to catch them. If there is interest, I could post
worked over versions of the more common book ships, with notes
on power consumption, etc. similar to the the list of updated ships
that Bertil Jonell posted several months ago. Let me know if there
is interest, I don\'t want to take up bandwidth unnecessarily.

W. Dow Rieder:
        Thanks for setting me straight. I had noticed the efficiencies of
scale table, but for some reason didn\'t notice the part of the table for
large plants. The wealth of information must have been too much. :-)
        I don\'t know about anyone else, but I would be grateful for any
MT errata you or someone else could provide. That way, I can feel that
my money was well spent. :-)

        As I continue to peruse MegaTraveller, I\'ve noticed something
else - but I\'m not sure if it is a bug or a feature.. :-)
        There seems to be some confusion regarding slug thrower skills.
First, there are skills for pistol, body pistol, revolver, and snub pistol.
No mention of gauss pistol; shouldn\'t that be included in the Handgun
skill? Secondly, where does the accelerator rifle fit? How about the
Assault Rocket Launcher? I would presume the Acc Rifle under Rifleman,
and the ARL under Combat Rifleman.
        More importantly, has anyone else noticed that Marines and Army
personnel can\'t get Combat Rifleman? They only can get Gun Combat (like
everyone else), which includes most anything EXCEPT the ACR, Assault Rifle,
and the Gauss Rifle. Further, under the Gunnery chart for the Advanced Navy
generation, you see "Spl Combat." Probably *should* be Space Combat, not
Special Combat, where for some reason, a Navy Gunner gets all kinds of
nasty Marine/Army type skills.
        On a related issue, I find it stupid that only Marines/Army would
be able to use the Gauss rifle and other advanced slugthrowers (not incl.
heavy weapons, though). Especially regarding the Scouts, who according to
my old Book 6, have some police enforcers, commandoes, and shipboard light
troops. Why prohbit them from learning advanced slugthrowers, but allow
"old" slugthrowers, laser weapons, and FUSION & PLASMA weapons? I find
this limitation ludicrous... (and I bet Field scouts would agree; they
would need some firepower to escape an unfriendly planet on occasion,
I\'d think.) If you were a ship commander, would you want your security
troops to have a Gauss rifle (Penetration 7) or a Plasma or Fusion
weapon (Penetration 20 to 34). I wonder. :-)
        Well, I\'ve rambled on long enough. Reply away!

Hi gang,

I wanted to thank everyone who responded to my questions about fusion
drives, etc. and, for those who are interested, pass on my general
conclusions.  I have drawn, in addition, on the work of Dean Ing,
Charles Sheffield, and Robert L. Forward for some of the technical
information; I am grateful to you people for filling in some of the
gaps they left unexplained.

I have ended up with a system that, for fusion drives, uses .5 g/sec
per ton of thrust at one gravity (i.e., acceleration of one ton of mass
at one gee).  This means that if a spacecraft is 30% fuel, it can thrust
at one gee for 600000 seconds, giving the spacecraft a terminal velocity
of 2% c, although what most ships do, since they want to be able to stop,
is to boost to about 2500 km./sec. and then coast until they need to
decelerate; about 20% of the fuel supply operates as reserves for mid-
course corrections and that kind of thing.  Matter-antimatter drives
can do about 12 times better.  This means that the best a fusion-driven
spacecraft could do, without being a multi-stage vehicle, is about 5% c
(terminal velocity; 2% c and maybe a little more if you want to be able
to stop at the end of the voyage).

What all this means is that it takes a few days to get to Mars, a bit more
than a week to get to Jupiter, and a few weeks to get to the outer planets.
If you coast for a year, you find yourself in the inner reaches of the
cometary halo.

Some people have been talking about solar system generating, etc.  One
thing I have always wondered about is why the Traveller system, especially
Megatraveller, has not assumed a space-industrialized society.  You do not
have to worry about whether or not there are Earth-like planets in a solar
system, or terraforming candidates, if you have either an asteroid belt or
gas giants with moons (and preferably both).  Instead, you built habitats
(even conservative estimates show that you could build microworlds that
could house a million people, and you have enough materials in almost every
solar system to build hundreds of thousands to millions of those habitats).

What I\'ve ended up with are solar systems that have populations in the
hundreds of billions, living in hundreds of "archipeligos," each cluster
of habitats (usually hundreds or thousands in each one) centered around a
fair-sized airless body, like a big asteroid or the moon of a gas giant.
If you\'re interested in adventures that involve trade, politics, corporate
misbehavior, espionage, privateering, terrorism, and a whole range of
criminal activities, I recommend this kind of universe.  (I also
recommend Bruce Sterling\'s SCHIZMATRIX as source material...wonder when
Steve Jackson will get around to making a GURPs version  :)  )  My
experience running this kind of universe is that the possiblities are
pretty much limitless, even if you never travel beyond a single solar
system!

Anyway, take care, please feel free to respond to the subjects I\'ve
brought up, and have fun.  

   Mark

P.S. I would have liked to join the PBM game, it sounds interesting, but
I am simply too busy to do it this time around.  If another one is played,
I would be interested.

They are in Book 3, "Worlds and Adventures".  At TL9, you can have drives A-D.
At TL 10, you get drives E-H.  And so on.  Going to book 2, this means that a
100 ton ship can be given a jump 4 at TL9!  All it needs is a drive class B.
This, however, takes no account of computers.  For a jump 4, you need a model
4 computer, and they first appear at TL 10.

Correct.  It took power from the jump capacitors, which were charged up by the
X-boat tender.  If an X-boat misjumped, it was up a well known creek without a
paddle.

There is one problem which MegaTraveller has overlooked.  It\'s great fun
designing all these ships at TL 15.  You get super-powerful scout/couriers,
X-boats with power and manoeuvre, nice neat power plants, etc.  Until your
nice neat TL 15 power plant breaks down.  Then you have to find a nice neat
TL 15 starport to fix it.  And there aren\'t that many.  On the other hand,
the good old TL 9 scout/courier can get its spares anywhere that can make a
jump drive.

So you want a ship that is 30% fuel to be able to reach 4% of c?

ok, the mass-ratio of the ship is:

Mr = 1/.7 = 1.428...

the final velocity (.04 c) is:
Vb = Ve * ln(Mr)
.04 c = Ve * ln(1.428..)
.04c = Ve * .03566...
1.2e7 = Ve * .03566..
3.36e7 = Ve

So we need an exhaust velocity of bwtter than 11% of c!

Isp = Ve * g
Isp = 3.36e7 / 9.8
Isp = 3.4e6

Now the good news. Wer have engines *now* that can do this. The bad
news is that they are ion drives with a thrust measured in *hundredths*
of a g... <sigh>.

I suspect that you won\'t get a *fusion* drive to do this well, as the
"standard" 6e5 figure is likely figured by assuming *all* the energy
released in the fusion reaction is deposited in the exhaust of helium.
You *can\'t* improve that. Not without changing it into something other
than a fusion drive.

Let me prefece this by saying that I have played psionics in Traveller
in about half of my characters. I have only had one that was lucky
enough to have a SPECIAL ability and my GM gave me Pyrokenesis, the
ability to start small fires. A good way to make distractions.

Anyway the problem that you had was not your fault, from the examples that
you gave you did not abuse the power given you. The problem that I see is that
your GM gave you a power that was to powerful. Also you don\'t mention any
repercusions that might have occurred when you used you powers. As an example,
I had a character that was born on a Zhodani controlled world, he showed
promise and was trained by the Zhodani for service in the consulate, later
he was expelled from the Consulate for wrong thinking. So as a result, he 
became a staunch Immperialist, even working for the Imperial Secret Service
at one time, spying on his former contrymen. Anyway he found himself in a 
firefight allied with a party of Imperial, against some renegade belters.
He was severely wounded and was dying. I asked the GM running the game, 
does my character feel that he can live letting the mdeic that was working
on me at the time continue her crude work. When you are in an ATV in the 
middle of a firefight you can\'t do a heck of a lot of good medical work.
He said that I felt that if I didn\'t heal myself, that was one of
my abilities, I would die. I healed myself, you should have seen the look
on the girls face that was working on me when my internal organs just stopped
bleeding and my chest sealed itself back up. Once she realized what had 
happened, she pulled a ACR on me and threatened to kill me right then and there
Your GM seems to have neglected the first rule in psionics, Everybody HATES
them, they think that you will sit there and read their minds all the time.
Yet, you as a Psionic know that that is the last thing that you will do. 
Someones mind is their most private posession and you would never violate
the trust of a friend. Besides if you friends know about you then they should
wnat to kill you becuase we all know that you can\'t be trusted. 

In the above example, I had to do some quick talking to keep from being killed
it worked, but her trust was never totally there again, and that hurt
my character more than the pulse laser that had laid my chest open in the
first place.

>      The GM agrees with my decision to retire my character. So

The GM did you an injustice, he or she didn\'t think of the consequences
whe he gave you the power. Don\'t blame yourself for what happened, it 
was the GM\'s fault. I am glad though that you had the wherewithall to
realize that by destroying game balance you would have enventually 
destroyed the fun for everyone playing, especially the GM. It is 
important that everyone have fun, or there is no reason to game. 
After all it is still a game and I was always taught that games should
be fun.

question of his own. He appears to be in his mid-twenties, although his
wild eyes hint at far greater knowledge than one so young should posess.
He is dressed in a rumpled lab coat, which he wears like a soldier would
wear his uniform. It has been washed recently, but it still bears spatters
of chemicals, and a bulky hand-computer peeks out of one of the pockets.
He speaks somewhat hesitantly, as though he was felt more comfortable
conversing with his computers than with other people, and his voice is
occasionally touched by a Terran(German) accent.

"Ahh..yes. Herr Khervatchkov, this ahh...Alcyon? Yes...does it have
any visible means of support? Is it anchored to ze planet by a kind
of ahh...\'beanstalk\'? Yes...which may provide trrransport to ze surface,
or is it merely sitting in orbit like zome kind of HULA HOOP?? Mein
Gott!! Ze possibilities in antigrrravity alone are UNGLAUBLICH! Ach! Ze
creatures zat must have once roamed ze...ze..."

At this point, Dr. Morser realizes that he has been ranting to himself
more than asking a question, and grins sheepishly.

"Excuse me. I sometimes get caught up in my rrreasearch," he says
apologetically. He retakes his seat, looking expectantly towards
the lectern.

There are many bugs in Megatraveller, especially when considering "classic"
traveller.  There are errors in tables (numbers here and there), half of
some tables are missing (mainly Striker tables), and entire tables missing...
(agian Striker and Robots).  All things considered, MT is ok...but like people 
on the list have already said....they didn\'t proof it very well if at all and 
they did a very lousy job of the vehicle designs.

Any comments from the gallery?

Fellow Travellers,

I was recently browsing through the TML archives, when I came across archive
message #274, which refers to a set of DGP archives in an account on the
Delphi system.  I don\'t have access to Delphi, but I have a friend who
does, so I asked him to check it out.  According to him, the archives are
no longer there.  I\'ve heard rumors that they might have been moved to the
GEnie system, but I have absolutely NO access to that one.

Anyway, I was sort of hoping that one of you might either have access to
GEnie, or have already got your own copies of the original Delphi DGP
archive articles.  Below is a list of the old archive contents.  I\'m
particularly interested in the articles marked with arrows.

True, Traveller may be ignoring the possibilities of a completely space
based society in a system.

On the other hand, try to find a copy of "Outcasts of the Heaven Belt". This
novel deals with such a society 50+ years after a a war. Their tech level
is rapidly dropping due to loss of skills and resources during the war. And
they are getting pretty nasty, as factions try to keep *their* habitats
going. 

Planets are only necessary if you need to be able to have survivors after
a major "oops!". The minimum tech level that will allow life on a habitable
planet is 0. The minimum for a space colony is higher than *our* current level!
Say at least 9. This has grave consequences.

A couple of points no one has mentioned about the psionic character and
his attack on that pirate ship.

1. 1 milligram of antimatter is roughly equivalent to 10 kilos of TNT.
   That ain\'t gonna bother the pirate much. (approximately .01% of the
   mass in a fission bomb is converted to energy, a 20 kT bomb has about 
   10 kilo\'s of fissionables. The rest is simple calculations)

2. This happened in *space*. Therefore, the hydrogen fuel is no big deal.
   Hydrogen is *NOT* explosive. Hydrogen mixed with an oxidizer is. Blow
   a hole in a fuel tank, and you\'ll cause a small side thrust due to the
   escaping fuel. You\'ll also make them worry about their fuel reserves.

******************  WHOAH! *******************
We\'re overloading the list!
Time for some more rules :(

Rule 1:

   Stop posting to the general mailing list.  So far, despite
   my problems transmitting, I have been hearling (almost) all
   of you without problems.

   If you are really sure you need to get to me another way,
   send a message to   traveller-request  and ask James to 
   bounce ..er.. forward the message to me.

Richard\'s corallary:  Don\'t mail to me and copy the list, too. 


Rule 2:

   Keep up your interest.  It might get hard to do that here for
   a while.  Things are going to slow down a little bit for a week 
   or two.  

   I am now the TOPIC COORDINATOR for the game.  This means that 
   even if you do post to the mailing list with PBEM material, it 
   will get forwarded to me, and make some people work harder.

   It also means I\'m scrambling to VERIFY every address is working
   properly.  Several of you will finally get to hear me, since I
   am devoting most of my game energy to that.  I don\'t have mailing
   list software, so I\'m doing this manually (if it\'s possible to do
   anything other than type manually on a computer.)  


Rule 3: (mainly for me)

   I am going to gather all the messages for an entire week, digest
   and prepare as appropriately, and then try to take care of ALL
   posting and forwarding on Tuesday.  This means your messages will
   take seemingly forever to get to their recipient.  Sorry.  Too
   many of us for me to devote more time to it.  It does mean we can
   make a jump in *real time* :-)  (fantasy time?)  

   More practically, it means try to get your information for turn
   x to me by or during the weekend preceding that turn.


Other things:

We\'d better stick with double-blind.
Although we\'d all like to get hopping right away, it\'s undoubtedly better
to hang on another week or so for me to close out the rolls and finalize
the workings of these nefarious mailers.   I\'ve thought about letting people
send mail directly to each other and copy me.  Probably a bad idea.  Then
we risk many of us having mail problems and really slowing us down.  Better
to get my stuff working right and then forward messages as needed.  (great
idea I just had - *fog of battle* - don\'t forward!  fiendish :-). )


Use agora if you can.
Finally, everyone please use my agora address in preference to the oresoft
address (both given below).  I do understand if you feel a need to use
the oresoft address, though.  (I\'d *better* :-))  And *please* only send
mail to ONE address, not to both.  I duplicated about 50 messages and then 
accidentally erased about 30.  Don\'t think I killed anyone, but it\'d
sure go easier on the party if\'n the ref didn\'t grumble so much :-).


Turn forthcoming!

I had one campaign where *the whole party* was highly psionic.  They
got into some truly interesting mischief.  One character had a
special that allowed her/it (a feline race - not aslan) to  use or
channel energy from outside her, to her advantage.  She decided
to use a level 7 teleport.  She wanted to go a long way in a big 
hurry.  (With good reason I might add :-).)

In short order, she had indeed escaped, but was naked and totally
exhausted.  She rested a few minutes to gain apoint or two back, and
then *plugged her tail into a power outlet* in order to "recharge
herself".

She forgot that it also took psi strength to hold/convert the
electrical energy.  It took about 3 seconds, then she was 
catapulted (couldn\'t resist :-), smoking, accross the room. 
That was one cat that remembered from then on - EVERYTHING HAS A
PRICE.

	I have always assumed that travelling through jump space did odd
things to one\'s metabolism. This has had amusing consequences.
	A situation arose where a scout (for her own perculiar reasons) has
kidnapped/press ganged sever locals from a lowish tech planet and is leading
them (somewhat reluctantly) on a life of adventure, excitment and really wild
things. Two of them, Christof and Phoebe, come from a strict religious (c.f.
Bible Belt) section of the population and have decided that they would rather
share a room together and fight temptation rather that live with infidels.
	That wend fine but now Phoebe\'s period is seven days late and having
had a, shall we say, terse sexual education they are climbing the walls.

So, this list is pretty successful -- I\'m seeing at least 40 messages a
week, and no sign of a letup in sight.  Maybe it\'s time to make this thing a
Usenet newsgroup, with an e-mail gateway for those people without Usenet
access?  It would be a feature, from my point of view, to be able to use the
news interface, and I don\'t foresee any major objections from the net.
\'rec.games.traveller\'?  \'rec.games.frp.traveller\'?  Any encouragement or

Here is the directory listing I pulled off of Genie last night.  I would
love to make this a free service, but hey, I am trying to buy a house and
my wife has taken all my money.  When she finds out about this, I will
probably find a marble rolling pin on my head :-).

Here is a list of what they have.  File sizes are generally 2% smaller than
is listed (wierd file sizes on their computer).

On the subject of jumpspace I have a three big questions:

What, excactly is jump-sickness?

Does it come from some kind of radiation in jumpspace?
(presumably emanating from the different natural laws there?)

Is it related to the reason behind that Jigd-Il-Jagd can\'t travel in jumpships?

     Interesting questions.  I just happened to have my copy of the
Starship Operator\'s Manual (Vol. I) handy (I love dialup), so let\'s
take a look at the section on "Jump Drive:"

     [Oh, yes...I am quoting without the express permission of either
GDW or Digest Group, but I think I\'ll be brief enough that it\'ll come
under the heading of "fair use."]

     In the section headed "THEORY," it is stated:

          "...As the discharge of the drive energies to the hull grid
          increases, the unraveling [of normal space] becomes great
          enough to open up a \'rift\' in the weave of jumpspace."

Okay, that\'s jump transition.  It goes on further to say, on the subject of
the jump field:

          "...As the rift closes, the protective jump field \'bubble\'
          around the ship is also sealed.  This bubble keeps out the
          strange physics of jumpspace, and serves to provide a safe
          region for the ship, where the normal physics of our universe
          operate..."

So we can see that the ship (and occupants) are *protected* from the
effects of jumpspace.  That such protection is considered necessary
suggests that jumpspace exposure is harmful in some way, yes?

     In the "comments from the Old Timer" section (worth the price of
the book, IMHO), an anecdote is related where one crew member is lost
into jumpspace (as a result of a hull breach) and another dies of
jumpspace exposure (jump sickness) even though he is wearing a vacc
suit (which, I should think, would provide some protection from
radiation).  Later on, in a discussion of the jump field bubble mentions
that people can go insane from close exposure to the field surface (a
few centimeters) and some can die of the effects.  However, if a decent
distance is maintained (a meter or so), people can crawl around on the
hull without much in the way of harm.  I\'d say it was *dangerous*, of
course, but not *deadly*, if one was careful.  I\'d also say that this
rules out radiation, unless this "radiation" falls off in intensity by
some rule much worse than that obeyed by normal electromagnetics.

     Offhand, I\'d say that jump sickness was caused by the effects of
a different physics on a biological system.  In other words, this
causes adaptive changes that can eventually kill (due to slow re-adapive
changes upon return to normal space?).  A minor exposure causes
insanity due to the extreme sensitivity of the nervous system in
comparison to other systems in the body.  The effects of minor changes
would show up there first.  Also, other, more robust systems would have
a chance to recover easier since they suffer bad effects much less.

This is a dissenting opinion. On Usenet, the bandwidth would instantly
multiply by a factor of ten, and 

(a) if James were moderating things he\'d be buried

(b) if James weren\'t moderating things this group wouldn\'t be worth reading.

Leave Usenet to Usenet type reader, and leave the TML where we can all

Well, all right, maybe only a facotr of two, but that\'s still too much.

(What do I have against Usenet?  Space limitations prevent me.)

Sorry, BArt, but I consider it a really poor alternative.

Rob,

That Genie listing was the answer to my dreams!  I can imagine how much
work (and cost) would be involved for you to download it for us, so I
won\'t ask.  What I would like to know is, how do I get access to Genie?
I assume I have to subscribe and get a login/access code from some sys.
administrator.  Could you tell me how it\'s done?

Much thanks,

Weapon choice would obviously depend on the situation.  Plasma or Fusion guns
are usually a *BIG* no-no for repelling boarders.  Unless the fighting is
taking place in a very large cargo bay, the defenders will end up turning them-
selves into crispy critters along with the attackers.  There might also be a
lot of unintended fatalities as bulkheads, decks, and the outside walls of the
ship are inadvertently penetrated and people from both sides of the battle are
sucked out through the resulting 3 meter holes.

I will agree though, that P & F guns are great fun for dirtside use.
Commanders should have HE weapons AND slug-throwers in their armories.

Just my $0.02.

Absolutely true about space habitats, but if you have a large enough
population base, the entire society is unlikely to crash, although there
may be technological breakdowns that cause individual habitats or even
archepelagos to die.  I have a feeling that once certain technologies 
are available, and humanity has spread to a broad enough population base,
and a large enough number of locations, we will have passed some critical
point where the only thing that can wipe us out is several supernovas.
In addition, I assume in my gameworld an intergalactic community of 
intelligent races; mankind has enough powerful allies at this point that
even if every one of the several thousand solar systems we inhabit were
attacked (an enterprise that would cripple the economy of almost any
civilization), we would still not be totally wiped out.  Those habitats
that survived would have to go into debt, in a big way, but there would
be parts and skilled labor available for those who needed it.

Hey!  It\'s time once again to play "STUMP THE PANEL"!

OK, seriously, vehicle combat in MT.  I was looking at the specs. for the
Sword Worlds TL11 Gram grav-tank (inside cover, "101 Vehicles") and I noticed
2 things which puzzle me.

First, the tank has a "TL11 Point Defense".  This is listed in the MT Ref.
Man. as:

        "  Point defense targetting allows the weapon to fire at incoming
         missiles and projectiles.  Hardpoint mounted weapons automatically
         have this capability.
        "  For each direct fire weapon which must also serve in a point
         defense capacity, install one point defense targetting module."

Now, since the Gram grav-tank has the following weapons:
                                Pen/        Max.    Auto  Dngr
                     Ammo Rnds. Attn Dmg    Range   Tgts  Spc  Sig  ROF
        Plasma PA-11  -    -    44/5 20   VDist(5.1) 2     15   H   40
        3 cm AutoCan HE   500    2   6    VLong(3.5) 4     3    M   200
                     HEAP 500    5   4    VLong(3.5) 4     -    M   200
                     KEAP 500    4   4    VLong(3.5) 4     -    M   200

I assume that the PA-11 automatically has PTD (Pt. Def. Targetting) and
the one add-on mentioned is for the autocannon.  Anyway, how does this
get used in vehicle combat?  Does the tank gunner give up a shot at a
target during a combat round, and elect to use PDT to eliminate incoming
rounds instead?  Or does PDT automatically provide some kind of defensive
DM for the tank and no explicit crew action is required?  I can\'t find
any references in either MT or in Classic Traveller which clear this up.

Second question: where does the 3 cm Auto-Cannon come from?  If I were
to design my own tank, using the tables in the Ref. Man., I wouldn\'t have
3 cm as an available choice.  On pg. 77 (Table 23), the sizes start at
4 cm and increase from there.  Did the GDW folks design this tank using
the old rules from Striker (which I don\'t have)?

Inquiring pre-combatants want to know.

        "Look.  All of this talking is getting us nowhere!  I think we
         should try a more direct approach."

        "MY GOD!!  THAT\'S A HAND GRENADE!!"

        "Right.  It\'s faster than imperial arbitration, and it hurts less."

     Not quite that bad, but it *would* be ugly.

 >(a) if James were moderating things he\'d be buried

     Yes!  He certainly would.  Also, if he was moderating a public
newsgroup as opposed to a mailing list, his support would go to hell.
Sure, *we\'d* still be there, but there\'d always be some twit who\'d
decide to aim some snide commentary at James just because something
didn\'t suit *him*.  Nobody needs that.  Trust me.  I know.

 >(b) if James weren\'t moderating things this group wouldn\'t be worth reading.

     Yup.  This is quite true.

     As I said, I know.  I know from my own *personal* experience.  A
couple of years ago, I was a newsgroup moderator.  I (along with two
others) moderated the sources and binaries groups for the Amiga.  I was
the one who usually got to deal with the mail, in addition to testing
and posting the software.  From what I read, it seemed to be impossible
to please *anyone*.  It wasn\'t that bad, but moderating a low-traffic
group like comp.sources.amiga took a *lot* of work.  The amount of work
James would have to put in if he were moderating this as a newsgroup
would be at least an order of magnitude worse.  Eventually, we (my co-
moderators and I) had to drop it due to lack of time, and we were
working for a *university*.  James has a real job (hence, less time).

     Bottom line?  I agree with Metlay.  Keep this as a mailing list.
Look on the bright side...  Mail doesn\'t expire like news postings, so
if you\'re gone for a while, you won\'t miss anything, eh?

(Possible Spoilers on the passive energy scan, capt\'n!!!)

Jigd-Il-Jagd (sp?) in a minor race in a sector coreward of the Imperium.
They were detailed in an old JTAS that I recently got my hands on. They
are strange in many ways, For example, they looks like baloons and live in
the upper reaches of gasgiants, They can\'t travel through jump and they
don\'t like people scooping where they live (imagine the shockwave from a
scooping ship) and usually respond with heavy plasma fire...

Can a FGMP penetrate a ship\'s hull?  Its penetration rating is 34, while even
an "unarmoured" ship has an armour rating of 40 (according to Striker - I\'m
still one of these old timers who sticks to the good ol\' stuff :-) .

I dislike using PGMP\'s and FGMP\'s for on-ship - and other close-quarter -
combat for another reason.  Those things have severe recoil problems.  You
just do not do snapshots with them.  You have to get into specific poses, so
that the recoil can be absorbed properly.  They\'re also very heavy; even the
mini-gravitics on the TL15 stuff won\'t help you against inertia, and using
one will feel a bit like pushing a cannon around on a trolley.  Result; I\'ve
got my high-tech laser carbine, he\'s got his FGMP.  He starts aiming his gun;
I take a quick snapshot and put a nice hole in him.  Lasers are especially good
for the tactic of standing by the corner, then quickly going round and firing
at any enemy in sight.  And for heavy duty, a high-tech laser rifle can match
the penetration of the PGMP-12.  Both, according to Striker, have penetration
of 20.  A bit more clumsy than the carbine, but much neater than the PGMP.

As for slug-throwers; I always preferred ACR\'s to gauss rifles.  They\'re down
a point on penetration (ACR 6, gauss rifle 7) but ammo is more widely
available as it\'s TL 10 vs. TL 12.  There are lots more TL 10 worlds of low
enough law level, than there are TL 12 worlds.  And at a push, you can use
ordinary slug ammo instead of the discard sabot stuff.  This drops your
penetration to 4, but its better than an empty rifle!

Well it has been a while since I signed up on GEnie, but let me try to 
remember, I think you call an 800 number and then you give them some info
like a credit card and stuff like that. Then you are set to go.
Gee, most of that wasn\'t much help. I\'m sorry I just dont remember.

I do know that it is relatively inexpensive compared to say CompuServe. 
But by how much I don\'t know. I have company sponsored accounts, an 
advantage to at one time being Commodore\'s Online Support person. I was
promoted but finagled some free accounts. Also GEnie uses it\'s own net
but they have nodes all over the place so you should not have to pay long
distance rates. I have to do that for CompuServe, bummer.


>Much thanks,

Sorry, that I can\'t remember but I will look at some of the stuff up there.
I can\'t volunteer to Download all of it but if I do download some stuff, I
can make it available to the list. If that is what folks would like.
Also, if you have some reasonable requests I could get the stuff down, you
know like one or two articles. You see the networks watch where I spend my time
and if I spend too much of it in areas that are not business related then they
can pull the accounts.

I have to agree with metlay and Brent about turning TML into a moderated
Usenet Newsgroup.  The amount of background noise that would induce would
make it unreadable.  Also, I very much like the "club" feeling (mentioned
earlier) that being a part of TML gives us.  And finally, my own workload
sometimes prevents me from reading News for weeks at a time, so I might
miss something.  But there\'s always time for E-Mail :-).

OK, this is fine.  However, I still don\'t understand how this translates
into game mechanics.  Given the same grav-tank (w/ PA-ll and 3 cm. AutoCan),
can I simply say that, in a given combat round, the Autocannon will be used
for PDT and assume that it shoots down ALL incoming projectiles 100%?  If
so, then this is way too powerful.  I mean, what\'s to prevent you (the gunner)
from treating your enemies grav-tank as a PDT target and eliminating the \'To
Hit\' round all together?

What would the MT combat stats. for the 2 cm. and 3 cm. AutoCannon be?

Well, it looks like maybe there\'s enough of us interested in those
files that maybe we should take up a collection and get \'em all at
once for the whole list?  If the cost of getting them is going to be
prohibitive for any one member (I sure of that, looking at the
number and size of thos files), it will surely be too expensive for
all of us to rush out and get Genie accounts.

Any thoughts on how to implement a group fund to pay for downloading
them?

My $0.02 about becoming a newsgroup...

NO, NO, NO!

1. There is some measure of selectivity in a list.
   Only seriously interested people go to the trouble of
   subscribing.  (I hate to think how many requests I\'d have for a
   PBEM if the whole world could play.)

2. There is some minor measure of copyright protection in a list.
   Because we are self-selecting, and de-facto moderated, we are not
   completely public.  (I wouldn\'t trust this alone to hold or void
   a copyright if you wanted to mail in a really neat adventure,
   though.)  
   
3. It\'s a lot harder for your system manager to cut off access to
   your mail, than it is for her/him/it to cut off your newsfeed
   (well, justifiably cut it off.)


One alternative (really radical alternative) I\'ve considered:

	Is there anyone out there with connections to GDW and/or Digest
	Group?  Why not, monthly, glean the best of the list, and make
	it available to the readers of Challenge and Traveller\'s Digest?

	(Plans and adventures cost extra, of course :-)

	Whoever did this would get published, make a little pocket
	change (very little.  GDW pays 1/4 cent per word, Digest group 
	pays 1/2 cent per word, last time I checked), and maybe actually 
	get a fund going to download some of those files from Genie :-).

I\'m with metlay on this one.  I can\'t see how making the tml a Usenet newsgroup
is going to improve the quality of discussion around here.  If anything, I
can see the quality going down as people from rec.games.frp start
contributing ( AD&D -- Blechh! ).

Oh yeah, the 3 cm autocannon is described on page three of 101 Vehicles ( I
think :-). In regard to the discussion about weapons skills, I think that a
referee should decide on some sort of house rules as to what someone should
be able to take as a weapon skill if they receive "gun combat".  The "gun
cbt" skill is a cascade skill, after all, and the character\'s choices should
be limited by his or her occupation. I can\'t really see a doctor character
taking fusion weapons as his skill under "gun cbt"...

I will try to find out information on how to access GEnie.  Here is the basic
information that I have.

I think they have a DATA 1-800 sign up line.  You probably could call
1-800-555-1212 and get the number (but Hey, I will try to find it for you :-)

You need an account (Much like CompuServe).  The rates at last check were:
  300 baud      $5.00 an hour
 1200 baud      $5.00 an hour
 2400 baud      $12.50 an hour
(Higher speed = lot higher rates).  They still have prime and non-prime time
rates.  The values above are for non-prime time (6p to 6a EST I belive, but I
will verify that too)

Hopefully they will have a local access number in your city.  They have both
1200 and 2400 baud access here in Louisville, KY.  I will also check to see
about getting to them via Telenet and Tymenet.

Since I have the account, it would make sense for me to do the downloading
huh?  I wouldn\'t mind draining the BBS messages off of there and cross posting
them if they were/are worthwild.  Maybe after I can convince da wife to let me
use it instead of CServe.  (Since UofL is getting me a CIS account so I can
stay in touch with Borland and such).  I will see how it goes with it.

If I can wing this with her, then I will start grabbing a few files a month
and posting them.  I didn\'t pay attention to the frequency in which they were
uploaded.

Payment?  If she will be cool about this, then maybe you all can fly to
Louisville for a Weekend Traveller Bash of Pizza and Gauss Rifles.  (It is hard
finding Traveller Stuff and players here in L\'ville)

I\'ve got a few suggestions for getting those GEnie files, which I am
very interested in myself.

One suggestion:  We (this will probably be Jim or somebody with a GEnie
account) talk to GEnie, and ask them if there is some way we could get
the files on some form of magnetic media, such as disk or tape.  If they
wanted to charge us, we have them quote us a price.  Once we have a
price, we quote it, and then us TML "members" make contributions until
the amount is needed.  Then we post the files, and we\'re all happy.

Suggestion two: We estimate the cost of downloading the files at a given
baud rate.  Hopefully, this will be done at 9600 baud, for the benefit of
the poor soul that will finally do it.  Anyway, once we get a good
estimate, we all make "contributions," and then reimburse some volunteer
for getting them.  Any extra money obtained could go to this volunteer
also, to provide a little incentive, and to compensate for time spent,
phone bills, etc.

If we were to solicit "contributions," I propose that Jim, or some proxy
that he designates, be the "treasurer" for this endeavor.  Reciepts
could be posted on the TML, or privately e-mailed, and the progress of
the kitty could also be periodically posted on the TML.

I absolutely agree!  We need to get all of this stuff onto one of the
archive systems (sunbane, joshua, etc.) so we can all get at it whenever
we want.  I\'d definitely be willing to kick in my share of $$ to cover
the cost.

>Any thoughts on how to implement a group fund to pay for downloading
>them?

Well, maybe we can get Rob (at Cornell) to do it for us and then everyone
on this end could split the price equally and send him a check.  Yah, I
know that\'s pretty financially naive, but I suspect that anything else
we come up with would probably be about the same.

I personally want the Subsector data, since I\'ve got a whizzo X-Windows
program that reads UWP\'s for a given subsector and spits out a subsector
map (on a laserjet) that looks almost as good as the stuff printed by
GDW.  I need more data (shades of Johnny 5!) and I don\'t want to type
it in myself!

Richard\'s right- I\'m willing to contribute towards getting those files for
the list.  What kind of money are we talking?  I\'ve never had any dealings
with pay-to-compute services...   Also, have any of the TML members who
have GENIE accounts already have one or more of these files?  No sense in
getting more than we need.

If the person who has access can estimate the cost, that might be a good place
to start.  At any rate, I\'m in.

Let me go up in the next couple of nights and get some of them down and
put them on the list. As I explained in a previous post, I can do it for free
just maybe not all at once. The other thing is that I haven\'t been on GEnie
in about 4 months and my Free account may not be there anymore. :-)

Let me take a look either tonight or over the weekend and let you know what
can be done.

I\'m in an any scheme to get those files, except for credit card frauds:-)

But, some of the things on that list seemed very copyrighted to me. Things like
first drafts out of new books and the UPP\'s that DGP is supposed to be selling
on disc soon. They might be free to use by any GEnie subscriber, but they might
not be free to spread on the TML :-(

By the way: I\'m mostly interested in the sector data listings :-)

	I just thought I\'d toss in my two credits\' worth on the topic of 
weapons in the MT rules, on their availability and their uses. These opinions 
were formulated on the basis of my ten-plus years of ironing out the bugs in 
Traveller Classic, and having to start all over again in MegaTraveller. |-<

	In campaigns that I ran in the good old days when Stref was still 
kicking and lawnorder prevailed Throughout Our Fair Kingdom, the presence of 
an Imperial government with a vested interest in maintaining peace and quiet 
in the starports and on the worlds of its domain made things really simple.
In short, people couldn\'t GET any of the really balance-wrecking weapons under 
normal circumstances, and those who did were usually hunted down and killed by 
the Imperial authorities, who enjoy the concept of citizens with high energy 
weapons and rigid armor about as much as the DEA enjoys the concept of drug 
smugglers having easy access to shoulder-launched missiles and heavy machine 
guns. The difference between the Imperium and the USA in this case is that the 
Imperium has no legal, moral or ethical obligation not to go in shooting, with 
heavier guns than the bad guys have. Arms suppliers are usually a hunted breed 
for similar reasons, unless they "follow the rules" and keep the really bad 
stuff out of the hands of people who shouldn\'t have it.

What did this rigid enforcement of the arms laws mean to the average Traveller 
group? Nothing above TL 10, that\'s what. No Gauss weapons, no high energy 
weapons, and no combat armor or battle dress. And the improvement in game 
quality was amazing: if all you have is an ACR and a combat environment suit, 
you tend to think harder and plan more carefully before you start shooting, 
despite the fact that you know the people you\'ll be fighting are no better off 
than you are, normally. Firefights were significantly fewer and further 
between, and carried an element of real risk in them: the armor/weapon balance 
at TL 10 is such that (at least under the old rules) you could take a hit, or 
even two, and hold body and soul together for a few more rounds before passing 
out, adding to the drama and excitement of the game. Since I was fortunate 
enough to be dealing with sensible and mature gamers in most instances, 
parties were quick to recognize the element of risk and fun this added to the 
game, and followed policy with thankfully little whining from people who felt 
emasculated without a giant, plasma-shooting phallic symbol on hand.

Nowadays, in the Shattered Imperium, these careful regulations, which rely 
upon a well-policed and stable environment to maintain themselves, go to 
pieces. The result is a game where any butthead with enough money can put on 
Combat Armor, pick up an FGMP-15, and go looking for adventure. Adventure? 
Hah! Where\'s the adventure in being able to deep-fry anything and everything 
that\'s thrown at you, up to a point, beyond which you\'re effectively naked and 
helpless? So I\'m experimenting with more, shall we say, PRACTICAL means of 
maintaining game balance, using common sense and some important Trav Classic
rules that should have carried over into MT (but if they did, I don\'t know
where they\'re written up). 

First off, I have relaxed the weapons availability laws in keeping with the
collapse of Imperial High Justice. It is now at least reasonably feasible for
a player to get ahold of anything he wants. The obvious extension of this, the
fact that the bad guys also have anything they want, is a heavy-handed and
unsatisfactory balancing agent; if a party gets smoked in mesquite because
they forget that other people can have FGMPs too, who\'s the poor sumbitch that
has to help them roll up new characters? ME! 

There must be other ways to keep this stuff out of the players\' hands. Some of
the ones I\'ve been experimenting with are: cost, maintainance, and what I call
the "ice factor." First of all, there\'s no way around it: high-tech guns cost 
a lot. They aren\'t easy to find, at low TL they aren\'t elegant or streamlined 
in manufacture, and their power packs and ammo cost a lot, too. Of course, the 
ref who allows the option of having a plasma rifle will also probably let his 
players get rich enough to buy them or lucky enough to steal them, so this in 
itself may not be enough. But it\'s a good place to start.

Second, there\'s a direct relationship between the complexity of a weapon, its
cost, and its cost of maintainance. It\'s fairly easy to keep a revolver in
good shape; it can lie in a drawer unused and untouched for literally years
and yet come up firing at a moment\'s notice. One TL up from that, though, we
have the autopistol, which is much more inclined to be finicky if it\'s
dropped, not kept clean, not handled and oiled often, or even fed the wrong
sort of supposedly-fine ammo. Machine guns are for the most part even more
complex, and so on up the ladder. 

(What about modernization? A very useful rule of thumb is that if a weapon is
introduced at a certain TL, in one more TL it tends to be fairly commonplace,
hence reliable and less cranky, and this margin of safety increases still
more, if slowly, after that. As an example, the first machine guns at TL 5
were crew served, water cooled, heavy, cantankerous, and prone to jams. By TL
6, they were small enough for one man to carry, and reliable enough to work
even when muddy or wet. By TL 7, they were small enough to hold in one hand
and carry in shoulder holsters, and who knows where we\'ll be at TL 8 or 9? The
introductory TL of a weapon and the TL at which it\'s bought are very different
things; this has a bearing on the weapon\'s functionality and features, which
is touched on in very limited ways by the Digest Group equipment sheets, that
scale device performance by TL.) 

When we start talking about Gauss and Hi-E weapons, we are talking about
electric/mechanical devices with a high degree of precision and a lot of
separate components that must all function perfectly for the gun to work. Now,
nobody\'s going to state that these weapons aren\'t rugged; the Imperial forces
couldn\'t fight with them if they weren\'t. But the flip side of this is that
these weapons must be maintained and serviced on a regular basis....and the
means of servicing them is a perfect deterrent to people who think they can
get away with keeping such monstrosities around. According to the rules in
Mercenary (Trav Classic Book 4, for you youngsters out there), a HiE weapon
must be completely disassembled and serviced once every 24 hours. We can 
assume that\'s at its introductory TL, if we wish, and extend the service time 
to a few days or a week. But it won\'t make a difference to a party: when one 
keeps in mind that these things are basically small nuclear reactors 
(according to the rules; we\'ll ignore their patent impossibility for now), it 
becomes obvious that you\'re not going to be able to do a good job on them on 
the workbench in the engine room of your ship! Armories at TL 12 and up are 
among the best-equipped shops in history, and they handle very different needs 
than a starship shop. It\'s one thing to get a fusion gun; it\'s another to keep 
it working. In the uncertain times in which the Imperium now lives, a plasma 
gun is a nice insurance policy for emergencies, but nobody who isn\'t richer 
and better connected than any party has the right to be is going to be able to 
afford to keep them working safely. Gauss weapons are a much easier 
proposition, but can still be difficult to keep in good order; however, most 
folks consider the extra power they provide to be worth the hassle. Note that 
the same problem holds for Battle Dress, whereas one can get away with Combat 
Armor in a pinch since it doesn\'t have powerpack problems.

Third and last is the "ice factor." This is the way other people tend to view 
someone in a risk situation based on their arms and armor. In the campaigns I 
run, it\'s considered common for starfarers to wear pistols of some kind in 
their normal day-to-day activities. However, the carrying of rifles is frowned 
upon, since a longarm isn\'t usually something you\'re keeping handy for 
self-defence in an emergency. If a party is transporting precious cargo,
bodyguarding, or doing other high-risk work, then passersby who recognize this
tend to treat such parties with respect. However, the average guy who goes out 
with rigid armor, a Gauss or HiE rifle, or both, for no good reason other than 
to "be ready for trouble," is going to attract scorn and derision from those 
around him, if in fact he isn\'t arrested or simply shot from behind as a risk 
to pedestrian traffic. He\'s obviously either a criminal, a sociopath, or a 
stupid showoff, all of which make him too dangerous to leave at large. These 
items, with their connotations of Imperial force and heedless crushing of 
resistance, will inspire nobody. You won\'t get hired as a starmerc if you 
walk into your interview armed that way; you\'ll be considered too stupid to be 
a safe employee!

So far, these concepts have integrated themselves well into the campaign I 
run. Occasionally we get people pining for plasma guns, but the last guy who 
actually got one sold it off for a fraction of its value, because he knew he 
needed the cash more than he could use a fusion gun.

Have other people tried similar tactics? Or does nobody other than me mind 
parties that are capable of levelling cities?

PS. If you think THOSE rules are restrictive, my first Traveller universe had 
starships whose interiors couldn\'t withstand any sort of gunfire without 
causing serious damage; boarding actions were done with SWORDS! |-> Sure it 
was silly, but it was a helluva lot of fun, too.

There does seem to be enough traffic to justify a newsgroup.  And I agree 
that the news interface would be a great feature.  So, I would vote in 
favor of a rec.games.traveller group.

Would we eliminate the mailing list if this happened?  Are there some 
discussions that are more appropriate on a mailing list?

I was up on GEnie last night, first time since Sept 89! Anyway, I downloaded
the very Brief descriptions, which is the list that you saw, and the 
not-so-brief file descriptions. The Brief listing is 12K the not-so-brief 
one is 62K. That may be to large for the list. If you want I can send you
the not-so-brief listing to you via E-Mail or I will post to the list.
Give me some feedback as to what you want to see. Also I will be downloading
some stuff for my own interest, so I will post some of that to the list.



Let me know what you want.

Here are some examples from each list.

If there are no objections I will start downloading some of the files this
weekend and will start posting them next week. I shouldn\'t have to much trouble
I checked last night and as long as I poke my head in the Commodore section
everytime I log on there should not be a problem. Since the Downloading doesn\'t
cost me anything, I think that I should be the logical choice to do this. If
someone has any objections let me know. 

Also, there is some Copywritten(?) material on there, mostly the UPW listings
of all the Sectors of the Imperium, so you think that it is all right to 
distribute this. I mean technically whoever is running this RoundTable on
GEnie, wont get any money from my downloading the info, as GEnie let\'s me 
do this Free. So let me know what you think, I will start with the PD stuff
and go from there.

Just got my copy of MegaTraveller in the mail last night.   WHEW!  It is going
to be a while before I can start writing software to gen characters for that
rule set..   Why in tarnation did they make everything so complicated???

I am somewhat disapointed with the new format.  Maybe I\'m just an OT bigot.
I dunno.   

On a different note:  Does anybody out there got any WORKABLE random name 
generation programs/tables/whatever?   I\'m also looking for some tables to 
gen such stats as height, weight, eye color, etc.

Maintainance is difficult, yes, but if you buy a set of tools for the repair
of the guns, one of the best places to repair a gun\'s fusion plant is the 
workshop in your ship. After all where are you going to repair the damage to
the fusion guns in the ship\'s turrets? Plus unless the character has a *good*
gun skill, it won\'t be safe for them to work on it.


I don\'t know about other GM\'s but my players seldom provide their own
transportation. (Mainly due to the fact that their air/raft in the ship
doesn\'t have the correct licenses to operate on a planet, and it takes a
couple of weeks for processing. :-) That leaves rental, or public transport.
You aren\'t going to get on a grav-bus with armour, or any form of energy
weapon (unless you hijack it), and the rental agreements restrict carrying
of energy weapons (in fine print of course) so the first accident has the
charaters paying outrageous penalties for transporting prohibited material.

Almost right, Rob.  I tried this and the XTX99649 part is wrong.  However,
I called the Customer assistance number (above) and a recording told me that
at the "U#=" prompt, you should type "GENIE" instead.  This worked and I
now have an account myself.  Thanks mucho for the lead-in.  I plan to start
downloading the GEnie roundtable files immediately (or within the next few
days, at least).

James, once I\'ve got these files downloaded, can I just shove them onto
Sunbane for the rest of TML?  If not, what would be the best way for me
to make sure that everyone else has access to them?  (Ah, the joys of free
modem access at work.:-))

Ok.  Sherry (The woman with the rolling pin) has said ok to me using GEnie
instead of CIS :-( , but I should be getting my Company paidfor account soon.

Here are a few issues that we should address.

  1.  Do we want binaries posted?
      (Example, I have a uuencoded Lotus 1-2-3 Worksheet for making TL-15 ships)

  2.  Do we want BBS messages posted?

  3.  Do we want all Library files (new ones as they are uploaded and old ones
      as requested) posted or do we want selected ones (directorys posted)?

  4.  What formats do we want used?
      Ex.  Subject lines:
      Subject: Weekly GEnie directory listing  [GEnie]

  5.  Do we want to Crosspost our messags to them and theirs to ours?
      (I vote NO, cost prohibitiave)   

  6.  How often do we want directory listings posted?

  7.  Should we set up a mail archive site (Software posted to comp.sources.unix
      recently) so that anyone on the list could request the files???

  8.  Who will do this?

Below you will find samples of the things from GEnie.

Not long after I started playing Traveller, I learned to program in BASIC and
set up a number of small programs to help me create star systems and character
and NPCS and animals and anything else I could.  I have lists of Vilani names
printed by a program I  developed from an article in the JTAS many years ago.
  Now, I\'m working on a system (in turbo pascal) that will take the sector
data files being uploaded by Joe Fugate run them through the Grand Survey and
Grand Census routines (World Builder once I get it) and store it all in a
binary file for recall at a later date. When you look up that system, it will
have a variety of graphic  screens to display and edit the data for that
system.
  I also have source code for word generation programs, ect.


  I know others of you, using different systems, are programming as well. 
Let\'s use this topic to discuss ways to utilize our computer systems and
upload examples in the library.

I will be finishing up a version of the Vilani word generation program this
weekend (6/4/89) and converting it to Vargr, Aslan, and Zhodani and Droyne
languages.  It\'s written in pascal, so if anyone has a non-IBM computer and
wants the source code let me know.

To Micheal Bay,
     I think the source code should be uploaded as a normal course of
procedure unless the person is planning on marketing the software.  At least
that\'s the way I would do it.

  Just thought I\'d add my two pence worth to the above topics which
interest me.  I must agree with bertil etc. and cast a loud NO vote to
the idea of changing TML into a Usenet group.  It would lose a lot of
its current flavour, and I feel the quality of submissions might
suffer.
  Secondly, I too am interested in those GEnie files, especially the
ones with sector/subsector data, which I could use in my GURPS Space
campaign, which is based in a variant of the MegaTraveller universe.
Living in Scotland does have its disadvantages sometimes, no access to
these files seems to be one of them :-).


Sayonara,
       Derek.

I dont have a feed to usenet from my site, so I would vote AGAINST
establishing a rec.traveller  group.   As stated before by others,
I don\'t think we want to have other discussions by rec.games.frp ppl.

a d-8 situation with a magic ability of ......   IN REAL LIFE)

as for the genie files : interesting.... as for $$$.. well, I have exactly $5

Well, we begin this turn with the ending of the Q&A Session:


At the end of the Q&A-session Johann Abuko speaks up:
	"Mr Khervatchkov, You mentioned that your HQ was far away and that 
	might almost be an understatement" he smiles briefly before he 
	continues "According to a small library search" he indicates his 
	hand computer "The headquarters of Turnskaad Enterprises is located in 
	something called the" he hesitates, squinting at the screen, obviously 
	trying squeeze information about the pronounciation from the letters of
	the text "Talmegiian Confederation somewhere out in the Spinward 
	Marches. Hmm, I never knew that there were anything else than us, the 
	Darrians and the Zho\'s out in the Spinward Marches, but that\'s beside 
	the point."

	"What I\'m driving at is this: Wouldn\'t the fact that your HQ is located
	outside the Imperium make Turnskaad Enterprises a non-Imperial 
	corporation?" Johann hesitates again, It seems that he don\'t quite know
	how to say what he wants to say without offending anyone.
	"The reason that I\'m asking is that I\'ve done some work for one of the 
	Imperial Armed Services, and signed some papers regarding my future 
	work for non-Imperial corporations, trusts, governments and 
	organizations. And I would appreciate it if you could give us your 
	assurance that this mission won\'t involve any, eeh, anti-Imperial 
	activites, if I may put it bluntly. I\'m sure such an assurance will 
	ease the consciences of many." He finishes, looking at Mr Khervatchkov.


Rest assured, you will not come under any legal entanglements by
working with us.  The Imperial Navy and, on one occasion, the
previous emperor himself have used the services offered by Turnskaad
enterprises.  And, although we might not agree as to the particular
parties involved, me might well agree that some particularly
anti-imperial things are right now being done `for the good of the
empire\'.  We have a long history of not being involved in politics.
Politics and business don\'t really mix in the long run.  It\'s better
for our long-term bottom line to be able to accept contracts when
and where they happen.  The particular clients paying for this
mission are decidely pro-empire.

*****************************************************************************

Next question:  Yes, Count Ger?

	How far away is this world?  Can some of those slow merchants
	I\'ve seen hereabouts get there?  And once they do, what
	assurances do I have that some scout is not going to simply up
	and say "I\'m going to point x.  Restricted or not.  You\'ve no
	real authority here?"

That\'s three questions.  First - for security reasons, I can\'t say
how far away this world is.  I will say that you should be able to
get there in two or three weeks.  Second.  So far, no one we\'ve
accepted has a ship with jump capability less than 2.  Not
particularly fast, but not slow either.  Even at this, there are
enough ships here so that you can leave the slowest behind.  Third,
authority.  That\'s one of the reasons we\'re hanging on to your money
until you get back.  If you don\'t follow the rules, you don\'t get
paid.  If it looks like it\'s going to be a problem, speak to me -
I\'m sure we can work out some arrangement short of requiring liens
on people\'s ships.


	One-way remote probe? How did it get back with its report, 
	or do we have FTL communication in this Universe????


Well, we didn\'t exactly say how long ago we found out now, did we?
:-)

	How \'bout acknowledging the rest of the folks who\'ve earned
	their doctorates, not just Abuko?

Er, uh, well, yes.  From the latest information I have, all of the
members of both science teams, most of the engineers, and a least
half of the rest of the crew can say this.  I\'m sure your work will
speak much more loudly for you than I ever could.


At the back of the room, Dr. Morser clears his throat for attention.
He appears to be in his mid-twenties, but something about him makes
him seem...older. He runs a hand through his unkempt hair and straightens
his rumpled lab coat, which he wears like a soldier might wear his armor.
He speaks somewhat hesitantly, as though he were more used to dealing
with machines than with people, and his words are sometime touched with
a slight Terran(German) accent.

	"Well, herr Khervatchkov, zis...Alcyon? Yes...does it have 
	any visible supports, such as a...\'Beanpole\'? Yes...which may 
	lead to ze surface, or is suspended around ze planet like a 
	HULA HOOP?? Mein Gott! ze pozzibilities mit antigravity are 
	ENDLESS!! What must ze POWER PLANT be like..." 
	
At this point, Dr. Morser calms down and realizes he has
been speaking more to himself than anyone else. He looks around rather
sheepishly and apologizes.

	"Excuse me, please. I sometimes get more involved zan I should 
	mit mein studies..."

Adam replies.  Actually, I agree.  The possibiliies are endless.
While I\'m not quite sure how to answer your question, it does remind
me of a previous one about the presence of neutrinos:  No the probe
did not detect neutrinos.




	"I\'ve a couple questions, if ya don\'t mind", Andreas Spear 
	spoke up from the back of the room,  "First off, is this gonna 
	be one a those operations where we hit dirt an split up, or 
	are we gonna stay central and send mixed teams out, or is 
	that up ta us?"

	Spear looks around the room at his fellow travellers, "Two, 
	is there any money in bein\' tha first to see an indie?"

	"An last", a smile crosses his bearded face, "and dearest to me 
	heart on these corporation runs, will our pay be docked fer 
	any reason short a deriliction a duty?"


Operational procedures you\'ll need to work out with the on-scene
commander.  We can\'t effectively dictate that from here.  My guess
is that a somewhat centralized operation, with several mixed teams
will be most effective.  But again, that\'s not my decision.  

Finding and identifying indigenous life forms is one of the main
reasons you are going.  No, there is no bonus for simply doing your
job.  Nice try, though.

Will your pay be docked?  That depends on what you mean by `short of
dereliciton of duty\'.  Desertion?  Insubordination?  Theft?  Plunder,
rape and pillage?  Sabotage?  Espionage?  Malingering?  We have hopes 
that you will act like civilized creatures.  Historical precedent is
quite clear about the penalties for treachery in space.  I\'m sure
your comrades can think of more suitable methods to keep you in line
than the simple threat of financial loss, should you go over the
edge.


	"Another question, if I may.  How long will we have to train for 
	the mission before jumping out?  Will those of us who are here 
	train until the crew roster is filled, or will training continue 
	after the crew is assembled?"  [Dave Sokuku]


The roster is almost full now.  We\'ve accepted several more
applications, and I\'ll introduce them soon.  (1 or 2 days I hope)
In reality (the blistering speed with which this is unfolding...)
most of your `training\' will be to outfit and divide up into teams.



*****************************************************************

So, now lets\'s join some of the small talk after the briefing...


	Edmondsen turns to  Morser and Spear  and smiles.  He\'s a
little above medium height, with straight, golden-brown hair,
greentinted eyes  and dark red-brown skin.  He is in his mid-
thirties with a natural air of authority.  His usually somber
face lights up when he smiles, but quickly returns to normal.

    "Well,  gentlemen, as we will be working closely together
for some time,  I suggest  we get to know each other a little
better. May I offer you both a drink?"

    During  the subsequent conversation  the  following facts
emerges about Edmonsen. He comes from a high-tech, high-popu-
lation world. As a youth he served in the armed forces of his
planet,  and he  holds a  reserve commission as captain.  His
later career was made in somthing called the Welfare Service,
apparently  a para-military organisation dealing with feeding
and keeping  under control  the vast number  of unemployed on
his planet,  where he  achieved the rank of  Chief Inspector,
evidently  a fairly high rank.  ( The impression  you get  is
something on the order of an army colonel).

    As for his skills, he avers to be a skilled administrator
and competent  with communications,  driving gravity vehicles
and  security work.  He also corrects an apparent  mistake of
Khervatchkov\'s:   his  engineering experience  is limited  to
repair and maintenance of gravity vehicles. No general mecha-
nical, electronic og engineering skills.

    He is friendly but rather formal, punctillously adressing
you as Dr. Morser and Mr. Spear respectively, and he obvious-
ly prefer  to be adressed as Captain.  The only time when his
reserve drops from him  is when you discuss the ringworld and
the task ahead of you. Then he becomes positively ebulient.

Dave moseys over to Iadlvref and Dr. Werner.  "Hiya, I\'m Dave Sokuku,
call me \'Dave\'.  What are your specialties?  I\'m into covert
investigation.  What kind of gear do you think we should request?"




**********************************

Etienne approaches the other members of the Transport team.  He is
dressed in a one-piece flight suit with many pockets.  The rank and
squadron insignia have been removed, but there are several mission
patches still on the suit.  Most of them can be recognized by most
sapients as being major battles that  were fought by the Imperium in
recent years.  Etienne is a little over 6ft and about 165lbs. [sorry, I
will convert to metric next time :(]  He has hair that used to be brown
but has been bleached by the sun, he also has a very dark tan.  He wears
mirrored sunglasses often, even indoors.  There is an empty blade sheath
at his right hip.

	Bonjour, as our gracious host said I\'m Etienne.  I\'m afraid
	those on high haven\'t condescended to brief me on my duties yet.
	Have any of you heard anything?  What is the Alcyon, is she just
	a transport, or is she armed?  Which one of us is the poor soul
	who gets to join the command team?  Who is navigator?

	On a lighter note would anyone like to explore this nearby city
	(assuming our watchdogs allow us to) [a small smile]?  I plan on
	enjoying myself my last night near anything civilized.   For
	those who would like to join me, Allons-y, for the rest, Abientot.  



Jaron Voga looks up as Etienne De Mer approaches. Voga is a slim, short man,
height about 175 cm, massing ~70 kg.  He also wears a flight suit, but
lacking any insignia except shoulder patches bearing the emblem of the
Imperial Interstellar Scout Service and the Exploration Branch of that
service.  Brown hair graying a little at the temples, and a "spacer\'s tan"
from the neck up, from spending enough time in a vacc suit to get one.

	Greetings, Mr. De Mer.  Most people just call me Voga.  I\'m afraid
that you know as much as I do about this expedition.  I for one look forward
to being out in space again, but being dirtside has its perks, fresh air
being one of them.  
	As for our duties, my specialization is in sensor systems.  I crewed
on a Donosev-class scout for awhile, so I hope the Alcyon is as well
equipped.  What of our fellow team members?


Nishu has just moved to stand with the other members of the Transport
team.  He wears a navy uniform of some sort:  black jacket with grey
trousers and shoulder panel.  On the breast pocket is a patch, a black  
circle with five silver stars [emblem of the Five Sisters subsector].
He has no insignia, but the uniform seems to indicate a low-ranking
officer or high-ranking rating.

Nishu himself is a large, broad-chested man.  He has brown hair, brown
eyes, and a well-kept beard.  He seems relaxed and friendly even in
this novel situation. 

	Bonjour, as our gracious host said I\'m Etienne.

"Glad to meet you," he says, extending a hand to Etienne.  "I\'m a
 new arrival of sorts myself."

        What is the Alcyon, is she just a transport, or is she armed? 

"I don\'t think we\'ve been told what sort of ship she is, yet.  I expect
 that she\'ll be at least minimally armed; these are dangerous times."

	Which one of us is the poor soul who gets to join the command team?  
	Who is navigator?

"Well, I don\'t know about the team leader, but I\'m hoping to end up as
 navigator myself.  I\'ve had experience in the navy as a navigator and
 sensorman."

	On a lighter note would anyone like to explore this nearby city
	(assuming our watchdogs allow us to) [a small smile]?  I plan on
	enjoying myself my last night near anything civilized.   For
	those who would like to join me, Allons-y, for the rest, Abientot.  

"Excellent idea!  Let\'s ask our host, shall we?"

Somewhere in here, Nishu will turn to the rest of the Transport team
 and find out what positions each is planning to fill (pilot, etc).

        I have been following the proposals to turn TML into a newsgroup.
Now I think that newsgroups are great.... except when news breaks down;
which is does around here a lot! So, currently at least I feel that the
TML should remain as a mailing list. Other issues to consider:
        Net Traffic: the number of messages going out on the list is much
less an indicator of net load than the number of recipients of the list.
If there are a large number of people scattered over a large number of
sites receiving this list than perhaps we really ought to consider the
change.
        Flaky news aside, another argument for NOT moving to news that has
already been expressed as the fact that email is less likely to be
buggered with than netnews - especially with the high and growing volume
of news these days.

Genie is liable to quote a totally outrageous price for those files. Remember,
selling *access* to them is how they make their money.

Forget 9600 bps. While I only have direct knowledge of Compuserve\'s setup, I\'m
sure GEnie will be the same. You can\'t get dialup access at rates above 2400.
You have to get a *wired connection* (ie 2 or 4 wire "leased line") to the 
nearest node, and use whatever sort of 4800 or 9600 modem they have. (I can
guarantee they aren\'t Trailblazers, HSTs, or Hayes!) And the rates for that
speed are steep. Say $48/hr for 9600?

Finally, we may have a problem with Genie\'s compilation copyright on the files.
It ain\'t legal to download a block of files and offer them to other people! We
may be able to get around this several different ways.

First: if we get permission to distribute the files from the person who wrote
them, Genie can\'t touch us. (I learrned this when CIS was cracking down on this
sort of thing).

Second: being a "limited group"(hah!) we may get away with it by not generally
distributing the files.

Third: they may never notice...

The first idea is the best. If we have permission, that\'s the end of it. The
second is pretty iffy. The third is downright dangerous!

     If they had wanted to keep their copyright intact, they shouldn\'t
have posted the information via an electronic medium.  By doing that,
they effectively place it in the public domain.  The principle is that
there\'s no possible way to control distribution, so copyright can\'t be
maintained.  For example, by posting something to USENET, you lose all
legal recourse.

     Bottom line?  There\'s nothing wrong with posting the files.  Besides,
GDW and Digest Group don\'t really have anything to worry about from us,
do they?  We\'re on *their* side, right?  :-)

     Really?  Is it that GEnie is suppying the account for free, or is C=
picking up the tab?  If the latter, then GEnie shouldn\'t care.

I do not have a table in program format, but I do have one that I developed
for AD&D, it has a weighted height table, (weighted height table?) Giving you
an average height of 5\'7". It is biased that way because I\'m 5\'6" so I 
figured, since it was my world why not. Once height has been determined then
you use the height to determine the weight. The system keeps you from getting
6\'11" 135LB characters. I once got a character that way. If you would like I can
post it or email it to you. I would have to type it in, but i am in the process
of putting my latest world on disk anyway, so i would have to do it eventually.

I also can come up with a system that uses the Traveller Strength, Dex, 
Endurance, to modify height and weight. Should be able to have something 
next week.

Greg

Uh, James?

Bad news... GEnie, like CIS is *controlled acces*. You have to sign up.
And they have to verify you. This means that the usenet analogy breaks
down. You do *not* lose your copyright by posting to CIS or GEnie, and
they can get downright nasty about it.

Several years ago CIS was cracking down on people who were downloading
all the "good" files from one of a forums data libraries and putting
them on their BBS\'s. Since I had a copyright notice on a program of
mine that was copied CIS\'s lawyers asked me if I\'d like them to sue
the BBS operator *FOR ME*! They were going after him on their own anyway.

Anybody planning on downloading those files and posting them to the
list had better read the fine print of their service agreement. I lay 
odds that itr *specifically* states that what we want to do is not
permited. If it doesn\'t say so there, the online system rules *will*
say so. And you are obligated to honor the agreement and follow the 
rules by the LEGAL CONTRACT you have entered into with them.

James, unless we get permission from GEnie or from the authors/posters
of those files, I\'d advise you to not post them until you have a talk
with Tek\'s legal department. It is concievable that they could sue
Tek since it supports the list...

Sorry to be a wet blanket. I\'d *love* to have those files. But not if it
means that we lose the list, or somebody gets nailed to the wall by Genie.

	The files on GEnie are copyright by the different authors/uploaders. 
That\'s why I didn\'t post the files on the list. Before anyone post the

     Um...  \'Fraid you do, under relatively new law (this comes from a
lawyer [not me]).  Among other things, compilation copyrights fall down
flat when it comes to electronic media.  I\'m given to understand that
compilation copyright is one of the big concepts that the information
services use.

     However, the new copyright laws don\'t really apply to contractual
obligations between service provider and client.  I have to admit that
I didn\'t even think of that.  Unfortunately, I\'ve never seen the text
of any of the contracts that the information services use (I *do* speak
legalese--you can\'t beat a system you don\'t understand).  Anybody know
what these contracts say?

     Yeah, we should be careful...wouldn\'t want to get the Little Blue
Oscilloscope Company in trouble...

I will upload the contract and mail it to anyone who wants to see it.  It
doesn\'t look good.  I don\'t do legalese, but it was pretty clear, downloads are
not copyable, so it looks like a mute point now.  I may send E.Mail to Mark
Miller (our dear author of Traveller) and see what he has to say.  I will also
find a DGP person to ask them also.

Most all of the Sector Data has Copyright(c)s attached to them.  A lot of the
other stuff does not.  Now the argument here is that the Traveller Group is a
Support center for Traveller products.  Much like Borland International is on
CIS as a service to it\'s customers, Traveller is on GEnie.  Borland uploads bud
fixes and such and makes them available to their customers free.  Microsoft
does the same.  Example, you can download printer drivers for MS-Word or you
can get a diskette from Redmon WA for $BUCKS.  In the MS case, you can\'t
redistribute it.

Now if GDW & DGP chose GEnie for this purpose, then they may be there to give
support to Traveller people world wide.  Their information may be for any owner
of Traveller and the only people who would get upset would be GE for having 50
people get (how many people are on the list anyway?) the files for the cost of
one download.

Well I tried downloading some stuff on FFW over the weekend and it was 
listed as being a binary file. Now I can\'t seem to figure out how to 
"un-binary" it. I will try some more stuff this week.

This is quite true.  In fact, I\'ve written newsgroup to mail 
gateways myself, with duplex mode :-) transmission; i.e. mail
gets posted and articles get mailed.  It is quite easy.  Would
Mr. Perkins be interested in moderating such a beast?

About those GENIE files:

Why can\'t we (as the one, the only, Traveller Mailing List) pursue some sort of
recognition from Digest Group, GDW, or both?  After all, many members of the
list have network access via job or school, and may not have dial-out access of
their own.  These folks can\'t just join a commercial network to have access to
these files.

What if we asked to be a semi-offical distribuition point for any electronic
goodies that the Traveller people might be willing to share?  The "History of
the Imperium Working Group" is a postal organization that is not owned by GDW
or Digest Group, and I assume that they are non-profit.  Why can\'t we request
access to the sort of information that (I assume) the copyright holders are
providing to HIWG?  The world-wide internet is a big place.  The TML might be
real attractive to them as an information outlet.

In return, we could certainly provide feedback and ideas on the game and the
universe, which must have some small value to GDW/DGP.

Would this be kosher, and in keeping with the TML intent?  Is it possible James?

An interesting subject came up briefly in the PBEM game currently forming
up; The question of acknowledging characters with doctorates. As I recall
from my AT (Ancient Traveller :-) ), a skill of Medic-3 was the equivalent
of an MD degree, with(I think - I don\'t have it here) skill 4 and a good
Dex to be rated as a surgeon.

Now, assuming the same goes for other skills, some sort of comparison
can be made: Level 1 ~ Some experience/undergrad work/maybe a Bachelor\'s
	     Level 2 ~ Good experience/maybe a Master\'s or eqv.
	     Level 3-4 ~ Phd or eqv.
	     Level 4+ ~ Further professional work

and of course, Level 0 ~ "Insert tab A into slot B..." :-)

Naturally, a person doesn\'t _have_ to have a degree or title for these
levels of skill. After all, Edison(I believe) never even graduated high 
school. The reason this gets to be important, is that someone with an
_exceedingly_ high level in something is _bound_ to be well-known by
other people in the field. I see nothing wrong in having characters(PC
or NPC) make a 2d or 3d check against a person\'s skill level to see
if they recognize the person in question, with appropriate modifiers
for how \'glamorous\' the person\'s background might be. For example, a
popular grav cycle racer with Grav Veh-5 would be easier to recognize 
than, say, a great bureaucrat with Admin-5.

Sudden cries of "Oh look, it\'s Motormutt! Let\'s go get his autograph!" can
make for some interesting random encounters(Hi Mike!).

This message consists of three parts, all related to the GEnie situation.
First is a reply to Greg on the file format, second is a discussion about using
TML as an offical distribution point, and third an excerpt of the GEnie
contract.

Greg,
  The files show signs that they use Apple\'s at GDW.  It was rumored to me a
while back (some of the basic programs from JTAS) that they did, this about
confirms it.  GEnie accepts two types of uploads.  The first is an ASCII 7 BIT
capture upload, the second is a 8 BIT protocol upload.  Any file, regardless of
content, uploaded with X[YZ]modem will be labled a binary file.  Next time you
are on just <L>ook at one of the files, you will see it is a readable file.

The problems that I have encountered is that when I use a protocol to download
and I have the host name file files two things happen, the GEnie file:

  TROJAN REACHES

comes out on my PC as:

  TROJAN R.EAC

(Try dealing with spaces in a file name!!!! on a PC)  Any way, the filename
indicates that they are using Apple ][\'s or some other OS that allows spaces in
the filename, such as Macintosh.  Also, the files when downloaded with protocol
are CR delimited instead of CRLF or LF or what ever.  What this means, is a 6
line C program to add the LF\'s to the file to make Misery-DOS happy (and
conversly a clean upload to Unix).

*** 2 ***

In one of the TML messages that came through today (Sorry, but I deleted it
after reading it though I should have saved it for this reply) suggested
contacting GDW/DPG/HIWG to get them to use us as an outlet.  This has merit but
there are also some problems.  First, GDW is Bloomington IL.  I don\'t know
where this is, but I would guess that they are long distance to a Usenet site.
Also if they do use Apples, then getting UUCP software for them may be
difficult.  However if GEnie has a node near them, then they may be able to
Starlink or PC Pursit to somewhere.

Some of the benifits to them are:
  1) Dedicated Players/Play testers
  2) Limited yet unlimited distribution (Limited because there aren\'t thousands
     of us, but unlimited because any one can sign up and the distribution is
     wide)
  3) Ease of communications to out of town people.

Now we need a liason to go between GDW and TML.  We also will need some facts
about us, a marketer per se.  We need a spokesman who knows this list well and
can sell them on us.  Still if we get them, we need to have a distrubution plan
other than just mailing to everone on the list.  I recommend setting up a mail
file server (since not every one can dialup UUCP or FTP) where files and
indeices can be requested.  Volunteers?

I personally believe that a gateway agreement with the DGP is much more
useful than with the GDW.
GDW seems to have more or less pulled out of the MegaT business to concentrate
on 2300AD, Twilight and that Jules Verne animal. 

Anyone with inside contacts who volunteers to ask?

The JTAS once published (this was during their Challenge period) a extended 
scientist generation system (ala Mercenary). In this system there were provisions
for College as well as Graduate school (both takes 4 years).

The bureaucrat with Admin-5+ would probably be quite infamous:
"Golly! It\'s the Red Tape Menace of the Galaxy. Run awaaaaaay!!!" :-)

By the way, What is average level of skills in Traveller. 1? 2? 3?!
(High Guard lists 2 as "standard")

Anyone with Mathematics-4+ who can make an estimate based on the character
generation system?

And answer the essential question:
"How many sentinents with Pilot-7 is there in the Marches, statistically?" :-)

	Well maybe not as exciting as exploring a ringworld but
	a lot less time consuming. Anyone who has tried the same stunt
	on a European Inter-Rail ticket will sympathise.

	This is mainly a one-to-one (player to ref) game but if people\'s

In both the old system, where skills directly affected die rolls, 
and in the new task system, where skills and combinations of skills
have even stronger effects, it is vital to control TIGHTLY the number
and level of skills available to the character. This is done only
to a limited extent in the rules (INT+EDU=MAX), so I have deivsed 
some rules of thumb for estimating what a given level of skill or
EDU might be. These are based on estimates against the propogation
of knowledge or skill in a given population; I do not claim that
they are substantive in any way. I *do*, however, claim that in
the games I\'ve run, they work and work well.

Level 0: The character has been familiarized with the ideas, rules, and
equipment of the skill involved. He can make estimates based on his 
limited ability, and operate devices without fear of doing something 
obviously stupid. Note that a temporary Level 0 and a permanent Level 0
require different amounts of time, to turn the skills from liquid into 
crystal memory; they do not involve different techniques or training.
EXAMPLES: Learning in an afternoon to clean, fire, and safely handle 
a pistol would convey a Handgun -0; practicing this regularly until
one no longer needed to "think" about it would make the skill permanent.
Learning to work the gears and steering wheel could give a Wheeled
Vehicle 0, unless one also required safe and legal driving.

Level 1: This is "trainee" level; the character has had formal instruction
(either supervised or not) in the skill, and has a basic set of ideas
and tools with which to work at all times; enough, in fact, so that he 
is more likely to do a difficult task successfully than someone who merely
"knows which buttons to push". EXAMPLES: Driving an auto after having
been taught, and practiced for a few months to a year. Firing a handgun
every few days for an hour or two, with an emphasis on smooth motion
and marksmanship.

Level 2: This is "`qualified" level, or "journeyman/apprentice" level,
depending on the skill type. The character is proficient at what he does,
and operates unsupervised for most tasks without difficulty; however,
he may require the advice or training of one more skilled than he when
an unusual or dangerous situation arises. EXAMPLE: An Engineer-2 would
be qualified to run the engines of a small merchant with no trouble,
but might serve under an Engineer-3 or 4 on a Navy battlecruiser.

Level 3: I view this as above the median, well above in the case of
skills that aren\'t normally "studied" by people at large. The Level 3
indicates a "profession," a full course ofd study and certification
that amply prepares the characters for most eventualities. Hence, a
four-year stint in med school produces Medical-3 (an MD), and a
character with any Ship skill of 3 could be hired as a watch commander
in any station.

Actually they use Mac\'s.   I had a telephone conversation with Marc Miller some
years ago at GDW when I was discussing with him the possibility of writing some
stuff for the Commodore 64 computer (which was my programming "axe" in those 
days) and he said that GDW was only interested in stuff for the Macintosh.

Oops. Sorry. As I was saying....

Level 4: The Level 4 individual is a consummate professional at what
he does, an "expert." In any normal situation, he will be the best
qualified to take commands of a situation requiring his skills; in 
areas where he would work alone, he would work swiftly, accurately,
and with flair. The "motormutt" mentioned by Craig in a recent post
is a member of my GenCon Traveller party, Near Miss. He\'s a Level 4
in Grav Vehicle/Combat Driver, making him essentially unstoppable by
conventional means. Remember the task system; difficult becomes routine.
A character with Level 4 would be well-known by afficionadoes of his skill; 
he might have anything from a small local notoriety to real fame.

Levels 5-6: At this point we leave the realm of practical role-playing
and enter the realm of fantasy. The character with a level above 4 is
an artist. He devotes his life to honing and perfecting his art, and often
excludes all else in his pursuit. A level 6 in something in my campign
was often a hindrance; it prevented depth. Nobody has ever been allowed
a skill beyond 6 in one of my games, and the only character with a 6
said it ruined his character\'s life as an obsession. Examples here
would be a Baryshnikov, a Picasso, a Bo Jackson, or in S terms a Kim
Kinnison or a Kenobi. The LOevel 6 is famous, instantly recognized,
and legendary.

So to answer your question, Bertil; there are no Pilot-7s. The skill
has no meaning at that level. The top aces of the FFW only had Pilot-3 or 4;
no test pilot would have beyond a 5 before his other vital skills would
be afected adversely.

Think of skill acquisition as exponential rather than linear; it makes
sense in the l;ong run. As for education, this is stickier; I usually
account for high EDU with training courses and dcustom learning ; a
Bachelors is an 11 or 12, a Mater\'s a 13, a PhD a 15. Note that this is
different from an MD program, where a student has a fixed, measureable
amount of time and number of courses to earn his degree.Some PhDs  take
three years, others take six.

Feedback s welcome; please forgicvve typos, I\'m using a crude editor
just now and I\'m in a tearing big hurry.

GDW in Bloomington might be all of three miles away from a usenet
site.  Possibly four.  If they\'re running macs, UUPC is easily
available.  I doubt that they are still running apple ][s.


On a related note, I think the idea of convincing Genie to love
us is, at best, amusing - we can show GDW an enthusiastic bunch
of customers.  We can show Genie a copyright nightmare.  Which
do YOU think is more likely to be friendly?

	No no no, after lots of complaining, GDW is now doing a lot wi{h 
MegaTraveller. They have novels base on MegaTraveller background in the work,
a IBM MegaTraveller Game in the work, two new products for MegaTraveller 
in the work, one of which is the "Imperium Fighting Ship." The new issue of
Challenge also has a lot of articles on Traveller this time. 

	On the side note, Alien Source Book Vol 1 will be released at the
end of March from DGP. I believe the script has been sent to the printer 
already. More on this later. World Builder Program and the 2nd Survey Data
are next on the list for debut. As far as those sector data on GEnie,
they are useless, because a lot of it will be changed in 2nd survey.

What follows is purely circumstantial evidence and hearsay:

When Traveller 2300 was introduced there was an interview with Mark W Miller
in the Digest, where he said that T2300 was the next step after Traveller, and
that Traveller was good when it was introduced (ie 70\'s sometime) but that it
now were obsolete.

All the old supplements went out of print *before* there were any definite talk
about MegaT.

JTAS died the silent death and became a part of Challenge (a shrinking part).

Folks I know in the games-shop business claimed that GDW had dropped Traveller.

In several places (among others TD18 Q&A) it says that DGP wrote the scripts
for (parts of, and maybe the whole layout) the MegaT books.

My games-shop source has confirmed this.

It is DGP that runs the GEnie (?) Traveller area. (i think)

GDW\'s release schedule for first quarter 90 has only one (1) MegaT item in it, 
according to "Hobbyhuset" (Importer of GDW stuff in Sweden).

DGP seems to have lots of stuff planned for release soon (MT Aliens Vol1 etc)

My interpretation of this is that GDW was going to scrap Traveller in favour
of Traveller 2300, but Traveller:2300 flopped, (Old Traveller\'s didn\'t like it:
"WHAT? no Vilani on Barnard\'s?? No Jumpdrive???" and new customers thought it
was just "old" traveller in a new dress because of the name).
So GDW changed it\'s name from Traveller:2300 to 2300AD and DGP stepped in
to take responsibility for Traveller. The transition was marked by the 
publishing of MegaTraveller, where all the DGP rules improvements (like tasks)
was incorporated in the core rules.
Some things are still published by the GDW for MegaT but the bulk of the work
seems to lay on DGP.

And the MCr10 question is:
Was this good or bad?

I think it was good. When GDW didn\'t have the time and/or interest to
modernize traveller they had the decency to let the people who had time and
interest do it. I can think of a lot of RPG-companies that never would have
done that. (TSR as an infamous example)
DGP is also smaller than GDW and is more specialized for MegaT. This means that
they are more attentive to customer feedback and opinions.

> Maybe getting permission for creating player aids for Traveller isn\'t going 
> to be so hard after all... <smirk>

I don\'t know. But since we almost exclusively discuss traveller here on the TML,
I think that DGP is the ones to approach, not GDW, with the question about a
feed to GEnie.

In the choise between a GEnie feed and an Newsgroup-TML feed I vote for the 
GEnie feed. TML is a semi-closed/open group in which datafiles etc. has an 
controlled propagation. The same file in News is all over the world in less than
a day, totally without control.
There is now way that anyone is going to allow a GEnie<->TML feed if TML 
has a feed to News.
 
Disclaimer: I have no connections with DGP or GDW. everything above is hearsay.

I\'ve got access to a macintosh and the standard macintosh compression programs
and chalmers has a direct net-mac link. I am willing to offer my help.
(If the files mentions "binhex4.0" or "stuffit" or "packit" they are definately
packed on a mackintosh)

That should read levels in the subject line.  Too bad I type faster than
I proofread.

The way I run it is as follows:

+0 = basic level of training (it takes only two months to learn certain
skills at +0).  You can handle basic tasks without screwing up, most of the
time, and more advanced tasks with difficulty, but with less trouble than
someone non-skilled.

+1 = basic level, and then some.  Normal, but above average.

+2 = basic expert level.  A professional.  Someone who could do this for
a living and probably never do anything that would get them fired, or killed.

+3 = above average expert.  A whiz kid.  Really good.  (For most skills, 
you cannot screw up unless you roll snake eyes twice in a row; basic success
is 5+ or about 85% of the time for anything that might be more than routine,
with the exception of particularly difficult tasks, like head shots.)

+4 = outlandishly good.

+5 = like +4, but more so.  In general, skill levels above +5 have 
"diminishing returns effects" since they are usually automatic successes,
or the roll is so hard that you need something insane like +19 to succeed
anyway.  (It is possible to get skill levels that high in my game, but
usually, if you try, "something terrible happens to you."  Of course, I
warn my players in advance that if they take advantage of loopholes in
my game system, I will simply respond by sending NPCs after them who are
just as good--I won\'t even have to cheat, all I have to do is make them
face off against someone who is their equal or better.  They understand,
and keep their characters realistic.

Of course, if someone wants one or two skills to be a "comsuming passion"
and get a +10 in it, I don\'t mind, because it does not unbalance the game 
when it is only one or two skills.  My friend Tim runs a character with
Class II (Rifle) at +11, and since he is using a custom-built, smart system
w. biocontrol interface laser rifle, and augmenting his own knowledge of
rifle skill with a memory-recording skill chip, he ends up with a +15 or
+16 (I can\'t remember which).  Of course, he skill has to roll for 
initiate in any gunfight, and his Dex. is only about a 9.  He can hit
anything he shoots at...hold on, I just read what I typed, let me correct
what I said..."he still has to roll for initiative" (sorry kids, it\'s
late)...but he knows that every gunfight involves an initiative roll,
and if someone gets the draw on him, he\'s dead.  The result: he plays his
character smart and never shoots unless he has to, and then he makes sure
he gets the drop on his opponents!

Take care all.

  Mark

In that case, three loud cheers for the ones who coerced GDW.

But the question still is: Why did GDW almost pull traveller?

Could someone please post the phone number for GDW\'s offices? If no one
else is going to contact them on behalf of the TML, I may as well.

Also, whoever it was that posted the note about Traveller novels in the works,
please contact me and let me know from whom at GDW you heard this. I\'d
been told they weren\'t going to do any, and I need to get my manuscript
back to them pronto. Argh.

This question involves GURPS Space and MegaTraveller.

One thing that I like about the task system is that the level
of difficulty for various tasks uses words from the English 
language.  In GURPS, you generally assign a penalty for very
difficult tasks which is subtracted from skill.  I\'ve seen
GM\'s assign as much as a -12 penalty to perform a task that
I didn\'t think was impossible.

I was thinking about trying to use the MT difficulty levels
since saying that a task is "formidable" is more descriptive
than saying its a -5 feat.  Can anyone advise me as to what
is reasonable?  And BTW, are there guidelines concerning when
to assign a "difficult" instead of a "formidable" roll or 
a "simple" versus "routine?"

I was thinking of something like this:

Simple:     skill + 2
Routine:    skill
Difficult:  skill - 3
Formidable: skill - 6
Impossible: skill - 12

In GURPS, you roll three 6 sided dice for an average roll of 10.5 .
It just so happens that a novice in a certain skill will have a 
skill of 10 or 11 and will therefore succeed with a routine task
about 50% of the time.  A reasonably experienced operator will
usually have a skill of about 13 (maybe level 1 or 2 in traveller)
and succeed in a routine task around 60-70% of the time.  So, how
often should this reasonably experienced operator succeed if the 
task is simple, difficult, formidable or impossible?

*| What follows is purely circumstantial evidence and hearsay:
*| When Traveller 2300 was introduced there was an interview with Mark W Miller

El-yuccckkko!

*| in the Digest, where he said that T2300 was the next step after Traveller, and
*| that Traveller was good when it was introduced (ie 70\'s sometime) but that it
*| now were obsolete.
*| All the old supplements went out of print *before* there were any definite talk
*| about MegaT.
*| JTAS died the silent death and became a part of Challenge (a shrinking part).

And I LIKED that format MUCH better than Challenges... <sigh>

*| Folks I know in the games-shop business claimed that GDW had dropped Traveller.

That prompted me to make a phone call to GDW to find out what in tarnation was
going on.   Marc Miller said to me at that time "Old traveller is out and 
Mega Traveller is the way to go..".

*| I think it was good. When GDW didn\'t have the time and/or interest to
*| modernize traveller they had the decency to let the people who had time and
*| interest do it. I can think of a lot of RPG-companies that never would have
*| done that. (TSR as an infamous example)
*| DGP is also smaller than GDW and is more specialized for MegaT. This means that
*| they are more attentive to customer feedback and opinions.

I know the case of TSR well...  I personally knew Gary Gygax and didn\'t like 
what I saw in his personality as it evolved over the years.   As a result 
I now have NOTHING to do with D&D.   I even gave away all my books (an 
extensive collection) and washed my hands of the whole thing.

Well, I must say that before Bart even sent out his suggestion about
newsifying the mailing list, I had just received a fresh piece of mail
from Gene Spafford (net god) about this very topic.  I explained the
list statistics to him and he agreed that I COULD turn the list into a
newsgroup.  Imagine how pleased I was that the TML decided to
spontaneously discuss the issue right when I was stewing over it!

Well, I really appreciate all of your thoughts on the matter.  While I
can still do it I will continue to adminster the list in its current
form.  I must say I am not too fond of the idea of opening the list to
be seen by all of usenet while I still moderate it, so I will keep away
from that for now.

Hopefully this list will not disappear in the next week.  My division
has a pending layoff and I\'m sure I am not totally safe from the
probability of being laid off.  Wish me luck folks!

I would like to find a volunteer to track down this issue (since my time

level-headedly track down this issue, please send me a piece of mail.
I\'d like you to indicate your approach to safely copying and
distributing the Genie files, without copyright infringements, ruffled
feathers or any recourse to Tektronix or the TML.  In your "application"
please clearly explain in full paragraphs:

1. Why do you feel you are well-suited to this task?

2. What are all the possible ways you can see to get the files from
Genie, both scrupulous and unscrupulous?

3. What are all the Pros and Cons of the above methods?

4. Which do you forsee as the best method, and why?

5. What contacts will you need to make?

6. What will you do to insure the leaglity of the distribution of these
materials?

If I cannot get someone I can trust to track down these issues, I cannot
allow the downloads to be distributed on the list, as I cannot take the
time right now to figure out all the repercussions myself....

Gary Thomas of Digest Group is a "close personal friend" of mine.  I just
asked him for permission to copy the GEnie files and he said:

  "You have my permission to download any GEnie DGP stuff and mail it to the

So we have the green light from DIGEST GROUP.  Does anyone have contacts

	The answer to that one, is easy. They didn\'t. GDW is not a big company.
They have limited resources. Last year, they introduced too many new games
into the market(my opinion only). Just look, there is Space 1889, 2300 AD
the revision, MegaTraveller, etc. So, they had to allocate the resources.
Since at the time, DGP was doing a lot of MegaTraveller, and still is. GDW moves
most of its resources into Space 1889, and Twlight 2000. They didn\'t totally
give up on MegaTraveller or 2300 AD either. They put out Referee\'s Companion,
Rebellion Source Book, and COACC for MegaTraveller, two new adventures
plus Earth and Cybertech source book for 2300 AD. As far as Challenge goes,
the reason they didn\'t put much of the articles on there is because they 
don\'t get much submission on MegaTraveller. It\'s hard to publish something
which you don\'t have, as Lorren Wiseman said. But it\'s getting better.

This one ought to draw some interesting comments.

I\'m about to start up my traveller game with all-new PC\'s that my players
just generated.  Out of the entire group, two of the PC\'s have starships
(a class-S for the retired scout PC, and a Far Trader for the retired
merchant PC).  Now this is where it gets interesting.

The scout PC is assumed to have his ship as a loan of indefinite duration,
but the merchant PC is assumed to have acquired his via purchase or some-
such (the rules are not specific about this).  However, the rules DO say
that he also acquired a 40-year mortgage to go along with the ship.  They
do not go into detail about how this should be managed.

Let us assume that the merchant acquired a USED Far Trader (list price:
MCr. 41.07) and that after initial depreciation and down-payment, that
he is left with MCr. 20.535 (50% of the original price) to amortize over
a 40 year period.  I also assume quarterly, rather then monthly, payments
(since being in a position to drop off a check at the mortgage-holding
financial institution on a monthly basis may be difficult for a ship
that could be anywhere within a 50-or-so parsec radius).

Given these assumptions, let\'s used the information from "Starship
Purchase" (pg. 89, MT Imperial Encyclopedia) to generate an amortized
loan payment schedule and see what happens.

After all of the numbers given, the book says that the final cost to the
new ship owner (principal and interest) should be 220% of the original
purchase price.  For the used starship (above), that would be MCr. 45.177.
Reverse calculation of a 40-year amortized loan with that amount as the
ultimate total gives us an interest rate of 4.63%.  The quarterly payment
turns out to be Cr. 282,496.92 (every 3 months).  This is a lot of cash!

If we assume that this is reasonably accurate, then the question is: Can
the PC actually expect to generate enough income to make the payments and
still have enough left over to live on?  Notice that we haven\'t even touched
on the issues of crew salaries, annual maintenance costs, fuel, and general
upkeep.  These will be considered later.

According to specs. in "Supplement 7: Traders and Gunboats", the ship can
carry 7 High/Mid passengers, 4 in Low Passage, and 46 tons of freight.  If
we assume best case (7 High Psg, 4 Low Psg, and full cargo hold) then we
have Cr. 10,000 x 7, Cr. 1,000 x 4, and Cr. 1,000 x 46.  This represents
a potential maximum of Cr. 120,000 per week.  So assuming this PC is Super-
Trader, and could accomplish this week after week, we have a revenue
potential of MCr. 1.44 per quarter, before expenses, and not considering
port time for freight transfer, refueling, etc.  After deducting the
quarterly mortgage payment, we\'re left with MCr. ~1.158, before expenses,
as profit.  So much for best case.

Now, let\'s try something more realistic.  Assume 50% of the time is spend
in port, refueling, haggling for freight and passengers, etc.  Further
assume that, on average, the ship is only operating at have capacity for
cargo and passagers.  This reduces the gross quarterly income to Cr. 360,000
(again, before expenses).  Deduct the quarterly mortgage payment, and we\'re
left with Cr. 77,503.08 to cover 3 months worth of expenses.

Now, let\'s look at what it costs to run this starship.

First, there\'s fuel.  In 12 weeks, this ship will jump 6 times and burn
45 days worth of maneuver and powerplant fuel (based on the 50% active
assumption).  The ship has a jump-2 drive but we\'ll assume that only 1/3
of the jumps are jump-2; the other 2/3 are jump-1.  This means that total
fuel consumption for 4 jump-1 and 2 jump-2 trips (based on ship design
from MT Referee\'s Manual) is 1,620 kliters, at Cr. 35/kl., works out to
cost of Cr. 56,700.  For the powerplant, which uses (1.107 kl./hr. x 24 hrs.
x 45 days x Cr. 35/kl.), we have a total maneuver & powerplant fuel cost of
Cr. 41,844.60.  Add these two together, and we get a total quarterly cost
of Cr. 98,544.60.  Oops!  We\'ve already exceeding our available cash!
Therefore, the ship must rely, at least partially, on refuelling from
natural sources (gas-giants or water-worlds).  Let\'s assume 50% of the
fuel is acquired this way.  Now, our quarterly fuel bill drops down to
Cr. 49,272.30.  Let\'s hope the ship doesn\'t wear out prematurely from all
of that atmosphere skimming :-).

Next, we have life support for 3 crew members, 1/2 of 7 High/Mid passengers,
and 1/2 of 4 Low passengers (we will assume for the sake of the merchants
wallet that none of the freight requires life support).  The Imperial
Encyclopedia says that each stateroom requires Cr. 2000 of support per
2 week trip, and each Low berth requires Cr. 100 per usage.  If we assume
that the crew-members consume life support equal to 1 Mid psg. passenger,
(say, 80% of 1 High psg. passenger), then for each 1-way trip we use
(High Psg=Cr. 2000 x 0.5 x 3.5) + (Mid Psg= Cr. 1600 x 0.5 x 1.5) + (Low
Psg= Cr. 100 x 2) for a total of Cr. 4,900.  We assume no LS is used while
a ship is in port.

Then there are crew salaries to worry about.  For a Far Trader, the crew
consists of 1 Bridge crew-member (Pilot), 1 Engineer, and 1 Medic/Steward.
If we assume that the pilot is the owner, then we must only pay the Engineer
and the Steward.  Given the "skill levels" recently posted by METLAY (which
are pretty good definitions, IMHO), the Engineer and Steward are probably
both level-2 for purposes of salary determination.  For these levels (and
assuming the Engineer achieved O-3 in the Merchants), the salaries should
be Cr. 1950/mo. for the Engineer and Cr. 1000/mo. for the Steward.  Quarterly,
this would be Cr. 8,850.

The annual maintenance fee cannot be avoided, if the ship is to keep flying.
This amounts to 0.1% of the cash price of the ship annually (Cr. 20,535,
in this case), which works out to Cr. 5,133.75 per quarter.

Finally, we have berthing costs.  This includes landing fees, handling costs,
facilities use charges, and other miscellaneous starport expenses.  The
average cost is Cr. 100 for the first 6 days in port, plus Cr. 100 for each
additional day beyond 6.  If we assume that the ship is in port 50% of the
time, the we have 6 weeks at Cr. 200/week, or Cr. 1,200.

So, the bottom line is Cr. 49,272.30 for fuel, Cr. 4,900 for Life Support,
8,850 in salaries, and Cr. 1,200 in berthing fees, which works out to a
total of Cr. 64,222.30.  Out of Cr. 77,503.08, we are left with Cr. 13,280.78
for quarterly profit, or Cr. 53,123.12 per year.

Before taxes, but that\'s another story.

	Ok, so we have DGP\'s permission. But there is a problem, most of the
stuff on there are not from DGP, but from writers that\'s on GEnie. For those
files, you\'d have to ask them as well. Since DGP can\'t act on behave of them.

Greetings,
  I am pleased at the various discussions no this mailing list, and I hope
you can help me.  How do you handle characters who are in the water ?
There is no swimming skill, or snorkelling skill ?  I had a group of
mercenaries attack a shore line installation (radar tracking) in advance
of an invasion.  They parachuted into the water and SCUBA dove to the radar.
I used STR, DEX,& END but is there a better way to handle this situation.

Thanx in advance,

Greg Hara asks if there is a better way to handle scuba diving and such.

I don\'t know if my suggestions will be of any help or not, but, I seem to
recall something in the Double Adventure Night of Conquest about swimming,
and also in two JTAS issues.  One was an Amber Zone (It was also in the
Best of JTAS 1) and also the issue(around 23 I think) that gave suggestions
and equipment for use in Striker.  Maby that could help.

Tis the best I can give ya....

I\'ve also got a mac and am willing to help (may be a little far to send

I\'m also will to write programs for the mac (with interface etc). If the

If the file ends with a \'hqx\', \'.sit\' or a \'.pit\' then the file is
likely to be binhex/stuffit/packit format respectively.  If it isn\'t one
of them it still might be MacBinary format (which used to be a kind of

Oops!  I left out the annual maintenance fee!  That was calculated as...

>This amounts to 0.1% of the cash price of the ship annually (Cr. 20,535,

So, the actual total is Cr. 69,356.05.  This leaves (77,503.08 - 69,356.05)
or Cr. 8,147.03 net profit per quarter.

But, wait!  Perhaps I\'m too generous with the annual maintenance fee.
Afterall, as a car gets older, it\'s maintenance costs go up, not down.
Why not assume the same for a starship?  Lets just use the original price
as a calculation base, instead of half the original price.  This would
double the amount shown above (Cr. 10,267.50, instead of Cr. 5,133.75),
so by subtracting the second half (Cr. 5,133.75) for the net, we get
an actual net profit of Cr. 3,013.28 per quarter.  Again, before taxes.
I don\'t know about you, but Cr. 1,004.43 per month sounds kinda\' slim
to me.

Greg:

One big plus of the Traveller skill system, expanded upon by the
MegaT task system, is that the skill choice is open-ended. If you
need a SCUBA skill, make it up. Add appropriate tasks, and you\'re
set! I think the real problem is that there\'s no way for characters
to have such skills in retrospect, but that can be fudged if you\'re
clever.

In this tome I beat the `level 7\' horse completely to death.
I look at it from a bunch of different angles to come up with what
we, as ref\'s and players, already knew:

	Level 7 skills are hard to get, but not impossible.
	And of course it costs the character something to get there.



In the process, I got some insight into levels, probabilities,
sector population, character generation, and task difficulty.

Now that you\'ve all been thoroughly warned, if you want to hear my
answer to Bertil\'s question about how may Pilot-7 folks are in the
Marches, read on. 

(sorry this is so long)
	Richard Johnson

===========================================================
Part 1: Tasks and Probability:

I made up this nifty little table to show me how easy it really is
to achieve certain tasks:

#	likelihood	 +1		+2		+3		+4		+5		+6		+7

3+	35/36		always	*		*		*		*		*		*
4+	33/36		35/36	always	*		*		*		*		*
5+	30/36		33/36	35/36	always	*		*		*		*
6+	26/36		30/36	33/36	35/36	always	*		*		*
7+	21/36		26/36	30/36	33/36	35/36	always	*		*
8+	15/36		21/36	26/36	30/36	33/36	35/36	always	*
9+	11/36		15/36	21/36	26/36	30/36	33/36	35/36	*
10+	 6/36		11/36	15/36	21/36	26/36	30/36	33/36	35/
11+  3/36		 6/36	11/36	15/36	21/36	26/36	30/36	33/
12+  1/36		 3/36	 6/36	11/36	15/36	21/36	26/36	30/
13+	----			 1/36	 3/36	 6/36	11/36	15/36	21/36	26/
14+	----			----		 1/36	 3/36	 6/36	11/36	15/36	21/
15+ ----			----		----		 1/36	 3/36	 6/36	11/36	15/
16+ ----			----		----		----		 1/36	 3/36	 6/36	11/
17+ ----			----		----		----		----		 1/36	 3/36	 6/
18+ ----			----		----		----		----		----		 1/36	 3/
19+ ----			----		----		----		----		----		----		 1/

Note that this chart leaves out one important item: the 1/36 chance
that you will get a critical bumble. (oops, `funble\' :-)
									 (aargh, I did it again!)

MT Task levels (fer reference an\' those who don\'t know yet):

	Simple ==  3+  --> 35 in 36 you succeed (with minimal skill)
   Routine ==  7+  --> 7 in 12 you succeed with minimal skill
 Difficult == 11+  --> 1 in 12 you succeed with minimal skill
Formidable == 15+  --> don\'t try this at home, kids!
Impossible == 19+  --> only genius nerds need apply

This told me that there probably IS the rare, gifted, and neurotic
individual who can dream the impossible dream (level 7) and out of
those a select handful you hear about (like Nobel laureates) - the
one who rolled 12 at the right moment after years of training.

Unfortunately, this table doesn\'t really talk about acquiring
skills, only using them.  For a level 7, the formidable is *almost*
routine, but the impossible is still nearly impossible.  The way
this character operates makes the typical work assignment look
trivial - and to this person it is.

So this told me that level 7 is at least reasonable in game terms.
It does not violate any obvious game balance considerations but does
stretch them a bit.  I had to look elsewhere for skill aquisition
information.


===================================================

Part 2: How long does it take to get level 7?

How much effort is required to get that much skill?  Well, aside
from forgetting about level 1 and 2 in about three other fields (in
our world quite an accomplishment in itself!) because of the maximum
levels rule (not > int + ed)...

How \'bout the AT rules? (not in original Traveller - AT\'s allow
characters to `get credit\' for self-study and for experience.)  You
roll at the *beginning* of the adventure:

	to add a level roll = difficult (11+)
		DM\'s = + int/5, #of AT in that skill
		   - level of skill attempted

	No more than 2 AT/year are allowed.

Let\'s say you got pilot 3 in flight school and you\'re now 22.
Further, let\'s say you choose to ignore other important fields so
you can become a starship test pilot.  And lets also say you ALWAYS
roll 10+ (not too likely, but this IS a fantasy :-).  Finally, let\'s
suppose your INT is 15.  

Year 1: +2 AT, +3 INT, -4 level = +1 DM  you roll 10+  for Pilot 4
Year 2: +2 AT, +3 INT, -5 level = 0 DM you roll 10 no skill
Year 2.5: +3 AT, +3 INT, -5 level = +1 DM you roll 10 for Pilot 5
year 3: +1 AT, +3 INT, -6 level = -2 DM you don\'t even try...
year 4: +3 AT, +3 INT, -6 level = +1 DM gets you Pilot 6
year 5: +2 AT, +3 INT, -7 level = -2 DM you don\'t try now either
year 6: +4 AT, +3 INT, -7 level = 0 DM 10\'s not enough
year 7: +6 AT, +3 INT, -7 level = +2 DM gets you Pilot 7

REMEMBER: this seven-year plan is for the incredibly gifted and
supremely lucky (1/12 chance at rolling a 10+).  The `average\'
character will take, just on rolls, seven times this long to get
there == 50+ years!  (Your mileage may vary, depending on how often,
game time, each adventure takes.)


Let\'s look at this another way.  It takes roughly 3 months to get a
level 0 skill.  If you double the time for each augmented level, it
will take 6 more months to get level 1 (9 months total).  It will
take:

	1 year	level 2		(~2 yr total)
	2 year	level 3		(~4 yr total)
	4 year 	level 4		(~8 yr total)
	8 year	level 5		(~16 yr total)
	16 year level 6		(~32 yr total)
	32 year level 7		(~64 yr total)

Which actually agrees pretty closely with the figures I got from
using the AT method.

Again, just on time, it doesn\'t seem that level 7 is inordinate.
Really hard to get, and costly in terms of a social life and other
(probably needed) skills, but not out of line.

So finally, I asked myself "How probable is it that someone *would*
have a level-7 skill?"

===========================================================

Part 3: Enormous numbers:

I said to myself: "strictly by chance, how likely is it that someone
will have a skill level-1?"  There\'s about 160 skills listed (if
memory serves me), and and `average\' character will have 20 levels
(10 INT + 10 ED).  {Yes, you\'re right - I picked these numbers to
make things easy...}  Thus there\'s a 1 in 8 chance of a particular
character having a particular skill.  I used this value as a base.

This is not good procedure for a number of reasons, but I simply
extrapolated the 1/8 chance to the seventh power.  This says that
roughly 1 in 2.4 million folks have a level 7 is something.  This
"feels right" to me, looking out at our wonderful world.

Since characters are usually outstanding in some respect (or they
wouldn\'t be much fun to play), I don\'t feel that it\'s terribly out
of line for a character to devote his/her/its time and energy to
being a `nerd\' for that one shot at glory.  Characters like this can
pretty much write their own ticket, and they do.  But they pay for
the ticket with years of antisocial behavior.

==================================================

Part 4:  Finally an answer...

OK.  Now I can answer Bertil\'s question: `how many pilot-7 folks are
there in (some region of space)?\'  A LOT!  Just try to find them,
though.  

If there\'s ~10^13 people in a sector, even extremely low probability
events are numerous.  Since the probability of level 7 is about 
1 in 5*10^6 (I halved it, since characters are `great\' people anyway) 
and the population is 10^13, we can guess that there\'s a couple of
million level-7 somethings hanging around the Spinward Marches, more
close to Capital.

Since he specifically asked about *pilot-7*, I\'ll divide by my
infamous 160 skills and guess that the Marches have 12,500
pilot-7\'s.  (and 12,500 equestrian-7\'s, and 12,500 etc.)

========================================================

Just to stop the question before it gets asked:

there\'s probably about 1,000 pilot 8\'s  IF they lived long enough
and about 100 pilot 9\'s.  It\'d take over 100 years to get to 8 and
over 250 to get to 9 though...

If you account for consistently lucky rolls and for age, 
there\'s probably 50 pilot-8\'s in the Marches and probably 50 
pilot 9\'s in all known space who are actually young enough to fly.

I actually did finally guess on this last - the likelihoods are
really extreme and the batteries on my TL7 hand comp died!

If you\'ve read this far, you\'re more serious about MT than I
thought!  :-)  Have good day.

In one campaign, some unscrupulous starliner operators were accused of
feeding passengers watered-down "fast" drug. This slows the passengers
metabolic rate, cutting down on life support and food cost. Not a big
factor for the Trader example, but if running the Spinward Marches 
Love Boat is your business...  Not advisable to feed your crew the
same, if you want good reaction time. :-)

Well, I was working on my NPC generator (this one\'s in ANSI C) earlier this
week, tracking down some bugs, when I happened to re-read the example character
they give.  Basically this character is a merchant with 5 terms.  The
problem involves mustering out benifit rolls.

In the example, and in the rules in the text describing how to, they use
a base of one roll per full term served.  However, in the tables giving
details about each service, the left sidebar contains a note about figuring
mustering out benifits stating that it\'s two rolls per term.  Going on an
assumption that the rules and example are correct, I have used the one roll
per term rule.

What this also means is that the characters created for my campaign were
generated wrong, as we did not read the rules as we went but simply followed
the (erronous) tables.

Oh, and about the NPC generator, it creates characters in the same format
found on the last page of the basic character generation system.  It starts
out by rolling the characters stats, then the homeworld (in the shortened
format given earlier in the book).  It then picks a target number of terms
to serve (2d3) and attempts to serve them out.  It ignores the question of
anagathics, as I feel that\'s a real tough question for a human to decide,
let alone coming up with a simple set of guidelines for the computer.  It
correctly handles belters, bureaucrats, and nobles (notable exceptions to
the smooth flow of character generation).  It also handles cascades, items
and stat modifications.  It has a verbose mode were it describes the actions

It also ranks the services by enlistment throw dms, and chooses from
among the highest.  I\'ll let you folks know when it\'s ready.  The only
porting problem will be to non-ANSI compilers, as I\'ve used both the
stringize(#) and token pasting(##) abilities.  Saved typing.  I\'ll remove
these things on my last pass through the files...

Last problem to solve involves tech level of certain skills.  I\'m getting

I\'ll send another message when it\'s ready for world distribution :-) and
if there are no objections, I\'ll mail it to those who ask me for it AFTER
I announce that it\'s ready (I have a terrible memory...).  How should I
send it to the TML archives?  By sending it to traveller-request?  Certainly
not by sending it to traveller!

Ok, it must have gotten missed in my post :-)

The files are TEXT files.  I have yet to see a binary file that wasn\'t
obviouslly binary from the filetype (PC .ARC and .ZOO files).  The few that are
real binary are few and far between.  All of the SECTOR data is TEXT regardless
of what the GENIE software says.

When you use X[YZ]modem to upload a file to GEnie (CompuServe, etc) it uploads
8 bit files unless you specifiy otherwise.  To GEnie, any 8 bit file is BINARY.
You can still look at them or download them via Capture or by X[YZ]modem.

The only problem that I have encountered with the files is that they are CR
delimited lines, not CRLF (PC) or LF (Unix(r)).  A simple 6 line \'C\' program
fixes the problem.

    Had a long talk with GDW members Loren Wiseman and Frank Chadwick about
computers last Saturday.  This was mainly because Loren just got a Macintosh
at work.  From what I gathered the workshop is just about all converted

types such as GDW, but it still lets them feel like they are doing something
sophisticated.  For example, Frank was saying that he didn\'t know how to get
to MS-DOS to look at an apple file, in fact he barely knows what MS-DOS is or
what it really does.  Loren is a little bit better, but then he has a tendency
to tinker with things to figure out how they work.
    As far as a USNET connection to GDW the nearest one I know of is 60
miles away at the University of Illinois in Champaign-Urbana.  I don\'t
think Illinois State which is in Bloomington-Normal has a connection.

Y\'know, I had this same problem.  No matter what I did with the
numbers, I could NOT get them to come out in any way, shape, or
form to be analogous to what happens today when you buy a house,
which is the model I was using.  

My problems with it were that the interest rates were coming
out far too LOW.   4% just doesn\'t seem right to me, in these
inflation prone times.

The other thing is, of course, what you mention above.  It
seems almost impossible to make any real kind of profit with
any moderately good ship.

Perhaps we should adopt the tone of many sci-fi books and have
the ships be HUNDREDS of years old.

Anyone care to adventure on a TL12 400 tonner?

Sounds great!  I wrote a character generator in GNU Emacs lisp

I found a problem with generating homeworlds for players.  I
wanted to make the homeworld be an existing planet in the
sector and I found that with randomly generated homeworlds they
wouldn\'t match anything around.  I ended up with a lot of
people from sectors that were unreachable from the Marches.

Neural weapons are supposed to be a rare and perhaps illegal

>This one ought to draw some interesting comments.
You bet.  This is my specialty.

	The main thing overlooked in your post is speculative trade.  Most
merchant ships can just barely break even on freight, and some (such as the
far trader) actually lose money under the standard assumptions. Speculative
trade is where merchants (from free traders to Tukera lines) make their real
money.  The Ref\'s guide rules on trade are a bit confusing (so what else is
new :-)), so I\'ll try to go over all the inobvious stuff. This is from
memory (my
books are at home), so if I goof on the numbers please let me know.

>Let us assume that the merchant acquired a USED Far Trader

	The rules imply it is difficult to finance a used ship (although
you could probably swing something if you have high Admin or Liason),
and more importantly, merchant ships received as mustering out benifits
were financed when new even if they are old now.  So for my figures, I
will assume that the ship is a new far trader, just financed -- ie rolled
once at mustering out. Multiple rolls just mean the ship is older and more
payments have been made, the amounts don\'t change.
	The far trader list price of MCr. 41.07 is financed as follows:
20% down payment - already made.
1/240 of ship price per month for 480 months (40 years).
This means a total cost of 220%, and a monthly payment of Cr. 171,125.
I think that the monthly ship payment can be dropped off at any A or B
starport, and gets forwarded by Xboat if your bank doesn\'t have a branch
at that particular port. In the following, I am assuming 2 jumps per month,
and 2 ~5 day stays in port doing business.

	Monthly Expenses (in Cr.)

Mortgage		171,125
Fuel			None - get water (free) and run it thru the
	purification plant. If you don\'t have one, get one. They are very cheap.
	(30,000 Cr for a minimum size tech 15 plant)
Life support		40,000	2K per statroom, whoever is in it, for every jump.
	I am assuming worst case for expenses.
Salaries		9,000    All crew gets 3,000/mo. (should be plenty)
Berthing fees		200
Layaway for overhaul	3,423   Based on the cost of the ship when new.

Total			Cr. 223,748 per month (4 weeks)

Income

	For speculative trade, there are a number of conditions that you need
to make a profit.  The first is a good route ("good" can be hard to pin
down without
a lot of analysis -- I\'ll post some comparisions after checking my
books). Probably the
easiest good route to find is two Hi pop worlds with type A starports
within one jump
of another, so I\'ll give figures for that.

>According to specs. in "Supplement 7: Traders and Gunboats", the ship can
>carry 7 High/Mid passengers, 4 in Low Passage, and 46 tons of freight. 

The far trader specs have changed in MT due to the change in ship design
rules; they now have 61 tons of cargo space. I think the low berths are
gone too,
so I\'ll leave them out of my calculations.

	Assumptions: The ship is jumping back and forth between two worlds
with pop 9 (Hi), starport A, tech 15. (A lower tech level is actually
better here,
since it reduces cargo cost without changing anything else, and a pop of
A would increase available cargos, so this is the worst case of "pop Hi,
starport A").  I also assume someone on the ship has the Broker and Trader skills.

Passengers:
High:	3D-1D+1		avg. ~8
Middle:	3D+1		avg. ~11.5
	Only very rarely will you be unable to get a full load of passengers, so
I will assume a full load of mid. passengers. (Normally, most or all
will be high
passengers - so this will more than compensate for the rare unfilled slot.)

7 Middle passengers		Cr. 56,000 per jump (2 weeks)

Speculative Cargo

	The Freight and Cargo chart (section 5 on p.50 in Ref\'s guide) is used
once for freight and once for cargo (twice if you have someone with Broker).
The description for the table does not make this very clear, though, and I
think it should be fixed. I will assume that the DMs for destination pop apply
only to freight, although this is not stated.

Lot type			number		average	average tons
Major:	(1D+10 tons ea.)	1D+5 (x2)	17	229.5
Minor:	(1D+5 tons ea.)	1D+6 (x2)	19	161.5
Incidental (1D tons ea.)	1D-2 (x2)	~3	11.6

	This gives a total of ~402 tons of speculative cargo available, in
variously sized lots. At this point, your person with Trader looks them over
to determine the first die roll for each on the actual value chart for sale at
the destination.  1/6 of them, on average, will have a prerolled "6"; for
~67 tons.  He then buys the largest combination of these lots that will
fit in the hold.  I will assume that the ship averages 50 out of 61 tons
of prerolled "6" cargo. In practice, any remaining nooks can usually be
filled with prerolled 4 or 5 cargo.

Cargo cost:  Base 4,000 - 1,000 (A starport) - 1,000 (Hi pop) + 1,500 (TL15)
	= Cr. 3,500 per ton.

Cargo base selling price = 5,000 + 1,000 (Hi vs Hi) = Cr. 6,000 per ton.

	At the destination, the goods are sold with the aid of a Broker-4
(available at all type A starports).  The prerolled 6 gives a total roll of
7 thru 12 +4 for the broker gives 11 thru 16, for an average actual selling
price of 270% x 0.8 (left after broker fee) = 216% of 6,000 = 12,960 per ton.
Profit is 12,960 - 3,500 (cost) = 9,460 per ton for 50 tons gives a total of
Cr. 473,000 average profit on speculative trade per jump.

	Average Monthly Income Estimate ( in Cr.)
Passengers:	56,000 per jump = 112,000 per month
Cargo:		473,000 per jump = 946,000 per month

Total:		1,058,000
Expenses:	-223,748
		----
Net Profit	834,252 Cr. per month

	This is a lot of money, but remember this is based on average runs
on a good route with no complications (the stuff adventures are made of...)
The point is that it is possible to get rich as a merchant IF you know what
you are doing and choose your route well. In practice, a merchant should be
able to meet the payments and save for a rainy day or time spent off the "good"
routes (ie most places). 
	Comments and corrections welcome.

I have just released a new version of my continental drift simulator.
The main improvements from version 1 (released 11 / 15 / 89) are:
    - Added text-only mode to support nongraphics UN*X machines.
    - Graphics ported to Sun 3 and 4 systems.
    - Ported to IBM PC by Peter Lind.
    - Parameters can come from an input file.

The source code is available from the USENET group comp.sources.misc, where
it is archived.  It consists of two shar files.

TEC draws a map of some imaginary world and puts one big continent on it.
The program then graphically simulates the breakup of this supercontinent by
rifts and the drifting of the continents.  Mountains are built by
subsuming and by continental collision, and are reduced by erosion.  As
more time passes, the continents tend to drift back into a supercontinent
and split up again, forming what some authors call a "supercontinent cycle."

The program produces a map of an imaginary world which contains realistic
looking mountain ranges and continents which sometimes look like they fit
together (like South America and Africa on Earth).

Here\'s an example output file.  0\'s are ocean, 1\'s are land, 2\'s are
mountains.  (Graphics output has up to 256 grey scales.)

Hmm, I\'d say that allowing a separate roll for each consignment gives the
players a too big advantage. This way, they can be assured of a "6" at the
first roll and a 3.5 average at the second roll.

To moderate this a little, why not let the cargo consist of 1-6 cathegories
(rolled on the types of goods tables), more for Hi In Histellar and possibly
only one or two for a Lo Ni or Ag. The first rolls is then rolled once for
*each cathegory* to reflect the probable price on the market. The when the 
market is reached, roll *one* die for the whole consignment as second die roll
to reflect the markets current view on goods from that source.

Also, a task roll could be required for each estimate:

   To estimate the price of goods on the market world 
   (ie roll a die in advance):
   Difficult, Trader, Edu, 2 min, (uncertain)
   Referee: Lack of accurate data about the market world makes this task
Formidable. On Full Truth, roll one die, this is the first die on the sale price
table. On Some Truth this die is not correct. On No Truth he goods will be
worthless on the market world.
Implement mishaps as legal problems on the market world, ie cargo banned or
disliked for legal or religous reasons. Legal skill can be used to detect this
in advance.

Re: The question on using scuba gear -

    It\'s just my opinion, but if characters want to use scuba gear
    for anything more demanding than a couple of minutes in a pool,
    then they better have at least scuba-0 ( ie basic training in
    what they\'re doing ). It may be tricky for characters to have
    got hold of the skill, but trying to do without it altogether
    would lead to the kind of problems you get in trying to use
    a vacsuit without skill, except visibility is a lot worse down
    there. The first minor problem they run into is liable to have
    them breathing water, or being forced to surface in a hurry at
    least, which can cause major problems if they do it too fast.

Well, after much prodding from list members and a call to Digest Group,
I have satisfied my paranoia and distrustfulness regarding the GEnie
files.  I am very interested in getting them posted to the mailing list,
and soon.

However, I would like to control the deluge rather than have megabytes
come poring over the list all at once, in triplicate.  The need still
exists for someone to organize the distribution of the material.
My main concerns are:

    o it be in a digested form; that is, small messages are
      concatenated into a single message not exceeding 50K bytes in
      size.
    o the subject line contains a clear notice that the material is
      culled from GEnie, including a volume/number like the existing
      digests.
    o exactly one copy of each message goes out to the list.
    o all copyrights remain intact, and the origination of the material
      (i.e. GEnie, Genie poster, owner, author) is clearly marked.
    o each part of the material is reproduced in whole, unedited (except
      where necessary to split a file avoid a giant TML message in excess
      of 55K bytes).
    o it be in plain ascii text wherever possible.
    o the material is gradually released (to avoid giant increases in
      TML throughput).
    o and lastly, that everything of interest to the list gets posted,
      without any gaping holes.

The easiest way to assure all the above criteria are met is for me to get
a new TML Topic Coordinator to manage the download and release to the
list.

Would those of you who offered to download the files and redistribute
them PLEASE drop me a line via email?

Simon is very correct.  Speaking as a trained Rescue Diver with 19 years
of SCUBA experience, I can definitely state that without proper training
(lots of it, if you\'re planning on anything more than recreational diving),
a little mistake can get you dead, even in very shallow (<10 ft.) water.

First, there\'s working with the gear itself: watching your tank pressure,
not ascenting too fast (air embolisms, you know), not staying down too long
(getting the bends), not going too deep (again, the bends and possibly
nitrogen narcosis), or just flat running out of air and drowning because
you panicked and forgot how to do an emergency swimming ascent.

Then there\'s the diving environment itself.  Being underwater for extended
periods is no more natural for humans than being in vacuum for extended
periods.  You have to watch out for currents, low visibility, dangerous
plants and animals, dangerous temperatures (usually, too cold), and then
most dangerous thing of all is your inexperienced dive buddy :-).

For game purposes, the following guidelines would probably work:

        SCUBA-0:  Basic Open Water Certification (the lowest level of
                  diver training), followed by half a dozen dives.
        SCUBA-1:  Advanced Open Water Certification (the next level of
                  diver training), plus 1+ year of diving experience.
        SCUBA-2:  Search & Rescue Certification (or graduation from a
                  Commercial Diving Instruction School), plus 3+ years
                  of diving experience.
        SCUBA-3:  SCUBA Instructor Training, plus at least 5 years of
                  actual experience in a wide variety of dive locations.

Given the above list, most REAL recreational divers would be classified
as SCUBA-1, with Navy frogmen being SCUBA-2, and UDT or Seals being SCUBA-3.

Some examples are given below for tasks in Traveller, using these scuba
skills:

        To maintain control in a heavy current:
        Difficult, SCUBA, Str, 2 sec. (fateful)
        Ref: If control is lost, the diver is swept along in the current,
        possibly taking damage from collisions with obstacles.

        To pry off a tunnel cover (grate) underwater:
        Routine, SCUBA, Str, Dex, 15 sec. (uncertain)
        Ref: If the diver lacks the neccessary tools, the task becomes
        difficult.  Exceptional failure means that the diver has slipped
        and cut himself on the edge of the cover (1D of damage).

and so on.  Hope this info helps out.

Subject: Psionics help
Organization: personal mailbox at The Next Challenge
 
[I tried to send this message to the TML last week, but never ]
[saw it posted. So I\'m trying again. Sometimes my local mailer]
[ chokes. If the original was posted, pardon the duplication. ]
 
      Thanks for the several replies on my question for psionic
help. My GM and I will be getting together to work out some 
kind of "scenario" for altering my characters abilities. (I\'m
sort of attached as it\'s my first one.)
 
To Rob Miracle (message 916):
 
      Thanks for the suggestion and the outline of possible point
costs for the "new and improved" ability. Actually it was a VERY 
GOOD psi level (11!), at the time of rollup I didn\'t know how 
good it was. (Beginners luck.)
 
To Greg Givler (message 928):
 
      So far my character has used her abilities in "public" 
only under extreme circumstances. In the pirate ship I gave as
an example, no one on the ship actually knew WHAT happened, just
that the ship blew up. Actually they didn\'t have time to think as
we were very close, and had to go into jumpspace to avoid the EMP
and shock wave. Even then we had a misjump.) My character keeps a
tight reign on herself, just imagine what would happen if she had
a nightmare while asleep!
 
To uunet!tess!leonard (message 933):
 
      I\'m no expert, but I do have a problem with your message.
First let me say I should have mentioned in my original message
that the GM determined the 1 mg pellet of antimatter hit the fuel
tank of the pirate ship. You mention;

      I was under the impression that a matter/antimatter 
explosion was a FUSION reaction, and 100% complete energy 
conversion, not .01%. I do puzzle at a ship that could take a 
10 kilo TNT explosion on it\'s hull and not be bothered. (I 
guess Megatraveller ships are a LOT tougher than I thought.)

      If a FUSION reaction took place in a hydrogen fuel tank 
might not SOME of the hydrogen participate in the reaction? It
wasn\'t the oxidation I was referring to, but the byproduct 
H -> He reaction. Even if no fusion reaction took place, wouldn\'t
the gamma radiation mess up the ship systems, as well as the 
biological systems?

      You\'re right everything has a price. As mentioned above, 
I keep a tight reign on this character. Of course since she\'s 
from the Aslan Heirate culture, she doesn\'t fight much, 
(that\'s MALE work!).
 
      In another instance, our party was gather in a local 
restaurant before a mission, simply to plan our actions, and 
minding out own business. he bad guys started shooting up the
place, the males of our party (human, aslan, and zhodani), 
returned fire. When the baddies blew a hole in the ceiling, (there
were more on the roof), I simply moved to another table out of the
line of fire, ordered another drink from the terrified waiter, and
watched. When an idiot on the roof took a shot at me, (missed, but
close), I simply looked at him, and turned the carbon atoms in his
head to nitrogen. (It\'s quicker, less obvious, and quieter than 
sodium.) Since the bad guys were a suicide force, when he died the
self-destruct unit got rid of the evidence.
 
      Thanks again for the help, suggestions, and info.

Ok, stupid question, who is working on (moderating) the Trade and Commerce
system?

Next questions, do you have any ideas on a simple way to compensate for the
following problem:

Using the Errata Modifyed rules (and assuming a No Trade Class, B starport
world of TL-10:

  1 Ton of Exotic Fluids Costs 5000 cr / ton
  1 Ton of Consumable Milk Costs 5000 cr / ton
  1 Ton of Computers Costs 5000 cr / ton
  1 Ton of Weapons Costs 5000 cr / ton
  1 Ton of Currency Costs 5000 cr / ton

Problem #1
  Players Buy 1 Ton of Weapons at 5000 cr / ton.  Lets say they are autorifles
  for example (5 KG each, I like round numbers).  That is 200 autorifles in the
  1 ton lot.  An autorifle sells for 1000 cr each, that is 200,000 cr for the
  lot.

  Players buy 1 Ton of Consuable Milk at 5000 cr / ton.  (1 L water weighs 1KG
  right?)  That is 1000 Liters of Milk, at lets say 0.5 cr per Liter.  Or 500
  cr for the lot.

Now the system put forth in Merchant Prince (Book 6) is the basic megatraveller
system with one exception, they left out what the items were.  Now, I could say
sure you buy 10 tons of TL-12 Manufactured Goods for 8000 cr / ton.  But they
are going to open the boxes and see what they bought and they find 10 tons of
holo crystals which they can sell for 10 cr each (or what ever) and in the 10
tons of them there are over 100,000 of them.  You know just what the players
will do!!!


Now my delima is this, just were do I put a modifier in?  Do I make a TL for
each item and modify the cost by that?  If so, how do I compensate for some of
the items such as currency and information  in which Tonnage means nothing.
If I do anything different, it isn\'t standard MT, so GDW may not recognize my
work.  I play to sell/give away (yet to be decided) this nifty Traveller program
for the IBM/PC -- VGA required, it is SHARP!!!  Uses GDW/DGP/Genie sector
files, as well as my own propritary format (based on James P\'s Sector.C
program, but modified somewhat), and as soon as I discover the TML format, i
will adjust the program to handle that format also.  (I Just love .RC files).

I know this doesn\'t conform with all of the TML development going on, but I
started this in Turbo Pascal well before I even knew of TML.

HELP (Anyone!!!) (And Thanks in Advance)
Rob

There\'s no armor but I forgot to check the armor table to see if it is
possible to add armor without increasing the weight at all.  Please
note: to calculate CP\'s for the sensors I used the highest tech level on
the apropriate chart, not tech level 17 (unless that is the tech level
actually used for the calculations).
  Quite the fun (and expensive) toy for any grav vehicle enthusiasts out
there.
  I probably should have used tech level 15 but some characters I just
created are based on a TL17 world.
  
  Jim Baranski (sp?): if you are able to join the pbem game, and your
character has the money (or can borrow it) you should try one of these
out!

     Nope.  Fusion is, basically, slamming atoms together hard enough that
they "fuse" (that is, meld together to form a new, heavier atom).  For an
example, look at the Hydrogen -> Helium reaction (the one that makes
sunlight, among other things).

     A matter-antimatter reaction, on the other hand, is the *total
conversion* of mass into its equivalent quantity of energy (I\'m given to
understand that this reaction produces mostly gamma radiation, but my
knowledge may be obsolete).  For a given amount of antimatter (or
contra-terrene matter) m, the reaction optimally converts a mass of 2m
(the antimatter plus an equivalent amount of normal, or terrene matter)
into energy.  The relationship is shown mathematically with the famous
equation:
                2
          E = mc                                   (1)

where E is the energy produced, m is the mass, and c is the speed of light
in a vacuum (approximately 3e8 m/s).  As you can see, even a small amount
of mass represents a *huge* (at least, in human terms) amount of energy.

     In the above example of 1 mg of antimatter, the reaction would
involve 2 mg of mass (don\'t forget your normal matter), so the energy is
(using cgs):

          E = (2e-3) * (3e10)
            = 6e7 ergs

     Not bad, but not catastophic, either.  Don\'t forget, in the example
above, this energy is applied to the *hull* of a starship.  Starship hulls
are made of the toughest materials available, since they have to endure
a very hazardous environment.

 >conversion, not .01%. I do puzzle at a ship that could take a

     Bothered?  Maybe.  We *are* talking about a fairly dense gamma flux
applied to a small area of hull.  I\'m sure that it (as well as the shock)
would be noticed.  But I doubt that it would do even as much damage as
a standard HE ship-to-ship missile.

     Not enough to matter.  Remember, fusion reactions are *extremely*
difficult to maintain (if it was easy, everybody\'d be doing it--literally)
*If* the antimatter suddenly appeared in the fuel tank, the conversion
*might* cause some of the neighboring hydrogen to fuse, but the energy
output of this secondary fusion would be negligible in comparison to the
yield from the matter-antimatter reaction.

     Probably not.  The amount of radiation produced is quite a bit
below that of a nuclear (or thermonuclear) device.  I think the hull
could take it in stride, especially at higher tech levels.

Just out of curiosity...  how do other folks out there handle the prospect
of military career characters swapping services?

Some background here:   When I was in the U.S. Navy (1975-1981) we often had
folks that were called OSVETS.   (Other Service VETeranS)   They would 
typically come into the Navy and instead of attending boot camp they would 
attend an orientation school that would acclimate them to the Navy environment.
Typically they would keep their old rank or at most drop one rank.   They 
would, however, need to take the rating exams for the rank they were holding 
and pass them.

With that in mind, in some of my own campaigns, as well as some that I played
in, multi service characters were allowed.   The methodology in place was 
as follows:

	1) Muster out of the original service.

	2) Make the enlistment roll.

	3) On 1d6 < 3 (if using Mercenary rules) drop 
	one rank.  Exceptions:  If prior service was 
	"unranked".

This option was allowed for "enlisted" characters and not officers.  An 
officer gets his commision in one branch and pretty much stays there. 
The exception to that rule is Marine officers who want to switch to the 
Navy.  They need to make the enlistment roll with a dm -2 and then roll 
2d6 10+ .

Thoughts????

There has been a lot of discussion on Anti-matter recently on the list. One
thing that people have not mentioned is that anti-matter is not an element
in and of itself. You have anti-electrons (positrons), anti-hydrogen,
anti-helium, anti-uranium, etc.

Perhaps the more physics oriented on the list could clairify the next point:
I have read (perhaps in Sci-Fi) that a matter-antimatter reaction only takes
place between like elements. This becomes important with the higher tech
missiles (anti-matter ones). If a chunk of anti-carbon is impacting on a
hull (presumably some iron/titanium type metal), what happens?

Scenario 1) Every gram of the anti-carbon combies with the metal for a really
big boom (this is what the rules imply). All the missile owners are happy.

Scenario 2) On impact the atoms don\'t "fit" and only the surface electrons 
combine for a small explosion hurling the majority of the anti-carbon in the
opposite direction. All the ship owners would be happy, as you would have to
have a missile corresponding to the hull nearly exactly (Anti-titanium, 
covered by the same type of anti-paint etc.)

  I have a few questions.  Does the armor cover the driver?  Is this a
design decision or do I have to do something to make it happen, i.e. add
basic env and basic ls?  If I reduce the armor, can the weight of the
hull be reduced below the value given in the vehicle chassis table?
Would feul cells take up less volume and weight for the same power
output?  Would anybody be stupid enough to ride one of these things on a
possibly dangerous courier mission?  How does the armor compare to the
armor levels in Hand to Hand combat, cloth and combat armor etc.?  Do
the numbers mean the same thing, for example, a speeder has an armor of
4, is this less than the protection provided by cloth armor?

A few points in response to Stephen D. Smith\'s reply to my msg.

I mentioned the energy conversion in a fission bomb to show where I was
getting my figures.

A matter/antimatter reaction is neither fission nor fusion. 

I said 10 kg of tnt wouldn\'t bother the pirate much, not that it
wouldn\'t bother them at all.

And finally, no, even if it hit the fuel tank, it wouldn\'t cause the
hydrogen to undergo a fusion explosion. Both fission and fusion reactions
require *something* to hold the reaction together until it is mostly
completed. Otherwise the first bit to react will blow the reaction apart
(you can take enough plutonium to make a bomb and place the pieces
together. Instead of a 20 kiloton explosion, you get the equivalent of
a blasting cap, and that scatters the pieces and stops the reaction.)
A fusion reaction requires that the hydrogen meet certain conditions of
temperature *and* pressure and that those conditions be maintained for
a period of time. (the temp and pressure conditions are such that you
can trade pressure for temperature). The bit of hydrogen near your
blast might have reached a hugh enough temperature. It\'s doubtful that
it reached a high enough pressure, and virtually certain that it didn\'t
do so for enough time!

     Um...  Yes, but usually you deal with individual antiparticles.  In
Traveller terms, there was an article in issue 20 of the Journal ("Spinal
Mounts Revisited," page 40) that talked about antiparticle accelerators
(oof; woudn\'t that just ruin your whole day?).

     However, I can\'t see any reason against antiparticles associating
themselves into antiatoms.  Hmm.  If you used antihydrogen to form
antihelium would that be antifusion?  But, I digress...  ;-)

     Well, if the structure of contra-terrene atoms are analagous to
terrene, then there should be a cloud of positrons (antielectrons--
positively charged) surrounding the nuclei.  Once the positron shells
come in contact with the electron shells of normal matter, then a
conversion reaction would take place.  Also, since charged antiparticles
(that is, not antineutrons) have the opposite charge of their terrene
forms, they would be attracted to one another.

     I think Scenario 1 is the one that\'ll fly.  However, I\'m not a
physicist, merely an interested amateur.

The TOTAL CONVERSION statement is correct, and the formula is correct,
but the numbers plugged into it are WAY off.  The Speed-of-Light (3e8 m/s)
squared is 9e16, not 3e10 (remember, (x^y)^z = (x^z)^(y*z)).  Therefore,
using MKS units:

        E = (2e-3) * (9e16)
          = 1.8e14 joules (= 1.8e21 ergs, since 1 joule=1e7 ergs)

not 6e7 ergs.  And since that amount of energy would make plasma of a 
Plankwell-class battleship, well, if that\'s not catastrophic, then I don\'t
want to be around for something that is :-).  Seriously, according to The
Encyclopaedia Britannica (15th Ed., 1987), in Vol. 16, page 520, Column 1,
the total energy (including radiation) generated by the 20-kiloton bomb
dropped on Hiroshima was about 1e13 joules (1e7 Kw-Hrs.).  If we assume
(based on that data) that there are 5e12 joules released per kiloton of
nuclear detonation (1e13/20), and that any increase is linear, then the
total conversion reaction postulated above would be roughly eqaul to a
200 kiloton nuclear detonation.

Not in MY backyard, thank you very much!

Effective tommorrow evening, distribution on the Traveller Mailing List
will change.

Members currently receiving the twice-a-week digests will see no change.

Members currently receiving "instant" mail will see two *major* changes:

    o mail will be distributed only once a day, at 8pm, instead of at
      6am, 6pm, noon and midnight.
    o mail will not arrive as several individual messages; instead, it
      will be bundled up into a "daily digest".

I am sorry that the immediate feedback members are used to on the
instant delivery list will be significantly impacted.  I am also sorry
that the messages will not arrive individually, but be bundled into
daily digests.

In light of the recent increase in traffic and number of recipients, I
have been asked to reduce the mail load on the Tektronix corporate mail
server, and this is my first shot at it.  Hopefully, no further changes
will be necessary.  Sorry to pull executive fiat on this one, folks, but
these changes are necessary--so that the list keeps a low profile so it
isn\'t axed by Tek management.

In the mean time, keep up those information-packed postings!

Here\'s one for metlay, the Traveller Relic, and other local savants:

In Traveller\'s Digest #17, at the end of the "Psionic Knights" module, mention
is made of Count Draco Sylas, "...one of the most important members in the
Domain of Deneb."

Is this a person with a "Classic Traveller" history?  Who is he?  Where is he?
Any other info?

Thankee!

There was an article several years ago that had all the services and what
you could move to. The logic being that most of us don\'t stay in the same
job all your life, so why should someone in the Traveller Universe. I think
this article was in an old White Dwarf. I could have been in an old Journal
though. The GM that has run all the Traveller Campaigns that I have played
in, used this to roll up characters. I have had characters with 2 terms in
the Scouts, 1 Term in the Rogues and two Terms in the Nobles, and so on.

If I can I will see if he has the orignal article and where it was published.
The thing I remember was that the older you got the less choices you had.
it also had die modifiers for enlistment too.

Not only is cross-enlistment viable, it\'s vital, especially from military
to non-militarty service ("Yes, Tukera Lines likes having the best pilots.
That\'s why we hire Navy vets. Don\'t let retirement mean wasting away:
call your local Tukera office.") A character who can dip into two or more
areas of service becomes better rounded and more useful in an adventure.
I\'ve had rules of this type for years, and they work very well. Interestingly,
tho, the only place where such things are legal in the official rules are
when the character is a Vargr. Short attention spans, I guess.|->

The only reactions that matter in matter-antimatter collision are on  the
subatomic level; positrons with electrons yielding two gamma rays at 511
keV each, and protons with antiprotons yielding gamma pairs at appx. 1 GeV
each. The gross structure of the antimatter is unimportant..


Interestingly enough, there was a serious science text called "Galaxies,
Antigalaxies" thaty theorized galaxies being entirely made of antimatter, thus
explaining why there\'s a local imbalance of matter to antimatter in our galaxy.
This theory was debunked when time reversal violation was discovered  and a

real reason for the predominance of matter was explained. In fact, it\'s this
fact that makes places like Shionthy impossible in normal physics. (Shionthy
is an antimatter asteroid belt in the MArches. It was made by Grandfather.)

except you got the figures wrong too!

E=(2e-6)*(9e16) {it\'s two *milligrams*, not two *grams!!}

E= 1.8e11 joules 

So we get about .36 kT using your figures  for joules/kT.

But your figures disagree with themselves. 1e13 joules = 2.7e6 kW-hr.

Since I don\'t have the same edition of the Brittanica, I can\'t check
your reference because you didn\'t give the name of the article!

I can\'t find any of my references at the moment, but I remember that
1 MT = 4.2e??? ergs. So we have a problem.

My calculations reveal that these estimate are quite a lot on the low side.

If you don\'t like lots of (simple) probability theory and basic statistics
then skip down to the end and look at the results.





I worked from the scout service (since it gives easy figures to process)
I assume that about 1 in 6 people are in the scout service (from the
draft thingy).
Thus,
	Pr(Scout) = 1/6

To survive a term of service, you\'ve got to roll 7+ (21 in 36) unless you\'ve
got END of 9+ then you have to roll 5+ (30 in 36).  The chance of END 9+ is
10 in 36 (I ignore aging effects).
So,
	Pr(survive a term) = 10/36 * 30/36 + 26/36 * 21/36 = 47/72

To re-enlist you need 3+ (35 in 36), I ignore the force re-enlist option.
Thus,
	Pr(re-enlist) = 35/36

I also assume that a person will remain in the service until they die or they
fail to re-enlist.  If the die I\'ll assume that they left at the end of the
previous term and not receive any skills for this term).

The expected number of terms served by an average scout character is

Sum(i=1..12) i * (35/36)^(i-1) * (47/72)^i * (1/36 + 35/36 * 25/72)
             ^         ^             ^                ^
        # terms  Pr(re-enlist)  Pr(surviving)  Pr(fail re-enlist or dying)

This sum is approximately equal to 1.74
The prob of all these terms is 0.64999 say 0.65
The probability of not surviving the first term is: 25/72 = 0.347222
So the probability of serving longer than 12 terms is 0.00278, and if
I assume that all longer services are actually 12 terms we add 0.03 to the sum
(12*0.00278 = 0.033)

So an average scout character would expect to be in the service for 1.77 terms
(Bet you didn\'t think it was that short did ya).

[ for other services I\'d expect a little longer since scouts don\'t survive
very well ]

Now turning to skills received:
A scout receives 2 skills per term (plus 2 extra in the first term)
A scout can also receive special duty on a roll of 4+ (giving one extra skill)
but if that roll is 8+ the character receives two extra skills.

Pr(2 skills per term) = 3/36
Pr(3 skills per term) = 18/36
Pr(4 skills per term) = 15/36
And 2 bounus skills for the first term and a pilot-1 for being a scout.

The expected number of skills per term is:
	2*3/36 + 3*18/36 + 4*15/36 = 10/3 = 3.33333

So for an average scout character, the characters would be expected to have
	3.333*1.77 + 2 + pilot-1
	or 7.89999 skills and a bonous pilot-1.

For simplicity assume the character gets 8 skills and pilot-1


Looking at the skill table the chance of a space skill is given by:
	15/36 * 2/24 + 21/36 * 1/18 = 29/432
(taking into account the advanced education table and assuming that the
tables are equally likely)

Looking at the space skill table, there are 6 skills present so assume that
1 in 6 space skills are actually pilot.

Thus,
	Pr(any scout skill being pilot) = 29/432 * 1/6 = 29/2592 = 0.011188

Consider the event that a skill is pilot vs it isn\'t.
Pr(event) = 29/2592
Pr(not event) = 1- 29/2592

Expanding the probabilities for the 8 skills the average scout character gets
gives,
Pr(event occurs 0 times) = 0.573548
Pr(event occurs 1 time) =  0.330181
Pr(event occurs 3 times) = 8.315997e-2
Pr(event occurs 3 times) = 1.196843e-2
Pr(event occurs 4 times) = 1.076564e-3
Pr(event occurs 5 times) = 6.197594e-5
Pr(event occurs 6 times) = 2.229903e-6
Pr(event occurs 7 times) = 4.584701e-8
Pr(event occurs 8 times) = 4.123955e-10

Going back to the population initially considered.
10^13 people, divided by 2 since half of all people aren\'t of consideration,
better divide by 10 -> 10^12
then 1 in 6 end up in the scouts: 10^12 / 6: 166,666,666,666 people under
consideration.

Multiplying by the above probs gives the number of scouts with each skill level
(remember these are average scouts,  aged less than 26 since they\'ve served
less than two term !!!)

pilot-1 = 95591470883
pilot-2 = 55030325669
pilot-3 = 13859995174
pilot-4 = 1994738759
pilot-5 = 179427333
pilot-6 = 10329324
pilot-7 = 371650.640
pilot-8 = 7641.168
pilot-9 = 68.732

I\'d expect there to be quite a lot of pilot-9\'s running (flying) around the
place.  Pilot-7\'s are really common place. By pilot-11 I\'d expect them to be
quite rare.  Also remember that this is only considering the scout service
since the numbers are easier than for the other services.  Other (ranked)
services would allow for many more skills to be obtained, but they don\'t get
the bonus of pilot-1 for simply joining up.

Belters would be nice to ruin since SPACE is a very common skill for them.


Also note that since MegaTraveller restricts the DM on a task to be +-8, high
skills levels are unlikely to upset game balance.  I think that they\'d only
make the character more famous/infamous in his/her profession.  That is, there
isn\'t too much difference between a pilot-8 and a pilot-10 in game terms, the
pilot-10 would command a much bigger salary.

Just reading some stuff on missiles, anti-matter, etc. and I thought
I would put in my two cents.

Anti-particle beams may not work.  They would, after all, have to be
charged particles, and these (a) do not work well in space to begin with
and (b) can be deflected by magnetic fields.  This is why there is so
much trouble about SDI, you need neutral particle beams to make it work
in deep space (and high energy neutrons are about as good for your health
as recent French philosophy), BUT they are much harder to build.  Of
course, since this is the FUTURE, we can assume these mere technical
problems have been overwhelmed by our engineers-uber-alles.

Anti-matter bombs might work, but they are probably going to be real
expensive, even assuming the reduction in cost allowed by mass production
of anti-matter.  (Here\'s an adventure idea for all you GM\'s--anti-terrorist
work (or terrorist work) at an anti-matter production facility.  Using
guns near a lot of the equipment might be what we commonly refer to as 
a BAD IDEA.)

One more thing about missiles.  I don\'t know how people run it in their
game worlds, but even my conventinal missiles with wimpy 100 kg. TNT
warheads do a lot of damage.  Why?  Missiles in space work differently
than missiles in an atmosphere.  I have missiles boosting at 20 gees,
usually from a distance of several thousand kilometers (the maximum
range on the long range versions is 300,000 km. and it takes it nearly
an hour to reach its target).  Missiles generally have course-correction
stuff built into their computer brains, so they simply accelerate at their
targets.  They usually hit at something like 50 km./sec.  You have any
idea what happens to a spaceship when it gets hit by something like this?
Picture the USS Nimitz...now picture it after being hit by a meteor that
weighs as much as Buick!

To keep my space combat system simple, I have adopted a base value for
missile hits, even though they might be moving at different speeds (there
is probably a diminishing return of effects, and as the missile boosts,
it does get lighter since it is using up fuel).  A single missile hit
will totally destroy a spacecraft of less than 12,500 tons (picture a
California-class cruiser) and will disable--"Keptin!  We\'re dead in space!"--
a spacecraft of less than 25,000 tons (picture the Soviet Kirov-class 
cruiser.)  Of course, since missile attacks are often made in huge
barrages designed to overwhelm anti-missile defensive lasers, the point
is often moot.

Take care all.

Still ironing out mailers.  Almost all of you are working now - even
the recalcitrant mailers are bending to our collective will.


Rulings on psionics (at least for this game):

A psionic CANNOT passively determine if there is another psionic
(who is also passive) in the area.  That is, you\'d never know whether
X is psionic unless one or both of you do something active.  This
means that either X has to scan you (which implies that you know
when your natural or artifical shield is touched) or you have to
scan X (and touch X\'s shield).  Of course, if there are several
beings around, any one or several of them might have touched the
shield, so there is not necessarily a two-way link at just this
level.  A more complete contact is needed for that.

A psionic CANNOT automatically tell the difference between a natural
psi shield and a technolgical (or drug-created) psi shield.  All the
character will know is that a shield is working.  

No one so far who knows for sure has come forward and said whether
wearing a psi shield in some fashion alters you psi abilities.  For
example, it might color or distort your impressions.  (I won\'t make
it do evil, non-rules, things though such as deflecting telekenisis
- - if it\'s supposed to work, it will work.  It might be just a little
off center however.)


Your location:

You have astutely determined that you are on the frontier near the
hinterworlds.  This is only several weeks fro Dulinor\'s territory,
Solomani Territory, and Aslan (I think its Aslan - you can correct
me on this if I\'m off base -- don\'t have my books here) territory.

There are several nebulae nearby.  Note that these do not show up on
standard star maps because usually they\'re unfruitful for commerce
or military purposes.  (again correct me if I\'m way off.  I don\'t
remember ever seing a nebula though...)


Other admin:

During your next turn-message, tell me whether you want to keep this
double-blind business going, or if you want me to post everyone\'s
address.  Also let me know if you don\'t want your address given out.
I assume we\'re all friends here, but I won\'t ask why if you don\'t want
anyone else to know your address.


Happly MT\'ing!

During breakfast, on your third day, Adam comes in and starts to
talk (yell?) at everybody:


Well, I guess it\'s about time to move you folks out to the Alcyon.  
First, some announcements:

About ships:
Headquarters informs me that while you can take your own ships, you
do so at their risk.  If your ship is lost, destroyed, or damaged
because of the mission, Turnskaad will not replace it or reimburse
you for it.  We have transportation available if you\'d prefer.  We
will also go to some length to make sure your ships are as ready as
possible before you leave.

Anyone and everyone who wants to take a ship, or a particular grav
carrier full of lab equipment, or whatever that is big and bulky,
see me RIGHT AWAY!  (This means tell the ref so he can figure this
nonsense out :-)

Insurance:
I\'m passing out insurance and salvage agreements today.  You do not
have to fill these out.  However if you do not, salvage is assumed
to belong to Turnskaad fully, rather than leaving you a finders
portion, and Turnskaad is the default beneficiary of your life
insurance.  It really is in your personal interest to fill these
out.

Mission Equipment:
Everyone will be equipped with a TL15 scout-type vacc suit, except
for the members of the security team, who will have armored vacc
suits issued.  We expect everyone on the team to be in continuous
contact, at least in terms of location; all issue vacc suits have
ELT\'s (emergency locator transponders) built in.  The ELT\'s signal
the base ship every 30 minutes and relay your health and location
information.  More details are available if you\'re curious.

TL13 Stun pistol with a variety of drug charges is the standard 
issue sidearm.  You are expected to have this with you at all times, 
loaded.  You will receive some rudimentary training in selecting the
proper drugs to use in various situtations.  Of course, this does
not preclude your wearing or using your favorite sidearm; we just
want you all to have a visible reminder that this is initially a
peaceful mission.

Personal medikits are available from ship\'s stores.  A slightly more
substantial party-sized kit is assigned to each team\'s carrier.

Hand computers (TL15) will be issued to those who do not already
have them.  If you wish to buy one, you can do so at a discount, as
with all personal equipment you purchase for this mission.  (Send me
a list of equipment you wish, together with suggested price from
some book if you have a price.  I will indicate which are assigned,
which are for the ship, and which you need to lease or purchase.
For items to purchase I will assign a disocunt price.  After
everyone has bought what they want, I\'ll tell you how I figured the
discount, if you\'re interested :-).)

Items of a more sensitive nature, such as military-style hardware
are available at our asteroid spaceport.  You will be leaving for
there this afternoon.  (So send in your lists for this stuff, too.)
Of course, further comunications with the outside will be limited
after this, so if you\'ve got any farewells to send, better do it
this morning.


==================================================================
Next part of this turn: You finally get to see the Alcyon
(once I find out how many ships you are bringing along.)

Medical:

	level 1: a good thorough, working knowledge of first aid
	level 2: equivalent to emergency medical technician or nurse
	level 3: equivalent to an intern
	level 4: doctor (U.S. type) or surgeon
	level 5: highly skilled neurosurgeon
	level 6: breaking new ground in medicine
	level 7: Hippocrates :-)

The caveat about U.S. type of doctors is because I don\'t know much
about any other type.  It could be quite different.  Level 4
witch-doctoring or shamanism might be quite useful.

I won\'t argue with your math, or your marvelous grasp of the rules.
I will merely say that your initial premise is total bilge. Has it
ever occurred to anyone that if one preson in ten were a member
of the Imperial Services, the economy would collapse? Let\'s get
realistic here for a minute, folks! It should be equally easy for
one of you rules lawyers/mathematicians out there to estimate the
size of an Imperial Sector Fleet, based on the data in the Reb Sourcebook.
>From that, we can make a decent estimate of the total military strength
of a sector; if there are 1e13 people in a sector, I find it hard to
believe that unless there is a state of open war/draft callup, there
would be more than a hundred million people per sector in the service.
(I have no book s in front of me now; this is an estimate.) I really
think that all of your numbers should be scaled down by, oh, four orders
of magnitude. And not including aging effects is cheating, not to mention 
the fact that in a one-year service (Same Scouts, different rules) it\'s
much easier to get your tail shot off. Harrmph!

Oh, and if these posts were meant in fun, well, hahaha, very jocular.

     What happens if you throw a big chunk of antimatter at a big chunk 
of matter?  The result depends on the impact velocity, and can be 
summarized in the following simple table:

Velocity        Result

Zero            There is a tiny bang and the two chunks bounce away
                from each other essentially intact.
Relativistic    The two chunks interpenetrate, all the particles
                interact, and there is a whopping big explosion.
In between      I dunno, but I\'m willing to make a guess...

     If a chunk of matter contacts a lump of antimatter, there WILL be
an explosion.  Even if the impact velocity is zero, the atoms at the
contact surface will be attracted by Van der Walls forces.  The electrons
and positrons will interact and be destroyed.  The resulting storm of
photons will probably not be enough to overcome the electromagnetic
forces that will suck the protons and anti-protons to their doom.  Shlurp.
Bang.  
     But this interaction will only occur at the contact surface between 
the two chunks.  If the impact velocity of the two chunks falls below some 
critical value, the explosion at the contact surface will push the two
chunks apart before much  damage gets done.
     What, one wonders, is this critical velocity?  
     In general, this is a complex question, and depends on the mass and
shape of the chunks.  The answer is, in fact, in the province of bomb 
design, which deals specifically with the question of how to shape masses 
of explosive  material so that they hold together long enough to explode.
     Fortunately, we are not really interested in the general case.  We 
only want to know what happens when a teeny tiny impactor made from anti-
matter strikes a large, spacecraft-sized, object.  I suspect that in such
a case the critical velocity is the speed of sound within the impactor.  
If the impact velocity is higher than this, the shock wave generated at
the contact surface will not have time to propage and blow the impactor
apart.  
     What, you ask, is the speed of sound in a typical solid?  I don\'t
have the slightest idea.  Nor is it relevant, since the impactor will
be heated to plasma temperatures.  I would guess that the critical 
velocity is somewhere around 100 km/sec.  This is a perfectly reasonable 
number for a railgun projectile, and is about the kind of velocity one 
would need in any case if one hopes to hit a manuvering target with an 
unguided projectile.
     As for the mass of antimatter necessary to wreck a spacecraft, 
note that the interaction of 4 micrograms of antimatter with 4 
micrograms of matter will produce approximately 1.0E+16 ergs, which is
the energy of 200 grams of high explosive.  This is roughly comparable 
to a 30mm cannon shell.  A series of dramatic and realistic experiments, 
conducted over Germany 45 years ago, demonstrated that this was 
sufficient remove a wing from an armoured 20 tonne aircraft.  Four 
milligrams of antimatter is roughly the equivalent of a 500 pound bomb.  
Recent experiments, conducted in the South Atlantic, have demonstrated 
that this is sufficient to destroy a 4000 tonne seagoing warship or a
20,000 tonne seagoing merchant ship.  (It is not always sufficient to 
destroy a 500,000 tonne supertanker.  Make of this what you will.)

     A final interesting question is: \'How much antimatter does it take
to break a planet into little bits a la the DEATH STAR?\'  The answer 
is... LOTS.  
     The gravitational binding energy of the Earth is approximately 
1.0E+33 ergs, give or take an order of magnitude because I\'m working
this out on a piece of scratch paper while I wait for my lousy stinking
solar wind spectral simulation routine to run.  This (the binding energy,
not the simulation routine), is the equivalent of one million tonnes of 
antimatter.  Where, I wonder, did Governer Tarkin get the stuff?  Where 
did he keep it?  In his closet perhaps?  His cleaning service must have 
been surprised.

looked.  Some of us use the enhananced character generation which gives a
higher number of skills that the basic system.  Just looking at the Navy
generation system you have anyone graduating Flight School will have a Pilot of
1-3 max(d6-3,1);  So before the first term is even served they could have a
pilot of three. Now since I am thinking like a player who gets to choose his
skills (when skills like SPACE come up) and we are wanting to see excessives,
we will see just how fast one could get to Pilot-7.

Flight School:    Pilot-3
Basic Training:   2 Rolls on Flight yield 2 pilots for a Pilot-5.
Fourth Year:      1 skill  We can finish the first term with a Pilot-6.

With a max of 4 skills a term after that (unless special duty comes out way) we
could have a Pilot-10 by the end of the second term (third if you count the
acadamy.)

Now this person can do one thing, fly a starship (and do a good job with Ships
Boats as well), but not much else.  With a little luck on Mustering out, our
character would look like:

Pilot-10, Navigation-2, Ships Boat-1, Engineering-1, Vacc Suit-1, Weapon-1
(from Mustering out with 2 weapon rolls).  Pretty lop sided, but none the less
enjoyable.

Now this all is really moot, so lets have fun with it and lets tell some
stories.

I once reffed a player who had a character who was a Pilot-9.

  "Legands say that the Great Pilot, Frey Starhunter, the best pilot in the
universe, could jump a ship into jumpspace from the ground ... And not misjump!"

(BTW: Jump from within 10 Diamaters is Formiadable, 15+ -8 (Max DM) 7+ to
succeed.  Odds are he will make it!!!  DM Note, I would bump it to Impossible
19+ to succeed, that makes it a bit rougher, and he needs an 11 or better,
still possible though.)

(Andy Rooney Voice on)
  Wouldn\'t it be nice ...  If howfar a ship could jump was a function of the
pilots skill?  And wouldn\'t it be nice, if they served more than peanuts during
the flight?

it turns out, they\'re at the starport when the planet is attacked, and,
as luck would have it, there will just happen to be a 1000-ton long haul,
freighter (fueled and ready to go) sitting in the parkbays.  Since the
plan is for the group to snatch the ship to escape becoming POWs, they
will be motivated into ship thievery by the situation, rather than greed.

Assuming that they make it to a safer haven (read, different system), and
assuming that the original captain and crew met with unsavory ends back
on the embattled planet (as Ref, I can safely make this assumption :-)),
is there a legal way for the PCs to permanently acquire the ship?  Be
advised that I\'m not sure yet whether I actually want them to, but should
the situation present itself, I\'d like to have some details ready.

So, compare this to a group of people fleeing the Nazis in WWII by stealing
a boat on the French coast and making it to England.  Do the english arrest
them for boat-napping, or do they say, "Right, it\'s your boat from now on,
an\' don\' let anybody tell you otherwise!"

Well, obviously I don\'t know the answer to this one.  HEEELLLPPP!!

The original number SHOULD have been 36 Kt, NOT 200 Kt.  So if the
REAL answer is a 0.36 Kt detonation (that\'s 360 tons of TNT, boys and

if it goes off INSIDE their hull!!  It\'ll still hurt plenty!  The specific

"Pressure, heat flux, and energy" of the energy of a tornado to that
of the Hiroshima bomb.

I like the idea of allowing characters to have more than one service in their
background.  Most of the time though, players complain that they don\'t have
enough control over their character\'s development.  I refer, of course, to
the skill selection system.  How do you folks handle this?  I seem to
recall a point-based character generation system for Traveller in an *old*
issue of _Dragon_ (back when I still read it), that allowed players to buy
skills using points.  I\'ve been having the players roll for which subtable
to select their skills from, and letting them have their pick from that.

For example, if a Scout character could choose from the Scout life, Field
Service, or Exploration subtables, I would have him roll for which table to
pick a skill from, i.e. if he rolled and came up with the Field Service
table, he could freely select a skill from there.  It seems to be a
reasonable compromise.  Any suggestions?

Hmm.  Perhaps the estimate is high, but "total bilge"?  Please correct me if
I\'m wrong, but I believe the good ol\' U.S.ofA. has a total armed forces
payroll of around 2 million bodies, or about 2/300 of the total U.S.
population.  This would only change the estimates in question by 1 order of
magnitude, and certainly wouldn\'t invalidate the premise that the existing
rules make it abnormally easy for player characters to get high skill levels.

The problem is that the probability of getting skill level n + 1, given skill
level n, should be O(1/n) rather than the O(1) function it is now.  This
would make the probability of getting skill level n from scratch roughly
O(log(n)), which would make the suggestion of an earlier poster make sense,
by making the skill level be roughly the *log* of the actual "amount of
skill".  If the constants were chosen correctly, there might still be some
Pilot-9s in the universe, but there would be many orders of magnitude more
Pilot-7s.

On the other hand, I had always assumed that the rules were the way they were
to make player characters more interesting, and that they didn\'t apply to the
population as a whole.  To put it another way, if I used the character
generation system described above, I would probably throw away most of my
characters as "too boring", and the existing generation system just
"pre-throws-away" most, but not all "boring" characters.

I\'m sure I will be liberally corrected on all of the above.

  Hmm.  OK, time to dig out the GURPS books I guess.  The easiest way to
approach this would seem to be to check out the descriptions of various
skill levels, and work from there.
  In GURPS, level 12 in a skill is described as that of a talented
beginner, or an average man after a little study.  I don\'t think this
translates to Traveller skill 2 - level 1 maybe, but not 2.  Looking
further down the table we see that a "veteran" fighter (one with
experience, but not a lot of it) has a skill of ^15.  This leads to
the following rolls/percentages for different tasks:

        Simple    : Roll 16, 98.1% (as a roll of 17+ always fails)
        Routine   : Roll 15, 95.4%
        Difficult : Roll 12, 74.1%
        Formidable: Roll 9,  37.5%
        Impossible: Roll 3,  0.5%

  This seems to be in keeping with how I see Traveller skill level 2 -
although the chance for the Impossible task is perhaps a little on the
low side.
  Someone with a *lot* of experience will have a skill level of about
18, thus adding 3 to all the above rolls.  Thus, he will succeed at an
Impossible task about 9.3% of the time.  This, to me, seems like the
sort of skill level I would give someone with Traveller skill of 3.
  A Master, as described in GURPS, has skill 20.  He will succeed in the
Impossible task about 25.9% of the time.  Sounds like Traveller level 4
to me.
  A Wizard (described as someone who could fight blindfolded) has a
skill of 25.  This gives him a 83.8% chance at succeeding at the
Impossible task - Traveller skill 5, at a minimum.

  It is possible under the GURPS rules to have levels even higher than
this, although the cost of such levels is usually prohibitive, at least
for the Physical skills, such as Combat, Piloting etc.  I don\'t think
it\'s really necessary to go beyond level 25 for the purposes of looking
at the task system - much further, and the person attempting the skill
roll can do virtually anything 98.1% of the time (not 100%, as noted in
the table above.)
  All the above comparisons are based on the description of combat
skills found on page 45 of the GURPS Basic Set, Third Edition.  They
seem to fit the task levels presented fairly well to me, although
different people would of course need to alter them to fit with the
overall levels of skill found in their campaign.

Sayonara,
       Derek.

Hardly, They could claim that they found it, though, but it will be hard to
legally clear them of the suspicions that *they* killed the crew in the
general confusion.
A starship is almost never unowned, If it isn\'t owned by a person, it is owned
by a corporation, or an Imperial Agency (IMC, IN, IISS etc), or by the system
govenment, or by an insurance company, or by the heirs of the previous owner
(this last case is the one that is most apliccable in your case) 

If they want to keep the ship, they would have to act as if it was stolen, ie
get it registerd under a new name, fix all id\'numbers, and, most difficult,
fix the transponder...

If they steal somebodys cargoship, that somebody (or his company, or his bank,
or his creditors, or his family) is going to be mightily cross with them.

If they steal a german military (or ex-french military) boat then the English
government would take the boat from them and give it to the RN.

Just my quarter credits worth.

I have one suggestion for helping those merchants make their mortgages:

RAISE PRICES!!

So what if the books say a high passage costs kCr10, and a low passage
is kCr1 (I think)?  Altering the prices by a few thousand either way isn\'t
going to hurt anybody, is it?  Besides, this would introduce the effect of
having passages to the "smaller" worlds costing more than passages to
major worlds, which seems realistic to me.  Unfortunately, figuring out
what to charge for passages could become quite complicated, because of
having to figure in current interest rates, salaries, and prices.

The players would also have to worry about the competition from other,
large well-established lines with many ships (Tukera, Oberlindes), and
economies of scale on their side, which would probably keep them off
of the major trade routes.  Oh well, that\'s life...

Hello all,

Andrew\'s posting of his grav bike design inspired me to dig this out.  It\'s
a design for a ship\'s surgical robot.  I designed it to be a static unit for
emplacement in the ship\'s infirmary.  The patient is placed *inside* the
unit for diagnosis and treatment.  It\'s similar to the automed in _2300_.  I
thought it would handy for PCs to have around, as PCs tend to have nasty
things happen to them.  I used _Book 8: Robots_ to build this:


  Static robotic surgical unit -- "autodoc" 	

 URP:  D1300 - 06 - LM221 - TF53	Cr 235,800.00	550 kg

	Fuel: -		Duration: -	TL: 12

  600/1500  (mesh)
  2 light arms
  2 very light arms
  2 very light tentacles
  2 visual sensors ( + tele ), 6 tactile sensors ( + sensitivity )
  2 audio sensors
  Power interface
  Voder
  Video display
  Medical instrument pkg  x 2
  Medical - 3

You plug it into a ship\'s power supply or equivalent.  That\'s why there\'s
nothing down for fuel or duration.  Hope everybody likes it.

    'body' => 'Well, I need help again.  I downloaded a file containing (supposedly) all
the sector and subsector names (for the Imperium) from GEnie last week,
and I\'m not sure that I trust the data.  Specifically, the list of subsector
names given for Deneb are as follows:

      (A) Pretoria      (B) Lamas       (C) Antra       (D) Million
      (E) Sabine        (F) Inar        (G) Dunmag      (H) Atsah
      (I) Star Lane     (J) Vincennes   (K) Usani       (L) Geniishir
      (M) Gulf          (N) Zeng        (O) Kamlar      (P) Vast Heavens

However, in "The Spinward Marches Campaign" Sourcebook, the sector map
of the Marches shows the names of the Deneb subsectors immediately
adjacent to the Marches to be "(A) Gulf", "(E) Star Lane", "(I) Sabine",
and "(M) Pretoria".  So, the list shown above would appear to be
upside-down (or worse).

What are the correct subsector names?

Second question:  Where can I find a current list of the X-boat routes
in Deneb (or any other, for that matter) sector.  So far, the only current
routes I know of, are for Corridor sector (I got them from issue #18 of
Travellers\' Digest).

If there\'s not an official list, do I just play "connect-the-dots" with all
of the class A and B starports?

I had a problem the other night with my group of players.  What happened
was one of them was being an idiot on a law level 2 world.  He wanted
information, and was going about it the wrong way.  He got his right
forearm blown off, hand and all.  There was a hospital around, so he was
taken there.  I\'ve always been under the assumption that hospitals do
emergency cases first, and worry about payment later.

Well, they fixed up his arm (I assumed tech level 10 could put a robotic
appendage on) and were looking for payment, either immediately, or in
some kind of payment contract.  The problem is, he WAS a general in the
Army, before he retired.  Would he have some kind of Veterens insurance
(for just such a thing) or would he be on his own with payment?  Since
he didn\'t have anything specific, I offered a payment plan.  He didn\'t
want to sign, and generally made a nuisance out of himself. (Remember
this is LL2) I had the cops arrest him.  He was still a pain in the ass,
so the Cops (unsavory fellows) executed him.

What should I have done?  What would you have done?

Thanks,

I got an answer telling me that the PDT weapon can either be used for
PDT or standard combat in any given round, but not both.  What I still
need to know is: If the weapon is used from PDT, does in automatically
succeed?  Isn\'t there a roll for TOTAL/PARTIAL/NO success?  If it auto-
matically succeeds, then it seems way too powerful to me.

What\'s the straight scoop, guys?

On the subject of insurance; it is available, but (a) it only covers illness
and injury (no elective surgery) and (b) rates for people who list their
occupation as "high-risk, high-pay adventurer" are also high.  Actually, 
what I usually do is assume that the government looks into your credit
history and will help you out if you cannot pay your medical bills.  If
you can pay your medical bills, hospitals usually run about 5000 CR/week
(between $500 and $1000 in modern American money).  Oddly, no one in my
game world has ever asked about insurance.

As for your specific problem...

   1) As a veteran, the character might have had some kind of special
insurance options.  On the other hand, even if they did pay, they might
take a while, and the character might be temporarilly responsible for
his or her medical bills.  I think that, right now, you only have health
insurance from the military while you are IN the military, although you
can get special rates from some companies when you are out.

  2) Since your character was being a pain, you might have warned him--
"General Goof, make an Intelligence roll."  "I rolled an 11."  "You get
the distinct feeling that if you continue to hassle these well-armed
peace officers that they will take advantage of the local low law level
and blow your fucking head off."--before you executed him, but I assume
you probably did something like that.  (Since it is a game, you are
allowed to use creative clue devices--I had one friend who, when we were
totally lost, had us receive telegrams or notes tied to rocks that were
thrown through our window.)

  3) If your character continued to be a pain after you warned him about
possible consequences, you have three options.  1) Kill him on the spot,
either by having the NPCs do it or by just saying "You\'re pissing me off,
so you have a fatal heart attack.  Go home."  2) Give him what he wants,
if it something minor, and write it off.  3) Give him what he wants, and
then have him die in some unrelated way near the end of the adventure--
"I don\'t know, General Goof, the bad guys just keep rolling your number
when they are selecting targets; maybe it\'s because you look like a leader."

Basically, the point is to have fun, but it is your game, too.  If a
character is being a total idiot, and you have warned him about it, it is
his own fault if he keeps on irritating you and/or other players and/or
NPCs that you are trying to run realistically, and gets himself shot.  NPCs
are like people, some of them are stupid, ill-tempered, and so on, and you
should not screw around with them.  Of course, sometimes a player is okay,
but has chosen to run a somewhat eccentric character, but then they usually
accept the risks, and are usually smart enough to take your hints if they
are going too far.

As a final note, I just want to say that I do not like situations where I
feel like I have to kill someone\'s character.  Fortunately, my players can
usually tell when my decision on something is final and they generally do
not push things.  On the rare occasions when a player is being an ass, 
other players usually off him before I have to do anything about it: "But
this is simply not the blah blah blah blah blah."  "Mark, Alan is being a
jerk, so I\'m shooting him in the head."  "Okay, roll two dice."  "I rolled
a 9, and my high Dexterity makes that an 11."  "Alan, Jeff is drawing on
you, make an inititive roll."  "I rolled a 7."  "Uh oh, Jeff will get the
first shot, and he has Pistol skill at +4."  And so on.

Take care all.

Well this is my interpretation of point defense rules which like quite a 
few other things seem to have been left out of MT even though they decide
to leave meaningless charts of neat things with no explanations. Could
it be that s-one from \'Judges Guild \'
arrggg editors.
actually is sabotaging GDW :-)



First of all point defense targetting modules are standard only on ship
type hardpoints. Those that take 13.5+ kl etc. So I think it is misleading
to assume PA-11 is mounted hardpoint. As it is considered a gun and not
a hardpoint.

In \'vehicle\' design you have to specify which weapon the  PDF module is
to be used for. Multiple weapons require multiple modules.
Anyway here\'s the scoop on PDF. This is from \'Striker\' but apparently
seems valid for MT as most Striker stuff does.

A weapon with Point Defense Fire(PDF) module can do 3 separate missions.
1. Normal fire. Uses normal fire rules but ignores enemy movement DMs due
to its superior fire control. Nasty against those high speed Zho ground
speeders.
2. Overwatch. Weapon may engage any indirect fire rounds.
3. Dedicated support. PDF locks on to specific person or vehicle and tries
to follow its movement. Any missiles, rockets and indirect fire against
supported unit  within 100m of it may be engaged by PDF unit.

These missions are mutually exclusive. For overwatch and dedicated support
all non-grav vehicles must be stationary due to the high accuracy required.


Against Direct Fire:
 Unit must see last 150m of weapons trajectory. Unit rolls as per normal fire
No movement DMs. Any hit destroys one round. If multiple hits, owner may
(of PDF) chooses which rounds to take out. So if u have 4 missiles inbound
and you hit 3 times, u pick which three.

Against Indirect Fire:
 You roll the following number of dice to hit inbound artillery fire based
on TL of  PDF module:
	TL-9:4
	TL-10:6
	TL-11:8
	TL-12:10
	TL-13:12 
	TL-14:14
	TL-15:16
This is the number of artillery rounds destroyed.
>From each die subtract PDF TL-Art round TL. E.g TL-10 rolls 6 die against
artillery fire. 4 are dedicated to a TL-15 artillery barrage and 2 are
assigned to a TL-10 barrage. There is no modifier to TL-10 barrage but there
is a -5 to EACH die fired against TL-15 barrage.

As MRL\'s overload  defenses by firing within a short period of time(what about
rapid fire M-D guns??Hmm)  divide the numbers of rounds destroyed by 2.

This leads us to the other question. How the hell do u use artillery?
If anyone is interested I\'ll post it. Otherwise I hope this clears up most of
the mess. Most units don\'t have to worry about indirect fire anyway.

That Gram grav-tank is real nasty with its PA on direct fire. Makes mince 
meat of a few Imp \'Trepida\'s(what a wimpy name for a tank!)

    In response to a not-so recent post:
	In my various campaigns, cross-enlistment is an extremely
viable option.  After mustering out from one service, each player
has the option to enlist in another.  The player rolls for 
enlistment, but with a DM-1 per term served.  Thus a player in
his sixth term would have a -6 adjustment to his enlistment roll.
If the roll is still made, (or a 12 is rolled and I\'m feeling nice)
the player is considered as a normal recruit in his first term. 
The player is still subject to retirement after his seventh term, 
total time, but is otherwise is treated as if he had enlisted in his
first term.  I also apply other negative DMs if the character has
some sort of handicap or serious injury.
    
    Some fuel for a new fire:
	What happens when a player (using the extended generation) 
reaches rank 6, and gets promoted?  Any thoughts?  My solution was
to make the person the head of the service in question.  Unfortunately
for me, he tried to change the seven term retirement rule.  A die roll
later, he retired.  End of problem.
	Another thought.  What do you do when a character becomes a
Duke?  How do you handle his lands, etc.?  My solution is ongoing...

Trivial and very poxy and not at all useful unless you are actually using the

In message #1085, Mark F. Cook asks about subsector names in the Deneb
sector.  The discrepancy he describes is one that has been hanging
around for many years.
 
Supplement 11 (Library Data N-Z) featured a sector map of the Spinward
Marches in which the adjacent subsectors of Deneb were listed in reverse
order to the way they had previously been shown in Supplement 3 (The
Spinward Marches).  The Sup.11 map has since appeared in a number of
other places (including the MegaTraveller Players\' Handbook).  I don\'t
have a copy of the Spinward Marches Campaign sourcebook - would I be
right in thinking it uses the same map again?
 
So which is correct, Sup.3 or Sup.11?  I believe the answer can be found
in the Atlas of the Imperium.  The Atlas doesn\'t show subsectors, but
it *does* have some important evidence.  If you examine Deneb sector
you will see a world named Pretoria (sector location 0406, which puts
it in subsector A) and one named Vincennes (1122, which puts it in
subsector J).  It seems like a good bet that these worlds would be
found in the subsectors of the same name.  If this is the case then
Sup.3 and GEnie have got it right, and Sup.11 and the SMC book are
in error.
 
Sorry, Mark, I don\'t have any info on X-boat routes.  Just join the
dots ... your players won\'t know the difference. :-)
Come to think of it, I doubt that any data on X-boat routes would be
entirely reliable in these troubled times - this week\'s X-boat route
is next week\'s Vargr territory!

This week, the physical scientists have been arguing over 
whether grav devices will work if the ring has insubstantial
mass, and no gravitics of its own.  

The speculation as to just where R-alpha is is dying down, 
probably only for a little while.

Everyone is getting in huge equipment lists, and we only have
one soul brave enough to risk his own ship.  I won\'t say who -
you try to deduce it.  :-)

Anyway, the details of the turn, and other PBEM stuff I\'m actually
trying to get out on mail this week.  Wait until Friday.  If you don\'t
see the turn info, an alias file, and a second turn file (a lot to
say this week), THEN write me.  Hopefully by then I\'ll have gleaned
most of the bouncers out.

Hi, all.

Please change any alias files or whatever that have my VMS address, the
one from which I sent this note, in them. I\'m trying to move most of my
non-thesis-related newsfeeds and mail to my UNIX account, for political
reasons best not discussed here. My new address, which James is already 
using, is:

mpmst1@unix.cis.pitt.edu

If there are any problems with this address, please notify me HERE. I
can still get mail here; I just strongly prefer not to.

thanks,

metlay

PS. Could someone send me an alias file for the PBEM game, like Richard 
mailed out to all players? In fact, I\'d appreciate a copy of the message
he mailed to everyone... We\'ve determined that I\'m reaching him, but that
everything he sends me just vanishes. Argh. Of course, with double-blind

It would be easy to construct a robot with a NAS, IR optics and a large

I wasn\'t going to comment about the first reply, but since this one came
I thought I\'d explain my reasoning and give some more comments.

The 1 in 10 came about by the following reasoning:
Every character tries to enlist in their preferred service, the enlistment
rolls can fail and if the character does fail to enlist they are subject to
a draft in an armed service (which is nice and uniformly distributed).
I took a wild guess about the chance of failing enlistment,  I was probably
incorrect.  But according to the rules I think that 1 in 36 must fail their
enlistment roll and it is quite likely that more will do so.  They will be
subject to the draft.

BTW: What proportion of the population had been/or is in the armed forces when
	there was drafting??  I suspect it was quite a bit higher than 1 in 10.

If this is happening then I take back this and my previous posting, since they
are obviously incorrect.

My assumption that dead characters retired in the previous term will also make
a difference to the results, I am unsure as to how much.  This assumption made
the calculations a lot simpler.

My other assumption as to ignoring aging effect is valid, since the average
time spent in the serive in very short.  The probability of staying in the
scouts until aging takes effect is very low.  I also ignored increases in
character stats due to skill rolls.  These are more likely to have an effect,
but any effect they have will increase the chance of high skill levels.



I might also comment: in Classic Traveller Supplement #1  1001 Characters there
were two instances of Scientists with Computer-8.  Hows that for chance.

I think you are right about the effect of psi shielding on a NAS.  A telepath
with a shield active should be undetectable by a NAS.  (Or a standard NAS at
least- the referee may have access to some amazing TL(Big Number) equipment
that his pesky players won\'t know about...   ;^)

About the Killer Anti-Psi \'bots.  I don\'t think this is a good dodge for the
"official" anti-psi elements, at least for two reasons:

1)      Only Telepaths have that natural psi shield.  Not all psionics are
        Telepaths.

2)      "Normal" citizens wearing technological psionic shields would be
        subject to very annoying attacks but these A-P \'bots.  Considering that
        a non-psi citizen wearing a psi shield is likely to be rich/important
        or both, this might be a real bad move on the Imperium\'s part.


        "High Governor Smith-Davies was attacked today by a warbot in his
         office at the Palace.  Preliminary investigation indicates that the
         warbot was of a type used exclusively by the Imperial Navy.

        The Imperial trade delegation was immediately expelled."


Please note, however, that any number of anti-psionic elements (including our
own metlay) might construct one or more such \'bots just to get at the nasty
psionic persons.  Insert here your favorite Mad-scientist plotlines...

Well, the morning finally arrives.  During the evening, several people
went to town, and have returned in various states of dissolution and
disrepair.  Surprisingly though, no one is grumbling except about a 
perceived inability to continue their excess onto the mission.


The engineeres , most notably Bhyarravouf, are getting incredibly 
irritable at not geting their paws on the Alcyon yet.  They have had 
to console themselves with once agina reviewing their flight
manuals and hoping for something truly interesting.

The physical sientists have started to agree that gravitics are 
likely to work once you arrive, but the arrival is going to be quite
tricky.  The transport team hasn\'t mentioned any concern over approaches
yet.

The bioscience and medical team has inventoried their material and 
requested a few long-term survival items.

The security team has requested just about everything ever created and
pleaded for more troops and more explosive punch.  Which is more dangerous,
a morose soldier or a happy soldier?

- ----
Briefing:  (Adam speaks)

When you arrive at our asteroid base this afternoon, you will understand
part of our need for tight security.  Everyone of you seems quite anxious
to get on with this, and frankly, I wish I were going with you.  However,
we need to get this out of the way:

If anyone wants out now, see me before you lift.  No questions will be
asked, and it will not affect any recommendation you ask from us.  You
will receive your full pay up to this point.  (3 days?)

Some of you have already met Mr. Adrian Bishop.  Adrian is a reporter, and
I know some of you are not too thrilled about having him along.  Never-
theless, we and you *need* and accurate permanent record of whatever 
happens, and when and how it happens.  In some ways, his record might
just be the most permanent affect of this whole undertaking.  Anyway,
please try to co-operate with him.  If you can\'t find a way to bring
yourself to co-operate, at least act civilly, please.

I can\'t give you a briefing on the Alcyon here, but you will receive a
full briefing on her as soon as you dock space-side.

Good luck.

- ----

So, you all get into the shuttle and head out to the asteroid belt.  It\'s
about a ten hour trip.  The pilots recognize that the approach, while made
quite smoothly, is manual not automatic, and is deceptively tricky (it 
seems simpler by far than it really is).  You who have brought ships are 
halted near a concentration of asteroids and asked if you would please 
allow them to hook on with tugs for the final part of the trip.

The reason for the tugs becomes apparant as you enter the cluster.  For 
those on the shuttle, you\'ll get to see it when you disembark.  In a 
parllel orbit is an enormous, spider-like tetrahedron.  In the center
of the tetrahedron is what seems to be a large engine-like structure.
This center engine is roughly 400 tons (volume) in its own right.

The engine faces one apex, with exhaust through the center of one of
the tetrahedron\'s faces.  Each of the four apexes connects to the 
central engine, as well as to each of the other three corners with 
strong structural members.  A fine mesh covers the front three faces
of the tetrahedron, and most of the rear face.  At the front 
of the Alcyon is a bridge and crew compartment.  The other three apexes
are obviously reserved for ships to connect to.  

The fine mesh is the Alcyon\'s lanthanum grid.  Beneath the grid, and 
well connected to all eight of the structural beams are bags of some
strong, light weight, material.  These seem to be collapsible fuel bags.
Presently they float limply, about half full.

Several figures in vacc suits labor about the Alcyon even now, preparing 
her for flight.

`Rocky\'s Revenge\'.  For the next day and a half, it\'s home.  You
are scheduled for launch in roughly 36 hours, and there appear to
be no bugs in the schedule.

(Julanna is ~160 cm tall, lithe and muscular.  She has shoulder length
 auburn hair, accented with silver and green stripes.  She wears an
 issue TL15 jumpsuit and the `nerd-pack\' kind of hand computer.  Her
 features are soft, and the eyes bright.  One eye is bright blue, the
 other reddish-brown.  Your overall impression is of an extremely
 bright, well-conditioned humanoid who is just a little, well, 
 deviant.)

Tonight, the three ships you brought will be attached to the Alcyon
for the jump to R-alpha.  You have (she eyes her notes) two scout
ships and a merchant -- all streamlined it says here.  Good.  There
is a 200T cargo bay on the Alcyon in addition to what is on your ships.
Most of the heavy equipment requested for this trip is already on board.

You might want to do some cargo shuffling tomorrow, so that your merchant
ship can carry some of the larger items down without having to shift 
cargo after you arrive.

The Alcyon is a jump tender.  A little more advanced in some ways than
the traditional ones, though.  Access ways are provided between each of
the ships and the central core.  One ship\'s location has been replaced
by bridge, computing, and life support for a small crew.  Enough fuel
should be on board to provide two jump 5\'s without refueling.  You might
be able to stretch that with some tinkering with your ships and so forth
in an emergency.

Only a very minimal maneuver drive is available on the Alcyon herself.
Just enough to keep her oriented, not really enough to accelerate or
fend off any serious gravity.  The software is installed to use your
ship\'s engines for this, though.  {ref: OK transport crew - how much
acceleration we gonna get?}

Likewise, the Alcyon is pretty defensless without your ships.  Only a
double laser turret and a sand caster up front.  There just isn\'t any
good place to put a hard point that won\'t damage the Alcyon more than 
whatever you\'re firing at.

Overall, what this means is that with the Alcyon you\'ve got range and
speed over interstellar distances.  But you\'ve got to rely on each 
your own ships for some of the work.  Likewise, it means that wherever
you go, you get there together; no party scattering due to misjumps.
Once you\'re there, your navigators will quickly figure out where you
are, and in a pinch, you can scuttle the Alcyon more cheaply than
a `real\' ship and bug out individually.  

Master Seargent Fallow will show you all to your quarters.  You should
find most or all of the personal equipment you requested waiting for 
you.

Tomorrow morning, all personnel, except physicians, are to report to
room AA38-Port for emergency first aid training at 08:00 standard.  
Doctors are to report to room F622-Port for instruction in the selection
and use of various drugs for stun gun use with varying genotypes.
Breakfast is from 06:00 to 07:30; the central computer will assist you
in finding the mission mess.

After lunch tomorrow, all engineering and transport personnel are to
report the simulation chamber for initial training in the Alcyon\'s 
systems.  All security personnel are to report to the armory for 
Battle dress fitting, adjustment, and initial training.  Science
and generalist teams have a ringworld theory and introduction class
in the main auditorium.

The material covered in most of these sessions will be available in
holocrystals, for you to use while in flight, in case you have to miss
them.  Count Ger may have other duties for you.

Good evening.

Hey folks!

Mail to my machine is going to be slightly messed up for a while.   The 
routing information for my machine changed and the AT&T gateway may not 
know about it for a while yet.   

Don\'t abandon hope, though, I keep trying!

The Jlian Protectorate may be spoken of at some length in one of the
arcane bits of text floating around GEnie or the HIWG, thanks to some
bright boy at GDW or DGP, but it has never been mentioned anywhere
in the main rules set other than as a historical place (see the Rebellion
sourcebook for background on the Julian conflict, I believe) and as the
political backup for the first two years of Brzk\'s reign.

In reply to Bertil, the rules state that the natural psi shield allows the
telepath to shield his/her mind from unwanted interferance. This could be
a very clever and subtle process whereas the psi shield is a dumb, artificial
copy. Perhaps you could liken it this; a natural shield is like a wire fence,
cant get in but you can see in (ie the NAS can \'see in\') but the artificail 
shield
is like a solid 30\' high wall. They both keep unwanted interferance out, but
in different ways.

Another thought occurred to me during my psionics campaign that I\'m currently
running, is wouldnt it be in the interests of psi shield manufacturers to keep
the fear of psionics high just to protect their product line? Especially if
it was becoming a fashion accessory. It would only take a bit of advertising;
"Thinking of buying a psi-shield? THEY already know about it!" to stir up a
bit more public opposition.

Hi

Thanks to all those who responded to my question about the use of 
portable IBM PC\'s (and clones) during a game. I enclose two poxy 
programs to which I use in addition to the npc generator and name
generator programs from the archive-server. The first is i simple prog
to expand a planets upp to a full description (just to save you looking
it up) and the second determiones weapon availability based on tech/law
level of the world your on.

These programs are written by me and are TOTALLY USELESS ! 

(unless you are running them during the game.)


I compiled them using TurboC v2.0 but they are so trivial they would
require little (or no) conversion.

Anybody still got anymore ideas of useful programs to run DURING a game?

Thanks for the programs.  They may prove useful (though I don\'t have a
portable) I may try to borrow one from work on weekends.

>Anybody still got anymore ideas of useful programs to run DURING a game?

I am working on a program (written mostly in Turbo Pascal) that displays the
planet you are on and all systems within jump 4 on a hex grid map that is very
close to the Traveller Sector/Subsector maps.  I use colors a little
differently and I don\'t have names on the map, but listed down the side.  The
system you are on stays in the center of the screen :-).  Any way, you enter
the hex you are travelling to and it expands the UWP to an expanded description
(not quite as far as yours took it) and it generated cargo for the trip and
such.

I am working on the encounter (both animal and person) and an improved trade
system.  Parts of these such as the animal encounter program are written in
turbo C to be stand alone.  I plan to pipe the output to temp files to be read
in my the master Pascal program..

The BAD THING about this software is that because of the map requirements I
had to use 640x480 16 color mode (though not much is lost in mono).  This will
keep many portables from running it.  I am looking a a means to reduce the
requirements to EGA, but then I just say why, have anyone that wants it upgrade
to VGA anyway (if IBM can do it so can I :-)  )

I may make this a commercial product, though in all probablility, I will
release it to this list as a BETA test (its what you get for being cool dudes).
I have no estimates on it\'s release but it is pretty close.....

on my sensibilities.
 
The section on thrusters says that the thruster plates must be rigidly
fixed pointing in one direction, usually towards the aft end of the ship.
If you try to apply thrust in any other direction, the amount you can
get is severely limited.  The upshot of this is that ships generally have
to come in to land nose-upwards and flip horizontal at the last moment.
Similarly, if you want to hover for more than a short period you have
to do it nose-upwards.
 
This strikes me as a very clumsy and ungainly way for a high-tech starship
to behave.  As a remedy, I propose that it should be possible for more
advanced thruster plates (say, TL 14+) to rotate around a port-starboard
axis.  This would have the following benefits:
 
(1) The plates could be directed towards the belly of the ship to
    facilitate lateral attitude takeoff/landing/hovering.
 
(2) The plates could be directed towards the forward end of the ship
    to enable some serious deceleration without having to flip the
    whole ship around.
 
Is this a good idea, or a silly idea, or am I the only one who cares?

***********

I recently received a rather interesting piece of mail from a TML reader who 
asked to be kept anonymous. He beseeched me, in my capacity as TML historian
and fount of all knowledge Travellerish, to answer a question that had been
bothering him for a long time: put as delicately as possible, how well 
endowed are Aslan and Vargr women? He\'d had his curiosity piqued by
conflicting representations in works by various "official" Traveller artists,
and was hoping that I could shed some official light on the subject. Well, I
can\'t; GDW and DGP, for reasons of public good taste, avoid any but the most
basic discussions of sexuality in their materials. But if people trust my
judgement and the logical arguments I\'ll use below, then we can probably
consider what I\'m about to say as "official," and someone with more guts than
I have can send it to DGP or something. |-> 

Anyway, my logic is as follows. The closest thing to a discussion of sexuality
among the Vargr and the Aslan (the two races under serious consideration here)
that we have had to date is the TRAVELLERS\' DIGEST article on children, and on 
information on marital patterns in older rule books. The chaos in Vargr 
society as a whole tells us nothing, but the male/female ratio in Aslan 
society and the prevalent polygamy in Aslan ekho (family) structure indicates
a long-standing need for several females to be sexually associated with one 
male, so as to assure the maximum number of offspring per year and per 
available healthy male. This would tend to hint at a small litter size, and in 
fact the TD article bears this out; Aslan mothers give birth to only one child 
at a time, after long gestation periods, and twinning is not unknown but is 
rarer than it is among humans. The TD article also tells us what we need to 
know about Vargr pregnancy; the mother gives birth to a litter of up to six 
pups, and the experience of pregnancy, whelping, and rearing/weaning leaves 
her bedridden for several years. Based on my knowledge of the Vargr ancestors
(which I\'ve raised and bred all my life), I believe I can realistically fill 
in the missing details here.

Aslan women have two breasts, bilaterally symmetric in much the same fashion 
as human women. They change size only slightly with the rhythms of the 
female\'s sexual cycles, as do those of human women, and pregnancy and nursing
increase these changes for a period of one to two years. There is no need for 
any more than these, as there are never more than two kits to feed. Because of 
the torso strength of the female\'s upper body, and the occasional perogative 
to take over the rearing of the kits belonging to another female in the ekho 
who is dies in childbirth or is killed soon after birthing, the breasts are 
always in a state where proper stimulation can encourage lactation after a 
short delay (several days), and do not shrink substantially with disuse. This 
picture is borne out in the early drawings of Aslan women by William Keith
and David Dietrick (refer to the front cover art of Alien Module 1 for a 
perfect example of the female Aslan). The only counterexample, and in my
opinion a glaring failure in continuity on the part of DGP, was the drawing of
the female Aslan guide in the recent adventure on Kusyu in TD, where she is 
depicted as having four breasts. This oversight can easily be attributed to 
William Keith\'s astounding lack of continuity in drawing in the past; he has 
drawn anatomically perfect Aslan in many cases (FAR TRAVELLER magazine\'s
early issues, and the introduction of the Aslan in old JTAS), but is also 
guilty of terrible oversights (ALIEN REALMS, the Alien adventure module set 
from GDW, contains several hideously distorted Aslan pictures, where the poor
creatures are depicted as having human hands!). This one erroneous artist\'s
depiction aside, then, the question is settled for the Aslan.

The Vargr present a more difficult puzzle, however. Only one, count\'em, ONE
female Vargr has ever been drawn in any Traveller publication, and that is
Gharukh, the cryptographer of THE TRAVELLER ADVENTURE, as drawn by Liz 
Danforth, David Dietrick and Brad Foster. (Refer to the many drawings of
Gvoudzon, the ex- Corsair gadabout, in the same book, or to ALIEN REALMS or
many other places, for representation of male Vargr.) Her clothing was such
that little or nothing of her anatomy was visible, and the confusion among the 
many artists who draw for Traveller as to how the bone structure of the Vargr 
torso is to be represented makes matters confusing. The crux of the puzzle is 
as follows: the Vargr was an obvious genetic alteration of the dog toward the 
model of the human. Its arms are human. Its legs, tail, and head are canine.
But what is its torso? Artists are split down the middle on the matter; the 
anatomical drawings in Alien Module 3 distinctly represent the torso and 
ribcage of the Vargr as being the narrow design of a dog\'s chest, and it is 
this interpretation that I favor, as do artists like Donna J. Barr. However, 
many artists have drawn Vargr as having human torsos and abdominal 
musculature, which strikes me as ludicrous in consideration of the rest of 
their bodies, particularly the legs and tail. So let me base the rest of my 
argument on the assumption that the arrangement of the Vargr torso and organs 
follows that of the Terran dog. The female dog has two rows of teats, several 
on a side. This allows for large litters of pups to be fed simultaneously.
However, the presence of so much excess weight when there are no pups to be
fed is detrimental to the female\'s survival in the wild; hence the size and
functionality of the mammary glands is directly linked to advanced pregnancy
and the years immediately thereafter. The female\'s weight can increase by up
to 50% as her body prepares for the task of feeding eight hungry pups; is it
any wonder why she is too exhausted to move from her bed for any length of
time? But when she is not expecting or has recently birthed, the glands shrink
to invisibility. A healthy female Vargr who is not expecting can not be told
from a male merely upon inspection of the torso; her fur hides what little
structure remains. I am sure that a Vargr could tell the difference, but that
is not a matter for discussion here. 

I apologize for the longwindedness of this discussion, but I wanted to be as 
precise in my terminology as possible. Consider this a plea for more careful 
continuity in Traveller art; the question never would have arisen if people
had taken a little bit more care, and had been a bit less prudish, in the 
past.

The frightening part of all of this is that DGP is about to release some new 
Alien books, in which these conclusions are likely to be ignored or carelessly 
refuted, and we can look forward to a long spell of trying to reconcile some
basically contradictory and silly views of races in whose essential realism
we would like to believe. Oh, well....

Does anyone have any experience with a co-refereed campaign?  By this I mean
one campaign being actively run by two referees.  For the purposes of this
question, let\'s exclude hand-me-down campaigns and campaigns that switch off
between two referees.  I\'m looking for a situation where two people run a
campaign together: co-delevopment, etc.

If you have any related non-Traveller experience (like another game system),
I\'m still interested.

The reason I ask, is that I have a very stable (but not quite stagnent) group
of players, and over the years I have switched off being "the supreme being"
with one of the other players.  We have switched back and forth several times
over the years, with good results.  (Of course, I\'m better, right Kevin?)

I wonder if the two of us might not be able to merge our styles/ideas/etc., and
produce one very intense campaign.  There would be very little idle time for
the remaining three players, non-player characterizations would probably
improve (less distractions for the ref), and NPC\'s would certainly become more
unpredictable from the players standpoint.

I think it might add a real kick, and allow us (as referees) to have a lot of
fun with each others ideas.

Any thoughts, caveats, etc?

After an extended trip to the head(about a week.....), Dr. Morser
returns to the group. He seems quite excited to finally be on the

bumps into various members of the crew. After a few quiet conversations, 
he addresses the group:
	"Well, as to ze quextion of some kind of coordinate system,

Back in the days when I assumed that thrusters meant rockets (not necessarily
chemical), I also assumed that most ships had grav plates, like those on
grav vehicles, as part of their manoeuvre system.  This allowed them to fly
around a planet without frying any towns they came near, and also allowed
non-aerodynamically designed ships to operate in atmospheres (e.g. the
Type S scout/courier, the Type A, A1 and A2 traders, etc).

    'body' => '    Recently, Bob Mahoney asked if anyone had any experience at co-GMing
Traveller or other games.  I\'ve never coGMed a Traveller game, but I have
coGMed Warhammer FRP, and I expect the basic principles would apply to any
gaming system.
    Basically, it worked very well.  You need to be more prepared for a
co-GMed game than when you\'re doing it alone, because it is very confusing
if one GM starts to "wing it" to any significant extent, as there will not
be time for him to inform the other GM as to what is going on.  So I would
say it\'s only a good idea if the two GMs can get together before the game
and spend at least one evening going over plans.
    The benefits are that some of the work gets split up, and in a number
of situations the role-playing is better.  When the party splits  up, or
even just when different players are doing different things in the same area,
it helps to have two different GMs to deal with them (not so much time spent
waiting on the GM to get done talking to another player, before you can do
something).  This is especially valuable if you have players who like to
each do their own thing, or one player who is enthusiastic (ie loud) enough
to drown out the others when things get heated.
    The biggest advantage, tho\', is that it is easier to role-play several
people at once.  I can remember several instances from my own experience
when I was playing an important NPC who was talking to the party, while the
other GM was playing NPC\'s of less importance who were distracting the party
but added a lot of color to the game.  The halfling shoe salesman who tried
to sell his wares to party members while they were interviewing someone in
a bar, for instance.  (yes, I said halfing shoe salesman)  Even in more 
serious situations (such as when the players are listening in on a situation,
or any other time when more than one NPC is "on-stage" at once), it was very
handy to not have to run everyone in the world.
    For Traveller, where there is probably more background for the GM to
fill in than in any other RP game in existence, the advantage of dividing
up work seems like it would be especially useful.  Hope some of this helped;
I say go ahead, it\'s a good idea.

No I have never done that but...

I have something that is similar, at least I think that it is :-) ...
I have for some years directed plays at a local amateur theater group, this
is similar to running a game, except the game is much more wide open. Anyway
when I direct musicals, I have my wife Music Direct, that can be a problem,
because... 1. I am as qualified as my wife to music direct, being a music 
major in College, my wife was also a music major. And 2. I am married to 
her so that I have to "live" with my suggestions for how the music should 
be done. 

What we have found is that the best way to handle this situation is this:

1. We define our roles. If we are co-music directing, which we have done. 
then I handle the chorus numbers and she handles the solos. If there are 
numbers that one does not feel comfortable directing then we decide before
we begin how the duties will be split. 

2. We never argue in front of the cast. In your case the players. If we 
have differences we discuss them on the way home in the car, that way we can 
yell all we want, and this does not make the other folks uncomfortable.

3. Never change what the other person did, without discussing the change with 
the person, and better let them change it. This way the people that you
are leading are not confused as to who they should listen to. 

4. Be open to suggestions. If you both have the same goal, in my case a
good show then you have to be willing to listen to suggestions.

I have had 6 very successful shows because of the help of my wife, and 
we have never had a major fight in the last 6 years about the plays. 

Also, something that I think some of lose sight of from time to time. 
remember that this is a game, and it should be fun.

It is possible, but remember understand your goals and each of your
responsibilities and it should be just fine.

	Well, not exactly, but I\'ll tell you anyway.
	I play RuneQuest every couple of weeks in a group whose GM pays
	just as much attention to the details of the published RQ as all
	you guys pay to Traveller et. al. - which means that if you want
	a second opinion, just go the rule book, and if it\'s reasonable
	(ie not a blatant excuse) everythings AOK.
	*However* we have one player who knows the rules backwards, sideways,
	upside down and on his head ... (you get the drift)
	This might not be too bad - it\'s great outside the actual game,
	when it comes to generating characters, checking on details, etc,
	especially if the GM is doing something else (like helping someone
	else generate characters etc) but it can get a little bad in play.
	Example :-
	The said playing rule-book had an elf character who acted a little
	too sassy with a group of trolls. Splat. End of elf. Oh, says he,
	according to your calender, it\'s my god\'s holy week at the moment,
	can I roll for a Divine Intervention (A handy device used by fantasy
	role-players to make up for suicidal mistakes!) ... unfortunately
	for all concerned, he made the roll (witnessed!) ... so back pops
	the elf, with the POW attribute (luck, etc) dropped from 16 to 2.
	In between sessions he scrapes through the rules, and comes back
	next time, and *by the rule book* manages to raise POW from 2 to
	10. This makes all the other players (understandably) a little
	p*ssed off ...
	Now I can already hear a lot of you saying that that\'s the GM\'s
	fault for not interpreting the rules his own way and making sure
	that players can\'t take advantage like that ... fair enough, but
	it\'s really just him being consistent to his stated manner of play.
	Not to worry, plans are afoot by the rest of the party to make sure
	the elf meets a bitter doom (in the *nicest* possible way, of course!)

	And what\'s the moral of all this ?
	(aside)		(Not co-GMing, that\'s for sure!)
	If you\'ve got two or more people capable of making rulings on the
	course of the game for *whatever reason* (both GMing, or some as
	players) someone, somewhere, has got to be very careful to keep
	it all under control ... and that is *not easy* at all.

	So, watch it ! Let\'s be careful out there !

people\'s concerns about the EPBM and the GEnie postings being bothersome
with the new all-digest format (must notably, it\'s hard to delete a

the best solution there seems to be, to let those entities exist as
seperate mailing lists.  This is mostly what\'s going on now, and it
seems to be working out well, at least from my perspective.

I apologize for the new digest-only format.  Those of you with MH seem
very grateful for the burst command, but the rest of you are making do.
I appreciate your patience, and your unabated contributions.

Forwarded Message Begins (my commentary is in [square brackets] --
James):

[Metlay\'s introduction to his anatomical treatise was quoted here]

Okay, here goes with some comments.  First, this is a very good and
perfectly reasonable question, which could be important for any number
of non-prurient reasons.  For example, how well would a (human, Vargr,
Aslan) spacesuit fit a (member of a different race)?

Also, DGP avoids "any but the most basic discussions of sexuality" not
for reasons of public good taste, but rather because we don\'t want some
13-year-old kid to get in trouble from his [sic] mom for buying our
stuff.  Our staff is all grown-ups, not counting freelancers, and our
own campaigns are a little racier than what gets published.  For
example, if you remember the murder mystery in TD#4, you may recall that
the victim had a mistress on board.  Well, the mistress was pretty
active, etc., etc.  Also, the original manuscript of TD#2 had a rather
involved mating ritual between the natives of Wal-Ta-Ka, and part of the
adventure involved Aybee\'s obvious difficulties at being chosen by one
of the young maidens.  [Note for people not reading their TD...  Aybee
is an android].

[Metlay comments on TD article on children, and "marital patterns in
older books"]

This is all further detailed in MegaTraveller Alien Volume 1: Vilani and
Vargr, which has been promised back from the printers this very week,
and should appear in stores some time later this month, but Metlay\'s
certainly on the right track.

[Metlay discusses Aslan females, and notes a particular illustrator\'s
discrepencies in artwork].

Very perceptive, Metlay!  The only trouble is that Bill Keith (along
with brother Andy) pretty much "invented" the Aslan, so you\'d think he
knew what he was doing.  In fact, Aslan females do have four breasts,
but the lower two are vestigial.  In their pre-sentient times, Aslan
typically had a greater number of offspring, but infant mortality goes
down as intelligence goes up, etc., etc., so now they have "two"
breasts.

[Metlay discusses Vargr drawings, and bemoans the unclear representation
of the creature\'s torso].

Another line drive down the middle for Metlay.  MTA1 will have published
pictures of female Vargr, and in fact, they have six teats in two rows
of three.  Along these same lines [...], one of the long-standing jokes
around the DGP offices is our threat to put out an "aliens at the beach"
issue, which would feature a "Vargr in a bikini".  The joke, of course,
is that the poor female is wearing three bras, one above the other.  Out
of a concern for modesty, I won\'t tell you who came up with this gem
[...].

[Metlay apologizes for the length of the article, and chides DGP for the
inaccuracies]

Nobody\'s perfect :-)

[Metlay sadly predicts that further contradictions are "likely" in the MT
Alien books]

I daresay that Metlay is likely to be pleased by our presentation.  We
are, of course, fans of the game (we\'d have to be to keep doing this
:-), and definitely share Metlay\'s desire to believe in these alien
races.  We have spent countless hours of discussion in trying to
reconcile "everything ever written" about these first two alien races,
as well as fleshing out detail in a way that rings true.

    'body' => 'One of the things that has bugged me about Traveller is the vehicle
design rules.  With MT now being out, one can design any kind of wheeled
or grav vehicle from a moped to a Death Star-Type dreadnaught capable of
wiping out planets with one shot.  COACC added design rules for
aircraft.  What about water vessels?  I think Trav could benefit from
some organized system of designing water-borne ships and boats.  (For
the duration of this post, any reference to ships, boats, vessels, or
naval craft is to be construed as referring to water-borne, and not
space-borne vehicles.)

Think of the possibilities:

* Mobile starports.
* Putting fuel refining capability on the ships so they could "skim" from
  the very water they floated in.
* Superultramega mobile energy weapon platforms.  With a ship power
  plant, one could power some LARGE energy weps, or mount some very mean
  mass drivers.
* Submarines - they could "skim," too, and use an MHD drive (like the
  Red October).  Communications wouldn\'t be a problem once meson
  technology became available.  ICBM\'s would also be obsolete once meson
  weps could be mounted on subs- this would also enable them to be used
  for orbital defense, too.  Unless one could (somehow) find out where a
  sub with a meson gun was firing from, the sub would be invulnerable.
* Needless to say, you could still do all the fun things with watercraft
  that are possible with today\'s technology (off-shore fire support,
  piracy, and so on).

I think it would be pretty easy for someone who knew Trav vehicle design
rules at least reasonably well to come up with a ship design system that
was at least semi-workable, except for a few very technical questions:

1) How does one calculate the amount and cost of armor for a ship, given
such stats as length, beam, and depth of the keel?  (I hope I make myself
clear- I am not too familiar with naval architecture or terminology.)

2) Given the same stats as above, how is the displacement (and the
draft) calculated?

3) I think that the outputs of extremely large power plants should be
scaled again, since gigawatt powerplants might appear regularly on
ships.

4) How does one calculate the cruising and maximum speed of a craft
given the physical dimensions, and the power output of its drives?  I
anticipate a formula for this using the power output, length-to-beam
ratio, and the displacement of the vessel.

5) Anybody got any ideas about the volume, weight, and cost for aircraft
catapults used on carriers?

6) How is weather handled?

7) What about the maneuverability of vessels?  How is that calculated?

8) How do the ballast tanks for a sub figure into the design?
Fortunately, the only variables here are the volume needed for the
tanks, and the pumps needed to clear/fill them.

9) How is anti-submarine warfare handled?

10) What about MHD drives for subs?  What kind of weight, volume, and
cost requirements are needed?

Volume, weight and displacement for subs should be easy- just modify the
starship hull tables slightly.

Any suggestions, comments, or input is appreciated.

into my trav campaigns...

For subs; use a rule of thumb that the operating depth [rated] equals ten m
meters per armour rating of the vehicle hull.  This corresponds nicely with real
life if anyone works out the numbers for real-life subs.  All subs have to be
streamlined; if someoen were to make one an Airframe i\'d give it some boost
to speed [ x1.25 maybe? ].  Design the hull like a starship.  The max depth
[where ref gets to implode his players :-) ] should be about 1.5 times the
safe depth.

For MHD drives; i would have the following design strategy:  Since the MHD is 
a bunch of magnets and wiring, it somewhat resembles a Fusion plant of equal
tech level.  Thus, a MHD drive would be some factor times the weight of a 
equivalent output fusion drive...maybe 0.5 the mass and volume and cost.  Or
perhaps equal to, it depends; im not a MHD expert.  

Speed is a toughie.  try the following:
Velocity in knots [*1.6=km/h] equals sqrt{ [Pwr(mw)*190]/[sqrt(kl)] }

[if i erred in that let me know.  it\'s a really rough approxomation of real
sub velocity vs. power.]

All subs should be cylinders. One thats a sphere is OK but ought to have 1/3
the rated speed.

...just some more miscelaneous ramblings from

I am very pleased with the calibre and detail of the answers to my
commentary, and won\'t argue too loudly with the quibbles in terms
of number and function, ahem. (Six, eight, what the heck.) But on
the offchance that the DDGP people could be prodded into another
answer (I know, I know, dream on. "Why don\'t you just go to  WORK
for them, Metlay?" The letter\'s in the mail, dudes.), I\'d like to 
pick up on one or two points that weren\'t well clarified:

1. How does my explanation of Vargr female weight fluctuation tie
in with what\'s been written on the subject? I based this assumption
on my knowldege of raising pups, so I assume it\'s not far off....

2. You guys still haven\'t committed to a torso shape, damn it! Do
they have a dog\'s ribcage or a human\'s and if the latter, why?

Harrumph. |->

However, the opening statement did raise an interesting problem:
changes in spacesuit design for aliens! What do you do with the 
tail? How do you keep visors from fogging, given that Vargr and
Aslan pant to cool themselves because they don\'t sweat? Interesting
stuff; think I\'ll do some writing tonight....

(Side comment for those of you building up a trivia library: the
most common Julian/Antarean Vargr term for a human is "Pinkstink,"
with "Shavetail" a close second. Harf! |-> )

Does there exist somewhere out there a program or spreadsheet
already to automate this process somewhat?   If so, where can I get
it from?   I\'d prefer something that runs on either MSDOS or UNIX.
If I\'ve got source I\'ll port it to MSDOS if it is for UNIX or vice

Some PBEM administrivia for the last two weeks.

First, letting people mail openly to each other has added a lot of
life to the game.  It has actually complicated things just a little
for me, but it has been well worth it in terms of added richness of
the game.  If anyone out there wants the player/character aliases
(even non-players) let me know.  So far no one has complained about
giving out addresses, so, since we are sort of a mailing-list
fraternity, I will make it available as a partial list of TML\'ers.
If you are going to ask, pleas remember that some folks *pay* for
their own access and cannot afford a lot of connect time (just a
gentle reminder).

Second, Co-GM\'ing (well, sub-GMing) is working well for the PBEM.
We have about 40 characters and a variable number of NPC\'s.  Far
various reasons, the amount of traffic to/from each character varies
widely from week-to-week.  Because of the heirarchic nature of the
crew, some characters/players are able to field a lot of the direct
character interaction for me.  It works *really* well (now that it\'s
starting to settle out some), and I would like to publicly thank
those who are on teh command team.  You know who you are, and I know
how much work it must be for you.  Thanks again.

In a nutshell, there are eight (8) command team reps.  Of these, one
is the misssion CO.  The CO basically co-ordinates between me and
the other seven, and busts his buns working out other internicene
struggles.  The other seven handle most of the day-to-day goings on
of their particular team.  Right now it\'s going well, but we\'re
still adjusting to the scheme.  
We will probably re-organize so that players who are more
interested and or more able to do this become away team leaders and
handle a different kind of load distribution.

This layout is now (finally) beginning to leave me free to work on
making the adventure truly fun for all.

I apologize to everyone for taking two weeks to get out this turn.
I plead temporary insanity bred by trying to put away my second
(also full-time) job while this was going on.  Also, in mitigation I
would offer that it is spring break for about half the college types
playing (the other half is this week) so some players have put in a
lot of energy and others none -- a little hard to co-ordinate.

I am breaking up this week\'s turn into several parts.  The first
part is the actual turn and overview, the other parts are run-downs
of what has been happening.  There is a lot of material, and I plan
to post it all because so much of it is of general interest.

Thanks to everyone for supporting us, even if you can\'t play.  It is
really a lot of fun jsut to be part of.  I am considering making
this an open campaign -- allowing people to sign up and leave as
their schedules allow.  Right now it\'s just a thought, but it would
be good to discuss and consider as we all get more practice at doing
this.  If  you want to talk to me about opeing the game, write to
the oresoft address.  This will help me keep this discussion
separate from the game.

A lot has happened in the last (almost) 2 weeks:
Sorry it took so long, but it was worth it, I assure you.

You are a remarkably self-motivated crew.  Most of you are waiting
anxiously to get out of here (I don\'t blame you.)  Already you are
making important discoveries about R-alpha, just by developing answers
to your needs once you get there.

After your initial training and orientation you are flown out to the
Alcyon.  The Alcyon is a large tetrahedron, now with two scouts and
a free trader attached.  A large column runs down the center of the
tetrahedron, with what is obviously an engine exhaust at one end,
and a bridge at the fourth apex.  Three smaller columns connect the
central spine to the three attached ships.

As you approach you notice that she is generally bronze colored,
with highly reflective "baloons" of fuel, now about 2/3 full and
beocming rigid, filling the remaining volume of the tetrahedron.

Over all the "flat" non-surfaces, there is a fine mesh --  the
lanthanum grid.  Two vacc-suit clad figures, and a safety shuttle
closely crawl accross the surface of the grid, inspecting it, as you
approach.

You board the Alcyon and family.  A few people from your crew are
already here.  Some engineers are going over the entire grid, piece 
by piece.  Captain Ger is getting a sore ear from talking on the 
radio so much.  

Generalists are dispatched to oversee installation of cargo, the medical 
team sets to examining everyone and verifying condition of medical 
stores and equipment, the security team checks in weapons, and the scientists
are scambling to answer questions from the other groups.

Tursnkaad brings out three shuttlecraft and a defense fighter and
installs them, one each, in each of the cargo bays.  {ref note:
some of you might still be worrirng about what\'s aboard -- I haven\'t
(quite) dissaproved anything yet, so don\'t worry about it.}

As you stow your gear your mind recalls the sights of smells of so
many previous launchings: the crates filling the passageways as well
as the cargo holds, the fresh antiseptic smell, the near-smell of
the new and unkown, the rumblings of the power plant coming on line,
the annoyng, incessant, chirp of communicators being tested, and the
hushed awe of watching ground slip away.

- ----

When everyone and everything is aboard, tugs hook on to the Alcyon 
and slowly pull you away from the ecliptic plane and out of the 
asteroids.  As your view clears you notice three more tugs, each 
bringing a strap-on booster rocket.

The tugs depart, the rockets are attached and wired, and the
remaining tugs arc gracefully away.  Those in position notice that
at the Turnskaad base, all lights go out, then on, three times.
Communications receives the message: "Good luck intrepid
adventurers.  Come back with your shield."

You feel the shudders and hear the groans of the structure only
microseconds before the automatic polarizers dim your viewports from
the glare of the rockets.  Even with assistance, your initial
progress is agonizingly slow (about 1.5 G).  The sky jet black
forward, fiery red behind, you depart for your rendezvous with jump
space now only hours away.

- ----
{ref note:  I\'m not discussing what you do at your posts - you know
that better than I do :-)}

Have a good trip.

More conversations - these specifically about transport:


    Also, according to my preliminary calculations (based mostly on
guesses) we are only going to be able to get at most 3/4G acceleration
out of the Alcyon/3ship lashup.  That is three quarters of a
standard gravity of acceleration.  Not very much for maneuvering around
something that could be spinning at over 1100m/s!  I suggest we leave
the Alcyon in some easily reachable orbit and transfer everyone to the
ringworld by Scout/Free Trader.   This is assuming Dr. Abuko\'s calculations
about the spin are correct.
    It certainly looks like life is going to be interesting, to say the
least, once we hit system!
    A bientot.

Commander Ger,
   I would like permission to run some simulations and drills for all
pilots, navigators, and sensor/comm operators.  Including people from
all of the teams, not just Transport.  I would prefer to do this before
we jump, but if there is no time now it can wait until we have entered
jump-space.  I will try to determine who is most suited to fill the
various positions on-board as well as in the Away-Teams.
   Beaux cieux a vouz.

  "Any of you given any thought about how we\'re going to land on the
ringworld?   There\'s got to be walls on the side, so maybe we can 
match velocities and dock.  If there\'s an intact transport system on
the ring, maybe we can use it to move our equipment and personnel.
There might even be airlocks on the \'floor\'.  Either would be
preferable to landing in a pseudo gravity well.   If we had to leave
in a hurry, I\'d rather be able to just \'cut loose\' than have to take 
off."

Greetings Team,

   We are getting closer to launch time and I\'m still not sure who will be 
filling what positions!
   Nishu I believe has stated he would like to be Navigator, and Jaron
mentioned Sens/commo.  What about the rest of you?  We will be going
through a full series of tests and drills as soon as we hit jump-space
but I need some idea now.
   Let me know ASAP.
   Plus, en retard.

Subject: Gravitics vs R-alpha


Johann barges in on the grav vs. ringworld discussion: "I do have a basic 
	training in gravitics if you\'d like me to make some simulations. If 
	grav devices won\'t work on r-alpha it will be a big obstacle to 
	overcome. I assume that reactioneless thrusters will work in either 
	case, though.
	What I\'d like to point out is that it will be difficult for the ships 
	to match speeds with the rotating ringworld. If it\'s diameter is like 
	terras orbit and it is designed to give an impression of one gee then 
	it\'s rotational speed will be," he begin to fiddle with his pocket 
	computer, "approximately..." no this must be wrong!" he checks his 
	figures to make sure that they are correct, "1211 kilometers per 
	second, but I hope that I am wrong! If I am right it will take more 
	than 17 hours at two gee to match speeds with the ringworld and the 
	acceleration vector on the surface of the ringworld will change by 
	3.34 degrees per hour. I think that it sounds like we\'ll have to make 
	major changes in the manuever-control programs to enable them to 
	function properly on and around the ringworld!
	Hmm, I wonder how the builders of r-alpha, shall we call them 
	\'Ralphs\'?" Johann added with a slight smile "do when they land? And 
	how they travel around on the ringworld? Normal, non-grav, means is 
	generally to slow and can\'t take that much cargo. Is it possible that 
	they installed artificial grav-modules in \'paths\' as \'highways\' for 
	grav-vehicles? Since there were no neutrinos, I guess that if such 
	grav-paths even existed they won\'t be in operation now, since they 
	would need enormous amounts of energy. Of course, if they rely on 
	solar energy, that might do the trick.
	I hope that we\'ll bring a few small-crafts with reactionless thrusters 
	in case grav-modules really don\'t work on r-alpha!"

Subject: Dr. Limner finally wakes up
Cc: limner ref

Dr. Limner, a thin man of just about 185 cm height, wearing a nice but
slightly outmoded suit, has been sitting very quietly throughout most of the
discussions.  He stands up.  For some reason, he seems to remind everyone of a
typical college professor.  He finally speaks:

    "Hmmm.  Mr. Schmud, your point about the artificial gravity is well
    taken, but it appears to me that the ring will still have a mass, and
    thus gravity-  powered vehicles should still function, although they
    might need some tuning. Admittedly, that is not my specialty, but I
    believe that I could be of some assistance in that task.  Lets
    see...  You\'d need to compensate for the extra coriolis force while
    compensating for the odd distribution of mass...  Yes, that could be
    done by simply tuning the primary navigational field\'s epsilon
    parameter then applying a few turns to the...

    Sorry, I tend to go on a bit sometimes.  Please feel free to stop me
    if I am talking too much.  I know that I sometimes tend to ramble on
    but this is all so interesting.  I wouldn\'t want to get on anybody\'s
    nerves, though.  Just stop me if I..."

Dr. Limner seems to notice a few rolled-back eyes and stops speaking, then
fumbles with the equipment he has been given.  He seems especially clumsy with
the stun pistol he was issued, which he almost drops, but catches before it
hits the ground.

    "Oops, I should be more careful with these things.  Wouldn\'t want to
    have to give first aid to anyone before we even got there, now would
    we?
    
    Now, where were we?  That\'s right, gravitics.  I had a similar
    problem once where a planet\'s moon was so large...  But I\'ll save
    that story for some other time."

Dr. Limner stops, seems to hesitate, then walks over to the physical sciences
team.



Dr. Limner speaks up:

    "Ah, Mr. Abuko. I was just discussing this matter with Dr. Werner.  I
    believe that gravitic propulsion systems should work on the
    ringworld, since the ring must have a mass, even though it probably
    relies on centripetal acceleration to produce its simulated gravity.
    The fact that there is a lower concentration of mass may cause some
    problems, but we should be able to adjust any gravitic drives to
    compensate for it.  Once we get close to the ring, however, the
    ring\'s mass should dwarf any gravitic vehicles we are using, and we
    should get the lift we need."

Dr. Limner begins to sit down, then pauses:

    "Of course, getting close to the ring might be a problem."

Dr. Limner sits down then and seems to be looking over the equipment he was
issued.  He pulls out a high-tech set of binoculars and looks into the
eyepiece, withdraws an old-style spyglass and looks through it, then smiles
contentedly.  He then notices that people are looking at him, and speaks out:

    "If you\'re interested, I have done this sort of thing before, it
    involves focusing the gravitational drives in the direction of the
    star and rather than lessening the gravitational effects, instead
    increasing them.  This would allow you to orbit at the higher orbital
    velocity necessary to match that of the ring.  As all of you probably
    realize already, this is not the way that most gravitational drives
    were designed to operate.  As such, it is a bit less precise.  It
    will let you get close enough to the ring, however.  Of course, I\'ve
    never actually tried it with a RINGWORLD before, only with a rosette
    formation of... but I\'m sure nobody is interested in that right now."

Dr. Limner seems to have stopped speaking, but after a while adds one more
thing:

    "Oh, by the way, we don\'t know what sort of gravitational devices
    were used on the ringworld.  It is quite conceivable that there could
    be devices which would have an adverse effect on gravitic drives.
    They probably wouldn\'t be running, though."

Another pause:

    "This is all theoretical, though.  Practically, the easiest thing to
    do would be to simply bring the spacecraft close enough to the ring
    for gravitic drives to work, then release the gravitic vehicles.
    This would also be the fastest.  Unless you have some reason for not
    wanting to bring large spacecraft near to the ring.  In case you have
    any fears, we will be able to use gravitic vehicles long before the
    spacecraft get too close to the ringworld."

    "Oh yes, and there was one more thing...  It was something Dr. Werner
    said.  Now what was it?  Oh, that\'s right.  Even though the
    gravitational drives will operate near the ring, they will need to be
    adjusted signifigantly to compensate for the tremendous rotational
    velocity.  Otherwise they would be almost impossible to control and
    would no doubt either crash or go spinning off into space.  I almost
    forgot about that detail.  I never was good with details."





	
	From Ralf:
	
	Well, mine is a "midget" Grav APC, 4 tons.  It\'s stocked with a
minilab for all my gear and some of my supplies.  Questions:  Can I use
my high electronics to build some sort of "stealth" field for the APC?
I know that there is holography in the Imperium, could I also adapt a
holographic rig to provide holograhic camoflage or invisibility over the
APC?  How about using my Gravitics skill to pump up the speed (right now
it\'s pretty much a "stock" model)?




Hey Lazer,

I\'ve got for sure 5 empty staterooms on the Korondor Talisman... is 
somebody going to assign people to them?  We can go single or double
on the occupancy, and I\'ve got enough decent grub to feed us all for
a while provided somebody is on board that can cook the stuff
without burning it....

Thul



[Well, with a lot of number crunching and slipstick time you guys
have found out quite a bit about transport problems you might have.
Here\'s a summary of your conclusions and solutions:]

The Alcyon will almost certainly stand off from the ring, and actual
contact will be made with scouts or shuttles.

The ring\'s linear velocity is probably betwen 1100 and 1300 m/s.

The ring probably has a noticable mass of it\'s own; no one is quite
sure what this means yet, though.

Initial landing will probably be on the spill wall (thanks to whoever
came up with that term -it\'s great).  That way, accidents might hurt
but probably will be recoverable.

Approach for initial landing will either be tangential to the ring,
or from above.  Still undecided.

The Alcyon will probably park between the ring and the sun.

A command shuttle will be used.

No decision yet on how far apart you are willing to separate teams.
Right now the discussion centers on communication time and response
time.

One of the scouts will probably make an initial pass over areas to
be explored, for preliminary mapping.

[Referee\'s quiz for everyone:  Why did Turnskaad use *chemical*
rockets to boost the Alcyon, when fusion would have been cheaper?]

Here\'s some exerpts from last week:


        When he gets a look at the Alcyon, Dr. Sir Van Der Merwe breaks
out in gales of laughter. "A jump tender! Oh, what a piece of work! I
bet that just gave those impatient engineers a shock. Such high hopes of
working on a big ship..."


...[Bhyarrvouf] carries a heavy tool belt that\'s weighed down
by a massive Gauss pistol at each hip, and a data/display headset
covers one eye and connects to one ear, giving him a piratical look
that\'s either menacing or silly, depending on your mood.
	He\'s relatively quiet until the Alcyon drifts into view; then
he\'s glued to the viewport, his tail wagging furiously (in Abuko\'s
face, unfortunately |-> ). He jabbers something excitedly in a Vargr
tongue, then forcibly reverts to his his heavily-accented Galanglic.
	"A jump tender! Kae, kakh TSAKHA, a JUMP TENDER! HEEYARF!"
He licks his chops, practically drooling. "No wonder they kept it
quiet. Oh, I can\'t wait to get my hands on those drives! And she\'s
MINE! Mine mine mine mine mine all MINE!" He checks himself 
sheepishly. "Subject to Fearless Leader\'s orders, of course. And the
Helmsman. And the NAvigator...." He slumps into his couch, dejected.
"Okay, so it\'s NOT mine." He sighs heavily, then brightens a bit.
"But the JUMP DRIVES are!" he sits up and watches the approach, then
and notes Karl Morser out of the corner of his eye. He grins toothily.
	"Yo! Mr. Science! What do you think of ZAT, huh?" 







	
	Bhyarrvouf talking to Abuko:
	
	He scratches an ear thoughtfully. "As for the hastiness of the
mission, well, I won\'t lie, it has me worried too. They\'re slinging us
into the unknown and wishing us well; it\'s possible that they have a
REAL mission with loyal Turnskaad people being set up right now, with us
to go on ahead and take the brunt of any nasty surprises R-alpha has in
store." He shrugs. "But that\'s a risk we all seem to be prepared to take."
	"Hey, I\'ve been meaning to ask, A.P.: You\'ve got the look of a 
long-haul trooper on you. Where\'d you work before this little jaunt?"



and:
"Bizarre. I gave it all up to be a Second Engineer on a starship I\'ve
never seen, working for a human I don\'t know, going somewhere I know 
nothing about with more humans I don\'t know guiding my path and guarding 
my life for reasons I don\'t trust...."
	He grins wolfishly. "Kakh tsakha, I love this life!"




Christian van der Merwe:

        "I\'m arranging with Count Ger to give all of you a full medical
check-up and range of inoculations. I want to make sure I have good
base records on all of you, in case I need it in the future... Further,
I want to make sure that you are all in tip-top shape. The inoculations
are to make sure that no common bug gives us any trouble.



Eneri DeAith:

  "Any of you given any thought about how we\'re going to land on the

Count Ger:

I wish to put a request in for one of
the following (depending on availability) (perhaps both a shuttle and
fighter, depending on size).

	1) A system defense boat. ("standard" designs are 400T and are
	thus probably too big to fit in our space). At least one missile
	turret.
	
	2) Heavy Fighter. (6G, Agility-6, missile turret, armoured) This may 
	not be available. Nuclear weapons (combat grade - not dirty), would 
	be the preferred load. Two man ship (pilot+gunner) preferred. 
	Extended duty ship also preferred. (increased crew area, and supplies)
	
	3) Extra "command" shuttle. (6G, agil 3+, armed, missiles again),
	definitely with small cabins. Extended electonics - communications
	and military-grade sensors. Perhaps this could also double as a 
	fuel shuttle for the ship.
	
	4) Fast shuttle (6G).


[These were all approved and brought on board]





Count Ger:

It has recently been drawn to my attention, the possible difficulties in
communications on R-alpha (time lag, and extensive atmosphere).

The actual deployment of our teams will be highly dependant on the conditions
that we observe when we reach R-alpha. It is quite possible that a ship could
be placed in a orbit closer to the sun to act as a relay point, or that the
ringworld may already have some form of relay stations. The point is don\'t
expect any hard answers until we see the actual conditions.

Has anyone come up with a possible reference system for R-alpha. (We won\'t
have compass directions - just spinward, and anti-spinward). If we want to
specify a location on the surface, and there isn\'t any ready landmarks, we
may have to provide a coordinate system origin.

However, until we arrive, and especially before we leave, keep thinking of
any special problems so we can have contingincy plans, and get any needed
special equipment.



Abdul:

How is this for a reference system,  we can have spinward and anti-spinward
for the long dimension of the ring and use port and starboard for left/right
when the viewer is facing spinward.  Use the initial landing site as the
origin of the coordinate system (unless some other significant landmark
presents itself.

As for communications relay,  a ship located close to the sun would cover
most of R-alpha, a second ship located on the oposite side to the first should
be able to cover the rest.

                                   .
     ----*----
                                   .

Where the -\'s are the ring and the * is the central sun.  the .\'s are the
posible locations of ships (stationary positions would be nice but orbiting
should be ok.  So long as the two ships can communicate to each other, the
whole of R-alpha should be visible to radio.  This will make for interesting
time delays of several minutes.  Assuming we do not disperse over the entire
surface of R-alpha, we may not need any kind relay for messages.  This is a
good reason for not dispersing too widely, at least initially.


from Thule
Maybe we can talk our employers into supplying us with some phase/time
locked transponders?  

{Player mode on:  Such a thing exists in 20th century earth}

Idea being if you have two accurate time pieces you can figure out where
you are distance wise from the transponder.  With two or more you
can nail down an fix.     Range depends on how cheap or expensive
you go with it....

[ref:  These are exactly the kind of transponder repeaters sewed
into your uniforms - the ones everyone hastily removed because they
didn\'t like the idea of being "watched"...]



[character mode on. The conference, an informal gathering. Zben Blaine,
Bhyarrvouf, Dr. Abuko, and Count Ger are there; probably just standing
in a hallway.....]

"Here\'s the problems as Zben and I see them," Bhyarrvouf says. "We have to
stay in communication with our people in space and our base camp at all 
times, but the structure of R-alpha makes that tough. Sure, there\'s no
horizon, but there\'s also much longer air paths for the lasers and a nasty
little wrinkle I have Dr. Morser working on-- the warping of spacetime
by the Sun, which sits right in the middle of our view of the oposite
side of the Ring and distorts the gravitic lines near it, hence bending
our laser beams all over the place!"
	"Now, I had an idea for a cheap and easy way to solve some of these
problems, but I want to bounce it off of you folks first. We need a relay
comsat network, in orbit inside the Ring but away from the Sun a ways, that
can bounce signals around and avoid long atmosphere paths and solar gravity
distortion. I figure six of them should be enough; fewer if we stick to a
small section of the Ring at any one time, maybe as few as one."
	"But here\'s the neat trick-- they don\'t have to be expensive relays!
All we need are mirrored balloons, to bounce the laser beams where we want
them to go! A little transponder on each one to help locate them precisely
in space and help the computer do the aiming, and we\'re in business!"
	"I know it sounds crazy, but think it over first. I\'ve seen this
trick used to boadcast pirate video on worlds where the government was
supposedly in control of all communication. The principles are simple!"
	He grins. "Of course, an orbiting laser relay satellite WOULD be
preferable, but does Turnskaad have one they could spare? Or six?"


>From Zben:
First: I checked the equipment list given and found each
individual had at least a hand communicator, and there are enough Comm
Dots or Remote earpices in stock to supply everybody.
        Second: These units are what we call "frequency agile", with
digital muliplexing available. They\'ll support a set of five
frequencies, which will be adequate, given the set up I purpose below.
What this means is, that even though a unit may only have a preset for
five channels, they don\'t all have to be the SAME five channels!
        Third: We really need two different configurations, one for
onboard ship while in transit, and a second set for when we break up
into Away Teams.
        Fourth: There are different needs for voice, video, and data,
at different priority levels.

        Given all that I\'ve come up with these Communication Channel
Assignments. I\'m sure you don\'t want me to go into detail on
frequencies, etc. [8-)] but I can tune the units to comply with this
list, If I\'m given the go ahead. Everybody gets 4 channels. Here goes:

        the (x__) refers to the number of multiplexed channels
available for that channel. More can be added later, if absolutely
needed and useable.

        "Now that that\'s set up, I have a few questions that I\'d like to
know if anybody thought of....." He pulls out a pocket computer and
starts to punch in numbers. "In doing all this I had to ask about
things like Laser and Maser relays, line of sight, and total distance
the signal will travel, etc. I was at the briefing with the rest of
you, but only now did the scale of this place start to hit me! For one
example, if we put teams on opposite sides of the Ring, do you have
any idea how long communications would take??"( Zben starts pacing,
obviously excited and warming to the task.) "To send any kind of
signal that we can generate from one side of the "world" to another
would take Over 16 Minutes! ONE WAY! (do the math...) I think we need
to think long and hard about how far afield we can send teams!" (He
stops, and smiles) "One good thing though...we won\'t have to worry
about sending signals "over the horizon"....There isn\'t any!"



Blaine, Bhyarrvouf,
	I need a couple of examples to help me understand the communications
protocols. Why only 4 channels when 5 are available? What channels would
I get?, a team commander?, a team member? I would also like to see the
team channels carried over to the exploration groups in order for my command
structure to work efficiently.
	As I see it a #3 team member would have the following channels:
		AEH (the other channels could be the team channel, and
		perhaps a public relay channel ie. sent to the ship, etc. 
		eg. "Please connect me with person x" which could then beep
		that person\'s communicator, and they could talk regardless of
		team assignments (like the party line channel))
	A team leader (same team) could have:
		ABEH (plus his team channel, public relay?)

        Zben mutters over the comp for a few minutes more, with
comments like "...angle of incidence equals angle of reflection..", and
"...orbital velocity doppler shift..", and finally picks his head up.
"Good idea with the relay sats, but I don\'t think we can use passive
reflectors. One, they couldn\'t be in "geosync" `cause they\'d
litterally be in a differnt orbit. Two, coherent light bounced
off a curved surface would tend to scatter. There are some other
reasons, but those should suffice. Unfortunately, relay sats have
some problems too." He goes back to the comp and calls up more
figures. "However, I could make two other recommendations that might
be marginally better. First, we could "daisy-chain" the team vehicles
together so relay is done by the shortest route available. I would
reccommend this as maybe a back-up plan, as there\'s a lot that can go
wrong with it. My best plan would involve hard landing two relays on the
top of the "spill-wall" [to borrow a term]  at 120 degrees in each
direction from the primary basecamp. These would be out of the
atmosphere, visible to all, and should be able to supply inter-relay
links avoiding most sun effects."
        "`course, we may find conditions when we get there stranger
than we can believe... I suggest keeps all options open `till we get
there!"

        Zben looks up, expectantly.....




Bhyarrvouf grunts disgustedly at Zben\'s speech. "Kakh idiot," he says to
himself. "Why didn\'t I think of that? Must be getting old.... of course
the top of the spillwall is the perfect place for them! Good shot, 
Blaine! And if they were fix mounted, we could actually use modified
ground-relay stations, which are probably cheaper and easier to get than
comsats!" He sniffs. "Still liked the balloon idea, though." Shrug.
"It worked for holovid broadcasts...." Grin.
	"So how\'s about it, Fearless Leader? Can we strain Turnskaad\'s
already-bustin\' bank accounts and get ourselves two or three surface-
to-orbit laser relays?"




Mr Khervatchkov:
	We would like to request 3-6 very long range communications satellites
for use at R-Alpha. With optional static mounts in case we need to attach them
to the top of R-Alpha itself.

"I know this is a stupid idea," Bhyarrvouf says apologetically as he 
carefully checks his tool kit and gauntlets, "But I guess I\'m superstitious.
I learned engineering from an old drive-hand who\'d been cruising the 
Antarean Void and the Julian Worlds for thirty years, and one thing
he used to drum into my head was checking the hull and grids every so often.
\'Bhyarrvouf,\' he\'d say to me, \'The grid *is* the drive; the power plant
and the zuchai crystals are just sauce for the bones. If the grid\'s bad, 
your jumps\'re gonna be bad, an\' don\'t you forget it!\' He checked the grids
of every ship he ever served on, once when he signed on and twice a year
after that, more often if there\'d been battle damage or weathering while
in port." 

He pauses thoughtfully. "The last ship he signed on to was a tramp
freighter, taking him home to die. Her captain treated him as a guest, and
told him he didn\'t have to work the passage, even for fun. So he got aboard
without checking the grids." Another pause, longer this time, and Bhyarrvouf\'s
eyes grow bright. "We were watching them as they went into jump, and I\'ll
never in all my life forget what that ship looked like when she went to
weave-open and there was a dead spot in her grid. Not even any debris to 
recover; one flash and she was pure gamma rays. What a stupid way to die."

He shakes his head and grins. "Stupid old wolf. I talk too much."

Bonjour Lazer,
   Bhyarrvouf and a few others are going EVA and need someone to stand
off in a shuttle in case anything goes wrong.  Do you have time to do
this?  If not let me know and I will fly it.
   I am assuming you don\'t have any experience piloting ships as large
as the Alcyon.  If I am wrong let me know!
   Allons-y.

Right now I\'m about to cover the outside of the ships with vouf, just
waiting to hear about some combat armour, & so what I need right now
is to get hold of a spaceworthy holo-camera that no-ones going to miss
for a few hours, figure out the instructions on it and get to the main
lock with all my kit checked & ready before Bhyarrvouf does !

I have decided to take a wait-and-see attitude on this. We have a probe that we
will send in first to determine if there are any defenses. There is no way to
stop any planetary-class defenses, so if they are present we will have to
approach from the bottom, match speeds, and hopefully the defenses won\'t
be smart enough to identify the craft as foreign. This will be done at first
with a shuttle crewed by volunteers.

    'body' => 'The new format is twice as complicated as the old (high guard) rules, which
were themselves a nightmare. I don\'t have a program to do ship designs,
(Though I have been working on one for a while - We could form A new 
subgroup "Ship Design" :-).

Here are some tips that I use for designing ships:

The old (High guard) rules used to allow you to break things down into
percentage based, and non-percentage. Thus allowing you a quick calculation
for approx. hull size...No more, you have to guess at the hull size. (Not
a good tip I know)

The sensor/communications choices are quite complex, but there are essentially
two types of suites, Military (one of everything please), and Non-Military
(Radio (Laser), and medium range EMS). You should set up sensor pacakges
for your design style for each tech level in the two formats. Thus when
you design a tech 14 military ship, you just read off the line on your chart
which already has the cost, price, weight, and power worked out. You can then
list any modifications to the basic package.

Armour: Armour is only effective (for starships) in increments of three. 
(40,41 and 42, are all the same for starhip combat). Civian ships which want 
agility, (and are price consious) cannot have extra armour.

Design the craft in this order: Hull, armour, locomotion, senors/commo, 
weapons, computer. Calculate the engergy reqiurements for life support on 
the entire ship\'s volume. Gravity/compensators for total volume minus jump 
fuel volume. Compute the non-agility power requirements, and enter the power 
plant info. Estimate the crew size, anc compute the weight required. Using the
following formula:
	(Required agility)*(Ship\'s mass so far)
	----
			5.4
			
Compute the power required to get the agility you want. Then compute the
size of the power plant (round up), and use it\'\'s mass in the above equation 
instead of the ships to get the power required for the extra mass of the power 
plant. Repeat until the power is less than approx. 1% of the total.
Now compute the fuel required for the power plant (30 days is not essential, if
you only have 20 day\'s worth, it may be O.K). Calucate the purification plant
plant weight and power, and the savings on gravity/compensators for not
including the power plant fuel. If the net energy and weight aren\'t close
(using the above formula) either increase the purification time (especially if
the ship is not streamlined), or go back to the power plant calulations
increasing the ship\'s mass accordingly.
Now compute the exact crew requirements, and the control panel for the ship.
(If you wish - recompute your power plant, power fuel, grav/intertial, and 
purifier based on these new totals). Otherwise, add all your totals up, check
that the agility, and volume is still O.K. And you can now write up the
description. (Remember all thoroughout this you should keep an eye on the
volume requirements, so you can see if your hull estimate is off).

	Easy huh? This is the point where you find out that you really can\'t
get a TL15 ship, and it has to be TL14....time to cry.

One last tip. There are points on the charts for energy levels, batteries
bearing, etc. that an extra/fewer couple of units of size, energy, etc. can 
make a big difference. (For example I was deigning a 45T fighter, when I
started to write it up, I discovered that it\'s 1100 Mw power plant, even with
E-M maksking, made it a Moderate energy output on a scan. By redesigning it
to 40T (and a 990 Mw power plant, the energy output dropped two levels to None).

     As a matter of fact, I can handle converting from IFF to GIF format
also.  I have an Amiga, so I *know* I can deal with an IFF file.  I have

This wasn\'t quite what I had in mind.  I was thinking more along the
lines of rotating the plates *slowly*, and probably turning off each
plate while you rotate it.  Since any naval architect worthy of the
name ought to install at least 2 plates on any vessel, you would
always have a minimum of 50% thrust even with one plate turned off.
Larger ships would have a whole series of plates which could be turned
off and rotated one at a time with only a small loss of thrust.
Thus the ship does not become super-agile or anything like that ...
just a little more comfortable to handle.

Why not have *retractable* bracing which could be taken out of the
way while the plate is switched off and rotating, and extended again
when it is in the desired position?  This would probably mean that
the plates could only be used in a few set orientations, as the
bracing allowed (e.g. aft-, belly- or forward-pointing).  Personally,
I feel that TL 14 engineering ought to be able to cope with this.

	OK Dan, Brent, I\'ll also mention that I can convert loadsa graphics
	formats, including colour to grayscale and straight b/w.
	But then again, it sounds like you all have got fbm, pbm, bmx et. al.
	(the conversion libraries)
	
	Only one new point to add - be *damn* careful when transferring
	images to/from each other ... make sure all files are transferred
	as binary images within FTP, or,if you\'re resorting to mailing
	them, find a mutual binary-to-ascii converter ...
	
	There\'s nothing worse than going through all the file transfers
	and conversions, and then finding that the original file was
	junked ...
	
	Rather like delivering an important passenger through thick & thin,
	taking loadsa risks to get them to their destination, and then
	finding that they die from a heart attack just before they pay ...
	and you don\'t have any friends around ...

I have been listening in for a few months now and I have failed to hear
anything about science fiction relevant to Traveller.  Doesn\'t anybody
read fiction?  Of course you do; does anyone have a list of
"recommended readings?"

Well regardless, I\'d like to start with one book of short stories that
seems to me so close to Traveller in "format" that it could have
spawned it:

_Star Swarm_ by Brain Aldiss

I am now looking into his (literally) mountain of stories to see if any
others are as applicable (_Star Swarm_ is a collection of previously
published stories).  Another similar Aldiss collection that seems
germane is _Galaxies Like Grains of Sand_.

Here\'s some addresses to try for those troublesome folks.  I gleaned
this list from some requests for changes and help, and from looking
at folks\' mail headers.  I\'m glad I\'m not the only one with a
recalcitrant keyboard.  :-)


Eneri De Aith  (Bob Moynihan)
	moynihan_r@apollo.hp.com
	moynihan_r@apollo%hp.com


Christian van der Merwe  (Nick Sylvain)
	uunet!dayton.bitnet!sylvain$n
	sylvain@udcps2.cps.udayton.edu
	sylvain$@dayton.bitnet

	The first address is preferred.  It is a strictly bitnet scheme,
	and if you are on internet-only type systems, it will not work.
	The last address sometimes works from uucp systems, not always
	though because it might pass through an internet node.  Use the
	second address as a last resort.  It usually takes one or two
	days longer for mail to get to Nick this way.


Dr. Werner (Ron Abramson)
        rona@hpml92.hp.com
		rona%hpdml92.hp.com@udel.edu

		Make sure your alias uses the letter `l\' not the number `1\'.
		Some of you (and me initially) have a 1 in there.  I have no
		idea where this goes.. sometimes it bounces.


Adrian Bishop (Mark Cook)
        markc@hpcvss.cv.hp.com
		markc%hpcvss.cv.hp.com@udel.edu

		Make sure that you have hpcvss, not hbcbss or some other
		strangeness.  Also make sure you have `markc\' not `mark\' --
		that goes to someone else in the same building who is
		getting weary of reading Mark\'s mail.


Abdul (Paul Dale)
		grue@lance.hss.bu.oz.au
        grue@batserver.cs.uq.oz.au

		I don\'t know which of these he prefers; he answers both
		fairly promptly.  Paul is in Australia, so it *always* takes
		a couple of days to get a response.


Andon Shrike (Brian Gillespe)
		bgillesp@beast.prime.com
        
		We are trying bgillesp@cvbnet.prime.com in case the first
		fails.  DONT USE bgillesp@beast.prime.com%cunyvm.cuny.edu
		because CUNY bounces it.  Also don\'t use bgillesp@beast --
		that will send it to Unix World magazine and they\'ll send me
		more nasty-grams (although they are getting intrigued with
		his mail :-).)


Anton Devious (Rob Miracle)
		uunet!ulkyvx.bitnet!rwmira01
		rwmira01@ulkyvx.bitnet
		uunet!ulkyvx.bitnet!rmwira01@sun.acs.udel.edu

		Make sure you get the end name spelled right.  It\'s `mira\'
		as in Miracle (at least that\'s how I finally remembered it.)


Sergeant Major Hammer (Rory Reynoldson)
		uunet!frith!upba!rory

		We are currently testing rory@upba%frith.uu.net  and I will
		tell those who have asked if it works (if they haven\'t
		already tested it.)


Fritz Severin (Jim Baranski)
        baranski@meredn.enet.dec.com

		The name is `Jim\' not `Ed\'.  My humble apologies.  Be sure
		you don\'t have `meredin\' in the address; there is no i.


 Ralf (Steve Owens)
		jscratch@eklektik.pgh.pa.us
		jscratch@unix.cis.pitt.edu

		Steve prefers the first address.  Use the second if the
		first one fails.

Thanks for your posting, hope everyone feels free to ask questions here
on the list.

Try Poul Anderson, maybe a collection of short stories like "Trader to
the Stars" or "The Long Night", both of which I\'ve read and enjoyed.
Although they are a bit dated compared to today\'s cyberpunk and other
advanced technologies, many of Anderson\'s ideas seemed to be adopted and
appear in one form or another in Traveller.  I especially like how he
brings planetography, starship operation and economics issues to the
stories.

I\'ll take a look at Brian Aldiss; thanks for the reference.  I\'m sure
metlay, Cunningham, Mac et al will have lots of sugggested reading.  I
particularly like merchant stories.

particularly parallel to the Traveller universe, please recognize that
this list welcomes such submissions.

My 2 credits\' worth: (Dang, getting one\'s name mentioned as an "authority"
can loosen one\'s tongue! |-> )

I don\'t read. Seriously, I don\'t. I write and perform my own music, create
my bown gaming adventures and rules, and occasionally write for gaming
magazines, when I\'m not working on my thesis. I stopped reading assiduously
right about the time that Spider Robinson was first published, if that tells
you anything. Among the various people whom y\'all probably worship whose
stuff i\'ve never opened are David Brin, Jack Chalker, William Gibson, and
a young fellow I used to be friends with back in my SF-fan days, who shared
dreams with me but actually DID something about them too, Somtow Sucharitkul.
Such is life; I anticipate even less time for this stuff after I\'m married,
as I expect Suzanne to drive me mercilessly to finish my album and the stuff
I\'ve been preparing for GDW and/or DGP. (Behind every successgful man there
stands a woman with a well-aimed meat fork--sigh....)

As for what I USED to read, well, that\'s straightforward.... try Heinlein
of any vintage. His view of women borders on the psychotic, but the rest
of it is good fodder for space opera. I highly recommend E.E. "Doc" Smith,
as he was the man who CREATED (in the 1920\'s!) all of the space opera 
ideas we now consider cliched. Larry Niven, with or without Pournelle,
bandies about some good ideas, as do Poul Anderson and Fritz Lieber.
For more generalized background, I also recommend books from outside of
SF; Ian Fleming\'s James Bond books are wonderful, at least the first
ten or so. I also recommend, for those of you with strong stomachs and
a sick twist to your psyches, Carlos Castaneda for psionics and Yukio
Mishima for one man\'s view of an aristocracy. If you can read his last
four books (the "Sea of Fertility" tetralogy, comprised of SPRING SNOW,
RUNAWAY HORSES, THE TEMPLE OF DAWN, and THE DECAY OF THE ANGEL, the last
being completed on the morning he committed public suicide in the 
traditional manner) without throwing up, then you\'re either too jaded to
live or you\'ve just gotten some GREAT game fodder, or both. 

I\'m curious about the new releases; are reviews forthcoming, Mac? there
aren\'t any game stores to speak of in Tennessee....

And on "what constitutes a good adventure," I favor mysteries to be solved,
a great deal of personal interaction and character development, intricate
plots, and brief, sudden, and highly unpleasant bits of violence to keep
things hopping. I keep my characters relatively poor and weak, give and
take away riches and power quite casually, and hit them with foes that are
too powerful for them, secure in the knowledge that gamers of the calibre
of those with whom I play will always improve themselves to the point of
being able to handle things before the situation becomes hopeless. I pace
things quickly, and I never open a rule book if I can help it.

Well, I much prefer the second one.  The first address just extends the distance
the message has to travel (and extends the time by at least two hours :-), the
message is sent from here to the address only to be bounced back.  The first
address is also of a TEMPORARY nature.

Could anyone who has an alias for me, make sure it is the second one above that
is used.

As to response time: if everything goes well, you can expect a response
overnight.  If not it may take as long as a week or rarely longer :-(.

        TiskTiskTisk, Metlay (I\'d be stronger, but there may be children
looking in...)! No Reading? Reading is the only thing that gets me through a
typical day. Even if its only for 15 minutes before falling asleep (yes, I am
married...luckily my wife reads too!). Oh, well, I\'m sure you\'ll get back in
the habit soon......

        About books, etc.: I must say I agree with your taste in authors. RAH
was one of my all time favorite writers, even with his somewhat distorted views
concerning women (he was, after all, a product of his generation...). And
E.E."Doc Smith ranks right up there! Not only his more famous LENSMAN and
SKYLARK series, but for intrigue and plots that translate Directly into a
MegaTraveller universe, read his "Family D\'Lambert" series (SP? Im not home and
don\'t have the books in front of me) . Here is a whole family of Covert agents,
wandering the galaxy and doing the Emperor\'s dirty work disguised as a
travelling circus! IRIS would be proud....
        Another name I can add to the list is Jo Clayton. Her "Skeen" trilogy
may start on on world (with some Very Strange aliens....), but it ends up as a
far reaching Galactic Trip. Also, Skeen\'s occupation is one that could fit in
well...she\'s a "rooner" (sp?), that is she makes a living finding artifacts and
art objects, for a price.
        And, for all you Space Opera buffs, I can also offer John Campbell
(yes, THE John Campbell: He wasn\'t always an editor/publisher), especially his
"The Dark Star Passes".
        Well, that should keep you reading for a while. Most of you....

world building process automated and another set of disks with the
UPP\'s for several *sectors* on them.  The cost was $24.95 for each set
of disks.

This strikes me as being considerable easier and more legal than
downloading the stuff from GEnie.  It would probably be cheaper, too.

No one ever answered my question about the costs to characters of using X-boat
communication.  (I was deeply hurt)  To recap:  "What is the cost of sending a
message to a friend several parsecs distant, and what procedures do you use in
your campaigns?"  (You aren\'t letting them do it for *free*, are you?)

This weekend, ignorant barbarians entered my car and stole my suitcase full of
Traveller gear, along with less important stuff like my driver\'s license and
checkbook.  (a pox upon their houses!)  Lucky for me, the large words involved
caused the criminals to dump the Traveller books in the woods not far away from
my house, which I found the next day.  (Saved!)

I did have a few frantic moments, though, and I called GDW to see how much of
the out-of-print stuff could still be had.  (Thanks again to those of you who
helped me get this stuff in the first place!)  I was a little suprised to have
Marc Miller answer the phone, and he was real helpful.  He offered to handle my
order himself, saying he knew where some of what I needed was gathering dust.
Real nice, you know?

The cool thing about all this is that I don\'t have to balance my checkbook this
month...   (For a moment there I thought I was off the hook for my much-delayed
TJ-Transport deck plans, but I guess you have to take the good with the bad.)

- ----

I have a copy of the "Vilani & Vargr" Aliens module.  I like it.  There are
very, very helpful sections for each race, giving a couple of pages of
excellent roleplaying examples for each.  Also, non-human races are completely
illustrated (yes, a Vargr bikini would be silly).  There are nice examples of
Vargr starship technology- maybe 6 ships, with stats.  There are also deck
plans for the much-feared Corsair.  Pretty ok product.  I found the Vargr more
interesting than I thought I would, and the Vilani less so.  (IMHO)

Are there release dates for the rest of the series?

Does anyone have any first-hand information on GDW\'s "Fighting Ships", or DGP\'s
"The Black Duke"?

Why is it that none of the published ship descriptions I have seen (excepting

Is the Imperium using them, or not?  On what class of ships?

Does anyone have any play experience in a campaign that contained Black Globes?

Their governments gave them all a nice budget, and they have gone and
purchased the best equipment that money could buy (TL 14, 15, and a
couple examples of TL 16). They are going to be many parsecs from
a TL13+ planet, and want to carry some "Electonic and mechanical spares".
I am not going to let them get off that easily: The following is a plan
I have for repairs, I would appreciate your comments, and any comments
you would have on what the planets would be like towards the core. After
all, there is no empire that way, the ancients, as far as I know didn\'t
proceed overly far in that direction.

Optional repair rules:

Assume:
1) All equipment can be broken down into 4 types: Mono-material, simple, 
complex, and highly complex.
2) There are only a limited number of "critical" parts, the rest can be
fashoned from generic spare parts. e.g. your TV has some ciritals, Picture
tube, tuner, flyback transformer, etc. However a lot of the secondary
circuitry can be repaired with a good selection of standard electronic parts.

Rules:
Any time damage results, roll once on the critical part tables per 10%
damage done to the object, re-rolling most duplicates. Each critcal part 
should appear once on the chart, have an average value of 5% of the price of 
the entire object, and be placed on the table in a semblance of frequency of
damage. 
Note that spare parts of one tech level difference, increase the repair task 
difficulty by one level. Otherwise use the standard repair tasks. A higher 
tech level will have parts on hand for 1-3 tech levels lower, and can 
fabricate parts of many tech levels lower. A lower tech level will have 
limited ability to produce items at the next tech level. 
Most parts, with time, may be able to be fabricated from their componet parts, 
others should be so indicated (eg. Lanthium grid, no lanthium, no repair).

Table examples:

Mono-material: e.g. Chair
	Table? - Only a limited amount of material types. A piece of wood,
	metal etc. is all you need (plus the corrrect tools to cut and
	otherwise shape the material, and fasten it together).

Simple: eg. Fuse Box
	Use an equal, probability table, d3, d6, d10, etc. depending on the
	number of "critial" parts. Multiple occurences are common.
	eg: 1) Fuse 2) Socket 3) Casing 4) Wire

Complex: Eg. TV
	Use 2 dice probability table, 2d3, 2d6, 2d10, etc. very few parts
	will be multiple occurences.
	eg: 2) Speaker 3) Chassis 4) Horizontal control 5) Transformer
	6) Tuner 7) Knobs 8) Picture Tube 9) Automatic adjustment
	10) Vertical Control 11) Amplifier 12) Sync Circuit
	
Highly Comples: Eg. Jump Drive
	Use either 3 die table, or use 2 die with subtables
	(e.g. 8-fusion plant, and generate a table for this, or conviently
	use a table already generated. eg computer could use TV table for
	a monitor).

Notes:

Not all the parts need to be named (I\'m not a starship drive engineer), and
made-up names can be just as good. "It\'s the Flux-amplifer captain"

The most common parts, could be the least expensive or the most depending on
how delicte the machine is, and how mean you are.

These rules assume you use the x% damaged results, and that the material cost
is approx. 1/2 the repair cost - the rest is labour, which the PC\'s are
supplying.

These rules allow the PC a contol over what spare parts they are getting. 
They can estimate based on the table, if they really need to get that
spare amplifier circuit for their holodisplay.

Maintenace to equipment could also use these tables, to repace a single part,
or a good mechanic after examining the equpment, may be given the results of
one die roll, so they can have an idea where the next failure will
probably occur. (Uncertain task).

(1) Our very-deviant traveller game is split into two region of space.
The founding GM shows up here occaisionally, Cap\'n Paul GAZIS.  The original
campaign has the higher tech level of the two, but is still several levels 
below normal Imperial games.  And is currently having a minor war fought over
a planet near the "border" (Zoo region) of the Scarp, the backwater in which
the TL 9-11 game is set.  This is very low interaction co-development.

(2) the grand old MIT game Eastern Isles has not only had multiple GMs for
the main game, as the refs graduated, but has split into parallel regions,
with a Ref per island.  (Not traveller, and not D&D; a unique FRPG rulset,
which is classified -- only the Ref\'s have been formally briefed as to what
the rules are.)  They\'ve also had a sub-GM for character generation.

(3) My wife and I are coGMing a GURPS Fantasy campaign.  I handle mechanics,
she handles characterization, we share plotting.  This works failry well.
Advice about not arguing in front of the players previously given is very
good.  Conspiring in advance about likely plot occurences is wise!
   We synergize well because my wife is a storyteller, and the world we 
game in is her invention, but she has no experience in GMing and no desire 
to learn any rulessystem well enough to have it intrude in her relationship
with the fantasy.  Her training is comparative mythology and anthropology,
mine in math/analytical skills.  So I figure out how to make climatolgically
sound continents and a sound local economy, and figure out how to make her 
ideas of magic fit into a playable game.   She invents characers and plots
with which to tantalize the players.

(5) Lee & Barry Gold (publishers of Alurums & Excursions, an RPG APAzine)
coGM everything they play, almost.  When Lee GMs, she has Barry play key
NPCs; she briefs him in advance or slips him notes etc as necc.  When Barry
ran a Chivalry and Sorcery game (ghods, I\'m dating them!), Lee would spin
off a dozen or more possible plot twists that she could conceive of as
extensions of the last play session before the other players showed up.
He would pick one or embroider between on his own as GM, while she played
as a normal player, happily mystified as to which he was using.
    (This is paraphrased from a recent note of Lee\'s in either A&E, her mag,
or The Wild Hunt, the east coast (amiable) "competition", whose address
has been given here before.)  Lee\'s address available on request to
anyone who wants to send her a few bucks for a sample issue...

(5) A couple we know, Dan & Nancy, (who also play in the deviant traveller),
(not so) recently ran an INteractive Literature weekend game together.  I\'m
not sure how they divided the work; but I gather IL games usuaully require
multiple referees, since a dozen or more players are interacting in knots
throughout the hotel.

(6) Can someone at Princeton get a Princecon GM to report on how they
have multiple GMs of their Fantasy RPG system running threads or sub-quests
of one plot?  (Princecon is a weekend long RPG con with all games inter-
related.  Foolcon was similar while it lasted, but smaller.  Both are
like IL or Mystery Weekend games, but of the sit-around-the-table RPG
variety, rather than the wander-around-the-hotel-dressed-funny (IL/MW)
variety.

	When you have a condition where the fastest mode of communication
is by hand you have a situation quite unlike our own. In fact it most
closely corresponds to the middle ages. Using that as a source one can draw
several posibilities.
	Nobles and guilds had their own messengers. If they wanted something
sent, they sent it themselves, by their own servant. The cost of several
high-passages is certainly comparable to what was paid on trains of relay
horses. For those who would have gone the whole distance, but on one horse,
there is always low passage.
	Those not of such high finances usually sought out a traveller who
was journeying towards where they wanted the message delivered. They would then
pay them to deliver the message when they reached their destination often
with the promise of further payment by the recipient. Far traders are excellent
choices.
	In Traveller one can have further possibilities, the most notable
being the courier. An individual from a responsible company is entrusted
with the item and seeks passage to the destination. Cost? Well it will be at
least the middle passage fare to the destination (and back if a reply is 
desired) plus the salary of the individual (500Cr). If security is a concern
just charge 500Cr per basic skill rank in what they require. If you want
someone with Streetwise-1 Handgun-2 that\'s a basic salary of 1500Cr.
	Liners with fixed routes probably allocate a ton or two of cargo
to reserved mail. Costs would be based on the price for a ton of freight
divided by the volume and weight, a (probably hefty) handling charge and
of course, the cost of postage at the far end.
	I assume X-boats don\'t necessarly use all their data space for
imperial intelligence and messages. The scouts can sell excess data space
to private customers on a standby basis (high mail vs middle mail?). Of course
no individual would wish to send sensitive information this way.
	I wouldn\'t think there would be enough call for interstellar main to
justify an actual mail network (poni express notwithstanding) but as always
it depends on your actual universe...

Regarding acquiring out-of-print GDW products (Traveller and otherwise)
the Weekend Warrior, in Los Angeles, is without a doubt the best bet
you\'ve got.  Here are just a few examples from their latest GDW catalog:

                                         Used     New
        Mercenary (Book 4)              $5.00   $10.00
        High Guard (Book 5)             $5.00   $10.00
        Scouts (Book 6)                 $5.00   $10.00
        Merchant Prince (Book 7)        $5.00   $10.00
        Robots (Book 8)                 $5.00   $10.00

There are also entries for all the Supplements (1 thru 12) except no. 5,
most of the adventures, and a good number of the Alien Modules.  They also
carry a lot of the boxed games (Snapshot, Beltstrike, Azhanti High Lightning,
and others).  Most of what\'s available can be purchased new, or used at a
reduced price.  Last week I actually got a mint (still shrinkwrapped) copy
of Striker, for $20.00!

So, if any of you folks are looking to fill out your Traveller paraphernalia,
this is definitely the place to try.  The address and phone are:

        Weekend Warrior
        8116 Van Noord Ave.
        N. Hollywood, CA 91605
        (818) 988-1441

Most of the time, a phone call will get you an answering maching asking for
your order (just like DGP! :-)), but occasionally you will actually get
a real person who can answer any questions you may have.

BTW, if any of you are in (or going to be in) the L.A. area and are thinking
about stopping by, Don\'t.  This isn\'t a retail shop, it\'s strictly a mail-
order business.  I made this mistake and discovered that \'Mike\' (the owner)
is an LA County Deputy Sheriff and just does this out of his garage as a
sideline (a very successful one at that, since he\'s been in business for
6 years and has no plans to quit).  You may have seen ads in Challenge magazine
for the place.

One final note: Mike told me that he just made a 1-shot deal with GDW to
re-print 1000 copies of the K\'Kree Alien Module, since they\'re currently
100% un-available and the demand is so high.  I\'ve already got MY name on
his waiting list!

FYI, Weekend Warrior also carries a large line of old SPI products as well.
If you call or write, you might want to ask for ALL of the catalogs, not
just the GDW one.

his backpack when it contained "the campaign", *ouch*.

Hey ho,

>From the Library Data section of _The Traveller Adventure_ :

	X-mail costs:

		Cr 10 per 20 kilobits per parsec
		Cr 20 for a 200 x 200 bit matrix picture

At it\'s destination, X-mail is sent via the world\'s mail system.

Actually, I don\'t know if this is reasonable or not, since the players never
wanted to send a message by X-Boat in my game, so it just never came up.
Opinions?  Should it be more expensive?

P.S.:  Has anybody seen GDW\'s _Imperium Fighting Ships_ yet?  Are the
numbers all wrong in regard to the vehicle design rules, as we\'ve seen in
other publications?

Well, I currently know of 41 (!) people who have applied for the 
PBEM.  About 33 have approved characters.  About 18 or so are active.
About 12 are *really* active.

I have not turned away anyone who has asked to play.  Some people have
dropped out for various reasons, some have not played at all.  I would
entertain more requests, but might put some constraints on the player/
character since the game is already underway.

I get about 50 - 80 messages every day.  This is a lot of work.  Well
worth it though.  Most of my time with the PBEM is spent collating
information, weeding out the secret stuff, and generating a turn.  Other
than that, I forward mail for some who cannot get through, and 
generally cause confusion where it is least needed.

I imagine that the E-mail load I have is typical for all the people
on the Command team, who are fileding a lot of character interaction
for me.  I like this, BTW.  It adds to the game to have the *characters*
doing things, thinking things through.

Several players have told me that this PBEM is one of the best they\'ve
played.  I prefer to be humble here - this is my first shot at it.
Besides, the ones who don\'t like it will or have quickly dorpped out.

For this game - be prepared to do a lot of chracterizing.  We haven\'t
gotten much blood and guts yet, but there has been considerable
brain work and organization work from the characters.  For example, I\'m
building a really good file of *usable in the real world* ringworld
engineering specs!  (Thanks to the physical scientists.)

Other than that - this game is a chaotic anarchy with occasional input
from a benevolent oligarch (me).

Hope that helps

	The MegaTraveller Computer Game for IBM PC will be released on
May 1, 1990!!!!!

	1991 will be a good year for MegaTraveller. At least six products are
planned for MegaTraveller. GDW has decided to increase its support on MT.

	the six products are

	an unknown adventure module by Mike Stackpole, who is a really nice
guy and a good writer. I believe he has written a few novels for BattleTech
by FASA, and two short stories for ShadowRun Anthology. (Yes, by FASA too. 
Hey, ShadowRun, along with 2300 AD and Traveller are three of my favorite 
games! grin) In fact, next issue of Challenge (#44), you\'ll get to see a
ShadowRun short story by him.

	A boxed set of player materials and deck plans.

	"The Rebel\'s Tale" by Joe Fugate & HIWG

	a world source book by J. Andrew Keith

	2nd survey data! Yes, finally!!!!

	And something called "Star Viking", appearantly miniature rules.

By the way, MegaTraveller now has Spanish, German, Japanese version. Talk about
internation gaming! 

	I don\'t really know what "The Rebel\'s Tale" is. I have a few guesses,
but I don\'t like to make guesses on the mailing list. Anyway, more on this
as the info arrives from my secret Scout service. (grin) 

	Anyway, this is what\'s in 1991 for MegaTraveller.

	Oh, once again. The standard disclaimer. All info are provided by
Marc Miller and Joe Fugate. Various game titles are copyright by various

Notes
~~~~~
The OmniCom can be extremely useful in all sorts of situations - exploratory
expeditions, diplomatic missions, trade negotiations, etc.  It is an expert
in matters relating to language, translation and communication.
 
Although it doesn\'t have artificial intelligence in the strictest sense
(lacking \'creative thought\'), it is an extremely smart machine.  It has 40%
synaptic and 30% parallel processing.  The apparent intelligence of 12 is
the maximum that can be achieved at TL 15.  It also has a large learning
capacity - indeed, some of the more experienced models have been known to
become highly opinionated (which can be great fun for the referee,
especially in conjunction with the emotion simulation).  It is quite
capable of grasping some difficult concepts like tact and diplomacy ("The
Aslan is not very happy that you have parked your ATV on his foot...").
 
The robot has a variety of equipment to help it do its job.  A language
translator is installed, which is similar to those described in the MT
Imperial Encyclopedia or the World Builder\'s Handbook.  There is a video
display which can be used to depict written text or pictorial images.
Some models have even learned to imitate facial expressions.  An odor
emitter is very useful for communicating with K\'kree.  The two light arms
can be used for a number of purposes such as communicating by touch or
gesture, or just changing the memclips.  The OmniCom can also interface
with almost any sort of communications equipment.
 
Physical description: The OmniCom is a spherical, grav-propelled robot
about 0.5 metres in diameter with 2 light arms and numerous sensors,
peripherals and interfaces.

Here is what I charged:

Per page of text:	Cr10
Per page of picture:	Cr20

Civilian cipher:	*5
Military cipher:	*10

Distance:		*(1 + log(no. of jumps))

The old Supplement 12, "Forms And Charts", gave two forms for X-boat messages.
IS Form 6 was for text, IS Form 7 was for images.  So a Form 6 costs Cr10, and
a Form 7 costs Cr20.  Both forms say "The message/image will be optically
sensed and transmitted to the addressee above" and also had entries for date
of preparation, addressee and destination.

"Civilian cipher" is a fairly simple code, really only useful against casual
inspection.  Its best use is against nosey postmasters.  "Military cipher" is
more secure, and difficult (but not impossible) to crack. However, if the
client can prove to the IISS that the message was decoded by unauthorised
persons, they get their money back and the IISS changes its code.  Unscrupulous
senders could try to fake "proof", but the IISS checks claims quite thoroughly.
Some money is lost that way; it is covered by the higher cost of the more
secure cipher, and the money-back guarantee is one way of detecting leaks.
"Unauthorised persons" doesn\'t include Imperial authorities.  Never mind
morality here; there\'s no point in the IISS guaranteeing security against
them - in fact, to do so is probably illegal.

The "log" in the distance factor is base 10.  Thus, 1-9 jumps has a factor of
1; 10-99 jumps has a factor of 2; etc.  The number of jumps includes the
scout/couriers which may be involved at either end.

So, to send this message (3 pages, text only) up to 9 jumps away (enough for
most purposes) using civilian cipher (don\'t want it read by USENET, do we :-)
costs 3 * 10 * 5 * 1 = Cr150.

The time between sending and receiving is worked out as follows:

Per X-boat jump:	7 days
Per scout/courier jump:	4D days (minimum 7 days)
Miscellaneous transition delays (calculated for each jump):
			2D - 6 days (minimum 0 days)

Assuming an X-boat is ready, there is no delay at either end of its jump.  All
its mail is dumped into the tender\'s computer and re-assigned to other boats
within the hour.  There may be a delay involved if no X-boat going the right
way is available, or if the tender is somewhere else, or if any of hundreds of
other minor delays crop up.  Scout/couriers aren\'t always present; in fact,
the message almost always has to wait for one to arrive.

This all assumes, of course, that everything is working as it should be.  It
is up to the referee to deal with the effects of the civil war.

In the last couple of weeks, Nick Sylvain, Dan Corrin, and I have
been discussing interstellar justice.  What are the mechanics of
formal "justice" in MT?  How is the term defined? and similar
questions have come up.  we\'ve been mainly discussing military
systems, but the question is starting to bloom.

This very question has also occured in other campaigns, so I figured
we could move it out here where we could all poke at it.    RDJ


A Few assumtions I\'ve made:

	It is really difficult to maintain judicial consistency
	throughout a widely separated empire.

	Imperial justice is not at all similar to that of other species
	or even of Humaniti (Vilani, Solomani, etc.) in smaller domains
	such as subsectors.

	Military justice systems are different from civil systems.

	Accepted use of psi-probe methods does not radically alter any
	court proceeding. (If it is accepted/used.)

	"Crime" is subjective, and varies from planet to planet and
	sector to sector.

	"Imperial" courts are almost always appelate.  That is, if you
	don\'t like being railroaded by that LL13 religious oligarchy,
	you can, in theory, appeal for imperial intervention.  What
	heppens then, is of course game material.

Well, there\'s lots more to say, but that\'s why it\'s here: to start a
conversation :-)
Have at \'er folks.

Last weekend I got into a round of swapping "sea-stories" with some
other veterans of the US Navy, and the subject of seasickness came
up.   We all had tales to tell of some unfortunate soul or another
who fell into the the clutches of this inner ear affliction in one
form or another.

The question that came to my mind is this:   Is there an equivilant
to this in space travel?   I definitly could see it in a zero G
environment, but what about in a ship with grav compensators?

This problem could have some definite effects on play within the
Traveller universe.    For instance, a spacesick character in combat
would not be as effective in a fight as someone who is not.  Spacesick
navigators could end up screwing up the calculations for a jump and
that could result in a misjump.

Any thoughts folks?

I have an old Journal issue (not currently at hand) which had some
interesting things to say on this issue, with one article on police forces

help this discussion.

As an aside, this article made Admin the skill which makes one a lawyer -
which I find a bit strange, especially since the new Legal skill seems to
make it quite clear that it doesn\'t qualify one to be a lawyer. The question
then is, what does? If PCs can be doctors, engineers, bureaucrats, et al, why
not lawyers too? (I can see it now -- "If you\'ve been injured in a spacecraft

        On a planetary scale, I\'d agree. However, at least as far as the
old Journal article goes, after the local justice are the Subsector (Sector?)
courts and then the Imperial courts. As the "level" of the court increases,
the variation in law decreases.

        This is a good point. It is likely that appeals of planetary cases
would only make it to the lower levels of the Imperial courts, such as the
Subsector courts, barring truly unusual circumstances. (What follows is my
ramblings about how the Imperial courts might work.)
        At the Subsector (Imperial) level, the courts would have original
jurisdiction for inter-planetary ordinary crimes (fraud, unlawful flight,
smuggling, etc.) and minor Imperial crimes (Violating planetary interdiction,
forgery of Imperial documents, bribery, etc.). Appellate jurisdiction of all
major planetary crimes (i.e. substantial jail/civil damages or capital case),
though at this and higher levels, a review is not at all assured.
        At the Sector (Imperial) level, the courts would have original
jurisdiction for more serious Imperial crimes (illegal weapon trading,
violating the Imperial Rules of War, slave trading, murder of Imperial
officials or nobles, ecosystem destruction, etc.). Appellate jurisdiction of
Subsector cases, and if you\'ve got connections or money or both, perhaps even
a planetary case.
        The highest, true Imperial courts, would likely only have original
jurisdiction for the most henious Imperial crimes -- such as high treason,
sedition, or murder of an Archduke or the Emperor. Appellate jurisdiction of
Sector cases, a few Subsector cases, and a one in a million planetary case.
        Given the nature of planetary law, the punishments and procedures
are highly variable -- especially at the higher levels (like the religious
dictatorships) I\'m sure they can be quite creative... (All you have to do
to prove your innocence is fight little (ha hah) Og here. To the death.
With a butterknife. He gets a battleaxe. Questions?) :-)
        At least at the Subsector level, trial by jury seems like a good
possibility. At higher levels, it\'s still possible, but a tribunal of
judges seems more likely - as befits the gravity and/or political stickiness
of the case. As for punishment, well, it\'s not a pretty sight. As the TAS
article suggested, for Imperial crimes it\'s generally measured in decades
in an Imperial prison (anyone remember the ex-Kinunir class ship, the Gaesh,
used as a prison hulk?) or a nice clean execution. For the WORST Imperial
crimes.... I doubt you\'d last long.
        That\'s enough of my ramblings for now. You\'ll have to excuse me,
I\'m a lawyer-to-be. (William & Mary, here I come!)
        One last ramble -- a particularly enjoyable game of classic Traveller
of mine was based on the "Prison Planet" adventure, which had PCs "visit" a
dreadful Imperial prison mining operation on a desert planet, which was a LONG
way from the only major city. (And only a class D starport to boot). If you
survived this prison, you were LUCKY or nearly dead...

instant knockout to disable higher functions?), and 4) How long is the

        Those questions refer to a tranq dart that actually penetrates
the skin (such as is used today). The same questions would, I assume,
have different answers for a tranq-gas shell, that breaks on impact and
and creates a "danger space" situation. How are those handled?

Man!  If the price is right, count me in!  I\'d kill small populations just
to get to meet everybody (or most of everybody) face to face!  I can just
see us all now: milling around in a rented hotel conference room, holding
plastic cups of fruit punch, each wearing a sticky-tag with the words,
"Hi! I\'m _Adrian_Bishop_", or "Hi! I\'m _Count_Ger_", or "Out\'a my way,

=================

So how \'bout this bizzare idea, folks?  A Mailing-list or a PBEM
convention somewhere, sometime?  Since I started it, I must say that
I like the idea.  There\'s a lot of stuff to think about first
however:

	Where would we meet?  GDW\'s home town?  (I forget where that is)
	When?
	How would we distribute the expenses of such a venture?
	Could we talk Marc Miller and/or Joe Fugate into showing?
		 (would we want to?)
	What would we do?

Here\'s my initial answers to the above questions:
	Where: I like Wisconsin (think that\'s where it is) but that
	       might make it too expensive for most folks, both
		   east-coasters and west-coasters.  A secondary choice I
		   would like is mid-west somwhere, like maybe Chicago area.
		   Of course, to be fair to everyone, including those on
		   other continents we should meet somewhere like, oh,
		   Tahiti :-).

	When:  My first preference (a strong one) is sometime within a
	       week or so of Labor Day (Sept. 3).  That (long) weekend
		   would be almost ideal for me (at this tme).

	Expenses: Ugh.  We don\'t need no stinking expenses.  Having
		   never tried this before, I don\'t know.  Probably share
		   out the location fees and personals are personals?

	Guests: There are others who might want to show - like our SO\'s?
		   Should we tell them to go fly a kite?  Anyone else have
		   any good ideas for guests?  Anyone want to ask Herr
		   Miller or Herr Fugate?

	What:  Depends on who wants to do this, and a host of other
		   factors.  I think we should table that discussion until
		   we decide *if* we really want to do this.

Funny you should ask about tranq rounds, Bruce... the one section of
the MegaTraveller and Trav-Classic rules to which I can lay undisputed
claim, aside from one version of the Autoshotgun (a superior version
than the one in the current rules IMO) and the stats on Roup/Spinward
Marches, are the rules on tranqs, which appeared in their entirety in
JTAS #23 and were sadly chopped for the MegaTrav rule books. I really
wish I had the JTAS article here in Tennessee with me, but I\'ll try
to pass along the basics of my rules:

1. Tranq rounds are instantaneously effective and produce total
   unconsciousness in less than two seconds at any TL above 8 (\'cause
   that\'s where we are now, and that\'s how fast they are now). The 
   primary difference between current tranquilizers and the ones at
   TL 9 or better is that the latter are metabolically linked; they
   maintain the body at an exact level of unconsciousness until used
   up. This means that the one fatal danger of current tranqs (overdoses)
   and its associated danger (underdoses--"Well, I put what I *think*
   was the right dose in the needle, but I didn\'t want to overdo it and
   kill the poor critter. Not enough? Well, stay out of the cage until
   it takes effect....") is not a concern any longer; you can\'t give someone
   a fatal dose, so you load each round with enough beetlejuice to stop
   a Virushi in a bad mood.

2. You do NOT have to penetrate the skin to tranq someone, just hit exposed
   skin. A little DMSO mixed with the tranq and it just sucks itself right
   into their pores, no problem. That\'s the true nature of tranq rounds,
   at least in the original rules... no gases, no injections. Skin contact
   is all that matters, not inhalation and not penetration. This means that
   neither gas masks nor non-sealed armor do any good, if the round splashes
   hard enough to touch any exposed skin.

3. Tranq rounds are not really gas rounds per se, they are atomized tranq
   vapor rounds, effective on contact. This gives them a fairly small danger
   space in comparison to true gas rounds, but still more than one target,
   even on a snub pistol shot. The exceptions to this rule are true gas 
   rounds or grenades (used at lower TLs, generally, or in enclosed spaces
   where there\'s cover but the air is close) and true penetrating rounds
   (for subduing armored foes; these rounds do some real damage as well as
   tranq effects, and are usually loaded in Gauss weapons).

4. Tranqs are to some extent species-specific; a human-based tranq will stop
   ANY type of humaniti, or a Vargr, but will not faze a K\'Kree or a Hiver,
   will KILL a Droyne in its tracks, and drive an Aslan into a psychotic
   frenzy. In other words, know thy enemy!

5. At lower TLs where such drugs are not available, things are messier. It
   takes anywhere up to 30 seconds for a properly measured dose of tranq
   to knock out a man, and even longer for an angry animal. There are side
   effects, and the possibility of overdose is very real. That\'s why police
   still use tear gas to dispell crowds, rather than tranqing them.

Astute readers may note that I\'ve added a few things to what originally 
appeared in the JTAS article; I am planning a piece for either CHALLENGE
or the TRAVELLERS\' DIGEST reiterating some of this stuff, and outlining
design philosophies for nonlethal weaponry at higher tech levels, as an
extension to my original article (which has never been reprinted) and as
an improvement on the vague and occasionally unimaginitive rules in the
books. (Whaddaya mean, they\'re still using tranq gas at TL15?!) If there\'s
interest in this topic, let me know, and I\'ll push the Nonlethal Alternatives
article to the top of my "pending" list....

PS> The implications of this technology are staggering, if one thinks about
    it for a while. Just as two examples, it\'s possible for a society to
    simultaneously eliminate accidental gun-related deaths and decriminalize
    gun ownership, and the nature of police response to threat will also
    change drastically (they\'re much more likely to go in shooting)....

As for the duration and type of effects, that\'s open for a wide degree
of latitude, by the way. There will be paralyzing agents, motor control
disconnectors, and so forth, in addition to sleep inducers. And that\'s
only on the RIGHT side of the law! Consider a compound like LACE (lysergic
acid crypto-ethylene), a nifty little chemical that combines the
best features of LSD and DMSO; get a little on your skin, and in
less than thirty seconds you\'re tripped out of your gourd.

Sound like sci-fi? Abbie Hoffman was using it on cops in the 1960s.

Wonderful idea, as long as it\'s in Oregon or Washington :-).

Seriously, not to cast aspersions, but these things can get expensive,
what with plane fare and all.  I\'d ask a travel agent what seasons are
best for rates on airfare, and we could book a few rooms in a Motel 6 or
something (I call for the Embassy Suites out here in Beaverton :-) I can
see it, along with most of the southwestern part of the Tualitan Valley
out my back window :-).

I suppose the most important question to ask is, how many of you would
be willing to pay something like:

	Round Trip Air Fare		$300.00
	Lodging (3 nights @ $50)	 150.00
	Food (3 days @ $25)		  75.00
	Miscellaneous			  50.00
					----
					$575.00

And that doesn\'t include the trips to Mt.  St.  Helens, the Pacific
Ocean, Beer, or wild gaming spending sprees at The Military Corner.  As
for myself, I\'d love to meet you guys, but costs can be hard on the
pocketbook....  I must note that the two "TML Lunches" I tried to throw
did not come out as well as I\'d hoped.

The TML has about 205 listees, about 10-15 seem to be wildly avid gamers
silly enough to have a "convention".  Throw in another 5 that are local
to the convention area and that gives us 15-20 people.  Still enough to
play a lot of fun Traveller, see the local sights, and get a tour of
your host\'s workplace.

Some other silly ideas:

	have local micro-con attendees put up two or three long distance
	vistors.

	spread the costs around to help reduce the airfare for those
	flying in, and stay with local attending TMLer\'s.  We should
	call this the "communist TMLer\'s con", or "TML commie con" for
	short.  If half flew and half hosted/drove, the costs would come
	down a little, although its still pretty pricey.

	if our con is very close to DGP or GDW headquarters, we may be
	able to pitch in enough to make one or more official dignataries
	show up, like Marc Miller, Joe Fugate, or Gary Thomas.  I\'ll bet
	they\'re pretty busy people, though!

	abandon our own con idea and develop a contingent of TMLer\'s at
	an existing and preplanned Con.

As soon as I posted it, I realized I needed to get the guys out of
the airlock.  Here\'s what happens.

Richard
	richard@agora.rain.com
	richard@agora.uucp

- - ---- Airlock 4 ----

Anton gasps as the air and blood leave the leg and propel him accross the
airlock into the space just vacated by Fitz.  Fitz frantically worms his 
way around in the airlock, attempting to find a position where he can get 
his hands around the leg of Anton\'s suit, before the low-pressure-augmented 
blood loss gets really serious.  Just enough air is now in the lock to hear 
the distinctive `crunch\' of Anton\'s helmet on the hull.

Red, sticky globules begin slowly falling and coating everything, including
Fitz\'s faceplate, and gravity begins to return.  Working through the red
filter and haze, Fitz manages to find a place to grab Anton\'s leg and start
sealing the suit and wound.  "...only 20 seconds more, let\'s see, stop
the bleeding and hope he\'s only anoxic.  Sure hope he didn\'t break that
thick skull of his.  Sure wish I could see..."

"Anyone in the air lock, this is Ian.  I\'m here with a medkit and Dulinor.
We\'re ready to transport Anton as soon as we can open this door."

<Fitz>
DULI -WHO!?!!

<Ian>
"Sorry.  Doc named the medbots Dulinor and Lucan.  Sorry to scare you.  Door
opening now.  Dulinor, standard prep.  Slow him while I help get the 
bleeding stopped.

"Uh, you, Fitz?  Anyway, you\'d better come alond with me to sickbay if your
department can afford you for a few minutes.  Whatever you do, don\'t let go
of that leg."

The medbot, with precision only a machine could muster, removes Anton\'s
helmet, cleanly cuts his vacc suit\'s right leg and left arm, and readies
an IV and a respirator.  As soon as the clothing is on it\'s way to the deck,
the IV and respirator are applied while Dulinor begins resuscitation.
By now, Fitz and Ian have managed to make it to the deck with Anton\'s leg
in their hands and the whole assembly moves off at high speed for the Aurora.

<Ian>
Doc, Ian.  We\'ve got him and are comin\' (pant).  Should be there in about 
20 seconds; better open up now, if you can.  Your readings should be 
starting now. (pant) I need a vacation.  \'Vouf and Thule, if you\'re 
listenin\' (pant), thanks for the early-morning sprints.  
(pant)
(pant)
Looks like a clean amputation doc. (pant)  Any artifacts probably got
tossed in the decmpression.


And they arrive at the Aurora.

  Type NX Battlerider
  
       The NX (for Meson Gun-N, Experimental) battlerider was designed by the 
  Imperial Glisten Navy as a replacement for the venerable 10kton Rider.  After 
  successful evaluation trials, construction was begun in 1111.  It was 
  intended that the Lobachevsky class fleet tenders be updated as new squadrons 
  of 9 NXs were available to replace the squadrons of 15 10kton riders.  This 
  changeover was not complete in 1117 when most of the IGN was deployed to 
  fight the Aslan in the Trojan Reach sector.  Maneuver and life support 
  require about 40% of the total power plant capacity, and each hour at full 
  combat power uses 2.5 hours of endurance.  A fuel purifier is provided even 
  though it is not required for the craft\'s own fuel, for tactical flexibility 
  in refueling of the parent craft.

  400 Ton Cargo Carrier TL15
  
       This Type R variant was ordered in 1119 by a small trading company 
  operating in the Spinward Marches.  Unsettled conditions make possession of a 
  good sensor array and a strong weapons package vital to the independent 
  trader.  Three gunnery robots would ordinarily be carried along with one 
  human gunner.  Additional human crew could be carried at double occupancy of 
  staterooms.

  Ultima Racing Grav Bike TL15
  
       The Ultima was built at the direction of a large corporation seeking 
  publicity for their products.  Absolutely no expense was spared in its con-
  struction.  Since the entire design was aimed at providing the highest possi-
  ble acceleration, there are two major limitations on the operation of the 
  vehicle: Speed is limited to 4200kph in atmosphere.  Beyond this speed exces-
  sive heating of the hull with resultant structural failure may occur.  Sen-
  sors provide inadequate warning time at top speed, and top speed should 
  therefore only be used over a precalculated and cleared course where no 
  obstacles can be encountered.

  10 ton Ship\'s Boat TL8
  
       This ship\'s boat is equipped with modular connections, and can be used 
  with any of the TL8 modular spacecraft designs.  Intended only for landing 
  and other short operations, it has insufficient armor for long term radiation 
  protection for the crew. The life support system can be switched from provid-
  ing for the entire interior to providing only for the crew accommodations.  
  In the former mode, the batteries are sufficient to provide 4.4 hours of 
  power, in the latter mode, 24 hours.  In either case, vacc suits are recom-
  mended as a safety back-up for the crew.  Solar cells are sufficient to 
  operate the electronics indefinitely.  Rocket fuel will provide one hour of 
  full thrust.  This is not sufficient for takeoff from a large dense atmos-
  phere planet with a full cargo load.
