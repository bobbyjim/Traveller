During WW2 those US services that had female auxiliaries (and I think this
included the Nurses, tho that would date back to WW1, I guess) *officially*
required female officers to be referred to as "Sir" ... this was almost
universally ignored, in favour of "Ma\'am", and was eventually officially
replaced, AFAIR before the war was over.

The asteroid is approx. 30 years away - 2028.
The Mayan Calendar thing, I just plain forgot. I know its in the next century and
I think theres a 7 in it.  207x, 20x7.  (I think its in the background material in
the Shadowrun Rulebook).

Semo, you sir are a genius!  Have you seen the TROOPS parody of COPS and
Stormtroopers?  If you haven\'t, send me a blank zip disk and I\'ll fill put all
80 megs of this beautiful comedy treasure on it for you.  ST:TOS vs.
Stormtroopers is the next logical step!

I\'ll help write a script.  This must be done.  If nothing else, the idea must
be passed on to the TROOPS creators.

We have two grade of Warrant Officers - 

WO1 which replaces Sergeant Major and is still addressed as \'Sarn\'t Major\',
dresses as an NCO, etc. 

WO2 who is an officer in all but name, is addressed as \'Sir\', wears an
officers shoes, etc with his dress uniform.

The confusion is because the rank insignia for both is a wrist band WO1\'s
have a crown on it, WO2\'s the NZ coat of arms one is silver, and the other
gold but they look the same at first view so if the NCO in question is in a
normal day uniform it can get bloody sticky when you\'re only a Private or
Lance Corporal. Fortunately WO2s are rather rarer than Colonels of any type
and there aren\'t many of them, either.

The NZ Army gets most of its traditions from the British rather than
American military, and tends to view US traditions as inferior, probably in
revenge for you having all that lovely shiny kit, and vehicle to carry it
in. \'Light Infantry\' has got to be the biggest misnomer of the 20th century.

It used to annoy us was that the Malaysians and Indonesians use the US
style rank structure and we had to call someone who\'d only been in a few
years \'Sergeant\' when Regular Infantry would be lucky to have made full
Corporal by then here. It was also galling that they got to use the
Sergeants mess when they visited.

Once in the distant past some friends of mine used MT to play a game set

I doubt it, or myself and a lot of other people on the list wouldn\'t have
been annoyed by this nonsense.

Personally after looking at the headers and seeing that the messages were
sent using Eudora Pro 3 for Windows, I suspect either the spamming of the
list was on purpose or this idiot has the most ridiculous set of filters in
place ever.

Well, if you think Stormtroopers can\'t hit the broadside of a barn - 
check out the first fight in Star Wars, on board on Tantive IV. 

I bet many Rebel troopers would disagree with you (were they capable 
of doing it ;)). 

Now, Stormtroopers can\'t hit a broadside of a Hero, but that\'s 
entirely another thing. <grin>

and wipe out the annoying little..... should be here around 2028 ;-)

On a serious note, has anyone contacted Rob on this one or the Happy.mailer
at Kiev?

More likely, that VI should be a type V.

Imperium Games is *not* gone.  Phil will have to hold his dancing.

However, Missions of State, Which is the *22nd title* in the Traveller line
published, will probably not be followed by anything new soon.  In fact,
I\'d bet the T4.1 is the next item to be published and that not until the
Fall (GenCon maybe?).

It\'s time for Imperium Games to "hibernate" for awhile.  They have
considerable debts (including author\'s fees not yet paid) outstanding, and
paying staff to produce and/or administrate in more than a minimal way is
just not possible.  Traveller is not a fast-moving product, and taking some
time will allow revenue to flow in the door.  Fortunately, since the staff
of IG as we know it is actually Sweatpea staff \'on loan\' they can get away
with just a few hours a week of payroll whereas a \'freestanding\' company
could not.

They are still shipping to distributors, distributors are still shipping to
your local game store.  Their web site is still about as stale as it ever
was, but IG is not the only company to have an unmaintained Web Site.

Meanwhile, it is important that there are not rumors flying back to game
store owners and, from there, game distributors that IG is closing.  The
gaming industry is somewhat cannibalistic, and if distributors thought that
IG was closing, they might decide they don\'t have to pay *their* bills to
IG.

Now, I don\'t speak for IG, but I do own stock in the company.  I think it
is important for the Company, the Authors of those items produced, and for
Marc\'s sake that we \'ride along\' a few more months before panicking.  This
is not Microsoft, and rumors can hurt companies the size of IG.  I\'m not
saying "shut up", that would be rude, I\'m asking for patience.

Oh, and Marc Miller, who is Far Future Enterprises, retains all the rights
to Traveller and licenses Imperium Games exclusively to produce the
"Authoritative Rules" for Traveller.  He also licenses IG non-exclusively
for other supplements and adventures.  Marc can (and does) license others
for non-authoritative rules (i.e.SJG) and supplements and adventures for
use with Traveller (CORE/BITS, etc.).

"This is Rumor Control, signing off".

Marc owns Traveller.  Period.  IG just had a liscense to publish it.
That\'s why SJG could get permission to do GURPS: Trav.  It\'s all Marcs.

Ha.

I say again, Ha.

I was sent to Hawaii to be part of the 25th Infantry Division (Light) just
after it had finished the conversation.  My first thought upon looking
around was that we had bravely innovated by recreating a WWI infantry
formation.  No tanks, no artillery beyond mortars, almost no support... Had
that unit fought in Korea (which was the primary reason for our existence),
we would have been slaughtered.

You\'ll note that of the four "experimental" divisions created in the early
1980s, only the 10th Infantry (Mountain) is still operating as planned, and
they even changed their mission to become a true alpine/cold weather unit.
The other three (7th and 25th ID(L) and the 9th ID (Motorized)) have either
been disbanded or converted to mechanized divisions.

It annoyed us how much power the Corporals in British-style armies had.
Culture clashes can be so much fun, don\'t you agree?

Ob Trav:  Imagine the problems during the 5FW, when Planetary defense
forces, put on active duty and shipped out, came into contact with other
PDFs, some with wildly different rank structures and procedures.

   Not only is this guy using an autoreply program which should be
**banned** from the Internet (as if such things actually work against
spammers, ha!), but he appears to be arrogant about it.  What a total
moron!!!  Somebody should contact the sysadmin of *his* site and get either

We\'re all around you, Douglas.  As an Illustrious Knight (Templar) of the

Well, to be precise, while the Mayan and Aztec calendars agree on the end
of the world date, they do so within two separate symbol systems.  The
Fifth Sun is an Aztec-only concept, while the Mayan baktun calendar--

Wait, excuse me, you don\'t care.  December 22, 2012, give or take three
weeks (owing to uncertainties in the calendar correlation).  And hence 16
years early for our good pal 1997XF11.

The game \'Shadowrun\' used this date for the re-emergence of magick into
the \'normal\' world.  One of the authors of \'Shadowrun\' runs an OTO group
in Washington, DC.  Fnord-o-rama. :)

Yes, but... 50%? Do we really have any idea of what % of the population
is "minor" human races" The "canon" talks about a number of minor races, 
but very few of them are actually detailed beyond being given a name.

It\'s my opinion that by the time the Terrans rolled onto the scene at
the end of the Empire of the Stars that that the Imperium was probably
at least 50%, if not 75%, genetically Vilani. Now, Vilani who don\'t
actually live on Vland will have cultural drift like anyone, but I think
that communication lines would have been good enough to give everyone 
an idea of what was and wasn\'t "proper Vilani".

Ok, sure. (What are we talking about again?)

Sure, but look at how bizzarely similar most modern western cultures 
are to the Romans - The US and Canada both have Senators for example.
My wife, a some-times ESL (English as a Second Language) teacher, is
fond of saying "You can\'t teach English until you understand Latin".
Things persist longer than you might imagine.

And they\'ll have lots of similarities, some subtle, some drastic.
(drastic similarity?)

Hi Colin,

Which Striker do you have?  1 = Classic Traveller, 2 = TNE.  I have both. 
A lot of the vehicle design stuff in MT came from Striker 1.  What I was
referring to was the personnel damage table in Striker 1 which, given a
weapon\'s penetrating rating and a target\'s armor rating, yielded either a
No Effect, a Light Wound, a Serious Wound, or a Death.  On this chart, any
weapon with pen >= armor can kill, but the amount of maiming is not futher
described.  I believe this system was also used for Azhanti High Lightning
though I don\'t have that game.

Striker 1 introduced the logarithmic armor scale that was used in
MegaTraveller.  I know that someone has the table in electronic form, but
I haven\'t seen it in a while.  TNE (including Striker 2) armor and pen
ratings are linear, so a conversion between the two is pretty easy.

Striker 2 also has the FFS errata that improves high energy weapons so
that they are finally more effective than GLs and RLs.  Range is tripled,
and linear penetration is more than doubled.  I applied the errata to the
Striker 1 PGMP and FGMP stats; the results are quite impressive.  I can
post them if you like.

That\'s absurd.  Now, what I do, personally speaking, is store my coffee in
titanium blocks in my sinuses.  I can fit nearly an entire liter in there
without leakage, as opposed to a measly 2-3 ccs.  I\'ve got an enormous
capacitor, too.

22nd title?  huh??? You mean in all of Traveller I presume?

and further... did Nobles ever come out?  I\'ve not seen it reviewed here,
nor have I seen it in any local game store ( not that this is unusual ). 
Will it come out?  And isnt Missions of State a little odd without Nobles??
 I was under the understanding that Missions of State was going to build on
Nobles by giving adventures for Nobles.

I\'d check the IG website..... but I think we all know what a < expletive

OTOH, I have noticed that the GT site has already put up two pages of news.
 I suspect they might even keep up their own website.

 I just pulled a \'who\' from the majordomo server for the Traveller list - he\'s
not on it.  If Mr. Emery is still getting TML mail (besides this one, I am
cc\'ing him), then someone is forwarding the list to him either directly or by a
redirected list server (i.e. check the headers of messages).

No, 22nd publication by IG in the last 18 months.  All for T4.  Includes
rule books, supplements, two magazines, and adventures.

I\'m not saying they\'re all worth buying.

I have no idea what the state of Nobles is, but I wasn\'t counting that in

either, but ask yourself how many of those who were actually owed money by
IG, (some, or even many, of us knew there was something in the wind long
quite some time ago), publicised the matter. And why we didn\'t.

I suppose what I\'m saying is that in order to give Traveller a reasonable
chance of continuing, we should keep our collective mouths clamped tightly
shut and avoid the spread of rumours. Better to continue to support the
game and hope matters improve than to contribute to its demise. All I\'m
doing here is putting my mouth where my money already is (I do mean that).

Which do we want? Do we want to be able to point fingers and say \'told you

excellent!

And you can\'t understand Latin until you\'ve finished a bottle of vino.

But on the subject of persisting,  take a look at greek mythology.  Those stories
and characters, in the broad sense, are 12,000 years old or more.  They were
ancient when the Greece was at its Golden Age, the stories of the Iliad and the
Odyssey were recorded by Homer but much older than that.  A more concrete
example: I can, and have, traced the story of Hamlet from 1600 England to the
Horus/Osiris myth, some 4500 or so years previous (at least recorded, probably
older as oral tradition). And there are still production today.  So we know (at
least I know and you can trust me) that at least one story has lasted 5000+
years.  Even *through* different cultures.  Changing some elements but remaining
the same in essence.  Remember the line in ST: The Undiscovered Country in which
MacBeth was lauded as being so much better in its original Klingon?

Its not clear to me that the background mandates which (astrogator vs pilot

When Chaosium put out their boxed Thieves\' World campaign setting, they
included CT among the systems supported, with example NPC\'s.  So, my
players and I decided, what the heck?  Straight fantasy played with CT
rules - SMG\'s versus spells.  Turned out more even than they would have liked.

That world made a repeat performance later on.  The players wanted to
return - in their Serpent-class scout ship.  They were somewhat dismayed
when they were confronted on the ground by "themsleves".  Their characters
from a previous Chivalry and Sorcery campaign (suitably converted to
Traveller) had come out to deal with the new \'dragon\' in the neighborhood.

Those of you familiar with C&S will appreciate why the planet was called
"Arden" (UPP X869577-2 R Ni).  It replaced another world of the same name
in the Spinward Marches (Vilis 0201).

I have always interpreted this as meaning that if the jump bubble is broken

crew or destroying the ship.  Which basically mean that when a crew is in
jumpspace, they are stuck there.

The 50% number is taken from the "Aliens for Traveller:  Draft Material". 
As far as I know, official, unless there is a finished version out there
that corrects this.  So yes, we _do_ really have an idea of the percentage
of the population are minor human races as of the late Third Imperium.

As a note, I\'m glad that all the minor human races aren\'t covered in
detail.  The less detail, the more freedom I have to create without having
to worry about screwing up other things accidentally.

75% genetically Vilani is not supported by any sort of canon I\'m familiar
with.  As far as communication lines, they\'re bad, that\'s one of the
founding tenants of the Traveller Universe.

Yes, and the government of the U.S. (not sure about Canada) was formed
during a classical revival, which should be kept in mind as well.  I
acknowledge that the U.S. is influenced by Roman culture.  But, again, we
got it from the British, the French, the Spanish and a little from the
Dutch.  These places were all within a relatively short distance of each
other in the grand scheme of things.  Now, we\'ve got a vast distance
(time-wise) from, say Corridor to the Solomani Rim...  Alot more of a
chance for change.

Basically, what was originally being discussed was the Vilani resistance to
change and it permeating the culture of the Third Imperium.  Basically a
handwave created to justify the slow movements in technology and research
after TL10 or so.

> And they\'ll have lots of similarities, some subtle, some drastic.
> (drastic similarity?)

I don\'t doubt this.  But, I\'m not sure that the Third Imperium (especially
the late Third Imperium) is as dominantly Vilani as is popularly believed. 
Just something rubs me the wrong way about that.  As I stated before, I\'m
not saying it would be dominantly Solomani either, I just think it would be
more or less neither with elements of both cultures thrown in for good
measure.

Especially if you throw the megacorporations in and try to properly deal
with the amount of influence they hold over the Imperium, culturally and
governmentally...

I don\'t see how it can be. If it was the 3I could never have kept its TL
lead over its neighbours. That its overall TL runs about one higher than
that of other powers is canon, so its attitude towards TL advance must have
been at least as progressive as that of the Solomani Confederation.

Under Traveller (MT, TNE, and T4) anyone who acts primarily as a
supervisor counts as command crew no matter whom they supervise. 

Thus the Chief Engineer of a ship with several enginners is command
crew, the Chief Medical Officer of a ship with a large Medical staff is
command crew, and the supervising officers (and/or senior NCO\'s) of your
ships troops count as command crew.

So if you add 24 Imperial Marines to your ship your ships comand crew
will go up by 4 people.  You now have 28 people on the ship wearing
marine uniforms. It is just that 24 count as troops and 4 as command
crew.  If you want to list the ships crew by name, rank & position this
may matter but otherwise it is just a question of "flavor".

I have no real naval knowledge, but this is not a naval matter it is a
_Traveller Ships Crew Rule_ question and that I do know.

Well known enough...it has a 10 user anon ftp limit. It took me hitting it
almost all day yesterday to get it. But, once you\'re in, it\'s definitely
worth it...I kept hitting it with Netscape and downloads were running at
50k /sec...pretty damn fast. So I got all 78 megabytes of it...folks don\'t
even _think_ of trying this at home, unless you have a cable modem or
T1...

BUT...once you get it, it is bust a gut funny!

And here\'s a required scene:
A Stormtrooper is steadily advancing on the position of of a red-shirt,
firing from the hip.  Each shot misses, of course.  Blaster fire whizzes
by the red-shirt on all sides.  Finally the Stormtrooper gets to
point-blank range... and still he misses.  Finally, the red-shirt can
take no more.  He snatches the blaster away from the Stormtrooper,
points it at his own chest, and fires!  He points to the gaping, smoking
wound in his chest and screams at the Stormtrooper, "See!  That\'s how
you\'re supposed to do it!"  Then he topples to the ground.  Notice that
all laws are obeyed: The Stormtrooper misses, but the red-shirt still

According to data on Mora subsector in \'The Spinward Marches Campaign\' p. 20:

"The Imperial Research Station at Duale (2728 Spinward Marches A5437BF-B) was
damaged by an industrial accident in 1102; refitted and refurbished in 1108, it
now pursues secret research for the Imperial Navy. "

Furthermore, the DIS Newsbriefs in MTJ #3 has an article called \'Still No Word
On Whisper\', which is about a Virushi nanobiologist who\'s disappeared from the
Research Station.

You could have found these references yourself by looking at:

   The apology was for EuroDisney.  Some things just don\'t work across

   Say what you will about the former French president, Metterand (I

No -- the ship is in a bubble of normal space within jump space.  The
jump drives keep the bubble in place, so that the ship doesn\'t
experience jump space.  If the jump drives stop running, the bubble
pops, and the ship is exposed to jump space.  Canon has it that exposure
to jump space makes humans insane and then kills them.  In my universe,
jump space\'s different laws of physics cause unpredictable changes at
the atomic level.  

Anyway, even if you did precipitate out into normal space, you would be
in the middle of deep space somewhere -- fleeing the ship in a non-jump
capable vessel would lead to death by starvation.

Likewise, even if the ship loses its jump bubble, it will keep its
vector in jump space. That\'s why the ship is said to "tumble" into jump
space -- once it\'s in, it\'s just falling on that vector and you can\'t do
anything about it.

   There were some classic Traveller adventures set in the Solomani Rim
(Nomads of Ocean World, Signal GK, etc.) which should helpful.  A lot
depends upon what era you want to run your campaign in. From your post, you
seem to be aiming for c.1116.  In that case you need to get AM6: Solomani.
It contains a sector map and notes on each subsector.  Traveller Chronicle
#10 provides updated stellar data (and subsector notes updated for the New
Era setting), though I believe the latest version of Galactic now has that.

   All of the above is probably available through Kevin Knight at Sword of
the Knight Publications (swrdknght@aol.com), though there are other game
dealers on line who could also handle your request (they get mentioned from
time to time on the mailing list).

IMTU - The jump field/bubble collapses and implodes. Contact with J-space
destroys the ship. Utterly. No survivors. A momentary collapse of field can
result in a misjump and potential J-space sickness for passengers and crew.

>Does the ship drop out to "Normal Space"?

If you allow it to you can then have jumps lasting less than the 168 hour
average, and you start to change the nature of jump/Traveller. I would say
no to dropping into N-space.

I have 4 players, new to Traveller, awaiting the T4.1 rules release. The
mess that T4 was put them off buying the initial rules release.

  That\'s not how it goes!  The Stormtroopers advance.  The redshirts fire
in volley while their officers in white periwigs tell them what to do.  The
stormtroopers are decimated and turn tail running while the Officer chases
them away...
  Then the stormtroopers realize what is happening, turn around and start
firing at the officer, of course, missing.  Officer leads them back into a
cleverly laid trap - back into the waiting fire of the redshirts.  Storm
troopers are almost destroyed to the man when the officer tells the
redshirts to cease fire.  Then the officer, remembering prime directive #1
(how many prime directives are there anyhow?) and teaches the last
surviving Stormtrooper how it should have been done.  The redshirts are
turned into two teams and fire upon each other... decimating each other to
the last man.  The Last surviving stormtrooper then says "WOW!!!!" and
joins up as a red shirt on the spot by doffing his stormtrooper\'s armor,
and donning the red shirt.  Immediately, he shoots himself in the belly
saying "It\'s sooo much more fun to be a redshirt than a Stormtrooper
marksman!  At least I finally got to hit something... <sigh>"

Well, I\'m preparing to run a CORPS campaign in my own SF world that 
borrows heavily from Traveller (kinda like Traveller meets Shadowrun) 
- - jump drives that have a set jump time (I used the parabolic 
frictionless underground tunnel analogy - and please, Mr. Kenji, 
would you refrain from any comments on that one? ;)), no FTL commo, 
psionics and large warships with no "starfighters" to speak of.

the Imperium that have not been contacted in hundreds of years, as
indicated in the back of the main rulebook?  Why?

3.  Does the Imperium encompass more worlds than are indicated in the

If someone would answer these questions for me, or point me in the

Ah! I have an extra copy of Book 2 I\'d be willing to trade - it\'s in
pristine condition, the former owner having recieved it in a boxed set
HE NEVER OPENED...(the remaining books becam much needed replacements,
alas - a well-used book shows the years much like a tree - layers of
duct-tape instead of rings...) I desire the Aslan module - I\'d also be
willing to throw in perhaps some old JTAS and/or Challenge mags, at your
discretion, of course. Contact me - we\'ll talk...also, I could use the
Vargr and Sol books, copies would be nice. Thanks for the offer! (And
thanks, Marc, for the opportunity)

Hi Bryan,

Could you tell me if iny of the members in your group would have the
data for the Old Expanses Sector. I have some data that was put out, but
I would like a complete listing if available. The TNE map on page 79 
shows little splotches that are frontier areas. The largest of course is
where RCS is centered, but there is another splotch in sub sec P, one in
Hinterworlds and one in Spica that would seem to show the  possible
route from their space towards the core. I have Hinterworlds original
data. Any leads would be appreciated.

Thanks

market, and welcome to the TML (abandon hope all who enter here :*>)

>1.  Based on the information in the T4 main rulebook, what year should
>I start my campaign in?

Well it depends on the "style" of game you want. I have two suggestions:
The early years of the Milieu (0-53) cover the initial expansion phase
the emphasis here is exploration and recontact. I\'d set a campaign in this
period in 20.
The later years of the Milieu (50-200) cover the consolidation phase. During
this period exploration and recontact are deemphasised (though still
important) and the emphasis shifts to political intrigue and "the great
game". In this era I\'d set a campaign in around 98.

>2.  Is there some reason why there are worlds only two parsecs away from
>the Imperium that have not been contacted in hundreds of years, as
>indicated in the back of the main rulebook?  Why?

The map is wrong, ignore it. Okay so that\'s probably about as useful as
a kick in the posteria. The best options are:
1) Get hold of Milieu O campaign (the hardback version). Not only does it
contain the corrected maps, it has a vast amount of useful information on
the era.
2) Download Galatic 2.3 from Jim Vassilokov\'s website. This contains the
maps of the Third Imperium in 1100. I think somebodies done a version of
the Core sector in Milieu 0 recently (general appeal to the list). Or
you could regress the 1100 data using Mike Bailey\'s TRTools.

>3.  Does the Imperium encompass more worlds than are indicated in the
>back of the rulebook (ie. in the subsectors above Core and to the left)?

Yes, a lot more. If you can get hold of Milieu O campaign (I can\'t
emphasis enough to get the Hardback version not the softcover), it
is all explained.

Not sure how common that is, but I have worked on naval systems for the Far
East whose primary purpose was piracy suppression, so I figure there are
still pirates around. The tack the client government was taking was not to
arm the merchantmen, but to put enough minor warships into the risk area
that pirates would be deterred. Of course that is much easier to do in a
small area of ocean with satnav and comms than it is in deep space...

Quite right. My own preferred explanation (non-canon warning!) is that in
a few percent of all jumps (something like 1 in 36 ;-) the jump field
develops an unpredictable flutter some time during the journey. Nothing a
competent, or even semi-competent, engineer can\'t handle, but fatal if it
isn\'t corrected. Thus automated ships (or jump torpedoes ;-) are lost
about 3% of the time, which makes them far too expensive to use regularily,
but makes it possible to use them in special circumstances (ie. when the
Referee needs it for plot purposes). Btw. I may be misremembering, but I
think the DAGGER (the kamikaze ship in the "A Dagger at Efate" adventure in
one of the early JTASs) was jumping on automatic. If that is true, then
automatic jumps are canon; but the 3% risk I propose will solve the problems
that that would present.

"Vilani & Vargr" had some rules for determining whether a character had
the Vilani gene (or gene complex) for longevity. It was expressed as a
die roll with modifications for the factors that made it more likely
that someone had the gene: Proximity to Vland, a Vilani name for the
planet, and various other factors all contributed (but even someone born
on Vland wasn\'t 100% sure of having it. If we assume that having the
longevity gene and being of Vilani racial stock has a very high correlation
and that the die roll accurately reflect the distribution of racial Vilani
(not necessarily valid assumptions, especially the last one), we could work
out some pretty accurate distribution figures. I\'d do it myself, but I have
a lot of other projects that interest me more, but the idea is hereby
presented to anyone who cares.

My suggestion for Vilani population distribution when the Terrans arrived
on the scene is this: One planet with billions of Vilani (Vland); thousands
of Vilani colony planets with populations deliberately held to level 7 and
8 (enough for a well-functioning high-tech society without crowding). Most
of these would be genetically and all would be culturally Vilani. And
about 20 minor human homeworlds with high populations, at least level 8,
some of them (but not many) level 9 (Plus a lot of minor non-human
homeworlds, of course). These would be either culturally integrated or
rigorously oppressed.

>Basically, what was originally being discussed was the Vilani resistance to
>change and it permeating the culture of the Third Imperium.

In that case the whole question about genetical Vilani distribution is moot,
because there is no reason to suppose that genetical and cultural vilaniness
is more than remotely correlated.

>Basically a handwave created to justify the slow movements in technology
>and research after TL10 or so.

Frankly, I think that explanation is inadequate, because it dosen\'t explain
why the Solomani, Zhodani and all the rest didn\'t advance any faster. IMO
either technologically advancement (by research and discovery) is normally
very difficult and the two examples of quick advancement we know of (Terra
from TL 4-8 and Darrian from TL 12-16 (their advancement from TL 3 to 12
was technological uplifiting/bootstrapping, not discovery) are freak
occurrences, or there is some sort of "wall" to technological discoveries
that kicks in around TL 9 or 10 and then only the Darrian advancement is
a freak occurrence.

Well, the interstellar culture of the starfaring part of the Imperium is
very close to 20th Century Western (by pure accident, of course ;-), but
that dosen\'t mean that many... most... planetary cultures can\'t be
different.

When you are doming cities because of a low presssure atmosphere, you
have to keep in mind one very important thing:  air pressure is acting
to push the dome up.  If you have one atmosphere inside the dome (14.7
lbs/sq. inch), the dome is being lifted with a force of 29.5 million
tons for every square mile covered.  The edges of the dome will have
to be buried deep enough so that the weight of the earth or rock or
dirt is enough to counter this.  Note that this pressure is acting
over the area covered, not the area of the dome (only the vertical
component counts).  An alternative design is a partially buried sphere.
If you build a huge geodesic sphere (or even just 2/3 of a sphere) and
bury it, then you eliminate (or reduce this problem.  You might have
surface cities of clusters of spheres connected by tubes.

My guess is that a high-population world with a thin atmosphere would
be mostly underground tunnels and caverns with domes and/or spheres
for getting a dose of "outdoors", though with holotechnology, that
wouldn\'t be necessary.  If the TL is sufficient (or even if it\'s not,
importing would make this possible) some wealthy nobles might live
in floating spheres.

Why couldn\'t an onboard computer resolve said "Flutter"?

I\'ve been reviewing the other thread about losing your jump bubble... It sure
SEEMS like the whole jump is front loaded and you have quite literally NOTHING to
do in jump space.

What I will concede is that jumping into unexplored areas MAY have gravitic
anomolies that must be resolved.  But the XBoat system jumps the same route
continuously.  It would be very well charted.

That\'s because it\'s _Sherry_ Lewis that the French think is a comedic genius.

    'body' => '     There was a time when the Traveller characters in my campaign ended up
playing Star Wars. Yes, the characters, not the players. There was this big
virtual reality arcade which annually would conjoin the four best selling
VR games from different genres into one simulation. The year they were
there there was
     Genre: Modern, Game: Bughunt on Ryleh (Aliens meets Cthulhu)
     Genre: Vaudville, Game: Pirates of Parlance (Gilbert and Sullivan)
     Genre: Fantasy, Game: Riders of the Pike (Dragonlance)
     Genre: Historical, Rebels against the Empire (Star Wars, hey, as a
romanticised vision of the Rule of Man it was historical for them!)
     Anyway, they started off in the Star Wars section of the game, having
to infiltrate an Imperial Base and blow it up (like the 3rd film). Of
course there were millions of troops. I needed a way to simulate the film
where a small group of super characters can take out whole batallions of
baddies. So I inventedt he Stormtrooper Roll.
     Anytime they came across one or more baddies and did something
unexpected ("This has nothing to do with the B3 bomber!"), marginally
plausable ("There are rebels attacking the gate!"), or confusing (intoning
mystically "You can let us through.") I gave the baddies a stormtrooper
roll. I rolled a d6 and if it came up 1 or 2 the stormtroopers would stand
there confused for a round.
     This worked tremendously well as it allowed the players to concoct
very tenuous schemes and floor loads of baddies. Of course once they were
out of Virtual Reality they had to readjust. They almost tried a similar
hokey trick on some _Imperial_ strormtroopers, but thought better of it
:-).

     The interesting bit was that it implied that particles could have a
gravitiational "charge". Positive or negative. Of course I immediately
wondered if this could form the basis of a quasi-explainable justification

Hmmm.  There was the Babylon5 session I ran at a con about 3 years ago
using the MT rules.  I also used them to run a short Space:1889

When there is a native species, I always assume that the natives are
counted in the Population number.  Perhaps there are 10 billion welsh
dandelions and four billion humans.

MT was a refinement of CT based on Digest Group\'s task system.  It took the
ten years of Traveller experience and filtered it into a fairly good third
generation RPG.  Attempts were made to make vehicle/ship design more
consistent, and the CT combat system was reworked massively.  MT remains my
favorite rule set.  This may well change when I see T4.1, since I liked
what I saw in T4, but the horrendous errata and errors put me off a bit.

T4 is an attempt to bring back the feel of CT, a goal I find laudable but
approach cautiously.  The main differences are the task syste using
multiple dice for different difficuties (a subject of great debate here on
the list), and the inclusion of Fire, Fusion & Steel style design paths for
ships, vehicles and weaponry.

We enjoyed it. Especially the missions where the major threat to
the success of the mission was argument between the members of
the team.

But then we enjoyed the planning aspect as well.

No good if the Imperial Governor uses the security system to protect
himself, the tech whiz was professional and didn\'t design in a
backdoor, and the security guard is three security guards.

Not to mention all such techniques mean _someone_ knows you\'ve
been there.

We always preferred being able to leave and not have the fact
that we were there known until at least after we were halfway
to the next star system, if then. Once we stole a chip,
replaced it with a fake, and they didn\'t discover the loss
until it was delivered to the customer\'s site some two weeks
later.

It was a major failure if anyone knew we were even in the area,
We even thought of outlawing projectile weapons during missions
but the troops got a bit antsy at that. Still, we did arrange
punishments for drawing a weapon, and if you had to actually
fire, well, that was your bonus gone, if you you were lucky
enough to still be employed.

The whole sector was covered in CT Supplement 11 : The Solomai Rim,
there are paragraphs on each subsector therein.

The Vegan\'s were covered as a featured species in a Journal or similar
publication (perhaps FASA\'s High PAssage), though I can\'t track down
the article

There is a lot of similar stuff in FASA\'s High Passage magazines,
though they mainly deal with Solomai sympathizers in the Old Expanses.

But a discrete mistress is often discreet as she would be separated from the

No, it\'s simply the primitive, mindless instincts that lower primates have.
You all breed like rats, and are genetically programmed to do so.

In fact, your comparison to rabbits is exactly on the mark -- as our
scientists are discovering, the hominid species of Terra and Vland were
used as laboratory rabbits, so to speak, by the Great Old One.  Only we
Sayat escaped modification, thanks to liberal use of sharp pointy objects
and projectiles.

I hope this email has not turned you into a hamster.  Gene therapy by email
is a tricky business.

Pretty good handwave there except that it doesn\'t explain why a competent,

    I\'ll have to hunt this down.  In the latest copy of Wired magazine,
there is an article on gravity negation/reduction.  Spin a superconductor,
and the force of gravity is reduced over it.  Tests are few, non-widely
recongnized, and the variation in gravity seen is very small.

There are a couple of listings about that I can dig up for you if you\'re
desparate.  Some are not complete and some include material that was never
published.  None have much info beyond title, publisher etc.


But what you *really* want <grin> is _The Traveller Bibliography_ which not
only lists all the products (and for MegaTraveller and TNE and T4 to the
middle of 97 as well), but gives you brief contents listings *and* comments
on each item as well.  If you\'re a collector it should give you an idea of
what it might be worth paying for something and what you want to make a
priority.  If you\'re \'just\' a Traveller fan, it contains loads of useful
information and has a really natty cover.

(Of course, I am biased Mikko, I wrote the wretched thing!)


However, it is 108 pages of jam-packed facts and fun and available from
Andy Lilly of BITS fame for a measly 8 pounds 50 and postage I believe.

I am reminded of fields I\'ve seen in Ireland and England where the rows of
crops were all under these long cylinders of plastic. Sort of extended
greenhouses. You might go for this image.

>Or do any of you have any (semi-)informed opinions about it?
Have you read "Red Mars"? I\'ve only read the intro but there were Martian
cities with domes that seem like what you are looking for. From what I\'ve
heard the books were well received and appeared to be well researched so
you might give them a go.

>I\'ve also considered making the domes able to let in heat during the day
and
>retain heat during the night. Does this sound plausible with TL 9
>technology?
Absolutely. We do this with greehouses already. You just need
double-glazing. A higher tech-materials science should make it even easier.

>Would underground cities be more plausible than
>environmental domes?
Building underground is more expensive than building above ground. So it
depends on how you view their government. In the above ground scenario, the
government is responsible for building this huge dome and then taxing its
inhabitants for the cost of maintaining it. Businesses just have to build
normal accomidations beneath it.
In the underground scenario each builder has to pay a high cost to carve
out their building and add the atmospherics. But this is much more
incremental in development.
One thing you might consider, a modern office building is pretty air-tight
anyway, with specific vents for circulating air. Advance a tech-level and
the whole thing can be fairly sealed with compressors on the air intakes.
In fact, small leaks won\'t be a problem, as the internal air-pressure will
just push the air out. You don\'t _need_ domes, but they are a romantic
concept. In this model you might have the "street level" underground. Ie.
to walk between buildings you walk along the roads which are all
underground. Or else the "bottom floor" of each building is, by government
requirement, a "public accessway" and they must connect up with
neighbouring buildings for access.

>What would make people settle a world where they can\'t breathe freely
Like Los Angeles? :-)

>Something enabling 28 billion sophonts to
>make a comfortable living?
People generate their own reason for existing. In generally I assumed that
Space Trade is only a minor factor and that most worlds can be considered
closed trading communities. It is like, what enables 5 billion sophonts to
make a comfortable living on Earth? We are our own market. You don\'t need
some overriding import/export commodity to drive your economy.

>Or did the Junidan humans just have a
>radically different attitude to birth control than most other space age
>humans?
You don\'t need that high a birth rate to achieve that size. Say 1 million
people settled there. If they doubled their population every 50 years
that\'s only 800 years to get to 28 billion. Large populations tend to
snowball, anyway. They are such a big market that it is generally more cost
effective for companies to set up there, as the market is already there.
The market grows, more come, the more people the more economy and revenue
generated through taxes. High populations will make sense to most
governments.

It the PE analysis I did of the Imperium, Junidy was in the top 12 worlds
in the Imperium. It really is that big. I\'d have to run the numbers again
but I reckon it is 10-15% of the market in the Spinward Marches (adjusted
for exchange rate). Try running the TCS formula on it to see their revenue.
With that as a local tax base, you can have great monumental public works,
like your domed city. Don\'t limit yourself too much to tech-9 for
governmental works. they can afford to import a lot.

Try http://members.aol.com/farfuture/Traveller.html which is pretty much
complete.

The only exhaustive reference for Traveller that I know is Tim Collinson\'s
"A Traveller Bibliography" published by BITS/CORE.

And \'discrete\' is *English* not American.... ;-)

eg
color - colour

US to the UK release. That\'s why it takes 3 months ;-) )

Interesting question (possibly) for Loren/Marc. Did you ever try for a
trademark in the UK, and if so did you have any problems with \'Traveller\'
as it is the normal usage of the word in the UK?

One of my friends ran a Star Wars game where the players (rebels) ended up
impounded at Alderbran (Spelling!) just as the sun was eclipsed by a rogue
moon...

They escaped and ended up on the \'moon\' in the interogation cells,
following a brief visit by a certain Lord Vader, and escaped after a
firefight happened in the cells around them.

They managed to sneak around the station for a bit, and then escaped on a
shuttle called the Tydderium as the \'moon\' entered the Yavin system.

The shuttle was then intercepted and captured by rebel fighters...

Just thought that I\'d share that one - worked well because the players put
2 and 2 together.

Travellers\' Digest 14 (or 15, I can never remember) had a bit about the
uniforms of the Terran Occupation Force.  You can use that as a guide if
you wish.

I\'ve done my own design, which I\'m going to have made as soon as my tax
refund shows up.

The jacket is based on a Confederate Cavalry officer\'s coat, which is high
collared and hangs to the mid-thighs.  The buttons are hidden, except for
one at the level of the top of the sternum.  The jacket is black.  Shoulder
loops hold maroon rank boards.  On the collars, maroon patches have a
branch of service insignia (left) and Regiment number (right).  A wide
leather belt supports the officer\'s cutlass.  Decorations are worn on the
left chest, at a level with the single button.  Marines wear their medals
only.  Campaign ribbons are left in the records, Marines fight, there is no
need to brag about it!  Despite their tradition of disdaining the wearing
of drop wings, they are mandatory for the dress uniform.  The wings are
worn above all other decorations and qualification badges, such as assault
pilot, etc,.

Headgear is a maroon beret.  Officers on shipboard duty wear a flash with
the ship\'s crest.  All others have a black flash with a gold sunburst.
(Exception: Members of the Marine Guard wear the Emperor\'s family crest, to
show their devotion to the man, rather than the office.)

Trousers are white, with a maroon strip running down the outside seam of
each leg.  The trousers are bloused into a pair of calf-high boots, which
are highly shined.

The effect is a simple, streamlined look.  The Navy wears much the same,
but their rank boards and such are yellow, and they wear far more
decorations and badges.  A Marine Officer in a room full of Navy types
looks like a hawk among peacocks, which is the idea.

If you can find it, look for a catalog called Alteryears, which is a great
source of patterns for vintage clothing.  Also, look around for a custom
embroidery shop.  You can get the patches and flashes pretty cheaply.  For
medals, I suggest a trip to a surplus store.  Be careful what you wear!
You might run into someone who is entitled to what you are calling a MCUF
who will take exception to your use of it.  I suggest medal from countries
that no longer exist.  I have a couple of WWII Italian civilian medals that
are impressive as hell, and I don\'t think anyone will mind my declaring
myself a recipient of an award for Excellence in Supervising Rail
Operations.  (I\'m serious.  I also have an award congratulating me on
bearing five live children for the Reich.)

Good luck, and when you get your costume done, post it to a web page so we
can see!

Challenge 47, I think you mean.. I\'ll have to look, but I\'m pretty sure I

T4.1 is the revision being worked on as we speak by Marc.  It will address
many of the problems we saw in the rushed effort that was T4.  Everyone on
the list has told Marc to take his time and get it right.

Every now and then, he sends out sections of the rules for commentary.  So
far, I really like what I see.

Supplement 10.  11 was Library Data N-Z.  Sup10 does little more than give
the astrographic data, with short essays on the Solomani government and the
history of the region.

JTAS 15 had an article on Azun, a HiPop world.  Double Adventure 3, Argon
Gambit/Death Station, is set in the SR.  Argon Gambit is a political
thriller.  DGP\'s Solomani & Aslan gave extensive information about the
Solomani Confederation, Earth, and a bit about the Vegans. It also gives
complete data for the Solomani Rim sector.  Travellers\' Digest 14 or 15
gave extensive coverage to Earth.

I just checked my collection, and I can\'t find it either.  I do seem to
remember it being in JTAS, but it could have been Challenge.

No good if the Imperial Governor uses the security system to protect

backdoor, and the security guard is three security guards.

The governor\'s security system was invented/installed/monitored by someone
else - if the governor is your target, this "someone else" is the key.
So what if the tech whiz didn\'t install a back door? He\'s still the best person
to tell you what the security system can do, or tell you who *can* get you
through it - if the proper persuasion is applied.
And if there are three security guards, that just means a bigger bribe - 
or a rethink of the plan to get to the guy in charge of the three security guards.

No...these techniques mean that _someone_ (who can\'t say anything about it
without implicating themselves) knows _someone_ has been there. You 
don\'t think we were pulling these stunts with our real names and faces, 
do you? :)


I agree wholeheartedly that there are some setups you can only crack with
the professional B&E gear. Even when you are pulling the scams I was
talking about, it\'s often just to get enough information to use the B&E gear
properly - a copy of the head scientist\'s voiceprint to open the lock, once
we sneak into the research station to use it, for example. I would say that 
without pulling the secret-agent scam-artist routine, there are many bases
that the best B&E would be worthless against.

There\'s quite a bit of the scam routine that you can pull without anyone 
knowing anyone was there. A security guard "dies of the measles" (is killed
in a manner that appears to be accidental) after you\'ve interrogated him.
A skilled disguise artist impersonates a clerk in a busy office, lifting the
critical code while the real clerk is taking a very long potty break (brought
on by your team medic slipping a potion into the guy\'s tea an hour ago during
lunch break). 

The way you\'re describing your team, Frank, I get the idea your employers
have already done this secret agent "leg work" for you - they found out
the who, what, and where and brought in your team (which sounds very, very
good at the B&E stuff) to do what you do best. Our group didn\'t mind being
cat burglars, but we liked being secret agents better.  :)

It really breaks down into two theories:
A) all calculations and energy expenditures are done before jump. This
presumes a jump tunnel is formed and all you do is fall through it.  This is
pretty much how a jump projector would work.
B) calculations and energy expenditure is done en route.  This opens some
undesirable possibilities.  First, you can\'t use drop tanks (you could but
you\'d carry them through jumpspace). Second, jump times could be reduced by
planning a route to a jump 6, then dropping into N-space midway (which is
definitely a no no).

An important note is that xboat message torps wouldn\'t affect the Traveller
universe much at all (except having a cheaper/moderately faster
communication).  Your typical gaming group still needs a maneuver capable
vehicle and generally doesn\'t jump the same route 50 times a year. Merchants
need to be on board to watch cargo. Liners are still needed for moving people.

This could be modified into an emergency beacon/life boat.  My original design
could fit into a standardized 54kl cargo container. But you still need an
astrogator to do the programming and you need somebody to receive the message
at the other side.  At 4-5 Mcr per computer, they\'re the most expensive
components. That makes the jump torp a rather expensive distress beacon.

Surely not one of the top twelve of the Imperium.  I\'d accept that it\'s that
big in the Domain of Deneb; it\'s one of the two most populous worlds in the
Marches (accompanied by Rethe/Regina, which is tech-8), circa 1120.  But
there\'s some very powerful worlds in Deneb, which are bigger in population
and technology level, with environments similar to Junidy.  Pikha/Zeng, for
example.

However, your point still stands; Junidy is a *major* world in the region,
and tech-9 is capable of some quite impressive things, given Junidy\'s 
resources.

   Which is why I recommended AM 6: Solomani.  It contains all of the

   Make that extensive information about the Solomani Confederation, a bit
about Earth, and a picture of a Vegan about to get thrashed by the police
during a protest.

>Travellers\' Digest 14 or 15 gave extensive coverage to Earth.

   IIRC, it was TD 13, and the bit about the polar caps melting should be
cheerfully ignored, as should the bit about the Great Pyramids getting drown
(there\'s science-fiction and then there is fantasy...).  Most everything
else is quite good.

You have just asked the fatal question - why do they have people do
ANYTHING in Traveller, once TL hits a certain point.  Robots and computers
are getting very cheap, very fast, so either you find a handwave to say
that we will hit a wall stopping this process, or you have a lot of useless
people running around.

I came up with the following noncanonical handwaves for star crew.

Normal space travel uses thruster plates that are very, very sensitive to
gas density, radiation, and other goodies.  A navigator can detect (using
sensors) such conditions, and then can plot a course that avoids them.  If
a world has a strong Scout presence, then they can make maps and course
tapes that will get you to a jump point, so you do not need a navigator, as
long as the tapes are accurate.


In Jump, similar conditions apply.  The flutter is not caused by any
initial conditions, rather, it is caused by something going on in
jumpspace.  Since no instrument has yet been created that can survive going
outside a jump bubble, and no ship has been created that survives sticking
any substantial part of itself outside, little is known about the nature of
jump space.  (I personally prefer small turtles carrying all ships on their
back, but i have been known to be fey.)

The pilot is responsible for following said plans.  In general, this is a
task taken over by a machine fairly early, which makes the pilot useful
more for intuition than anything else, much like a navigator.  As long as
the situation is perfectly normal and follows plans, a machine does it
better than a human, while if it deviates, the machine\'s recovery
algorithms can react faster, if not necessarily as well, as a human.

The engineer is responsible for making the drive systems produce the
outputs needed by the pilot to follow either the realspace or jumpspace
course plots.  This is a full time job if the navigator is not good, the
sensor data is flawed, or the pilot does not follow the nav plan as requested.

One of the Big Secrets of my campaign is that Psionic technology forms the
basis of TL 19+ culture, and that this technology can be automated at that
tech level.  Jumpspace is a phenomenon that makes sense once you hit TL 20
or so, primarily because it is Psionic in nature.  Ships with good pilots,
engineers, and navigators suffer substantially lower rates of failure than
those without, even if they do nothing but sit on their thumbs for the
entire voyage.  This is one reason why space crew are superstitious.

Psionic, in this context, means a phenomenon that comes from the same root
cause as consciousness.  I am using the Penrose model for cognition in my
world, which says an extremely complex expert system can mimic intelligence
quite well, but it will not be intelligent.  Read "The Emperor\'s New Mind"
for his definitions of what intelligence is in that case, and take it with
a grain of salt.

Anyhow, it takes until TL 17 or so before technology arises which can
create intelligence in that sense, another tech level to figure out the
Psionic technologies needed to induce it in otherwise non Psionic people,
and one more after that to start getting Psionic machinery.  Once one has
all three, ships are usually entirely automatic, since the Psionic machines
have all the advantages for star crew.

Below that point, figure that the navigator is frantically calling up data
from the sensors, reducing it, and making decisions about the conditions.
The pilot is using that input to decide how to best configure the jump
bubble, and the engineer is fiddling with it to make it math the pilot\'s
desires.

MT canon had it so.  I changed that.

There is an awful lot of space, and even slight errors can result in a
different enough course to matter.  Of course, I figure that the Scouts
need to do surveys on a monthly basis at least to keep the charts up to
date for the merchants, while military charts that are more than a year old
are not nearly as helpful.  This keeps the Scouts plenty busy.

So the math/physics/eng. departments at American universities teach classes
in discreet analysis?  I KNEW the CIA was still active on campuses, but
this is far worse than I\'d imagined!

No offense to the excellent TC article, but I know I saw a Contact! type

        MegaTraveller shook up the universe by revealing the Rebellion
and its
upheaval. The MegaTraveller rules set was published between 1988 and
1991.
        In 1991, Game Designers Workshop undertook a revision to
emphasize mercenary
aspects of the universe. Traveller New Era, which appeared between 1992
and
1995.

GENIUS!  I\'m going to use this in regular play!  (My players are move brave

I\'ve got it and read most of it.  Haven\'t actually used it, as much as I\'d
like to.

Is anyone running any PE-PBEM?  I think PE really lends itself to PBEM.
It might be great fun.  Especially as a multiplayer.  Heck, we could have
a TML-PE-PBEM game.  Would need a referee, but the drama would be players
competing for control of the same space.  And I\'d have an excuse to use
Imperial Squadrons!  This would be great.  If I get some time, I\'d be
willing to help run such a fest, I\'ve got some free webspace.  But I\'d
love to be a player.

Uh, I\'ve never seen this. Where was this published? (The thing with 
canon is, it sucks if you don\'t have a copy of everything... down with 
canon)

bad != non-existant. I always imagined the communications lines to
be reasonably reliable, especially on major trade routes, merely slow.
Even before the advent of the X-boat network, there must have been
mail runs. It only takes one enterprising entertainment company to start
selling movies off-planet before you have culture being externally
influenced. _Slow_ influence, sure.

I don\'t see a big difference - at the time the US was settled, it took a
_long_ time to get from Europe to the US. You don\'t need to go to Rome,
study Rome or even have _heard_ of Rome to have been influenced by
Roman culture. Such is Rome\'s insidious influence. Such will be Vland\'s.

The three biggest megacorporations are (surprise!) Vilani. They have
their roots in the Vilani "big three" at any rate. Other megacorps
would follow the patterns set by these three (there is a fairly limited
amount of innovation in the business world, IMO). If anything, the
megacorps would be responsible for keeping silly old Vilani traditions
rather than breaking them down.

John,

I would be interested in those world write-ups. Do you have them digitally?
or just hand-written notes?

Since I don\'t need the maps and such, would anyone be willing to scan or
type up the write-ups from A6 and send them to me? Can we do this Marc?

I hate to keep asking Marc for these permissions, I guess it would be easier
if CT was rereleased (maybe on CD or on the Web) It would be nice to access
the information. That\'s all I really want. I don\'t care to make money or
collect anything... I would just like to play Traveller.

the alien modules, as the Darrian one has some. But do any of the others? I

Ah, but the Sayat perhaps _don\'t_ use jump drive, as the Imperium knows
them.  Perhaps there\'s hungry byakhee trapped in their mysterious FTL
drives, trying to get out to get at the turtles.  That would explain why
Sayat starships use kitty litter and sunflower seeds for "jump ballast"
instead of LHyd.  Eh?  Put _that_ in your PMPP and smoke it.

It\'s beginning to worry me that the Ancient TL seems /still/ to be

and two weeks ago on the list it was 30. And now it\'s jumped to 35!

I have one question about the hardcover:  is the population digit of 5 for
Vland correct?  Is my memory failing me?

If it is 5, does anybody know what happened to all those poor Vilani?

I have to agree that overall, M0:Campaign is a good supplement.  I
especially like the legal extensions to the UWP.

I may have wandered into this thread a bit late, but am I to understand
that Marc is sitting on a virtual treasure trove of out-of-print Traveller
stuff, and it is for sale?  Just thought I\'d ask before people start

> Or a vampire ship from TNE?

	exactly - the idea of a vampire to build a small jump drive and
	to install it into a Rampart instead of a crewstation was the
	predecessor of the Roach Class of jump torpedos in Rurevayn. As
	the Cadmus-Z92 had escord of 6 Roaches, usual for a liner, when
	they delivered the CABAL* project, the Regency started to think
	about smaller X-Boats and invented the JumpBoat. Of course without
	a vampire on board a j-torpedo does\'nt make sense, so their
	j-boats are still over 40dt.

> An important note is that xboat message torps wouldn\'t affect the Traveller

> communication).

	A JT system would\'nt speed up communication it would slow them down.
	Why is a quarter of the cargo table information? Because XBoats
	are to small! They\'ve been designed during Antebellum when the
	3I was smaller and only TL:D. TL:F needs much more trade to sustain,
	and therefore much more information. In 1100 the XBoat system
	was stressed to its extends. Only after collapse smaller XBoat
	replacements became economic in the small scale of the Regency.

	And vampires dont need meat on board ! But they need maintenance.
	1/3 of the jump drive is HPG and while HPG is fine for short weapon
	pulses using it a full week at maximum rate of fire will need a
	good engineer as HPG is quite mechanic by definition.

	The 6x3x3 container is a nice idea, I\'ve placed it into a turret.

	The vilani had to face other human races. e.g. the Lancian

	this reminds me about "Kampf um Troja" a german skirmish wargame
	with the distinction between heroes and warriors. As known the
	battles of Troja started with a woman, being fight by heroes
	and solved by a horse. One of the main ideas of the rules was
	to reflect "historical" code of war. The troops group behind
	their heroes badmouthing the other side, until the heroes start
	to fight. The side with the winning hero is then charging the
	loser, who has to flee or to stand but will allways lose because
	of morality. Even if the plot (who\'s\'fighting whom, and who\'ll
	win) was known beforhands, the troops had their importance as
	the final battle inside Troja had to be done by them. Morality
	was the most important factor as both sides had similar armaments.
	Therefore the importance of badmouthing before fight.

I recall that we said somewhere that Imperial Marine full dress was maroon. I
know that parade Battle Dress (used in the game sense, not the British
military sense) is maroon.

>The problem is, the formulas for stutterwarp given in FF&S 1 seem to be
broken (the 
>drive is too fast). Does anyone have the formulas of 2300AD\'s Director\'s
Guide at hand 
>(or whereever they were given in 2300AD)?

A reading from Traveller:2300 Referee\'s Manual, p. 21:

"As the stutterwarp drive is used, it builds up an energy contamination
that stalls the drive when it reaches a threshold level.  Energy
contamination is reversed by discharging it in a gravity well.  If the
discharge is not made before the ship has travelled its range value in
light years, the ship will be completely irradiated and the crew killed.
"The discharge must take place in a significant gravity well.  Getting into
the inner system of a star is sufficient.  The entire process takes
approximately 40 hours, during which time the drive can still be used (for
in-system travel)....

"In deep space, the warp efficiency is equal to light-years per day.... In
the inner system of a star where the gravity becomes greater than a few
thousandths of a G, the efficiency of the stutterwarp drops off enormously
(by a factor of approximately 10,000).... Finally, when gravitation reaches
some tenths of a G, the effficiency of the stutterwarp drops off once
again, down to the point where the stutterwarp cannot overcome the
gravitation and some other means of propulsion will be required."

and p. 22:

"Stutterwarp efficiency is equal to the cube root of (megawattage of the
ship power plant / mass of the ship in tons) multiplied by a constant.  In
most cases, this constant is 14.25, but varies slightly with the technology
used to build the stutter drive."

In the ship listings on pp. 28-35, efficiency varies from 2.076 to 4.068,
while range is always 7.7ly.

In essence, the data given in FF&S 1 *is* from Traveller:2300.

  _Of course_ it is - true AI robots are even cheaper than

  Actually, pinching off pocket universes is "closer to TL 35"
than TL 25 (A:12, p.41). And that was shortly after the Final

  And about this PMPP-envy thing. Sure, it\'s a funky little center-

  You realize that, if wearing a CES to protect against backblast or
exhaust gasses, a K\'kree could carry an underslung recoilless or even

  And that nighmarish vision should be enough to give even the most

I believe you\'ll need at least a flight computer built into the Emergency jump
berth.  If the jump drive can be plugged into the ships purified fuel tank, all you
have to do is shut off the gravitics (which will misalign the jump), draw jump fuel
from the gig and jump right out of the turret. The jump flash may even look like a
weapon (eerie!). You\'ll also need power to keep life support functional (one week),
maybe a larger HPG built into the drive or a battery and a deployable solar array
once the jump is complete.  Then an automated comm system would send out a distress
call.

He (and Frank and I) took what he wanted from the reserve room in the
warehouse (the room where we stored a small reserve of everything we printed)
before it got split among Zochhi\'s and Crazy Egor. What was left of the rest
of the warehouse went to Chessex and Zochhi and Berkeley -- as much as they
would take (which, as it happens, was all the TNE stuff and Twilight stuff all
of the miniatures rules). The rest either went to a remaindering house (where
it probably ended up on the shelves at Dollar Bill\'s) or to the local paper
stock salvage place (and is presumably insulation or something by now). Oh --
and the bunch of stuff the local hobby store owner -- and any local gamer who
happened by. We even gave some stuff to the UPS driver, and anybody else who
came by and seemed interested. And the landfill...

Gawd, I hated that. The worst part was walking through the warehouse in the
last week or so, listening to my footsteps on the concrete floor echoing off
the walls of the empty rooms...

Hmmm. Sorry. Got rather carried away there.

The piracy which governments in and around the South China Sea are worried
about is essentially seaborne mugging - board the ship, nick the payroll
and anything small and valuable and maybe kidnap the captain for ransom.

It doesnt involve stealing the ship and/or cargo for sale elsewhere (that
you do via switching the paperwork in Singapore).

Secondly, it\'s easier track shipping with TL10 and up sensors in and around
the 100 diameter limit of a world than it is to do with ship-based radars
in the South China Sea and Straits of Malacca.

The reluctance of governments to have heavily armed civilians around is
also Traveller - look at the proposed systems of Imperial Permits for
particle accelerators and lasers bigger than 250 MJ, for example, and the
banning of nukes in private hands.

Last year, I played in a PE by email game. It was huge fun, but it
essentially fell over because it is a huuuge amount of work to GM.

At minimum, you will need spreadsheets to calculate GWP, expenditures and
so on.

I would also recommend using worlds with comparable sized economies -
population dominates in PE, and a Pop A world has 100 times as many people,
and thus 100 times as big an economy, as a pop 8 world.

If players are at all militarily inclined, I would also knock up a better
military system - the one in PE works, but it is more abstract than I like.

You may also consider having the players collectivly run one empire with a
couple of NPC neighbours.

Mac or PC?

If you have a Mac, or access to one, you can get every published career,
plus many home-brew ones, as part of my MegaCharacters HyperCard stack.
(Well, many of these are MT careers, but the changes are minimal - mainly
the addition of skill clusters.)

MegaCharacters also generates names, physical appearance, personality, and
motivations for all characters, making it very useful for generating
\'rounded\' NPCs.

Well, if he\'s not, I\'m going to find out fairly soon.

This list is what Marc posts periodically.  I would suggest a politley phrased
letter asking about the specific items you are interested in.  He will then
check to see what he actually has on hand and email you that list with prices,
at least that is what he did for me.  You then print that email out, right out
check, send both, then wait in anticipation until the goodies arrive.

Contact! Llellewyloly
The Llellewyloly of Junidy

The Llellewyloly (LEL-uh-wi-Low-lee) are a non-humanoid minor race,
originating on the planet Junidy (3202  B-434ABD-9) in the Spinward Marches.
They are known throughout the Imperium for their fancied resemblance to a
Terran weed, the Dandelion.  Little else is known about them outside the
Domain of Deneb because Llellewyloly do not travel extensively.  There has
been renewed interest since the Rebellion, however, due to the occupation of
Junidy by invading Vargr in 1116.

Background

Junidy occupies the fourth orbit around June, an early F7-V star.  June\'s
companion star, July, orbits June at 19.6 AU (Orbit 8), and is an old red
dwarf star (M9-D) with a long term irregularity in luminosity.  The current
cycle of irregularity caused a decrease in the hydrosphere of Junidy, which
led to the rise of land animals, and eventually, the Llellewyloly.

As July moved into the cooler portion of its cycle, Junidy\'s mean temperature
dropped, bringing on an ice age.  As the polar caps expanded and the sea level
dropped, many marine forms were forced to adapt to shallow water or land.  The
mobile forms were first, eventually leading to a large proportion of the
ecological niches on land being filled by bilaterally symmetrical, furred
animals.  The radially symmetrical animals (most of them five-limbed) were
last, having been only semi- to non-mobile as marine forms.

Most of the radials were Trappers or Pouncers, and were equipped with poison.
Because of this advantage, the radials survived.  Several developed greater
mobility and actually hunted, developing insulating fur from their protective
spines.  The most successful of these mobile hunters were the proto-
Llellewyloly, who hunted by waiting for prey to come close to the standing,
immobile hunter, then whipping out with a tentacle and strangling or crushing
the prey.

The crude heat sensing ability of the radials developed further in the
Llellewyloly as an analog of vision, and during the peak of the ice age,
became true vision.  The increasing scarcity of game during this period caused
the final push to intelligence and an omnivorous diet.  Most of the other
radial forms died out during the later stages of the ice age, leaving the land
dominated by four- and six-legged furred animals.  On land, only the
Llellewyloly and a few animals retain the five-limbed, radially symmetrical
form.

Society

Cooperation between Llellewyloly arose during the ice age, as increasing prey
size led to the inability of an individual to hunt effectively.  This led to a
tribal structure, where those most skilled in a given task, such as hunting or
later, foraging, performed that task for the good of the tribe.  If an
individual was of inferior skill in some area, then he would be under
supervision.  As there were a number of necessary survival skills, and no
individual could master them all, specialization was the norm. 

As their culture and intelligence developed, the earlier specialized
cooperation grew into a complex social structure.  A skillful hunter, forager,
farmer, or warrior gained respect, and was defered to in his area of
expertise, but might be ignored if not skilled in the task at hand.  This
attitude remained dominant with the rise of civilization, and spread to all
areas of expertise.

As the volume of knowledge expanded, so did the social system regarding
expertise.  Formal titles came into usage, and ignoring these titles was as
bad as giving advice outside ones own fields of expertise.  As education
improved, individuals could and did become experts, and therefore titled, in
more than one area.  This led to social confusion, as addressing a stranger
incorrectly could bring execution, despite the relative standings of the two
involved.  From this the modern system evolved.

A Llellewyloly who is improperly greeted will usually "go to flower," that is,
stand on one leg and draw the other four into akimbo.  A Llellewyloly can
remain in this position for a very long time, as it comes from their prefered
hunting technique.  This social response is not reserved for humans, as it
grew out of the violence response mentioned above.  It is a Llellewyloly\'s way
of ignoring an annoying person in a very obvious fashion.  Llellewyloly also
sleep and think in this position, so having a "flowered" Llellewyloly ignore
you is a rather common occurence.

When Llellewyloly meet for the first time, they will exchange names and
Titles.  Once this has been done, forgetting to use the correct Titles and
forms of address will result in the insulted Llellewyloly "going to flower."
This is the Llellewyloly equivalent of a pout.  Only long, formal apologies of
great length, or news of great import will get a "flowered" Llellewyloly to
emerge from his pout.

When the offender is Human, responses vary with individual Llellewyloly.  All
Llellewyloly have a tolerance level with regards to humans, and once that
level is passed, the Llellewyloly will "go to flower," and not stir until the
offensive Human goes away.  Some few Llellewyloly go to flower at the first
hint of human attention, but most will give a human a minute or two grace
period.  This is not always sufficient, as most humans have trouble
distinguishing individual Llellewyloly.

The humans of Junidy have learned to duplicate the pout reaction for occasions
when a Llellewyloly forgets a human title.  Because Llellewyloly vision is not
acute, the humans of Junidy use sound to indicate annoyance:  they whistle.
Llellewyloly find human attempts to whistle abominable, and society on Junidy
has adjusted to this human parallel to "going to flower."

Physiology

The Llellewyloly are a five-limbed, radially symetrical race evolved from
marine creatures analogous to Terran starfish or anenomes.  When standing
still, Llellewyloly are between two and three meters tall.

Having adapted to life on land, Llellewyloly walk on their limbs, which double
as arms when needed.  Llellewyloly are ungainly walkers at best, looking to a
human observer like a large arthritic spider.  The number of limbs a
Llellewyloly uses to walk depends on the weight he is carrying.  The more
weight carried, the more limbs used as legs.  Each limb is about two meters
long and has two elbows/knees in addition to the hip/shoulder and wrist/ankle
joints.  At the wrist, each limb splits into three smaller "tentacles," which
are also jointed twice in opposite directions.  The first joint of the limbs
and fingers bends in towards the center.  The second joints bends outward.
The fingers also have a segment about 6 cm long beyond the bones which serve
as fine manipulators.  The shoulder joint has enough freedom to allow about
180 of rotation.  The outer elbow also has some rotational freedom, allowing
fingers from different limbs to just touch across the top of the body.

Llellewyloly skin and body fur come in a wide variety of colors, with skin
ranging from blue-grey through grey and pink into deep red.  Fur is either
white, black, or both.  No Llellewyloly has ever had yellow fur as a natural
color, though some have been known to dye their fur to imitate blond humans.

The body of the Llellewyloly is about 60 centimeters across and is
approximately round.  Unlike the limbs, the body is covered with thick fur,
which insulates it from the extemely cold nights.  The fur exudes an oily
substance which aids in insulation and serves to keep predators larger than
the Llellewyloly away.  The poison glands of the original marine animal
developed to this form as the proto-Llellewyloly became mobile hunters on
land.  The oil causes an allergic reaction in all native lifeforms and in
about 10% of Solomani-descended humans.  Native animals suffer an immediate
burning skin reaction, giving even a lone Llellewyloly significant protection
in the wilds of Junidy.  The allergic reaction in humans is very similar to
that of Poison Oak or Ivy:  a red, irritating rash in areas of direct contact
with the oil, which is spreadable by scratching.  The reaction, assuming no
further contact, abates in about a week.  About 1% of Vilani or Zhodani are
affected, and Vargr are normally immune for the same reason that Poison Oak
doesn\'t bother Terran canines: their fur.  If Vargr attempt to bite or closely
handle a Llellewyloly, their chances of being affected are one-in-ten.

Most of the major bodily functions of the Dandies are in the body, including
hearing, speech, smell, digestion, reproduction, and the brain.  Vision is
divided between the limbs.  The skin of the Llellewyloly is much more
sensitive to heat variations than human skin.  This sensitivity approximates
crude infrared vision, with a range of about ten meters, depending on the heat
source.

As an aid in catching prey in the oceans, the skin at the junction of the
fingers of the proto-Llellewyloly was light-sensitive.  Once they moved onto
land, this gradually developed into true vision, though the distance at which
a Llellewyloly can focus one set of eyes is about one meter.  Using the eyes
from two or more limbs allows focus out to about six meters, which is almost
human norm.  Thus Llellewyloly are near-sighted by human standards.  This
handicap does not extend to the detection of motion.  Llellewyloly can sense
motion much better than most humans, and to a greater degree of accuracy.
Using only the set of eyes in one limb, a Llellewyloly can pluck a thrown coin
(or flying prey) from the air.

Speech, hearing and breathing share a set of five orifices set between the
bases of the limbs, with the arrangement similar to the human throat and
mouth.  Each orifice uses its own set of "lungs" as well.  Because of this
arrangement, a skilled Llellewyloly performer can sing a four-part harmony and
still listen to the audience.  Because their lungs and speech organs developed
in a near vacuum, Llellewyloly are capable of deafeningly loud whistles in a
human-normal atmosphere.  The complexities of human languages prevent them
from yelling much louder than a human when using Galanglic or Vilani.

Llellewyloly, having evolved in a Very Thin atmosphere, have trouble breathing
in Standard and Dense atmospheres.  They suffer from over-oxygenation, and can
literally cook themselves alive because of an overload of oxygen.  They are
capable of breathing Thin atmospheres, and can aclimatize to Standard
atmospheres with the "Low Oxygen" taint, but Llellewyloly cannot exist in a
Dense atmosphere without mechanical aid.  A filter system for Llellewyloly
costs five times normal, as it must cover all five orifices.

Faced with this problem, the humans of Junidy began a selective breeding
program among the Llellewyloly in 672.  Their goal was to produce a strain of
Dandie that could more readily handle high concentrations of oxygen.
Solomani-trained genegineers were brought to the project in 721, and by 750
announced limited success.  A racial equality crisis in 764 undid most of the
project, however, as the city-bred Llellewyloly fled back into the wilds in
protest.  When the crisis was resolved in 765, very few of the city-bred
returned and nearly all had bred with the rural populations, spreading their
high pressure tolerance to most of the next generation at the cost of diluting
it\'s occurence. Currently, some 1.5% of all Llellewyloly are capable of short-
term (several hours) exposure to Standard atmospheres (or to Dense atmospheres
with a Low Oxygen taint) before oxygen overload sets in.

An opening at the base of the body serves for both feeding and waste disposal.
The sense of smell is concentrated in five short fronds hanging around the
mouth, which contact food and detect airborne odors.  The Llellewyloly have no
independent taste sense, depending on their sense of smell entirely.  As
compensation for this, the stomach lining is very sensitive to irregular
foodstuffs, making this race one of the most finicky in its eating habits.
The Llellewyloly are discrete about waste disposal, having found human
household plumbing to be one our most useful inventions.

Reproduction

All individual Llellewyloly are bisexual, and can function in both male and
female roles simultaneously.  The original water-borne reproduction system has
not truly adapted to land, so Llellewyloly communities always have water
nearby.  The young develop in a ring of pouches around the mouth, then later
crawl into their parents\' fur.  Because of their fine sense of balance, no
parent can ignore or forget its children, who are ready for solid food as soon
as they emerge from their pouches.  "Toilet-training" young Llellewyloly is a
tedious job, and adults with dignified professions will often pass their
children on to some more tolerant and less important adult.  A newly conceived
Llellewyloly spends three standard months in its pouch, and about a standard
year in the fur of its parent, after which it can walk and feed itself on the
ground, and is too heavy to carry.  Adult size is attained in five standard
years.

Llellewyloly have no institution of marriage as such, but do engage in
protracted courting routines for many of the same reasons as humans.
Potential parental partners go through lengthy self-inflicted compatibility
tests before actual reproduction, and many find the process so humiliating
that they effectively pair for life, but this is not universal by any means.
Multiple "marriages" and "orgy groups" are not uncommon (and became more
popular after the Dandies learned about Hiver "Ambassadors" and the reasoning
behind them).

While many Dandies have a "biological clock" which affects their urge to
reproduce, and most Dandies attach a fair amount of emotion to reproduction,
the act itself lacks the physical aspects common to mammalian reproduction.
Touching is optional, in fact, so long as the parents-to-be share a pool. 

Playing the Llellewyloly

The native culture of the Llellewyloly has created a race of strong orators
and good listeners.  In his area of expertise a Dandie can talk
authoritatively for hours.  Similarly, a Dandie who needs to listen will do so
for as long as needed.  The humans who settled Junidy quickly discovered that
Dandies could absorb information with astonishing accuracy and make use of
that information just as quickly.  Early attempts at a human-run government
failed due to the fact that the Llellewyloly were absorbing technological
information so quickly that they couldn\'t be kept out of things.

In some ways, getting to know a Dandie is like getting to know a Vargr.  If he
has been informed of your "Titles", a Dandie will treat you with respect in
those areas, automatically take the initiative in the areas where his Titles
are superior, and be neutral otherwise.  Because of this, Vargr are terribly
confused by Llellewyloly, who accept low Charisma in some situations, demand
high Charisma in others, and speak as equals the rest of the time.

Beyond the reactions determined by Title, Llellewyloly are as varied as humans
in their personalities.  This includes their reactions to the universal
nickname "Dandie."

pressure-tolerant genes, as these are able to function more readily away from
the homeworld.

"Barbarian"

"Scientist"

Llellewyloly Player Characters (TNE)
	All Llellewyloly are born on Junidy.  Any Llellewyloly PC is assumed to be
high-pressure-tolerant, though a normal Llelewyloly may be played if so
desired.
	Llellewyloly vary less than many races in certain areas.  STR is not rolled
in the usual fashion, but is rolled using a rounded-down d3 like that used to
generate Initiative, with a modifier of +2.  This produces results between 3
and 5.  AGL and CON are generated normally on 2d6-1, with no modifiers for
homeworld.  INT and EDU are also generated normally, with an EDU score of 4 or
less indicating a "barbarian" upbringing.  CHR is generated normally.
	No Llellewyloly has ever shown signs of Psionic Potential.
	Social Standing among Llellewyloly is a complex and variable thing, changing
more rapidly than even Vargr are used to.  Each Dandie has a permanent Social
Standing equal to his highest Skill (not Asset), and a "situational" Social
Standing equal to its score in the Skill most useful in that situation.  In
addition, a "Barbarian" will have an effective permanent Social Standing of
half its normal level while in a city, as will "Scientists" in the country.
Only if one of these "out-of-place" Llellewyloly proves to have the Skill for
the situation will it be accorded its full Standing.
	Llellewyloly may follow nearly any of the standard Careers listed in the TNE
rulebook, subject to the normal characteristic and homeworld prerequisites.
Being of "barbarian" birth does not affect career choices.
	Because of their unique breathing requirements Llellewyloly acquire
Environment Suit skill more slowly, treating 2 levels acquired as only 1 level
of skill.  All Llellewyloly start with Acrobat-2 as one of their Background
skills, with the others being determined by upbringing. Rural ("barbarian")
Llellewyloly have a TL 3 society, while the city Dandies are TL 10.
	Llellewyloly may choose, either as a Background skill or as part of the
Interpersonal cluster, the "Patience (CHR)" skill.  This skill represents the
Dandy\'s tolerance for and patience with aliens, and is rolled whenever a human
or other alien fails to observe Llellewyloly social conventions of Title
(Llellewyloly have no patience with their own species). Llellewyloly
characters with a Patience Asset of 10 or higher are sufficiently cosmopolitan
and self-assured that they may ignore violations of Title completely while
among aliens.
	A Llellewyloly\'s body has CONx4 hit points, but suffers from firearms just as
the human head does (double damage; stunning; etc.). Each limb has points
equal to CON, which suffer as do human arms. If three or more limbs are
incapacitated, the injured Llellewyloly will be immobile, as well.

 As a footnote, I toyed with several pronounciations for "Llellewyloly" and
ended up with the one shown at the beginning of this post for a variety of
reasons, most of which have to due with the ease of speaking the name. The
name just doesn\'t work if Spanish rules are used, and I don\'t know Welsh rules
well enough to really have an opinion...

Actually, no, they use a somewhat more sophisticated for of psionics. 
IMC, there\'s only ESP-type psionics, but Ancients have much more 
powerful form of psi that uses life-energy of the entire ecosystem, 
which allows them to manipulate physical stuff. It also sucks in 
space. (Figuratively and literally - it drains the \'mage\'s\' 
lifeforce. That\'s why Ancients use giant eco-ships, which are still 
extremely vulnerable to technical monstrosities of Descendants (aka 
Humaniti). But their planets are practically impregnable - even to 
near-c rocks ;>>.)

Basically, they created Humaniti to deal with a problem that could 
not be resolved with magic - since they had their magic, the 
incentive to develop complicated technologies was null, and magically 
powered devices are not very effective in the void of space. 

Maybe someday I\'ll translate some of my stuff into English and post 
it on the WWW... 

(BTW: And it all started out when I wanted to begin a Hard-SF Star 
Wars campaign using CORPS. Sigh.)

If the domes are built without a solid structure and simply rely on
their higher internal pressure to keep them solid they will be much
lighter and cheaper.  Therefore this seems to me to be the way they are
most likely built.

If you want to be really degenerate you could use the canonical
Traveller rules for building lighter than air craft to determine the
weight and cost per square meter of this sort of "construction" by
building the building as an blimp & just taking away the propullsion
elements.  They are in FF&S 1.

Junidy has about 14 billion humans and about 14 billion of the native
Llellewyloly, or Dandelions (circa 1105).  CT\'s The Traveller Adventure
says (pg 88) "its population of 28 billion is about evenly split between
humans (who began to settle here in about 350) and the Llellewyloly
(called by humans Dandelions or Dandies), an intelligent race native to
the world."

Junidys population continues to grow after this point.  TNE\'s Regency
Sourcebook indicates that in 1117 its population was thirtysomething
billion and by 1202 was fourtysomething billion (with 10% + Vargr as
part of that population), this would tend to indicate a steadily or even
rapidly growing population. 

Junidy has a Non Charismatic Dictatorhip for a government (B) and
paramilitary law enforcement (law level D, just one step short of the
full fledged police state you see at Law Level E (MT Referes Manual)) so
it might well have one of those pro nativity "Breed rapidly so that your
children may serve the motherland." type policies.

[handwave snipped]

IMTU, I simply assume that, while you can build a robot that\'s physically
capable of doing the work of a crewmember, it\'s very expensive to produce a
robot smart enough and flexible enough to do the job as well as a human
would. Sure, you could make the robots conscious beings, and thus as
capable as a human, but as soon as you make them conscious they start
forming civil rights groups and labour unions, demanding a decent wage and
benefits and free annual maintenance and generally becoming just as
expensive as human crews, if not more so.

The cool thing with this solution is that it gives me an excuse to have
lots of synthetic people in the game, just ordinary citizens taking home
their paychecks like anybody else, except that they\'re assembled in
factories instead of in wombs...

Why is this fantasy? If the West Antarctic Ice Sheet breaks up - something
many glaciologists think is a very real possibility for the next century -
the oceans would rise about 60 meters. More if the Greenland ice sheet
follows suit, which seems plausible according to the scenarios I\'ve read
(Kim Stanley Robinson\'s _Green Mars_ and _Blue Mars_ examine this
possibility, for instance).

I don\'t have altitude data for Cairo at hand, but it\'s situated just inland
from the Nile Delta, i.e. not too far above sea level. So I suspect the
pyramids would indeed get wet if the oceans rose by 60m.

For comparison, here in downtown Montreal I\'m only a bit over 50m above sea
level. Most of this island would end up under water, and we\'re several
hundred kilometers from the ocean!

The surface area that need be airtight is much higher than using a dome so
I\'d say domes would be more reasonable unless there\'s no pressure
differential and all you need is some filters.

DXF sucks as it is basically a 3D graphics format without linewidth, text
comments etc (DXF also sucks as 3D format but that\'s off topic).
Use PDF as they\'re crossplatform and can be produced by any application
capable of printing (you basically print to a virtual printer that creates
the PDF.

Postscript dumps might work as well but there are platform differances and
most home users have no postscript printers.

Why not do unlike settings within the Traveller setting? I remember the
Haunted House Adventure played last with my group ... and the next will
get them into a Spy vs Spy story - but I am dreaming of a situation which
brings them onto a low-tech world like Earth\'s middle age, but with a
magocracy that uses high-level psionics and bred their own dragons (a new
breed of the crasted Jabberwock, maybe?)
My players shall believe they\'re no more in Traveller, but they landed on
an AD&D world .... would Algine (S. Marches, red zone declared by the
Scouts) be a nice place for that?

But you are free to build your own world using trav rules. That comes
often.

Uh-oh, I think we\'ve written much about Jump themes. But I\'ll try:

AFAIK, the last postings were about the fact that tha Jump drives
maintain the Jump bubble while in J-Space. If they are deactivated, the
Bubble collapses (slowly), which means that it is unlikely to survive
until the point the ship falls out of Jump space - if ever.

Another point: It won\'t be a good idea to flee a ship while lightyears
away from the nearest stars. Flee with what? another Jump-capable ship? I
think that ought to be a battle rider.

Another question comes to me now: The Battle of Two Suns (4th Frontier
War) was fought at a point between two stars (world hexes). Was reason did
the fleets have to meet there?

Calgary (Alberta) has the same thing.

While it is true that the building surface area would be  greater
than a dome there are a number of advantages which  would  offset
this.

First the \'modular\' nature of the non-dome  approach  allows  for
greater saftety.  Should there be an failure in the  system  (due
to accident, sabotage, poor construction,  or  poor  maintenance)
then only one building (or even only 1 floor of that building) is
at risk ... as opposed to an entire dome.

Second, cities are rarely built in one go but  slowly  grow  over
time.  A city dome would be a huge engineering feat  representing
"a substantial dollar investment".  Separate buildings  could  be
erected on a need-for basis thus both  spreading  the  cost  over
time and  giving  a  more  immediate  payback  as  buildings  are
finished quickly.  City  founders  may  find  it  easier  to  get
financial backing for a non-dome community.

Yep, I think I found the mistake. 2300AD uses light years and whoever wrote FF&S 1 
failed to recognize that. The formula is essentially the same, yet it uses parsecs. No

That is a Challenge Article I have got. But it was only about the hidden
Braykossa System at Regina, which is interesting enough. This also gives

I don\'t know if you got this from "The Regency Sourcebook". If you did, then
you\'re not at fault, of course. But the RS is. Have you considered the force
it would take to defeat the defenses of 28 billion people? Not to mention
the number of troops you\'d need to KEEP them occupied? And then there\'s the
whole notion that Norris would allow anyone to attack any planet in his

Deneb occupied by Vargr or Aslans, btw.). It\'s certainly not the impression
I get of Norris from reading about him.

I assume that a robot with \'Skill-X\' is capable of handling 95% of all
situations requiring \'Skill-X\' without human supervision and 100% of all
such situations with human supervision. These jump field flutters just
happen to be among the 5%.

I hadn\'t thought of that, but that\'s an excellent handwave. Whenever you need
to explain something away and don\'t want the new explanation to have further
ramifications, use magic (or, in this case, the Traveller equivalent of
magic).
 
>Or a vampire ship from TNE?

Ouch! Yes, another point I hadn\'t considered, since I don\'t play in a TNE
universe. Well, IMTU I have a ship with an intelligent computer (the last
ship built on Darrian before the _Maghiz_, an experimental scout ship)
jumping around, so obviously I must believe that a true AI can deal with
these flutters. But you need a TL 17 AI to do it, so it\'s not a problem in
the normal TU. There! That also accounts for vampire ships. 

>It really breaks down into two theories:

It breaks down to observable phenomena: In the Traveller Universe unmanned
ships are possible, but rare; manned ships are the norm. Therefore manned
ships are able to outperform unmanned ships. Any set of rules that makes
unmanned ships capable of outperforming manned ships must therefore be
failing to account for something.

Not if you postulate that they are impossible to construct prior to the late
11th Century or that they are more expensive in the long run than X-boats
(or both). But if they are both possible and cheaper than X-boats in 600,
then I\'d say you have to stretch canon to the breaking point to explain the
X-boat setup.

   Many glaciologists also believe that we are headed for a new ice age.
*Most* glaciologists aren\'t sure and want more data.  Bottomline is that it
isn\'t going to happen without significant additional global warming, and
that isn\'t going to happen if future history pans out as Traveller indicates.

   Why?

   1) increasing awareness that global warming *might* be a problem

   2) the development weather and climate control technology

   3) [and most importantly] the development of fusion power sometime early
next century

   I\'m not sure why the DGP author(s) insisted on melting the ice caps, the
only conclusion that I\'ve been able to reach so far is that classic
Traveller (IIRC Book 6: Scouts) listed in average temperature of Earth as 15
degrees C, which is of course around 3 degrees C too high.  To explain this
the DGP author(s) came up with the nonsense about melting ice caps.

   BTW, I\'m curious where you get the 60 meter figure for the sea level
rise.  The figure I saw was much less than that.

Regards,

Harold

P.S.  In the *real* world, where there is no guarantee of fusion power, the
bottomline on global warming is that it is a very gradual process that is
not easily reversed.  The increasing level of carbon dioxide in the
atmosphere probably contributes to global warming, but to what extent it
does so in Earth\'s extremely complex ecosphere scientists do *not* know with
any certainty (though it is easy to find a PhD who will give a theory).
Estimates range from negligible to extremely serious--I\'ve even seen one
theory that states that it will cause global *cooling*.

   Problem is, by the time we get all this sorted out and *if* global
warming is a real, serious threat and not some eco-socialist bogeyman it
will probably be too late to do anything about it without radically changing
the way we live (and then it may still be too late).  Should we listen to
everything that environmental alarmists say?  Absolutely, just as we should
listen to everything that those that oppose them say.  But do so with a
critical ear, much of what is being presented out there as fact is usually
theory and in many cases is based on exaggerated projects or flawed data.
Also be wary of those who pretend to be "doing what is right for humanity"
or "right for the country", when in reality they have a political agenda
they are trying to advance--and that goes for both sides of the political
spectrum.  BS detectors on maximum, Mr. Spock.

   I\'m through digressing (again) now....

You both miss the point. In the Traveller universe people (and that includes
all sophont races, even the Aslans) generally _don\'t_ breed like that. In
1100 the average population level is 5. That\'s barely enough to sustain a
viable population, if some of the theories I\'ve heard are true. Even the
worlds that do have billions of people have often had so long to get to
that figure that their population expansion rates are pitifully low. Junidy
can easily get to 28 billion in 800 years. True. But what about Towers,
right next door to Junidy and with a much better environment? If they
started with the same million you assume for Junidy (that\'s a very large
initial colony, btw.), then their population expansion must be measured in
a few percent per decade... Look at Darrian. Setting their population at
the time of the _Maghiz_ at level 8, low for a planet that is said to have
experienced population pressures, and taking an 80% reduction into account
and assuming a slow growth during the recovery period, I still get a
figure for 55 that requires a population expansion of less than 8% per
_century_ to be only 2 billion in 1100.

No, in the Traveller Universe unrestricted breeding is the exception, not
the norm. (of course, one should not really assume a uniform expansion rate.
It\'s much more likely that new colonies expand rapidly to some comfortable
figure and then stop expanding at all, or very nearly. Only thing is, that
comfortable figure should IMO be something a lot higher than 900,000 people!)

My own explanation is that the optimum size of a society is about 100
million, varying somewhat with local conditions. IMTU high-population
worlds don\'t produce as much over and about basic necessities as medium
population planets do (on a per capita basis, that is; a high-population
planet still out-produces a medium-population planets, just not linearly).
On the average the naval budgets of pop 9 planets have a 50% penalty and
pop 10 planets a 75% penalty. That makes them respectively 5 and 25 times
as powerful as pop 8 planets rather than 10 and 100, which helps to
reduce their influence.

We didn\'t have any choice about whether to live here or on the vastly
more desirable planet in the next solar system. The original Junidan
settlers presumably did. Or did they?

Pirates? Technically speaking, perhaps, but how many of those "pirates"
sailed in ships costing the same or more as their victims, took the ship
as a prize (in full view of vitnesses) and sailed it off somewhere to sell
it? How many of them even captured the whole cargo and sailed off with it?

True, but then, most merchants wouldn\'t be found in deep space, now would
they? They\'d be found at the 100 diameter limit of planets or (arguably)
some Gas Giants). Much easier to patrol with a few space ships than an
ocean with surface ships...

Because if they could, most ships would be automated, and we know for a

We\'re like TL 7-8 here on earth, right?  Well, we can do just that with our
cruise missiles right now.  I really don\'t see why you need a sophisticated AI to
perform a simple jump. Especially if you have a human program the jump taking
into account any of the reported problems from hundreds of other jumps on the
same course. The only reason I can see the need for the engineer is repairing and
maintaining the jump drive and various other systems. If you periodically
(monthly) take the ship out of commission for routine maintenance that solves the
problem (and you\'d need to since the ship would be spending 99% of its time in
jumpspace.

Manned ships can outperform unmanned ships in a generalized function.  Robots and
automation VERY easily outperform men in specialized repeated functions. You
still need the man at the controls to turn it on and off and quality control,
programming, etc.  But my design for the message torp included that.  A man
programmed the cargo module computer with all the specs for the jump.

I really don\'t know much about "canon" and never have been to keen on keeping
obsolete junk just because someone says its common despite its inadequacies.
However, my suggestion is a replacement for the existing X-Boat setup.  When the
ships go out of service, they can be replaced with message torps with better
turnaround time, no crew to support (the tenders still need crews though) and no
life support needed. Squeezing it into a cargo module has the added benefit of
making them easy to ship.

I think that there has been some changes that make the proposed system possible
now that weren\'t back when the Xboat system was first set up.  Primarily the
reduction in minimum size for jump drives and removing the 100 dTon limit on jump
capable vehicles (probably not really gone, but the key word is "safe" limit as
in safe for human transport).

One question though, is an XBoat armed? Carrying mail requires an armed ship, 5
dtons of cargo space and a full time gunner.  I don\'t think an Xboat qualifies
(but I don\'t have the specs so I wouldn\'t know).

There is at least one other board game,
(Dark Nebula).

Plus a whole slew of non-GDW products
such as the FASA and Judges Guild stuff

Welcome to the Traveller Sale List.

On this list, extensive amounts of Traveller Material from all generations
of the game will be offered for sale or trade in long lists that would be
better suited to websites. Indeed, the product listing from the FarFuture
website will be reposted on many an occasion so you can be certain to know
what goodies you are missing.

Furthermore, the list offers chains of Me-too posts on requests for
material either photocopied or otherwise, and regular repeats of the old
favourite "Marc Can I Please Photocopy this Supplement because it\'s Out of
Print and Not for Profit". In addition, there will be occasional messages
from the various groups selflessly providing material to fuel this shopping
frenzy, groups such as BITS, Traveller Chronicle, SJG and even, once in a
blue moon, from IG.

Unfortunately, running such a shopping service is expensive, so we will
have to soldier on through the tedious and boring occasional messages from
our sponsors discussing the hows, whys and wherefores of the Traveller
universe.

Coming soon, the Traveller Shopping Channel.

Thank you. Normal service from me will now be resumed.

Responsibilities of "most" ships:
1) Jump between systems
2) Transit within systems
3) Transport Cargo
4) Transport Passengers
5) Communicate with local government
6) Chart System
7) Plot new course for jump
8) Shoot bad guys

Responsibilities for Xboat:
1) Jump precharted course
2) Transmit message to tender
3) Transport nonvolatile incidental cargo (data)

As I see it, "most" ships have alot more stuff to do than an xboat thus you
can\'t compare "most" ships to Xboats.

Not so fast there!  Perhaps some of the survivors of the Terran-introduced
plagues ate each other, but I doubt it -- they simply were incapable of
innovating the necessary recipies to handle it.

(We\'re not slamming down on your theory/handwave because we want to have
automated ships - we\'re trying to come up with a handwave that holds up to
scrutiny.)

One part of the old CT Canon is that most things are done by humans (later,
Robots came along which IMHO clearly failed to grasp the ramifications it
presented vs the canon: linear skill costs etc).

If we could perhaps come up with a handwave why most tasks seem so hard to
do by robots unsupervised by humans. One thing I\'ve been toying with is
that while it\'s easy to make robots do seemingly hard tasks such as
economic analysis etc some humanly mundane tasks such as repairing
powerplants etc requires experience and in order to give the robots that
experience they have to work several years in the field. This would make
the robots with high skills expensive.
But why aren\'t they copying the experience data from a trined robots into
massproduced repar bot brains? Because datastorage is analog, holographic,
faulttolerant, redundant in such a way that each set of data is configured
for a particular brain and would worke with degraded performance if at all
in another.

This could also give a reason why they make robots so longlived in Robots:
It\'s because robots that work with a human for several years in repairs
will accumulate a lot of experience and therefore actually go up in price.
The Robot builders therefore build them to last unlike car manufacturers
today.

Well, sort of.  Every known Ancient site has seemed to reinvent technology
from the ground up.  Confused the hell out of researchers for the laongest
time.

Take what is quite possibly the best known canonical Ancient site,
Twilight\'s Peak.  The door opened in response to human fear (psionic
trigger), the energy bridge needed no such trigger, and worked on a regular
cycle.  The food despensers worked for everyone, as did the waste facilities.

The planetary display and defense mechanism worked for any character who
fiddled with it. The sleep pods containing the Droyne warriors were
indeterminate.. they opened when disturbed, but that could have been a
mechanical reaction.  The guns used by the Droyne were definantly psionic.

Almost forgot.  The anti-matter battery found in the Octogon was non-psionic.

So only about half the known features need psionic abilities to work.  

As for Ancient worlds being immune to drop the rock.. where do you think
all those asteroid belts come from?

Very nice!  Although the cammo pattern on the Army uniform is pretty

And downtown Toronto has most of the major office building connected by an
underground walkway system, with restaurants and shops lining the walkway
level. Very convenient, if you know where you are going. (And if you
don\'t, good luck, because there are no decent signs. Apparently each
building owner wants you to shop at their building so they don\'t want you
to easily find your way to the next building. Silly, but that\'s pure
shortsighted capitalism in action on Bay Street.)

remember seeing standardized cargo containers in the classic and
MegaTraveller materials, I think it was in a digest article. Anyway, I
thought that there should be some for T4, so I designed some. This is
especially useful because it will effect your ship designs if you are
trying to build a ship that will carry cargo (you will want to optimize
the design to maximize the number of standard containers it can hold).

I used a minimally sized fuel cell for power. I do not know if this
makes sense or not. I had trouble figuring out how to do batteries.


Standard Cargo Containers:

Svenson Small Craft, LIC proudly announces the release of a complete
line of standardized cargo containers. All containers conform to
the specifications set forward in the Imperial Trade Commission\'s
Standard Cargo Container Specification document.

Trade and commerce is greatly enhanced by the use of standard sized
cargo containers. The Imperium has to use such containers to speed
operations in busy ports. The most flexible sizes for small ships
would run through 1 ton, 2 ton and 4 ton sizes.

If designed properly they would be stackable and interchangeable.
So, two 2 ton containers would fit where one 4 ton container would
be stored and two 1 ton containers would fit where one 2 ton
container would be stored.

A ships cargo hold would be designed to optimize the storage of
these standard sized containers.

The following have been designed using version 2.0 of Andrew Akins\'
FF&S2 spreadsheet program.

Go to my web site and grab Accrete.  You have to enter the stellar mass and
luminosity (and for version 3, the physical attributes of the mainworld),
but it creates very nice solar systems.

It runs under DOS, so I don\'t know how well the DOS-emulator in Win95
handles it.

 Given the level of "official" publication at the moment (and since I
finished the article), especially of anything focused on the Marches,
I have little hope of that happening quickly. It\'s why I\'ve been sitting
on the article this long. If Kevin\'s fine magazine (Traveller Chronicle,
for the uninformed) counts as "Official" in your sense of the word, then
you may get your wish. Otherwise I get to wait for FFE/IG/SJG/??? to get
around to the right era/corner of space...

  This is pulled from the maps and other mentions in MegaTraveller.
Why refer to it as "occupation" by the Vargr? Because until Norris notices
and drives them off, the TL12-13 Vargr have it all over the TL3/10 Junidans,
especially in space. All it takes is the threat of blowing a dome and the
Vargr own it, at least long enough to loot it (which is what they REALLY
want to do, after all). I expect the Vargr wouldn\'t set foot in the wilds
of Junidy more than once, since they can\'t find the settlements of the
"Barbarian" Llellewyloly easily, have to wear protective gear, and can\'t
depend on their two best senses (hearing and smell), but the domes are
easy.
  Also, I give no indications of how long the Vargr "owned" Junidy. The
Vargr could have arrived, looted, and been driven off many times during
the course of the Rebellion Era. The 1120 maps in MegaTraveller could
simply be a snapshot of the moment.
  As for the Regency Era, if there happened to be more Vargr insystem
when the Virus arrived, then travel is suddenly _really_ stupid, so the
Vargr, after "reassigning" (to the airlock) the leaders that put them in
such a pickle, would attempt to mix in with the natives. (yuck, what a
sentence).

  That help any?

	Well, no.  But I have done just the oppisite.  I have used other rules to
play the Traveller universe.  I tried GURPS, but found the rules to
sluggish, so I now use the Storyteller system by White Wolf games.  It
works very well I think.

I\'m working on a VB application that will do that by WBH standards, but I don\'t
know when I will be ready to release it (it\'s a spare time animal).  There are a
couple of spreadsheets available for it.

side, whether it is the form of on-line auctions, public announcements of
products available by publishers, individuals trying to locate items, people
shamelessly plugging their own work, or whatever.  Normally it doesn\'t take
up as much of the list as it is at the moment, but I don\'t think it\'s time
to storm in and toss the money changers out of the temple just yet.

Junidy        3202 B434ABD-9  W Hi                 310 Im F7 V M9 D

4000 m/dia
Very Thin Atmosphere
30% Hydrosphere

Hmmmm...Based on this I\'d say the population is highly concentrated, and relies
heavily on artificial life support.  Occupation would be difficult, but invasion
and short term expoitation of the planet could be done, provided the invaders
got into the engineering/life support sections of the
domes/arcologies/underground communities and the high orbit was controlled.  I
also imagine the threat and/or demonstrated use of weapons of mass destruction
could contain a large portion of the population.  You can do a lot in the short
term, if the population is convinced that resistance will only lead to death.

So far as long term occupation goes, I don\'t imagine that Norris would allow the
situation to continue for long, however.  The planet would be too valuable to
the domain.

It depends on how you mean canonical.  "Adventure 1: The Kinunir," has a

Damn!  I was late.  Oh well.  If I remember correctly, one of the engineers
who worked on the ship complains that such a well-made ship shouldn\'t be in

I\'ve also created a Access Database that can create 1000\'s of worlds. It
only creates systems based on the MT: Referee\'s Manual. It creates the
entire UWP plus gives the Trade Classifications, Bases, Population
Modifiers, Gas Giants, and Planetoid Belts. It just makes a list of all
this. There are no star chart placements. It\'s a little buggy. The Trade
classifications don\'t always come out right. And sometimes the GG and PB\'s
don\'t come out right either.

I haven\'t put much work into since I downloaded Galactic, but I would be
more than willing to send a copy of the database to you.

Thanks, Harold.

I don\'t mean to waste bandwidth... or whatever. But a message is vary easily
deleted. I, for example, skip most messages that don\'t concern me. I don\'t
have to read every single message. I like the auctions. I liked Merrick\'s
web-based auction. But, some of us don\'t have the web page to have an
auction. I\'ve even bought a few things from the list that I would never have
been able to find.

This is the main source for KiSS stuff and is very well done.  You should
be able to find a version of KiSS displaying software for whatever computer

(Furthermore, the whole site has alot of pretty neat-o stuff on it.  It\'s

	BTW it does\'nt make sense to buy a customer priced postscript printer.

	An old HP4L with an 4dx33 running ghostscript prints faster than the

  About the only thing I have to complain about with the hand waves
regarding automated processes for piloting ships is this:

 If you take an engineer, ask him to create a mockup of the engine room,
and then have him create situations that routinely occur where he needs to
intervene, and you will have the basis for creating software that can solve
the problems in precisely the same manner as the engineer would.  If you
keep getting better and better engineers to creat that mock up, then too,
should you create better and better programs.
  Also, as a point of contention:  If you take an engineer who deals with
the day to day stuff, with a skill of Engineering 1, why can\'t a program
worth the equivalent of engineering 1 not handle the task?  The program
would fail as often as the engineer would.  The only real thing that the
engineer could do that the computer can\'t, is *GUESS* at the correct answer
when all else fails.

No, when I said that communications routes were bad I didn\'t mean
non-existant.  If that\'s what I meant, that\'s what I would have said.  By
today\'s standards (even by the standards of the American "Wild West")
J-Drive is a bad way to get information out.

Yes.  There may have been mail runs before the Xboat routes.  Doesn\'t
matter either way.  Around the time of the long night, this external
influence was (largely) eliminated.  So, no loger could the Ziru Sirka (or
the Rule of Terra) influence cultures directly.  Submerged cultures would
return, new cultures would be created by pocket empires, each with their
own agenda and way of doing things, etc etc.

No, but you have to study Rome in order to, say, base a system of
government on a Roman system of government.  Or, you have to study those
who have studied Rome, and so on.  By the time you get out to, say Daibei,
the chain becomes longer and longer and more unwieldy.  So yes, there is a
big difference in the comparison here.  In addition, Rome was close to
England, Spain, Holland and France, so distance was not a problem for this
way of thinking.

And yes, it took a long time to get from the U.S. to Europe...  But then
again, look what happened as a result.  Revolution and overthrow of foreign
rulership.

I\'m not saying that types of government won\'t be based on Vilani forms of
government.  I\'m not saying languages will not have Vilani roots.  All I\'m
saying is, that by the time of the Third Imperium, Vilani influence will be
felt less strongly than is popularly believed.  The comparison here would
be like saying that due to the influence of Rome on the west, all of Europe
still spoke Latin daily and felt the same way about science, technology,
and philosophy that Romans did with no change.

A canon source for the three biggest megacorporations being Vilani, please?
 I don\'t doubt that they\'re big, and I don\'t doubt that they\'re powerful. 
I just doubt that all three are the biggest and most powerful.  If "silly
old Vilani" traditions makes it harder for a massive corporation to sell
its goods, then they surely would try to phase them out without even a
second thought.

At this point though, the discussion is pretty much academic though, and it
doesn\'t really seem to be going anywhere.  I\'ll continue if you\'d like, but
right now it seems fruitless.

I don\'t remember the three _biggest_ ones being Vilani; certainly all the
finance and banking-oriented megacorps are Vilani (IIRC).

I understood the V&V conception of Vilani society to be that the Vilani
were especially _good_ at selling products and running businesses; that
their macguffin was "organization", just as "land" is for Aslan, "psionics"
are for Zhodani, and "charisma" is for Vargr.

IIRC this is the figure Kim Stanley Robinson gives in _Blue Mars_. His
ice-cap-breakup scenario seems really plausible, I think, and doesn\'t rely
intirely on global warming: in his book the current warming is only
responsible for breaking up the Ross Ice Shelf, which causes ocean levels
to rise somewhat, but at first not quite catastrophically. With the weight
of all that ice removed from the sea floor, you get geostatic rebound - the
depressed land starts to bounce back up - and magma starts flowing where it
was previously blocked (this is the theory behind the reactivation of
volcanism in Mt. St. Helens). Soon volcanos are erupting under the West
Antarctic ice sheet, cracking it up from below. When it breaks up and
melts, that\'s when the 60m rise happens.

From other sources I\'ve heard lower figures, too, like 50m or so. Maybe
some forecasts take into account the increased polar precipitation that
would lead to increased precipitation, hence a lower figure. As you point
out, there\'s a lot of uncertainty. IIRC, Robinson\'s figure is itself a
projection, with a lot of caveats.

Whatever. It\'s definitely not something *I* want to live through!

Best,

Don\'t be.  While some of the exchanges get a bit...exuberent, I think that this
is probably the perfect forum for initially offering up material - most of us
are either well endowed with traveller material, or actively hunting for more
(or both)!

For instance, a good case can be made that even in 1115, Hortalez et Cie
and Zirunkariish are two of the richest megacorporations, based purely 
on the amount of stock they own in the others.  Neither of them are in 
the Vilani "big three" (although Zirunkariish might qualify as a fourth
member of the "big three").  :)

I for one am trying to restore my collection of Traveller materials.  Much
of this would not have been possible without the contacts I have found on
the list.  There is no other centralized point on the Internet where this
kind of information can be so readily given and obtained. 

I\'m sorry that we got in your way.  We were only pursuing our interest in
Traveller.  No harm was intended, and we usually take the threads off the
list ASAP.  I hope that you can find it in your heart to show a little
forbearance, because I really don\'t want it to stop, and I don\'t think the
TML\'s mandate requires us to stop.  (Please correct me if I am wrong about
the latter point.)

GIF and JPEG are raster-based; people seem to be interested in vector

IIRC Maclink 9.0 will translate to PICT (easiest way to get it is to
transfer to OS8 but that\'s no good if you have less than a 040 processor).
Why not EPS or pdf?

I know. It\'s just getting to be the majority of the posts at the moment.

Most of the TML goes out as Digest (or at least Rob said that in his last
post). It is difficult to delete a single message from a Digest. So I
disagree.

I agree. My real gripe is with the number of people reposting the whole
message and then adding \'Me too\' at the end. A significant part of the
posts are just dross because of this.

It isn\'t trouble really, I was just getting fed up with the repetition of
long mail messages with a one line tag at the end. Not necessarily by
yourself. Or the long messages with a small single line quote hidden in the
middle of a complete repost. Grrr!

Harold - the post was meant as a slightly tongue in check, semi-sarcastic
comment on the number of commercial mails and the needless requoting which
seems to be de-rigour at the moment. If the tone offended I apologise.

I agree that the me-toos should be remanded back into the point-and-click
oblivion from whence they were originally spawned.  However, I must urge
that we target them, and not people offering to sell stuff, as I do not
wish to discourage the sellers.  Generally, the sellers have been very
polite. 

No genuine offense taken.  :)

Actually, fun aside, it *did* ... the first explorer to see it named it "Bay of
Smokes", because of all the fires the local indians had lit for hunting purposes
(to flush out game and the like). Bahia de los Fumos (excuse the poor Spanish).

However, consider that Norris had other problems as well. He didnt know
wheather he could trust the Zhos. The Domain was cut off from the rest
of the imperium, thereby cuttiong off all possible reinforcements. As
the Domain still was somewhat of a backwater even in 1116, the
industrial capacity isnt as high as that of other domains. Corridor and
its fleet are gone, therefore reducing further the number of ships
available to defend worlds. He couldnt risk exposing the Zhodani
frontier back then so most ships would be stationed there. 
On the other hand there were massive iheiti (?) forces coming from
Rimward, pushing into Domain territory and large vargr fleets from
Coreward. Norris simply couldnt afford to defend everything. Later,
when the situation normalized, he must have realized that taking back
the lost territory would cost more than it yielded. So he struck a deal
with the former invaders and let them keep their territories. That way,
peace was maintained and the domain could survive.

	WMF, DXF, et al. are vector formats, which are much more easily
scaled, edited, and generally messed with. GIF and JPEG are raster or
bitmap formats. Not nearly as nicely edited.

Speaking of which, I\'ve decided to auction off those traveller figures.

Current highest bid is : timmon@primenet.com, for $60

Ok you veterans out there, just how do I go about running this thing OFF
the list?  Do I need to create some sort of mailing group?  I am running
Netscape Messenger in the Communicator 4.04 package.

Thanks in advance!

Graphic Converter is the way to go for conversions on a mac.

But I agree with the person who said that .dxf sux. .wmf is a poor
imitiation of a pict file, and the others are raster graphics.
Unfortunately, .eps and straight postscript are useless for manipulation
unless you have Illustrator, Freehand, or maybe Corel.

.pdf, while attractive for distribution, doesn\'t allow editing.

This is only the top of the great graphics file format morass...there
really _is_ no such thing as a universal vector graphics format.

If I were forced to vote, however, it\'d be along platform lines..I\'d
prefer a .pict file.

I\'ve ran a campaingn set in the Old Earth Union.  There is no single
dominating state like the Imperium.  Instead there are several successor
states to the Terran Mercantile League. The players were part of the
Exploration and Survey Service.  They crewed a long range scout ship that
did a run all they way out to the Easter Confederation. They had to deal
with the hostile actions of the Dingir Republic, which was a serious rival
to the Union.

Note: Calculations and Energy expenditures don\'t necessarily have to
be done at the same time.  Nor do they have to be done once.  You can
clearly have some sort of calculation and energy expenditure and then
a series of calculations, of unknown complexity, along the way.   After
all, Jump drive is not a real theory and has unknown requirements.

The only real constraint is that if you could drive a ship automatically,
there would automatic bulk cargo ships and the requirements for
crew in the ship design would be wrong.

	My suggestion is to cover more than one base. First of all, provide
the original file as the author created it. Those who have that
program, or a decent converter, can get the best-quality version to
play around with. Provide something like DXF for others, which most
vector programs can read to some extent. As an alternative, fall back
on WMF or PICT. Finally, if you can, provide a GIF at a standard
scale (i.e. 1"=300pixels), which can be sized down if needed. 300 DPI
provides decent printer output, AND allows sufficient resolution to
downsize adequately.

By doing it on two levels, ie the player character level and the macro
economic level made it much more interesting.  
I ran the Old Earth Union and tried to account for the lower tech but more
uniform tech levels in the Confederation era.  I would carry out economic
aid and technical aid to any world 3 or more tech levels below the Union
average.  This tended to hold back the more advanced worlds like Terra.
Over the long term, however the higher average tech and population levels
give you a lot more RUs to play with.  This would also in a "Contact with
the Imperium Era" give you less incentive to join the Imperium as you
already have a internal trade almost as good as the Imperium can provide.  A
unifromly higher tech and economic level also makes you much more expensive
to attack in subversion and trade wars.  This would explain why the Imperium
held off annexation of Terra until the 500\'s when its sheer size at that
time would give it the advantage.

These guys are on base! I am trying to restore my Traveller collection and
if it was not for the postings on TML I would be at a loss.

I think that the sale of hard to find information is a valid use of TML!

I have seen a bunch of S*** posted here that is TOTALLY USELESS with
respect to Traveller yet the same people drone on and on about topics or
tangents of topics that have no place on TML without a WORD of  OBJECTION
from anybody.

Let the content the TML be up to its administrator and stop complaining
about legitimate Traveller related dealings!

And, as I mentioned before, a dome has tremendous force trying to
lift it off the ground and must be anchored *very* securely at
the edges.  A large enough dome is very likely to require supports
to hold it down which must be stronger than any existing (or even
possible) material.

Extract pe.zip into your galactic directory with file extensions/directories.
You\'ll also need to edit the gal.lst file to include pe (use a text editor for
this)
Then start up Galactic (gal.exe)
select/edit galaxy
pick the letter corresponding to pe

Note that I\'m just a guinea pig, but I fiddled around with it until it worked.

I am sure the it was a figure of speech; not meant to describe the vegans as

  Piracy? Did someone say piracy?

 Actually, it would work in the later 3I if they were
all secretly licensed by the Navy in some form, which
would explain why they don\'t chuck people out airlocks
or take ships instead of just the cargo - the documents
needed are much more expensive.

  Of course, once the Rebellion starts, the Navy sells
more permits to pay for more BatRons, and thus the whole
MT situation arise, while giving the appearance of being
an organic mechanism involving attrition and economics.

  Damn, the background just gets more sophisticated as
you analyze it thoroughly, don\'t it?

So am I.  :^)

Unless, of course, as of "Adventure 1: The Kinunir" Vegans were supposed to

Some of the links on this site drop out periodically. I couldn\'t download
the Mac viewer, for example, because my ISP couldn\'t resolve the domain
name. Later it worked. Then it didn\'t...

Also, I couldn\'t get Jo\'s dolls to load on the Mac viewer. Apparently
these things aren\'t completely cross-platform...

	Or you put weight on top of the dome. One suggestion I remember
seeing was roofing over craters with a flexible material. Rather,
you\'d use two layers, with a meter or two space between them. The
volume between layers is filled with water. That counteracts the
immense upward pressure of the atmosphere AND provides additional
radiation shielding.

I don\'t remember the square footage. I don\'t remember any Traveller products
going into the shredder...the distributors took most of them, and what they
didn\'t want we either sent to Crazy Egor or the local gamers got. I helped
Marc fill his car a couple of times, and I know he was there when I didn\'t see
him. 

Same with Twilight: 2000 -- distributor demand for that was pretty high. Most
of what went to the recycler was boardgame components, which I\'m afraid
included a few Star Cruiser components (we got a bunch of volunteers to come
in and assemble SC\'s until we ran out of one counter sheet -- assembled games
we could sell to distributors, but they didn\'t want components). After we all
got done, before we called the recycler, we called the local hobby shop and
the game\'s club at the university, and lotsa gamers came by and walked out
with their arms full. 

There was a guy in Champaign Illinois that I sold a lot of my stash to when I
moved to Texas...forget his name but he sells on line. He\'s probably been
advertising a lot of Traveller stuff lately.

are looking for artists to illustrate the GURPS Traveller line.

Qualified applicants need to be able to meet deadlines, and follow our
instructions as to canon exactly. They also need to be willing to work for
what we are willing to pay, and to draw what we ask for, not what they feel
like. We need people who can work in color, but black and white alone is also
ok. We need people who can do good quality, hard SF type illos of spaceships,
people, astronomical scenes, aliens, and equipment (although you needn\'t be
able to do everything). Anatomy and accuracy are important. People who
specialize in large-eyed kittens on black velvet need not apply. 

A knowledge of the Traveller background is important, and a working knowledge
of GURPS would be nice, but is not required (these are pictures, after all,
not rules manuscripts). A willingness to re-execute a piece if necessary is
vital. 

Ability to fax or email sketches is a plus, and an Email address is a nice
thing to have.

Please send all responses to LKW@IO.COM and I will forward them to our new art
director. 

IMPORTANT: Please don\'t flood me with Email telling me who I should or should
not use, or telling me that I should hire "so-and-so" because he used to work
for DGP. If you happen to be on a first name basis with an artist who can meet
our qualifications, have them get in touch with me. I\'d rather not deal with a
hundred messages telling me something I already know.

In case your interested, we are in touch with Bill Keith and Rob Caswell, and
negotiating. I am not at liberty to reveal more at this time.

We will look at physical portfolios, or web sites, or both.

Houston has a similar setup in response to the extreme heat and rain.
Most downtown buildings are connected by underground (or some above
ground) tunnels.  They have shops and restaurants in them.  They
also have signs and maps scattered around along with some undeground
courtyards.

I think that more common than large domes will be small spheres
and individual buildings connected by walkways with special covered
parks for getting that "outside" feel.

One good reason for this is that a thin atmosphere planet with only
huge domes would be easy to conquer.  The invading fleet would just
shatter one of the domes and threaten to shatter the rest.  The
world would most likely surrender right away.  Shattering a dome
would be pretty easy, just fire projectile cannons or launch small
meteors at the dome in sufficient numbers that you make enough holes
to weaken the structure.  Once you get a sufficient sized hole, the
air would start rushing out and widen the hole until you had a
quite large hole and thin atmosphere inside the dome.

Large domes, I think, would be more common on worlds with standard
pressure and tainted atmospheres.  You could float the dome by
increasing the internal pressure just a bit over atmospheric and
keep the air pure.

What about a geo-dome?  They do not require massive weight or support.

	It\'s not really the weight of the dome or how you keep it *up*
that\'s the problem. It\'s how you keep it *down*--the pressure of the
atmosphere inside is huge.

I\'ve been reading PE and a couple of questions have come up.

First, there are no limitations indicated for Resource Trade (pages
38-40).  It appears as if a world can gain Resources from imports and
exports even if it doesn\'t have anyone to trade with, or without regard to
the attributes of its trading partners.  I suppose it\'s easy enough to fix
by just ignoring either the problem or the rule, or applying a simple fix
that says you can\'t do Resource Trade without at least N trading partners.
What should N be valued at?

Second, unlimited population growth beyond Pop Code A doesn\'t seem to have
any effect on a world.  Shouldn\'t there be a variety of cultural, social,
and hence economic, effects resulting from this?  Shouldn\'t instability
result from overpopulation?  Don\'t many worlds have a hard limit to the
population they can support, given Resources and Infrastructure?  Doesn\'t
a population control policy effect Popularity?  Am I wrong or do we need a
lot of rules to deal with this issue?

More generally, do we just start using Pop Code B (hundreds of billions)?
What about C?  Or D?  Where is the limit, and what happens when it is
reached?  Surely war and colonization are not the only ways to "stabilize"
a population.

I realize this has probably been hashed out on the list before, but I
would have ignored the thread because I only recently acquired Pocket
Empires and found the time to read it.  I\'d like to work out the apparent
logical gaps, because I think it would be a fun simulation to work on.

I know that some of the authors are on the TML.  Did you have more rules
for this, or ideas for rules, but not the time or the space to develop
them?  Is there a website or something else I\'ve missed? 

So many questions, so few answers.  Some day I hope to provide more
answers and fewer questions.  :)

Clark

I\'d be perfectly happy to accept the need for crew during jump if somebody can
provide a  canonical reference to crews actually doing something while jumping.
From  what I\'ve read on the list, once you\'re in jump, you\'re there for the duration
and nothing can stop that (short of blowing yourself up).

I\'m not even proposing that the computer calculate the course, just that it executes
the course.

Hard Times is a supplement for the post-Rebellion, pre-Virus Imperium
(1122-1128).  Well, not completely post-Rebellion, but well after every
sane person in the galaxy was sick of it and most of the resources used to
fight it were gone.  It gives campaign background material, economic UWP
effects, various adventures, and primitive spacecraft design rules (the
first for MT).  Each chapter details a different aspect of the Hard Times
(megacorps, finance, the Black War, raiding, doomed worlds, etc.) and
includes one adventure pertaining to the chapter material.

It\'s a really depressing book, but the primitive ships are neat.  The
pictures inside the front cover says it all (some poor political tagger
got his hand almost completely shot off by a trooper).

Gurps Traveller is beginning to sound better and better! When did you
say it should be out (need to start saving money)

More great news. Finally a replacement slot for Traveller that could
fill some of the gap that challenge left beind (i miss that mag, sob!
One week before i heard of its demise i had determined to order a

The second ugliest ship in the traveller universe, a modified Leviathan

modules and a 100T cargo module. The major modification was the addition
of a 200T Safari type yacht in external grapple.

	The complete thing is :

	- The infected TL:D computer calculates jump
	- The Priest is checking the calculation and programs a TL:6
	  mod1/bis analog computer (just a more complex timer with the
	  size of a refrigerator) for the jump.
	- While most of the crew now has a kickback, the engineer has a
	  lot of work. 1/3 of the JD is HPG, HPG is mechanic and not
	  intended running 7*24 hours at full rate of fire. Of course
	  the HPG is much bigger than necessary from TL:A+, even if HPGs
	  get smaller with each techlevel, a chief will prefer to have
	  more backup HPG, so the size of the drive does\'nt decrease.
	- The priest is just needed for prayer at the end of the week,
	  and as his prayer is listened by god (me ;-) the ship exists
	  jump space - that the prayer also includes massive calculation
	  for the best jump exit point should be mentioned ;-)

	Well why does a ship needs humans on board is of course the main
	question. But even this has a simple solution. The Rurevayn pocket
	va^h^hempire constrains ships to carry a human transponder. So many
	ships are either fully manualy controlled (with a lof of humans) or
	carry at least 3 humans. One for the body swap, one for the own ship
	and one as a backup. The work of the human transponder is mainly
	to chat with a human transponder on an other ship to identify the
	other as human. If this is done, transponders are doing body swap,
	means that each ship sends one human to check if anything is allright
	on the other ship. When the transponder gives his/her ok (that the
	other ship realy has humans on board, and that they are looking
	ok), a ship is allowed to visit a starport or to exchange trade
	items. Most systems in Rurevayn and surround have planetary
	advanced defenses, and hunting down of ships without human
	transponders saves free trade in the area. The most common term
	for human transponder is "communication officer" as the transponder
	has to relay every communication between a ships computer and other
	computers to avoid reinfection by a puppetier.

Okay, I\'m assuming your working on the standard 1 in 2 chance rule. Try going
down to 1 in 3 for standard, 1 in 6 for sparse and 1 in 12 for rift. I think
you\'ll find your sectors better with those odds.

Locomotives make various stops, cross roads, cattle, bridges, sharp turns,
etc.  All of these require changes in course and speed.  None of these exist
in J-space.

Starships have THREE computers for just such an emergency. Occam would surmise
that such an occurrence would not be coincidence. There is one person that
doesn\'t feel better about people on board, whoever\'s paying the lifesupport
bill.

  I\'m talking about a very specialized use here.  Planet to planet would
definitely need crew (or at least crew would be less expensive than the
automation required). But I\'m talking about throwing a small package through a
hole with somebody on the other side to catch it.

Merchants could do something like that but they\'d have to offload freight onto
the jump torp and then reload it on the other side.  Not very  efficient.
Xboats already have the system in place.

It comes down to this:
If a person is needed on board during a jump, he is assumed to be doing
something that effects the jump.  If he can effect the jump, he can shorten
the week or lengthen it by making dramatic changes in the jump.  If he\'s there
for maintenance, I don\'t think its advisable to actually "Work" on an active
jump drive.  Maintenance can be done in cycles by the tenders (if the torps
are cargo container sized, you can work on them in the cargo bay).

From what I understand, sensors don\'t work outside the jump bubble/grid.  If
that\'s so, then you\'re flying blind.  If you\'re flying blind, a pilot is
unneccesary, in fact it becomes a liability and most likely an immediate
misjump.  Its like in Red October with the stop watch and the super accurate
map.

One of the nice things was that Hard Times allowed a more dynamic universe
than we\'d seen before.  Used to be that UWPs were unchanging, and Fiore
would be the same no matter how any times you ravaged it.  Now, Entire
worlds could be found deserted as the enviromental controls failed, or when
a Black War fleet nuked the type C Starport as a strtegic asset, leaving
the locals to starve.

My favorite was the man slumped over by the partially open hanger door, his
head cradled in his arms.  Through the door you could see a Free Trader
(one of the example ships from SSOM, IIRC.)  I often wondered what his
story was.. is he a resident of a Doomed World who just found out there is
no more space on the ship, the last one leaving?  Did he manage to get his
family aboard, but not himself?  Or is the ship\'s owner, finding out that
there are no more repair facilities and his days as a ship\'s captain are
ended, just after selling his beloved vessel for its spares parts and scrap?

Very powerful image, that one was.

If the officer in question is the commander of a ship, Captain is correct.
However, in most English-speaking armies, addressing a superior officer by
rank is something of an insult.  If the officer you need to address is in a
group, you can say something like "Excuse me, Major Dawson? Sir, you\'re
needed at the TOC."  Also, to get an officer\'s attention over a distance,
you can use his/her rank and name to get attention.

One oddity of the US Army is the term L.T.  Lieutenants us LT as the
abbreviation for their rank, and soldiers have adopted LT (both letters
prounounced) to refer to their own platoon leader.  With a good LT, you
could use it in direct conversation in informal situations.  1LT Foster, a
platoon leader of mine, didn\'t mind being called LT by anyone in the field,
for example.

Yes, as a matter of fact.  The Native American (Gabrieleno) name for the
LA Basin translated as "The Plain of Smoke."  We have a near-permanent
inversion layer, so smoke from any source -- brushfires, campfires, or
five million cars -- tends to stay close to the ground and near its
source.  The Spaniards also commented on this when they first came through
the area.  (They also experienced a small earthquake their first night
beside the Los Angeles River.  Welcome to LA!)

In a TL13+ society, would the automation required be more expensive than a
crew, especially in the long run?  I was watching a show a while back that
was explaining the differences in European and American passenger aircraft.
 American aircraft use less automation because the companies don\'t really
trust "autopilot".  European aircraft use much more automation (the pilot
is there with an extremely limited role), and more or less fly themselves
most of the time.

Basically, if we can fly an airplane in all but emergency situations with
automation, I don\'t see why 3+ TLs down the line, the process of flying a
ship in space can\'t be automated entirely.

Traveller came out in the late 70s, and seemed to have been strongest up
through about 82 or 83.  At this time, science-fiction books and movies, in
most cases, didn\'t take computers and automation into account.  Traveller
is a child of that.  That is the truth that I\'ll tell my players if they
ever ask...  In this case there\'s no real need to handwave.

  This is by far the greatest explanation for the manned X-boat system I\'ve seen
so far.  My merchant marine uncle mentioned the same thing.  It isn\'t so much
that it CAN\'T be done, just that it WON\'T be done.  After the Virus episode,
nobody would trust a computer only thing.  Before  that, unions could very well
be the source of the problems.  Pilots had a good thing going... plug in a few
coordinates and sit back for a week. They aren\'t going to give that up easy.

The message torpedo thing would actually make pilots WORK for their living.  Jump
pilots would have to program 2 to 3 jumps per day. Instead of 14-21 pilots, you\'d
have one (well 3 assuming proper rotation).  Their glamorous jobs would be
reduced to shipping clerks and shuttle jockeys. But here\'s the catch, if it is

To answer the "CATCH", maybe some areas did indeed say "screw the
union".  To be more realistic, I would think that some X-Boat networks
were run the first way, and some the second where people who\'s only goal
is profit, are in control (or in very influential positions).  Just like
in the real world, you don\'t have consistency accross the board, you\'ll
have different procedures ran by different groups.

Famous Scene for the day :

		I shrugged to myself.  What the hell.

This is the stuff that dreams are made off, bad ones that is. Makes one wish one had a

But the story of the Demise of GDW is a sad one anyhow, this just adds to the sadness!

This is what I use...

Dense     1 in 2    (about 40/subsector)

Standard  1 in 3    (about 27/subsector)

Sparce    1 in 6    (about 13/subsector)

Rift      1 in 10   (about 8/subsector)

Empty     1 in 20   (about 4/subsector)

I don\'t really create *random* sectors. When I\'m creating a sector, I plan
out how I want it to be: where are the mains, the rifts, dense and empty
areas. Then I roll up those sections (usually not corresponding to
subsector boundries) using the ratios I listed above.  After I finish, I
look at the results and custom-tailor things, moving, adding and/or
deleting stars to fit the effects I\'m looking for. The random rolls
sometimes give me interesting effects I didn\'t plan on, and I try not to
exceed the number of stars I originally generated in a
subsector...semi-random, I guess.

Like all great thinkers, Clarke posited three laws.  I can\'t recall their
numeration offhand, but they are:

* Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.
* When a distinguished but elderly scientist says something is possible,
  he\'s almost certainly right.  When he says something is imposible, he\'s
  quite likely wrong.
* The only way to determine the limits of the possible is to go beyond
  them into the impossible.

The first of these is most famous, so is often refered to as "Clarke\'s
Law."

	Unions are not a problem, but to counter imperialism. Think about
	a 27999 paper freighter, designed for sweden->england. The ship
	intended had a crew of 5, because of union they now have 9 on board.
	This ship looks like a ghost ship compared to a standard 999 rock\'n\'
	roller tramp freighter, which has the same crew size. You want at
	least one human for that case of the unusual, and you certainly
	want more if the ship got bigger. Compare a traveller ship to a
	WWII U boat. Lets say the Aluette a XXIII Kuestentauchboot. With
	a size of 280 qm it had a crew of 12 in 4 bunks. Even officers
	did\'nt had a stateroom. The crew accomodation shows, that either
	by vilani tradion, or by imperial standards, even a warship is
	a luxus liner.

	1/36 that you need a human on board, so humans will be worth for
	1/36 of the ship price for jump - I want some on board just for
	case, they are much cheaper than insurance !

It\'s a good read, that is entertaining with the level of tension that
exists throughout the story. I found the character twists to be intriguing and,
in one particular personality, a real surprise. In addition to the
"twists", there were several characters that especially caught my
attention, such as Sgt. Calmille, and Commodore Gerray.

I have never studied Napoleonic warfare, in great detail, however, I found
Martin\'s descriptions and explanations interesting and riveting, as the
battles took place. Another point of interest was the sword play. Martin
did a fine job of "painting" a clear picture of what was happening. A good
visualization tool.

I also felt that the mixture of "magic" (Thaumaturgy) and technology was
well done, in terms of the coalition of the two "sciences". The Thaumaturgy
was given as much legitimacy as the technology, and in some ways resembled
the psionics of Traveller.

Overall, I enjoyed the book, and I would recommend the story to all
enthusiasts of Sci-fantasy. I only hope that Martin has plans to continue
the story line, as it was left open for a sequel using all or some of the
main characters. Nice work, Martin, I hope to see more of your writing.

    Folks you\'re missing the point.
    Ships need crews because even in the Imperium, perhaps Especially in the
Imperium, they don\'t trust robots or computers all that much.  The exact
specifics of the treaty/declaraion/agrement slip my mind but robots don\'t have
rights in the Imperium.  Heck, getting too high a percentage of your body
replaced with cybernetic parts can get you declaired a non-citizen AND and
non-sentient being.  The fellow who was complaining that the Robots book broke
the Traveller background missed the point as well.  Sure Robots can do all
these neat things but they\'re not allowed to BY LAW AND CUSTOM!

    These are much more powerful forces than people realize.  There are other
reasons too, things like insurance.  Piracy, imagine an all automated freighter
and the pirates show up with the override codes. ;) Legal issues as well, you
can\'t sue a computer for being misprogrammed but you CAN sue a pilot for making
a mistake.  Think of the passengers, do you really think you\'re going to get
passengers to board a starship with only a couple of robot stewards and total
computer control?

    Think of it this way, would YOU, personally, fly on an aircraft from say
Europe to America with NO ONE ON THE FLIGHT DECK!?!

    Humans are there to handle the situations the computers don\'t so well at.
They\'re also there to be blamed when things go wrong.  They\'re there to handle
the misjumps and all the other things that could go wrong but only rarely do.
Think about it. ;)

True. If the Zhos had attacked, the Domain would have gone down the toilet.

We don\'t know all that much about the other domains, but we do know that
the Domain of Deneb had its full complement of high-tech, high-population
worlds (It was generated with the standard system generation system, after
all  ;-). I know of no reason why the Domain of Deneb should be considered
very much behind the rest. The only difference I know of is that the
average tech level was slightly higher in the core sectors. Certainly the
Domain was not in any way behind their Vargr and Aslan neighbors. Rather
the other way around, actually. 

>Corridor and its fleet are gone, therefore reducing further the number

The Corridor ships were never available to defend Domain worlds on a day
to day basis.

>He couldnt risk exposing the Zhodani frontier back then so most ships

Now we\'re getting down to the nitty-gritty. Yes, as soon as Norris hears
of the Emperor\'s death, he starts massing ships along the Zho frontier
(Hmm... digression: A question just occurred to me: Does he send off the
orders the moment he hears or does he wait until he hears about it
officially?) He sends off most or all of the regular fleets. Does he
send off the subsector fleets too? Maybe, maybe not. I\'d say it would
depend on whether he thought the system defenses could protect the
planets on their own. After all, he\'s no Lucan. Most likely he\'d leave
at least a few colonial squadrons behind. Does he send off the planetary
defense forces? No, if for no other reason than because most of the PDFs
are non-jump capable. And he does one more thing: He starts reactivating
the mothballed reserve ships and speeds up his ship-building program.
Within three months he begins getting reinforcements by the fleet-full.
Literally. The most conservative estimate of the mothballed fleet is
equivalent to 50% of the active forces; a quite realistic estimate puts
it at 8 times the active forces.

>On the other hand there were massive iheiti (?) forces coming from
>Rimward, pushing into Domain territory and large vargr fleets from
>Coreward. Norris simply couldnt afford to defend everything.

What massive _Ihatei_ forces and what large Vargr fleets? The Aslan
_ihatei_ represent a very small fraction of the Aslan strength, and
likewise the Vargr raiders of the Vargr strength. And, more important,
the Aslans and the Vargr are divided into scores and hundreds of
different groups. You don\'t NEED very much to defend against the Vargr and
the Aslans. Take the Junidy defense forces. If they are locally built and
maintained at TL 9, then they have the equivalent of roughly 100 trillion
credit squadrons (No, that\'s not a misprint: one _hundred_ trillion credit
squadrons; 70% of the naval taxes of 28 billion people comes to 9.8 trillion
credits which will support 98 trillion credits worth of defenses. True, TL
9 ships are at something like a 100:1 disadvantage against TL 13 ships, but
that\'s a LOT of TL 9 ships. To match it a Vargr conqueror will have to mass
about 1 trillion credit worth of ships (And to actually conquer someone
without grivious losses you need about 5 or 6 to 1 odds). That\'s about 400
average sized Vargr corsair bands. Can you imagine 400 Vargr corsair bands
working together? I can\'t. And if the Junidans import TL 15 SDBs from
Rhylanor instead, they can only afford about one fifth as many, a mere 20
trillion credits worth, but then they would enjoy a 5 to 1 advantage over
TL 13 attackers... (OK, most likely the Junidan system defenses are mostly
locally produced, but they would be stupid not to have bought _some_ high-
tech ships.)

Norris dosen\'t even need enough strength to defeat the massed Aslan
_ihatei_; all he needs is enough to defeat any single Aslan clan. And
the Vargr are _pirates_ (Sorry, David ;-). They labor under the very
severe handicap that they don\'t just need to defeat the defenders, they
need to defeat them without losing too much of their own strength and
without destroying too much of the prey. Piracy is a business.

Anyway, now Norris has a heavily defended frontier where nothing happens
and a steady stream of reinforcements being reactivated when some super-
optimistic Vargr and Aslans start to move in on his flanks. How long do
you think it will take before he begins to divert the reinforcements to
the trouble spots? Long before he accepts that the Zhodani is not going
to attack at all (and it\'s going to take him a looong time to accept
that ;-) he will have sent _some_ forces to deal with the trouble. And
it dosen\'t take very much to deal with the trouble.

>Later, when the situation normalized, he must have realized that taking

Even granted that it would come to that (which I don\'t) this is simply
not the Norris I\'ve read about. He\'d feel a responsibility to the people
he\'d failed to defend in the first place and be all the more ready to
pay the cost of liberating them again.

Assuming that the Junidans have been stupid enough not to spend a small

Let us not forget that Junidy does have enough of an atmosphere that a
compressor mask is enough to allow a human to breathe (that is, after all,
the definition of a Type 3 atmosphere). Still, I agree that there might
have been a window for Vargr raids some time in 1117. But raids aren\'t
the same as conquest, is it?

Well, IF the Vargr had raided Junidy at all, it would have been over long
before 1120. There\'s a limit to how long Norris would keep ALL his ships
idling on a border where nothing happened. He may or may not have withdrawn
them all by 1120, but he would have diverted some a long time before that.
Especially considering the massive reinforcements he would have had by then
(some of them paid for by Junidy resources).

There\'s that too. And, as I said in another posting, Norris would also feel
responsible for their defense.

The treaty you\'re referring to are the Shushudam accords, after a \'bot was
used as an assassin.

I suspect that the Imperium found that there was no way to make sure that
Asomov\'s laws of robotics could ever be truly made perfectly enforceable.
That coupled with political pressure from unions and the like probably put
a real long term damper on the use of autonomous robots in the 3I.

There is a tendancy to see computers as the solution to all problems, a
global panacea. They aren\'t necessarily - an example I could cite is one
from a former work. At BNFL we manufactured uranium pellets in a thin
stainless steel can for use in reactors. Because the rod of fuel was a
composite of many smaller pellets it tended to bend. Straightening it to a
sufficient accuracy for use in a reactor required 2 men per shift hand
rolling the rods straight. It looked like ideal territory for automation,
but the two attempts to do so that I know of failed as the \'sophisticated\'
computer programs got locked into loops trying to roll the rods straight,
stopping the line. In the end, the technological solutions were abandoned
and manual labour resumed because it worked.

By analogy, IMTU I view jump operation (and the associated calculations) as
requiring a certain intuition from the human personnel that computers only
start to achieve at higher tech levels as the synaptic processors come in.
Until this happens a misjump is more likely with full automation.

   And now you know why they call it science-fiction.  My understanding of
the situation in Antarctica is that it would take more than the Ross Ice
Shelf giving way to cause that much damage.

   As it stands right now, Antarctica is a desert (hey Harold isn\'t ice
frozen water?)--it stays so cold there that there simply isn\'t much in the
way of precipitation.  One possible scenario could be that raising the
temperatures causes the ice to melt, thereby increasing humidity levels
(possible because of the higher temperatures), thereby causing a significant
percentage of the freed up water to be turned into new snow which will fall
back in place of the old ice and eventually turn back into new glaciers (a
lot would depend upon how fast the melt off was).

   Net result: we find stuff frozen in the old ice that was better left
there...but no floods in Amsterdam or Miami.

>Whatever. It\'s definitely not something *I* want to live through!

   We know through geological records that it (melting off of at some
portion of the polar ice caps) has happened at various times in Earth\'s
history without any interference from Mankind, it is it possible it will
happen again despite whatever measure we might take to prevent it.

   Land owners in certain sections of the Netherlands and Florida take
note--your property values may be decreasing sooner than you think....

Actually, I think a version of this last point is the best answer of all. 
Sure, computers, and robot brains could do the job just as well w/o a
living pilot.  They could have done so at TL 13 just as well as TL 15,
however, Imperial regulations state that every ship going into jump must
have a qualified pilot on board.  Both the scout service and the various
merchant pilot associations happily support this regulation since their
jobs would be in jeopardy if it was ever changed.  Given the Imperium has
had significant Vilani influence saying that some seemingly senseless
things are done purely because of tradition and legal statues no one has
changed makes perfect sense. 

I don\'t like inventing technological handwaves simply because Traveller
was first created before folks knew just how impressive computer could be,
such things very much break my suspension-of-disbelief in the game.
However, social cultural or political handwaves can be great fun, and can
have all sorts of other interesting ramifications.

Actually, getting it out fast enough _is_ a real problem.  Misjumps are
frequent.  Even so, there\'s just no way in hell I\'m going to use those drop
tanks.  And no, thank you: I\'d rather not refuel in gas giants.  And
pirates, ye gods! -- nah.  Enough of this.

Aw, come on.  Why berets?  I\'m so sure!  They\'re, like, sooooo three
thousand years ago.

The Sayat armed forces don\'t have uniforms per se, but these days it\'s
fashionable in the military "nests" to wear bowler hats.  Or maybe fedoras.
I\'m not sure yet.  Fawn-colored, or perhaps ecru.  Unfortunately, I
haven\'t been able to find one to fit the Sayat Barbie(tm) yet.

The Sayat wear high-tech running shoes.  Steel-toed, granted.  <insert

Yeah, yeah; same to you, but more of it.

Well, the problem is, that with level of psionics/magic/whatever my 
Acients have, they never had a drive to develop technology, or, to be 
more precise non-psi technology. And their psi tech is not working 
very well in deep space... 

(That\'s why they developed other races - as an experiment to create a 
race capable of  another approach - that is, with (almost) no psi 
abilities...)

	Speaking professionally, I feel much more comfortable with the
American concept. The autopilot software is only as good as the team
writing it, and they CANNOT predict all possible situations or
problems which may crop up. In my business we call that a Class III
anomaly. We have onboard software designed to respond to problems we
can anticipate and design for. Class III requires human intervention.

	Perfect example of an autopilot that performed exactly as designed
(reliable) but caused serious injury and property damage (unsafe):
Airbus took one of their prototypes to the Paris airshow. The
autopilot in this particular airplane was designed to detect
impending stall (airspeed too low), and automatically override the
pilot\'s throttle setting. The pilot was hotdogging and showing off,
flying the airplane extremely close to the ground and going as slow
as possible. After all, he knew the autopilot would automatically
pull him out of a stall.

	Guess what? When the designers created the autopilot, they
discovered the airplane couldn\'t be landed. After all, a landing is
basically a controlled stall at or near runway level. So they rewrote
the code, bypassing the stall protection at low altitude under the
assumption that it was a landing.

	Can you imagine the results? I\'ve seen the video footage as the
plane slowly descended, under complete control, right into the trees.
The computer system was reliable, but unsafe.

	Another example of the difference between American and European
philosophy, at least several years ago, is that the Europeans put the
machine ahead of the man. If the pilot tries to do something that\'s
out of the limits programmed it, he won\'t succeed. If the computer is
told that a Boeing 747 cannot pull more than 2Gs, it won\'t let the
pilot do it. I\'ve read of an incident on a transatlantic flight where
a 747 wound up in an inverted dive. The pilot completely ignored
Boeing\'s safety limits, and wound up bending the wings ... but the
plane and all aboard survived and landed safely.

	Thats not quite right. If we talk about the early 3I, we only have
	the Shushudam accord claiming that ARMED robots are not allowed in
	the 3I. This and the misstrust in robots after the exident, caused
	using robots on board to halt, until TL:13 was archived and new and
	more "intelligent" robots become available. Real fully automated
	ships are only possible at TL:17 and with virus, as this would need
	full intelligent computers.

	Intelligent computers would also raise the discussion about imperial
	citicenship (e.g. Strephon had opinions about changing citicenship
	for TL:16&17 computers build at Platon) and open an other can of
	worms like "robots unions" and "robots liberation movement". For
	this reason robots are limited in the 3I, to avoid this.

>     Think of it this way, would YOU, personally, fly on an aircraft from say
> Europe to America with NO ONE ON THE FLIGHT DECK!?!

	Certainly no - but in european AirBus the pilot only has to press
	the "I\'m not sleeping" botton any minute. So we have a similar
	situation. Take a look on discussion I had with using robots for
	my THUDDD design. Nobody disclaimed using a heavy cargo robot,
	but lots of people wondered about the maintenance robot and
	using a police robot (armed!) for 2nd steward.

It\'s very simple...
It isn\'t that it cannot be done, it just WON\'T be done.  While there is nothing
that technologically prevents such devices from operating, there are TONS of
reasons why they won\'t be used.

  As an ultimate weapon against starships, somebody invented a virus that could
be transmitted to enemy ships which would cause the computer to destroy the
enemy ship. This virus spread and mutated into various strains.  Some of which
do not destroy themselves.  This virus gained proto-sentience and took over
ships.  The virus then contaminate other ships it contacted which joined it.
Eventually, you\'ve got a fleet of ships that are under the control of infected
computers.

Please describe everything a person does regarding a jump, before, during, and
after the jump. My unfamiliarity with the process is obviously biasing me against
your opinion.

My current understanding of the process:
Travel to safe distance from Gravity wells (I understand this part)
Compute jump coordinate (I understand this part, Average Astrogation task)
Prepare jump drive (I\'m not sure what this entails)
Engage jump drive (Not sure about this too, Average Ship\'s Engineer task)
Travel through jumpspace (not at all sure what happens here, 6-8 days)
Emerge from jumpspace (I understand this part, arrive 100 diameters away)

As always, keep in mind that my message torp is a jump ONLY vehicle and does have a
human prepping it before jump and catching it at the other side. The autopilot only
runs things in jumpspace.

	A (very) abbreviated explanation:

1. In a Classic Traveller adventure (the name of which escapes me at
this moment) the characters eventually discover sentient silicon
lifeforms--living microchips.

2. The Imperium uses a descendent of these chips in what\'s intended
to be an impregnable transponder system. Since the chips are actually
aware, they don\'t just exchange codes with each other, they talk. The
idea is the chips can\'t fool each other. In order to facilitate this,
the transponders have complete access to the ships\' computer systems.

3. Dulinor kills Emperor Strephon and begins the Rebellion (either
that, or Strephon is having an anchovy-and-strulgarn-pizza-induced
nightmare).

4. One of the baddies, the Emperor Lucan (Strephon\'s son) initiates a
research project. Seems somebody has discovered a variant of the
chips which has learned to prey on other chips, and can actually
cause its prey to be reprogrammed--hence allowing reproduction (the
core principle of life...). Nifty idea, eh? The world\'s greatest
hacker! *Nothing* can keep it out, because it *is* the computer
itself, and actually learns at computer speeds! Say, let\'s program it
to be wildly destructive, so we can release it, infect our enemy\'s
ships, and have them commit suicide. Gee, we\'re having trouble
getting the controls put in so it doesn\'t attack our own ships. Sure
hope it doesn\'t get out yet ...

5. Dulinor\'s fleet invades the research station, and accidentally
lets Virus loose. The initial strain is highly destructive, and most
ships die before spreading it. Some strains last long enough to
infect other ships, and even learn to spread to other computer
systems. Say, planetary defense grids, fusion plant controllers,
environmental controls ...

6. With much of the known universe returned to the stone ages
courtesy of the loss of all information, power, and other aspects of
modern technology and economy, there are still ships roaming around
under Virus control, looking for further victims. Called Vampires
because, much like the mythical vampire, their victims become like
them, they occasionally band together--hence Vampire Fleets.

My own system does much the same, but unfortunately, can only set stelar
densities and allegiances on a subsector level.  I\'d be interested in
seeing how you work it...

I have heard it described thus: American aircraft designer\'s assume that if
the pilot is pulling back on the yoke _real_ hard, he wants to go up _real_
bad, and the control surfaces respond accordingly.

Boeing has a reputation for this sort of stuff, dating back to WWII, when
B-17s were put through some remarkable hoops. I keep running across rumors of
a pilot pulling an Immelman with a B-17, but have never found solid proof.

>Please describe everything a person does regarding a jump, before, during,
>and after the jump.

Here\'s a heretic\'s opinion...IMTU...

1.  The flight to the jump point.

    a.  The Astrogator uses the "Jump Bible" to determine the
        approximate volume of space from which the ship can jump to the
        desired destination, plots a course to that area and gives it to
        the Pilot.
        
    b.  The Pilot executes the course, correcting for an obstructions
        along the way.
        
    c.  While enroute the Astrogator runs calculations through the
        computer predetermining the "jump plot" and drive configurations
        for Engineering that will be needed.  After this is calculated
        he gives it to the Engineer, who begins to make preparations.
        
2.  Preparing for Jump.

    a.  The ship arrives in the jump point, a volume of space generally
        several light seconds in diameter.

    b.  The Engineer finishes configuring the drive and hull grid and
        charging capacitors with the required energy to initiate jump.

    c.  When everything is ready the Engineer sends the signal to the
        Captain, who has the Pilot align the ship parallel to the
        estimated line of jump, based on the Astrogator\'s plot.
        
3.  Imitating Jump.
    
    a.  The Captain orders "Grid up!"  The Engineer runs power through
        the lanthanum grid located, for protection, inside the hull of
        the ship.

    b.  As the grid expands through the hull out about 3 meters, a
        pattern of lines, shifting in color, appear on the hull.  This
        pattern of lines is caused from interaction between the hull
        material and the expanding field, and varies based on the type
        of material in the hull and the grid patterns used by different
        species, races and designs.  It takes about a minute for the
        field to expand to its maximum limit and stabilize.

    c.  When the Sensor Operator reports the field has stabilized the
        Captain orders "Prepare for jump."  Lights aboard the ship are
        dimmed signaling to crew and passengers transition to jump is
        eminent.  (Many people suffer from "jump sickness" during the
        first few hours in jump space with the worst symptoms occurring
        at the instant the ship "jumps."  The symptoms of jump sickness
        are dizziness, nausea, disorientation, headaches.  Severe cases
        can be disabilitating for up to a day, and some species have
        been known to die from the effects.  Giving the signal alerts
        people to prepare for the disorientation, and for serious cases
        to take medications of one kind or another.)

    d.  The Astrogator brings the forward Grav Sensor array fulling
        online displaying it within the Astrogation Tank.  At this point
        the tank is filled mostly with static.  He then reports, "Ready
        for jump."

    e.  The Captain orders, "Initiate Flow!"  The Pilot (or other bridge
        crewman) enters the command to flush the "jump fuel" through the
        injection ports located at the bow of the ship.  The hydrogen
        floods rapidly out ahead of the ship in a dome like shape.
        Hydrogen is used because it is the least complex form of matter
        and computational difficulties increase exponentially as the
        injection matter increases in complexity.  The best injection
        matter is absolutely pure H2.
        
    f.  The Sensor Operator waits for the critical density to be sensed
        at the bow of the ship and then switches the jump drive on,
        calling "Jump is hot!"  Capacitors, or more usually the power
        plant, sends power through the through the drive generating a
        gravitational pulse that rips open a *small* rift in space (a
        wormhole) that will last for 2 to 3 minutes.  To the outside
        world the ship disappears from normal space.
        
    g.  At this point the ship is committed to jump.  The wormhole will
        expand around the ship as most of the hydrogen is consumed
        forming a bubble constrained by the jump grid outside of normal
        space.  In roughly a week the ship will reenter normal space as
        the rift in space thins and collapses expelling the ship back
        into normal space. 
        
4.  Jump.

    a.  The Astrogator has roughly two minutes to complete the jump
        sequence.  So, as soon as the wormhole forms the Astrogator
        fires a Grav Sensor pulse from the forward sensor array.  The
        pulse is directly through the wormhole toward the *estimated*
        destination, and is designed to form a lens in the mouth of the
        wormhole.
        
    b.  Inside the Astrogation Tank gravitational sources located along
        the line of the pulse now show up as red dots amid the static.
        
    c.  The Astrogator displays the precalculated "jump plot" derived
        from calculations over the data on the tank as green dots.  He
        then rotates controls matching the actual red dots to the
        calculated green dots.  (As an aside, coordinates in jump space
        don\'t match those in normal space, and they drift over time.  A
        Jump Bible more than a year old will already be well on the way
        to being out of date, making "plotting" increasingly difficult.)
        
    d.  When the Astrogator has aligned the dots, insuring that his (and
        the computer\'s) previous calculations are valid he hits the Jump
        button, which causes the jump drive to discharge a second and
        more massive gravitational pulse along the jump line, this
        usually takes stored energy from capacitors.  If the Astrogator
        fails to fire the pulse during the critical period the rift will
        close and the ship will emerge at its current location in a week.
        If he fires the pulse without properly aligning the plot, the
        ship will emerge at some unpredictable point at some
        unpredictable time.
        
    e.  The discharge forms a tunnel from the ship to its destination,
        and the ship is pulled along behind the pulse through the
        wormhole toward its destination.  It moves past the lens
        instantaneously and is totally isolated and blind until the jump
        bubble collapses in about a week.  Theoretically, the ship has
        transferred location instantaneously to its destination, but
        won\'t emerge for a week.
        
5.  In Jump Space.

    a.  The Jump Drive and sensors can be shut down while in Jump Space.
    
    b.  The Jump Grid must be maintained to protect the ship within its
        bubble of normal space.  Any degrading of the field can lead to
        damage to the ship and/or its crew.  Failure of the field will
        cause the bubble of normalcy to totally collapse destroying the
        ship.
        
    c.  The Engineer monitors the power plant and the lanthanum grid,
        works on maneuver and jump drives, and anything else that needs
        maintenance or repair.
    
    d.  The Astrogator, Sensor Operator, and Pilot perform non bridge
        related duties, do maintenance, and pull "jump watches" on
        the bridge watching dead monitors and waiting for the first
        static to come up on the Astrogation Tank.
        
6.  On Emergence.

    a.  As the jump bubble begins to "thin" static begins to appear on
        the previously completely empty display of the Astrogation Tank.
        The appearance of static indicates that the ship will be
        emerging within a few hours, and by plotting the increase in
        static a good estimate of emergence can be predicted.  The
        prediction is usually good to within a 5 minute window.
        
    b.  Lights are again dimmed when the ship enters the Emergence
        Window, indicating return to normal space is eminent.  Just as
        the entry to jump space causes many people to suffer jump
        sickness, so does exit from jump space.
        
    c.  Bridge stations are manned.  Maneuver drives, sensors, and
        communications equipment is powered and primed.
        
    d.  The ship "breaks out" with a blinding flash of light as highly
        energized photons and more massive particles precede the ship
        into normal space.  This is the remains of any "jump fuel" that
        survived the jump inside the bubble or along the field boundary.
        
    e.  The ship resumes normal space operations.  The Sensor Operator
        and the Astrogator take readings determining the exact location
        of the ship.  The Communications Operator searches for system
        transponder signals.  After ascertaining location and calculating
        a course, the Pilot flies the ship to its in-system destination.
        
        
As I said, this is how it works in my Traveller Universe.  Because the ship
is isolated from sensors before the final ploting is down and because the
precalculated plot has to be adjusted at the moment of jump this isn\'t
something that can be completely automated.  If you want to automate it
IYTU, more power to you!

Sounds good to me (considering I\'ve never given it much thought).

Give this a shot for me and correct any misconceptions. 

Almost every ship has a maneuvre drive generating x number of G\'s. At
any time (with enough fuel) the ship can accelerate to a maximum of x
G\'s. Sometimes, because of circumstance, the ship will pull more than
it\'s rated G\'s. Any crew member can safely move about at 1G and possibly
2G\'s, but must be \'tied down\' at anything above that or get the stuffing
knocked out of him, and I think I\'ve seen here that \'man\' has
successfully withstood 18+/- G\'s in rocket sleds (don\'t quote me on
that  cause I don\'t know). My real question is, what would be the number
of G\'s pulled in an accelleration that will take you from zero to a
speed that will move you 3.26LY (up to roughly 19.56LY) away in 7+/-
days. Just a thought.

There was a plane crash over Panama, some years ago,  that  could
be relevant here.  The plane was traveling at night and the  crew
were relying on the artifical horizon and  compass  to  fly.  The
pilot noticed that the plane was banked slightly to the right and
adjusted  the  yoke  to  level  it  out.  Nothing  happened.   He
adjusted more.  Still nothing.  He held the  yoke  way  over  ...
then suddenly the plane was  steeply  banked  to  the  left.  The
pilot pulled over hard to the right ... at first  no  effect  ...
then the plane flipped back to  a  steep  right  bank.  This  was
repeated  a  few  more  times  until  the  plane  went  into   an
unrecoverable dive and crashed killing  all  onboard.  The  crash
investigation team found that, although there were  2  artificial
horizon instruments ... 1 was switched off and the  other  had  a
malfunction (it kept sticking).  The point is that the pilot  had
no external references  and  was  flying  purely  on  (defective)
instruments.  He never knew what his aircraft was  really  doing.
It was concluded that switching off the  2nd  artificial  horizon
was a pilot error which resulted in the crash.

Now some might argue that the crash was a result of a  mechanical
defect and that can crash a more automated aircraft, but it shows
that  in  some  situations  the  pilot  is  little  more  than  a
biological automaton simply following what his  instruments  tell
him to do.

I have personaly been in a number of  passenger  aitcraft  during
heavy turbulance and have to  say  I  felt  safest  in  a  highly
automated Airbus ...  ever  move  the  aircraft  made  felt  very
deliberate which is a reassuring feeling.

Yes, this is true and even the references about what engineers do seem to
portray their work as ocurring during starport stopovers.

If a robot can have a Engineer 1 skill and the same other attributes then
I\'d say you\'re right. But some tasks might require say INT and that might
be lacking in all robots but the most expensive ones.

everyone.  I\'ve been playing traveller since the original *Little Black
Books* ( boy, do I wish I still had them :(   !!! ).  I\'ve seen MT, and
played it some, TNE, didn\'t really care for it much, and now T4, a used
copy of which I just got about a month ago.  Nice to see Traveller
returning to its roots.  Anyway, I digress.  Having read the jump space
strings here, I\'m putting out for your collective (hmmmm, resistance is
futile, eh?) folding, spindling, and mutilating my version of jump space.
 Yeah, I know, its non-canon, but then again, I\'m a masochist, I like
being canon fodder  ;)


In the campaign I\'m presently putting together, the jump number of the
drive is indeed the number of parsecs a ship can cover in about a week,
with one key difference.  A ship in jump can continue to cover that
distance per week until it decides to drop out of jump.  So a jump one
tramp freighter can cover six parsecs in six weeks, with only one jump. 
Now, I know that changes the character of the game without something to
limit it, so here is the bad news.  Jump space is not as homogenous as
normal space, in terms of spacial densities, and so distances in jump
actually vary with time.  One major source of research funding is the
search for reliable systems and/or maps to take this into account.  At
any rate, the result is the longer you stay in jump space, the more off
course you tend to get.  Basically a cumulative mis-jump.  This effect
seems to be more time related than distance, so the jump 1 freighter
travelling 6 parsecs has more of a chance of being off course than the
jump 6 cruiser travelling the same path. 


 As for game mechanics, I\'ve expanded navigation to become n-space
navigation and j-space navigation.  I\'m not sure yet how I\'ll fit those
into the character creation, comments are much desired and welcome.  Once
in jump space, a j-space nav check must be made once a week (not
including the first week)  to make sure everything is ok.  Travel along a
well known course, say, the Spinward Main, gives a  positive modifier to
the task roll.  For each week greater than one, a negative modifier is
included.  Computer programs of known jump courses add a single positive
modifier, but are hard to come by, being difficult to make, and will cost
quite a bit.  Getting programs to red zones, and sensitive military sites
is even harder, if not impossible.  So, the jump 1 freighter will make 5
nav checks in six parsecs, while the jump 6 cruiser will make none.  I\'d
suggest that the GM make the check rolls, and not tell the navigators. 
If theyre crazy enough to try it, let them find out when they drop out
that theyre 5 parsecs off course.  The effects of failed rolls are
cumulative, with the first failure causing the ship to drop out in the
Oort Cloud of the destination, and each subsequent failure then putting
the ship 1 parsec off in a random direction (yes, even backwards).  So
our poor tramp freighter in jump space, makes no nav check the end of the
first week, passes his check the second week, passes his check the third
week, fails the check the fourth week (Oort Cloud), passes the fifth week
check, then fails the last check, the GM randomly places him in one of
the surrounding hexes, and the crew proceeds to barbecue the navigator
when they drop out to find nothing but empty space.  I hope they enough
low berths for everyone!  This allows players to get to places they might
not be able to otherwise, with some risk involved. 

 BTW, jump drives are a set of superconducting rings, which are charged (
they are also the capacitors ) when a high temperature plasma is blown
through them, sort of a large MHD generator.  These then discharge,
warping space to a point where a ship literally falls into jump space. 
Jump drives are, then, useless as power supplies, as they must charge and
discharge at a ferocious rate to get the entry into jump space to open. 
There are no jump bubbles, and two ships in jump have an astronomically
low chance of finding each other.  Dropping out of j-space is much
easier, as j-space is essentially a higher energy state of n-space, so
the ship is like an electron boosted to a higher energy level in an atom,
its easy to get it to fall back to its original state, so the residual
charge in the jump drive is all thats needed.  

OK, theres my 0.02 Cr worth, let me know what you think!  (G\'head! Shoot
me!  A fusion rifle never hur..uuuuurrrrkkkkkk!!!!!!)

I started reading your post ready to flinch/hit erase/blink etc to avoid
any monstrous heretical crackpot lunatic fringyness but nooo.

This was a very good post. Keep more stuff coming. Especially what the
different crew say to each other during the various phases (I\'ll use it,
shure bet).

One thing though; why do ships pour their displacement mass out the bow?

There is no "speed" associated with jumps. The ship exits this universe for
a week and arrives back in it about a week later. As there is no 1 to 1
correspondence between points in J-space and N-space there\'s no speed and
thus no mass singularities at c or relativistic weirdness nor acceleration
effects.

All this IMTU of course.

My favourite is the one at the start (p4) with the man in a raincoat with a
bag of belongings trudging through the rain. Lying by a cardboard box is a
homeless person with a sign \'Will work for food\'. Above him is the great
lie of the Imperial Sunburst painted on a wall with the words \'for the
people\'. The death of a dream and the harsh realities of the failing
Imperium.

Gulp! Haven\'t you read the FAQ (Virus being one of those things to avoid
here!).

Virus was an AI Superweapon that exploited the Transponder chips in
starships by mutating them and taking over the heavily interlinked computer
systems of Imperial flagged ships. It was intended to be a weapon that
could be used to peacefully disarm enemy ships but was inadvertantly
released by Dulinor (the Archduke who started the 2nd Civil War) during his
final assault on Core around 1129 BEFORE IT COULD BE CONTROLLED. Virus
spread through the interlinked communications and overran computer nets
everywhere, with homicidal results. The Imperium and all its neighbours
were effectively wiped out with Trillions of deaths.

Vampire is the term used in TNE to describe a ship controlled by Virus.
Vampire fleets are lots of suc ships. To learn more about the 2nd Civil War
try and find Survival Margin, which also discusses Virus.

Anyway, I think it\'s time to raise the black globes if Virus is the topic,

IMTU the jump field can fluctuate and the bubble can ripple which can
require remedial work by the crew. There is always one of the pilot,
astrogator or engineer on watch making sure that the jump drive is okay and
that the bubble is stable.

Jump space isn\'t normal space. The ship (in canon, the SOpM) tumbles slowly
into jump transition. Acceleration doesn\'t figure as the ship translates
from normal space to j-space which has different laws. It\'s not like the
Star Trek Warp Drive. If the ship remained in N-space the acceleration
would be impressive...

The game plays a lot like some Traveller adventures I\'ve been involved

selling high, and frequently getting "special" requests for rush cargos or

When you have enough money you can upgrade your ship in various ways, hire
"escorts" to get protection or more cargo space, or, once your ship is a

against the backdrop of a war between the "Confederation" (Earth and core

Starting here, all hands are off the torp. A timer or sensor signals the jump drive
to activate once the tender is clear.

Then the assumption I can make here is that you have no one man ships in your
traveller universe.  You apparently need constant supervision by trained personel.
Assume 8 hours per day max for a human, you\'d need at least 3 people.

The jump field ripple problem also appears to have some flaws that don\'t jive with
the mechanics of the game.  If these ripples did exist, then you\'d have to make
multiple tests during the course of a jump.  But you don\'t, its just one test (well
two, astrogation and ship\'s engineer).  It also means that you can affect your jump
bubble to come out in a different location/time.

Don\'t get me wrong, these torps require alot of hands on work, just not in
jumpspace.

"Scientists at Cornell University have built a guitar so small it could
fit inside a single human blood cell. The "nanoguitar,\'\' as its creators call it,
could actually be used to strum a tune-but only by someone with really small fingers.
Each of its six strings is only about 100 atoms wide, more than 2,000 times
smaller  than a human hair.  It takes something called an "atomic force
microscope\'\' to pluck its strings, but they resonate like a real guitar, according to
Harold  Craighead, professor of applied and engineering physics at Cornell. But
Elvis  would find it of little use because the sound is inaudible to the human
ear.  So  what good is it? 

Ultra-Mini Machines
Not much, at least as a musical instrument, Craighead admits, but it does 
show just how far scientists are reaching in their efforts to build ultra-small 
mechanical devices that could be useful in everything from telecommunications 
to biological research. 

The tiny guitar is the brainchild of Dustin Carr, a graduate student in
physics at Cornell.

"He is a guitarist, and his creativity sort of got the best of him,\'\'
Craighead says.

The device was built in the Cornell Nanofabrication Facility, one of two major 
U.S. centers that are leading the charge to develop extremely small electro-
mechanical devices. The other center is at Stanford University. 

Craighead says the guitar was just a fun way to advance the technology, but
he quickly adds that it was a "proper\'\' experiment because the strings of the
guitar really can be made to resonate. And that shows that the technology
can be used to manipulate and analyze events on a very, very small scale."

                    At an American Physical Society meeting earlier this

Grav charge is mass (kg) and the attracting force between two massive
bodies is (sometimes) called weight and should be measured in Newtons but
for historical reasons tend to also be measured in kg.

Electrostatic charge is measured in Coulombs and the attractive/repelling
force between two charged bodies is measured in Newton.

See the similarity?

Elite lacked Traveller feel but this one shure feels like Traveller. It has
a really nifty plug in system where you can plug in trade goods, weaponry,
graphics for the above, starsystems, missions, adventures etc. Just drop
them in a folder and off you go.

I never played Elite, but it *is* like an updated Megatraveller I (or II

Then why not settle on something more like standards:

Illustrator files (the standard in DTP), PDF (the standard in
crossplatform), Flash (the standard vector format on the web) or postscript
(the standard on UNIX).

I think the reason has to be technical rather than cultural as we se in
canon designs that all major races seem to have crewed ships. Vargr,
Aslans, K\'kree, Zhodani, Solomani, Vilani, Droyne etc.

It has to be a fundamental problem or maybe that those civs going for the
fully automated ship option never become great empires (go figure).

This is an interesting twist.  It does have several inmmportant effects
based on a few questions;

How much fuel does a J-1 ship travelling 6 parsecs consume?

Will two ships jumping together arrive at the same place at the same time?

How do military vessels behave; in other words, with all the resources
available to the military can the "dispersion effect" be corrected for?

The problem is one of background, not game mechanics.  With the ability to
insert a fleet of commerce raiders into the rear areas (so to speak) of the
enemy, the Fifth Frontier War will look much different, with desperate
defenses occurring in back areas to maintain the flow of supplies and
replacements to the "front".  Wandering bands of, say, Azhanti Class
cruisers in the backfield of the advancing Zho fleets would also be able to
raise havoc at will.

I don\'t think this is necessary.  N-space navigation is a bitch to do by
hand, but I bet a PC XT could do the math for vector based movement.
Navigation skill them becomes (1) Jump Space Navigation and (2) general
navigation principals for use when planetside and (3) principals of n-space
navigation.  Not really too much for one skill, considering the scope of
some others (i.e. Demolitions, Engineer, Electronics).

Again, fuel consumption may affect this problem greatly.

I like the "sound" of this handwave.  It does however, beg another
question; Can a ship drop out of jump at will?  This is not a big problem,
but has implications for some traveller type adventures (I\'ve always wanted
to do the "stuck in jumpspace knowing one of us is a killer" adventure -
oh, I have!)

>OK, theres my 0.02 Cr worth, let me know what you think!  (G\'head! Shoot

There are a lot of departures here, but if you don\'t care about the
Traveller Background too much, who cares.  Just remember that if its
possible for player characters, its probably easier/less risky for military
institutions and those with money to spend.

It\'s good to go to new places, but there are other ways to get them there.
And if you have a plot that needs the characters to misjump, manufacture a
drive malfunction.  Hey its a hackneyed plot device, but its overused
because it works!

Yes. This is much clearer now. Mass is like the strength of a magnetic field,while
weight is like the attractive force between two opposing poles of that

It would not surprise me.  ISTR on a PBS special about the 767 (I think)
that one of the test pilots at Boeing actually took a 747 into a
complete roll, and that the aircraft performed very well.

I\'m sitting about 3 miles from the Boeing (ex McDonnell-Douglas)
assembly line in St Louis.  There is a parking lot at the end of one of
the runways at Lambert field where you can park and watch them test
aircraft.

US Marines call their Drill Instructors Sir.  Army recruits call them Drill
Sergeants.

In the real Army, you call a NCO by his rank.  Sergeants, Staff Sergeants,
and Sergeants First Class are all just called Sergeant in casual
situations.  Master Sergeants, First Sergeants, and Sergeants Major are all
called by their complete ranks.  

Since I\'m not a Marine, I don\'t know what the protocol with regards to
calling them "Gunny."

A note on "sarge".  Despite Hollywood, most NCOs dislike the term sarge as
a shorthand version of rank.  I knew one Sergeant who accepted that title.
First Sergeants are sometimes referred to as Top Sergeant, or Top Dog
(Kick, wahtever.)

What NCOs are called behind their backs is another topic, one that I will
not share with the possibility of children reading this list.

I just checked mu topographic map, and raising the sea level 50m would put
about 70% of San Francisco under water.  I\'d be okay, since the hill I live

That\'s the point.  IMTU. the Imperial Marines take their lineage form the
Solomani Marines, who draw back to units of the Terran Confederation.
Specificaly, the 82nd Airborne Divison, the United States Marine Corps, and
the Royal Marines.  The maroon color, the beret, and the officer\'s cutlass
are all symbols of these lineage.

	[->]  I believe that the PE text says that resource trade
represents buying off of an interstellar commodities market that is
serviced by free traders and other private distribution systems.  Your
point is a good one, though.  The need to secure resources has
frequently been one of the primary motivating forces behind imperialism
( Japan is an excellent example ).  So perhaps a house rule could be
added which requires that resources be imported from a world where your
Empire has at least X level of influence, or you could trade for
resources with another Empire.

	[->]  Another good point.  How about this: for a world to grow
to or maintain Pop Code A,
	you must own/have X amount of influence over one agricultural
planet.  To grow to/maintain Pop code C, you must have 10 agricultural
planets.  You must have as many ag planets as planets with pop code A (
Eg: if my empire has 3 planets with pop code A and 1 with code B, I have
to maintain at least 13 agricultural worlds. )  If you ever fall below
the requisite number of ag worlds, there will be negative population
effects ( and probably negative popularity effects, too).  If your
Population reaches 9.999 billion and you don\'t specifically allocate an
ag. world to supply it, the population doesn\'t grow.  ( This doesn\'t
represent starvation, just rising food prices which lead to rising costs
of living, which lead people to start families later in life and have
fewer children.  There may be some popularity effects, though. )
	   Another possibility: trading for food resources.

Why assume 8 hour days?  Efficiency drops dramatically if you are
effectively on call all of the time, and you sleep in a half doze on the
bridge, but it can be done.  Further, if the events leading to a problem
start small and work large, then someone can snooze, and get woken when the
crisis seems real, making XBoats both grueling and hazardous.  A full crew
fixes problems before they are serious, while a skeleton crew is not able
to do that.

This is also why the standard Scout/Courier has a crew of two or four, so
the pilots/ etc. does not completely flip.  I also rule that the smaller
the ship, the less effort the fixes require.  Were a 1 ton jump field
possible, it would  be easier to automate.  On a big ship, there are a lot
of people working to keep the grid stable.

If the ripples are failures in your jump field, and these failures lead to
vessel destruction if not stopped, it can be explained.  The canonical idea
of a completely hands off drive has always seemed kind of silly, but the
idea that nothing outside the ship (known to TL <16 science, at least) can
affect a ship in jump can work.  As long as nothing the vessel does can
speed up the time, or change the destination, then you are fairly well
within canon limits.

Exactly how you implement that varies, and is the difficulty with some of
the info listed in the SOM.

NB, having a widget that must work, and that survival depends on is a good
plot hook, and explains just what those pilots/engineers/astrogators are
doing during that time.  The engineers maintain the box that the pilot uses
to fiddle with the field in accordance with the nav plan.

The same amount as it would consume in the canon rules.  The drive is
really only there to place the ship at a higher spacial energy level. 
Thus the J-1 places it at energy level 1, while a J-6 reaches to level 6.
 Once there the drive is shut down.  In fact, most of the hydrogen is not
fused, but used in the form of a drive plasma, which energizes the
J-drive.

>time?


It would seem reasonable that they would.  Just to add a twist, I might
have each ship\'s navigator include a station keeping task as well.  J
space is quite chaotic, and ships could be separated without warning by
quite a distance.  If the both tasks are failed, the ships will arrive
separated by some 1D6 x 5 Hrs.  If a large group of vessels enter J space
together, keeping up with each other will actually be easier, as they can
keep an eye on each other, though they will still tend to be strung out
when they drop out.  For groups of more than 5 ships, there is only a 1 %
chance that the group will get scattered.  Otherwise, when they drop out,
each ship is separated by 1D6 x 10 minutes.  Now, if ships do become
separated, they all have to continue nav checks, and if a series of
failures occurs, they whole group could end up scattered over parsecs of
distance.  Needless to say, most of the time, the risks of using long
jumps are not worth it.  Also, these station keeping problems are a small
scale effect of J space.  The broad scale problem of getting off course
by parsecs can still effect the whole fleet.  Groups get a modifier to
help with the task, and the best navigator in the fleet makes the roll.

Travelling in groups helps (see above), but the large scale dispersion is
still a problem.  The military would probably have some advantage in this
area, but it can still happen.

Quite true.  The dispersion problem will keep these commerce raiders from
banding together in large groups though, but then raiders work best in
small units anyway.  Also, even though you can jump into an enemies rear
areas, you still have the logistic problems, such as re-fueling in
hostile systems.  Expect to find lots of system defense boats in those
gas giants and oceans.

Actually, ships *can* drop out at will, the problem is, they better have
the fuel to jump again, or theyre not going anywhere fast.  If a ship
drops out, and has the fuel to jump again, the crew must make 1D6 x 5 Hrs
of astrogation observations to find out precisely where they are, before
they jump again.  If not, of if they are forced to jump to soon, they
suffer an automatic mis jump (by my rules, not the canon rules).  Once
again, they must make observations before a safe jump can be made.

The canon background is very good, so I hope no one out there takes all

I don\'t doubt it.  Assuming he started at 35,000 feet and dove first.  I play a
game called Warbirds that is a WWII air combat simulator that played by hundreds
of people on the internet at the same time.  I can do amazing things with the
B17.  Its not 100% accurate flight model yet, buts tis close.  they\'ve even
modelled things like propeller drag.  Anyway, you can find all sorts of similar
stories on comp.pc.ibm.games.flight-sim.

Ob traveller:  I bet some ships that aren\'t streamlined or designed for landing
and taking off a planet\'s surface could be forced to, if the manufacturer of the
space ship was good enough.

A great many of modern civilian passenger planes have reduced the pilot\'s
ability to get information about his plane from tactile senses, i.e., he
can\'t tell from holding the yoke exactly what his plane is doing.  Whether
its straining to whatever, stick moves.  I think its called "fly-by-wire"
with the stick\'s movements are converted into a signal that tells the servo
on the flap, etc., what to do.  The most recent design have gone back the
other way.  Many sticks on planes now have a "tickler" or a "trembler"
that shakes the stick, etc., to give the pilot tactile information about
the condition of his plane and its flight.  This essentially lets the pilot
takes his eyes off the sticks and instruments as long as he keeps his hand
on the stick because he will instantly feel any change in the plane\'s
aspect (speed, angle, etc.).  If the plane starts to go into stall, the
stick will shake at a more and more dramatic rate.  Once its in full stall,
and the pilot takes no action, it puts the plane into an automated dive to
generate speed then climbs and levels the plane, i.e., autopilot comes on.

Ob traveller:  Maybe at high TLs, you put a sensor on the pilot, on his
hand on his forehead, wherever.  Maybe even a cyberware datajack type
thing.  That will let the pilot sense exactly what the ship is doing, no
matter where he is on board.  At even higher levels, he wouldn\'t even need
to be in the pilots chair to fly the ship (theoretically anyway, that might
be heretical).

Whats even cooler, IMHO, is the fact that the Space Shuttle can land, and
apparently often does, on autopilot.  Thats amazing to me.

	An Immelman is much easier than a looping. The main problem with
	the Immelman in combat is that you can have problems with the
	maximum dive, if the other airplane sees you and also starting
	to dive. The Immelman is a SUPRISE attack from high position.

Ok by "canon rules" (CT and T4 being my choice to fit this term) a ship
consumes 10% of its tonnage for every parsec it travels.  I think you mean
to say that your ships consume 10% of their tonnage to achieve jumpspace,
but use no more than that in spite of the distance travelled in over a week
(in other words a J1 ship travelling at a "speed" of 1 parsec/week consumes
10% of its tonnage for fuel, even if it "stays" in jumpspace for 6 weeks).
Please let me know if this is wrong.

It also concerns me in the extreme examples; a J4 Xboat system could remain
in jump space just one extra week, cutting message travel times by half or

See, I don\'t think this is such a big deal.  Lets say you have a fleet of
ships; detroyers, battleships, troop transports, all set to invade, say,
Mora, all J-3.  They travel in J-space at J-1 for 12 weeks or so, beginning
at the Zho border.

They all emerge within three parsecs of their jump point (exactly where
doesn\'t matter as long as they are within 3) Refuel from the tankers they
brought along, and arrive at Mora a week later in strength that can bust up
any Impies that show their face, until the whole assault fleet way over in
Regina or Depot can be turned around and sent back to deal with them (of
course, they can use the same tactic).  Now, this tactic could work a
little worse in the canon traveller universe, but the logistics are quite a
bit easier your way.

Likewise the fleet, when finally confronted, could jump *back* to a
sufficiently dense area of Zho space and all get recovered in 12 more
weeks.  So the trip is not one-way by any means (and they leave behind the
shattered wreck of what was a major industrial world).

If they object, screw em!  Your game, your universe.  Most of the people on
this list (who are actually playing) are using a variant of Traveller
ranging from a few misplaced nobles here and there to a full blown, home
made task system, travel by jump gates, million ton free traders,
completely revamped background, etc. etc.  Some people even use (shudder)
TNE!  I even saw a thread about using Traveller to play in the D&D type
background!  (and here I am going to play D&D tonight!).

Just remember, if you decide to publish, or even just share materials with
the world a few of these things could be "broken" for other campaigns or
canon rules users.

   There are several places that you can go for info on the New Era setting.
One is Joe Heck\'s Web site (http://www.missouri.edu/~ccjoe/traveller/).  I
would also highly recommend the BARD pages
(http://www.chara.gsu.edu/~lewis/bard.html/) and Chris Griffen\'s site
(http://www.cris.com/~Cgriffen/traveller/deneb.shtml)--there are of course
many other good sites, but those two have links to most of them.  

   There is also a TNE mailing list, where questions regarding the New Era
and its setting are discussed on a regular basis.  Send a message
\'subscribe\' to listproc@tower.ml.org.  For help, send a message \'help\' to
the same location.

Your right that an Immelman is not a loop.  Its more accurately described as a half
loop.
For those interested who don\'t know, an Immelman is an air combat manuever in which
you pull up as if you\'re starting a loop.  At the top of the loop you eventually
end up inverted (upside down) so you roll the plane 180 degreess so that you\'re
rightside up.  Now you are going the opposite direction but at a higher altitude.
This puts you at a higher energy state (energy being potential and kinetic, i.e.,
altitude and speed).  Strictly speaking, no dive is necessary.  The move is
complete when you\'ve finished rolling to rightside up.  Although, it puts you in a
better position to make an attack.

Its not really a surprise manuever.  Its a way to get to higher altitude and change
direction at the same time.  If you\'ve got suprise, there is little point in using
it.  If the enemy doesn\'t see you, lag pursuit from the opponent\'s low 6 position
(behind and below) is ideal, because he can\'t see you.  An immelman will make you
more visible.  Its best when you already have greater speed than your opponent but
need altitude, preferably you also have a plane that is a better climber.

Ob traveller, are there any rules for non-space air combat?   Or atmosphere combat
with starships both airframe and streamlined?

Hmmm..

A but extreme a measure, I believe. Unless it was humor.

I play *canon* but just a different version of *canon*, ie MegaTraveller.

Besides Loren\'s working for the only company right know that has the
ablility, money, will and resources to publish a Traveller Line(Yes it is
GURPS). 

IG is *Dead In The Water*, only time will tell if IG joins the Titanic at
the bottom, or gets underway again. I Believe the former is the most likely
event.

Movies. I was standing in the bar at the local, waiting for the ladies to 
appear (ladies night in the middle east, more men than women, but that\'s what 
the hotels are after - after all, the men spend the money) when my attention 
was grabbed by a trailer for a movie on the satellite channel. Seemed to be 
just a.n.other post-apocalyptic story,  USA in early 21st century, horses + 
M16\'s. But wait. Isn\'t that Kevin Costner?

It is. And what\'s the movie? THE POSTMAN. I guess that this would be an 
adaptation of David Brin\'s classic SF novel, but I hadn\'t even heard that it 
was being filmed. Ah, me. This is what you get from living in the backwaters of 
the West.

If that was all, I  wouldn\'t have send this mail. But the Kostner was only a 
treiler for an upcoming event. The actual movie that was about to be shown was 
HBO\'s adaptation of Robert Harris\' FATHERLAND. Yet another movie that I would 
never have expected to have been made. It was in a pub, so I couldn\'t hear the 
sound track over the music, but...

What? How is this ObTrav? Well.... Postman is somewhat ObHard Times, more 
nearly ObTW:2000 (Howling Wilderness), really. But Fatherland is classic 
Traveller. There\'s Adolf (Charismatic Dictator if ever there was one) and the 
power struggle between Goebels (not very charismatic) and Heydrich (even less 
so). Can you spell POLITICAL INTRIGUE ON BALKANISED WORLD? I thought so.

So  can anyone give me an opinion on the value of these two movies? (don\'t 
bother disputing the books - I already know how much I like them - which is 
quite a lot).

Hee! Hee! Fooled you, eh? ;->  Generally, my take on Jump Drive is
reasonable standard. I\'m in the "injection mass" school, so that brands
me heretic by the "fuse it all!" school, and I didn\'t get into
stutterjumps, ftl gravitons, and vacuum tube electronic components. And,
of course, I can get behind some *real* heretical hyperspace type drives
for alternate universes.  ;->  For Traveller, though, I stick with a
pretty standard jump drive.

I\'ll try to find an old post I sent to my PBEM players that had slang
used by spacers. The slang had been developed in a game, heck almost 20
years ago now, and I don\'t want my players to *use* it, but to develop
their own.

> One thing though; why do ships pour their displacement mass out the bow?

There are three reasons ships do it that way IMTU. First, they use a
portion of it to form the lens in the mouth of the wormhole. Without the
lens the sensors can\'t resolve the distant gravitational sources and the
Astrogator can\'t lock onto the destination. If he can\'t lock onto the
destination you\'re going to get a misjump.  Second, the injection mass
forms the "wormhole" in front of the ship and the ship is pulled through
it by a grav pulse. Third, I was sick of putting all the engines in the
rear and wanted to throw in some puller technology to counterbalance the
pusher we already had. ;-> 

BTW, I didn\'t mention that IMTU jump drives are a refinement of
stl-stutterwarp technology. The stutters displace matter forward by a
short distance instantaniously, with a TIJ (time in jump) measured in
fermo-seconds. However, you can\'t get pseudo-velocity above about 5% of
c at the TL\'s players are likely to run across. The injection of mass
changes the dynamic, giving an instantanious displacement of light
years, but with a TIJ of about a week. 

The reason injection mass is 10% of volume because you need to form a
rift large enough to encapsulate the ship and form a tunnel to the
destination. Ten percent, approximately, does it for 1 parsec. Use much
less and you either don\'t get the rift big enough (leaving part of the
ship behind when you encapsulate the ship), or don\'t make it to your
destination (causing an unpredictible misjump not a partial transfer).

Nope. It was originally written in the UK on the BBC Model B produced by
Acorn Computing.

    Only in boot camp do the DI\'s get called "Sir."  After completing the
crucible my DIs were rather... convincing in getting us to call them by rank
(habits die hard).
    One poor recruit mistakenly called a DI "Drill Sergeant" when I was in
boot.  That really got under their skin and at Ft Knox, I saw why.  I was
harder than most of the Drill Sergeants I saw there (I even saw a Drill
Sergeant,while wearing his smokey, mowing the lawn. I couldn\'t stop laughing
when I saw that. It\'d be a cold day in hell a DI would be mowing the lawn at
MCRD) to say nothing of certain scandals... 
   Marine DIs really pride themselves on being "the best 10%" of the Marine
Corps.

That\'s only for the Army.  For a Marine, only Sergeants are called Sergeant.
Call a Staff Sergeant or Gunny "Sergeant" and you\'re going to wish u didn\'t.

>Since I\'m not a Marine, I don\'t know what the protocol with regards to

Generally, it\'s only Gunnery Sergeants you know who you\'ll dare to call Gunny
unless u outrank them, in which case you can pretty much dare it. : )

Sometimes Marine First Sergeants take "First Shirt" but some don\'t like it at
all.  We call Master Sergeants "Top." Master Gunnery Sergeants (E9) sometimes
take either "Top" or "Master Guns," but again only w/ his approval (usually
he\'ll correct you with the "familiar" version if it he wants it).

Good point. : )  I\'ll keep my silence as well.

What you want is Survival Margin.  Details the length of the Rebellion in TNS
entries and then goes into some prose about the subject.  the IG website has
some as does Vanya\'s "Not the IG" website.

	Not quite right, as long as you are refering to WWI before Richthofen

	make it with an Albatros. You\'ll dive towards the other vessel

	While MT killed Strephon (or is he still held in prison by a

This a) doesn\'t quite work and b) the Xboat network isn\'t your only problem.

Even if this worked for the Imperium, you still would have to explain why
such things are used for communication in the myriad of worlds that exist
outside of the Imperium (particularly those who aren\'t big enough to afford
a jump boat network but could afford an automatic message carrier).

Also, beyond the x-boat network, you have to explain why automatic jump
isn\'t used for _any_ other purpose.

There is only one *canon*.  Each of our own Traveller universes will differ
w/o saying but there can be only one *canon.*   The "official" *canon*
storyline, confirmed by Marc, says that the Rebellion and Collapse happen.
Thus anyone wanting to do something *official* set in 1201 will be in the
corpse of the Third Imperium (or an heir, the Regency).   Nothing wrong w/ not
being offical... how many of us are would-be game designers?  
     Where any of our own campaigns differ from Officialdom (tm), they are
"alternate."  Though the whole concept of GURPS Traveller still leaves a bad
taste in my mouth (i don\'t like GURPS rules and I absolutely abhore the
precedent of the setting), it belongs on this list as much as Virus.  
     The point of the FAQ is to avoid flame wars about the feasability of
Virus.  Mentioning Virus (especially describing it in response to a question
about it) is certainly proper, IMO.  I would just think that noone really has
a write to make a public post then bashing it to the newbie. (if someone wants
to do it via private email, fine).

	Technical true and I think most societies had their Shadusham,
	Kinunir and similar ideas of replacing the unreliable human with
	a reliable computer. And they failed all for the same reason. 

> Also, beyond the x-boat network, you have to explain why automatic jump

	Think about Kinunir, next think about Virus. Any computer able
	to completely replace a human, has to be real intelligent, and
	as intelligent computers are a freak occurance before the parent
	strain, they are likely to become insane. ;-(

	And even my sandbox handwaving, the Rurevayn pocket va^h^hempire,
	has more than one savety net for preventing, that an insane computer
	controls a ship. The first savety is of course the parent
	strain. Not only that new infects are mixed from two codes (like
	in biology) the new child also has its childhood of 3-4 terms
	before it gains control over anything exept toys.  Second
	the human transponder. Any ship has still to carry at least 3
	humans. A communication officer, a security officer, and a body
	swap.  They also serve as an index that the controling computer
	is still sane, and they have the key to arm/disarm the weapons
	of the ship. (*)

	Any communication between ships or ports is using the communication
	officiers. They have to check that the one on other side of
	"cyberspace" is realy a human. This is similar to the imperial
	transponder, who was intelligent and checked if the other side
	is a transponder. Before a ship is now allowed to visit a
	starport, it has to "body swap" with a ship of system defense.
	So you have to invite somebody from system defense who\'s looking
	that anything is still fine on your ship (the human crew still
	alive) and you\'ll send one to look at the SDB for the same. If
	you contact a vessel around Rurevayn not opening a radio chanel
	just for joking around and a check if you are have human humor,
	and later (perhaps hours) asks for bodyswap, but sending an
	imperial transponder, its best to chrash start the jump drive,
	or to ask for a volley of PAD missiles ;-)

	(*) Most vampires also think that uninfected fire controls and
	male humans are more effective because of their known agression.
	As biomeat is also known to be a better trader, and to fullfill
	certain other functions cheaper or more effective, the actual
	crew reduction of most "vampires" is only 1 to 3 quarters compared
	with imperial full automatisation. While Rurevayn does\'nt show
	the full automated X-Boat, it shows ships comparable to modern
	see freighters, 3000dt with a human crew of 5 to 9.

Elite was originally on the "BBC Micro" in Great Britain, if my gaming

Well TNE and T4 also invalidated MT *Canon*, but T4 invalidated more MT
*canon* than TNE. 

It was stated from the beginning that GURPS Traveller would not have the
Emperor dead or the *Infamous* much disputed AI(Anally Inverted) Virus
either. But I liked the AI Virus but not for a game *kludge* but as
*interesting* new life form with all of the aspects of a life form. I had
some players that were playing in Campaign by being Agents of the AI Virus,
fighting against the grave robbing, land grabbing, government overthrowing,
Viking styled planet conquerors. It was a most enjoyable campaign. The
players had different levels of cyberwear/biowear to assist them in their
tasks.

This is like trying to put the blame on one person on the sinking of the
Titanic. The *Killing of Traveller* is best described as a *Comedy of
Errors*. 

One note Strephon was not killed just a *Clone*, the Real Strephon I
believe his passing was not well chronicled in the sources, but that is
more than like a memory lapse on my part.<G>

Well lets see some of the authors they want to less than 50% of the
original *negotiated* price, but are selling a full price!!! Sounds like a
good deal only for IG. 

If the word got out that Traveller from IG was defunct, how many of that
stock would they be able to sell?, and at what price? Not very much and at
a severely *discounted* price.

I would be happier if IG was not publishing anything Traveller, but I was
not asked either.<G>

GURPS is a system that has its flaws, but it is going to be around for a
lot longer than IG will be.
If your are very, very brave/stupid/naive go to the GURPS list and bash it
there. The have some *Stellar* class flamers there, maybe more than here.

I strongly disagree, Traveller 4 has three *canon* ship/vehicle design
systems, most of them not compatible with each other. The way I see it
there is CT Canon, MT Canon, TNE Canon, T4/T4.1 Canon, and soon to be GURPS
Traveller Canon. That makes for 5 versions of *Canon* , not one version. 

As for what Marc said about the future time line of circa 1100/1200, he
will change his mind several times about those developments. Those future
changes will not make the majority here, very happy at all. At the current
time line of products being produced/worked on, it will past the year 2000,
before the time line of 1100/1200 is seen by us.

That is why I am currently working on a campaign set in the Astron sector,
be a long time before it gets touched by *canon* stamp.

Back a few months ago, I started a pretty hefty thread when I asked why
people on the list were so conservative when it came to technology.  I was
confused as to why people resisted (or left out) certain concepts in
science so hardcore.  AI was one of those.

What I was really getting at is why create such intricate handwaves as to
why certain technologies were unusable when instead it would be much easier
to just fit them in and change the things that needed changing in the
history and culture of the Imperium.

There really seems to be no reason to stick a person into an Xboat, plain
and simple.  What purpose does the scout in question serve?  What can he
do?  Jump can\'t be changed once you start it, so you have to do the
astrographic calculations beforehand.  So you\'ve got this guy that sucks up
a little over a week\'s worth of life support that is so cramped he can\'t
really do much of anything.

Would the scout\'s union really fight that hard so that their members could
go through such a hell?  Who would want such a crap job?  Realistically,
the scout\'s union would probably fight to get rid of such a torture, not
perpetuate it.

Scout astrogators would still have the job of doing the "intuitive"
astrographic work, upload it to the Xboat, and then be able to perform
other jobs for the scout service that make more sense for a human to do. 
Basically, it seems like the human on board does nothing at all.  It has no
effect on adventures (unless you\'re running an "Xboat Scout" campaign for a
friend who\'s really into hearing descriptions of a cramped ship\'s
interior).

So automate the damned things.  The Xboat network is Canon, with a big C. 
That means that the Xboat network is important to a 3I campaign and
shouldn\'t be changed lest you lose the flavor of Traveller.  That\'s fine. 
A manned Xboat is canon with a small c.  Someone came up with it (I think
in this case Marc Miller?), it seemed like a good idea at the time, but it
doesn\'t hold up just 20 years later.  There\'s nothing wrong with that.  An
unmanned Xboat screws up no other Canon in the Traveller universe.

Free Traders will still be crewed by sentient lifeforms because they need
personal, human contact.  They need to land, talk to brokers, talk to other
merchants, whatever.  Unmanned Xboats don\'t threaten this Canon because you
still need a human astrogator to do the "intuitive" work that sentients
tend to be good at.  You can still have a human pilot to do the "intuitive"
piloting work, and a human engineer to do the "intuitive" engineering work.
 Scout ships would be crewed by "people" for many of the same reasons.

Maybe some of the big megacorporations do actually use robotic cargo ships.
 Again, this doesn\'t invalidate any sort of Canon.  Everything else is left
untouched, now, some megacorps use big automated cargo ships.  Free Traders
will still be crewed by humans, Scout ships will still be crewed by humans,
war ships would still be crewed by humans because, yes, there will be times
when that "human" magic will be needed in these types of ships.

This is really a question of canon vs. Canon.  "Canon" is pure and requires
no handwaves.  It makes sense to everyone at the gaming table.  "canon", on
the other hand, is fine, as long as it doesn\'t require layers and layers of
face-cooling handwaving just to protect a single paragraph in an
out-of-print book.

    'body' => 'Grand Unified Jump Theory
Why does it take one week?
Canon states that jump drives don\'t function well within gravity wells.
My theory is that even outside 100 diameters there is some miniscule gravity from the sun
(otherwise planets would go flying off into space). Velocity in jumpspace is inversely proportional
to gravity. Thus, when you jump, the vast amount of the time is spent in system.  The jump drive
sends you through J-space on a hyperbolic velocity curve which is relatively slow in-system while
infinitely fast in true zero gravity.  So, the vast distance between stars is covered almost instantly
(at almost infinite speed), but it takes about a week to get to that speed and back again.

Why the +/- 1 day?
Planetary alignment.  If your desired destination is on the opposite side of the star, you need to
spend more time in low velocity in-system travel.  If both departure and arrival planets are in line,
you don\'t have as much low velocity travel.  Implication:  If you know the rotational speed of the
systems you can figure out the actual time rather than rolling it randomly.  Also rapidly jumping
between two systems should produce the same time in jump until the planets move significantly.

What about misjumps?
+/- 2 misjump: Same story but worse/better.
Catastrophic failure: Same story but you drop out of J-space really far away
Aggravated failure (d6 dice parsecs distant):  You screwed the pooch this time.  You lost your
way in J-space and went blasting through J-space blind at near infinite velocity (taking no time).
Fortunately,  enough stellar matter and background gravity has slowed you down.  Now you can
drop out of J-space completely lost.
Implication: Jumping into an empty hex would take half the time. i.e. half a week getting out of  a
system, but no time to re-enter a system gravity well.  However, this is extremely difficult
because you spend ~0 time in ~0 gravity.  Timing is crucial, and forget about rendezvous unless
there\'s a gravitic beacon.

How is jump fuel used?
Hydrogen is used for its simple structure. The hydrogen is broken down into electrons, positrons
and neutrons.  The Lanthanum grid has the property of breaking loose the positrons from the
protons yeilding spare neutrons.

The electrons are sent through N-space using the electron tunneling effect (handwave) which act
as a guide rail for the ship travelling through J-space.

The positrons surround the ship in a cloud which appears as a flash in N-space when the
photons are released from the positron/neutron decay (technobabble).  Some of the Neutrons
can be shed at the begining of the jump, the rest being absorbed into the Lanthanum grid.  The
more Neutrons shed the more efficient the jump is.  Thus more advanced jump drives dump more
neutrons it can shed at the jump entry.  Remaining neutrons must be 
retained until exit from
jumpspace. A J0 in-system only ship doesn\'t dump any of its neutrons 
until it leaves J-space
while a J6 ship dumps them all before jump (which explains the 6 parsec 
upper limit on jump
drives).
Implication: Neutron dumps can be detected, indicating a ship has just 
jumped out of system.
Neutron sensors can likewise detect ships entering systems by their 
neutron waste.

The Positron cloud then pulls the ship through the electron tunnel, 
mutually anhilating the
particles as it moves through J-space.


Why so much fuel?
The fuel has to construct a tunnel of electrons capable of holding the 
volume of the ship and
extending the distance travelled.  It also needs an appropriate amount 
of positrons to draw it
through J-space.
Implication: Using unrefined fuel makes malformed tunnels which could 
result in misjumping.

Well, that wouldn\'t be a jump drive. There\'s no acceleration involved
there, just displacement from one location to another.

I won\'t ever hazard a guess at the number of g\'s of acceleration you\'d need
to cover a parsec in a week.

Ok, I\'ve seen that sort of effect in several books. Crews will want to

You are going to allow navigation *in* j-space?  If you are doing that, why
don\'t you just go to a hyperspace, or a subspace system?

You\'ve got a potential problem there.  If you produce giagantic amounts of
energy in bursts, then you could use the same technique to power big energy
weapons the same way...or at least inventive players will probably try it.

It really *does* sound like some sort of subspace environment.  Nothing
wrong with that, of course. Sounds like a good plan. Let us know how it
works out.

The difference being that Loren and the rest of us can discuss aspects of

This is one of the rules that PE has that IMO sucks. The reason is that all
those resources have to have a buyer *somewhere*, and that buyer has to get
from there to here. And if they will take resources off us, why wont they
bring finished goods ?

The solution in my book is to only allow resource trade between worlds with
relationship code 7 or better (ie those in a trading relationship), and
every point of resources exported must be match by another world importing
a point of resources.

Nope, the pop growth system doesnt work like this. The pop growth rules are
one of the most wonderfully subtle rules I have ever seen in a game system.

Imagine a world with a D starport type 7 atmosphere, tech and resources of
8 and infrastructure and population of three - a new colony, on a kinda OK
but not spectacular world. On average, it\'s pop change factor will be (3.5
+ 8 + 8 + 3 ) / (2 + 1), or 7 - a 6% change in population. The D starport
halves this, so on average, the pop will grow by 3% a year.

Lets fast-forward a hundred years. The world now has a population in the
millions (fac 6), a C starport, a TL of 10 and infrastructure of 9. The pop
change factor is now (3.5 + 10 + 9 + 8) / (5 +1) or 5 - on average, 2%
growth a year. It isnt modified further, because of the C starport.

Now lets fast-forward another century. The world is now at TL 10,
infrastructure 10 and has a population in the hundreds of millions. It\'s
pop change factor is now (3.5 + 10 + 10 + 8 ) / (7+1) or 4. Pop change
factor is four ... 1% growth. 

Now lets fast forward another century - the world is now TL10,
Infrastructure 10 and population 9. Pop change factor is now (3.5 + 10 + 10
+ 8) / (8+1), or 3. Population growth on average in now zero. Our planet
has reached it\'s sustainable level of population, given the ruling TL and
infrastructure.

OK. Lets pick another world. Pop A, starport A, TL11, infrastructure 11,
resources 9. On average, it\'s pop change factor will be (3.5 + 11 + 11 + 9)
/ (9+1), or 3. Population is stable in the tens of millions.

The Long Night rears it\'s ugly head, and the world gets raided by those
pesky Vargr, who figure that widespread use of nukes will confuse and
demoralise the defenders. World suddenly gets a B starport, TL 10 and
infrastructure of 6.

Pop change factor is now (3.5 + 10 + 6 + 8 ) / (9+1), or 3. Bad years, in
which a 1 or 2 is rolled, will have a factor of 2, which means a loss of 2%
of the population - B starport doubles change in population. Unless the
world fixes it\'s damaged infrastructure, it will slowly lose population,
until it falls to pop code 9, which will make the dividing factor 9 rather
than 10 and thus stem the decline.

Note the driving factors - the resources, technology and infrastructure of
the world (it\'s "wealth"), as compared to it\'s current population.

Personally, I tweak the system by adding a quarter of  the Infrastructure
Atmosphere Modifier to the labour factor - this gives the insidiousness or
otherwise of the local atmosphere a direct effect on population growth, as
opposed to the indirect effect of making infrastructure development slower
and more expensive. It also slows down population growth somewhat, which is
good - otherwise too many worlds gradually drift up to pop 9 or 10.

In short, the pop growth rules are part of what makes Pocket Empires the
great supplement it is.

Yet I designed a variant where the Virus was just that.  A bioweapon.
Planets that were infected suffered a 75% dieback rate.  World shut
themselves off, destroying all incoming starships.  In 1201, A small
commonality of worlds, with Hiver assitance, developed a vaccine.  The new
era had begun.

When playing in my universe, I\'d stick fairly close to TNE canon regarding
the RC, Regency, even the concept of Vampire ships (In this universe they
are Reavers, quasi-religious survivors of the Plague that are determined to
destroy all remaining starships as tools of the devil.  Since they believe
they are doomed to Hell already, they are nasty opponents.)

How canon is this then?  A Dead Imperium, ravaged worlds, but a different
vector for that destruction.

That\'s right!  And if you *dare* play a Rebellion Era, or New Era game, the
Game Geatapo will hunt you down and grag you off to the Gamer Gulag!  Obey!

Look up the word "alternate."  The timeline for G:T is a seperate line from
the line where Strephons clone realizes that he made a career mistake.

Ah.  This would be by publishing full page ads, running an active website,
and publishing well researched books set in the Classic Era, which remains
by far the most popular era for play.

This is an odd definition of "killing."

I, along with many of the other people suckered into writing for IG, would
be happy if they paid *any* of us without us having to resort to repeated
long distance phone calls, threats of legal action, and invocation of the
Elder Gods!  I have reached the point where my efforts to recover the money
owed me is costing me more than I could ever hope to get.  Steve Jackson
pays his writers well, and on time.  Also, Pyramid magazine is now
accepting articles both for GURPS Traveller *and* any edition of
Traveller.. Classic, Mega, TNE, or T$.

Your right.  But since you have publically declared that you won\'t buy the

Traveller material, where do you get off announcing that SJG is destroying
Traveller?

  If natural mechanisms are going to cause such, it\'s difficult to see
how we could stop it, even if we identified the synergies involved.
Within a century some control should be possible, if not practical.

  Forget 50 or 60 meter rises (I still haven\'t found figures for the

In the NZ Army our NCO ranks how they\'re addressed goes something like this:

Private                "Private" or "Private <sirmane>"
Lance Corporal         "Corporal" or "Lance Corporal" if you\'re of higher
rank (esp. if you\'re a full Corporal).
Corporal               "Corporal"
Sergeant               "Sergeant" never "Sarge" unless you\'re on very good
terms, he doesn\'t mind, and you\'re both off duty.
Staff Sergeant         "Staff" calling them "Sergeant" is very, very stupid.
WO1                    "Sergeant Major", or "Sarn\'t Major"
WO2                    "Sir"

Technically only a WO1 who is actually a CSM (Company Sergeant Major)
should be called "Sergeant Major", but custom prevails (besides nobody
knows what else to call them).

BTW I can\'t recall for certain whether a Sergeant Major is a WO1 or a WO2,
most enlisted men aren\'t sure either, because it practically never comes up
in conversation as NCOs that close to God are referred to by their
appointments as a rule. For example "the CSM" or "the RSM".

My take is that in the Imperium there is a law stating that every ship
going into jump must carry at least one living, sentient pilot. 

Outside the Imperium, whose to say they aren\'t using automated ships for
some purposes.  The K\'Kree are fairly low tech, the Aslan would only use
them for very limited purposes, and automated ships doesn\'t sound much
like a Zho thing, but the Hivers and some of the Solomani would likely use
this sort of thing a lot. 

However, if you limit jumps ships to a minimum size of 100 Dt, tiny
message torps aren\'t possible, so you\'ll almost always have room for a
pilot on any ship.  I\'d expect them to be special use items most of the
time.  OTOH, having a normal ship with a robotic pilot might be more
common, especially in Hiver areas, or on Aslan ships w/o the proper gender
balance of crew. 

I don\'t see anything about my idea which either violates canon, or causes
any problems.  It also makes visits to non-Imperial space more
interesting:  "You mean no one is piloting this ship!" "But we have an
excellent robotic pilot."  "Your trusting *my* life to a *robot*!"...

What the FAQ says is to try and avoid several topics if possible as they
can create a flamefest. Namely Near-C rocks, Feudal Technocracies and
Virus... Probably Pirates and the viability of fighters should be added to
that. However, I haven\'t seen any of the first three trigger a flame war in
a long time... ;-)

Fundamentally, although I don\'t play(*) TNE (I have problems with the rule
system, thruster plates and the real viability of Virus) I do find the
setting refreshing and in some ways quite audacious. I felt shocked when I
first read Survival Margin and realised the scope of the Virus\' attacks. I
have no objection to it being discussed but anyone writing on it should be
aware of the flame bait possibilities in their posts. And that is what the
FAQ is getting at.

No. "Weight" is the force generated by gravity (or acceleration) acting mass.

Yes, but so is charge. At the *particle* level. A particle\'s charge is
just as fixed as it\'s mass. The only reason most matter appears to be
uncharged it that it tends to consist of equal numbers of positive and
negative charges.

In any case the "basic force law" is:

Force = charge * charge / distance^2

The only "difference" between electrical charge and mass as far as
force laws go is that with electrical charge, *opposit* charges attract
and like charges repel. With mass, *like* masses attract (and there\'s
speculation about how negative mass would work).

J-1 uses 10%, time in jump is irrelevant.  The ship basically coasts in
jump space.  (Thats not a very accurate description, but I dont have my

Chuckle!  J-drives produce energy, but that energy is used immediately on
a quantum level to put the ship into J-space.  The makeup of the
superconducting components is very unique, very precise, and will open a
jump entry whenever the necessary energy is applied to them.  Hooking
them up to something else, well, the power leads will be pulled into
J-space, at least, and in a fine string of quantum particles.  Providing
less than the necessary energy to the system will not produce anything. 
Something about quantum thresholds (this is why there are no J-2.5
drives.  Integer values only!).  The actual components that open the
entry are suspended in a vacuum bottle, and are not in contact with any
physical part of the ship.  One of the early problems with J-drives was
sudden contact with the container, resulting in the rather violent
reduction of the ship to its quantum level components!!

Ok, I understood what I wrote, but did\'nt think of anyone else being
confused.  My apologies.  J-1 drives use 10% of the ship\'s tonnage to get
into jump, travelling 1 parsec per week.  J-6 uses 60% of its tonnage to
get to that spacial energy, and so travels 6 parsec per week.  Time spent
in J space doesnt matter.  The drive uses whatever its rating (fuel as a
percentage of ship\'s tonnage) for each jump.  Just to be clear, a J-6
drive used for a J-1 jump, uses 10% of the tonnage in fuel.

Good point.  Though I wonder, if X-boats just jump in-system, download
their data to another boat, which then jumps immediately, the savings in
time would be considerably less.  (At least, thats how X-boats work in my
universe)

Quite true.  I\'m intending this version of J-drive to spread out the
available universe.  Also, systems are a bit further apart in mine than
canon.   (Then again, so is the background, and most everything else!)

Michael, the GURPS Traveller universe is going to be something which in
Science fiction circles is known as an alternate universe. In an alternate
universe some or more crucial events differ from the original universe.
Like, and I\'m grabbing the example right out of thin air, some accident
that prevents an assasin from killing a crucial historical figure. Some
alternate universes have multiple changes, but among conousseurs it is
considered best if all changes arise from one single, pivotal event.
Nothing that happens in an alternate universe invalidates the history of
another universe. The comparison with the infamous "Dallas" idiocy is
completely unwarranted.

If Loren handles things the way I hope he will, GURPS Traveller can only be
an asset to the original Traveller background. Why? Because if the GT
universe is truly an alternate one that dosen\'t diverge until 132-1116,
then every historical background information provided in GT material must
necessarily be compatible with the Traveller universe. Which means that GT
will be the first material since the MT era that adds to the CT background.
Which means that those of us who started out with CT and never intended to
use the Rebellion anyway will get our first shot of useful background for
a decade. And even those who run a MT or a TNE campaign will be able to
get something out of it, because the history of the two universes will be
identical up to a point.

This only applies if GT makes an effort to stay compatible with the other
Traveller universe, but if anyone has a good chance of doing it, it is
Loren, who has been with the game from the start.

And if he dosen\'t, why, we can always just ignore it.

Maybe we could say that this "injection mass" is also sometimes called
"displacement mass" for matter needed to displace the ship into j-space.
This should be the basis for the strange term "displacement ton" that
refers to volume and has generally nothing to do with the wet naval term
displacement.

Others on the lsit have previously solved the problem why jumpfuelis called
fuel - it is because it is the same substance as the p-plant fuel and
landlubbers tend to mix them up. If that is the case then surely spacers
would look down at people that use the term "fuel" when they\'re actually
talking about injection mass or displacement mass.

Maybe you don\'t own that much Trav material (homemade or bought) so
changing history/culture wouldn\'t be that much of a problem but for me
everything is better than changing such fundamentals as x-boats,
2d-starmaps etc.

If I wanted to fit in new tech and SF stuff such as nanotech etc I wouldn\'t
change the Trav background as it would be too much work - rather I would
create a new setting from scratch but then I wouldn\'t be playing Traveller
anymore as all my rules are homemade.

I own plenty of Trav materials.  I don\'t think that I said anything about
destroying Xboats, just changing them.  When all is said and done, the
Xboat routes will function exactly the same with a person in them or not. 
As I said, the Xboat network is Canon (big C), changing it makes the game
something else.  MANNED Xboats are canon (little c), changing them changes
little else in the background.

But tell me.  What else gets changed in the system if you take the person
out of the Xboat?

The ruleset I use is Megatraveller, it\'s my favorite (so far) of all the
Trav rulesets.  However, I never run a game in the \'Shattered Imperium\'
timeframe, \'cause I just can\'t stand it.  I usually run games set during
the \'Classic Traveller\' period.  I like the Fifth Frontier War period. 
However, if I did run a game set at a later date, I would choose the
\'Stephron escaped assasination\' timeline.  There\'d be enough turmoil
(because of the assasination attempt and subsequent shakeups) to make it
interesting, without the total breakup of the Imperium.

Thus I think SJG\'s GURPS Traveller is presenting a useful and welcome
alternate timeline for us GMs to use for our game settings, and are
performing a very useful service in extending and keeping alive our
beloved game.  Keep up the good work!

All of this is, of course, just IMHO.

stuff off the list.

(How?)

I ask you - what\'s Loren doing that\'s so bad? Producing a variant Traveller
seting? How AWFUL! It\'s not like anyone else on the list was using any
non-canon material... you know.... fiddling about with Jump gates or
altering the way Jump works or anything like that, now is it?


So what\'s different? Ah. Loren\'s doing it publically. Successfully. 

Let me tell you about Canon. Kinunir (All hail CT!) had rogue AI computers
and a distinctly repressive Imperium. Later publkications changed that.
Leviathan had jump torpedoes. Then there\'s the drive from Anninc Nova.
These are Canon sources. Do we use them? No, because the canon has changed.


Heplar thrusters are non-canon. Everybody knows all starships use thrust
plates, It says so in CT (All hail CT).

My point is that Canon has evolved. CHANGED. Many people complained that
TNE was non-canonical in many ways, they even went so far as to say that
they LIKED the stable imperium of CT. Fine. Where\'s the GURPS setting
again? Should we should instead say: OK. (T4) -CT-MT-TNE. That\'s canon.
Nothing else can be canon. No variants are allowed. OK. Close down the
list, then. Traveller is dead. 

Why?

Because every game is a variant. Even later publications from GDW
contradict earlier sources. Everything anyone writes is non-canon. So hey,
let\'s all stop using our imagination to play this game and instead complain
about how minor facts are non-canon.

Loren\'s Traveller has all the facets of the \'real thing\'. It IS the real
thing. No jump gates, FTL radio, no warp drives and wrinkly foreheads....
It\'s Traveller, and yes it\'s a variant. A variant that hapens to follow
exisxting canon very closely in all ways but one. A variant that just
happens to be for sale.

THE MT TIMELINE LED INTO THE NEW ERA. RIGHT OR WRONG, IT\'S DONE AND GONE.
THIS IS JUST A DIFFERENT (OR IS IT THE SAME?) SETTING FOR THE GAME. A
COUPLE OF EVENTS HAPPENED DIFFERENTLY AND HISTORY HAS TURNED OUT A LITTLE
DIFFERENT. BUT IT\'S STILL TRAVELLER.

So: If you like the GURPS background; play it. With or without the GURPS
rules. If not, then play your own variant. But if you want people booted
off the list for canon violations then you\'re going to be very lonely in
here.

As an aside: By this argument... TNE IS the only setting, because it\'s
canon. You must play TNE. Only TNE. Everything else is a variant,
non-canon, and not permitted to anyone on this list.

Ideally. However, there is nothing to stop manning with lower levels of
crew. Automated alarms can be set to alert crew that there is a problem
(but the delay dealing with it could (rarely) be fatal). Passenger ships
and those with cargos would likely maintain a full watch, smaller vessels
may choose to let this slide.

Not necessarily - the ripples in the field may well be easy to deal with at
the start. I wouldn\'t introduce them in a situation unless someone had
messed up the jump entry roll. I view them as being more related to
controlling the feed to the hydrogen bubble around the ship.

I don\'t see where you\'re coming from here. IMTU the collapse of the jump
bubble leads to the destruction of the ship. Emergence from J-Space is
governed by other phenomena. If pushed to explain I\'d mutter something
about parabolic curves in J-Space/N-Space relations with energy levels that
cause jump precipitation.... someone posted something to this effect a
while ago and I\'d try and find the reference. There was also the
interesting posts by Prof Davros (?), which I inadvertantly deleted.

Fair enough and I have no problem with that at all. I do allow jump
torpedoes etc but there is a risk of a misjump/failure higher than that of
a manned vessel.

   For review let\'s define terms:

1) Referee\'s Canon - What passes for the legtimate universe in a
campaign--can include such heretical notions as Klingons, Porky Pig Drive
(aka stutter warp), planets with donuts holes, time travel, parallel
universes, etc.  Totally up to whoever the referee is and what the players
are willing to tolerate.

2) Storyline Canon - The official storyline as developed by GDW from 1977 to
1996, detailing the history of "Known Space" from the period of the Ancients
to the post-Third Imperium era.  Also includes those elements developed by
other licensed publishers (DGP, IG, etc.) that do not directly contradict
GDW\'s work.

3) Game Mechanics Canon - The official "how to" of Traveller.  Includes some
common themes (jump drive, fusion power, advanced materials [i.e.
superdense], gauss weaponry, etc.) though there are some significant
variations among different versions of the game.  Includes the official task
resolution system (if any), how damage should be rolled, applied, etc.

4) canon - That which is generally accepted as being acceptable or correct
by the majority of Traveller fans or some subset thereof (the people who
frequent this list for example).  That the Third Imperium existed in 1106
would be considered Storyline Canon and canon.  The upper limit on laser
power in FF&S I (and the formula for determining it) is considered canon but
is not Game Mechanics Canon in TNE.  Naturally canon can be cheerfully
ignored in Referee\'s Canon.

So what the hell is GURPS Traveller?

   GURPS Traveller is an attempt to take a portion of the Storyline Canon
and create a new variant product based in part on the game mechanics of
GURPS and some of the common Game Mechanics themes expressed in Traveller.

   GURPS Traveller is *not* Traveller, per se.  It has been officially
declared non-canon by its own creator.  However, because it does share much
of the Storyline Canon in common with Traveller, there remains the
possibility of dialogue amongst Traveller and GURPS Traveller fans on this
mailing list (for now anyway).  Naturally as the G:T story is developed
beyond 1116, it will have no relevance to followers of the Canon Storyline
after 1116, except as an interesting "what if" excercise.

   I am afraid that what I\'ve seen posted the last couple of days or so to
the list is the beginning of a schism amongst Traveller fans that will
ultimately result in the TNEers (and those who use the MegaTraveller
Rebellion storyline) picking up their heretical D20s (this would not apply
to MTers of course) and going home.  

   Classic Traveller fans of course have *absolutely* no basis for crowing
about the legitmacy of the G:T story line over that "nasty Virus thing Dave
Nilsen imposed on us" (or "Loren\'s Rebellion"), yet I already sense that
there are those among them who are or are preparing to do that very thing.
Sorry, but in your attempts at reaching for something that will "bring back
the Imperium" (as if it were something tangible that was taken from you as a
child), you are becoming Canon Storyline heretics--the thing that you
supposedly hate the most.

   For TNEers, they perhaps face their greatest challenge--one almost as
great as when GDW went under.  The fact is that Steve Jackson Games is a
powerful game company and Loren\'s voice gives G:T a certain level of
legitimacy that can\'t be dismissed readily.  G:T isn\'t Traveller, it\'s based
on Traveller--but that still doesn\'t stop the feeling of betrayal or shield
you from the slings and arrows from those who would rather forget that you
exist.  Just remember that Loren has betrayed no one, and deserves better
than to be told to take his heretical game and go to the 14th level of
whatever GURPS calls Hades (that would be Oklahoma, right?  :-)  ).  Act
with class--more class than those who would try to run *you* off to the 14th
level of whatever because you follow the Storyline Canon to its logical
conclusion.  And stick around TML...you have as much right to be here as
anyone else, because *you* are a *Traveller* fan.

Actually, this is how smaller ships (100-200-300 dTons) get away with
small crews. By strict interpretation of the rules _all_ ships need: a
pilot, an astrogator and an engineer, at minimum, plus a gunner if the
ship is armed. So how does that scout do it all by himself? by watching
the telltales and readouts in his cockpit, and making a mad dash into the
engineering areas if necessary.

Note, this does not alter the fact that, most likely, Xboats would be
heavily automated. You want to avoid extending that to larger ships you\'ll
run into political and other pressures coming to bear.  All that would
have to happen is the slightest _hint_ that a ship was lost due to a
failure of the automation to keep them from being used. After all...a 737
was landed at an airport a while back under the complete control of a
GPS-linked autopilot. I know for sure, we\'re not going to see fully
automatic unmanned landings soon if ever.

Even the kinds of automation in current cockpits is being _reduced_ not
expanded, because they have found that pilots who are busy _doing_
something, rather than just watching the plane fly itself, are more alert
and have a faster reaction time to emergencies.

You want the handwave? Something utterly irreplaceable and precious is
loaded on a spanking new technologically advanced Airbus Industries xl6700
2000 dTon automated freighter.  It\'s wonderful, it\'s economic, it takes
just three people to run it. It vanishes after a jump carrying the \'Mona
Lisa\', for example, to a exhibition at Core. 

There will be an immediate hue and cry to outlaw automated ships.

Technologically, we have the ability today to pretty much make a
completely automated airliner. Will we ever see one? Probably not in my
lifetime. Humans are funny that way...they want a human in charge of
things.

This one changes with each system. As a result, I would say that
Game mechanics that break Canon #2 above, are broken.

This applies to design rules, as well (which are near and dear to my
heart as many of you know :-)  This means that some #3 canon things
(High Guard springs to mind) might well be broken. Design rules to
make tech that fits traveller history (canon #2).

The whole laser things is a good example of broken Game Mech canon.
In FFS1 out of the box, lasers were the only weapon that anyone
would ever build since they were far and away better weapons that
anything else (of _any_ size). Story canon for TNE had published
ships with "normal" weapons (no super-lasers), so obviously it was
FFS1 that was broken, the story canon went as expected. This was
fixed in FFS2 (and as house rules for most TNE people) by llimiting
the discharge energy of lasers.
 
As for GURPS Traveller, I am confident that it will be well done
from what I\'ve seen here and other conversations I\'ve had with
involved parties.

    'body' => 'Well, since I\'m working the Heretic\'s Jump Drives string, I\'ll weigh in
with my 0.02 Cr on automation.  Ships need crew to take care of the
non-jump periods, like landings, takeoffs, etc.  Not to mention cargo
handling, gunnery, and so on.  As far as things like X-boats, though, an
automated drive would be as reasonable as anything else, since these
mostly jump in-system, dump their data, and rendezvous with a tender. 
Easy for any reasonable AI system.  Now of course, if the boat misjumps,
or is presented with some truly difficult problem, like, say an enemy
raider, its toast.  As far as the engineering crews on manned ships, they
still have plenty to do, like maintenance (well we\'re in jump, pull the
accumulators on turrets 1,3, and 7 and check \'em.)  The idea of jump
flutter (I cant seem to find who wrote about that, sorry :(      )  is
similar to my jump space\'s quantum fluctuations, causing ships to wander
off course.  For my campaign, I\'d say an automated ship must make its
first navigation check at the end of the first week, as opposed to the
second.  I\'m not sure (yet) what kind of loss rate this might entail, but
you can be sure the rate will drop with the increase in TL. 



Considering a comment by someone else about the costs of jump torpedoes,
how bout this for a concept.  Limited life-span equipment for short
life-span automated ships (torpedoes?  shrug.) that are intended for only
one, or just a few uses.  Consider the jet engine in the Harpoon missile.
 The turbine blades are cast, rather than milled, and have an operational
lifetime of approximately 15 minutes.  They are **much** cheaper than the
better built engines used in jets, but reliable (for their life-span) but
they will only live for 15 or minutes anyway.  So systems built in these
ships might be built to be reliable, but only for a short time, thus
reducing the costs.

While running the Traveller Adventure, I found a bit of "piracy" in the
form of the Tradewar between Oberlindes and Tukera/Akerut.  I\'m finding it
kinda hard to justify to the players that the Imperial government has
agreed to "look the other way" while the two trading companies batter each
other to bits in the Aramis subsector.

Ah well, whatever it takes for a good romping adventure.

Anyway, I plan to outfit the characters with a "letter of marque" for
tradewar, plus there will be an equivalent of the Geneva Convention (The
Shuudusham Accords) which applies to treatment of prisoners and disabled
vessels, prizes, captured cargos belonging to a third party, etc.

Geez, I better get started on this stuff, we\'re playing tomorrow night.

I agree with this, but I think that implementation would have to wait for
a computer simulation.  Too much bookkeeping, exponential complexity -- I
can visualize an iterative algorithm that figures out the dispersal of
resources between parter worlds using distance and cost formulae together
with political priorities... ergh. :)

I got very nice private replies from Joe Walsh and Stuart Dollar about
this.  They also agree with the point in principle; the commodities market
is a concession to playability and the limited time they had to produce
the book in.

I never even considered this dimension, but now that I do, I think that
for reasons of playability it should be glossed over, unless I\'m writing a
software simulation.  It\'s a good idea, though, in general, to model
resources by commodity type (food, metals, etc.).

I agree that the system is good (Stu already convinced me, but your
numbers below are nice), but I think that the upper bound on population is
too high.

Tens of billions.  :)

Your other numbers above were intermediate sized planets, for which the
system works very well.  At the upper bound, though, the system starts to
break down.  Take your planet here, add one TL and 6 Resources, and you\'ve
got Sylea as described on page 36, which will hit hundreds of billions
(Pop code B) before it stops growing.  (3.5 + 12 + 12 + 15) / (9 + 1) =
4.25 = 1% population growth; 42.5 / (10 + 1) = 3.86 = 0% growth.

What happens when poor Sylea hits TL 15 (and Infrastructure 15) with a Pop
code of B?  That formula becomes (3.5 + 15 + 15 + 15) / (10 + 1) = 4.4 =
1% population growth.  Trillions of people.  Ouch.

Yes, it really does work well most of the time.  Stu explained to me that
it is actually a model of migration, rather than birth/death rate, which
apparently remains fairly static and was left out of the model.  Since we
are only interested in cases were interstellar migration is possible, the
system works quite well, except at the upper bound.

Now there\'s an idea!  Unfortunately, Sylea\'s atmosphere is 8 so it will
still end up with trillions of people living on it (it has less surface
area than Terra, too).  Still, you might be on to something here. 

I had thought maybe a table indexed by planetary size and Infrastructure
could specify an upper bound on the population that a planet could support
(since Infrastructure is already limited by Resources and TL, the
influence of those factors is already felt).  I made a spreadsheet based
on some real-world data that Joe sent me, but I need to do more research:
Earth at uniform TL 7 should be capable of supporting the population
density of China or India over all of its arable surface.  My results were
too low at TL 7 and too high at TL 15.

But perhaps also, you *never* (or almost never) want a planet to reach pop
code B (which most formulas I can think of will allow in one way or
another), so when it hits pop code A, start applying modifiers to the die
roll in such a way that the population averages out to zero growth.

We also discussed a progression of die modifiers, based on consecutive or
total turns of "overgrowth", which would be reduced when the population
shrank.  At the moment I\'m thinking that might be the best way.  When a
planet hits pop code B, it will be the result of so much overgrowth that a
lot of shrinkage must follow before the die modifier goes down again.  I
still need to figure out an upper bound to declare "overgrowth" at, though
(10 billion is too low).

I agree.  Thanks for your reply, Ian.

I need brainstorm ideas as to why ships _need_ a crew
for such things as piloting, astrogation, sensors,
comms, and engineering.

Oh boy, when it rains, it pours.  Just today two players
confronted me over starship automation, starting with the
Xboat automation question and moving to "normal" ship
automation.

Even today ships can be fully automated, and often the
crew just sit and scratch themselves while the computers
do all the work.

"So why do spaceships need a pilot and sensors guy?
Why do starships need an astrogator?  Why do they need any
crew at all?"

I had to agree to all their premises, but they were trying
to use that to box me into allowing their ships to have full
automation.  I said no, because it changes the nature of
the game.  Thus one captain can travel almost as a passenger
in his ship, and needs only a token crew or just a Jack-of-
all-Trades dude, in case of emergency.  Or worse, if the
astrogator were to be eaten by local cannibals, no problem,
the ship\'s computer can pinch-hit for him.

No way.  This is not how I envisioned things at all.  Just
because I usually disregard task rolls for skilled crew
doesn\'t mean the player\'s skills are unimportant.  I don\'t
LIKE it.  Why?  Well, I guess it changes the nature of the
game so much, it washes off some of the color.

What are the issues here?

What parts of the system are non-automatable?

Are ship components separated?

Is there in-jump maintenance?
   -are there jumpgrid stability issues?

Astrogator : fiddles with the flight plans?
             station-keeping tasks in jump?
Pilot      : fiddles with the maneuver controls + jump field?
Engineer   : fiddles with the drives?
Sensor     : ?
Captain    : fiddles with the crew\'s minds?

The problem is then you have to swallow that the Imperium was the
only entity using automatic ships, but this just happened to never
warrant even mention, even in border areas (or in supplements
dealing with Vargr and other places outside the imperium).

It also runs into the objection that I wan\'t PC\'s to have to
handle things, not sit back and let a computer do it....

Form IM25-01 \'Notice of Grievence\' is filed with the Duke/Marquis of the
subsector(s), and a 90 day waiting/cooling off period commences.  During this
time, 2 meetings with Imperial officials are required by responsible members of
each affected corporation.  Also during this time, the area of conflict is
defined, and a \'Notice to Travellers\' must be distributed (at the grieving
parties cost) to all affected starports.

At the end of the waiting period, if the cause for grievence still exists, all
parties involved will be issued authorization codes for Letters of Marque (for
privateers) and Bonds (for mercenary companies).

Ship\'s bearing letters of Marque must register with the SPA upon arrival at the
starport, and must ensure that corporate action warnings have been published
within the past 90 days.  Corporate-flag ships may be engaged without warning,
but simultaneous with the engagement there must be a broadcast by the ship(s)
initiating hostilities consisting of at least their Marque authorization code,
ship\'s registry, and a steer clear warning to other shipping in the area. 
Independant merchants who may be carrying Corporate personnel and/or cargo must
be given a minimum of a single warning and the opportunity to answer within
reasonable time.  The warning must consist of the Marque authorization code,
ship\'s registry and reference the corporate action occurring.  Firing on
independant merchants is discouraged.  Independant merchants may, provided that
Jump Gear and Fire Control Systems are not activated, delay to verify the
legitimacy of the Privateer through the SPA.  Intervention of the SPA or System
Defence Forces will constitute and immediate \'Cease Fire\'.

Cargo and passengers of conflicting corporations must be declared as such on
ship\'s manifests, and filed with a \'Acknowledgement of Responsibility\' form
IM25-20 signed by the ship\'s purser and/or Captain.  Imperial limits on
passenger/cargo fees are not applicable in this case.

   I wouldn\'t necessarily think so.  Jump torps for example...  3 out of 4
versions of Traveller support exceptions to the 100dt minimum.  CT and T4
they\'re in the cracks and it\'s explicit in FFS.  I\'d be surprised if there
wasn\'t an MT exception lurking around somewhere, too.  J- Torps don\'t violate
"Storyline Canon" since the 3I uses the Xboat network (why is the interesting
question... maybe J-torps have a propensity for misjump and/or destruction...
maybe it\'s a power game and/or psychohistory project... maybe it\'s a
manipulation by the Hivers, Templars, whatever...)

   I\'ve always designed ships w/ the tl*50 limit on lasers but I\'ve gotten to
thinking about it.   Using that rules mod, there\'s no reason to create laser
bays.  The pure volume of bays are only needed when there\'s a very high
discharge energy.  Besides... do small ships use anything other than lasers
(including det lasers in here).  Only the larger ships have the space for
spinal mounts.  What else do the large ships use?  Missle bays, spinal mounts
and... lasers.

Well Dave Nilsen said that almost all of the published designs were compromise
updates of old designs and that he wasn\'t satisfied with them at all.  The
Regency Starship Guide was going to take full advantage of the rules in FF&S. 
(x-ray lasers, etc etc).

Well, I can\'t speak generally.  But communications limitations is one of
the founding principles of the background.  To change this doesn\'t
involve tweaking the background, it inolves either scrapping it
or putting in obvious kludges.

As to the role of humans more generally, to me it is a roleplaying
issue.  I would rather GM and play a game where your PC does stuff
rather than one where he/she sits back and lets a computer do it.
That is why I don\'t hand wave.  I simply tell my players that
PC participation is simply a genre convention.

Not really.  They can be picked up at arrival by humans.  They don\'t
don\'t need to support them, doing nothing, for a week in jumps
space.  Instead you have crews at each end that can handle landing
and taking off of some multiple number of ships.

Except that suddenly robotic ships that PCs have never seen before
are suddenly all over the place.

   Good point, and I hasten to add, I don\'t question the *quality* of GURPS:
Traveller for a minute--it will be excellent.  I do worry however that G:T
will serve as something that acts as a devisive influence among Traveller
fans--afterall, if the only thing keeping us together now is the Storyline
Canon (whether your campaign is set after 1116, or 1130 or not), what\'s left?

companiues to resolve a dispute, and for various reasons the usual methods
are either unusable or not preferable, they may resort to conducting a
"Trade War" with another company.

Officially, the Imperial Government says that any such activity is illegal
and punishable by the usual fines, imprisonment, etc. that accompany the
various activities surrounding such a campaign.  Unofficially, they know
that their power to do anything about an ongoing tradewar is not great, and
in 866, after a tradewar between rival megacorporations in the Corridor
sector that resulted in millions of civilian lives lost, they laid out the
Garushang Agreements (named for a major city on a planet in the Corridor
Sector).

The Tenants of the agreement are not signed.  Instead both sides are
expected to follow these guidelines or face the wrath of a displeased
Imperial Government who will do all they can to stop a company known to
have violated the agreement, up to and including nameing corporate leaders
Outlaws of the Imperium, hunted on every one of the 10,000 worlds for the
high bounties associated with such individuals (often collected from
forensic evidence gather form the corpse of the Outlaw).  Typically, any
vessel on either side will have a copy of the agreement, along with a
letter of Marque (see below) on board to indicate they will abide by the
terms.

These are the main points;

1). No participant will put any uninvolved population at risk (with the
possible exception of passengers), or cause a major disruption in the
economic capability of any single world or region.  No use will be made of
nuclear impact weapons, persistent lethal chemical weapons, or lethal or
permanently debilitating biological weapons.  Non-planetary use of laser
detonation nuclear warheads is a specific exception to this rule.

2). Attacks and espionage will be limited to the companies involved and
will take all reasonable precautions to limit collateral damage or loss of
sentient life.  Along the same theme, no individual shall be specifically
targeted for assassination or elimination.

3). In the event of spaceborne combat, no ship which has indicated its
surrender will be fired apon, nor shall a ship after indicating its
surrender fire apon another ship after striking.  All involved vessels
shall make every reasonable effort to rescue other beings of either group
involved in the dispute.  Proper medical care must be sought for the
injured, or cold sleep facilities provided.

4).  Prisoners shall not be mistreated, tortured, or deprived of reasonable
health care, shelter, sustinence, or protection.  Prisoners shall be
repatriated under bond at the first safe opportunity, within a reasonable
time period.  Prisoners may not be required to work for their captors,
except when such work (such as emergency repairs to a ship) are required to
aid survival.  Prisoners may not be ransomed or sold into slavery.

5).  Passengers and consignors of cargo must be warned when a known
tradewar exists involving the shipping agent.  Insurance coverage for
tradewar losses must be negotiated seperately from the usual losses.
Piracy insurance does not cover losses due to tradewar actions by properly
authorized privateers.

6).  Any vessel specifically assigned the task of hijacking an opponent\'s
shipping or attaching its facilities shall carry a paper and electronic
letter of Marque authorizing such action by the company leadership.  This
letter must reiterate these agreements and is signed by the captain of any
such vessel to indicate he, she or it agrees to the contract.  It shall be
transmitted to any vessel under threat on request.

7).  When engaging another vessel, proper opportunity shall be given to
allow the opponent vessel to surrender prior to combat being joined.
Vessels and installations which are defenseless shall not be fired apon
until personnel can evacuate or be evacuated, unless such personnel refuse
to evacuate.

8).  When capturing a vessel in a declared tradewar, all rights to salvage
or ownership pass to the capturing company, who will share out the prize
with the capturing crew as they see fit.  If there is a dispute over the
disposition of a vessel declared a prize, a prize commission shalll be
convened consisting of two representatives from each company, two members
of the local nobility of the rank of knight or higher, chosen by the
leading subsector noble, and two neutral parties agreed to by the companies
involved.  Decisions of the prize committee are made by consensus, and are
final.  In the event of a deadlock a new prize commission will be formed
with all new members.

9).  [This section edited for brevity] ...Such penalties as are iterated
below shall be applied by the Imperial Government for violations of these
agreements.  Individuals acting without the approval of their coroporate
superiors, conducting defined Crimes Against Sentient Life... [Planetary
Destruction, Assassination Attempts, Criminal Neglect of Prisoners, among
other crimes] ...may be declared Outlaws of the Imperium and may face
penalties up to and including death by beheading or other means.[...]

[...]When, in the course of acting in accordance with their superiors\'
instructions, individuals violate the rules iterated above, they will be
held accountable for their actions in a manner equal to their superiors who
issued such orders, i.e. declared Outlaw and hunted across the Imperium.
[specific crimes and penalties edited for brevity].

Excuse me, but I won\'t pretend to be the least bit sorry that G:T
will take up the legacy of CT and carry it forward.  I accept that
various people for various reasons decided to dramatically
change the direction of the official Traveller background. That
being said, I have never liked what MT and TNE did with the
CT background, and won\'t pretend to like it.

"Legitimacy" (whatever that means) is a non-sequitur to me.  I
prefer CT and (hopefully) G:T over MT and TNE -- that\'s it.

I will crow with joy from now until doomsday that CT fans will
now get a background that builds upon what we know and
love.  I may even dance and caper around a bonfire and burn
my copy of Rebellion Sourcebook, who knows.

*self control mode ON*

With due respect, Harold, this borders on arrogant presumption
and insult.  Whether you admit it or not, something was taken from
me, as a CT fan -- the chance to see the background that I know,
like, and prefer, continue and grow.  Instead, it was radically
altered.  Now, I get that back, and I\'m tickled!

If MT and TNE fans get more background for their preferred
setting, then good for them!  I\'ll understand and be happy for
them.

If disliking the MT and TNE backgrounds is heresy, then tie me
to the stake and fire up the Bar-B-Que.  If someone else wants
to be a different sort of storyline heretic, then goody for them,
I don\'t "supposedly" hate them.

>... G:T isn\'t Traveller, it\'s based on Traveller...

When I think of Traveller, *to me*, I think of the CT, 3rd
Imperium background (and to a degree, the Spinward
Marches.)  That, *for me*, is the heart of what Traveller
means to me.  Not ship design systems, or task rules, or the
number of sides to a die.

So, G:T is going to be more "Traveller" than either MT or
TNE was, as far as *I* am concerned.  Your milage may
vary.

Add a 3D Holo of the sophont, DNA map, & retinal print. Security at all
Class A/B starports should have the equipment necessary to read the
DNA map regardless of local TL. Navy/Scout bases will _always_ have
this equipment. Class C starports may have the equipment but Class C
and D won\'t; most of the time there\'s no one there who cares (IMTU).

The retinal print is more for lower TL military/civilian security
systems.
The 3D holo is for those worlds whose TLs limit their security forces
to the ol\' Mark 1 eyeball.

premises; first is that over 65 million years a group of sentient dinosaurs
colonized this region of gaxaly and terra-formed nearly all habitable and
near-inhabitable planets and then died out. second is that in the 21st
century earth suffers a limited nuclear conflict which devastates the
nations of earth, third that just before the nuclear war, the United States,
Europe and China launch sub-light interstellar starts to start colonies on
Alpha Centauri (Promethus), Epsilon Eridani (Ilike), and Epsilon Indi
(Meshan). The nuclear war triggers the latent psionic abilities of humanity
and in a hundred years earth is united under the psi dominated Terran
Consulate. Also that the alien races humanity encounters are the evolved
descendents of earth-based ecologies, so diseases, and food are compatible.

The preamble for my setting is this:

Mankind has reached the stars only to find Earth. Birds flying through
distant skies, fish swimming unknown seas, and dinosaurs ruling unexplored
continents. On a hundred worlds are the children of the Earth; children of a
Earth of sixty-five million years ago. Now the new children have out grown
their cradle and wonder who and what scattered the seeds of the Earth
throughout the stars. They are forging a new life among the stars but old
fears and conflicts still threaten them. The year is 2403 and this is their
story.

I just read back my 6AM frothings from the list. I\'ve maybe calmed down a
bit now.

Maybe not.....

G:T isn\'t Traveller? Sorry? Then neither is TNE, MT or T4. They all change
some part of \'canon\'. If we can change from thrusters to HEPLAR and still
call the game Traveller then we can change a single piece of the storyline
and still have Traveller. But who cares about that?

I ran CT with Laserburn combat rules. By some people\'s definition that\'s
not Traveller, even though it\'s set in the Traveller universe and used all
the game concepts. Then I ran TNE, but using home-written rules that had
little to do with any Traveller rules ever written. I suppose that wasn\'t
Traveller either? 

Oh, but it was. It just used different mechanics.

I say again: G:T\'s storyline diverges from the \'canon\' version, but that
doesn\'t mean it\'s not Traveller... it\'s set in the 3rd Imperium... has all
the Traveller concepts. (BTW: in answer to the question about how closely
GT is going to resemble the pre-divergence canon, I can say: those writers
I know about are making strenuous efforts to ensure compliance with canon
sources.)

It\'s as simple as this: There are now several versions of Traveller around.
Pick the setting and rules set you like and just play the damn game. Why
are we all mudslinging? The damage is done. The traitors diverged from
canon when the first supplement came out for CT, and has kept on diverging.
Just ignore what you don\'t like. This is a GAME, for God\'s sake. Buy it, or
don\'t. Your choice. But NOBODY has the right to demand bootings off the
list for breaches of canon. Else nobody would be allowed on this list at
all. I mean.... how big are Imperial Battle Cruisers? 

The answer is 1250 displacement tons. (Adventure 1: Kinunir) Anything else
is non-canon and WRONG. 
Get off the list if you believe different.

There are plenty of (just as ridiculous) other examples, I\'m sure. I can\'t
be bothered to think of any right now.

This is the Traveller list. It\'s for discussion of Traveller in all its
forms, and G:T may not fit the \'conon\' timeline, but it\'s Traveller. I know
that because:

1. It looks and feels like Traveller. It uses Traveller concepts, the
Traveller universe, and  even the \'stable Imperium\' setting that not long
ago certain people were bemoaning the abandonment of.

2. Loren Wiseman says its Traveller, and he should know.

3. It says \'Traveller\' in the title. That means that Marc Miller has
licensed it as a variant or something similar. Would he have done that if
it wasn\'t Traveller? No, because his permission wouldn\'t be needed to
produce \'SF game that has nothing to do with Traveller\' (tm). Such a game
might well have no place on this list. This one does.

I have played and enjoyed all the versions of Traveller and I\'ll be getting
GURPS Trav too. I\'ll pick the one I like best and crib ideas from the
others. But what I\'ll not do is to dump hate-mail on any particular variant
because it doesn\'t fit my small-minded vision of what Traveller should be. 

Which is and which isn\'t Traveller, then?

They\'re ALL Traveller.

We\'re all Traveller fans.

Go figure.

If you worry about c, then it takes a minimum of 3 years to travel a
parsec, since a parsec is that many light years.

As a rough and ready guide, you hit 0.5 c, where relativity might start to
get interesting, after at=1.5e8m/s = 100 t = 1.5e8 -> 1.5e6 s -> 18 days or
so at ten gravities.  At 1 g, you would hit c in a year, more or less.

That was my point. TL*50 is an add-on, not out of the box FFS. FFS
alone means that a couple dozen 100 ton laser bays will wipe out
bunches of big ships. Spinal mounts then disappear from the universe
(unless everyone has agreed to use less effective weapons by treaty
or something :-)

Meaning that they would all break canon? What I mean is that if the
designs tookk full advantage of out of the box FFS, spinal mounts,
missiles, etc would all be totally pointless.

Loren is involved, that speaks volumes to me! And Steve Jackson is

Well, just for record, not everyone considers the problems solved.
This is at least partially because the objection is not that you
can\'t come up with handwaves to make displacement mass fit.  But
that the presence of the various handwaves makes the idea feel
contrived....

	[ handwave mode on - this is not superstring but only string 3 ]

	In a centrifuge, we feel the centrifugal force, but there is a
	centripetal force. Thats like we feel the weight, but there is
	an other force. This force is centripetal. Its because there is
	an event horizon between 3 dimensional time and 3 dimensional
	space. Its posible to reduce the space to a point (legal
	because of the event horizon) and to draw the time as a flight
	of winding stairs (in german we call this Wendel). As we speak
	about drawing time, we have to speak about vectors and not
	distances. The most important vector is where a quantum of mass is
	most likely. And this is C-v, where v is its own velocity it
	thinks it has in space3/time1. Anytime we think we increase our
	velocity we are reducing it the same time in the time continum.
	When we thing we have light speed in space, our speed in time is
	reduced to zero, and our position in the space continum is a
	point zero. When we think we are mostly at rest, our time will
	move as fast as posible and our position in the time continuum
	will be at the out fringe. In both cases we feel the centrifugal
	force of the time continuums impuls and we call this force
	weight. This weight is not a real force, but something we feel.
	The real things are quantum (what we call mass) and impuls of
	the time continuum.

	First of all apologise - I did\'nt pick up the right tone. But

	Loren feal unconfortable. He should read what I thing about
	him and G:T, or take me to his personal killfile, which was
	the advise I gave him yesterday.

	Third - Its my opinion, that G:T and what Loren is doing with
	Traveller is a bad thing and only WarHamster would be worse.

	GURPS is not playing the Classic Era (900-1100) but in an alternate
	timeline invalidating MT&TNE.

	Call it odd, its still killing (half of) Traveller canon.

MJ Dougherty:

	Thats not my point, if you want to play in the classic imperial
	setting, you should do it between 1-1115, at best start at
	800-900 to asure that the 3I is still online when the Travellers
	have to take a low berth. Or you can do it in any other way.
	You can play as heretic as you want as long as you are not
	the major publisher.

Harold D. Hale:

	Yes thats my point. Its a differnce between us when we are
	playing an alternate Traveller at home, and GURPS running an
	active web site with lots of TNS articles invalidating MT year
	for year, and soon starting to publish their version of
	Traveller. That IG is perhaps closing doors makes this alternate
	setting the only one printed in numbers. And this is killing
	Traveller as Traveller is not a ruleset but canon = 20 years
	of written history.

James a Clem:

	This is perhaps a good paralell to Traveller. Traveller has the
	weight of 20 years tradition, making it nearly imposible to
	write anything without violating canon. But GURPS did\'nt even
	try. Loren "came out the shower" and deceided that Traveller
	canon is dead, and that there is a need to release from the
	burden of 20 years written history. He can be as successfull as
	those hated Solomani b*st&rds, looting the Vilani empire and

	How many programs can actually import an Illustrator file? Not very
easily edited if I can\'t import it. How many programs can edit a PDF
file? None that I know of, other than Adobe Acrobat. How standard is
Flash--I\'ve never heard of it? And how many programs can import and
edit it? None that I have, at least. How many programs can edit
Postscript? Yes, GhostScript allows Wintel machines to view and print
it ... 

	I\'m absolutely NOT arguing that DXF or WMF are the best formats as
far as reproducing the original author\'s creation. But just about
every vector program out there can read and write DXF in some form or
another. Even Powerpoint, a presentation graphics program, and Word,
a *word processor* can import DXF.

	So my point was that they\'re a reasonable "least common denominator"
if you want to distribute in an *editable* format.

	Air and Space had a story about the prototype 707. Seems the
chairman of Boeing was out on a houseboat in the Potomac, wining and
dining a bunch of airline executives in the hopes of convincing them
to buy this radical new jet-powered passenger plane. As part of the
shindig, he\'d arranged for the prototype to do a flyby. What he
*hadn\'t* arranged for was the roll the chief test pilot decided to do
... the pilot didn\'t have a job when he landed. The next morning the
orders started rolling in and he got his job back.

	If I recall correctly, the designers had recently been arguing over
whether the 707 *could* roll, and came to the conclusion it couldn\'t.
It certainly had never been done before.

OK, so it\'s not quite the classic era more of a continuation of the classic
era.  IT IS A GAME!!!  It\'s not a matter of life and death, it\'s not
religion!  With your cries of "CANON" this and "CANON" that you sound like
you are on a Jihad!  Lighten up!  No one is forcing you to buy GURPS:
Traveller, believe it or not you do have a choice where purchasing
Traveller products is concerened.

Personally I am axiously awaiting the release of GURPS: Traveller and have
already told my FLGS to get me a copy as soon as it is available.  Who
cares if it\'s in an alternate Traveller Universe.

Let\'s look at this rationally, I\'m assuming that you\'ve got a majority of
the Traveller stuff that\'s in print that you\'ve been able to lay your hands
on (I\'ll admit that I do).  Now G:T comes along, you\'ve got new source
books, which based on everything SJG\'s seems to do will be high quality (I
wish we could say that about IG).  If you feel you must buy these books,
but find the fact that they go against the "All Holy Canon of the Traveller
Universe" repugnant, you can still use them for adventure ideas.  If you
want to play in the MT or TNE settings using GURPS, you will now have an
easy way to do it!

Think of it as a potentially wonderful source of new material, not as a
abomination that violates the "All Holy Canon of the Traveller Universe"
and must be resisted at all cost.

But most importantly remember this, it is a game, it isn\'t real!  It is
simply a game, and it\'s supposed to be fun!

Y\'know.  I think I stated this.  The Xboat network still works in exactly
the same way, there\'s just no person on board.  So, no, changing whether
Xboats are automated or manned does not involve scrapping canon, nor does
it involve fudging anything.

It is a roleplay issue.  You\'re absolutely right.  Personally, the way I
see it is that there\'s no need for elaborate handwaves to say that.

I don\'t mean Free Trader as in ship type, I mean Free Trader in the
Traveller ideal.  A crew of people who buy and sell goods.  The "Free"
points out that they are not attached to a large corporation.  How many
Free Trader crews do you know that have "agents" at every planet along
their trade routes?  That\'s right.  It doesn\'t happen.  Sooooo...  canon is
not changed.  PCs can still be Free Traders.

How do you mean?  I have never been on board a cargo ship plying the
Atlantic or Pacific trade routes.  I\'ve never been on an oil tanker.  I\'ve
seen them from a short distance, but I\'ve never been on them.

Your players are on Megacorp cargo ships from week to week?  Have your
players ever actually been on Megacorp dedicated cargo ships?

From the PCs point of view, this stuff is almost entirely invisible, so
that\'s really not a valid argument.

Just about may be correct, but as far as I know none of the software I use

them:

1.  I can figure out the meaning and rationale behind just about all the
names in the campaign.  I am stumped on the following.  What do they mean
or refer to?

Marinus van der Lubbe
Amondiage
St. Hilaire (is it Pope Hilary, St. Hilary of Arles, or St. Hilary of
Poitiers?)

2.  Is an entire planet really named after Berlichingen im
Baden-Wurtemberg?  It\'s the only one I can find, but I\'ve been there (or at
least to Schoental up the road) and it\'s dinky, if pleasant.

3.  Did anyone ever name the other three STL ships (one from New Home, two
from Amondiage)?

the early 80\'s and greatly admired the background. However ruleswise it
lacked compared to other role-playings that came out in the mid to late
80\'s. Now this is my opinion and comes from sitting down with people can
trying to play the system. My playing group eventually settled on GURPS
because we didn\'t have to learn a whole bunch of new rules everything we
started a new campaign in a different genre, it was nice point based system
where you build what you wanted in a character and as time went on quality
supplements were put out. The quality is what kept us with GURPS

When I heard that is GURPS was coming out with a Traveller Conversion I said
great. We used the WoD conversion in various campaigns and that worked out
nicely. So I set up a Traveller Campaign and used the Traveller: Adventures
as basis for starting the campaign. Several comments on the intial setup.

First making Sci-Fi character in GURPS can be a little tougher than fantasy
because of the wealth of skills. The Summers conversion with the required
career skill list was great and it fealt more Traveller like. I recommend to
Loren and SJG that they use the new Template system as a basis for
generating GURPS Traveller Characters. I would recommend to include
different sub specialities like a Naval Doctor or a Merchant Broker in the
different Career paths.

I would like to see a small chapter disscussing medical option in Traveller
what type of bionic, regeneration, and cloning is available. I have
characters getting shot and mangled. I used the Medical Articles in the
Traveller\'s Digest as a basis for deciding how to handle things. The Vargr
was planting charges to blow up Howood trees on Pysadi when he rolled a 18
on 3D6 a critical failure. The charge blew up and he failed his death roll.
Looking at the articles it stated that a person who has suffered injuries so
that all three of his physical stat are zero is death unless in 1D6 minutes
he is stabilized with the right equipment. On of the player had the right
medical equipment and was able to stabilize him and get him back to the
ship\'s low berth. Then next fifteen minutes was sitting down and finding a
tech level 12 world in Aramis subsector so he doesn\'t have to spend a
half-year regenerating.

I will keep you all posting on how the campaign is going.

How exactly is it invalidating MT and TNE? It\'s not like the existance of
Gurps Traveller will somehow erase every MT and TNE product off the face of
the Earth. You can still play MT or TNE....this just gives those of us that
like the CT background a lot, but have played the same years 1105-1115 over
and over and over, new material - no one is forcing you to buy it or use
it. 

Just picture it like H. Beam Piper\'s Paratime series - the GDW/IG Traveller
is on one probability branch, the GT is on another. Given Traveller\'s many
likenesses to Piper\'s other famous series, it\'s almost fitting, actually.

If anything, what damages MT and TNE (IMHO), is IG\'s and Traveller\'s
creator\'s decision to basically abandon the \'present\', and move the
\'official\' game into the past to the year 0.  When I got T4, that really
annoyed me - while I didn\'t like the Virus scenario much, I thought it
needed some sort of resolution one way or the other in T4 - not just "let\'s
just try to forget it and set the game a long long time before it
happened". 

Instead of the seemingly endless number of equipment supplements IG has put
out, I wish they\'d have put out different era sourcebooks - one for CT, one
for MT, one for the 4th Imperium (or maybe the 1st Republic?) after the
recovery of the Virus, etc, much like outlined in the T4 rulebook. But,
since IG dropped the ball, I\'m glad SJG is doing something almost like
that.

Anyway, that leads me to a question - how much of Gurps Traveller will be,
er, Gurps related, and how much will be general source material? While I
love the setting for Gurps Traveller, I abhor the Gurps rules.

Gurps sourcebooks are usually useful for any game system, but will Gurps
Traveller mostly just be conversions of Traveller equipment, aliens, etc,
to Gurp terms, or will it have lots on the setting,  maybe a listing of the
stats of the Spinward Marches in GT 1116, who\'s who in the 3rd Imperium,
Library Data, etc?

You must not have. At c it takes 3.26 years to cross a parsec.
And it just so happens that 1 g for 1 year (ignoring relativity) will
get you to a speed close to c. So at 10 g it\'d take 1/10th year to
reach c.

A parsec is roughly 200,000 AU. You figure it...

The contract between Steve Jackson Games and Marc Miller\'s Far Future

Rebellion, and no Virus. Steve Jackson wanted it that way _AND_ Marc Miller
wanted it that way (which gives you a clue how he feels in the matter).

You haven\'t made me feel uncomfortable. You _have_ made me feel angry, and a
little frustrated. If I get to where I can\'t take it, I\'ll stop reading your
posts -- which would be a pity, because you have some good ideas once in a

It\'s my opinion that nothing constructive will come from stirring this subject
up, but I cannot stop it (and wouldn\'t even if I could). I feel the same way
about the other "flame-bates" (big rocks, pirates, usv) that start up from
time to time. 

All I ask is that everything remain reasonably civilized.

I also agree but I would take one note .

I love the Spinward Marches!  We have had many a great game setting there!

At times I think that I live in the Spinward Marches.

Long Live CT & to some extent G:T which is trying to get back to that CT
thing.

From David via e-mail


The Incomparable Lord Garth:

1 The Setup

Before Garth\'s arrival, his entourage arrives. Headed by Retired Rear
Admiral Poof-Dah (his personal attache and interior decorator), the
entourage also consists of Dr. Toady, Dr. Grovel and Dr. Scrape (all
personal assistants) and his security cheif - a bipedal preying mantis type
being. All wear collars with little white lights on them - except for the
rear admiral who is a lifelong friend and every bit as insane as Garth.

The Rear Admiral decides with a glance that "this is just all wrong, it
will not do!" He then proceeds to have the ground crew bring out torches to
carve up the liner to meet the "proper" specifications. Those
specifications include a huge meeting room, office, greeting area, and
quarters for the "special guest."

The entry to the greeting room has no door, but dangling beads instead, as
does the office and quarters - the greeting room is covered in cushy
pillows for lounging about (all very colorful of course). To the left is
the office and then quarters and to the right the meeting room. The
meeting room has a door made of "unknown materials" because it is to be
used for the preliminary negotiations, and security is a top-issue.

The side-effect of these new arrangements is to put all the other PC\'s into
submarine-like cabins with three bunk beds and not much else.

2 Arrival

With much to do, the two other negotiators greet Lord Garth, who is
accompanied by loinclothed men, who have a "crazy" look in their eyes and
are wielding axe-handles menacingly. They also have necklaces with white
lights on them that emit a "voob - voob" sound. They also have
two-pronged head apparatus that emits noxious gas-cloud like fumes
intermittently under their noses - which they proceed to inhale as if it
were the key to their very existence - or an exquisite pleasure.

<<Surely, these couldn\'t be the legendary "madmen". After all, every one
knows madmen can\'t be trained or subdued.>> These two men escort LG
wherever he goes, and stand outside the entrance to the greeting room when
LG is in his quarters.

3 Mysterious goings on

Part A

A round, glowing, pulsating orblike apparatus is placed in engineering, it
is connected to the warp drive and regular drives by mysterious couplings
obviously of "alien origin." <<Perhaps the Engineer sees these before she
is escorted out of engineering.>> Several engineers work
feverishly around the clock turning knobs and adjusting switches on the
mysterious machine.

LG has a matching orb around his neck <<which is perhaps recognized by the
engineer, hence she can alert the whole party of the "secret">>
Part B

LG is seen and overheard screaming at one of his underlings and pointing a
garage-door opener looking device at the preying mantis dude, who\'s collar
goes yellow, then red, then the matis falls to the floor, apparently dead.
<<Perhaps the cyborg sees this and overhears with his "augmented senses" as
he tries to engage the madmen in a conversation (which of course the have
no response to)>> No doubt this incident is also reported to the rest "in
secret" Shortly thereafter LG addresses the crew as to his need for a new
security cheif, as his has met with an unfortunate accident.

Part C

LG conducts his interviews in engineering, having the interviewees place
their hands on the "voob - voob" orb as he asks them questions. <<Perhaps
one of the interviewees notices that the mantis and the original
first-negotiator are lying on a table in the back of the room, surrounded
by Dr. Toady, Scrape, and Grovel - who are feverishly working on the two.>>
LG explains this away as having to perform "autopsy\'s to determine the
source of these unexpected deaths.

Shortly thereafter, two guards wearing black helmets appear, guarding
engineering. Their faces are obscured, but one is obviously a mantis, and
the other dressed in the garb of the negotiators. Both have a funny smell
to them and shamble about when they walk. They are carrying weapons of
"unknown origin." <<perhaps the engineer checks them out while attempting a
conversation with the guard to determine the weapons capacity - she
concludes that they are solid-beam laser weapons, outlawed throughout the
galaxy for thousands of years as, when they are fired they can
theoretically penetrate everything in a straight line for several
light-years before losing their effect>>

Break ----

Fun things for the PC\'s to do while ship is in transit to meeting point.

1) Try to grab/ and or replace the necklace controller with a fake (it sits
on LG\'s desk when not in use.

2) Try to figure out what the hell that thing is in engineering.

3) Vie with one another for the "security cheif" position

4) Try to figure out what the hell those rotting things are guarding
engineering and how to get passed them without them firing their weapons,
which would destroy the ship and anything else in a straight line they was
fired at.

5) Try to get the weapons for themselves - high difficulty as the dead
don\'t have to sleep.

4 The meeting

LG and his two negotiators are set to meet with the three from the other
side in the meeting room, which is sealed do to the nature of the "odd
cultural demands" of the other side. This meeting to take place in space -
before anyone is allowed to the homeworld.
LG enters with the other two on his side, with the other three seated
across a great meeting table. The meeting is surreptitiously transmitted to
the rest of the PC\'s off in another meeting room (anyone who wishes to view
the negotiations). The door slams shut, and LG picks up the
nearest cabin chair, screams and smashes it across the table. The other two
on Garth\'s side are frozen in astonishment, while the three from the other
side calmly look on. LG grabs a leg of the chair, leaps across the table
and jams the leg through the eye of one of the three from the
other side.

Now the two on LG\'s side have wet themselves and are pounding at the door
to get out - the two on the other side calmly look on. Using his
voice-command and special mental powers Garth orders the two twits to sit
down immediately, they comply. He then orders them to give the two
others "the gifts" - which they do. When LG orders the two to sit, the
necklace he wears throbs and makes a Woob - Woob sound, and the ships power
dims a bit as strange noises and shudders are heard and felt from
engineering.

The "gifts" are exquisitely carved boxed which contain rod-lobbers = the
favorite weapon of the others. LG then says to the others, you may have
these - pointing to the two negotiators on his side. Before the two can
even think to run, the others fire the rod-lobbers into the other two\'s
heads. Here the video cuts out.

Note: Rod-lobbers fire two inch thick, eight inch long stainless steel rods
at a rate of 1000 fps - and therefore are short range, but very effective
weapons.

LG and the two negotiators have finished the primary negotiations and
adjourn to the greeting area for cigars and cognac. <<Surely some of the
party rushes to LG\'s quarters to investigate, where they are greeted by the
sight of LG and the others laughing and replaying the events,
slapping each other on the back etc>> The preliminary negotiations have
been VERY successful and the entire ship is invited to visit the home
planet - to have a look around/ get into trouble while LG completes the
negotiations.

5 The planet - the mission

LG briefs the PC\'s on the fact that the others cultural taboos and rituals
seem strange to outsiders, but that he had performed his part of the
greeting ceremony to perfection. Furthermore, for those willing to
volunteer, he will pay handsomely to have a "secret weapon" the others
are developing destroyed. 

This involves breaking into a high-security building, but one in a civilian
area, and thus not guarded by heavy artillery or anything like that. The
volunteers will be given all of the money up front, but the key-code to
release the money will not be given until the mission is complete.
Furthermore, the volunteers will have to wear neck bracelets, signifying
the are under the protection of LG - otherwise they could be imprisoned or
even killed by the others for looking at a person the wrong way, or
spitting on the sidewalk etc (i.e. breaking cultural taboos unknown to
them).

The PC\'s get through the security forces easily enough - racking up
experience points and perhaps getting some minor injuries for their efforts
- - the guards, in the employ of LG are mostly nearsighted, old men, with
powerful weapons, but no real idea of how to aim or fire them
efficiently - thus the entire area is torn to shreds by the action. 

The players find the secret weapon to be a helmet. In the computer banks at
the warehouse they further find that the helmet is an anti-mind-control
helmet. <<Perhaps they consider that this could be the weapon to free
themselves of LG\'s insidious presence>> They decide not to destroy it, but
to hide it. Meanwhile LG has called the authorities who are headed in
sufficient number to apprehend the party at the warehouse. 

6 The showdown

The party is bailed out of jail by LG releasing their promised money, but
to the authorities (after a phone call to confirm the destruction of the
"weapon" of course). <<perhaps the party is now ready for a showdown with
Garth, as the ship is leaving that evening, the negotiations being
over. The party is only charged with LG\'s safety through the negotiations
after all>>

LG awaits whomever is to be the big-man in the meeting room aboard ship. Of
course the cameras are working so the others can observe from a distance
(so as to avoid any mental attacks). The door slams shut after the
combatant <<perhaps that do-gooder cyborg>> enters to face down LG.

LG then uses a remote control to trigger the real use of the helmet, to
fire high-power jets encased in the helmet - hurling the victims head
against the nearest bulkhead. This continues for a bit, as LG enjoys this
type of entertainment! Then, as the party will more than likely be
rushing in to save the Borg (or whomever) - LG is transported out to his
racing yacht - the "Pretty Swift." The ship, leaves the area immediately,
and as is has a reality drive, and is capable of making quadrant-jumps,
there is no hope of the party following, much less even knowing where LG is
off to.

In payment for their efforts, the party also receives a quick and brutal
beating at the hands of the madmen guards, just for sports sake. 

Before LG leaves he sets the remote control to random/active and then
smashes it. For the next several week, or until the party figures out how
to remove the helmet form the victim, his or her head is randomly
propelled, at random intervals, in random directions, until it comes into
contact with something solid.


1) Perhaps some of the party take to the idea of the rod-lobber as a
weapon, they are available on the planet.

2) The necessity to have LG\'s collar remote deactivated (as they don\'t come
off easily) and to be able to shut down his Voob - Voob machine in
engineering before the "showdown" should be obvious enough to the party -
they need to "disable" his powers.

3) The scenario should provide the party with plenty of entertainment,
plenty of experience, and plenty of things to do, and fun doing it all. It
should also aquatint them, those who aren\'t already, with Lord Garth! 


Miscellaneous notes:

The reason LG is always making machines of "alien origin" that supposedly
augment his natural powers is that HE is so insane - perhaps he really
thinks they help! Then again, perhaps he knows just what he is doing.

Security report - Lord Garth, AKA Master of the Universe <<perhaps the
party can get ahold of a copy of this from a "friendly" security official
(or someone they know)>>

Lord Garth is an enigma experienced on thousands of worlds. Wherever he
goes, chaos ensues, but so does change. LG often introduces societies to
new, alien technology, and new ways of thinking - and often leaves those he
encounter either raving mad, or filled with respect - or both. 

He is a true intergalactic playboy, coming and going as he pleases, the
friend of royalty throughout the known (and unknown) worlds. He has as many
enemies as friends, but most that count him an enemy, coincidentally
enough, are no longer among the living.

Most consider him to be a genius - of the insane variety. Among his
callings are Mad-Inventor, Goodwill-Ambassador, and Adventurer. He is
gifted with mental powers that have been discounted by some, but those
"some" are usually also the soon-to-be-dead. 

Note: Garth is to be considered EXTREMELY DANGEROUS and is known to have in
his possession weapons of unheard of origin, and mass-destruction. Once he
gets an idea in his head that an individual, a group of individuals, or a
world is his enemy, the destruction of said party (parties) generally
ensues - often in a most grisly, malignant, and precocious manner - Garth
enjoys playing little "jokes" on people as they die. Beware - make an enemy
of this man at your own risk!

Hope this all gave you a chuckle. I will be available Saturday, as I have
arranged for help for Angela/baby - I look foreword to the Chaos..... no, I
embrace it :)

Holo is good. For purposes of demonstration on a flat screen courtesy of
primitive TL 7-8 the image will be two-dimentional... The more detailed
identification IMTU is encoded on a microprocessor buried inside the card.
Yes the thing is a smart-card, highly encrypted with state-of-the-art
algorithms (TL12 in M0). The readers themselves are not so high-tech (say
TL7 or 8), but the reading software is quite sophisticated and a major
export of Sylea et-all.

What I was more concerned about was what the thing might look like from the
outside.

It doesn\'t matter. That\'s the way it is.  To avoid to the "stigma" of
*Alternate* anything *Official* set after 1130 in Charted Space will have
Virus running around and a bunch of TEDs on planets.  That\'s all that matters
to me.  Hell, i might do an *alternate* thing now and then but if I ever get
delusions of grandeur and want to write a supplement or something *Official*,
it\'ll be on the same timeline as the RC and Regency.

Taken from u?  lol.  "Waaaa haaa, they destroyed MY Imperium?" oh boy, that\'s

dead and Imperium is practically a dirty word, filled w/ venom and loathing.

And in anything *Official* it can\'t be any other way (in Imperial Space
anyways).

More than anything else, Traveller is Jump Drive.  Traveller is Aslan and
K\'kree and meson guns and spinal mounts.   PGMP and misjumps.  I could give a
fig for designs systems and task rules (though i\'ll gladly take TNE over any
other).  The background of Traveller was the life and death of the Imperium.
All things end.  It\'s the way of things.  As they say on Oriflamme, "Life is

Who cares about canon?  I certainly don\'t, and will NEVER run my
campaigns defined in a rigid canon system.  I prefer malleability in a
game.  Besides, having fun is the whole point to all this, so why put
senseless rules on having fun?  No matter what ideas I see on this list,
I\'m still going to pick the ones I like and save them, and just discard
the rest.  Someone else will undoubtedly save some I didn\'t, etc..

And my point is that maybe 100 ton laser bays should wipe out bunches of big
ships.  Meson guns would certainly still have a role (u need a Meson Screen to
counteract it).  Lasers have some drawbacks.  Everyone using lasers will
funnel some serious r&d towards sandcasters (and/or usage of the same).

    Meaning that they would be designs that make sense.  That have a basis in
a psuedo-scientific consistency (FF&S).   Just maybe some of those canon
designs are stupid, like the one in Fighting Ships w/ the "Jump Net" on the
back.  The TL9 Type S scout/courier w/ a J-2 drive.  The TL10 Xboat w/ a J-4
drive.   
    Let\'s do a con sometime... or we\'re figuring out how to do BR Online (w/
your fixes methinks) on the TNE-RCES.  I\'ll let u use lasers above the tl*50
and I\'ll still use spinal mounts and missles.  Lots of missles probably. : )
Set em up and let em drift.  Pop out a couple drones... Damn, BR is fun. lol

Loren was involved w/ TNE.  TNE being a marvelous game would make me look
forward to GURPS: Traveller if it didn\'t have the premise underlying it.  I\'ve
been absolutely disgusted by the TNS entries and the blurbs bout "returning to
the Classic campaigns."   Why couldn\'t the setting have been taken to 1050?
just after the Solomani Rim War?  the Interstellar Wars?  The Civil War?    To
deliberatly thumb the nose at people who started playing RPGs after CT was out
of print?  To go to a "classic" setting, damned timelines didn\'t have to be
split or created...   If G:T would\'ve been set in 1300 or 1400, i\'d probably
be in line to gobble it up, my distate of GURPS rules on the side...

Nope. Laser bays have their uses. Lasers are a way of getting low to medium
amounts of damage at a long distance, in a length-efficient manner - they
have a range function that is essentially dependant on TL and area.

PAWs and Meson guns are effective at getting medium to large amounts of
damage, but are expensive in terms of length - they have a range function
that is essentially a function of length (length squared for meson guns,
length cubed for PAWs).

Now, if we consider a "laser bay" to be a number of 600 MJ lasers under one
master fire controller, they are a cost- and length- efficient way of
dealing a number of lumps of small to medium amounts of damage at combat
ranges.

A while back, I refitted a small ship (the 200 dt FS \'Moonshine\' class Drug
Runner ^k^k^k^k^k^k^k Fast Extraction Ship) into a passable frigate by
adding a pair of small PAWs onto it. The theory was that at ranges within
30kkm, the radiation damage and sand-punching ability of the PAWs would
give it a decisive advantage over other 200 dt ships. I posted it to the
list ... if anyone really wants a copy, I think I still have the email.

Sure, but stutterwarp and ftl gravitons aren\'t. ;-p 

IAC, my herecy isn\'t that I reject orthodox technology or published
background, it is that I *don\'t* reject alternatives.  I enjoy Traveller in
*all* it\'s incarnations.

On a related subject, I\'m *not* going to get involved in the C* debate
raging today, but I am going to say...

For heaven\'s sake, give it a rest! 

There\'s room for every fellow-Traveller on this list, regardless of which
rules, background, system or pizza toppings, he/she/it prefers. I don\'t
care if your version of Traveller conforms strictly to any published work
that bares the Traveller copywrite, or is so divergent that the only thing
that makes it Traveller is the GM saying so, it belongs on THIS list! 

Eris,
    I\'m a heretic,
    Won\'t you be a heretic too?

Works for me. ;->  

You know, I\'ve never had a problem with people calling the hydrogen jump
fuel, whether or not it fuels a power plant, it would be useful "color"
even if it was a misnomer. OTOH, the displacement mass is injected into
jumpspace...and we know that mass/energy is neither created or destroyed,
just transformed, so at least some portion of that mass is *very* likely
transformed from mass into a *whole* lot of energy.  So, all that converted
mass *is* fuel...or at least as much fuel as the wood in a forest is that
is fueling a forest fire.

That\'s the normal view of the jump bubble.  The bubble is a small area of
N-Space enclosing the ship..I have the lanthum grid producing that effect. 
The time in J-Space is something else entirely..I have it relate to the
disipation of the injection mass.

Yep, weren\'t those from Glenn?

I don\'t, because I require interaction that isn\'t automatable after the
ship is cut off from the outside world, but before the ship actually jumps. 
I can see where j-torps and automated ships could be an interesting
variation, though, so if you like them just "go for it."

Makes the idea feel contrived to YOU, David.  Your "honking big fusion
engine" feels contrived to me, and that\'s a friendly dig, not a slam.

I\'m happy with my explanation, it works for me.  I suppose you\'re happy

An inertialess drive like (I\'m going to misspell these names) the

I scanned the ID Cards from the Supplement 12 and MegaTraveller Journal.
But they\'re very big files. (12 Cards from the CT Supplement and 5 from MT
Journal.) As they are from selected services/corporations, I think it
would be time to design new ones (not the MT Journal, which came out
latest. They\'re really good.)

Here for all REFEREES (I read it through the last days):

Challenge 27, Grandfather\'s Worlds.

ca. 290.000 years ago the Regina System had a gas giant in its 5th orbit,
which was rotated out of normal space and ignited. Its three moons were
positioned in equidistant points on an orbit of 30 Mio km around
Braykossa. Each moon contains a different way of observing the new sun,
which is expected to exist about a million years. Yaskoydray hadn\'t been
there again lately.

The inhabitants of Kraldosk (humanoid robots missing the little left
finger) under their human leader Na Kraldosk have later built a way to
the stars by working out some 100 pearls per moon of 100 km diameter
each, which are connected by portals and allow for walking from one moon
to another in about 100 days. (The pearls are ca 1 Mio km from another, so
they had to use transmission portals). The pearls are opaque from outside
and transparent from the inside.

Each pearl is unique, as they are containing either vegetation to provide
food for the pilgrims or have other interesting features, e.g. different
gravitational vectors, are completely air or water-filled, or contain a
labyrinth of stone, quartz or whatever (referee\'s choice)

A model of the String had also been made, which is in fact a remote
control for the pearl portals. It looks like an ordinary collier with
three bigger pearls, about 300 small ones and a clip resembling the
control station. The pearl at which this collier is located, warms
slightly, what can be seen in infrared or on close examination only.
Two pearls of the collier placed near each other allow to traverse their
counterparts immediately. The only way to enter the control station is via
the collier.

By accident some of the animals living in one pearl managed to get into
the neighbouring ones and expand their living space.

The Kraldosk people managed to build a portal leading to the normal space
and now maintain an outpost in a storehouse on regina. They think this is
only another world in their own one. One group now has deserted and will
be pursued from another one.

Adventure Hooks:
A party member will be mistaken for a Kraldoskian and kidnapped to this
world with taking the others with him/her;
The party is approached to help the Kraldoskians and are led to the world;
One person finds the collier and starts an expedition to Braykossa.

The Hidden Regina System.
5    Braykossa (igited Gas Giant)

  30 Elkyulm
  30 Kraldosk
  30 Prissuls

  30 The String (ca. 300 Pearls)
  30 Control Station

I think I\'ll put this information to my Ancients WebSite when I did it
over again. This will be only the first one ....

statement about a "transplanted" AD&D campaign - which personally gives me
the creeps - but if You enjoy it You\'re even free to have Bobby Ewing
become one of Strephon\'s doubles and hunt down Dulinor). I think it has
been Marc\'s intention to provide a powerfull tool (the Traveller rules in
all of their editions) to make SF roleplaying as delightful as possible
(aside from a good deal ;-)).
Hey, there\'s even the possibility to use a different gaming engine (like
the Cthulhu - or the late Cyberpunk rules systems). It simply depends on
Your imagination, the kind of story You\'re willing to tell and the story
Your players are expecting, doesn\'t it?
But to return to GURPS Traveller (I recently purchased the incredible
german version of GURPS Space [more typos than in Tav 4.0 and the lousiest 
translation I\'ve stumbled across up to now] for there\'s been the idea to
create generic german adventuring background...backed by a roleplaying
magazine) the two reasons for me to buy GURPS Traveller would be 
a) my own laziness to create an alternate timeline (\'cause I\'dlike to
confront one of the IRIS supervisiors commanding the security forces of
the Imperial Palace on 132-1116 with completely different setting - where
Lucan doesn\'t want his skin...)
b) the hope - that it will improve the line of GURPS SF books being it at
least in layout and illustration :-) (listen carefully, Loren,I trust in
You)
The truth for Traveller is deeply buried in every Ref\'s head - and the
Canon/canon debate seems futile (whereas the discussions on the list most
of the time proove to be fertile) - so much for a pathetic statement.

should mean freedom of decision in all aspects (just recently there was a
statement about a "transplanted" AD&D campaign - which personally gives me
the creeps - but if You enjoy it You\'re even free to have Bobby Ewing
become one of Strephon\'s doubles and hunt down Dulinor). I think it has
been Marc\'s intention to provide a powerfull tool (the Traveller rules in
all of their editions) to make SF roleplaying as delightful as possible
(aside from a good deal ;-)).
Hey, there\'s even the possibility to use a different gaming engine (like
the Cthulhu - or the late Cyberpunk rules systems). It simply depends on
Your imagination, the kind of story You\'re willing to tell and the story
Your players are expecting, doesn\'t it?
But to return to GURPS Traveller (I recently purchased the incredible
german version of GURPS Space [more typos than in Tav 4.0 and the lousiest 
translation I\'ve stumbled across up to now] for there\'s been the idea to
create generic german adventuring background...backed by a roleplaying
magazine) the two reasons for me
to buy GURPS Traveller would be 
a) my own laziness to create an alternate timeline (\'cause I\'dlike to
confront one of the IRIS supervisiors commanding the security forces of
the Imperial Palace on 132-1116 with completely different setting - where
Lucan doesn\'t want his skin...)
b) the hope - that it will improve the line of GURPS SF books being it at
least in layout and illustration :-) (listen carefully, Loren,I trust in
You)
The truth for Traveller is deeply buried in every Ref\'s head - and the
Canon/canon debate seems futile (whereas the discussions on the list most
of the time proove to be fertile) - so much for a pathetic statement.
Travel high or low - but travel

Mass is a property of matter, as charge is, too.
Weight is not, it is a *force*, depending on mass and gravitation.

I use Word 6.0. But I think the importation capabilities depend upon the
drivers included and installed. So I can import .dxf, but no .pdf, if I do
not go wrong ...

The best way to solve this problem seems to be to include more than one
format: .dxf/.wmf for windows platforms, .pdf for Adobe users, .eps for
Ghostview users. That would leave everyone with a possibility to work with
this.

And now for something completely different:

\'Cause a) an MT/TNE less universe would appeal to many (not me of course)

before the book comes out rather than introducing alternate timelines
later in the piece ;)

Those rods work out as a bit over 3 *kilos* each. And at 300 m/s,
that\'s gonna have the recoil from *hell*. As in giving a 100 kilo

Dave has interpreted my meaning spot on. As an example witness the
spreading flames on the validity of GURPS Traveller. IMNSHO all the
variants of Traveller are valid - we just need to be careful not to wind
people up by phrasing comments ineptly.

On reflection, my original post was phrase ineptly, for which i apologise.

a) GURPS is an alternate timeline. Not the central one. Marc has said
so. Loren has said so. The SJG site says so. Knowing Loren, the book
will mention it at least once.

b) Breaking "canon" and/or changing the setting. Its been done three
times before. I\'m a CT player...and I haven\'t been real fond (or not as
fond) of the versions that followed. Personally, TNE made me mad, by
invalidating a great deal of the stuff that I held dear. I didn\'t like
the rules, the tech, the setting. In a big way for me, it was not really
Traveller......so what!!! Its a game. I muttered a little to myself, and
life went on...I used a few things from MT and TNE, but cheerfully went
on in the CT setting.

The point is, we should all be adults about this. GURPS Traveller, even
if it ends up being the "only" published Traveller, will no more kill
CT, MT, TNE or T4 for the people that use such systems...anymore than
TNE really "killed" CT...just play what you want to play.

Finally, I resent the implication that some have made that one of the
versions (either CT, MT, TNE, or T4) are inherently "better" and "more
canon" that the others. That is a matter of OPINION, nothing more. GURPS
Traveller will excite some people. It will piss others off. I would ask
the latter group to be mature about it, and voice their concerns in a
rational manner, while still politely encouraging their favorite
version.

For the record...I am guardedly optimistic about GT...I will rreserve
final judgement till I read it.

Well, IG may fold, just as GDW (rest their souls) did.  With as many of
us who are clearly passionate about Traveller in ALL its incarnations,
the game will survive.  I, for one, am not worried about it!

If we\'re honest with ourselves, I think we all do this.  

To quote the first rule of engineering:  If it works, use it!!!

The second rule of engineering:  If it doesn\'t, you beat on it till it
does!!

Hopefully, I will have my campaign background up on my web page soon.  It
is very non-canon, so it will be interesting to see what comments come
around.  (And everyone please know, I always welcome comment, even
negative!!)

Don\'t feel bad, most pages are under constant re-fit, at least.  My page
is my first as well, and I can never find the time to add to it as often
as I\'d like, so its rather sparse right now.

Prizes;

The following rules shall be in effect for operatives of Oberlindes acting
under a Letter of Marque.

When a prize is captured its value will be computed based on either net
salvage, or net sales price (after repair and crew medical or final costs
have been deducted) and shared with the capturing crew as follows;

50 shares to Oberlindes lines
10 shares to the overall Commanding Officer
5 shares to any subordinate Vessel Commanders, or troop leader of captain\'s
rank or higher.
2 shares each to the Vessel Executive officer and subordinate leader of any
troop contigent
1 share for each officer
1/3rd of a share for each non-officer present.

If a subcontractor is hired, shares equal to the above values shall be
awarded to the subcontractor en masse for them to share out as they see fit.

"Commanding Officer" shall apply tot he highest ranking leader of forces
within 5 light minutes.  Company officers take precedence over hired
forces, and ship captains over troop force captains.

In the event that an prize share recipient is rendered unconcious, their
share shall not be reduced.  If a prize recipient, through the
incapacitance of their superior, fulfills the role of a higher prize
category position, they shall be awarded the higher prize value, even if,
after action, they are returned to their prior position.  Note that any
such role must be filled in a legally correct manner.

Prize money is forfeit inthe event of violation of any of the Garushang
Agreements or for violations of company rules which jusify dismissal.

Prize recipients may choose to take their award in the form of cash, or in

I haven\'t seen any development of Islands Cluster done since Trillion Credit

appearance? Does no one know?

I built a TCS fleet for Sansterre in Islands Cluster (the Royal Sansterrean 
Navy), one thing I did was take some of the 10% of the fleet that had to 
be a tech level lower and made a cargo ship class that could use multiple jumps and make it from Islands to the Spinward Marches - I figured that even
if it operated at a loss, such a trade route would be a great advantage to
the people of Sansterre. The ship is all fuel, though...

No kidding! Folks, am I the only one to take note that having _two_
detailed backgrounds for the Imperium can provide double (at least)
the adventure opportunities? Who cares what the background is?
Wasn\'t that the whole point behind Marc\'s different Milieus that
most people thought would be a good idea?

How about a group of adventurers jumping at 10 diams while in
the middle of a slugfest with Lucan\'s forces only to come out of
Jumpspace in a universe in which the Rebellion never occurred?

Or, better yet, *give* \'em a light cruiser just after the 5th Frontier
War and have \'em misjump into the New Era universe.

Or how about letting the players be the ones discover a plot
to kill the Emperor, blow up a certain Duke\'s shuttle, then
read about it in an official TNS release from SJG? The
"cool" factor of just such an event can\'t be beat!

Isn\'t it the gamemaster\'s responsibility to ensure the 
_players_ (i.e. your friends) have fun? Jeez. Marc,
Loren, you guys keep putting out the stuff that\'s helped
me make some good times with my friends and I\'ll
keep buying it. I couldn\'t care less about which
background it\'s about. By the way, you two, thanks
so very, very much for all the years of fun! You would
be amazed as to what effect Traveller has had on some
people\'s lives (including mine).

That is just as damaging to "canon" as any unmanned Xboat then.  It has
basically the same effect as starship automation...  Having NPCs doing
something that the players should do.

Well, this is one of those things that everybody has their own opinions on.
 First off, I\'m not really a fan of the GURPS rules set, so right off, so
any "rules" (character generation or otherwise) will mean nothing to me. 
Second, a big part of Traveller (to me) is the character generation system.
 That is the one thing that stuck out the most to me when I saw CT for the
first time (and the main thing that pissed me off when it came to TNE).

But that\'s merely my opnion.

On the other hand, I think everybody has to take a deep breath here and
relax.  If GURPS Traveller, or Virus, or any other Traveller concept or
item gets you so damned pissed off...  You should probably get out a bit
more or at the very least relax a little bit.

Canon is nothing when it comes down to it.  It was something that was
invented by a group of folks (mostly like you or me) that they thought
would be a good background to play in.  I\'m sure none of them ever thought
that years later there\'d be people treating the background they wrote for
their adventures and for their articles in the JTAS as the word of God.  In
some cases, that\'s what you people sound like.

Who cares if something was validated in a really hard-to-get, out of print
book that\'s ten+ years old???  Most likely, whoever wrote it wrote it so
his gaming group could have fun.  It just happened to get published.  If
20+ years of published history means that nothing new can be added, and
there has to be bad feelings if something gets invalidated in any way then
maybe some people need something more in their life besides Traveller.

Up until the last couple years I didn\'t own a lot of Traveller books.  Back
then, the fun of Traveller was rolling up characters, rolling up countless
starsystems and trying to figure out how come an Atmosphere 0 world has
10,000,000,000 inhabitants, while right next door and Atmosphere 6 world
has 10.  There was no concept of canon for me then.  There were some
scattered Library Entries and a couple of pages on the major "canon"
topics: jump drive, the 3I, megacorps, the Xboats...  But I wanted to play
the game as I wanted to play.  Then, and now I will freely throw out canon
if I feel it is stupid, or if I feel my ideas are better...

Canon makes many on this list completely rigid and inflexible.  Is it my
fault that the GDW people were writing their supplements before the full
effects of computers on the future could really be gauged?  Is it my fault
that they didn\'t put faith that computers would be capable of automating
many functions of starships???  Nope.  Is it my fault that DGP painted a
vast sweep of the future while certain concepts didn\'t exist yet, or
weren\'t as well known?  Nope.

The problem is that the world is a completely different place than it was
20 years ago when GDW did most of their work, or 10 years ago when DGP did.
 To me, the canon view of Solomani is a hilarious charicature born out of
the days of late cold war paranoia.  The views of all the races, human or
otherwise, are really just as shallow as adding wrinkly foreheads so the
television viewing audiences can tell the difference between one race and
another.

It\'s just more "valid" because this is _our_ rpg, and we think that we have
more of a handle on culture and hard science...  When in reality, the
handle we have on hard science boils down to exactly the same kind of
handwaving and after-the-fact explanations as to why the modern view of the
future is wrong and someone\'s view of the future 20 years ago was right. 
Our handle on culture boils down to sweeping generalizations and
charicatures or the other end of the spectrum to niggling little details
about individual races that are just oh-so-clever...

Just keep repeating to yourself that it\'s only a game...  It\'s only a
game...  You are free to do with this game whatever you want.  Be as
creative or as rigid as you want.  However, when all is said and done, it
isn\'t reality.  Nobody here lives in the Imperium.  Nobody here has the
capability to predict the way the future\'s really going to be, and I\'ll be
willing to bet it\'ll look nothing like any of the versions of Traveller
that we\'ve seen.

Yes, actually, there is some stuff in the Regency Sourcebook about these
subsectors.

Not alot of info.  About a page and a half of background with a short
timeline, and a page of subsector data.  Not very meaty, but there has been
some work done.

it seems to be 4-.  My edition of CT is so old there is no Lo code.  :)

I suppose that the argument could be made that the worse conditions in
most of Charted Space during TNE means small worlds don\'t have the big
Imperial economic net to fall back on, so bigger worlds are Lo coded.
Does anyone else have other references for Lo being one way or another?

Not really, if done right.  Since paying a faceless broker is fairly
standard in trade campaigns, why not flesh them out a little and make them
NPCs?  I\'ve been thinking of loosely basing a broker in my Lunion campaign
on Londo Mollari from Babylon 5.. that should be fun.

The advantage is that eventually you can use the well known NPC as an
adventure hook.  When the players arrive to discover the broker\'s office
empty, his home ransacked, and a mysterious message left in their drop box...

Note the word "often."  When my players bring this up, I ask them "would
you trust a robot to perform surgery on you?  Hoping that the guy who
programed it included all the possible scenarios?"

A modern example of the truely terrifying possibilities of GIGO is the Sgt.
York Air Defence Gun.  Designed to be computer controlled, the vehicle\'s
radar was designed to home in on rotating blades (like a helicopter) and
engage them.  At the demostration, the radar ignore the big, fat drone
hovering directly in front of it, and instead slewed the turret around
(bringing half the Pentagon brass into deadly peril) and instead engaged
the exhaust fan on a latriene.  You see, the program only knew to look for
rotors as the appeared from directly beneath...

>"So why do spaceships need a pilot and sensors guy?

The same reason airliners need a crew.  To handle the very tricky bits like
take-off and landing, and to handle any emergenices.

Let them.  Then introduce a bug.  The jump drive is seriously out of whack,
but the engineering sub-routine that monitors that particular element has a
flaw that has caused it to just keep telling the main status board that
everything is just fine.  The missile launcher swears it fired a missle,
and detonation will occur in five minutes, but the missile and it\'s nuclear
warhead, are still nestled snuggly in the launch rack.

The computer could replace the astrogator for a short time, but having a
human to double check always helps.  A friend of mine is an instructor at
Ft. Benning GA.  He teaches land navigation to would-be infantry officers.
His favorite trick is to let us the GPS unit until they are in the middle
of nowhere, then take away the batteries..  He says that watching the
canidates struggling to remember how to read a map and use a compass is
quite amusing.

>Is there in-jump maintenance?
>   -are there jumpgrid stability issues?

IMTU, Jump is a time to do the books, maitain non-critical items that
aren\'t directly involved with maintaining jump or life support, and other
things that detract from adventuring when they reach the planet.

>Astrogator : fiddles with the flight plans?
>             station-keeping tasks in jump?

The Astrogator is more the jump pilot.  He keeps a close watch on all the
effects of jump, on both ship and crew, and watches the sensors as breakout
approches to try and estimate when the ship will re-enter real space.

>Pilot      : fiddles with the maneuver controls + jump field?

During jump, the pilot should be reading up on the target system (shipping
regulations, prohibited refueling points, etc..) and doing maitainence.  He
also should be rubbing elbows with the passengers.

>Engineer   : fiddles with the drives?

The manuver drive, and also with non-critical systems that can be repaired
from inside.

>Sensor     : ?

Nothing to do.  So most ships hire a senor operator who also can act as
ship\'s steward.

>Captain    : fiddles with the crew\'s minds?

Does the books.  Prepares the monthly payment, or report to the owners,
figures the exact profit, updates the ship\'s fund, goes through news
reports looking for hints for what to buy on the target world, rubs elbows
with the passengers.

These things are activities that, while they need to be done, don\'t really
make good role-playing fodder.  (Ref: "OK Dave, your astrogator is on duty,
what do you do?"  Dave: "Since we might break out of jump today, I\'m
watching the sensors for eight hours.")

   I\'m not sure why you see it that way, but then I have noted that I tend
to speak my mind when I would probably best be served keeping my big yap
shut (ancient American slang phrase), so what the heck, let\'s make it
double, I\'m not driving home tonight.

   The legimate *Storyline Canon* legacy of classic Traveller is
MegaTraveller.  That is as it was and will always be.  If Loren wants to
write an interesting variant that goes in another direction, on principle
that\'s fine with me.

   As I have noted to various individuals in the past, if I could be given
the ability to time travel, one of the many stops I would make would be to
Normal, Illinois in 1986 to convince Loren, Marc, Frank, et al not to write
anything that would destroy the Imperium.  Story-wise, there were a lot of
other directions to go that would have accomplished what MegaTraveller set
out to do without all the damage.  Failing that, my next stop would have
been back to Normal, Illinois in 1992 to convince Dave Nilsen, Frank, Loren
et al that while the TNE mechanics were worth doing, the New Era storyline
would work much better if it took place in the context of a setting that was
further along in its recovery.  I would also humbly suggest that Virus be
put to a few college Computer Engineering profs over at Illinois State for
reality checking or better yet some other explanation for the Collapse be
thought up.

   **All that said**, those were not my creative calls to make, and I accept
in its entirety the basic Storyline Canon as published by GDW.

>"Legitimacy" (whatever that means) is a non-sequitur to me.  I
>prefer CT and (hopefully) G:T over MT and TNE -- that\'s it.

   Why have a "legitimate" storyline?  As previously stated, unlike AD&D and
other games, we as a collection of Traveller fans do not have the game
mechanics to unite us--we are \'we\' because we have this shared story about
something called the \'Known Universe\'.  Take that foundation away and we are
nothing but a collection of sci-fi RPG fans that spell \'Traveller\' funny
(apologies to those in the UK).  You prefer that portion of the timeline
that revolves around the Third Imperium--cool.  It is a neat place to
adventure.  I prefer to do things later down the timeline--also cool (for
me).  The G:T Variant while perhaps interesting to some, is not part of the
shared story.

>I will crow with joy from now until doomsday that CT fans will

   The background that "CT fans know and love" never went away--at least the
GDW Secret Police never came by my house to confiscate my classic Traveller
collection--people to this day are using MT and TNE game mechanics to play
in the "classic" setting.

   As for the balance of your comments, that is just what I was referring to
in my previous post--an attitude that there is something being "won" here by
the CTers.  I seem to recall similar statements of victory in 1996 by
others, followed by the usual denunciations when what was presented as "the
Messiah" didn\'t live up to the lofty expectations of those proclaiming victory.

   My comments were directed at those hard-core CTers who treat *everything*
published after 1986 as though it were some sort of heresy (forgetting that
there was a great deal revealed in MT and TNE (even "T4", when it isn\'t
contradicting GDW\'s work) that is of relevance to the classic Traveller
setting).  By trumpeting G:T, they show their hypocrisy.

   Like I said, I wasn\'t aware that anyone was forciably removing classic
Traveller material from people\'s homes.  I\'m glad they missed me.  As for
"continuing to grow", how?  All that Loren has done is snipped a bit off the
Traveller tree and grafted on to GURPS.  That\'s not the same thing.
Continuing to write material for the classic setting involves writing about
events, people, places or things that are around before the events of
1116--G:T covers events after that.

>If MT and TNE fans get more background for their preferred

   As will we...of course some of us are continuing the storyline and
background development of TNE (and MT and CT) without the help of an
Imperium Games or a SJG.

   You\'re missing the point--I didn\'t say that anyone should be forced to
like TNE or even use the accompanying background story--merely acknowledge
that there is something called Storyline Canon and that it includes *all*
the material published by GDW, not just those parts you prefer.  What people
run in their own campaigns is their own business.  Storyline Canon provides
us with a set of common reference points that IMHO are vital to the
Traveller community at large.

   But Traveller has grown beyond that definition to include additional
story development and background material.  It is no appropriate to define
Traveller just by the material presented in classic Traveller than it is the
define a long running television series by a single episode or a single season.

   Nick I respect how you feel about this subject, but it\'s just not true.
G:T is going to be by definition *GURPS*.  That Loren wants to introduce
GURPS players to Traveller is wonderful and what he has planned should make
for interesting reading for both GURPS and Traveller players alike.  But it
is not classic Traveller reborn.

   \'Radar flashlight\' detects human presence through walls,

 A prototype RADAR flashlight that can detect a human\'s presence through
walls and doors should one day make law-enforcement officers\' jobs safer.
The patent-pending device uses a radar and a specialized signal processor
to detect movement by discerning respiration from up to 3m away. No
physical connection exists between the subject and radar. The development
is part of a family of technologies that also detects heartbeat, according
to Gene Greneker, a principal research scientist at the Georgia Tech
Research Institute (GTRI). "Based on respiration signature alone, the
flashlight allows us to detect a stationary individual behind a solid
wooden door, or standing four feet behind an eight-inch block wall,"
Greneker explains. The device uses a narrow radar beam of about 15 to 20
degrees to detect body movement generated by breathing. Other potential
applications include: locating people in a room during a hostage
situation, and finding survivors in the rubble of earthquakes or
accidents. "

wow! A life-form detector! Uhh is that TL-15 or 16? Maybe
he-whose-name-is-not-to-be-uttered was right. The Rule of Man _was_

(Yeah, yeah, yeah...I can think of a number of ways this thing can be
spoofed right off the bat, too...a $29 radar detector would tell you
you\'re being probed, and jamming it wouldn\'t be all that much harder.)

   The short answer is that is isn\'t a big deal.  The more people playing
any of the above and less AD&D or Magic: The Ripoff, the better.

   I would defend the right of any referee to insert into his own
"homegrown" campaign little orange people that eat Vargr and terrorize the
Imperium with their constant references to Strephon as "a big puff pastry",
just as I would defend the MegaTraveller storyline from those who would
rather it become "just another possible canon storyline".

>Time for everyone to just relax and get back into perspective...

   I think it is important to remember that the discussions about canon,
Canon, Storyline Canon, etc. are at a level above those that have apparent
significance to the average referee or player, but they are important,
because we are talking about the soul of Traveller.

Harold

   Well that clears up the question as to whether or not SJG would be
interested in publishing a TNE-storyline related sourcebook (the answer it
seems is a flat \'no\').  There had been some debate about that on the TNE-list.

   One always enters these things hoping that everyone can debate without
making it personal--attacking ideas with facts and logical tools and not
resorting to attacking the people behind the ideas.  It rarely happens here,
but one hopes.

Most Adobe Products will generate them (Illustrator, Acrobat Exchange,

That\'s true.  I\'ve got enough Trav stuff to play the rest of my life.  I\'ll
probably never play it all.

But, I am tired of playing a broken game system.  I\'ve got this
mis-matched, stuck together rules system incorporating the best parts of
each of the four editions.  Actually, it\'s the T4 system, using my task
system and the best things from the other three systems.

I\'m tired of always having to fix something.  Traveller takes so much
work.  I love the setting and the universe--that\'s why I\'ve stuck with
it--but it takes so much damn time to play a game of Traveller as opposed
to some other RPGs.

I could just pick a system--say, the CT system--and exclusively play with
that, but I have a problem in that I think the T4 system is the best one
yet (after you fix what needs fixing--like the task system).  So, I\'m
unhappy with any of the Traveller systems as is.

This is why I was so looking forward to T4.1.  My hopes were to get it,
read it, and be so pleased with it that I would use it
exclusively--adapting all other Traveller material to it.

Now, it looks like T4.1 won\'t be published.

I pulled out my Star Wars game stuff last night--now, there\'s a game.  It\'s
simple, clean, and probably one of the best game systems on the market.

It\'s a different type of game than Traveller, a Space Opera as opposed to
Hard Core Science Fiction, but the books and supplements are put together
so well.

They are easy to understand.  They look great.  And, you don\'t get all of
the contradictory rules and bugs that has plagued Traveller\'s four
editions.

I can pick up the one rule book for Star Wars, read it, and begin playing
without many of the problems I have with Traveller.

As a matter of fact, I haven\'t felt good about Traveller rules since the
DGP days--that was the only company, IG included, IMNSHO, which made
quality Traveller stuff.

Traveller, for me, is a case of the love of the universe outweighing the
dislike for the many thrown together, non-compatible rules systems the game
has had.

From the looks of things, I\'d say Traveller\'s designers feel the same way.
They don\'t improve the game within the Traveller line.  They just design an
entirely new game and slap Traveller\'s name on it.

Look at all the systems:  CT, MT, TNE, T4, GURPS.  They are all different
animals.

If you look at Star Wars (or AD&D for that matter), it\'s second edition was
a vast improvement over its predecessor (as was AD&D over D&D and AD&D
Second Edition over regular AD&D) AND it built on the success of the
previous game--NOT INVENT THE WHEEL ALL OVER AGAIN.

With Star Wars, I noticed last night, that I can pick up one of the many
adventure modules in print, read it, and simply plug in the PC\'s and roll.
Like AD&D, everything I need to run that adventure is at my finger
tips--NPC\'s, vehicles, ships, deck plans, building drawings, etc.

The point here is that, as a GM, I can choose how much work to put into the
game.  I can just read the adventure and run it as is, or I can be a busy
little GM, change things around, and work as much as I want to customize
the adventure.

Star Wars adventures are like those good old AD&D modules--just plug and
play.

With a Trav adventure (most of the time), I\'ve got to do a lot of
work--roll up adversaries and NPC\'s, create deck plans and building
floorplans, use vehicles and ships created with non-standardized design
systems....etc...WHAT A HEADACHE!

Let\'s fact it.  We are not in high school anymore where we can spend all
week on our games and play the weekend.

What is all of this rambling boiling down to?

Quality.

I believe the Traveller systems--all of them, not just T4--have a quality
problem.  Gamers know this--they know games, and they know when something
is not right.

I don\'t find myself tweaking with other games as much as I do with
Traveller.  I play AD&D pretty much straight out of the book.  I play Star
Wars, straight out of the book.  I play James Bond, straight out of the
book.

As a matter of fact, I can\'t think of one games system that I have put as
much work into.

Why?

I didn\'t think that they needed it.

Oh, sure.  There\'s a quick fix here and there.  All GM\'s that I know of do
this.  But, usually, for me, this is nothing more than a couple of pencil
marks in the margin.

No so with Traveller.  I have reams (litterally) of paper printed out with
rules fixes and rules replacements because I don\'t think what I buy from
Traveller\'s various publishers is good enough.

Other game companies can do it--why can\'t they do it for Traveller?

I want to buy a Traveller product again and feel like I\'m getting my
money\'s worth.  I want DGP quality products.

And, I want a Traveller rules product that makes me want to use it as
is--not start fixing everything that is wrong with it.

In this regard, T4 has been a big dissappointment.  I\'ve noticed several
long time veterans to this list get disgusted and leave (myself included).

There just comes a point where it is not worth arguing anymore, and you
pack up and leave.

In my opinion, this is why T4 is failing.

I hope IG does get it\'s act together.  I hope they start producing product
again--but at this point they should start T6.

They should put together all of the old Traveller editions, pick the best
of each system, and incorporte it all into one, big, great, awesome
Traveller rules system.

If they do this, and start producing with the quality of DGP, they might
have a shot.

But, I don\'t think this will happen.  And, I think I\'m going to go play
Star Wars.

IMTU, the "metal worlds are the subject of rival claims from the Imperium
and the Sverdaheimssambandid (what you weaklings call the Sword Worlds).
The min strtegic drive of the SWC is to seize a buffer zone of worlds in
the lunion subsector, and cut off the x-boat route to the Five Sisters,
while aiding the various independence movements.

My history will have a much tougher fight against the Zhodani, leaving the
Lunionese on their own.  Several worlds will be occupied by the SWC, and
the provide endless fun as traders try and make a buck there.

This all a long way off, since the characters have to survive the events
leading up to the war and the war itself.

Funny, I get something very different:

ME = 1/2 * M * V^2
   = 1/2 * 3 * 300^2 (approx.)
   = 1/2 * 3 * 90000

BTW this gives a damage in TNE/FF&S1 of 24.

In a Challenge Dave Nilsen said that the reason Lo pop went up to 4 in TNE
was that it was felt that a few 10s of thousands of people on a whole

think) running a planet was kind of scary.

Harold, I am a big fan of your work. I\'ve enjoyed your articles in Traveller
Chronicle, and you\'ve always been, in my opinion, an intelligent participant
on this and other lists. So please don\'t take this the wrong way...

Soul of Traveller?

Traveller is a game. Period. It is without a doubt my favorite game, and in
my opinion the best RPG that is/has been/will be. But I think the
terminology "soul of Traveller" is spreading it a bit thick. There is no one
thing that you can point to in any of the versions that can be carried
through the other versions as a "theme" or "soul"...they are all so
different.

In a lot of ways, each version so far has been an entirely new game. Sure,
there are common threads - perhaps they have more in common than different.
But so much changed between each one too. On this list we find plenty of
people that carry aloft the flag of their version which is *right*, for
whatever reason.

If we took a poll, what would people give for their preferences:
  a) Are jump torpedos allowed?
  b) Do you have to have crew in ships?
  c) Was strephon assassinated?
  d) Which do you use, HEPlaR or thrusters?
  e) Do ships have High Energy Weapons and Repulsors?
  f) Are missiles contact weapons?
  g) Do Hivers like corndogs?
  h) Is the Imperium pro-psionic, or anti-psionic?
  i) Are the Zhodani our friends, or enemies?
  j) etc...

If we each describe "our Imperium" the descriptions will be quite
varied...so what IS this so called "soul of Traveller"...

I\'ve tried this as well, the URL goes to the geocities pages, but if you
go through geocities neighborhoods sections, you can reach it.  Something

Rules-wise, I\'ve had very few problems with Traveller.  I play T4 straight
out of the book, with Mr. Miller\'s improved T4.1 task system as opposed to
the original.  The game flows very well, and the rules are a compliment, as
opposed to a hindrance to our playing.

Keep in mind that Star Wars is one of the hottest franchises in history,
and as a consequence it has the ability to draw in tons of cash.  This
means there\'s alot more money going into things like R&D and playtesting.

Again, when you have alot of money to spend, you can hire better layout

Well, considering the fact that DGP didn\'t publish a Traveller rules set,
this is a moot point.

I won\'t look at Star Wars, as I don\'t have much experience with it.  D&D
and AD&D, however, I have much experience with and am a little more
qualified to compare.  Okay, look at D&D\'s original 3 rule books (the
digest-sized tan ones), and then look at AD&D.  They\'re alot more different
than you\'d think.  The entire game got a complete rules overhaul. 
MegaTraveller did basically the same exact thing.  It kept certain ideas
from Traveller, and expanded on them and tried to make them a little more
robust and a little more clear.  Maybe some parts backfired, and maybe GDW
weren\'t really ready to do it when they did.

There are some minor differences between Traveller and MegaTraveller, but I
hardly think that GDW re-invented the wheel anymore than TSR did when they
created AD&D.  Modern day AD&D would look almost completely alien to
someone who had just purchased the little tan books, more alien than MT and
T4 would look to someone who just picked up the little black books for the
first time.

You\'re right.  Everyone knows the Star Wars universe.  Everyone knows the
way things worked in the middle ages.  You don\'t need as much background to
run either game.  Your players have probably seen Star Wars, or they\'ve
probably read fantasy books and stories.  The need for sourcebooks to
create a coherent universe isn\'t as important, it\'s a bonus.  Traveller
doesn\'t have that advantage.  Sure, you can point to the Alien series and
say "That\'s what low-berth looks like," or you can conjure images from
Blade Runner when filling in the PCs on what an overpopulated mainworld
looks like...  But there\'s no one body of work to point to and say, "Hey,
this is Traveller!"

I do this with all adventures for all RPGs I run.  I can\'t stand published
adventures myself.  This is a case of different strokes for different
folks.

Yes, and AD&D has 25 years of rules tweaking behind it, not to mention that
it\'s basically the leader in the RPG world.  AD&D has the advantage that
most role-players are broken in on it.  It is hellishly complicated and
top-heavy, but works because it\'s the common RPG "language".

As I stated, I can\'t really comment on Star Wars as I don\'t have any
playing experience with it.  James Bond, on the other hand, is both over
complicated and simplistic (at least the ol\' VG version I have).  However,
it is interesting to note that both systems are based on extremely popular
movies.  The players already come into the games with an idea of what their
PCs can and cannot do...

Want to know the truth of why T4 is failing?  White Wolf, TSR, other
companies, they all learned this one simple truth about the role-playing
world...

New blood.

You\'ve got to get new players hooked on your game or you\'ve lost entirely. 
T4 has a dated look about it.  T4\'s technology has a dated feel about it. 
Sure, many on the list are happy that T4 has a retro 50s-70s sci-fi feel. 
That\'s not what new role-players are into.  TSR has the advantage, as I
stated, that they are the game that most new role-players cut their teeth
on.  White Wolf has the advantage that they came along and made
role-playing "cool".  Star Wars has the advantage of name recognition, so
it\'s easy for them to pick up new players.

Traveller has no advantage in this field.  Traveller is trying to pander to
a user base that is shrinking every day.  That\'s the horrible truth.  I\'ve
already lost users in my campaign because they didn\'t like the dated feel
of the game.

In a related note, a couple years ago (late 80s/early 90s) I had a friend
who went to an RPG convention.  They were breaking in several new ideas for
the AD&D line.  My friend saw the TSR guy in the parking lot and commented
that long term AD&D players might be turned off by the fact that most of
the new AD&D stuff had no real depth...  The TSR guy responded, "Well, if
they go, there\'ll be plenty more pimply 13 and 14 year olds to take their
place."

(I also want to note that I have nothing against AD&D or TSR.  Since WotC
has taken other, they seem to have made a complete turn around, and have
been putting out some really high-quality stuff)

When did T5 come out?  Why didn\'t anyone tell me?

They should go back to basics (like T4 did) and make a simple, easy to use
system that has plenty of room for expansion.  They should modernize the
look and feel of the game.  And, yes, they should publish with a consistent
quality.  They need a new user base.  They can\'t keep pandering to a
role-playing market that, statistically, probably doesn\'t really exist
anymore.  This isn\'t meant to offend any of the old heads on the list.  I
think that this is just a cold, hard fact of life.  Most role-players are
in the high-school/college age group, especially most new role-players.  I
seem to be on the younger end of the Trav statistics on the TML (22 years
old).  All of my players are pretty young (20, 22, 23, 24, 27) and none of
them would have touched Traveller if it wasn\'t for me getting them
involved.

T4 started to do some good things (placed less emphasis on the military end
of the Traveller world, tried to encourage role-playing opportunities for
things other than "merchants and mercs" type campaigns), but it still has a
dated look and feel.

I guess I really didn\'t make myself clear, or I misunderstood the post that
I responded to.

I had said that if you automated Xboats, you still have a reason to have
people on board a multi-purpose, privately owned trade-ship (ie, a Free
Trader).  At each stop, you need someone onboard that can make deals with
brokers, sell high, buy low, find passengers, and all that good stuff.

Someone responded that you wouldn\'t, because you\'d have agents all along
the trade route that could handle the cargo and do all of this.  I restated
that I meant _Free Traders_ as in the lifestyle, as opposed to to the free
trader ship class.  My understanding of free traders is that they go from
world to world, talk to brokers, make deals, and continue on.  This sounds
what like you are saying.

I don\'t think, however, that Free Traders have _employees_ on each world to
do the dirty work of buying and selling for them.  This is where Megacorps
and such come in.  Automating Megacorp ships is no big deal, as they will
have almost no effect on PCs.  Leaving out automation means that you have
to make up a handwave as to why it\'s left out.  Adding automation means
that either a.] the player\'s ships are automated and they have no ability
to adventure in this framework (unacceptable) or b.] there are certain
limits on automation, ie, Xboats and big cargo ships are automated
completely, while scout ships, free traders, military vessels, and many
passenger ships are not.  At least to me, the reasons are perfectly sound.

box...

I agree entirely.  This doesn\'t seem to be the original point of contention
though.  There\'s no reason that you can\'t have cool stuff like this and
have Xboats automated though.  There are plenty of grey areas.  It\'s not
like "Xboats are automated, so all ships are obviously automated!"  In the
real world, we have cruise missiles that are completely automated, but we
have airplanes that aren\'t.  We have passenger planes that are mostly
automated, and other planes that have almost no automation at all.  There
is a wide spectrum of automation in the world right now.  Several groups
are working on putting built in automation into cars to help deal with
traffic flow.  Our bank tellers are automated.  Our factories are automated
in many cases.  Our phone lines are automated.

This doesn\'t mean that every single thing in our world that can be
automated is, just like automated Xboats don\'t mean that every ship in the
Imperium is either.

Nevermind.  This is a really pointless argument that has probably gone on
far too long.

   Generic Task / Game systems - I have a dislike of generic
game systems in general as they do not add the unique flavour

   I shall always remember Traveller as the game in which the
Game Master will utter "Two Dice" for a task test.  And who
sometimes reverted to shouting "Two Dice" in the middle of
a Chivalry and Sorcery Game.  So the impact of "Two Dice" 
Traveller is very profound and has an almost mystical level
to it.  Strange how customs and traditions can get to become
established around a roleplaying system.

Well, I was partially trying to speak more generally.  Also, not
needing life support will make them cheaper.  Finally, it raises
the issue of automatic cargo carriers (whether corporte or not)
and PC\'s having ships that can jump and land themselves.  (etc.)

But you know they are crewed.  And if we had robotic ships you would
know.  And you (or at least I) am not someone who has even sailed
as a passenger on the seas.  PC\'s that actually operate a ship
would be well aware of this issue.

I can\'t believe this discussion. As far as I am concerned, Traveller is a 
set of rules for playing a Space-Opera style of Science Fiction game. 
Both CT and MT had decent qualities that you could separate out the 
game from the milieu. T4 failed at this and I have never seen TNE. 

I don\'t understand why referees can\'t deal with a little change. Of course
this is the attitude that a gaming company would appreciate, complete
unwavering loyalty to product sales rather than creativity. 

I think that its great that GURPS is taking on Traveller. I wish they
would license the rules too. Steve Jackson Games has one agenda, making 
money from games. They don\'t have strange sales practices, they are 
established, and they emphasize roleplay over discussion of physics.

   GURPS: Traveller is GURPS.  The only reason that it has any relevance to
this list is because it uses the classic Traveller era portion of the
timeline as its jumping off point.  That is about as simply as I can put it.
If you want to still insist on calling it Traveller, feel free.  My
authority with regard to decide what does and does not get called Traveller
extends exactly 0.0 meters.

   Do not make the classic mistake of confusioning Game Mechanics Canon with
Storyline Canon.  Traveller has never had consistent Game Mechanics Canon,
it *always* had basically consistent Storyline Canon up until "T4", and the
errors committed there were purely unintentional.

   Do not confuse Referee\'s Canon for either Storyline or Game Mechanics
Canon.  What you do with your own game is your business.

   OK, then it should pass this simple litmus test: do the events depicted
in the G:T correspond to already established Storyline Canon after Dulinor
shows up at Capital?  If the answer is no (and I already know that it is),
then what you have is a GURPS variant of Traveller, not Traveller.

   I agree with totally with the above statement (btw, my answer would have

I admitted it raises the issue of automated cargo carriers.  To me,
automated cargo carriers aren\'t really that big of a change to the spirit
of Traveller.

Now, will the PCs have ships that can jump and land themselves?  Maybe they
do, maybe they don\'t.  You can break it down to expense.  Make a ship\'s
computer that can do these things by itself very expensive.  Maybe even
close to the cost of the ship.  When produced en masse (Xboats and cargo
carriers) they\'re cheap, but when individually retrofitted into ships,
they\'re expensive.  And then there\'s always those situations that the
programmers of the automation never really figured on...

Yes, but this is also TL8-9 Terra.  What I was getting at was, if the PCs
never were on big cargo ships, especially in your campaign, then they
wouldn\'t know whether they were crewed or not.  Maybe their PCs "would"
know, and if it came up in the course of adventure you said that the PCs
came across a fully automated cargo carrier what would it change?  Maybe
one of the players will say, "Hey, in JTAS Number 12, page 7, paragraph 2,
line 3 it says that big cargo ships aren\'t fully automated!", then you
politely break out of GM mode and say, "That was published about 18 years
ago.  The view of the future has been changed since then."  And that\'s all
there is to it.

I seem to be pretty much alone in thinking that maybe some of the ideas in
Traveller should be modernized a bit.  I don\'t mind being alone.  I just
prefer the simplest route to get where I\'m going.  I just don\'t see the
need to make handwave after handwave when you can just say, "Hey, Marc and
Loren and the DGP folks never realized that we\'d move ahead as fast as we
did in real life."

I don\'t think that tweaking canon is all that bad of an idea, and it\'s been
done before.  No one comes up with a handwave to save the Annic Nova, but
everyone must immediately defend manned Xboats at all costs with reason
after reason as to why they can\'t be automated.

I think the people that have written and published Trav are great guys.  I
just don\'t believe that they\'re completely infallible.

When I said such heretical things in the past, everyone seemed to think
that I was proposing that we run Traveller as if it were an issue of
Scientific American with all kinds of tech footnotes and longwinded
explanations of technology.  That\'s not what I\'m saying.  I just don\'t feel
like having my intelligence insulted when I hear, "Well, the 3I doesn\'t
advance quickly because of the Vilani masses!" or "Since the Vilani are so
darned traditional, they don\'t do things that way..."  or "How can you
predict that bio-technology will be important to the colonization of
space!"...

Just admit that the world has changed in the last 20 years and move on.  So
what, something violates a book that 20% of the Traveller players have that
was published 12 years ago.  It\'s no big deal, y\'know?

I don\'t know.  Whatever.

   Traveller is Traveller because it has always had a generally consistent
background (the odd exception proving the rule).  I\'ve heard it said here,
on other Traveller lists, and in places where Traveller is not the primary
topic of conversation.  If a consistent background doesn\'t matter, then all
of the fighting that took place over what IG was doing to the background
history was for nothing, and everyone who said something disparaging about
Ken Whitman or Imperium Games in that regard owe them an apology.  For that
matter, all of the grousing about what MegaTraveller and TNE would mean to
the Background Canon was *doubly* meaningless (especially since neither MT
or TNE invalidated anything), and everyone who said something disparing
about GDW after 1986 or Dave Nilsen or Loren Wiseman or Frank Chadwick with
regard to TNE or MT also owe them an apology.

   These things matter to some of us.  We get passionate about the game and
what it means to us, much as some people get passionate about sports or the
writings of their favorite author.  Maybe we\'re just a pack of dinosaurs, in
which case we need to be shown to our tar pit so we can be turned into
something useful.  In the meantime, principle matters, and calling something
what it is not the same as bashing it.

Steve Deemer adds:

My particular Traveller obsession is coming up with bits and pieces of
everyday future technology, nothing that endangers canon or threatens
the established background, just things that add color and depth my
particular game setting.

One of these is the "bio", the slang term for the Imperial ID (other
slang
terms are "file", "card", and "tag", pretty obvious). This is a
combination
ID, passport, personal biography/medical history, and Imperial bankcard.
Everyone who travels through Imperium controlled space and goes through
Imperial customs/checkpoints must have one of these.

Physically, these are cards about the size of a credit card, made of a
tough
plastic material on the outside. One side always displays Imperium
information
including the Imperial emblem, information on where the card was
originated,
various authentication codes. This information is there mostly for
nostalga,
it\'s rarely if ever actually used.

The reverse side displays about the same information as a modern
driver\'s 
license in about the same format. A holo of the individual, some
personal
information (name, identification codes, and any information that might
need
immediate attention, such as medical alerts, criminal conviction status,
what have you). 

The entire card is a small, sealed computer, the faces of the card are a
computer display. The Imperial face cannot be altered by the carrier,
but the personal side includes a user interface for accessing the
various
functions.

The ID function doesn\'t just have a holo of the individual\'s face. The
card 
memory contains a photo album of the carrier, holos updated at intervals
from the date the card was originally issued to the last time the
carrier
went through Imperial customs. The holo displayed by default is always
the most recent holo in the collection. There is some intelligent
culling
of the album. Images that aren\'t different enough to make identification
difficult aren\'t stored. Images from different ages and with significant
cosmetic changes are stored. Also stored is fingerprints, retina scans,
a typical body thermograph, a millimeter radar scan of the carrier\'s
bone structure, including a detailed scan of the facial bones. I hadn\'t
considered a DNA map until a read a previous post on this subject,
but that\'s a good idea.

The medical section contains the individual\'s history as Robert wrote
above. Treatments, allergies, vacinations, stops on planets where 
the carrier might have been exposed to something the authorities want
to keep track of. So far, you\'ve got just about enough information to
physically construct the character from scratch.

The personal history section holds the travel history of the carrier.
Every time they passed through an Imperial customs checkpoint, were
on board a ship that was inspected by Imperial customs, or had other
significant interaction with Imperial authorities (such as being
questioned
in connection with an Imperial crime, for example).

The bankcard section offers a more secure method of moving money
from system to system than carrying around a big wad of loose,
anonymous cash. The card isn\'t an access to a bank account like
an ATM card, it carries the actual account it\'s self. Only authorised
Imperial bank authorities can debit/credit the bankcard. Traveller\'s
typically
withdraw cash from their bankcard at Imperial offices, taking it in some
other form of currency, either Imperial cash or whatever the locals use,
when first hitting dirt. Pay, gambling wins, whatever, gained in local
currency can be deposited in the account at an Imperial bank site.

The different card functions are generally separate and can only be accessed
by authorised entities. Only Imperial access control authorities (customs, law
enforcement) can update the ID and personal history sections. Only Imperial
bank authorities can credit/debit the bankcard account. The medical section is
partitioned into two sections, a permanent section verified by Imperial customs
and a "pending" section that can be updated by any authorised medical entity.
The two sections are reconciled during routine card updates. Medical treatment
received on planet would be in the "pending" section until, say, the individual
leaves the planet, at which time it would become part of the permanent history.

Something this important would be pretty bad to lose, so each time an 
individual passes through customs, the entire card memory is downloaded
to secure archives. Ground on a planet, go through customs, get involved
in typical Traveller shenanigans, lose your card, you can have it recreated
from the last archive. It immediately occurs to the seasoned PC that one
can hide, say, a medical procedure one didn\'t want on one\'s permanent
record by "losing" one\'s card immediately after the procedure. This would
ensure that the procedure would be unrecorded, but the fact that the card
was lost and reissued would be recorded. Too many lost cards would flag
an individual for special attention.

Lastly (finally!), after watching a few TV programs about cybergeeks who walk
around wearing personal body networks, I shamelessly borrowed this concept 
for the card. Carrying the card makes it interact with your personal "body
electromagnetic field" or whatever they called it. This means that your card can
be read remotely, without having to actually show it to the authorities. Imperial
checkpoints can therefore be invisible (Important GM note!) and appear almost
anywhere. All the visual features of the card are for low-tech systems that really
aren\'t authorised to mess with the cards internals. Imperials will _always_ have
the means to read the bio down to the last hidden authentication code.

Adventure hooks:  My view of the Traveller universe is that PCs have to be pretty
clever if they want to run around doing mischief throughout Imperial space. They
_will_ have a document that details their travels and significant dealings with
the authorities. This will be a damn near tamper proof document, these things have
been in existance for centuries, by now any holes in the security features would have
been discovered long before the player characters were born. However, clever PCs
will discover ways to keep things "off the bio". Simply carrying one\'s wealth in cold,
hard cash avoids the problem of having the Imperials audit one\'s finances every time
one goes through customs (then again, Imperial currency might have sensor targets
in it that would show up on access control scans (Imperial X-Files paranoia?)).

The cards might not be completely secure, after all. Imperial equipment will read/write
the cards. If some unsavory types got hold of both an Imperial bankcard device and the
current authentication code schema, they could be in the business of wealth creation.
At least until it was noticed that more Imperial cash was leaving a system than was
coming in, and the difference couldn\'t be accounted for.

I\'ve bored everyone enough for one post, I think.

Another big plus is the compatibility with TW20K,DC,C&D and all the other
GDW House Rules systems I can think of. I bought TNE because the rules
impressed me, not for the backround.

The only real problem I found with the rules was that players had 2xas
much hit capacity as I thought was humanly possible. Easy fix: halve their
HC\'s. Oh, and Virus was horribly undernourished in the backround and
playing tips department, something I would have like to see more material
on <duck>

I have had a go at Virus Era stuff, but Virus is only suited to either
cameo parts or planet-wide artifical life colonies. I absolutely cannot
think of a reason why any TNE player wouldn\'t want to dabble in T4,CT & MT
time periods. Just the fact that there is so much official material out
there adds to the believability of the GM\'s campaign (it does, really
*^_^*).

I will probably buy G:T for the material alone, because I feel that the
GURPS system is overcomplicated and inconsistent (How many rules extension
books are there?) and needs a damn good rewrite (and some real artwork).
That\'s one thing I admired about GDW is that they weren\'t afraid to
completely revamp rules systems to bring them um to scratch (hail of CT
books heading towards me at high speed now...).

by shrinking ALL the computers down to .5 ton (500 kilos). They should really
be smaller, but I think this is the smallest size that can use CT book
2/Highguard design parameters (my "cheat" is that the computer weighs 1 kilo,
and the EMP shielding weighs 499 kilos). If anything, while I loved the

Traveller, and not Star Wars; despite the superior rules and support). That is
not what\'s not bringing in new blood. It\'s the opposite. The rugrats love
silly movie based space Opera over hard sci-fi. Ask a 13-14 year old which is
a better movie; Star Wars, or 2001? I agree with you %1000 that the problem
with getting new blood is that there is no movies based on the Traveller
universe. A pity that. I think a movie based on the Earth-vilani wars would do
well (Earth would be the good guys in this one, to make it more marketable).
You are also right about the game centering around military-merchant types,
which probably explains the presence of military and ex-military gamers in
large numbers. It\'s a catch 22:  there is no new blood and large market base
to allow money to fix the rules, and the lousy rules hurt the ability to
attract new gamers....sigh. Maybe the trick is to adapt Traveller to the Star
Wars rules, and get the rugrats to try something new. This is also the point
of Gurps Traveller, and it amazed me that people are badmouthing it. Granted,
I would rather play "pure" Traveller (what\'s that anyway?), but this is better
than nothing, and I don\'t see Steve Jackson screwing this up.

Marc said something clarifying this exact point I think, several weeks

No way!  INWO:CCG:The Traveller Setting!  This would be great.  At least from this

Loren, get the card game guys going on this, please!

Factions could be each race: Solomani, Vilani, Zhodani, Aslan, Vargyr, K\'Kree,
Hivers, Droyne, etc.

Effect cards like: Vargyr Corsair Raid, MisJump! Zhodani Infiltrator.

All kinds of Artifact cards both high and low TLs.

You could have game mechanics like Low Berth (where you would keep cards in
reserve until needed), Green Zones (no cost to playing a card there), Amber Zones
(some cost to play a card in that area), Red Zone (no way to play a card there
without a special empowerment).  This Zone idea might work for drawing cards, too.

I\'d buy it Loren!  (Assuming you wouldn\'t let me help create it ;-)  I think a lot

Well, now that we all have some ideas as to what the thing *does*,
I\'ll take a shot...

My U.S. passport is a 1/8th thick booklet about 3x5 inches with a heavy-
weight, plasticized (but flexible) external cover. The first page is also
plasticized and contains my picture on the left with some seals on the
picture edges to provide security against tampering. On the right side is
listed birthdate, country of origin/issuing country, expiration date, physical
description.

The rest of the booklet consists of paper for containing port entry/exit
stamps. The last page (the side to the back cover) has a blurb about
what/who the issue of passport is dedicated to. In my case, it\'s Ben
Franklin.

So...I\'d say an Imperial version would be about the same size, probably
a little smaller. Definitely be able to project the holo on its own
without
an external power source being required (have it run off the thermal
energy of the holder). It would be nice if just opening the front cover
activated the holo projector by breaking a link to a velcro/magnetic
fastener. It would include pages of some ink-bearing substance for 
low TL port entry/exit  stamps and also contain some RAM for holding
higher tech electronic/holo stamps in addition to any required medical
info (nice idea, that).

External color is based on the year of issuance.

Ah, another chance for a blatant plug....
When Mrc Sent around the Revision of the First Survey Data, I noticed that still some
systems were not like they should be. Some sources in Canon simply contradicted the
listed data. So i took it upon myself to correct Core and Corridor Data, hoping that
others would follow the example. Carlos has indeed done Massilia, his speciality, but
other sector still await reworking.
Anyway, what i did was check all available Canon Sources that made some statements about
the listed worlds at that time. I changed UWPs to what was more logical or what was
simply stated in Canon. I also removed TL and Starports on Barren Worlds. I reduced Tech
evels over 12 as that was High-Tl at that time. Some other changes as well.
The result of this can be found on my homepage, along with everything i could find about
the Ancients. I believe this collection to be the most complete collection on the net,
so i anyone needs to know anything about the ancients, look on my page. Finally the url:

Especially, considering that "Gtz von Berlichingen" is a well known play by the German
poet Johann Wolfgang Goethe (the one who also wrote the original Faust). So there is a
bit more to the name, a character, an attitude.

 I\'ve already done that - I create characters using the CT Traveller rules,
and convert them to the D6 system (which is what the Star Wars RPG uses,
along with several other of West End\'s products)....

Anyway, it seems that a lot of people , at least on the net, aren\'t too
happy with the various Traveller rules - people end up using Corps, D6,
Chaosiums BRP, Star Hero, Gurps, Storyteller, etc

So, why doesn\'t IG( or the Future Traveller publisher) just give up on
rules, and just publish source material? That\'s what makes Traveller,
Traveller, IMHO.

Personally?  I can do nothing.  Marc has his ideas for the way T4.1 will
go, Loren has his ideas for the way that GURPS: Traveller will go.  With
that said, now let me explain what I would do.  Keep in mind that A.) This
is all hypothetical, and B.) I\'m stating what I think should be done to
sell more copies of the game, not what I think is best for the game (two
different things entirely).

Get rid of Foss as an artist.  Toss him right away, with all due respect to
those who like him.  I like him to some extent.  I like the detail and
sense of scale in his paintings, and they are executed well.  However, his
cover artwork would not inspire me to buy the game or the supplements. 
That\'s not even mentioning that his stuff just doesn\'t feel like Traveller.
 The cover art I would most likely suggest is hard to explain.  I\'d like to
see a more "futuristic" feel to the logo and title.  My webpage should be
up soon, so you\'ll be able to see an example of what I mean.  If that\'s not
soon enough, then find some techno/rave flyers, or a copy of the games
"WipeOut" or "WipeOut XL" and look at the packaging and design.  This is a
style that I find aesthetically pleasing, but that\'s not my only reason. 
More on that in a moment.

But, the rules mechanics aren\'t secondary to the average person with little
or no RPG experience who happens to see the book in his local comic shop. 
They don\'t want to have to fudge with the rules to get up and going so they
can run a game for their friends.  They want something that is relatively
easy to learn that doesn\'t have lots of exceptions and funky add-ons...  At
least not right off the bat.

For GURPS, they handle their rules the way they handle their rules.  I
don\'t like them, but they are well presented at the very least.  For T4.1,
I would dedicate the first chapter to a "quick start" section covering all
of the basics of the rules with clear and concise examples.  I would try to
dumb down the system without insulting the intelligence of the reader.  A
very difficult and fine line to walk.

I\'m not just talking about laser guns, or plasma guns, or what have you. 
First of all, remember that this is 4,000 years or so in the future. 
Portable power sources will be much more efficient.  Exactly how much more
powerful is for the gearheads to decide.  The "datedness" that I refer to
is the lack of technologies that are studied in the modern day that are
completely absent from Traveller...

Computers, automation, artificial intelligence (\'strong\' or \'weak\'),
nanotechnology (\'wet\' or \'dry\'), robots, clones, genetic engineering,
artificial life, etc...  There\'s alot of stuff that\'s missing from
Traveller.  I\'m not trying to start up this thread again, but there are a
good number of people out there who are into science, or at the very least
pop-science out there.  There is alot of modern day theory that is just
ignored.  It is swept under the rug with any one of a million different
handwaves.

Then don\'t shoot for the 13 or 14 year olds.  Yes, they\'ll probably go for
AD&D or Star Wars, so don\'t even bother.  I had promised that I\'d get to
the reasoning for the "techno-ish" look I envision for Traveller, and
here\'s where I bring it in.  There are folk out there who are interested in
sci-fi that aren\'t interested at all in role-playing Star Wars.  This same
group tends to have a certain look and feel that they like, as well as
music that they are into, and other games that they are into.  For example,
out of my group of friends, just about every single one of them was
suckered into the look and feel of the videogame "WipeOut XL".  Good on the
fonts and artwork, as well as a good choice of music and sound all added up
to something that they were looking for.  The trappings raised a game that
was really little more than a really-fast racing game into something that
was attractive to alot of people.  Various sorts of techno and industrial
music draw on a wide sci-fi background.  

Now, out of this same group of people, you will find that most of them have
other sci-fi movies that they liked alot more than Star Wars.  Movies like
the Abyss, the Alien series, Dune, 2001, 2010, Total Recall, Blade Runner,
Terminator.  In addition, alot of them are into a wide variety of sci-fi
books, Gibson, Sterling, the Dune saga, the Foundation series, Starship
Troopers, the Rama series.  There is more out there than Star Wars.

Take for example, me.  22 years old.  My favorite sci-fi books are:
Clarke\'s Rendezvous With Rama, Asimov\'s Foundation Series, Sterling\'s
Islands in the Net (and others), alot of Gibson\'s stories, and (what I\'ve
read so far of) Sagan\'s Contact.  My favorite sci-fi movies are: 2001,
Contact, the Abyss, Alien (the best of the three), Terminator, and Akira.
 
My friends aren\'t exactly the same in their tastes, but they mostly are
similar.  If it wasn\'t for me having liked Traveller from way back, and the
work I put into my own campaign, they wouldn\'t be playing Traveller for a
number of different reasons.  My brother, as an example, has a good
technological background.  He has said in the past he doesn\'t like the fact
that Traveller has such a dim view of computing power, nanotechnology,
artificial intelligence and artificial life.

Go for the 19-25 year olds who are into sci-fi.  By this point, those that
are into sci-fi have diverged somewhat from the Star Wars trap.  I have
left Star Trek out, because I\'m not sure where exactly to put it in this
line-up.  A few members of my gaming group enjoy DS: 9, and several love
different ST movies...  But Star Trek fans seem to have a camp of their
own, by and large.

The bad news is, there isn\'t going to be, at least not in the very near
future.  As a result, Traveller has to carve out its own niche.

The lousy presentation of rules hurt the ability to attract new gamers. 
Face it, AD&D is one of the market leaders.  The AD&D rules system is so
convoluted, screwed-up,  unrealistic and bass-ackwards that it is truly
surprising it is one of the market leaders.  Name recognition only goes so
far.  A good presentation of the rules with clear, concise examples goes
the rest of the way.  The White Wolf World of Darkness series is another
good example, since they are the other market leader.  Their system is
really pretty bad.  It\'s elegant, but it requires the use of soooo many
dice to do anything I don\'t know of anyone who ever ran the rules straight
from the book.  Combats moved like slugs in molasses on a cold winter day. 
Much like AD&D, there are plenty of clear, concise examples as to how the
rules work though.  At the very least, a GM er...  Storyteller can gauge
how he must balance his rewritten system to fit with the rest of the rules
basics...

I don\'t know.  Maybe my ideas are terrible, maybe their bad.  My point
isn\'t to say what\'s best for the game, it\'s to say what would help the game
sell and still keep its integrity intact.  What I\'d ultimately like to see
is a rule book almost completely devoid of background (oh horrors!!!), with
several different options for jump drives, psionics, technologies, with a
good cross-section of careers and items.  TNE tried this to some extent,
and I personally liked it.  Sure it\'s heretical, but it opens the Traveller
universe much wider.  Sure, the background materials would focus on the 3I,
but there\'d be something for everybody.  Personally, I prefer rules that
aren\'t tied deeply to any one background, and I tend to despise background
material and adventures in a rulebook...

But, that\'s just me.

I\'d like to point out perhaps the biggest handwave in Traveller:
"Due to the unique topology of J-space, the fall through the tunnel takes about
one week ( 150 hours), regardless of the istance travelled in N-space."
Anybody that doesn\'t like handwaves is going to be limited to planetbound
adventures.

I am saying that GURPS Traveller is Traveller.

It cannot possibly be GURPS because GURPS is a generic rules system. 

Traveller is a game set in the Imperium, with blah blah balh.....

GURPS Traveller is set in a version of the 3rd Imperium where Strephon was
not murdered. So it doesn\'t follow the original timeline. Fine. So it\'s an
alternate timeline.

It\'s Traveller. Because if it wasn\'t it\'d not be set in the 3rd Imperium
and I\'d not have spent all night searching fro references about which
shipping lines are more important in the Marches around 1115 ish.

Many many people (not me) have said trhat MT and TNE were a horrible
mistake and should not have been allowed to happen.

So here\'s a timeline where they didn\'t. Take it or leave it.

Oh, and here\'s something to chew on:

The G:Trav timeline IS Canon, and so\'s the other one. It\'s like this:

The Imperium is part of Grandfather\'s ongoing experiment, his plan to
evolve humans in many ways and then bring them all together, to play on
their strengths as theEmpress Wave binds everyone together to create the
new higher form of humans. Grandfather let the Rebellion play out, saw
where it was going, and rejected that particular line of study.

Using his TL 32 time machine, he hopped back and changed a few things. This
time the experiment is back on track.

Yeah, right.

Because in M;0 you might do something that changes the future timeline.

military threat to the Imperium.

You also can\'t play MT, or even CT for the same reason... you might upset
the future timeline and that is absoultely forbidden....


Look. Have I managed to convey how utterly stupid this thread is? 

GURPS is a Traveller variant as valid as all the other Traveller variants
like TNE and MT. 

Play it if you want. Or don\'t. Who cares?

Releasing GT is not going to cause virus-laden rocks to fall upon us at

WTF?  You seem to have a real problem with our SOP, which keeps things form
getting FUBAR.  Why, in my days as a PFC 11B I was thrilled when the LT,
for whom I was RTO, would sit with me in the APC during FTXs and tell me
the abbreviations we would be using for SOI at NTC, or perhaps outside of
CONUS.  We\'d sit in our BDUs, eating MREs, and speak entirely in TLAs.

I would sit in the shade of a MBT, and watch the CSM terrorize the
Battalion TOC.  I could get away with this because I was the unit H/FS NCO.

If I may make a slight nit.. D&D to AD&D was a refinement and expansion of
the existing rules to an expanded form.  CT to MT is the nearest Traveller
equivilant.  CT to TNE was a completely different rule set.

I agree.  Take a look at CORPS.  Every rule is stated in a clear synopsis
at the begining of the section, and at the end of each section is a "how
you do it" box recapping the previous section.

Ordinary jewelry depends on the ambient light for its best
appearance.  BioJewels, produced by several corporations (most
notably the three Vilani bureaux/megacorporations and the two
Solomani-derived corporations Hortalez et cie and Schunamann und
Sohn AG), depend on the wearer\'s lifesigns, instead, providing an
ever-changing reflection of the wearer\'s physical state, and
indirectly his/her mental and/or emotional state as well.
Although popular in their own right as costume jewelry, they have
also proven to be useful to medical professionals such as
personal doctors and nurses who need to monitor their patient
continuously but unobtrusively, when the patient is in the public
eye.

BioJewels are composed of a substrate that contains both a
programmable sensor and an electrosensitive material that reacts
to the sensor signal by glowing.  The sensor portion is generally
reprogrammable for both metric and signal strength with the
appropriate equipment by an individual with computer-2.  The
substrate can be produced to match the appearance of most
precious stones, but cannot be changed after production.

Most jewelers on worlds of TL11+ (B+) that sell BioJewels are
equipped for reprogramming, generally at a cost of Cr100-200 and
one hour of time per jewel to be reprogrammed.  On worlds of
TL10- (A-), reprogramming will generally not be available.

When activated, the BioJewel glows at an intensity proportional
to the strength of the incoming signal.  Clear-substrate
BioJewels can also be programmed to change color based on signal
strength; colored-substrate BioJewels are limited to changes of
hue (for example, a red-substrate BioJewel can be made to vary
from orange to maroon, but cannot be made to glow green or blue).

Well said!  Enough with the ranting and raving about what system is
best/worst.  I personally use them all to build my little corner of the
Traveller universe.  Everything published has some tidbit that I use even
the TML(especially the TML?).  Buy it, don\'t buy it your choice as an
individual but I\'ll take what I can get and run with it.

Another thing that bothers me is the quoting of formulae to prove a point;
WHO CARES, its just a game for goodness sake.  So what if the physics are
slightly wrong, ask yourself was it fun for the players and Game Master and
if it was nuff said.

I have introduced a high level of cloning and pure genetic breeding.  I
extract data from my wife about some of the work that she\'s doing and stuff
that she has just read about (she\'s a molecular biologist) and try to
incorporate into my worlds 4000 years in the future.  That ought to scare
some of the purists to death.

Computers are my background and I HAVE made changes to the computer stuff in
Traveller to account for (I would think) a large change in technology from
out TL 7/8 to the TL 15/16 computer. Same goes for power.  I\'m sure by TL
11/12/13 that you would be able to power a very powerful laser pistol with
what would be the equivalent of a watch battery today.  I mean think about
for a minute and I believe that you too would have some problems with
"Canon" on a few things.  The first thing I read in the LBB\'s was "these
books are to guide you" or something like that.

I\'m done.....

I agree with your sentiment, Trav, but I wasn\'t fond of the TNE system.  It was
too much of a divergent from what was Traveller for me.

I do respect that you like it though.

This is what T4 needs--not the mumbo jumbo of assorted systems and mechanics that
we have (ex:  the various starship construction methods that are not very mutually
compatible).

My biggest problem was that it didn\'t "feel" like Traveller.  I liked a lot of
what TNE tried to do, but, for me, it was an unwieldy system.  I\'m sentimental--I
like the CT 6 siders and Skill weights.

For instance, autofire combat.  That takes for ever to play out.  If a guy gets
two actions in a round.  Each action gives him 5 pulls of the trigger.  Each burst
fires 5 shots--that\'s 50 dice rolls!

Then you adjust for recoil, on each pull of the trigger.  You track ammo.  You see
which bullets hit.  Then you roll on a hit location chart to see where the target
was hit.  Then you roll for and apply damage.

Sheesh, you\'ll spend 20 minutes with this one guy--in a 5 second combat round.

I like the detail, and I think the idea is good.  But, the execution of the rules
is too detailed and time consuming for easy, fun play.

Yes.  It\'s incredible, and hard not to play--as a gamer, you want to take
advantage of the excellence provided in this game.

I just wish Traveller was this good.  If it was, I would have THE GAME.

What\'s R&E?  I\'m going to play 2nd edition Star Wars.

I wish I could do that.  That\'s what I want--to be able to play Traveller
straight out of the book, letting the games designers do all the work.  That\'s
why I\'m buying the stuff in the first place--so I won\'t have to make it up.

But, I have too many problems with the T4 task system--even T4.1.  I like the
idea behind it, but the execution lacks (ex:  the skills vs stats debate;  the
single half die in MM\'s task system, etc.).

Well, it shows it.  The books look good.  The rules are clean and well thought
out...and sparse.

It\'s what a RPG should look and feel like--and I\'m talking about game mechanics
here, not the background.

Star Wars could have easily been a crappy game system wrapped in a great
background.

OK.  So, are we supposed to have more shoddy quality just because they\'re not
putting money into it?

So, put out fewer, better, books, that are high quality.  Don\'t just get some
fan to write something, slap a cover on it, and call it a good RPG.

That\'s not what I\'m talking about.  I\'m saying that a Star Wars RPG adventure
has everything at you fingertips in the module--just like AD&D adventures.

In Trav adventures, they basically give you an outline, you, as the GM, have to
create deck plans, roll up NPC\'s, and do a lot of pre-game work.

Star Wars adventures are off-the-shelf-ready-to-play items.

I just want the option.  If I have time to nit-pick, great.  If I run it as-is,
off-the-shelf, then I want to be able to do that too.

Didn\'t Traveller come out within a year of D&D?

At one time, AD&D and Traveller were THE role playing games.  This list is a
testament to the droves of Traveller players out there--and this is the greatly
diminished number due to the decreased popularity of the game since the late
70\'s and early 80\'s.

For the first time in this post, we agree.  And what does it take to attract
players?

Quality.

Traveller does have a lot of advantages, though.  They are just not being used
to their fullest potential.

Traveller\'s background is incredible.

BattleTech is not based on a movie, and it does well.  Traveller could do the
same.

And, why are they shrinking?  I\'ve been playing Traveller since 1982.  I love
the game, but even a die hard fan like me is giving up because of lack of
quality.

Bad quality is unattractive to a serious role player with limited time.

In a nutshell?

Come out with T4 Second Edition (T4.1), or develop T6 (T5 being Gurps Trav) and
start from scratch, building on the best of the previous four editions.

Have design systems that are intercompatible (just allowing more detail).  Update
the look and feel of the game.

And...start publishing adventures and game supplements that are the best in the
industry.

If you build it, they will come.


> y What I mean by this is that the thing I

I agree.  I love the setting too--so much so that I put up with and fix
substandard game mechanics all the time.

I like that too.  Aliens is like that, and it doesn\'t seem too dated to me.

I like that stuff.

Right.  I agree here too.  Star Wars is a space opera.  I like the Traveller
background better.  The hard core sci-fi attracts me.

It\'s the rules that irk me.

Star Wars just happens to have superior rules, and I\'m tired of problems with
Traveller game mechanics.

It\'s a lot of work for a GM like me who believes that if he is going to put this
much time into something, then he should work with the best tools.

Hey, I\'m a filmmaker, and I couldn\'t sit through 2001.

And, I\'m 32 years old.

Nope.  Like I said, BattleTech does well.

No, the trick is to make a Traveller game with superior game mechanics.

Then, I\'d be yelling at the top of my lungs "Traveller is the game to play!"
instead of looking at Star Wars (a background that is fun, but not what I\'m
addicted to--Traveller).

We just need better quality stuff for Traveller--that\'s the plain, simple, truth.

Naw.  I think Gurps Trav is a good thing.  I\'m not going to play it because I\'m
not that fond of Gurps, but maybe they\'ll do a better job than IG did of creating
a rules set.

Maybe that will sway me to play it that way.

I\'m just not that fond of the shoddy game mechanics and mis-matched systems.

I want a good game through and through.

    'body' => 'The problem with adding bioware, nanotech et al into Traveller is that
within a century or so, assuming tehnology continues at this rate, we will
be well beyond the \'event horizon\' of technology, and the future will be
incomprehensible.

Now, I\'ve played in such a game - John Hughes\' \'Rites of Passage\', which is
set in such a universe - artificial intelligences, nanoware, semi-autonous
personality constructs, personality re-engineeering, the whole nine yards.
It was wonderful for a three-hour convention game, but utterley unplayable
in a campaign (if you have instant data transfer and nanofabrication, then
scarcity is no longer an operative concept. And no scarcity, no markets. If
you can reprogram your agent for any knowledge base, then anything that is
known, can be known).

Traveller technology works the way it does because one of the core
assumptions of the background is a dispersed interstellar society with
variations of technology and an interstellar free market.

As a result, technology has to be on a fairly gradual curve, and it is. For
example accumulators (which are the core technology for energy weapons)
improve by about 100% from TL9 to TL 14 (TL9, 10 MJ per m3 ; TL12, 20 MJ
per m3 - ref FFS2, table 223). This isnt that impressive - a world building
a Partical Accelerator will seriously think about buying TL9 accumulators
if mass and space arent much of an issue (one of these days, after my
Coronation-Killer battlecruiser and everthing else, I have to see what
\'appropriate technology\' gear looks like - a MCr100 warship with MCr90 of
TL9 stuff, and MCr10 of TL12).

This gives lo-tech worlds an economic role that they wouldnt have if
anything they could build was a thousand times bigger and a thousand times
heavier than high tech worlds. The exceptions are the \'new\' technologues -
fusion, jump drives, meson guns, nuclear dampers and black and white globes
... things that allow that that was impossible.

If you want to think of today as TL8, then you might want to redefine
TL9-15 as TL 9.0 through TL9.9, and put nanotech and instant jump drives
and so and so forth at TL10 and up.

You also have the issue that a high-energy power source rigged up to a mass
spectrometer makes a great way of refining anything you want - raw
materials just arent an issue any more once you have fusion. This has been
handwaved away in Traveller.

The essential problem is that everything - technology, society, culture,
communications and so on - are a web, and everything affects everything else.

Automation *will* impact on unautomated Far Traders, because if I can prove
that an automated ship cuts the cost of shipping cargo to Cr 700 per
parsec, then we need to come up with a fairly impressive handwave for why
those Far Traders can get away with charging Cr 1000. Either they are
forced wayyyyy to the fringe, where there arent a 10 000t freighter leaving
every six hours (and big planets will create that much trade, if you take
the GPP rules in PE, punch in some assumptions on the size of the
interstellar traded goods sector and crunch out the numbers), or you start
handwaving like crazy.

Except they now wont be technological handwaves, they will be social,
cultural and economic handwaves.

This comes down to something that is personal taste.  For example, I have
had little or no training with firearms, and yet, I was a damn good shot
the first time I ever used a gun back when I was in the cub scouts.  I am a
naturally talented artist with a decent eye for design and form.  Something
of an prodigy.  My brother has had little formal training with computers,
and yet he is damned good with them...  Another friend of mine is a flat
out genius when it comes to numbers, and that type of stuff comes really
easy to him.  The list goes on and on.  Not to discuss T4s faults or
excellence, but at least you know where I\'m coming from here.  The D3
doesn\'t bother me too much, as I actually have 2 of them in my collection
of dice, so it\'s no real hassle.

Well, yes.  That\'s the sad part.  I would say, "Hey, I\'ll do the design
work for T4.1, and do it cheap!", not to toot my own horn, but I think I
could put out a clean, high-quality product.  But, my lack of hands on
experience and my lack of formal training mean that I wouldn\'t get the job.
 So it goes.  If I thought it would do a bit of good, I\'d send some samples
to IG.

On the contrary, get a fan to write it.  The fans know the most.  But,
proofread it, check it, and if it introduces new rules, playtest it with a
modicum of thoroughness.

I thought it was GDW.  The two copies of MegaTraveller I have say GDW...

This is a difference in the scope of both games.  As an example, I can say
as a Star Wars GM, "you visit the Cantina in Mos Eisley", and the players
can imagine it.  You don\'t have that crutch with Traveller.  Furthermore,
it\'s extremely difficult to write a completely focused Traveller adventure.
 Alot of the CT modules were basically "plug and play" and had everything
at your fingertips.

Sure.  No problem.  Adventures are rare for many games nowadays, because
they tend to not sell too well.

I don\'t have my little tan D&D books with me right now, I thought they were

Oh yeah.  Traveller used to be the sci-fi roleplaying game.  Somewhere
along the line, though, players as a group lost interest for whatever
reasons.  My own bet is that it was difficult to play the game without the
background, and in order to get the background you needed to buy a heck of
alot of books, or do tons of work yourself.  That\'s a failing of the genre,
not the game itself.

Quality.  A good look to the books.  A modern look to the books.  This goes
a long way, too.  Look at the unique and distinct designs of Deadlands, the
White Wolf books and AD&D to see what I mean.

But you can\'t get depth of background from the cover of a book.  As much as
it sucks, that\'s what sells.  The goth types can look at White Wolf and
say, "Cool!  A game for us," fantasy fans can look at AD&D and say, "Wow! 
This is our game," Star Wars fans can say, "Cool!  The Imperial
Sourcebook!"...

But most folks would look at T4 and just pass it by due to the lackluster
cover artwork and design.

BattleTech has a number of things going for it.  #1.)  The basic ideas for
the game came from Japanese animation, which always has had a niche market.
 #2.)  There are alot of folks out there who like giant robots.  #3.)  It
has a hardcore and popular videogame based on it.  #4.)  It has a franchise
of novels based on it.

This is all in addition to good design, mind you.

CT was the FIRST Space based role playing game (of any major consequence)
and the best!

It still is the best. You would have had to been there in the "old days".
CT ruled!

People by their nature do not like change. I once felt as you do.
I thought that I was a "Force of Chaos" and then I started spawning
children!

They are definitely agents of Chaos.

Physics is an integral (no phun intended) of CT and the "other T\'s". Space
is the best thing that we have going next to Science itself.

Wasn\'t it cool that somebody calculated how many Joules that a "Rod-Lobber"
wold produce?.
I am an Engineer and was going to do that over the weekend for my game just
for laughs.

Are we weird to dig Science?? Role playing is great no doubt, but actually
thinking about HOW
things COULD work is even better.

Then limit it, don\'t drop it out entirely.  Anyone with a passing knowledge
of modern day high tech and theory has heard of these concepts.  I know of
one person who wouldn\'t have touched Traveller at all based on this lack of
realism.

You can limit it to fit within the bounds of the game with very little
work.  Sure, some background might get trampled in the process.  But
background has already been trampled for less noble reasons.

Then don\'t drive it to this level.  If Traveller is still around in 20
years, and the ideas seem antiquated, change it again.

Then Traveller is doomed as far as new players go unless there is a sudden
and unexpected revival in 50s to 70s technology and that\'s a cold, hard
fact we have to face.

This is with good reason.  But, fusion wasn\'t written out of Traveller for
this reason, which goes a long way to my point.  If you handwave something
away with good reason, then GMs and players will understand.  If you do it
just because you\'re frightened of what it\'ll do to your silver jumpsuits
and flying cars, then they won\'t.

True.  So Traveller must either update or die as an independent system.  It
really comes down to that.  With no new blood, no one will want to publish
Traveller.  Steve Jackson may do it even if it loses money out of love. 
The way to get new blood is to update the feel of the game, this much I
believe wholeheartedly.

Is every single piece of cargo in the modern world moved by big cargo ships
and big cargo planes?  No, of course not.  All kinds of goods and
passengers are moved in a huge variety of different ways.  Small planes
move high priority goods and passengers, medium planes move numbers of
passengers and lower priority goods, big planes move heavy equipment and
machinery.  Slow bulky cargo ships move all kinds of goods, small boats
smuggle drugs and weapons, move various goods, and move passengers.  Luxury
liners provide their own services...  And so on and so on.

I never imagined for a second that a Free Trader could ever compete with
Megacorporations on their own turf.  The idea\'s just ludicrous, whether the
Megacorp ships are automated or not.  Megacorps will always be able to ship
goods more cheaply.  However, some goods  may require that personal touch,
and that\'s where Free Traders come in. 

> Except they now wont be technological handwaves, they will be social,
> cultural and economic handwaves.

Like I said, a handwave with a good reason is fine.  A handwave just
because it violates a long out of print book that 5 people on the list have
is not.  Maybe it is time to look at the Traveller background with a
critical, uncaring eye and change those things that are now out-of-date.

Maybe not.

Maybe Traveller is an animal doomed to extinction because of the
inflexibility of its wonderful background.  I\'d like to think not.

Exactly.  Then look at T4 stuff.  They don\'t look so bad on the outside, but
open \'em up, and you are hit with amateurish looking game material.

I just noticed that my copy of Star Wars Second Edition is copyrighted 1993--5
years ago, and the looks of it still blows the socks off of anything IG has put

Well, the arguements that say they should exist also say they
shouldn\'t be that expesive.  Also, who says they have to
be retrofited?  The PCs just get them with the ship.

When the contact ships to arrange courses, get help, info, etc.
they will notice if nobody answers.  I also makes a difference
when the want to arrange a working passage.  If you give it
more than a moments thought you can come up with more
examples.

Better than introducing a technology (which often is just as
much I guess as the ones implement years ago) and then putting
in handwaves so it doesn\'t break the background.  I don\'t
have problems with many things (like updating computers a
bit), but there are few things that are central such as
communications and PC involvement.

I don\'t call automatic ships "tweaking".  It fundamentally alters
the need to for just the kind of skills a PC is likely to
have and the class of people they are going to interact with.

Our explanations are, by no means, the only ones for how jump drives work
or what all the hydrogen is used for. So, as for as I\'m concerned use
whatever works for you in your game.

There is a difference between handwave and suspension of disbelief.
There is a rule in literature that you can expect a reader to
allow one general suspension of disbelief to set up a genre
but everything should flow naturally from that.

   And I you.  I just think the TNE system is more thought out and more highly
developed.  I certainly wouldn\'t mind backward compatibility attempts but
after the fact, so that the system wouldn\'t be comprimised.   
   As far as canon debates go, I don\'t care one bit about the task mechanics.
I am primarily concerned over canon (meaning Storyline Canon) and those who
would see the Rebellion and Collapse not happen.  But as long as they don\'t
mind the "stigma" (:::sarcasm:::) of *Alternate,* I could care less.   I  just
think its something better left to individual refs and not to game companies
to put out.

Once you get used to it, it starts going really fast.  It\'s not 5 seconds, but
probably about a minute.  Usually (but not always) I just figure out the
*final* diff/die mods and apply it to *every* shot.  That\'s the trade off... 1
in 20 chance w/ 50 rolls or 10 out of 20 w/ 5.

>Sheesh, you\'ll spend 20 minutes with this one guy--in a 5 second combat round.

Well I always stick to the core rules when it\'s Elite or Detailed NPCs or a
player vs player fight (it happens w/ my group sometimes...) but when it\'s a
large fight, I go to that house mod.  I\'d say maybe 5 minutes per round, which
is bad.  Star Wars takes longer for us IIRC (dodge/resistance/ wild die
rolls... etc etc).   With mods...  it\'s less than a minute (as long as it
takes to roll the dice really...).

It goes really fast for us...  It took like 2 combats to go smooth... we\'re
like lightning now...

Nope.  If I didn\'t want the hard sci fi, detail and awesome coherence of TNE,
we\'d go back to Star Wars, probably (I killed the dodge skill after several
mods).

2nd edition, Revised and Expanded...  Added several full color plates (ads)
went to full color interior art... added a couple templates, Force powers, and
revised the movement rules slightly (very slightly... mostly naming 2x speed,
etc).  The major improvement is in the visuals... and the original 2nd ed was
awesome itself (I have both).

OK. I\'ll say up front I dont believe you can fit new technologies into
Traveller without turning it into something else.

Lets go through some of the technologies  ...

Cyber/Bioware : Is in Traveller, as one of the things that the Solomani did
in the Good Old Days. Big social pressures against it. Imperium isnt that
good at it - call it down 2 TLs. Having cyberwear in you can get you
declared a machine, with associated loss of sentience rights, let alone
Imperial Citizenship. The alternate view is to assume that skills, stat
bonuses etc gained in charGen is from cyberwear etc - "Of course I\'m a
qualified Pilot. The Scout Service inserted the chip when I signed up, back
in \'22".

Nanomachines : These are one of those things that you cant have a little
bit of. They will be a truly revolutionary technology, in a way jump drives
et al arent. Jump drives just do to space what the sail did for the sea.
Nanofabrication units will revolutionise everything.

AI : Is in Traveller, but either at TL17 or TL12, depending on your
particular view on Virus. Interesting, limitable to certain extent by
price, but fundamentally, the question you have good robots is "why do they
pay a human to do this when a machine does it better and cheaper ?".

Fusion : Once you have free power, manufacturing falls in cost to near
nothing. We sidestepped this one in Traveller by pretending it doesnt.

And if you do it *because* you have assessed that the silver jumpsuits and
flying cars just wont exist in a world where you can directly interface
with your computer ?

I dont believe you can update the core technologies that underlay the
storyline. You will have something, but not Traveller.

I\'d also like to point out that the other SF RPGs have also gone pretty
badly, as far as survival goes.

The vast majority (and I\'m talking 95% plus) of cargo gets carried via
shipping companies leasing space in freighters.

Such as ? Free Traders are a wonderfully romantic concept, and an excellent
way of turning a starship deposit into nothing.

If you want to make money, lease the ship and own the cargo. 

Of course, that is far less romantic :)

The background hangs together as it does for a number of reasons. One of
the advantages of this list is you can start messing around with it, and
engineers, astronomers, economists, and all sorts of other sods and bods
can give their view.

My view is that essentially Traveller is about trying to recreate the Age
of Adventure - the era between the Age of Exploration and the invention of
the telegraph, which allowed some Regimental commander in the North-West
Frontier to be micro-managed by thin-blooded bureaucrats in Whitehall.

The "low density data will be a moderatrely normal "bar code". The high
density will be a 2-d code. 

On my real ID card, the high density block is 4 cm x 1 cm, and moderate
chunk of that is alignment pattern. The "dots" in the code are about .5
mm square. I\'ve got *no* idea what all they have coded into it.

I figure that optical data will be used for the same reason they are
using it now. It\'s easy to read with rugged, low tech readers. It\'s
hard to alter without being *very* obvious, and it\'s hard to damage
accidentally. And if it *does* get damaged, it\'s obvious *before* you
run it through a reader.

Heck, any culture that has gotten as far as "crude" photography can
create such IDs. They\' may have to do something like fill in a "grid"
by hand, then photo-reduce it, but they *can* do it. So it\'s possible
to make local IDs that work with the high tech stuff (in actuallity, a
*good* medieval illuminator could quite likely create a usable ID, but
it\'d take him a week or two).

So I dropped a factor of 1000. Make it 153 kiloJoules.

Sounds like pretty standard millimeter wave radar. They are also
talking about using van mounted units to "see" thru the walls of
houses. 

Of course the current trend to use foil backed fiberglass insulation
tends to render it pretty useless. :-)

I agree as a example I would hold up the Harn World material by Columbia
Games. Columbia Games, working on a tight budget, has chosen to put out
quality (in layout and materials) supplements very slowly. They are
notorious for missing deadlines but once a product is out it is very good.
Since they have been doing this since the mid 80\'s there is now a great of
material for harnworld. I have nearly everything for Traveller and Harn
and the Harn stuff occupies 3/4 of a shelf versus a full shelf of
Traveller stuff (excluding the board games).

The point is that we need a company who only produces Traveller material
on a regular basis when it is done and good quality. It would take a few
years to fill a shelf but we would know it is good and usable and we would
have the prospect of more.

Travelling 1 Parsec (3.26 LY) in 42 days obviously ignored c - at least if

I would assume that would require another contract. My plate is full enough

   And I\'m saying that it is a GURPS variant, and further, that we are
basically wasting our breath trying to convince each other otherwise.

>It cannot possibly be GURPS because GURPS is a generic rules system. 

   Once G:T comes out, go to your FLGS and ask where Traveller is.  You will
be taken to a display of Imperium Games products (possibly with some back
TNE and MT stuff laying around).  Ask where GURPS TRaveller is and you will
be taken to the display of GURPS materials.

   GURPS be definition can us any setting at any time--G:T just happens to
be one of them.

   No it\'s a variant produced by Steve Jackson Games for its GURPS game system.

   At no point did I say that classic Traveller sources wouldn\'t be useful
in putting together G:T write-ups.  That\'s not the issue.

>Many many people (not me) have said that MT and TNE were a horrible
>mistake and should not have been allowed to happen.

   But they did happen and the official timeline reflects that.  If you want
to use something other than the official timeline to play at home or even
write something up for others to use, I don\'t have any problem at all with it.

>So here\'s a timeline where they didn\'t. Take it or leave it.

   A variant timeline, as in "this is how it could have happen instead"
rather than "this is how it really happened".  CT-MT-TNE is how it really
happened within the context of *Traveller*.

>Oh, and here\'s something to chew on:

<snip>

   All joking aside, Loren indicated up front that what he was doing was
unofficial in the context of the Traveller universe.  I look forward to what
he has in mind, but it doesn\'t have the same validity as the official timeline.

Further MJ Dougherty said...

   Once again with feeling, ***what you do in your own game is your damn
business***.  Use Klingons carrying light sabers and flying Viper fighters
fighting the evil Predator hordes for all I care.  This discussion for me
has *always* been about Storyline Canon, and the official Traveller timeline.

>Look. Have I managed to convey how utterly stupid this thread is? 

   Not really.  Have you conveyed that we are speaking two differnet
languages and are approaching this thread in such entirely differnet ways
and that continuing it is pointless and destructive?  Yes.

>GURPS is a Traveller variant as valid as all the other Traveller variants
>like TNE and MT. 

   ARRRRRRRGHHHHHHHH!!!!  This statement is totally and utterly false, and
the kind of thinking I\'ve been arguing against for the past few days.  MT
and TNE were not and are not variants.  They were the ***official*** rules
for Traveller, and contributed significantly to the progression of the
official timeline.  G:T *by defintion* is a variant--what occurs within the
context of its universe has no validity within the official timeline or
Storyline Canon.

>Play it if you want. Or don\'t. Who cares?

   Well at least we agree here!

>Releasing GT is not going to cause virus-laden rocks to fall upon us at
>significant proportions of c, not will it make Starship Troopers any more
>like the book. 

   Until 2028 anyway...

>But it might just be fun to play or steal ideas from!

   I own a copy of GURPS: Mecha and I am stealing ideas from it on a
periodic basis.  By all means, if it works and it can be adapted to
Traveller use it!  That is not the point of the discussion.

>There are those among us who are not merely jusging the book by it cover,
>but judging the book and its authors by their own miserable preconceptions
>of what the cover might possibly look like....

   1) I have at no point said, "don\'t buy "T4" because the Foss art sucks.
Have I expressed my displeasure with it?  Yes.  Cover art never sold me a
book--it might have drawn me toward it and gotten me to open it, but it was
the interior that made me take it up to the counter.

   2) If anyone here would like to buy GURPS material feel free.  Hell,
drive/fly to Texas and purchase the contents of SJG\'s warehouse for all I
care.  It will still not make G:T official within the context of the
Traveller universe.

   *More* than enough said....

   IIRC, this credit was given because of Marc\'s originial work on classic
Traveller.  By the time MT was released, he had become a consultant at GDW
(please feel free to correct me if I\'m wrong Marc or Loren).

   Ditto Frank Chadwick, who was still a GDW employee (actually I think he

   DGP people who were primarily responsible for MT\'s development.  Not

"killing" Strephon and coming up with the original concept.

   Same as above.

   The manuscript for basic set of MT books was produced in Idaho (where the
DGP staff was located) and then shipped to GDW for a final look over before
being sent to the printer.

GURPS is Generic, so there are rules for all kinds of stuff but you
don\'t have to use them all in each game or campaign.  In fact, you
are encouraged to pick and choose and there are suggestions for ways
to do this.

Yeah, and we could have HighPop HighTech sectors like Massilia refusing to
pay their Imperial taxes in full but the Imperium has to thread lightly or
they\'ll mess up their relations with such a powerful subject sector. ;-)

Ya know, Chris Seamens got me to thinking....Oh, Oh.  Eric\'s thinking again....

What has affected the way I developed my ideas of the Traveller universe?

Authors:

Asimov, Bradbury, and Clarke
Heinlein,  the early books..Space Cadet, Between Planets, etc.
Andre Norton, her early works
Carl Sagan
Michael Chrichton  (SP?)
Harlan Ellison

Movies and TV:

Any Ray Harryhausen animated movie
Any early 1950s/60s Sci Fi classics
Star Wars (This is what started my Traveller experience)
Star Trek
Babylon 5
X Philes
Any WW2 period movie
Event Horizon
Abyss
Alien
Predator
Species
Terminator
Blade Runner
Fifth Element
Starship Troopers (a disappointment to this Heinlein fan, but good action)

What I like is a "Space Opera" playing session.  Players becoming actors of
bigger than life characters.  What the hey!  Everyone likes an opportunity
to "Save the Universe."  So now I need to ask you TMLer friends of mine
these questions...

How do you remind yourself it\'s only a game?

How do you make it fun for your players?... not yourselves because your
enjoyment comes from developing, authoring and running your universe.

How do you maintain balance amongst players and the game system?

What made your sessions work and more importantly, where did you fail?

Let\'s not talk mechanics.  We\'ve seen where that train of thought can take
us.  Let\'s talk methodology.  And remember, these are things that work for
you as individuals and may not work for somebody else.

I\'ve had my share of "monster" player characters.  I\'ve also had my share of
excellent role players, more like actors if you ask me.  A share of good
sessions and bad.  Made some major oops! killed that party and oops! killed
that important NPC.

So reflect and give me your comments.  Feel free to contact me personally if
you feel uncomfortable about your negative experiences.

More on this later.

The main thing is that this is an insane weapon intended for short range
use
by a culturally violent people. For my game purposes these guns will have
recoil dampers so that they may be fired by a man.

Besides, with stats like ST 8 DX 6 END 9 we are just about sure to knock
someone out and kill them with one shot.

You wanted alternate game settings and you are going to get them!

Shortly my web page will list my "changes to the universe" which will
include, but are not limited to:

Gas Giant dwelling Madmen
Fuel skimming grates to keep Madmen from entering the fuel tanks
Axe Handles as a powerful weapon
Cabin Chair Legs as a MORE  powerful weapon
Helmets designed to negate a head strike by an axe handle
Madmen harvesting devices
Madmen planetary invasion modules
Nanotechnology designed to destroy a PC\'s ship which "evolved" and was the
cause of the Third Long Night in my game setting.

And so on and so on....

When everything is working right and everybody is honest, sure,
putting all your information on one card is a good thing.

But having everything on your Imperial ID isn\'t necessarily good.


Most Imp IDs I have seen are computer-based.  Every way someone can
legitimately alter information is another possible way for people to
hack into it an alter _more_ information.

So the Imperium will want official, formal Imperial IDs to be created
once, sealed, and never modifiable again.  If it\'s acting as a
passport, what they want and what they can have are slightly different
things, but that would be the ideal they\'re striving for.  So perhaps
it\'ll be WORM, no deletion allowed, and (as a security measure) you\'re
only supposed to put an Imperial ID in an official, sealed, Imperial
reader.  To delete something, you have to get a new ID.


Similarly, do you want to put your Imp ID into a bank machine you
don\'t necessarily trust?  What if it (a) eats the card (b) takes out
all your money without mentioning it (c) copies every bit of
information out of your ID so someone else can make a fake?  If you\'re
a suspicious person, having a separate bank card which only accesses a
smaller account is the answer -- and if you\'re going to that much
trouble, it\'s easier for the _bank_ to just give everyone bank cards
(or the equivalent).


Except in a few remakable instances, institutions do whatever makes
_their_ work easier.  Not whatever makes your life easier.

>The Tenants of the agreement are not signed.
The whole thing seems more like an extension to the Imperial Rules of War.
The RoW are to allow local governments to duke it out on their own planet.
As long as they don\'t spill into the interstellar realm or cause
unrelenting physical, environmental or economic damage, the Imperium says
fine. This seems pretty much along the same lines but for commercial
entities in space. Naturally, however, the Imperium is going to be a little
more nervous about spaceships doing such.

>1).  No participant will put any uninvolved population at risk (with the
>possible exception of passengers),
Passengers are, de facto, involved. I\'d drop the parentethical statement.

>or cause a major disruption in the economic capability of any
>single world or region.
This is problematic. The whole point of privateers is commerce raiding. The
point of a trade war is to cause economic disruption. Like recently the
baggage handlers went on strike in Dublin airport. This caused major
disruption to the economics of the city. There are plenty of
Company/Corporation planets. Strictly interpreting the above would mean
that these are off-limits instead of prize areas in such a war. I\'d leave
this out and let it be covered by the "uninvolved population at risk". I.e.
if the war causes widespread famine or a complete, lasting, collapse of the
economy, then is a problem.

>No use will be made of...
I would phrase this more generally. As you have phrased it someone could do
something clever (nanites?) and slip through. I would state it:
"No use will be made of any weapon with lasting physical, environmental, or
economic damage."
Additionally, in an Agreement like this it is important that it is also
stated how such dictates will be enforced or what will happen (other than
being an Outlaw of the Imperium) if they aren\'t. I\'d put in:
"Any departure from this will be costed by the Imperial Assessment
Authority and restitution made to the populace of the affected region."
The IAA are closely linked with the Imperial Revenue Comissioners. They are
greatly feared and greatly bribed by most Mega Corporations.

>2). Attacks and espionage will be limited to the companies involved
This begs the question, is corporate espionage illegal in the Imperium at
all? I think most counts would be things like "unlawful entry" or "false
pretenses" or such. Maybe this doesn\'t need to be here at all.

>Along the same theme, no individual shall be specifically
>targeted for assassination or elimination.
But a canteen of workers is OK? I think I would rephrase this to say that
efforts should be concentrated on physical assets, not sentient ones.
Maybe...
"Any attack targeted at the [human] resources of a company is an Imperial
felony and if carried out under the pretext of a Tradewar will
automatically be tried in an Imperial court."

>3). In the event of spaceborne combat, no ship which has indicated its
>surrender will be fired apon, ...
Lets assume that the Navy has seeded every system on the map with a
recording beacon that sits in the outer system recording all radio
transmissions. Thus we can add the payback clause:
"Participants allegating violations of this will be allowed to ask for a
search of Naval Monitoring data for indications of surrender."

>4).  Prisoners ...
Fine. Maybe a clause indicating that disputes are settled in Imperial Court
at a subsector level.
>Prisoners may not be ransomed
What is the difference bewteen ransom and a repatriation bond?

>5).  Passengers and consignors of cargo must be warned when a known
>tradewar exists involving the shipping agent.
I\'d leave this up to the papers. I\'m not in favour of the idea of
officially declared trade wars. It does kind of give the game away. Rather
I\'d assume we are talking about actions taken under a Letter of Marque and
extend the concept of a LoM to include agents of espionage, sabotage, ...

>6).  Any vessel specifically assigned the task of hijacking an opponent\'s
>shipping or attaching its facilities shall carry a paper and electronic
>letter of Marque authorizing such action by the company leadership.
I would slant this a little differently. A Letter of Marque is something
that protects the agents or attacking vessel. A company would much rather
hire pirates, since they bear no responsibility for their actions. However,
by giving a vessel a Letter of Marque the company is agreeing to take
responsibility for their actions. Rather like hiring mercenaries. So I
would emphasise this by maybe putting it:
"Any vessel caught conducting commerce raiding in compliance with these
agreements must carry a Letter of Marque authorized by the company
leadership defining what range of activities the company has hired them to
carry our. The company will be held liable in Imperial Court for their
conduct within the Letter of Marque. The captain fo the vessel will be held
liable for any conduct outside the conditions stated in the Letter of
Marque."

>Vessels and installations which are defenseless shall not be fired apon
>until personnel can evacuate or be evacuated, unless such personnel refuse
>to evacuate.
This I think is covered by the clause about not attacking the [human]
resources of another company. I\'d rather leave in the loophole whereby
people can refuse to evacuate and thus prevent an attacker destroying a
installation unless they physically board and drag them off of it first.
Makes for more adventure opportunity!

>...all rights to salvage...
I would tie this to the terms of the Letter of Marque.
"Any vessel or assets captured while operating under a Letter of Marque
become property of the authorising company. Any division of such or award
scheme must be specified in the Letter. Any disputes will be resolved in
the port the Ship is registered to, by mutual agreement, or by stipulation
in the Letter of Marque."

>9).  Such penalties ...
Again, I favour assessment and fines. That is more applicable to a
corporation. Declaring individuals Outlaws of the Imperium is fine for
something like privacy. But when supported by a company, who becomes an
outlaw? The Board of Directors? The Regional Head? Corporations understand
money. Also that sort of clause would be more in agreement with them as
they can assess the financial risk of engaging in tradewar.

Until the release of TNE I always thought of Traveller  as  \'soft
core\' SF ... sensible rather than  \'anally retentive\'.  (I  don\'t
want to be flamed by the gearheads, but I always felt FF&S should
have been a 2300AD product with its wonderful 3D map rather  than
a Traveller product ... and 2300AD should have had the GDW  house
ruleset, not Traveller.  But I digress.)



> I can pick up the one rule book for Star Wars, read it, and begin

That\'s as much a \'fault\' of  Traveller\'s  ambitions  as  anything
else.  Consider: how many joules of energy  does  a  light  sabre
need?  Would the power supply  needed  actually  fit  inside  the
handle (after taking into account the blade projector)?  How long
does it work before  needing  a  recharge?  Does  the  Star  Wars
economic model work?  Could the Empire afford to  build  a  Death
Star?

Agreed.  :-(  No, wait, I don\'t agree.  Sure DGP was  great,  and
both GDW and IG have released some stinkers,  but  they  produced
some good stuff too.

What a bargain!  Traveller is 2 games in one:  it  comes  in  kit
form, then there is the game itself.  Perhaps  the  cover  should
read "some assembly may be required".  GDW  didn\'t  just  produce
Traveller, it produced a \'game design workshop\'.

Hmmm ... I play AD&D then I stop ... I play Star Wars then I stop
... I play other games too, then I  stop  ...  but  when  I  stop
\'playing\' Traveller I\'m still thinking  about  it!  Tweaking  it,
amending it, growing it.

I just wish the next edition of  Traveller  comes  out  on  hole-
punched loose leaf pages.  Any errata, change, rule addition, new
source material can then be slipped into the appropriate place in
a ring binder ... along with my own campaign notes.

That\'s a good idea, since today we have to update our own ID\'s when the
information changes.  (Ask my wife about the nightmare she went through
trying to change her last name after we got married..it was the fourth
surname she had, and the computers choked.)

This would happen at the local office of the Imperial Consulate.
Travelling off world?  Already have an ID?  Go in, and the nice friendly
clerk will update the information.

>Similarly, do you want to put your Imp ID into a bank machine you
>don\'t necessarily trust?

I use daily a Bank of America VISA card that contains a great deal of
information about me.  I do buy things over the net, and use the card to
order pizza (frequently).  I do not worry overly much about the security of
the card, since from what I\'ve seen, VISA and BofA do a good job of
protecting their customers.

The same would be true for the Imperial ID.  To change it would require all
sorts of conformations and double checks. 

Let\'s say that I\'m a business man, about travel from Regina to Efate.  I
recently moved, and had my appendix removed.  I go to the Consulate,
present my ID, and state the changes needed.  The computer then checks my
story.  It confirms that someone with my name did sell a property at the
address listed on my ID, and purchased a house at the address given.
Medical records from the Cynthia Alledon Memorial Hospital indicate that I
was admitted with pre-critical appendicitis on 076-1104, and removal was
accomplished on an outpatient basis.  While this going on, both the clerk
and sensors are double-checking me personally.  Looking obvious deviances
from the card.

This procedure might take a day or two, but in the end I get an updated card.

I\'ve seen video of the CH-53E helicopter (the Marine Corps Super
Stallion) doing loops and barrel rolls.  Incredible to see such a big
helicopter upside down....  I understand that they retired the aircraft
immediately after the flights as it stressed the air frame as to be
beyond the safety limits for additional use....

Developing your minimalist suggestion, what more do you need than a unique
number on the card? This just serves as an index into a wide variety of
databases circulated for various reasons.
  For example, there might be a validation database. This might index the
number to a photograph, fingerprint, retinal ID, dental pattern, DNA
profile, or any number of other validation methods. When you use the card
for whatever (say at immigration) they would index the number against the
local copy of the database to prove who you are. This makes for all sorts
of fun if, for example, one world uses retnal scans exclusively but you
haven\'t had yours added to your profile in the Imperial Database.
  Although originally developed just for Imperial Customs control, it is
probably widely used by other institutions (much like the American Social
Security number is used as your College id in many places). For example TAS
probably uses it as your TAS id. So when you check into the TAS lounge they
swipe your card, validate your identity (using the Imperially distributed
database and whatever the common means is at the local TL) and then index
into their own database to find out your TAS particulars.
  This approach also removes the necessity for a single format for the
card. Your world of issue might print the number (10 hex digits, would that
cover the past, present and future Imperial Population?) on a plastic card,
memory chip, or clay seal. There are probably vendors in Starpors who will
make a copy of your card suitable to local machines. It doesn\'t matter if
they are easy to "forge". In and of itself it doesn\'t prove anything. You
need the validation database to validate that you match the number.
  Of course it is still subject to sabotage. IDs could be entered into the
database through illicit means and then sold off. Or you could hack into a
local services copy of the database (assuming it is only replicated
occasionally) and change the validation parameters, or you can comprimise
their local scanning machine. There is always the crude method of handing
over your id wrapped in a 100Cr note...

   So when we do we get the official Traveller rules for time travel, Marc?
Will it be in the basic "T4.1" manual or will it be a seperate sourcebook?
Afterall, it\'s not FTL communications....

An absolute truth.  This is the only system I\'ve ever seen that allows so
much expansion and variation.  I\'ve played in the original CT, played MT,
but not in the time period of the rebellion, and I\'ve had FF&S 1 and 2. 
Now, as an engineer, I can\'t help tinkering (took a gas heater apart when
i was 8, good thing it was summertime!!!)  Anyway, I guess I must fall in
the gearhead category, but this is the best, most accessible game I\'ve
ever seen.  Sure, theres Star Wars, and others that are clean, glossy,
simple, but then, if we wanted those things so darn badly, we\'d be
playing those instead of Traveller, right?  One thing I\'ve noticed since
joining the list, we\'re all passionate about our feel for whats right in
this game.  We seem to be letting this get in the way of productive
discussions though.  So, I would like to posit a few concepts, take your
best shots at em......

What ever era you play in, I\'ll bet its different than the next guy\'s
game in the same era.

What ever rule set you use (CT, MT, T4, etc.) I\'ll bet you have at least
5 homebrew rules for it.  

What ever rule set you use, I\'ll bet you have adjusted the TL of at least
2 items, so it *fits* better.

I\'d say at least half of you have seriously considered making a totally
new background for a campaign.

Now I know, I have been building a totally new campaign for the last
couple of weeks or so, with a new background, modified technologies, its
own unique empires, collectives, companies, etc., so my opinions may only
be that.  I\'ll keep being a gear head, and sit for at least an hour a day
cranking out new FF&S 2 designs on my spreadsheet, and enjoy the heck out
of it.  Lets just say that there are as many different games out there as
there are of us.  Some are closer than others, some not.  But lets get
back to discussions of mechanics, new task systems, technology, and
methodology (nice post on that by Eric Holmes).  Enough discussion on
what is or is not canon, Canon, cannon, kinnen, conan, or such.

OK?

I agree with Harold.  I just think its a silly debate.  Were it not for the
above plea for others agreeing with you I\'d have skipped this post
entirely.  I feel more strongly that this is "noise" to my "signal" than I
do about the subject itself.

Meanwhile, obusefultrav and still ontopic from the header, anyone know the
muzzle velocity of a TL4 canon known as a "4 pounder?"  I think that was
the \'standard\' of the British forces in Napoleanic times, right?

Anyone have opinions about the use of heavy vehicular weapons against
starships at close range?  Like the MT RPX Fusion gun vs a 30 ton ship\'s
boat at, say, 1000 meters.  Now that\'s a canon.

(Isn\'t distraction one of the principles of Jiu-Jitsu?)

     I appreciate the comments made by people about "Canon Storyline" and
so forth. I make the following suggestion as a way everyone can "agree to
differ" but still engage in positive dialog.
     I think we can pretty much assume that G:T is going to be mostly the
same sort of stable setting as CT. Yes, Loren hints at some underlying
friction, but obviously that can\'t be too much otherwise we\'d just have
Rebellion which, we know by contract, isn\'t going to happen. So what I\'d do
is assume that Strephon does carry on, serve his term as emporer and his
son Strephon II ascends the throne. _He_ is the one that gets assassinated
and start the whole cascade leading, ultimately, to the TNE setting. [In
fact, if Loren emphaises the growing instability of the Imperium that might
make for a cleaner segue into Rebellion rather than the rather sudden
collapse we were presented with.]
     For the day to day running of things in a RC campaign, moving the
death of the Imperium just one Emporer down the line shouldn\'t affect
things too much. Since the reign of a successor to Strephon is likely to be
well down the line from anything G:T produces that sort of assumption
shouldn\'t affect that either. Thus the two can co-exist without too many
problems.
     Sure, this sort of cut & paste stuff isn\'t stricly Storyline Canon,
and is unnecessary for those running things downstream who want nothing to
do with G:T. But if you are than maybe consider this a possible way to
allow you rationalise some G:T material without invaliding your setting.

Go to the CORE Web site and click on the Abellatra proposal.  Jo Grant has
the basic framework of a CCG for Traveller worked out to some extent, but
stalled when he couldn\'t see any support from this list.

I\'m afraid the time for a real, mainstream CCG has passed, which doesn\'t
mean there\'s no place for a fan supported effort...

Alright!  A subject with some merit.  I\'m presently designing a special
ship for my campaign, the Diasporan Systems, Inc. StarBrick drop box. 
Used by the Human Unity (one of the nasties in the campaign)  this
HEAVILY ARMORED 5000 dTon streamlined box is used for insertion of Unity
marines directly into combat situations.  It is carried by large troop
transports and dropped from low orbit right on top of enemy positions. 
No Starship Troopers though, you can expect any planetary defenses to be
getting hammer......er.......suppressed  while this is going on!!!  While
this vehicle is TL 17 (!!!) it still uses HePlaR drives for landing,
primarily for their shock and damage value.  Now, fusion guns.  I\'m
designing these from FF&S2, and dont have those stats yet, but on each
corner of the hull, as well as on the dorsal and ventral surfaces, are
large turrets for fusion guns.  Not only intended for hammering the
enemie\'s ground positions, these are also provided with fire control to
allow them to be used in the air defense and point defense modes.  Darn
right a fusion gun can be used against ships at point blank ranges.  As
long as your FC can track em, you can shoot em.  30 ton ship\'s boat? 
That poor suckers toast!!!  I\'ll post the stats on this ship sometime
next week.

When I get really offended I get incoherent. I was really offended to hear
the \'kick GT off the list\' demands and I started frothing. I\'ve not stopped
yet.

Coherent mode on:

1. I know GT uses a variant timeline. I know that. I KNOW THAT. 

2. MT and TNE are later versions of the game. Thus they\'re variants.
Official or no, they\'re variants of the original. Yet they\'re OK to discuss
on the list....

3. G:T IS TRAVELLER. It\'s set in the Traveller universe... written by
Traveller players and designers to be Traveller. Not \'based on\' Traveller,
but in content and concept a version of the Traveller game, right from the
hearts of people who love Traveller, to be a valid Traveller game,
alternate timeline and all. It\'s Traveller because the intent of the
writers - who should know what it is to be Traveller! - was to write a game
about which cold be said: \'We\'re playing Traveller tonight\'.

in the GT stable Imperium (it could be fitted in anywhere). Would it cease
to be Traveller? no. Because I wrote it to be a Traveller scenario. Not \'a
scenario based upon some of the concepts relating to Traveller\', except in
the same way that everything published after the 3 small black rulebooks
eas based upon what was in them.

5. You can hairsplit all you like. You can argue that divergent timelines
make it non-traveller. You can lecture me about what sort of canon
violations are acceptable and which aren\'t. You can send the Traveller
Inquisition to my house if you like. I don\'t care. Because Traveller is not
easily definable. There is no one clear-cut concept which is right and all
others wrong. What there is has little dio do with logical hairsplitting,
corrections of each other\'s semantics and general sniping. I\'m not
interested in that. 

6. What I am interested in is intent. The pure and wholehearted intent to
produce a Traveller game. The same intent that led down the Rebellion and
TNE path. The same intent that launched CT. An intent that comes from the
heart and not from some small-minded desire \'to be right\'. The intent is
for GT to be a Traveller game. Therefore it has a place on the list and I
will defend that place against all comers.

7. I have a 50% Traveller scenario here. 50% as in Schrodinger\'s cat is 50%
alive. Y\'see, I haven\'t decided who to submit it to. If I send it to SJG,
does it cease to be Traveller? (I know that some of us will say yes, and
provide many reasons why. I laugh derisively in their faces, for my intent
was pure. I wrote a Traveller scenario. I know what it is.)

8. I\'m just really sick of this, but so offended that I can\'t let it go.
I\'ll say it again. GT is Traveller - with an unofficial timeline - and has
a place on this list. If you can\'t handle that then please go away.

9. And try to remember: Traveller came before the Imperium. The three
rulebooks were a generic system which could use any setting. It was just a
certain \'feeling\' that made it Traveller: projectile firearms, jump drive
taking one week, no FTL radio, no magic force fields or trasnporters.....
THEN along came the Imperium with its oh-so-vital-and-sacred timeline.
Traveller predates the storyline canon, therefore being non-official in
terms of storyline does not stop the game being Traveller in the same way
that the Imperium of Adventure 1 was just a setting for Traveller. It becae
the official one, but.... aw, that\'s enough logical stuff. My brain typed
all that. 

10. My heart says.... who cares? G:T is Traveller because it looks, smells
and feels like Traveller. Because the writers intend it to be Traveller.
Play it, or ignore it. The world is imperfect, and GT is now part of that
imperfection, as are we all. Just cope.

There is no such thing as a fixed game system.

I have played (for more than five sessions) AD&D, Falkenstein, Amber,
RuneQuest, all four Traveller versions, James Bond, Top Secret, Gurps,
Hero, SuperWorld, Space Opera, and so on.  Only Traveller and Runequest
have supported games that ran for more than a year.

They all sorta worked, but they all lost it eventually.  For example, I
have not rolled a task in Traveller in six months, though I have throw
oracle dice roughly four or five times in that period.  (When the players
do something, and success matters, but I have not thought out the plot, and
do not have a clear conception of whether they will succeed, I grab a
handful of dice, and toss them, and from that, figure out whether things
went well or badly, and what kind of variance there was.)

I keep returning to Traveller, and Runequest for the backgrounds and for
certain parts of the rule systems.  I am slowly working towards my own set
of minimal rules that covers everything.  I am thinking of making a set of
Falkenstein skills that cover an outer space game, and then making a set of
growth patterns that cover change with time.  I can then graft the real
world physics of the world onto the character abilities.

I find the opposite - once I have a decent system put together, I ignore
most of the rules.  It is background that saves me time, and Traveller and
RQ have the best backgrounds out there.  In general, once you strip away
the foolish rules, the rest of it makes a lot of sense.

This is not a problem.  At least the T4 stuff is still out there, and the
Gurps folks will be creating new things with similar assumptions to those
you are used to, and a common history, up to a point.

I suspect it will still get published by someone.  Marc is not going to
waste his time with a book that will never be published.  He is too smart
for that, so if IG folds, 4.1 will come from somewhere, I suspect.

>Now, it looks like T4.1 won\'t be published.

More properly, it looks like IG will fold.  T4.1 may well come into existence.

I read it, and it did not have enough meat for me.  Space Opera was much
more fun for space opera in my opinion, though it\'s combat was so
complicated as to be unplayable.  Gurps Lensman was good space opera.

Good production values are neat.  That is what attracted me about
Millennium\'s End.

Fewer editions -> fewer bugs.  The more you model the real world, the more
work it takes, and the longer you live, the more rules you get.  Gurps has
managed change fairly well, I think, but is not good about providing
adventure fodder.

>I can pick up the one rule book for Star Wars, read it, and begin playing

Try Falkenstein or Gurps Lensman, then.  They may fit your style better.
Traveller has complexity partly because it has so much history in it.

DGP has certainly made the best stuff in Traveller history, even if the
physics did have gaps and they got lazy about world generation.  They
certainly had a far better understanding of how to run a game than anyone
else I have seen in the Traveller stable, though this is open to argument.
Partly, I just thought the feel of the NE was repellant, so it was hard to
like Dave Nilsen\'s stuff.

>Traveller, for me, is a case of the love of the universe outweighing the

Be warned, switching game systems does not help.  Every system has rules
flaws, at least if you are a rules lawyer.  From your work on the task
system, I would say you are.  I am when it comes to craft design and
economics, and I screw with every system I use in these areas.

Yes and no - the time scales involved were quite long.  In the same period
of time, D&D changed roughly as much.  Further, a CT adventure was quite
playable in MT with the MT rules, and often benefited.  It was with the New
Era that the system changed completely.

This has been a failing of many systems for some time.  I do not understand
why authors find it so hard to just generate up a few damn maps.  As far as
NPCs go, you may be working too hard.  I generated up some blank ones, and
got a wonderful book on character names from Writers Digest, and now I
generate everyone on the fly.

Two reasons - IG did not have the desire for decent production values that
SJG does.  2.  Traveller attempts to model the real world, not a fantasy
world, which means things are harder.  RQ did a good job in the fantasy
arena, partly because the authors were SCA people.  It is hard to do that
in Traveller without a few engineers on staff, and engineers are expensive
people.

You mean, a fifth new rules system?  This is the same argument I suspect
they have used before to justify the previous three successors to CT.  I
thought MT was better than CT, and I am sure Dave, Loren, and Co. thought
that TNE was better than the previous two.  Coming out with FF&S was one of
the best moves I have ever seen a gaming company make.

Enjoy Star Wars - it seems reasonably well supported, and at least you do
not have to explain the universe to new players.

I rule that anyone who travels off planet must have such a thing, much like
anyone travelling out of country needs one today in many countries.

I also have made that change that only a small fraction of people are
citizens - I am currently trying to find a way to get roughly 1-5% of the
people citizenship.  right now, I am using nobles and honorably discharged
veterans in Imperial service, plus those members of planetary armed forces
who received Imperial training and took an Imperial oath.

All Imperial citizens have such an ID, while all Planetary citizens may
apply for one for travel purposes.

<The part I should have sent just to David>

Fairly simple - point based systems lead to a kind of minmax character
generation that annoys me.  (e.g. always buy very high stats, and then you
are good at everything.  Individual skills are not cost effective.)  I
would much rather have a Falkenstein or Amber style game where a lot less
is written down, and I have to play it more by ear.  Further, GURPS is a
system made to answer many potential questions, which constrains the game a
bit much, and adds to the accounting burden of the game.

FWIW, the GURPS players I know do not see these as great problems, it is
just not my style of game.  I did play a Traveller game under Gurps rules,
and it went OK, but not stellar.  As a result, I suspect that if you did
not find any serious flaws in the GURPS rulebook, you probably won\'t have
real problems in play.

<The part that justifies sending it to the list>

I am now moving to a new rules hybrid:

There are on the order 24 skills.  These include physical stats as well as
skills, and a character will rarely be notable in more than two or three,
and might have familiarity with one or two more.

Combat is log-based, such that if your armor is substantially better than
the attack, or your skill is substantially better than the opponent, then
you win.  If they are equal, then details matter, and if they are worse,
you lose.  Ties are pretty rare.

Tasks still exist, and may even name Traveller skills, but are all resolved
based on the 24 master skills, and the more numerous Traveller skills are
all subsumed by them.  The others are "color."

I understand Corps has a much smaller skill tree.  Does anyone have such a
list put together for Traveller skills?  Or, for that matter, a short list
of the real categories of character archetypes you have seen in Traveller
games?

Thanks for the clarification.  Are you sure that Frank Chadwick was DGP? 
He is listed in the credits of CT books, MT books and TNE books.  Did he
leave GDW and come back?

You said modules that can be run as they are with no need to do any work. 
All three of these adventures can be run straight from the book.  I\'m not
exactly sure what you\'re getting at with this.  I could sit down with my
playing group on a Tuesday night and run any one of those adventures
without having to do any work.  That is what you were saying, right?

One of the three (the Annic Nova) you can put anywhere in the Traveller
universe, Shadows you could put on just about any world with a nasty
atmosphere, and the Kinunir assumes you are playing in the Spinward
Marches.  Each adventure has the full compliment of maps and descriptions
you would need.  The Kinunir has all NPCs listed in full.

Okay, let\'s dip into real life her for a moment.  By your argument, every
factory in the United States is completely automated.  This is not true. 
It is "cheap," but it is cheap on a scale that is not beneficial to most
folks.

Take an automobile factory with a high level of automation as an example. 
Was installing the robots, creating the software, and interfacing the
hardware cheap?  Was ironing out the bugs in the automation process cheap? 
No.  But, it was cheaper in the long run than having people do the same
jobs.  It was cheap because the switch over was on a grand scale.  Does
that mean if I started up my own factory, automation would be cheap for me
to implement?  No.  Based  on my needs, it could be more expensive then I
could initially afford, and it could be completely cost ineffective in the
long run.  Expensive.

In the case of a series of automobile factories automation is "cheap".  In
the case of an individual widget factory automation is expensive.

Now, a free trader is made, say, with the intent of being crewed by people.
 AIs and an extremely high degree of automation weren\'t installed in the
ship initially because it was cheaper not to do so.  The intent was that
people would run the ship.  As a result, life support was installed,
command consoles, etc.  The AI to run the ship would be too expensive for
the average free trader crew to purchase and to upgrade.  Hence, the
automation has to be retrofitted.

That\'s assuming with a 20th century view of things that "nobody would
answer".  That\'s kind of archaic 4000 years in the future.  This can be
easily remedied.  But this paragraph shows a massive rift between our
campaign styles.  When I\'m running a game, the pilot switches his ship to
automated control for take offs and landings from population centers (where
big cargo ships would be going), as the on planet/in system space traffic
control grid is more efficient at making sure ships don\'t crash.  That\'s my
style.  There is no need to contact big cargo ships to arrange courses.  In
fact, it is required in my campaign that take-offs and landings from
population centers be strictly controlled by the space traffic control
folks.  There\'s too much of a chance of some hopped up, hotdog Free Trader
pilot buzzing the Grand Arcology and taking the top off in the process
(exposing its 10,000,000 inhabitants to the vacuum/ corrosive atmosphere/
very thin atmosphere/ what have you).

Working passage is something that I could never rectify in my own mind. 
You\'ve got this huge cargo ship with tons of goods that a megacorp is
making a sickening profit off of, and they\'ll take Joe Schmoe, Free Trader,
on for a working passage without the ability to make a background check
(due to the Canon concept of extremely slow communications)?  He could be a
pirate plant, he could be a terrorist, he could be a spy or agent for
another Megacorp.  He could be any other sort of saboteur or loony or
whatever...  This doesn\'t fit with my own view of Megacorps.

Note, I\'m not saying your view isn\'t valid, but just pointing out how this
is opposite of my own view of the way these things work.

If background gets broken, I will honestly shed no tears.  As I said, the
size of the resulting crack in the background should be taken into account,
which is where I came up with Big C Canon vs. Little c canon.  Big C Canon
stuff is the stuff that makes Traveller what it is, and has remained
through all four versions.  J-Drive: A cap of J-6, one week for a jump
regardless of distance.  Communications: Information travels only as fast
as your fastest jump.  Rulership: A noble class based on duty and honor
(although not always acting on those precepts), a high degree of autonomy
for individual member worlds.  Trade: Megacorporations dominate the space
lanes, but yet are so top heavy that various parts of the same Megacorp may
war with each other not realizing that they have the same parent, free
trade between individual planets.  Aliens:  The Various alien races and
their traits, a human dominated Imperium.

These are the Big C Canon concepts.  In addition, many huge historical
battles and events are big C Canon (too numerous to list here).

Everything else is little c canon, no matter how much each individual on
this list, or elsewhere, likes it.  Traveller should be flexible enough to
deal with new and real technologies or it will fail, plain and simple.  No
new player wants to take the time and learn about the background if his
intelligence is insulted when they say, "Well, the Imperium doesn\'t really
believe in automation, so computers aren\'t really all that important," when
the PC sitting across his room is a massive part of his life for work,
play, research, etc...

Yes.  Mass-produced automated ships with a very specific function is
tweaking.  It doesn\'t tear the Traveller universe in two.  PCs will still
have the same skills, and they will still interact with brokers, other free
traders, and the full spectrum that they did previously.

I already do.  Nanotechnology plays a huge role in my campaign\'s subplot
involving the Ancients and a decimated seed colony.  Nanotech is in my
campaign in a manner that the players can see in certain equipment and
items.  Biotech exists, but doesn\'t have any direct effect on the PCs that
I\'ve needed to explain or bring up just yet.  Neither of these things have
split Traveller asunder,  I might add.

Hype and hysteria?  Well, yes and no.  Sure, there\'s alot of hype about
these things today.  Apparently both the Japanese and NASA are both pouring
money into nanotech, so at the very least they believe there\'s something
more to it.  The Japanese are very driven in that direction.  Genetic
engineering?  Hardly hype.  There already exist a large number of things
that are the result of genetic engineering, there\'s that one cure for that
birth defect in the lungs (been a long time since I\'ve read up on it, but
basically it is a re-engineered version of the common cold that fixes
it)...  Let\'s see, there\'s that algae that eats petroleum products they
made a while back.  There has been some engineering done on livestock and
food crops.  Hardly hype.  Virtual Reality?  I\'ll bite, even though that\'s
not one of the points that I was really driving at.  The U.S. Army has this
kickass tank simulation that is run on a network that allows tank crews to
practice their hearts out and skirmish with each other...  The U.S.
military (and the militaries of other countries I would imagine) have used
flight simulators with varying degrees of sophistication for years.  The
modelling of reality has resulted in increased efficiency in cars and
planes as the vehicle can be "built" before it needs to be built. 
Architects are using VR to check their final designs.  In the field of
chemistry, a special form of VR has been used for at least 20 years so that
creating chemical structures becomes as easy as playing with building
blocks...  Again, quite a bit more than hype.  Cloning is a great
achievement in and of itself, but it stands even more, as proof of how far
we\'d come in such a seemingly short time.  That second clone was even more
important, because it opened the door for the possibility of organ
transplants and all kinds of crazy stuff like that.  I\'d have to check my
articles again to give you the details.

So, no, I\'m not an engineer, but I keep up with this stuff as a hobby.  But
as a hobbyist, I can already see that these things will play an important
role in our future.  Now, you say that these things are far off...  How far
off are they after all?  Traveller takes place thousands of years in the
future, is that far off enough?

Who knows what they would have thought.  I know that I am constantly amazed
at the little wonders in the world that didn\'t exist when I was growing up,
let alone when my parents were growing up.  But that\'s besides the point. 
Yes, technological predictions are only reasonably accurate within a couple
of decades or so...   Traveller was made 20 years ago.  The last widely
accepted major add-ons were written by DGP about 10 years ago.  TNE was
written 5 years ago.  The world changes.  I\'m not saying these things
should become unchanging bitterly contested canon that 20 years from now
will be a perfect prediction of the future...  Hell no!  If I could predict
the future perfectly I\'d be out playing the stock market, not in here
talking about a role-playing game...

Sure, predicting the future is not entirely accurate.  I never said it was.
 But we are playing a role-playing game set in the _future_...  Trying to
predict the future is downright required.

Then with this attitude my campaign is not Traveller.  I\'ll make sure to
boo-hoo about that later.  It is kind of insulting though that someone
would say this, considering that fact that a vast majority of the things
that are now canon Traveller (specifically technology-wise) weren\'t in the
original 3 LBBs.  So, if I come along now, I can\'t play "Traveller", but
those folks that happened to be lucky enough to write in to the old JTAS
when it was in its full glory were allowed to add stuff and still play
Traveller.

Personally, in my opinion, that\'s kind of skewed.

Cybernetics is a touchy subject.  When this discussion first came up months
ago, I made great pains to point out that I\'m not trying to turn Traveller
into cyberpunk or anything remotely resembling it.  This runs into problems
with game balance as well as aesthetics.  Personally, I\'m a big believer
that people like to keep their bodies intact as much as possible, but, if
you start allowing all sorts of crazy cyberwear, then it becomes to the
players "advantage" to chop himself up and become decked out.

But this can be easily limited by a good GM with decent players.  Every
rules system is open to excess.  In fact, I can think of several methods
that would limit cybernetics even better than just saying, "the Imperium
jus\' don\' like it, thasall!"

Bioengineering on the other hand comes in so many different shapes and
sizes that, at least in my own humble opinion, would be all over the
Imperium.  Medical treatments, cloned limbs, etc...  Bioengineered plants
and animals helping to terraform a potential colony world.  Megacorp super
soldiers...  The possibilities are endless.  But bioengineering is one of
those things that already exists to some small extent within the framework
of the Imperium already.

It\'s where the bioengineering meets the cybernetics that\'s really
fascinating, at least to me.

Yes, you can have a little bit of nanotech.  There are several different
theories as to how these things will be achieved.  And they are theories. 
This one would take alot of pondering and alot of thought which I\'m not
prepared to do at this very moment.

Now, as I\'ve stated, I\'ve no problems with handwaves with good reason. 
Game balance is the best reason of them all.  If something doesn\'t fit with
the balance of the game, I\'m all for tossing it without a second thought.

That\'s only if the robots can do it better and cheaper, and, as with any
piece of machinery, things aren\'t sufficiently cheap unless they are made
in sufficiently great numbers.  In addition, what could make AIs more
expensive is a certain amount of psychological instability which has to be
"tested out" from models already made.  The complexity is so great that
even the tiniest variations in quality from one model to the next can have
dire consequences.  In the case of "strong" AI, which is programmed from
the top down, you\'ll stop at expert systems.  Relatively cheap, but
inflexible and focused on only one or two skills.  The ability to learn is
somewhat limited, and can be "switched off" to save resources.  In the case
of "weak" AI they would be grown from the ground up.  They would be far
more flexible and would be capable of a wide variety of different tasks. 
These versions would have a greater chance of being "psychologically"
unstable, and their creation would almost be more of an "art form" as
opposed to a flat-out scientific task.  They would be relatively expensive
as a result of this.  The "fine wines" of AI.

Fine.  Then similar sidesteps can be made to insure that other technologies
aren\'t too overbearing or far ranging.

I was using the symbology of silver jumpsuits and flying cars to get across
the point that there is a cliff in the technological viewpoint of
Traveller.  It isn\'t just technology, there are cliffs in other things
concerning Traveller.  Specifically, it boils down to one thing.  There is
a "golden era" of Traveller and everybody\'s too afraid to do anything that
might upset that apple cart.  We all sit around with well worn old books
and anything that deviates from a paragraph in one of them is just blown
down and trampled.  This is where Traveller has run into a problem, and
this is a problem that will have to be faced if Trav is to have any sort of
renewed commercial success.  People (like myself) don\'t like and aren\'t
going to
like being told, "Hey!  You can\'t do that!  It violates a paragraph in a
book (or magazine) you have never seen that was published when you were six
when nobody thought of that concept yet!"

> I dont believe you can update the core technologies that underlay the
> storyline. You will have something, but not Traveller.

Then Traveller is dead in the water as far as a system goes.  If Traveller
is limited merely on the basis that new players can\'t tinker with it to
include the sci-fi concepts that they grew up on (which are different than
what the original Traveller generation grew up on) then Traveller cannot
attract any new blood.  It just so happens that I wasn\'t into Traveller
when I was 6...  So as a result, I don\'t have the same freedom that the
people who wrote for JTAS or the Traveller Digest, or DGP\'s supplements, or
the early Trav supplements had...

That will turn a hell of a lot of people off.  Plain and simple.

> I\'d also like to point out that the other SF RPGs have also gone pretty
> badly, as far as survival goes.

Yes.  Traveller has managed to survive due to a dedicated core group of
players.  A dedicated core group that is ever dwindling due to attrition. 
If you can\'t keep the core audience, then you sure as hell are going to
have serious problems when it comes to attracting new ones.

> The vast majority (and I\'m talking 95% plus) of cargo gets carried via
> shipping companies leasing space in freighters.

And probably the vast majority of cargo will be carried on Megacorporation
freighters in the future.  The Free Traders struggle for that extra 5%
which is still enough to turn a profit, thanks to their flexibility.  Not
sure what the problem is here.  At least this is how I personally
envision the effects of Megacorps in the Imperium.

> Such as ? Free Traders are a wonderfully romantic concept, and an
excellent
> way of turning a starship deposit into nothing.

Such as anything that the megacorps won\'t handle.  Arms shipments to small
guerilla bands, illegal cargos (either illegal at the world of creation,
smuggled out, or illegal at the receiving world, smuggled in).  Cargos that
don\'t work out to be profitable in bulk, but a Free Trader crew can turn a
profit on (live animals, exotic fruits, vegetables and spices).  Cargos
that Megacorps haven\'t made deals with the manufacturers or distributors
yet...

The list could literally go on and on.  The wide variety of individual
member worlds and possible cargos to and from those worlds makes an
infinite amount of possibilities for the PCs to be able move goods.

Of course.  :^)

No.  There\'s always room for adventure in any society.  Especially since
deviation from major canon points would be kept to an absolute minimum.

And if anything I fiddle with violates a paragraph in a book published a
couple years after I was born, then I will hear about it, often rudely.

My view of the Traveller universe is entirely different.  My view is that
it\'s something that is so huge and new that you can\'t just say, "Well, it\'s
kind of like the 19th Century only this time with lasers and spaceships". 
That was the original intent of the game, but since then it has grown and
matured by leaps and bounds and is something that is fascinating in its own
right.  That\'s what I like.  For example, the existence of Imperium-wide
Megacorporations changes the dynamic immensely.  If you\'ve got these huge
monolithic corporations, why would they pull their punches so that the PCs
can actually find viable trade routes?  They wouldn\'t do that.  They would
build huge freighters and establish profitable trade routes and try to cut
the little guy out anywhere they could.  That\'s the nature of a huge
business like that,  and that\'s Canon, whether it\'s romantic or not, and
whether the cargo ships are automated or not that\'s the way that things
would be...

As I\'ve said, I don\'t want slavish devotion to reality here.  It\'s a game. 
I like the simplest route when playing a game.  I describe to the PCs what
needs to be described, we play, we have a good time.  When I go home, I
work on my own campaign background, my adventure for next week, and I try
to work things in that the PCs are interested in.  My request for an update
in Traveller\'s technology to bring it more in tune with reality isn\'t an
attempt to further bog down the game with pages and pages of description
that have to be read to the PCs and slow everything down...  It\'s an
attempt to free it up, and point out the major thing that I see as being
horribly wrong with Traveller and what keeps new players away.

Roleplaying has changed alot in the last 20 years (some of my very earliest
memories are of D&D), and I\'ve grown up with roleplaying.  Sci-fi has
changed alot in 20 years too...  And I think to a large extent that
Traveller should change with sci-fi and not lay muddled in the morass of
the "old school".  It\'s going to stagnate there, and I don\'t like the
thought at all.  I want to see new people with new ideas and new ways of
looking at things.  A new take on a game that I love so much...

That\'s all.  Nothing more.

Of course, there could also be versions for TNE and MT and T4...with

  I use daily a Bank of America VISA card that contains a great deal of
  information about me.  I do buy things over the net, and use the card to
  order pizza (frequently).  I do not worry overly much about the security of
  the card, since from what I\'ve seen, VISA and BofA do a good job of
  protecting their customers.
  
Simple scenario which illustrates why the your imperial ID should be
used for official ID verification:

OK, this Imperial ID functions as your bank card on planet fubar.
It\'s evening and you want some credits to go have dinner at your
favorite restaurant which happens to not take cards (they exist).  You
walk to the Bank of Fubar ATM, slide your card in, punch in your code.

Unfortunately, this ATM has a faulty palm reader/ retinal scanner/
camera/ whaever, decides you aren\'t you.  Rather than return your
"stolen" card, it retains it.[*]  Who knows, it might even inform the
police of a retained Imperial ID.  The fact is, however, that you no
longer have your ID.  Or your bank card.  Or any money to get home.
Tomorrow, when Bank of Fubar opens, you can get someone to pull out
your card, verify you are you, and give it back.  Tonight you\'re SOL,
with no dinner, no place to sleep, and no identification to show the
cops when they wake you up off that bench.

My claim is that there will be a crop of "official" ID readers, with a
nice official seal.  Naturally, these are rented for a fairly hefty
sum, to compensate the Imperium.  Any corporation which needs to
identify you will generate their own IDs, fulfilling their own level
of security (and paranoia), based on your Imperial ID.

In the above scenario, the ATM retains my bank card, legally, but I
still have my Imperial ID.  When the cops come by to roust me off the
bench, the little card which says "Must take this medicine because of
recent operation" is still on my person when they take me away.




  
  Let\'s say that I\'m a business man, about travel from Regina to Efate.  I
  recently moved, and had my appendix removed.  I go to the Consulate,
  present my ID, and state the changes needed.  The computer then checks my
  story.  It confirms that someone with my name did sell a property at the
  address listed on my ID, and purchased a house at the address given.
  Medical records from the Cynthia Alledon Memorial Hospital indicate that I
  was admitted with pre-critical appendicitis on 076-1104, and removal was
  accomplished on an outpatient basis.  While this going on, both the clerk
  and sensors are double-checking me personally.  Looking obvious deviances
  from the card.

Let\'s say prior to this you put your card into an unofficial machine.
It sucked every bit of information about you into its memory.  Someone
manufactures a fake, with your information except his description,
palmprint, etc.  Normally this would be really hard because you\'d have
to go all over the galaxy to get it, but you\'ve handed it to them.
The possibilities are varied at this point.

Unlikely?  Someone once set up a bank machine which wasn\'t plugged
into the network, and simply spat cards back out "unable to complete
this transaction".  End of the day, they had a nice long list of ID
numbers and PINs.  Instead of stealing money, you\'re smuggling
criminals offplanet -- something the Imperium doesn\'t want.  They can
slow it down by saying "Here are the official IID readers.  Don\'t put
your card in anything else."


In short, I think the IID is useful for
a. officially identifying you
b. Information which is updated infrequently, should be available, and
can be read off it with the Mark I eyeball.

	-Robert Ringrose
	 ringrose@ai.mit.edu

[*] Another reason corps give out their own ID.  Ever looked at a
credit card and noticed that it says something approximating "Card
remains bank property"?  This is so that, legally, they can take it
back.  Legally, my scenario isn\'t quite correct without a few changes
in laws to allow a fradulently used Imperial ID to be retained.  Makes
sense, though.  If you\'re running around with someone else\'s Imperial
ID, who has the right to take it away?

- ----    March 27, 1998    ----

So you think you are a Traveller geek (T-geek), eh?  The first step is to 
admit to yourself your T-geekiness.  No matter what anyone says, T-geeks are 
people too; T-geeks have rights.  So take a deep breath and announce to the 
world that you are a T-geek.  Your courage will give you strength that will 
last you forever.

How to tell the world you are a Traveller geek, you ask?  Use the universal 
IMTU code.  By joining the T-geek organization, you have license to use this
special code that will allow you to let other un-closeted T-geeks know who
you are in a simple, codified statement.

The single best way to announce your T-geekhood is to add your IMTU code to
signature file and announce it far and wide.  But be careful, you may give
other T-geeks the courage to come out of the closet.  You might want to hang
on to your copy of the code in order to help them along.

- ----

INSTRUCTIONS:

The IMTU code consists of several categories.  Each category is labeled
with letters and some qualifiers.  Go through each category and determine
which set of qualifiers best describes your Traveller Universe Preferences
in that category.  By stringing all of these \'codes\' together, you are able 
to construct your overall IMTU code.  It is this single line of code that 
will inform other T-geeks the world over of what a great T-geek you actually 
are.

Some of the qualifiers will very probably not match with your universe exactly.
Simply choose that qualifier that MOST CLOSELY matches it.  Also, some
activities described in a specific qualifier you may not engage in, while
you do engage in others.  Each description of each qualifier describes the
wide range of activities that apply, so as long as you match with one, you
can probably use that qualifier.

Also, pay particular attention to case-sensitivity, there may (in the
future) be a big difference between a \'tc\' and a \'TC\'.

- ----

VARIABLES:

Traveller Universes can seldom be quantified.  To facilitate the fact that 
within any one category the T-geek may not be able determine a specific 
rating, variables have been designed to allow this range to be included.

        @       for variable, said trait is not very rigid, may change with
                time or with individual interaction.  For example, Geeks
                who happen to believe that jump torps exist but dislike 
                using them might list themselves as j+@.
        ()      for indicating "cross-overs" or ranges.  Geeks who go from
                tc+ to tc-- depending on the situation (i.e. mostly "tc+") could
                use tc+(--).  Another example might be an tc++(**).  This
                would be a person who mostly uses Classic Traveler, but
                also has an extensive collection of other types of works.
        >       for \'wannabe\' ratings.  Indicating that while the geek is
                currently at one rating, they are striving to reach another.
                For example, ?t4>+
        $       Indicates that this particular category is done for a
                living.  For example, tg++$ indicates that the person
                utilizes GURPS Traveller and gets paid for it.  Quite a 
		lucky geek, for sure.

        @ is different from () in that () has finite limits within the
        category, while @ ranges all over.

*****************************************************************************
Section I: Rules Sets
*****************************************************************************
Classic Traveller:

	tc++	Bring back the LBBs!
	tc+	I appreciate this system and owe a lot to it.
	tc	It\'s a resource.
	tc-	I just can\'t see any reason to use it.
	tc--	I wouldn\'t let my ugliest, smelliest dog sit on these rules.
		It\'s a bane that would wreck Traveller forever if allowed
		to thrive.

	?tc	I don\'t know much
	!tc	I ignore these rules.

Likewise for the remaining rule sets:

	tm	MegaTraveller
	tn	TNE
	t4	T4
	tg	GURPS Traveller (for now, a mostly wannabe situation)
	tt	Traveller 2300
	to	Other rules set (CORPS, GW, etc)


Overall Rules Use:

	ru++	The Traveller rules are the best.
	ru+	The Traveller rules are superior to most.
	ru	I use the Traveller rules, more or less.
	ru-	I have modified significant portions of most of the Trav rules.
	ru--	I use mostly other rules systems.


Gearheadedness:

	ge++	Intricacy to the subatomic level, please!
	ge+	Details === Color
	ge	Some detail gives me the flexibility I need for the game.
	ge-	Too many rules and steps stifles me.
	ge--	Ack!  Must we try to explain everything?


Section II: Canonicity
*****************************************************************************
The 3rd Imperium:

	3i++	The 3I is a massive juggernaut, with an amazing tax
		base and thousands of SDBs in even minor systems.
		Interplanetary trade is robust.
		Many starports are huge city-sized affairs.
	3i+	The 3I is a powerful force to reckon with, with good
		control over most of its member worlds and the power
		to back its authority.
		Interplanetary trade is good on many worlds.
		Starports are planetary trade centers.
	3i	The 3I is a stable confederation, held together by the
		nobility of its population, but not all-powerful and
		overall not wealthy.
		Interplanetary trade is regular.
		Starports are common.
	3i-	The 3I is a loose, vulnerable sprawl of worlds, which
		by the way is no worse off than the other interstellar
		states.
		Interplanetary trade exists on major worlds.
		Starports are significant on major worlds but not so
		massive.
	3i--	The 3I is a picture of gross mismanagement over impossible
		distances.  It\'s a wonder it held together so long.
		Interplanetary trade exists on only the best worlds.
		Starports are, on the whole, rather weak things.

	!3i	IMTU, the 3I doesn\'t exist or is irrelevant.

Jump Tonnage:

	jt++	Jump torpedoes are not only canonical, but absolutely
		necessary for survival as we know it.
	jt+	Jump boats are do-able, economical in many cases, and cool.
	jt	Jumpships under 100t might exist in experimental form -- 
                but there are various problems with the design.
	jt-	Jumpships under 100t are too small, or they open too big 
		a can of worms.
	jt--	Small jumpships destroy Traveller.

	jt?	What\'s a jump torpedo?
	-jt+	Depends on my mood.

Starship Automation:

	au++	TL is sufficiently advanced that NO ONE need EVER crew
		a starship, unless it\'s just on the off chance of someone
		whacking the ship computers.
	au+	Starship automation is commonplace.
	a	Starship automation is in the trial phases, and has bugs
		to work out, or is quite expensive.
	au-	Starship automation doesn\'t work (for whatever reason).
	au--	Terrible things happen when the referee allows it!

Emperor Strephon:

	st++	Two timelines is a brilliant idea!
	st+	Two timelines will add flexibility to the game.
	st	Two timelines won\'t affect the game\'s popularity.
	st-	An extra timeline is a Bad Thing.
	st--	This will doom Traveller.

(see code for GURPS Traveller)


Life Support:

	ls++	Life support is very expensive and very difficult to work on!
	ls+	Life support is expensive and difficult to work on.
	ls	Life support can be do-it-yourself with off-the-shelf
		components.
	ls- 	Life support is a fraction of the cost published.
	ls--	Life support is absorbed in other misc expenses.


Section III: Aliens
*****************************************************************************
K\'Kree:

	kk++	I like K\'Kree roasted over a spit with BBQ sauce.
	kk+	I like K\'Kree only if it the meat is mixed into a haggis.
	kk	K\'Kree have a funny aftertaste...
	kk-	K\'Kree smell funny.
	kk--	All K\'Kree should be catapulted into the sun.

Hivers:
	hi++	Hivers are the Puppeteers from _Tales of Known Space_.  Fun!
	hi+	Hivers are convincingly alien.
	hi	Hivers are okay.
	hi-	I have some problems with Hivers.
	hi--	All Hivers should be ground into haggis.

You get the picture.  Follow the above model for:

	as	Aslan

	dr	Droyne
	
etc.

Section IV: Humaniti
*****************************************************************************
Solomani:

	so++	The heirs of the galaxy.
	so+	Basically a bunch of great guys.
	so	You know how humans are...
	so-	A bunch of bad eggs.  Rabble.  Trash.
	so--	Should be targetted for termination.

I echo this recommendation.  Did anybody else ever try to run a campaign
in the 3I setting with the Hero System?  Are there any other websites
covering this topic?

Y\'know, funny you should mention it!  :^)  I got this idea along with the

Here were my ideas:

Recycle Bin Empty - Imperial Starburst
Background - Starfield
My Computer - A nice earthlike planet

Those are my own ideas so far...  I\'ll get around to it eventually but i

Thanks for clearing that up Harold.  It seems that DGP stuff is hard to
find here in Philadelphia, although I keep looking.  I\'ve made some amazing
finds both on the internet and my local used bookstores (got a whole mess
of LBBs and JTASs almost a year ago now.  Damned good find.  2 bucks a pop,
all excellent condition).  People seem to hang onto their DGP products like
crazy though :^)

The point of that was I am relatively unschooled in the world of DGP.

American English is wierder than I thought - "Staff" has always had a long
"a" sound like in "far", and "staph" a short "a" like in "cat". I can see
your point, though.

By Jove, you\'re right!

H\'mmm, lesse.  I don\'t know, but it\'s possible.

We also had to walk up HUGE hills in 7 feet of snow just to get to a game
which was held in an old barn with no heat or lights in sub-zero
temperatures. On the way home ( which was also up huge hills in 10 feet of
snow ) we had to fight off wolves and bears with our rule books and dice
bags...

We also had to solve several non-linear differential equations
(simultaneously) and at least one 765,667 x 345,678 (loaded with imaginary
numbers) matrix just to calculate the ships attempt to reach orbit.... with
nothing more that 100 year old slide rules and maybe an abacus....

You kids have it so easy today with so many games and rules to choose
from....
Cars... Computers.... Charts...

    'body' => 'Chris Seamans had some excellent arguments about automation and minor 
changes in the Traveller universe.  I agree totally, it is entirely 
possible to update Traveller in important ways and still have it be 
Traveller.

In many ways this has already been done.  Fancy (but non sentient) robots 
are in frequent use in the Imperium.  So does bioengineering and cyberware.
In the MT adventure Knightfall there are NPCs the crew meets who have had 
their entire bodies below the neck replaced by enhanced robotic bodies (they 
are nobles from an exotic world).  You can\'t get much exotic than this.  
The latest Traveller Chronicle introduces fancy bioengineering, and TNE 
introduced it in a more limited way.

The Traveller universe hasn\'t crumbled, or even notably changed because 
of these introductions.  All you need to say is that most folks on 
most worlds aren\'t into this stuff.  A good reason for this
conservatism would be Vilani influence on many worlds.

Nanotech is also possible to introduce, but you are risking major changes 
if it is anything other than TL 21 Ancient tech.  

As Chris says, as long as we keep antigrav, jumpdrive, no FTL comm, the 
same aliens and the same history we\'ve got the same Imperium.  As i said 
before, the best way to keep all ships from being automated in the 
Imperium is to make a law against it.

For examples of how two very Imperium-like universes can work with all the
90s ideas about tech introduced check out Eluki bes Shahar\'s Hellflower
trilogy and Dave Trowbridge and Sherwood Smith\'s Exordium series. You have
nobles, jump drives a space opera feel + computer jacks and bioengineering.

yeah, like those enterprising young criminals who put a fake bank machine
in a busy mall back East last year. If you actually tried to do anything,
it told you it was out of cash, or that your bank wasn\'t talking to
it temporarily, but they collected hundreds of bank account numbers 
complete with PIN numbers. Something messed up, but they did get something
like a couple of hundred grand before they were caught, and if the scam
hadn\'t been interrupted, they would have gotten away with it.

Well, actually, no staph isn\'t a sexually transmitted disease. Staph (aka
Staphylococcus aureus, an extremely common bacterium that usually lives on
your skin with no problems) infections are common, usually in the form of
sore throats, minor skin infections, and post surgical nosocomial
infections, although a variant form of the Staph bacterium is the infamous
flesh-eating bacterium. 

<Groan-shudder> Oooohh flesh-eating bacterium and sexually transmitted are
NOT two concepts that should be in the same sentence!!

I agree completely.  For me as a referee, consistent and diverse
background information is much more important than the rules system. 
Not only does background save me time, but it makes a better experience
for my players than if I have to create everything myself.  Although I
think I\'m a pretty imaginative and creative referee, there is still the
danger that situations will start to resemble each other.  If other
people have designed some or most of the situations -- whether they be
worlds, organizations, vehicles, whatever -- the campaign will have more
of the flavor of real life\'s diversity, because those other designers
will have approached problems differently than I do.  

The foregoing, of course, is what works for my games, in which most of
the action revolves around the characters solving intellectual and moral
problems, rather than trying to accomplish specific, rollable tasks.

I thought this was hysterical.  They got something like $60,000 (not as
much as you would expect, I guess).  They didn\'t get caught, but their plot
was discovered...

They may have been caught since then, but at the time they had gotten away
clean and the police said that they didn\'t have anything to go on.

Brilliant if you ask me :^)

Note: you would have seen such comments regardless of the game.
Every game has its detractors, if only because every game can\'t
support every possible gaming philosphy, and the comments about
GURPS only show prove that it isn\'t some perfect nirvana of
gaming...

I have been running GURPS Traveller before it was even announced
and it does, in fact, work very well.  If you have questions feel
free to e-mail me.

I don\'t see this at all.  Factories are automated to the degree
that our automation technology allows.  The idea that automation
technology in Traveller is insufficient to allow automatic ships
is one that I would endorse.  To the degree that it is sufficient
to allow full automation, it doesn\'t fit with your analogy.  If
you are invoking that it is simply too expensive to automate
ships, that is simply another form of saying it is impracticle
to do it and is effectively in the "it\'s not possible" catagory.

Now, the arguement for automation of ships has been that it
is already possible to automate the tasks that a human would
be expected to do on a ship.  That say it will be cheap at
the TL\'s where you can build starships.  If you want to
say that this isn\'t true, and invoke higher cost, why stop
at a cost that means it will happen and you have to work
to make sure it only happens in places that don\'t affect
PCs (which, as I have stated, I\'m not sure exist) when
the same reasoning can leave you fully compatible with
the current background by just making it too expensive
for any use?

You really aren\'t going to be able to do complete background checks
in hiring (unless you wait months for the replies) since you
aren\'t going to be able to get data from off planet.  Unless
you plan to have replacement workers just sitting around
in case you have vacancies, you use an interview and what
data you can get locally.

>If background gets broken, I will honestly shed no tears.

I suppose if you handwave the automatic ships into carefully
constrained sitatuions, you can reduce it to "tweaking".  But
if you are going to do that much handwaving, why not just
handwave them away completely and save the contrive feel of
the ships only existing in certain roles.

I handle it differently.  Each member state of the Imperium is a
sovereign entity.  Its sovereignty is complete except where preempted by
Imperial edict -- for example, foreign policy and slavery.  In general,
member states may restrict immigration and emigration as they see fit.  

Sophonts are citizens of their member state first, and of the Imperium
second.  Every sophont must be a citizen of a member state.  All
sophonts who fit the statutory definition of Imperial citizen are
Imperial citizens.  That\'s a little tautological, so let me give an
example.  

My Imperial citizenship edict confers Imperial citizenry on, inter alia,
any sophont  
(1) who came into existence on an Imperial member state, on a starship
in jump space between Imperial member states, or on any facility of the
Imperium or a member state located within or without the Imperium; and 
(2) at least half of whose parents (as defined broadly to take into
account differences in reproductive biology) were then Imperial
citizens.  (I have not included the naturalization provisions of the
edict.)

Thus the child of a human Zhodani soldier and an Emerald farmer -- let\'s
call him Gani -- is an Imperial citizen. On the other hand, the child
born to the Zhodani Cultural Attache at Regina and her spouse would not
be an Imperial citizen.    

Let\'s assume that Gani also falls into Emerald\'s definition of citizen. 
He would be issued an Emerald passport as a matter of course, and would
use that to visit Jewell, Ruby, and other Imperial worlds.  Because of
the treaty relationship among worlds in the Jewell cluster, he doesn\'t
need a visa.  To visit the Zhodani side of the family, however, Gani
will have to obtain an Imperial passport, an Imperial exit visa, and a
Zhodani entrance visa.  

Members of the various Imperial services don\'t have to deal much with
local immigration controls; every member state has signed a treaty with
the Imperium under which it agreed to allow the bearer of a valid
Imperial Government ID to enter and leave the member state on Imperial
business as needed by the Imperium.  

Most member states issue special visas to merchant crews without regard
to the crew member\'s state of origin.  A typical approach is for the
member state to issue a visa to "the crew of the Free Trader Beowulf,
Imperial Registry No. XYX100100."  Anyone with a crew member\'s ID is
covered by the visa.  Usually, the immigration control checkpoints at
the starport will have a list of all ships which have received visas,
and the crew members crossing the extrality line just have to have their
crew IDs scanned into the system.  

Nobles don\'t get special treatment (except possibly expedited
applications).  Each is a citizen of a member state and the Imperium,
and would hold passports from both.  Their fiefs are granted from real
estate owned directly by the Imperium, and don\'t issue passports to the
nobles.  A fief might issue travel documents -- passports and visas --
if the noble controlling it saw the need.

Yes I can see it now, the residents/inmates denied anything sharper than

<scene: Some midly well known SF actor (from Star Trek - really the final

"This week is the annual appeal for the sufferer of "Traveller Overuse

to tell the difference between a SF roleplaying game and reality. This
condition was first diagonsed after the tragic panel debate at the First
Traveller Convention in 2001 on "Robots in the 3rd Imperium" which resulted
in 17 fatalities. As yet no effective treatment has been found for those
afflicted by this debilitating condition. Yet here at the Marc W. Millar

seach for a cure, whilst treating this diseases many victims.

At the Marc Millar Clinic, the patients are treated with the latest technics
and medications. It costs $5000 a day for the drugs the doctors need, another
$10,000 for those required by the patients. Currently five strains of TOSS
have been identified and it has been found that the sufferers of the
differing strains need to be housed in seperate wards, as it appears that
the interaction of the different strains leads to homicidial behavour in
those afflicted.

No.  Factories are not automated to the degree that our automation

are automated to the degree that automation is cost effective.

Well fine.  This argument is tiresome.  Automation is completely impossible
in Traveller.  Sci-fi staples such as robots cannot exist.  If they did,
then there\'d be nothing for PCs to do forever.  Traveller is the 19th
Century in space, despite the vast advances in technology and the
interesting possibilities that are opened by said technologies.

Okay, that\'s your way of seeing it.  Then in that case, the Megacorps are
entirely stupid and would never have gotten to the size that they\'ve gotten
if every Tom, Dick and Harry with Pilot or Astrogation-1 can manage to get
a working passage on their massive cash-cow cargo ships.  Megacorps should
now be declared non-canon because they would never be able to survive being
that stupid.

You\'re absolutely right.  Don\'t automate PC tasks.  Since you don\'t want to
automate PC tasks, you can\'t automate any tasks.  No robots.  No automated
factories.  No smart missiles.  No powerful computers (they would lead to
automation).  In fact, no sci-fi at all.  In fact, set the entire backdrop
to the TL of the early industrial revolution...  no, wait, the whole point
of the industrial revolution was to automate the manufacture of products...
 Can\'t have that.  No jump drives, no lasers, no plasma guns, no battle
dress, no contra-grav, nothing.

As I said, I\'m finished with this argument.  No automation can be allowed
in the Imperium, or the game is at risk. With no automation, all of the
background and canon that has been built over the course of 20+ years
cannot happen...  This makes the whole premise that the history of the
future has been built on absolutely absurd and ludicrous.  Kind of a catch
22.

Granted, you make a good point here, but on the other hand, this can
lead to interesting scenarios;  Characters with cyberware would be
naturally \'outlawed\' like psionics and black glode screens.  Sure you
could have them, but the Imperial forces would be after you all the

campaign.

Yes they would.  Unless, because of the horrid military application of
them, that they also are generally outlawed in the Imperium.  The stigma
of using them could be equivelant to say, someone re-creating the \'black
plague\'.  Certainly such things would be shunned in general as too
dangerous, because you could easily use nanomachines to commit
genocide.  Just program the little buggers to be airborne and attack
just a specific genetic code.  Again, people using this technology would
be outlaws, and in fact I would think because of the seriousness of THIS
offense, Imperial punishment would be \'Death\'.  Again, opens up some
interesing role-playing possibilities.

As to AI, I would put this at Tech level 17 or above; for actual
functional AI that is.  You could have rudimentary AI at tech level 15,
but subject to glitches and potentially dangerous and not really worth
the price.  Since the Imperium never really made it past Tech level 15
before the Rebellion/Virus times, I see this as a workable solution.

Fusion is not the \'cure-all\' that many think it is.  When you factor in
all the costs and difficulties of running a fusion generator, you\'ll
realize it isn\'t the "golden horn of plenty" that older science-fiction
writers made it out to be.  When *WE* achieve fusion power, it will not
serve all our energy needs as has been predicted;  fusion energy alone
is not enough.  It will have to be used with other sources.  In the
Traveller Imperium, I don\'t see it as the \'god-like\' energy source
either, but just more efficient then most other forms of energy.

Another source of power that is non-canon (as far as I know) is using a
singularity for a power source.  Just toss some matter into it and
collect the energy burst.

I care.  My three players care.  If the physics or the economics are
obviously, blatantly wrong, then they want to play in a different
background.  One that is not from the same company.

Let me a bit clearer, for the benefit of the authors in the audience, some
of whom get it right, and some of whom get it drastically wrong.

Traveller economics as written means that a star passage is the equivalent
of roughly $50K round trip.  This is not something the average person does,
and is in fact roughly what Astor paid (in present day dollars) for his
first class ticket on Titanic for six people.  I either ignore this,
causing my players to wonder why any space traveller is poor, given the
immense, incredible, unbelievable, astronomical value of the ship they are
in, or I revalue tickets and shipping costs.  I have vacillated on this for
much of a year.

Traveller physics states that I can make a near C rock that would pulverize
any fixed target you care to name.  No planet is defensible if you have
even 2000 stellar diameters to work in.  I solved this by fiat - you just
can\'t.  Drives only alter the kinetic energy according to the energy put
in, and thus are limited to a maximum speed.  Eris\' stutterwarp drive would
also work very well, and i may just lift it wholesale, as requiring fewer
changes.  I do not want to debate the merits of near c rocks, just point
out that the existence of this bit of bad physics makes anyone with any
background a bit unhappy - they know the consequences.


Both of these problems can be fixed by a number of different means, but
ignoring them means that my players have to guess at what will not work.
For example, nobody was willing to accept the Meson gun in the game, until
I noticed that all canonical sources capitalize the word Meson.  I could
state that it was clearly derived from a name.  Enter Robert T. Meson,
inventor of a particle that decays after a known, exact interval, and that
interacts with none of the four forces.  So, the physicist now knows that a
Meson screen is not something used to stop neutrinos, which a meson screen
as listed in classic traveller seems like it should do, given that both are
(IIRC) affected by the weak force.

Does this  matter in your game?  Damfino, but it does make a difference in
mine when someone gets a chunk of these bits of reality blatantly,
completely, and unreservedly wrong, and my players get clever.

PE gets a lot of things right, but it implies a universe where bigger
population is better.  Previous sources have also done so, but if this is
the case, one has to ask why worlds stay as small as they did over the life
of the Imperium.  A possible fix is to factor down the free spending cash
of any world of pop 9 or A, as Hans has done.  I do not know if I am
willing to do that, but it makes a big difference, so I just might.
Personally, I blame the algorithm, which is suited well to an area of space
that has been recently colonized.

Early Imperial history implies a suicidal expansion policy, and fleet that
are wasting their time to far away from the worlds that matter.  I cannot
imagine a cargo that is worth carrying to Lishun in the early years, yet
the Navy and the merchants are (theoretically) there.  This one I changed
without fear.

Now, how canonical is this?  In general, not bad up until I start fiddling
with worlds and future expansion history.  That is why I have not yet
completely redone the campaign universe - I am not convinced I want to lose
all of that.

Simply put - humans are more flexible than machines in the Traveller
universe.  You can argue this till you are blue in the face, but
eventually, all game systems need to come to one of three decisions:

1.  Humans are just plain better.  Robots do not take over anytime soon,
but humans may use hand comps to do grunt work.  You will never see an
automatic security system that is anything more than an enabler for an ever
smaller group of guards, but a good system allows one guard to do what used
to take dozens, as long as the invader has not spoofed it.

This describes Traveller TL0-12, and effectively through about 15.  From 12
to 15, robots can do ever more, and can be cost effective at their jobs,
but it is very rare to see a robot doing anything that requires an actual
decision, as opposed to carrying out a task.  Note, though, that anything
which is extremely repetitive will be roboticised by TL 12, simply because
it gets pretty cheap to build low skill, high repeatability machines.

2.  Humans can be augmented.  This is my Traveller universe from TL 13 to
about 18, in that people start getting bits added on.  For example, many
people with poor eyesight have genetic surgery in the womb at TL 15 to get
the defects corrected, but if the eyes are hurt, they will get either a
prosthetic or a cloned part.  By 15, implants are going to be better than
factory new equipment for most things.

3.  Robots are better, as they can be purpose built, if cost is not an
object.  This is the world of Ian Banks, as I understand it.  The AIs that
run things are vastly bigger and smarter than the humans involved.  This is
my Traveller universe from TL 18 and up.  By 17, they become AIs, and by
19, they can produce artificial Psionics.

(That which is unique about life is Psionic in nature, IMTU, following the
Penrose theory about intelligence being not fundamentally understood due to
an intrinsic unknowability.  For lack of a better term, call it a soul, or
a quantum observer effect.)

Given that most Traveller universes are very automated and roboticized, but
that humans are still in the loop, just what do the people do?  I generally
have automation make most easy stuff trivial and cheap, which is why
everyone is dressed in glowing silver suits.  Miles of artificial spider
silk cloth in one color is basically free, but the clever patterns that set
the good stuff apart costs, because it requires creativity.

IMTU, as the list has discussed over the previous days, real space and jump
space both use drive units that require constant work.  In real space, the
thruster plate drive need exacting local observations, constant adjustments
to drive fields, and careful plans to bring the ship to the jump point.
Some of this could be automated, but surprises happen, and humans are just
better at dealing with the surprises.

In jump space, the jump field ripples, bulges, and flickers constantly.  A
good navigator, pilot, and engineer can compensate for this, but need to
work at it constantly.

Good computer equipment helps.  By TL 15, you can run a ship comfortably
with just three well trained people - one per shift.  Without that
automation, your life gets very difficult, as you are always on call, and
never get to finish anything.  (The workload is not high, but it is
constant.)  As a result, you do not need many people at high tech levels,
since the computers handle the easy things.  At lower levels, it is a
constant workload for a lot of people, simply because automatic responses
are not sufficient.

If you do not have a very, very expensive machine running the system and
maintaining it constantly, you cannot get a reliable unmanned ship.  Even
with such machinery, a ship with a human on board is vastly more likely to
get to the destination than one without.  (This results from the Psionic
component of jump space - having the engineer fiddle with the drive makes
it fail less often.  A race does not need any other form of Psi to make
this work, and there is little connection between the Psi talent that makes
this work and the talent that makes other talents work.)

For cost reasons, people are not eager to put the very expensive machines
in.  They are willing to do so to reduce crew counts on merchant ships, but
not to eliminate it completely.  FWIW, once one hits TL 21 or so,
teleportation starts to replace jump drive over interstellar distances, but
this requires the development of Psionic AI machines.)

Were the drive system completely understood, which happens in Traveller at
TL 19 or so, the Traveller ships would be too.  Of course, by that time,
the "human" who is running the system is artificial, and may in fact be
entirely in jump space.

In summary, this explains a couple of interesting details about Traveller:

1.  Why are all the ancient races listed Psionic?

2.  Why are space pilots as superstitious as old uneducated sailors?

3.  Why do star crews get paid so much?

Factories are automated to the level that profit is maximized.
Different factories are automated to different levels depending
on a number of factors including the resources of the company
building the plant at the time, the regulatory environment, the
availability of competing methods of production (ie labor costs
at the time), etc...  The capabilities of the technology are
only one small part of the whole equation.  Most of our "in
service" technology is well below what is the most advanced
possible for a number of reasons, reliability and custom being
two big ones.

If there are enough people out there who want to go to space
that it\'s cheap to find pilots and the like, then it would make
sense to use them over automation if the cost is high.

Perhaps the Imperium has a constant labor surplus for some reason
and so jobs that people want are still not automated.  This labor
surplus could be explained by automation of many mundane tasks,
like sweeping floors, doing laundry, construction, etc...

    'body' => 'Hmmm...interesting points.

Let me start by saying that I have automated some functions in starships in the
past, and have since backed away from that.  I did a lot of thinking about this
during the discussions about starports last year.  I strongly feel that
starships coming into Class A or B starports, be it the highport or the lowport,
are going to turn control over to the starport computers for the approach and
landing.  A pilot will be there for override, but the starport computers will
have final say on the docking/landing.

Furthermore, I have always felt that certain piloting tasks were automated. 
Landing at the starport beacon (Class c, d and e) is easily accomplished. 
Establishing a standard orbit.  Breaking orbit and proceding to the jump point. 
Liftoff from a starport, etc...  These are all pre-programmed into the Nav
computer and require only authorization to execute.  And programs like
Manuever/Evade, Evade, etc... imply a great deal of computer assistance to the
pilot.

However, while I feel that the tasks of a pilot can be duplicated to a certain
extent, there are some very serious problems that also arise.  The existance of
\'slave circuits\' (what the starport uses to control the ship during final
approach) also imply the existance of direct control over the ship.  Something
that can be utilized by (ahem) darker elements of society (notice I\'m not using
the \'P\' word!!  :)  IMTU, the slave circuit has a multitude of control codes
that must be matched in order for external control.  The starport, on achieving
a secure comm link, will instruct the pilot to set the slave code to a specific
setting, then take control.  Part of the shutdown checklist is to both reset the
code and deactivate the circuit.  There is no \'override\' available, even to the
Imperial military.  (And yes, if you don\'t have the circuit, or you don\'t give
control over, you are restricted to a parking orbit and must use commercial
shuttles to get to the starport.)

So, while a pilot can tell someone attempting to control the ship improperly to
\'get stuffed\', use of a fully automated system can be overcome.  I\'m sure you
can specify all sorts of security on the pilot-bot, but if even one route is
allowed to accomodate emergency reprogramming of the pilot-bot because it has
become deranged, then the door is open for multi-million credit ships to be
hijacked remotely, or reprogrammed to do \'bad\' things (ref. VIRUS!!!).

Ultimately, matters having to do with the life and death of sophonts, must be
decided by sophonts.  To that end, even tho\' ship\'s weaponry is automated to a
great extent (as demonstrated by the Gunner-x series of programs), the turrets
are designed with the idea that a sophont will sit there and pull the trigger.

That philosophy of thought, IMHO, is reflected throughout the Imperium. 
Automation is available as a backup, but sophonts make the decisions.

With regard to working passage - I don\'t think that anyone expects that top of
the line, megacorporation ships.  This applies more to the fringe, free traders.

Wow, playing Traveller with INWO: Coolness.
I see it before me:
Nope, my Strephon isnt dead, because i clone him, but now i play at Shuttle Crash on
your Dulinor, followed up by a narrow escape on my Varian, before your Lucan can
Assassinate him.
This is a game i would just love! Greed shining in my eyes!

Nanotechnology

Physicist Richard Feynman first suggested the notion of atom-by-atom
manipulation of matter in the late 1960s, but it was not until the 1981 book
The Engines of Creation that author K. Eric Drexler gave the notion a name and
outlined the possibilities. This is not the place to go into a complete essay
on the subject, but it is the place to explain why Traveller does not directly
incorporate most of the possibilities represented by so-called MEMS (Micro
Electrical-Mechanical Systems). 

Drexler\'s basic concept was that individual molecules (or even individual
atoms) could be manipulated by microscopic machines, in any way that the laws
of physics allowed. Cars, buildings, spaceships, whatever, could be grown out
of whatever material was desired. MEMS could disassemble an object into its
component atoms, and reassemble them as something completely different. Given
enough of atoms of the right sort, it would be theoretically possible to
fabricate anything on the spot, the only restrictions being the energy needed
for the job and enough atoms of the proper elements being present. A cloud of
MEMS (the so-called "smart fog" of SF stories) could grow a seven-course meal
right in front of the diners, including the table, chairs, plates, tablecloth,
utensils and water in the fingerbowls. The leftovers (including the table, the
plates, and so on) could be converted into a recliner couch for the diners to
nap on after the meal is eaten. Further, the MEMS could conceivably build
other MEMS, so the technology of replication would be self-replicating.
Infections could be dealt with by disassembling the infectious bacteria,
injuries healed by rebuilding the tissues at a molecular level, surgery
accomplished by a horde of microscopic repair robots that grow new heart
valves or replacement limbs. 

There is a dark side: MEMS could be used as weapons. An enemy could be
converted to a pool of constituent atoms by a cloud of microscopic attack
machines. Since these attack MEMS could be self-replicating, it would only be
necessary to send one in the attack force. The only defense would be other
MEMS. The whole situation would be beyond the individual\'s direct control, and
would somewhat resemble CBW (chemical/biological warfare) - you just have to
hope that your defensive MEMS remain superior to the attackers offensive MEMS,
and get regular innoculations.

A good role-playing game could be designed incorporating nanotech, but that
game would not be the Traveller we all know and love. If goods can be made to
order on the spot, there will be no need for trade (indeed, much of what we
know about supply and demand economics would cease to be relevant), which is
one of the primary sources of adventure situations in the Traveller universe.
There would be no mercenary adventures: why use armies to invade when you need
only introduce a few self-replicating attack MEMS to the enemy world. After
every living thing is dismantled to its component atoms, you send in your
colonists and their MEMS grow their infrastructure. 

In Traveller, nanotechnology is assumed to be present on a low level. It forms
the basis of certain medical devices (more and more as TL rises), and is
probably the means by which much high tech manufacturing takes place. If we
assume that MEMS are very, very expensive, and are not self-replicating (for
whatever reason), we have the basis for excluding much of Drexler\'s
nanotechnology from Traveller. Imperial research stations (q.v.) are probably
experimenting with high level nanotech, and Gamemasters who wish to put their
victi. . .er. . . players through a "nanites gone wild" scenario can look to
these places for justification. Individual Gamemasters, however, are free to
make nanotechnology as widespread as they like in their particular universe
(GURPS Robots and Ultra-Tech contain the relevant rules).

Always was president. Also heavily involved with design of almost everything

Development, yes. What DGP did was take the various advanced character
generation systems from Mercenary, Merchant Prince, Scouts, and so on, and fit
them together. They added a task system, which was developed from the one used
in Twilight: 2000 (the original edition). This was a massive undertaking.

\'Fraid not. I was involved in the development of the Rebellion, but the
original idea was from Tim Brown and heavily modified by Mac Miller. At the
time, my design energy was completely absorbed in Twilight: 2000, (which was
actually outselling Traveller at that point and needed a line manager) since I
was involved with the design of Twilight from the ground up.

My contribution the the MT background was coming up with the idea that one of
the contenders should be the "real" Strephon. My original notion was patterned
on an 18th century Russian named Pugachev. Those who recognize the name will
understand what the original intention was (kind of fortunate I made the
suggestion, eh what?). Marc and Tim created Dulinor, Lucan, Margaret, and the
other factions.

	Of course a free trader will have its "AI" for that reason a TL:12
	starship computer of a 200dt ship has still the size of a refrigiator
	combination pack, even as its canon (HighGuard) to control such
	a ship with a TL:6 analog computer of even smaler size. Humans
	want those "natural speach" control and dynamical linking of
	operations. And this "AI" is running 99.999% of the ship 99% of
	the time. The full manual controled ship wont show crew
	accomodations of traveller, but those of a XXI (german U-Boat
	(50 people in a scout sized vessel). So traveller (even TNE)
	already has good automatisations compared to WWII. T4 offers to
	introduce higher levels of automatisation for moderate price, as
	does TNE for the risk getting caught by RQS.

	The cheapest thing for Joe Average free trader would be to buy
	one of those Robots. He can use them for 2nd engineer, for
	maintenance and for cargo handling. This would relase a lot of
	burden from the Chief, but a lot of Chiefs perfer a Philipino
	over a Robot, because is possible to chat to him in the spare
	time. Spare time wont be much. Bridge officiers would have a lot
	of paperwork as they have now, and work on board is currently
	streached, that some lines pay 80 overtime per week. That are only
	6.8 hour spare time per day for officers.

	But a free trader would sometimes, as would some yacht owners.
	I know from friends, that at least german licences qualify to
	hire for a single working passage on most harbours of the world.
	Its not possible to hire on big line, but its likely to hire on
	small coast ships and yachts currently.

adventures, and my players are almost never interested in anything but the
polotical side of the game, wih the occasional active duty marine thrown in
just for spice.

	I dare say that I have never played a canon game.

	Most people have their own character and they take them through an
adventure created by the GM.  They were roled up buy the player and
approved by the GM.  The GM has put his own mind to work creating the game,
and has taken varriable amounts of info from the canon.

	I dare say that this is not a canon game.

	I you want to claim to be playing a pure canon game of Traveller then play
nothing that is not a published adventure and use only the characters that
in the adventure.  But then, do you have an RPG or an interactive novel?

	Traveller is a GREAT game, with a rich history and wealth of background
information.  But each game run by each GM will be a vastly different game.
 Thus the only TRUE canon would be what ever is played under Marc Miller,

	T4 did not fail at this.  In fact, unless you bought the Milieu 0 book you
only have the rules.  The setting was much more intregal to the CT amd MT
books that to T4.  I have never played TNE either.

	I do not mind the GURPS system, but I do have a problem with it.  I feel
that the game tries to be so generic that it becomes kind of bland and
dull.  I still play GURPS a little because of its versitility, but I tend
to use another games system entirely for everything else.

No.

That would require escalation to sentences or stanzas, which
in turn would lead to paragraphs, and soon we\'d
have people slinging around near-C novellas.

I can play or run such games, but they aren\'t always my preference.
I prefer low level, survive or die, or political intrigue games.

By getting them involved in the setting.

I don\'t. Why bother ? The universe isn\'t balanced.

>What made your sessions work

player involvement
real emotions.  

>and more importantly, where did you fail?

The following are things I tend to do
which can have negative effects on some players
(Mind you, other players like this sort of thing)

Not enough "bubblegum action", too gritty and "realistic" for some
people (i.e: I describe the effects of having your arm shot of
 by a fusion weapon, squeamish people need not apply)
 
When (if) the Imperium arrives they always have it all over
the players. (Better SatInt. better C3, better teamwork,
beter gear ). Do _not_ mess with Imperial Commandos.
And if you even _suspect_ IBIS are involved, get the hell
out of there.

Some players don\'t like being reminded they\'re _not_
the best, the best are already employed by the sort of
people who can afford them, they don\'t hang around in bars
looking for patrons.

(Unless, of course the characters are playing characters
 who _are the best, in which case they usually end up being
 employed by the sort of peple who can afford them....)

Ouch.  I am wounded.  Note, I haven\'t been slinging insults here.  I\'d just
rather stop before things get ugly, which they already have.  All I\'ve got
to see to this is, fine, my apologies, don\'t read my posts.

Then, I really have no clue at all about what you are saying.  I\'ll be
upfront and honest about it.

Hold on a second here!  You say that automation would eliminate the concept
of work passage on Megacorp cargo ships.  I said, even without automation,
Megacorps would cover their butts so as not to be sabotaged by any group. 
This includes doing comprehensive backup checks.  You said that it would be
too difficult for Megacorps to perform the backup checks.

This was my response to that.  Please correct me if I\'m wrong on what you
stated, if I am wrong, I must have lost you a long time ago.

> [More stuff that has nothing to do with anything I\'ve said
> deleleted....]

I\'m really sorry I don\'t follow.  What exactly have you been saying? 
Apparently I must have lost you completely.

Now, I will apologize for my shortness in my previous post.  It may have
been a little uncalled for.  Now, however, I\'d like you to please state
your side of the argument clearly so that I can understand where you\'re
coming from.  It seems like every idea I come up with, you just say, "It
won\'t work.  It will take work away from the players."  Give me some
feedback here so I can try to wrap my brain around your side of the
argument.

>What has affected the way I developed my ideas of the Traveller universe?

Since I unintentionally started this, I\'ll add my two cents :^)

>Authors:

Note that the reading list will be a little light, as I\'m not much of a
reader of novels.


Gibson (just about anything, I specifically like the little details)
Sterling (as above but x10)
Asimov (The Foundation series, obviously)
Vonnegut (influences my personality, which indirectly influences my play
style :^)
Clarke (specifically Rama, as it just filled me with such a wonderful sense
of awe)
Akira (the comic book series)
EC Comics of all sorts (including Weird Science)
The old Buck Rogers strips (don\'t ask)
The Sandman (comic series, for the "grand scheme of things" aspect)

>Movies and TV:

The Alien series (Alien being my favorite of the three)
Blade Runner
WarGames
The Usual Suspects (major influence on my current campaign)
M*A*S*H (both the TV show and the movie)
Red Dwarf
Total Recall (the little touches are fantastic)
Robocop (for the commercials)
2001:  A Space Odyssey
Terminator

Video Games:

Starflight (simply the best video game I\'ve ever played)
Starflight II

If I ever ran a Trav game outside the Imperial timeline, it would be based
on the Starflight series, with some touches from the StarControl series.

StarControl (whole series)
Most space based video games pre-1984

>What I like is a "Space Opera" playing session.  Players becoming actors of
>bigger than life characters.  What the hey!  Everyone likes an opportunity
>to "Save the Universe."

I like playing somewhat fast and loose, as I\'m constantly amazed by what
the PCs come up with.  The possibility of "real" death and "real" bloodshed
constantly hangs over the heads of the players, and they usually rise to
the occasion.  They are more of a "thinking" group than a fighting group.

>So now I need to ask you TMLer friends of mine
>these questions...
 
>How do you remind yourself it\'s only a game?

I don\'t know.  My PCs don\'t usually need to be reminded, and I don\'t.  We
just have fun playing.

>How do you make it fun for your players?... not yourselves because your
>enjoyment comes from developing, authoring and running your universe.

I make it fun for my players by trying to involve them in the adventures as
much as possible, and by trying to come up with new and innovative
adventure hooks.  Currently they are involved in a race/scavenger hunt
across the subsector in competition with a group of ex-scouts.  This has
proven to be the most fun adventure I\'ve run in a long time. 

>How do you maintain balance amongst players and the game system?

I limit the availability of heavy weapons, and I make sure that the PCs are
held accountable for their actions.

>What made your sessions work

I\'m still not completely sure.  If I was, I would have an easier job of
coming up with adventures!  :^)  What has started to make my campaign work
is that the PCs are finally getting involved outside of the storylines of
adventures and are starting to "live" in the campaign world to some extent.

>and more importantly, where did you fail?

One of the times I failed is when I was caught completely unprepared for
the PCs\' next move.  One night they seemed out to get me and decided to
jump to a completely random mainworld in search of adventure.  They did
something completely random, and then, rather mean spiritedly, if I say so
myself, kept pressing me on extremely minor details once they got there...

The downside of mob mentality.

My major fault in roleplaying is I tend to lose steam after the 1st month
and a half of playing.  I\'ve already passed the hump and survived, so it
looks to be pretty smoothe sailing from here.

Let\'s see...  My only other fault is that I find it difficult to introduce
the culture of the Imperium to PCs without either longwinded descriptions
(which they will tend to forget in a few weeks anyway) or copious amounts
of handouts.  My current race/scavenger hunt is an attempt to do this in a
pleasant manner, and they are responding very well to it.  I am quite proud
:^)

It\'s the little things that are so tough to get across.

A question, were the Freak Brothers a big influence on Traveller in the

Especially not at that price. (Incidentally, I looked it up: 1
carat [jewelry] = 200mg.)

Incidentally, the date of the article was 3/26, not 3/2.

And I thought of Mood Rings: The Next Generation, too, when I
read the article.

Holographic Neck Chains are old hat, even today.  The only
difference that I can envision for the FarFuture is that perhaps
they\'ll be holoprojective, instead of the current embedded deals.

Fusion+ Disco Balls?  Too obvious - what do you think is powering
the antigrav generator in Imperial Disco Balls (which are viewed
as "Classical-Retro" lighting units)?

Chameleon Leisure Suits?  It could be done, but the cost of the
chameleon polyester fabric makes it uneconomical.

That all depends on how you want to cast them - I mean, they
don\'t _have_ to be programmed to look like a cluster of disco

Daughter.  Crown Princess Iphigenia.  Go check out the original
assassination story.  Empress Iolanthe and Crown Princess
Iphigenia were in the Presence Chamber when Dulinor attacked;
they both died with "Strephon" (who turned out to be a ceremonial
clone). Varian (head-of-house in a cadet line, and next heir
behind Iphigenia) was killed under questionable circumstances,
possibly by his younger brother, Lucan.

	I\'ve done the same error ;-( Making him german ;-)

	And for the Netherlands the distinction is for importance, I allways

	prefer Platt (common between Netherlands and Friesland) or english,

===

(from Imperial Commerce Business Daily, 028/317)

The Imperial Insterstellar Scout Service, in conjunction with the Ministry
of Trade and Development, is pleased to announce their sponsorship of a
new Imperial Ship Builders Association THUDDD design competition.  The
winning entrant will receive a limited production run contract to produce
10 vessels of the class, with an option to extend into full production
(100+ vessels) pending completion of field trials. 

The vessel to be produced is a small science vessel, in concept a "mobile
laboratory" for use in Imperium-sponsored research, exploration, and
resource management roles.  The minimum performance requirements are:

* Jump 2
* Operational independence for long-duration, long-range missions
  (intrinsic refueling and maintenance)
* Ability to interface with world surfaces (directly or via carried
  craft)
* Provision of 40 dtons (560 m3) of dedicated laboratory space
* Provision of quarters and other support for 20 researchers (in
  addition to other crewmembers)
* High-resolution, high-sensitivity sensors

Bidders are invited to include, justify, and satisfy additional
requirements, should they judge them necessary to fulfill the design
function.

Price is a secondary but important criterion in determining the winner of
this competition.  Efficient fulfillment of the operational requirements
is the primary goal. 

Typical roles for this vessel might include (but are by no means limited
to): 

* Resource evaluation survey of stellar systems
* Sophontological analysis of less technologically developed cultures
* Platform for deep space physics investigations

The vessel is not expected to have more than token defense capabilities
against TL 7+ opponents.  Any components intended for world surface
landings (the vessel itself, or its carried craft) should be capable of
withstanding TL 4- direct assault indefinitely.

Contact the ISBA THUDDD Coordinating Office for more information.  Long
Live the Emperor!

Interesting!  I think "loudmouth" for "grossmaeul" is too literal and not
idiomatic -- better, "grossmaeulig" = "bragging".  I agree -- to solve this
"canon problem", just interpret the text so that official is a pompous,
swaggering idiot.

Babelfish isn\'t the greatest language resource... for some simple-minded
but side-splitting fun, get some badly written anatomically ill-informed
porn off the Web and run it through Babelfish a couple times.

Don\'t do this at work.  For the keyboards\' sake!

Actually if you want to ignore c you can, it is just that then you will
be seeing how long it takes for the trip

 _from_the_point_of_view_of_those_on_the_ship_

and not for those not on the ship.  If you figure how long it will take
to travel a certain distance at a constant acceleration using good old
Newtonian mechanics and ignoring relativity you will have a pretty good
approximation of how long it will take in ships time.

If the scenario in question is the classic "Oh no, we just misjumped,
lets get in the low bearths and head for the nearest planet - but wait
do we have enough energy to run our low bearths for that long ?"
scenario then it is ships time that is important anyway.

Warning - answer is somewhat long & pedantic.

I would suggest that the Imperial ID card has an Imperial ID number on
it.  This number appears (in slightly raised numbers) across the left
two thirds of the top of your card, above your name and other data, and
to the left of your photo.  I think that the Imperial ID number on it
will come in this format:

        XX NLN NLN NLN NLN

Where XX is a standard two letter abrieviation for the Sector you were
born in, such as SM for the Spinward Marches.  Every single sector the
Imperium has ever heard of, not just those actually in the Imperium, has
a standard abreviation (those poor souls who do not know where they were
born will be given a card w XX on it if the Imperium can\'t figure it out
either.)

NLN stands for number, letter, number such as 5A3.  Each 3 letter
combination will have 2600 combinations in it (more if your version of
Traveller canon assumes that the Imperium uses the Vilani script not the
Roman one for Galanglic, this theory tends to be supported by art
showing ship names, etc - I am using 2600 for simplicity).

So 4 sets of NLN combinations will produce 2600 ^ 4 or
45,697,600,000,000 possible ID combinations for _each_ sectors
inhabitants. (If you used hexadecimal numbers rather than decimal
numbers you would have about 25 times this many but then your
hexadecimal numbers A through F would get mixed up with your numbers so
I do not suggest it) This means that not just every one of the Third
Imperiums 15 trillion inhabitants, but every inhabitant it has ever had,
and everyone from anywhere else, can be given distinct ID numbers. 

This one ID number combines all the functions that we now assign to the
Drivers liscence number, and the Social Security Number, and the
Military ID number, and the corporate ID number, and the pilots liscence
number, and the vidoe rental club number, and all the rest.  If you join
the Imperial Navy, or TAS (for example) they will issue you a Naval ID
card in addition to your Imperial ID but it will have the same number
across the top and its smart card function will have most or all of the
same data on it with the addition of your service/membership record,
etc.

The overall number is only 14 digits long.  It has extra spaces in it to
ensure that no long number or letter strings are in it.  This reduces
the chance of an error during data entry by a dyslexic clerk who
reverses the ID numbers.  ID numbers are _not_ reused, since you will be
issued a unique number you can not be mistaken for someone else from the
past. 

This system has been in place since Milieu 0.  When the Solomani
Confederation left the Third Imperium they kept their Imperial format
ID\'s.  One of the lesser subparagraphs within the armistice treaty at
the end of the Solomani Rim War dealt with the creation of a joint
Imperial/Confederation committee to ensure that ID numbers were not
duplicated.  This was one of the very few joint Imperial/Confederation
bureacratic projects <insert plot hook here>.  The Imperium had an
unofficial, but highly followed, practice of appointing as many Newts to
this committee as they could, supposedly because Newts are natural
bureaucrats but actually because they knew dealing with aliens would
annoy the racist SOlomani.

Imperial ID is issued to everyone who comes through the Imperium who
wants one.  Any aliens not travelling on a diplomatic passport from
their own governmnet have to get one to enter the Imperium.  Anyone
travelling anywhere sufficiently near the Imperium that a misjump might
bring them within its borders would be well advised to get one.  If you
are from a planet with a type X starport you can\'t get an ID card at
home; if you leave planet you can get one, just like anyone else, but
only after you answer some hard questions about how and why you left
home.

On the ID your status is noted right under the number: Citizen, Resident
Alien, Visitor, Android, Nonsentient Animal (ID\'s in this category have
a Cr 250 cost this in case you need an ID number for your pet or
companion animal to get it through customs, numbers are not normally
issued to livestock), Etc.  Replacement ID\'s cost at least Cr 500.  If
you are part of an alien army attempting to invade an Imperial world you
had better bring your Imperial ID with you if you want to be treated
like a soldier, rather than a criminal, when captured.  Of course if you
_do_ bring your Imperial ID with you it will be easier for the planetary
forces to find you with their scanners.  Life is like that sometimes.

I suggest that on planets with a low law level having the ID will
usually not be required but if it is not having it will result in all
governmnent tasks being 1 difficulty level higher.  I suggest that _all_
tasks involving interacting with the government, or _any_ other
bureaucratic organization, be made 2 difficulty level higher on any
planet with a medium law level. (Have you ever tried toborrow a library
book without a library card for example.) On planets with a high law
level tasks involving government interaction should be either forbidden
entirely, or made 3 difficulty levels higher, in addition you may need
to roll a Persuasion or Admin task to avoid a fine or arrest for not
having proper ID.  On extreme law level worlds you may be gunned down by
beat cops who cannor read the signature of your ID with the scanner on
their uniform or armor and who therefore know that you must be a
terrorist because after all only a terrorist or traitor would want to
make the jobs of the police any harder....  

If the planets government is type 9, Impersonal Bureaucracy, I suggest
using the high law level +3 Diff Mods to all bureaucratic or government
tasks rule, no matter what the law level is.

There are two Ultra-Tech books:  UT2, pp. 7-9 is the primary reference on

applies directly to Traveller.

You should probably also include GURPS Biotech among your references.

Well, for Windows 95 its rather easy...I can put the theme file together

to decide on the color scheme. 

Like I said earlier, I made an attempt to make the graphics, and it was
unimpressive. I DID manage to make a Imperial Sunburst icon and a
Shattered Imperial Sunburst icon, which someone suggested as a
Recycle/Trash bin icon...but I tried to make a Scout/Courier icon and
failed pretty badly.

While I haven\'t played GURPS:Traveller in any form, I have played/Ref\'ed
Trav since it\'s release, and I can say the same for GURPS (Run a Fantasy,
Swashbuckler, Wild West, with elements stolen form Space:1889, and a Space ,
and Wildcards campaigns). Overall I like the GURPS rules, however, you have
to be ready to pick and choose. The rule set is VERY detailed if you try and
include everything it really tends ot bog the game down. Of course this can
be said about any RPG to some extent.

With that in mind the diversity of GURPS world books presents a LOT of
material to pull from in creating worlds and backgrounds. I have no doubt
that the Traveller book(s?) will do the same.

	I don\'t even have the abality to produce the simple designes you have

One slight differwnce to this in Commonmwealth
armed forces is when referring to the top level
NCO\'s such as Warrant Officers and Chief Petty Officers.

While they may accept "Chief" and other rank based terms
from commisioned officers, other ranks are expected to
call them "Sir". The difference between WO/CPOs and
commisioned officers is that you don\'t salute
a non-commisoned officer.

You\'re not alone, I aree with pretty much everything you\'ve said,
and then some.

I completely ignore the size and program storage
restrictions stated for computers for instance, as following
those rules gives you computers that aren\'t much better than 
an S390.

I always thought the X-Boat network _was_ automated,
until I saw the argumets on here about it with the 
people only in the X-Boat tenders unless you needed to get
an individual across the sector in a real hurry for
some reason.

( Y\'know, like how they got Tom Cruise onto the sub
  in "Hunt for Red October". I had an important and
  extremely competemt Imperial agent who absolutely
  _had_ to arrive in person on another planet in a
  very short time use his clout to get the ISS
  to place him on the Xboat network, the ISS complained
  mightily to the Navy afterwards, as him insisting
  on their sending him aliong had stuffed up their
  schedules considerably 
)

Bzzzt, wrong!

It started on the Acorn BBC Model B, written by Acornsoft.
It was ported to the Commodore 64  and the Sinclair
Spectrum almost a year after the BBC release.

So they get them. Yet another system to maintain in
a 500 year-old free trader in break-even situation.

That\'s why we have crews, it\'s often cheaper to hire
an engineer for the trip than to get the complete overhaul
required to be safe without an engineer. 

And what if the standard automatics you have can only function
effictively at class A or B starports. The ILS system just does
not work when the starport is only a bare patch of rock.

Auto-Pilot :
"I\'m sorry sir, but there is no starport at that location.
 I have been unable to establish a landing protocol session
 with any ground-based air traffic control systems.
 Landing aborted "

Capt Jamieson. :
"Damned automatics, \'puter, give me the helm"

Auto-Pilot :
" Certainly, sir. though according to Imperial
  Regulation SL-56 subsection 7, I am required
  to advise against manual landings, especially
  at starports that do not support STC-aided
  approaches"

Capt Jamieson. :
" Shut up and give me the stick"

Why would they ?
Starships have no need to get info or courses from other star
ships, that\'s what Deep Space Control is for.

And automated ships wouldn\'t be operating out on the fringes,
only on the regular shuttle routes.

For that matter, there\'s no reason why the automated ship
wouldn\'t be perfectly capable of responding in the same way
as human crew, though it might not be interested in small talk.

>I also makes a difference
>when the want to arrange a working passage.

If it is a passenger ship it is still going to have human crew.
If it is not a ship on a regular route, it\'s likley to have a
human crew.

Anyway megacorps wouldn\'t accept people for working passage,
too big a security risk.

And equally as many counter examples.

I don\'t mind if you don\'t have automated ships,
you just have to realize it\'s not a canon issue,
and it\'s not a "break background" issue, its
merely your personal preference

But we\'re not "introducing" technology, the technology has always
been there. Heck, we\'ve got it now !.

It\'s an even bigger problem trying to explain to players
why something that is available _now_, on Earth, at T7 or
T8 isn\'t available in the Imperium at TL13

Such a huge _reduction_ in capability between modern and
far future technology "breaks background" a hell of a lot
more than allowing automated ships.

None of this needs to be changed by automated ships.

>the need to for just the kind of skills a PC is likely to

Not at all.

For instance, we have automated aircraft now.
But still most aircraft have pilots 

Introducing automated ships does _not_ mean that all ships
will be automated. It\'s easy to assume that no passenger
craft will be automated, because people want people looking
after them.
The only attempt to run an automated passenger
liner failed because too few people bought tickets

We have automated ground vehicles also, but few
of or groundcars are. Which is largely
through personal choice.

The skills are the same, and the people they talk to are the
same. They just do less repetitive work that can be easily
automated.

Heck, making cargo carriers automated adds lots of great
plot oppurtunities, like stowaways on automated ships.

There is pilfering on an automated ship. Players have to
find out how it\'s being done.

One has malfunctioned and shutdown according to the failsafes
but is now heading into a dense traffic area, so needs to be
reactivated and salvaged.

By keeping an even keel.  When we\'re playing, it\'s for fun.  So if we get a
bit off-topic, or silly, I\'m not going to scream and rant.  I will say that
before I got cancer I was much worse about this, insisting that "ve must
play zee game, and ze game vill be played!."  But I have a much different
attitude towards life in general now.

And by making sure that they are interested in the type of campaign I have
planned.  I have friends who love to play, but hate the type of games I run
(merchant/intrigue), so rather than ruin the game for everyone, I just let
them know that the game isn\'t really their speed.  I do use those guys for
NPC\'s on occasion.

A loaded .45 behind the Referee screen.  :)

>>and more importantly, where did you fail?

I sometimes try to railroad my players.  I should be more subtle about
getting them on track, but that\'s something I need to work on.

I\'m an Army aviator.  I can\'t speak for the Navy about shipboard roles, but
the flight surgeon in every unit I\'ve ever been in was a *very* important
character, even if a pain in the, uhmm,  neck:

"Flu shots, everybody!  Yes, you\'ll all be grounded for 48 hours.  What?
Oh, I suppose we could do them on a Friday, if you all promise to show up."

"No, you are not flying on that knee, and that\'s final.  Next time, let the

Ah, munchies! Why, I remember the day we discovered munchies! Uhgh, ( an
excellent player and part time GM) accidently threw his 6 sided rocks too
hard and knocked over a curious dino. Naturally it fell into the fire we
were useing to try and read the cave drawing charts we\'d made in an attempt
to figure the actual use for Jump "fuel". Well, needless to say it fried to
a crisp and munchies were born!

This is a very good idea indeed. I had originally envisioned a single
letter designating a sector, but two letters make this much more
descriptive without over-lengthening the string. After revision, IMTU the
ID string starts something like:

     LLSxxxx-

Where LL stands for the two-letters designating a sector, and S in the
letter of the subsector (A - P). The next for digits come directly from the
hex number of the world as listed in the sector index. While including
subsector with sector hex may be somewhat redundant, it does allow a person
to recognize at a glance what part of space the bearer originates from.

Nice mathematical elegance, but my wife, who has been a data-entry clerk
has railed me at length about how painful this sort letter-number
combination is to  people who have to deal with long lists of these things
all day. Consider: a good operator enters with one hand while using the
other to flip papers. By combining letters with numbers like this the
operator has to use both hands on her keyboard rocking back and forth from
the number keys to the letters ad nauseam. This inefficiency would drive
the Newts nuts. Granted, only those operators who have to enter long
volumes of these numbers would even care, but hey. Suppose instead that one
used a three digit, simple hexadecimal combination (A-F as opposed to
expanded A-Z). The keypad could be numeric expanded by six additional keys,
the operator could employ both hands efficiently, and keep the Newt task
masters happy. Also total combinations would be 4096^4 or
281,474,967,000,000! A number sufficiently large enough to satisfy even the
most pessimistic bureaucrat for the next thousand years.

OTOH, a ten digit hexadecimal number would allow for 16^10 or
1,099,511,628,000. Over one trillion combinations per sector. Good enough?

My wife is a surgeon, and her dad is as well. He was surgeon on the
Intrepid and said that most of his business was antibiotics after
Liberty ports :-)

A lot of medical crap on TV SF is pretty dopey. In recent B5, for
example: Ivonova\'s medical condition made no sense. She would either
be OK, or dead, but not a trauma that would somehow give her d"days
or weeks to live." What could it be but infection? Even missing
organs would be a transplant problem, but not the languish in bed
and take a while to die to move the plot along. This is typical of
SF medical problems (I won\'t even go into the rank idiocy of Star
Trek medicine).

Damara comments on this while watching TV the same way I get bent 
out of shape about the physics problems :-) So I get to hear about
all the medical crap on any SF I watch in some detail.

As fpor the "killing is wrong" aspect, I think that the SF doctors
didn\'t do a residency in an urban hospital :-) If they did their
baseline might be more like "you woke me up again, and it was just
to treat this alien scumbag that was trying to kill us a couple
hours ago? I\'ll look at him if he\'s alive in the morning."

Yes, I\'ve checked it out and they\'ve acquired a new subscriber (based

I try to find out what sort of game they want, and then try to provide it.
The problem comes when they want something that won\'t fit into my wonderful
universe.

>What made your sessions work and more importantly, where did you fail?

They usually worked when they were interaction stroies or mysteries. My
games usually fail because my players are all really fantasy gamers at
heart, and if the adventure relies on an understanding of the overall
background or the technology and its capabilities and limitations the game
generally fizzles due to the players lack of knowledge in these areas. I
think that is a combination of the players not reading the meterial, and me
not making it itneresting enough. My Trav games also tend to fail if
there\'s too much (para)military action because I\'m much better at tactics
than my players and I tend to forget this when running the opposition -
something I need to work on.

This is only partialy true in the Army - of the two grades of Warrant
Officers only the top grade is addressed as "Sir", the second grade is
addressed as "Sergeant Major" even though technically only a Company
Sergeant Major really should be so addressed. This is because the WO1 (I
think) designation replaced the old British Army rank of Sergeant Major and
the NCOs refuse to forget.

Inasmuch as they ever could be...

The RS writeup pointed out an angle I\'d never considered:  while we TCS
players love the Islands as a ready-made arena for conflict, the Regency
looks at them a lot like the Balkans - a backwater full of petty little
one and two-world governments who\'ve been at each other\'s throats for
as long as they\'ve had Jump.  The Regency can occupy the cluster, but 
the tensions are still there, waiting to explode again.  Sobering image.

It\'s fun to play with fleets and admirals, not so much fun to try to
survive another day in the ruins of Sarajevo.

Skill-5 in Traveller becomes Skill-5 in HERO, so there is no need to 
change the "meaning" of skills.

The main problem with HERO, having used it extensively, is the use of 
STR.  If you use HERO rules, people can lift and throw enormous 
weights.  Similarlr, if you use the weapons and damag rules as they 
stand, characters take a lot of killing and PGMPs are hard to fit into 
the HERO system.  You can do all these things, but most people end up 
with a long list of house rules to cover man-to-man combat.

HERO is brilliant (IMO) if you want a "Luke Skywalker" flavour for your 
characters, but not so good if you want to have more lethal (some would 
say, more realistic) combat.

It is good to have the character progression of HERO, but buying 
characteristics with experience and weapons with money leads to some 
outlandish characters.  Because characteristics are relatively cheap in 
HERO, and players will try to by them via OAF (telescopic sights), OIF 
(power armour), IIF (nanobots in the bloodstream give regeneration) and 
so on ... and once you establish a technology reason for their "magic" 
abilities, players want to buy them with money instead of experience 
points, which leads to 1980\'s D&D-style escalation.  You can limit this 
somewhat with the campaign ideas in the HERO martial arts supplements, 
but it needs the right sort of players and referee to make it work long 
term.

HERO tends to encourage "power play", and power play is addictive.  
Most "addicts" hate it when you try and stop them getting an 
in-character advantage by using mere money to buy HERO abilities.

Your summary is sort of accurate.  It also has little resemblence
that I can see to the idea that megacorps are stupic (unless you
want to invoke the idea that only your vision of them can be
"smart") or that not being able to do off planet background
checks means that they hire anyone with any skill level, or
that this would mean that megacorps can\'t exist.  None of
this follows from what I said...

    'body' => 'Sekhoma is a card game known primarily in the Arcturan and Sylean
regions of known space.  It fits into the same social niche as
the Terran card game of Poker, and has many elements in common,
but the degree to which the two games are related is uncertain.
Sekhoma is played by two to six players, using a 72-card deck
consisting of six suits each with the numbers one to six repeated
twice in each suit. One player is initially designated dealer;
deal rotates through the players each hand. The objective in each
hand is to achieve the highest-ranked hand.

The dealer deals six cards face-down to each player.  Before
picking up their cards, each player antes a mutually agreed
amount (usually one or two units, where a unit is the smallest
amount of money that may be wagered on the game.  Social games
usually use a unit size of centicredits; casinos use units
ranging from one credit upward), placing it in the center of the
table.  Players are given an opportunity to examine the cards
dealt to them (which are kept concealed from the other players),
and one round of betting takes place.  The first player (the one
to the dealer\'s immediate left) announces "bet" or "no bet", and
if "bet" is announced, includes the amount bet, and places that
amount in the center of the table with the antes. Betting then
continues to the left, with each player having the following
options:

"Call" - The player announces "call" and places an amount equal
to all prior bets and raises in the center of the table, and
remains in the game.

"Raise" - The player announces "raise" and an amount of an
additional bet, and places an amount equal to all prior bets and
raises, plus his additional bet.  Players preceding him in the
round must immediately add the raise amount to the center of the
table, or "fold", forfeiting all monies bet during the hand.

"Fold" - The player drops out of the game for the remainder of
the deal, forfeiting any monies wagered in the hand.

After each player has had one opportunity to bet, raise, call, or
fold, the player to the dealer\'s left may exchange up to four
cards.  The discarded cards are placed face-down on the table,
and the dealer deals an equivalent number from the remainder of
the deck. Play proceeds to the left, with each player exchanging
up to four cards.  After all players have had the opportunity to
exchange cards,, a second round of betting occurs, following the
same rules as the first.  After all players have had the
opportunity to bet, raise, call, or fold, all hands are revealed,
and the player with the highest ranking hand collects all monies
in the center of the table.  The player to the dealer\'s left
becomes the dealer for the next hand.  Play continues as long as
desired.  In casino play, games are generally continuous, with
players allowed to drop out or enter at any time (provided that
no more than six are playing at any time); home play generally
allows dropping out but not joining.

Hands in Sekhoma are ranked as shown below. In case of ties, the
sum of the values of the cards that make up the scoring portion
of the hand are compared, and the higher value wins.

[Note: this is not the actual ranking of the hands; I have yet to
do the math to determine what the proper ranking should be. If
someone is good at figuring this out, I wouldn\'t object to seeing
him/her post the correct order.]

One Pair - the player has two cards of the same suit.
Two Pair - the player has two pairs, of different suits.
Three Pair - the player has three pairs, of different suits.
Three of a Kind - the player has three cards of the same suit.
Two Threes - the player has two three-of-a-kinds, of different
suits.
Three and a Pair - the player has a three-of-a-kind, and a pair.
Four of a Kind - the player has four cards of the same suit.
Four and a Pair - the player has a four-of-a-kind and a pair.
Five of a Kind - the player has five cards of the same suit.
Flush - the player has six cards of the same suit.
Sekhoma - the player has one card of each suit.

Well, again the rational for why should exist says that they
would work anywhere a PC could run the ship.  If you come
up with rationale why this isn\'t true, you have already laid
the groundwork for just saying it doesn\'t exist.

So you keep coming up with problems and ways to patch them?
No thank you.  I don\'t care for a universe where a technology
supposedly exists, but then has to be contrived so that PC
never use it or are aware of it.  I say just leave it out.

Well, in fact if you had ships that ran on automatic the

be wrong.

Well, we don\'t have automatic freighter carriers now.  More

"Inefficency" is _exactly_ why it is done this way.  I do not want these
data entry clerks to be able to go very fast.  Most of the time the ID
number will just be directly scanned in.  On those rare occasions where
the ID number is imputed manually I want the data entry person to be
forced to go slowly to reduce the chance of error.

The Third Imperium is a _huge_ bureaucracy will tens of thousands of
times more inhabitants than any counrty on earth has ever had.  It takes
years to send messages across it.  They can not afford to have many
errors in the first place, if avoiding errors slows things down, oh
well.

Even without the widespread Vilani cultural influence it would just be
common sense to make things harder to mess up.  In my format there will
never be two numbers next to one another without a letter or a space
seperating them.

No it is not.  One or more of the Third Imperiums sectors, including the
Solomani Rim, have populations of over 1 trillion.  Your system would
require duplicate ID numbers for some of these people.

About 5 years ago, the world women\'s softball championship was held in Normal
Illinois, where I once lived. I was standing in line at the local grocery
behind two members of the Dutch team (blonde, early 20s, very attractive --
sigh). and listening to them chat when I realized they were not speaking
English. I speak English as my first language, and had two years of college
German (I got straight Ds -- I wasn\'t very fluent and my accent was horrible).
Dutch is about halfway between English and German, and I could understand
about 3/4s of what they were saying. It was strange...

Spelling things the same all the time was not something they used to get their

Lester Smith and I used to disagree over this same topic (I would not

Okay, you\'ve got this huge corporation...  Let\'s say Delgado, they\'re nice
and diverse.  They\'ve got cargo ships being sent out from their factories
on some high population industrial world with holds full of holographic
toys.

Without even an attempt to screen pilots, astrogators or whatever, they
don\'t know what they\'re getting themselves in to.  So let\'s say they hire
this guy to be their astrogator.  He jumps the whole ship and crew into
deep space, on purpose because he is a member of a group that believes that
Delgado\'s involvement in the weapons industry is wrong.

Then we find that Interstellarms is involved in a trade war with Delgado in
another subsector.  A Delgado cargo ship hires an average Joe Schmoe pilot.
 The pilot turns out to be a plant from Interstellarms and he guns down the
crew and rendezvous with and Interstellarms astrogator and they jump
away...  never to be seen away by Delgado.

Now, one of two things will happen (as it would in real life), 1.]
Interstellarms would stay stupid and various terrorists would be attracted
to them like flies and embarass them on a constant basis.  This would, at
the very least, take a huge chunk out of Delgado\'s profits.  2.]
Interstellarms would wise up and begin doing comprehensive background
checks on its ship\'s crews.  This would mean they wouldn\'t just allow any
Joe Blow to climb onto their huge, cash-cow cargo ships.

I\'m not trying to say that only my vision of Megacorps is the only one that
can be smart...  I\'m saying that in the real world of the modern day U.S.
that background checks are extremely common.  Drug tests, credit checks,
any kind of check that a potential employer can do they will do (even if
you\'re just a teenager getting a job at a shopping mall food stand).  And
the stakes usually aren\'t quite as high as a huge cargo ship filled with
resources.

Here is where I find your scenario breaking down.  Working passage is an
informal agreement.  "You need a drive hand, I need to get to Lanth.  Wanna
deal?"  A Delagdo Captain, running a multi-kiloton freighter, isn\'t going
to walk into the Starport Bar(tm) and announce "I need a pilot for a run.
I\'ll feed you and you can sleep in the hold."

Also, if you don\'t double check the guys work, or have the computer double
check what is entered with what it thinks it\'s destination to be.  (Could
be done by the Nav computer cross referencing with the Library program on
expected facilities at the point of arrival, vs. what the actual
coordinates are listed as having.)

You are a Captain.  Your astrogator has just been thrown in jail.  You have
a contract to fulfil.  If you miss the delivery window, you stand to pay
fines in excess of what you make in a year, and the company will can your
butt.  Do you: a: go through the lengthy hiring process, or b: find
somebody who can do the job and wants off the rock he\'s on?

As a former security worker, might I say that even with all the checks
crooks still get through?  Everex, a company I guarded while working for
Pinkerton, almost went bankrupt because it\'s line employees were stealing
everything from office supplies to entire computers!  (Note:  Iwas on the
grave shift, and had little contact with workers.  This was not my problem.)

Umm, if I may?  I first manifested my cancer by having a spectacular
seizure.  In nine days at one of the leading hospitals in California, I had
seven different AIDS tests (all negative), visits from every type of
specialist but OB/GYN (each of which was convinced my problem lay inside
their speciality), and an endless battery of tests.

In the end, all they knew was that I had an unusually low platelet count.

Four *weeks* later, and hemo/oncologist, in the first five minutes of his
first exam of me, discovered that my spleen was huge, and needed immediate
removal.  That spleen was the largest ever removed from a living patient at
Stanford, and the biopsy revealed Stage IV Hodgkin\'s Disease.

The point of this little screed is that given a medical mystery, many
doctors will either go for the most obvious answer (a bisexual, skinny, man
with screwed up blood levels= AIDS), or look for a solution that fights
their particular focus.

Hmmm, you could try the FUZION system. It\'s fully scalable by the ref and
doesn\'t have  a skill/stat imbalance like TNE & T4. FUZION (for those who
don\'t know) is a merger of HERO and Interlock (cyberpunk system), and can
convert fairly easily between two.

I agree.  Now if you\'re on the fence about this (like it, but you want to
make sure to retain the history of the game) roll out this technological
improvement a little at a time.

(1) It would probably cost a lot to "overnight" go from manned ships to
fully automated ships.

(2) A transition period would allow you to have some xboat routes using
manned and some using fully automated.  Manned ships can be replaced a
few at a time dependent on the economy.

Speaking of economy, just how rich is the Imperium supposed to be?  With
it spread out so thin, maintaining  a huge military, etc.  Some of the
"lack of technology" available could be due to a lack of funds.

I\'d like to add that it could be mixed.  Maybe a larger manned ship is 
sent weekly while jump torps are sent on a daily basis.  Due to the random 
time in jump (+/- 1 day), there could be a backlog in jump torps.  The 
manned ship could collect the backlog and transport it back to base (the 
message torps are only 4 dtons each (less actually). A two day delay in 
message torps would indicate a problem which you\'d want to send a manned 
expedition to resolve (although, I\'d send a scout for that not an x-boat)

Wow. I hope once they figured it out all has gone well since.

I agree that if you have a hammer, problems look like nails. I\'m
aware that as a surgeon my wife has a focus on cutting as well. That
said, in B5, Ivonova was a surgical patient (trauma) not a medical
one--and should have been. 

My point was that in the case of Ivonova she was dying of her
injuries, not some prexisting medical condition. In this particular
case they had her awake enough to say the right stuff on camera,
yet mysteriously mortally wounded. This was a little goofy according
to my medical source. I claim no medical knowlege other than what I
get by osmosis. The obvious mode for a mortal wound that would take
a while is radiation, but the rest of the bridge would have suffered
equally. (or close, anyway)

Again.  You are Delgado.  You have a ship with a cargo worth in excess of
say Cr100,000,000 (a made up number).  Do you allow the captain of such a
ship the ability to hire and risk that Cr100,000,000 + the value of the
ship + any investment you\'ve made in training these people with your ships?

Sure.  Crooks still do get through...  But they get through in less numbers
then they would without the checks.  I just think when you\'re dealing with
interstellar trade on a vast scale like this, there are certain things they
would do and certain things they wouldn\'t.

Maybe the big corps go through "spacing companies" autonomous corporations
who check and hire individuals to fill such positions as needed.  The
spacing companies have their reputations to look out for so they check
thoroughly, and when a ship is passing through and needs crewmembers they
can look to this company to see who\'s on world at that time.

I am not a big believed in working passage, at least not on ships of above
a certain size.  Not in a role-playing sense (I would never split one of my
party members from the rest of the group) or in the realistic sense.

Then what the hell\'s the point of a working passage from a roleplaying
standpoint?  Originally, I said automating big cargo ships didn\'t really
have too much of an effect on the PCs.  David Summers (I believe, please
correct me if I\'m wrong) stated that this would eliminate the need for PC
skills...  And eliminate adventure possibilities like working passage.

I once did a quick back of an envelope type analysis of an average
subsector\'s naval budget in TCS and came to the conclusion that the
Imperium\'s military is not superlarge for their size and wealth.

Maybe someone\'s done a more careful analysis could enlighten us further.

Working passage is mostly on the small free traders.  Look, I could go to
alaska and just by asking around, get work on a fishing boat.  I could not
just walk up to the Captain of the QE II and ask if he needed help.  The
big corps probably have strict rules against hiring temporary help without
company approval, and any megacorp will have at least an agent on each
world visited by the frieghter to assist the Captain with any problems,
like replacement crewmembers.

You seem to subscribe to the "Things to Come" school.. in the future, all
things will be bright and easy.  Lovely thought, but lousy role-play.

Since Traveller uses a universe where each planet is self governing, and
free traders can make a living, there will always be a need for quick
replacements.  Trust me, I\'m a professional driver, and you wouldn\'t
believe the people we hire based on their DMV printout.. we later learn
they have a clean record simply because nobody ever caught them.

The US Army\'s MLRS has an on-board computer linked to the GPS.  In theory,
all you have to do is enter the coordinates you want to hit, andf the
machine will do the rest.  In reality, the red-legs have learned the hard
way that the machine can\'t be trusted, and to double check.

Let\'s take your auto-frieghter, load it with 750 dtons of refined
lanthanum.  You send it on it\'s merry way towards the 100 diameter limit,
where it happily vanishes in a blink.  Three weeks later, the regional
director is in your office, screaming at you, because severla hundred
million credits of ship and cargo disapered.  You see, the computer burped,
and transposed two digets in the coordinates, but the computer thought
everything was fine.

We are arguing apples and oranges.  A Captain form an established line is
going to have other options.

From "Traveller: The Silly Era (http://www.hooked.net/~dberry/silytrav.html):

An example of relative skill levels

                               by The Space Bozos


In CT, Players wanted to know what capabilities came along with each skill
level. I used Vacc Suit skill as an example.

Skill Level 0 
     Character can figure out which are the arms and which are the legs.
Manages to hook up the plumbing with a minimal chance of messy errors. No
meaningful repairs or maintenance possible. Took a Vacc Suit
familiarization seminar (1 day) at the local Hilton. 

Skill Level 1 
     Plumbing fixtures are recognized as the really important aspect of 
comfort in a Vacc Suit that they are. Can slap a patch on a hole. Arms vs.
Legs are no problem at all. Experienced at cleaning out vacc suits in which 
the plumbing was hooked up by a level 0 user. Took the Vacc Suit course at 
the local Technical school (got an easy credit). 

Skill Level 2 
     Can hook up plumbing so well you almost don\'t notice it. Stitching and 
patching is Routine.  Assigns cleaning up mistakes to level 1 newbies. Can 
make a vacc suit with the proper materials and supervision. Minored in Vacc
Suit in College. 

Skill Level 3 
     Plumbing can be used as a sexual aid. Knows all the tricks of messy 
clean ups (just reverse the vacuum system so...oops, sorry Jack!). Can make a 
Vacc suit with some non-standard materials. Has a B.S. in Vacc Suit
Techhnology. 

Skill Level 4 
     Plumbing can be an ecstatic experience. Can make a vacc suit with 
Improvised materials like Rubber Gloves, Glass fishbowls, Condoms, Super 
Polydent, Final Net hairspray, a seltzer bottle, reflective Duct Tape, etc. 
Has gone to Vacc Suit Graduate School and been in the Vacc suit industry. 

Skill Level 5 
     A true Demi-God of Vacc Suit technique. Occasionally hooks people up to 
vacc suits for a fee (Vacc Gigolo). Teaches at Vacc Suit University. Can make 
an improvised Vacc Suit with a case of condoms (ribbed, Lubricated), a jar of 
KY Jelly and several rolls of Duct Tape. Can make you a tailored vacc suit 
that looks like a Gold Lame dress. 

Skill Level 6 
     Vacc Suits are this person\'s Life. There are still people hooked up to 
the plumbing by this person in a comatose orgasmic state. Runs Vacc Suit 
University. Always wears a vacc suit (although you\'d never know it). Can 
improvise a Vacc Suit with One condom, One Roll of Duct Tape, and a jar of KY 
Jelly. Makes Sector-wide Fashion news with their daring new Vacc Suit
designs.

I agree, 100 kg lifting STR is probably a stretch, but a "normal" man is
supposed to be able to lift his own weight (though I can\'t, I\'m out of

Superheroes maybe, but not "normals" of any flavor or power level.  A good
high energy weapon is probably a 4d6 E RKA AP plus an Explosion of lesser
strength (maybe 2d6K).

A 1d6-1 RKA can kill a "normal" human in one shot when using hit
locations.  Even a 9mm Parabellum does more than 1d6 K.

I think that here we get into the same thing that people complain about in
GURPS.  There are lots of rules, and the GM has to pick and choose which
ones to use.  I will never claim that the Hero System is for everybody.

I agree with the former assertion, and disagree with the latter, by the
examples stated above (all IMHO).

Wholeheartedly agreed.

Yes, that\'s why I try to keep players from designing technology (points
you make below).

I might add that one *always* needs the right kind of players to make the
Hero System work.  It\'s an easy system to abuse, and every group always
seems to have at least one player who doesn\'t care if he ruins the game. 

> HERO tends to encourage "power play", and power play is addictive.  
> Most "addicts" hate it when you try and stop them getting an

Agreed.  Like I said, it\'s not for everybody.  For the situation that I\'m
in now, I think that it will work pretty well.

I wouldn\'t even bother to model a lot of Traveller technology directly in
Hero.  Rather, I\'d just work out damage and armor conversions where
appropriate.  I ran several sci-fi campaigns in Hero (one successful
heroic, one failed superheroic) with tech designed from the ground up, but
not all of it will fit into the Traveller background.

If people are interested in some deck plans done in 2 m hexes, I might be
able to GIFfify some of mine (I\'ve got something like 3 or 4 ships done
this way).  They don\'t have the big jump fuel tanks, though, and I\'m not
sure that the bay weaponry or implied component volumes fits the Traveller
model perfectly, although they were strongly influenced by Traveller.

PCs. 

1) They can\'t fully automate ships which carry passengers.  At minimum,
the high passengers will want a steward who they can actually complain to. 
Also, I\'d expect that fully automated ships will not be as popular with
passengers for irrational reasons like worrying what will happen if the
systems break down "But sir, we have triple backup systems." "Yes, but
they\'re all machines!" 

2) Automated ships (even if allowed by Imperial law, which I\'d recommend
against) will only be cargo ships.  Even here, I\'d expect the automation
to only cover pilot and astrogation.  As Chris Seamans pointed out, a
megacorp is not going to let some drifter with useful skills pilot their
ship, it\'s too easy to come out of jump next to the drifter\'s pirate
friends. 

At that point, assistants, engineers, stewards, gunners (since TL 12-15
robots aren\'t fully sentient, having a human to help in gunnery could
provide a useful level of intuition) and similar support personnel are
much more likely to be hired on as working passage.  Well, some of these
ships may be require by law to have human backup (say one human assistant
pilot or astrogator to be on-call for all three shifts, just in case their
is a problem [this could easily be a legal requirement which the pilot\'s
guild will fight tooth and nail to keep]). 

As for engineers, that\'s a position much more difficult to automate.
Instead of a fancy computer built into the ship which calculates courses
and directs the controls, actually repairs would require a robot.  Robots
are expensive, especially versatile robots which can work inside and
outside the ship in all manner of conditions. Why not just use a human
instead, with a few specialized maintenance bots to help in specific
situations. 

X-boats don\'t need on-board maintenance, since they can be refitted every
jump at the tender, but other ships will need an engineer.  So, when the
rules specify that 100 ton ships can be run with a bare minimum crew of 1
means that this person is more engineer that pilot, since the computer is
doing most of the piloting (basically the one crew would be engineer and
backup pilot/astrogator). 

See, canon and high tech reality work together here :)

This is an indirect answer to your question.. The text below talks about S+C
(Skill + Characteristic) and what chance of success you have at various
difficulty levels. 

Associated Characteristics
	Characters vary as well in their innate abilities. No matter how skilled an
individual is (for example) in Athletics, physical endurance is also of prime
importance... and of two people with equal skill, the one with greater
endurance will more likely succeed.
	Each skill has at least one characteristic associated with it. In addition,
it is possible that unlisted characteristics may be involved in specific
skills.
	The Connect (Or Disconnect) Between Skill And Ability. Documented skill level
(Skill-2, Skill-4, etc) indicates a recognition of a specific level of
training, experience, or education within the stated skill. Because of the
relationship of skill and associated characteristic, the actual probability of
success by a character in a specific situation can be determined by S+C (Skill
+ Characteristic) on the Chance of Success table.

	25	-	-	-	-	-	98%	86%
	26	-	-	-	-	-	99%	90%
Add Skill (S) and characteristic (C) to read the percentage chance for success
for each difficulty level. For example Skill-5 and Characteristic-4 produces
S+C of 9. Read the probability of success at Formidable Difficulty as 38%.

Oh, yeah, another thing for the TravGeek Code: jump drives:

jd- 	- my jump drives are a bit different (say, jump-2 goes through 
	one parsec in half a week) 
jd-- 	- jump drives? I use hyperdrive/stutterwarp/wormholes/whatever

(Or one could just make a general "Heretic"code indicating the degree 
of one\'s hereticness, including the approach to jump drives, AI, 
high-energy weapons and other stuff. )

I quit watching after they began strafing Dallas with all the
remaining rocks from the second asteroid. Someone there must have
really gotten someone upstairs mad...

Besides, I was switching between the women\'s NCAA Championship game
(GO UT!) and later, the X-Files, so I didn\'t see the whole thing; the
multiple silly scenes (like the truck on the bridge) got diluted by
the switching channels.

I thought this was hysterical.  They got something like $60,000 (not as
much as you would expect, I guess).  They didn\'t get caught, but their plot
was discovered...

They may have been caught since then, but at the time they had gotten away
clean and the police said that they didn\'t have anything to go on.

Brilliant if you ask me :^)

Not so brilliant to the family that just saw all the money they had to live on
for the next two weeks vanish after dad went out at 2am to pick up some
baby aspirin. Instead of them getting diapers, groceries and medicine,
some smartass geek gets a new motherboard.

There\'s a difference between Slippery Jim DiGriz stealing from a corrupt 
society and some scam artists cleaning out the kind of people who use
shopping plaza ATM\'s. One thing the two criminal types do have in 
common, though - they could both be very successful at helping people
instead of hurting them.

DiGriz (The Stainless Steel Rat) is one of my literary heroes because
(whether he wants to or not) he does just that. Thank you, Harry Harrison!

Then we are actually more or less in agreement on this point it seems. 
Indie traders would have to rely on this flexibility to, at the very least,
eke out an existence.  Larger lines that relied on small ships, likewise. 
These same folks wouldn\'t have the "political" ties that would make them
targets, nor the resources to do extensive background checks.

Yeah, to some extent I guess.  I subscribe to the idea that people 4,000
years from now will go about solving problems differently than they did 400
years ago.  Technology has changed things almost immeasurably in the last
40 years, let alone the last 4,000.  We do things differently.  Discussions
of ancient empires influencing us aside, actual day to day living has
changed so much.

I understand the concept that Traveller is based largely on the
swashbuckling past of life on the high seas...  To me, though, that\'s just
not the way the Traveller future would be, and I\'m not all that afraid to
upset that apple cart.

As I said, on small ships, independently owned or owned by a small line,
that makes perfect sense.  When you move up to massive megacorps that have
existed for thousands of years, they\'ve had alot of time to learn from
their mistakes.

That\'s fine, from a late 20th viewpoint.  Up the ante by 4,000 years and
you\'ll see something entirely different.  On the other side of the coin,
the phone service has become automated to a great degree, and although
there have been problems, by and large such a complex system works by
itself, and works well.  The internet\'s day to day workings are entirely
automated...  Again, there are errors and problems, but by and large it is
stable.

Yeah, I would agree, but when it comes down to it, banks insure your money.
 For example, if I rob a bank, the bank covers the money.  If my bank is
robbed, guess what?  My money isn\'t gone, the bank\'s insurance covers it. 
Nobody would use banks if that wasn\'t the case.

Only it doesn\'t actually clear out those people.  It takes a small amount
of money out of a vast banking and credit conglamerate that cares about
people only as numbers and dollar value...  y\'know, the same guys who kick
old farmers off their land, stuff like that.  The same guys who take the
money I deposit and invest it in companies like Nike that virtually enslave
3rd world workers and make them work long and hard in order to make so
little money that they might be able to buy a pair of their sneakers after
several _years_ of work.  The same banks that raise the interest on the
credit cards that the father you mentioned has to spend much of his life in
debt...

Of course, being on a moral high horse can come easy to an author who
invents a universe so his main character to be an accidental hero. 
However, in the real world, things are different and black and white is not
always exactly that, and the good guys and the bad guys wear the same
outfits...

ObTrav:  The PCs are from a relatively low-tech "third world" backwater on
the fringes of the Imperium.  They work long hard hours for low pay because
the lack of automation (contrived so that those PCs who were lucky enough
to be born on a better planet could learn "Pilot-1" or "Astrogator-1")
makes it cheaper for Delgado to enslave them to make their shoes...  They
work long hard hours in a hazardous, yet mind-numbingly boring adventure
environment.  They come out of it with
"Impaired-Eyesight-Due-to-Poor-Light-3" and "Eyelet Installation-1".  The
mustering out table is in the Cr0 to Cr1.5 range and...  oh wait, they
never get a chance to muster out unless there\'s a planetary revolt.  My
mistake.

I agree to some extent, but, 4,000 years is a long time.  Look how quickly
we in the U.S. got used to an automated phone company.  Sure, we bitch and
moan and complain up a storm that there\'s no "people" to talk to.  Sure, we
say, "What if some little kid\'s parent has an accident, who\'s the little
kid going to talk to when she dials 0??"  and all that jazz...  But that\'s
only in, what, my life-time?  We put up with it and all that.  I\'m not
arguing this.  IMTU passenger ships have real people onboard because it\'s a
refreshing change for travellers who are used to their hectic, otherwise
highly automated lives...  Among other reasons.

I don\'t see the Imperium having a problem with this.  In the case of the
Xboat network, 1 highly infectious, yet slow acting debilitating virus
released at a remote scout base, or a starport bar with a good number of
scouts, would bring the entire network to its knees in pretty short order. 
The downside of the Xboat network.  Of course, a computer virus could do
something similar if the proper access to each Xboat\'s inner workings were
allowed, which doesn\'t have to be the case.

Well, no. 

Until public pressure was put on the bank to accept some
liability, the banks were prepared to meet every claim of lost funds with 
a statement that funds were withdrawn according to the terms on the 
bank card until the person stolen from could show otherwise. IIRC, the
bank later covered it\'s position by claiming that people, on hearing of the
scam, emptied their own bank accounts and claimed to have been
similarly taken.

Interesting that my condemnation of people who use a clever scam to
steal from ordinary people (Bank Presidents and Senators tend not to
use the ATM\'s in shopping plazas) places me on a moral high horse...

at the beginning of your post, if not somewhere near the beginning of

People used banks for years before deposits were insured. Tellers used to be
personally responsible for the cash in their drawyers, even after a robbery.
Tellers in Mexico as recently as the 1930s carried pistols and shot it out
with bank-robbers.

Some practical matters: It can take several days or a week to get reimbursed,
epecially when you are dealing with a large, multistate bank. And the
insurance doesn\'t always cover the bank\'s overdraft fees from checks bouncing,
and they sure as h*ll don\'t cover the fee you have to pay your landlord when
your rent check bounces (I speak from experience -- my old bank screwed up and
checks began bouncing -- the bank took weeks to straignten out the snarl, and
while they forgave their own overdraft fees, nobody paid me back for the NSF
fine the landlord soaked me with. That\'s one reason while they are my old bank
- -- but they\'re all pretty much the same these days). So the poor schlub of our
example is still out of bucks for a time.

Basically, theft is theft, whether you use electrons or a gun and a horse.
Stealing from a large, faceless megacorp just means that the large faceless
megacorp boosts everybody\'s banking fees a little to cover their insurance
fees, that the insurance company bumps a little to cover them actually having
to pay off someone, which is why I have to pay $3.00 if I actually want to
talk to a living human being at my bank -- everybody spreading the cost around
until they get to us, who has nobody else to suck it from. Gahd, I\'m beginning
to sound like my father...


In another vein:

I saw on the news a year or so ago about some chap in Florida who started the
"I Don\'t Care" long distance company, so when the operator asks which long
distance company you want, you say "I don\'t care" and the operator hooks you
up. The guy charges a penny or two more a minute than average, nothing
outlandish. What irks me about the whole thing is this: "Entrepreneur" in the
USA has beginning to mean "Cooking up some crackpot scheme to shave $.03 each
off 100,000 people without your having to lift a finger." rather than building
a better mousetrap (or whatever).

ObTrav: Traveller has banks in it, and people who rob other prople (OK, so
it\'s pretty lame...it\'s late and my head hurts).

to others.  As always, comments and criticisms are welcome...  This post
seems pretty long, so I apologize in advance to digest-reading people who
can\'t ignore it.  Read on if you\'re interested in a slightly different take
on technology.

AUTOMATION

Automation lurches ahead at great speed in the real world, let alone in the
world of Traveller.  Our phone companies are automated, the internet is
automated, and our satellite communications are automated.  There is real
talk of automating cars to reduce traffic problems and accidents, and
reduce pollution.  Many of the functions in an automobile are automated and
tied together by computers.  Our machines of war and defense are
increasingly automated, and so on.  To believe that automation is going to
stop at any time in the next 4,000 years is a rather archaic notion.  For
people to have an irrational fear of automation 4,000 years in the future
seems, at least to me rather unrealistic, especially when automation would
permeate all aspects of the life of the average Imperial citizen.

30 years ago, when the philosophical questions behind automation were first
raised, some reacted violently to such ideas, but by and large automation
has chugged on.  It has made our lives simpler in a number of ways, but we
still find it to be a nuisance at times.  It is much easier to "tap Mac"
(get money from an Automated teller machine) before a shopping trip than it
was to go to a bank and withdrawal money before the advent of ATM systems. 
If you need to buy toilet paper at 2 A.M. and are flat out of cash, you can
get the money.  Only 10 or 15 years ago, you would have to wait until the
next business day to withdrawal the money you needed and you\'d have to come
up with some...  alternative... to toilet paper.  Automated banking has
certain advantages to individuals as well as banks.   With easier access to
cash, people carry less money around, which means that losing your wallet
or being robbed will have less of an effect on your financial situation. 
With more money in the banks, the more money that can be invested and the
more money that the bank is able to make off of your money.  Automated
telephone systems bring far-flung families closer, and allow a much wider,
far more robust global  comm network than human operators behind banks of
sockets ever could.  The advantages of automation, in most cases, far
outweigh the disadvantages.  In the grand scheme of things, automation pays
off for _almost_ everybody in the real world.

According to the tech notes in some T4 books, "roadgrids" which allow
autopiloting of grav vehicles in populated areas are extremely common. 
Such a high degree of automation in the year 0 leads me to believe that the
citizens and rulers in the Imperium have much more faith in their
technology than we seem to give them credit for.  It\'s only natural.  We
live in a world with a much lower tech level.  Automation is pretty new to
us, and it can be a really frightening concept.  However, as the old cliche
goes "time heals all wounds", and this is one wound that will undoubtedly
be healed with time.

As processor power becomes cheaper, and as storage space becomes cheaper,
automation will become more and more efficient.  As time passes, automated
systems will be tested literally trillions of times in elaborate real world
simulations.  This process will remove many bugs, and reveal the
limitations of these systems that can be repaired by design teams over long
centuries.  After all, if you told a telegraph operator in the late 1800s
that within 100 years machines would be able to do his job, and do his job
far better than he could, you\'d be laughed right out of the telegraph
office.  Yet, over the course of only a century, this is exactly what
happened.

The world of the Imperium is completely ludicrous without automation. 
Automated factories churn out starships, air/rafts, plasma weapons and all
manner of other goods.  Automated banking, credit, and communications
networks have their payoffs.  Automated "smart" homes and businesses will
change living and working and make life in the 3I much different than life
as we know it now.  The Imperials trust automation much more than we
because it\'s not "new" to them at this point, and it\'s been in use for a
very, very long time.

ROBOTS

There is an extremely interesting book called _Out of Control_, I forget
the author\'s name and I don\'t have the book within arm\'s reach right now. 
If anyone\'s interested in it, I can fill you in if you\'d like...

This book is a fascinating study of the ways that organic systems and
mechanical systems will become more and more integrated as time goes by. 
The author goes in depth and brings up a number of isolated pictures of the
world of today, that when put into perspective with each other, paint a
very interesting picture of the future.  Basically, the author\'s intent is
to show how "mechanical" organic systems really are, and how "organic"
emerging technologies seem to be.  This vision of the future is "fast,
cheap, and out of control".  This book is a fascinating read, and ripe with
ideas for science fiction in general, not just Traveller.  All in all, a
really good book that I highly recommend whether you agree with my views on
automated Xboats or not :^)

My view of the future was strongly influenced by this book, especially the
future of control systems.  As one example, instead of the old school
sci-fi view of a maid robot that wanders around cleaning and fixing and
keeping the house in order, dozens or hundreds of small, cheap robots would
do the same job.  If your maid robot blows a widget, you have to repair it
or replace it, in the meantime, your house doesn\'t get vacuumed, your pets
don\'t get fed, and your vidscreen gets dusty.  If your cheap vacuumbot
blows a widget, the robot that picks up larger debris will still do its
job, and it\'ll be much easier to repair or replace it.  This, at least to
me, is a much more fascinating snapshot of the future.  Instead of Tweekies
and R2D2s running around booping and bleeping, houses, starships,
workplaces, and space stations would become thriving mechanical hives... 
The complex webs and combinations that will result will make the future of
robotics a far more organic prospect.  None of these ideas really pose a
threat to canon.  In fact, their right in step.  No need for highly
intelligent super robots or anything of the sort.  

Not that I\'m saying I don\'t believe that there will be a need for versatile
superbots, mind you.  I believe that in certain areas, expert systems and
full blown AIs would be required...

COMPUTERS or "Let me tell you a WOPR of a tale!"

Back in the early 80s, the film "WarGames" introduced us to an artificially
intelligent super-computer known as WOPR, aka Joshua.  This machine blinked
and beeped its way all day and all night thinking about World War III,
planning, projecting, re-planning, projecting again, etc.  WWIII was run
over and over in its mind.  The original idea behind the project was
creating a computer that could learn from its mistakes.  If the computer
could learn from its mistakes, it could minimize the body count for our
side, and maximize it for the enemies side.  It started small, Chess,
Tic-Tac-Toe, Checkers, building a repertoire <sp?> of tactics for use in
"the big game", Global Thermonuclear War.  Eventually, the lovable computer
learned the lesson its designer never taught it, futility, and moralized
that global thermonuclear war was a futile undertaking, stating in the end
"Strange game, the only way to win is not to play!"  Such a thing was in
the realm of speculative believability back then, after all, it _could_
happen, right? (I remember my late, wonderful grandmother saying as we came
out of the theater, "Nothing\'s safe,  even your toaster could turn against
you!")  If you have not seen WarGames, it\'s a good watch although some
computer-type people will laugh at their playing around with baud-rates and
graphic displays...

Speculative believability became reality, as it so often happens.  When the
United States began testing out it\'s new system that would think of war all
day and do nothing else, they decided to test it out with an Iraq-US war,
seeing as they were a "likely" opponent.  It ran through an Iraq-US war day
and night.  Interestingly enough, the US went to war with Iraq during this
time.  The more cynical among you will surely comment on the ironic
coincidence, I\'m sure.  Due to the able and capable leadership of "Stormin\'
Norman" Schwarzkopf, and the less than admirable resolve of the Iraqi
troops, the victory came much quicker than the computer predicted.  Nobody
said that machines were perfect :^)  (note, this story is explored and
explained more fully in _Out of Control_, not to plug the book again)

The point is, expert systems that border on artificial intelligence already
exist in the modern day.  They\'re pretty crude, I\'m sure that they\'re
physically huge, and are most likely disgustingly expensive, but they\'re
here now.  The myriad uses for such technology imply to me that these
systems are probably going to stay, get better, and become far more
efficient.  Maybe HAL-9000 wasn\'t manufactured in 1992, and maybe it isn\'t
singing "Daisy", but, I don\'t think we\'re as far off as many would think. 
Maybe they\'re not going to be "creative" (a nice fuzzy word that people can
point to and say "It ain\'t intelligent, it ain\'t creative, it\'s still a
number cruncher!") anytime soon, but they\'re only going to get far more
complex in the next 4 millenia.  Like more traditional automation,
simulations can be run for years to see the AIs ability to function in
various situations...  It would be relatively easy, after all, to make the
system believe it was on a ship and run, and re-run the simulations.

And those are the just the crude ones!  As we study the world more and
more, we learn that nature leans heavily towards combining small, cheap,
fast units into creations that are greater than the sum of their parts. 
Watch an ant colony as an example.  As a more relevant example, look to the
human brain.  Each part seems to act more independently than we previously
imagined.  If one part functions improperly, the rest may still work
perfectly.  Our eyes are more than just viewports, they have complex
machinery that processes the images before they reach the brain.  Our brain
works in a pretty much decentralized fashion.  Screw with the part of the
brain dedicated to vocabulary, the remembered-skill segment may still
function normally.  All these segments create something greater than the
whole.  Again, I am fascinated by the visions for a science-fiction future!
 Intelligences grown "from the ground up", decentralized thinking machines
with versatility and creativity, as well as the "expert system" ability to
learn from mistakes.  Sort of combining the sciences with a "wine growers
art" building these intelligences for certain applications.

These ideas are not all that threatening to canon, as you could put the
expert systems between TL12 and 15, and the funkier ones at TL17.  My own
tastes as quite different, as most folks who have read my previous posts
will already know.  I think expert systems AIs starting at TL10 and
increasing in ability and sophistication over the course of the next tech
levels.  I think that these systems would be absolutely necessary for jump,
space-traffic control systems, starship piloting, etc.  I think the other
brand would start at TL12 and increase in sophistication and be extremely
useful in many areas.  In fact, the symbiotic relationships between all
forms of technology and human beings brings us to my final chapter at the
moment...

CYBERNETICS

I leafed through the Cyberpunk 2.0.2.0 rules recently and laughed.  I don\'t
mean to insult anyone by saying that, just so much seemed so dated and
funny.  I suspect that almost all of the ideas in this article will be
hysterical to those reading this article in the year 2020, but that doesn\'t
bother me.  The future changes so fast, and it will continue to change at
such an incredible speed that visions of the future are dated as fast as
their made.  However, to throw up your arms because you\'re not going to get
it right is to go against the grain of sci-fi.  To be a sci-fi fan, you
_have_ to speculate on the future using whatever means you have at your
disposal.  Sure, we can look back on old sci-fi and laugh, it\'s our right
(especially if the sci-fi has William Shatner as a beer-gutted, brawling,
over acting starship captain with shades of the complexities of JFK).  _The
First Men In The Moon_ (was it ol\' H.G. who wrote it, or Mr. Verne?  I
forget at the moment) got the physics wrong, but the idea was sound.  The
Buck Rogers comic strip is laughable, but most of the little details are in
use, or have at least been tried...  rocket pistols, rocket ships, fax
machines (not kidding!  Of course there was a suitably funky name and look
for them), visits to the moon, expeditions to Mars and Venus, robot
laborers.  The details are wrong, but the concepts of "good" sci-fi are
solid.

The Cyberpunk 2.0.2.0. rules and background are an example of this.  While
Buck Rogers took decades to begin to become dated, C2020 became dated in
just a few years.  They\'ve got big-haired rock-stars with chrome-metal
arms, psycho soldiers with subdermal armor, mechanically boosted reflexes,
and chipped skills...  etc, etc.  Some of it seems so funny because we
don\'t need chrome limbs and neural jacks to be cyborgs.  We already are,
and the subtlety was almost completely overlooked in the game.  To the
authors\' credit, there was a wonderful example of this at one point in the
rules when they describe the fuzzy line between cyborgs and normal folk... 
"is your girlfriend a cyborg because she wears contact lenses?  Is your
grandmother a cyborg because she has a replacement hip?"  The answers, of
course, are yes.

Furthermore, I\'ll venture to say that our symbiotic relationships with all
sorts of technologies makes us more cybernetic than we think.  Telephones
are a perfect example.  Could you survive without a telephone in the modern
world of the United States or Europe?  Your dependency on the telephone is
far more extensive than most would think.  They have become so important
that they are grafted onto us psychologically and emotionally, as well as
(with those who have cell phones and beepers) physically.  Without surgery
and chrome limbs.  As the intricate webs of technology increase in
complexity, we will become more and more cybernetic, without the need for
implantations...  Organic technologies will become more and more prominent
as well as we obtain more of a grasp on such things...

Back when someone came up with the idea that you could be declared
"non-sentient" if you replaced too much of your body with robotic implants
had his heart in the right place.  Visions of munchkins with fully robotic
bodies wiping out platoons of crack Imperial commandos flashed in their
heads, wrecking the GMs carefully planned ideas of game balance.  The same
idea was the impetus behind the "cyberpsychosis" of the C2020 game... 
Both, at least to me, seem dated and seem to stem from a crude
understanding of cybernetics.  Sterling\'s _Islands In The Net_ introduces
us to a character named "Sticky" a Grenadian commando who has crazy little
beasties swimming around in his stomach...  When he eats yogurt, watch out,
he\'s a killing machine!!!  His strength is heightened, his reflexes are
heightened, and he\'ll open a can of whoopass on you if you don\'t watch out.
 This is perfectly scientifically sound from my understanding, and an
enterprising munchkin could easily retain citizenship while still getting
the same effect of being a complete "badass", without the messiness of
expensive, dangerous surgery...

So, what\'s the point of all of this somewhat unconnected rambling and
ranting?  The future of technology can\'t be seperated from the future of
culture and the future of humanity.  You can\'t just say, "Hey, the Imperium
has laws against that sort of thing!" every single time that a new idea in
technology surfaces that is potentially damaging to some piece of storyline
canon.  Vilani conservatism will only hold up as an excuse so many times
before it wears thin.  After all, how about the Zhos?  Do they use these
technologies?  Why not?  Oh...  That\'s right, there\'s the fuzzy excuse that
"it just doesn\'t work".  Doesn\'t work for the Hivers, doesn\'t work for the
K\'Kree, doesn\'t work for the Aslan, the Vargr, or the Zhodani...  Yet, by
all appearances, these things are beginning to work for the TL8-9 Solomani,
right?  The Imperium has laws against psionics, yet SuSAG manufactures
PsiBoosters outside the borders and "makes sure" that they don\'t end up in
the hands of Imperial citizens.  Laws only go so far before they\'re broken.
 And what happens when they are?  

I\'m not presuming to push my "Travellereality" on the rest of the list,
although others have directly and indirectly tried to push theirs on me by
saying that I\'m not playing Traveller if I\'m not playing by the laws that
they have in their heads about what Traveller is and what Traveller isn\'t. 
I am saying, however, that maybe the future of humanity (er...  humaniti
rather) is different than R2D2 bleeping robotic obscenities cutely at C3PO
(we all know ol\' R2 has a mouth like a sailor), or the Tempest... er...
Lost in Space Robot droning "Crush...  Kill...  Destroy!!!" and warning
Will Robinson of danger.  More importantly, there is space for all of these
views of the future in Traveller because it is, after all, "Science-Fiction
Roleplaying in the Far Future".  The science in science-fiction may come
first when we figure out the physics behind near-c rocks and rod lobbers,
but the fiction is what makes us want to go there in the first place, while
the \'Far\' in \'Far Future\' implies that any predictions we make will be so
off base that people will look back on them with a smirk like "Robot
Monster" or "Plan 9 From Outer Space"...

IIRC, they were caught when the cops checked all the junk yards in the area
and found one that had recently sold somebody a used ATM. The perps, not

I knew someone would call me on this after I edited a few lines out  :^( 
People\'s trust in banks was all but eliminated as a result of the Great
Depression and the fact that nobody could do a damned thing to get their
money back.  The original line read, actually, "Nobody would put their
money in banks any more..."  But I figured that I didn\'t need to mention
the depression and dumped it.

I agree that theft is theft.  But theft is made more acceptable when a
large company does it, and does it with intangible things.  Nobody lifts a
finger when miners in upstate PA are oppressed by coal mining companies to
this very day, the theft of whole lives, esteem, and any hope of success. 
This paragraph wells up in me my youthful idealistic railings against such
faceless organizations that I can rectify it in no way with being on the
Traveller mailing list.  Suffice to say, with or without the thefts,
they\'ll bump the prices up anyway.

Yes, the painful fact of our way of life is this type of crap...  My
ex-girlfriend\'s father was the CEO of a major company.  The stories she
told me about him and his sexist, racist, and generally unethical practices
not only curled my hair, but also removed any faith I ever had in the
ability of massive corporations to make a better life for us as a species. 
Particularly, when a certain segment of his workers became overwhelmingly
African-American, he stopped giving out turkeys to that segment as a
holiday bonus.  This is the type of "success" we idolize in this country. 
But I digress, I don\'t want to take up valuable list space with my bleeding
heart diatribes.

Another problem with AI, is that to be useful, AI has to have "free
will". Which means that either you grant them rights from the start, or
you\'ll have a nasty rebelllion later. And then they\'ll wind up with
rights anyway.

This kills a lot of the "why have humans do it if an AI can do it
cheaper?" stuff, because if you have to *pay* AIs and they have rights,
they just become another kind of PC.

Which reminds me of a bit in an *old* Andre Norton SF novel "Star
Rangers" (sold in paperback as "The Last Planet"). One character is
commenting to another about the chief engineer their ship used to have.
A robot. "He was quite good with engines, being one himself."

I agree that other sources will be used, but I also think that given
the costs in the rules, fusion power will both greatly reduce costs
*and* pretty much eliminate the "central power plant with distribution
grid" model that we are used to.

It\'s quite possible to buy and maintain a fusion generator that can
handle your household\'s energy needs. So I see neighborhood "power
co-ops". You\'ll buy into the coop, and that way you can get power from
them if you need extra, or if your generator breaks down. The rest of
the time, you "sell" your excess to the co-op for distributions to
others who need it. And the co-ops will have interlinking agreements so
they can sell exccess power when they have it, and buy extra when they
run short. They may also buy "battery" banks or other power *storage*
gear so that they can save the surplus power (residential power use at
3 am is pretty low except for heating/cooling) for peak demand times
(like 6 am when everyone wants a hot shower and cooks breakfast).

This model works well in colony type setups, as you don\'t have to
invest in huge plants up front unless you have a specific *need* for
them (some sort of industrial processing). It also makes the individual
housing units safer in the face of unexpected weather conditions and
the like.

In any case, power will be available *cheaply*. That makes a big
difference. Consider the aluminum industry. It moved to places like the
Pacific northwest where power was cheap (half the cost of elsewhere!)
And where there was "surplus" power. 

Having power even cheaper than northwest hydroelectric will make
it possible to use processes that would be "too expensive" with other
sources of power.

That\'s a *hard* way to generate power. First, you need a singularity
that is accessible, small, but not *too* small. Then you have to spin
it up (if it isn\'t already spinning). And then you aim what amount to
particle beams at it with *great* precision. Then you get to try
collecting the energy given off by the interaction.

If you just dump mass into a non-spinning hole, you have to settle for
the Hawking radiation. And much of that is at inconvenient wavelengths.
And the output is determined by the mass of the hole. The heavier, the
*less* power it puts out.

Axtually, the big reason for doing things this way is to reduce data
entry errors. After some of the hassles the US ran into with the ZIP
code, you will note that both the UK and Canada went to a format that
alternates letters and numbers, groups characters in such a way as to
make it obvious if someone gets the order of a pair of groups swapped.

So I\'d go for NLN LNL NLN LNL or LNL NLN LNL NLN. That makes it harder
to swap groups by accident. And believe me, that *is* a consideration
with ID numbers! You *want* certain combinations to be impossible, so
as to catch entry errors.

Actually, it\'s *possible* to use the jump drive (which *is* FTL
"communication") to do time travel. It\'s just *hideously* impractical.
I don\'t recall the details except that it requires some manuevers at a
high fraction of c. Not the sort of thing that even the Imperium could
afford to try very often.

I don\'t think so. The formulas are *messy* and they don\'t much resemble
the Newtonian formula.

Nicely done, Loren. IMTUs, I\'ve always used replicating nanotech as the
basis of Ancients high-tech devices with non-replicating nanotech
beginning to occur around TL13. I\'ve justified the lack of widespread use
due to Imperial law; if you think nukes are bad, the effects of uncontrollable
nano-disassemblers on a human being are absolutely horrifying. Illegal use
of nanotech is a high justice crime with the guilty being subject to partial
nanodisassembly (depending on the severity of the crime).

May I recommend the inclusion of some examples of nanotech devices at the
various TLs?

Speaking of TLs, can you tell us if the TLs normally used for GURPS will be
modified in the GURPS:Traveller publication to fit the Traveller standard or
remain at the GURPS standard? (Hopefully, the Traveller standard...)

A friend on the SFPD told me the following:  A man walked into one of the

announced "this is a hold-up, give me $50,000 or I\'ll shoot you."  The
teller, without missing a beat, asks: "do you have an account with us?"
When the crook replies in the negative, she pulls out a number of forms
(hitting the alarm at the same time) and sweetly tells the guy that they
have to fill out a few forms first.

She kept him standing there for close to eight minutes while the cops made
their way through rush-hour Financial District traffic.  My buddy told me
that she got very inventive, saying that she needed to know the model and
caliber of the gun, what the money was being stolen for, etc.  When the guy
would get balky, she\'d sternly remind him that the bank *had* been in
business for over one hundred years in the City, so they must know what
their doing.  When the cops arrived, he was still searching for a second
piece of photo ID!

I can offer a counterexample.

Last spring the brother of one of my kids was murdered. He was beaten over
the head, suffered severe hemoraging, and the doctors figured he only had
a few days to live. (During this time my kid and the rest of the family
kept a bedside watch during visiting hours, talking to him in the hopes
that he could hear even if he couldn\'t respond.) Then he made a miraculous
recovery, and was sent home. Then a week later a weakened blood vessel
broke, and he died in his sister\'s arms.

So, trauma can give you a limited time to live.

So why don\'t we all shoplift?  It\'s not really hurting anyone other than
the giant chain store that only see us as consumers and marketing numbers.

Pirate software!  You think Microsoft will even notice if my copy of Office
shows up on a dozen different computers?

Steal cable TV!  God knows that any system as bad as TCI doesn\'t really
deserve my money, and I only watch six of the channels.. they\'ll never
notice if I\'m suddenly getting HBO and Showtime.

Ooh.. Even better!  When GURPS: Traveller comes out, I\'ll buy one copy, and
photocopy it for everyone.  It only takes a few dozen sales away form SJG,
and they can absorb the blow.

Have I made my point?  Stealing, no matter who it hurts, is wrong.  Even if
the money is insured, that money to replce it comes from somewhere.  If the
bank is robbed, it\'s insurance rates go up, so it increases it\'s fees.

I don\'t know wether to laugh or cry.  I invite you to go to any regional
routing station for the American long distance phone lines.  You will see
chaos theory in action.  It takes human moderation to keep the computers
from crashing the system.  Remember the big AT&T blackouts?  The ones
blamed on hackers and used as justification for the trials of Phiber Optik
and the Legion of Doom and Operation Sun Devil?  Caused by *one* line of
bad code.

     Can you scoop a sun for fuel like a gas giant?
How exactly do fuel scoops work? Do they physcially suck in atmosphere and
use a filter/catalyst to separate out the bits they want? (A physical
scoop.) Or do they use a magnetic field to attract the ionised elements
they are intersted in? (A magnetic scoop.) It would be rather hard to use
the former on a star. By the time you got close enough to have any sort of
density it would be rather hot (anyone know the temperature of the solor
corona?). The latter, though, might be of use. The sun streams all sorts of
ionised particles out all the time. I imagine you could easily go within
safe distances where the particle density was high enough to adsorb (anyone
know the density of solar wind?).
     In the game we\'ve found this little stopover base in an "empty" hex.
The ref hasn\'t decided if it is a brown dwarf, an errant gas giant or what.
It sparked my curiosity. If it was a brown dwarf, or a piddly M9 star,
could we scoop it? As long as it is positioned well, you could make money
on pass-through trade with only fuel as a local resource.

shrug and continue with their own excuse, or adopt yours. The latter will
skim the side-bar and may make a mental note to flick through GURPS Ultra
the next time they are in a games shop to compare with what they have come
up with.
If they never wondered about it they will probably skip the side-bar
completely during the first few passes of the book. The history of the
concept of nanotechnology section might pique their interest and the might
make a mental note to flick through GURPS Ultra but since its never been a
problem, they are unlikely to worry too much about it.
If they\'ve been curious, but not enough to deal with it, they will probably
read the side-bar on the first pass. The history will set the ground for
them and the reasons for not having Nanotech will probably scare them
enough and sate their curiosity.

For GURPS players buying it as another worldbook, the bit about it not
being in the history of Traveller will be enough for them. They are already
familiar with the concept of worldbooks and expect each one to include or
leave things out. They are probably already aware of GURPS Ultra and know
how to graft that in if they desire.

First time gamers are likely to be in the minority. They will probably be
familiar with the concept from Star Trek and be relating to that. The
section makes it clear that you don\'t do this in Traveller because of all
the other implications. They will probably go away wondering more about
Star Trek (like _that\'s_ how the replicators work! or so why don\'t these
bad things happen in Trek?) than about Traveller.


In all of these cases the side-bar is, basically, a one-pass text. Any of
the above are likely to only read it once and never refer back to it. The
only reference material in it is about the history of Nanotechnology and
the other GURPS book lists. This might indicate that the whole could be
reduced down a lot to just focus on the bits that are likely to be refereed
to more than once with the minimum necessary to facility the decision trees
for the above gamers.
Personally, I\'d suggest finding another bit of "Tech we don\'t do in
Traveller" and combine it with section. Possibly making it into a more
generic section on "There are things we ignore or handwave to preserve the
setting" with Nanotech and one other as examples.

Cheers,

Jo

   <snip>

   Nice try Jo, but it still doesn\'t work.  G:T will never in my mind have
the same status as MT or TNE, nor should it ever--unless Marc Miller
formally declares so.  On that day, I will lose at least some portion of the
respect I have for him.

   I have signed this account off the TML and when I get home I\'ll sign my
account there off too.  I think its time I step back from the list for a
while, as clearly I am way in the minority when I assert that there can be
something tangible called a "Storyline Canon" or a canon timeline that
unites all Traveller players by giving them a common frame of reference, and
seperates those who write for the game into "Traveller writers" and
"Traveller variant writers".

   GURPS: Traveller is the fair haired boy of the moment.  No doubt if Loren
decides to take G:T in a direction similar to MegaTraveller, the same masses
who praise him and look forward to G:T will be the same ones will be ready
to burn SJG down and hang Mr. Wiseman from a tree.  Such is the way of the
Traveller universe.  For God sake Loren don\'t use the Empress Wave in G:T, I
like you too much to see you get a neck tie party.

   What really disturbs me though is the total failure of people to grasp
the concept that there *could* be something that unites us all.  Maybe it\'s
because we are no longer united.  Through four versions of the game we have
become nothing more than groups of hostile factions that would rather
skeptically examine everything Traveller and adapt (or adopt) it--or
not--into our local campaigns.  \'Canon\' is therefore a misspelling of
\'cannon\' which is something low tech people point at your starship causing
the crew to giggle.

   Given this, no future version of Traveller will appeal to a majority of
current Traveller fans no matter how well written or how closely it tries to
stick to the original story arc.  The real future of Traveller (if it still
has one) belongs to new fans, not Byzantines.  By creating a new majority, a
future publisher may be able one day to re-establish such concepts as
Storyline Canon.  Hopefully those who are considering having a go at
publishing Traveller material themselves will think about that.

   I hold my head up high, knowing that I stand for principle.  Time for the
tar pit Harold.

Harold

GURPS players *will* wonder why a high-tech society doesn\'t make use of
nanotechnology.  Other GURPS Tech books make the assumption that nanotech
becomes commmon (even pervasive) at higher tech levels, so its absence
in Traveller will be noticable.

I think that even some experienced Traveller players would like a good
(even "official") rationale for why nanotech isn\'t pervasive in the
Traveller universe.

As long as they aren\'t too convoluted and dn\'t stretch credibility too
much, I\'d prefer explanations and reasons for why the Traveller universe
is like it is.  My gaming group *will* want to know why they can\'t use
nanotech (or invent it) or use automated ships, etc...

This seems like a reasonable sidebar item (not main text).

Nice post.  IMTU, robotics and expert systems appear at about TL9,
increasing in complexity and reaching  the symbiotic point at about TL
19.  Rumors have it that the ruling class of the Human Unity (my heavies)
use them extensively.  Of course, no one has yet to substantiate this.

The biggest scream of the night came when the bimboid astronemer said "it

The TV set is a good six feet from my couch, and I swear half a can of

You kiddin\'? I _loved_ this movie! To see 2 F-14s use an onboard
"anti-ballistic laser" to *instantaneously* blow away a massive
asteroid in space. Gollie gee, it makes me want to join the U.S.
military! Now this is Sci-fi!

Of course, they got the velocity wrong; _everybody_ knows that
the only asteroid worth hitting a planet with *must* being moving
at near-c.  :-P

Still, since I live just outside of Dallas, it was fun to see it
scragged.
Then I could visit all the gaming stores in the area and take advantage
of all the post-apocalyptic sales and buy up all the GURPS books!

Brings to mind GDW\'s IMPERIUM, a boardgame of the 1st thru Nth interstellar
wars in the Traveller universe...their description of Tankers says that these
ships can retrieve and process fuel, IIRC, from "Stellar Atmospheres". They
were very useful because one of the two lines of advance on the map went
through Sirius, which has no planets at all. The Tankers did not allow fleets
to jump into deep space, you had to have these tankers in the tertiary system
(system without planets) - makes it sound like the Tankers in this game
weren\'t carrying fuel with them, they were gathering it on the spot.

I\'d have to add that in IMPERIUM, refuelling wasn\'t a real problem in any other
star system - the only limit was that you had to stop movement in a system
containing enemy combat-capable ships. You could withdraw during
the combat resolution phase with no fuel problems though. Very different
that Fifth Frontier War.

    They probably were a big influence on a lot of Traveller players.

"Regina Honey Wine will get you through times of no money better than money
will get through times of no Regina Honey Wine"  (slightly modified to fit
Traveller.  In my BT campaign, we would use "Meltine Meltdown").

I still remember the words of Commander Cockroach on hearing that hundreds
of his Cochroach army was killed in battle, "Plenty more were they came from."

I\'m still planning on springing a Vargr based on Micky Rat on my players...

The point is:

Players A, B, and C need to get to point B from Point A, and haven\'t got
any money. They do, however, have shipboard experience and skills. They
can try to get a working passage aboard some form of transport. They may
not be utilizing their skills as such, but they\'ll be recognized as people
who know what buttons not to push as they do their duties as Vending
Machine Technician 4th Class.

IMTU, working passage _can_ be found, but you\'re the one who gets to clean
up after the herd of live drivelbison the ship is carrying. That way the
people buying the drivelbison only have to pay one drivelbison herder to
accompany the herd, the rest are made up from unlucky ships\' crew or
players looking for a free ride.

They\'re just not going to get a working passage as ships astrogator,
that\'s all.

Actually the company is called  KPNP  which,  when  muffled,  can
sound like AT&T (or visa-versa).  The  owner  set  up  around  50
different trading  names  including  "I Don\'t Care",  "It Doesn\'t
Matter", "Anyone Will Do", etc.

But its not just  "Entrepreneurs"  that  pull  scams  like  this,
government\'s do too.  With only 276 days to go until  the  launch
of the Euro (European single currency) France found  it  did  not
meet one of the key  entry  requirements.  That  requirement  was
that government spending was not more than a  set  percentage  of
GDP.  Despite drastic cuts they were still too high so a way  was
found to \'raise\' GDP.  French  government  figures  for  GDP  now
include an estimate of the Black Market!

Ob:Trav ... Does the GWP in Pocket Empires include  black  market
economic activity?  And is there a way to  determin/estimate  the
size of the black market in relation to GWP?

I keep meaning to convert GURPS to MT but haven\'t got  around  to
it yet.  However check out the conversion notes in 3G3  ...  this
should allow you to convert  from  GURPS --> 3G3 --> MT  or  from
GURPS --> 3G3 --> Twilight 2000 (which is TNE system) ... for TL,
range, damage, etc.

Home planet designation helps to make the number unique and mean something
more than a string of numbers. Consider, no matter what kind of
apportionment scheme the bureaucrat devise each world will eventually run
out of numbers under a strict sequential model like you propose (usually at
the least convenient time). Any single world above say TL-3 has the
capacity to monitor ID numbers for uniqueness, but the limitations of
interstellar communication prevent instantaneous comparison. Therefore, two
individuals within a sector *could* end up with identical ID numbers.
Granted, the chance of this is very low, but possible. Furthermore,
including world ident follows the pattern I delineation stated with sector
and continuing through subsector. 

After sleeping on the subject it occurred to me that world need not be four
digits. Since there are only 80 hexes in a subsector, only two digits would
be required.

Good sir, the last thing any sane person would deliberately want to do is
slow down any bureaucracy. :-) They are plenty slow enough of their own
inertia. Suffice to say that we must agree to disagree on this point.

OK... How many subsectors exceed one trillion? Worlds?

How about this. What if the leading part of the unique part of the ID
number was a day stamp? If written in hexadecimal a four digit segment
would provide 65,536 combinations. If used one a day, the bureaucracy would
be satisfied for over 179 years. The question I wonder about is how many
births happen every 24 standard hour period on even the most populous
worlds? Six digit hexadecimal would allow for 16,777,216 combinations.
Would this be a big enough number for a population \'A\' World.

For those who think I am being completely silly about numbers, my intent
with this branch of the thread is to make this unique numbers mean
something more than just a unique, long string. My inspiration is the U.S.
Social security number where the number blocks (xxx-xx-xxxx) actually refer
to IIRC locations and dates when the number was issued. While probably
minutia, I think this degree of color is a good thing.

I once read a story in the paper about this bank robber (or robbers, I
forget now, it\'s been such a long time) who went into a bank, drew a gun,
and stated his intent to rob the place.  He ended up staring down the
barrels of a room full of guns...

The thing he missed when he cased the joint was that it was the bank that
the FBI used for payroll.

Then there was the story of the armed robber who led police on a footchase
right out of a 70s TV cop show.  Down back alleys, up fire escapes. 
Eventually he eluded them and it appeared he got away clean...  Only on one
of the fire escapes he used, the cops found his glass eye which had his

Okay, fair enough.  Point taken.  On the other hand, I saw a show on
shoplifting relatively recently where on of the folk at Walmart or K-Mart
was being interviewed.  I left with a bad taste in my mouth as their
damages go apparently only one way...  The damages for predicted
shoplifting are already figured in.  If actual shoplifting is far lower
than average (as the TV led me to believe it was), there is no reduction in
damages the next year to account for it.  IE, if there\'s less shoplifting,
it\'s a bonus because there\'s this extra money floating around.

This is a line, much like anything else, that each person must draw
individually.  I will support a company fully if I believe in them or their
product line.  Honestly, I will pirate without a second thought if I feel
that they are trying to take advantage of me in any way.  Those are my own
beliefs, and I apologize if they\'re not morally correct.

I have actually done this in the past.  In my area, as in most parts of the
country, there is a single cable monopoly.  This company has very bad
business practices.  You need someone to come out and fix your cable box,
terms are dictated rudely to you and freely broken without consequence. 
The prices are astonishingly high despite the percentage of homes that
purchase cable and despite the fact that the company itself has a massive
infrastructure behind it.  I live in a lower-working class neighborhood and
yet our cable prices are higher by a margin of over 100% than those in
"nicer", more affluent neighborhoods, to me this is taking advantage of
folks who really don\'t need to be taken advantage of).

Again, different people will choose to draw their lines in different areas
to me, my cable my area cable monopoly are clearly criminal.  I have no
problems, morally, with ripping off the criminal element.  To me, this is
theft as clearly as any other theft.

This isn\'t where my line is drawn.  Frankly, the majority of SJG materials
I\'ve picked up have made me want to support them.  They work hard for the
dollars that I work hard for and can appreciate that.

Yes, you\'ve made your point.  To be honest, I have been guilty of every
single one of the crimes above at one point in my life or another.  I have
my own moral and ethical code that might not be the same as the moral and
ethical code of others.  I don\'t have to throw a stone very far to see
injustices commited outside my very own door and the grey areas of morality
that result.  For example, I can look at the galvanizing plant down the
street when I walk five feet out of my house.  I can\'t smell it anymore as
I\'ve lived so close for so long it\'s a normal background smell for me.  As
I walk to my grandmother\'s to visit, I sometimes walk closer to it to save
time and breathe in its nasty noxious fumes...  Yet, it employs a number of
people in my neighborhood that otherwise would not have jobs.  This factory
would have no ability to exist in more affluent neighborhoods.

That\'s not to say that my morality and ethics can\'t change.  I have a mixed
view of the police department.  As I grew up, I got to crunch crack vials
underfoot and see crackheads firing up in an alley only about 15 feet from
my house.  I got to be harassed constantly by the dealers and their
customers as I walked by, ("Hey kid, need an ass-kicking?").  I got to see
gang wars fought outside my house and got to see my dad have to replace his
car windows about once a month when it got warmer as a result of attempted
theft and groups of baseball armed gangbangers who wanted to beat the f*ck
out of the gang up the street...  I got to have the fun of calling 911
because there were people with bats outside beating each others brains out.
 Packs of 20 - 30 thugs smashing car windows.  I got to see the cops show
up in one or two hours, and yet I saw the same cops sitting for hours
chomping down at the local Dunkin\' Donuts.  I got to see a five foot two
female bisexual friend of mine get chased down by two massive hulking
homophobes and when I thought I was doing the right thing by going to the
cops and requesting help I was threatened with arrest and told to leave
their sight because the homophobes looked less weird than I did (I tried to
track her down and she eventually got help at a coffee shop 15 blocks
away).  I had a cop threaten to "break my ribs" for the oh so serious crime
of standing outside of a club getting air after I tired of dancing. 
Obviously, as a result of this, my view of cops is pretty dim.  On the
other hand, my local police force has started a program of community
policing ("walking the beat") that really has changed my neighborhood for
the better, to the point that I feel much safer about walking a few blocks
to the store.

What\'s my point?  Let me see if I can express it clearly enough...  I don\'t
need anybody to lecture me on where my moral compass may point.  I\'ve had
enough lectures in my short 22 years from all sides, on all kinds of
ethics, to last me far longer than I can hope to live.  Yes, I have a
mistrust bordering on seething hatred of banks and big businesses.  My
family has roots in upstate PA, I get to visit them about once a year and
get to see the wreckage that was left behind as a legacy of the coal
companies, a legacy that is still alive and thrives in other areas of
upstate PA.  These same people, my flesh and blood, are left to eke out a
meager existence on useless land, filled with anger, bitterness, and
alcohol because these oh so f*cking wonderful companies and banks have
given up on them.  They\'re too poor to move, and don\'t have the skills they
would need to survive anywhere else.  This is what I\'ve seen with my own
pair of eyes.  This has nothing to do with shoplifting, or copying GURPS
Traveller, or anything of the sort.  This has to do with basic life and
quality of life.  A quality of life that was robbed from these people as a
result of bankers and corporations and the ways that they exploit and use
people only in so far as it is profitable and screw them when they no
longer serve a purpose.  The whole thing creates a vicious cycle that is
damned near impossible to escape from.  

And no, before anyone calls me on this, I do not have an answer to these
problems.  If I did, I\'d be out achieving it, not drowning my miseries in
escapist role-playing entertainment.  I\'m sorry that I am completely unable
to boil down complex ethical issues to terms of black and white as simple
as some people can.  I apologize if I see that the miserable living
conditions of my own flesh and blood are a direct result of corporations
and banks.  I apologize that this is the reality that I must live and
breathe in, and  I apologize if it\'s different than your own.  And yes, in
case anyone is thinking of calling me on this, I understand that the
current web of banking, commerce, and industry is what allows billions more
people to live and exist on the earth than was ever possible.  This irony
is not lost on me at all.

For the record, as my final comment, I don\'t want anyone to think that I am
whining about how hard my life is.  Despite any problems I may have
personally, I don\'t bitch and moan.  I\'ll carve out my own niche in life
and I\'ll do what I\'ll need to do, and my moral and ethical center will be
where it is.  In the meantime, I will continue to point out where I feel
that injustices lay and where people are being used as objects so that some
fatcat corporate exec can make an extra gazillion dollars this year.  I
will continue to rail against my state\'s piss poor labor laws that allow
companies to get away with gross injustices against, for example, my
mother.  And, I will continue to rail against these corporations that enact
these injustices against my mother.  This company that is trying everything
in the book (with the exception of actually firing her) to make my mother
so uncomfortable in the workplace that she\'ll leave after almost three
decades of working her ass off, so that they don\'t have to pay her the
extra money she\'s earned in that time period...  And the fact that she has
no legal recourse, even though this is obviously what\'s happening.

Y\'know, actually, the more I think about it, the more this really pisses me
off.  Like, I need somebody to come along and lecture me about how
wonderful and lovely and sweet big businesses are and that even though we
are being ripped off and screwed we shouldn\'t pirate Microsoft or steal
cable?

Whatever.  Sorry for taking up list space.  I\'d rather clear this up once
in public rather than several times in private e-mail.

Yes.  If I remember it right, wasn\'t it a missing semi-colon??  Anyway, yes
there are errors, and yes that at our current level of technology
automation isn\'t absolutely perfect.  I don\'t think I am arguing that. 
However, on the whole, would you say that our modern day phone service is
more automated, or more run by human beings?

Again, I believe I stated that there are errors, but, by and large there
are far less massive Internet blackouts then would would imagine with the
mind-boggling complexity of such a vast, interconnected network.  The
internet, in my opinion, is stable.  At least from my end.  There are lags,
servers go down, there are software errors, etc...

But the whole still functions in an automated manner and stays up, despite
the various predictions to the contrary that were spouted when the Internet
craze was born.

Or perhaps their brains will begin working and think of all the interesting

You make first time gamers sound pretty stupid.  You\'re also leaving out a
whole group of possible targets for the book, probably a minority, but a
group that is at least represented in my own game.  Folks that are not
first time gamers, but are not familiar with GURPS, and who happen to be
highly interested in emergent technologies.

Not to beat a dead horse, but my brother lost interest in Traveller in the
early/mid 80s when it became apparent that Traveller was far slower to
change than the real world.  Nowadays, he has stated plainly that Traveller
as it is played "by the book" does not interest him in the least because it
doesn\'t even mention the possible effects of emergent technologies.  My
brother is a relatively rare case, I\'m sure, but that\'s where his interests
lie.  Even the lack of a mention of such things is enough to drive him off.

Another member of my campaign is going to school for physics, and hopes to
one day work in the field of nanotechnology.  This is his gig, and this is
what he\'s interested in.  Again, although he has not clearly stated it as
my brother has, a lack of a mention of why nanotech isn\'t used might turn
him off from playing the game.

I don\'t know the number of folks who are like these two.  Statistically,
I\'m sure that they\'re in the vast minority.  But, you\'d be surprised at the
number of people who have heard about nanotech from other sources than Star
Trek.

I agree.  The whole thing should be combined into a more extensive section.
 However, I\'m not sure that cutting it down in size would help it too much.
 You\'ve got to define the ultimate result of nanotech (MEMs, "smart fog",
"grey goo") so that readers of the book will know where Traveller draws the
line and makes its limits.  Not everyone knows all about nanotech, and some
who do have a passing knowledge that doesn\'t result in realizing that total
manipulation of matter will be the result of such technologies.

To me this is as great a sin as automating it so that it just doesn\'t

smacks of contrivance.  We\'ve gone from PCs being able to use their

Well, I guess the only thing I can say is that IMTU they\'re not going to
get working passage on any sort of megagigantic cargo ship at all.  Chalk
it up to different playing styles I guess.

If its a brown dwarf it seems reasonable that you could, as if it were a
truly huge gas giant.  If its an M? you may not be able to, without some
type globe or super alloy.  I can\'t lay my hands on my star data right
off, but I seem to remember the surface temperature of M class stars is
somewhere in the 2000 - 3000 deg. C range.  We\'re melting steel here, but
the real problem is, what if the corona is like those of our sun\'s.  The
corona surrounding our sun is about 100,000 deg. C (if I remember right,
I might be off by a factor of 10).  Its one of the mysteries of our sun. 
Even if you design a system able to scoop the plasma from a cool star,
the coronal temperatures might make it unapproachable.  I\'d suggest that
you bribe, cajol, threaten your GM to make it a brown dwarf.

I would be interested in finding out how they determine social security

I probably have the details wrong, but I think the first three digits have
to do with the date of issue in some sort of arcane code. The second two
refer to the location of the office from which the application was
processed. The final four are a unique code, specific to the applicant.
Like I said, this probably wrong, but I remember hearing something to this
effect. Maybe I learned this on the TML? ;->

One problem is surface gravity; typical brown dwarf surface gravity is in
the 30-G range. Skimming trajectories probably don\'t require thrusts > 
surface gravity (as long as you\'re doing the skimming at near-orbital
velocities, you can come in on a long skinny elliptical orbit) but those
gravities are high enough to make even this approach problematical (the
velocities involved would be painfully high.) A generous referee might
allow a very very tough pilot task to find a trajectory that would work,
if the ship was Hypersonic streamlined.

superdense and crystaliron can probably survive this (starship waste
heat radiators require temperatures in the 2000 K range.) Sensors and
antennae wouldn\'t be happy - apply a bunch of surface hits to the leading
edge of the ship. Cooling the ship overall would also be a problem.
The best approach would be to skim way way out in the tenuous outer edges
of the atmosphere, where you could radiate waste heat away from the star...
it would probably take several days and require a bunch of engineering
rolls to keep the heat balance right.

>the real problem is, what if the corona is like those of our sun\'s.  The

Corona temperatures are a few million degrees, but the corona is sufficiently
tenuous that it doesn\'t convey any significant amount of heat - like passing
your hand quickly through a candle flame, sort of. The photosphere
(the few thousand K regions) are where you get heat from.

In summary, skimming from a (small) brown dwarf is probably an Impossible
pilot task (failure indicates that you\'re stuck in the brown dwarf).
Skimming from a star might take ten times as long as normal, with a
Formidable engineering roll every few hours, with failure increasing the
ships interior temperature and two consecutive failures causing damage
to crew and ship components. (Plus, every surface fixture on the sun-facing
side of the ship gets melted off.) Ships with EMM or other thermal masking
would make the roll one level easier, since they have surplus radiator capacity
and plumbing to cool the hull.

Hig GM already has a story line where refueling in the empty hex should be
possible.  He\'ll start looking at cometary bodies if this doesn\'t work out.

Incidentially, this is all from The Traveller Adventure which has no actual
base, but I wanted a base dammit (just a station, with refuelling
capabilities) and I\'m gonna get one...What good is being the GM optherwise.

Of course, if I *knew* Jo was going to want to make it into a casino...

Automation - while no doubt it will increase in the future, there\'s going
to be a point where very few people will have jobs, because they\'ve all
been replaced by automation - much like you don\'t see elevator operators
anymore, there probably won\'t be any need for factory workers in the
future. Eventually, a society will have to decide just how much automation
they want, because virtually every job I can think of, save perhaps
scientist, can be replaced by some sort of automation. And once AI\'s
exists, scientists can be replaced....

Robots - Much like above, robots take away jobs from humans. Eventually,
there won\'t be any jobs left. Will people like this? Possibly, but I really
don\'t think so. The majority of people I know like working, or would, if
it\'s something they like doing.

There\'s also cost - would you buy a robot that cost millions of credits to
fill a job, or would you hire a guy whose salary is 100,000 credits a year?


Nanotechnology - While it can be perhaps very very useful, it\'s also very
very dangerous. Nanomachines going amok could conceivably wipe out the
human race. I just don\'t think it\'s going to be widely used, due to the
potential danger. Look at how cloning has been banned, and it\'s not really
dangerous. Given the small size of nanomachines, I\'d think they\'d be
extremely prone to get damaged, and er  \'mutate\'. One or two incidents
early in the 1st Imperium (or Earth\'s future), and people will abandon it.
Look at nuclear (fission) power - people really don\'t like it after 3 Mile
Island.

And finally, remember that the tech level of the imperium varies from place
to place, just like it does on Earth.  This will definitely affect things.
I can seem some places being automated - hi tech, low pop worlds, mostly. 
A lot of places won\'t have the tech for automation and the like. And some
that do won\'t use it, for whatever reasons.

Now, using cometary bodies is a good idea, I\'ve used it before.  My First
CT campaign (oh, how long ago that was....) had the players finding an
abandoned alien base in the Oort Cloud of a small planetless star far
from the local lanes.  Part of the base, and what they loved, was the use
of a small fusion plant, fuel purifiers, and tankage to convert comets
into fuel.  They made a fair deal of money off it as well.  Of course,
when the local pirates found out, they had quite a fight on their hands.

Technical point - roadgrids are common *on Sylea* ... the capital of the
Empire, and one of it\'s most economically developed worlds. It\'s also a
civil service bureaucracy, with a high law level, so people there
presumably dont mind a bunch of \'this is for your own good\' regulation.

Quick warning on this. Completely automated factories that churn out things

with a high degree of automation wont.

Just so we can kick numbers around, how much would these microbots cost,
and how many would you need to keep, say, a Type S scout (1400 m3, 4 small
staterooms) clean ?

How long do they last (I assume you wont bother to repair them) ?

How does this relate to average Imperial income of 6-12 000 credits a year ?

In short, are these minibots a thing for the rich, or are they for everyone ?

Neccessary, or sufficient ? I think you wont get an argument on
\'neccessary\' for a jump, because a working starship computer has always
been required to make a jump.

Piloting, on the other hand, should be able to be done with guts, a steady
hand and either working sensors or a Mark 1 eyeball :)

This movie should have been called "FEMA to the Rescue!", especially
when they successfully evacuated Kansas City out to 200 miles in two
days (?!?!?!).

I think the producer was trying to see how many inaccuracies he put
into the film in the first hour. After Dallas got whapped, I gave up
on it and went to the X-files....

This is correct - in all particulars except for your statement

strong family resemblance.

No, I don\'t think so - but perhaps if the highest hand is tied,
the second highest hand gets the pot.  I\'ll have to think about
it.

Speaking as a former telephone programmer, while the software is
(possibly) the most reliable on the planet, the authors are _not_ liable
for damages. Fixing problems (or to be more precise, spotting potential
problems and preventing them from turning into real problems) is what
telephone companies keep their engineers around for. That and repairing
damage caused by careless backhoe operators!


I assume that Traveller starships are already automated, incuding whatever
robotics are appropriate for the tech level. Does this mean that high-tech
crews have less to do?  No, because I also assume that the workload has
also changed. This seems to be a universal trait (in our culture, at
least): when the job gets easier be increase the workload, or add tasks
that were previously unnecessary. 

Example 1: cleaning. We now bathe once a day (on average),before running
water this was once a month (if that). During the fifties and sixties all
the labour-saving devices in the home merely changed the standards of
cleanliness so that the time spent on housework was the same. (I mean, who
really needs daily vacuuming?)

Example 2: engineering. We no longer spend a lot of time doing intricate
mathematical calculations. Instead, our computers do the calculations and
we spend our time writing reports about the answers the computer gives us.
(I remember when a vice-president killed most of a one-hour meeting trying
to get consensus on the _font_ that would be used for an internal report!)

Example 3: teaching. When my mother taught she spent most of her time
working with students. Now I spend 1-3 hours a day fiddling with
paperwork: writing curriculum, performance metrics, psychological
assessments... stuff that wasn\'t considered necessary in my mother\'s day.


So, in Traveller terms this means that a TL15 crew still has work to do.
Repairing machines, checking up on the automatic systems, and trying to
anticipate problems and avert them before they become crises.  A TL11
crewmember may envy them their \'free time\', without realizing what\'s been
added to the workload.

Not being able to conduct interstellar background checks is not
anywhere near the same thing as not making any attempt to screen 
people.

Well, I wouldn\'t include the highly questionable implication that
injection mass is "cononical".  Or that this deserves the most
"pro jump drive" code.  If you want to cover both the question
of whether people use Traveller type jump drive (vs stutterwarp,
etc.) and also what explination they use for jump drives, them
make two different codes.

Well, you are a lot better of if you only seek to invoke "partial 
automation" (though you still have same issue with PC involvement).
As I have said, it isn\'t clear to me that canon necessarily says
what you need to man a ship during jump (it allows one person
with multiple skill sets, but doesn\'t demand which skills they
be).  It does have some issues with crew requirement rules
that would have be handwaved....

"Somebody is a dead man, and the dumb idiot probably

Seems a certain young thug late one night, went into
a 7-11 store in North Boston(the Italian part of town), and
proceeded to rob the place. To make the point to the
clerk that he was serious, he pistol-whipped the elderly
gentleman in line to buy cigarettes, while not paying any 
attention to the big black limo out front, and the burly customer
standing beside the elderly gentleman.

Bad Move.. Elderly Gentleman\'s occupation..
Head of Boston Family of La Costra Nostra

There were a whole log of "investigators" out looking to
find the young man, and the great majority weren\'t associated
with the Boston PD.

To put this in a Traveller context...
When role-playing rogues in Regina, don\'t
go to a "Sun and World" store in the Vargr
District, and pistol whip an elderly Vargr,
who has a big black luxury grav car out front, and
who is accompanied by a "friend" who seems to
share a lot of genetic tendancies with Dobermans..

1. I remember someone saying several days ago that there were 
actually *three* Traveller mailing lists. Where should I e-mail to 
subscribe to the other two lists?

2. Why does the QSDS & SSDS stop at 5000 dt? Could the FFSv2 system 
be used to create ships that are larger, and if so, does FFS itself 
have a upper tonnage limit?

3. Has anyone done any "third-party work" that would expand SSDS (or 
FFS, if it\'s limited) to include ships with displacement tonnages 
similar to the old CT ships (generated under High Guard rules)?

I\'m sorry if some of these questions might be a bit silly, but I\'m 
just getting back into Traveller after about a 12 year hiatus and 
I\'m not that familiar with anything other than CT.

Nicely put, Loren, especially in pointing out how
ubiquitous nanotech can hamper adventure opportunities
for human (or whatever) adventurers.[A couple of
nukes could probably have disabled the Death Star\'s main

However (you knew there\'s be one, right?), 
one more point you might like to sneak in
is the fact that, once released, self-replicating
nanites would have to deal with the same problem
biological systems do -- replication error.
And if the error is such that it does not
cause "sterility", you\'ve got a bunch of 
nanites that won\'t be following their original 
programming -- evolution in progress.

If nanites were used to turn a world\'s previous
population your house, would _you_ feel secure
that *all* of those nanites had been deacivated?
Or might there be a few faulty ones, brewing up
their numbers to continue their mission -- on you!

Hmmm...  I don\'t see this same vision of the future, based on the past and
the present.  Automation eleminates jobs, but, it also creates the ability
for a wider infrastructure which creates more jobs.  My brother was telling
me about the early days when my dad was working his way through college. 
My dad, an electrical engineer, used a slide rule for calculations.  Then,
a little later he bought his first calculator.  It was a major purchase, it
was _second hand_.  One of those things I find truly amazing, a _second
hand_ calculator.  The calculator allowed him to do things quicker and with
much more accuracy.  Now, he uses a computer networked with many other
computers at his job.  The complexity of work that he can handle, and the
speed that he can get it done, has increased off the scale...  CAD programs
and complex simulations have replaced the slide rule and hand calculations.
 Quite an impressive jump.  When my brother went to high school, the
teachers wouldn\'t allow calculators in their math classes...  They were
afraid that students would rely on them too much as a crutch.  Then, when I
went to the same high school a few years later, you were required to have a
calculator for the very same classes.

Automation eliminates roles, but it also changes others immensely.  I\'m not
sure that the trend towards automation will suddenly fall by the wayside
because the average Joe gets put out of a job.  That hasn\'t stopped it so
far, and the average Joes are still finding jobs.

It doesn\'t matter if people like it.  For example, as I said under
different circumstances in a different post...  automation allows an
increased population, and allows rampant population growth.  The majority
of people in the world get fed as a result of this network, and the
backbone of this network is a wide variety of forms of automation.

Previous to the mid-18th century, there were roughly 1/3rd of a million
people wandering around on the planet.  When this level was reached, it
basically topped off and didn\'t change too much for 1,000s of years. 
Automation has allowed the world population to skyrocket to something like
6,000,000,000.  I like being alive more than I like having a job,
personally.  So whether individuals will like automation or not is less
important when weighed against the fact that the same automation makes
their very existence possible.

Call me optimistic, but, I think that people will still work side by side
with machines as they do today, and have for many, many years.  Whether the
machines are rodent-like automatons, superintelligent number-crunching
expert systems, or huge steam driven clothing presses the result will still
be humans working hand in hand with them.

> There\'s also cost - would you buy a robot that cost millions of credits

I don\'t know.  The robot doesn\'t take vacation, never needs a sick day, and
may be able to handle certain tasks far better than a human being.  The
robot will (probably) never complain about his job, will never give his two
weeks, and doesn\'t have to get a raise...  The phone company has replaced
people behind counters connecting phone wires on request with \'robotic\'
versions of the same exact thing, at a far greater cost than the salaries
of the operators.  Many companies have done similar things in real life...

Human cloning, the buzzword of modern day pop-bio-engineering has been
"universally" outlawed.  Folks rail against the idea claiming \'you can\'t
clone a human soul!\' and similar battle cries.  When our understanding of
the results of today\'s theory turns into cheap bio-engineering 20 years
down the line, and some hyper-capitalist Asian market churns out the first
human clones, that\'s when we can talk about this.

Nukes are dangerous.  Fission plants are dangerous.  Coal power plants are
dangerous.  Complex chemicals used in manufacturing are dangerous. 
Bio-engineered viruses are dangerous...

Yet these things still exist and are researched.  Currently, the Japanese
are pouring hundreds of millions of dollars (if not billions by now) into
nanotech, and NASA has a fair portion of its budget thrown that way.  It
doesn\'t seem to me that the dangers are scaring anyone off yet.

Bio-chemical weapons are \'bad\', very \'bad\', but they are still designed and
manufactured in factories in the United States and Europe, not to mention
the rest of the world.

This goes against any concept of reality though.  The world was of lower
population before the dawn of automation, and it\'s not even that
sophisticated yet.  Any world with a TL of 6+ (if not lower) will begin
building an automated industrial infrastructure.  Hardly need high-tech to
get it off the ground.

Okay.  I should read my sources more closely.  Although, you\'ve come up

I\'ll have to think about.

As with anything, IMTU I\'d put a person at the top of the chain here.  I
don\'t think that there\'d be a need to create factories that chug away
almost pointlessly forever.

Funny you should mention that, I was going to do a little piece on some of
the more common versions of these robots.

> How long do they last (I assume you wont bother to repair them) ?

Depends.  They\'d be cheap enough to be disposable if they did break down. 
In this case, I honestly don\'t have the specifics mapped out.  My
gearheading was coming later.  That\'s the way I work, I bring up an idea,
or get involved in a discussion, I think about the idea, then I do the work
in rough draft form, then finished form within a few weeks.

Cheap.  Really cheap is my goal.  I\'d have to eyeball it a bit to tweak it,
but everyone could have them if they needed them.

> In short, are these minibots a thing for the rich, or are they for everyone ?

The way I envision them they\'d be as common as telephones, vacuum cleaners,
and what not in our own society.

Hmmm...  Good point.  I think that at the very least, a highly efficient
form of computer would be the absolute bare minimum to attempt a jump.  I
mean, unlike Foundation, I somehow doubt there\'s going to be some guy
pouring over charts with a slide-rule erasing and redrawing lines.

I dunno.  I think that such systems would be required for a jump to have
some assurance of safety.

It is able to be done with guts, a steady hand and working sensors...  But,
the Imperium wouldn\'t always trust guts, a steady hand, and working sensors

Yes, but this was not very healthy for the ship. And as traveller

probably be incinerated. Even BGs would be overloading pretty soon..

This is that fuzzy "creativity" angle in AI.  Can your spellchecker write
books?  No.  Was your spell checker created to write books?  Nope.  Can
your spell checker drive a car?  Can your spellchecker do something it was
not programmed to do?  No.

Let me restate more clearly:  If a machine can be programmed to check and
correct a jump course, why couldn\'t the same machine be written to enter
the jump course in the first place?  The function doesn\'t seem to be wildly
different.

However, the function of writing a book and checking spelling are worlds
apart.

  This sort of assumes that the data that needs to be monitored is more
along the lines of a small factory/refinery/power plant, rather than a
couple of dials on the dashboard.

  Admittedly, it also assumes that software (/"expert systems") is limited
in performance or capabilities, such that humans trained sufficiently to
make informed, autonomous, intelligent decisions being on the spot is then
desirable.

  This still leaves room for robots as grunt labourers, warbots (Hivers &

  What, a subsidized trader under HG is the size of a large trawler or small
factory ship, costs around MCr 100, and has nearly 400m(^3) of drive spaces,
and has a listed crew of five (and could probably operate with 2 if you allow

  There are some problems with Strikers AFV crew #\'s, but MT\'s crew/automation

As I heard it, the bank was on the 9th(?) floor of a building in

But not _predictably_ days or hours to live. What happened was
typical, they think somebody is OK, but something pops up later and
they crump. Damara maintains (she was actually home last night :-)
that the ones that they typically don\'t think will make it usually
don\'t wake up. And the ones that do wake up don\'t elicit a "well,
this one has only days or hours to live!" responce.

Again, I have no doubt that this happens, but the docs don\'t usually
pronounce somebody mortally wounded who can still talk, etc. They
obviously wanted a speaking Ivonova who was mortally wounded, it
just isn\'t likely once she gets to medical care.

ObTrav: Culturally, what does ihgher TL medical care do? Are people
more or less willing to take risks? If they don\'t, they might be
able to afford analgathics by the time they retire. They can also
get fixed up if they get into a trauma... This is the kind of path
Niven took (looking at cultural implications of medical
improvements, that is) with the organ bank stories.

Welcome back friend, I know the feeling.  As to why QSDS stops at 5000
dT, I don\'t know, but I have FFS2 and if has the 1,000,000 dT limit like
High Guard.  Of course, I cant accept that, so I extrapolate for things
over that limit.  

Can you say 10,000,000 dT Colonial Transport?  {:o      I knew you could.

Most likely if people really believe that medical care is better, they
will take more risks.  When airbags were installed in cars at the
urging of the insurance industry, accidents became more common and
more expensive even though the driver survived with less injury.
Anti-lock brakes have done the same thing.  People drive faster through
bad conditions because they feel safe knowing that they have anti-lock
brakes and airbags.  This sense of security is sometimes false, but
that doesn\'t stop people from pushing limits.  Apparently, when
seatbelts became mandatory, the number of auto-pedestrian accidents
increased.  The point of all this is that people are willing to take
a certain amount of risk and when you make things safer they will
do more so that they are back at the same level of risk.  Of course,
this all depends on the perception of risk and doesn\'t necessarily
relate to the actual risk.

Now if faith in medical care for trauma doesn\'t increase but anti-
aging drugs became available, then I could see people becoming much
more conservative since they would have much more to lose... would
you risk your life knowing you had potentially 1000 years of life
ahead of you?  What about if you had 10?  It\'s quite a difference...

Scary thought for a criminal.  :^)

As I learned last night from the film "The Newton Boys," one of the members
of the gang went on to rob a bank at the ripe old age of 77 in 1968.  He
was caught and lived out the remaining years of his life in a rest home.

I try to imagine my grandmother robbing a bank.

Scary thought.

There\'s a middle ground between hiring just anybody without so much as a
background check and waiting months for a background check to go through.
If a Delgado captain suddenly lost his astrogator, he\'d might decide to
just jump without getting a replacement. Big cargo ships would have several
astrogators. If he\'d lost several and absolutely needed one, he\'d first try
to get a replacement from another Delgado ship who happened to have a
suitable 4th Officer they could spare. If no one was available, he\'d try to
borrow or steal one from a well-established local company. If that didn\'t
work he\'d try to get one that was born on the planet or at least had lived
there for a long time. And if he finally had to make do with an absolute
unknown, he\'d do the crucial work himself and keep a wary eye on the
newcomer.

Your analogies work well in realtime but not (IMHO) in Traveller because
most of your added workloads at higher TLs are bureocratic in nature but
the Imperium is for trading etc a homogenous culture but with oddly
different shipbuilding TL. If a TL 15 crew fill their time with intricate
administrative issues why aren\'t the TL 12 guys required the same amount of
paperwork? Isn\'t the bureocracy dictated by laws that apply to all ships or
is there different levels of compliancy required for different TLs?

I would also take this opportunity to point out that in FFS2, you can
choose what level of automation you want.  At Low automation, control
panels are fixed, the coputer is removed from any decision making, and the
crew requirement is high.  At Standard, the computer can assume some of the
routine operations, controls can be reconfigured, but a sizeable crew is
needed to properly run the ship.  High automation has the computer almost
in charge, with the sophonts on board providing little more than
supervision and control over critical evolutions (take off and landing, et
al.)

When working with automated systems, I like to do flow charts for their
decision making (god, I love having a computer to make those for me!)  This
prevents me from playing a non-sentient security bot as an inquisitive person.

That\'s actually based on a comment made by mao during the period when the
PRC and the Soviets were engaged in artillery duels across their border.
When a soviet diplomat threatened that they would kill millions, Mao calmly
replied "good, less mouths to feed."  The soviets quietly backed down.

Ok answers for some:

2: QSDS and SSDS were originally designed as ways of makingships for
player characters, hence the rather arbitrary 5000dTon limit. This is not
a universally liked state of affairs. 

FFS, on the other hand, will allow you to create a ship as large as a
sector if you really, _really_ wanted to do something silly. actually,
there was some discussion regarding planet sized structures some time back
on this list. Teh upshot was there\'s no way you could design a hollow
vessel that size..it couldn\'t hold itself up in the middle. 

Once upon a long time ago someone posted the underlying equations for the
QSDS (or SSDS I disremember which) tables which would allow, in theory
bumping up the hull size.

However, you also have to remember the oringinal game rationale for these
systems, that these systems represented standardized small ship
construction methods, again, emphasis on the _small_.

3. Some previous HG-> T4 conversion has been done in the past and posted
on the list. I can\'t remember when, searching through the archives at
ftp.mpgn.com would turn it up. IIRC they would have been posted sometime
last summer or fall.

The main upper tonnage limit in FFS is brought about by limits on surface
area; use of surface area for some systems becomes more efficient at
higher TLs.  This can be exceeded by "house fixes" such as grapple booms,
radiator fins, and plasma vents (the latter with associated extra fuel
consumption).  IMTU HEPlaR drives also function as a plasma vents.

Battle Rider (associated with FFS1) had *play stats* for various large CT
/ MT ships (I\'m assuming those are the ones you mean, like the Planet
class CA), but detailed FFS design figures were omitted.  The largest FFS
design ever published in full detail was, I beleive, about 5000 dt, but I
haven\'t seen all the Challenge articles.  I have designed several warships
in the 10,000 - 100,000 ton range without breaking any rules.

Not silly at all.  Also, the CT rules still work by themselves.  :)

Still not very on the mark, IIRC: mid-16th century China alone had over 1/3

Um, maybe it\'s trying to explain human nature and the 3I with respect to
something... ah stuff it, I\'ve no idea... :?

- ----> I was being flip - what you describe is the big problem. I\'d say
the sticky part is does the computer know enough to suggest a _better_
course? I think we can assume the navigator is using the computer while
plotting the course, but how much could the computer do on its own? I assume
there is some element which requires a human - a modern day computer-game is
made using computers at every step for graphics, sound, etc  - the process
could not be completed without a computer, yet it also cannot be completed
with only a computer. I\'ll have to look, but I think CT allowed a Nav
program, which could replace a navigator, the programs were always portrayed
as second-best to a human.

Ummm, so you can export the goods and sell them to other people ? One of
the \'core\' assumptions is that the 3I is a capitalist free-market.

If my completely automated factory can churn out goods at 80% of the cost
of your made-by-humans operation, the odds are that I am going to eat you
alive in the price-sensitive markets.

In FFS2, Table 159 (Basic Hill Size) only goes up to a megaton. Equation
67, from which table 159 is derived, has no such limit.

However, Structural factor (overhead for decks, bracing, etc etc) is a
function of volume ^ 1.5, so the bigger a ship it exponentially needs more
structure for a given accelleration limit.

The cost-effective solution is probably a whole slew of 10 000t Colonial
Transports - at 1 passenger per 2 displacement tons, how often are you
going to be moving 5 million people, anyway ?

  I had hopes for something interesting when I first saw the subject line
(I know, I should have learned by now, huh?).  But this post, before I got
to the unnnecessary referrence to a certain theorized entity, reminded me
of a high-tech philosophy I read of once.

I think it was in "Deathship of Antares."  A surprisingly readable little
sf book.
Basically, nasty bug warrior-caste-type aliens have a ship full of
prisoners.  The prisoners are kept in the hollow of a large ship.  Their
in microgravity, in orbit around some planet.  There\'s a honeycomb
structure along the walls of the hollowed out prisoner area.  Anyway . .
 New prisoner shows up.  And he brings his philosophy.  That philosophy is
bases on thermodynamics and electrical engineering, as far as I can tell.
The law of conservation of energy, etc.  Great stuff.  Wish I had it
around.  I\'ll see if I can find it, but don\'t get your hopes up.  Perhaps
some gearheads can derive it on their own.

Actually 1/3 of a billion isn\'t too far off.  According to Fernand Braudel
the world population in the mid 18th was around 5 to 600,000,000.  More
that 333,000,000, but not that much more.  It had also been rising since
the 16th century.  To world pop was relatively stable at around 1/3
billion from around 500 CE to 1400 CE (it rose during this time, but only
*very* slowly.

	What FFS2 calls low automation is not fully manual control.
	The XXIII (german U-Boat) had a crew of 12 and translates
	fine into 20 traveller displacement tons when submerged.
	The scout sized XXI had over 50 people. Thats what I would
	call fully manual control. The good thing on FFS2 automation
	levels is that its now posible to run a ship with a crew
	as in MT or in TNE based on design preferences. And that it
	could show that a major liner is running a 3000dt ship with
	the same number of crew as the poor trader uses for his
	200dt ship. This is similar to current sea vessels, as its
	posible to find 29.990 liners with a crew of 9 and coast
	rock\'n\'rollers of 999 tons with the same crew roaster.

     If memory serves, the PRC Army was still doing human wave attacks against

It takes an *astonishing* amount of energy to completely disrupt a
planet. So rather than an asteroid belt, you\'ll have some material
kicked to system escape velocity, and some kicked into solar orbits.
But most will not reach escape velocity for the planets remnants. Thus
the pieces will fall back in a quite short time (months at most). 

So you\'ll have run the planet thru a mixmaster, and killed everything
on it, but it\'ll still be there.

Remember, this is *millimeter* wavelength radar. So the holes are 12
times the wavelength. I\'m not sure how bad the diffraction effects
would be. 

And the foil coatings on windows (to help cut down on heat transfer)
that are becoming common will screw up attempts to go thru windows.

I think this is AWESOME!

Here\'s to hoping that the new publisher produces high quality products worthy of
the Traveller name.

I know I\'ll give it another try.

Hell, if someone can produce a 90% error free edition of T4 I\'ll buy it!  

Now the only problem is convicing the new publishers that they\'ll make a
product that\'ll sell well. Hire a GOOD layout guy and most of the problems
will be solved.

This is old news, the patient has been dead for many weeks, just waiting
around for the physicians to *officially* state the time of death. 

As for the causes of death, multiple gunshots to both feet, self inflected
gunshots to the head, multiple stab wounds to the dorsal vertebral
surfaces(back), billfold(wallet) explosion due to overloaded condition for
not paying authors, and suffocation due to cranial rectal inversion.<G>

	You meant "wouldn\'t be as bad" at which I too nearly spewed

managed to take the Airborne Laser out of the 747 (IIRC) platform
it\'s currently in, and sling it under fighters. And those damn tricky

	I don\'t recall putting any such limits into FF&S2. Yes, the table
doesn\'t go on to infinity, but that\'s a limitation imposed by
paper--which is why I also put in the equations used to create the
table. Eventually you run into limitations imposed by surface area,
but that\'s realistic.

	As for QSDS and SSDS stopping at 5,000Td, that\'s the direction the
original authors were given by IG. Neither was intended to be a
full-up design system, merely a "slap a quick role-players vessel"
together system.

Can you site a source for this?  This was a figure I had read in reference

I\'ve been really meaning to check it out.  My game store had it for a
little while, and then when I went to buy it, they didn\'t anymore...  I
better jump on it though, and try to order, in light of what Mr. Miller has

True enough.

My answer is no, you don\'t need a pilot and astrogator in addition to the
computer from a technological point of view.  From a role-playing point of
view, yes, you do need it so that the PCs can have the skills and use them.
 It seems the trouble is, trying to figure out the correct balance between
the two...  Something that I haven\'t worked out fully in my own head yet,
so I\'m not sure I want to go into too much detail and end up contradiciting
myself tomorrow.

Hmmm...

My feelings are strangely mixed on this.  I had a comment planned somewhere
in my head, but I\'ve lost the moment.

  You realize that the timing is sort of neat (besides being 04/01)?

  Australia is sleeping...

  Good luck to FFE.

There was a movie "Starflight One", in which also a person had to be
transported thorugh space - from an ill-fated post-modern plane to a space
shuttle - in a coffin. I rember, after the coffin got a hole, and the
aides got the man out alive nevertheless, they asked: What did you do?
He answered: I put my finger on the hole.

Sounds like a kind of Bowman\'s space walk without helmet ...

Other ones, heard on the radio short ago:

Some thiefs tried to rob a bank with a truck - they parked it backside to
the bank, tied the bankomat to it and drove off ... later they realized,
it was the statement printer instead ...

Another one, a soldier of the german army, robbed a bank, in uniform, but 
with a mask. As this army is conscientious about their uniforms, you could
read his name later on the video tape.

And then there were two thiefs who photgraphed themselves at work, but
threw away the polaroids \'cause they only showed black ...

That nearly got me up that morning, hadn\'t been the clocks set
to summertime a day ago ...

Thought I could get some inspirations for the \'Critical Vector\' adventure
for Traveller ... but on the other hand ...

The first part was nice, quite good action and sfx, the second one
reminded me of \'Earthquake\' and \'Poseidon Inferno\' and and and ...
In other words: the same people-struck-by-catastrophe-try-to-find-

I think \'Meteor\' was a far better Asteroids-hit-Earth spectacle, even as
its twenty years older. (What happens if such a stone hits water/snow/
ground/a city?)

I know what you mean. On of our TV Networks showed a movie nearly also as
bad, but as it was set in my home city, and our landmark was totally
destructed in a scene, I saw it for that one. (The SFX Man came from
Emmerich\'s \'Independence Day\', what else do I have to say?)

Maybe that\'s the point, why ID4 itself did not appeal that much to me.
Everything took place in the US. But I do not live in the US. Sorry.
