NP, dood.

Williams *also* came up with a couple other really cool books, \'Voice of the Whirlwind\' (I *THINK* that\'s the name of it) and \'Angel Station\'.  VotW was cyberpunk with star travel, though they didn\'t get into that too much.  The hero was an ex-grunt from a corporate SF unit called the Icehawks, troops trained in all kinds of nasty stuff *plus* some cut-down Zen.  \'Angel Station\' was about contact with a biological engineering species and its economic impacts on human technologies, the hero & his sister, the heroine, basically economically conquer space by getting exclusive rights to the alien technology.  Cute stuff, and definitely worth reading for ideas.  <grin>

It certainly *can* happen in the USA, and indeed did so rather recently,
about three miles from where I\'m sitting now.  You may have heard of the
case; it involved a rather well-known former football player, his ex-wife,
and her waiter friend.

I\'ll put in a vote for Gvegh.

I\'ve a hard time believing that any species other than the Droyne and the
Vilani would have ONE language.  

IMTU, and in my novels, most intelligent species have several languages.  
In my Terran Federation one of the biggest conflicts is between the whole
of the Federation and the mostly Japanese speaking Fringe, especially the
planet Shiratori which has as part of its constitution that it will NEVER
again be dependent upon another power for its self defense... the rivalry
between the Terran Starfleet and the Shiratori Self-Defense Force is quite
notorious. (Shiratori was one of the first Terran colonies that grew big
enough to have colonial worlds of its own.  Hiroaki Nomura remarks "I
sometimes find it hard to believe that all our ancestors came from eight
little islands on Earth."  To which his wife, Princess Justine
Wells-Ataniell, replies: "They didn\'t ALL, you know.")

Also the Khalanghaari, a neighboring humaniti empire, have conflicts
between speakers of three main language groups:  Khalinghaarin, Selkeren,
and Kam\'zari.

I once ran a Traveller campaign set in this universe.  It was a lot of
fun.  Hiroaki ended up serving in the Kam\'zari House of Ataniell fleet
after being publicly disavowed by Shougun Rensselaer in order to avert a
full-scale war between Shiratori and Terra at a strategically inopportune
time...

Hm... maybe I should try that again.  Would any of you local SF Bay Area
people play in a heretic TU?

	That\'s putting it rather kindly.  At one point in the
	videotape, Mr. King was down on his hands and knees
	while several police officers took turns hitting him
	with their batons.  No doubt, Mr. King is not a model

	trouble.

	There are those who argue that there were other
	considerations.  I cannot say what the jurors where
	thinking, but it is only fair to point out that the colour
	of Mr. King\'s skin may have been a factor.  Just how are
	off-worlders, let alone aliens, treated on planet?  I
	expect that backwater systems that are visited rarely, or
	poor worlds that may resent "rich outsiders," might be
	downright rude to the average PC.

	Would you then completely rule out the possibility that

IIRC, it\'s kind of a hybrid.  Book 4 is actually the best source for tech
detail on Nuclear Dampers.  It describes a system of two
variously-spaced-apart generator nodes which propogate overlapping damping
fields over a scalable area, but then use point defense fire control to
modulate interference & coincidence of the field waves, and thus focus the
resulting concentrated effect on specific targets such as fissionable
masses in enemy warheads, to either surpress or prematurely enhance [!] the
atomic processes therein.

Note that this is also similar to the described operation of the Ancient\'s
hand-held and planet-based disintegrators (described as a \'development\' of
damper tech) in Twilight\'s Peak...

This is particularly annoying when the problem with the electronics also
causes the death of three members of the frozen watch, near-death due to
vacuum exposure of another crewperson, and a poignant rendition of "Daisy,
Daisy" during the repair process.

From what I understand from 3rd parties, the people who wrote designs for 
Fighting Ships of the Shattered Imperium didn\'t pay much attention to the 
rules; therefore, some (many?) of the designs are badly flawed.

OTOH, I have absolutely no intention of using (and hence, designing)any 
warships greater than 10,000 dtons, so a lot of this discussion doesn\'t mean 
much for my campaign.

A generous and sadistic GM,

This reminds me of a book I read long ago... The radical conservationists
were trying to stop the megacorporations from damaging the environment
any more, and this ad copy writer got caught in the middle of it.
Apparently, despite the fact of a VERY high law level, some bloke
discovered that there were people who would commit crimes because they
_enjoy_ being beaten. He would get someone to commit a murder, and the
police would beat him to death upon capture, and he would laugh the whole
time.

Of course, since praying "toward" Mecca even on Earth involves praying
along the great circle leading there (you don\'t stand on your head if
you\'re 170 degrees away, in other words), one would probably see the same
sort of practical correction applied here.  You\'d aim for the point on the
horizon directly above or below the current location of Sol in the sky.

A complication here is that mosques are often built (on Terra) so that
their orientation naturally focuses on the direction of Mecca.  The Saudi
embassy in Washington DC is a lovely example; it has a sort of outer
curtain wall which is aligned with the street and adjoining lots, but the
building inside (which includes a mosque) is rotated about 30 degrees so
that the front doors are pointed at Mecca.  Makes for a rather striking
effect.

Needless to say, this couldn\'t be done if the direction to Mecca changed
on a daily cycle.  This alone might lead to most \'mainstream\' Muslims
accepting a compromise in which some on-planet location -- first landing
point, first mosque constructed, location of a shard of the Kaaba -- is
taken as "local Mecca" for prayer purposes.  Of course, there would be
ultra-orthodox Muslims who insist on praying toward Mecca itself.  They
would thus do the five daily prayers in five directions, spinning through
a circle each day.  I might imagine their picking up the nickname
"Dervishes" for this.

It may not be long (on historical timescales) before real-world Moslems
need to face part of this issue.  On the Moon, the direction to Mecca from
any point on the surface is fixed (plus or minus about three degrees,
which is fairly neglibile.  However, the daily cycle of prayer would pose
a problem.  Do you pray five times over the lunar day, or the terran?  If
the latter, do you do it by Mecca time, or GMT, or whatever time is being
kept in the base?  With the latter two, how do you decide what latitude\'s
sunrise and sunset to use?

I would imagine that there would arise a fatwah for this, like "toward the
bow".  Again, there would be dissenters.

Some Moslem countries use a calculated new moon standard today.  In fact,
one of the elements of the BCCI banking scandal a few years back involved
a scheme that went awry because of differences on this issue.  I don\'t
remember the specific countries involved, but both were to end a banking
holiday at hilal, the next sighting of the new moon.  Country A used
calculation, and ended the holiday on the predicted date.  Country B used
observation, and its official observers failed to spot the moon and
extended the holiday one day.  As a result, a key transaction failed to go
through between the two countries, causing a ripple of unmade payments
which led to exposure of (that part of) BCCI\'s machinations.

ObTrav should be clear... :)

No, actually it\'s just a developing idea that me and Robert have discussed.
I\'m trying to develop my next Traveller game, and I\'ve asked a couple of
questions to the list (the fuel-less jump drive thread having garnered the
most responses). Roberts been very helpful to me in generating ideas on the
setting at large.

In brief, it\'s space opera/science fantasy pure and simple, with a huge
dose of Fading Suns-style neogothicisim, using the Imperium as a backdrop.
Originally it was going to be set in the Rebellion era, but it\'s starting
to develop into a post-rebellion, post-hard times setting.

As part of the flavor, I wanted jump drives that didn\'t use huge amounts of
jump fuel. I also am going to have a lot of Ancient relics laying about,
including some huge jump gates that allow transit from certain strategic
sytems to others.

Other elements include a lot of ignorance of technology, a religious
revival in the form of a Universal Church, psionics,
things-man-was-not-meant-to-know, secret societies, and other phenomena
strange and mysterious.

I was thinking about calling the setting _Dark Imperium_ or some such thing.

The only stuff I have up on a webpage that\'s Traveller-related are some
things that I did for my *last* game, which was also space opera, but with
a Star Wars flavor (and using the SW-RPG rules). Alas, it was all hand
written, so transcribing it to the \'Net has been a pain. So far, the only
stuff up is a lot of statistics (some vehicles, weapons and armor, sensor
rules) -- MT stuff converted to SW-RPG terms.

If anyone is interested, it\'s at:

http://www.evansville.net/~yikes/joespace.html

There be some FUDGE material there too, as well as a very small amount of
other stuff.

_The Space Merchants_, by Frederik Pohl and C.M. Kornbluth.  IMHO, it\'s
much better than the sequel, _The Merchants\' War_.

Either can be used as an idea-mine for a dystopic Government Type 1
(company/corporation) society.

I think it was a given in the King situation that the officers did not

(Aside: I have never been a police officer. I do not know what conditions

exactly what actions the officers did that *were* in violation of department
policy and/or the law, if any. I was, of course, shocked by the video,
as the tv news show intended me to be, but my being shocked by the
actions of police officers does not, in and of itself, provide proof of
wrongdoing by said police officers.)

In our legal system, it should not ever be what a government official
*thinks* - it should always be what he can, in the spirit and the letter
of the law, *prove*.

The appearance was of multiple attempts to "get" the officers, 
a semblance of legal maneuvering to avoid the protections against
double jeapardy. The Feds did not push for an appeal, therefore they
must have seen no *legal* grounds for overturning the court\'s decision.
In absence of such grounds, they attempted to trump the decision
instead with the somewhat nebulous civil rights charges.

If the feds had gone after the California court system, that would
have been one thing - but no process of that sort came of the affair.
Evidently, the feds do not think the California court system is broken
*unless* it suits their purposes to disagree with a particular verdict - and 
they then acted (via the civil rights charges) to trump the decision of said 
court with respect to that verdict only.

Either of which, in most situations, will be directly represented 
by a Traveller social standing. Money, or course, is the simplest
way (through spending) for a character to raise social standing.
Most character generation systems have allowances to modify social 
standing by the race of the character involved - for example, the Vargr 
Charisma system, or the Zhodani mageocracy system.

Yes, I know that wasn\'t the "race" you were talking about.

This has some danger of getting seriously out of hand - some people
thought the Rodney King verdict important enough to perform assault,
arson and rioting over. I\'d rather not bring that kind of devastation to
the TML, so I\'d like to move this to private email as soon as others
think appropriate, if others would like to continue this at all.

I *think* that\'s all the traveller articles printed in dragon, at least
according to the index in dragon 112, plus what I can remember off hand.

I\'ve listed them by issue, as the browser sucks badly and it\'s simpler
to look up the issue and open the pdf.

note that from about issue 70-something to 112 all the traveller
articles are in the Ares section so you need to look there first.

And just to reopen the copyright flame war does anyone know what the
policy on reproducing articles is? Once apon a time it was TSR policy
allow people to reproduce articles for a friend ( only articles - you
couldn\'t copy the whole magazine ) as long as you didn\'t charge for
them.
Does this apply to the CD-rom?

Regardless of that fact, the highest armor value on the MT chart is 120,
which translates to something like 32,400 cm of hard steel (I don\'t have
the book in front of me, but it\'s somewhere close). The BBs make use of the
highest armor value available.

Hugely armored ships don\'t suffer performance problems in MT because mass
doesn\'t figure into manuever drive calculations in the vehicle construction
system. It was all based on *volume* (as in High Guard). You allocate a
certain number of manuever drive units per volume tonnage of the ship, and
you can get 6G acceleration, regardless of whether the ship is a svelt
fighterboat or a lumbering armored dreadnaught from hell.

So even if they paid attention to the rules the designs would be flawed,
because the rules themselves were flawed.

Still, your right. It\'s MegaErrata.

However, I think the ship illos look cool (big fan of Roger Raupp here) --
for the most part much better than Fighting Ships, IMHO. And there is a
much wider variety of vessels than in FS. I thought there might be some
passing interest in GT versions of front-line cap ships therein. And I was
home sick and bored. ;-)

I simply can\'t wait for GT: Starships. <salivating>

The Chinese are one of the reasons you didn\'t grow up
speaking Japanese down there.  The Communists and the
Nationalists stopped fighting each other with guns
(but kept up the propanganda war) and kept a lot of
Japanese forces occupied that would have been used
elsewhere.  

(Of course, the Chinese didn\'t affect the sea war
directly very much, so you can thank my father (U.S.
Merchant Marine veteran) and your own for protecting
Australia from the Japanese invasion.)

The Taiping Rebellion started when secretaries and
clerks rose up to fight against Chinese rulers who had
been selling out China to Europe and Japan.  I suspect
that these typists also wanted to go back to
calligraphy.  [Sound of hatch slamming.]

That\'s directly contrary to what I learned as ahistory
major.  

First, what\'s the difference?  Where does the fact end
and the interpretation begin?  

Is it a fact or is it interpretation that the
Communists had X million men under arms, and the
Nationalists had Y million?  Choosing where to draw
the line for defining "under arms" is a question of
interpretation -- or is it?  What if each political
entity had its own definition of under arms?  Does
that make it more of a fact or more interpretation?

Second, facts by themselves don\'t provide anything
useful.  Facts are automatically interpreted to form
an understanding.  If the reporter of the facts does
not interpret them viva voce, he or she is actually
interpreting them sub silentio through arrangement and
presentation -- and the reader is doing the same
thing.  That\'s why historians typically state their
theses first -- "this paper seeks to show that the
Communists hindered the Japanese more than the
Nationalists did".  Full disclosure reminds the reader
read the facts and interpretations critically.

Third, one of the major functions of history is to
remember what happened; one professor called us
"society\'s professional rememberers."  We as humans
don\'t remember raw facts, or if we do, we don\'t
usually apply them well.  We remember stories.  It
seems that we\'re almost hard-wired to do that.

  The UK fielded units that they (& other Euro professionals) would 
have called heavy cavalry, although they didn\'t try body armour like
the French cuirassiers.

While I agree that historians must interpret, they must show that their
interpretation logically and justifiably follows from the facts. There has 
been considerable danger, at least lately in the United States, that
historians and other social scientists will start with the interpretation and
*then* start putting the facts together, with predictable results.

And the difference between a club and a cricket-bat is...? Or have they

How much predictability is possible, given the
distances involved?  Local Imperial officials have a
lot of power and discretion.  Only really important
issues will be addressed at higher levels.  The result
is that there may be significant differences in
different regions, which will be tolerated or
eventually changed.

I think we actually agree.  There is some amount of
arbitrary rule in the Imperium, but it is tempered by
consideration of the needs of the Imperium.

Well, you Vikings invented that whole wergild concept

happen here, and it recently did in that case about
the Hertz commercial guy who was acquitted of killing
his ex-wife.

That\'s not too far from real world experience. 
Deciding in which court to proceed is often an issue
for lawyers in the United States.

Well, yes, I grew up in AMERICA, where (like in the 3I) racism is

of PRACTICAL NECESSITY. I realize that other countries are not as
progressive as OURS.

Erm.  Well, pardon the pun, but typing hadn\'t reached the benighted shores
of the West, much less China, in the 1850s, so I don\'t know that\'s quite
on the mark.  I also don\'t know how much the driving social force behind
the Taipings can be described as secretaries and clerks.

Succumbing to the odious habit of lame ObTrav closures:  There\'s a newish
(1997?) book by Jonathan Spence called _God\'s Chinese Son_ on the
Taipings, which, like all Spence\'s stuff, is meticulous history written
with great style and eminently accessible to non-specialists.  I strongly
recommend it; it\'s loaded with vignettes & seeds for Trav (and other RPG)
needs.

Gvegh would seem to be the choice.

The Droyne actually don\'t have one language.  Language varies from
planet to planet (Oytrip to Oytrip?).  They do have a liturgical language
(Oynprith) in common (much like Latin in Europe few centuries back).  It
could probably doulb as a trade language if Droyne from different planets
interacted more.

The Aslan have one language not because (acccording to my understanding)
they don\'t suffer the same sort of linguistic drift others do, but becasue
have specifically worked to counter it and keep it their traditional
language.

In one of the Fuzzy books, there was a remark to the effect that
you could find a precedent for _anything_ in Colonial law.  Some
examples that I recall:

In the Fuzzy trial (People of the Colony of Zarathustra v.
Holloway and Kellogg), after Kellogg committed suicide, Leslie
Coombs, Kellogg\'s lawyer (and the legal counsel for the Chartered
Zarathustra Company) made a statement to the effect "You can\'t go
through the farce of trying a dead man", and Holloway\'s lawyer,
Gus Brannhard, immediately came up with a precedent for doing
just that.

Also, the issue of sapience = talk-and-build-a-fire as an
identity was knocked down on the basis of another precedent in
Colonial law, an infanticide case.  The defense argument in that
case was that murder was defined as the deliberate killing of a
sapient being; a sapient being is one that can talk and build a
fire; a human infant can do neither; therefore, a human infant is
not sapient, and therefore cannot be murdered.  This case
established that T&BaF is proof-positive, but an apparent
inability is not proof-contrary.

Have at it, folks; your pet legal theories no doubt have _some_
examples - both for and against - _somewhere_ in the Eleven
Thousand Worlds...

I see the distance problem as pushing _toward_ the rule of
law.  It is law that unites and provides a common basis.
Given how much local authority distance requires, I think
they will be keen on tempering that with law so that it is
restricted to reasonable discressionary policy areas rather
than becoming absolute fiat.

  AFAIK, MT uses Striker\'s armour charts unchanged, so (120-80=40; 40/8 =
5 doublings = x32) your DR 30K cruiser means that your looking at a DR 1 M
BB. Which is still absurd for GT, but if you then have to use a mass-based
design system you\'ll have to compromise on both armour and Agility-6. Just
make it tough, and it\'ll still be a BB-15.

They do, and you\'ve got the basic facts right, but the
interpretation wrong - in the Court of Political Justice, the
question that they are trying to decide is not whether the
accused took the actions in question, but whether such actions
were in excess of what was deserved.  IOW, he wasn\'t Not Guilty
of Murder, he was Not Guilty of Giving the Politician What-For In
Excess of What That Damn Politician Deserved.

(I cribbed _very_ liberally from that book - which I had just
read for the n!th time - when I wrote up Nutema for the RICE
Archives.)

I vote for Gvegh, the Vargr language most encountered

Want to make a bet? Rotating buildings are *not* that hard to make. And
it\'d not only make for a striking effect, it\'d allow the architect to
play all sorts of games with light and shadow, since he could be
*certain* that all possible facings would be exposed to all possible
inclinations of the "sun" sooner or later.

Heck, you\'ve got the same problem in orbit. The sun rises and sets once
each orbit. That\'s why I asked if anyone knew what the Saudi on the
Shuttle mission a few years back did. 

I *do* recall that he was pleased to be the first to observe the new
moon, even though it only affected him.

And Moslems on a Lunar base will have to hope that there\'s *some*
natural feature visible from the base that will light up or go dark at
the moment of new moon. Or else they\'ll have to go for the harder to
detect "full earth".

Actually the "gear" I was thinking of *was* the M-1. Between the IR
gear and the ability of the main gun to score kills *thru* the berms
that Iraqi tanks tried to use as cover, it must have been one hell of a
shock.

Contracts of adhesion aren\'t worth the paper they are printed on. And
in fact, many of them, like Microsoft\'s, tend to violate the law in
other ways (such as copyright law, which grants rights that are not
negotiable to the purchaser of a copyrighted work, said rights typical
being "denied" by the "license").

Their *sole* purpose is to discourage buyers from trying to claim their
*actual* legal rights, and thus save MS a lot of legal fees. 

Also, MS *cannot* use a contract to wiggle out of *deliberate* damage
caused by their software.

Again, the shrinkware license is *not* a valid contract, in that
there\'s *no* way to negotiate it. Ask a lawyer about "contracts of
adhesion". It takes a small miracle to get them upheld. That\'s why the
software companies tried to get a law passed that *made* shrinkwrap
licenses legally binding. They got it passed in Louisana, but last I\'d
heard it\'d been ruled against in court decisions.

And as I recall, that decision I referred to earlier *does* say that
the programmer *is* responsible for damages his software *deliberately*
causes, even if the "trigger" for the damage is an illegal act on the
part of the person using the software. 

In the case in question the "illegal act" was continuing to use the
software without paying for it. And that\'s *exactly* what would be
going on in our hypothetical scenario with MS servers.

I\'d suggest checking out a few of the "classic" generation ship
stories. Heinlein\'s "Orphans of the Sky" has a generation ship that has
descended into barbarism after a mutiny among the crew killed too many
people. 

Then there\'s Brian Aldiss\'s "Starship" where we have another generation
ship where things have gone badly wrong. Though it takes a while to
realize that\'s the setting. In this case, they are on the way *back*
from a coplonizing trip that didn\'t work out. And things have gone
wrong because of something they picked up.

Oh yeah, I knew there was at least one more! Delany\'s "The Ballad of
Beta 2" (this and "Babel-17" are Delany books for people who don\'t like
his better known books). It\'s pretty short, but it deals with a culture
on generation ships as well. It\'s got a sort of "anthropologist" doing
a followup to an earlier "cultural survey" of the culture on a fleet
fleet of generation ships that had been discovered many, many years
back in orbit around a star that wasn\'t theor original destination.
It\'s got nice touches such as vocabulary shifts as succeeding
generations found new uses for words that didn\'t have a referent in
their "world" ("sand" was what they called interstellar high radiation
areas, being mostly in low g or no g "arms" shifted to mean "limb", and
"sore feet" was a term describing the way they felt in a normal g area.

There\'s another one that I can\'t recall the author of. It\'s got a
pseudo Aztec culture living in a mountain valley. And then our hero
decides to break the taboos and go exploring. He climbs the monutains
and finds that they touch the sky! Turns out the "valley" is the inside
of a generation ship. I can\'t recall why the passengers were handled
that way.

That\'s correct:  There were no legal grounds for
overturning the trial court\'s decision, which was a
jury verdict for acquittal.  The government can never
appeal from an acquittal after trial.  The result of
winning such an appeal would be a new trial over the
same crime:  that is, double jeopardy.

Double jeopardy, as understood in the United States,
has always meant that the government cannot try a
defendant twice for the same crime, and the doctrine
has always recognized that more than one government
with prosecution power exists.  That is, the federal
government and each state\'s government (if it has
jurisdiction) can prosecute the same defendant for the
same crime.

And, alas, few people who have *only* seen the movie know what the real
malfunction was. As was (not very well) explained in the movie version
of 2010, the problem was that security concious idiots told HAL that
under no circumstances could he reveal the *real* mission to the crew
until they arrived at Jupiter. And at the same time they told him the
mission *must* accomplish its goal. 

The natural result was that at some point these hidden instructions led
to a conflict because he *couldn\'t* tell the crew *why* they couldn\'t
change plans, but he couldn\'t let them change plans either.

It doesn\'t matter *what* they thought. The offficers had been acquiited
in a court of law. And legally, that made them immune for *any*
prosecution for the *actions* involved. Not merely the crime that they
were tried for, but for any other crime that that set of actions might
fall under.

That\'s the whole *basis* for "double jeopardy". The British
government\'s habit of retrying people on different charges for the same
*act* until they got a conviction is one of the things that led to the
American Revolution.

Heck, just have one without the double jeopardy rule. Strict or loose.
(Strict "no retrial for the same *act* once acquitted", loose "no
retrial for the same *charge*")

That second one ought to surprise the heck out of players.

"But they already tried him on that charge and found him innocent!"
"Yes, but the government decided that a retrial was in order. Perfectly
legal...."

Interestingly enough, as impressive as coalition air power was, last I heard

Agreed.  Of course, that\'s inextricably intertwined
with presentation of the facts.

(1) "at least lately in the United States":  The
danger has been long recognized.  Herodotus himself is
called both the father of history and the father of
lying.  

(2) No one is a blank slate.  The faceless historians
and social scientists you mention studied history and
have read a lot of interpretations and facts and
developed their rhetorical and analytical skills.  The
process of producing historical work ordinarily starts
with choosing a subject with which the historian has
some familiarity, and therefore also some
preconceptions.  To work in a totally unfamiliar area
is generally not an efficient use of one\'s time.  

The next part is research, which may challenge those
preconceptions.  In fact, research is a constant
process of interpreting what you\'re seeing and trying
to fit it into context or changing the context -- the
preconceptions -- so that the facts found in research
can be explained.

Although it\'s important that we treat minor races with compassion and
patience, the sad fact is that they just don\'t have the natural capacities
that we do for progress and development.  In fact, they\'re a drag on the
technological advancement of the Third Imperium.  Fortunately, our
adaptive superiority lets us kill \'em real good.  And what can be more
moral than PROVEN RESULTS?

That\'s true for NT 4.0 server as well.  (And also for Novell, and most

That\'s been erratad (I think...)  Total Surface area should be body+

take 1 (for the mounting hardware).

Actually, the constitution uses "People" to mean "States" any number of 
times.  That\'s the basis for the Supreme Court decision saying that the 2nd 
applies to National Guard units....  Not that I agree with them....

<* chuckle *>.  When I was doing the playtest for _First In_ someone hit
me in the face with the fact that no, a type X starport and Red Zone status
are not necessarily logically equivalent.  I\'d been assuming that as a
Traveller "given" for, well, almost 20 years. . .

Actually, if you think about it doing the hydrographics with atmosphere
rather than size is *close*, since atmosphere itself tends to track size.
The major effect is that you\'ll get extreme results more frequently.
Toward the mean the distribution probably feels about the same.

That\'s a misstatement of the law.  Acquittal by a
California court immunizes them from prosecution by
California for the same acts.  It does not immunize
them from prosecution by another sovereign entity with
jurisdiction -- in this case, the United States of
America.

For larger lifeforms, speciation should take in the tens or hundreds of thousands of years, less significant changes would occur faster.  It\'s pretty unlikely that a generation ship would remain viable anywhere near that long, however.

Is it true that Mr. King was hopped up on PCP at the time? Or is that
just an urban myth that arose after the fact? (If it\'s true, it would
explain the actions of the officers... something that would not be
evident from the videotape...)  :-/

And *that* reminds me of a bit from the DC Comics miniseries The Watchmen.
In the scene, two retired superheroes are talking about old times...

"Oh, you mean Captain Carnage." (Laughs.) "He was one for the books."

IMTU, the Scout Service has an ultra-covert intelligence service called
The Rangers, who use mundane Scout activities as their cover. As far as
most people are concerned, they\'re just scouts. A few might learn that
they\'re part of the IISS\' Intelligence Branch. But a very select few 
know the truth: they\'re part of a group that is secret enough that even
most IISS Intelligence Branch members don\'t know it exists.

The reason it exists IMTU is that the player characters are members of
this elite service. Their being Scouts gives them cover to travel around
the sector without being particularly noticed; being Intelligence agents
gives them their adventures...

Other agencies that probably exist IMTU include IRIS and ISIS and IBIS
and the other usual groups. I have an adventure planned where the PCs
will have to deal with the operatives of one of these services who are
working at cross-purposes with what the PCs are trying to do, each group
not wanting to reveal who they really are to the other... :)

Oz is a funny old place... We get the "best" of both worlds, though
predominantly British slang;
  Knocked-up: Either tired (after a hard work-out, run, manual labour) or
being preggers (pregnant)
  Fanny: Works both ways, depending on whom you are talking to... either
backside (errrr... bum) or a woman\'s front bottom.  I have never heard of a
man having a fanny as part of his anatomy for some reason... so perhaps it\'s
also gender specific?
  Aussies have "Condoms"... it\'s in the adverts and on the wrappers.
However, we know of the term "rubber" and apply it in humorous fashion
whenever we wish to be difficult (the old, "Can I borrow your rubber?"
question can have a mile made from it if you consider what might be returned
if the rubber borrowed was a condom!).
  Those little board mates that you place under a beverage to either sop the
moisture from a cold drink, or protect a table from the heat of a hot one,
are called "drink coasters" or just "coaster" (those things you put under
the chairs of a lounge/couch to protect the carpet are also coasters) in
Aussie, I believe they are "drink mats" in the U.K.... don\'t know what they
are in the US?

ObTrav: Dirtside performing routine maintenance, the Engineer calls the town
party to "Grab a set of \'coasters\' for the vertical slide flange, these ones
are shot!" (Coasters being a pair of small rubber rings).  The steward, part
of the town party knows coasters are a type of glass cocktail drinking
containers, but is cosmopolitan enough to guess that the engineer is
speaking about some kind of glass cups for the flange-thingie and rocks on
down to the ship\'s engineering supply store and tells the clerk what he
needs... only to be given a set of expensive,
non-refundable/non-exchangeable star ship grade gaskets and being assured
that this is what the engineer must be talking about as they are clearly
labelled "AG-4818567 Coasters, Starship Grade, Type-B"...

Oh yeah... in Aussie too, we can also be "knocked-up in the morning" to be
awakened...

How about the one about Stewart Wagstaff (an early Aussie TV personality
from when Australia started broadcasting) on a visit to the U.S., in a bar
with another Aussie actor who, when on his way to the toilet shouted back
over his shoulder, "Be back in a minute, just going to the toilet and
lighting up a fag..."  A fag being slang for a cigarette at that time (and
still in use now), the term was seen as quite something different by the
U.S. locals and the pair got chucked out of the bar, being accused of being
a pair of horses hoofs!!!!!

A 5x CD (as far as I know)Windows only CD-ROM set.  Aussie coin... $130.00.
The first 250 magazines reproduced in their entirety (ads, rules, comments,
images, the lot... including the forerunner "Stratigic Revue" magazines).
Worth every cent if you are into that sort of thing... which also had some
cool sci-fi articles in the earlier issues, including CT articles.

I think it\'s controversial because it\'s not a favourite game system (like

Just drunk, IIRC.  Thing is, his \'rap sheet\', which would have been transmitted to the officers involved, included a conviction of assault with intent to kill on a police officer.

Hmm... I use IMOJ Special Research Office, the Scout Contact office, INIS
(ImpNavInt), IRIS, The various megacorporate intell services (Especially
the vemene), and the "Imperial Special Force" (note the singular, not a
typo). All of them send at least some info up to the IMI... and the IMI is
much like Barrayaran ImpSec... and is a parrallel organization.

ISF is a cadre of 100 of the best and brightest of each sector\'s various
local, and imperial, operatives. With no prerequisite prior service other
than completion of 4 years creditable imperial service (They have to be
citizens), a bar on nobility, and huge expense allowances. Imperial
Warrants (Of the get out of jail free variety) are standard issue on
missions. Anagathics (The very best and purest) are standard, usually via
implanted "Leak Tubes" (ala norplant). Typically issued denable weapons,
little to no support in the field, and given "Nail missions", they spend
months training. Note:  that\'s 100 per sector... They also tend to travel
via low berth aboard naval craft a lot... typical careers are not chosen as
much for performance of the job they did, but for extremes of creativity,
loyalty, and perseverance. A noble goes anti-imperial, and hides out
leading a guerilla war, ISF snatches him... usually with 2-4 man ops teams.
The 1st 4 years of an ISF op\'s life are spent training, suffering
psycho-conditioning, and if trainable, learning psionics. The next 20 to 50
years are spent doing the odd jobs... usually about 1 per year per agent.

>Actually, it depends on your sources.  First of all, area effect dampers
_are_ possible in FF&S, they just don\'t cover enough area to help against
detlasers and so aren\'t used much (and have really vague rules, which
doesn\'t help).  Second, I don\'t recall CT ever specifying how they worked,
but they seemed to be a single large system onboard a warship, which
suggested they probably were area dampers.

"Nuclear Dampers: A common term, damper units actually may be used to
increase or decrease the stability of atomic nuclei. Projecting from two
separate stations, the intersection of the two transmitted broadcasts
produces a series of nodes and anti-nodes. In the area of the nodes, the
strong nuclear force is enhanced, making the nucleus more stable. In the
area of the anti-nodes, the strong nuclear force is depressed, making the
nucleus much less stable. Anti-nodes are focused on incoming nuclear
warheads, causing them to shed neutrons at low energy levels, rendering the
warhead inoperable. The range of the damper field is proportional to the
distance separating the two projectors. At tech level 13, the ratio is
100:1 (thus a separation of 50 meters would yield a range of 5 kilometers).
At tech level 14 and above, the ratio is 1000:1. ... Small damper field
units are available to transport fissionable material with a short half
life both to lengthen the half life and reduce radiation. Such units focus
nodes on the material carried... The damper is later developed into a
disintegrator weapon, beginning at tech level 16."

Book 4 (Mercenary), p. 42.

"Nuclear dampers are used to prevent nuclear reactions by enhancing the
strong nuclear force, and making atomic nuclei more stable. Dampers must be
focused on incoming missiles, and depend on an integral fire control system
for efficiency."

Book 5 (High Guard), 1st Ed., p. 28. Note that this contradicts the first
entry on whether nodes or anti-nodes are used, but the focusing requirement
is the same. The following may be a correction:

"Nuclear Dampers suppress nuclear reactions. Dampers are focused on
incoming nuclear missiles and use an integral fire control system for
efficiency."

Book 5 (High Guard), 2d Ed. (extract), JTAS p. 23.

"Nuclear dampers are capable of projecting a field which suppresses the
strong nuclear force, which causes nuclear warheads to decay rapidly and
renders them harmless; the projector must focus on a warhead for only a
fraction of a second. Dampers function as point defense weapons against
nuclear rounds only."

Striker, Book 2 (Advanced Rules), p. 11.

"Radiation Suppression: Another use of nuclear dampers is to eliminate the
radioactive contamination created by a nuclear weapon detonation. Instead
of performing its usual missions, a damper may be assigned to eliminate the
radiation from one [tactical] nuclear strike per [15 second] fire phase.
Both the crater and the area of induced radiation are rendered permanently
harmless."

Ibid., p. 12.

"Damper technology is one of the two major postulated scientific
breakthroughs. It assumes that a deeper understanding of the strong nuclear
force will allow us to manipulate it. Nuclear damper units create an
interference field in the force. Point defense dampers focus a negative
node on incoming nuclear warheads, lowering the potential barriers around
the nucleus; the warhead will shed neutrons at very low energies and be
rendered harmless after a very short exposure. Damper boxes, on the other
hand, focus a positive node on their contents, raising the potential
barrier and preventing nuclear decay."

Striker, Book 3 (Equipment), pp. 4-5.

Sorry for the exhaustive treatment, but we may as well be clear on what was
said on the subject. There _is_ an area of effect in CT, but small enough
to encompass only one missile at a time. The time required to render a
warhead harmless is short enough that many engagements are possible, but
GURPS targeting and skill rules make them significantly less than 100%
effective (which the current area effect dampers are).

That\'s correct. If that\'s not the source of the error, I can\'t say why your
figures are different without reverse-engineering both versions.

You\'d have to ask David Pulver, or I\'ll ask him when I get a chance. I
think he felt it was a better approximation of Traveller that way --
weapons in streamlined turrets also ignore that rule -- but I couldn\'t say
for sure.

An abstraction, to prevent having to calculate just how big the hole in the
hull is. VE2 treats all superstructures this way, including wings, arms and
legs, wheels, etc.

>Another question: What are good ballpark figures for warship armor? 

Are you aware that there has been a change to the way damage is calculated
for beam weapons 1-Gj and over? Damage now increases as 10*(Output
energy)^1/3, instead of (Output energy)^1/2. Your damage figures are
probably high, therefore.

With that in mind, here are the armor guidelines I proposed for GT:
Imperial Navy. Since the authors haven\'t complained, I infer that they have
been accepted. They were designed mostly for playability, but also on the
theory that the Imperial Navy Ship Board (or whoever) wouldn\'t pay for
designs that were clearly over-armored for their intended mission. I\'ve
made no attempt whatever to relate these values to previous version in a
quantitative fashion.

"Turrets for all types should have a minimum DR 100 and maximum DR of 500
at TL8, doubled every TL thereafter, or 1/2 the armor of the ship,
whichever is less. Note that this is upward of 96 *stons* of armor per turret.

"Scouts, escorts, and auxiliaries should be resistant to turret weapons:
minimum armor DR 100, maximum DR 1,000 at TL8, doubled every TL thereafter.
These ships may or may not carry nuclear dampers or meson screens (in the
same range of DR), depending on their role and TL. Auxiliaries converted
from civilian use will have the minimum armor possible, to save weight and
money.

"Cruisers and carriers should carry nuclear dampers and be immune to turret
weapons and resistant to bay weapons: minimum DR 6,000, maximum DR 10,000
at TL8, plus DR 3,000 (min)/5,000 (max) per TL thereafter, both armor and
meson screens.

"Battleships and battleriders should carry nuclear dampers and may have
black globe forcefields (if available). Their armor and meson screens
should be immune to bay weapons and resistant to spinal mounts: minimum DR
10,000 at TL 8, plus DR 5,000 per TL thereafter; absolute maximum DR
80,000. Fleet tenders are generally constructed as dispersed hulls, and so
effectively cannot be armored."

I don\'t there were any drugs involved except the traditional central 
nervous system depressant, booze, and in large quanities.

The famous video tape started after he shrugged off several shots by 
tasers, and had gotten up after being put down to the ground several 
times.  Mr. King was feeling no pain.

The officers were a *bit* enthusiastic in their attempts to keep Mr. King 
on the ground so they could cuff him.

The only thing that probably keep them from shooting him in the legs a few 
times was the boatloads of paperwork they would have to fill out if they 
drew their firearms.

Ob-Trav is left as an exercise for the sadistic GM.

IIRC Oynprith is used as a ceremonial language, which is why it hasn\'t
changed at all in 50,000 years. I forget if it is directly stated anywhere,
but at least by implication the languages in daily use on different Droyne
worlds are as different as any. That, at least, was what we assumed when
we wrote up the Droyne of Askoapoy for the Pocket Empires project.

As for the Vilani, they have a language called Old High Vilani that functions
just as Latin functioned for Europe in the Middle Ages. Again by implication,
different descendants are in use by different Vilani groups.

Correct me if I\'m wrong but T4 thrusters were only good REALATIVELY close in
a gravity well. If you jump between stars to an area near a slowmover than
you won\'t be able to manuver, much less accellerate to catch a ship moving
at even a small portion of light speed.

Seems you\'d need a specailly equipt ship. Say with LARGE fule cappacity and
HEPLAR to perform this. THis would speak of knowing the ship is there before
equiping  such an expedition. That or catching them as they began to enters

No, I wasn\'t aware of this. This isn\'t in the GV 2ed errata, is it? Sheesh,

In my book it\'s:

Is "^1/2" and ASCII way of writing a square root?

The TravCult, nee TravLang, list has taken a slightly different approach.
Our premise is that "Modern Vilani" is a standardized language that since
the early 3I has been replacing Vilani vernaculars descended from
Classical Vilani.  Old High Vilani is considerably deader and more
inaccessible.  Perhaps, sticking with the European analogue, OHV was Greek
in medieval Europe: known, but only by a few, and used only for reading
received texts, not for composition or communication.

Just think big men (when 6\'2" was considered very tall, and you had to be 
taller to join a heavy cavalry regiment than the Grenadier Guards) on big 
horses (to carry the weight). The idea is that heavy horse was more efficient 
in their role as battlefield shock troops. I read an excellent analogy of 
this in Charles Grant\'s book on Fontenoy. He said a typical trooper\'s horse 
back then was the size of a kettle drum horse today (a lot closer to the 
Medieval Great Horse). Heavy cavalry was incredibly expensive to buy, train 
and maintain. This was part of the reason you never saw them on our side of 
the pond (and the ridiculous cost to ship them across the Atlantic, and the 
fact the topography was totally unsuited to the employment of large numbers 
of cavalry). Ironically by the Civil War (US) there was much more "Cavalry 
country" (low rolling hills that have been deforested) due to development but 
Cavalry doctrine was in the midst of serious doctrinal change (who the h---- 
wants to charge Spencers?).

Ob S1889: Mars appears to have excellent topography for Cavalry, though the 
logistics would mean a lot more Gashants, since horses are very water 
intensive animals. Did the Martians breed different size Gashants for 
different roles (heavy cavalry, light cavalry, gun teams, etc.)?

Well, as combat rounds are 20 minutes in GT, you could get quite a 
few shots off in that time.  Considering it only takes a fraction of a 
second to disable a warhead, that\'s more than 1200 nukes a 
combat round.  What that fraction is, I don\'t know.

And assuming that PD fire is at +10, I would think you had a good 
chance of taking out that many nukes.  You are practically going to 
be at Point Blank range because the dampers get too huge to break 
the 10,000 mile hex range.

Of course, there are no rules for aiming, targeting, etc.  But if 
someone were desperate enough, he could come up with some 
targeting rules similiar to energy weapons. I would treat them as 
laser turrets but with a much higher accuracy and targeting 
capability; you don\'t have to move a turret ... just deflect a beam 
(technology *we* have had since the 60s).  For range, I would make 
it the max range of the damper ... it either works or it don\'t.

So, with a handwave, I would assume that since you can 
"theoretically" target over 1200 nukes a round, and the aiming is 
much more precise than that of turret weapons, the Nuclear Damper 
is a Field Effect that encases the ship and just be done with it and 
only worry about individual warheads very rarely.

However, one sticking point ... as the range of the damper is 
*significantly* shorter than the ranges usually dealt with in a 20 
minute combat round, the number of possible intercepts are 
probably going to be substantially reduced, too.  So lets look at the 
requirements:

Any weapon can be used for point defense.  Lasers can only take 
out one missile per turn for Point Def purposes.  I propose because 
it can only shoot once per minute and once it has shot, the range the 
rest of the missiles have to travel is too short to allow another 
recharge to complete before another shot can occur.  This PointDef 
fire occurs in the last minute of the combat round.

Nuclear Dampers to not appear to require "recharging."  So they 
can "fire" continuously.  Thus, they should be able to take out at 
least 60 per combat round (1 per second for 1 minute ... the last 
minute of the combat round).  Assuming a 50/50 chance of success 
(a very conservative number IMO), they would be able to 
automatically take out 30 nuclear missiles per combat round.  
Anything more than that and they probably shouldn\'t be in the fight to 
start with!  Note that this assumes all missiles arrive within the 
Damper\'s area of effect in the same minute.

I hoped everyone was able to follow this twisting line of logic.  I 
believe this falls under Deductive Reasoning ... If Cow A is Black 
then that black animal must be a cow :)

No, that\'s impossible because of the free market economy and concommitant

However, this training requires the investment of resources that could

I remember this - no author pops to mind though. Strikes me as something
I would\'ve read in "Best of Astounding" or "The <whatever> Award Winners
or 1980"

I also have to bring up  C. J. Cherryh, Foreigner, Invader, Inheritor.
While these are not generation ships they misjumped and went on maneuver
drive to the closest G star. I don\'t think I\'m giving anything about the
books away when I say how the Pilot\'s Guild became a hereditary ruling
class, the colonists rebelled, and a whole mess developed. (Ending up
in people floating down from the sky on petals!).

That\'s where I read it: James Blish did a bunch of books based

I thought when I read this that when the plants went untended, parts fell off
onto the floor. As long as the hydroponics keep working you are building up
a nice compost layer on the floor. Seeds drop off the untended plants. A
tube containing roots breaks and some of the spill onto the compost (along
with the remaining nutrient fluids). Anyway, thriving ecosystem on the
floor, and as I understand it, plants that never grew near one another on
the source world.

The problem I see is that as the compost layer builds up more and more
nutrients will be leaving the hydroponics system as the plants aren\'t being
recycled into the system and the crew isn\'t eating and generating waste to
be recycled.  The hydroponics system would have to have a huge stockpile of
nutrients available to allow a large amount of matter to leave the system
and form soil.  If the nutrients drop too low the hydroponics system would
just fail.

The pages are very netscape unfriendly. Looking with internet explorer I
see what looks like from the comment <!--LEFT COLUMN--> to
<!--RIGHT COLUMN-->. I don\'t see these in netscape. I didn\'t even look at
the page w/ lynx.

I\'d be willing to help you look into this, but I must admit to being a
little flummoxed as to why <map> is not working in netscape.
[My spell checker understands flummoxed, but not imperium. Go figya.]

The onMouseOver()s work in netscape, but the don\'t work quite as well in
IE -> IE always seems to show the underlying href.

                  Corruption

  A = Few laws or law officers, but the police/sherrif/judges are
      generally an honest and honorable.  I many cases, the judges
      and police work with the "spirit of the law" rather than
      depending on the letter.  An attempted bribe would be
      considered insulting and dealt with harshly.  The "honest
      west" of fiction.
      
  B = There are laws and regulations for almost everything, and they
      are enforced strictly.  Bribes attempts are dealt with harshly
      by the almost uniformly honest legal system.  This could be
      anything from a world like "Repent Hariquin, Said the Tick
      Tock Man", to an idealized totalitarian state.
      
  C = Again, laws and regulations for almost everthing, but the
      police and courts are more than willing to ignore
      *anything*...for a price.  In fact if you don\'t attempt to
      bribe an offical you are probably going to be dealt with very
      harshly.  You better hope you don\'t have enemies that can
      afford to outspend you or you will have the authorities out to
      get you, too.  The extreme would be like the movie "Brazil" or
      maybe "Max Headroom"...or a more realistic totalitarian state.
      
  D = There are few laws or regulations on the books, but the
      "authorities" will shake you down for bribes and payoffs on
      trumpped up charges anyway.  They are probably especially
      rough on outsiders and travellers.  You have to worry about
      these thugs staying bought, too.  Something like a Clint
      Eastwood western, certain real third world countries. or
      (mostly fictional) backwater county govenments in the rural
      American south.
      
Is there something like this in WBH?

Another one, a fairly easy read, and certainly not up with the
Grand Masters of the genre, would be the Star Trek novel
_The_Galactic_Whirlpool_ by David Gerrold (yes, he of the
tribbles).  Pre-warp generation ship, suffers mutiny, fairly
predictable degradation, et cetera.  Enter the Enterprise,
originally on an unrelated mission, et cetera...

David Gerrold does some pretty decent Star Trek stuff, but for a couple good 
reads, try his \'Star Wolf\' novels (\'Voyage of the Star Wolf\', \'The Middle Of 
Nowhere\'), or the War Against the Chtorr series.  I wish he\'d get the lead 
out and write Book 5 of the WAtC series already.  I\'m doing some serious 
jonesing.

Problem: Lake of an effective nitrogen cycle.  In an echo of the great
Vilani BBQ debate, there just would be enough base level nutrients avalible
to really support a robust ecology.  It\'s why you let fields lie fallow,
soil needs to regenerate itself, which is a hideously complex and
precariously balanced act.  See "Dust Bowl"  Also, hydroponics tanks will
be pretty focussed on things that we can eat, which tend to not be that
great (after milenia of tampering) at adapting.

An interesting alternative my be to have various fungi take over the tanks,
and from there run rampant.  Ever see "Journey to the Center of the Earth"?
 Mushrooms make an excellent food source, and a great source for
interesting drugs and poisons.

That\'s shows great restraint on the part of the scavengers, since you\'d
have to make sure that they ate and left their droppings in the same place
(exceedingly rare behavior outside of large predators), and didn\'t
experience a population explosion that resulted in all of the available
food plants being eating in a very short period.

I think Craig and I had an advantage, being raised bi-lingual.  :)

We absorbed a great deal of Brit English from both our father and endless,
parentally endorsed, nights of Monty Python\'s Flying Circus on channel 9.

When I was eight, my parents, grandparents and I were at some office
or other on a Saturday afternoon.  We had just finished eating
lunch, fried chicken, and my mother had been complaining about
having grease on her hands and no napkin to clean them.  I was
bored, getting restless, and had to use the rest room.  I sneaked
out.

A little exploring through the mostly empty building and I found the
Men\'s room, but it was locked and I was getting desperate...I tried
the Ladies.  It wasn\'t locked, I\'d been told to *never* go into the
Ladies room, but I was *really* getting desperate, so with great
trepidation I went in.

After taking care of urgent business, I took the opportunity to look
around.  It was much nicer than a Men\'s room.  There was even a
couch, though why anyone would want to sit around a restroom was
beyond me.  IAC, and much to my surprise, there was a vending
machine offering "Sanitary Napkins" for a dime.  It made sense.  Men
would just use the paper towels, but women were neat and selling
napkins in a ladies room seemed appropriate.

I had a dime.  It seemed like a lot for a napkin, I paid that much
for a comic book, and there was a new Sgt Rock out I wanted, but I
was going to be in trouble for sneaking out and figured this might
get me off the hook...so I inserted my dime.

Out popped a package, large for a napkin I thought, but maybe it was
a large cloth napkin and that\'s why it cost a dime. It came in a
paper wrapper, and that made sense too.  After all, sanitary means
clean.

I proudly returned to the office and presented my Mother with my
present saying, "Here, Mom!  You said you needed one of these."

A great uproar ensued!  I was sent out to wait in the car with
absolutely no idea why all the men were laughing and the women were
redfaced and embarrassed.

I don\'t suppose anyone would care to explain it to me?

I use MT, where it is MUCH more survivable:
	7+ to have no mishap, DM+3 average (Medical 2 and Edu 5-9), DM+4 for
a 4+ needed, and it specifies in the task that the mishap is always only 2d...
cautious.reduces it to 3+. 1 in 36 chance of injury, rolled as following:
1	2: Reroll this table (So doesn\'t count)
15/35	3-6: 1d6 wounds
18/35	7-10: 2d wounds; at -2 dex for 1d weeks
3/35	11-14:3d permanent wounds

chances of death are very slim, since wounds means attribute applied
points, not hits (each hit being 1d wounds).

3/35*1/36=1/35*1/12=1/(35*12)=1/(350+70)=1/420 chance of attribute loss of
a permanent nature, assuming cautious docs. assuming  competent,
non-cautious medics, it\'s 1/105 chance.... so, under MT, it\'ll only kill
the old, the weak, or the foolish (wo don\'t have decent docs...) or
seriously unlucky.

Don\'t forget, Doug; you were responsible for deleting the information

Heavy cavalry just means they have big horses (and usually big men ),
designed to charge into battle and use their impact against a holding
target. Whether the rider or mount is armoured is irrelevant

Light cavalry are designed for scouting and harrassing duties, including
mounted missile-fire, and are not normally expected to charge home against
enemy troops

In WRG rules, if the mount or rider has significant armour they are referred
to as extra-heavy cavalry, and  if in full plate, super-heavy cavalry
 those aren\'t the exact definitions, but they give the idea. )

Assuming thrust plates only work in a 100 diameter radius of a 
gravity well you can extend their range by accelerating near a large 
object, like a gas giant or star, then jump to where you estimate 
your target will be in a week.

If even this wasn\'t enough space to accelerate you\'d have to use 
multiple jumps, probably with drop tanks so you can still jump back 
into thrust plate range after your rendezvous.

I can imagine that for objects with a really high normal-space speed 
(near-c rocks?) you would use several jumps with several drop tanks. 
Boost the tanks to higher and higher speeds, timing them to intercept 
the expected ship arrival time and speed. Each time the ship pops out 
of jump it drops the spent tanks and docks with the boosted tanks, 
all while accelerating, and jumps again to the next drop tank 
interception point.

 (Gee, didn\'t some other ideological sorts also come up with the clever
idea of constructing an intellectual environment in which one was taught
that _their_ system was true because it was objective?)

  Of course, the 3I has seen them all come and go, with only those rare 
regimes that best capture the essence of the Imperial system achieving a
similar longevity. In fact, logically, the Imperium must long ago have 
achieved a dynamic equilibrium, in which case even those brief upheavals
that distress the body politic from time to time are themselves part of
the process of growth and renewal...

  But enough of this, we have an Archduke to entertain.

You seem to have quite an axe to grind on this point. I hope that you don\'t
think that the interpretation of history to not offend certain segments of
people is a purely American concept.

Hmm... The imperium stays at the same tech level for millennia. The
Solomani jump 3 (?) levels in a short war, then they get entrenched in
the same type of imperial government and we are at the same tech level for
a couple more millennia. I think politics is so pervasive in the 3I that
no real scientific research can get done.

Since all true states are evolving towards the Feudal Technocracy though,
I don\'t think we really have to worry about this...

Probably not a *favorite* game system here...we like Traveller.

Several have written and asked \'how\' I am sending them out - I am posting
them in the order that I received payment - have all those placed in August
and September of 1998 are mailed/ready to mail, and I will be working on
those placed in October of 1998 tomorrow.

Several have also written and asked if I have any sets left. The answer is
yes - around 30. Ordering information is still available on the website,
which I will update once I have a spare moment. Any new orders placed
before Dec.8th will still include free copies of the Imperial Calendar and
the Reavers\' Deep Sector Sourcebook.

As I memtioned in my post earlier this week, I will be printing/mailing out
sets up until Dec. 8th, at which time I am going on a three-week trip. I
will resume printing/mailing any remaining orders when I return home the
4th of Janurary.

Before I forget - due to real-life time-contraints, I scrapped plans to
print up and include as \'freebies\' the MegaTraveller I & II Cluebooks and
the manuals for Space I & II. If anyone who ordered a set was seriously
looking forward to these, please send me an email after the new year and I
will see about getting you a copy. Even though the sets are lacking the
intended freebies mentioned above, I hope the quality of the Imperial
Calendar, and especially the Reavers\' Deep Sourcebook will make up for it.

Speaking of the Reavers\' Deep Sourcebook, I would like to thank all those
who helped contribute both their time and effort to it - in particular
Jimmy Simpson and Hans Ranke.

Ok...I think that about covers it. I hope you folks enjoy the Supplements.
This whole experience has been one of learning for me, and I want to
appoligise one last time for the delay in getting them out. If you spot any
serious errors/typos, please send me an email.

Very!

In Netscape 4.04 (and that\'s the latest version I can get on this
particular system), the entire left hand ?frame? is missing.  I
wondered what Swordy meant by voting until I tried using IE.

Whatever is linked to with T5 gives me a screen full garbage, with
html code below it, had to scroll down to see it.

The link to www.rpgrealms/Traveller is broken...missing a dot com?

Looking at the pages, I see...or fail to see actually...the left
hand column is consistantly missing from the Site Index and FAQ
pages, News and Traveller pages.  ALL links are missing on the Links
page.

OTOH, what of it I can see looks nice.

Same with Netscape 4.7.  Interstingly, it does appear in kfm (the KDE file
manager), and is somewhat Lynx friendly.  I haven\'t looked at the source
closely, but I wonder if a <table> is missing it\'s </table>.  I\'ve found in the
past MSIE will display areas that Netscape will not in the same situation.

Heck, I\'ve lots better to do, so lets see what I can see.

Grepping the page source reveals 10 instances of "<table" and 9 of "</table";
looks like there is a missing </table>.

This is the guilty section.  It needs a </table> before the Pollit code starts:

\'The Warrant of Restoration\' - effectively the text of the 
constitution for the Imperium. It is the terms under which Cleon 
restored  the Ziru Sirka and the Rule of Man to form the Third 
Imperium.

It was written by one of the TMLrs - can\'t remember who though -

I know this was intended humorously, but in fact a feudal technocracy
might well be the worst environment for basic research.  If your power
comes from control of a resource or technology, then anything that changes
the basic ecomnomics behind that resource or technology is a potential
Very Bad Thing.  There would be a strong tendency not to rock the boat,
and to suprress anyone who threatened to do so.

Yes they are, but my family used to raise them for research and they are not

Would be a not so vocal minority...everyone rags on D&D sometime, but
lordy, it\'s what I cut my RPG\'ing teeth on many years ago, and it
definitely has a fond spot in my heart. I\'ve played it longer than I\'ve
played traveller, and wouldn\'t turn down a _good_* game today.

*good, of course, as long as it\'s set in my own hand-crafted universe,
with my own hand-crafted rules...we started playing a looooong time ago.

There are a _bunch_ of puzzles the players never did figure out.

<< You seem to have quite an axe to grind on this point. >>

I do. My undergrad degree was in American and European History, I wanted it 
in military history, but couldn\'t find a program. As an example, my Civil War 
specialist in my history department (Yale, Ph.D.) taught her lower division 
US history classes without mentioning the war at all, except in political 
terms. Who\'s Grant, Lee, Sherman, Jackson? Her thesis was on Women\'s history 
during the middle half of the 19th. century (hence her being the ACW 
department specialist). My English history specialist (Johns Hopkins, Ph.D.) 
wrote his dissertation on manners of the "gentle class" during the 18th 
century. He knew nothing of English military history during the period 
despite RN officers being of the class he studied. 

I HATE the whole social history movement. While I think it\'s very important 
to study the "little man/woman" to get the whole picture of history, I reject 
the notion that one shouldn\'t study the movers and shakers (i.e., the rulers, 
leaders, etc.). This is just 1960s backlash against the "establishment". The 
problem with social history, is that until democracy, the little man/woman 
didn\'t DO a whole hell of a lot. It\'s more interesting to study the leaders.

Ob Trav: Imagine studying the 3I by studying how the lives of groat farmers 
are effected by the civil wars, and NOT studying the barracks emperors.

I was just going to ask if it had been influenced by FS! Sounds interesting...

IIRC If you\'re looking at it from the perspective of the novel, it

Sorry to burst your bubble there, but the military history of the Civil
War is predominantly of interest to military historians. As iomportant as
the actions of Grant, Sherman, Lee, Jackson et. al. were, they were of
secondary importance to the overall picture.

The _political_ history of the Civil War is _why_ we have a military
history of the Civil War and is of far more relevance, particularly in
these days of the resurgence of \'states rights\'...

Sherman, for example, is far better remembered for his \'march to the sea\'
in social and political terms than in military ones. While his campaign
did hasten the wars end, to this day, over a hundred and thirty years
later, he is reviled in parts of this country as a genocidal monster,
hardly the picture we get in our history books as children. Whihc is more
important in it\'s impact on human society?

The second problem is your assumption that assignments in academic
departments have any relationship to what the professors specialty or
training is...That professor probably had little choice over her subject
matter...

Finally, aside from some constant whiners like George Will, who won\'t be
satisfied until college educations are limited to upper-class white males,
about upper-class white males like himself again, the \'PC\' fad has been
waning on most campuses for some time.

The problem with studying the \'movers and shakers\' is that we tend to
mostly have records written either by them, or by people with axes to
grind against them, and either is unlikely to be very reflective of
reality. However, historical accounts of those unimportant little people
are more likely to be factual, precisely because they didn\'t count, and no
one risked prison or worse writing some version of the truth.

From the impact on the lives on the little people we get a better idea of
what the M&S\'es were _really_ doing...and arguably studying the history of
99.999% of humankind could be considered more important that studying that
0.001% who are listed as important in the records they wrote themselves...

ObTrav. I suspect that the study of history in the 3I will be considerably
different, due to institutions such as the AAB, and the generally high
tech level of the Imperium and it\'s predecessors, leading to much better
record preservation.

For instance, imagine what the data warehouse of a megacorp like Sharushid
contains within it... the purchasing patterns and intimate detail on the
lives of trillions and trillions of customers reaching back millenia...

> Ob Trav: Imagine studying the 3I by studying how the lives of groat farmers

Seen from that perspective, the Civil War was some interesting news that
happened on the trivid, or to your neighbor Eneri down the road, whose
nephew was in the Navy and lost during a battle.

Canonically, about _all_ the the Civil War affected was whose butt was in
the the Iridium Throne, and whose fleets were in battle. To the people
involved it was a Big Thing, but to the greater mass of the Imperium, it
wasn\'t. 

That it was predominantly political maneuvering is made clear by the fact
that the outlying polities, such as the Vargr, Solomani and Zhodani didn\'t
take advantage of the \'unrest\' in the Imperium, because there really
wasn\'t all that much unrest...the Imperial bureaucracy continmued to
function just fine, as did the majority of the Navy...MOST fleets stayed
on station most of the time, loyal to the Emperor or Empress, whoever he
or she was that week.

It did not have the wodespread shortages, deprivations and destruction
that accompanied the Rebellion. The Hard Times hit everyone, then.

That so much print, argument and importance is attached to the Barracks
Emperors is a sign that the study in the 3I is skewed towards the M&S\'es
almost exclusively, the Dead White Males of the Imperium.

It is not quite as neat as being able to drop notes in the pilots
workstation for other pilots to see, but look at
http://www.datatone.com/~robb/escape.html
This is Luther Martin\'s Escape program (~53K) running under
Matthew T. Russotto\'s ZPlet (~126K)
So if your browser can do java, please come by and check it out.

I just provided the web space and told ZPlet to load Escape3.z5. I
am not to be held responsible for any time wasted searching for keys
to the ships locker or examining the pilots workstation.

Ah Ha! But that\'s why we are developing truth machines, and a cadre of
excellent psychologists who understand that those who cannot put the
rights of others before themselves are suffering from intense egomania.

What I am citing were interviews with the various special forces recon teams
who were on the ground to sift through remains. If I recall correctly,
they\'re in that multipart documentary on the Gulf War that gets shown on PBS
from time to time. They also had some interesting stories concerning near
misses with Iraqi soldiers, what trouble they had to go through with the
bodies and vehicles of their enemies after they took them out, etc.

Apparently, though, they did have people on the ground whose job it was to
confirm. Quite a brave -and also sneaky- breed of fellows.

Yes, there is a left column that contains a button bar, a comments
entry area for what you want in T5, and a questionaire asking which
of the Traveller versions (less GT) that you prefer.

Last I looked Classic Traveller was leading in the voting and it
looked something like:

CT  60
MT  15
TNE 10
T4   8
T5   0

Marc may have done this on purpose, but I noticed that the T5 radio
button is linked to T4.  How did I find that out?  I voted for T5
and T4 went up 1 while T5 stayed 0.

I\'m pretty sure aquaculture is your best bet for high density
*animal* protein:  Fish, shrimp, crayfish etc.  In fact, the algae
they eat is excellent feed stock for processing.

In the Akus game, Doctor Mira (Suz Dollar) is going to setup a
hydroponics/acquculture system to suppliment life support.  She has
the advantage of carnotanks for bulk protein, so her set up is for
variety, flavor, and because sitting behind an artifical waterfall
in a grotto while in Jumpspace struck her fancy. <g>

Certainly, and I don\'t disagree that the study of political and
culture history is most important for the general student...and the
general public, *but* I was going to be a history major and could
not find *any* interest in military history at 3 separate
universities.  I was advised to try joining ROTC by the only person
in the history department that offered any positive advice at all.

Only if she wasn\'t up the ladder in seniority.  Full professors
can strongly influence what they teach, at least for the occasional
course in their special interest area.  Graduate seminars...don\'t
you know.  <g> You can usually get into a grad seminar even as a
lowly undergraduate if you talk to the professor, express an
interest, and show some knowledge of the subject.

Ob Trav, think about academic careers and academics as patrons...

  The party is approached by a man/woman who wants to hire a
  ship/crew/bodyguards for an expedition to system X.

  1.  The patron is a biologist that wants to study the life cycle
      of the greater spotted Rdo. The party are his support team, or
      maybe just hired hands.  The professor talks incessantly about
      the spotted rdo, but fails to tell you about the rest of the
      ecology on Macardal.
      
  2.  The patron is a grad student in sociology writing her
      dissertation on the changes in cultural patterns during large
      scale TL6 wars, and her committee has recommended some
      empirical research on the balkanized world of Bonzi.  You have
      to get her there and keep her (and yourselves alive) in the
      middle of a world war..ie England or Germany in 1944.
      
  3.  The patron is an astrophysicist who wants to test a theory and
      needs to get *very* close to a M9V. He insists that it must be
      in an uninhabited system, but doesn\'t say why. 
      
  4.  The patron is an archaeologist who is sure he has found the
      location of an Ancient Library on a TL4 world from his study
      of old archive records, but needs to go there to confirm it
      before he can risk writing it up for publication.  He doesn\'t
      even *know* that the area where the library may be is
      dominated by a humophobic (it *should* be called homophobic,
      but that has taken on another meaning) Vargr culture.
      
  5.  The patron is an academic that tells the party that another
      academic has stolen a copy of her data and she wants them to
      get it back and prevent him from acting on it until she has a
      chance to publish.
      
  6.  The patron has a simple courier job of transporting some data,
      or a specimen, to a collaborating professor in another system,
      or perhaps transporting supplies to a research site.
      
  7.  The patron is a rich young student who wants to charter the
      party\'s ship (or hire them as crew for his yacht) for an
      "outing" by his fraternity to the subsector gravball
      championship game.
      
  8.  The patron is the Duke of Tolliver who wants his daughter
      delivered to the Hape Finishing School on Rondai.  He tells
      the party that Marie is "a little high spirited" and may not
      really want to go, but that "it is *his* wish" and you won\'t
      get paid unless you deliver her to Madam Pallet the head
      mistress at Hape.  And heaven help you, if you lose Marie!

It\'s hardly a 1960s backlash against the establishment. The very concept of
social history has roots that reach back to folks like Marx. Although I
personally think that Marx simplified things too much, his idea that history
could be viewed from the bottom up as opposed to the top down was undeniably
revolutionary. The tradition grew and continued from the 19th century on. It
gained steam later with interesting permutations that developed with the
growth and / or birth of such disciplines as folklore, sociology,
anthropology, linguistics and the other social sciences.

Academic movements, like artistic movements, literary movements and
political movements, usually don\'t appear overnight. It\'s not like everybody
in the late 60s just said, "Hey let\'s be anti-establishment and muck around
with history!" It\'s been a slow and steady progression.

I can easily imagine it, especially in the light that canonically the social
sciences have progressed to the astonishing complexity of "psycho-history."
Do you think that they progressed to that point by studying the tiny group
of Mules and shakers... um... pardon me, movers and shakers who cast long
shadows on history? Of course not.

The truth of the matter is that studying the groat farmers gives a much
clearer picture of history. It provides context which cannot be attained by
seeing who happened to have claim to the Iridium Throne on a given day
during the period of the Barracks Emperors.

High technology does not always bring with it better record preservation.
One of the problems that people are starting to focus on is the lack of
permanence of computer records. I don\'t mean that they degrade, I mean that
they just simply disappear. I would one day like to write a popular history
of the BBS world, and I\'ve discovered in doing so that... well... large
chunks of that history are just gone. No archeologist is ever going to dig
this stuff up. For the most part, roughly twenty years of the history of
computer telecommunications happen to be lost. Forever.

The problem isn\'t the method of recording, the problem is that people just
don\'t realize that they\'re sitting on tomorrow\'s history. Then again...

...the Vilani may be a little bit different in that respect. ;)

They might *always* realize that they\'re sitting on top of history at all
times, and go to great lengths to preserve it. ;)

You\'re right of course; I\'ve read Clauswitz. The point here I was trying to

You forgot that he was also a racist. The point I was trying to make was that 
the Savannah campaign (what I call the march to the sea) wasn\'t mentioned at 
all either. This one surprised me even more, as the social historians could 
have studied the effects on the people, but it\'s not PC to feel sorry for 
Confederates (even I as a Yankee would be interested...).

<<The second problem is your assumption that assignments in academic
departments have any relationship to what the professors specialty or
training is...That professor probably had little choice over her subject
matter...>>

Also true; especially at the lower division level, HOWEVER the professors DO 
have leeway in HOW they teach it. They pick the text, and they design the 
syllabus.

<<Finally, aside from some constant whiners like George Will, who won\'t be
satisfied until college educations are limited to upper-class white males,
about upper-class white males like himself again, the \'PC\' fad has been
waning on most campuses for some time.>>

Maybe in the "hard sciences", but NOT in the social sciences. It\'s the last 
stand of the Marxists (and the colleges of education)...

<<The problem with studying the \'movers and shakers\' is that we tend to
mostly have records written either by them, or by people with axes to
grind against them, and either is unlikely to be very reflective of
reality. However, historical accounts of those unimportant little people
are more likely to be factual, precisely because they didn\'t count, and no
one risked prison or worse writing some version of the truth.

From the impact on the lives on the little people we get a better idea of
what the M&S\'es were _really_ doing...and arguably studying the history of
99.999% of humankind could be considered more important that studying that
0.001% who are listed as important in the records they wrote themselves...>>

True; BUT you need to study a cross-section of all of society. The social 
historians are very heavily indoctrinated by modern left wing politics. They 
object to studying ANY western leaders, because obviously to them by being 
white males, they have to be automatically wrong regardless of the facts 
either way. This is plain narrow-mindedness...This is what I object to. I 
have no problem studying the "small" people as well as leaders to cooberate 
data on a subject, but they knocked the pendulum all the way to the other 
side.

<<Seen from that perspective, the Civil War was some interesting news that
happened on the trivid, or to your neighbor Eneri down the road, whose
nephew was in the Navy and lost during a battle.

Canonically, about _all_ the the Civil War affected was whose butt was in
the the Iridium Throne, and whose fleets were in battle. To the people
involved it was a Big Thing, but to the greater mass of the Imperium, it
wasn\'t.>>

This is my fault. I should have used a more direct model, like the rebellion, 
or on a smaller scope, the effect on Imperial citizens in the middle of a war 
zone...

I suggest we move this thread to offlist....

AD&D2, D&D Cyclopaedia, both are good sets of rules (if mechanically
dated)... and I\'ve noticed a distinct preference amongst gamers in general
(at least in alaska) to play fantasy games... you can always scrape
together 5 or 6 D&D/AD&D players... it\'s hard to find people willing to do
serious sci-fi (as opposed to Hack and Slash Fantasy in space).

re the list, havn\'t seen a lot of D&D/AD&D bashing... at least not recently.
I run a wide variety of games, CT/MT Traveller being my favorite setting...
but I\'m currently anixious to see D&D3.

Much of the data that is not actively distorted by vested interests will be
incomplete or inaccurate when viewed in retrospect, simply because the
people making the record _lived_ in their world, and made assumptions and
left out data that future researchers can\'t reconstruct. That\'s the reason
for the branch of anthropology called "Historical Archaeology", which seeks
to confirm or deny the available historical records with archaeological
evidence. HA often focuses on disenfranchised minorities, because they
leave so few written records.

ObTrav: Because of the length of the historical record, most of the
archaeology in the Imperium would fall into the category of HA rather than
the pre-historic archaeology with which we are more familiar. If nothing
else, it would provide some archaeological expeditions with a rationale and
goal *other* than the done-to-death Ancients (cf. the Beltstrike module).

If you did not blind yourself to the powers of the mind, you would not need

Well, I would assume that fuel tankage is divided into a number of
bunkers, of different sizes.  This would allow one to drain individual
tanks (leaving only residual vapor within), without affecting
neighboring tanks.  This system also explains why battle damage only
destroys a percentage of fuel tankage (unless, of course, you score the
"Fuel Tanks Shattered" golden BB).

Neither; it\'s Legomania (ask Evil Stevie for details)....

Looks great! Is the highport your design? It looks quite different from many of
your other images. So, is it *really* a BIG highport a long way away, or a small
one close up? C\'mon, you can \'fess up!  ;-)  Seriously, is it to scale? Would a
close shot up near those spikes show heaps more detail? (small windows from the
texture map, etc?) I *assume* it will appear more times in the book - just a
pity they don\'t print them in colour. What we need is to get SJG to insert
colour plates like IG did - we\'ll just ditch Chris Foss in favour of Jesse
DeGraaf.  :-)

Two Scout ships, 4 x-boats. It\'s a 1000t craft with a 4000t "cargo" bay. The
xboats are packed in nose-to-tail, like sardines (actually, the tender is
probably based on a sardine tin - the one with the roll-back lid!!).

Well, outside the US much of the archaeology is devoted to \'historic\' (ie
literate) societies eg Egyptian, Mesopotamian, Greek, Roman, Saxon,
Medieval, Chinese, etc etc. Some parts of the world *do* have more than 500
years written records <g>. Hence, on this side of the pond, archaeology is a
companion subject to history, not anthropology.

Well, I\'m fairly certain that the archaeology of the Long Night won\'t be
covered by existing AAB records.

  The "little man" was what made up the armies and navies to which the Great
occasionally referred; one nice thing about studying things from below is
that (at least before the late modern era) little things come out like "gee,
what so-and-so wrote in their autobiography (/autohagiography) is basically
flat out impossible once we examine it, so maybe we can start to figure out
what really happened".

What about different sets of laws for citizens and non-citizens. In the U.S.
(barring certain special rules applied under immigration laws) anyone within
the country is subject to the same laws, (wealth level notwithstanding). A
rich person may be able to afford a better lawyer or get more differential
treatment from the police, but at its legal basis laws are equally applied
to citizens and aliens (non-citizens).

This is not necessarily a requirement. The Romans had one set of laws for
citizens and another for non-citizens. Is this the case in the Imperium? Do
some laws only apply to the nobility, in both a negative and a positive
sense?

Good idea...

Well, as I understand it anthro refers to "man."  So, assuming we
limit the meaning of man to "human" it would work.  <g>

You pump out liquid, and some of the remaining fuel vaporizes to
fill the space. 

That\'s how it works in current LH2 tanks, and there\'s no reason for
ones in the future to be any different.

Well, actually, there are some setups that pressurize the tank with
helium gas. But that\'s because most current vehicles have tanks that
are so lightweight that they\'ll collapse without positive pressure.
That\'s not the case with tanks in Traveller ships.

The UK law as I understand it, is something like:

A cricket bat being taken home from a crickect bat shop or being 
conveyed towards a place where cricket might be expected to be played
(with that bat) or being used at such a venue is a cricket bat.

At other times it is an offensive weapon and thus posession is illegal.

In fact, just being a spectator at a cricket match would not entitle you
to take one into the ground. Though fortunately, the police are fairly
lax on that bit of the law, since they regularly let the England team in.

Interesting side note Stonewall Jackson wanted to do the same to

which he helpstart.  We have his desk tucked away in the 
basenment of the Library, thats all the sign we have of him.

Being trained in Social History I want to point out that a good 
Social Historian combines both the role of the leaders and the little 
people to show the whole picture.  All to often though historians fail 
to combine the two or take on two much.  A modern (ie 1990)well 
writen account would pick a time period and or region to study.  
They would examine how the rullers and ruled then interact over a 
key issue.  Good example of of massive soical histories are works 
by Moore and his followers such as Charles Tilly.  Most of their 
works focuse of the evoluation of the state or revolutions.

This being the case then none of the sides in the
 civil war have the ability to effect much change but what about the 
goat farmers.  Have we seen how the attemptes by the contenders 
to gain political, military, economic, or social influnces worked out.  
If the fleet and the bureacucracy stayed out then the abilities of 
these leaders to gain local (sectoral-system) control becomes all 
that more important.  

Now lets put the goat farmer on a subsector
captial with a large millitia.  Now the goat famer sales his goat\'s 
milk to the down port.  A contender comes in takes the down port 
and taxes all goods.  The goat farmer and every other mearchant 
goes into rebellion (maybe not open) and invenite a rival to come to 
the system.  Thus the civil war comes to our poor goat farmer.

If you dont see this happing read Tilly\'s When History Meets 
Sociology. (something like this)


Sorry I just got done doing some of that social history for class.

I have a conversion formula from FF&S2 to Starships, but I am not sure
it\'s correct. Anyway:

* Divide the FF&S2 armor value by the square root of 2
* Look up the result in the USP Conversion chart from Starships.    
Extrapolate the given values to one decimal.
* Multiply the resulting value by 10

The problem is that according to FF&S2, the minimum armor value for a
spaceship is 20. With the conversion system above, this corresponds to a
value of 7, which is a lot higher than what seems to be logical (there
are a lot of armor 0 ships, and the Destroyer only has an armor value of
10).

What am I doing wrong?

The Vargr character generation system has the far more volatile 
Charisma taking the place (for the most part) of Social Standing,
at least in Vargr culture...though an Imperial Vargr would almost
certainly have an Imperial social standing as well.

"Mageocracy" = rulership by people with magical powers. Not the
most accurate term, but social standing in the Zhodani consulate
is strongly linked to posession of psionic powers, and the strength
of those powers.

For a counter-example of Al Capone, look at John Kennedy senior.
The basis of his family fortune was his career as a smuggler during
the American prohibition era, but he was later (after he "retired" from
his stint in the "Other" career) able to turn his wealth into a high social
standing. Had Al Capone retired from his career in the "Other" profession,
and relocated out of the jurisdiction of the American justice system,
he could probably have done the same. Considering the social
circles some gangsters moved in - Hollywood, Las Vegas, etc. - there
are many examples of gangsters who would be rated with quite high
(if very vulnerable) social standings, even while at the height of their
careers.

Please tell me about this "Fate of the Skyraiders" adventure.  Which 
edition was it for?  Who put it out?  How would you rate it on a one 
to ten scale, ten being the best?

Yes, they did mention it.  Still no word on whether it\'s going to be 
used for official stuff, but most likely it\'s out there for us to 
play with.  Sounds like it would fit the scenario quite well, 
although I can\'t really see the Leader of the Cons completing the 
trip back to Terra without at least some serious consideration on his 
capacities to impact his former homeworld.  But it is food for 
thought....

The Keith\'s did it.  Nothing more need be said, it\'s an 11.  It was an old 
FASA product, and was of the highest quality.

Part of a trilogy put out by FASA. Legend of the Sky Raiders, Trail 
of the Sky Raiders, and Fate of the Sky Raiders. It was for CT. I don\'t
remember many details except that I thought it was one of the best 
sets of adventure modules for CT I had seen. Very detailed. I don\'t 
have them at hand and can\'t recall the plot in any real detail so I
will let someone else answer that part. I rate it, for what I remember 
of my impressions, as a 9 or 10.

30 years ago? Hmmm...oh, at the _HEIGHT_ of antiwar sentiment? I wonder
why you got any help at all...:-/

I\'m not denying that political trends affect academics...I\'m just tired of
the oft-repeated myth (lately) that academics are uniformly a seething
nest of anti-white, anti-male communist liberals. 

In my experience, academics in general are a seething nest of stubborn
individuals with tenure so they don\'t care WHAT others think...

 Advancement in the nobility of the Consulate has more to do with
the desire to lead and the responsibility to do so. At every level
the nobles are a democracy amongst themselves, regardless of how
they handle the Proles that are their responsibility. The Nobles of
a planet elect a planetary Council, which elects two members to
the subsector Council, which elects members to the Provincial
Council, which elects members to the Consulate Council
(aka the Qlomdlabr\').

 The closest I\'ve come to describing this is "Democratic Meritocracy."

Some parts of the US (New York City, in particular) have similar laws.  For 
example, it\'s illegal to carry a baseball bat if you don\'t have a baseball 
on you (I guess the idea is that if you have both, you are actually going

	I am a biologist, but I have not played one on TV.

	Good summary of island biogeography.

	I am not familiar with the term "autochthonous," but from
	the quote provided I take it to mean the division of one
	species into two where there is no physical barrier to
	separate the prospective species.  This certainly makes
	sense: very small populations would find such speciation
	unlikely (it is contraversial as to whether such speciation
	takes place even in large areas).  However, a small area can
	actually help speciation along in the sense of a population
	evolving into a new species.

	There is certainly a limit to the size of organisms that
	can live there, and you cannot evolve if you cannot live.
	I can repost those biomass estimates to give you an idea
	of how large the different levels of the food chain are
	likely to be, but (as someone posted) 100 kg plants to 10
	kg herbivores to 1 kg carnivores is a good rule-of-thunb.

>ObTrav:

	This is probably true.  If you really want a complex
	ecosystem, an argument could be made that the complexity
	of the vessel (halls, different levels, etc.) make it
	effectively bigger than it is.  Also, if some parts of
	the vessel are cut off from others, different species
	might evolve in each (perhaps the separation was 
	temporary, just long enough to establish reproductively
	isolated populations).

>* These results imply that (within limits) planets with larger

>complex land ecosystems.

	I\'m not sure that the rules of island biogeography can be
	extended in this fashion.  Without going into a long-winded
	explanation, the complexity of the ecosystem around San
	Francisco has very little to do with how big eastern North
	America is.

	I would certainly expect that lots of species would invade
	new worlds, some might be well-known pests (like Terran
	rats).

	Terran history has seen numbers of species fluctuate rather
	widely, and the same would be expected of any biosphere.
	That being said, I wouldn\'t expect a noticable decline in
	the number of species (other than a few transient individuals
	around the starport) in any biosphere after the cessation of
	interstellar contact.  Worlds with restricted ecosystems (life
	only found in deep canyons, artificial domes, within a few km
	of the poles, etc.) might be an exception, but speciation/
	extinction rates tend to be VERY slow by human standards.

	I don\'t know what Mr. Kennedy\'s SoS would have been after he

Partially correct.  It was a 14 on a scale of 1 to 10.

There are strict limits to one\'s social standing if one does not have
psionic powers, and one\'s social standing can increase based on
successful use of these psionic powers - at least, they can during 
the Zhodani character generation procedure, with involvement in
the psionic olympics. I agree that posession of and power level of
psionic powers is not the only facet of Zhodani social standing, it
is the facet that is most different from that of the Third Imperium.

Can you call the ruling oligarchy Charismatic if they use mind control
to gain for themselves the support of the governed?  ;-)

One thing I\'ve wondered about the Zhodani Mind-Rapers vs Zhodani
Super-Psychologists: if the first thing you learn about something
very complicated is how to make it behave in a very simple fashion
that suits your needs, how good will you actually get at understanding
the very complex parts of it?

Let\'s say that Zhodani psionic adepts learn to read and alter minds.
Is it a necessity that they learn the entire workings of the human
brain to impose a desired mental state upon it? Can a dissatisfied
prole be turned into a happy prole by just applying Mental State #37
(Happy, Loyal Prole) on top of whatever real problems that prole had?
Perhaps the prole will still have those problems, but be unable to
express them or act upon them...or even let anyone know that they
still exist.

If this technique makes a troublemaker stop being a troublemaker,
will the adepts take the time and effort needed to get a better
understanding of the human mind? I know they can just open up
their telepathy and take a look - but I can look at a cell through
a microscope, that doesn\'t mean I understand cellular metabolism.

The Zhodani technique could be something as simple as laying in
a few commands - "Do Not Question The Social Order." 
"Fulfill Your Assigned Tasks Quickly And Efficiently."
"Present A Happy And Contented Attitude To Everyone You Meet."
Now the person\'s brain warps here and there to accomodate these
iron, unchangeable commands, like a rain forest might warp to 
accomodate a four-lane expressway. The expressway builder didn\'t
need to know much at all about the rain forest, and didn\'t care - as
long as he could cut down or pave over anything in his way. Simple
wins over complex by making it simple.

Once a simple, reliable technique is developed for keeping the proles
in line, will the Zhodani Tvarcheedle spend their resources working on
a more complex technique that\'s nicer to the proles\' brains, or will they
instead work on making the simple (though brutal) technique more
effective and more efficient?

If you generate an error report in iCAB and send it to Marc I\'d 
suggest that you switch off the Netscape and IE specific code being

(For non-iCAB/MacOS users info, iCAB will check a site\'s compliance 
with HTML4.0 and report all errors. Every page gets a smiley face 
icon - if the page \'makes iCAB smile\' then it\'s fully compliant. Very 
few pages make iCAB smile :-/ iCAB is almost all there now bar 
javascript and some plug-ins, and the preview is free and an enormous 
1Mb download. A Windows version is not currently planned).

Surely, if there are \'Nobles\' involved, it *has* to be an Aristocracy if
they wield the only real power.  Perhaps it could be an Aristocratic errr...
umm.. Sophocracy (ie Rule of Thought...?).

Yeah, Aristocratic Sophocracy.... sounds cool <g>

    Someone correct me if I\'m wrong, but the Solomani Rim War
occurs AFTER the Civil War doesn\'t it?  There are no Solomani
to intervene.  Or more precisely, they are part of the Imperium at
this time and I\'m quite sure intervening as direct participants.
    The Zhodani DO try and take advantage of the Civil War.  It\'s called
the 3rd Frontier War and winning it is Arbellatra\'s springboard into
contention for the Iridium Throne.
    As far as the Vargr, they participated as part of the 3FW\'s Coalition
I am sure and I am one of the faction that views the Extents as no serious
threat to Imperial Security anyway.

"Social history" encompasses a lot of different orientations and
methodologies, but as a general subdiscipline it dates back several
generations before the \'60s.  Bloch was writing in the \'20s.  Not that
that doesn\'t make the whole thing a load of whiny hooey, of course!

I tend to design support vehicles and starships for the sake of 
completeness. However, I run into a problem with Traveller; the primary role 
(or at least a major role) of an ARV (Armored Recovery Vehicle) is to take a 
damaged vehicle from where it was knocked out to where it can be effectively 
repaired. This usually isn\'t much of a problem with wheeled or tracked 
vehicles; as long as wheels or tracks or intact, you just tow it back.

This really doesn\'t work for grav vehicles, though, unless you want to drag 
them around on their underbodies. As I see it, there are three (well, four) 
possible recovery situations for a grav vehicle:

(1) contragravity units undamaged: If the vehicle still has power, it can 
activate the units and be towed normally by the ARV. If the disabled vehicle 
no longer has power, a power cable can be run from the ARV to a standard 
power socket on the disabled vehicle in order to power the contragravity 
units. The vehicle is then towed as above.

(2) contragravity units damage: This gets a little complicated. Even with 
power, the disabled vehicle is no longer capable of "lifting" itself. The 
best solution I see it that every AFV (Armored Fighting Vehicle) comes with 
external attachment points for emergency grav pods; these grav pods are just 
contragravity units with either a large rechargable battery (CG units tend 
to have pretty low power requirements) or a power socket for power cables 
coming from the ARV. The ARV would carry several emergency grav pods 
(probably enough to lift the heaviest vehicle the ARV was supposed to tow). 
For realism, the CG "lift" should be distributed around the disabled vehicle 
as evenly as possible. After the emergency grav pods are attached and 
activated, the AFV is towed as normal.

(3) AFV virtually destroyed: The vehicle has been disabled to the point to 
where it cannot be towed (there is a real risk that it may break apart in 
transit). If possible, a grav transport (basically a large grav flatbead 
truck) is brought in and the disabled vehicle is placed on the back (using 
CG pods and/or cranes). If the situation is too dangerous, the AFV strips 
what equipment it can, then uses demolition charges to prevent whatever is 
left from the AFV to fall into enemy hands.

(4) AFV self-mobile: The AFV can move on its own, but is damaged to the 
point where it is unlikely to return to base on its own. An ARV is sent to 
provide minor repairs (if possible) or towing (if neccessary).

    Whereas I thought of the old Chuck Norris series of Missing In Action
movies.  Seriously, this is more likely to lead to an espionage plot or
an independent rescue attempt with a well-to-do industrialist (along the
lines of H. Ross Perot) hiring a groups of mercs (i.e. PCs) than a 6FW,
at least IMO.

The group designing vehicles for Grond Vehicles have produced the Heavy
Recovery Sled, which can lift diabled Intrepids and fly them back to repair
and salvage points.  An Intrepid weighs 192 tons.

And I just got Trail of the Skyraiders from Swordy which fills out my

!!!!POSSIBLE SPOILER (How MANY people NEVER heard of the Skyraiders Trilogy
anyway?)





The advernture is a CT trilogy that follows the search for a race of
pre-Imperium star travellers that terrized one of the Keith Bros. playground
sectors. in the first the PCs assist a scientist in searching a planet that
the scientist thinks is the Skyraiders home world, The second follows the
adventures of the scientist\'s archiologist daughter as she persues more
inforamtion on the Skyraiders. THe thisrd and final volume answers all the
unanswered questions presented in the first two and details a massive
asteroid ship in the process.

I did consider slinging the disabled AFV underneath, like many helicopters 
do today with heavy loads. However, 192 tons is a pretty good amount of 
dead-weight to tote around. It seems best to me to try and get some kind of 
CG working on the towed vehicle.

If you can recognize the fact that something is written in
Hebrew, that will be enough - the Coke cans don\'t have anything
in Hebrew on them UNLESS it\'s the Kosher for Passover (Kosher
l\'Pesach) stuff.

However, let me try to describe what the Hebrew looks like:

(N.B. Hebrew is read right-to-left.  The "first" letter of a word
is the one at the right end.)

The word "kosher" has three letters.  The first letter looks sort
of like a backward C, the second letter looks sort of like a W -
or maybe a Russian SH, and the third looks like a backwards
lower-case "r".

The word "Pesach" also has three letters - the first looks sort
of like a backward lower-case "e", the second looks like an "o"
with a little bit of a serif at the upper left, and the last
letter looks kind of like a vertically-elongated backward
lower-case "r".

However, the phrase is "kosher l\'pesach", which means I haven\'t
accounted for the "l\'".  That\'s attached to the beginning of the
second word, and it looks like a "7" with a tail rising from the
left end of the horizontal bar.  The tail may or may not be
folded back along the top bar, but either way, it will be
distinct.

I\'d try to do some bad ascii, but it\'d be worse than useless.

Pesach/Passover is usually around Easter, so look at the Coke
starting about a month before then.

Heck, no ; Skinnerian operant conditioning is predicated on a \'black
box\' model of the brain. Most RW cognitive-behavioural therapies have
their origins in operant conditioning.
(My apologies to any psychologists or psychiatrists on the list who
were taught at schools with alternate views).

The list has been talking about academic styles, particularly in the
social sciences, of late.
    One could envisage two basic approaches to the problem of \'cognitive
science\' - the intersection of psychology, psionics and
neurophysiology.
    i. \'Lumping\' - under some (?flawed) unifying theory. Canon posits
that the physical basis of psionics remains unclear [?at less than
Ancient tech levels?], so psionicology may remain on a semi-mystical
footing, especially in the Consulate (instead of being forbidden
knowledge, like in the Imperium).
    ii. \'Splitting\' - data is gathered in each separate discipline. From
time to time, some genius arises who can link apparently disparate
findings.
    I would suspect that the situation is a dynamic one, where the
pendulum oscillates between these extremes with time.

Again, this depends on parallel progress in psionicology and other
social attitudes. If the conditioning technique works and has minimal
knock on effects, it doesn\'t need changing.
    On the other hand, quite maladaptive behaviours may result. An
example from SF is in Haldeman\'s \'The Forever War\' where the UNEF
infantry are initially conditioned to become disinhibited killers by
post-hypnotic suggestion. The only problem is that survival behaviours
were suppressed, leading to some disastrous defeats by the Taurans later
on (berserkers and modern (near-future tech) weapons don\'t mix).

This thread could be quite useful to future Trav-Culture efforts ; keep
the info coming!

disintegrator weapons.

I think the two basic types of nuclear dampers, based on the
information that was posted a few digests back, are :-
i. Point defence device - intercept incoming nukes.
ii. \'Damper box\' - items within a damping field have more (or less)
stable nuclei. E.g. theatre of ops/city (installation)/vehicle
protection/stabilising californium munitions.

So a disintegrator induces instability in the target\'s atoms, which is
opposed by the damper in \'box\' mode.
(?alters strong or electroweak force/suppresses electron or proton
charge/perturbs local constants e.g. changes gravitational and
electromag interactions from inverse square to some other power, or
varies Planck constant/free space permittivity/G?)

From a GURPS standpoint, a nuclear damper is a primitive SATAN (Space
And Time Anomaly Neutraliser) device, operating in two modes (albeit
very important ones).

We used to have a guy in downtown Portland who had a quarterstaff all
the time. He used it to assist in skating (old style skates, not
inline). He\'d be moving along a quite a clip, and use the staff to
vault over curbs. He could also corner on a dime by planting the staff
and using it for a pivot. 

I don\'t know if he ever used it for self-defense, but it certainly
would have worked!

I knew two women that didn\'t like Coke made with corn syrup, and I thought
they were just picky?  This is far wider than I imagined.

ObTrav:  When you are talking about a meg-corp brand of softdrink that spans
several systems, unless wholly imported, this must have similar incidents?
(Remember, in my old TU, just to annoy some of the non-Pepsi drinking
players, Pepsi won the cola wars by the time of the Rule of Man, and Pepsi
was swept across the galaxy... only it didn\'t resemble Pepsi or Coke as we
know it in the Marches.  I wonder how many NPC\'s gave up drinking it when
they moved or were transferred to other systems?).

From what I have seen and understand, most heavy AFV\'s are only towed very
short distances (to get them to a nearby safe zone for further transport if
required).

I can see a heavy-lift Grav-Recovery vehicle (similar to a large tilt-tray)
land in front of a disabled grav-tank, the recovery crew lifting it on
hydraulic lifts, fitting wheeled jigs front and back (or the tray itself may
have rollers?), then winching it on board.  Once secured, the recovery crew
mount the recovery vehicle and diddly bop off to rear area facilities to
repair the disabled vehicle?

The walls of a fuel tank actually consists of two layers: a rigid outer
layer and a flexible, collapsible inside layer. As the fuel is expended,
the inner layer begins to collapse, leaving vacuum between it and the 
outside layer. When the tank gets filled, the inner layer expands again
to fill the inside...

 Er. The Proles get no vote at all. Just as with the Imperium, the common man 
gets some control, sometimes, over his immediate form of government, but the 
governance of the Consulate as a whole is determined top-to-bottom by the 
Nobility. Despite the historical precedents, most modern Zhodani nobility got 
that way due to being psionic. Unlike the Imperium, not all nobles are in 
positions of rulership. The nobility of the Consulate are its sole "Citizens" 
(in the Starship Troopers sense). Everyone else is a citizen (note the lack 
of capitalization) of their homeworld. The noble Citizens do what they like 
with regards to rulership; if a noble wishes to "make a difference" he may 
join the Thought Police, join the military, run for Counselor, take a 
position within the local government (details of this vary from world to 
world), go into business, or take up "good works" in direct aid of the world 
he is part of. Provided he can put food on the table, he is also allowed to 
do nothing, though this is rare.

 This is what the Imperium *thinks* the Though Police do, failing to account 
for the fact that Zhodani are Human, too. Human/Monkey curiosity being what 
it is, this type of adjustment would probably be considered primitive and 
brutal, since better techniques were developed a long time ago.

 Human psyche being what it is, the Tavrchedl\' will prefer adjustment 
techniques that will stand up under pressure, whether you view the Zhodani as 
benevolent or malevolent. If you have to re-adjust the same poor b----rd 
every few months because his job is stressful enough to shred the "life is 
simple" conditioning you stamped on his brain in three minutes, then you are 
very probably going to work on the twenty minute "good for a decade" 
technique just to keep the workload down. As suggested by the original 
Zhodani Module, this will often involve installing techniques and thought 
channels that help the person "deal" more readily.

 At the risk of ruining the strip, I recommend reading a few weeks of Dilbert 
as if it were a window into a Zhodani business. Keep the following questions 
in mind:
 -who needs adjustment?
 -who has been adjusted?
 -were they Brain-Shellacked or adjusted more subtly?
 -what coping mechanisms were installed, if any?
 -has anyone been adjusted too often?
 -who is the hidden Tavrchedl\' officer?

Cheers,

GC

Sorry, but even at *our* crude level of understanding of the mind, we
can tell *exactly* what happens when you suppress things that way. The
suppressed feelings or impulses eventually find another outlet, and
usually it\'s a lot less desirable than the original one. 

And given the ability to dig into a mind and see what someone is
thinking (which is pretty much a given from comments in the rules and
background) you\'d be able to *see* this happening.

Again, we *know* that the warpage gets pretty extreme anytime there\'s a
conflict between inner desires and outer behavior. Until and unless you
"fix" the *source* of the problem (as opposed to slapping more
behavioral restrictions on top) you are in effect tieing down the
safety valve on a steam engine, and then slapping patches on each joint
as it starts to leak. Eventually it blows up in your face.

Heck, look at our world. We\'ve got "mere" social and economic pressures
keeping people "in line". And yet we still have people "go postal".
Just *think* what a person with that much anger and hatred could do by
harnessing the resulting "drive" towards finding loopholes in the
commands. 

"Fulfill Your Assigned Tasks Quickly And Efficiently." is just *asking*
for a "rules lawyer" mindset to work on it.

Anything that requires "mass conditioning" *can\'t* be simple or
efficient. The mere fact that you have to do it to *everyone* makes it
inefficient. And given the facts above, it\'ll lots of monitoring and
adjustment.

Stop and consider just how many Imperial troops were involved. What
percentage of the total troop strengths are the POWs. Now consider the
total Imperial population in the Spinward Marches. What percentage of
*that* are they?

That\'s why it\'s unlikely to lead to a war. They are the equivalent of
half a dozen POWs from the US. Deplorable, but going to war would kill
more US troops simply from deloyment accidents, much less combat.

On the other hand, it gives a great excuse to play "Rambo" and try for
a rescue mission.

I have a dream... I have a dream of a program, a very nifty and useful
program that I would write -- if only I had any programming skills.  Sadly,
I have none, so I must ask for the assistance of the programmers on the
list...

On my Mac, I have an After Dark screensaver module called "Planetmaker" --
a very nifty fractal planet map generator.  I had plans to use it to
quickly generate realistic world maps for MTU.

Planetmaker\'s great, but unfortunately the resulting maps are rectangular
Mercator projections.  But a true Traveller map should of course be
icosahedral (i.e. Fuller dymaxion projections), I can\'t help wishing there
was some way to generate Planetmaker-style fractal maps in icosahedral
format.  Now wouldn\'t that be a cool program?

Failing this, it would be  almost as nifty to have a program which would
convert Mercator map images to icosahedral format (though I anticipate that
this might distort the image in an all-too-obvious manner).

Either way, the program should be able to generate maps with or without
overlaid hex grids (I don\'t find \'em entirely useful, myself), preferably
in postscript.

Of course, as a Mac addict, I would prefer to see Mac software, or
MRJ-compatible Java.

The ability to generate maps based on UWPs (or Hydrographic percentages at
least) would be a bonus, but not entirely necessary.   One could always
generate a bunch of maps and match them up with appropriate worlds.

Is there any chance some devoted TML programmer might be able to take on
such a project?  Or (dare I hope?) has some kind soul already done it?

Or am I just dreaming in holographic Technicolor?

Yours plaintively,

        Hi. Glenn!
        I know of one product that will do this...  it is currently in Beta.
It is by ProFantasy Inc, ("http://www.profantasy.com") and is called
_Fractal Terrains_.  They are going out of thier way to add UWP support in
it (mostly at my nagging).  Its a nice piece of kit that generates fully
developed worlds that can be projected onto several different layouts;
Mercator and much more.
        Unfortunately, TTBOMK there are no Mac plans...  however, most of
thier stuff is pretty well behaved under Virtual PC.

Another is:
(5) Oversized ARV (20 tons) is designed as a shell (well, doughnut) and lands

Applies to TNE only, and said ARV is detailed in the "Regency Combat Vehicle

Probably a nod and a wink to Thunderbird-2.

If you don\'t believe in the "C-V envelope" model, then use option 2. Land
"around" the AFV, clamp onto it, and take off again. You may decide that an AFV
that has crashed nose-down into the ground requires an initial jury-rigged lift
to haul it to a flatter area, then a re-clamping procedure to position it
correctly for the flight back to base.

Right, except that it was the 2nd Frontier War (615-620), not the 3rd.

You mentioned some sets were left and you would update your website.
However, you didn\'t tell us (those that don\'t have it saved somewhere)
what that address is. And the address is....

what format?  I have a character sheet that I created  for traveller in
lotus Wordpro.  I think it\'s still around.  Granted it does not support
any single Traveller edition but tries to be more of a generic sheet.  I
think I still have it around here.

	I could see this at about TL 8, but at slightly higher tech

Combine a practical, no-nonsense approach to science with such
theories...and the Zhodani seem nothing of not practical.

"When we zot a prole\'s brain like *this*, he stops behaving like *that*.
We will therefore zot like *this* all proles that behave like *that*."

Granted, the Zho\'s have been at this a long time. The zot in question
may be very fine tuned, very sophisticated, and very effective - and yet
show no necessry understanding of the multiple processes being affected.

I put forth the possibility of Heisenberg effects in psionic therapy 
techniques - that by the act of investigating, you change what is
investigated. A proficient Zho may be able to root around deep inside
a brain, but the mental processes she will be looking at will not
necessarily be the same processes that would be going on if she
were not poking around in there.

Then there may be adepts with lighter "touches" or who have developed
less invasive techniques - kind of like the rain forest biologist who studies
while suspended from a far-off crane, never stepping on what he\'s 
investigating. If these techniques take longer to learn, are harder to do,
and have less reliable results, they may only be practiced by scientists
who have some strange ideas about Proles as some kind of equals to
Citizens. Of course, some Nobles need mental help as well...

To whit: just as taming or changing a rain forest does not necessarily
show an understanding of it, taming or changing a human mind - especially
if something simple like "peacable prole" was the end result desired - 
does not necessarily show knowledge of said mind, nor even interest
in workings of said mind.

I\'m considering the example from the original Zho aliens supplement,
where all the changes to the prole in question involved acceptance and
passivity. Those seem much less complex responses than any kind
of dynamic personality aspects that would make a person dangerous,
disruptive, or even interesting. Take the complex, make it simple and
easy to manage.

The Proles get a "vote" by outnumbering the Nobles by several orders

do not overthrow the government.

All governments operate by consent of the governed. This consent may
be compelled by force, fear, or fraud, or gained through trust and good
stewardship, but the consent is still required. In the Zhodani society,
consent is in some ways impelled, by turning dissenters into supporters
whether the dissenter wants to or not.

Ever read John Christopher\'s "Tripods" series? Aliens come to Earth,
take over, and keep people in line by putting these mesh "caps" on
people, that keep their brains from thinking bad thoughts. The Zho\'s
make me think of that.

Except that jobs with that kind of stress levels probably aren\'t performed

Intendants, out there trying to prove themselves in Zho society, or by
the Nobles. These people have entirely different worldviews than the
simple ones allowed to the proles. and will have very different coping
mechanisms.

Gypsy again:

As suggested by the original Zhodani Module, this will often involve

"More readily" as in "in the way the Zho oligarchy wants him to deal
with it". Of course, that\'s what our societies intend with social 
conditioning, the benevolent Zho idea is that the Zho\'s are supposed
to have the information needed to be better at it.

The channels in the example all involved acceptance, passivity - 
simple responses, pretty much based on "THAT IS NOT A PROBLEM
TO YOU. IGNORE IT. BE HAPPY."

Yes, it may be very bad for the prole in the long run, he may even
stress himself to death trying to warp his brain around the commands
bolted onto his brain when he misbehaved. The prole will blow up by
dying...not by causing trouble. If keeping the proles from causing
trouble was the only intent, this is sufficient...if the Zho\'s have more
in mind, their Zot may get better.

The Zot may even obliterate those troublesome drives all together,
leaving some very peaceable, very boring sheep in human bodies
as subjects, and none of the dangerous venting you pointed out
in your post. You\'ll also never get a prole who does anything courageous,
or creative, or even very interesting, but that\'s OK - that\'s what Nobles
and Intendents are for.

There are plenty of high-stress jobs which are fairly meaningless and won\'t necessarily be done by Intendants or Nobles.  For example, firefighting.

Well, other solutions aren\'t impossible -- for example, convincing some loner who\'d be likely to go postal to get out, get a hobby, talk to people, etc...

Not that I don\'t think the Zhodani government is appalling ;)

Actually, by my reading of the character generation rules and source
material, most of the modern nobility got that way by inheritance.

Though all the existing canon doesn\'t explain why, given fairly easy
upward mobility, there are still proles left after a few thousand years.

Although I\'ve learned recently to reject the illusory value of
"interpretation" as practiced by whiny liberal pseudo-intellectuals, I
think we may have a case of it here.  I\'d read those examples as
describing how a prole was \'zotted\' to become more dynamic and active in
society, and begin engaging in life more fully.

How good/fast/easy-to-learn are ProFantasy\'s products anyway?

I have been thinking about buying them for a long time, but every time I
haven\'t, because I haven\'t really had a neutral opinion on the programs.

What I am looking for is a program that can help me design maps quite
quickly, but still with a nice-looking end result. I can live with
spending a few (or more) hours to learn to use the program, as long as
it\'s quick and easy to use once learned. I want to design maps for all

Will CC2 and the associated products meet my needs?

Have any of you _read_ the various Zhodani supplements?

What would be done with the poor b____d is that he\'d be moved into a job
more suited to his talents/limits. They\'re not bending peopel to fit the
job, but the jobs to fit the people.

There are people who are naturally more or less able to deal with stress;
they will be steered into the jobs that generate the stress. I can\'t think
of a job that someone, somewhere doesn\'t find enjoyable. In fact most
people going postal are due to the unresolved stresses of a life that
isn\'t suited for them. The job just tends to be the last straw.

The Zhodani mind control, other than described in Impy agitprop, isn\'t
oriented so much to coerce behavior, as to find the best fit between prole
and life. Think of it as extremely effective, cradle-to-grave
psychotherapy, without all the California-style psychobabble bs.

Where is it stated or implied that proles have a limited world view? They
are limited in the positions they can attain, but by the time they\'re
adults, they _know_ it\'s because of their inherent limitations, not that
they\'re being \'denied\' a chance. They _like_ what they\'re doing and how
they live.

Just to make things more interesting, it\'s probably a little bit of both -
thus the variance in interpretations.

The Zho nobles have decided what are appropriate avenues of expression
for proles, and make efforts to redirect the prole\'s interests and energies
into such avenues. A prole may be very active and dynamic, but all that
energy is carefully directed in directions that are harmless (or, more
likely, helpful) to the state, rather than in directions that may make 
the Nobles uncomfortable. Thus the prole will always be passive in
terms of the status quo, no matter how apparently active the person
may be.

Of course, more recalcitrant troublemakers may not have as much
energy or dynamism left once the Tvarchedl are done with them.

I think the original Zhodani aliens supplement mentioned something 
like the Zho were at once worse than the Imperials could imagine, and
better than any Imperial thought possible, both at the same time.
I like the idea of a human race being alien enough for that to be true.

I think there can be some interesting questions as to whether they
are right due to sufficient knowledge, or right due to sufficient power.
The presented results are hard to argue with, but the results do not
necessarily flow from the reasons given by the Zhodani government.

The answer is almost certainly a little bit of both. They know a lot,
but not as much as they think they do - and some of their theories, 
though certainly not all, work because they can *make* them work.

That is in direct opposition to the one example (from the Zhodani aliens
supplement) of how the Tvarchedl "helps" a dissatisfied prole. He isn\'t
re-evaluated and moved to another job, his current role is accepted as
the right one and he is adjusted to be happier in it.

I agree that the Zho should be better at putting people in jobs suited
to them. Now what happens when the needs of society (that is, the 
Nobles) doesn\'t require job types in the same proportions that people are
suited for? Do the Nobles change the list of needed jobs, or change
the people that are needed to do the job?

I think the truth is somewhere between "It\'s a round peg, we just need

peg, of course.

I\'ve always read the Tvarchedl\'s job as fixing people, instead of fixing 
people\'s lives. Of course, they are described as firefighters - they\'re
not handling the people who other arms of Zhodani gov\'t/society *did*
place properly in life, they\'re handling the ones that either needed
special help or are in some ways unhelpable.

Their limitations aren\'t inherent, their limitations are *imposed*. They
like what they\'re doing because the oligarchy wants them to like it,

I\'m not saying their society doesn\'t work, or is inherently evil. I don\'t
think I\'d want to live in it, and I\'d be leery of visiting it. I guess that
makes me a good Imperial citizen. :-)

My assumption was that the ARV would be the same TL as the disabled vehicle. 
However, it is certainly possible for a TL 8 society to buy some TL 10 grav 
tanks but rely on (cheap) TL 8 ARVs.

Note that a grav ARV doesn\'t actually have to land in order to recover 
another vehicle; this can be important in some situations.

A generous and sadistic GM,

That\'s why I changed it to "They"...  I originally put down "We."  However, 
it does substantially change the plot and themes of the story.  Not to

Going for broke with an answer then. Evolutionary rates of change don\'t
depend on time as such (we have been around unchanged for about 50,000
years - around 2,500 generations). What it depends on is the rate of change
of nuclotide structure and both the selection pressure and the evolutionary
pressure on the organisms concerned. Together with the generation rate of
the organism, that will give you a rate of change due to evolutionary
selection. If you are interested in the maths, its fairly simple and I\'m
sure you can get it from most biology books. If you just want an example,
one follows.

Assume the ship is from Earth to Alpha Centuri and travels at an average of
0.1c including acceleration and deceleration at either end of the trip (so
takes 40 years to make the journey). Forty years is less than two full
generations for humans so people will still be people when they get there -
they may be socially strange, but they will be biologically fine, even if
there are many mutations in the children. Remember too that most mutations
die in the womb, so there are more likely to be only a few fully human
children and perhaps one or two mutations than anything else. On the other
hand, the hydroponics tank has been growing vegetables for forty generations
(one per year) assuming they grow from harvested seed rather than seed
brought from Earth. If the mutation rate is 10% (and that is massive) then
in the second generation one plant in ten will be a freak. If the selection
pressure (how many of the "normal" plants die) is also a massive 10%, then
the number of freaks is near enough one in nine. Even with the 90% failure
rate for mutations (and that is a low number) then we have one successful
freak for every ninety plants.

By the third year, maybe 19% of the plants would be mutations - but they may
not be successful. The evolutionary pressure (the number of possible ways to
make food and breed successfully) will decide how many of these are going to
breed next time. If the pressure is a massive 25% (which means there had to
be a serious disaster on the ship) then we will have just short of 5% of the
plants in the third year as freaks. At the end of the trip, there will be
new breeds of vegetables on board - provided the humans don\'t interfere (fat
chance).

Now the interesting bit. Those forty years amount to 350,000 generations for
the bacteria on board - more for the viruses brought by "accident" in the
crew and plants. Given that the changing environment around the ship gives
more opportunities to the bugs to breed, selection pressure will be low. On
the other hand, having lots of places and creatures to breed in means that
evolutionary pressure will be large. With the increased mutation rate, there
is plenty of time to develop new species (rather than new breeds, like the
plants).

So, after forty years, the ship lands and sows the original 100 species of
plants plus around 40 new breeds that have developed on the ship.
Unfortunately, the Saline Nutrient bacterium that developed in the
hydroponics system appears to have taken well in the shallow seas of the new
planets as does the Duct Virus that developed on the large colonies of soil
bacteria, similar to the skin bacterium Staph Aureus, in the life support
plant. People are still suffering from the Ship Flu that swept through
passenger cargo section three a few years ago. There are no midget people,
winged men, talking flowers or any of the other things I suspect you want.
To get those, we need to move the people into the same position as the
bacteria and, based on known human speciation, we need a journey of
approximately 30,000 years to see much change.

Yea, that\'s what I meant.  Sorry, I was tired when I wrote that.   The
setting I have in mind is a colony ship that was lost by it\'s people.  The
party finds it and discovers a completely unique ecosystem on board.
Complete with dangerous microbes, sophist life forms and complex social
system.  The hydroponics has
gone so far out of control to have formed a soil layer on the deck and the
cold sleep for the wild life failed long enough ago to have allowed them to
have evolved into new species (SP?)

It\'s pretty unlikely that a generation ship would remain viable anywhere
near that long, however.

Granted this handwave is overused...but...Instead of a RoM ship, why not 
make it one Grandfather\'s ships?  It could then be built as big as you 
want, have all sort of interesting stuff in it, and considering that the 
BEM in charge of it was into genetics...well, you get the idea...

They might not send in the Drop Troops, but they would certainly hold an 
"unannounced fleet exercise" that happens to have most of the high profile 
subsector fleet assets involved...

You don\'t need to borrow.  Just let a bit of the fuel boil to fill
space.  The only upshot is that when the tanks are "empty" there will
be a small amount of residual hydrogen gas....

        Which would be worse than a waste of jump fuel.  Unless the
intention was to glass a couple of cities from orbit, no amount of
troopships and Tigresses are going to actually threaten any world worth
threatening.  I\'ve done the economics on it, and it is *heavily* in favor of
the defender.
        In fact, I think one of the biggest reasons the Villani were not
above glassing a rebellious or resistant world was that it was easier to do
that then take it in useable condition.  It also got the message out loud
and clear that "once usually means twice...  don\'t be twice...."

SNICKER!

I think I speak for all of us when I say that the State of Texas finds your
\'perdicament\' quite amusing.   : P

ObTrav (no, really!):  A tiny group of separatists, consisting mainly of
lunatic discontents, tax dodgers and self-taught lawyers, insist that the
treaties making their planet/nation/enclave part of the Imperium are
invalid.  They further insist they are the actual legitimate governing body
of their planet/nation/enclave, even to the point of setting up \'embassies\'
and generating official-looking red tape to back their claims.  They have
all granted themselves high ranking titles in this imaginary state (the
twitchy triggerman is the General of the planet/nation/enclave defense
force, their leader is the President/PM/Grand Poobah of the
planet/nation/enclave, etc).  They view the Imperium as a occupying \'foreign
power\', and are devilishly clever at using the 3I\'s own bureaucracy against
itself.  Despite causing millions/billions/trillions of credit fraud,
authorities are hampered in their efforts against these separatists because
_nobody_ takes them seriously.

The logical extension of this idea is the \'true\' imperial government,
claiming that Cleon\'s Articles of Restoration are invalid, and that they are
the _real_ Imperium.  Of course, in M:0, this might actually be arguable.

Whether Her Australian Magesty reigns or not is actually not an issue in terms
of Commonwealth membership. You can be a millitary dictator and stil have a seat
at CHOGM (Commomwealth Heads of Government Meeting). It was brought up in the
debate, but since South Africa, Malaysia, Singapore and others do not have QEII
as head of state, it is a bit rich.I personally was of two minds on the
republic, as I was loath to loose all the cool imperial monikers and pagents.

In reality, the Commonwealth of Nations is a club where Englqand and the anglo
colonies  (SA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand) dance in glee that they are
not Americans, and the other commonwealth nations blast them for imperialism.


OB Trav: Planetary gvernments do not have to be an issue for Imperial Membership
as well. Remember most of the imperial states where conquered or colonised from
colonial states. Some states would have also asked to be admitted. All planets
(and sub planet governments) could have (and do) have any political system under
the sun as long as they toe Imperial polacy and pay the taxes. The commonwealth
is actually a good base to work out how the Imperial system works.

what format?  I have a character sheet that I created  for traveller in
lotus Wordpro.  I think it\'s still around.  Granted it does not support
any single Traveller edition but tries to be more of a generic sheet.  I
think I still have it around here.

In the GT books there are frequent references to a particular restaurant
chain that claims to have a location in each and every starport in the
Imperium, plus several outside it (Solomani Confederacy? Frontier worlds?)
and on many worlds themselves. Their logo looks suspiciously like that
of a well-known chain on contemporary Terra, but cut in half with a
stylized rocketship superimposed on it... so that it kind of looks like
the letter A, for "Astroburger". It\'s becoming a running gag in my own
Traveller game as the players realize that Astroburger is *everywhere*...

Any other examples?

  You may be using an over-simplification from your TCS experience, where
all of the other powers combined (a somewhat laughable concept, that one)
only muster about a 6:1 superiority, or less after subtracting non-Jump
mobile assets.

  Each Imperial sector fleet should average at least ten times the budget
available to a single Hi-Tech/Hi-Pop world, and that assuming that it both
maintains substantial assets of its own, and that the colonial sub-sector 
fleet goes over to it en masse. Not that there aren\'t real problems with
the generation system that gives those results, but that\'s another thread.

There\'s also apparently a lot of material in Travellers\' Digest #13 and #14,
which may be "forbidden canon" but which I should probably be aware of.
At the very least I don\'t want to invalidate any of it.

Another thing which might be helpful is the extended Law Level tables
from the hardbound Milieu 0 campaign book.  There are so many
totalitarian planets on the Rim that I\'m having a hard time making
creative distinctions between all of them.

If anyone is willing to make "fair use" copies of any of these items for
me, I\'d appreciate it greatly -- and I\'d also be glad to reimburse reasonable
costs.

Thanks.

What, did you miss the AAFES posts from July 1999?  (The premise was
that the Army & Air Force Exchange System [AAFES] established
shoppettes, Anthony\'s Pizzas, and other facilities on various
Terran-occupied worlds during the IW period, these facilities evolving
into a chain of 4-star restaurants by the 3I.)

	At a certain point, making the simple (and brutal) technique more
effective require a better understanding of what\'s being mangled. You
can go so far with the Brute Force approach, each level requiring more
and more energy (Psi Strength), then one of the "Adjusters" takes a
second look at an "Unrecoverable" prole, and in a burst of creativity
discovers a second method of rewiring the brain. 
	Depending upon how much of a Feudal Technocracy ITU the Zho\'s are would
determine how far repeated applications of this algorithm will go. My
guess is the Zho\'s have an extremely good understanding of a narrow set
of brain patterns. The Zho\'s initial education system fixes what would
be a large number of variables in the prole\'s brain patterns. This is
also what irritates most Zhodani travelling in the Imperium, they can
read minds, but not understand the problems.

How many does it take? Are one million POWs worth going to war for?
One hundred thousand? One? Where do you draw the line?

I missed the original post, so forgive me if this has been mentioned
before.

Why not have the recovery vehicle\'s crew simply attach portable antigrav
units to the downed vehicle. Use these units to get the vehicle floating
again, and have them slaved to the recovery vehicle. Then just tow the
vehicle home.

Apparently the "Republican Issue" isn\'t quite over yet... it is still open
for debate and election issues in the future with members of near *all* the
political parties split on the subject.  Interestingly enough, our Queen has
nothing against us spreading our wings and leaving the Monarchy.

This may not sound the very best on my behalf, but I couldn\'t see a reason
to become a republic and don\'t care one way or the other.  As I understand
it, the referendum was lost because the template was for a "President" that
was elected by a few Aussie citizens (the politicians currently in power)
and not by a majority vote of the people.  But my reason for a no vote?  So
far, this has cost the Australian people over $2.5 million already!  Upon a
successful Republican vote it is estimated that the actual changeover costs
would be a further $7 million plus!!

Now call me foolish if you like, but I live in a city (town actually, but
hey) that the local hospital is so inadequately underfunded that there is
not a week that it is not mentioned in the local/state media somewhere, and
all it needs to become safe and workable again is a mere $0.5 million.  Then
there are things like schools (I am a father of 4) that would do well with a
small slice of this money too, not to mention roads, social security,
pensions, medical groups, research, etc.

Australia\'s head of state is the Queen of England.  Australia is self
governing however.  We do not pay taxes to the Royal Family or the U.K., we
decide to war or not war on behalf of the Queen (or the Americans for that
matter), she or her cabinet CANNOT compel Australia do this, nor can it make
Australia do ANYTHING Australia does not wish to do.  We get no aide from
the U.K., nor will we if we become a Republic.  Is there a special reason
for becoming a Republic other than cutting the "apron strings" which are
cosmetic anyway and do not do anything special in reality?

But more importantly to me... is there a way of becoming a Republic without
cost to the citizens/public?  Is this the sort of question that should be
asked of a [majority of] people that has already done so (their country
already become a Republic) of it\'s own accord, but for very different
reasons (taxes as opposed to prestige)?

ObTrav:  Will the Imperium take by force any system that wishes to leave
it\'s fold?  Are the systems that as independent, would still hold close ties
to the Empire and not be subject to force of compliancy?  Is there anything
canon about such worlds/systems?

That, sir, depends on whether you have read, and agree with, _Starship
Troopers_.

I suspect that the Emperor and his advisors have not attended History
and Moral Philosoph classes under LtCol DuBois et al, so I would expect
the Imperium to consider a relative handful of PWs as a regrettable
circumstance, rather than as a _casus belli_.

As far as mounting a rescue mission goes, that would depend on at least
these two factors:

1.  Where are the PWs being held?

2.  How many PWs are being held there?

Given that "Colonel de Bessier maintains that from 2,000 to as many as
10,000 Imperial personnel are held at a number of locations within the
Zhodani Consulate, and that seven of these locations have been
\'positively identified\'", I would expect that no rescue effort short of
all-out invasion would be able to retrieve more than a handful of these
PWs.  IMHO, it would be highly improbable that a successful rescue
mission could be mounted on any site deeper than 5-6 parsecs inside
Zhodani space.

Of course, humans have the amazing ability to confound those who say
something is impossible/improbable....

Correct. There is a BIG difference between a tank retriever and a tank 
transporter. A retriever tows, and a transporter (usually unarmored) carries 
(think a truck -- semitrailer lowboy rig like they use to transport heavy 
construction equipment). For grav AFVs; I agree that the two functions would 
be combined as it\'s a HELL of a lot easier to just carry the damn thing...

Part of that will depend on the original stock from which the race would
develop.  Using primates as an example, it would take much longer for
prosimians, such as lemurs, to develop into a sentient species than for
apes, such as gibbons or orangutans.

Since there are, AFAIK, no current reptiles that are more intelligent
than lemurs, I would expect at least 50 million years of evolution to be
required to develop a sentient reptilian race from current Terran
stock.  OTOH, given that some dinosaurs are said to have been as
intelligent as some apes, a sentient species could evolve from some of
the smarter dinosaurs in just a few million years.

Of course, given higher mutation rates than those found on Earth
(reasonably plausible on a generation ship), plus greater evolutionary
pressures (again, plausible on a relatively small, tight habitat such as
a generation ship), you could see a sentient species arise from a
relatively smart dinosauroid in maybe one million years or less.

My recommendation, if you want these reptilian sophonts to be of
original Terran stock, is to have them transplanted onto the ship by a
race that predates the Ancients by 60 million years or so, who would be
as much of a mystery to the Ancients (based on recovered fragments of
Ancient records) as the Ancients are to us.

If, OTOH, the original stock is unimportant, find an out-of-the-way
world that could support large lifeforms except for an atmospheric
taint, create a species that almost fits your needs (but is _not quite_
sentient), and have the ship be built by a now-dead race from that world
(that killed itself [and nearly everything else]) off with a virulent
bioweapon (the taint in question).  Your new race would evolve from a
clever beast that had some utility for the shipbuilder\'s race (beast of
burden, menial laborer, or what have you).  This allows you to introduce
not only a new sophont race, but also any alternative tech that you want
your players to find.

Obviously, the derelict ship in question would have to be large enough,
or automated enough, to support a pre-technological race in sufficient
numbers to allow the new race to develop.  As a wild guess, I would
think that you would need to support a population of two or three
million Saurians, since (having evolved on the ship) they would not have
easy access to the technological knowledge databases of the ship\'s
builders (who died out on the ship due to whatever handwave you choose).

Of course, you could also have your reptilian sophonts _be_ the
previously-thought-extinct race from the previously-mentioned now-dead
world.  In that case, even a few thousand years might suffice for them
to lose most of their technological knowledge.  As you said, they might
worship the auto-repair systems, that allow the ship to sustain them
without their own repair efforts.  If the ship is large enough, they can
even fragment into different tribes (based, perhaps, on the systems
found in the portions of the ship they occupy), with trade and/or
warfare between different tribes.  FWIW, this is my recommendation for
your new species.  They may no longer know that they are on a spaceship,
or that there was a world on which they evolved.  In fact, since all
other lifeforms on the ship would be from their native planet, they may
believe that they, and all other life aboard the ship, evolved on the
ship.

For some hints on how a reptilian sophont species might behave, check
out Harry Turtledove\'s "Worldwar" tetralogy....

One of Traveller\'s shortcomings is that while it borrowed the idea of
"Forerunners" from Norton and others, they made them a *single*
civilization. Norton handles the concept the best with the term being
rather generic and applying to *any* interstellar capable civilization
that was gone before any of the currently exist ones arrived on the
scene. This gives you civilizations running from ones that vanished
only a little before her Zacathans hit the scene (around 10k years
back) to ones that vanished hundreds of thousands of years ago. 

So you can\'t get bored, because you\'re dealing with cultures that were
widely seperated in time, space, or both. And that were very
*different* from each other.

Ha! Good question! It\'s a damn shame that there is no simple answer. Styles
can change quickly (even in pre-industrial societies). I mean, I could
rattle off the styles for quite some time that appeared from the Renaissance
to the modern day, and there would still be dozens, if not scores, that I\'d
be leaving out... and that would just be in the West!

Answering a question like "What do Vilani paintings look like?" is like
answering the question "What do Terran paintings look like?" There are few
similarities between cubism, pointilism, and neo-classicism, for example.
The same goes for other forms of art as well... sculpture, architecture,
fashion design, industrial design (compare the Atari 2600 to the Nintendo
64, for example, or a stereo made circa 1973 to one made in 1984 to one made
today), poetry, literature, film, theater...

My head is spinning.

Okay.

I did a piece for the Traveller culture list concerning one style of Vilani
painting, which I can try to dig up, and I\'ve got a few various tidbits of
cultural flavor on my webpage at http://www.pil.net/~semo , there\'s quite a
bit on the state of the Vilani music scene in the early 1100s.

There was a RICE paper article that detailed Aslan "Trokh Ofera" <sp>, Aslan
"talk opera". All in all a nifty idea. There was also a JTAS that detailed
K\'Kree scent-sculptures as part of an adventure. I\'m sure that there are
many more that I\'m forgetting.

Okay, one off the top of my head:

Darmine Experiential Animation: A style once popular in the Darmine
Corporate during the long night, which has been acquiring some degree of
popularity in Daibei recently (circa 1105). An experiential animator will
connect to a device that keeps track of his pulse, body temperature,
movements, etc. and will use a special "keyboard" that allows him to express
concepts quickly that words cannot express (all manner of sensations). He
will then take / use / imbibe a mind-altering substance of some sort. A
special computer and software will transform the data it receives into
animation.

It\'s not terribly fleshed out. I\'d like to give it a little more in the way
of history, and I would like to give it one or more movements as well. It\'s
based on Leary and Alpert\'s "Experiential Typewriter."

This brings me to my next point: I\'m on Bruce Sterling\'s "Dead Media"
mailing list. The posts are very infrequent, *but* the collected notes are
an excellent resource for would be world builder types. I have the collected
notes from at least a year ago, if you poke around you should be able to
find a meatier file. There are plenty of interesting things in there that
you can graft into your Traveller universe.

Also as far as art work goes I think the Zhodani would have a cool

you can do what I did for a Mage (tm) with an artist who had mind 
read/control.  His art respondant to the viwer.  So lets say its a sea 
painting and the viwer thought of a stormy sea.  The art would 
change to a stormy sea.  Though in this case the artist would have

to satisfy the last wish of his father\'s human consort, and to maintain the
honour of his clan



 Now I have an idea for a Traveller story for that collection of Martin\'s

Take the Tavershedzle (sp?)... they don\'t look so much for the unhappy, as
those who are leaning towards ciminality. There is a reference to "unhapy"
zhodani... and being unhappy is NOT grounds for reducation, unless such
unhappiness is leading one to criminality. The big difference socially is
that the mental processes leading to ciminal beahviour are themselves the
crime. The term is translated erroneously to "Thought Police", the text
defines it as "Guardians of Our Morality", and defines the role in that
light. They find those who are a-moral or immoral, by zhodani standards,
and (forcibly, if needed) help them build a moral code in line with
standard Zhodani ethical standards. Note also that even nobles are subject
to re-education, by the standard techniques.

Also, the definitions of Crimes in the Consulate are very different: Crimes
of neglect, Crimes of Passion, and Crimes of Insanity. The former are
usually fines, lest you commmit them repeatedly or REQUEST reeducation on
them. Crimes of Passion are seen as temporary breaks of self-control due to
unusual stress, and are punished with reparitions and counselling,
sometimes reeducation into a new situation (Read job & location) where such
stresses are less likely. Crimes of insanity are all other crimes... the
thought processes which result in the criminal intent are edited out, and
new methods found to deal with such stresses....

See "Lacy and His Friends", IICR by M Lackey, for an example of rediredtion
of abberant impulses in a non-psionic but very nearly Zhodani society...
Lacy must masturbate, when he gets his abberant behavioural impulse (He was
a rapist); Lacy\'s rewiring includes not being able to get an errection with
a female nearby, and IIRC, even outside the appropriate locations.

The material in Adv 0 also jives with the "Benevolent Tavrshedzle" mode...
but is vague enough not to conflict with either mode.

 Well, not in the past month. I have not internalized the G:T
book because I found things I plain hate, but I have done a
great deal of thinking about the Zhodani since becoming
the HIWG Sector Analyst (retired) for two Zhodani sectors
and helping on two others in the six+ years since.

 This sort of activity has long been part of my take on the Tavrchedl\', 
actually, but I was specifically responding to the Brain Stamp theory.
 Before he left the hobby, an old friend and fellow Zhodani enthusiast and I 
posited the existence of a branch of the Tavrchedl\' that redirected the 
perpetually square-peg proles they found into fruitful work _somewhere_, 
often beyond the Consulate entirely. The Zhodani, through the efforts of the 
Tavrchedl\' and others, are very good at career placement when they have the 
manpower to do so. There are limits, however. A particular world economy may 
not have the wiggle room to shift everyone to jobs where they would be 
happiest, so adjusting the person instead is going to be a common occurance.

 To answer the obvious question, I am a "benevolent" Zhodani proponent. Such 
is required to have a functional society over six thousand years. The 
"malevelant" brain-sucking, Prole-enslaving Zhodani model is a good one for 
raw Space Opera enemies (who won\'t last more than a generation or two) 
because it is ideally suited to the "war-machine disguised as a functional 
society" type of state. If someone wants to use the Zhodani for that in their 
game that\'s fine, but don\'t try to convince me that it\'s true in the OTU.

IMTU, they\'d not only hold those fleet excercises in orbit, but would have
the marines ready to drop, as well as sending a team of nobles, with
huscarles, to "Visit the Local Noble", and defend the starport. Also, the
local "Imperial Forces" (IE, locally raised troops subject to imperial
activation) would be activated and shipped elsewhere for the duration. And
a team of diplomats would remind the government that withdrawl means an
absolute interdict.

If they DO withdraw peacefully, they merely get interdicted... The navy and
marines evacuate all who wish to leave, and take over the starports. Anyone
leaving gets informed that the trip out is one way. All extraplanetary
(Inlcuding in-system) trade gets supressed. The military personell shipped
elsewhere are informed they may not return home. The navy shoots down
blockade runners. Marine drops assault anybody who DOES make it through, as
soon as they are found. And the local noble is "Protected" by his
Huscarles, and imperial forces, to await the re-entry petition.

If they Withdraw by force, they lose all industrial bases, all who take up
arms are barred from imperial citizenship, but still considered subjects.
The marines impose martial law. The navy wipes out all satellite systems.
The iron fist cranks down on EVERYONE on-world... those wishing to flee had
better be able to prove off-world connections (or citizenship); in which
case they will be excorted off from the starports, much like above. And a
full interdict for the duration of the "insurrection", much as above.

In either case, the local noble gets protected. He\'s the escape route for
the government... he\'s the one they petition to to get off planet. And, for
the duration, the Navy keeps his hold well stocked, and recieving
goodies... and smugglers get the 4mm Gauss to the back... Tours (of
disarmed locals) are often set up, just to remind everyone how much better
it was. Anyone entering the estate gets searched and disarmed, with a no
punishment, and no return of contraband, policy. Come and see how the
Imperials live... Price: lose any weapons you might be carrying, and exit
with only clothes...

	Interesting. According to alien module 4, the very idea of 
	keeping people in prison appears to be quite foreign to the 
	Zhodani. With psionic interrogation and re-education techniques 
	they have no need to keep prisoners, and it would be more 
	practical to deport all those "dead-brain" Imperial EPWs after 
	the war.

	It is more likely that colonel Ruys de Bessier is deliberately 
	spreading false anti-zhodani propaganda to get excuse for 
	another war. This is the way the Evil Imperium has been working 
	for ages.

	This could be a basis for a espionage/rescue adventure, where 
	the "rescuers" find out that they have been duped by false 
	propaganda and there is nothing to be rescued. They have just 
	killed large number of Zhodani children and senior citizens for 
	no reason, and would now like to have a long private 
	conversation with a certain imperial intelligence officers.

I haven\'t seen this answered (except by people suggesting it was a Star

Shodani have 3 "Castes", the upper and lower being Nobles and Proles, both
of which have multiple social strata. The third caste, the intendants, is a
middle caste, composed of born intendants and those prole children adopted
into noble families due to high psionic potential. This third caste, can,
if enough merit is shown, be promoted to the nobility. Prole children with
high psionic potential become proles. By inference, one can assume
non-heirs of the nobility might also revert to intendant status.

The Nobility are policed by themselves, and also by the Tavershedzle. Note
that not all psionicists can shield; telepaths can, but non-telepaths
cannot. The Tavershedzle tend to draw from the intendant caste. The
Tavrshedzle are almost entirely telepaths of some level. All intendants and
nobles are psionically trained. Promotions appear to be based upon Job
Performance Merit, rather than Psionic merit. The worst case would be a
block of Tavrshedzle rebelling, but in general, the result would be much
like any "Noble Revolt" anywhere else... the other nobles would put it down
with a fury. Also note that zhodani do know about artificial psionic
shielding, and much better than imperial techs do at same tech level; they
use it  for switches by TL 12! so they could quite easily send in forces
with shields once they suspect a revolt. Additionally, should a higher
noble arrive and publicly announce the "relief due to needing treatment" of
a rebellious noble, the populace would likely believe it, and do everything
possible to see to it he was cured.

Also note that, despite propaganda, Psionics play little in the day to day
life of Proles. Proles, even if not happy, know that they can become happy
upon request. They have no stigma against mental illness, a much better
understanding of the pathology, and how to treat (if not cure) most mental
illnesses; also, they have a much more liberal definition of a mental
illness than most of us on the list.

BTW, the example on page 14 of AM4-Zhodani notes the following (post
pick-up by the TP):
	"A few days later, the Prole returns home, much happier. His new
job is exactly what he needs and wants; a perfect outlet for his ambitions.
His successful neighbor, he now knows, leads a shallow life without the
enjoyment and fulfilment that it should have. The world itself seems
brighter and clearer."
	This pattern seems to indicate a number of things happened during
his stay with the reeducators:
1)	placed into a job better suited to his temperment and abilities (if
not existing skills)
2)	purged of jealousy via "programming"
3)	probable surgical and/or chemical alteration of any underlying
depression or anxiety disorders,
4)	the Prole is reassured that SOCIETY CARES enough to want to see him
well.

also mentioned on p14 is that the "... result is excellent diagnosis and
careful treatment in reeducation centers. When treatment is complete, the
individual rejoins society without any stigma or blot on his record..."

Not particularly likely... there is no evidence of "sustained phenomena" in
the rules norr in canon, nor is there any evidence of direct psionically
active hardware (with the possible exception of Virus, but that\'s for
another day/flame-war). Mage assumes you change the collective reality;
Psionics in traveller are merely "as yet unproven quantum-physics
macro-effects"[1]. At best, a noble or intendant might share his conception
of the finished sculpture to Prole Artisans, and have them do the labor...

[1] well, not exactly "as yet unknown". A recent study (replicated at least
once) showed that human desire for a particular direction of result from a
computerized random number generator can in fact skew the results. on a
1-200 scale, it swung the results by 10 points in the desired direction
(mean went from 100 to 110 when high was desired, from 100 to 90 when low
was desired). Line of sight was not required. Range was not tested
thoroughly, but exceeded 250m. It is the first study to have been
replicated that showed discernable psionic phenomena. Even the Amazing
Randi has yet to be willing to address the study, in whole or in part,
publically. Have seen the study cited in 4 different shows, including
Discover Magazine (the TV Programme).

... once they manage to get out of Zhodani-controlled space undetected.
Some passing noble might notice their stress (by psionic means), and
later decide to investigate. By that time, the PCs ship has already left
the planet, but it\'s not too far gone. Will the PCs make a run for it?
Will they be successful?

And if they are caught, will they be exectuted? Probably not, but they
just might find themselves with a strong love for all things Zhodani.

As a spokesman for the Consulate, I feel that it is important for me to
point out that our borders are open to all Imperial citizens, as long as
they have no hostile intent. It is entirely possible that what you call
"POWs" are, in fact, defectors. Since our two civilizations have met we have
seen many such defectors, many more than your government would admit to.
Your intelligence agencies may be confused, or they may be working from
superannuated data. Of course, there\'s the possibility that they may be
deceiving you deliberately.

To the "benevolent Zhodani" camp: are the Zho\'s warm and understanding
psychotherapists to their loving proles, and evil mind-rapers to outsiders?

They get to manipulate the proles for life. They only get a short time to
deal with outsiders, and these outsiders will have weirder brains.
Maybe the Zho\'s can\'t use subtle, "nice" techniques when re-educating
Imperials or others who haven\'t been acculturated to Zho ways...and
maybe the Zho\'s see such insane barbarians as lower life forms, with
brains that don\'t matter much anyway.

Thus the Zho government wouldn\'t see anything wrong with using
the PC\'s as mind-altered weapons against the Imperial intelligence
agency that sent them, for example, but wouldn\'t *think* of using
one of their beloved proles that way.

Adventure seed: a Zho telepath with unusual ideas sneaks out of the

in a new age of enlightened re-education in Zhodani society. Her chosen

	That\'s not a bad description, but just to clarify: organic
	evolution can be defined as a change in gene frequency over
	time. It\'s "rate" may be defined in a number of ways, but
	the most useful here would be the change in the average value
	of a given trait (such as the length of the legs) in a
	given time span (say 100 years). This rate will depend on the
	strength of natural selection (how strong is the relationship
	between the trait and the organism\'s ability to reproduce?)
	,the genetic variance of the trait (how much variation is
	there in that trait that is caused by genes?), and the
	generation time (how many generations have passed in the 100
	years?).

	A note about mutations: on average, each human on Terra has
	about two new mutations. That is, it has been estimated that
	each of us (on average) has two detectable genes that are
	different than any that our parents had. Even without
	considering this source of genetic variation, virtually every
	trait that has been studied has had at least some genetic
	variation, that is when artificial selection has been imposed
	evolution has occured.

	One generation per year sounds pretty low, depending on
	the plant. If I wanted carrots out of my hydroponics,
	I would choose fast-growing varieties and manipulate
	conditions so that there were far shorter generations
	(perhaps as low as a month with constant light, ideal
	temperatures, etc.).

	Of course, the ship may have unusually high radiation
	or chemical mutagen levels for one reason or another, but
	evolution is not thought to proceed by large mutations that
	produce "freaks." The generally accepted view is that small
	variations in traits are favoured incrimentally. Note that
	this mechanism has been observed in the lab to produce
	rates of evolution far higher than those observed in the
	fossil record.

	If we are dealing with a major mutation, the important
	factor will be whether it is any better than it\'s buddies
	at reproducing. Major mutations are considered unlikely to
	have such an advantage, but perhaps one could be invoked
	to make one of the new species that the GM wants.

	Perhaps Darwin\'s most important observation was that many
	more organisms are produced than can possibly survive. If you
	mean by a "pressure" of 25% that 25% of the plants die, then
	I would suggest that mortality is unusually low. Typically,
	the vast majority of offspring that plants produce never live
	to maturity. You are quite correct, however, that the level
	of mortality is important: high mortality is a good
	opportunity for selection to act. As for the humans
	interfering, I don\'t think that there were any left alive
	on the ship.

	The distinction between species and breeds is difficult to
	make in many organisms, particularly bacteria. Nevertheless,
	it is true that bacteria would have plenty of opportunity to
	evolve.

	I hate to stick in the Ancients all over the place, but

	on a non-Ancient ship. As for time to evolve intelligence,

	Certainly evolution works with what you\'ve got to start with.
	If there was a relatively intelligent reptile on board to

	I\'m not sure I follow here. With minimal handwaving, I would

	(or even less, if you really had to). I can imagine rather

Even more amusingly, the rescuers locate the world upon which the "PoWs" are
being "held" and discover that they are indeed former Imperial combatants
but that they are now *voluntarily* living as good Zhodani proles having
"seen the light" and defected to the obviously superior society of the
Consulate.  They will obviously resist strongly any attempts to forcibly
return them to the 3I.

That should keep both the anti and the pro-Zho camps on the list happy.  I
hope ;-)

Of course, the Imperium doesn\'t have the Bill of Rights.  The moment these
guys announced they weren\'t part of the Imperium, they\'re open to having a
platoon of Marines drop in for a chat.  Survivors to be tried for sedition.

Trust me, you wouldn\'t lose them all.. we threw out the monarchy over
two-hundred years ago, and we\'re still obsessed witht he Royal family.

That would mean someone has got to write it...  I\'m still busy with two
zines (Vanguard Dossier, as reviewed in CBG #1000, is being resurrected
and APA-Dimentia has passed from First Writer of Ket to the infamous
Tiamat) and the Sime~Gen in Japan stories that Jean encouraged me to
write!

Hmm... Hiroshi does purr... I have always liked cats...  I wonder if I
would be compatible with an Aslan in some TU somewhere???

But isn\'t it barbed?

(I wouldn\'t be interested in the comfy shoes type of Aslan...)

Well, the Imperium isn\'t hampered in it\'s actions like the FBI
is...notice...those folks in Montana held out a long time, the ones in
Texas folded the second that the Texas Rangers were sicced on \'em ;-)

If they\'re causing m/b/trillions of credit fraud, that\'s a direct
interference with interstellar trade, and they can expect their compound
to be softened up with a few dozen orbital deadfall strikes followed by
the usual mopping up action by the Imperial Marines.

If they\'re dispersed, well the IISS Intelligence service steps in, and
they just vanish one day.

People _do_ tend to take fraud seriously.

Not to rain on your parade, but I read this list precisely, among 
other things, to forget that there is people out there who choose to 
be soldiers and are ready to kill those of us who choose peace. You 
are entitled to your opinions, but I find this kind of things 
(specially when they are so long and band-wasting) barely appropriate

This is totally off the primary topic of this thread, but the "ubiquitous
weapons brand" idea reminded me of something.

In Greg Bear\'s _Eternity_, part of the story is set on a parallel Earth
where Alexander lived to a ripe old age, consolidating his conquests into
a stable empire.  By the present day, the Greek-Egyptian empire rules most
of the world.

At one point in the story, there is an offhand reference to a group of
palace security troups carry Judaean submachine guns.  It took me a second
to get it, then I laughed out loud.  I guess some things are constant
across all the multiverse...

Sounds alot like a ST:TNG episode (forget the name but I think it
was a two-parter) where  Klingon  POWs  were  living  with  their
Romulan captors.

Many worlds in the Imperium have low tech levels, but will see a need
to buy higher-tech defensive equipment, at steep prices. There\'s
really no point in building TL 6 tanks, if your most probable opponent
will be landing TL12+ grav vehicles from space...it would be better
for you to buy some TL 12+ grav vehicles, at least more than you 
expect a corsair, raider or star viking to bring with them. 

(Of course, this only applies if your world is unified and relatively stable.
If you\'re balkanized or have significant insurgents, build what you can
and buy what you can.)

You would build support equipment at the local tech level, if possible. 
A TL7 truck with a crane and a lowboy trailer could probably recover a 
disabled grav vehicle, as could a TL 7 heavy-lift helicopter or even a 
zeppelin. Such vehicles might have a problem keeping up with grav 
formations, but will cost a lot less to build and maintain and may be
easily convertable from what you\'re generally using locally for cargo 
transport.

The image of a cargo zeppelin recovering a disabled grav APC is 
somewhat appealing to me for some reason.

Reference the local support of the Allied war effort in the Burma-Indochina
theater of war during World War II. Airfields were created and maintained 
entirely through hand labor, as no bulldozers could be brought  to many 
sites. Some downed aircraft were recovered, at least for parts, by use of 
elephants or other beasts of burden.

Last night I was thumbing through my GURPS Traveller books and for the 
"first" time noticed the 48-ton grav lifter in Far Trader. While designed to 
carry cargo containers at a starport, it has the lift to carry half the 
vehicles in Star Mercs.

I\'ve done some work on a larger, military version (GTL 10, 200 ton lift, 
enclosed two-man crew). It is actually cheaper than the 48-ton grav lifter 
(which is GTL 8). However, it has a very poor Health (6), even with the 
heaviest frame available (I may just have to add a large amount of empty 
space to make the body more robust).

As the original poster:

Yes, this was one of my options (mainly if the CG units were destroyed or 
badly damaged). If the disabled vehicle\'s CG units were still functional, 
you could run a power cable from the recovery vehicle to the disabled 
vehicle to power them (you would, of course, still need a tow cable or bar 
or hitch). The problem arises when the vehicle is damaged to the point where 
it may break up if you tried towing it.

Current recovery vehicles are also designed to do repairs in the field 
(changing engines, gun barrels, etc.). That is, an ARV is supposed to fix a 
vehicle in the field if it can, tow it back to a repair base if it can\'t. A 
vehicle designed solely to lift a disabled vehicle (and not repair it) is 
not very cost effective, unless you have only a few issued per army and use 
normal ARVs for the bulk of recovery/repair work.

Dev Landrel is a Close Encounter in an early JTAS

I\'m in the process of getting my version of a Vilani lexical database sent
to Jeff Zeitlin, who is going to do something unspeakably technical to it
and combine it with some others that we\'ve been working on.  Something
should be available in a week or so with a good 1600+ entries.  Keep in

Seth, I think that you and I are largely in agreement,
at least as stated in the second sentence.  I
disagree, however, that

In fact, what ordinary people were doing, were wanting
to do, were lacking, etc., is the necessary background
to understanding the leaders themselves at any given
point in time.  To take an example from way back in
time, Moses may have convinced Pharoah to free the
slaves, but the slaves themselves were of substantial,
if not critical, importance to the Egyptian economy --
which was at least one reason for Pharoah to harden
his heart against letting the people go.

So that\'s what armies are for. Wow! It\'s true, you do learn something new

I\'m confused. Is it inappropriate because it glorifies violence-which never
happens in any traveller universe-or because it has a subtle nod to
patriotism and nationalism?

Well, the Imperium is of course a crazy hodge-podge of
local laws, so anything can happen on member states. 
Imperial law in my Traveller universe has two major
divisions, general laws and the laws applicable only
to Imperial nobles.  Everybody -- commoners, nobles,
and corporations -- is subject to the general laws. 
The laws applicable only to nobles include special tax
reporting, regulation of styles of address, sumptuary
laws, etc.  

So in my Traveller universe, if the Duke and a
commoner conspired to steal from the Emperor, they
would both be guilty of lese-majeste and conspiracy to
commit theft.  The prosecutor would likely also charge
them with treason, but I\'m not sure that charge would
stick; it would depend on what they were stealing, and
for what purpose.  (The Imperial Sceptre:  treason for
sure; a hand-made jewel-encrusted gold dining table
commissioned by the Emperor from artisans on Menorb: 
probably not treason.)

Do a web search for Elf SSternberg. He\'s a rather well known net
personality. And his series "the Journal Entries" is most definitely
not within the guidelines for Traveller. :-)

But they are still worth reading.

Probably not, on the other hand, consider an alternate timeline where

Please... all of you... no flames. I started (well, it takes at least
two people, but...) a h#ll of a flamewar last time I was subscribed to
this list, and I would hate to see another war break out here, now that
I have finally returned. As some who were subscribed during that war
might recall about me, I would like to say a thing or two about this
thread.

I don\'t.

I have decided to keep my opinions to myself, and to keep my posts as
on-topic as possible (or, occassionally, at neutral, fun topics ;-)

I suggest that everyone does the same.

I should note here that the whole idea just rose my hackles. The idea
of thousands of POWs being held after a war is over just ticks me off.
This is despite the fact that these POWs are imperials and I am of
course a loyal solomani. ;-)

Any confusion is purely on your part. Carlos made it perfectly clear what it
was about the post that he objected to. A further note: violence never
actually happens in the Traveller Universe, as it is complete and total
fiction. Violence - that which leaves mothers crying for their children, and
that which leaves young men who have barely lived their lives screaming,
dying, cold and afraid with their entrails steaming in the mud - only
happens in the real world.

Have you forgotten flick-switches? You could have an "active painting" that has
these in the back, set to change the painting\'s colours. An art event could
include visitors as active participants, each trying to set the painting up in a
certain way, with the resultant jumble of colours becoming the final work.

Zhodani "Blue Poles", anyone??

Now all you need is an Imperial museum that decides to buy the work for some
ridiculous amout of money, with the PC\'s sent to transport the painting across
the border (not knowing about the highly illegal flick switches built into the
thing), with rich Impy art collectors sending art pirates after them, etc etc...

Sounds like an adventure to me!

The series you\'re referring to is called The Starlost, a Canadian-produced
series from around 1973. It was awful. (Most Canadian-produced TV was awful
back then...).  The series was about three young people aboard a great big 
huge starship, Earthship Ark, which was sent into space in response to some 
kind of disaster back on Earth (I\'m not sure we ever find out just what kind 
of disaster it was.) The ship consisted of several dozen "biospheres" all
connected to a central "core" shaft that was probably at least 100 miles 
long...

Anyway, several hundred years later, the inhabitants of one of the biospheres,
a low-tech agrarian community, have for some reason forgotten that they are
on board a spaceship. Three young people from the biosphere manage to find 
the exit into the rest of the ship and go exploring, and discover that they 
are in fact aboard a great big huge spaceship -- and that the spaceship is
no longer under anyone\'s control and is on a collision course with a nearby
star. The series had our intrepid trio going from one biosphere to the next
looking for someone who knew how to regain control of the ship and avert the
collision.

(Most of this is from memory, as it\'s been a couple of decades since I\'ve
seen it...)

A few bits of trivia about the series:
- - It was created by Harlan Ellison, who when he saw how bad the result was
asked for his name to be removed from the credits; the credits list the
series creator as "Cordwainer Bird", an Ellison pseudonym.
- - The star of the series was Keir Dullea, star of 2001 A Space Odyssey.
- - Co-star Robin Ward\'s voice can be heard narrating the second Twilight
Zone series, seen here and there in syndication. (This TZ series is the
one produced in the late 1980s.)
- - Walter Koenig appeared in two episodes as Oro, an alien who finds the
Ark and for some reason decides not to help. Had the series continued
into a second season, Oro would likely have appeared in a few more episodes.
Since this was 1973, this was after his work on the original Star Trek
series.

This was a *bad* series, boys and girls. I keep hoping that Space, Canada\'s
cable SF channel, will pick it up...

1. I always thought the job of our soldiers was to defend and protect
us against those who would kill those of us who choose peace. Were it
not for our soldiers (meaning all on the side of the Allies) in World
War II, this mailing list would likely not exist.

2. Traveller is a game in which one of the most popular campaign types
involves mercenaries and other ex-military types. If you\'re wanting
to forget about soldiers, methinks you\'re on the wrong list. (No offence.)

Be that as it may, the off-topic post to which you are responding did
not belong on this list in the first place, and the perpetrator should
be punished by being placed in the path of a near-c asteroid in the
company of female Aslan in comfortable shoes.

The Starlost, an extremely low-budget Canadian sci-fi TV series which 
came out in 1973, after Star Trek. Walter Koenig was in several 
episodes.

I can understand why you thought it came out before Star Trek; the 
effects were so primitive it looks like something made by a 
high-school drama class.

This program was the result of some hard work by eastern Canadian 
sci-fi fans, who got Harlan Ellison to write the pilot and Douglas 
Trumbull to produce it. Unfortunately, the budget could not meet 
Ellison\'s vision for the series and he disavowed it. He even demanded 
they change his name in the credits to "Cordwainer Bird".

I remember reading an essay from someone involved with the series. 
The budget constraints and clueless management were so extreme it was 
funny. Ellison was in a huge argument with a "professional" 
(non-sci-fi) writer who thought a "backup computer" was something 
that made the spaceship fly in reverse.

As someone that served as a soldier, I can assure you that I did not,
and most soldiers do not, join the military to slay 
those who choose peace. At least in the USA. I joined to protect 
those who choose peace from those who choose otherwise. I disagree
strongly with the above opinion you hold on the narrow reasons 
why someone would join the military and find it to be insulting. 
I do not however, hold anything against Carlos for holding said 
opinion. 

I have realized over the years that it is futile to 
try to alter a strongly held opinion. So this is not an attempt at 
a debate or a call for any kind of flame war. I game with Carlos 
and respect him as a person. All I ask in return is the same 
respect for my not wanting to be thought of as some kind of violent, 
mindless brute bent on destroying everyone devoted to peace and 
taking some umbrage from what was probably a hasty comment made on, 
as he said, a bad day. In no way should this be mis-construed as 
an attack on Carlos or any peace movement.

That said, I appologize for any who feel my coments a waste of
bandwidth. 

On Topic Traveller:

Does anyone have any firm anti-violence groups active in their 
Traveller universe? What d they do? How does the Imperium 
see them?

I just got BtC, and I love it! I agree that the STL craft (Long Night era,
Solomani markings) were probably put out for us to play with, but given a 45
year ETA, there is plenty of time for some TNS style updates on their
location/status and related stories as backdrop to a GT: Campaign book. I\'d
say 3:1 odds that was a thought of SJG.

I see it as somewhere between the two extremes and shifting a bit towards

In my 3I (which I do not use much since I moved the area of play 
Beyond The Extents), Delphi sector was heavily colonized by terrans 
of asian origin. This gave a special twist to the later high 
corporate influence in Margaret\'s Stronghold during the Rebellion.

During an old FTF adventure, I introduced a pacifist movement 
following (partly) in spirit Yukio Mishima\'s ideas, vaguely linked 
to buddist religion. An Army without more weapons that those used for 
ritual suicide, willing to die but not to kill, with the firm belief 
that nobody has the right to take one life, except the own. They were 
called "Life Fighters" or "Mishimans."

They were sort of a peaceful resistance against the 
growing corporate power. Their ritual, spectacular suicides as 
protest for specific corporate acts (like causing planetary wars to 
control mineral resources) received a disproportionate media coverage 
and caused negative demand reactions among the consumers, eventually 
forcing the corporations to pay attention to the movement.

Some of their leaders made it into Margaret\'s counsel, which gave her 
some politically acceptable excuses for her retreat policy (which was 
actually caused by her focus in economics and ignorance of any 
military art).

They broke with Margaret after the Geoneecide, at the beginning of 
Hard Times, when Margaret\'s followers started hunting down Geonee.

True. However, if you are after an adventure for the PCs, it does not 
need to be a rescue mission. It would be more interesting (IMHO) to 
send the PCs to answer the two questions above, looking for POWs, 
which are *suspected* to be held at 5-8 parsecs from the boundary. Of 
course the POWs were moved further inside the consulate, and by the 
time the PCs discover them, there are indeed 500 of them, being 
thoroughly reeducated (benevolently or not, your take on Zhodani), at 
around 20 parsecs deep in the consulate... and indeed the PCs must 
recognize that rescuing them is impossible. I wonder how will PCs 
react.

Hmmmm..... have already 5 or 6 options been discussed? Looks to me 
the list has developed one old-styled adventure nugget (the 77th 
Patron?) ;-)

The economics might change if your recovery vehicle can load up in five
minutes and then head home at 100+kph.

That certainly is an interesting twist. I will have to think about 
the concept of a pacifist willing to kill themselves. A combination 
of the Samuri (sp?) right/obligation and more standard non-violence. 
It certainly is original. Hats off on that one.

What sort of methods for their ritual suicide did they use? The 
old standby of some kind of bladed weapon or something more modern? 
Or setting themselves on fire? Or something totally different?

Now that certainly has some possibilites...

Even if they had the purest of motives, an counter attack by the bad 
guys would be blamed on them. Strongly. <g>

Even more interesting would be the bad guys using the harrasment 
as cover for their attack.

I haven\'t done anything that extreme, but I\'ve had local peace activists
spraypaint "MURDERER" and other, more obscene slogans on the turrets of
the PCs ships while it was in the starport bay (they broke in). It
scared the players more than I intended, and they decided to hire a
bodyguard during the rest of their stay. Stupid as I am, I didn\'t spin
off from their paranoia, but some of you might want to.

The ideas I got later was to let the bodyguard ask them questions like
"have you ever killed someone" and things like that. It might also be
fun to let someone follow the PCs around town. They can\'t exactly blast
away at their "opponents" in this case...

Wouldn\'t that be a fun scenario?

No the modules are self-powered and the control is wireless. The

It is not mine. Yukio Mishima had that "Army" in modern-times Japan, 
and he did die by commiting ritual suicide (set the record for depth 
and width in the cuts, IIRC). They were not exactly pacifists as we 
westerners understand the concept, but there is where I took the idea 
from.

To be honest, in the first adventure I was thinking quick and had 
some of them (asian descent) use the traditional methods 
(hara-kiri/seppuku), complete with a *robotic* assistant programmed 
by themselves as a credible commitment. Later, I portrayed them as 
using a variety of suicide methods related to the issue they were 
protesting for, and gaining in spectacularity to captivate the 
mass-media attention. The only requirement is that it must be the 
individual\'s will and personal action what causes death, overcoming 
the pain of the process, and not some natural force (there is a huge 
difference between an "actice" suicide as seppuku and a "passive" 
suicide as jumping from a building - the jump does not kill you, but 
the fall)

For example, when the Geoneecide started, most of the initial victims 
(IMTU) died when Margaret\'s fleet destroyed Geonee-full starships 
which were fleeing the ravaged Massilia. Marquis Tanzer (?), the 
leading force behind the Geoneecide, stated that because the 
Geonee\'s internals organs were so packed, it was difficult to 
capture them alive, which explained the number of deaths.

One "Mishiman" killed himself in presence of Margaret by  using two 
robotic arms which augmented the strength of his own arms to compress 
the lower part of his body, "packing his internal organs to Geonee 
density." Another one killed stole a naval shuttle and used a 
remote-controlled cargo loader to have it slowly crush himself - he 
was pushing a lever to that purpose and could have stopped any 
second, but didn\'t.

Oh, btw, the PCs thought the Mishimans were all crazy, but the events 
*did* catch their attention. Then I throwed a Geonee "Mishiman" in as 
NPC...

Even better: hint to the PCs that killing innocent bystanders is 
severely frowned upon in the world, then have the pacifist throw 
themselves between the two groups between the fight, to stop the 
bullets <grin>.

A standard Ellison response when his scripts get *really* screwed over.
He "gives them the Bird". Many SF writers who work with TV and movie
scripts have a registered psuedonym for such cases. I believe that
David Gerrold\'s is "Noah Ward" (No Award:-).

There were other howlers. Things like saying the domes were only three
miles across. Harlan pointed out that if they were only three miles
across, then the people looking for Our Hero in the pilot episode
merely have to link hands and walk from one side to the other to locate
him. They told him the special effects people can\'t make it look more
than 3 miles across. So he tells them, fine, let them do their best but
you can still *say* it\'s 30 miles across! They went with 3.

Also, the original idea was for the kids to be trying to find the
Bridge. Which could take a long time in a ship that size. 

Instead, the producers had them find the bridge in the *pilot*,
discover it wasn\'t working and then having search for the emergency
bridge. 

Beside the fact that there\'s no good reason to have them find the
bridge so soon, there\'s the "minor" detail that if *anyplace* on the
ship would have directions to the backup bridge, it\'d be the primary
bridge! 

There was a book published "Phoenix without Ashes" that has the
original script plus Harlan\'s account of the trials and tribulations of
trying to get it filmed. It\'s worth reading. 

But in essence, most of the problems came down to the usual. Media
people just not understanding that SF is *not* fantasy. That things
have to have an internal logic *and follow that logic!*

That might not work.

A few years ago, demonstrators were protested the shipment of arms to
Central American from the Concord (Ca) Naval Weapons Depot.  One of the
protestors sat on the tracks.  As the train approached at 35 mph.  They got
it on video.

After the guy got out of the hospital, the public mood was "what kind of
idiot sits in front of a moving train?"  That act didn\'t do anything to
stop the shipments.

Your protestor might be seen as a martyr, but most sane people realize that
running in front of a squad involved in a firefight is a dumb thing, and
will react accordingly.

IMTU, Wardn/Lunion is inhabited by pacifists.  If they don\'t like you, they
just hold a sit down strike.

Wireless control on a battlefield is *not* a good idea. And it\'s not as
if using wires to connect the modules to the ARV is going to be *that*
much of a pain.

I haven\'t run a Traveller game set in my non-canon SF universe in ages,
but there are such groups active in it; they do much the same sort of
stuff they do in the here and now.

Some of them are descended from groups active today.

I suppose the "pain" issue depends on how  "hot"  the  recoveries
are.

However, I wonder how easy it would be to  \'simply  attach\'  grav
modules to a battle damaged vehicle.  Then there\'s the  issue  of
bits  falling  off  mid-flight.   I  think  easiest  would  be  a
specialised recovery vehicle looking like a hovering WW2  landing
craft with a crane (to move the damaged vehicle and its bits onto
it).  It could double up as a general utility combat cargo mover.

	I would start with something totally bizarre and gross
	(don\'t underestimate the power of making your PCs go 
	"Eewww!"), and then built layers of scheming, deceit,
	and bad intent.  The upper layer may be merely a cover-up

	being duped by nasties with Ancient\'s technology, who are
	actually evil mind-sucking spiders from another domension
	plotting to turn all living things into cattle!  Aha! Ha! Ha!

	Ahem.  Yes, well, and don\'t forget parasites.  PCs hate

from Fantasy to S.F. from gore to thrillers.  Its the best GM aid I 
have seen.  

It gave me the idea to run a Traveller horror game, thats a 
combination of Titatic and the Night of the Living Dead.  The big 
passanger linner misjumps causing major problems with the ship\'s 
systems, and choas occuars.  Worse though is the fact that 
hundereds of the low berths passangers have turned into zombies.

The plan is to see how well the players deal with a dead in space 
ship, hunderds of dying passangers, and acourse the Zombies.

Subject: Arts in Trav

	Well, like someone else said, every time I think of this, my head
starts to spin with the endlessness of possibilities.  Consider how many
worlds there are with populations roughly equivalent to Earth\'s today. 
Combine this with the technology they have available and there should be a
dizzying assortment of art forms including 2D, 3D and maybe
higher-dimensional art in the form of isographic holograms and so on.  But
that answer is not very helpful, so let me come up with a few funky
things that could be thrown into the TU:

	Terraforming as Art:  This would be the high TL equivalent of
those giant sculptures and modern art projects where they modify
landscapes.  Sponsored by gigacredit art endowments, these art projects
modify coastlines with giant dams and/or canals, adjust the color of local
plant life by introducing genetically engineered viruses and so on.  Ice
caps are melted into fun new shapes with plasma torches, fast-growing
algea lend color to oceans, and so on.  Mostly done on low-population
worlds.  Smaller scale projects modify only a continent or sea, but the
result is usually visible from orbit.

	Genetics as Art:  Highly illegal in the 3I, but practiced in less
anti-biotech areas is the practice of creating new and interesting
creatures as art.  One could make a genuine chimera or dragon or...other
things...<:-o A side possibility here is recreating "real life" versions
of famous artworks, including genuine burning giraffes, melting clocks or
whatever (That last is stolen from a story by Greg Egan :-) 

	Gravitics as Art:  Getting into less controversial territory,
gravitics should have a major impact on art and architecture with
"impossible" buildings (a la Escher), ominously suspended masses and
oscillating fleets of sculpture elements. Canonically, Darrian flame
sculpture is supposed to make use of gravitics (although personally I
consider that to be a nouveau-school fad :-). 
	
Just some ideas...

A great resource for this sort of thing is GURPS Illuminati, which
is generic enough to be useable in any role-playing environment, no
matter what rule set one is using. I successfully did a superhero
campaign -- set in the same universe as a handful of other campaigns
we did -- using Illuminati. The PCs wound up being pawns in a huge
conspiracy, a conspiracy with many layers so that when the players
solved one mystery, all it did was generate more questions.

This could easily be done in an interstellar setting. You don\'t even
need to figure out all the details ahead of time -- just enough for
the PCs to become involved in, and maybe a little more. The important
thing is to keep them guessing, and get them to the point that they
begin to suspect that everything they know is wrong.

One great fake-out I pulled on them: the Evil Corporation that they
were fighting against, in whose HQ they had been several times, was
an outfit called OmniTech. When the heroes finally decided to face off
against OmniTech once and for all, they went to the OmniTech building
and found... a completely different building, the offices of a toy
company. Suspicious, they went to a nearby phone booth and checked the
directory. No listing for OmniTech, but a listing, at that address, for
the Toy Company.

It got to the point that the PCs didn\'t know who to trust or where
to turn... and by having the Enemy plant a few fake clues, I had some
of the PCs begin to suspect that one of the others was secretly working
for the Enemy.

As I said, you can easily do this in a space game...

Mishima linked with a pacifist movement?  That thought should cause seismic 
activity in Japan!  The man had his own private army & thought that the 
Emperor should take back the reins of government and rearm the nation.

His own suicide was an act he had been rehearsing his entire adult 
life.  Perhaps as an atonement for failing the physical to become a Devine 
Wind pilot during the Great Pacific War.

 >An Army without more weapons that those used for

Remember that Mishima used his sword on several unarmed soldiers prior to 
his sucide.   He certainly was willing to fight & kill others.  His own 
suicide was an act of grand theatre.

Given all that, I think the concept is certainly interesting, and the name 
could be the result of cultural drift and historical revisionism.

Also remember that a \'Suicide Attack Squad\' has been done.  Check out Monty 
Python\'s  "Life of Brian."

That would probably depend on whether or not the nasty, bad people who 
caused the \'breakdown\' are still around.

Even sillier, it came out that (like far too much of the public) the
protestors weren\'t aware that the train *couldn\'t* stop in less than a
mile! 

We see this all the time here with people cutting in front of the
"light rail" trains. These may be a lot lighter than a frieght train,
but at any sort of speed they need a hundred yards or so to stop. 

Yet idiots cut *inches* in front of them all the time. And every few
months one of them gets hit. 

ObTrav: would be terrorists take over the ship and don\'t believe the
crew when they try to tell them that CG or no CG the ship *can\'t* do
whatever it is that the terrorists want to do.

Well, magnets are probably out. But I expect that at "contact" ranges,
you can make a CG or AG module attract the chunk of vehicle it\'s up
against strongly enough for all practical purposes. 

As for pieces falling off, that\'s why they issue you guys those *big*
rolls of duct tape. :-)

No. Violence occurs, period. IMTU, gorry death is just as "Real" to the
characters as my High-School buddy Carl\'s scar on his forehead from his
failed attempt at suicide is to Carl and I. Just because I don\'t describe
the steaming entrails (or boiling away, for ex, on wypoc/regina/sm) doesn\'t
mean that, IMTU, it\'s not going to gross some character out. Just because
they are IMAGINARY to us doesn\'t make the sacrifices of the Imperial forces
in the 4th & 5th frontier wars any less the honored dead to the Characters.

Now I agree with the post having been innapropriate for the TML, BUT
ABSOLUTELY DISAGREE with Carlos\' reasons... Death in service is a fact of
life, a fact of fiction, and thus a subject of value to keep in mind as a
GM.

Ob Trav: Is there an official rememberance of the fallen dead IYTU\'s? IMTU,
it\'s generally done at day 180. Not quite an imperial holiday (I only have
2 of those IMTU- Holiday and the Emperor\'s B-Day), but the official day of
rememberance.

  Self-powered how? Individual fusion units? If so, they\'ll be more costly
than a central unit with scale efficiencies.

I think that you should be able to design a grav ARV
with enough Gs of lift to pick up another armored
vehicle.

Hmm, tough call.
Considering past RD history, they probably wouldnt exactly WIN, but 
survive without doubt, maybe a spaceship or crewmember

Wherather their opponent survives however, Id guess not.

I was sort of waiting for someone to mention this.  I never thought of
Mishima Yukio-sensei as a pacifist.  In fact... he\'s one of the
inspirations for my Shiratori Cycle.  (I\'m neither a pacifist nor a
militarist; I\'m just a realist.  But the stories of Mishima\'s life
inspired the character of Shiratori Misato, the founder of Shiratori
Colony IMHTU.)

	[Steve replied]  Always, always, always do stuff that makes the
players start to look askance at each other, as well.
	There are a number of things you can do IRL that heighten this,
without the players really realizing what\'s the real thing.
	(Note - in the instances where I\'ve managed to pull it off,
invariably these are ONE SESSION gaming affairs - if you give the players a
chance to chat amongst themselves, you end up losing a lot of the atmosphere
you\'ve worked hard to engender...)

	1) seperate the group - put small groups or better individuals on
their own in the adventure, and therefore keep them in seperate rooms, and
just move frequently, dm\'ing each person alone.   keep it simple and fast or
you\'ll have boredom more than fear.
	2) plant clues that make the characters suspicious of one another -
in the game, of course; but also in real life - leave a little note saying
"The contact gives you John\'s service record and a bunch of photographs"
somwhere where John\'s player will find it.  That led to more backbiting and
suspicion than I could have ever created as a DM.
	3) never understimate the power of your player\'s imaginations.  Have
stuff happen if it\'s cool - don\'t bother to even TRY explaining it.  They\'ll
invariably come up with a plausible explanation that fits the facts.  Then
throw a curve at them that wrecks their assumptions.  :)

Uncertainty and powerlessness. These are the two variables from which
horror springs.

Start normally. Try not to let your players know you are going to run a
horror scenario. Instead, run one of the other normal Traveller campaigns
for the first couple of sessions. Have the PCs develop their skills and
make friends with NPCs, so that they develop a sense that they know how the
universe works.

Then, when things begin to get strange, put them in situations where their
skills and friends are simply inadequate to fully deal with the situation.
You probably don\'t want the PCs to be *totally* helpless; rather, you want
them to be thwarted in resolving the situation to *their* satisfaction.

You should also isolate them, so that they have nowhere to turn for help.
This does not need to be simple physical isolation (although that works).
It can also be social isolation -- no one is willing to believe them, much
less help them.

Here are the four maxims to keep in mind when setting up an atmosphere of
horror. These are what you want your players to eventually realize:

1. Things are not as they seem.
2. These things are beyond your control.
3. Worse, you don\'t even know half of it.
4. And nobody believes you when you mention what you *do* know.

Oops, have to get back to work!

being playtested and I would be very interested in any comments.  If anyone
has experimented with a similar rule I am interested in their experiences.
This rule is for my TNE campaign but could be ported into any
system/campaign.

When your players return from a dicey mission in the Wilds with a huge
lucrative cargo of relics do they get ignored or are they interviewed by the
Coalition networks.  IMTU I use Fame as a die roll to be recognized, the
roll is modified by the PC\'s and the NPC\'s career etc as below.  However if
the players have recently returned from a major mission they are often
greeted by Trid crews and their pictures may very soon be spread all across
the planet.

Some RCES and Marine personnel are household names already and although
press intrusion is uncommon they are easily recognized on most worlds, the
same goes for the players.  This can have positive and negative benefits.

Rules (Inspired by the renown rules of Star Trek the RPG)

5 Categories affect the fame of a PC or NPC.  Social Standing, Ethics,
Success, Media and Politics. Other than Social Standing all scores may be
negative

Social Standing : Divide the SOC level of the character by 2.

Conduct : Award a rating based on their known conduct.  A negative rating
reflects behaviour such as unnecessary violence, killing prisoners etc.  A
positive rating suggests they follow Coalition codes of conduct. Drops by 1
point per month to a minimum of half the maximum total or 10 whichever is
lower.

Success : How successful the group has been, both in terms of mission
objectives and how they have dealt with unforeseen problems. Drops by 1
point per week to a minimum of half total or 10 whichever is lower.
Media : How much media attention they have got and in what light they have
been portrayed.  Drops by 1 point per week not appearing in the media, never
drops below half its maximum score or 10 whichever is lower. (This can
include publishing books etc. A bestseller would raise media by 10-15 pts
and the score would not decrease until the book dropped out of the top 10
books list.)

Politics : What are the view of the person on the Federalist/Centrist
politics, score positive for Federalist and negative for Centrist. People
from Centrist planets automatically have a base score of -2, conversely
persons from a federalist planet start from a base of +2.  For people from
the Wilds make a judgement based on their government.

Total the magnitude of all these scores  (i.e... ignore the positive or
negative sign) This is the Renown score, divide this by 10 (round up) for
their Fame Rating.

The following table gives the base difficulty for people to recognise the
name on am outstanding success they are recognised on sight.

Fame Score        Difficulty (base asset is 5)
1-2                       Impossible
3-4                       Formidable
5-6                       Difficult
7-8                       Average
9-10                     Routine
11+                      Easy

Modifiers to Difficulty.

Location : Homeworld -1,    Coalition World 0    Allied World +1    Wilds +3
Enemy World (non Wilds) +2

Occupation : Same Occupation/Service -2,    Similar Occupation/Service -1,
Completely unrelated Occupation +1,    Area of interest/Hobby -1

Other Modifiers as decided by the GM

I don\'t use these rules every time the PC\'s walk down the street, but they
can be useful.  The PC/NPC is likely to be known for whichever area his fame
is greatest.

Why not have a grav frame? In Trav terms, an open frame grav vehical that lands

Not just SF. Very few shows that contain "super-heroes" have good scripts,
either. "The Flash" (forex) had good SPFX and a fantastic costume, but the
writers all seemed to have their brains removed before putting pen to paper.
They just don\'t seem to realise that the main suspension of disbelief is to do
with the character themselves and their powers. Beyond that, everything else
should work "normally" - otherwise it looks *too* silly.

Plot is the most important element after character.(##)

The correct places to put special effects are as part of the background
environment and as the gloss added later, to remind the viewer that this is a
different world. The "gosh-wow effect" cannot sustain a story.

This was forgotten in things like "Star Trek: The Movie" and TV series such as
"The Flash", "Superboy", "Lois and Clark" (mostly) - there are many others.

The ones that worked were things like "Wrath of Khan", the "Star Trek: TNG"
series (mostly) and (interestingly) "The Greatest American Hero".

(##)...applies to the creation of good roleplaying scenarios, too...

I suspect that you draw the line somewhere short of a
number that will lead to a mutiny or major civil
unrest.  In the Imperium, that\'s probably a very, very
large number.  

It\'s also easier to decline to disclose the existence
of small numbers.

Now what will happen to any of the MIAs who return, by
whatever means, to the Imperium?  Will they be hailed
publicly as heroes, or should they be tried as
suspected spies and traitors, or something in between?
 

And what is the truth?  Have the Zhodani taken control
of their minds, like in The Manchurian Candidate? or
is the situation more like that of Ivan Denisovich\'s
gulag-mate?

I don\'t think canon addresses the issue, but I\'ve
always assumed that once you\'ve joined the Imperium,
you can\'t leave -- and once the Imperium decides it
wants you, all you can do is cut the best deal you
can.  

All of those oaths of fealty and pledges of allegiance
that the government signs when the world joins the
Imperium say "in perpetuity" in pretty large print. 
It\'s no secret to the decision makers on the
prospective member state that their decision is
irrevocable.  

The only worlds that have a chance of leaving the
Imperium are those in border areas that have the
support of another major power (like Efate/Regina/
Spinward Marches).  The small nation problem of the
mid-twentieth century is written very large indeed in
the Far Future, when the large nations are composed of
thousands of worlds and the small ones of only
handfuls.

And a jump made by a starship... that\'s just a name for a clever

Maybe, maybe not.

Remember Ghandi\'s protest against the Salt Tax in India?  Protesters
marched up to be beaten by the British police.

I think a key point here is giving the firefight time to stop. If you dash
in front of a weapon in full autofire, you probably get shot even if the
soldier tries to miss you. But if your group slowly marches between the
fighters, giving them plenty of time to stop shooting, so that it is
obvious that any casualties to the protesters are the result of deliberate
shots (or really negligent troops)...

It\'s risky, admittedly, but it does demonstrate great personal commitment
to stopping the violence.

Whether it would work or not depends a great deal on the philosophical
nature of that world\'s socity.

Nah, where you draw the line is also dependent on whether you have reason to pick a fight.  At the moment, I doubt the Imperium is very interested in a 6th frontier war, however.

Just suppose, huh? Just a hypothetical question? You wouldn\'t do such a

Speaking as a GM/referee of horror games (my primary genre)... I do this

First of all, consider the room you play in. Use it to your advantage.
In other words, if the light suddenly goes out in the scenario, do the
same in the room. It helps if you can get close to the light switch
without the players realizing what you are about to do. See below.

Walk about the room when talking to the players. Talk in a low, soft
voice. Always hint at some conspiracy for mostly everything that happens
("The bus driver looks at you for perhaps a second to long"). Pay
attention to details. Many of the details you describe during the
session will have no impact. One or two will be important. If you
describe several things detailed, the players won\'t see the label HINT
pasted to the important stuff.

Now for the actual story stuff. I just got a really nice idea. ;-)

The PCs are hired by a large corporation to take some "medical supplies
in sealed containers" to a research station somewhere Far Away (TM).
They get paid tons of credits, but are ordered to keep the fact that
they are working for the company secret.

When the ship gets to the destination, they find out that the container
handling equipment at the base is broken. The container will have to be
split inside the cargo hold, and the smaller cases inside will have to
be unloaded separately. If the ship has it\'s own cargo handling
equipment, the container has to be split in the hangar anyway.

Inside the container are several boxes about 2.5x1.0x0.5 meters. They
have some electronics attached to them, and look suspiciously like low
berths. They just might contain human bodies... (think Aliens:
Ressurrection)

By now, the PCs are probably wondering what\'s happening. As the last
cases are being transported out of the hangar using an old four-wheeler
of some kind, the PCs recieve their payment from an officer. Suddenly,
one of the cases crashes to the ground. The plastic breaks, and a
something shows through. A human hand. The officer rushes the PCs into
their ship, adds about 25% or so to their payment, gives them a warning
look, and leaves. They are more or less ordered to leave the station as
soon as possible.

After this, a number of things could happen. If the PCs go to some kind
of bigger media, they won\'t be believed. If they go to smaller, more
honest media, or perhaps seek rumors in bars or somesuch, they will hear
rumors of horrible experiments...

In any case, no matter if they talk about the affair or not, the officer
that paid the PCs will regret (after orders/threats from his superiors)
that he let them go. Agents of the corporation will begin to look for
the PCs. Depending on how public they have made themselves, they will be
more or less easy to find...

So, as the PCs try to uncover the Truth behind this conspiracy,
stretching over perhaps more than a subsector, agents of the corporation
constantly are at their tails. Almost no one believes them, and the ones
that do are either bought off or disappear without a trace. What to do?

Take that idea and go from there. It might be what you were looking for.
I think I am going to use it myself :-)

It has worked several times. Consider the events in Beijing (Peking) a
few years back. I student stood in front of a tank, preventing it from
moving forward. When the tank tried to turn, he moved.

Doh! I don\'t know the English name for the square where the event took
place. The Swedish name for it translates into something like "the
square of heavenly peace".

Another "peaceful resistance" idea for Traveller:
Have environment-friendly demonstrants camping on and around the PCs
spaceship, preventing takeoff and "saving the atmosphere and birds." The
demonstrants are dressed in bright, cheerful clothes, wear flowers in
their hair, and all that kind of stuff. A few of them have pet animals
and birds with them.

Have a flower, man!  ;-)

Nightmares of Mine.  It was developed by Ken Hite (of Pyramid\'s Suppressed
Transmissions fame), and is probably the best thing Iron Crown has put out
in a long time.  No Rolemaster stats, and designed to help port the horror
theme into any genre.

If you are interested in a excellent GM aid to help flesh out a horror
setting laced with dread, terror and the occasional gore, it\'s the book to
own.

I\'m one who noted that it was a Star Trek episode (For

that does not mean that it was not also something
else, like a short story or a novel.

The Virushi NPCs in my Traveller Universe make loud
"tsk tsk" noises and help handle injuries.

I once ran a Vargr ex-Scout who refused to participate
in a contract killing with the rest of the PCs,
because he was unwilling to be the instrument of
revenge of someone he barely knew.  Once he heard what
the patron wanted -- and saw that the other PCs were
eager to go to work -- he withdrew to pursue other
business.  He met up with the PCs at the gaming
session after the hit had been accomplished (they did
it in only one gaming session -- very efficient).  

Those examples are the closest I\'ve come to pacifism
in Traveller.

On the other hand, he lived. Keep in mind that there was a very important
qualification which Carlos mentioned,  "killing innocent bystanders is
severely frowned upon in the world." To put it another way, the cultural
climate on this world at that time is such that this sort of protest would
be extremely appropriate

While a few years ago the protest that you mentioned, which happened in a
certain time and place, was received with a degree of apathy, the same sort
of protest in California in 1969 might have produced different results.

>Your protestor might be seen as a martyr, but most sane people realize that
>running in front of a squad involved in a firefight is a dumb thing, and

Assuming, of course, that they receive the story as you have presented. It
also requires that "sane people" are something like the sane people in the
time and place that you\'re talking about. If the prevailing mood on such a
world is the way Carlos described, it\'s quite possible that any media
outlets that carried the story - and it\'s safe to assume that media coverage
is extensive, as otherwise such a protest would be useless - would do so in
a light that was favorable to the protestors and unfavorable to the PCs.

"Bloodthirsty, trigger-happy terrorists gun down participants in a peaceful
protest."

It could also be argued that most "sane people" on such a world wouldn\'t
want running gun battles in the streets that could kill innocent bystanders
in the first place. In a cultural climate like that, it\'s unlikely that such
a protest would not always be met with the apathy you describe.

Of course it\'s possible that not all pacifists are non-violent. Despite the
inherent contradiction, there is the concept of peace through war that
countries in the real world banter about. Despite the fact that such
rhetoric is often utterly transparent, there is the possibility that a
different culture could develop in that direction.

No, perhaps I wasn\'t clear. There is a distinct line between fictional
violence and real violence.

No matter how it\'s described, violence in the real world is inherently
different from fictional violence. It\'s that simple. The point wasn\'t in the
description, but in the fact that one *is not* the other.

The characters are themselves fictional, so it\'s a moot point. I\'m not
saying that fantasy cannot deal with the complicated issues of death and
violence, just that fictional violence and violence in the real world are
two entirely different things.

To answer your final question: IMTU there is a Veterans\' Day and a seperate
Remembrance Day. As a matter of fact, the Imperial Veterans\' Day is a point
of contention between planetary governments and the Imperium. The politics
of the situation are long and involved, but concern planetary rights vs.
Imperial rights, which IMTU is something of a burning issue.

Ob Traveller, I suspect there are billions of nominal Imperial
subjects that could care less about the noble families, from the
Emperor on down.  Remember, the Imperium only rules "the space
between the stars" not the worlds themselves. 

Put your group into environments that they aren\'t use to.  If they
include nobles and are used to the royal treatment, put them in
a system where nobles are treated the way the Committee of Safety
did.  Or if they are decidedly non-noble in composition, put them on
a world where *everything* is based on noble patronage.  Either way,
it should be interesting to see them cope.

Now, non-traveller...
Not all Americans have elevated that bunch of rum runners to royal
status. Speaking for myself, I\'d as soon have the Windsor\'s as the
Kennedy\'s, They maybe worthless, but they\'d be less likely to cause
lasting harm than that meddlesome clan of clam diggers. <g>

Oddly enough, one of my "I can\'t write another F&!@$ing word about Lift

"Tarry not in the woods of the Elves, for the trees themselves have eyes

<snip very good list>

In Ground Forces, I am writing about the various Regimental Associations,
which I see as the equivalent of the American Legion or Veterans of Foreign
Wars.

Current or former members of a particular Regiment may join the associated
Regimental Association.  Sometimes little more than a dusty hall for
veterans to meet in and swap stories, the Associations can be a valuable
source of information about the past exploits of the unit.

Some Associations, particular those of the larger or more famous Regiments,
can wield enormous power.  The back-channel deals and contacts made at
monthly meetings can either expedite or severely hinder projects, based on
the desire of those in the Association.

Associations also function as charitable organizations.  The groups raise
funds to assist local communities by building playgrounds, establishing
scholarships, and other good works.  In this aspect, the Association
provides good public relations for the actual Regiment, which may be light
years from it\'s home territory.  Association members also act as
historians, compiling extensive records of the regiment and it\'s members.

Membership in a Regimental Association costs Cr. 200/year, on the average.
Fees for some of the more prestigious associations can be much higher.
Dues may be waved for members for reason of disability or at the agreement
of the board.  Recipients of the Starburst for Extreme Heroism tend to have
honorary membership bestowed upon them.

The most famous of the Regimental Associations is the Veterans of The
Matriarch\'s Own Cavalry, on Mora.  The Association was granted a large
atoll in the southern hemisphere, which is used as a private resort by the
Regiment\'s five battalions.

In game terms, membership can be seen as either Contacts (B234) or a
5-point Claim to Hospitality for wealthier groups.  In neither case will
the Association appreciate being constantly badgered for information, or
putting up with extra guests who were not members of the Regiment.

Just as important, however, if not more so:  be SURE that you know your
players, and that they will put up with this.  Some, like myself, will
decide that the game isn\'t fun anymore and walk.

Setting up a "game contract" (expectations) and then deliberately breaking
it is always something done at your peril.

It means heavenly peace here too...and appropriate seeing as so many
were transported there by the PLA.  <sigh> I suppose I shouldn\'t say
that. 

Passive resistance will be used over and over and in the long run
can prove very successful. If you can survive the short run.

There\'s also Steve Perry\'s \'The Man Who Never Missed\', where a Confed trooper 
was part of a squad killing over 250,000 religious dissidents in an 
afternoon.  It triggered something in him that turned him into the man who 
lead the successful revolution that overthrew the Confed.

Great series, btw (the \'Matador\' series).  One of the PCs IMTU actually

Of course, but it could be said that such bizarre contradictions are part of

Actually, when I first read it, I immediatly started thinking along the

excessively tolerant. YMMV.

It depends. Adventures of the sort that you\'re talking about can be
mishandled and become merely "traditional" Traveller adventures. Horror
isn\'t in the plot, it\'s in the details.

Before I get to that, it is absolutely imperative that the GM is also a good
storyteller. I can\'t stress this enough. Nothing is worse than being in a
horror-themed campaign run by somebody who can\'t highlight the creepy parts
without sounding cheesy.

Okay, so now onto the details.

Nah.  Not with Rimmer\'s history of Stratigo and Dave\'s ability to ignore
anything the smeghead says or does!  As long as Holly is there with a timely
"Purple Alert" (not as bad as a "Red Alert", but worse than a "Blue Alert")
and Cryton can do the sums while the Cat just looks good and the Scutters
clean up... I don\'t think so...

And what if Ace Rimmer were to appear at that time?  Smoke him a kipper

As I don\'t have my books anymore (or yet), I thought there were one or two
systems mentioned somewhere (possibly, non-canon) within the empire that
were independent and on good standing... This may just be memory of a game I
once played run by someone esle too, so forgive me that if that is the
case - hence my asking the question for confirmation.

Yes, I also see the Imerium as similar to the old world\'s colonial/empires,
where when you wished to sucede, you had to fight to get out (unlike now
where it\'s fine with many "mother countries" if a colony or two want to
leave).

This worked because the commander of the tank was from a local garrison.

The government moved in troops from farther away, who had no connections to 
the local population, who showed no problem with shooting the unarmed 
protesters and then closing with bayonets fixed.

Perhaps this is a reason why interstellar governments still need to move 
army sized units from one planet to another.

I was having similar thoughts myself. In a couple of weeks time,
we\'re taking our kids to Disneyland (tm) for a holiday, and I
was wondering; what do citizens of the 3I do for a holiday?
Do they go to theme parks? Is there a Disney - World - orbiting
some star in the 3I? What has the entertainment industry become?

Here on Terra we have huge tracts of land devoted to tourism.
Even some countries use tourism as their major source of income.
But if you look through the Marches sourcebook there is no indication
that tourism is an important industry anywhere, and there isn\'t even
any mention of things that would be points of interest to a tourist.
So where are all the sight-seeing opportunities & pleasure planets
(like Star Trek\'s Risa)? Where do the luxury liners and safari ships go?

It strikes me that there is very little that would attract tourists to the
Marches.
There\'s the museum at Regina, but that is solitary entertainment and it\'s appeal
could hardly be described as being "fun". Apart from that, there is nothing
that I would consider a "draw" for tourists.

Sheesh. Don\'t the Villani know how to have fun?

Well, maybe I\'m being a bit harsh on them. Other sectors of the Imperium
certainly have things to see, like the cities on Core/Capital, the ringworld
and that star system that orbits in a Kempler(?) rosette. But the Spinward
Marches is strangely bereft of, hmmm, how shall I put this - whimsy.


OK, lets turn this into something practical. I\'d like to ask the TML this
question:
If you lived in the Marches and were planning a vacation with money and time
no object what would you want to go and see?

I got the impression the heroes had to find the bridge in the pilot 
because of the "mantelpiece rule". That is, they mentioned it so many 
times they had to produce the goods or the viewers would feel 
cheated. Doing this also brought the pilot to enough of a conclusion 
to make it a complete story. Anyway, after spending so much on 
foam-core and tinfoil for the bridge set the producers probably 
demanded they show it.

This is very interesting, thanks for mentioning it.

I searched on the web and, of course, there is a fan page for the 
Starlost. Check out http://www.snowcrest.net/fox/star.html.

Probably the most interesting tidbit there is the fact that Ben Bova 
was the "technical consultant" for the series. He wrote a description 
of the engines, shuttles, reactor and life systems. All of which were 
ignored.

Bova\'s revenge was to write a sarcastic novel called "The 
Starcrossed", the promo for which includes: "... there is 3D TV, 
offering the illusion of almost-live entertainment in the home.   All 
it needs is a smashing new series to bring it to the heart of the 
American people and get Titanic Productions off the brink of 
financial disaster.... That\'s where The Starcrossed comes in, with 
its own surprises."

IMTU, there is a beautiful ringed planet in the Beck system.
Nothing in Beck is worth stopping except the rings.  A corporation
built several pleasure habitats there and turned Beck into Las
Vagas, Disneyworld, Paris, and Club Med all rolled into one.  Liners
take holiday crowds from the subsector to Beck for holiday.
Merchant ships bring in supplies and leave with mostly empty holds.

I would doubt it very much. It should be remembered that our own cultures
focus on a day of rememberance is a direct product of the most traumatic
war in history (note the days choosen). Before the 1st WW there were
no specific national days of rememberance. And the 3rd Imperium has
never suffered anything even remotely as traumatic as the 1st WW. Just
to drive home the point a few numbers about the 1st WW might be in order.

Total number of men mobilised - 65,000,000 (12% of population)
Number of men killed - 8,550,000 (13% of mobilised)
Number of men wounded - 21,220,000 (33% of mobilised)
Number of men POW or Missing - 7,750,000 (12% of mobilised)

Now those figures only go part way to describing the traumatic effects of
the 1st WW; but to translate them across the Imperium you would need
to have tens of billions killed in a single war. Perhaps the Rebellion might
cut it, but that would be the only war that would even come close.

OTOH, once a culture has a precedent for an annual ceremony to remember
those who have fallen in that culture\'s interests, the ceremonies will
tend to grow to include those who, in peacetime, either fought or served
in that culture\'s interests.  Certainly the Veterans\' Day commemorated
in the United States had its origins in Armistice Day; that doesn\'t mean
that those of us who served in later conflicts are slighted.  Indeed,
those American soldiers who happened to serve in peacetime are
considered just as worthy of honor on Veterans\' Day as those of us who
spent time in combat zones.

Since the 3I has, as antecedents, at least one culture (the Terran
Confederation) that set aside special dates to honor those who fought in
defense of their societies, I would not be surprised to see an
equivalent to Veterans\' Day in the 3I, even though there has been no war
in recent memory that caused casualties of a proportion similar to those
suffered in Terra\'s First World War.

First off, you have to convince the players that you are willing to kill
them.
If neccessary, that means doing so, preferrably in extremely graphic and
detailed goriness.

Get past the "oh shit, I\'ve been shot, where\'s the autodoc ?" stage, make
them _feel_ the wounds.

Hit them with something familiar, like the set up for "Aliens", encourage
them to think you\'ve recycled the plot, and then have something happen that
is clearly impossible ( given their current knowledge ). Preferably
something nasty that will make them want to mount a 24hr guard, and not
trust their automatics. The first killing from "Forbidden Planet" comes to
mind.

Read "Silence of the Lambs".  Would you like to be a cop in a building
knowing that Lector is loose and hunting ?

Read "The Vang : the Military Form" (or "The Battlemaster")

Read "The Legacy of Heorot"

Isolate the players. (a ship in jump, no way to get out until jump ends. On
an asteroid station waiting for the next ship. In a habitat where "outside"
is deadly to humans...)

Read "The Jesus Incident". Nerve Runners, \'nuff said.

Kill their technilogical advantage ( The power station goes critical, it has
to be shut down. There\'s a virus in the computer must be shut down, won\'t
have control for the two hours it takes to reboot the ships systems. The
enemy is invisible to their sensors....)

Make them paranoid. ( Leave hints that it\'s one of the players that\'s
responsible for the badness, especiallly if it isn\'t.  Make it seem the
enemy can "walk through walls". Enemy is "super-genius", it will outthink
anything you do....)

Make it obvious the Enemy is playing with them. ( Do the scene where the
Grendel comes across the hero strapped down in the medical tent, or from
Alien 3 where the alien leaves Ripley alone (because she is a queen.....)

Damage your characters. They are wounded, no likelihood of healing, no
autodocs, no antibiotics, lots of fungi around.....

Read "The Jester at Scar"

Talk about diseases that eat the flesh off your thigh in thirty seconds

Watch "Millenium"

Then, light the room properly.

Create NPC\'s that have strange habits and speech patterns, and don\'t  seem
"all there"

"Renfield" from "Dracula" is a good example.

Have all your NPC\'s act scared of something, but none of them wil talk to
the players about it.
Have them die in gory ways while saying something cryptic and foreboding

"It\'s too late, _they_ are loose !" _croak_



Have an otherwise staunch military type hang himself rather than face what\'s
"out there"
(Stephen King story, "The Fog "? "

AHHA! Another convert for the \'general war\' idea :-)

2. RE: Sixth Frontier War!
Ok, I really got this figured out-the megacorps buy Nike
to put a shoe factory on Chronor(as in my prior posting).
But they don\'t sell the finished product in the Consulate.
Instead, they ship it to the Aslan colonies (who need
comfortable shoes for some such reason). Also, this Col.

low tech back water planet.

3. RE: OT: In Time of Remeberance/Sixth FFW!
Meanwhile, back at Capital, a number of Imperial war
veterans are heard booing and hissing Emperor Strephon
as he rises to give an address to commerorate Imperial
Memorial Day. "He sold our comrades out," said Army
Sergeant Enki Amelii. It was noted that the Imperial
Guard took no measures to silence the protesters.......

Question:  I should know this but I\'ll ask anyway; was
Strephon a career Noble (born with the spoon in his
mouth) or did he actually have some outside experience?
Like in the military or the merchants or the scouts etc.

4. The Spinward Marches Campaign
Question: Does anyone know details and type of the ship
on the front cover? It looks to big to be a Type S scout.
I\'ve decided that the other one is one of those 200 ton
STL merchants from Hard Times.

Question: Does Federation of Arden use or have access
to jump capable ships? If so, presumably these are purchased
abroad and shipped home, leading to our next question.
How would they maintain jc ships if they no longer had access
to type A starports(assuming it would be difficult to gain such
access during the 5th FFW)? They would have had to have
spent *alot* of credits stockpiling parts and building proper
maintenance facilities. They would have had to done this in a
dmz that would have been monitored by the 3I and ZC. This
would have been a neat trick, if they did have jc ships.

Group A, seeing themselves as the representatives of the groups 
in question might just think of Group B as being \'elitest\' or 
even \'racist\'. There could be some very interesting interaction 
and even direct and covert conflict (of the physical variety).

I don\'t have my copy of TCS ready-to-hand, but IIRC, military forces can
build starships without a Class A starport (I assume that they use
purpose-built military shipyards, unavailable to civilians).  That would
explain the Federation of Arden having jump-capable ships without a
Class A starport.  (If that rule isn\'t in TCS, it might be in _Pocket
Empires_.)

        Hi, Rob!

        IMHO, the trick is BE PATIENT.  As a Ref, that is.  There is a real
tendency to want to get the players hip-to-neck-deep as quick as possible.
It doesn\'t work, because the players don\'t have to think.

        I ran a concept game like this in Cyberpunk sometime ago...  I used
the "Countdown" concept...  As in "10, 9, 8..."  Each digit represents the
number of adventures/ scenarios between those which have something to do
with the Grand Conspiracy.  Now, I tend to run two-or-three session
adventures;  adjust timings to taste.  In Traveller, for my first FTF TNEC
game, I ran _Shadows_ as part of the Conspiracy.  The Scout took some
samples of the flora that was growing in that horrendous atmosphere.  Took
\'em back to the local Scout Base for analysis.  The took one look at them,
their logbooks and siezed the logs, recorder data, samples, everything.
When the Scout protested, they reactivated her, ORDERED the turn-over of the
material, paid her a month and then deactivated her...  

        She was steamed, but nothing like that happened for the next 30
gaming sessions, so she forgot about it.  Until they got hired to to
security work at an archeological dig that got over-run by UN Colonial
Marines.  And then they all forgot about that after nothing more came of it
over the next 25-ish sessions....  We played 4 to 5 times a month, so it was
about three years of play before the group split up due to some very
unfortunate Real Life happenings...  By that time they were getting the idea
that something was Real Wrong and the UN was Up To Something, but had no
idea what.  I figure one more "incident" and the group would have actively
started trying to figure out what was going on.

        Using the 10-9-8... approach, the pace of the involuntary
involvement of the players subltly begins to accelerate.  Note that any
scenarios resulting from the players investigating don\'t count towards the
count, as it were.... these are key plot points that reveal and/ or expose
pieces and players in the Grand Conspiracy to the PCs.  Anything else they
get into voluntarily just cements into thier heads that they are on the
right/ wrong track.

        It has worked fairly well for me.  If you try it, please let me know
what success you had with it.

Depends on whether I had Sh**loads of money or not...
IMTU, there is a pastime for the filthy rich... munting the Wypoc Dragon
(which has become something of a local gaming legend in Anchorage). I was
rolling encounter tables for Wypoc (J2 from Regina), and came up with a 44
Ton Flying Predator, which, under MT, has a good chance of being able to
hurt an air/raft. Since Wypoc has a corrosive atmosphere, the Dragon is
armored, violent, and hunts by metalic-ion sniffing... Use Big Guns, heavy
environment suits, and remember: While you hunt it, it hunts you!

In fact, I came up with rather large critters for Wypoc... one which shoots
"Spines" from it\'s snout (Grazer), another that is a major armored but
harmless scavenger (A2 F3), and the Dragon. somewhere I have the tables...

For beauty, there\'s Psaydi, or (umm, drawing a blank, the planet with the
skymelon vinyards in TTA). Regina has the Old Capitol, plus lots of
academic and educational resources (IMTU, U of Regina, Regni is one of the
largest, best equipped research facilities in the marches), plus all the
attractions of a major trade center. Regina is also still the Cultural
Capitol of the Marches IMTU, so Regina is a good bet.

Mora has the new capitol, the sector Duchess, and constant noble tourism...
the social circut on Mora starts on 002 and ends on 355... Commoners tend
to avoid it. Mora University is also a major bit. Depot/Spinward Marches is
known for displays on military history, plus the sector\'s Imperial Naval
Acadamy, with it\'s parades, airshows, and other pomp.

There is a Disneyland equivalent somewhere near Regina IMTU.

Whoops, left some words out. Try this...

Group A, seeing themselves as the true representatives of 
the organizations they spring from, might just think of Group B 
as being \'elitest\' or even \'racist\'. There could be some very 
interesting interaction and even direct and covert conflict (of 
the physical variety).

Yeah, I know  :-(

The point was, he actually stopped the tank by just standing there. The
fact that hundreds of demonstrants were gunned down later doesn\'t change
that.

ObTrav: How the ####### do you stop a grav tank this way? I figure it
could be done with a small grav car, but wouldn\'t it be possible to
drive the tank slowly into contact with the car and then slowly move
forward (pushing the car in front of the tank). The tank has a
significantly stronger drive, after all.

Good point.  However, this doesn\'t preclude planetary equivalents
in places like Efate or Jewell  remembering  the  fallen  of  the
Frontier Wars.

And I can also see a combination "rememberance day"  and  protest
on Terra by a minority  of  loyal  Solomani.  Perhaps  a  funeral
march past the enterence to an Imperial Marine  barracks  with  a
coffin drapped with the Solomani  flag,  on  Invasion  Day.  Some
years this would pass off without incident, others there could be
stones thrown at the barracks, and an Imperial flag burned.

As I said, *partly* based on him, *in spirit.* <grin>

Not really. At least, didn\'t sound strange to my japanese 
friends over here <grin>. Mishima linked with *western* pacifism, 
that would certainly be strange. But Mishima style passed through 
buddhism and some thousand years of evolution gives you the above.

The aim of the Private army was to die for, not to kill for, the 
emperor. That was the basic spirit I was referring to, not their 
political objectives.

You or me got something wrong with the japanese mindset. AFAIK, being 
able to plot his suicide for such a long time is a *far* more 
important achievement than passing a physical test. In fact, 
Insurance companies bet that you can\'t plot it for more tha one or 
two years.

The above is IMTU, and, as I said, *partly* based on Mishima. YMMV. 
As for a suicide being theatre, I won\'t comment on this. I am sure 
you realized what you said right after sending it. He *died.*

That was more the idea. The fact is, Mishima\'s aestethics provide a 
good thing to hang on for game purposes. As for the philosophical 
implications of his movement, well, that\'s too off-topic <grin>

IMHO, the courage to actively kill oneself (and Mishima is 
the greatest exponent of this, all times, all places, full stop) plus 
the idea of "willing to die for" just claimed to be coupled with 
pacifism. As I said, the "Mishimans" IMTU were *partly* based in the 
spirit of Mishima-sama. Never said *he* was a pacifist, specially in 
the modern, western-derived sense of the term. ;-)

Anyway, IMTU, YMMV...

I\'ve heard people mention a ringworld in traveller several times but I
have never seen anything in canon. Can someone tell me where it is
located and if it\'s canon?

Thanks,

Possibly, but I invision veterans belonging to multiple groups. Here\'s an 
extreme example:

Lt. Col. Jean Dubois, the Duke of Glisten (quiz: where did I get this name 
from?), Imperial Army Drop Troops, retired. He has won the SEH. He served in 
the marches during the FFW.

He would belong to the SEH Ass., the retired Officers association, the Nobles 
Veterans Association, the Veterans of the Peerage, the Imperial Army 
association, the Imperial Legion, the veterans of Imperial wars assoc.,  the 
veterans of the FFW society, and the Solomani-Imperial Veterans Society.

As much as members on this list talk about rivalries between different 
branches of service (sometimes violent ala fisticuffs...), from my 
observations veterans respect each other, and are more likely to have 
conflicts with civilians. As an example, they could attack civilian 
authorities during the hard times period that have cut off pensions 
(especially if said civilian is supporting a different faction...).

It is in the Hinterworlds, it is called Leenitakot, and it is owned 
by a minor, xenophobic race.

This is from my own personal notes, but it is based on material 
appeared in Challenge 39 and around it (I might have added some bit). 
So, it is canon as far as Challenge is considered canon.
- ----

Leenitakot (Hinterworlds 1432)

 The mainworld in the Leenitakot system in the Hinterworlds (trailing
 and outside of the Third Imperium) is a Chirper world, owned by an
 enigmatic race called "Outcasts of the Whispering Sky," or
 "Stalkers," which governs a small, subsector-sized interstellar
 state. Within the limits of the Leenitakot system lies a ringworld
 apparently built by the Ancients. Imperial and Solomani
 archaeologists have been negotiating expedition rights for decades,
 but to date only four have been granted by the Stalkers, two 
Imperial and two Solomani. The results of these four expeditions have 
puzzled the experts. The inner surface of the ringworld has a surface 
area of 25.000 times that of Terra. It surrounds a star of class M1 V 
Star at a distance of less than 30 Million km, which would make it
 inhabitable and even pleasant if it had a standard atmosphere.
 However, the ringworld is nothing more than a narrow band (less than
 100.000 km wide), without soil, atmosphere or any provisions to
 sustain life. It has been speculated that the ringworld was
 unfinished when the Final War started.

The source is the outer edge of the subsector maps for the Hinterworlds from

Not only did the nanites rebuild the ship, they rebuilt the entire *crew*

Unless you are an actual collector, Supplement 3 isn\'t overly useful.

So THAT\'S where \'The Starcrossed\' came from !!! I\'m going to have to go
dig it out and re-read it...I don\'t believe I\'ve ever seen the TV
series, though parts of it sound familiar. Also, IIRC, as Doug Trumbull
was involved with it, weren\'t some of the \'Silent Running\' models used
in it? I\'m pretty sure I remember seeing one of the domes at a con a
long LONG time ago (DesertCon here in Tucson, mid 70\'s), and there was
some sort of notation like that on the info that came with it.

How about states can join or leave the Imperium by majority vote of 
citizens of the polity in question? That is, by a majority of the 
citizens of the separate state to join, and by a majority of the 
citizens of the *entire Imperium* to leave.

I own a bunch of CT (and, unfortunately, T4) stuff, (although not anything 
particularly rare...) and my own copy machine.  I would be glad to trade 
photocopies with people if they are interested.  I\'d also willingly pay 
costs for some of the items I\'m missing (Secret of the Ancients adventure, 
for example).

        Sorry, that\'s rediculous.  You can\'t hardly get 1100 people to vote
a majority on anything, let alone 11000 *worlds*.  It sounds like a good

Yes, but they weren\'t hoping just to die for the Emperor just to do it--
they had other goals they hoped to accomplish.  Bushi don\'t throw
themselves in front of the enemy hoping to die for the Emperor just
because, there\'s usually some other reason.

that doesn\'t mean it\'s not theater, where does the word "tragedy" come
from?  It was a symbolic act and a manipulative act.  Seppuku, and the
threat of seppuku, often were.

Not being a pacifist myself (ha! right!) I can only say that it seems
really strange to me.  I would think that pacifists aren\'t supposed to
kill, and that that would include themselves.  This kind of supports my
theory that the sort of pacifist who will allow anything to be done to
them or their loved ones rather than fight has a secret death wish.

Mishima-sensei... would probably be rolling over in his grave, but hey...
it\'s just a game!

I\'ve been working on a "dedicated" recovery-only vehicle (no repair shops of 
any kind carried). It has a crew of two (sealed, with NBC protection) and a 
4mm VRFGG for emergency use. It can lift a 200 ton vehicle (most heavy grav 
tanks) and travels at around 200 mph loaded (counting drag from the carried 
vehicle). It has 100 cf of dedicated cargo space; to keep the recovery 
vehicle from being totally overloaded, around 1600 cf of "empty" space was 
added; when not in use as a recovery vehicle, it could serve as a heavy-lift 
cargo carrier with a useful amount of internal space. Total cost is around 
MCr 1.

There would probably be "built-in" hull attachment points on the AFV (slots, 
hooks, etc.). These would be considered to be part of the hull structure and 
thus no extra cost or weight.

Maybe, maybe not. A death wish might not really be all that secret. After
all, it might not be frowned upon the way it has come to be in most parts of
the modern world. After all, Vietnamese Buddhists have a long history of
suicide when they have difficulty rectifying their religious beliefs with
the secular governments of Vietnam. This is an honorable thing to do in that
culture.

The Buddhist traditions in Vietnam were pacifists, in a very real sense.
They had worked, in various ways, to end the war between North and South
Vietnam. With the public self-immolation of Nhat Chi Mai such a death also
became a form of protest that was able to galvanize the population. One of
the most memorable images from the photographic history of the Vietnam War
is that of Quang Duc, who could no longer reconcile his religious beliefs
with the South Vietnamese Diem regime. It set a precedent that a person
could do more in dying, publically and within set traditions, than that
person could do in life. Quang Duc\'s self-immolation wasn\'t the last, there
have been a number since then. Nguyen Van Kinh\'s suicide in 1998 was the
most recent, and it, too served to sway the opinion of the people and served
to bring about a change in the government.

On the other hand, I don\'t think that the way we know pacifism in modernity
is the only way that the concept could evolve. Pacifist movements in the
real world are based around an ideal of pacifism. It is entirely possible
that a utilitarian form of pacifism could develop. After all, the death
penalty - as successful or unsuccessful as it may be in different places -
is an attempt to reduce the amount of killing in a society through killing.
It is "peace through war" in microcosm.

	Back to your original post, In the CT/MT sense there is only one "Grav"
module (as opposed to Contragrav and thrusters). Loosing that means no
more flying, and usually crashing. In this circumstance either the Grav
module can be repaired and the vehicle flies itself out or it too badly
damaged and need to be lifted. 
	In combat, the third possibility is a crew kill, where the vehicle is
largely undamaged but the crew has been killed. Recovery requires only
replacing the crew. 
	Your second option, attaching the Grav pods to a partly or fully
disabled grav vehicle seems like it won\'t work. If I were to design a
grav vehicle, particularly a combat vehicle, the Grav modules are the
weak point (like the tracks on a tank) and I would make sure they were
well protected. Anything capable of damaging the Grav module would
probably also have done significant damage to the remainder of the
vehicle. While you could build the vehicle with thrust attachment
points, usually you would either use the (replaced) grav modules or have
a wrap around lift vehicle. 
	This may easily degenerate into the "Landing unstreamlined ships" flame
war again, which I don\'t want.

Ouch.

On a nice turnaround from Ian\'s comments, one of the Venus Equilateral
stories by George O. Smith (great golden-age stuff, btw) featured an
officious, clueless, aggressively pointy-haired administrator who is put
in command of a crewed deep-space data relay station.  He proceeds to
impose his solutions on all kinds of technical problems, creating an
escalating wave of crises as systems which were working just fine get
\'fixed\'.  The story climaxes with his stomping into the station life
support chief\'s office, demanding to know why the \'Air Plant\' room was
overgrown with filthy weeds, and where the actual air machinery had
disappeared to.  With dawning horror, the life support chief realizes that
the administrator, in a fit of picque at the unacceptable mess, has rooted
up and burned all the "weeds".  Definitely a Dilbert Moment, half a
century ahead of its time...and not a half bad idea for a Trav scenario.

Given that in GT, most vehicles have at least two separate contragravity systems, any of which can lift the entire vehicle, grav pods are almost a nonissue; if its so disabled that all its contragravity systems are gone, its probably falling apart and requires more assistance than a grav pod can offer.

Lighting can be effective but don\'t neglect  other  environmental
factors of your playing area  (such  as  temperature  or  ambient
sound).  I once ran a horror adventure as part  of  a  non-horror
campaign that worked well:  It was based on  "Treasure  Ships  of
The Abyss" from Challenge magazine.  The players were the crew of
an IN Gazelle close escort during the 5FW and  during  a  misjump
they \'encountered\' a Type-M subsidised liner that was trapped  in
jumpspace.  A  linkway  existed  between  the  Gazelle\'s  forward
avionics bay and the Type-M\'s engine room.

Of course one PC goes across to the other  ship  to  explore  and
becomes trapped when the linkway is lost.  Now the main  room  we
were playing in was warm and well lit, but at this stage I  asked
the adventureous player to wait in the spare bedroom  (which  was
less well lit and  a  few  degrees  *cooler*  than  comfortable).
Also, I use sound FX tapes for ambient sounds  ...  a  continuous
loop of starship engine hum plays quietly and reassuringly in the
main room, while the spare  bedroom  is  deathly  quiet.  I  then
continued for 30 minuets with the main group before  joining  the
lone player.  The PC explored the ghost ship  ...  cue  \'temporal
echos\' of the long dead crew and passengers, and  other  \'spooky\'
stuff.  Once the player had become \'used\' to this I switched  the
tables on him by having a small funneral procession interact with
him and pursue him menacingly about  the  ship!  (Total  duration
about an hour.)

Eventually the linkway was restored and the PC rejoined the  main
party ... and the player reentered the main game room:  his  face
ashen!  Since then, whereever funnerals are mentioned in-game the
player goes pale (and I mean player, not PC).  Most gratifying!

That\'s the other point: there\'s safty in numbers ...  so  if  you
want to creep somone out  isolate  them  from  the  rest  of  the
players first and do it one-on-one.

With the X-files, apart from the conspiracy stuff,  most  of  the
shows recycle old material.  The show\'s success here  is  due  to
high production values: to run a creepy gaming  session  remember
style and atmosphere ... but also moderation (I\'ve not been  able
to reproduce the above effect because my players are wise to this
now).

But none of these people, nor the bushi, would choose suicide if there
were not a good reason to die, if something wouldn\'t be accomplished by
it.  

Some American pacifists will allow you to kill them just because you want
to steal them blind.  I protested the reestablishment of the draft in the
US.  I believe in military service for those who choose it and that it is
honorable, I am not a conscientious objector, but I am opposed to
conscription especially in peacetime.  One of the pacifists I worked with
was arguing with someone who said-- what if I wanted to drag this little
lady off here and have some fun with her?  Pointing at me.

The guy said "She\'s not my property.  And I won\'t kill for any reason."

And I just thought, "well buster, if someone attacked you, I guess I won\'t
help you either and you better believe I won\'t sleep with you!"  Not that
I expect my lovers to defend me cuz I\'m a girl-- I\'d do the same for them.
I think that if you can\'t trust someone to protect you when you\'re
vulnerable you don\'t have much of a relationship regardless of your
gender.

I\'ve no problem with saying that willingness to commit suicide in an Asian
society could be linked with pacifism; it just doesn\'t seem to be very
pacifistic to me, especially since seppuku and setting oneself on fire are
extremely violent deaths.

I am not a political idealist of any sort, and hence I don\'t understand
why one\'s own life is not sacred if all lives are sacred (though I am
Japanese-identified enough to understand how suicide can be a sacred act--
the ultimate protest and yes, grand theatre too-- ritual is theatre,
theatre is ritual-- I just don\'t think killing is always wrong, and if I
did, I would think it was wrong to kill yourself too.)  It\'s because I
think my life is sacred that I will defend it, if I need to.

Sorry that this is so rambling.

A LEO friend of mine uses the term "Suicide by Cop" to describe the people 
who want to kill themselves, but can\'t go through the act, so they put

There are some marvelous errors of perspective on that
cover, but based on the size of the airlock hatch and the
bridge deck on top, this is actually closer to 500-700 tons.
It carries the insignia of the Duke of Regina\'s Own Huscarles,
so it is either a Ducal starship (personal Yacht?) or one of
the SDBs maintained by the Duke\'s Own.

The little one on the back cover is 100-200 tons of tramp

Well, you have the problem of one more dimension of freedom.... Grav Tanks
essentially maneuver like helicopters (Except under TNE). So it doesn\'t
have to turn, it can just skip to one side or another... then charge... The
question is simply which has more G\'s of accelleration... the one which can
accellerate faster can block movemnet along a plane perpendicular to the
tanget between the two craft. The more G\'s the blocker has, the more
hemispherical the blocking becomes... assuming both pilots are able to make
the most of their machines.

So while your typical commuter car can\'t do much, a custom grav bike can 
probably keep a tank at bay (until the tank decides to just ride right over 
the bike, "by accident" :) )

Well, maybe.  The problem is that in order to effectively block a tank as a protester, you need to make sure that if the tank moves forward, you will be seriously injured.  If a grav tank moves slowly forward into a grav bike, it will probably just shove the grav bike forward (obviously, a high speed collision will do more damage, but there\'s a difference between \'not moving\' and \'ramming the tank\')

I\'m not sure that it will just shove it away.  Once the tank begins moving 
towards you, you can set the bike\'s comp to "hold position" (or do it 
manually), and the tank, when making contact, will, for a while, be 
fighting the bike\'s propulsion.  This could cause damage to you and to the 
bike.

A ground tank can\'t just "shove" a typical sedan (let alone a bike) out of 
the way without doing at least some damage to the vehicle....  Sam would 
apply here, but perhaps less so.

It depends on how strong the bike is, and on whether its designed with halfway-sane safety systems ;)

If you\'re pushing the vehicle forwards or backwards, you can shove it just fine (you\'ll cause transmission damage most likely, but that doesn\'t look impressive on TV).  It\'s only really dramatic if you try to force it in a direction it isn\'t designed to go in, and grav vehicles are generally designed to go in any direction.

Years of watching Hollywood films with train smashes has led me to

Also the locals there want to limit outside contacts, IIRC.  Not a happy
picture for the tourist board. :)

My big problem with the various forms of space racing as spectator sports
is that there is so little for the \'spectators\' to actually see.  You can
watch the contestants grouped at the start plane near some orbital
station, then watch them all move away, jockeying for initial
position...then the entire remainder of the race takes place out of visual
range.  I suppose you could have excursion boats following the pack, but
even there for any reasonable course length and dynamics it\'d be tough to
have more than one or two contestants simultaneously visible, and there
would be little or nothing visibly happening in any case.

Followed, of course, by the traditional \'hiding in bed wincing\'
festivities on the remainder of 001. :)

Another one from MTU, way back when...

Casinos in orbital cities around Rhylanor.  Famously gaudy and overdone,
styled on every imaginable (and a few you-don\'t-want-to-imagine) theme. 
Along with \'normal\' games for the masses, there are always plenty of
high-stakes games and tournaments available for the big spenders. 
Needless to say, the orbitals are full of down-on-their luck spacers
hoping to win their way out of debt; this is a legendarily good place to
pick up cheap help with few questions asked, if you know where to look. 
There\'s a well-known joke about the "Rhylanor Success Story" -- a spacer
who arrives in-system in his leaky old Far Trader, and leaves a week later
in a shiny new Tukera liner. :)

I \'m willing to do this for rare materiel such as some FASA stuff,
Marischal,  and Paranoia Press things.

I don\'t see that it\'s neccessary for anything published for CT by GDW, as
that stuff is almost always available, and I believe some of it\'s still
available from Marc.

Also, for some stuff, I\'d probably prefer providing electronic copy, as it
would give me an excuse to keep putting together my electronic copies, so
the originals can be stored appropriately.

Actually this does sound like a number of different sailing races right
now. There\'s a series that was originally sponsored by some beer maker
that was essentially a party that moved through the course with the
boats racing from bar to bar ;-) All the interesting spectator stuff
happens in port, the racing itself is largely beside the point except,
perhaps, to the crews.

	Only way I can think of it is the way some protestors try to
stop/hinder whaling ships, etc. ... get a bunch of people in
air/rafts & grav cars, and just generally fill the area around the
grav tank. Again, something that loses its effectiveness if the grav
tank crew isn\'t willing to cooperate ...

I\'ve a technical question for all the MacOS 8.5+ users here: How do 
you create an index (by content) of a CD-ROM using Sherlock? By 
default, the Sherlock search engine will not let you create a file 
index of contents for a non-writeable drive. Do I need to 
re-initialise or partition the hard drive and and copy the CD to it, 
generate the index, then re-burn the CD?

ObTrav: I have the HIWG CD ROM, which has a vast quantity of 
information on it. Sadly, this is hard to  find material on even with 
the indexes Bryan has created. I would like to index it using 
Sherlock so the \'search by file content\' becomes available as a way 
to look for information. (Non-MacOS 8.5 owners - this searches 
content of files in a similar way that web search engines work).

Depends on the pacifist. Some believe that _any_ violence is wrong. Others
believe that you have th right to commit violence on yourself, but not on
anyone else. Like with most believes, pacifism comes in many flavours.

    How about a 50,000 dton cruiser?
    It should be able to perform three basic missions:
        1. Ship of the Line.
        2. Carrier.
        3. Troop Transport.
    Sorta a multi-mission ship.

   Yup, for example, American Victim Disarmament activist Josh Sugarman is 
a devout religious pacifist who believes that the act of defending one\'s 
self is as great a sin as the violence committed by the attacker.
   He\'s practical enough to know that he can\'t violent criminals from 
attacking innocent people, so he\'s doing his best to make sure that their 
victims will be free of the sin of self-defense...

It may be ridiculous, but that is what is required for an Australian state
to secede from the commonwealth. Two thirds majority in the state is
required to pass, and two thirds of the states must agree.

Incidently in Western Australia the secession referendum was held three
times. It was passed the first time it came up in Western Australia, and
voted down on the two subsequent occurances.

How was the original vote dealt with by the Commonwealth? It was ignored.

I thought that what was at issue here was public suicide for the purpose of
protest by pacifists, as brought up by Carlos in several posts. In the
original post, there *were* "good reasons" for the life fighters to die (one
of the examples that was given was a war started by a corporation, if I
remember correctly).

My point was simply that pacifism, as generally defined (which is an
opposition to war or violence as a means of settling disputes) does not rule
out suicide, for protest or other reasons. This is especially true in the
case of Carlos\'s original post. The pacifist group was made up of folks who
believed that a person could kill themself, but not anybody else. I don\'t
see this as different from pacifists who believe in euthanasia in the real
world, for example.

Such a culture doesn\'t have to be asian in flavor, really. A culture that is
strongly individualistic could develop to such a point. I\'m actually
surprised that there aren\'t more folks who are pacifistic / right-to-suicide
types in America.

Even then, we\'re being ferociously anti-English --
having elevated an _Irish_ family to royal status.

On that note, at what point do the PC\'s (and, indeed, the public at large) consider themselves Imperial citizens as opposed to their cultural/racial heritage ?  That is, in this country, it takes something like an average of five to six generations, apparently, before an immigrant family considers itself to be \'Australian\'.  I\'m wondering how long it takes before cultural/racial loyalties are no longer considered relevant or pertinent by the populace ?

Okay, now as one of those pacifists who has come to a place where I
believe that all violence (even in self-defence) is ethically wrong, I would
like to suggest that that last statement could have been rephrased a
little :*>

However, just because a person will not use violence does not mean that
they will stand by and let an innocent be harmed while doing nothing. On
the one occassion where it was an issue for me, I choose to place myself
in a position where the intended victim could not be harmed without first
removing me. I\'m quite good at not getting hit and by the time I had been
removed, the intended victim had been able to escape.

It\'d be like the Paris-Dakar Rally, or the Iditarod.  Everybody would
gather to admire the racers at the start, watch them leave in a staggered
start, then follow the event from a comfortable chair in a bar.

After all, people will stand in pouring rain for hours to see the Tour
D\'France racers shoot by in less than ten minutes.

AFAIK, none of the non-GDW material is covered by Marc\'s rule, as he
doesn\'t hold the copyright.

The last owner of the FASA material was, I believe, the owner of Seeker. No
idea how to contact him, though.  While FASA kindly gave me permission to
make copies, Seeker revoked that permission when they bought the copyright.

Roger Sanger, of course, owns _most_ of the DGP material, except for the
bits he hasn\'t paid for yet; these are still the property of their authors,
who would have to be contacted individually. I would, for example, not like
to see people copying any of the material that I wrote for DGP, as that
would interfere with my attempts to sell a GT version to Pyramid.

Didn\'t the same thing happen in Canada around 1946-1947? I think I recall
that Newfoundland or Nova Scotia had a referendum on leaving Canada which
was ignored.

Actually, the crew compartment would be the weak point ...

I assume that CG units are under armor and protected like everything else. 
The attachment points for emergency CG modules would be external. Not that 
such units would provide lift only; unless the thrusters on the disabled 
vehicle still worked, it would still have to be towed or carried (preferably 
towed, since it doesn\'t require a specialized recovery vehicle).

a few grav vehicles being disabled without ever being hit by the enemy:

Given the poor HT (8-9) and short maintenance intervals of heavy
grav vehicles, in actual war many are likely to suffer breakdowns,
as vehicles are kept in the field far longer than is safe. Ironically,
very heavy vehicles are more likely to be pushed too far than their
more robust bretheren.

(I also assume that an average military mechanic has skill 12-14,
which isn\'t unreasonable -- unless your head mechanic is Scottish,
you can\'t afford to miss more than one or two trips to the garage).

Here are some relevant numbers (using the vehicles from Star Mercs):

Vehicle                  HT        Interval

Utility Grav Sled        12        82 hours

TL 10,
Light Grav Tank           9        10 hours
Medium Grav Tank          8         7 hours
Heavy Grav Tank           8         5.5 hours

Meson Sled               12         7.6 hours
Intrepid Tank             8         5 hours

See Vehicles, 2/e or Compendium II for maintenance rules.

(After looking over the stats for the meson sled and Intrepid grav
tank, it makes me wonder if "real" combat grav vehicles would be
more like the sled -- faster and stealthier*, rather than the
plodding dinosaur of the heavy grav tank).

* -- radical emission cloaking covers radical sound supression

This is something that I\'ve been thinking about at great length in creating
the background for my "Petty States" Traveller Universe variant. Indeed,
it\'s been something of a stumbling block for me. The official Traveller
Universe is kind of odd in this respect, though. Implicitly, the progression
goes like this: "nationalism / globalism / interstellar statism". This is
never stated directly, it\'s just the impression that I get.

My own take on the official Traveller Universe is that the global,
circum-stellar, subsector, sector and domain identifications are far
stronger for the average Imperial citizen than identification with the
Imperium is. I think that there will be a group of people who consider
themselves to be "Imperial Citizens" first and foremost, but there is no
doubt in my mind that they would be in the extreme minority.

It also depends on how you view the Imperium. If you view it as actually
being feudal (as presented in canon), then it\'s safe to assume that the
*largest* community that Imperial citizens will identify with is most likely
the domain that they live in, or were born in. In my opinion, it\'s much more
likely that most people will identify themselves with their world, or a
larger community with an established history and culture. That\'s what the
social structure looks like under feudalism, indeed that\'s what feudalism
requires.

On the other hand, if the Imperium is distinctly "post-Enlightenment" in
general structure (also as portrayed in canon), then it becomes a bit more
difficult. If I were to play in the Official Traveller Universe, I would
imagine the Imperium akin to France during the reign of Napoleon, stuck
somewhere between the local identification that prevailed in feudal and
aristocratic society and the national identification that would come to
prevail eventually.

Keep in mind that a concept such as "nationalism"[1] - or in the case of the
Imperium, maybe it could be called hypernationalism - is not a "given". It
is something that has to evolve, or that has to be deliberately created.
There was a time, for example, that the concept of a united France, a united
Germany or a United Kingdom (and so on) in the sense that they exist today,
were utterly unthinkable. Even in the United States (which was *born*, in
theory, as unified) identification on the national level was slow in coming.

[1] Please note that I\'m using the term loosely here. When I say
"nationalism" I also mean the concept that is now known as "racialism", in
which identity is drawn heavily from a shared history, culture and tradition
but distinctions are drawn based on gross morphology: hair color and
texture, skin color, variations in body and facial structure. The growth of
racialism and nationalism are linked to the point that it would take
entirely too long to disentangle the two from each other, and it would be
utterly useless.

Marc,

I think it\'s looking good, and I hope you don\'t mind us doing a
little beta testing for you.

I just looked at your site with both IE 4 and NS 4.04, here are my
comments about each of the pages.

Home:  It appears that all the features of the Home page are
working now for both IE and NS.

Site Index:  In IE, nothing displays except a failed graphic box, it
worked last weekend, so something has changed for the worse.  In NS
there is garbage at the top (the failed graphic, I suspect) followed
by the site map.  There is only a single column, and from the
source, I see you have a /table missing at the end of the left
column.

FAQ:  Looks fine in IE.  In NS there is a missing /table at the end
of the left column again, causing it to not display.  This same
problem crops up in *all* the sub-FAQ pages, too.  Adding </table>
on the line just before <!--RIGHT COLUMN--> will fix it. 

Links:  Fine in IE, but is missing that </table> again.  This is
obviously a difference between IE and NS.  IE obviously doesn\'t need
you to end one table before displaying another and NS does.  IE is
perfectly happy with inclusion of </table> though.

News:  and Traveller:  Exactly the same as links.  You need to
include </table> after the left column.

Like I said, I think it\'s looking good.  The graphic garbage
perplexes me, but the missing left column is easy enough to fix.

As I understand it, ringworlds that circle a star would be unstable
and wouldn\'t last.  Is that right?

How about a ringworld that doesn\'t circle a star?  Or more
accurately, a huge ring space station.

Let\'s say we have a huge ring station (or mini-ringworld) that is
500,000 km in diameter and 20,000 km high rotating perpendicular to
it\'s orbit around a star.  The inner and outer rims of the tube
making up the interior of the ring are 100 km apart.  Inside this
tube you would have room for mountains, seas, and continents.
Several worlds worth as (3.1x10^10 km) is close to 60 earths.

Inside the tube habitable conditions could be maintained.  The
atmosphere would be retained inside the tube by the walls and
circulated by heat.  Light and heat could be transmitted from the
side wall (facing the sun) to the "roof" and reflected down.  Move
the mirrors with solar powered moters, and you can simulate sun (and
moon if you want) travelling across the sky. giving your days,
seasons and years.  Radiators on the dark side keep the system in
heat equilibrum.  

The dynamics of continent building is obviously a problem if the
system is meant to be self-maintaining.  I know it\'s verboten in
Traveller, but I envision nano-technology taking care of that.  How
I don\'t know. <g> 

IAC, something like this would be entirely "beyond known levels of
technology", but might be more doable (and survivable) for
"mysterious pre-cursor" races than true ringworlds.

Am I totally off the beam with this idea?

It would certainly be fun !

One thing I always wanted to know was whether John Varley\'s "Titan" series
was influenced by or was an influence on, the Journal Entries, or whether
they are completely unrelated.

My apologies, I did not mean to insult. I didn\'t mean that it would be

Pardon my saying so, but this guy sounds like some kind of nut. Not even
for self-defence? In some circumstances, that\'s a route to annihilation.
I\'m having some problem wrapping my mind around this kind of headspace...

>ob-trav: Apply this twisted logic to make aliens appear really alien.

Especially those on the receiving end of an invasion. This would make for
an interesting scenario for a military unit: they\'re ordered to capture
a particular planet, and expect heavy opposition... what they get is 
something quite different. It could pose an ethical problem for the PCs --
the only way to accomplish their mission as stated is by force, but if the
opposition will not put up a fight, that seems hardly sporting...

The only referenda on *leaving* Canada were in Quebec, in 1981 and 1995.
Both times, the response was "No", though in the second one it was by a
very slim margin...

Newfoundland joined Canada in 1949 -- before that, it was an quasi-
independent, self-governing colony of Great Britain (like Canada was 
before 1867). Newfoundland held a referendum in or shortly before 1949,
with the question being whether or not to *join* Canada. The answer, of
course, was "Yes".

  That would have been Newfoundland entering the confederation.

  One supposes that worlds still join of their own free will without
even being aware of any Impy efforts to coerce them - which could be
a pleasant surprise or an unwelcome disruption, depending on the effect
it has on your departments budget :>

You might want that to be a majority of the nobles, as they run the
Imperium, but then they are only a proxy for the Emperor. The Emperor
*is* the Imperium so it would be his decision. So to leave the
Imperium you would have to pension the Emperor. If you are on the
frontiers this will take years, and by that time your decision to
leave may have changed.

Most people probably don\'t regard this as canon, but there is a ringworld at
Northstar (Beyond 2819).  Beyond has other interesting locations as well but
it doesn\'t fit too well with canon - I think the existence of this sort of
technology would have a fairly large impact on Imperial policy.

Also of interest:
Pleiades II (0818-A00266B-E) which is described as a rosette of 7 planetoids
The I\'Sred*Ni Heptad - where the worlds themselves are arranged in a
geometric pattern.
Normal (2719-C8651FF-A) Which is described as a \'GDW preserve\'.  A dig at
GDW??  Note this system is adjacent to the ringworld.

You may want to consider putting in the capacity to deadlift the 
Intrepid in case you can\'t in get to the CG modules / power the CG 
modules if the AFV comes down in a difficult place (swamp, river 
etc). 192 tonnes is going to sink...

It does beg the question where on the Intrepid are the modules 
installed, and are there more redundancies than an air raft with 4 
units.

Of course, those people who haven\'t read the book and only seen the 
film will not understand this reference. :-/

On the Film: (The presence of POWs on the Bug home world is the 
reason that the human forces do not glass the planet with nukes in 
the book. This answers the question the film poses in \'why are they 
landing on the Bug\'s planet when they can obviously control the space 
above it and land nukes on it?\'. Sadly, it doesn\'t answer the film 
questions \'where is the power armour\', \'where is the air support\', 
\'where are the heavy weapons\', \'where are the tactics\'. Nice CGI, 
shame about the execution.

ObTrav: I actually think the MI starships look like they should be in 
Traveller.

The Whitbread (spell ?) around the world ?

Now they have on board video cameras, and satalight uplinks so the
people interested get to see what is happening on the boats. The crews
never get to see the opposition as they are always miles apart from
each other.

This is how I had always envisioned space races. There are points in a
system where the competitors have to pass, say a mile wide area of
space next to a gas giant moon, to complete the race. The spectators
watch at these points.

That doesn\'t stop RL  sports  TV  trying  to  show  *golf*  as  a
\'spectator sport\'.  Of course someone  once  suggested  that  the
cameramen at these events were all aging veteran WW2  searchlight
operators (scanning the sky looking for the ball  in  flight).  I
suppose the Regina GG races could be broadcast to  spectators  on
tri-dee by using a combination of ...

  sweeps and providing \'graphics\'),
- - following the magnetic sail racers with  thruster-plate  camera
  platforms,
- - filling in  with  long  rambling  interviews  with  contestants
  (recorded mid-race),
- - and the obligatory documentaries about the  race,  past  races,
  craft construction,  and  crew  training  ad-nausium  (recorded
  pre-race).

And don\'t forget the sponsors\'  logos  emblazoned  all  over  the
giant sails.

Indeed am have most recently been researching that very subject, as I am
involved in spec\'ing out an electronic logbook (an elog) at a National
Accelerator Facility. In my research I found that there is ***NO*** existent
copy of the first email message. No one even knows who sent it or what data
it contained. Based on recent problems Microsoft and other corporations have
had with email I know that some companies are being counseled ***not*** to
archive email. After all if you don\'t archive it the courts can\'t subpoena
it.

I\'m not quite sure what you mean by "perpendicular", but this could be a
problem.  I /think/ you mean that the spin axis of the ringworld should
pass through the star.  This would be consistant with the lighting
technique that you discuss later.

This will be a problem as the ringworld moves in its orbit around the
star.  Left to its own devices, the ringworld spin axis will be fixed in
inertial space (* see note at end).  If at one moment in time it points
through the star, then 90 degrees later in the orbit the ringworld will
be edge on to the star.

To allow the ringworld spin axis to track the star in its orbit would
require huge flows of angular momentum.  We play similar tricks with
low-earth orbit satellites in sun-synchronous orbits, using the Earth\'s
J2 gravity gradient harmonic.  As stated here, the only bodies are the
ringworld and the star.  I can\'t see right now how to take angular
momentum from the star, but I may just be being dense.  Certainly, one
could have a ringworld that encircled a planet that continually tracked
the star.  It wouldn\'t be stable, but the control forces required would
be small.

If we are postulating technologies that can build ringworlds, we can
also look at what might be required to have a ringworld track the star
in such a way.  Thrusters (mass-expelling or magical Traveller versions)
would be one obvious way.  Assuming the ringworld is rotating
counter-clockwise as viewed from the star, and the orbit progresses
counter-clockwise as seen from some arbitrary "above", you would need a
thruster at the "top" of the ringworld pushing in towards the star and
another at the "bottom" pushing out.  The top and bottom change as the
ringworld rotates, of course.  Thus, you would need an array of
thrusters around the rim.  At any given time, two would be firing.  That
could make for a nice visual effect.

Another approach would be to store a large quantity of angular momentum
somewhere on the ringworld.  By selectively absorbing and releasing
momentum on different axes as the orbit progresses, the spin axis of the
ringworld could be forced to track the star.  Storing ringworld sized
angular momentum in small objects (ie smaller than a ringworld) would
require very rapidly spinning flywheels with some sort of motor to speed
them up or slow them down, and possibly to change their spin axis. 
Modern spacecraft use reaction wheels, momentum wheels, and control
moment gyros to serve the same function.

The angular momentum storage need not be all in one place.  Perhapse
some sort of a "slaver sunflower" type plant with a gyro in the trunk
that is found all over the ring?  _The Raft_ (author momentarily
forgotten) has some cute trees with significant angular momentum
storage.  Adventure seed: an offworld plague/parisite is destroying the
trees.  Can the brave PCs stop it before the nutations destroy the
ringworld?

If you do want to put a ringworld in orbit around a star, the simplest
way would be to spin it so that it is always seen edge on to the star. 
Perhaps that is what you suggested in the first place and this is all a
bit misunderstanding.  The problem then is getting light in.  You can
make the outside wall transparent, so that the starlight shines in.  As
the ring spins, different areas see light so you have a sort of
day/night cycle.  Unfortunately, if you\'re using the spin for artificial
gravity then the light comes up from the floor!  You can\'t lay down soil
for plants to grow in or it gets dark again.

* Obscure note on spacecraft dynamics:
Okay, so the spin axis would not remain fixed in inertial space for all
time.  Gravity gradient torques over the course of the orbit would
induce nutation.  Oceans on the ringworld would absorb the nutation
energy.  Eventually the ringworld spin axis would have rotated 90
degrees to the later case that I described, with the spin axis parallel
to the orbit axis.  This situation is described as a Thomson
Equilibrium, as described in:
Thomson, W. T.: "Spin Stabilization of Attitude Against Gravity Torque,"
J. Astronaut. Sci., 9, 31-3 (1962).
I have not actually read that article -- I took the reference from
_Spacecraft Attitude Dynamics_ by P. C. Hughes (1986) which is a good
introduction to the subject.

How does the ring detect that it\'s sliding out of position?

The way that springs to mind is sensors at regular intervals, and some
sort of computer comparing sunlight intensity registered at the
different sensors.

While many of us think that GDW is extinct, part of the large hive-like
organism survives on this backwater world, far from the eyes of AAB. ;-)

What\'s the state of gravetic technology in Traveller? I\'ve heard mention
that ship lasers use gravic lenses to give them their massive range. I seem
to recall one of the versions using repulser technology for point defense.
Having already seen grav belts and grav vehicles used in the game, the
thought that hydraulics and winches would be used at GTL10/12 strikes me as
very unlikely. I could buy high gravity filed technology (as used in ship
laser weapons) being a very short range application. This would explain the
6G limit on inertial compensators, and prevent the ST "tractor beam" for use
from ship to ship. It should allow things like "attactor pads" to clamp
non-magnetic objects together. Dozens of applications here, including
"non-magnetic" space boots for use in zero g, and contragrav lifting units
that can gravically clamp onto the heavy object to be lifted. Canon busting
tech or within parameters?

The aim of the private army was to bring glory to the Emperor.  They do 
that best by killing his enemies.  Another way to bring glory to the 
Emperor is to die well in his service.  The second way is not nearly as 
good.  Take the story of the 47 Ronin for example, they brought honor to 
their Lord by killing his enemy.  Their collective suicide just follow 
through.  They had the commitment to take their own lives in atonement for 
the crime of killing their Lord\'s enemy.

   The physical was a test to qualify to fly a plane, just *once*, for the 
glory and honor of the Emperor and his nation.  He felt that he failed the 
test due to his own nervousness.  i.e. he worried himself sick, and that 
was the cause of his personal failure at the hour of his nation\'s and his 
Emperor\'s greatest need.

No, I meant exactly what I typed.  Yukio Mishima was considered one of 
*the* greatest authors of post-war Japan.  He was also a playwright and 
screenplay author.  He stared in many of his theatre and movie 
productions.  In a fair number of them, his character took his own 
life.  This is one way he practiced the act that he probably knew long in 
advance that would end his own life.

As it has been pointed out before on this list, often in Japanese culture, 
a ritual suicide is a statement.  Be it personal, political or 
social.  It\'s done to drive home a point.  Mishima wanted a return to a 
militaristic Japan with the Emperor as the actual, controlling head of 
state.  He was willing to commit himself body and soul to that.  The only 
peace he wanted was a Pax Nippon.

Besides, He was deathly afraid of not leaving behind a good looking 
corpse.  :-)

 >> Given all that, I think the concept is certainly interesting, and the name

     Thousands of years in the future, pacifists could be calling 
themselves "Mishimans" with a straight face, but a serious professor of 
Earth history would find it damn odd.

May I suggest the really excellent book: <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0374524645/eclipsewebwarren">Th 
e Life & Death of Yukio Mishima"</A> by Henry Scott Stokes
A lot of Mishima\'s work is still in print, very interesting reading.  One 
of stories, "The Sailor Who Fell From Grace with the Sea" was turned into a 
movie with Kris Kristofferson.

One option could be how the media is covering those "survival" races that
recently have become popular.  (I/d/i/o/t/s contestants doing things like
running over the Atlas Mountains in teams.)  Since actual race takes days
and is spread out over a vast area, they simply film the entire thing and
edit it together into an interesting sports program.

If all goes to plan there should be another 101 Patrons available in 
a Little White Book from BITS this month. Hopefully that means it 
should be in the US for Christmas, or early January 2000.

The new adventures should be there for Christmas if all goes well...

I guess this means that T5 will be more like CT (which was, IIRC the
intention). Sounds good to me... I only really know T4, but from the
poll, I realize that the other editions are probably better in many
ways, or at least more well liked.

Never mind. In either case, Traveller is Traveller.

Ick no, not again. Most overused plot device in this supposedly hard sf game.
Gearheads can usually find several ways round this and point out major flaws in
your science when you do it too. Unless it is very well thought out this is one
of the fastest ways of turning sf into fantasy. Use sparingly.

This, and the perennial crashing ship scenario are my pet sf hates.

I can\'t see how this can be correct.  There aren\'t very many fifth or sixth
generation \'Australians\', unless you\'re talking about indigenous people. 
Most present day Australians are people who migrated here this century, or
their descendants.

A curiousity:  apparently about half of the \'Australian\' troops that fought
in the First World War had been born in Britain.  I\'m pretty sure that this
is a higher proportion of British-born people than existed in the general
Australian population at the time.  It may have some relationship with the
defeat of the two referenda about conscription, too.

An anecdote:  a distant relative of mine, Paddy Brosnan (gee, I wonder
where his family came from:  Bulgaria?) threw an egg at the Prime Minister
during the anti-conscription campaign.  The local (Queensland) cops refused
to arrest him, saying it was a federal matter, and not their problem.  The
result was the formation of the Australian Federal Police.  The PM (Billy
Hughes) tried to use this incident to discredit the anti-conscriptionists,
but still lost - twice.

OBTRAV:  An Imperial noble comes to town to drum up support for some
unpopular cause, and gets pelted with some suitable material.  The local
cops do nothing....  (and so on, in direct conversion to Traveller mode).  

This probably works best in a Rebellion setting.  There was an incident in
Survival Margin where Dulinor\'s daughter Isis got stuff thrown at her, but
in this case her guards opened fire on the crowd.

"Law and Order" is always a good political catchcry for incompetent,
corrupt and/or  generally evil politicians (nobles, or whatever).

Yes. Check out District 268 of the Spinward Marches. Most of the worlds are
independant, but associate worlds of the Imperium. So they don\'t have to be
members of the Imperium, but receive (at least some of) the benefits of
membership. Sophonts of those worlds seem to be able to enter the Imperium
without hinderance, and even serve in the military. At least, that\'s what a
character detailed in the Tarsus (1138 District 268) supplement from GDW does.
How much of that you accept as canon is up to you.

I don\'t know if the independant worlds pay taxes or not. It\'s some time since I
read the supplement. I guess I better hurry up and re-read it as my GM would
like to look at it too.

Rather like some of the New Age Wiccans around here, who ignore an awful

Citizens of the Imperium have little to no say in the affairs of the Imperium.
They don\'t get a vote.

The Emperor is the only citizen that can decide which worlds are or are not
allowed into the Imperium. Once a member, he is the only citizen that can
decide to let them leave the Imperium. His decisions are backed up by the full
weight
of the Imperial Navy, Army and Marine forces. Citizens who have a problem with
the
Emperor\'s decisions can see any of the above agencies to register a complaint.

:-)

Any world that wants to leave the Imperium would have to send someone
to formally petition the Emperor for their release from the Imperium.
They would almost certainly have to involve the sector Duke/Archduke
for their case to be heard at all.
This would be a long, drawn out process and involve lots of intrigue,
back-stabbing and deceit as different groups pro and anti try to ensure
the success/failure of the discussions.

Sounds like a -great- plot thread. Maybe even a campaign.

Amen to that.  I\'ve met some mighty narrow minds on both sides of the
tracks.  But I\'d have to say from personal experience that most of the
churches these days do little or no good anymore.  I tried one here in New
Hampshire and it was pretty lame.

That\'s a good question.  I think most Imperial citizens think of
themselves as Vilani first, which is not too different from being
Imperial.  Most local cultures are based on the Ziru Sirka, which
dominated the same region of space for nearly 10,000 years and which
actively Vilanified every world it conquered.

1) Being in a race
I just spent the day in a sailboat race in San Francisco Bay.  Because
the boats in the race were of different classes, the racers won\'t know
who placed where until the committee compares times and handicaps and
posts the rankings on a web page.  Races in the Far Future can have
similar issues.

2) Engineering a race
Manoeuvre drives under at least High Guard and Book 2 have 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, or 6 Gs of acceleration.  A race under, for example, Mayday or Book 2
rules will end in a tie if the vessels are both of the same G-rating. 
That\'s not very interesting to play.  How do you handle races, if at
all?  I have never done a race, but I\'ve thought about it a little.  

One approach is to break each drive rating into fractions of a G, and
allow fractional increases or decreases in acceleration capability
depending on availability of power for the M-drive (taking systems
off-line), design issues, maintenance, damage, and maybe engineering
skill (but I canna break the laws of physics more than once per episode,
Captain!).  

Another approach is to make the race revolve around handling various
obstacles, like the gravity of a world.  A race involving landing and
registering arrival could also be gamed out with efficiency of takeoff
and landing becoming a major issue.

Races involving jumping are more difficult, as the time in jump has a
randomization element, making it more a game of chance than a sport.

I was under the impression that the races discussed as tourist
attractions involved light-sail ships, rather than traditional
thruster-plate or HEPlaR driven ships.  With light-sails, one can
encounter any number of variables, and ship-handling becomes more of an
issue.  FF&S2 discusses such vessels on page 67, and in Table 169.  To
date, AuricTech Shipyards has neither built nor designed such a vessel.

I disagree more than I can express by way of email. There are segments of
the Imperium who view themselves as culturally distinct, the Darmine, the
Ilelish, the Antereans, those along the Solomani Rim, etc. I think that
those who consider themselves to be *Vilani* first and foremost would be
relatively small.

>Most local cultures are based on the Ziru Sirka,

I don\'t know about this. The sheer amount of government types which can be
found in a given subsector or sector is pretty astonishing. Granted,
government types do not a culture make, but the government code is a strong
indicator as to where a planets\' inhabitants are culturally.

>which

>actively Vilanified every world it conquered.


The question is, of course, what Vilanification consists of and in what way
they did whatever it was they did. I remember reading that the those who
were able to adapt to the Vilani way of life (or culture) did better under
the Ziru Sirka than those who weren\'t. In this respect, it can be understood
that the Vilani actively sought to assimilate cultures. However, there\'s
also the factor of what the Terrans / Solomani did when they blew through
the Ziru Sirka. After all, the speed with which they conquered the First
Imperium doesn\'t really support the idea that all of these worlds identified
themselves as strongly as you suggest with Vilani.

Then there\'s the Long Night, when the majority of worlds in Imperial space
had to learn to adjust to being worlds again. Toss in a pocket empire here,
assimilation by a new interstellar polity, and you\'ve got a simmering brew
of worlds that have very little in common with each other.

I\'m not arguing that the imprint of Vilani culture wouldn\'t be felt across
the Imperium, but I don\'t believe that it would be in the form of direct
identification. Cultural (and "national") identifications are anything but
permanent.

share a common interest (Linux for example).

2. Traveller News Service is used by SJG as a hook system to help players and
Game Masters, and allows a meta story to be created.

3. There are regular campaigns ,set in the M:1100 of G:T, many of which use
common source material (cannon and data from the TML).

Why not link these ideas together and create an open Traveller News Service?

Using the base date from the SJG TNS, we create a bbs where campaign hooks, post
action reports, new technology, help and whatnot can be posted for players and
GM can interact with the galaxy at large?

Example: Mercenary tickets can be posted, which other GM\'s may use. News from a
game based in the Solomani rim can influence a Core based campaign, which could
then influence a Spinward Maches game. Characters can be shared (especilly
villans), different millue can be used (a simple icon showing if it is CT/GT,
MT, TNE or T4).

Date consistance can be maintained by using SJG as a baseline, and subtract 2
months per sector to get a campaign date for each campaign in the CT/GT
timeline.

Can it fly (if Marc and Loren sign off on it of cause), I think it can. Thuddd

1.  Help wanted ads of all kinds:  Ads for crew, for bodyguards,
couriers, or whatever.

2.  Minor news stories from any old system:  weather (droughts or
storms that hurt crops), crimes, various scandels or political
affairs.  Or sports for that matter.

3.  Announcements of discoveries, inventions, the formation of new
companies, the collapse of old ones and so on.

Yes, this *would* be a good resource.

I\'d go for gathering just enough sensor data on the racers to plug them

the mod cons :- background stars rearranged into advertising logos ;
using planets and asteroids as billboards - as well as the racers
themselves.

Actually being \'on the scene\' would be quite dull, as Craig Berry has

Laser grav focussing dates to the TNE era and was a device to keep the
size of laser focal arrays down. The technology didn\'t appear to spill
over into any other area, which I have always thought a little strange.

CT (High Guard) and MT used repulsors as a defensive modality. The
versions available at average Imperial TLs are quite inefficient
compared to those that arise when you can build tractor and manipulator
(effector) beams.

Yep. For example, there\'s the gravisonic modulator that enables low
berthing without cryogenic fluids.
	Applications of this device could range from \'lighters\' to \'ovens\' to
\'furnaces\', \'refigerators\', etc..

Using modified grav lensing technology, mechanical pumps, winches, etc.
_are_ obsolete.

Vehicles, like buildings, would have gravitic reinforcement. The 6G
limit on inertial compensators strikes me as a rather arbitrary one.
	Another way of setting up inertial compensators would be to use them as
crash protectors - the tremendous decelerations during a collision are
shunted into a storage bank (the vehicle\'s frame and hull?), and a crew
pod ejected to safety.
	If nothing else, this would mean crashing vehicles of advanced tech
levels would probably explode on impact as the storage banks overloaded.
This may be useful for a more cinematic campaign <g>.

None of the above is canon, but none of these things are talked about in
canon either IIRC.

Same is true for the Sydney-to-Hobart - doesn\'t mean that people aren\'t
interested. There, they put a few reporters onto a few boats, have choppers do
fly-bys of the boats, talk to some by radio, and keep track of the fleet on a
map.

Translate this to the 3I and it might even work!
     * reporters with radios or meson comms (lasers might push the \'ship the
wrong way!);
     * 6G shuttles fly past a few select boats (speed them up following rough
courses prior to the race, then attempt to match vectors along the way);
     * talk to the fleet via comms;
     * have a big holo 3D "board" of the system, with the ships highlighted
within it.

Mediocre? Are we talking the same supplement? (BTW, US$51 is WAY too much for
anything short of a boxed game!)

Certainly it could have been made better, and a few things explained a bit
better, and the adventure typeset better (it has an info page smack bang in the
middle, without it being obvious you are reading something different).

However, it at least _tried_ to show how the 5FW played out in the OTU, and give
some sort of history about it. I know I would have liked more detail (MUCH
more!) but it wasn\'t bad. It also has the 4518th Lift Infantry for anyone who
missed the old JTAS issues, and details a battle rider squadron - the only time
I have ever seen a squadron silhouette match the ones on the 5FW counters.

I even used it as a reference when writing the "future history" of Tavonni,
since it showed what fleet would have rescued Tavonni from the Sword World
invasion in the 5FW.

Ah, well, Not one of the best perhaps, but _I_ still found it very useful.

Also, GC replied to Dan\'s query:

I\'ve always wanted stats for this ship, as it looks pretty cool. Howver, none
exist - they are not even included in the battle rider squadron info.

However, buried in the text, it says the ship on the cover is "one of the
squadron\'s gunboats".

Did I mention earlier that some things could have been done better?  ;-)

Hmm, maybe "mediocre" _is_ the right word, Doug...

  You _could_ make ship design genuinely interesting (and important!)
by using rules that involve maximum & sustained (total) thrust (just
don\'t get into changing fuel/mass ratios?) - basically a similar approach
to that taken by Mayday for small craft & missiles.

  A number of attempts to organize Triplanetary races have been made on
other lists, but unsuccessfully thus far. Sadly, the Triplanetary map
does not lend itself to the variable ship design very well, even though
the mechanics are essentially those of Mayday.

I guess this would be me.

It\'s long been my thought that a nice Traveller supplement would be some
kind of \'game\' based on this kind of idea (a bit like TCS or something).  A
kind of Whitbread (the round the world yachting race) in space.

I can envisage there being a solar system with interesting navigation
features that would host a renowned race every, say, ten years that potty
[1] racers come from all over to take part in.  Remember it would take
place over a long period (the yachts taking a while to accelerate!  [2]) -
just like the Whitbread takes the best part of a year to complete.  I\'ve
also envisaged it being a thing that nobles are really into due the
prestige and megacorps due to expense.

Basically, my idea was to have a variety of solar sailing yachts (or rules
for craft construction to meet the races\' specification or \'Rule\') that
would then be used for the race.  [3]  There would be rules for the race so
that the craft and the sailor\'s skills would influence the outcome and the
whole thing could be played in 2 or 3 hours - maybe on some form of sylized
solar system map board.

The snag is that real life has intervened and I\'ve not spent any time
developing this beyond the conceptual stage.  I\'ve also, as you might have
gathered, been concentrating on the Traveller Bibliography.  To tell the
truth, I don\'t think I\'m a gearhead enough to design the craft (that goes
doubly for designing craft design rules) and I\'m insufficiently
knowledgeable about astronomical science to come up with the racing
environment that would prove interesting to design a race around.

I\'d still love to see this happen though and would be delighted if anyone
with the time, inclination and abilities wanted to take these ideas and run
with them.  I reckon it could be a lovely addition to the Traveller milieux
(and would be suitable for any era - except, perhaps, TNE where I struggle
to envisage the time/money/leisure to take part in this [4]).
Any takers?  [5]

tc



[1]  They\'d need to be pretty potty - I assume that solar yachts will be
pretty small - say just two crew - and they\'d be cooped up together for
some time.  Alternatively, they could be bigger vessels with Whitbread 60
type crews (20ish???) who all have a variety of specific duties handling
\'lines\' and such.  I\'d guess quarters would still be *very* cramped to keep
the craft\'s mass down.

[2]  Though of course, nothing would prevent them all starting at speed
which is just how real yachts race.  Half the fun then is hitting the start
line as the signal for the race start goes off.  Not too early, not too
late.

[3] Alternatively, the race could be a \'one design\' type event where all
the craft are identical and it is up the crews to make the difference based
on conditions.

spring to mind off hand, but I\'m sure someone out there will come up with
something.

[5] If there are TMLers who\'d be interested and do the *real* work but
couldn\'t be bothered to \'organize\' this, I\'d be happy (I think) to set up a
mailing list where we could thrash out ideas and see if it\'s feasible to
put together such a book.  Or would you like to do this Mark?  Would Mitch
be interested as I know he\'s done some work in this direction?

I can\'t see how this can be correct.  There aren\'t very many fifth or sixth
generation \'Australians\', unless you\'re talking about indigenous people. 
Most present day Australians are people who migrated here this century, or
their descendants.

Ah, OK.  Maybe what I should have said was this : My family have been in this country (in dribs and drabs) for the last 150 years or so, possibly longer depending on who you believe.  I consider myself a native of this wide brown land, and an \'Australian\', which means whatever you take it to mean.  I wondered what \'nationality\' most citizens within the 3I would consider themselves to be.  Vilani ?  Solomani ?  Sylean ?  Or is the issue of \'race\' completely irrelevant as most people cionsider themselves \'Imperial\'.

A curiousity:  apparently about half of the \'Australian\' troops that fought
in the First World War had been born in Britain.  I\'m pretty sure that this
is a higher proportion of British-born people than existed in the general
Australian population at the time.  It may have some relationship with the
defeat of the two referenda about conscription, too.

Yes and no, in that order.  Proportions of UK-born men in the army at the time roughly mirrored society.  Many of them joined up in the hope that they would see home again, or to get away from the drudgery and hard toil that they found themselves facing on a daily basis in the bush.  You\'re far less likely to be bitten by a venemous reptile in Europe than you are in Australia.  That may also have been something of a drawcard.

An anecdote:  a distant relative of mine, Paddy Brosnan (gee, I wonder
where his family came from:  Bulgaria?) threw an egg at the Prime Minister
during the anti-conscription campaign.  The local (Queensland) cops refused
to arrest him, saying it was a federal matter, and not their problem.  The
result was the formation of the Australian Federal Police.  The PM (Billy
Hughes) tried to use this incident to discredit the anti-conscriptionists,
but still lost - twice.

That explains the \'Don\'t throw Eggs at the PM Act, 1915\' then ......

The AFP were formed in 1979.  As a direct result of the Hilton Bombing.

And the A-Team took place BEFORE center stop-lights were required
(1986), passive front-passenger protection (1989, consisted of either
motorized seat belts OR air bags), and then anti-lock brakes (1990s)
were introduced to American automobiles. And before I forget Canada\'s,

oncoming car from a MOOSE!

What\'s even better is there have been two movies in recent years that show
San Francisco\'s cable cars exploding.

Folks, those things don\'t even have engines, let alone flammable fuel
tanks.  They run on underground cables (hence the name).

If you see The rock, the conductor on the cable that goes fhwoomp is a real
Muni employee, and the winner of the cable car bell-ringing contest three
years running.

The Aledon Cup (the mag sail race around Regin\'s GG system) would definenly
involve things like gravity assists and aerobraking.  That would be the
attraction for the viewers, to see these daredevils collapse their sails to
dive into (can\'t remember the name of Regina\'s GG) upper atmosphere to make
a radical course change.

	My players have been involved in a couple of races, as

	wondering what rich nobles do with their spare time. The way
	I figured it: that 1G Yacht might manage 1.001G with a

	gravety well might be done more efficienctly by a skilled

	race, but the random time element should average out over
	enough jumps.

        Hi, Richard!
        It was Newfoundland joining Confederation, 1946.  NFLD was still a
British coolony up until then.  Essentially, they simply re-ran the
referendum on joining three times until they got a "yes" majority.  Which is
where the precedent for Quebec being able to revisit the succession question
came from.

Going further OT: in movies and on TV, people always seem to know whether
or not their car is going to blow up after a crash. If they walk away 
casually, it won\'t blow up. If they run away, it will...

Actually, the purpose is to show if the car is moving or not, which is

Unless it\'s Mel Gibson or Nicholas Cage walking in slow motion.  Then the

The Star Lost. It was originally written by either Ben Bova or Harlan
Ellison (I forget which.) It was so twisted by the producers from the
original written script that the author used the legal Nom de Plume that
writers from the screen writers guild have registered just to mark a turkey.
Add to that the fact that the finished scripts were done by non-guild
writers during a strike of the writers guild (over continuing royalties to
syndicated material). The original author was so ticked that he eventually
used it as the basis of a short novel "The Starcrossed", a satire of the TV
production industry.

Had First Contact with the Dandies happened by 21?  IIRC they are

On the other hand, does Sherlock 2 in OS9 offer any benefits? I have it but

Use a robot. I haven\'t gotten around to design it yet (to GT:Robot), but
here\'s a verbal description. The robot consists of a central body made up of
a contragrav unit and a power supply, and several contragrav pods joined to
the main body by control and power cables. A com telemetry unit lets the
operator control the robot from a recovery vehicle, an armored grav vehicle,
perhaps a modified APC.

To recover the downed tank the robot flies to the tank and attaches using a
grav plate. (This allows it to attach even to non-ferrous/non-magnetic tank
armor.) The contragrav pods deploy to envelop the tank in their contragrav
fields, attaching with grav plates to the tank at predetermined points based
upon the tank model. The contragrav field is activated, the tank rises, and
small reactionless thruster plates nudge the tank close enough to the
recovery vehicle so that it can be towed. A larger reactionless thruster pod
would allow the tank to be simply remoted to an evac location.

If the tank\'s contragrav is working, just send over a power supply robot to
hook into an external power and control point and drive the tank out.

The ring spun for .5 g and was divided into segments which mimicked

as vehicles are kept in the field far longer than is safe. Ironically, very 
heavy vehicles are more likely to be pushed too far than their more robust 
bretheren.

(I also assume that an average military mechanic has skill 12-14,
which isn\'t unreasonable -- unless your head mechanic is Scottish,
you can\'t afford to miss more than one or two trips to the garage).

Intrepid Tank             8         5 hours

See Vehicles, 2/e or Compendium II for maintenance rules.

(After looking over the stats for the meson sled and Intrepid grav
tank, it makes me wonder if "real" combat grav vehicles would be
more like the sled -- faster and stealthier*, rather than the
plodding dinosaur of the heavy grav tank).

* -- radical emission cloaking covers radical sound supression
(actually  ), so this extraneous feature should be deleted on the
meson sled.

Absolutely true. But I am thinking of Vilani megacorps rather than
modern American companies. They will certainly have a different take on
records storage.

as for the first e-mail...it probably didn\' last long after being

That\'s easy. I\'d hop the first megaliner to somewhere else!  The Marches are
Yonkers as portrayed in Hello Dolly or Montana in an old western. People go
there to work, to build a home, to hide from people they don\'t want to find
them "back east". Nobody goes there to vacation. If you\'re rich enough you
go to Capital or some other world in Core or one of the interior Sectors. If
you want a safari you go to a preserve world in an interior Sector, where
secret Ancient bases **aren\'t** hidden, and the planet\'s not a TAS Amber
Zone. No doubt there are places for the less well heeled to party in the SM.
But there you\'re talking bars, casino\'s, or colony barn raisings.

That\'s quite a handwave.  Given its stats I\'d have doubts about bonded SD being strong enough for a beanstalk on an earthlike world, and the material strength required for a ringworld is several orders of magnitude higher.  Of course, the radiation output of a white dwarf is such that any world at an inhabitable distance from the star would be cooked.

Assuming you have grav plates, why bother making it rotate for gravity?  If you want some security for power failures, make it rotate at orbital velocity.

Not really, if you have several waypoints, and directional changes at them.
(Look at CarWars: Drag Races are all amongst Accell 25, HC 4-5 Dragsters;
the difference is in handling the penalties. Especially when under fire;
Can-Am or F-1 becomes accumulated conering edges.) If the waypoints are
planets, you get a chance for skill to make vast differences in resultant
speed.

Even under mayday or bk2, use of planets could be quite important.

I don\'t recall anything but unclaimed systems seperating the K\'kree and
the Vargr, but I haven\'t checked a map.

If I\'m remembering correctly, that could be an important factor in any
campaign set a few hundred years after the stand 3I timelines.

There *is* one major "disadvantage" to using spetsdods. It\'s
essentially *impossible* to claim that you shot someone
unintentionally. On the other hand, as long as you are using "stun"
loads, nobody is going to get too upset. Spasm[1] loads are going to get
folks *really* upset. Though not as upset as lethal loads.

[1] for those of you who haven\'t read the series, they cause a
virtually instant "lock" of all voluntary muscles. It won\'t kill you,
but it hurts like hell and you need medical care until the effects wear
off (it\'s a sort of viral effect). It takes about 6 *months* to wear
off. 

This makes it an *ideal* military weapon, in that it ties up a maximal
amount of enemy resources in caring for the victim. Yet it\'s not even
lethal, so you can play things down if you accidentally shoot a few
"innocent bystanders".

There are *two* ways this won\'t work.

1. The ship uses a reaction drive. In this case, it\'s kinda hard to
   prove that protesters were there, since anything less than a crowd
   *hundreds* of yards across will be totally vaporized when the
   engines reach full thrust.

2. The ship has thruster plates and/or CG. In which case the ship\'s
   crew merely has to get the protesters off the hull (easily done in
   any of a number of ways. Then take off *slowly* for the first
   thousand feet or so.

Heck, in case 2, you can take off *with* protesters on the hull. Just
hover about 20 feet up, then send a work crew out in suits, and remove
the protesters, one at a time, tie them to a length of rope and lower
them until their friends can catch them. Then drop the rope before the
friends can try to climb up. If they are well secured to the hull, and
fighting, just go up to where the air is thin enough that they pass
out, then remove them, tie them up and drop back down to where you can
lower them by rope. 

Absolute worst case is if they\'ve got oxytanks. That still won\'t let
them last more than an hour or so at 10 km altitude.

And the best part of it is that you\'ve just *shown* them to be idiots
by being *able* to take off without hurting them.

And since this isn\'t a combat situation, a couple of the infantry (in
Battle Dress?) supporting the tanks cut the chain. 

I\'d cut the floor end first, near the protestor\'s feet. hold him up by
that bit of chain while my buddy cuts the chains on the tank. A couple
of quick welds and you\'ve got the guy chained up in his own chains!
Toss him in the paddy wagon and continue.

Personally, I am fond of "riot foam". You generate what amounts to a
8-10 foot deep layer of "soapsuds" (except less toxic!). You can\'t hear
a person standing next to you. You can\'t see your hand in front of your
face. but it doesn\'t interfere with breathing.

Instant isolation means that you no longer *have* a mob. You\'ve
got a few thousand individuals.

Enclose the crowd in the stuff, and as they wander out, or as you
carefully dissolve it around the edges, you grab *individuals*, and
haul them off. 

It\'s hard to call the stuff "cruel" since one of the biggest problems
at demos of the stuff was keeping the local kids from *playing* in it.
They thought it made for the *neatest* game of hide and seek...

Other possibilities that have existed since the late 60s are "liquid
banana peel", and a couple of gases that slowly and gradually render
you incapable of moving. Slowly enough that you\'ve got time to sit
down, and then lie down. If you don\'t you *fall* down. 

Frankly, if these were better known, I\'d expect dictatorships to
*prefer* them. Not only do they avoid those messes with bad publicity,
but they avoid property damage, and allow fewer people to deal with the
protest. And you are pretty much assured of being able to pick up *all*
the protestors.

Actually, I have yet to see an onscreen train wreck where brakes would
help. Trains mass a *lot*. Typical stopping distances for freight
trains at "cruising" speed are measured in *miles*. Passenger trains
can stop a bit faster. But not much. 

Basicly, unless a train is crawling along, if it can *see* the problem,
it\'s too late to stop.

Just keep two things in mind. The Earthship Ark main body is *wider*
than the Red Dwarf is *long*. Going with the Ellison figures of 30
mile diameter biospheres (the 3 mile figure is a bad joke), that makes
the main body around 25 miles on a side and hundreds of miles long. 

Next, remember the Kzinti lesson. This puppy has some sort of drive
that got it up to speeds where it was only going to take generations to
get to another star rather than millenia. And we know they had gravity
control, because of the artificial gravity in the domes, and the
"directed fall" in the transport tubes. 

I\'d guess that the Ark could ram RD with only minor damage. And that
it\'s possible that they might have drive fields or particle shielding
fields that\'d rip RD to shreds before it got close.

No. It was originally written by Ellison. Ellison and someone else
(Bryant?) novelized the original script along with notes about all the
screwups in production as "Phoenix Without Ashes". Some years later Ben
Bova wrote the "Starcrossed". Poor Ben had been in the unenviable
position of having been *Science Advisor* to the show. Ouch!

You\'ve got to remember that George O. Smith *was* an Electrical
Engineer and *worked* in communications. Far too much of his stuff was
likely based on *real* incidents!

I do love the bit in the story you mention when after the
confrontation, the cheif engineer has visited someone in the chemistry
dept and asked him to dig out everything he\'s got that can be used to
produce oxygen. Said minion inquires what\'s going on. The reply is that
there\'s a slight problem and the air plant isn\'t working, and the CE
leaves. The minion thinks about this for few seconds. More or less from
memory:

	Not working? How could the air plant not be working? Unless it
	was...  dead. He quit wondering and started working. Fast.

Nice, huh?

True. It\'s all to easy to have them told. "You must be thinking of some
*other* planet. We\'ve always had the toy company there..."

For the "ultimate" in paranoia, have them go to a system they\'ve been
to several (or better yet *many*) times before. And have the system be
different. Different star, different orbit and UPP for the mainworld.
To really rub it in, keep the name. And have all their library records
etc match the *new* system.

For extra points, make the "missing" system their home base. With the
"new" system having no records of them...

You just reminded me of one of the *creepiest* stories. It\'s one of A.
Bertram Chandler\'s "Commodore Grimes" stories. I *think* it\'s "Into the
Alternate Universe". Anyway, to put it in Traveller terms, a ship
misjumps into our universe from another very similar universe. The big
difference is that a few centuries back, a ship had a badly damaged
engine and drive. All sorts of stray radiation from the power plant and
god only knows *what* leaking in thru the damaged jump bubble. It
misjumped. Worse, it was one of the misjumps where the jump lasts a
*lot* longer than a week. 

Not only is life support getting bad (even with hydroponics and tuissue
culture tanks), but the rats they ship had picked up a few jumps back
and not gotten a chance to exterminate are *changing*....

In the "normal" universe, the rats make an attack shortly after the
ship emerges from jump and the ship burns up on re-entry on an
earthlike world.

In the alternate, the ship manages to set down ok. And the mutated,
*intelligent* rats win the fight and enslave the crew. They establish a
colony on the unihabited planet. Eventually they either repair the
ship, or another ship happens by. 

By the time of the story, the Rats control dozens of worlds in the out
of the way cluster. Enough that Humans are more interested in keeping
them from spreading than in trying to exterminate them or liberate
their human slaves. 

There\'s some trading, and a lot more raiding across the borders. And
since this is a frontier area, there are still worlds for both sides to
expand onto. 

So, our hero learns about this when he\'s attacked by a ship that turns
out to be a Rat ship that has misjumped. He wins. Barely. And then he\'s
got to deal with human sized, intelligent rats. Ones that not only keep
human slaves, but consider them as a backup food supply (one of the
uglier things they discover when they search the captured ship is that
the tissue culture tanks are growing *human* flesh...)

One possibility would be that it turns out conditions in a particular
system make jumps between the universes easy. 

Another stolen from the original is that they figure out how to jump
the ship back to it\'s universe of origin, and how to make a jump back
in time to prevent the infested ship from landing. 

Or maybe the Rat ship is from their universe\'s future, and they have to
try stopping the infested ship...

Just dealing with these "ratoids" ought to be unsettling enough. The
possibility of them being neighbors (ie the players are the first
contact between "rat" civilization and human), or as the future (the
rat ship is from the future and the players need to see if they can
prevent the rat civilization) ought to be good for lotsa of creepiness.

Stuff like rats eating people, and the way they discpline slaves by
biting chunks out of them ought to *really* get to the players.

Oh yeah, if you go with the "rats are a possible future" scenario,
consider that the PCs may have to shoot down that cripplerd ship. If
they get observed doing so, they\'ll have a lot of explaining to do. A
kind GM will let the evidence from the future stay. A nasty GM will
have all of it vanish.

Sources close to the BITS Director suggest that the Penguin throwing

We\'ve had the print run for \'SpaceDogs\' and \'The Khiidkar Incident\' 
arrive in finally. As a result the various distributors have been 
informed that they can place orders now (we held off accepting orders 
until we had the stock) - this includes SJG and the UK distributors. 
Assuming all goes well this means that both of the new adventures 
will be available for Christmas 99.

"SpaceDogs", written by David Thomas[1], sports a gorgeous Jesse 
DeGraff cover of a Marava class with some problems. The adventure is 
usable in any milieu and has T4 and GURPS Traveller stats. The BITS 
task system is included to allow easy use in *any* Traveller system. 
The adventure revolves around a group of down and out Vargr and their 
efforts to save a small colony world. GBP4.99  (same as 101 Books).

"The Khidkhar Incident", written by Martin Dougherty and Neil 
Frier[2], is an adventure dealing with the Imperial nobility and its 
opponents. Once again, this adventure includes the BITS task system, 
and requires the players to move in noble circles facing dangerous 
threats such as piracy and romance. GBP4.99.

Both adventures have fill pre-generated characters for GT and T4, 
plus starship designs and deckplans.

I\'m still on OS8.6 (and only that thanks to Bruce Johnson - Apple 
seem to believe that because loads of crazed Star Wars fans, me 
included, used the T1 links at work to download the Phantom Menace 
trailer @25Mb that home users paying per minute would love to d/l the 
35Mb upgrade from 8.5 to 8.6). However,  I believe you can index 
individual folders but I\'m not sure if you can index locked drives.

Hmm. Maybe I\'ll just copy the files to the drive and make a Mac 
Folders and Files disk with Toast.

For a *slightly* less extreme problem, read Heinlein\'s "Puppet
Massters". Then transpose it to an out of the way world. Not only do
you have to stop this, you have to try to keep them from infecting any
one going offworld. 

In this case, the threat isn\'t enough to get the world nuked from
orbit. But it *is* enough to get a *strict* quarantine established.

Another *extremely* nasty is to hit the players with something familar,
but where the "natural" response is *wrong*. Say a conspiracy where
they finally uncover enough proof to show that *something* was going on
in secret. They release it to the media, the conspirators disappear.
But one of them corners a PC alone, and *proves* to him/her that the
conspiracy was going to do something good and *wonderful*. And that
since it\'s been exposed, it\'ll be a long time before the conspirators
can again get the conditions right for XXX.

Maybe XXX is a *cheap* cure for diseases that can\'t just be placed on
the market because it\'d hurt the profits of too many megacorps. Maybe
it\'s something good for the citizen, but that the Imperium doesn\'t
like. 

In any case, the punchline is that the characters, by being their
normal, suspicious selves have just made the biggest screwup of their
lives. One they can\'t *begin* to fix. And they\'ll have to live with
being praised for what\'s really a disaster. 

Note. This is best saved for *players* who play their characters *way*
too paranoid and suspicious. Think of it as a "last resort" to get them
to realize that they need to allow for *good* hidden motives sometime.

Psionics. The enemy can read your mind. He *knows* what you are going
to do. 

Or just read John W. Campbell\'s "Who Goes There?" It\'s the basis for
both versions of "The Thing", and while Carpenter stuck closer to the
story, it\'s possible for you as a ref to do even better.

Depends on what you mean by "do".  Helping the poor and what-not is now a
secular responsibility.

I know that up here in Hogtown the group that looks after more homeless
than any other is an agency of the Anglican Church, yet even most
churchmembers don\'t know that and credit either the Salvation Army or the
government Social Services. So publicity is also a factor.

As to the serious religious stuff, finding a congregation that is serious
about religion, as opposed to being serious about having a nice church with
new hymn-books, is tough. For one thing to seriously grow in religious
faith people have to be free to question it, which doesn\'t happen inside
most churches, and also have to be willing to put serious skull sweat into
learning what their religion actually means, which requires commitment.
(In Credo terms, most Angicans can\'t tell an "Article of Faith" from a
"Customary Practice", and I suspect the same is true of most religions.)

I\'m seriously considering going to seminary part-time, not to become a
priest but just to find an environment where people don\'t get offended when
you ask questions. (Like "When Jesus cast the demon into the pigs, why was
it OK for him to thus destroy some farmer\'s herd of pigs? What had the
farmer done to deserve that?")

ObTrav: Read 101 Religions.

Ban computers.

You and your team have to figure your course based on the known position of
the waypoints at the start, and manually input any course corrections.
That makes it *very* interesting.

Of course, if you want to get _deeply_ unpleasant, try combining the
"flying fried eggs" from ST:TOS\'s "Operation: Annihilate" with
Heinlein\'s _The Puppet Masters_.  Imagine a parasite that combines the
slugs\' total control of its victims with the Denevan parasites\' lack of
visually obvious signs of infection.  Don\'t forget to make sure that the
parasites are immune to the agents used against them in the
above-mentioned stories.  A kind-hearted referee will provide a way
(that the PCs might be able to find) to kill the parasites, without
killing the host.  OTOH, killing the host is the only way to be
_sure_....

If _that_ doesn\'t get your players paranoid, they\'ll _never_ see the
fnords, and you may as well give up on the project....

I just remembered a technique that I sort of stumbled onto. If your
players are into reading SF or even just watching SF movies/tv,
recommend things to them. Or even loan them some tapes or books. 

Then later, have something come up that is similar to or even outright
stolen from one of the works you recommened or loaned to them. 

I once scared the pants off a player in a D&D game. I knew he\'d just
finished Brunner\'s "Traveller in Black" collection not that long ago.
The main character in those stories is a sort of Power or Demigod or
*something* (never made entirely clear). But he wanders around the
world and when people make certain sorts of wishes/statements he grants
them. For example a prominent citizen\'s niece is being executed for
having falsely charged him with attempted rape, and he comments "I wish
you knew how much this pains me". And by nightfall everyone in town
knows that he really *did* try to rape her, and bribed witnesses and
bought the judge so she\'d be executed and cease being a problem. 

The Traveller in Black always grants the wishes with the phrase "As you
wish, so be it." 

So, while someone was messing with something that they thought might be
a magic item. and made a "wish" type comment, I "intoned" the PHRASE.
"As you wish, so be it.". And the player who\'d read the book recently
(and several others that I hadn\'t known had read it) just about had
heart failure. :-)

There\'s some stuff about Magsails on the web as well.  It would be much more interesting than solar sail racing because the solar wind is significantly less consistent than sunlight.  Note that realistically, its unclear if there would be much of an edge in acceleration between solar sails and magsails, though you could make life really interesting by racing in some system with a really powerful solar wind.

Alas, you are projecting a rather recent cultural phenomenon into a
situation where it just plain *doesn\'t work*. 

Tourism, of the sort you are thinking of is a creation of the railroad,
the steamship, and most especially the *airplane*. 

You didn\'t get huge numbers of "average joe" tourists until
transportation was cheap AND IT WAS POSSIBLE TO MAKE THE TRIP IN NO
MORE THAN TWO WEEKS!

That last is the killer in Traveller. That means that you *can\'t* go
even *one* jump away for your vacation, because even with 2 weeks
vacation, it\'d use up your entire vacation just getting there and back!

The only offworld tourists will be rich, retired, or at the very least,
folks with enough seniority to get 4 week vacations. And even the
latter aren\'t going to go more than a jump away. 

For the vast majority, an offworld trip is a "once in a lifetime" deal.
That puts the attractions in a whole different class. The stuff that
currently attracts tourists isn\'t going to do it. 

Glorified amusement parks, like Disney World, are going to be *local*.
Besides, given the *vast* cultural differences between worlds,
attracting folks from offworld isn\'t all that likely anyway.

How do you manuever any distance in space safely without using a computer?

Could you allow contestants a fixed hardware/software configuration instead?

It\'s no contest. One side doesn\'t even know where their back-up computer
is, and their primary has failed. The other side can (sort of) control
their ship, if Holly lets them. Even if the Red Dwarf doesn\'t have
offensive weapons it still has Starbugs. The probable scenario would
be that the Dwarfers take Starbug over to explore the disabled ship,
interact humorously with a couple of the crew, then by the end of the
episode accidently cause the complete destruction of Earthship Ark in
a deus ex machina and just escape in the \'bug by the end credits.

Look at it another way. The writers of "Red Dwarf" would write it so
that Earthship Ark loses because they don\'t want to kill their cash cow.
The writers of "The Star Lost" would have Earthship Ark lose because
they hate what the producers did to their story and would gladly kill
it off.

That\'s one *hell* of a holiday. Work out the trip length and then
consider what an "average" person would have to do to be able to be off
work that long. 

This is an apparently often overlooked point. In Traveller the average
person *never* leaves their home system, and may never leave their home
planet. The exceptions being *mostly* folks who enlist in the Imperial
forces or who have a job that sends them offworld. 

Folks who can take long (multi-jump) cruises are *rich*. They have to
be simply because they can afford to be away from their job for the
*months* that are required.

Alas, "Greatest American Hero" made an *unforgivable* mistake in the
first episode of the second season. One that caused me and just about
everyone I know to quit watching it. 

In the very first episode of the first season, our hero got the suit
and the instructions from the aliens. But he lost the book. Personally,
I\'d have spent a day or two *looking for the book, but ok, he lost it.

Then at the start of the second season, the aliens give him another
copy of the instructions WHICH HE PROMPTLY LOSES! That was it. He was
too incompetent to live.

Hmm... I remember my dad having email as early as 1979, probably earlier.
Then again, he was getting it through the mainframe at work, even though it
did pass mail to/from DOD HQ. I know that by 1981, there were extensive
mail-nets running; by 84 (when I got into modeming) FidoNet, WWIV-Net,
UUCP-net, and DARPA-Net were all going strong... I know that at least one
local board (BBS) had a DARPA-Net -> WWIV-Net interchange going. One way,
as I recall.

Then, about 2 years ago, I worked for the local office of the National
Archives. The RRS (Records Retention Schedule) for E-mail specified the
storage means allowed: printed out onto paper and filed like snail-mail.
All incoming and outgoing e-mails to/from government offices in the
executive branch (other than personal e-mails, which ARE allowed) were
required to be treated in this manner.
Databases, documents, and such are required to be in print-form as well...
space, tab, or comma delimited text files, on mag-tape, are allowed as
interim storage...

Ob Trav:
IMTU, hardcopies are still the "Default" long term storage method. Usually
nanofiche (2-3 mm per page, laser etched, on non-flexible bi-layer
(Dark/light) media, approx 0.1mm thick. Typically 10x20mm sheets...). IMTU,
typical uses include 5 or even 6 layer media (You can get color that way,
assuming reflective rather than transparency based reading methods). Naval
orders are typically sent on Fiche, via courier, on the "Correct" media for
the issue date, with several verification methods built onto the fiche
(Like built-in nanowire layers for verifying sender secured codes, specific
spectrum requirements for each layer, etc, ad nauseum) with digital copies
also sent. Generally, these will be encoded using twin-key or triple-key
encryption schemes.

The problem with digital media, lack of lifespan not withstanding, is that
any re-writeable media is editable, and any non-rewriteable media is
generally single session, or non-terminated partition-mapped, but still
limited in number of writes. Additionally, electronic media require
compatable data encryption/decryption (Hell, ASCII is techinically a
"Published Key" encryption...) to return to readable formats. Far better to
have a physical method that is in clear-text (IE, not encrypted from the
original linguistic content), even if it requires extensive magnification.
Actually, Microfiche is an exceptionally easy to use archival storage
method. And, if etched rather than photo-imaged, can be both very compact
and extremely stable. I envision some megacorps (Sharushiid, Makidhadrun,
Nasiraaka, LSP, Schunamann & Sons) having fiche archives going back
multiple centuries... probably only barely indexed, and kept for various
reasons.

Envision the fun of a Genealogical search on a non-indexed stack of fiches
for some nobleman trying to prove his heritage in order to claim some heir
status to the fortunes of some deceased (and non-noble) relative... Pouring
through THOUSANDS of fiches, tracking relatives by Dependant Decalrations
of the governing vilani megacorps...

Therefore \'Spasm\' is a cute drug, but makes very little pharmacological
or physiological sense. Consider me one of the upset.

i. Drugs have to get to their site of action. Usually this is via the
circulation, unless the agent is delivered directly.
	Combine this with uptake time and you have a delay of at least 30
seconds (arm-brain circulation time, with optimised IV medications).
	Heck, cyanide will take at least five minutes to kill you (though
you\'re unconscious and fitting within 60 seconds, usually).

ii. There is no functional difference down to a receptor level between
various beds of skeletal (striated) muscle. If the limb muscles are
paralysed, then the chest wall and diaphragm will go too.
	If these muscles are \'locked\', it will become impossible to
artificially ventilate the victim with any degree of safety.
	(I\'ve been at resucitations like this, folks. They are *scary*).
	If you can\'t breathe or have someone breathe for you, you will almost
certainly die. Access to cardiopulmonary bypass (or, in Trav, low
berths) isn\'t guaranteed. Irreparable damage may occur before the
subject is ready to go on the pump/in the cooler (though this is less
likely with higher TLs).

iii. Pain and persistent paralysis imply some degeneration of nerve
function.
	RW data point : Guillain-Barre syndrome is characterised by an
autoimmune response to your own myelin (in response to bacterial or
viral infections, usually). Recovery within 6 months is typical ; but
only about a third of victims require mechanical ventilation.
	You will improve up to the six month mark (on average) ; whatever
deficit you\'re left with at the end of that time is permanent.

The polio epidemic of the 1950\'s springs to mind. There were *wards*
full of people on \'iron lungs\' and pedal powered ventilators all over
the developed world.

Nightmarish stuff. It would only take one riot to overload the critical
care facilities of a good sized (pop 3 million+) city at current tech
levels.
	In a combat situation, a lot of people would die, either from inability
to get to them in time, or on the basis of triage (save the \'Spasm\'
victims or the multi trauma casualties - I assume bombs and
bullets/beams would still be used?).

I don\'t think \'Spasm\' makes a good riot control agent, for the reasons I
have touched on above, unless you are uninterested in the survival of
the rioters (and part of the plausibility of your narrative). 
Perhaps the mere threat of its use would prevent riots.

Alternatives?
The primary goal is to prevent the rioters from damaging property or
friendly forces. Collateral damage should be minimised.

i. Disorienting agents
- - smoke, hallucinogens, light, sonics, other sensory distractors.

ii. Incapacitating agents
- - an aerosol sedative ;
- - an agent to interrupt the motor pathways in such a fashion as to cause
transient Parkinsonian motor signs (you can\'t riot much faster than a
slow shuffle and you can\'t change direction or stop without assistance)
i.e. a *very selective* dopamine receptor blocker ;
- - \'soma\', from Huxley\'s \'Brave New World\' ;
- - descendants of modern agents (e.g. CS) with shorter onset and offset
times and fewer spillover side effects.
- - immobilising foam and slipping agents (which have already been
mentioned).

iii. Design issues
Modern urban planning (e.g. space syntax) methods could be used to
design areas where unrest is less likely to develop, or where it is more
difficult to riot. 
	Optimising access by law enforcement and emergency services to likely
trouble spots, as well as personnel proficiency in implementing
\'disaster\' plans.
	Evil regimes could consider conditioning of the populace...
	<other more obvious ways to prevent rioting snipped>

Interesting idea, but how would you replace one system with another? 
In my Supers game, the toy company building was a bit larger than the 
old Omnitech HQ building, so that the old building would fit inside
the new one. The toy company building was, in fact, a shell that was
placed overtop the old building. 

Actually, I\'ve thought of one way to pull it off, but it\'s a bit of
a stretch: change the star maps in the computer system of the PCs. If
they rely exclusively on the maps to find their way around, switching
the old system and new on the map just might throw them for a curve...

I\'m not sure that I can agree with you here. While it is a rather recent
phenomenon, I think that there may be other factors involved as well. I
agree with you in spirit, though. It\'s not likely that there\'ll be a
Makhidkarunworld on Regina that will be a draw for folks from Glisten, for
example. That\'s not to say that there aren\'t other alternatives.

That\'s assuming that a two week vacation is some sort of universal that will
be part of the status quo in the Traveller universe, despite the fact that
vacations for the working class - of *any* sort - are also relatively young.
Hell... come to think of it, the working class is pretty young as well.

Before vacations were a given for Joe Average, it was much more common for
promoters to bring the attractions to his hometown. Incidentally, the
travelling carnival concept is *perfect* for Traveller. Canonically, jumps
are relatively expensive for individuals, but *ships* are cheap enough that
promoters could create travelling carnivals and road shows of all sorts.

Stylistically, the idea also fits perfectly with the adventuring dynamic of
Traveller.

Again, this requires that a two week vacation is some sort of universal. I
don\'t know that there\'s any really strong evidence for it.

Not necessarily the case, at least in my humble opinion. Places like Disney
World and Disneyland are frequently sub-standard with regards to variety and
quality of rides. In the U.S., places like the Six Flags amusement parks
literally smack the crap out of the Disney parks with respect to rides.

It\'s not the *rides* that are the draw, they just happen to be (as GURPS
fans might say) a "special effect". What\'s the real draw is the marketing
machinery that portrays the Disney parks as a once in a lifetime experience
that can be enjoyed by anybody.

>Besides, given the *vast* cultural differences between worlds,
>attracting folks from offworld isn\'t all that likely anyway.


I disagree, anything is possible with the right spin. Places like the Disney
parks are the draw that they are because of their universal lowest common
denominator appeal. Due to this appeal, the travel industry can lower prices
and / or package trips to the Disney parks... the lesser expense and / or
greater convenience strengthens the appeal, and so on. With the vast power
of the megacorporations in the Traveller universe, I would find it difficult
to believe that such facilities wouldn\'t exist, dotted across the subsectors
and sectors. They *would* draw off world tourism, and probably alot of it,
but it would still be "local" in a sense.

I do think that it\'s quite possible to flatten the cultural distinctions
concerning entertainment. The lowest common denominator appeal of the
American entertainment industry is proof of that.

Another interesting idea would be "Subsector (or Sector, or Domain) Fairs",
or Olympic style sporting events that are "fixed" in a specific location,
but only for a short time. The Subsector Fair is particularly applicable,
stylistically. The real World\'s Fair concept will be forever linked with
"the World of Tomorrow" style Golden Age sci-fi. Both ideas make excellent
adventure hooks... wow... my mind is swimming with the possibilities.

Both the Fair and the Olympic models are methods by which the travel time
problem that Leonard mentioned were overcome in the real world. They serve
to foster a sense of unity, they are an excellent advertising opportunity,
and they\'re just damn interesting.

I don\'t know, but I do know that in a gritty X-Files-like scenario the
Scully analog wouldn\'t believe that the system had been replaced.

Mulder: "Don\'t you see Scully? They\'ve switched this system with another!"

Scully: "Mulder, there\'s no evidence at all to support what you\'re saying.
I\'m a woman of science, and science says such things aren\'t possible."

That\'s evil.... :-D

Sometimes, all one needs to induce paranoia in the players is a previous
rep for that sort of thing. The last game I ran before my current GURPS
Traveller was the paranoid Supers campaign I had run last year, with 
the same group of players.

This past weekend, I had the group NPC break her ankle to get her
separated from the others, for no particular reason. The group leader told
her to call him when she was released from the hospital. A broken ankle
on a high-population, hi-tech world shouldn\'t take long at all. But with
all the other activities going on, I had forgotten completely about her,
until several hours had passed in game time. So when I had her call the
others, to explain what took so long I came up with an excuse that the
hospital had been overwhelmed with patients after a mag-lev train accident.

Earlier in the scenario, the PCs had taken a mag-lev across the city, and
had also encountered a couple of members of a (rival) intelligence unit. So
when they heard about the train wreck, their response was to connect to 
the local newsnet to get as much info about the accident, then try to
correlate the time and place of the wreck with their own movements to see
if there was a connection. All this from an off-the-cuff comment I made
on the spur of the moment to cover my own mistake.

A way to use this in a game: have things happen in the background of 
wherever the players are, to make them suspect that maybe someone *is*
out to get them. They take train from point A to point B on planet X;
later that day, there\'s a big train wreck on planet X. The PCs visit a
space station; after they leave, the station\'s reactor core goes critical
and blows up, taking half the station with it.... Keep doing this, and
it will have an effect on the players...

I know, I know, that was a bad idea. It would have been a better idea to allow
him to have the book for one or two episodes, find out one or two nifty new
powers, save the world, and *then* lose the book.

Losing the book allows the character to be more interesting - with the old 70\'s
all-powerful Superman, his hardest choice was "who to hit first?" More
underpowered characters actually have to *think*.

The point was made later as an understatement, when the hero meets the
*original* human who was given the suit. It is the old "absolute power corrupts
absolutely". If he had full access to the suits powers and abilities, he could
well have lost sight of what they should be used for (character explanation) -
and could have overcome problems too easily to make for an interesting storyline
(story/game balance explanation).

ObTrav: dunno, maybe the nobility losing sight of the concept of "noblesse
oblige"? Or "ordinary" characters having to work out how to defeat a foe (or
solve a problem) that seems far beyond their meagre resources?  ;-)

It was for Newfoundland to enter into Canada, which was a Yes (something
like 51% yes, 49% no)

It has been suggested by the the lossing group that the vote was rigged and
that Canada pulled a fast one on Newfoundland (this I was told by me
brother-in-law, who happens to be a Newfie.

To borrow from the Dicsworld book

The Imperium is a Democracy with;
one man, one vote.
The Emperor is the man,
and he has the vote.

 Some reference buried deep in my memory says they were Contacted

the Zhodani or Vargr is possible well before the Imperials got there,
as is one-shot contact with lost Vilani following the Rule of Man...

I can actually understand the draw of those races. I and some friends
were planning to *voluntarily* undego a 2 week wilderness survival
course for "fun". 

BTW, it occurs to me that writing up a few "survival race" courses from
the 3I might make a good "non-combat" scenario to get players used to
working as a team. There are some interesting possibilities if you pick
the right sort of planet.

Just a note, unless it has *active* "steering jets" of some sort, a
ringworld is *very* unstable. You see, if it gets the least bit off
center, the way the gravitational forces add up it gets pulled farther
off center.

For that matter, you can have things like the "Armstrong Classic" from
Philip St. John\'s "Rocket Jockey"[1]. The race was in the Sol system
(pre-FTL). The initial leg (a "qualifying run") was from Terra to Luna.
The ships that qualified had to land on Mercury, Venus(?) Mars,
Ganymede, Io, Callisto, Europa and Titan(?) and then return to Earth
(or was it Luna). One of the tricks was that they could land on the
other worlds in *any* order. They also had limited fuel supplies. They
were allowed to have fuel dumps of up to some amount at the port on
each world. Winner was the lowest total time.

One of the nice touches of this setup is that since the relative
positions of the planets change from year to year, the race is never
the same. Also, if your ship has a bit more thrust or can get more
delta-V out of a full load of fuel, you can hit planets in an order
that takes less time than it would for the other ships. Heck, in the
case of the Jovian moons, a difference of *hours* will greatly affect
the positions!

This can be run in the Sol system, as in the story, with or without
stops at major asteroids and outer planets. Or you can run it in
another system. 

I recommend keeping it to the inner system simply because it gets
impossible to keep track of things on a scale map without custom
computer software otherwise. 

[1]Philip St. John is one of Lester del Rey\'s pen names. This
particular book is somewhat famous because even though it was written
in the 50s, del Rey got a bit of future history right. The race  is the
Armstrong Classic. It\'s named after the first man to land on the moon! 
Talk about weird co-incidences!

Nope. They are called "<something> Orbitals". I just can\'t recall the
name that should be in place of <something>. One of the many, *many*
"Larger than Worlds" constructs that both SF writers and far out
physics types have speculated about. 

A rather interesting variation is to have a large hollow tube. Rotate
it to provide 1g on the inner surface. Place a light source running
down the center. Make it long enough and you can bend it into a closed
loop without measurable torsion effects. You could loop it around a
star many, many times instead of having a single loop. Of course, it
won\'t be any more stable than a ringworld if you do that. On the other
hand, maybe you can flex it in such a way as to maintain stability? Not
something that anyone has studied as far as I know.

If a civilization does this and runs it around the star a few thousand
(or million) times, it starts to look like the star is sitting in a
tangle of hair. If you\'ve got the materials, you can build the tube on
out to another star, and bury it in more loops. The power from the
loops near the stars can power the sections far away from them. At 30km
a day, you can walk a parsec in about a trillion years.

I was only using my present day vacation to lead in to the topic and
did not mean to imply that there were any parallels between that and
tourism in Traveller. I too think that tourism works very differently
in the Imperium. But just because it doesn\'t work the same way doesn\'t
mean that it can\'t work at all.

>You didn\'t get huge numbers of "average joe" tourists until

I agree with you that 2 week vacations won\'t work that way in Traveller.
That doesn\'t mean that tourism *doesn\'t work*. Just that the same kind of
vacation we\'re familiar with here will not lead to space tourism in the
Traveller Universe.

However, tourism DOES happen. It\'s what luxury liners are built for.
It\'s what safari ships are built for. It\'s what at least one of the
megacorporations specialise in. It\'s in canon. There are published
scenarios that have tourists and entertainers aboard cruise ships.
The luxury liners aren\'t just there for business travellers or those
who are migrating. They take tourists around the Imperium.

Heck, when you think about it, aren\'t all Travellers tourists?

>That last is the killer in Traveller. That means that you *can\'t* go
>even *one* jump away for your vacation, because even with 2 weeks
>vacation, it\'d use up your entire vacation just getting there and back!

Only if your vacation is for 2 weeks. In my country 4 week vacations are
the norm (we have it good). That would give sophonts time for 2 weeks stay
at their destination as well as 2 weeks in jump. It makes it possible.
But only if there is something worth the time and expense one jump away.

Space travel, while affordable to the masses, is still expensive. To my
mind most sophonts would not holiday outsystem unless there was
a real \'draw\' to attract them. It certainly would not be a yearly event.
Most "average joe" would find something closer to home to look at instead.

>The only offworld tourists will be rich, retired, or at the very least,
>folks with enough seniority to get 4 week vacations. And even the
>latter aren\'t going to go more than a jump away.

That\'s the kind of folks I see as \'tourists of the Imperium\' too. Don\'t
forget the nobles. And with the volume of sophonts in the Imperium even
a minute percentage of tourists is a huge amount. Even if they only
travelled once in their lives.

>For the vast majority, an offworld trip is a "once in a lifetime" deal.
>That puts the attractions in a whole different class. The stuff that
>currently attracts tourists isn\'t going to do it.

Bingo! My point exactly. So, since we know it does happen, what are
they going to look at in all those luxury liners, yachts & safari ships?
What do people go to see that they can\'t get locally?

A thought. Perhaps it\'s not so much the destination - but the trip.
The sightseeing might not be as important as the experience of getting
there. You can\'t experience jumpspace except in jump. You can\'t just
look up at the stars, you can BE there. That feeling might be what
draws people to travel.

Any more ideas?

That last is the killer in Traveller. That means that you *can\'t* go
even *one* jump away for your vacation, because even with 2 weeks
vacation, it\'d use up your entire vacation just getting there and back!

The only offworld tourists will be rich, retired, or at the very least,
folks with enough seniority to get 4 week vacations. And even the
latter aren\'t going to go more than a jump away. 
</Leonard>

<Me>
Assuming of course that people get only two weeks.  The norm in this country (and NZ too ?) is four weeks annual leave.  As a result, a couple of years ago, we had the lowest absenteeism in the industrialised world.  Then they cut the public holidays down and absenteeism went up.

<Leonard>
Glorified amusement parks, like Disney World, are going to be *local*.
Besides, given the *vast* cultural differences between worlds,
attracting folks from offworld isn\'t all that likely anyway.

And later .....

This is an apparently often overlooked point. In Traveller the average
person *never* leaves their home system, and may never leave their home
planet. The exceptions being *mostly* folks who enlist in the Imperial
forces or who have a job that sends them offworld. 
</Leonard>

Would that then not be a *good* reason for people to be leaving a world ?  There are hundreds (if not thousands) of worlds in the TU with <500K population.  The people on these worlds won\'t have a lot to do in their spare time.  Ergo, they work longer hours \'cos there\'s not a lot to do in their spare time.  Ergo, you give them longer leave as compensation.

You\'ve also got added pressure from bored juveniles and restless people (ie : Travellers) wanting to do *something* other than watch groats graze.  What is there for a teenager to do on a world with GTL 12 and population of 5000 souls ?  Not a great deal.  What do they do in response ?  Hop on a passing starship and see a bit of the galaxy.

The average Joe (sorry, Eneri) may well see another culture/world and his/her/its\'/their own as being quite exotic.  They would particularly notice the differences.  This would then be an added attraction in visiting offworld.

I suspect travel offworld would be not be limited to the rich and the Forces.  People may only do it every few years or once in their lifetime, but it\'s probably only uncommon at worst.

What is there to do another world ?  BUCKETLOADS !!!!  Travel to a different part of your own country and have a look around; you\'ll quickly find things of interest.  Tourism isn\'t just flashing lights and dancing, it\'s about seeing and experiencing stuff that you can\'t do at home.  Just being \'somewhere else\' is often a thrill in and of itself.  There\'d be HEAPS to do in the Marches.  I can think of at least two subsectors that\'d make great pubcrawls ........

  If the open airlock shows a 2m high hatch then the ship must be about
50m across at the mid-point, and 100-130+ long; depending on the overall

How about this: Most world which permit easy "temporary egress" to their
locals will probably have a significant minority who have left world for
vacation, at least once.

Looking at the tables in (Ooo, ich, I\'m quoting from GT) GT-Far Trader,
most TL 7+ will be able to save up for an off-world vacation, should they
so choose. For most of the middle class, it would be like Disney; once or
twice in a lifetime. Assuming 3 weeks vacation per year (IME, typical for
persons at a single employer for more than 5 years, but see below), that
would allow  J-1 once per year for the upper middle classes (1.5-2 x base
per captia GWP) each way, and minimal spending; save up for a few years,
and use two years accumulated leave, and you can get one week, and two
jumps, assuming 3 day layovers. If they are careful, you can get by with
under KCr6 for a week on a world J1 away.

Hmm another look (this time in GT itself) finds Soc-0, middle class, to
have maintenance of Cr500/month. Incomes range from PRxCr75 to PRxCr100 per
month for average jobs. Most require PR\'s of 10+, most typically would be
12\'s...at PR\'s of 10, at the Cr75 per point of PR, that\'s Cr250 per month
above cost of living. With J1 mid passage being Cr8000, that\'s 32 months
savings; or just about 2.5 years.

Combining these two approaches (GT incomes and outgoes, GT-FT prices),
travel aboard a liner will run you Cr1800 per parsec, assuming you pay 10
weeks early, or Cr3600+hotel to the neighboring (J1) world, so for a week\'s
hotel, let\'s chalk up another KCr1. That\'s Cr4600, at say Cr125 per month
(That\'s 50% savings rate, about maximum for surplus income IME), or 37
months (just under 3 years). About as long as people save up to go to Los
Disneys....

Under other rulesets, the math is a little more grim. IF WE ASSUME KCr10K
per annum as the base salry per person, then we wind up with Joe Average
being able to afford Low Passage occasionally, perhaps every two years, and
the very wealthy can afford Mid passage often, or High passage
occasionally. Most middle class will probably save up for a
once-in-a-lifetime mid passage trip off world. Perhaps the middle class
might send a son or daughter off world via low passage for college. If we
assume that MT\'s payment rates are LOWER than typical world payments for
skilled labor, but we use them as the baseline for skilled labor, we get
some KCr13 per year, and also assuming skilled labor tends to be Soc4,
that\'s KCR13 as well. So, later in career (Skill level 2) there is a 10%
bonus; that gives us KCR 14.3 income, or a mid passage in some 7 years or
so. Typically, junior executives and other middle class types tend to make
nearly double the skilled labor rates currently, and that\'s not likely to
change; so we\'ll assume soc 7, KCr 26 income annually, and an outgo of
KCr22.75, or about KCr3 per year. This gives us enough surplus to afford
low passage almost annually, or that once in a life-time trip every 6
years, assuming no other vices. Still, at KCr3, if you\'ve got the three
weeks, good life insurance, and a desire to travel, you get a week one jump
away (Prollly 1-2 parsecs...)

CT\'s math is not able to be worked out easily; that\'s a flame war I wish to
avoid. TNE\'s is almost as bad, due to lack of materials, but looks to be
about KCr25 per annum for soc 7 (IIRC... the data is derived from world
tamer\'s), for income; we\'ll assume Cr200 per Soc for monthly expenses of
about KCr19. Travel becomes affordable. Occasionally. Most will be able to
travel low or steerage once a year. There were people who traveled steerage
as tourists during the steamer days; there would be in the space era as
well.

[1] As for leave times: Typically, I\'m seeing entry level stuff in alaska
with 1 week leave after 1st year, 2 weeks each after 2nd through 5th, and 3
weeks per each additional. With an accrual limit of the not more than two
or three years\' worth. As a federal employee, I accrued 1/2 day per 2
weeks, or 13 work days per year, as a new hire; some long term feds accrue
a day per 2 weeks, or 26 days per year; certain persons are accruing 1.5
days per 2 weeks, or 45 days per year. The fed stats are just annual leave,
and do not include comp time (which most feds will accrue some of), sick
leave, or military leave. This is when working either 4x10hr per week or
5x8hr per week. Guys working the slop get (typically) time off equal to the
time on, or 2 weeks on, 2 weeks off. Fishpackers get 2 weeks off per 2
months worked, although it tends to be seasonal work for about 75% of them.
Most commercial seamen (fishing crews and factory vessel crews) up here are
forced by the companies to take the 2 weeks per 3 months, as a matter of
company policy.

Just for reference, Even McDonalds grants 3 weeks a year to long term
employees... and generally, makes them take it within three months of
earning it; a few employees cash it in, and a few get permission to bank
their time off for the following year. I know a guy who banked his second
year, and McD\'s made him take BOTH 2 weeks one after the other (total 4
weeks) when he earned the 3rd years leave.

The only problem with using this stuff is that sooner or later the demos
will not be peaceful anymore. After a couple of uses of these methods
people wont go out into the street to demonstrate, they\'ll start 
sabotaging instead (working slower, driving slower in streets, anything that
will affect the ecomony) or they\'ll turn violent and gerilja-like.

Wouldn\'t it be best to just let a peaceful demonstartion run its course,
document who was there and show up on their door later on? For mobs the above
methods would be good, but with mobs you can be more cruel as the media
side is much more easy to manufacture against the mobs. The problem with  
peaceful demonstration is that if you do anything against it you loose the
media side of the case.

Is this an American problem?

I know several people who have either carried forward leave for
a year to allow a six week Australian or African holiday.
And several people who get six or more weeks holiday per year.

Then there are contractors (usually unmarried) who are secure enough
financially to take a couple of months break between contracts.

And not to forget the mainstay of the round the world cruise industry -
the retired middle classes (who are rich by many definitions but not
actually the Soc A+ that people tend to think of in Traveller).

Also you get the people who are between education and work who just
want to "see the galaxy before accepting the chains of conformity."

Looking towards the future, there is the concept of parental leave
being muted in this country, which might eventually allow parents
and children enough time to vist nearby worlds.

Even with all I said above, I\'d agree that travelling much more than
a jump or two for a holiday is going to be pretty rare - I may know
people who have had six week trips to Australia, but I know a lot more
who haven\'t

For most people, it\'s still likely to be a "once in a lifetime" thing,
from cost alone. So I agree here.

Oops!  I might have been thinking about some intelligence outfit or other,

Empire, and God and the Protestant Churches too...

To leave, the country that wants to leave has to decide (by whatever means
that country uses). I\'m not aware of any mechanism that prevents this.

To enter, the country has to decide to join and all the current members
have to agree.

Each of these decisions is made by the counties head of state,
although the laws of a given country might require a referendum
or new laws to be passed or acts of parliment or whatever.

The pronounciation of names varies by Traveller universe, and IMTU, varies from
person to person. Some species have difficulty pronouncing certain sounds, so
there is no standard rule.

For me, I say "eefayt", "bogeen" (with a hard G), and "syas". But that\'s me.

Certainly. So, it is a good thing that canon says that the Stalkers

I always judge that there are many ways to say a single name, due to
dialect differences and such. Also, lots local names for the same system
might be in use, due to different languages, cultural reasons et al.

For examples of local name variations, study how many of the European
countries are named in each others\' languages. Germany, Tyskland, and
Deutchland are all different names for the same place (in English,
Swedish, and German, respectively).

Also, study how different the name "England" is pronounced by an
Englishman, a NYC American, and a Texas American.

Another source of different names is from cultural reasons. For example,
China is referred to as the "Middle Kingdom" in Mandarin (Chinese). In
Traveller, all the inhabitants on a world might call it Home.

One name that illustrates this well is "Ivan".  In its natural russian, is
pronounced "EE-vahn".  In the U.S., we say "EYE-van".

Now I wonder how those pesky Vargr would say it?  Oh and what\'s Vargr for
"milkbone"?  :)

That\'s because it *wasn\'t* an apostrophe, it was a damned "right single
quote" from the Windows character set.

The trick for converting *any* word processor document to something
suitable for posting on the net is to tell the program that you are
using a "generic text-only printer". Then set the margins such that you
get only 72-75 characters per line (say .5 inch margins on each side).
Then print the document to a file.

Hm.  I don\'t have the picture handy, but the ship is a flattened cone with
the tip of the cone at the nose, right?  If the beam is about 90 meters at
the tail, and the height at the tail is 65 meters, and it\'s 145 meters long, 
then I can get just over 280000 cubic meters (20000 dtons).

I beleave that ST:TMP was to be the new ST tv show. Thats why you have all
of the long shots and character walk-ins. But well in pre-poduction Star
Wars came out, made a ton of money (much more than a tv show could ever
make). Paramount saw what SW was doing, and knowing with all the trekkies
out there, it had a hit movie know matter how bad it was. So the pilot
(ST:TMP) was turned into a movie and scripting for the next movie (ST: TWoK)
begain.

Put the PCs in a TL 8 world, let them enjoy the ride on a 
tram, and then let them watch *another* tram explode... they are the 
only witnesses.

Imagine the look on their faces when the police agent tells them 
that electrical trams can\'t explode, and starts eyeing them

If a country chose to leave, there would be nothing the EU could do about
it, even if they wanted to.  Remember the EU doesn\'t have an army, and
doesn\'t even really have a government.  Things are more likely to work the
other way round. A country could cause just use its veto to bring the EU to
a grinding halt and then they would probably be forced out (one way or
another).  Of course, for those countries in the single currency (or at
least when they issue bank notes), this would casue all sorts of problems -
imagine one country that decides it is going to print more bank notes.

As to how a country would decide to leave - that woudl be up to them.  In
the case of the UK, I can\'t image it happening without a referendum, but we
don\'t have any \'right\' to one.  Maybe other countries have a right to
referendums in their consitiutions (I think Switzerland does, but they\'re
not in the EU)  but the UK doesn\'t have a consitution.

Isn\'t it 10 per 1-G of acceleration the ship is capable of? I think this is

Interstellar travel is expensive and (more importantly) time-consuming
enough that nobody other than the very very *very* rich will vacation more
than a few parsecs from home, and the vast majority will stay in their
home systems.  Any system with a reasonably large population (and a
healthy economy) will have a multitude of resorts, parks, and so forth
available.  Consider that middle passage through one jump round trip for a
family of four is Cr 64k, and two weeks of the precious vacation time
blown in transit. 

And, in the spirit of this thread, a new Trav filk:

  STUCK ON QUOPIST AGAIN

  Just a couple years ago, I set out on the Main
  Lookin\' for an easy Credit, ain\'t hard now to explain
  I lost my crew, I lost my ship, guess I lost my way
  Oh! Lord, stuck on Quopist again.

  Jumped in on a trader, I\'ll be low-berthin\' if I go
  I was just droppin\' cargo, back a standard year or more
  Bank agents took my starship, seems like they took my friends
  Oh! Lord, stuck on Quopist again.

  The woman at Mora Finance loved my business plan
  Told me they\'d lend me money, and a helping hand
  Signed to pay for forty years, barely made it two
  Oh! Lord, stuck on Quopist again.

  If I only had a Credit, for every crooked deal
  Every time I laid down cash for cargos that weren\'t real
  You know I\'d catch a liner back to where I live
  Oh! Lord, stuck on Quopist again.

I presume that you mean in TNE/BL.

Most civilian ships in TNE have a AV of 10 x their max Gs, which is the 
minimum allowed. some have a little more, usually just enough to make 
their hulls an even number of cm thick. eg a 1-G ship would usually 
have an AV of either 10 or 14 (for SD).

AFAIK the norm in NZ is three weeks, plus a few holidays (christmas,

Sub hex for the AEMS, IIRC. I think that one has a 300km range AEMS, 
the other 3000KM. The PEMS ranges were about 1 hex, I think.

What if it\'s not an airlock, but instead a boat bay door or a lock for

_101 Ballistic Flightless Birds_, actually, which will feature thrown
penguins along with catapulted ostriches, dropped emus, hurled dodos, and
so forth.

> Along with a list of books and magazines (okay tc!) and some Patrons. 

Patron 102:

A nervous-looking man approaches the party in a quiet section of the
starport.  He is leading a 70cm tall penguin on a thin leash.  After
glancing around to be sure he\'s not overheard, he offers the party Cr 100
to throw the penguin.  Before anyone has time to answer, his eyes widen in
panic; he hands the leash to one of the party (dropping it if they refuse
to take it) and departs at a run.  The penguin stands calmly. 

1. Everything is as it seems.  If and when someone in the party throws
   the penguin at least two meters, the man will emerge from hiding,
   where he has been keeping the party under surveillance, and hand
   over Cr 100.  If the party appears to be leaving the immediate
   area, the man will confront the party and demand his penguin back.

2. The man is never seen again, no matter how many times and how
   hard the penguin is thrown.  It is a difficult task (dexterity
   and thrown weapon skill) to avoid injuring the penguin on the
   second and subsequent tosses.

3. The man is (more) psychotic (than the apparent situation indicates).
   If the penguin is thrown, he will attack the party with a machete,
   screaming "My baby!  My baby!".

4. The man is actually an agent for PETA, trying to dupe the party
   into revealing their barbarous anti-animal prejudices.  If the
   penguin is thrown, the party will find their ship picketed, their
   clothing (even synthetics) splashed with red paint, and their
   faces on cheaply-produced posters all over town.

5. The penguin is actually a Kd\'kran\'t!k, a sophont from a little-
   known world far to rim-spinward.  Apparently it likes this sort
   of thing.

6. Approximately three minutes after the encounter begins, whatever
   has transpired, both the man and the penguin disappear into thin
   air (fat air if UPP atm 8+).  The GM should pretend not to know
   what the players are talking about should they try to pursue the
   issue.

Oops!  I might have been thinking about some intelligence outfit or other,
or I may have just plain got it wrong.  I vaguely recall some outfit of
this kind being set up (using British and US models) around about this
time.  Of course it wasn\'t just this episode that caused it - the whole
anti-conscription thing was a threat to law and order, and the British
Empire, and God and the Protestant Churches too...

I checked on this one, but the first Intelligence body to be set up was the
Intelligence Corps, established on 6th of December 1907. Prior to this,
Australia\'s first military spy was William Throsby Bridges, who was sent to
New Caledonia to draw up plans of the French defences at Noumea. His cover
was that he was a traveller for Dalgety\'s, a pastoral and trading company.
The British had requested this mission to be conducted, however Australia
had a choice between Samoa or New Caledonia. The deciding factor in the
mission came down to a 2 pound difference in ticket prices. After the
mission was conducted, the British Government refused to pay expenses for
the mission and Bridges was left with the bill. I guess it might have been
an early form of "denying all knowledge".

There are no other records of any Australian intelligence body prior to
1907, and the 1903 incident is only known about because Bridges eventually
became the Commanding officer of Duntroon, the Royal Military College.

Easy.

Well, not *easy*, but certainly possible.  Using a sextant-like
instrument, an ephemeris (printed), and fixes on nearby bodies (star,
world, one or more moons, fixed stars for reference frame) you could get a
reasonably good position fix.  Do one of those every half hour or so and
you get your velocity, and over time your acceleration.  Knowing the
masses and radii of all the bodies (again, from a printed table) and the
principles of orbital dynamics, shaping a desired orbit is an exercise in
solving simultaneous diffy-Qs...no picnic, but people did it way back when
before all these here \'puters came along and spoiled the fun.

Note that doing manual orbital calculations, especially near a body, is
much harder if you are accelerating due to more than gravity -- that is,
if your \'sail\' is active/unfurled/deployed.  So to hit a narrow course
window accurately, you might want to get on course for it and then go
ballistic through it.  Conversely, though, continuing to get solar
acceleration longer makes for a faster run, so going ballistic is a bad
thing.  And there\'s our element of skill, neatly back into the picture.
And tension, too, as the front-runners head toward a grav-assisted turn
around a small moon and each waits to see if and when the others furl
sails.  Add in the fact that solar wind comes in gusts and not always
straight from the star and this is starting to look like an exciting sport
again!

But you might get the inverse, travelling entertainment.  Picture it,
"Carnies from the Stars",  "Cosmic Gypsies",  playing backsector mudballs,
...mining worlds and ag planets.  Bringing culture and live entertainment to
the great beyond.   A well financed troop with a good ship might do a planet
in a month and move on with the shows booked months in advance through
booking agents and advance men/space roadies.   They might have a regular
circuit hitting the same system every year or so with new acts and
entertainments.    Its a great cover for PCs looking to hide out and/or
pickup information about a subsector.   While I cannot think of the titles
there is at least one series I have seen which uses this plot device.
Anyone used this as a hook?  It has the advantage of linearity always a good
thing if you are plotting "string of beads" campaign.

Yes, that\'s the idea of always having the lights switched on when the

Well, not running you over, but making you see if the car will move :-)

If they haven\'t learned about human culture, they probably take it as a

Special effect of this in a movie: instead of the train slamming into whatever obstacle is a problem, there is a loud screeching sound and the train slams into whatever obstacle is a problem with essentially unmodified speed.

Of course, the Darrians would have an unfair advantage. They\'ll just pull a
mini-Maghiz, make the star flare at the right moment and in the right time, and
their sailboats get a huge boost! So what if the crew dies of radiation
poisoning a month later ...

Sort of, but not exactly. There is no doubt that Star Trek: The Motion
Picture (or, as alternately known: Star Trek: The Motionless Picture, or
Star Trek: The Still[1]) was shot for the big screen. You\'re right that
there was a Star Trek television show that was in production around the time
that Star Wars came out, and you\'re right that the success of Star Wars
showed the producers that movie sci-fi was not moribund. However, the
television show was going to take a different tack than the movie, and
little of the production work was used. Despite any number of bad things
that can be said about the movie, the production values were high. In
addition, if I remember correctly, they weren\'t even sure that they were
going to go with the original crew for the television show.

It is also apparent that ST:TMP had bombed completely and utterly by the
time that they began working on Star Trek II. In fact, if I remember
correctly, even the *possibility* of a Star Trek II was in jeopardy as a
result of the critical and popular failure of the first film. TWOK is a
complete reversal of ST:TMP. There was lots of merchandise riding on the
first film that flopped as well. As an example, it took the Star Trek
franchise a hell of a long time to build up the credibility to start getting
toy makers interested again.

I came to the same conclusion, I guess that great minds think alike. ;)

Wouldn\'t that be "troupe"? As in "Starship Troupers". ;)

Actually, Johnny Rico as Hamlet is a pretty entertaining thought.

universe! ;)

This also gives you the opportunity to close out the campaign by
cribbing Heinlein\'s "The Man Who Traveled in Elephants."

I won\'t spoil the plot, but, if you\'re not at least close to tears by
the end of the story, then either you haven\'t been paying attention, or
you\'re far more cold-blooded than I.

At the Concord Naval Weapons Station, they *did*.  I\'ve seen the tape.
There are sparks flying up from the wheels and the train stopped fairly
quickly, but you can\'t stop a few hundred thousand tons of steel on a dime.

Actually, by the time they got to God\'s planet, I half expected to see a
clown at the gate telling them, "thank you for coming to Wallyworld, but why
didn\'t you just take the bus like everyone else?  eyuck e-yuk e-yukkity
yuk."  And in fact I was cracking jokes like this towards that part..I was
so disappointed.  Figures though, when you realize Shatner had anything to
do with it.

Oops!  I might have been thinking about some intelligence outfit or other,
or I may have just plain got it wrong.  I vaguely recall some outfit of
this kind being set up (using British and US models) around about this
time.  Of course it wasn\'t just this episode that caused it - the whole
anti-conscription thing was a threat to law and order, and the British
Empire, and God and the Protestant Churches too...
</Alan>

Immediately after the incident in question, the PM appointed the first Commisioner of Commonwealth Police.  The agency was subsequently absorbed (along with the Special Investigations Bureau) into the Investigations Branch of AG\'s in 1922.  IIRC, the Commonwealth Police were reformed as a seperate entity in 1949 or thereabouts.

ObTrav : Ummm ?  What sort of \'federal\' police agencies exist in the TU, if any ?  Does the IMoJ fill that role ?  And if they do investigate crimes against the Empire, do they have the powers and resources to track criminals across known space ?  Would they bother ?  What sort of co-operation could they expect from local police agencies ?  Can I possibly ask any more questions in one paragraph ?

        I don\'t know what is worse, the fact you asked, or the fact I sat
down with AM:3 and figured out the answer.

        Ivan actually, is two syllables.  Under the word-gen tables on pp14,
that isn\'t doable.  The closest Gvegh will let you get is *spelt* "Ivan" but
pronounced "EYE-veh-An" -- three syllables.

        Now, "milkbone" is probably translated as "human wants a fight", but
we\'ll ignore that issue =).  Now, looking at the selected Gvegh words on
pp22 and pp23 finds nothing "canon" for either "milk" or "bone".  I suppose
you could presume that it\'d be an imported foodstuff and use "zduekhnge
foeloel koers" (literally "exotic friend foods", presuming that you never
tell the speaker *what* Milkbone is used for on Terra).  However, you are
essentially left stuck with the word generation tables.
        A quick visit to said tables results in the following:
"Khozul-Uer".  For reasons of perversity and flavour (excuse the pun), I\'d
suggest it to be a non-litteral iterpretation...  "Uer" to mean "bones or of
skeletal nature" and "Khozul" to mean "litter\'s milk".

Khozul could as be an insult, similar to calling someone a "momma\'s boy".

        Hi, Doug!
        Interesting spin.  From what AM:3 says of Vargr, anything which
denudes a Vargr\'s charisma/ boldness is very close to a mortal insult.  I\'d
suggest it wouldn\'t be the sort of saying used lightly.  Still, as I say, it
is a neat "slang" concept.

This gives me an idea. MTV has this thing called the Real World where they
pick a group of people out and have them live in a house togather. What if
in Traveller, large numbers of people can\'t travel offworld, then some
media corp might pick a small group and send them on a kind of Grand Tour
along with camera crews. After six months or so, they come back and their
footage is edited into a series of shows.

According to Shatner\'s book (Movie Memories):

Paramount was planning a ST tv show (ST Phase II) as the flagship show for the
launch of a Paramount TV network (which is what they eventually did with
Voyager). They pulled from the idea of the TV show and (according to rumour,
when Eisner saw how close encounters was doing) converted to the idea of the
movie. But the script for the TV pilot served as the first draft of the movie
script, and is much the same, apart from the different ending.

The story about WoK is unlikely, since a) the first film had a considerably
higher budget than the second, and b) in Shatner\'s book he has verbatim
interviews with the scriptwriters, the director, Nimoy, Kelley and Montalban
and it\'s pretty clear from all of them that the idea for a Space Seed sequel
came after ST:TMP.

And by the way, I like TMP the best out of all of them, barring First Contact.

Wow! MT with deckplans, please! (although I\'m sure many will want a T4 version)

Of course, you\'ll have to the get the TML to decide exaclt how big the thing
really is. Current votes are:
     400t
     1500t
     20000t

You may be interested to know that I ran the survival race from "Lee\'s Guide To
Interstellar Adventure" on Tavonni, when Caradoc was first scouting out the
planet.

I wrote up about 20 NPC\'s, including Baroness Heidi\'s younger brother and even
an undercover Zho. An obscure mob called "Unifoods" (they may actually have been
in the original adventure?) ran the thing, with the Caradoc PC\'s becoming
entangled halfway through.

Turned out that the Zho was using the event as part of his cover, while
performing a deep recon prior to the 5FW. He initially escaped the characters in
a Zho Leader Scout ship that had been hidden on the surface, only to have them
pursue and board it in orbit. He threw out some lifepods and went EVA, attached
himself to the PC\'s ship and deployed one of those foam drop capsules. When the
PC\'s shot up and/or captured the rest of the crew, they thought they had
finished. They re-entered Tavonni\'s atmosphere, at which point the Zho abandoned
(their) ship and re-entered independantly.

He survived to become a Zho squadron commander in the 5FV.

(Don\'t you just love playing NPC\'s that are as pesky as the players themselves?

There are problems with organ resonance at high enough power levels
(well below the 220dB level required to bore through concrete). IIRC
hollow organs e.g. stomach and intestine can be disrupted with
infrasound.
	You are correct in that cavitation and heating effects are not an issue
until you get to ultrasound frequencies in the megahertz range (a
\'juiced up\' diagnostic ultrasound machine could be quite dangerous, if
you could touch someone with the transducer).

> Another possibility, at least in the traveller universe:

The logical thing to use would be mini-Empress Wave generators -
psionically assault the crowd, or induce feelings of hopelessness, etc.
	Canon more or less prohibits the \'mechanical\' duplication of psionics
until well above Impy TLs, anyway (but gravisonic modulation and
psi-shield fields are an obvious exception to this).

> I do know that certain forms of RF have severe brain-disturbing

EM induction. This is the basis of magnetic cortical stimulation which
has been used as an alternative to electroshock therapy in depression.
Works reasonably well (but not as well as \'dial a smile\').

At Traveller TLs... I think Imperial cultural mores prevent ranged
devices of this sort from being developed. Certainly possible though
given the perfomance of sensor tech.

The most abundant radioactive isotope in a human is potassium-40 (which
makes up 0.0118% of your body potassium or some 0.0157g in a 70kg male).
	This contributes about 30 millirem per year to the average annual
radiation exposure of 100 millirems.
	Fizzing that off might do some damage.

And Long Service Leave is around 3 months worth after 10 years of service... I\'m

One other thing: when I was in the NSW PS years ago, it had a 35-hr week (7-hr
days). The C\'wealth has a 37.5 hr week (a weird 7 hr 21 min day). The states are
actually better off than the Commonwealth!

Ah! The Bi-annual Traveller Pronounciation Thread! From memory, "Boughene" has
always appeared as an entrant in each previous contest.

We dispensed with any attempts at a correct pronounciation and just call it
"Bognor". As in "Didn\'t we have a luv-er-ly time / The day we went to Bognor..."

;-)

(We do say "ef-ate", however... as in the F8 key on your keyboard.. it may be
significant that this is set to "DOWN" - ie "page down" - on IBM mainframes...)

Also see "The Circus" from E. E. "Doc" Smith\'s "Family d\'Alembert" series:
performers from a heavy-grav world doing tricks that would break "normal" humans
in half. Also served as a great cover for espionage activities on behalf of
S.O.T.E. (Service Of The Empire).

In terms of the nobility and empire background, the series is very
Traveller-esque - or maybe Trav was influenced by this series? The nobility
could almost be lifted wholesale and dropped into Trav without change... In
contrast to the Skylark and Lensmen series, it is more down-to-earth - it\'s not
galaxy-wide, for starters. ;-)  I thoroughly recommend reading this series if
you want to run an espionage-based Trav game, with a huge underlying conspiracy
that the PC\'s need to unravel.

Wow, I\'ve managed to tie two TML threads together with this posting!  :-)

not entirely true. STTMP was supposed to be 2 hour TV Pilot. IE, about 1:20
of program. They stretched it out to the movie. The program ws to be called
ST:Phase II. They filled in the extra length with panoramic views. Having
seen the Phase II writer\'s guide, they were already planning on doing a
klingon language when they were pitching to get a pilot filmed.

ST Ph II was started in 74, and not worked on seriously for a while. Your
statement seems interesting, can you provide a source? I\'ve seen no
references to that in any of the tell-all books about the behind the
scenes. I do know, based upon published sources, that TWOK was delayed for
about a year, and that movies 2 and later were all done by the TV side of
paramount...

Which brings to mind an excellent series of books by Barry Longyear, the 
"Circus World" series. Circus World, City of Baraboo, and a couple of others 
whose names escape me now. They tell of an interstellar circus, which 
eventually crashes on a planet, and the society that develops on the planet 
from the circus folk and roustabouts. HIGHLY recommended...

Nope. ST:TMP was originally what was supposed to be the pilot of a second
Star Trek series, one that would have had Decker as the first officer,
Ilia as the navigator, and Xon as science officer, with the occasional
guest appearance by Leonard Nimoy as Spock, retired from Star Fleet and
teaching on Vulcan.

Then Star Wars comes out and makes big bucks at the box office, so Paramount
decides to scrap the TV series (which was iffy to begin with) and do a 
feature film. Since everyone was crowing about the great special effects in
Star Wars, the powers-that-be at Paramount put in lots of special effects
shots; when the film came in overlong, they cut scenes of dialog instead
of effects shots.

The end result was a snore. And when Paramount heard what Gene wanted to 
do for the *second* ST film (Kirk & co. go back in time to prevent JFK\'s
assassination -- Spock becomes the hidden figure on the grassy knoll...),
TPTB @ Paramount give Gene an office and a title ("Creative Consultant")
and proceed to ignore him totally from there on in...

Try looking in Charleston, SC (USS YORKTOWN) or NYC (USS INTREPID)....

ObTrav:  A tie-in with the tourism thread - retired warships, converted
to museums, would likely be common tourist attractions in the Spinward
Marches.

Of course, then the question becomes:  can the museum ships be
reactivated?  (I smell a TNE adventure here....)

Snicker. My Traveller game has a Vargr engineer as the group\'s NPC. He
likes to snack on certain "cookies" that come from Terra, and no one has
had the heart (or courage?) to tell him what the cookies are really made
for.

"These are great... sure you don\'t want one?"

Were I one of those PCs, I would simply point out that, since Terra is
such a cosmopolitan world, a baking concern on Terra realized that there
would be a market for baked goods formulated to appeal to Vargr palates,
and that such goods are not quite as appetizing to monkey-boys. 
Entirely true (though misleading), if one assumes that Vargr tastes in
food are roughly similar to those of Terran canines.  If there _is_ a
major difference in food preferences between Terran canines and their
uplifted Vargr (distant) cousins, then said Vargr engineer probably
would not be so enamored of the "cookies" in question.

Well, in my referee\'s TU, ships can exit jumpspace closer than 100
diameters from a major celestial body, if the astrogator, pilot, and
engineer all roll successfully (difficulty is based on intended distance
of jump exit from the body in question).  The nearest jump I\'ve seen in
our campaign has been 10 diameters from a planet (we were dropping a
battalion of jump troops), which required (IIRC) Formidable [3D] rolls. 
My character (the commander of the regiment to which the jump troops
were assigned) would not have allowed the risk of jumping closer than 10
diameters (had the issue been suggested by the Navy), due to the
increased risks to all ships in the jump.  He would rather have given up
a portion of tactical surprise, than risk a ship with some of _his_
soldiers catastrophically misjumping.

Of course, YPMV (your parsecage may vary)....

One of the details in Rocket Jockey was that "our hero" used a course
to Mercury that cut a *lot* closer to the Sun than anybody thought was
safe. 

It\'s not *just* your thrust (or delta-v for reaction drives). It\'s also
things like what sort of stresses your ship may be able to take, and
just how close to redline you are willing to push those stresses.

It\'s not *that* hard, especially with ships that can do the sort of
"constant boost" that most Traveller ships do.

Earth orbits at 30-40 km/sec (too lazy to look up the exact figure). At
1 g, constant boost, you hit 40 km/sec in 1 hour, 6 minutes and 40
seconds. 

With thruster plate drives that can operate all thru the inner system,
you can simply *look up* the position of the target planet at various
points in the future, figure the distance versus your accel (don\'t
forget to allow for turnover halfway!) and aim at more or less the
point it\'ll be at when you get there.

Solar gravity and other factors will throw you off a bit, but you can
*manually* correct for the errors. 

With a 1-g or more, constant boost ship, you can almost literally
"point and go". There are better trajectories than the one you\'d get
that way. But if you aim for where you expect the planet to be, you are
close enough to an optimum orbit that it doesn\'t make a lot of
difference.

Well, one BBS locally started archiving early. All but the first month

And the sysop is *slowly* putting up sections of the archives on his

Subsonics have a couple of "show stopper" problems. First, due to the
*huge* wavelengths, the emitters have to be huge too. And second, again
because of the huge wavelengths, you can\'t shield your people from
them.

Yeah, sure stuff moves fast in space, but remember,
computers only do what humans can do, only much
faster. When we have computers to do the clacs, we
have them calculate every second\'s postion, every last
little thing - then forget something obvious like one
lot of calcs using imperial measurements, another lot
using metric (see NASA\'s failed mission to Mars). The
crews of the Apollo missions all took slide riles with
them, and manually checked the computer\'s calcs; they
didn\'t trust their lives with them. They did about 10
km/sec. Recall also during the movie "Apollo 13" when
the pilot uses the earth\'s terminator (day/night
shadow line) to change the craft\'s course, and keep it
steady.

It\'s hard, but it can be done.

 If it\'s much bigger than the second figure, it doesn\'t get deckplans...

Based on the size of the airlock, the bridge deck is NOT two decks high like 
the windows suggest.  The change in wedge angle amidships is all wing (see 
the shape of the hull at the aft firewall). A raw measurement of the ship 
length versus the airlock pit gives a length of 60m. A 60m Needle is 300 
DTons; a 60m Wedge is 500 DTons. The hull is about four decks high at the 
rear (again a raw measurement), and one deck or less at the nose.

 Adding perspective to the picture doesn\'t really change the length, since 
the base measurment is amidships. Perspective will lead to the nose being 
deeper and the tail shallower than depicted, though. As mentioned before, 
perspective and lighting oddities (follow the shadow line to the nose, then 
compare the shadow on the tailfin to the lighting on the hull) make this 
vessel hard to pin down completely. I\'ll do some sketching first...

Don\'t forget that I mentioned the Area. (Oh, BTW, thanx for the commentary,
Robert). That includes the ground... Take for example the Fairbanks, Alaska
area... Local backgroiund rads are about 3x surface norms, due to the
(non-commercially viable) low-grade uranium deposits, which include the
gravel pits from which fairbanks road-paving gravels are drawn; In juneau
they use Jade.... Add that and the potasium, plus certain more stable
elements beginning to come unglued, and you can probably get a considerable
ammount of low-rate rads.... probably a good siege weapon...

Hmm... a damper would be detectable with a geiger counter, wouldn\'t it? Use
it as a threat-effect weapon. Toss em a geiger counter with a transponder
and no controls. (Beeps it\'s coords based upon GPS)... then set the dampers
up to about 20% more decay rates.... And every so often, put a burst (from
a separate projector) near the tricked out geiger counter. Psych warfare...
and keep increasing the decay rates until they either go nuts from the
clicking, or realize the longer they wait the more dangeours the rad threat
will be.

Another thought... what does all that potassium 40 decay into, and is it
used in any neurotransmitters?

And as I noted, the folks taking those luxur cruises aren\'t "Joe

Yep. And frankly, I think space travel is more expensive in *time*
rather than money. Anybody who has been cooped up with the kids in a
car on a vacation trip is going to think two and even three times about
spending *two weeks* in jump with their kids. And there\'s gonna be that
thought "what if we don\'t like <tourist attraction>"? That\'ll make the
week in jump on the way back *really* bad.

ObTrav: The players ship gets a family as passengers. The husband
figured it\'d be *so* much cheaper buying passage on a "tramp" than on a
luxury liner. The kids will, of course, be bored stiff about 3 hours
out of port. The wife will be bored about a day later. And the ship\'s
Steward will be going *nuts* trying to keep them happy. The rest of the
crew will have to deal with bored kids trying to investigate
*everything*. 

For extra fun, after they deliver the family, have them encounter the
family coming *back* (father\'s budget wouldn\'t allow the to take the
liner back). Even if the players have a cargo going back to the world
they started from (funny how easy that cargo was to get :-) I bet
they\'ll lift without *any* passengers before they\'ll let *that* bunch
back on the ship!

It may help to consider these well known families as the passengers in
question:

The Bundie Family (Al, Peg and the kids)
The Simpson Family (Homer, Marges, Bart....)
The Addams Family (Gomez, Morticia, Pugsley, Wednesday)

Any other suggestions?

You aren\'t thinking "big" enough. Maybe they fell into an alternate

they are the victims of a botched mindwipe.

The second is sort of what I was thinking. We are talking *literally*

Something *I* discovered is that in a long running campaign, it pays to
let the players brief new players on the "background" and "history" of
the campaign. You\'ll find that they\'ll have invented all sorts of
details that you never gave them, and linked things you never thought
of connecting.

An example was this *elliptical* crater, partly filled with water in
the area the D&D players were campaigning in. They had visted it
*once*, in *daylight*. Yet I heard them tell new players about how the
pool glowed in the dark. Thus are myths created and legends born.

Players are *always* "unconsciously" filling in details. And by letting
them brief newbies, you find out about these "fill ins". Then you can
either adopt them, or you can not them down and wait for a chance to
use them to trip up the players by having these assumptions prove
*wrong*.

And after their run-in with whatever variety of parasites, have them
run into a *good* symbiont. Say the cave critter from the F.Paul Wilson
story I can\'t recall the title of or the ones from Hal Clement\'s
"Needle" and "Through the Eye of a Needle". 

Now the "infected" player has to first, keep from panicking, and
second, once he understands what\'s going on, keep his buddies from
killing him!

Then there\'s always the "Dirty Pair" scenario. Kei & Yuri are a pair of
top notch law enforcement types. There\'s just this one *little*
problem. Whenever they get involved, disasters happen. It\'s 100%
demostrable that it simply is *not* their fault. Their actions don\'t
cause the disasters, and there\'s nothing they could have done to
prevent them. Nonetheless, disasters occur. 

A *minor* example was when they were *passing thru* a space station. A
robbery went bad and one of the crooks accidentaly activated a bomb that
not merely blew a hole in the hull, it ble it right at an airtight
bulkhead, thus compromising *two* sections of the station.

This gives the "Lovely Angels" (their code name) the unofficial tag of
"the Dirty Pair" and means that *nobody* wants to work with them. 

Have someone like that following the PCs. Possibly for benign reasons
(maybe they are shadowing the characters waiting for an old enemy to
attack them). 

The players will go nuts. And just think of the fun if/when they
determine the *cause*. 

Player1: "I\'m gonna *kill* those jinxes!"
Player2: "You can\'t do that! They work for Imperial Security"
Player3: "And besides, just imagine what could go wrong if you were
         *trying* to commit violence in that \'jinx field\' of theirs!"

I agree on variation across different regions, and according to species, and
even have a few alternate pronunciations depending on which character (of
five *main ones* so far) I\'m playing.

Efate: eh-fit, ee-feh-tay
Boughene: bow-thayn, boo-geen (hard g)
Psias: si-es (long i, short e)

Of course some worlds vary little in pronunciation, unless the species can\'t
make the sounds, like Bronze, Iron, Regina, etc.

I know for a *fact* that there are surgical muscle relaxants that *do*
only effect the "voluntary" muscles. They leave the heart and lungs
alone. Mind you, I seem to recall that they do this by blocking nerve
impulses from the spine, rather than by directly affecting the muscles...

Spasm *wasn\'t* a riot control agent. It was a load for a very
specialized weapon. It was *targeted*, not sprayed indiscriminately. 

You seem to have rolled the comments on spetsdods (an odd "hand
weapon") and anti-riot measures into one. They were seperate subjects.

Real world items:

A derivative of one of the high blood pressure meds. It slowly lowers
your blood pressure. After a while, you get faint if you are standing.
So you sit down (or fall down) after more time, you are faint even
sitting up, so you lie down or fall down. Now, you are flat on your
back, and getting over excited will tend to make you pass out. Now the
riot police can collect you.

A derivative of that surgical muscle relaxant I mentioned. The effects
start at the base of the spine and work up. So you lose control of your
feet and ankles, then of the knees, etc, until you are effectively a
(temporary) quadraplegic. Again, at this point the police wander over
and pick you up. 

Supposedly both of these are hard to administer overdoses of, and have
limited effects (ie the blood pressure won\'t drop too low, and the
"nerve block" stops before it gets too high up the spine).

  If one wants to follow Triplanetary (and of course, one does :> ), then
real racers would use ion drives - low thrust, high-fuel efficiency for
those _long_ races. And then you could simulate Triplanetary one turn of
double thrust to represent a long burn over the drives safe on-line duration,
to be followed by maintenance before being allowed again.

  You could also have crew aboard to perform that maintenance to allow
multiple long burns during a single leg of a race; a crit failure on 
the relevant skill roll might mean that the drive may remain off-line
totally for one turn.

  If other crew have roles (no/minimal computers means that you want a
navigator, or all skills are penalized if performing multiple roles),
then the designer also needs to decide between having lots of crew, or
getting more reaction mass into the tanks.

  Given that a very small crew may be highly over-worked - making the
race a matter of skill, design, and the endurance of both the ship and
its complement - we can only await FS chemical amplification programs,
or the Sayat\'s ever so loosely-interpreted definition of "design/ship/
abominations-of-genetic-engineering".

The same is true in my Traveller universe.  There are so many sophont
species and so many languages that it\'s not practical to have standard
pronunciations.  The only way to designate a system so that everyone
will know which one it is is to point it out on a map.

Of course. But the ends are just a moment\'s whim. The method can be

Still, that is something else as saying that suicide can be

Particle Accelerators although specci in appearance have a couple of useful
side effects: yes it would be possable to recover a ship hit by a PAW.
However if the ship is small ie. a merchantman, or scout. You will find that
for the weapon to be effective at space ranges it will often cause little
more than scraps to be recovered, and to add to that dilemma, if it is fired
at larger ships such as destroyers +, you will find a problem of Fibre-Optic

many bad criticals.

Although:
According to TNE:Fire Fusion & Steel a nuclear dampner may just do the
trick, the description at the end of of the paragraph on what it can do is
very vague though, and I\'d like some clarification if anyone would care to
offer some, but it would appear that it may be possible to inhibit the
fusion reaction in a ships fusion reactor, and definitely can in the case of
a fission reactor.
This would be the closest I could suggest for capturing vessels, with the
added bonus that a shot need not be fired.

if the details were wrong.  <Relief>

I guess the IMOJ would do it.

Back in the early \'80s FASA put out High Passage magazine, which had a
bunch of scenarios set in the Old Expanses.  Some of them referred to the
IMOJ Special Branch, which was engaged in hunting down a bunch of pirates
operating out of a couple of backwater systems.

It might actually make sense for a "police" agency to do this kind of
thing.  Outfits like the IN wouldn\'t necessarily have the investigative
skills required to track them down.  The Navy would be good at tracking the
ships, but they wouldn\'t be as good at tracking the money.

As for local co-operation, it would, of course depend.  Presumably MOJ
agents would be operating under the equivalent of a limited Imperial
Warrant, which would allow them to demand assistance, but there is a
difference between enthusiastic and unenthusiastic assistance.

The cases that they would deal with would be those involving Imperial laws
and interests, as well as any that impact on people and organisations
important enough to pull the required strings.

Considering the level of criminal Kei and Yuri deal with, it\'s arguable
that, even had their actions caused the disasters, the damage would
still be less than if their particular target had gotten away. OK, maybe
not the time a flesh-eating virus got released on a high-pop planet...
or the giant starliner crashing into a major metropolitan area...

They\'re usually *involved* with the disasters, and it may even be that
they could have prevented some of them, but it\'s usually bad guys driven
to extreme behaviour that actually cause the really bad oopses.

Question for the law enforcement types on the list: if a cop chases a
bad guy, and the bad guy does something very destructive in an escape
attempt, (say, drives a truck at high speed through a crowded pedestrian 
mall,) does the peace officer get blamed? Or does he just get blamed if
the chase was not successful in catching the criminal?

In Norway it is common that the press and media blame to LEO for this.
The Special Branch for Investgating the Police most often find nothing wrong
(actually 99 prosent of all charges against the Police are dropped). 
But the media often blames the LEO\'s for provoking the criminals and
putting innocent people at risk.

I think there was an article, "Law in the Imperium," back in 
Challenge, which spoke about the Imperial Ministry Of Justice (IMOJ) 
and gave some statistics for the number of agents. Numbers were not 
very good, but there was a good discussion of what they were supposed 
to hunt down, IIRC. There was a very usable "Universal Law 
Profile" with codes for determining likely intensity of prosecution 
and likely penalties for a variety of crimes.

There are canonical examples of systems that left (or was abandoned by) the
Imperium. Mostly as a result of the frontier wars, but there is at least one
that left in peacetime. There are no details about why that was allowed to
happen.

I guess things will be different in the benevolent (?) 1105 Imperium 
and in the aggressive, dark Millieu-Zero Imperium. For that 
matter, things could be different on a core sector (if they leave 
they are isolated) and in a frontier one (if they leave they may 
fall under another power\'s influence) When did those episodes 
happen?

There is a possible method which, while not dictated by Traveller canon,
at least does not *violate* canon.  Read part of the TML PBeM archive:

  http://www.ssgfx.com/traveller/archive/

in "1993, Turn 2, Parts 3 & 4", one of the more brilliant crew-members
of the Elissa manages to scram the fusionplant of an attacking ship with
carefully focused beams from a meson comm system.  Meson decay inside
the enemy powerplant causes just enough instability that the plant
takes itself off-line.  Had the attacking ship not already had it\'s
Zocchai (sic) array charged, they would not have escaped.

As one of the co-refs. for that game, I thought the players idea was
damned clever! :^)

While true, the solar wind is orders of magnitude weaker than the light pressure (magsails can be bigger by the same factor, maybe), so in practice a solar sail can be treated as a pure lightsail.

You point big guns at it and transmit \'surrender or die\'.  Alternately, with incredibly good aiming you can take out specific systems, and at least bash less of the hell out of it (this would be 1-2 levels more difficult than simply hitting the ship, and would require comparably superior sensors).  A low power PAW could also disable a ship with relatively minor damage (Traveller ships have uber-radiation shielding, so you\'d need to punch a hole in the hull, but after that it really doesn\'t take much more to cook the crew with radiation poisoning).  The previously mentioned \'ionic weapons\' would be totally useless in space -- that\'s a CPAW, and has negligible space range.

I would relish the opportunity.  Ellison may be a fine writer (though most
of his stuff isn\'t my cup of tea), but his behavior toward fans and other
pros is intolerable.  I\'ve seen him heap abuse on thirteen year old neos
who obviously are terrified of even speaking to an author, and make concoms
jump through hoops.

There\'s a reason why almost every American fan who reads "Bimbos of the
Death Sun" assumes that Appin Dungammon is supposed to be Harlan.  The
Brits all think Appin is Michael Moorcock.

Any (all) of EC Tubb\'s Dumarest novels (to which Traveller owes an 
enormous amount).

Some of Piper\'s work. Some of Poul Anderson\'s, too.

Aside from those it depends what kind of Traveller you\'re talking about 
(atmospherically speaking :)

Were his books written in inspiration of Traveller?  The entire series seems
to fit regular \'canon\' classic traveller perfectly.  Most of the things
mentioned in the LBB\'s can be found in his novels with the same names.

Speaking of Naval bases in Alameda..;)

Anyone ever wonder why, in Star Trek 4, Chekov keeps pronouncing "vessels"
with a "w"?  There is no "w" in the russian alphabet.  "Vessels" would have
sounded just like it should, albeit with a strong slavic accent.  :)

Niven and Pournelle\'s _The Mote in God\'s Eye_ always struck me as
being fairly Traveller-like.  Pournelle and S. M. Sirling recently wrote a
series of Falkenberg\'s Legion novels that fit, too, although I don\'t recall
the titles at the moment.

I agree!  Its sessions like this that make the game more than just another
RPG.  I think this is the nost clever move I\'ve ever read about and
obviously that group really had their "thinking tooques" on.

Hi Tim.

You might consider Asimov\'s "Foundation" trilogy (and yes, I know it\'s much
more than a trilogy now). It is one of the most readily apparent influences
on Traveller, and it has a distinct Travellerian atmosphere.

Folks have pretty much covered the old stuff, though I would also add in
Andre Norton\'s SF. 

Her Solar Queen and other free trader books especially: Sargasso of Space,
Plague Ship, & Postmarked the Stars are all good choices. 

For more modern books I highly recommend both the Hellflower trilogy by
Eluki bes Shahar: Hellflower, Dark Traders, & Archangel Blues

& the Exordium series by Sherwood Smith & Dave Trowbridge:  The Phoenix in
Flight, The Ruler of Naught, A Prison Unsought, Rifter\'s Covenant, & The
Throne of Kronos

Both series have a *very* Traveller-like feel, but are also clearly 90s
SF, so there are an excellent guide for how to update Traveller while
still preserving its distinctive feel.

There were several specifically Traveller-based novels published; I\'ve
never read any of them, so I can neither recommend nor warn you away from
them.

To my way of thinking, the most Traveller-like \'feel\' I\'ve ever
encountered in a novel is in Iain Banks\' _Consider Phlebas_.  The tech is
quite different (and notably more advanced), but the plot setups,
motivations, and background color will feel very homelike to any Traveller
player. 

Oh, and it\'s also utterly effing brilliant. :)

Ah, at last an excuse to rant about my job in the TML..

1.  Passenger who accepts your terms of service, up until they actually
board the ship, at which point they demand all sorts of changes, all of
which are detrimental to your ship/health/sanity.  (RL: At least once a
month I get somebody who says "I have to at the airport in 15 minutes, so
you can\'t pick up anybody else")

2.  The ever-popular language barrier!  Passenger doesn\'t speak Galangic,
or any other tongue the characters can figure out.  But he certainly seems
to be on about *something*...  (RL: The question "What airline are you
taking" can become quite an adventure)

3.  The passenger tries to pay in an inconvenient form.  Of course, this is
a charter on a barren rock.. (RL: people who assume that I\'m going to be
able to break a $100 on a $13 fare at 0500.)

4.  Passenger sets up his business in your ship.  Despite polite requests,
he persists in using ship resources to further his own ends.  His excuse?
"I paid for this trip!"  (RL: 7 guests going to the Financial District, and
every one is glued to a cell phone or a laptop, sometimes to the point
where I can\'t get where their going out of them.)

I feel better now.

It depends on the jurisdiction - and that doesn\'t necessarily
mean the _police_department_ jurisdiction in question.  For
example, all five boroughs/counties of New York City are serviced
by the same New York City Police Department - but if the scenario
you describe happens in the Bronx, the cop is held fully
responsible (if a black man is arrested by a white cop, and has a
heart attack in custody, it\'s a racist murder), whereas in
mid-Manhattan, the cop will get screwed for engaging in an unsafe
chase against department policy, but the scumbag he was chasing
will get nailed for the pedestrians.

I\'m sorry; do I sound bitter or cynical in the above? If so, it\'s
because I am; I\'m not a cop (civilian computer geek working for
the NYPD), but I\'ve seen good cops get screwed or worse because
of shit like this.

Disclaimer: The New York City Police Department allows me to have
my own opinions.  Since they do, and I do, I don\'t post theirs.
Besides, I pay for this account with my own money.

Kinda like yacht-racing and computer-designed ships?

Two suggestions:

Limit computers. Sure, you _have_ the TL10+ computers, but if you run
anything but the official nav package you are disqualified. In an
emergency, you run the fancy "get me out of here" application which flies
your ship (but then you\'re out of the race).

Include a refueling skim. You fly to the gas giant, skim to refuel, and fly
back. Plenty of room for piloting down in the smoke.

True enough. But you\'re also assuming that two week vacations are the norm.
That\'s true in North America (except in Saskatchewan, where three weeks are
teh legal minimum), but look at Europe. Britain has the worst record, and
they are at four weeks minimum.

So, several possibilities that do allow for tourism:

1) Vacations are, by and large, longer than in contemporary NA.

2) Taking a "sabbatical" is a recognized practice.

3) Young people "take a tour" before starting adult life. Possibly this is
a coming-of-age rite.

Alternately, their work is such that they can take it with them. Writers
and computer programmers spring to mind.

I get two months off a year--but I work 60-80 hours a week for the other
ten months. (I theoretically get two weeks off at Christmas and a week off
in March, but I always end up spending about 40-hours/week marking or
writing reports during those \'vacations\', which I factored into the above
figures.)

That would probably kill me.  My blood pressure is abnormally low

"Supposedly" isn\'t good enough unless you\'re willing to tolerate
casualties. A lot of people have ideosyncratic drug reactions, there\'s
possible synergistic effects with other substances people may ahve
ingested, and of course there\'s the question of effects on alien
biochemistries (this is Traveller, after all).

There was. Unfortunately, the article reads very much like a summary of
common law as it exists in America.The whole article basically ignored the
"hands off" Imperium in favour of one where the MoJ behaved like the FBI.
Very much a "Yanks in space" article. As well, the numbers for MoJ agents
were ridiculously large, and gave a MoJ presence that would make a whole
bunch of published adventures useless (because the adventures relied on
having no Imperial representatives around).

Extremely disappointing, especially when you consider all the possibilities
that were ignored.

Agreed. Actually a number of his SF novels have PC-like protagonists, 
_Against a Dark Background_ in particular. I didn\'t mention them 
earlier because of the high TL in Banks\' SF.

Hey! We have something like that already! ISTR it\'s called "Race around the
World". Talented young filmmakers were picked from many applicants, given a
camera and sent off around the world. Every couple of weeks they had to send
back an interesting story, which were then critiqued and scored by judges.
I can just see this sort of thing working in the Imperium. Good Idea.

Great Ideas! That\'s the sort of thing I wanted. The Subsector Fair is full of
possibilities.
It is exactly the \'draw\' I was talking about. It would have to run for months,
but would draw
visitors from across the subsector. Maybe every ten years or so there would be a
 big
sector wide draw that lasts a full year. Much like the Imperium would have held
in 1000
on Capital/Core to comemorate the founding of the Imperium. That would be
something
like the Olympics, for example, that would have contestants drawn from all
worlds in the
sector. The athletes might take months to get to the venue and have to be
subsidised
by their governments to pay the fares. It could lead to all sorts of adventures
for the PC\'s:

The PC\'s arrive while the games are being held.
The PC\'s are contestants.
The PC\'s provide security for a group of athletes from a rival planet.
The PC\'s are transporting a group of unruly athletes to the games.
The PC\'s are asked to transport a promising athlete who can\'t quite pay the fare
 and
wants to work his passage.
The PC\'s are asked to investigate allegations of corruption in the ticketing
arrangements.
oops!

In all this talk of travel, we\'re forgetting the
humble 20th century backpacker. It\'s estimated that at
any one time there\'s 30,000 backpackers travelling up
and down the coast of eastern Australia. Surely in the
future such people will still be around? People who
take the expense of a four week annual holiday, and
turn it into a year (or more!) long aimless wander. I
guess this is what "low passage" is for, eh?

It will depend on the circumstances of the chase and the crime that the bad 
guy committed.
But generally if the officer followed departmental guidelines then there 
would not be any criminal action.  Of course civilly it is another 
matter.  As an example an criminal who has committed a violent felony would 
be pursued while a misdemeanor or a traffic offence we would break off.

More or less simultaneously, one of the other crazed^H^H^H^H^Hbrilliant
crew-members comes up with an unconventional but extremely effective 
method of repelling boarders, using a swimming pool and some applied
physics...

As one of the players in that game, I thought that idea was also damned

No-one has yet mentioned, there is actually an
official Traveller novel - at least one, anyhow. It
begins with a captain anxious to make his payments on
his ship, and looking for a crew... he takes on a
mysterious passenger, an alien of unrecognised race,
and...

I forget the name, Jeff might know if there wre any
others written? It even had some basic traveller rules
in the back, it was a game tie-in....

why not have a race through an asteriod belt, having to go past a set of
beacons making up different stages. that way it will be more like a car
rally than deep sea yachting, so  the circuit isn\'t too large and that way
you would be able to have enough camera ships to get a good look at the
action. The course could be arrranged so you could go the longer but safer
route through the asteroids or the quicker but more dangerous route, and
you could change between stages or try half the safe then swap over to the
dangerous mid stage, and  then the final stage would be a sprint to the finish


you would have a set computer type so as to make it an exercise in
navigation and piloting, you could also have the refueling stage as was
suggested Robert Prior fixed software, unlimited software, different ship
and crew size classes, different TL classes, racing against the clock or
against other ships, include ECW

I reckon thats enough to make it a spectacle. if you think it\'s popular you
can have at the end of a race, media corps using high jump couriers to get
the race tapes to the surrounding systems. that gives you some good
adventure oportunities such as stealing the tapes, trying to beat the corps
with a bootleg set of tapes or trying to stop bootleg tapes from gettin out
of the system for the corps

I picked out a couple of systems that would make good racing systems in the
Spinward marches but I\'m at work and my notes are at home

how does that sound

Consider that the "World\'s Fair" runs for pretty much a year (or
more!). 

Allowing for travel time, and setup and the like, I\'d expect subsector
Fairs to run for at least a year. And say, have scheduled for starts 5
years apart. That\'s to allow travel & setup time for the exhibits from
worlds that can\'t afford to duplicate their setups. 

Also, if they last from 1-3 years, then there\'s lots of time for people
to save up, and a bigger window to plan trips around. 

I expect them to be scheduled up to 25 years in advance.

Sectors are even bigger, so put Sector fairs on, say, a 10 year interval.

Just had another look at the SMC, and Doug is right - is could have been done
MUCH better. For example, in the Referee\'s Synopsis of the intro adventure,
references are made that are left out of the expanded version - you really need
to read both sections fully to understand what the hell is going on.

Anyway, something else that I found is that the High Guard stats for the 20,000t
Battle Riders show that each have "4 Gunboats" as carried craft - but the stats
for the gunboats are not given. Thus the "154th Squadron" is missing some ships.
If I get some time, I\'ll try to re-engineer the \'Riders according to HG, just so
that I can see how big the "gunboats" are. Obviously, they are NOT 20,000t
worth, but probably closer to the median 1500t figure..

Alternatively, would someone else with more time on their hands (and access to
the stats - I forgot to bring them in) like to give it a shot?

BTW, the 154th appears as a 6-2-8 unstreamlined squadron counter in the 5FW
boxed game (6 = Attack, 2 = Bombardment, 8 = Defence).

I would read Stephenson Donaldson Gap series, though its not 
quite Travellerish, it has first contact, theft, space pirates, and lots 
of plot twist just to name a few reasons to read them.

The other Rick Shelley. Though I have not read everyone of his 
books (most though)  His treatenment of war is probably the best i 
have read.  His ability to combine command level, with the actions 
of lone solider and the locale population effect is great. Also for 
those who are tired of the American Centeric SF, his universe is 
anglo centeric, with a new British Commonwealth.

Well, the characters might not be whiners, but how about the players?

GM: "Ohhh... A hit for 2 points of damage."
Player: "Ugh... that puts me out. Am I dead?"
GM: "Yeah, \'fraid so."
Player: "Whaddya mean I\'m dead? How can Eniri just die like that?"
GM: "Well, the Aslan beat you in single combat..."
Player: "C\'mon! That\'s just absurd. How could he beat me?"
GM: "He was an Aslan martial arts champion. You knew that before you
repeatedly called his honor into question and told him he couldn\'t fight his
way out of a paper bag..."

...and so on, until at last:

GM: <in frustration> "SERENITY NOW!"

Would you like to elaborate? Give us some new ideas about the MoJ, since its
canon is patchy.

Here\'s my initial ideas to kick around:
- - restricted jurisdiction of planetary law leads to legal bounty hunters
- - is the MoJ set up as S.O.T.E., one office per system (but then do you have too
much Imperial representation?), or is it much, much smaller (the Secret Service,
rather than the FBI?)
- - how tenacious are the MoJ?
- - given the Imp Navy background from T4, who has jurisdiction over pirates? Do
the MoJ only follow the money trail, while the IN smash the ships? Does the IISS
have a role? ie. are there still "turf wars" or has this been ironed out over
the last 1000 years?
- - and finally, long-term TMLers probably know my opinion about the status of
IRIS - that I believe it can be explained as a remnant of the post-Rebellion
MoJ, setting themselves up as Emperor-brokers.

What about physical restraint materials? I can think of two examples
from SF:

1. Riot Foam from Judge Dredd: stuff sprayed like from fire hoses, which
hardens moments after contact with air. It\'s possible to breathe through
it (porous? gas permeable?) but once it sets, you have to be chipped out...

2. This is less firm in my memory, but I seem to recall something in
the novel on which Soylent Green was based, something about a very long
strip of metal that was carried coiled and tied... as soon as the it was
untied, it returned to its original, straight, shape. Not sure exactly
*how* this was supposed to be used for riot control, and my reference
could be incorrect... (I don\'t even remember the name of the novel...)

Great, except that old people and kids will get killed
by it! This is the sort of problem that\'s stopped such
chemical solutions being used nowadays.

To be fair to the Storyteller System games, they\'re not supposed to be
really all that depressing, and most of the darkness is purely a matter of
style. When played "right", Vampire is really about tragic heroism. Check
out the section on Humanity if you don\'t believe me. Every other game in the
Storyteller System line has something similar built in, whether it\'s part of
the plot, as it is with the struggle against dark forces for control of
reality in Mage, or part of the system, as it is with Vampire and Werewolf,
or a little of both, as it is in Wraith.

Ultimately, the tragedy in the various White Wolf games comes from the
alienation and isolation inherent in the settings. That\'s nothing new for
cultural heroes in America. In westerns, it\'s common for the lone gun
fighting hero to ride off into the sunset as a sad song plays. Police
heroes, like Dirty Harry, are alienated from their peers due to their work
ethic, as well as their community at large. Bruce Willis has made a career
playing the embittered, alienated and isolated hero.

Considering the fact that most roleplayers, especially young roleplayers,
are *already* socially isolated "strange dudes", and the fact that young
people today are literally filled to the brim with anxiety, it\'s not hard to
see the appeal. Most of them *are* managing that in real life already.

Take a look at the various "character classes" in the Storyteller Systems
games, take out the various supernatural elements, and if you\'re between the
age of 16 and 25 or so - maybe even a little older - you\'ll likely see the
bare bones of one or more people you already know.

Still, it is entirely possible to play a game in the Storyteller System that
doesn\'t collapse into angsty cheese or meaningless slaughter. In my own
experience, it\'s also relatively common. *All* roleplaying games have the
capacity to collapse into either mindless cliches or meaningless slaughter.
The accusation is usually levelled at AD&D and Vampire... but, it\'s more a
matter of popularity than anything else. If Traveller were to suddenly
replace Vampire in market share tomorrow, it would be less than a week
before people would criticize Traveller for the same reason. I\'m not
highlighting the critics as much as the players.

Yeah, popular games are going to draw lots of folks, especially younger
folks, who are going to play adventures and campaigns filled with
meaningless slaughter. Some of these folks will fall away and leave the
hobby entirely due to boredom, others will get bored and become "mature"
roleplayers and stick with the hobby.

I can see where you\'re coming from, but the "excessive liberalism" is
slightly out of place. It\'s not like goths are embracing some sort of
fascistic ideology or anything. The goth / industrial movement has always
been utterly fascinated with the late 60s, usually directly via covers,
samples... but in other ways that aren\'t directly apparent. There are too
many to list here, but the late 60s and early 70s *did* have their "dark"
moments and music as well. While people were chanting "Make Love Not War"
the Stones were releasing Beggar\'s Banquet and singing "I was around when
Jesus Christ had his moment of doubt and pain". Then there was David Bowie
and the androgynous glam movement. Let\'s put it this way: it was no accident
that Peter Murphy, the singer for Bauhaus (one of the earliest lights in the
goth movement), covered Bowie -nay... emulated Bowie down to the last
detail - and named his label Beggar\'s Banquet. It\'s no accident that most
goths have their Bowie collection.

Of course, there were lots of other things going on in the 60s and early 70s
as well that contributed, in one way or another: the God is dead movement,
the occult revival, the exploitation film boom...

To say that it\'s the movement is merely a reaction is to grossly
oversimplify things.

Well, to focus on one small segment of a movement in the way that it
interacts with our own hobby is sort of like focusing on those roleplayers
who like to "freak the mundanes" at cons and saying that they are typical of
gamers.

Even so, I know more than a few goths who would balk at being labelled
nihilistic. Some are quite bouncy and obnoxiously happy. Even among those
who aren\'t bouncy, nihilism is really pretty rare. Your average goth is
hopelessly romantic, and fascinated to some degree with all things mystical,
mythical and philosophical.

You don\'t have to trust me on this one. At one point in their life, most
goths will read, enjoy, and be influenced by the DC / Vertigo comic "The
Sandman". Head down to your local comic store and pick up one of the trade
paperback collections and tell me how nihilistic you think the series is. ;)

That\'s an awfully strange way of getting from point A to point B. I\'m
surprised that the "method acting" approach didn\'t come sooner, since
roleplaying games are frequently popular - with good reason -among high
school drama types. It was a direction that roleplaying games were bound to
go in eventually. I think that the origins of this style of roleplaying go
back quite a bit further, though. I\'ve been winding my way through the
Dragon Magazine archive, and I came across an old article by Gary Gygax
decrying the growing trend of gamers who were putting the playing of roles
above the "action".

Keep in mind there\'s always been a crossover of "dress up" types in
roleplaying fandom. The large SCA crossover, for example. I\'m really not
sold on the "growing up to fast" angle.

>>(which is  what most neo-Goth theme games encourage).


To some extent, yeah, but every game system encourages *some* sort of play
that others don\'t. The D&D line, for example, tends to encourage the dungeon
crawl. Traveller tends to encourage mercenary and merchant campaigns...
Every game brings *something* that is "unique" to the table.

I think that you\'re taking such concepts as scare factor, a dark atmosphere,
and anxiety *much* more seriously than the average Vampire player does.

The model one often goes to is the age of steamships, when it took
a lot longer to get anywhere.  IIRC, people didn\'t, in fact, take
short vacations to distant lands.  OTOH, it wasn\'t unheard of to
take months off (esp for the young after college) and take a "grand
tour".

That\'s alright, Chris, it was my fault. It was a
discussion that Jeff Zeitlin and I began a couple days
ago, which we thought could go onto the TML. My

Yes, and AD&D isn\'t supposed to be a dungeon crawl,
either. But when you\'re writing, you have to consider
not only what you write, but who\'s going to read it,
and how they\'ll interpret it.

Quite true, and for me that makes these settings a
problem - a "party" makes little sense (except perhaps
in Werewolf, where they\'re a "pack"). And I\'ve seen
that typically people do create such characters, which
then utterly fail to co-operate. I agree that we need
something better than "you meet in an inn and decide
to adventure together" to keep the group together,
some deeper reason, but I just don\'t see how it can
happen in the World of Darkness.

So why reinforce the troubles they already have?
better a game which encourages sociability,
co-operation, and so on. But perhaps I\'m thiking too
much of the "mentoring" aspects of GMing younger
players.

You\'re right, there. But some systems, some genres,
lend themselves more easily to that than others. Hands
up those who\'ve given up on, or never entered a Star
Wars game because they were overwhelmed by film quotes
and cliches?:)

No, it\'s a complete lack of an ideology - a nihilism,
or the pseudo-religion of armchair
self-psychoanalysis.

Certainly I don\'t think all World of Darkness players
are Goths. But you don\'t find many Goths playing
Traveller, that\'s for sure. 

Maybe we just have more depressed Goths Down Under?

By "method acting" we mean people becoming deeply
involved in their characters, to an almost
pathological degree. Taking themselves WAY too
seriously. I\'m not too sold on the "growing up too
fast" idea, either, not when so many are thirty years
old living with their parents and never held a steady
job types. Kids today, it seems to me, are learning
the hard stuff, drugs and violence, without learning
the more pleasant stuff - work, relationships
(committed).

The same reason one particular linguistic group of immigrants into
southwest US tended to replace l\'s with R\'s (an oriental population):
overcompensation. I actually have met two russions who overcompensate the
v/w difference in that very manner, and one chinese gent who did likewise
with r/l differentiation.

In essence, they worked real hard at the "American Sound they didn\'t know"
that they got it down, but since it was related to the other sound in
pronounciation that they lost track of which does what. Additionally, all
three individuals were dyslexic.

A similar mistake I\'ve encountered is some russian speakers are unwilling
to jotate [prounounced joe-tate] (add the leading "y" sound) to english
words, since they were told american english doesn\'t use jotation. For
reference, the word "you" jotates explicitly (due to the Y), but "ewe" has
implied jotation, as do "pleasure", "measure"; confusion occurs with
"-tion" ended words, too. Russian uses extensive jotation, and had rules
for dealing with normally jotated letters following certain letters that
preclude comfortable jotation.

a few series come to mind, for different reasons:
Anne McCaffrey\'s "Ship who..." (Ship who Sang, Ship who searched) series,
and the Freedom Series (Freedom\'s Landing, Freedom\'s Choice).

While the FSP of the ship series is NOT the imperium, it shares many
traits; additionaly, the BB ships make me think of about TL14 workarounds
and the IISS. The drive mechanism is (probably intentionally) left very
vague.

The Freedom series has jump lags, no FTL comm that I recall, and an aslan
like race that is VERY well presented (The Catteni). Again, no direct
measures, but it feels very gameable with traveller. And, alas, I know that
Anne McCaffrey knows some traveller gamers.

Another series, this time by Robert Aspirin, is the "Phule\'s" series
(Phule\'s Company, Phules Paradise). This series, humour based, shows some
lifts from traveller, like time dialation from misjumps, some form of "jump
drive", marines (the Legion), Regular Army types, and some other good bits.
I\'d put it about TL 13-15....

Yet another series: the Sten Series, by Cole and Bunch. This is a much more
"Epic Space Opera"... larger than life, full of action, with extensive
travel times, big fleets, and fighters.... but with a good look at the
roles of various types of space military personell. The Imperium here is
led by the "Eternal Emperor" (who is, in a way, truly eternal), who rules a
laizze-faire capitalist imperium by controlling the fuel source of choice.

How about checking the rules for "beast power" in "Wood, wind, steam, and

Are you referring to the letters, "Makeeznok" and "Tvordeeznok"?  Jotation
in russian is hard for me to understand becuase I don\'t fully understand
their rules for it.

<snip>

Vampire et al are my primary games, and I find myself disagreeing with
what has been said here on the list (although not with Chris in
particular).

Vampire can (like every RPG) be used in many different ways. I prefer to
run scenarios with intrigue, personal relations, and social conflicts.
Kind of like a soap opera, but with fangs. I find it refreshing to play
a game where the "objective" is seldom to kill your opponents, instead
discrediting them and so on.

I agree with the "tragic hero" idea somewhat, but that doesn\'t need to
hold true for every character in a game (although one or two characters
are usually played that way regardless). I would rather call Vampire a
game about morality. Which part of that concept (villain, hero) the
player characters take is up to the players/GM.

In particularly oppressive governments, this may not be considered a \'bad\' 
side effect.
It culls the work force of ineffectives.

Such government typically keep a tight rein on the media, so they don\'t 
worry about the bad press.

Furthermore, the character generation section in the back is a rehash of
Citizens of the Imperium, except that in my copy it\'s possibly one of the
most typo-ridden sections I\'ve seen in Traveller.  Like, for example, I 
think the Bureaucrat had the Barbarian skill tables -- or perhaps it was
the other way around....

Yeah.  I dunno -- I\'m not quite sure I can picture the 154th in SMC as rating
6-2-8 in the 5FW game.  :)

It was plenty readable. ;)

On the contrary, AD&D is supposed to work best for dungeon crawls.
Everything about the game, from the proliferation of underground beasties to
the party dynamic is aimed toward the dungeon crawl.

I also disagree that the makers of a game - or anything else for that
matter - have some sort of obligation to take possible misinterpretations
into account.

>Quite true, and for me that makes these settings a
>problem - a "party" makes little sense (except perhaps
>in Werewolf, where they\'re a "pack").

Let\'s face it, a party makes little sense in *most* roleplaying games, and a
GM, or the players, have to come up with all sorts of reasons why their
characters would be together in the first place. I remember when I first
bought MegaTraveller and saw all of the careers in the character generation
system I found it difficult to imagine building a party from such disparate
character types.

Whatever its other faults may be, AD&D does a wonderful job of this by
building character interdependence into the rules. Traveller does it by way
of background. One of the reasons that merchant and mercenary campaigns are
so popular in travel is that the background props up such games. Vampire
takes a little from column A and a little from column B. The clans play off
of each other mechanically, and they fit into certain roles within a party.
The background is also rich enough that reasons for getting parties together
grow out of this.

The dirty little secret of roleplaying games is that the real reason for a
party in any game is that a bunch of friends get together around a table and
choose to spend their time playing a game. Whether this is supported in the
game by the rules or background doesn\'t matter.

Still, to get back around to your original point, although the essence of
the game is the tragedy inherent in the isolation of the characters -
usually from mortal society, but frequently from vampiric (or supernatural
society) as well - the characters all share that same alienation. To say
that folks in such situations can\'t band together on some level, even if
it\'s simply a result of their alienation, is to deny that a group of
alienated kids would sit around a table and roleplay in the first place.

>And I\'ve seen

Well, to be fair, the Storyteller System is rich with possibilities. There
are so many levels of supernatural conpiracy going at any given time that
it\'s not really all that difficult to come up with reasons for why the
party\'s together.

Of course, as I pointed out above, the real reason that a party forms is
that you\'ve got a bunch of friends sitting around a table in real life. I
don\'t think that a game even requires that the party has a "reason" for
being together.

>So why reinforce the troubles they already have?


Who says it reinforces anything? I don\'t like reading to much into what a
game might possibly "reinforce". After all, if we were to dissect Traveller
with the same scalpel, we might not find things that are all that pleasant.
If we simply focus on the popular mercenary-style campaigns, we find a
setting that seems to reinforce doing really nasty and distasteful things -
like punching holes in people with a gauss rifle - for the purpose of
profit.

Still, I\'m not really in agreement with the idea that games reinforce
behavior. Once you open that floodgate, you drown the entire roleplaying
industry and you admit that every media slander against roleplaying, every
negative stereotype, and groups like Mothers Against Dungeons & Dragons are
all *right*.

I think that you are thinking too much of the "mentoring" aspects of GMing
younger players. You seem to have an interest in younger players, I advise
that you get out and try to understand what the world looks like from their
point of view. With all due respect, you seem to have some misunderstandings
about it already, and I sincerely don\'t mean that as an insult.

Perhaps, but across the board from RPG fandom there are all too frequent
criticisms of the way that the two top games are "played wrong", or played
in a way that to others is essentially "hollow" in some way. I do think that
if T5 came out tomorrow and that through some stroke of divine providence it
found itself as one of the top games we\'d find the same kind of collapse
into cliches and the same breakdown into mindless slaughter.

Having been on the list long enough, I\'ve seen enough  anecdotal evidence
that lots of Traveller games do break down into one (or both) of those
camps. It\'s something that the industry is extremely self-conscious of, but
which is ultimately detrimental to the hobby as a whole.

>No, it\'s a complete lack of an ideology - a nihilism,
>or the pseudo-religion of armchair
>self-psychoanalysis.


Well, no, it\'s not really either of the above. The Storyteller System may
posture itself in a certain way with some degree of "self help" talk, to
attach that same concept to a larger movement borders on absurdity. It\'s
just simply not true of the larger movement. Goth is not the complete lack
of ideology any more than the romantic movement in art, literature and
philsophy was. I can hit my record collection, or my book collection and
come up with an astonishing amount of information to support my claim. Don\'t
take my word for it, though, if you don\'t believe me, do your own research.

>Certainly I don\'t think all World of Darkness players
>are Goths. But you don\'t find many Goths playing
>Traveller, that\'s for sure.


I think you may be surprised. I know that fully half of my gaming group were
goths, and nearly all of the members of my gaming group have some sort of
direct connection with the scene.

>Maybe we just have more depressed Goths Down Under?


Probably not *different* goths, if the movement looks anything like the way
it looks in the U.S. and Britain, and I\'m betting that barring minor
differences it does. I\'m not saying that goths aren\'t depressed or that
those who aren\'t don\'t appear that way. I\'m saying that the depression or
the affect of depression doesn\'t flow from the wellspring of nihilism.

If you just think about it for a moment, you\'ll see why I\'m saying that.
What\'s there to be depressed about if you don\'t believe in anything?

In reality, there are things that pop-up time and time again in the goth
movement. Interpersonal relationships, or, to put a fine point on it, "love"
is the backbone of the goth movement. The word "love" is probably the most
often repeated in goth songs. The concept of love is at the center of much
of the literature.

There\'s also the religious paradox. Despite the fact that most goths reject
traditional religion, and many reject non-traditional religions, Christian
(and specifically Catholic) imagery, symbolism and trappings are central to
the movement. Even when religions are attacked in, say, music, it\'s usually
the perceived insincerity of religious institutions that is criticized.

The closely linked industrial movement frequently deals with politics and
economy. I\'m already way off topic here though.

>By "method acting" we mean people becoming deeply
>involved in their characters, to an almost
>pathological degree. Taking themselves WAY too
>seriously.

Perhaps, but have you considered the distinct possibility that *you\'re*
taking *them* too seriously? Or that, in point of fact, there are folks who
find that to be more fun than, say, the more traditional concept of
roleplaying as rolling dice and deciding what combat your characters are
going to get into next, or trying to figure out how much money you\'re going
to make when you unload your cargo of groat\'s milk at the next port, or how
much gold you\'re going to snatch up from the third level of the dungeon?

That is, of course, if you think of "work" and "committed relationships" as
"the more pleasant stuff". When I say that, I say that with the utmost
seriousness. Adam Smith, a central figure in the development of the
capitalist ideology *didn\'t* share the same opinion of "work". Of course,
"work" today is a really loaded term, it encompasses those things that are
"jobs" (and I don\'t see why any kid should think of flipping beef patties at
McDonald\'s as pleasant), "careers" (which are rapidly being phased out in
America and other parts of the West), and "callings" (I don\'t mean that in
the religious sense either, still, they are tough to come by these days).

Committed relationships... well, of course, let\'s just say that they\'re not
what they used to be. In the Western world, we\'re living in a society where
therapists spit on love by calling it "co-dependence" and equate it with an
addiction, while schizophrenically holding onto an ideal that true love wins
out over all.

Boy, with such competing viewpoints, is it any wonder that so many Western
relationships are doomed to failure?

Still, in order to really do a fair treatment of that subject, I\'d have to
go back over the course of 200 - 250 years to find the root of the problem,
and I simply can\'t justify the use of such bandwidth. In this case, I\'ll
simply point you to "After Virtue" by MacIntyre, which deals with the
general erosion of morality and ethics in modernity[1], and "Habits of the
Heart" by Bellah et. al. which concerns itself specifically with seeing how
the problems of modernity[1] manifest themselves in American life. Both are
excellent books, and I highly recommend them.

[1] Modernity in this sense is not used to describe "today" but to describe
the Enlightenment and post-Enlightenment trends.

It\'s a Hollywoodism.   I speak a bit of Russian, and have been told that I don\'t \'sound Russian\' when I do, except to native Russian speakers, who tell me I sound like a 4 year old from Leningrad.  <grin>  FWIW, my grandparents (from Leningrad, btw) died when I was 4.

	My take on this (from a strictly CT background) is that
	a damper might have this effect at point blank range, but
	in typical combat it would not be effective. This would,
	of course, assume that the damper is directional. If not,
	the vessel with the damper would have it\'s power plant
	affected. If it could shield it\'s power plant in some way,
	presumably that option would be available to the other
	ship (unless it involved some sort of synchronization
	of fields between the damper and the power plant that
	could only be achieved on the same vessel). Personally,
	I would avoid this can or worms.

While I agree that in reality you\'re right, it\'s a Hollywoodism, in
another sense it\'s a reasonable imitation of a Ukrainian (not Russian)
accent.  To the extent anything in ST is reasonable.

Okay, the more I think about it, it\'s all ridiculous.  What-EVER!

For the most part, tiny.  Grains of sand to pebbles.  The density is pretty
low also.  A couple of our probes have flown through Saturn\'s rings with
damage, IIRC.

Sounds great!

     I am supprised no one has mentioned Hammers Slammers by Drake. Good story
about hovertanks and the like. The "Legion" series by William H. Keith did a
good job of showing what a company sized unit armed with combat armor and gauss
rifles could do.

     I also HIGHLY recommend the two novels "Semper Mars" and "Lunar Marine"
both by William Keith under the pseudonym Ian Douglas. It is a good near future
tech level 8-9 story about what amounts to mankind\'s first "space war". Almost
like a Tom Clancy in Space adventure. The Third part of the story is due out in
June of 99. It\'s going to be a long wait.

Also check out Warriors of Spider, Way of Spider, and Web of Spider. Can\'t
recall the author, but I think that those are all of the series, although I
can\'t recall the order. Not totally Traveller, but has some neat stuff.

Were his books written in inspiration of Traveller?  The entire series
seems
to fit regular \'canon\' classic traveller perfectly.  Most of the
things
mentioned in the LBB\'s can be found in his novels with the same names.

Gateway to the Stars, by Pierce Askegren. I think he is a prof. 
writer-for-hire with a curricula of books written for Avengers, 
spiderman, and things like that. There were no other books, AFAIK.

Thanks Mark.  I had wondered.  I experienced Traveller before I read the
series so I had always wondered.  I suppose if a game needs to be based on a
series, you couldn\'t complain about it being the Dumarest saga as they were
well written and a lot of fun to read.

IMTU, as part of the Mark system\'s Centennial Celebration a sail race
is taking place. The race is from mainworld orbit to an asteroid in
the belt, around a marker there, across the belt to a second marker,
then out to a gas giant where they slingshot to a second gas giant
further out. A final slingshot and the ships sail back in to orbit
around the mainworld. The winner is the first ship that successfully
docks with the christmas tree back at the UpPort. (IOW, getting back
fast is great, but you have to decelerate and dock at the end of the
flight.)  The contestants aren\'t allowed any navigational equipment
beyond handheld astrolabes, and all maneuvering is down by setting
lines on the sails. Support and media ships are traveling along with
the contestants to rescue anyone that gets in serious trouble.

The PC\'s passed the race on it\'s outbound leg as they entered the
system a couple weeks ago. They\'ll probably pass it again on their way
out, as it will be near their route from Mark to the Segui jump point.
If *nothing* else it provides some local color. <g>

Thanks to the "kindness" of Jo Grant, I got to read this last year.  If I
may paraphrase my classical Chinese instructor (speaking about something
else), "This is the worst book from hell I could ever possibly imagine,
ever."

I don\'t think asteroids are ever close enough to one
another to be particularly hazardous.  If I recall
correctly, the closest that asteroids in our solar
system come to one another is something like 1,000,000
km.  

Maybe a race through the rings of a Saturn-like gas
giant would give the flavor you\'re describing.  I
remember some quite spectactular pictures from an
unmanned probe a few years ago, showing all sorts of
fluid motion of various-sized ice particles (included
braiding) in the rings.

Ee kratkoyih (yih) is jotated. Easiest check for a jotated vowel: when

NB: Yat and Ih are from Pre-communist russian. Ih and Yat also are always
lower case. \'ee is a sound foreign to most non-slavik speakers; sort of an
ee, but you produce it back in the throat with a wierd tongue position...
it is modern, and combosed of 2 separate figures treated as a single
letter. For those who speak modern russian, the yat seems to be pronounced
to rymhe with bat, not yacht.

I\'ve run into something like that in a story. Complete with rumors that
sometimes they "seeded" the foam with some sort of insects that would
burrow thru it looking for the "free lunch". Our hero is embedded in
the stuff and keeps remembering those rumors every time he gets an itch
or a twinge. Of course the government wouldn\'t do that... Would they?

That foam, plus the rumors, ought to have PCs getting kinda paranoid if
they get foamed. :-)

The original title of the book was "Make Room, Make Room" and it\'s by
Harry Harrison. I\'ve never read it, so I can\'t help much with the gizmo
you describe. My best guess is that you toss them in the crowd after
doing something that\'ll make the tie snap.

They\'ve flown thru one of the *gaps* in the rings. 

And last I heard, Saturn\'s rings were thought to still be capable of

Asteroid belts aren\'t like in the movies. Except for the occasional
double or triple asteroid (asteroids orbiting each other), you\'d need a
telescope to see one asteroid from another. 

Work out the math. The main belt is centered at about 2.5 AU. Let\'s
assume all the asteroids are in the plane of the ecliptic, and within
.5 AU of the 2.5 AU mark. That gives us a flat ring from 2.0 AU to 3.0
AU. That gives an area of 15.7 AU^2 or 353 *quadrillion* km^2.

Assume there are a *million* asteroids of size worth worrying about.
That means each has (on average) 353 billion km^2 to wander around in.
Which makes their average seperation about 594,000 km.

In the real world, there are only about 10,000 asteroids of that size
(1/100th as many) which means they are *ten* times as far apart. About
6 million km.

But a race of the "you have to make contact with these asteroids, in
any order" sort could still be interesting, simply because of the way
the orbital dynamics work.

A good way to get a "feel" for this sort of thing is to try to find a
copy of the old SPI "Battlefleet Mars" game. It\'s got a map of the
inner Solar System, with the planetary orbits divided into one day
chunks. So each "day" of play, you move the planet counters one space
along their orbits. 

It\'s also got rules for figuring ship trajectories between the planets.

I\'d advise refs that plan "in system" adventures that cover multiple
planets, or have the players frequently visiting the same system, to
draw up such a map. It can make keeping track of where things are
easier. 

Some day, I\'ll write a program to do that sort of thing. If I\'m feeling
ambitious, I\'ll even try to port it to the Mac.

Note:
IMTU, the Imperium has a list of defined pronunciations for all
Imperial Systems, Planets and even Starports. These pronunciations
are encoded into every starship Library program, with the intent
to forestall confusion in the giving of orders to military units.
These defined pronunciations are matched up with defined spellings
and locations, so an Admiral should never order his Commodore to
set course for Algine and end up heading for Elgin.

Of course, this doesn\'t stop people from having their own names,
slang terms and pronunciations for the planets they live on and
such. It\'s not unusual for the use-names to vary from the 
"official names", though the two usually were once the same.
The "official name" tends to get stuck, frozen in bureacracy and
exact audio recordings, while the use-name varies, but any Navy,
Scout or Merchant officer should know the official version.
It would be better, of course, to know both.

OK, here goes.  As far as I know, my take on this doesn\'t contradict any
Classic Traveller canon (except the article). I totally ignore IRIS, as
that was a variant (according to the original IRIS article). Besides, I
think the whole idea of IRIS as presented was silly.

Imperial law is fairly narrow, and not particularly concerned about
individuals. Remember, the Imperium sanctions _wars_. Philosophically, I
see the Imperium as concerned with "peace, order, and good government" on
the broadest scale. Justice is not particularly an issue. If the planet
Barghest conquers the planet Fretgan in a short, sharp war the local
Imperial representative may well let it stand. If Tukera sabotages the
players\' free trader during a tradewar, the Imperium isn\'t particularly
bothered.

Imperial courts are inquisitorial, not adversarial. The judge takes an
active role, with an emphasis on discovering the truth. He may ask
questions, direct investigations, and so forth.

The judge is always a noble: although the judge is technically the Imperial
noble in who\'s fief the crime took place, he often deligates his authority
to another noble. Respected commoner jurists are ennobled for this task,
and retain their noble rank after retirement (although these titles are not
hereditary). Training in the law is _not_ required for Imperial justices;
what _is_ required is a tenacious ability to uncover the truth coupled with
an incorruptible nature.

Prosecuting and defense counsels are usually present. Their task is to
present information and to ensure that the law is followed. Unlike American
practice, a counsel is forbidden to misrepresent the fact,  In particular,
if a defense counsel knows, or has good reason to believe, that his client
is guilty then he may not plead innocence. (Mitigating circumstances, pleas
for leniency, and so forth are perfectly in order.)

Precedent is not legally binding, although it is usually used as a
guideline. The emphasis is always on the _intent_ of the law, rather than
exact wording. This results in some inequities, although it closes many
loopholes.

Appeals may always be made to the noble\'s leige lord, including up the
chain to the Emperor.  The higher noble is under no obligation to hear the
case; indeed, most appeals are denied. (The operative philosophy is
"promote good men and trust their judgement.")

Costs are born by the plaintifs, not the Imperium. This disadvantages
poorer individuals. Mitigating against this is the inquisitorial nature of
the court: the costs of any investigations ordered by the judge are born by
the judge (part of the cost of running a noble court), and as the judge is
after the truth a poor defendant _or_ prosecutor needs merely to convince
the judge that the investigation is critical to uncovering a relevant fact.

On that note, charges in an Imperial court are brought not by the Imperium
but by individuals. This means that theoretically the players could
prosecute a Tukera executive for treason. This is a rare event, as the
consequences of bringing a frivolous charge are severe, and are born by the
individual bringing the charge.  If an organization wishes to lay a charge
then a member of that organization must do so as an individual.

A noble may demand a trial by his peers, in which case a jury is assembled:
the nobles in this jury must be of equal rank, the judge must be of a
higher rank. The judge still directs the investigation, and the jury may
ask questions and request investigations (although the judge may decide
that the investigation is not warranted). The jury is chosen by the judge;
although custom dictates that the closest nobles who can attend will make
up the jury this is not always followed.



The Ministry of Justice is not, as described in the Challenge 50 article,
an interstellar FBI. (For one thing, add up the number of agents required
to have one per 100,000 people, then add in the support staff. Yikes.)

IMTU, the Ministries are a counterpoise between the nobility and the
megacorporations. The Emperor balances this triad. The Ministries are a
tool for doing what is necessary for the gopod of the Imperium, yet falls
outside the purview of the nobility and is not profitable enough for the
megacorporations. In a sense the Ministries are a bureaucratic equivalent
to the Imperial Services.

The Ministry of Justice is concerned with enforcing Imperial laws and
regulations. They deal only with matters that affect the Imperium, and only
when those matters are not being handled by another body. Thus, the
supression of piracy is a Navy duty, while an MoJ agent will be more
concerned with tracking down how the pirates are able to operate (ie. which
world is providing covert support). While MoJ agents have broad powers they
have little in the way of force. If force is required the Navy is brought
in.


Imperial laws are, as I said before, mostly concerned with preserving the
Imperium. As such they are more concerned with subsectors than individuals.
Actions count for all, motivations for nothing. (Mitigating circumstances
and mistakes are used as reasons for leniency, but there is not
_requirement_ for leniency. A man who accidentally kills a Duke may be
executed for treason, although if the judge\'s investigation shows that it
was a genuine accident then he may well not be punished at all.)


Imperial crimes are:

Treason. This, technically, includes refusing an order of the Emperor (or
an Imperial Warrant-holder), or killing a leige-sworn noble acting in His
name.  Comes in different flavours, from High to Common, depending on the
offense and circumstances.

Piracy. This is restraint-of-trade by force. Note that while tradewar is an
accepted safety valve there is no legal level, merely custom, and that a
corporate officer who declares a tradewar runs the risk of being personally
charged if it goes too far. (Which leads to lots of nice subplots ablout
dead men and tales...)

War. This is, generally, conquest at the interstellar level. In general the
Imperium allows low-intensity conflicts to continue as long as they do not
endanger those outside the combat area, and those inside are allowed to
leave. (Note that "allowed to leave" doesn\'t mean "free transportation".)
While an invasion is technically illegal, a short sharp invasion will often
be left to stand by the Imperium, if the Imperial judge views it as
increasing the long-term order of a subsector.

Devastation. This is destroying a significant planetary asset of value to
the Imperium. Rarely used.

Slavery. Actual chattel slavery is forbidden. Indentured servitude is not,
but indentures are not transferred to offspring. (Good plot hook: players
are on a world where indentured servitude is common. Someone throws them a
baby, hoping that they will take it offworld before it runs up a debt for
clothing, schooling, food... What do the players do?)

Imperial Trespass. Violating an interdiction, trespassing on an Imperial
base, and so forth.


There are also a great number of Imperial Regulations covering licensing
for starships, safety requirements for Imperial Ports, and so on. I usually
invent these as necessary, under the principle that the Imperium regulates
in the interests of promoting order and trade. Imperial Ministries don\'t
have enough staff to enforce complete complience, and usually rely on
planetary governments for most of the enforcement work. (For example, most
starship safety inspectors are actually part of a planetary government, not
an Imperial body.)

Technological restrictions are covered by Imperial regulations.



There\'s more, but this is getting long and I still have two tests to set.
Let me know if you want more.

This is why today\'s military talks in terms of UTM coordinates instead of
place names.

There must be some unambiguous coodinate system for the 3I to describe
locations in space with precision, but I have no idea what it is. I assume
that the paths of stars as they move through a galaxy are different enough
to cause difficulties in using them for reference points. A more difficult
problem (perhaps?) is to precisely describe a location on an arbitrary
planet. UTM coordinates are tailored to the Earth. If you need accuracies
down to the centimeter or even the meter, say for accurately targeting
artillery, you need a very precise way to describe where the observer, the
target, and the gun are.

Imagine the difficulties in accurately calculating firing data on some
worlds. When I went to gunnery school years ago at Ft. Sill, we learned how
to calculate corrections for a wide range of errors: those caused by the
spinning round drifting to one side, those caused by the different wind
speeds at different elevations, and even for the Earth rotating under the
shell while it\'s in the air. You will need lots of local data to make
gunnery precise on arbitrary planets from these factors and others. I assume
that the Imperial Marines have come up with a solution, however.

Not really connected to how to pronounce system names, was it?

A great series up until the last book. I mean, the Empire has run perfectly
well for thousands of years, and then Sten decides to destroy the whole
basis of the Empire the first time there is a major problem rather than fix
the problem. What, the six months to a couple of years it would have taken
for the new clone to form was too long?

Another possibility, though one done to death recently in movies: the
altered reality the PCs find themselves in is a virtual reality sim --
or was it the one they remember *before* the change??? Again from my
supers game, one scenario had the heroes finally penetrate the inner
sanctum of the entity pulling the strings behind the conspiracy. A huge
battle follows, at the end of which only one PC is left standing, and
him just barely. As soon as he hits the exit, he sees the words

GAME OVER

appear in mid-air -- then all the PCs wake up in the lab, having just come
out of a VR sim in which they played a group of super-heroes, with Omnitech
(the evil company behind the conspiracy) being their employer. (It turned
out that everything past the point where they went into the lower levels
of the Omnitech building to meet the evil entity running the show was the
actual VR sim -- the PCs had to figure their way out of it by themselves.
this *could* be done in a Traveller setting...

Of course, Mark, you\'re right, but I assumed we were
talking about non-lethal ways to supress riots? After
all, if you don\'t care about lives of "rebels" or bad
press, you will use _lethal_ means to suppress the
peasantry (just look at Chechnya today). More
democratic governments are the ones doing research
into such things, since they have scruples and the
poeple have long memories; at the same time as the
British invented rubber bullets, the Germans invented
Zyklon B, and thirty years after Kent State, we still
remember. But do the Russians remember Vorkuta?

Very true, Jens. But I don\'t think any of us are
saying the games _have_ to be depressing and weird,
merely that the structure of the game, the tone of the
writing in the texts, mean they\'ll tend to be done
that way. I eman, nowhere in AD&D Player\'s Guide does
it say, "you are only allowed to do dungeon crawls."
You can have a D&D character who never slays anything;
he\'ll just go up levels rather slowly, is all.

The problem being that the "tragic hero" is a loner...
how does the traditional "party" work then?

Glad to hear the games work for you; I just can\'t
imagine how, but perhaps that reveals more about me,
than the game?

Yeah, but a cliche like that is great... *especially* since you can stand
that one up on its head through some clever manipulation.

The players *think* that their characters are in a simulation, but through
some means they discover (perhaps incorrectly) that they aren\'t actually in
a simulation anymore...

    Well, for me it is any form of Speed Metal, Heavy Metal, Celtic Rock,
Blues, Ray Stevens etc.
    Speed Metal for Small Scale Ship-to-Ship Combat, as I tend to use very
close ranges, short rounds, & high damage.  As I tend to run a game with
more than one ship.  (Right now they have a pair of Far Traders, a Patrol
Cruiser, & a Scout.  Yes, I know it is kinda munchie, but I do use TNEs
rules for gaining ships in a CT/MT universe.)
    Heavy Metal for Large Scale Ship-to-Ship Combat & ground combat.
    Blues, Celtic Rock, Ray Stevens for mood music.
    Etc, well that depends upon the band in the bar.  *weg*

Yes, stars do move, but they typically move with a
velocity of something like 300 km/sec, which is faster
than you can run, but still slow year-to-year. At that
speed, it would take a 3,250 years for a star to be a
parsec away from where it was. I always assumed this
was the reason that starships came out of jump far
from the target system, in case it have moved since
they were last there! And that this was a good side
effect of being able to jump only 1-6 parsecs at a
time, along your way somewhere you could stop, have a
look around and adjust your aim for the next jump.

Well, when I was in the infantry, maybe our armies
Down Under aren\'t such good shots, but we used to have
spotters who\'d say, fire on this spot, and then adjust
the gunner\'s aim for them. As for co-ordinates, you
can just do what the IAU has done and choose an
abitrary crater or mountain on a world as "greenwich
meridian", and of course the equator and poles are
easy to put on the map... The only difficulty would be
on worlds with frequently changing features, such as
Europa or Io, but hopefully there\'d be not too many
battles on such worlds...

I agree.  And the authors tried to explain it away at the end, "We 
wanted to show why an empire like this wouldn\'t work."  I failed to 
see their logic.  It appeared to be working ok as far as I could tell.

Consider the difficulties is computing exact coordinates for a jump. Even a
little relative motion makes a big error over a few parsecs. The
navigational data required to perform accurate jumps must be both very
extensive as well as very precise.

The problem with adjusting fire is that you don\'t get many first round hits.
When you are fighting a sophisticated adversary with meaningful
counter-battery capability, this really matters. That\'s why the US Army does
the "shoot and scoot." Even with TL8 technology it is possible to have
counter-battery fire on the way before the first round impacts. (Probably
only for high-angle fire.)

Do you suppose that the 3I still uses Napoleon\'s system for gunnery?

With the other worlds, I would expect that the varying degrees of deviation
from a sphere for the shape of the planet may make a nice, clean. accurate
coordinate system difficult to devise.

Yeah, but a cliche like that is great... *especially* since you can stand

I recall an American _Dirty Pair_ comic where the heroes are having
their annual(?) review by their employer, and it\'s occuring in
sim. The heroes gradually find out that their opponent in the 
simulation is another real person, and that he is "hacking" the sim
to gain Very Dangerous Access to a Very Important Computer.
If they don\'t defeat him in sim, he takes over in real life...and the
heroes start to think that maybe they can really die in this
sim. For the clincher, even at the end we aren\'t sure if the danger -
both of the bad guy taking over the universe, and of actual physical
harm - was real, or just a particularly effective simulation.

"Sim Hell", I believe it was called. Excellent, especially for the
history bits on Earth\'s "nanoclysm" (nanotech disaster that forced
the space colonies into self-sufficiency).

Earl Dumarest apperas as one of the "mystery" NPC\'s in the back of one of
the early LBBs, so maybe Marc denies it, but _someone_ writing Traveller had
certainly read the books.


To add a few other authors :

The obvious "Flandry" series by Poul Andersen

And for military stuff, David Drake\'s "Hammer\'s Slammer\'s" series.

Alhough actually, originally it _was_ supposed to be a dungeon crawl,
"wilderness adventures" didn\'t appear until the supplements.

Which is a valid choice. It also makes a good game, because as they fail to
co-operate they lose agaist the better NPC\'s, and slowly start learning that
to win they _need_ to co-operate. (Which is also the theme of many of these
"lonely, embittered hero" films as well.

BTW, Traveller is no better at generating parties than any other game, I\'ve
seen just as many "loners" in Trav games as in others. Heck, having the
Scout Service practically guarantees such types.

Pretty simple really, get good roleplayers who will design characters that
fit together.
Nothing to do with the system, or even the genre, everything to do with the
players.

You\'re thinking too much of being a "responsible adult"
Play the game for fun instead.Let them have fun.
_All_ games encourage sociability and co-operation, if only to succesfully
beat your opponent into a pulp.

That\'s the whole _point_ of that game.
What\'s wrong with it ?

Though it\'s quite possible to play SW games that have none of that.

Try playing Rebel Special Forces. Even more Traveller than Traveller.

You don\'t find many of _any_ social group playing Traveller, and I know at

Heck he\'s also the only goth that plays in the local VtM LARP, the rest of
the players , while many are certainly fringe types, don\'t usually go for
that scene. There does seem to be a higher than average  number of  women
with nipple piercings involved though...

Argon ; this decay chain is what keeps the insides of the Earth molten
(K-40 is relatively common). The ratio of K:Ar is also determined when
dating geological specimens.

Argon is anaesthetic in very large concentrations (but you would need a
hyperbaric chamber).

Neurotransmitters are amino acid derivatives, or proteins for the most
part (the obvious exceptions being adenosine and nitric oxide). No
potassium contained therein.

I\'m not sure how you\'re defining \'"voluntary" muscles\'.
All the muscle relaxants that are in current clinical use interfere with
the propagation of nerve impulses at the neuromuscular junction of
skeletal (striated) muscle, leading to the predictable onset of \'flaccid
paralysis\'.
	The information I posted previously, stands. The diaphragm and chest
wall are composed, and perform, as described.
	Some of the older members of this class do have cardiac effects via the
autonomic nervous system (curare, pancuronium, succinyl dicholine).
	
> Mind you, I seem to recall that they do this by blocking nerve
> impulses from the spine, rather than by directly affecting the muscles...
	This was correct with a class of drugs referred to as ganglion
blockers, the only useful member of which was decamethonium, which is
only available in the dusty cupboards of established research labs.
	Curare has been available since the 1500s and was only used clinically
really from the mid 1940s ; the various derivatives have appeared over
the ensuing years. Succinyl dicholine became available in the
early 1950s. The ganglion blockers enjoyed a brief period of use in the
mid 50\'s - early 60\'s.

IMHO, \'Spasm\' makes a lousy incapacitant, regardless of the \'sphere of
operations\'. The method of delivery is neither here nor there.
	My apologies ; you mentioned \'Spasm\' as ammo for spetsdods after the
quote on the riot in the \'Matador\' series by Steve Perry.

Sounds like an overdose of any of the antihypertensives. Delivery is a
problem in the \'riot control context\'.
	Strokes, myocardial infarction, renal failure, gut necrosis... real
potential for unwanted damage here. The vagaries of individual and
species variation have been commented on by other posters.

This is done every day with local anaesthetic and narcotic delivered
into the epidural or subarachnoid space, in a highly controlled fashion.
	Again, if we overlook the problems of delivering our agent to the right
spot, we run into a few little problems as the block rises :-
	injury secondary to falling over ;
	lethal falls in blood pressure secondary to loss of peripheral vascular
resistance ;
	aberrant cardiac rhythms ;
	paralysis of the diaphragm (the last of the \'chest\' muscles to succumb,
due to its innervation) ; and
	brainstem paralysis - with a total loss of control of blood pressure,
heart rate, vascular volume, and respiratory sensing and function. This
is a state indistinguishable from \'brain death\', unless you can
demonstrate that the cerebrum is being perfused or otherwise works (e.g.
EEG/SPECT scanning).

I\'m currently playing in an AD&D campaign as a  thief  (or  as  I
prefer to call him: a  "socialist dungeon scout").  In  the  four
sessions so far I haven\'t killed or stolen anything, and I *have*
advanced just as fast as the other PCs.

Of course the other PCs do get upset from time  to  time  ...  we
were trapped in a fort surrounded by lizardmen and the other  PCs
were preparing for "Remember the Alamo", when  I  snuck  out  and
traded with the lizardmen and accidentally got a truce which  led
to a peace deal.

ObTrav: Er ... the GM (DM or Referee) shapes a campaign over  the
*long term* by \'controlling\' the rewards and penalties.  If  your
group is in hack-n-slash mode then  look  at  the  GM\'ing  style.
This applies to any RPG.

Today (Friday, 19/11/1999) will be the last day that has all  odd

seen the last \'odd digit day\' in your lifetime, and for approx 37

raise a glass today, and celebrate the \'Last Odd Digit  Day\'  for
1111 years.

Cheers!!

Okay, okay, ObTrav: Are 3I populations affected by \'date madness\'
near pseudo-significant dates (the CT OTU \'starts\' only  5  years
after 1100) and think the world will  end,  etc?  Any  crack-pots
acting up on 111-1111?  And was there a 3I-wide Y2K-like computer
problem in 1000?

The last couple of times we\'ve played I have used the CD-ROM from the game
Half-Life. Some of the tracks have a real cool techno style beat, while some
others are more of a slow, spooky, spacey background music kinda track. I did
see the MP3 files available for download a while ago but don\'t remember where
it was.

Yesterday I saw a CD at Tower titled something like "Y2K: Music for the
Apocolypse"  Had all these great gloom and doom classical and neo classical
pieces.  "Mars: the Bringer of War", "Battle on the Ice" for Alexander
Nevsky, "Battle Theme" from Star Wars.  Couldn\'t afford it (I was picking
up Kansas\' Best of album), but I\'ll be back next week.

One of the last really good eps, IMHO.

What grabs people\'s attention? Struggle.  Everytime I\'ve flown in a
passenger jet, I\'ve been higher than the summit of Mt. Everest, yet I\'m
fascinated by the people who climb it.  There was a bit in an old Niven
story "Elephant", were Beowulf Shaffer was visiting Earth, and saw people
racing old autos on a stretch of freeway.  His reaction when he realized
that the cars had neither radar nor autopilot..

Earlier this year the lead story on the news was that two guys in a baloon
had manged to fly around the world.  Hardly cutting edge tech, but it was
the struggle to do it with what is "primative" tech that made it interesting.

The same will hold true for our theoretical solar/mag sail racers.. The
promoters of the race circut will emphasis the hands-on nature of the
event, with on-board cameras showing racers making furious scribbled
calculations and shooting azmuths.

Kyle,

Last year about this time we went through a huge number of posts on 
this very topic.  You might want to scour through the archives, where 
you can find some wonderful suggestions.  Or, if we\'re lucky, someone 
may have compiled all the entries into a list that they wouldn\'t mind 
releasing to the list.  *hint, hint*

I really think that, once a list is created, we should add it to the 
FAQ, along with the suggested Travelleresque reading.  But that\'s my 
opinion.  YMMV.

Enjoy,
Jason

On another note, I would like to ask the gang here what their experiences
have been buying from Amazon.com?  I purchased "Age of Empires 2" at their
site almost a month ago and they agreed to ship it within 3-7 days.  As you
can probably tell, the wait time has far exceeded that.

I have emailed them several times inquiring as to where my purchased
software is and they have chosen to ignore me.  By looking at my credit card
statement, I find a clear record of the completed transaction.

Which leads me to my second question :  What are my rights in this case?  Is
there anyway I can make then uphold their end of the bargain or am I just
SOL?

What was the URL for the "Traveller Player List" that was compiled a month or
so ago? Does anyone remember? That would be a good place to start. Kind of cool
to think ours names could be used in each others games as NPCs.

That\'s just plain evil. Which is of course why it\'s worth doing. In the 
sim adventure I pulled on the PCs in the Champions game, mentioned
earlier in this thread, one of the players immediately recognized what
I was trying to do -- and had his character insist that what they were
being told by their "bosses" was the truth, and that their lives as
superheroes were just in a game. And his arguments to support that
viewpoint were very convincing... :)

And your police band radios, walkie-talkies, cell phones, electronic
ignitions in the police cars, the phone systems in the surrounding
buildings, the computer networks in the surrounding buildings, phone and
computer system that happen to be connected via land lines passing
through the area.

Megaphones are typically analog, high voltage devices...an emp blast
strong enough to take our a megaphone from a distance that the blast
simply won\'t take out the megaphone-er directly is going to have a
_huge_ area of effect.

If the cops have smartguns that only _they_ can fire, if they\'re
electronic, no one can fire \'em.

EMP is sort of like CBW...you have to really be careful or it\'ll bite
you on the a**. Much more useful to drop it from a higher altitude and
scoot. Then again, if you\'re nuking them from orbit, the megaphone
doesn\'t really matter, does it ;-)

MY favorite toy from that show is the little remote-controlled
car-killer thingee. :-) Wonder if you have to look like Gene Simmons for
it to work right, though...

If they charged your card and didn\'t deliver the goods, then you should be
able to contest the charge. Contact your credit card folks. You need to
put the dispute in writing to make it really stick.

I\'ve never bought software from them, but I bought an Eminem CD and one of
those relationship books from them and got my order within 3 days when
they said one week, so I would take it up with them.  I hope you printed
out your order confirmation.  That and your credit card statement should
help you.

What you can do in this situation is tell your credit card company and let
THEM handle it if there is no response.  They usually are pretty good
about this.

    'body' => 'Hello folks,

After collecting lots of ideas for gritty, X-files like scenarios, I
was drawn to the mysteries which were used in Traveller to
provide a type of background environment, or overarching
enigmas or pushes... real big, hazy carrots floating in the Traveller
background to make players go "hmmm" and wonder if there\'s
any rhyme or reason to it all.

Reflection brought out several concepts, including
1) The Ancients
2) The 5th Frontier War
3) The Rebellion, sort of
4) Longbow
5) Jumpstart
6) Empress Wave
7) Black Curtain
8) "The Boy" (remember?)

These are grand mysteries that add yet another layer of depth
to the Traveller background; they fill an aching gap between the
Mystery Of The Universe itself and the Mystery Of The Day,
which is embodied in current campaign goals.

Of course, these meta-stories are played out and terminate, but
they are slow and not generally the prime focus of the players,
because they\'re literally too big to tackle (some are bigger than
others, but they all fit the mold of a mythology that colors the TU).

Last night I had ideas -- finally, finally, ideas -- about how to
use these to my advantage.  These are not perfected, but I
think they are useable.

1) The Ancients is an incredible enigma of massive proportions,
and of course by now everybody -- players and referees -- pretty
much knows their history.  Those who haven\'t played the LBB
adventures just read summaries in other books.  Good!  Now that
everyone takes the solution for granted, I suggest turning it on its
head.  Pick a key part of the evidence and history, and have players
unwittingly debunk it.  The whole edifice collapses, and now all
you knew about the Ancients is bogus.  Is it a massive plot, and if
so, by who, or is it just another red herring that the community
just bandwagoned along with, as is so common with people?

2) The political and military twists and turns of war are never
exhausted.  As we have seen recently, Loren Wiseman knows this.

3) If you\'re willing to do the groundwork, then pick an alternate
Rebellion.  Dulinor was framed; or, Lucan is not a convincing leader
(or is assassinated) and the Imperium is rapidly being gathered back
together... by Judas himself, who is busily removing all evidence of
his handiwork.  Order, law, and peace is being restored, and the
rebel scum are being crushed... all will soon be well... right??

4) Archer, a predecessor and competitor to Longbow, was going
full steam in the early 1100\'s.  Its goal: to produce feasible jump-
torpedos containing military beacons.  An expensive and effective
(and fully automatable) J-6 communications network.  Obviously
a strict military project.  Why would prototypes end up with
Barracai Technum?

Okay, that\'s what I\'ve got down so far.  Opinions and contributions?

What we really need is a TML Knowledge Base, the few  times  I\'ve
tried to use the archives in the past I\'ve  found  it  difficult.
Anyone want to set one up?

I would imagine that anyone with space capability would park some blockading
warships a few million km away and use these as beacons.

If you don\'t have the ships, then either you have home advantage and know
the ground or you have a problem.

No, it was more of a \'Damn, I\'m tired of whacking everybody in sight to keep 
that damned old man in power.\'  What the death of the Eternal Emperor and the 
release of the data on the fissure in the Alva Sector did was, allow people 
to make their *own* choices, and if they were a bit far from the action, 
there were always Thorson\'s \'Bravo Project\' files.

Their point was, it could never get anywhere.  And to a point, they were right.  When you got down to it, every war the Empire had was for control of AM2.  There was no \'real\' building, and Imperial displeasure was hard, fast, and deadly on anything that might be seen to impinge on the royal monopoly.

Sorry, but you must consider your target audience. The first thing taught
in US colleges is to consider your target audience; you don\'t write using
$5 words when trying to target the general public, and you don\'t avoid em
when they are part of the jargon for the field you\'re targeting.

Best example of successful targeting: the D&D Basic/Expert/Companion/Master
progression. The first book introduces the basic concept of play, and CGen,
and dungeon crawls. Each further box expands the game with new rules,
campaign types, weapons, background, etc.

I find the best solutions to the "Party" issue are a common patron and
prior service together... or at least sitting down, drawing a timeline of
the character\'s carreers, and noting when A met B. As for cooperation,
that\'s either going to happen or not, and is player dependant, having
little to do with characters (excpt for the most dedicated ROLE-players)/

It is easy enough in Traveller: a common patron. In WoD, have a mummy or
some other (not represented in the group) type of supernatural draw the
group together with a combination of threats and promises.

Over the years I\'ve found the best solution for Traveller  is  to
have the party  still  *in  service*.  In  my  current  Traveller
campaign the group started out as the crew of a IN Gazelle  class
Close Escort in the Regina subsector in 1105.  They are now an IN
troubleshooter team (aka "Irregular Ops") assigned to one of  the
fleets in the 5FW (rimward of the Sword Worlds) ... and now 1  PC
is an ImpMarine NCO.  Not  only  does  this  give  the  party  an
\'excuse\' to be together, they are  also  much  more  disciplined.
Also, if they get hold of any equipment which could unbalance the
game they have to hand  it  in.  Adventures  include:  smuggling,
intelligence gathering, counter-terrorist, search and rescue  (of
lifeboats after fleet engagements),  damage  control  on  capital
ships, a murder mystery, they\'ve also been POWs and diplomats.

Normally, I do just grab names out of the newpaper or the phone book.
However, since this going to be published I figured I give some TMLers
their fifteen seconds of fame and guard against people coming up to me
screaming that I\'d used them without permission.

I *really* need to finish the Illuminated Traveller Campaign page.  Droyne,
Templars, the truth behind both the Long Night and the rise of Cleon, why
nobody noticed Andor until the 8th Century, why Plankwell started the Civil
War, and why Arbellatra stopped it.

The problem is that they may very well have shipped it to you...
once it leaves their hands, it\'s not their problem. I had a couple
of books hung up for almost 2 months in transit from Amazon once.

(Of course, I am in Canada, so YMMV).

In the UK, typical engineering roles appear to have 25 days leave 
(accrued at 2/month +1) and 8 additional days of public holidays.

The working week (unless opted out under EU law) must average <48 
hours. Typically, engineering jobs have between 35 and 39 hour weeks, 
with 37.5 hours being common.

It\'s probably a type 39 error or a type 2 error really. <grin>

And there are versions of Linux for PPC. I know of people who have 
bought PowerMac G3\'s and some who wanted G4s for Linux to wun werry 
werry qwikly.

As to Penguin throwing, I know the book will be packed out with the

write scenarios for ACQ, and draw up a deckplan, I\'ll host them on 
the BITS site. (Aside from the AP costs, the scenarios could be 
written in T4.1 style).

Not true. Wilderness adventures were part of the original three books.
I even bought Avalon Hill\'s "Outdoor Survival" game as it was the
recommended "quickie random wilderness map".

For that matter, the Chainmail Fantasy section was intended for field
battles!

Actually, if done well, a common response to a VR sim "adventure" is
for at least one of the characters to turn to the others and ask "How
do we *know* that we aren\'t *still* in a sim?"

And since the answer is "You can\'t tell." it sort of shakes you up.

Re-read the book. The evidence all points to several clones having
never even made it out of the initial "facility". And also to the idea
that a new clone *won\'t* be any closer to the original. Too much drift
over the centuries, and the built-in failsafe has failed unsafely. 

Any *new* clone, even if a good copy, will sooner or later find out the
dodge the "bad" one found for getting around the implanted bomb. And
then we\'re back to an all-powerful Emperor *without* the balance of a
conscience. 

The solution the "computer" came up with was to try to get a person who
would make a good Emperor to take over the job. Sten decided that it
wouldn\'t work any better a second time, and probably not last as long
as the first time. So he declined the offer.

Actually, even bad governments would have reasons to use (mostly)
non-lethal agents. First of all, your troops are going to be a lot
happier dispensing them, since a mistake probably won\'t kill them.

Also, it\'s hard to question dead people.

As I noted a week or so back, some of that tech bears investigating for
traveller. Among other details, they had a *sealed* life support
system. They were using CO2 scrubbers and a *small* tank of LOX. This
for several weeks.

Speedboats *are* still raced. But they\'ve diverged so far from craft
useful for anything else, that they are a seperate category. In the US,
at least, they are called "hydroplanes". And there are frequent races.

I\'ve bought software from Amazon, several music cd\'s and *lot\'s* of
books from them with never a problem.  It\'s their policy not to
charge your credit card until after they ship, and they\'ve never
done to me.  I always get an email confirming that the order has
gone out before my card is billed.

Go to Amazon and check your account history.  It should list all
your orders and their state of completion.  I\'d bet they think they
mailed you the game.

Well, you can\'t be held accountable for *more* than $50 if you
report it to your card carrier.  OTOH, the game was probably not
more than $50, right?  However, I\'m sure this company doesn\'t want
unhappy (vocal) customers, so I\'d get after them if I was you and
get them to make it good.  The key is to get the attention of a real
person that works there.  I\'ve found that most customer support
people really *do* want to help...regardless of how much they gripe.

Anyway, I got the following phone number to their 24/7 customer
support from their website...

    'body' => 'Well, a bit late to this thread, but...

I\'ve had a world idea that I\'ve been meaning to write up for a while. And,
coincidentally enough, looking through my maps of the marches last night, I
came up with a great spot for it in Regina subsector.

Whanga 0206 Regina E676126-7

I haven\'t done the "nice" writeup, so you\'ll all have to do with a brain dump
of the random thoughts.

The basic idea is that Whanga is, by most definitions, a garden world. (more on
the atmosphere taint in a second). It\'s lush, it\'s (mostly) green, you might
even think that it was Terra if you didn\'t know better. A world well suited for
human life - with one minor exception. No one has ever been able to get
agriculture to work on the planet\'s surface. I\'m still trying to handwave an
explanation for this, but I\'m thinking along the lines of a more "aggressive"
strain of plant life on the planet which prevents any large-scale agricultural
activity from going on for more than a season or two. Colonies have tried to
establish themselves for centuries , but constantly been killed off or pushed
out by the lack of ability to sustain themselves. (This is the basic premise
which sets up pretty much everything else, so if you don\'t like my explanation,
you can stop reading here, as it\'ll all fall apart). The atmospheric taint
doesn\'t really exist, it was just put there by an early survey team who
couldn\'t think of any better explanation for the dead colony they came across.
Research on the planet\'s biosphere continues in the Third Imperium trying to
figure out what\'s up. (Note that will make more sense later: even in 1100,
nearly 5 million tourists show up every year with filter masks in tow, thinking
the atmosphere is tained. Whanga does a good business selling re-conditioned
filter masks that they leave behind)

So, you\'ve got a garden world which can\'t be colonized, so what\'s it good for?
Well, it makes a nice retreat for the rich, assuming you can get there and pack
enough food in for the time you\'re there. So, over the centuries, nobles set up
small cottages & ranches there, bringing in everything with them when they
arrive - food, supplies, servants - and taking it out when they leave.
Eventually businesses set up shop catering to the nobles, importing food on a
regular basis, etc. many of the private noble ranches eventually turned into
commercial retreats, taking anyone (who can pay the price) in for rest,
relaxation and a level of "wilderness" that simply can\'t be duplicated on a
populated planet.

Of course, nothing that nice lasts forever. Eventually (say, around year 800,
900 or so) someone saw the opportunity to re-cast Whanga as a more "populist"
tourist destination. With the lack of a planetary government, there\'s no one to
tax and legislate any dubious activities, so the resorts turned into casinos
(and, for the more "adult" campaigns, "chicken farms"). Sitting close to
various highly-populated worlds, Whanga quickly became, well, I\'ll give away my
inspiration here - Las Vegas.

For example, Whanga is:

Jump 4 from Regina,          pop ~700,000,000
Jump 2 from Efate,         pop ~8,000,000,000
Jump 2 from Roup,          pop ~3,000,000,000
Jump 3 from Louzy/Jewell, pop ~10,000,000,000

Which is about 21,700,000,000 sophonts within a reasonable one-jump distance.
You can run a tourism business on that. Of course, it\'s no small feat,
considering that you have to haul in a ton or so worth of food for each and
every person that\'s coming to stay for several weeks. Not to mention hauling
all the, er, shit (for lack of a better word) back out. At any given time,
there are tens of millions of resort employees serving the tens of millions of
visitors on the planet\'s surface. But to operate in a beautiful, idyllic,
government-free environment - well, who could pass that up?

Of course, like Las Vegas, the Whangan resorts make money hand over fist and
since it\'s tax free, they can do some pretty aggressive expansion. Many of them
have turned into replicas of famous cities from across the Imperium. "Iridium
Palace" is a replica of the Imperial Palace on Capitol. "Manhattan" is an odd
mishmash of various Terran cities, incorporating pieces of New York, Paris,
Venice as well as famous sights like the Taj Mahal and Terra\'s most (in)famous
location, the former headquarters of the 12th Imperial Marines (left over from
the occupation days), a kilometer high windowless slab of metal containing
(instead of marines and training facilities) numerous simulator rides, several
grav ball courts and, of course, the biggest casino on the planet. There are
replicas of other famous cities as well, including ones from Vland, Antares and
one that claims to be a replica of Kyusu (sp?) the Aslan homeworld, though,
unsurprisingly, few people who have ever been to Kyusu show up to challenge the
claim.  These cities are more than just show pieces - they\'re actual real
cities that house the employees and visitors. There are very few explicit
hotels in the resorts - you feel like you\'ve just moved somewhere else for a
while.

The planet is run by a loose coalition of the planet\'s biggest resort owners,
all of whom disavow any knowledge of a planetary government, lest the Imperial
Palace begin asking for tax money. At one point in history a single small
resort owner did declare himself the planet\'s legitimate government, but oddly
enough, a million-ton grain freighter crashed into his compound shortly after
unloading at the highport. Since then, no one has attempted to make a similar
claim. Thus the government type of 2, as the planet is de facto ruled by the
various resorts.

The world has no official starport, thus the \'E\' rating. There is, however, a
privately owned highport and (of course) casino, which handles all of the
world\'s traffic, receiving cargo and passengers, which are then ferried to the
surface by the resorts\' private boats. "Boats" is a relative term, as some
cargo boats approach the 1,000 ton mark.

There is a system navy to protect the various passenger and cargo ships moving
through the system. It is funded, unofficially, by the various resorts, but is
autonomous, alleging to report to no one except it\'s own high commander.
Although small, it is amazingly well equipped, with nothing but the best of
Imperial TL 15 equipment.

Finally, there is a small official Imperial presence on the world\'s surface. A
resort owner lost a chain of islands (near the planet\'s equator in the
semi-tropical zone) to the then Duke of Regina in a card game, in 1002. The
islands are now used by the Duke\'s Own Huscarles as a "training facility" - one
of the sector\'s more plum military assignments. There is also a Naval
Intelligence school associated with the facility, again one of the better
schools in the sector. Whanga\'s population of 1 reflects the few dozen
full-time staff assigned to the base and the school - the only real "Imperial
citizens" there on a full-time basis.

Whanga is (in)famous throughout the Marches as the ultimate tourist
destination. Outside the Marches it\'s seens as a kind of monument to the
tackiness of the spinward frontier dwellers, but it never the less manages to
attract nearly a billion visitors a year, most of whom leave a good chunk of
money behind them.

I could enumerate adventure possibilities, but they\'re probably obvious, so
I\'ll leave that for another email. Oh, and I hope there\'s no canon background
for Whanga - it just fit the profile of an otherwise nice world, physically,
with the right population level near several high-pop \'feeder\' worlds. You
could stick Whanga anywhere really.

Well, cigarette boat racing is still quite popular along the eastern
seaboard....both organized and spontaneous racing at night against the
Coast Guard and DEA ;-)

I remember watching a race on the Hudson River, from our apartment in
Yonkers. amazing boats. \'bout as stealthy as a charging rhino, but
amazing boats nonetheless. (we were really lucky, we had an apartment 
on Warburton Ave (for anyone who knows where it is) up about 1/4 mile
from the Hastings line. Nice view of the palisades and river...;-)

Contact your credit card company. If I recall correctly, the seller has
a *maximum* of 30 days from the date they send in the charge to deliver
the item or provide a satifactory explanation of the delay. And
regardless of the explanation, you can choose to cancel the order and
tell the credit card company to remove the charge. Of course, that
*will* leave you without the item, but at least you won\'t be out the
money.

And if you do the logical thing and have a homage/fealty type model
extending all the way down the line, any noble should be able to lodge
charges of "treason" against anyone violating their oaths to *him*.

BTW, this brings up an important point regarding oaths of
fealty/homage. Not only do they work both ways (that is, while the
underling is obligated to his liege, the lieg has equal obligations to
the underling), but there are two more factors.

First, being in effect "contracts" laying out *mutual* obligations,
they can be terminated by *either* party by claiming non-performance
(ie the underling can charge his liege with failing to look after the
underlings welfare in the manner specified and that terminates the
"contract" just as fast as the liege claiming the underling was
derelict in the underling\'s duties). This makes "treason" acting
against your liege *without* severing the tie first.

Second, there\'s the very important matter of whether or not
fealty/homage is transitive. That is, if I\'m sworn to Baron X, and he\'s
sworn to Count Y, am I obligated to Count Y? If yes, the relationship
is transitive. If no, it isn\'t. The two possibilities result in *very*
different sorts of "politics", but both are arguably possible given
what is known of the Imperium. 

Playing fealty/homage "right" makes for interesting legal situations.

Also, as with liege/underling relationships the person/company
*holding* the indenture has obligations towards the indenturee. Some
will be legal (like offspring are *not* automatically indentured)
others are contract terms. 

This gives a few more possibilities. An indenturee asks for the players
help claiming that the corporation holding most of the contacts on the
world isn\'t living up to its end of the deal.

Or the players learn that the contracts contain clauses illegal under
imperial (or sector or subsector) law. 

In both cases, if the players decide to try to help, they are going to
be fighting a fair sized corporation, if not a megacorp. And proof is
going to be hard to get unless they know a sufficiently ranked noble
who will take their word as being good enough to start an
investigation.

BTW, in a "feudal" setup with oaths between liege and sworn man, even
if it\'s gotten so complex (as it likely would) that the oaths are
multipage contracts, you\'ll have an element that among both the
nobility, and the people serving them under such "oaths" ones sworn
word is a *very* valuable commodity.

This presents interesting playing possibilities. Including such things
as putting a PC in a spot where he gave his sworn word, and then found
out that things were a *lot* more complicated than he\'d thought. Now
he\'s got to find a way to keep his word *and* avoid getting in trouble
with the law (or getting into some other sort of trouble). 

Being "honorable" can be a *real* bitch at times. :-)

There was a story in Analog a couple of years ago about the
aftermath of an EMP attack.  Seems the PRC "accidentally" exploded a
nuclear device in LEO above the eastern seaboard of the US.  It
knocked out just about everything electronic from Maine to Florida
and from the Atlantic coast to the Mississippi river.  Most cars,
almost all computers, electrical appliances wouldn\'t work even if
the electical switching stations or power plants were.  Thousands
died, millions were stranded thrown out of work and isolated for
weeks on end. A major depression, at least, ensued.

Absolutely!  I did the same.  <G> 

The first adventure I ran (1974), started in a town where the party
was hired as bodyguards for a pair of merchants.  They traveled down
a river having adventures with lizard men and a troll on a bridge.
Then it was through an enchanted forest and a run in with elves
over chopping down a sacred tree that was settled peacefully.  Out
of the forest the party entered a town where the merchants did their
business while the PC\'s found rooms in the inn.  An "encounter"
between a PC and the innkeeper\'s daughter lead to a rapid exit from
the town the next morning...Julio was always something of a cad.
The party traveled into the hill country toward the mountains
meeting some hobbits (friendly) and a pair of wandering giants
(tried to steal the horses) along the way.  Later they came upon a
wizard working some sort of weather magic at the edge of a cliff,
and one of the party "discovered" she had magical abilities.  A
tribe of goblins provided a big combat along a mountain path.  Once
over the mountains they delivered the merchants through the "bad
lands" patrolled by tribes of horsemen into the "Peaceful Kingdom
and the "Celestial City."  This completed their adventure and not
wanting to continue with those characters the players and I ended
the campaign.  Not one dungeon crawl in the year long campaign.
Now, in the *second* adventure...<g>

You know, recounting that tail makes me want to run it again.  I
haven\'t looked at that fantasy world in 20 years.

Your work up of Whanga seems to have captured that

Normally when you play Vampire, there is no traditional "party" at all.
That\'s how :-)

Actually, the characters in such a game are not quite as close friends
as in a traditional game. They keep details of their backgrounds from
each other, have secrets that the others shouldn\'t know about, etc. They
have gathered together more because of convenience than anything else.
After all, there are perhaps five other vampires in a city who would
consider socializing with people like you. So how much of a choice do
you really have (except leaving town, which is very dangerous)? Even the
"tragic hero" cannot bear the loneliness of enduring eternity alone.

As long as the characters have some force holding them together, the
game will work. That force doesn\'t need to be friendship. ;-)

ObTrav: This kind of game could easily be run in Traveller as well. Have
a captain of a ship (NPC or player) hire the other player characters
independently of each other. They should all be more or less desperate
for work, but they will not fit together as a group. The constant
squabbling is really fun to GM. In addition, it gives the characters a
lot more depth, since they can act out all kinds of minor quirks.

"Did you see that package Eneri picked up last time we hit ground port?
I wonder what\'s inside of it."

"Captain, I\'ve smelled a thick, sweet odor from Eneri\'s room ever since
we entered jumpspace. I think he might have brought some kind of drugs
on board."

You should try playing in this fashion, regardless of game system. It\'s
a really interesting break from the "normal" group, where everyone
trusts each other completely.

Be sure not to overdo it, though. If everyone in the group has some
reason to kill at least one of the others, things will get out of hand
sooner or later.

yes, and I imagine that\'s the reason they tell us that
doing a jump without a computer is VERY risky! But I
would the most important thing is survival, rather
than time, so as long as you stay outside the stars
gravitational well (which I understand can induce
misjumps and all sorts of disasters), you\'ll be okay.
You can "target" your jump simply by looking out the
window, taking a bead on the star, moving a few
million miles, doing the same again, and then a third
time... with a bit of trignometry and a calculator,
you can figure the distance... I get the impression it
ain\'t meant to be that exact, else why do you always
jump in a random distance from the star? In Kirk\'s
words, "Go thataway.":)

Of course. So I\'d say this would just be one of the
problems for an invading army on a world. Yet more
"home ground advantage" for the defenders. But in such
a case, couldn\'t the invasion fleet\'s ships still in
orbit act as a GPS system for the invaders, thus
giving them better accuracy? Even first round hits?

Other worlds don\'t vary any more than our own does,
with the exception of planetoids/asteroids, and there
the problem would be putting not too much powder in
the breach, else your artillery round will enter
orbit!

Anyway, don\'t you think terror weapons will be more
common? Anybody remember Babylon 5, where the
Centaurans bombarded Narn from orbit, basically
dropiing rocks on their cities? Doesn\'t prevent
guerilla warfare, of course, but artillery has NEVER
been that useful against insurgencies, do we expect
that to change in the future?

I definitely like the game where a good roleplayer has a secret agenda.
He was retired out of the scouts and got this neat ship, but he is really
using this whole travelling stuff as a cover for his spying. Perhaps
one of the other pcs even knew him from his scout career, never knowing
he was a spy for Solomani Security.

Steal^H^H^H^H^Hborrow an idea from David Weber. There\'s a local
bacterium, probably entire *familes*(in the taxonomic sense) of them,
that just *loves* chlorophyll.

Short of destroying the *entire* planetary ecology and starting over,
there\'s just no way to get chlorophyll based plants to last more than
*days* on the planet. 

Luckily these bugs are tied to the local ecology well enough that they
don\'t survive well off world.

This has some interesting effects. For example, a number of foods won\'t
keep well on world. Brocolli and spinach, to name just a couple. Things
like lettuce and cabbage, which don\'t have all that much chlorophyll in
them keep better, though not as well as on earth. And foods with *no*
chlorophyll content (corn, grain, root veggies, etc) keep normally.

This will affect menus, and prices.

Quite right. I am thinking of a classic sci fi story,
by Stanislaw Lem, Heinlein or someone, where an
astronaut comes back to Earth after a hundred or more
years of STL travel, relativistic effects have meant
he only experienced a few years\' passing... the whole
earth is now "safe". People are given treatment at
birth to remove all their aggression, cars have
sophisticated radar and computer systems so that they
never crash... and so now nobody explores or advances,
society is stagnant...

"Mars, Bringer of War" is a good piece originally by a composer named

That\'s true, but that\'s just tradecraft.
I was referring to the statement in question talking about considering how
people are going to _interpret_ it.

I probably should have put more detail, because I would agree that rule-sets
need to consider some possible interpretations, but what I disagree about is
that you should try and design a rule-set that is "munchkin" or
"rules-lawyer" proof, because any such system would be either unneccessarily
complicated and top-heavy, or so simple as to be hardly worth it.

But it\'s also an example of some of the worst technical writing, rules
design and prose I have ever seen.

For a start, the rules expansions and changes are incompatible between
versions, and do not "flow" from one set to another in a logical way.
Secondly, figuring out how to play either game by actually reading the book
is almost impossible. Luckily for TSR, most people don\'t bother actually
using all the rules, and most kids playing it learn how to play from other
kids, not from reading the rules.

The prose is about as good as that in bad Mills & Boon novels

Just because it is _succesful_ does not mean it\'s _good_ . Microsoft is the
prime example of this phenomenon.

Actually this is a better  idea than "aggressive" plant life. After all If
that was the problem then enclosed hydroponics (sic?) should be able to
survive... potentially needing occational burnouts and re-seeding but seeds
would keep well. A chlorophyll eating bug is harder to block out. It also
excludes most terran-like animals, since the plant life would be so
different as to be totally unusable as fodder.

Also a bug that has any lifespan beyond the planet\'s surface (say 1-2 days)
would exclude orbital food factories. Quarantine being decreasingly effect
vs. time and concidering how often shuttles would be moving between the
surface and the orbital station, it\'s nearly certain that the crop would be
infected.

Then there is also the Imperial (secret!) research station that is
attempting to create a strain that wWILL live off world... The perfect
bio-warfare agent to "seed" on the Zho controled worlds. They are also
looking for an antidote to clean the worlds with once the bugs have done
their job!

I\'m not so sure that this will be the case. One of the lessons which is
impressed upon students in their Officer\'s Advanced Course and C&GS (this is
my US Army experience talking here) is that the law of land warfare exists
and is generally followed because it makes sense to. Violating it may get
you short-term gains, but the long-run result is generally unfavorable.
(It\'s one of the few things I still remember from these schools. That and
the bogus class on training management paperwork which I managed to fail by
virtue of ignoring all of the content. Well, maybe a few more things, but
that would be straying way off topic.) You can find volume after volume of
case studies which demonstrate this point.

This is the ultimate reason why it is very unlikely that such things like
near-c rocks will be regularly used as weapons. Maybe once in a while by
renegades, but not as a weapon of choice. Civilizations which progress far
enough to reach advanced technology will also have come to the same
conclusion.

The cynic in me reads this and considers the source. I don\'t mean that as an
insult to you, but it\'s obvious that an armed service branch that
specializes in land warfare is going to say that the law of land warfare
exists and is generally followed because it makes sense to.

One would imagine that someone who joined a branch of the armed services
that specialized in land warfare wouldn\'t get to a point where they\'d be
able to teach policy if they believed that no "law of land warfare" exists,
and that it is generally followed out of tradition, not because it\'s
rational or sensible to do so.

I\'m not saying that I hold that belief, only that I am not surprised to hear
that the U.S. Army teaches a doctrine thats says that there is a reason for
an organization specializing in land warfare to exist, and that reason is a
rational one.

With all due respect, though, that doesn\'t really tell us alot concerning
whether or not land warfare would be seen as effective by those who hold
positions of responsibility (or more cynically, those who pay the bills) in
the Imperium.

>Violating it may get
>you short-term gains, but the long-run result is generally unfavorable.


Fair enough. What are these long term gains that would be gained as a result
of ground warfare that wouldn\'t be gained through the use of cheap but
excessive force (as in orbital bombardment) or any variation on this theme?

In this case, I\'m putting the powerful traditional romantic notion of the
infantry soldier aside. Ordinarily, I don\'t like to sweep such things under
the carpet, but in this case I feel that it is justified. This is an appeal
to tradition, and as a result it naturally follows that it  is descriptive,
not prescriptive. In other words, based on experience, such a notion
describes things as they *have* been up to this point, and does not
prescribe as they might be, nor as they will be.

In this sense, I\'m trying to head off possible misinterpretations that may
lead people to reply by saying something like, "Well, as everyone knows you
always need a doughboy down in the trenches and the mud." For the sake of
discussion, let me say that I *don\'t* know that.

How am I to be convinced that the Imperium (or other major interstellar
power) won\'t see value in dropping big, cheap rocks on major cities in order
to get their way?

>that would be straying way off topic.) You can find volume after volume of

Perhaps, but it still boils down to description, not prescription.

We can manufacture aerogels now, but they\'re pretty wispy, natch.
Some sort of gel with O2/CO2 exchange properties would be the go ; a
perfluorocarbon analog with plasticiser? We could also do this now. You
could breathe for a little while. The initial sensation of drowning as

The obvious answer is \'eat (make edible) the local plant material and
build orbital greenhouses for the stuff that won\'t grow on the surface\'.

Let\'s have a think about how the premise could be true, though.
Temperature, atmospheric composition (and particulate concentrations),
humidity and water availability, and background radiation levels are
\'Terran-normal\'.

i. Chemistry
- - toxic \'trace\' elements or compounds ; salinity ; pH
ii. Biological
- - biochemistry (missing nutrients, molecular counterfeits) ;
- - lack of soil symbionts (antibacterial/fungal substances produced by
local life);
- - ecological competition from local life.
iii. Other
- - sabotage
- - belligerent native sophonts?

Maybe it does. Filter masks are worn to prevent causative spores,

You don\'t have to with fusion power. Turn it into simple hydrocarbons.
If abundant energy isn\'t available, burn it, bury it, or terraform the

There is a DGP publication entitled something like \'the early 
adventures\' which has all the original Traveller\'s Digest adventures 
in, and doesn\'t seem to be that expensive 2nd hand.

Be careful - I\'m not sure if the characters or event are referred to 
in any of the GDW published material. I think the MT player\'s 
handbook uses them as examples *but* doesn\'t elaborate on their 
background. This could put you on a slippery legal slope, as MM may 
not be able to give permission for you to use them (as DGP\'s material 
is owned by Roger <spit> Sanger who is in dispute with MM). The 
characters were developed in house by DGP...

Cheers,

That one\'s easy. Contact your credit charge company and get the charge
reversed. That\'s what I did when Imperium Games took several months to not
ship my order.

Cool!  That means I\'ll have a place to put up the Cinematic rules for ACQ.
Like the Slow Explosion rule:

Any event producing explosive damage travels so slowly that the combatants
are able to spend AP running away from the explosion.  This move must end
in a Dive For Cover, during which the *player* must do his best Bruce

Common treason, yes. Judged by the noble\'s leige lord. Charges of treason
are not normally laid except in times of emergency, or in cases of active
hard. (Ie. ignoring the Duke when he says "pass the peas" at dinner won\'t
get you charged with treason.)

Said severing consisting of a ceremony. Nothing major, but enough that
saying "I quit, now b****r off." isn\'t enough.

Partially, IMTU.  If you are sworn to Baron X, then you are obligated to
Count Y, but Baron X must pass along the orders unless he has told you to
obey Count Y. There is nothing to stop you from obeying Count Y of your own
accord, of course, and obedience is expected (but not required).

This is why the Imperial Navy swears an oath to the Emperor, directly.

That\'s why it makes for great gaming. And if you\'re playing GT, that\'s why
it\'s a disadvantage (although a _reputation_ for being honourable would be
an advantage, too).

Oy.
I read that story as a teenager. It creeped the hell out of me.
I always thought it was cool, and I liked Carpenter\'s remake, as
he did actually follow the story.  I always speculated though--
was the alien monster a crew-member of the crashed spaceship,
or was he something THEY had picked up and been victimized by as
well?

Hawaiian, eh? I guess the old kingdom finally got justice. Yanks in Space,
indeed! ;-)

3,000 years is a long time to retain a cultural/ethnic identity
(historically, anyway, although information technology may have now changed
that). How likely is it that Strephon would have anything resembling the
appearance of a Polynesian? How likely is it that the human population in
general will retain distinctive genotypes that one can distinguish visibly?
With specific exceptions  like the Sword Worlds notwithstanding, humaniti
seems to me to have become pretty "raceless." Or is this my own
wishful-thinking filter kicking in?

Do we have a situation in the Imperium where there are 11,000 x n different
human ethnic groups, with at least one for each world and possibly hundreds?

This could be really ugly, and could go a long way to explain why something
like the Rebellion could get so nasty (I know, I know, the Rebellion was
all just a dream).

Or do we think that social sciences and technology have advanced at pace
with the hard sciences (given the way people behave in the canon
liturature, I would say not -- except, perhaps, for the Zhodani)?

Okay, I guess this is just a roundabout way of asking: how balkanized is
*your* Imperium? Not Douglas\'s specifically, but anyone\'s. How do you see
issues of culture and ethnicity reflected in YTU? Do you see it breaking
down into the big three (Vilani, Zhodani, Solomani), regional (Sylean,
Denebian, Solomani), planetary (Capitalian, Regianian, Solomani), or even
on sub-planetary basis? Or do you expect a mix of all four? If it\'s a mix,
how is it biased?

I would suppose that it would be mostly planetary or regional -- as recent
discussion has reminded us, off-world travel is not for the average citizen.

For those of you into genetic drift and the like, how differentiated do you
think humaniti will have become (Ancient and human meddling aside)?

Yeah, LETHAL WEAPON. There were 4 flicks about Riggs (Gibson) and
Murtaugh (Glover). What made the series even more hilarious is the
addition of Joe Pesci as Leo Goetz..."whatever Leo Wants, Leo Gets!" or

<sigh> The USPS delivers millions of pieces of mail quickly and
safely, but once in a while they fail.  It\'s the failures we all
remember.  Here\'s my USPS failure story...my Mom sent my sister\'s
family their Christmas presents via USPS three years ago.  The box
never arrived, but in mid March a *piece* of the box with the
address on it was delivered to her with a "Sorry, but this is all
that\'s left" message.  Since than she sends only through UPS.  It
happens with the private carriers too, but it seems to happen less
often.

Good!  I\'ve always liked Amazon\'s service and never had a problem,
but it\'s good to know they\'ll make a problem good.

Ob Trav...Obvious!  Does the X-boat service *ever* fail to deliver
their messages?  Do they maintain a monopoly on certain classes of
message?  Are there *specific* commercial carriers of mail and small
package in the Imperium, or are those roles subsumed into the
operations of the various MegaCorps?

Strange... I had the same reaction.  Probably it\'s the unilinear nature of
technological determinism that brought us both to see the truth, dontcha

I think you misunderstood him. "Law of land warfare" refers to the
rules under which land warfare is conducted (mostly the result of
treaties). It has nothing to do with justifying the existence of
armies or their effectiness. Nor more so than "Law of the sea"
justifies the existence of the sea.

Both are bodies of international law dealing with the subject in question.

Actually, it should "merely" take a public (published?) formal
declaration, complete with a notice being sent to the liege. 

The reason I\'d go for this rather than a ceremony is that if you are
terminating the contract because your liege has been playing fast and
loose with the rules, it may not be *safe* to arrange for a ceremony
that has both of you present. 

With a formal declaration, you just can\'t (honorably) act against him
until you are sure he\'s received his copy.

Yep! They\'ve learned from history that it\'s best to eliminate *any*

And a reputation for being dishonorable is a disadvantage of a rather

There\'s a ral world ultrasonic gizmo sold for protection against dogs.
I accidentally got the effect it uses while visiting a friend working
with an ultrasonic alarm system. I have "abnormal" hearing in that I
can hear well into the ultrasonics (I\'m told this is common among those
who had asthma as children). 

Anyway, I thought I could hear the alarm transducers. So I picked one
up and brought it *quickly* to my ear. This doppler shifted the output
to a higher frequency. I thought the top of my head was going to come off!

I\'ve been hit in the head by a fist sized rock. It felt better than
this "sound" did. 

I assume the anti-dog device works similarly. In which case I can
understand why it makes the dog stop. I\'m told that they can\'t use the
ultrasound gizmo on people because it apparently has nasty effects on a
small percentage of the population. Something about rupturing
anuerisms? 

Still, it\'d make a nice weapon for folks who weren\'t too worried if it
occasionally killed someone. But it\'d definitely be a *short* range
weapon. More suitable for muggings than crowd control.

Oh yeah, after I recovered, I *slowly* brought a transducer to my ear. The
faint whine I\'d heard *was* the transducers.

I don\'t think ~/kh/ exists in the Polynesian languages, but it does in
some of the other Austronesian languages.  It ain\'t Vilani.  It actually
looks sort of Tsolyani -- esp. with the final -koi element.  That would be
a little farfetched, though :).  Arabic or arabicized something, maybe?  I
have to say, I really have no idea.  I\'d just as soon say it\'s taken from
some language that was current in, say, the fifth millenium, and which has
no traceable antecedents to the languages we know of on Terra today ;)

I\'ll accept the responsibility for misunderstanding him, and I apologize.

Even so, it\'s still not readily apparent how that would relate to the
practice of "rock dropping", or the usage of cheap excessive force by the
Third Imperium. Is the implication that there exists some set of rules and
treaties that the Imperium holds itself to? There are the Imperial Rules of
War, but they\'re "unwritten", and the Imperium itself doesn\'t abide by them.
If I recall correctly, the Imperium doesn\'t let member worlds use nukes, for
example, but it does reserve that right for itself.

I have worked down all the lines. I found the cyclopadia rules (which are a
mere reformat of the double book boxed set materials) to be a very cogent,
and easy to understand (even for a total newbie). I found the AD&D
materials guilty of being aimed at an audience who already knwos how to
game, and guilty of the conflicting rules syndrome. Since the days of the
Blue and Red books, the D&D line has been more consistent... mind you the
Known World setting (Gazateer) supplements DO contracdict the boxed rules;
they are likewise aimed at a more liberal minded group than players: GMs.

As to "Munchkin proofing", no you\'ll never munchkin proof any game
(Although SFB and ASL come fairly close).

Ob Trav: Looking at the above tree, whining about 5 editions of traveller
seems trivial... since I have most of the above D&D materials, and they
take 3 CuFt, as opposed to about 1.5 CuFt for my Traveller collection.

Frankly I\'ve had the exact opposite experience. USPS has always been great

UPS is allowed to just leave packages on someone\'s front door unattended (can

On USENET rec.guns, everybody is bitching about how UPS employees steal guns 
constantly (and is the reason UPS won\'t ship them via ground anymore). I\'ve 
corresponded with someone who had to send his weapon back to Smith and Wesson 
for repair (it wasn\'t his issue weapon so the department wouldn\'t fix it). 
When S+W sent it back to him via UPS, it was delivered to the wrong 
apartment. The instructions said that the package could only be released to 
the owner via ID and signature. The nitwit driver didn\'t bother to check the 
paperwork or ID and gave the weapon to this person. The rightful owner (who 
is a LEO by the way...) reported it stolen and contacted BATF as well as his 
department. Both UPS and his neighbor are now in BIG trouble.

I attribute this appalling decline in service to UPS having had their loaders

Well, 3,000 years is a long time to retain much of anything. Even those
concepts that "survive" are going to change so much that they no longer look
like they did originally.

>How likely is it that Strephon would have anything resembling the

It depends. It\'s possible to imagine a scenario in which the variations of
gross morphology in the major and minor human races in known space might
inspire a resurgence of racialist ideas. On the other hand, it\'s also
possible to imagine a scenario where the opposite is true.

>How likely is it that the human population in

>visibly?


Extremely likely. After all, we\'re dealing with isolated worlds in space and
a model of interstellar travel that precludes the possibility of mass
immigration or mass exodus. Interstellar travellers might tend toward
"uniformity", but it\'s likely that those who are planetbound (the vast
majority of the citizens of the Imperium) would have significant differences
in gross morphology.

There are certain things that Traveller avoids like the plague in canon. The
three main ones that I can think of are religion, race and ideology.

With that in mind, it *is* possible to read between the lines. Concepts such
as  major and minor human races *do* exist in the Imperium. Make of that
tidbit what you will.

It seems to me that there is *something* that distinguishes various branches
of humaniti from others. If distinctions in race were flattened to the
extent that is frequently imagined in sci-fi there would be no need to
distinguish between the two.

>Do we have a situation in the Imperium where there are 11,000 x n different
>human ethnic groups, with at least one for each world and possibly
hundreds?


In my opinion, yes, at least to some degree. Planets are isolated from each
other, and travel between them is relatively expensive. In general, I think
that you\'re going to have far fewer racial "melting pots".

Culture, on the other hand, is a horse of a different color (no pun
intended). It is much more likely that cultural distinctions could, and
probably would be flattened to some degree in the Imperium. That\'s a general
rule, but it\'s not going to apply in all cases. Take a look at the
astonishingly successful American entertainment business, and to a lesser
extent the British and Japanese entertainment businesses.

>This could be really ugly, and could go a long way to explain why something

Perhaps, but racial distinctions don\'t automatically mean that things *have*
to get ugly. Keep in mind that the modern notion of race (at least in the
West) is quite different than that which was held in the 16th Century, and
the 16th century notion of race. In the same vein, that conception of race
would also be different from the one that Greeks or Hebrews held in
antiquity.

That simply cannot be the case. It\'s easy to imagine a society in which air,
sea and land travel have been superannuated by cheap and efficient
contra-gravity devices and power plants. It\'s much more difficult to imagine
a society in which the discipline of history has changed its focus.

Indeed, in real life the discipline of history has changed its focus over
the course of the last two centuries or so and there are still those who
criticize its current state as in some way invalid. To take it further,
we\'re heading for a really bumpy road in the next century as more and more
people will be applying such concepts as structuralism and
post-structuralism to the social disciplines.

We\'re *still* feeling the fallout from, say, the psychological approach to
history, and that\'s been around for a century. There are still people who
grumble about feminist historical approaches and socialist historical
approaches. Now there are enough of the above theories out there, and people
are starting to place them relative to each other in the structuralist
approach to history.

I shudder to think of what the state of social science will look like when
I\'m a doddering old professor who can remember where he left his glasses!

I\'m not being critical of the new approaches in social science. In point of
fact, I\'m really excited that I\'m entering the field at such an exciting
time. I\'m just pointing out that it\'s very difficult for many people to
accept the advances that have been in place for a century or more *today*,
and that it would be completely and utterly impossible to imagine the social
sciences several millenia from now.

I think that the lines around the "big three" are much less distinct than
most people on the list consider them. If you use the United States of
America as a model (I apologize to those of you out there who get surly at
the idea of "Yanks in Space", but I can think of few countries that have the
same sort of mixture), there is considerable difficulty in getting most
people to consider themselves "American". Culturally and sub-culturally, the
U.S. is factionalized to the point that walking from one neighborhood into
another, or even from one *nightclub* into another is like setting foot on a
different planet.

Hell, compared to the tradional canon view of the Traveller universe the
differences between two cliques in your average high-school are far more
acute than the differences between Aslan and Solomani. ;)

[As an example of the scenario, the recent off-topic discussion of the goth
movement suddenly becomes on topic! ;)]

Yes. I agree. I\'m working from a model that assumes that the smallest unit
of cultural currency in known space is a planet, or more commonly, a solar
system.

	Used the idea before ... if it can either enhance or suppress
nuclear reactions, it *has* to be able to affect fusion reactions.
However, you might also assume that the fusion plant itself is using
nuc damper technology to even allow fusion plants so small and
powerful. Then you have to decide if a long-distance projector can
overwhelm the local field enough to affect anything. There\'s a
difference between suppressing a nuclear warhead at some distance and
overwhelming a field right inside the reactor at the same distance.

	I\'ve always ruled this was *only* possible at very short ranges,
with powerful projectors. Thus, a highport could suppress the fusion
plant of a trader docked inside/beside it, but you couldn\'t use it in
combat.

I\'m not biased against unions, but Teamsters are STILL just a bunch of
gangsters/mob men.

As to your experiences with UPS, I\'m amazed.  I\'ve had nothing but great
experiences with them with one exception - as you stated, they will leave a
package at your door (or in my case left it in the anteroom to my apartment
complex).

  You actually gain possession of something usefull instead of a bunch
of glowing craters.  If you target the population: anybody left over is
probably
going to be less than thrilled with you.  If you target only the centers of
government/military: you run the risk of killing the people that can agree
to
whatever it is you want from them.  If you target the whole planet: you get
a
glowing lifeless ball. Which is perfect if your goal is to litter the galaxy
with
glowing lifeless balls - less perfect if you actually want usefull planets
to tax
and stuff.

Well if you want to control a city/country/planet somebody has to physically
be there. But if you can convince your enemy not to fight PFC Poppinfresh

Countries go to war mostly to impose their will on others. Unless a
countries
aim is genocide less drastic measures will usually suffice. Having to
rebuild
a conquered teritory and deal with enemies seeking revenge for attrocities
commited is a real drag on the economy and way of life.

It\'s so much easier to convince your enemy that you might enhance their
radiant luminosity if they don\'t accept your reasonable offer of
protectorate
status, and quickly get about the business of import/export, than it is to
actually wipe them out, wait for the ground to cool, plant a fresh colony,
and then start up the import/export business.

This is just the way I see things not holy writ or anything. But it fits my
conception of the 3I (and must other empires/kingdoms/nations I\'ve
experienced.)

A couple of thoughts on this:

1.  Riots are rarely organized.  They tend to occur in the absence of
organisation, and one of the best ways of turning a political demonstration
into a riot is to take out its organisational structure!  Of course, there
can be situations where "mere chaos" is the goal, but even so, I doubt the
instigators of this would really need much of a communications network.

2.  Not all megaphones are electronic.  A basic TL0 megaphone consists of a
hollow cone with open ends, made of whatever material you chose, which you
shout through.  Although it\'s directional, it\'s remarkably effective.

3.  Gimmick devices like the anti-electronics one that I seem to have lost
the reference to above only work when they are a suprise.  A bit of thin
plastic and some masking tape would adequately seal most electronic
equipment.

4.  From what I\'ve seen, well organised demonstrations (or "riots", if you
are on the side of the oppressive government) tend to have marshals for
crowd control, and a network of runners throughout the crowd for
coordination and communication.  In some cases, the bulk of the crowd will
be loosely associated in contingents, too, derived from various
organisations and geographical areas.  This kind of organisation would be
more likely in situations where violent responses are likely to be met.  If
you take out the electronics, you would simply force reliance on the good
old fashioned TL0 runners, and the Mark I sentients leading the crowd.

5.  Invent a better mousetrap, and someone will invent a better mouse.

There\'s an old saying:  Where there\'s muck, there\'s money.  (Best said in a
north of England accent, I think).

I suspect that biomass is sufficiently useful that there wouldn\'t be any
need to haul it anywhere, unless, unless, (my brain just kicked in here!)
it\'s being sold to a less hospitable world.  Hmm, no, I can\'t see PCs
accepting this particular cargo, though.

Since the s-word has been used, I can now tell the following story:
About 10 years ago I was working for a company that produces agricultural
chemicals and _fertilisers_.  There was an unofficial company motto:  In
the end, it\'s all shit.

I\'m surprised the Imperium doesn\'t utilize mass-driver technology on
warships when they need to do pin-point bombardment. It CAN be done, the
physics prove this. Besides, you don\'t have to mess with that nasty Pu (plutonium).

Just ask the Narns.

I recently ordered a computer (Newton 130) through a remanufacturer... they
shiped UPS. It took 4x5minute TOLL CALLS to arrange to get it delivered to
me. It was clearly marked "Signature Required" and "deliver to adressee
only". The driver, upon delivery, clearly stated "Oh, if i\'d missed ya, I
woulda left it across the hall." (I had it delivered to my office.) UPS
will leave anything not listed as valuing $250 or more on doorsteps, even
whenthe weather is bad.

USPS, however, with their 3rd day service (priority? or is that express?)
can and will refuse to release without signature and/or picture ID, will
pick up even from private customers (UPS won\'t locally, nor will FedEx) at
no additional charge, and tracks it just as tightly as UPS.

Ob Trav: How much effort are the IISS-X-Boat staffers required to make to
deliver X-Mail?

true, it is better in the long run, but civilisations
are often very capable of doing things in their own
worst interest, because they think it\'s in their best
interest. For example has it helped or hindered the
USA\'s postion in the world as a dominant superpower to
be so overbearing with Iraq and Serbia? Only time will
tell... and terro weapons I think will always be used,
if the leaders, however democratic and civilised,
think the alternative is too horrendous, eg, the USA
nuking Hiroshima and Nagasaki. I genuinely believe
they would have done the same to Beijing in 1950 or
Hanoi in 1968, if they\'d believed it wouldn\'t have
escalated... ie it was not humanitarian or rules of
land warfare concerns that stopped them, but plain old
self-interest.

The point is, though nowadays we demonise certain
regimes and make out that only they use terror weapons
or kill civilians, it remains a fact that more
democratic nations do it also. Obviously not to the
same degree, and not as a matter of policy, but...

And reiterating what\'s above, in conditions of "total
war", they will do this also. In WWII the Allies
deliberately targeted civilian areas, induced
firestorms (eg Tokyo, Dresden) and so on. If a war
goes on long enough, you either get sick of it and
give up (Vietnam) or get depserate and ruthless
(WWI/II).

Zhodanis occupy capital
Ming the Merciless Missing

182-1107 -- Jewell/Jewell/Spinward Marches

Years of tense and uneasy peace along the Imperium\'s
spinward border gave way to war last week, as Zhodani
forces launched a massive invasion of the Jewell
Cluster.  

In the worst fighting, Zhodani fleet elements,
believed to belong to the 40th and 65th Fleets,
bombarded defense forces on Mongo for more than ten
hours before several divisions of Zhodani troops
landed over fierce resistance at the downport.  Once
the Zhodani troops were on the ground, however, the
Mongo National Guard\'s morale crumbled and it soon
ceased to exist as a coherent unit.  The Mongo Armored
Battalion stood its ground, but was wiped out to the
last vehicle with heavy loss of life, during a
desperate holding action at the palace.  

Ming the Merciless, ruler of Mongo for over seventy
years, is reported to have gone into hiding somewhere
on-planet.  A holovid broadcast over the airwaves
before surrender showed Ming in full battle regalia
promising to carry on the fight from guerrilla bases. 
"I know more about Zhodani methods than an Imperial
baron should," he stated, "that\'s why I was sent to
rule this distant, forsaken rock.  Nivrnditlas\'s
troops will not have an easy time here." (Nivrnditlas
is a Zhodani admiral, but TNS was unable to confirm
whether he is attached to the 40th or 65th Fleets.)

In other action, Zhodani fleets annihilated Emerald\'s
defense forces by bombardment, but curiously did not
land any troops.  Ruby and Nakege fell to overwhelming
Zhodani forces after offering token resistance.  

Imperial spokespersons on Jewell, speaking on
condition of anonymity, stated that appropriate
countermeasures are being taken, and noted that,
contrary to Zhodani propaganda, no insurgent forces,
such as the mysterious Ine Givar, have risen to
support the invasion.

Historically, some races disappear, some get absorbed
into others, some mix and produce new races, some take
on others\' traditions... we, for example, us ethe same
 alphabet as Julius Caesar, but that doesn\'t mean we
call ourselves "Roman"! But identities _can_ survive a

the identity is not fixed.

I think that does seem to be the perspective of canon
Traveller... could be wishful thinking on the part of
American writers, if you ask me.

One important thing I think is language. Languages
evolve, change, and reflect and shape culture. Haven\'t
you heard the phrase, "well, it\'s hard to translate,
but..."? Now print and quick communication will ten to
slwo the development of language, there devolops the
idea of "correct" grammar, and so on, but what
happened in the Long Night? It may be, when they got
back in contact, they couldn\'t speak to each-other
anymore...

It\'s all of them, I\'d expect. An example from the
army: we in the army had a prejudice to the other
services, when they were around... when they weren\'t,
we in the infantry had scorn for the artillery,
tankies, and so on... when the grunts were all
together, 1st battalion had scorn for 2nd battalion...
when the 1st was all together, alpha company laughed
at bravo... etc, etc... and then Corporal Schuant used
to go to his girlfriend\'s place and say, "friggin\'
army, they\'re a bunch of idiots..."

I\'d say that there are likely "laws of space warfare" that the
Imperium, Zhodani, and Solomani adhere to. Probably the Hivers do as
well.

The K\'kree aren\'t likely to hold to them, except for the fact that if
they go up against anybody who *does*, they are already at both a size
and TL disadvantage. Which means they don\'t *dare* violate them because
worse could be done to them than they could do back.

The Aslan likely have *stricter* rules (because they are even more
strongly against damaging "land"), and consider many things allowed
under the "laws" to be "dishonorable".

The Vargr don\'t count because they are a bunch of more or less
disorganized groups. If one of the groups attacked any of the "big
powers" and violated the "laws", they\'d get clobbered but good,
especially since many *other* vargr groups would likely join in on the
winning side.

Well, there\'s nothing that says the Imperium *doesn\'t*.

But there *are* some problems. You aren\'t going to get nuke level
strikes from a spinal mass driver. The impact energy is a function of
the mass of the projectile, and the launch velocity. The launch
velocity is dependent on the length of the driver and the acceleration
it can provide (I can dig up the formula). You won\'t get anywhere
*near* lightspeed with a ship mounted weapon (I once did the figures
for a 1000 km longer mass driver and it only got a few percent of c)

But basicly, you have to supply *all* the energy that goes into the
explosion, plus extra for losses in the mass driver. A nuke doesn\'t
cost anywhere *near* as much energy as it releases.

Also, launch from orbit puts in a definite lag between launch and
impact. This can render the mass driver useless against some targets. 

Nudging "big rocks" into impact orbits is a lot more energy efficient,
but has even *longer* time lags.

Given what they found in the one building when they opened it at the
end, I\'d have to say crew.

(And yes, I\'m being deliberately vague, for the sake of the folks who
haven\'t read this).

BTW, I\'d advise finding a cheap copy (if you can) and loaning it to
players to read. Then have them find a derelict ship or the like. Even
if you *don\'t* include an alien (or *the* alien) they\'ll be paranoid as
all heck.

Hmm. For even more fun, loan one "Who Goes There", loan another
"Alien", and loan a third "Voyage of the Space Beagle". 

Not only will they be paranoid, they won\'t be sure *what* to do about
it. 

ps. I do *not* advise using any of the aliens from "Voyage of the Space
Beagle". They\'re a bit too much. The octopoid critter is just too hard
to defeat, and a coeurl could take on an infestation of Aliens and win!

Well, I\'ve never heard of UPS or any of the other private carriers
having their personnel discovered to have been *dumping* mail in huge
quantities. That is almost a refular occurence with the Post Awful. 

I think we\'d be better off if they dropped the special rates for "junk
mail". I\'d leave the special rates for actual *catalogs* (which is what
it was originally established for!) and even for "mini-catalog" flyers.
But it\'d end all those credit card offers and other such dreck. And by
dropping the mail volume drasticly, I think they\'d actually be able to
deal with mail properly again.

> Ob Trav...Obvious!  Does the X-boat service *ever* fail to deliver
> their messages? 

Only if the ship gets lost/damaged. And I\'d include "message receipts"
in the traffic flow. That is, as messages are logged into the reception
center upon delivery to a world, a "message XXXX received" goes into
the package being prepared to be sent back to whether that X-boat came
from. 

So if something happened, the computers would note that they\'d gotten
one or more X-boats back, but that there was a block of messages that
were overdue for acknowledgement. 

This *does* require retaining messages at each link until they\'ve been
acknowledged by the next link, but that shouldn\'t be a major problem.
And it provides *greatly* increased reliability at a small increase in
cost and complexity. 

And if the messages are stored with some sort of checksum or CRC, then
it also allows for retransmission of messages that somehow get garbled.

> Do they maintain a monopoly on certain classes of message?

Besides official imperial messages (ie mail from the government), I
don\'t see much need. Remember, the X-boat network is supposed to have
*started* much like seberal mail services on Terra. As a way to get
*goverment* dispatches delivered quickly and reliably. Once in place,
they started using "extra" capacity for paid civilian traffic.

Even now you *can* send stuff the old fashioned way. Find someone going
to the right place and pay them to deliver the message. The government
monopoly on thgis sort of "courier service" has grown out of financial
difficulties in the mail system. Something that I don\'t see the X-boat
service having. 

> Are there *specific* commercial carriers of mail and small

I thought that was a form of "speculative cargo"? :-)

Seriously, I expect that there are megacorps that deliver not only
across the Imperium, but even into other polities. And there will be
smaller corps that do sector and subsector level mail and package
service. And not all the smaller ones will have their own ships.
They\'ll almost certainly not have them for deliveries to the less
important planets.

So part of the cargo tables should be cargo containers of "private"
packages and/or mail. Also, there should be provisions for ships going
to out of the way places to have packages or even "letters" consigned
to them for delivery (to an agent or even to the destination).

That last makes for a nice adventure hook.

IMO, this is yet another net legend.  When shipping a handgun, it must 
leave and arrive at an FFL holder\'s address so that it can be logged into 
their bound book, and then logged out when you take possession of the 
weapon.  Unless the person in question held an FFL, I highly doubt Smith & 
Wesson would even consider shipping it.

Ob Trav...

That package the players have been contracted to deliver was left at the 
wrong address.  Now they have to get it back...before it is opened...

I\'ll agree to that one. When placing an order for something for mail
order, I leave explicit instructions: under no circumstances do I want
it shipped UPS. I\'ve had enough bad experiences with UPS that I no longer
want anything to do with it. (Only once did I have to cancel an order
because of this -- "We only ship to Canada by UPS." No thanks. For cross-
border shipping, they are *slower* than USPS handing it off to Canada
Post, and their customs fees are *much* higher...)

Or how about, they\'re delivering something, they don\'t

get it for themselves would cost more than their
delivery fee, should they grab it? But then, they
don\'t hold the licence for it, and the person

The heck with "overwhelming". If you can keep the projector aimed in
the right direction, and the "beam" (or area effect) has the nodes and
anti-nodes we\'ve been told about, then given the rate at which the
*range* is almost certainly changing, you are going to get nodes and
anti-nodes passing thru there constantly. 

So the reactor has to try to compensate for something that\'s boosting
the reaction this millisecond and damping it the next.

Personally, I\'d be tempted to rule that the automatics see this much
instability and shut down the reactor since this would normally only be
seen if the control systems were *badly* damaged or some crucial
component was about to fail.

No, it doesn\'t. I always assumed the damper damped
_fission_ reactions, which are entirely different to
_fusion_ reactions. I am assuming that the nuclear
missiles which the dampers are designed to make
harmless are largely fission bombs; these are easier
to make (at any tech level, just like it\'s easier to
make a knife than scissors) than fusion bombs, and
current fusion bombs require a fission bomb as a
"trigger". This is because fusion only takes place at
very high temperatures. At our tech level we achieve
these high temperatures with a fission bomb. So
damping fission effects would stop any of our tech
level\'s bombs going off; the fission reaction fails,
so the hydrogen/deuterium/tritium just vapourises into
space.

Damping _fusion_ reactions would be a whole different
thing.

Incidentally, in our own sun, obviously fission
doesn\'t trigger the fusion. Instead, gravity creates
high pressure, which creates high temperature, and
makes the atoms energetic enough and close enough for
fusion to occur. Could this suggest a trigger for high
TL fusion bopmbs would be a gravitic generator?
Instead of constant light g\'s, a hundred thousand for
a tenth of a second? Then damping fusion would be a
matter of damping the gravitic generator of the
drive...

If so, can we make directional gravitic generators, to
make a starship explode or implode? Just a thought.

I still hold that the intention of the dampers was
that they\'d damp fission. This, barring the gravitic
trigger, would work on _all_ nukes. And thus, wouldn\'t
affect fusion power reactors! (Though if you had an
old fission reactor you\'d lose power.)

Okay, that is if you assume that the Imperium is going to bombard a planet
back into the stone age and erase all life on the surface of a planet. I
made no indication that this might even be the case.

Let\'s put the scenario in another way. Say you\'ve got worlds which don\'t
want to be part of the Imperium, or who are currently part of the Imperium
and wish to regain their independence.

What\'s going to stop them from doing so? What\'s to stop them from, I don\'t
know, sabotaging their own industrial capacity to the extent that they
*can\'t* pay Imperial taxes? What do you do then, do you drop Imperial
Marines to force them to work at gun point? Do you drop Imperial Marine
Engineers onto the planet, build new industrial centers, and then force the
populace to work at gunpoint?

At some point, if you\'re the Imperium, and you\'re as hardnosed as is claimed
in canon, you\'re going to have to deal with the pontentiality of hitting
civilian populations to make it known that you\'re not going to tolerate such
slacking.

1.) If you want to control a city / country / planet in a traditional sense,
somebody\'s got to be there. The Imperium doesn\'t *want* to control cities /
countries / planets in the traditional sense. They simply want them to pay
taxes.

2.) Yes, and how would you convince the populace not to fight? Propaganda
campaigns might work, but they can also fail miserably. Perhaps a sufficient
show of force might be in order, like, I dunno, hauling in big rocks and
dropping them on select population centers.

Neither does a determined populace. So, we\'re back at square one.

>Countries go to war mostly to impose their will on others.

Well, sometimes it is to do more than simply impose their will on other
countries. It\'s been relatively common for a country to go to war to annex
territory. That\'s not an anal distinction, it is far more than a mere
imposition of will.

It doesn\'t have to be genocide. Let me state again that total destruction

This would be different from the situation in what way after a land war in

Ah, okay. So now you\'re saying the mere threat of rock dropping will be
enough to bring a world around. The only problem is that from time to time a
world\'s going to say, "Hey! You\'re not *really* gonna whack us with rocks!"

Then what happens exactly... start a land war? Or follow through on the use
of cheap and brutal "terror weapons"?

Where do things such as the firebombing of Dresden, the atomic bombing of
Hiroshima and (tongue planted firmly in cheek) the God smiting of Sodom and
Gommorah fit into those conceptions?

Okay, I\'ll buy that much. Rules of space warfare *do* make at least a little
sense in this context. I\'m most interested in the Imperium\'s internal use of
big rocks.

That would precisely be the reason that they\'d be so likely to use them
though. Hauling big rocks into orbit and smiting cities would be just the
kind of thing that Vargr raiding bands might do to extort cash from the
planetary government. It would be even more attractive because they probably
wouldn\'t have a Navy or Army to speak of.

Terror weapons would be most believable in the hands of Vargr (and the
Imperium for handling internal troubles, but I digress).

If such a field could not penetrate an electro-magnetic field then I could
see warships being built with electro-magnetic screens (perhaps the

In this situation "big rocks" have a decided advantage. You can nudge a
rock into a collision orbit, and anybody on world with much of a
telescope can *see* you do it. Doesn\'t take but a few observations and
a calculator to determine the new orbit. And you\'ve got *months* to
watch it come at you. 

And as long as the Imperium holds the "high ground" you can *see* it
come at you, and not be able to do a damn thing about it. And there\'s a
definite deadline as *nobody* is going to be able to stop or deflect it
once it gets within a few days of impact.

I think you need to look into the actual "mechanics" involved in rock
dropping. *Nobody* "haul[s] big rocks into orbit". It takes an unreal
amount of power, even by Traveller standards, to shift the orbit of a
"big rock" so that it\'ll hit a planet *months* later. 

If you want something to hit before there\'s time for a courier to leave
and bring back reinforcements, the situation is rather different. You
are talking about "small" rocks (ship sized) and it winds up being
easier to threaten to drop a "junker" ship on them under autopilot. 

You need *enormous* (and expensive!) drives to shift rocks.
