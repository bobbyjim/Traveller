You forget that a bomb type reaction needs a rather high power reaction
to set it off. A fusion trigger *has* to generate power levels in the
megawatt range. Maybe even the Gigawatt range. It doesn\'t have to
generate them for *long*, nor do they have to be very controlled on a
long term scale. But you need that high power level.

That sort of power level requires much larger than "minimum" size. But
since it only has to operate for a sort period, you get to make it a
lot smaller than normal. 

To put it another way, you *can\'t* set off high explosives with a
match. They need a pretty fair explosion (M-80 equivalent or better) in
the for on a blasting cap or other detonator to set them off. Fusion
bombs require a *lot* of energy to set them off. Whether it comes from
a fission bomb, or from a modified fusion reactor, the energy
requirements are the same.

Personally, I\'m looking for an electronic copy of the "Universal
Declaration of Human Rights". I\'ve got a hardcopy, but it\'s a pain to
quote from. And I\'d *love* to be able to quote from it during some
discussions online. I have yet to hear a complaint about "human
rights" violations by another country by a country that wasn\'t
violating *other* parts of it (for one thing, it lists a *right* to a
job at reasonable pay!)

Don\'t forget that once you turn *off* the enhancer, the black hole is
subject to the old rules and, being of truly *puny* mass explodes in a
massive burst of Hawking radiation. 

Remember though, you\'d have to enhance the force enough to overcome
both the repulsion of the electron cloud, but also the charge of other
nearby nuclei.

But since fission works because the strong force isn\'t strong *enough*
to hold heavy nuclei together indefinitely, increasing the strong force
would stop fission. Decreasing it would cause *immediate* fission of
fissionables (drasticly decrease the half-life foe spontaneous
fission), and cause some stable nuclei to become less stable. 

Note that with regards to fusion, decreasing the strong force makes it
harder, increasing it makes it easier. 

As for the hypothetical weak force damper, at a high level it would
cause all the neutrons in atoms in its area of effect to beta decay,
resulting in a nucleus consisting of nothing but protons! The decay
would also release electrons and anti-neutrinos. But the apparent
effect would be the near instantaneous conversion of matter in the
effect area into hydrogen (protium only! no deuterium or tritium). 

A strong pulse of weak force damper would result in a sort of
fission/fusion explosion of the affected matter. 

Another possibility with weak force control in increasing it to force
matter to undergo inverse beta decay (protons converting to neutrons by
emitting a positron and a neutrino). Result? A bunch of neutronium. 

Hmmm. I wonder if it\'d be possible to stabilize neutronium enough to
use it for shielding on orbital forts? It\'d stop even meson gun fire.

There have been numerous variations on this over the years. What\'s
going on is that the gizmo is ionizing air and the electrostatic field
is accelerating the air! In other words, it\'s jet propelled, only the
jet is electrically produced. Think of the plate as a propeller.

Nice gimmick, but useless in a real vacuum (well, *almost* useless. It
will generate a small amount of thrust simply because there isn\'t a
perfect vacuum). 

This is an example of the sort of thing that could drive players *nuts*
trying to figure out how things built by a newly contacted alien race
work! Great for those little mysteries that keep players wondering.

You\'re right. A fusion /bomb/ needs a lot more power to start than a
mere fusion /reaction/. I don\'t know the yield of the primer explosives
used to set of fusion bombs, but I do know that even a fairly "modest"
1 kton fission bomb has a power output on the order of a million
gigawatts. Yes, that\'s right, 10^15 watts.

I don\'t know how you would ignite a fusion explosive without a power
source of this type. I can\'t see lasers doing it. If you tried to build
up a fusion reactor (of some small size) to this power level, it would
melt long before it was finished.

A few days ago, someone asked what the effect would be of suppressing
the strong nuclear force in some material would be.

If you suppressed it, then nuclei would disintigrate into hydrogen (and
very slow neutrons, which would then decay into hydrogen after a few
minutes). The energy given off by this reaction would be from the Coulomb
force of the protons, which will be enough to make the hydrogen into a
fairly hot plasma, but not hot enough to cause nuclear reactions in the
nearby material. (If there was enough Coulomb energy in a nucleus to
cause a nuclear reaction, then the nucleus would have disintegrated long
ago.)

What you would have is a fairly neat disintigrator, a la Star Trek
phasers. Keep in mind that the energy requirements of such a beast would
be enormous. Phasers were supposedly powered by antimatter, which
sounds about right.

If you could actually /reverse/ the polarity of the strong force, then
all bets are off. You could make as violent an explosion as you have
energy for, and such an explosion could generate high energy particles
which could induce radioactivity on nearby matter.

If you could /increase/ the strong force in a very hot plasma, then you
could induce fusion reactions at lower-than-normal temperatures. You\'d
have to increase the strength a whole lot to induce fusion at room
temperature, but if you could do this, then you could make a weapon that
would slag just about any material lighter than iron for almost no
energy cost. It would be particularly effective against materials that
have lots of hydrogen in them, like people.

You could also make cold fusion power plants that will run on anything
lighter than iron ("Mr. Fusion" in "Back to the Future.")

Yow, you\'d have to increase the weak force 10^35 times to get it to
overcome the strong force (which is what holds the neutrons in their
Iz = -1/2 state)!

For what it\'s worth, I never figured my weak force dampers to have that
kind of ability. 8^) They have just enough oomph to push some marginal
nuclei over the edge, by pumping up the weak force coupling constant to
near that of electomagnetism.

I drew that graphic back in 1993.  It gets the basic point across, but it\'s
fairly rough.  There is a scale error on it, which I must have been asleep
to miss.  As I recall, the 3000 ring marking the central bulge is too small;
it\'s only a 1500 ring or so.  This also means the Zhodani Core expeditions
go a little too deep into the galaxy.  Otherwise it\'s pretty good at getting
the point across -- Charted Space may be big, but our galaxy is a *heck* of
a lot bigger.  Oh, and the Core Expeditions are *scary*.

I keep thinking in the back of my head, that maybe one of these days I\'ll
redo that diagram, and put in the galactic arms now that I have some idea
of where they should go....

	Read Survival Margin, and the Encyclopedia entry on \'Imperial
Letterhead\' again, guys...Norris appointed himself Archduke, based on his
advanced knowledge of Strephon\'s assasination, thanks to those
astonishingly ubuitiquos Imperiallines J6 couriers that were, nonetheless,
still secret...(yeah, sure!)

	What\'s more interesting, in light of the Zhodani Grand strategy,
as outlined in the rebellion Sourcebook, is how much of Norris\' success in
the FFW was actually due to Norris\' abilities as a naval commanderr, and
how much was due to Zhodani plotting?  Norris is clearly a pragmatist, and
with a telepath as a seneschal (Survival Margin) is hardly going to be
anti-psi.  Norris is exactly what the Zho\'s want sitting on their Imperial
flank, a strong, competent leader who isn\'t willing to invade Zhodani
space.

	Also, since clairvoyance is a psionic power that is available, how
do we know that the Zhodani don\'t have some clue about what is going to
happen in the future?

	Things that make you go \'Hmmmmm\'.

Lewis Roberts
Crested Jabberwock
   The Jabberwock was the last uplift project started by GenAssist 
before the Collapse.  The project was started in 952.  The First
Solomani Rim War and the loss of the coreward sections of the Solomani
Rim forced the project to move from the Jabberwock\'s home world of 
Kassan/Vega (A-785757-E circa 1100). Several hundred experimental specimens 
and most of the research facilities were relocated to Alpha Crucis Sector. 
The loss of the the native population wasn\'t a fatal blow, a few Jabberwocks 
had been placed in zoos and GenAssist had stored enough genetic material to 
continue the project.
   GenAssist created the Jabberwocks to be another warrior species for the
Solomani Confederation.  The company had created several other warrior
species from Terran stock, but the Jabberwock were native to a world
with a dense atmosphere. It was hoped that Jabberwocks would be able
to fight on those worlds where Terran species would be ill suited.  
GenAssist\'s primary market was the military , but they also thought that the 
Jabberwocks could be used as guards.  Four hundred kilograms of teeth and
claws is alot more intimidating than the standard rent-a-cop with a badge.        
   The Solomani Military was divided on the use of of uplifted sophonts as
troops.  It was agreed that they would never serve as officers, but some 
thought any use of non-human troops went against the principals of the 
Solomani Movement.  GenAssist convinced a few member worlds of the 
Confederation to try a few small units of Jabberwocks.  
   Pre-sentient jabberwocks are one of the most aggressive species known to 
modern exobiology.  They are also extremely territorial, attacking any 
trespassers and only tolerating others of their species during a short
mating season.  These traits do not make them very social, and had to be
modified in the sentient brethren.  Uplifted Jabberwocks are still very
aggressive, but this aggression has been channeled into several areas.
Jabberwocks are very aggressive during combat and hardly turn down a
fight.  They are also extremely competitive, both in their professional
careers and their personal lives.  They are still solitary creatures and
tend not to engage in team sports, but more likely to compete in solo events
such as races, shooting competitions and the like.  
    Jabberwocks are still solitary creatures but they can stand and even
enjoy the company of others both human and jabberwock.  Jabberwocks tend to 
spend several hours a day alone. They spend this time exploring their
surroundings, practicing hobbies, or even contemplating the universe. Though
their philosophy is very simplistic and tends to be violent.
    One of the few activities that Jabberwocks gather together in large 
numbers to participate in is dancing.  GenAssist turned some of their mating
rituals into a fondness for elaborate dancing.  This dancing is very
energetic with Jabberwocks running, jumping, throwing themselves across
the stage and rearing up on hind legs.  The dance tends not to be a 
choreographed performance, but consists of all available jabberwocks
thrashing around.  The dance was performed for the enjoyment of the 
participants, not an external audience.  Occasionally an few favored people
would be invited to watch.  
     Originally Jabberwocks were bilaterally symmetrical, homeothermic,
quadrupeds, standing about 1.2 meters tall at the shoulder and measuring
some 2.6 meters in length.  Their anatomy is unusual in that they have four
two chambered hearts.  A fully grown specimen weighs over 400 kilograms.
Their head is mounted on a long neck, and is topped with a large
multi-colored crest which normally lies flat, but is displayed during
mating rituals and territorial fights.  Their mouth is full of razor sharp
teeth and spikes run down the spine to the base of the tail.  The skin
is very tough and furless.  Jabberwocks are colored a light reddish brown.
Sentient individuals tend to be a bit smaller, about 350 kilograms, about
2.3 meters in length. Their forepaws have been altered to be manipulative
members capable of using tools.  Their mouths have been altered to allow 
them to speak some human words.  This is very crude speech, and most 
Jabberwocks use electronic translators, but are capable of getting their
point across in a pinch.  GenAssist planned on improving this, but the
Collapse intervened.
   GenAssist instilled in the Jabberwocks a deep loyalty to the Solomani
Cause and to those humans who were in charge of the Jabberwocks.  This
loyalty did not correspond to all humans, for instance a unit of Jabberwocks
had no problems when ordered to help put down a rebellion on Kestral/Spica.
The Jabberwocks also believe that the humans are inherently superior to 
themselves and that most humans are smarter and better educated. If a 
Jabberwock is lost or without guidance it will seek out human leadership.

     Agility is halved when dealing with fine manipulation of objects.
  Skills that use the halved agility include:

     Intelligence is doubled when applied towards Tactic skills.
     The minimum values for education and charisma are always one.
	 The roll for social standing is the standard when the Jabberwock
  lives in an area controlled by humans who are unfamiliar with Jabberwocks.
  Examples include the Solomani Confederation and the Reformation Coalition
  in the year 1202.  If the Jabberwock character was being generated for 
  another time period there might be a different roll.
     All Jabberwocks have a claw and tooth attack which does 1d6 damage
  and has a penetration of one.  The attack is made with standard
  unarmed martial arts rules.  All Jabberwocks are considered to have 
  Unarmed Martial-0.  If a Jabberwock has unarmed martial arts skill,
  calculate normal damage and add it to 1d6.
     Jabberwocks raised in the Solomani Confederation before the Collapse
  have the default skills of Heavy Weapons-0, Slug Weapons-0, Energy 
  Weapons-0, and Dance-1.

  Careers:Jabberwocks use the standard human careers. Some careers are
  off limits do to social constraints, these depend on the exact milieu
  that is being played in. For instance during the Solomani Confederation
  era there were no Jabberwock Construction Workers, Diplomats, Nobles
  or Farmers.
  
  Effects of Age: Jabberwocks use the standard human age charts, but begin
  to age two terms earlier.  By the time of the Collapse there were no 
  known anagathics that were manufactured for Jabberwocks.

  Hit Capacity: Jabberwocks determine hit capacity normally. In addition
  they have a tail location with hits equal to (Str+Con)x2.  

  Initiative: Jabberwocks roll initiative normally, and then add one to the
  roll.

  If not stated differently Jabberwocks are created as normal for humans.

Basically the same as we have already, only you call them Senators rather 
than Dukes?

IIRC, only the Nobles get a vote (10% of the pop?). The Proles are 
brainwashed into obedience.

The most democratic government, and even they have to rely on a degree of 
totalitarianism to make it work.

Challenge 45 presented a Ship\'s Locker which contained the Intership Transfer
Device consisting of 3 parts: the line, the launcher, and the crawler.  To
avoid copyright problems, I\'ll just give an overview.  The launcher propels a
100 meter plasteel cable across the void to the target ship, where a flanged
magnet assembly affixes itself to the hull.  There are c-clips at either end.
 The launcher\'s clip is fastened once the target ship has been hit and the
target-end clip can be used for a more secure connection, though the magnet
has more than enough hold to allow the crossing of personnel.  There are also
four "crawlers" per ITD, which clamp around the line and help witht the
transfer of personnel.  I have used these in my campaigns since I first read
about them in 1990.  Mark Gelinas wrote the Challenge article.  If anyone
knows how to get in touch with him, maybe he would allow the reprinting of
the article here.

There was an adventure.  My copy of Starter Traveller is at my parents\' house
in NJ, and here I am in Arizona.  Supposedly they will be sending all of my
old RPG stuff (only a couple of which are Traveller-related.  For some reason
most of my Traveller stuff has followed me wherever I\'ve gone ;-) ) that I
left there when I moved out (10+ years ago) along with the Christmas
presents.  I think it was related to Tarsus somehow (or at least SuSAG),
though that could just be my memory playing tricks on me.  (Age does that I
hear ;-))  Am I on track here, Marc?  (About the gist of the adventure, not
the age thing.)

With my copy of Starter Traveller here in front of me, I will tell you what
is inside of it:

1. Rules Booklet: This was basically The Traveller Book without the forms,
charts and tables, and with a simplified (vectorless) ship combat system not
too dissimilar from the one in MegaTraveller.

2.Charts and Tables: a 24-page booklet with the charts and tables for the
game in it. This was really useful, as it made running the game a lot
easier. If consideration is ever given to doing a boxed version of T4, I\'d
like to see it done like this.

3. An adventure booklet, done in 8.5x11" format, no cover, with "Mission on
Mithril" on one side, and "Shadows" on the other.

4. TWO copies of the Player\'s handout for "Mission on Mithril"/"Shadows"
(maybe this was an error, and there was only supposed to be one.) These
handouts also appear in the above.

5. A sheet of heavy stock paper with a world map for Mithril on one side,
and the overhead view map from Shadows on the other.

Hope this proves useful to you.

Date: Fri, 6 Dec 96 15:43:00 -0500
From: Fred Kiesche 
To: "Joseph E. Walsh"
Subject: Starships--Got IT!

Joe:

Feel free to post this on TML, my provider (the provider I\'m subscribed via) 
is down at the moment...

I picked up Starships at my FNGS. It ran $20.00. It has a big "2" on the 
spine, if anyone was curious about the big "1" on the spine of the 
rulesbook.

Same size as the rulesbook, black cover, colored paintings front and 
back...107 pages, plus a page of "coupons" to become a Citizen of the 
Imperium or to subscribe to JTAS.

The book is broken into a few parts. Before I get to that, IG has nicely 
credited all the folks who worked their buttskis off on this supplement. For 
example, Joe Walsh\'s Corsair is credited as Naval Architect--Joe Walsh. The 
frontpiece lists all the folks directly involved and thanks TML, XBOAT and 
GDW-Beta.

The book: Introduction, Imperial Calendar, Ships--Rescue Ball, Launch, Ships 
Boat, Slow Boat, Pinnace, Slow Pinnace, Modular Cutter, Shuttle, Gig, 
Scout/Courier (though I don\'t see how the illo matches the plans...), Luxury 
Liner (sideview only), Free Trader, Far Trader, Secure Trader, Subsidized 
Merchat, yacht, Patrol Cruiser, Merc Cruiser, "Pesonalities",Lab Ship, 
Safari Ship, Corsair, Large Armed Freighter, Military Landing Ship 
(Infantry), "More Personalities", Military Frontier Cruiser, Light Fighter, 
Medium Fighter, Heavy Fighter, Missile Bomber...then the "Standard Ship 
Design System" with more tables than you can shake a stick at. Color illos 
by Foss, I think I recognize one from "The Book of Alien", but don\'t 
remember the others. B&W illos by Foss, from the first book and new ones.

Good points: Lots of ships, design sequence, a few "freebies" in terms of 
calendar and personalities.

Bad points: The same old tired ships. Some plans don\'t look like they match 
the illo. No gridlines on the plans, only a "2 meter square" to the side, 
showing relative size of the plan. Larger ships have sideviews only, no 
complete plans for them. 

Highest TL appears to be 12, I think that was one direct question from the 
list.

Lots of "black" on each page. Most of drove the printers nuts!

Rating: A good second try, downers are lateness, relative high price and 
lack of really good plans (I\'m not looking for FASA, but some of the DGP 
plans and JTAS plans had better quality than these...).

Grand Adventure Backstory Part I:  The March Harrier

by Kenneth D. Bearden



Shawn Grey was born on Porozlo, a back water world on the frontier of
the Imperium.  Porozlo has not yet achieved world unity and is
characterized by heated conflicts between its several countries.  From
time to time, Imperial forces are brought in when the fighting
interferes with interstellar trade or Porozlo\'s neighbors.  Since the
Imperium has a hands off policy when it comes to politics on member
worlds, this does not happen that often.  For the same reason, the
conflict is usually exceptionally heated when the Imperium does
interfere.  Shawn has seen the Imperial forces come to Porozlo several
times during his life.    

Most young men who get the urge to join the Marines have many choices
of enlistment.  There may be a Domain Marine Corps serving the
surrounding four sectors and under the leadership of the Domain\'s
Duke.  The sector itself may maintain a standing marine force. 
Sometimes the worlds of a subsector band together for defense and pool
their resources to support a marine force along with an army and navy.
 And very often, worlds will maintain a force as a last line of
defense, as support for customs, and a better controlled arm of power
for itself.  It is usually necessary for a world to be unified in
order to have the resources to support a space faring armed forces,
but some countries on balkanized worlds put enough into national
defense that their national armed forces reach into space.  Porzolo is
such a place.

Most young men joining the Corps, when given the choice, opt for the
best.  They want to be in the best equipped and most elite marine
force in existence.  The Imperial Marines.  But this was not the case
with Shawn Grey.  Since birth, national pride was drilled into him
from his parents, the culture he grew up in, and propaganda from his
country\'s dictator.  Sometimes this is a good thing, but judging from
the conditions on Porozlo, this was frequently a xenophobic, bigoted,
and racist way of life.  At age 5, Shawn was put in a military academy
to prepare him for the time when he would defend his country.  At age
13, Shawn became a member of his dictator\'s youth program.  At age 18,
he enlisted in the only force in which he ever wanted to serve, the
National Marines.

Two years in the Corps, he had an eye opening experience.  It was not
all the glory he had anticipated all those years.  He saw the way his
country treated foreigners, saw the fear they had from other countries
and the Imperium, and saw how the dictator twisted the truth.  And, he
saw death.  

He realized that Porozlo would never be great until the fighting
countries could lay down their arms and their differences and start
working toward a unified peace.  He realized that most space faring
cultures only succeed after solving their domestic problems.  This
wasn\'t always the case, and he knew of a handful of worlds who had
attained greatness without a single planetary government.  Earth was a
good example.  But, this wasn\'t going to happen on Porozlo, not with
leaders like his great dictator who seemed hell bent to keep this from
happening.  

This dictator had gotten him shot.  There was a scare that he would
not live.  Believe it that his eyes were wide open.  A person does a
lot of soul searching and belief testing when he is lying on a cloth
stretcher in a mud hole on some forsaken piece of disputed territory. 
Shawn didn\'t believe anymore that losing his life so that the leader
of his country could control more acreage was a noble cause.  

Lucky.  He beat death, and the limp went away after a few years.  He
was discharged with honor for medical reasons and awarded a purple
heart for service to his country--a country he no longer believed in. 


He was 20 years old.  His whole life was ahead of him, but his life up
until then had been shattered.  He was bitter.  He was wayward, and he
left the planet on which he had been since he was born.  

He made his way coreward to the planet of Aramis.  It is a small piece
of rock with a highly corrosive atmosphere and a wind chill factor of
- -243 degrees.  The place only has one city built in the mined out
veins of a mining operation deep underground.  It is home to 3/4 of a
million people and serves as the subsector capital on the fringe of
the Imperium.  Just over the border lay the Vargr Extents, an alien
civilization of bipeds evolved from the canine.  Shawn still held some
of the xenophobic beliefs of his people, but he was a lot more open
minded now.  "What the hell," he thought, "we evolved from apes."

Oberlindes lines, a freight and cargo operation specializing in the
hub worlds, had received an Imperial subsidy to start a program of
interstellar trade along the frontier.  One of the programs that
Oberlindes initiated in response to this was to, in turn, subsidize
free merchant captains with starships and assign them a route.  The
service was somewhat irregular, but this was better than what they had
before.  

This was dubbed the March Subsidy Program (taken from the frontier
sector name--The Spinward Marches), and a group of 400 ton merchant
vessels were constructed.  The March Harrier was one of these, laid
down on 363-1083 with its first flight on 060-1085.  A vargr captain
was awarded the Harrier and assigned a route along the Aramis Trace--a
collection of 8 closely linked systems.  The vargr had been operating
the Harrier along the Trace for two years before his communication
officer left for greener pastures.  It seems that the officer was not
happy with the financial success of the ship thus far.  This was when
Shawn Grey saw the posting on the starport terminal.  Even though he
had never crewed a star ship before, he had picked up communications
experience in the marines back home.  To his surprise, the captain
thought it a good idea to have a human aboard since they were
operating in Imperial space, and Shawn became the communications
officer on the March Harrier for the next 12 years.

Shawn tried hard to get along with his vargr crewmates at first, but
after working with them a while, he just couldn\'t stand them.  Various
things irritated him.  For one, they made him sick when they ate. 
They would choke down a raw piece of spiced meat and just let the
juices drip down their snouts and stick in their fur.  Half chewed
pieces of food would sometimes spray over to his meal.  Another thing
was their outlandish clothes.  The brighter and more gaudy, the
better.  As soon as they touched down planet side, it was watch out
flea markets and high school band auctions.  And when a vargr got
something that he really liked, he would wear it for days before he
would take it off to be washed.  Biggest of all, Shawn could never
depend on them.  One of them would agree to help him to fix something
like the communications array.  When it came time, sometimes they
would, and sometimes he\'d be on his own.  They basically did what they
wanted when they pleased.  

The captain was no better.  His wonderful business sense ensured that
the ship never once made a substantial profit.  The captain would have
a choice between taking a charter, which would provide the ship with a
guaranteed income for several weeks, and running a one way shipment of
meat.  The captain would take the meat run every time just so he could
get a leg up on the auction at the destination world.  What really
irritated Shawn was that the other vargr agreed with this. 

Shawn knew that the other members of the crew disliked him as well. 
From time to time over the years, a new crew member would come aboard.
 But these were always other vargr, and they would fall right in with
their harry buddies pretty quick.  It seemed the captain had learned
his lesson with his first human.  

Shawn sometimes wondered why he didn\'t move on.  He hated his job.  He
hated his crew mates.  He hated his life.  He couldn\'t remember being
happy since before he joined the Corps back on Porozlo 14 years ago. 
But, Shawn never did anything about his situation.  He just kept the
arguments heated with the captain to remind himself that he was alive
and trudged along year after year.  He was trapped.  He was in a rut. 
He had no energy to move on, and he couldn\'t see a way to escape.  

Of course, in reality, all Shawn had to do was quit.  He could have
tried to get on with a human vessel.  But, Shawn couldn\'t see that. 
He was a little unstable.  The Marine Corps had brought that out in
him.  He just thought of himself as a little hot tempered.

In time, Shawn became paranoid.  It was him against the crew.  Human
against the vargr.  He knew that their dislike of him had grown into
hatred.  He began to see the conspiracy amongst the crew.  They wanted
to get rid of him.  He had heard them whisper of leaving him on a
world or killing him and calling it an accident.  He knew the time
would come, and when it did, he would be ready.    

It occurred to him that if the captain wanted to get rid of him then
all he had to do was fire him.  There was nothing in Shawn\'s contract
that would prevent the captain from doing so.  No, that was too easy. 
The bastards wouldn\'t get their satisfaction if they only fired him. 
Besides, the captain was an idiot.  In 12 years, the ship had never
turned a profit to speak of.  The Harrier just plodded along the Trace
making enough money to pay for expenses.  When any profits were made,
the captain would just plow it back into the ship.  

Shawn, on the other hand, had  been at this for 12 years and had
nothing to show for it.  He had never been given a promotion.  He had
no savings, and he lived from payday to payday.  He was now 32 years
old and felt like he was wasting his life.  Hell, he was wasting his
life.  

Day after day went by until one came along when it happened.  

The captain had been receiving pressure from the crew.  After all,
they were all here to make money and none was forthcoming.  The crew
had been loyal, sticking with the captain through the 20 or so years
that the Harrier worked the Trace.  Many of the crew could have left. 
Some did leave, but the majority of the crew had been with him since
he had received his subsidy from Oberlindes.  In reward for all of the
years of service, the captain partitioned out shares of the vessel to
each of the crew members making them partial owners.  The captain
thought that this may even give the ship the new life it needed to
start making them all rich.  Every crew member was given a piece of
the ship based on their previous contribution to the success of the
ship in the past.  Every crew member, that was, except for Shawn Grey.

"This is it!," thought Shawn, "They are going to make their play."  He
would be damned if he would let that happen.  

He caught the captain in hold.  The vargr was using some crates from
the last shipment that they had picked up on L\'oeul d\'Dieu as a desk,
and he was working on some administrative paperwork.  Shawn picked up
a cargo wrench.  The captain turned to acknowledge him, and Shawn
bashed him in the head.  He kept on bashing him until the tip of that
wet little pink tongue poked out that nauseating snout.  He kept
hitting him until blood matted the vargr\'s food stained fur.  He kept
hitting him until he had bashed the vargr\'s ear clear down the side of
his neck dirtying the captain\'s gaudy costume.  Shawn didn\'t stop
hitting him until he felt his arm ache from lifting the wrench.  

Then he stood there, sweat pouring off his brow, his heart beating in
his ears.  He clenched his teeth until they felt like they would crack
and drilled hate with his eyes through the pitiful mangled form of the
captain.                  

He noticed the blood on the paperwork and hand computer.  The screen
on the computer glowed in the recessed light.  It was not
administrative paperwork that the captain was working on.  It was the
termination record for Shawn Grey.  They weren\'t going to kill him. 
The captain was going to fire him.  The captain had even put together
a severance package for him.  The captain had thanked him for his 12
years of service.  They were in their home port system of Aramis, and
the captain was planning to give the rest of the crew a vacation as he
searched for a new comm officer.  

For a moment, Shawn did not know what to do.  He began to panic.  He
had just committed cold blooded murder on an Imperial citizen.  

Shawn had killed before but not like this.  

Before, it was in service to his country.  He was ordered to do it.  

Before, it was war.  This was murder.  

Before, it was humans.  They were enemies of the state, no less, but
humans all the same.  

And humans weren\'t trash like the vargr.

The captain was only a vargr, a fur covered piece of trash.  

So what the hell was he sorry about?

Shawn got control of himself.  

He thought about it.  This is what he had been waiting for.  If he
played his cards right, he\'d have a ship and a chance to change the
rest of his life.  

He got his bearings.  Having just jumped in system, they were en route
to Aramis with a load of freight still several hours from orbit. 
Then, he punched the ship wide comm, "Ship emergency!  All hands to
the hold.  Repeat, all hands to the hold."

The first two vargr crossed into the hold wondering what that damn
human was screaming about.  Then they saw the captain.  The first
vargr, screaming at the top of his lungs, repeated the order on the
ship\'s comm in his native tongue.  

The other two vargr arrived on the double.  The first two were
hovering over their slain captain.  One of them asked where the human
was.  That\'s when Shawn did it.  He hit the control that sealed the
hold from the rest of the ship.  Then he threw the switch that opened
the outer cargo doors.  The freight itself was fastened to the deck,
but everything not nailed down blew out into space.  

Shawn looked impassively out the port at the vargr bodies, attempting 
to scream in the vacuum of space, then he caught his reflection in the glass 
on the port then smiled to himself.  This was the first day of the rest of his life.  
He repressurized the hold and went to work.  After several hours he had
released all of the ship\'s cargo out into the void with the vargr
bodies and other debris.  

He went forward to the bridge and sat in the pilot\'s seat for the
first time.  The original pilot had been with the ship since day one
and was very particular about anyone else sitting at his station. 
"Well look at you now, you bastard."  A bigger smile cracked across
Shawn\'s face as he glanced out the bow port.  The ex-pilot was
tumbling across the bow.

Shawn hit the thruster control.  The vargr pilot hit the view port
then slid aft.  Shawn didn\'t know much about engineering, navigation,
or J-Drives, but he could pilot a ship in system.  He had done a lot
in that two years in the marines. 

Two hours later, the March Harrier was well away from its previous 
position.  Shawn had put out a may-day.  A system defense boat was en
route from the Imperial Navy base on Aramis.

He told the naval officers that it was pirates.  One had come aboard
as a passenger at their last port and took them by surprise.  They
were forced to rendezvous with the pirate\'s ship then robbed of the
contents of the hold.  

The last part of the interview was what Shawn liked the best.  He had
to bite his tongue to keep from smiling.  

"Why didn\'t they take you as well." asked the Navy lieutenant.  

"They didn\'t take me," replied Shawn, "because they said that I was
human.  They said that if I gave them no trouble then they would let
me live.  As for my crew mates...well...I guess they had no respect
for vargr life."

Planet side on Aramis, Shawn implemented the rest of his plan.  He
contacted Oberlindes who, in turn, sent a subsidy agent to meet him. 
Shawn produced the computer log that the captain had made awarding
ownership shares in the ship.  Although the log was incomplete because
of a magnetic blast that damaged the log during the pirate attack,
Shawn assured the agent that his name was on the log.  Shawn said that
he was a little short of the 20 million credits required as a down
payment on a new ship like the Harrier, and he would like to resume
title of the ship as was his right as the last surviving owner.  

The Oberlindes agent looked at him with suspicion.  "The log will have
to be verified."  

To this, Shawn explained that the log was only established during the
last trip before the pirate attack.  It hadn\'t been posted or
authorized yet.  

"Unfortunate," replied the agent.  "The log may be able to be
reconstructed electronically.  I must say, you are in a very
suspicious position Mr. Grey."  

No.  No.  No.  Shawn had come too far to have this pointed nose little
turd piss on his parade.  What could he do?  What was there to do?  

Bribery.  Yes, of course.  It was a risk, but he could see no other
way.  The bastard.  Shawn was going to use that money to start his new
business.

Shawn made him the proposition.  If the agent would agree to validate
Shawn\'s claim based on the evidence at hand, then Shawn would let him
know the coordinates of 93 tons of cargo floating out deep in the
system with an attached value of close to half a million credits.  Who
would get hurt?  The owner of the freight was probably insured.  If he
wasn\'t, at half a million credits, he\'s an idiot.  And everyone thinks
that the cargo was pirated.  The agent could sell the cargo for 10% of
its worth and still make a bundle.  

The agent stared at Shawn for two full minutes.  He never blinked or
uttered a word, but Shawn could see the man\'s brain working.  It
seemed like an eternity.  

Then a greasy smile slid across the agent\'s face.  "You\'ve got a deal.
 What are the coordinates?"

Yes!!!  Shawn was in business.  He was captain of his own vessel.  He
would do things a little different than that old vargr had done.  He
would assemble a crew of streetwise veterans.  He would find people
that didn\'t mind a little risk if the pay off was worth it.  He would
gather military veterans, merchant men, ex Imperial scouts, whoever he
could to crew the Harrier for its maximum potential.  He would take
his time and find the right people.  Oh, yea.  And they would all be
human.

His plan was to crew the ship with mercenaries.  The Harrier would
derive its income from transporting freight and mail and speculating
on trade and accepting charters as it had done in the past, but now
the ship would also get income from loaning out its mercenary
expertise.  Have gun, have ship, will travel.  This kind of work,
Shawn knew, paid well.  There was a lot of work to go around.  Hell,
look at Porozlo.  It was a scary universe out there.  Times were
tough.  Shawn couldn\'t suppress his laugh.  And there were pirates to
deal with.  In 10 years, he\'d be in his early 40\'s, and he would
retire.  

But then, just like that, his dream bubble was busted again.  A man
from Navy Intelligence came calling.  He wanted to ask Shawn some more
questions.  Shawn could tell that they were suspicious but couldn\'t
prove anything yet.  Maybe he hadn\'t thought this thing all of the way
through.  Was there something that he had forgotten?  Some small piece
of info that would prove his undoing and leave him rotting on an
Imperial prison planet instead of soaking up the rays and a buxom
blond on a tropical paradise?  

Yes.  Yes, there was.  

Oh, shit.  The pirate.  

The pirate that he had told them that had come on board at their last
port o\' call.  The one that had acted as the inside man.  A check of
the records at L\'oeul d\'Dieu would show that the Harrier did not take
on any passengers there.  

The captain did not want to bring aboard passengers to muddy up the
event of giving the crew ownership.  They were scheduled to take a
vacation at Aramis, and the captain wanted to keep it quiet on that
last trip.  That was another great command decision that the captain
had made-- giving up 89,000 credits in revenue just to ensure it is
quiet.  Well it was quiet all right.  All except that last sound. 
BANG!  Right on the head.  What a fucking idiot.

What the hell was he going to do now?  How could he bribe his way out
of this one?  Shawn felt that he just could not win for losing.  He
thought for two days.  The pressure was on because the information
from L\'oeul d\'Dieu could be there at any time.  The system was only a
parsec away, and the Navy might have already sent a message that way. 

Thank God for the bureaucracy, though.  Shawn was sure that was the
reason the information hadn\'t already arrived.  The Navy had greater
priorities than investigating the deaths of a few vargr.  But make no
mistake, the information would arrive sooner or later.  Probably
sooner.  When it did, Shawn\'s life would be over.  Any day, a Navy
trooper or the city policeman could come knocking at his door.  He had
to come up with something.  But what?  How?  

Shawn was walking the corridors of the city thinking of a way out of
this mess when an ad for the Imperial armed services flashed across
the public media monitors.  He still had that little itch about the
armed services.  His experience hadn\'t been that good, but he was also
fighting for a selfish megalomaniac.  Fighting for something worth
dying for was different.  

The ad was promoting a recruitment drive.  A dearth of enlistees had
effected the strength of the Imperial forces in the sector.  Join the
best, it said.  Join the Imperial Army, the Marines, the Navy, or
serve in the Interstellar Scout Service.  

90 minutes later, he didn\'t know why he was sitting in front of the
Army recruiter.  He couldn\'t quite say why he left the Marine
recruiter and came directly here after he had been turned down because
of his age.  Maybe it was because the Marine recruiter had told him to
try the Army.  "Yea," the recruiter had said, "they\'ll take anybody."

Shawn hated the idea of giving up the Harrier after he had come so
close.  But losing yourself on a 4 year enlistment in the Army beats
going to a prison planet for the rest of your life.  Hell, who was he
kidding.  He had murdered five citizens in Imperial space.  If they
caught him, he\'d be probably executed on a prison planet.  Either
option didn\'t sound that good.  He was going to lose himself for 4
years and try to start over after he got out.  The Imperium is a big
place with over 1,100 systems.  He could try to influence his
assignment location and muster out anywhere in the Imperium.  In 4
years, who would care about a few dead vargr?

Shawn mentioned that he had a ship and he perked up when the recruiter
told him about a program designed for people like him.  

"Yea," the recruiter had said, "because of the lull in recruitment, we
have a new incentive program for people who want to join, such as
yourself, but can\'t because of government subsidy agreements."  

Not many people can fulfill their subsidy obligations while serving in
the Army.  The government will grant a waiver of subsidy
responsibilities and provide storage at an Imperial base while an
individual is in service to the Imperium.  

What?  Did Shawn hear right?  Did the man just say that Shawn can have
his cake and eat it too?  

"You mean I can join the Army today, and 4 years later, pick up my
subsidy like it was tomorrow at no cost to me?"  

"That\'s right."

"Where do I sign?"

That next 4 years Shawn saw a lot of action.  He fought pirates (real
ones), went against Zhodani on the wrong side of the border, and kept
the peace when it got out of hand on Imperial worlds.  He felt as if
he had found his calling, and he excelled.  He was promoted through
the ranks, and in his 4th year, they selected him for commando school.
 All of this he knew would make him a better commander of the Harrier
when he got out.  He studied hard, performed well, and groomed himself
for his special plan to make his fortune when he got out.

But the Army had some news for him.  They weren\'t ready to let him go.
 4 months before he was due to stand down, the Army invoked its
mandatory reenlistment clause.  It only happened to about 3% of the
enlistees.  Shawn couldn\'t believe it.  It seemed the Army knew what
it was doing when they sent him to commando school in his last year of
duty.  

"What about my ship?!"

"Oh, don\'t worry about that,"  they told him, "your deferment is
mandatory as well."

He was stuck.  In for another 4 years, and there wasn\'t a damn thing
he could do about it.  He was already 36.  So much for living on easy
street when he was 40.  That dream was just pushed back another 10
years.  When he got out, he was thinking of renaming the Harrier to
the Shit Out a Luck.

Another 3 years came and went.  He commanded a crack team that was
sent into hell holes all over the sector.  He was promoted again and
received medals for gallantry and heroism.  He couldn\'t believe it. 
He had become a damn war hero.  

Then during his last tour, his unit was sent back to Porozlo.  It was
Shawn\'s native country, and it was the first time he had been home in
20 years.  The great dictator was stirring up trouble again, and the
Imperial Army had been sent in to keep the peace.  

Talk about full circle!  It was eerie.  He was back home and in the
military.  Then, it happened again.  He was shot.  Not as bad this
time, but enough to rate him a medical discharge, with honor, 7 months
early.  He left Porozlo the same way he had 20 years earlier, and he
was headed to Aramis.  On the trip there, he was thinking.  Maybe he
should rename the Harrier the Mistress Fate.



Game Information:  Porozlo is located in hex 2715 of the Spinward 
Marches.  Aramis is located in hex 3110 and is the starting world for 
Marc Miller\'s Traveller Adventure.  The March Harrier is the ship 
detailed in that adventure.

GMs are encouraged to use Shawn Grey in their own campaigns as either 
a PC or a reoccurring NPC player nemesis, like I have done.  As 
always, feel free to use any of this information any way you see fit. 
If it intrests you, manipulate until it fits your campaign--this is 
what the Grand Adventure posts are all about.

Long Live Traveller!

DESCRIPTION

An advancement of remote neural activity sensing and psionic helmet
technology, the neural pistol is designed to remotely disrupt brain
activity.  Being hit with a neural gun usually causes unconsciousness,
but can sometimes also produce disorientation, mind assault, or even
death.  Neural weapon fire can be detected at a distance by
individuals with psionic life sense ability.  Psionic shielding
protects the wearer from any of the neural gun\'s effects.

The weapon produces no sound or recoil but does emit an opaque field
of energy.  Depending on the weather conditions (the moisture in the
air especially), the energy beam it emits will crackle like
electricity.  In a dry, controlled environment, the energy beam will
be nearly invisible (like the shifting wave lengths of light on a
cloaking device) and have no sound.  In a wet environment, like a
planet\'s atmosphere, the beam is much more noticeable and emits a loud
electric crack and pop.  The beam is a cone starting from the emitter
of the gun spreading to a width of about 10 meters.

The weapon discharges energy from a bulbous emitter at the end of the
gun.  This gets very hot during use and will glow red after successive
uses of the weapon.  The emitter is detachable and will have to be
replaced from time to time.

The power pack is 24cm long and has a belt clip.  It attaches to the
weapon via a power cord, and the pack can be recharged like a laser
pistol.  The heart of the pack is a high efficiency liquid metallic
suspension battery and fast discharge homopolar generator.  The
generator stores electricity in a rapidly spinning flywheel that spins
at a rate of 50,000 rpm.  All of this is contained in small pack that
can be worn on the belt and weighs only .5kg.

Some armor will defeat the effects of a neural gun.  Only the head
protection is pertinent, but helmets with metal or metallic composite
shielding may negate the effects of the gun.  Soft cloth or plastic
(without ablative paint or shielding) composites are considered no
armor with regard to the gun.



COMBAT PROCEDURES

When the neural gun hits, check to see if the weapon penetrates.  Then
take the number of damage dice that penetrates (normal procedure) and
roll on the table below.

Damage Dice Throw Total	Effect on Target	.
 1-2	No damage.  Nausea felt by target.
 3-6	Disorientation of target for 1 combat rd.  (Make this 2 rds if a
 	natural 12 is rolled)
 7-10	Disorientation of target for 1d6 combat rds.  (x2 if natural 12
 	rolled) 
11-14	Target unconscious for several combat rds.  Roll the
 	same number of dice to determine the number of rds.  
	(x2 if natural 12 rolled)
 15-18	Target unconscious for several minutes.  Roll the same number
 	of dice to determine the number of minutes.  
	(x2 if natural 12 rolled)
 19+	Target unconscious for several minutes and receives damage to 
	the head.  Typically, this will cause the target to bleed from the
	eyes, ears, and nose.  Roll the same number of dice to determine
	the number of minutes the target is unconscious.  		
	Roll the same number of dice again to determine damage to 
	the head.  (if a natural 12 was rolled, double both of these rolls) 

Danger Zone--Additional Targets.
Since this weapon fires a cone shaped beam of energy and charged
particles, there is the chance that others close to the target will be
hit as well.  The danger zone begins at medium range and extends to
all targets within 5 meters of the target.  Roll normal to hit against
these targets, but add 1 to the AV when calculating penetration.  Even
if a target was missed, he may feel nausea.  

At long range, the danger zone is increased to 10 meters around the
primary target, but the additional targets\' AV are increased by 2.


The following is the weapon\'s combat charts.  This is my own 
conversion system from TNE to T4.  If a character wants to hit with 
the weapon, all you have to know is the range to the target and the 
atmosphere type.  Simply cross reference these two on the chart 
below, and you will have the difficulty to hit.

The Grand Adventure Backstory Part II:  Rogue\'s Story

by Kenneth D. Bearden 



In 1083, Glynnyth Connal became an orphan.  He was 8 years old.  The Fourth
Frontier War with the Zhodani was raging at its height across the
sector.  The news came that his father, a sergeant in the Imperial
Army, had fallen in battle against the Zho\'s.  His father had come
home in a closed coffin, the victim of a Zhodani mind assault.  He
watched his mother cry for the first and last time.  She was on leave,
a support officer in the Army as well, and the sight of his mother
crying in that stoic earth colored uniform seemed a contradiction.  

The funeral turned out to be the last time he would see either of his
parents.  10 months later, he was told that his mother was aboard a
Chrysanthemum class destroyer escort when it dove into a gas giant
with all hands.  

Glynn was alone and on his own.  It was something that he would learn
to turn into his greatest attribute.

He was shuffled around to several foster homes.  He was a bad kid and
more than most could handle.  At 14, the local police was already
keeping tabs on him.  Finally one night, he left his last foster home
forever.  He had enough of that crap.  It was time to move on, to be
free.  But he didn\'t run away like a lot of other losers.  No.  He was
better than that.  He was going to do it in style.  Some of the
runaways would hit another town or travel clear across the planet. 
Not Glynn.  He got transport off planet.  They would never find him
again.  

He traveled from place to place for a few years and learned the ways
of the street.  Then, at age 17, he found a home with some kids that
he had started running with.  They were developing into quite the
experts in larceny.  The group was growing into an accomplished
organization that could obtain just about anything in the Imperium.  

Competition from other organizations and heat from the law was
responsible for the metamorphosis that they experienced.  At first a
small time band of lucky kids, they started one of the most profitable
black market operations in the sector.  One of the older group members
had found an uninhabited planet, Feneteman, in the Aramis subsector. 
It was a vacuum world with virtually no population.  There was an old
mining facility on planet that was still functional.  The plan was to
relocate to Feneteman and use it as a base and continue operations on
other worlds.  They would keep the sight a secret which would be their
best defense against competition and the law. 

Within a year, profits were doubled.  Glynn, at age 18, was making
more money than all of his foster parents combined.  Competition with
other organizations was fierce as Connal\'s group ate up their revenue. 
The word was out among the competition to take care of these kids, but
nobody could find them.  The only risk was when the group members were
away from Feneteman.  

For 10 years the group prospered.  They would gauge their success and
be careful not to become too greedy.  They knew that if they got on
the wrong side of the crime cartels then they would be found no matter
where they hid.  For protection, they would pay tribute to great
Houses of Tureded.  Still, they were always very careful about having
the route traced back to their moon like sanctuary.  

Then in 1102, a survey vessel from Ling Standard Products came to
survey Feneteman.  The survey lasted almost two years, and the group
was forced to lay low.  They all took extended vacations while they
kept an eye on the progress of the survey.  Their ex-mining base
turned home was reoccupied by the LSP workers, and Glynn knew that the
future looked bleak.

Lanthanum deposits were discovered, but LSP decided that the find was
too small for large scale mining.  LSP moved to recoup some of the
cost of the survey by selling individual rights to interested parties.
 The population on Feneteman swelled from almost no body to close to
1000 people.  That number of people is inconsequential when you are
talking about a whole planet, but Glynn knew that there would be
no going back.   For one thing, the secrecy of their compound had been
compromised.  For another, Glynn was feeling the urge to go his
separate way.

A few months later, Glynn moved to Aramis.  The planet has a thriving
black market and some of the larger weapon manufacturers in the sector
are located there.  Glynn had been on the planet several times for
business, and he knew that, with the Naval and Scout bases available
for pilfering, he would make a profitable living.  

Two years later, Glynn had worn out his welcome.  The place was just
too small.  He needed room to lose himself, and one underground
city just wasn\'t big enough.  The police had started shadowing him on
most days, and business was not what it used to be because of it.  

He kept his ear in the starport bars and on the street for an
opportunity.  That\'s how he found most of his clients.  In the two and
a half years that Ling was surveying his home on Feneteman, and in the
two years he had been on Aramis, Glynn had spent a fortune.  He needed
a new line of work.  The police shadowing proved that he was getting
too well known to the authorities.  He knew it was time to quit.  He
wanted to go legit before he ended up spending 20 years on an Imperial
prison world.   

He heard about this ex-army commando who had the word out that he was
hiring personnel to crew his ship.  It was said that this was not
going to be just any regular merchant ship, but one with a mercenary
taste for extra credits.  Hmm.  This was interesting.  It was
something new with potential profit margins like he was used to. 
Glynn knew that it couldn\'t be any more dangerous than what he was
already used to.  Most of all, it was legitimate.  Or, at least, it
was the most legitimate Glynn had been since before he was in his
teens.

Glynn met with this Shawn Grey guy and was impressed with him.  He
could tell that Shawn was a little hot headed, but he seemed to know
his stuff when it came to mercenary units.  What he needed was someone
with starship experience.  Of course, Glynn couldn\'t provide that know
how.  But, what Rogue could provide was more valuable and harder to
find than that.  He had the expertise and contacts to provide Shawn
with the type of patrons that he was looking for.  You didn\'t just
find mercenary employment on the monitor in a starport with the cargo
and freight listings.

Glynn\'s argument was convincing.  Shawn recognized what a resource he
was, and Glynn fit his needs perfectly.  Before he knew it, Shawn had
put him in charge of locating other potential crew members.  That left
Shawn free to concentrate on outfitting the Harrier.

Since Glynn couldn\'t fill many of the necessary positions on the ship,
he was made the ship\'s steward and supply officer.  He was also in 
charge of cargo.  A little turned
off at the thought of shining people\'s shoes and bringing their meals,
Glynn objected, but Shawn explained how the position was
perfect for him.  Glynn was the ship\'s liaison to the public at large.
 He was in charge of finding work for the crew the same way a broker
finds cargo for the ship.  What is better than having this person have
the closest interaction with the foreigners aboard ship?  

Glynn could see what he meant.  It was logical.  He would give this
gig a try, and if it was successful, then great.  If not, well, he
would move on to another opportunity.  Men like Glynn capitalized on
opportunity, and this ship seemed to fit the description.  Glynn could
smell a good thing, and he trusted the instincts that had served him
so well over the years.   

One thing bothered him though.  Glynn had worked with a lot of men
like Shawn in his day.  They were competent men.  You could trust your
back to them.  They got the job done, and they were killers.  One of
the prerequisites for a job like that was that you had to be a little
bit psychotic.

And Glynn knew that Shawn Grey was no different.


Game Information:  Aramis is in hex 3110, located in the Spinward 
Marches.  Feneteman is in the same subsector in hex 3104.  The 
Feneteman information ties into the planet\'s info given in the Traveller 
Adventure.

As with everything in the Grand Adventure, you are encouraged to take 
and modify any information or ideas.  Use Glynn as an NPC or copy the 
set up as you run your own version of the Traveller Adventure.

Cool!  My ship made it in there.  Whaddaya know. :)

Er, not quite.  The "Secure Trader" is a new one - one I designed.  But, 
yeah, it\'s still just another variant of the Trader line.  I believe I 
saw a few other ships in your list that I hadn\'t heard of before (at 
least, they weren\'t in CT).

Arrghh!  No gridlines!  :(  That\'s a definite downer for me. Drat, drat, 
drat.

I still don\'t have my copy.  I look forward to seeing it though.

Cool.

This is not a bad thing.  I like the old Traveller ships, and I was 
disappointed that the designs were changed in the Main Book.  This 
actually makes me excited about Starships--I was afraid that they 
were going to use the same ships from the Main Book.

Now, mind you, I agree that Traveller needs new ships added to the 
line up.  It looks, from your description, that they added a few.  
Maybe they\'ll come out with another supplement--an expansion to this 
one--that has new ship designs.  

It\'s a big universe.  There\'s plenty of ship designs to go around, 
but don\'t mess with the basic designs that we\'ve all come to know and 
love.

Sorry to hear that.

Sorry to hear that, too.  Some of us aren\'t playing in the year 0.

It really happened... good timing, since I was going to credit card

Obviously it was not sent by air mail as promied but I guess that really
would have been a wonder.  It\'s also the ugliest "limited edition signed
hardcover" in my collection since I expected it to be numbered, etc. (all
the other I own [Masterbook, Rifts, German Gurps, Earthdawn, ...] were
like that).

On the good side it was not singing, it was not burned and even the damage
from bad packaging was limited to some minor creasing (nothing that even
*me* would complain about ;-).

Now I\'m curious whether it will take until next Christmas to get the first

I haven\'t finished working out the details yet, but in general this will be a
fairly high-level game in which the players are aides to various political

chunk of ethics, some religion (mainly linked to the ethics), and a lot of
wheeling-and-dealing.  It will incorporate what I see as the greatest

some serious politicking in a democracy that is fundamentally divided as to

The colour cover is nice, but not spectactular.  

The ships are generally well-chosen, although I wonder about the rather large
number of small ships (shuttles, cutters, fighters and so on) given that
small craft never seemed to play a large role in any previous incarnation of
Traveller.  (Oh, they were there, all right, but never seemed to be used
either in my games or in the published adventures.)  Ship write-ups were
well-done.  I can\'t comment on the designs, for reasons I\'ll explain below.

The B&W ship illustrations are OK, although I still don\'t like the look of
the \'new\' ships.  But then, I\'ve never liked 50s-retro as a style, anyway. 
(Although I\'m told by an artist-designer friend that it is commercially
popular in some circles.)

The colour illustrations were a waste of space.  I don\'t like the style, and
the artist apparently ignores physics most of the time.  An artist friend
told me that as paintings they were good - nice balance between colours,
visual tensions, and all that stuff.  However, the technically-trained in our
group ended up laughing (or at least snickering).  (Can anyone explain why
many milieu zero spaceships have giant claws?)  

Including personalities was a nice idea.  I might wish that the writing
standard had been a bit higher, though.  I found the character sketches to be
written to about a grade ten level.  (And I know whereof I speak, being in
the middle of correcting grade ten papers this weekend.)  

Including deck plans was a good idea.  Better deck plans would have been
really nice, though.  The ones presented are missing some features (such as
staterooms in the scoutship).  

You\'ve already seen the SSDS, so I don\'t need to comment on that.


Overall verdict: check this out in a local shop before buying it.  I\'m
sticking with FF&S and Brilliant Lances.  Some of my students, who play Star
Wars, were impressed with the \'realism\' and detail of both T4 and Starships. 
Some of those were even more impressed with TNE/FF&S/BL, some weren\'t.

lately are too long or complicated for the list.  The "house rules" and
"March Harrier" posts are recent examples.  Both of these included
excellent ideas and good writing -- but they also break the flow of the
mailing list, particularly when read as part of a digest.  Saving them
also presents logistical difficulties when in digest form.

I propose that in almost every instance, such long complicated posts would
be better delivered via the World Wide Web.  This has several advantages:

- - Space on-list is reduced to a brief description and URL
- - Makes work more readily available to others
- - Makes corrections and expansions of work easier
- - Allows inclusion of graphical material where appropriate

I realize that not everyone has the means or ability to put pages on the
Web -- but for those who do, please consider doing so rather than posting
your next dissertation to the TML.  It\'s also probably the case that one
or more of the people currently operating Traveller-related pages would be
willing to provide a home for good material, if asked.

Anyway, end of soapbox mode, back to whatever it is I do for a living...

I\'ve assumed that there would be some standards and customs
concerning starship and spaceship flight plans, such as:

   Systems with Class A (and probably B) starports would have
   published commercial and civilian incoming and outgoing jump
   coordinates (ie, this volume of space is available for jumping
   into the system, this other volume for jumping out-system).

   Restricted space for military purposes would always be a concern -
   don\'t want that slight miscalculation to get you fried by
   automated defences or over-eager system defence boats.

   Starship navigation databases would have most of this information
   for each system (assuming prior visits, or a visit to the local
   Scout or Naval base - Merchant houses would maintain this sort of
   information also).  Once a ship jumps into a system, it would have
   the current information downloaded, showing additional
   information, such as refueling flight plans to the local GG, etc.

   It would be customary (at least within a single culture) to jump
   into a system \'above\' the ecliptic plane and jump out \'below\' (if
   the physical data were available).  (I would define \'above\' as the
   POV where the main world is orbiting clockwise around the
   primary).

Me, for one!  Well, not democratic reforms, but the idea of democracy as a form 
of government for the Imperium.


  If you look at the Imperium\'s sectors, you discover a very interesting thing; 
about 80-90% of the population is on 10% of the worlds.  If you have a direct 
proprotional democracy (even a proportional-representation republic) you 
effective disenfranchise 90% of your territory.  Taken from a purely person by 
person count; this is just fine, but when you realize that the large hi-pop 
worlds are going to have 100% divergent needs and beleifs from the lo-pop 
worlds, you quickly get into a situation where a sector is dominated by a 
couple of worlds, and those worlds can basically dictate whatever they like to 
the other worlds of the sector.

If on the other hand you have a non-proportional democracy, you avoid some of 
these issues, but wind up with a whole set of new ones.  You could have each 
world with one vote; suddenly Gant\'s Landing, the corporoate mining world with 
a population of 6, is as important as Planet X, the world with 100 billion 
inhabitants.  

Alternatively, you could base representation on some formula involving 
population, economic strength, tech level or even military power.  Or some 
combination of these.  In each case, however, you have the basis for a 
long-term source of strife and disagreement.  "I don\'t like the formula now 
that my world has less representatives than the neighboring world Ocelot V!  
Tey are no better than us - they just managed to get TL12 before we did!" for 
example.  You could put together a somewhat stable short-term re
lationship/government that way, but I think the government would eventually 
collapse into chaos, or drift toward a situation where a very few worlds 
dominated the entire Imperium.

I strongly beleive that one of the main factors for the success of a democracy 
is cultural homogeneity.  Not that everyone thinks the same, but that everyone 
has the same basic overall set of values, assumptions and cultural trends.  In 
a small nation, you can get that easily.  In a larger nation like the US, it 
may be harder to get but can still be reached (though not completely; democracy 
certainly has its problems here).  When you look at a multi-sector Imperium 
with thousands of worlds, at least six major cultural groups, dozens of minor 
races and literally hundreds of splinter societies, a democracy just won\'t 
succeed.  

Think of the problems Russia is having now and multiply them by a few orders of 
magnitude.  Ick...

Besides, if the Imperium was a democracy, we\'d have to call it the Democrium.

Isn\'t your conclusion -- that Strephon still wins -- a little simplistic?  Why 
wouldn\'t common cause among the factions break out into open war as soon as the 
Strephon/Solomani coalition was defeated?

Clairvoyance in Traveller is not defined as the ability to perceive the future, but 
rather distant events.  (I\'m at the office, without my books, so I can\'t quote.  I 
really need a second set.)  I suppose "distant" could be temporal as well as spatial;

I invented a boarding device, but I haven\'t drawn up the patents.  I\'m never going to 
get around to, it either, so I\'m just going to disclose it here and hope that someone 
runs with it.  I don\'t want any percentage of profits under the first $1 million or MCr 
1, whichever first occurs, but I do want 5% thereafter.  And I want it called something 
like the Goffin Iris Valve Harpoon.

The device is basically a spear gun that shoots a very strong harpoon into an open iris 
valve.  The harpoon has four perpendicular stakes that extend upon launch and keep the 
harpoon from going all the way through the valve.  The stakes have electromagnets and 
adhesives to keep them in place.  The harpoon is made of strong enough material that the 
iris valve can\'t break it by closing on it.  The magnets and adhesives are strong enough 
that it\'s difficult to remove the harpoon.  The person who launched it has a code to 
turn off the electromagnets and a solvent for the adhesives.  

I regret that my ascii skills are inadequate to the task of drawing a schematic here.

	I believe that Strephon acted properly in leaving Capital/Core to go to 
Depot/Lishun to reveiew the Project Longbow Data.
 In Survival Margin (pg 7) it says "His Imperial Majesty...Eyes Only 324-1115 PROJECT 
LONGBOW Per project Report 097-112, Incoming Data from Station Gabriel, corresponds to 
priority Zephyr [Personal Attention Required]. Stations Herod, Raphael reported 
silent,presumed destroyed. Data currency indicates constant +1C (lightspeed) closure 
rate, arrival at Meridian 78, Prime Radial (the edge of the Imperium), in 90 years. - 
Pentecost"
	In other words the data concerning the Empress Wave had prority Zephyr and the 
Emporer HAD to go to Lishun & make a decision himself about what to do on the spot where 
he could see all the data.  This was not some spur of the moment decision based on 
Strephons curiosity but rather it met the Priority Zephyr criteria (personal attention 
of the Emporer)  When you look at what the Regency Sourcebook says the Empress Wave was 
doing to the Zhodani (who are probably 100 times more internally stable than the 
Imperium) we can see that he was right.  While it may seem to we 20th century thinkers 
who are used to rapid progress that 90 years is plenty of time to solve this problem & 
Strephon had no need to rush to Lishun to see this data we are wrong.  The 3rd Imperium 
faced what was its most dire challenge EVER in the form of the Empress Wave & Strephon 
was right to leave Capital.  Lets pretend that it is 1205 Imperial, that Dulinor never 
tried to assasinate Strephon, and that Strephon did not go to Lishun to examine the 
Project Longbow data, that as a result he did not understand how dire the situation was, 
did not to enough to stop it, and that as a result the still thriving 3rd Imperium is 
about to collapse like a house of cards before the Empress Wave. Then Strephon would 
have been a bad Emporer.
	The primary duty of an Emporer is to preserve that Empire.  I agree that very 
few things are so dire as to require the Emporer to leave Capital secretly, cross 
several sectors, and personally examine data - but the Empress Wave was.  Strephon was a 
good Emporer who acted entirely properly.  The fault if any was in not having a mole in 
Dulinors entourage who could & would blow him away when he formulated his assasination 
plan.

No, I do not intend to do a prose of the entire adventure.  If I did 
that, our grand children would have to carry it on.  What you have 
been seeing is the backstory for my particular campaign.  Some of the 
Grand Adventure will be stories, but certainly not all of it.  I plan 
to put in game ideas, NPCs, equipment, and all sorts of Traveller 
things.

This is meant as a good thing--a shareing of ideas and game info 
between GMs.  

If you want, I\'ll start marking the posts as long.

Sorry Craig, but I do not agree with you.  I\'ve received too many 
e-mails complementing the things that I have been putting on the TML, 
which tells me that there are others out there who like seeing stuff 
like this.

I, for one, like to see a wide variety of things on the TML.  I\'ve 
always envisioned this list to be "all things Traveller".  I don\'t 
just want to see short discussions, back and forth, about how a piece 
of equipment works.  Although I enjoy this, I also like it when 
people post house rules, like Glenn Grant\'s hit location chart, or 
long disertations, like the recent post (I\'ve forgotten who) on the 
uplifted Jabberwock or Glenn Hoppe\'s jump space theories.  

I want to turn to the TML for a multitude of things.  I like to be 
able to hash out how technology in Traveller works, but I also like 
system descriptions, detailed NPC\'s, adventure ideas, short stories, 
game reflections, and all of the other cool things that have been 
thought up by creative GMs for their games.  Heck, we pay IG for 
things like this, and it\'s free on the TML!

In short, I think the TML has more to offer than just short/quick 
witty retorts to questions.  The TML is also a gaming resource.  At 
least, that\'s how I view it.

And, if I didn\'t think that this stuff was appreciated, then I 
wouldn\'t put the time in to post it.

What is facinating about the TML is the diverse, opinionated, 
creative, and passonate people out there supporting it.  Your vision 
of the TML sounds boring to me.  I\'ve already greatly enhanced my 
game by the things that I\'ve pulled off the TML.  We all have 
excellent game aids that we have developed for our games.  The TML 
should be a place to share those things.

In closing, I want to cite a post that I received, in private, right 
after your post.

Craig, I respect the fact that you seem to not be getting anything more out
of the TML than stimulating conversation.  If that is what you like,
then I think that is great.  But don\'t hinder other\'s opportunities to
get something different from the TML.  My suggestion would be:  if you
don\'t want to read it, then delete it.

>The Zhodani have the strength to defeat the Domain; the bit players do not.

   I\'ll have to review the Imperial fleet deployments in 1117, but I\'m pretty
confident that the combined Vargr, Aslan, and Sword World could defeat the
the remaining Dominion forces.  Remember, not all of Norris\' strength could
be brought to bear against the invaders--many of his best remaining ships
would have to remain deployed against the Zhodani flank, and could not be
commited to the fight until it was too late.

   As it was, the Aslan acting with some Vargr assistance were able to
outflank Tobia and drive well into the Spinward Marches, at one point
capturing the Glisten system.  One can imagine that they would have performed
even better if a good chunk of Norris\' fleets are off trying to liberate
Strephon and bring peace and justice to the Imperial core.

>The defensive forces of each world amounts to 70% of the naval budget.

   And most of those would be non-jump capable ships.  Fine for keeping the
Aslan out of the high population systems (which the Aslan would by-pass
anyway), but useless for defending lower pop worlds.

>Even with all the regular forces gone away, the reserve fleets are almost
>as powerful on their own.

   Not exactly.  While they may be equipped at a similar tech level to the
Aslan and Vargr, their quality would likely be inferior to the Aslan, though
probably much better on average than your typical Vargr.  Sword World naval
forces would be at a distinct technological disadvantage, but their morale
and training would likely be superior as well.

>The high-population worlds, which accounts for 99% of the strength of the 
>Domain, are invulnerable to anything the Aslans and the Vargr can muster.

   But they can be, especially in the case of high pop, inhospitable worlds,
starved into submission.  Even the more habitable worlds would face the
prospect of eventual economic collapse if cut off from interstellar contact
long enough.  

>Until Norris gets the idea to offer the _Ihatei_ land for fighting the
Vargr, of course...

   There\'s where a Vargr-Aslan alliance would be required (with the Sword
Worlds entering into it for the sake of revenge).  In that case, the Aslan
listen to Norris\' offer and reply something to the effect of, "why do you
promise us things that we can take from you anyway?"

>The Outworld Coalition included the Zhodani. In fact, the Zhodani must have
>been 90+% of the Outworld Coalition. That made all the difference.

   So the Zhodani are replaced by the Aslan in the Coalition.  Under normal
circumstances, the Imperial navy defeats them easily.  But these aren\'t
normal circumstances.  Norris is being forced to fight with two hands tied
behind his back.

   The Aslan seem to have no trouble fighting against a common enemy, have
superior morale and training, and have a warrior ethic which says that you
win the war, then settle down with your family in peace.  Also, I would
expect that they would "live off the land", living on half rations when they
have to and using captured human starports for repairs, and even ships and
weapons if it comes to that.

>No, of course not. That\'s the way the storyline was written. But aren\'t

   Part of the fun of constructing a "what-if" scenario is to build one that
is believable.  There are just too many problems impeding Norris for him to
have even give serious consideration to sending a large expedition into a
fight across the Corridor and on to the main portion of Imperial space.

   Brzk in a face-to-face meeting perhaps, but Margaret may have denied him
in hopes of co-opting his supporters.  My general impression is that when it
comes to politics, she was as capable as anybody of playing rough.

   Emperor Strephon was AWOL on the day of the killings.  The fact that he
would allow a double to stand in for him in a meeting with one of the half
dozen most powerful nobles in the Imperium, and one with which he apparently
was having some difficulty with, tells you something of how corrupt the
Imperial family had become, or just how incompetant Strephon really was in
the end.

[etc]

There are a lot of problems with this romantic notion of boarding a ship by
grappling it with a cable. If I understand correctly, the problem under
consideration is: "how do you board a ship when you can\'t match vectors
with it?" But this situation rules out the use of grapples. Grappling with
a ship that is on a different vector - and *trying to ride the cable over
to the ship* would an insane thing to attempt. The relative velocity of the
two ships had better be very small. Otherwise it\'s like trying to lassoo a
747 as it passes overhead. If the vectors are close enough to allow
grappling, then you\'ve nearly matched vectors already and you might as well
finish the job, and thus make your life easier and not as short.

Further, the ship you\'ve grappled better not have any remaining operational
maneuvering thrusters. Any acceleration, deceleration, or attitude change
is going to have *interesting* effects on anybody dangling from a cable
attached to the ship.

And since we\'re presumably talking about a ship that has been half-trashed
in battle, it\'s logical to assume that they have lost attitude control
entirely. Rappeling over to a grappled semi-derelict that is spinning and
nutating and slowly precessing would be a great way to commit suicide. (For
reference: I assume you\'ve all read or seen _2010_?)

Maybe it would help if we anchor the cable to the pirate ship? Better be a
bloody strong cable. I can see it now: the grapple is secured to the
rotating half-dead 1000-ton cargo ship, the pirates are playing out all the
cable they\'ve got, several hardy lads are zooming along the slack line (in
bandanas and eye patches, gripping knives in their teeth) as the stricken
vessel slowly wraps the cable around itself, when suddenly... TWANG! The
cable goes taught, and.... uh... oooh... um... It\'s been nice knowing you,
lads. :)

Aren\'t the energy requirements the same (in theory) as for non bomb fusion?
Why do bomb fusion require more energy? We\'re not using our fusion reactor
to generate electricity to power the fusion detonation startup, we\'re using
the fusion reactor to start a fusion reaction for bomb use and by
definition the min size fusion reactor can do that (well, not the Fusion+
ones).

Am I missing omethin here? (obviously)

"Democracy" is "everybody votes on everything". And it\'s impossible on
that scale. What folks are *calling* a democracy is actually a
republic. Representatives of "the people" make the decisions. The US is
a democratic republic.

Nope. It\'s similar to what we *used* to have in the US. before 1912
Senators were not directly elected. Either the state governor or the
state legislature appointed them.

Space is *huge*. The odds of an accident caused by a ship jumping in
too close to another are *really* small. 

Also, if we go with the (common & reasonable) idea that ships keep
their vector when jumping (that is, they have the same velocity and
momentum before and after jump) then you\'ll have *multiple* areas. Each
chosen for a particular jump so as to minimize the amount of velocity
matching required at the other end. 

Remember, "keeping" the vector means that it\'s the same with respect to
any given point you use as a base. So you have a several hundred km/sec
difference between most stars. Plus orbital velocities.

They\'d either be *inside* the 100 diameter limit, so a jump wouldn\'t
get you too close, or outside it, and well away from the normal entry
exit points.

This causes problems if you conserve velocity. And it\'s not really
necessary.

If Startships (the book) is supposed to be used in the year 0 campaign this
is definately a bad thing. If the Imperium was ran by old anagathics crazed
Vilani farts I might believe in the same ship designs for 1000 years but
otherwise=8A

Also those of us who have everything ever produced for Traveller (mor or
less) it is boring to buy the same old deckplans all over again.

If you had Clairvoyance, one set would do, but then you might possibly

Thank you, Dominic.

As for the time, I think I\'ve got a time problem on my computer.  A 
few months ago, somebody said that the time was off.  I went in to 
control panel (windows) and changed it.  Now, low and behold, it\'s 
off again.  Maybe I\'m doing something wrong.

stuff I\'ve put into the Grand Adventure posts, but two of you have 
expressed concern.  I thought it prudent to clarify what the Grand 
Adventure is.

It\'s simple, really.  I\'ve got a lot of background stuff on my 
current Traveller campaign, and I\'m shareing it with you.  

I\'m into epic stories.  My last D&D campaign ran 5 years with the 
same players.  I was tired of role playing after that, but I knew 
that I was going to play a Traveller campaign after that.  For the 
next 3 years, I diddled around with things for my campaign.  Last 
year, I started it.  Sometimes I am inspired by a night\'s gaming, and 
I "novelize" what happens in a short story and mail it out to my 
players.  They eat this up, and I like being creative in this manner.  

Consequently, I have a lot of stuff to share.  I\'ve adopted many 
things from people\'s web sites and the TML, and, in most cases, they 
have greatly improved my game--whether it\'s NPCs that I don\'t have to 
make up or rules I never thought of or bothered with.

Each Grand Adventure post is intended as a gaming resource.  I 
encourage GMs to take what they want from the posts, manipulate it, 
and make it fit your own campaigns.

So far, there have been 4 posts.  The first is an introduction to the 
Grand Adventure and an expected time line for the different 
campaigns.  I don\'t think you have to worry about me spoiling all of 
these adventures.  We\'ve been playing a year now, and we\'re not 
through with the Traveller Adventure yet.  I expect it will take 
years to complete what I\'ve laid out.  Many of you still won\'t be on 
the TML.  Heck, I don\'t know if I\'ll still be on the TML.  And, 
there\'s always the possibility that the entire 23 year (game year) 
adventure will not be finished (although, it\'s a good bet, judging 
from my 5 year D&D game).

The second and third posts are detailed NPC/PC backgrounds--Shawn 
Grey and Glynn Connal.  At the end of the posts, I list game 
information like where the planets are mentioned in the prose, 
character stats, skills, etc.

Their stories also link in as background information on the Grand 
Adventure, but GMs are encouraged to use these NPCs in anyway they 
see fit.  Need a fully detailed and fleshed out NPC?  Well, here you 
go.

The last post, post #4, is a home grown weapon.  It\'s a TL 16 neural 
pistol based on the one mentioned in MT.  There\'s complete stats for 
the weapon, rules for its use, and even a table to give you the hit 
difficulty (converted to T4, naturally).

What do I plan to do in the future with the Grand Adventure?  Well, 
more of the same.  More NPCs, system details, equipment, short 
stories, adventure ideas, rules, and a plethora of other Traveller 
stuff, all free, here on the TML.

The Grand Adventure is a grab bag of gaming supplements.  Take what 
you want, ignore what you will.  It is there if you want it.

I hope this clears up any confusion.

I was told once when I posted a long message that including the word (LONG)

lot of time to read stuff that they may want to save the message for times

I certainly agree with this point.  Using Earth as an example, the
volume of space around 100 diameters (+/- 1 diameter; I don\'t know
what kind of tolerance a jump drive requires...) is about 65e15 cubic
kilometers!  Gee, if I\'d done the math first...

> >    Restricted space for military purposes would always be a concern -

Don\'t military ships also try for the 100 diameter limit when jumping
in and out?  I still think that some sort of reserved volume would be
in place, so that:

   1 - supposedly \'outbound\' ships heading for the 100d mark aren\'t
       mixing in with military fleets - too much opportunity for
       mischief.  This would probably be handled by the local
       starport traffic control with little trouble.

   2 - ships jumping in-system would also not be mixing with military
       ships, I personally would tend to be trigger happy when an
       (as-yet) unidentified civilian ship shows up in the middle of
       the fleet staging area...

I agree; somehow I was thinking that ships were jumping in-system
much further out than 100 diameters.  Jumping in that close makes
this idea not too useful.  Even with unknown systems, if an enemy
knew that you tended to jump in above the plane, then that would give
them that much more information to track you...

I think we, the existing Traveller fanatics, need to keep something 
in mind.... Marc Miller\'s Traveller, Starships and the upcoming books 
are not being written just for us.  They are being written for the 
new blood that the system has to attract in order to continue being 
published.  All of us have alot of "canon" material to draw from and 
convert to the new system.  The new player doesn\'t have enough 
information or any reason to use TL13+ stuff if it was included.  Why 
confuse them?

I will join all of you, however, in hoping that as T4 is developed 
through future supplements, adventures, JTAS, and other licensed 
products, all the things that we wish for and desire will be 
provided.   Maybe even to our mutual satisfaction.  Well, I can dream 
can\'t I?

Agreed.  In the old SPI game Universe, ships had to get completely OUT of the
ENTIRE SYSTEM\'s gravity well, meaning there were basically 2 jump points.  It
made defending a system a heck of a lot easier, knowing exactly where these
psionically "jumped" ships HAD to appear. . .

Hey!  Another \'Scaper!  Which store do you go too?  I used to live at South,
but I live in SF now so I go to the one on Divisidero.

I got a great haul out of the Palo Alto  store.. last time I looked they had
3 or 4 Black Boxes sitting around for about $8.

None of the ships has the same deck plans as in CT. The scout ship is
similar (It\'s still roughly triangle shaped) but it has a HUGE engine
room, no bridge (a cockpit instead), and no air raft. It also has a fair
amount of unlabeled empty space (staterooms?).

None of the ships has iris valves, altho it\'s hard to tell this for
sure; the deck plans aren\'t very detailed.

Production values in T4-2 look pretty good. Artwork is nice (and lots of
it). I just bought it, so I haven\'t noticed whether there are any typos.
The deck plans don\'t have the same well-thought-out detail of the best
of the old CT plans (in "Safari Ship", "Signal GK", or "Death Station").

Many of the ships look inconveniently laid out, like they were designed
by Frank Lloyd Wright instead of by someone who wants to live in them.
They all have an artistic flair; they are somewhat more stylish than
their CT counterparts ---- more like you\'d see in a sci-fi movie.

Anyone have a copy of "Traders and Gunboats" they want to sell me?

I finally got a look at starships - at my FLGS - and it does use the same=
=20
ships as in T4, plus others.  That is to say, it\'s got some of the same=20
ship TYPES we\'ve always had (scout/courier, patrol cruiser, free trader,=20
etc.) but they are designed differently in appearance and of course also=20
in detail since they\'re designed to TL12 at the most.

That\'s good, for the reasons you state.

The bad thing about the book, in my opinion, is its lack of traditional=20
deckplans.  The deckplans don\'t have hex grids, so they\'re not all that=20
useful for boarding (unless you draw your own hex grid on it, or pull out=
=20
a ruler and use that to determine distance and movement during boarding=20
actions).

The color picture of what appeared to be a damaged "mech" bothered me,=20
too (one of the Foss illos).  I\'ve never associated mechs with=20
Traveller. =20


> Also those of us who have everything ever produced for Traveller (mor or

Yup.

It\'s not really _energy_ that\'s the problem, it\'s _power_, and the fact
that the temperatures required for thermonuclear fusion are well above 
the boiling points of any known or likely substance.

You can have the same billion megajoules of energy output over decades
(megawatts of power) or a couple of milliseconds (Umptillions of megawatts)
You want the slower, controlled rate for reactors, so you don\'t heat up the
local humans and their stuff faster than they can use or get rid of it. In
a bomb, of course, you want to do as much vaporization of humans and stuff
as possible. In the bomb trigger, you need to heat your hydrogen to the
point where a few nuclei will fuse, faster than you vaporize the bomb and
its components. 
By the time you get a fusion reaction going hot enough and fast enough to
set off a bomb, it might as well _be_ the bomb... sort of like setting of a
charge of dynamite using dynamite for the blasting cap.

Yeah, I guess you\'re right.  The stuff provided will probably be plenty 
for the casual gamer; the rest of us can use SSDS to design our own 
ships, and draw our own deckplans.  

I\'m gonna try not to be down on Starships.  I\'ll focus more on the design 
system aspect, since that\'s really the part that\'s aimed at us 
old-timers.

Sorry Ken, but this "Backstory" is USELESS or at least USER-UNFRIENDLY to
me, and apparently Craig. Be considerate. Put it on a web page, and
announce it on the list; email it to those interested but without web
access...

In short, be considerate of the whole of the list constituency, not just
those who pat you on the back.

OTOH, I did like your House Rules posts... just not 12 screenfuls of
backstory that I have 0 (ZERO) use for.

Not wanting to start a flame war or anything, but how do you two know that
you represent the majority of the list.  I for one enjoyed reading over the
bakcstories, and am looking forward to seeing more of the Grand Adventure.

I actually plan on utilizing some of the ideas presented in the backstories
in my Traveller campaign.

Thanks

In my game, vaccsuited boarders use a smallcraft to get close enough to the
prize to see a crowd of shotgunners/gauss gunners/laser gunners/etc and
waste them first. In the _Antelope_ game, the characters are essentially
military, operating under a Letter of Marque. This gives them access to
harder armor.

I finally got a look at starships - at my FLGS - and it does use the same 
ships as in T4, plus others.  That is to say, it\'s got some of the same

etc.) but they are designed differently in appearance and of course also 
in detail since they\'re designed to TL12 at the most.

I got mine on Friday.

My quick take on the book:

SHIPS: Most of the same old-same old types. I liked the new Destroyer -- it
_will_ be in my game. The Royal-class liner won\'t, for a while (my M0 game
is a _dangerous_  place, and the inner worlds aren\'t really secure yet)
Sorry, Lewis.:) Joe\' rest assured that the Secure Trader will be in my game
- -- thanks! What? No Carriers for the fighters? I guess I\'ll have to send my
5,000t carrier design to IG for the next book :)

SMALL CRAFT: I liked the fighters. My Sylean "space control groups" now
have the firepower to carry out their missions!

DECK PLANS: No Grid? YAAARRRGGGHHH!!!

EXTRAS: The Imperial calender is a waste of space . . . But the Holiday
List isn\'t. Now we know . . . . I\'m a little peeved that the Imperium had
gone to a "Oneday Holiday" scheme like the US has for most national
holidays. The NPCs given are nice, but shouldn\'t they have been tied into
the ships more closely?

SSDS: My quick flash on SSDS is that it takes a lot of the detaily
decision-making out of the FF&S, and it looks pretty good. HOWEVER: the
5000t hull limit is annoying if your game needs larger ships (mine is
designed around a 5000t upper limit). I _really_ liked the line under
Automation Levels that "In the \'New Era,\' . . . automation level is low due
to computer viruses," being "really into" the New Era and Reformation
Coalition.


The bad thing about the book, in my opinion, is its lack of traditional 
deckplans.  The deckplans don\'t have hex grids, so they\'re not all that 
useful for boarding (unless you draw your own hex grid on it, or pull out 
a ruler and use that to determine distance and movement during boarding 
actions).

I use squares, so the lack of a hexgrid isn\'t really a problem for me.

The color picture of what appeared to be a damaged "mech" bothered me, 
too (one of the Foss illos).  I\'ve never associated mechs with 
Traveller.  

Well, the "mecha" might just be an Ancient artifact or something.

> Also those of us who have everything ever produced for Traveller (mor or

I don\'t have everything for CT or MT -- I _do_ have all the TNE stuff, so
_for me_, this book was worth it.

Oh, sorry.  It\'s that Greg Porter is working on right now.  CSC is heavy 
on vehicles and "other" equipment.  Emperor\'s Arsenal is the book that 
will have a huge selection of weapons and armor.

I don\'t have any further details other than a report that Greg is "about 
half finished" with it at this point (but that doesn\'t count editing, 
typsetting, layout, graphics, and printing), and that it is scheduled for 
"first quarter 1997."

The TL 12 refers to the highest tech of the predesigned ships - they\'re 
for M0, in other words.  However, SSDS goes to TL 16...so you can make 
your own Milieu 1100, 1200, etc. ships. :)

Hmmm.  I didn\'t look closely enough at the Destroyer when I was looking 
at the book at my FLGS, obviously.  I\'ll have to take a closer look 
whenever the USPS finally gets my copy to me. [sigh]

Cool! :)  I designed that as something I know MY players would love for 
their characters to own (it compares well enough to the Corsair, and it 
does well against the other ships in its class).  I was hoping my 
campaign flavor wasn\'t that far out of line with that of others\'. :)

Yah. :(  BIG goof-up, there.

Ooop.  I meant "square grid," rather than "hex grid."

True.  We can always come up with rationalizations for the Foss art. :)

I think you\'ve entirely misunderstood my intent.  I too highly value the
long and complex material you and others are making available to others
via the TML.  I get a *lot* more out of the TML than "stimulating
conversation."  My point is merely this:  A message containing three lines
of the form "I\'ve developed house rules on XYZ, see <URL> for the
details." conveys *exactly as much* information as a 150-line post
containing the rules themselves.  For you compugeeks, I\'m merely
advocating call-by-reference rather than call-by-value.

In the digest form of the TML, it\'s difficult to skip past a long message
which does not concern you.  Also, a Web-based version of a TML
contribution can be corrected or enhanced without requiring more than
minimal TML bandwidth for the relevant announcement.  These are my only
concerns; I\'m *very* sorry if anyone got the impression I didn\'t like the
*contents* of the long/complex posts.  My sole suggestion concerns how
they should be *delivered*.

Traveller (Azhanti High Lightning etc.) are designed like Japanese WW2
Carriers rather than US ones!

What do I mean?

Well, the Japanese didn\'t spot their planes on the decks like the US did
*and* used the internal hangar space inefficiently, severely reducing the
actual number of aircraft that they could carry compared to similarly sized
US carriers.

In other words, why don\'t Imperial Carriers carry most of their fighters in
*external* racks rather than all internally. Also, with Thruster plates
(rather than HePlaR), which go to full speed and (as I understand it) don\'t
have accel (they do 6G as a *speed* rather than as an accel) and a zero-G
environment, there\'s no real need for a steam catapult equivalent, you can
launch directly from the hull with little adverse effect. Internal Hangar
space is for maintenance and repairs.

This means that carriers can have *far* larger complements of fighters than
are normally allowed for. It also makes them more vulnerable, as the
fighters are in place of offensive weapons. But Carriers operate as part of
a CVBG, and only have *defensive* weapons - the fighters are their offense!

Seems that we have more Vilani conservatism here!

This same argument can be used for the whole Nuclear Damper line, the whole
"What if Virus never happened" line, the whole "designing alien critters"
line, etc. etc. etc.  It seems to me to be a simple matter of opinion.  Let\'s

Since it\'s damaged, maybe it shows why the Traveller universe doens\'t have

One problem that leapt out at me as I read you post was you are making the
fighters\' "roost" a very tempting target.  Since the majority of the
docking/pilot access gear is *outside* the CVs hull, it isn\'t defended by
armor, and, as any BL player will tell you, surface hits scour away things
like docking rings and external grapples like a sandblaster.

Picture the scene as the Approach Control Officer of the CV Boyington tries
to deal with returning fighters, telling them that the ship is fine, just
that 2/3rds of the "landing area" is gone!

It wouldn\'t even require a heavy effort... one CE/DE getting through and
blasting away with lasers from a decent range.  Of course, the Carrier could
hold some fighters back, but then you\'ve lost the advantage of the increased
numbers anyway.

The reason that US Carriers tended to steam with planes on deck during WWII
was that we had far more planes than ships!  It\'s a lot easier to build a
F4-F Wildcat or F4-U Corsair than the ship to carry them.  We got used to
doing it that way, so now the Navy keeps most of the birds parked on deck
when possible.

heh.  I was watching ITN the other night, British Parliment was discussing

using it should have to pay Britain!  They\'re Heeeerrreeeeee!!!!!!

The film at least is real enough,  I\'d like to get a hold of it.  I once talked to someone
over the \'net who said that the Brown\'s patents are real and online somewhere called 
KealyNet (I think).  The Kealy site looked like a bunch of whacko stuff mostly, and
forgot about it until just now.  

I still have reason to believe that this invention was real.  I used to live in Nevada.  I\'m not
talking about area54 either.  Don\'t get me wrong, I don\'t believe in little green men or
ufo\'s as depicted recently in "Dark Skies" (horrible show by the way). 

However, if I insisted that the killing you part of my post was true, nobody would believe
me because I\'d insist on not telling you what I may know. So I won\'t insist  ;)

That WEIRD "sky-train track" thing doesn\'t even rate as pulp SF art!  I
think Bizarre sums his work up nicely.

Actually some of it is quite nice, but you are right Traveller it is not!

To put it another way, you *can\'t* set off high explosives with a
match. They need a pretty fair explosion (M-80 equivalent or better) in
the for on a blasting cap or other detonator to set them off. Fusion
bombs require a *lot* of energy to set them off. Whether it comes from
a fission bomb, or from a modified fusion reactor, the energy
requirements are the same.


But we are talking about an advanced way of setting it off.  Youre modifying the binding
forces in the nucleus of the atom.  This takes only a small amount of energy.  It\'s an
improvement over an older, more energy intensive method.

For instance, the energy cost of sending a message to the other side of the world
depends upon the tech level you live in.  If you live in the 17th century, the energy cost
is astronomical, but today it\'s a few cents.  Heck, if you figure in my monthly charge for
internet access my charge for sending a ~100kbyte file across the world is about 
0.000565 cents (allowing for 1 minute of transmission time)!  In the 17th century it would
have cost very much more than that to send the same amount of data.

Indeed a closer analogy would be the size of a 100kw fission reactor.  Before the
Russians built a 100kw fission reactor utilizing Thermionic Diodes (TD) to convert the
heat given off directly to electricity, the reactors were much larger.  The size of the
reactor and its support systems dropped dramatically.

Oh, and remeber that it was once proven that man could not achieve powered flight, and
the premier scientific journal of the day refused to believe that it was possible up to 
two years after it had happened.  

Physicists to some degree refuse to believe that potentials (which make up the ZPF)
have any effect upon particles, even though it\'s been experimentally proven since 1958.
If some people refuse to believe that fusion enhancer devices can be used as 
a fusion initiator in a fusion bomb, that\'s fine.  Just because it\'s more advanced than
the systems being used elsewhere, doesn\'t imply that it cannot work.

Not allowing a technology to work in your universe is your prerogative, however other 
people may want to use the idea.  I think that it should be given as an alternative 
technology, much like is done in FFS, giving an explanation of what the pro\'s and
con\'s of using that tech in your universe.  Personally I like the idea (oh reeaallly..).
In my own universe, I have another power technology that appears after anti-matter
plants, in which a device pulls power straight out of the ZPF.  I don\'t know exactly 
how it works (if I did it wouldn\'t be SciFi), but it is a perfect power source.  It doesn\'t
require any fuel, and has no moving parts.  It can be shrunk to the size of a watch
battery, or made big enough to power a battlestar.  It does have certain disadvantages.
If it takes severe damage to it\'s regulation circuitry, it either explodes or causes a
random space-time fluctuation that can do almost anything to a small area immediately
around it.  A ship could be thrown foreward or backward in time, be instantaneously 
transported X lightyears away, or any number interesting things.

Well...

1)  It\'s art, and that means some are gonna love it, some are gonna hate 
it, and most won\'t care.  That\'s the nature of the beast.

2)  It\'s a radical change in Traveller\'s "look," so most of us oldtimers 
are gonna be predisposed to disliking it.  Most people don\'t like change 
(me included).

3)  My own opinion of Foss\' artwork is that it\'s interesting to look 
at, and certainly visually appealing, but it\'s just not Traveller.  I can 
live with it, though, since I care far more for the text associated with 
RPGs than for the art (although I certainly respect the fact that for 
others the art is far more important).

Your talking about the "Electric Wind", and various machines have 
been designed on this principle that never made it to a full scale version.
However, this device was tested in a vacuum, after being accused of using
the electric wind phenomenon, thus nullifying that argument.

To quote the same artice on the electric wind possibility:

	"Many scientists and engineers have witnessed _these flying discs_.
             Their opinion has been, generally, that the motive force propelling 
             them was one which is often called "electric wind".  Few, if any, up
             to now, have believed the Brown discs were propelled by the new 
             principle Biefeld or Brown had discovered.
		Though Brown did not agree, there was little he could do 
             until he went to France.  There he "sailed" some of his discs in a 
             high vacuum with singular success.  Not only did the discs fly more
	 efficiently, but as there was no air present there could be no "electric
	 wind"".

By the way I once saw an illustration of a proposed electric wind propelled
aircraft in a book.  It looked kind of cool, but the technique was different.  
While the capacitive plates used on the Brown device could be completely 
enclosed and still operate, an electric wind device would require an open
structure to allow for the flow of air.  The illustrated craft that I\'d seen
had a central control cabin & power plant, with a large circular "wing" surrounding
it.  The "wing" was made up of two conducting meshes one above the other.
When you apply power to the mesh, the upper mesh applies a negative 
charge to air molecules in it\'s vicinity.  These negatively charged air particles
rush towards the lower positive mesh.  If you can achieve a powerful enough
airflow, the craft will at least hover and possibly fly.  It would probably work
much better on a thicker atmosphere world.

Why haven\'t there been electric wind vehicles?  There is of course the problem
of a compact electric power plant, which we don\'t have yet.    sigh :(

No, that\'s bad.  If you are going to have new ship designs 
(appearance) then you need to call them something else.  

What I don\'t like is that everything about the ships (jump 
capability, m-drive, hardpoints, weapons, etc) are exactly the same 
as the ships we\'ve all come to associate with Traveller.  Even the 
names are the same.  But, the ships look differently.

That\'s a break in consistency in my book.

I\'m all for "new" ships, but I think they should not only look 
different, but be different as well.  They should have different 
performance characteristics.

Doesn\'t it bug anybody that a subsidized merchant, in the Year 0, 
still has jump-1, still has 200 tons of cargo space, still has a 1-G 
rating, still requires the same amount of crew, still is a 400 ton 
displacement ship--in fact, the ship is exactly the same on paper as the 
subsidized merchant 1100 years in the future?

I think that IG should have come up with new ships for the year 0 
that are really new ships--not just slap a new picture on the same 
old statistics.

I\'m not against new ship designs--in fact, I\'m for new designs.  What 
I\'m against is the same ships we\'ve all come to know having a different look.

Actually, many people have let me know that they like the backstory 
posts.  But, as Alan suggested, I will start putting "long" on my 
long posts.

William, you may be misinterpreting what the backstory posts are 
designed to do.  I\'m not just putting these up because I think they 
are a cool story.  Actually, each one is a first draft, and you can 
probably tell that the writing needs some work.  I know that I could 
do a better job if I put the time into it.

But, the backstory posts are not just backstory.  Each one details a 
fleshed out NPC for GMs to use.  They are "backstory" because I 
relate how each PC/NPC became involved in the Grand Adventure.

I\'ve put the NPC\'s stats at the bottom of the posts along with other 
game information.  If a GM is interested, he can use this guy as a 
quick NPC for his current adventure.  A personality and background is 
already laid out.  

Or, the GM can use the NPC during his own Traveller Adventure 
campaign.

Whatever the GM wants to do with it--that\'s what it is there for.  He 
could even copy the post and use it as a player hand out.

Therefore, at least for some, I think the backstory posts are more 
than just "Traveller-esque" reading.  I think they can be useful game 
aids.

What do people (on this list) look for in good starship deck-
plans?  I have a number of ship deckplans, that I may not have
originally designed for Traveller, but have either been or can
be.  If people are interested maybe I\'ll make them available
somehow.

Isn\'t Clairvoyance the ability to see things that aren\'t in your field
of vision?  Like Anders pointed out, reading a book on your desk while
your actually somewhere other than your office.

As for the future, you\'re thinking of precognition--the ability to
forsee future events.  As far as I know, this power has never appeared
in any Traveller material.

Are you sure this is a mistake? In CT and T4, the map grid is 1.5m; but
I\'ve heard that TNE used a 2m grid. So if IG had put a grid on the maps,
one or the other faction of players would be ticked off. As it is, both can
use the book, albeit with some slight inconvenience.

A suggested fix: photocopy onto acetate a grid of the proper size, at the
scale you use in your game, and use it as an overlay. Then you can draw all
over it with grease pencils or erasable markers: "The Vargr boarders are
*here*; you guys are down the corridor *here* and *here*..." (Are all the
deckplans reproduced at the same scale? I\'m assuming they are.)

And if you want to use indoor *hex* grids, like Rob Prior does, go ahead.
Everybody gets their druthers.

Not having seen the book, I can\'t say for sure if this is practical. Does
it make sense?

I think that IG definitely did the right thing with the artwork.  Don\'t
take this the wrong way, but it\'s different and it\'s visual enough that
it will attract people.  Is it the most scientifically correct?  Of
course not.  Are there flaws in the logic behind the vehicles in the
artwork?  Of course.  Is everyone that plays Traveller a fucking rocket
scientist?  Of course not.  Isn\'t this a game?  Of course.  Then why do
we take it so seriously?  We\'re still clamoring for the Traveller we
started out on 20 years ago.

The problem is that we\'re not a new market for IG to tap.  So, a lot of
what goes into this edition has to attract a wide variety of people.
You know, pretty pictures sell more than scientifically correct
pictures.  A fact of life.

Do I like Foss\'s artwork?  Some of it (not the weapons page).  Would I
like to see Deitrich and Vilardi back?  Of course.  You know, IG could
always just hire different artists based on Mileu (Foss/Elmore for M:0,
Deitrich/Vilardi for M:1100, McDevitt for M:1200, etc...).

I would love to see them.  I am always in the market for deck plans!  One
wonderful source I found was the old Space Opera "Seldon\'s Starcraft
Compendiums."  There are some really bizarre ships in them, true, but if you
are looking for, say, the layout of a megaton luxury star-liner for your
intrepid party of adventurers to snoop through, the "technical details" can
be fudged or ignored completely, since chances are really good that these are
not vessels you will use in combat, and that the players will end up in
possession of.

Also great for alien ship "dungeon crawls" if they\'re really weird designs.

I think that these ships should have a different look.  The fact is that
styles change more than function.  Look at the Corvette of today and
compare that to the Stingray.  How about the Nova as a muscle car and
then as a hatchback?  Honda Civic?  The *real* differences are subtle at
best.  The physical differences are due to the fact that people\'s idea
of style changes over time.

Another possibility that comes to mind if the deck plans are all
drawn to the same scale (e.g., 25mm = 6m?) would be to grab one or two
pieces of string, cardboard, or perhaps clear acetate, and mark it at
3m, 15m, 45m, and (if you really want to) 150m in scale. Another set
of marks at 10m, 20m, and 30m could be put on the same "ruler" or a
second one for movement.

   There was absolutely no reason why the information on the Empress Wave
couldn\'t have been loaded up on one of those secret J-6 couriers the Imperium
had so many of and sent to Captial.  Does the Prime Minister of Great Britain
hop into a helicopter every time a radar installation in Scotland sees
something weird or potentially dangerous?  No, he (for now) or she stays at
10 Downing Street or goes to another location in the vicinity of London to
get briefed on it.  Same for the President of the United States--he would
only leave Washington if it were about to be destroyed, and then he would
stay in communication at all times with his commanders in the field.

   But let\'s assume that Strephon did feel the need to go--Priority Zephyr
sounds serious afterall--why not have his people announce a "Good Will Tour"
of the Lishun Sector, with an "unscheduled" stopover at Depot/Lishun so that
he can sneak off for for a while to get briefed on the status of Project
Longbow while his double waves at crowds and gives nice speeches.  He could
also meet with Dulinor while on the tour, and perhaps the Aslan ambassador as
well.

>While it may seem to we 20th century thinkers who are used to

>& Strephon had no need to rush to Lishun to see this data we are wrong.

   Whether it is the 20th century, the 3rd century, or the 57th century, it
is the height of irresponsibility and recklessness to leave as he did.  You
would think that somebody would have made some kind of contingency plan for
what to do if his double was blown away while he was gone, but there is no
evidence of that either--that too is irresponsible.  

   The few months gained in research time on the Empress Wave were lost many
times over as a result of the Rebellion and the Collapse.  These things do
not occur if Strephon is at Capital getting briefed by his top aides.

   There is no evidence that the Empress Wave is going to wipe out the
Regency, or in this case, the Third Imperium.  It is certainly wreaking havoc
on the poor Zhodani, but then their society is based on psionics, while the
Imperium is not.  While many millions of psionically talented people in the
Imperium are going to be affected, it will not cause the fall of the empire.

>The primary duty of an Emporer is to preserve that Empire.

   A job best performed from the capital.  If you think he or she should make
periodic tours to wave the flag, make friends, and inspire confidence in the
people that the Emperor cares about them, that\'s one thing, but covert
missions of the kind Strephon undertook should never be a part of the
Emperor\'s job description.

>The fault if any was in not having a mole in Dulinors entourage 
>who could & would blow him away when he formulated his assasination plan.

   No, the fault is with the plot, which could have been written better.
 Remember, the fact that Strephon was really alive afterall was a bit added
later into the storyline.  I would have written it differently.

   Nothing can be done about that now (it is canon), but I refuse to give
Strephon anything but low marks as a ruler.  He wasn\'t where he was suppose
to be when the Imperium really needed him, and untold billions died as a
result.

Actually you might be able to buy these.  I know they used to make them.  I
thought they were great, and bought some, years ago, but have never had the
opportunity to use them.

Now that I have the book too, I agree.  The deck plans seem like just a
mish-mash of rooms.  Also, another couple of caveats...  Why the \'ell
did they leave out the grid, and what\'s with all the black surrounding
the deck plans?!

Someone recently stated that the deck plans are useless... I now see
why.

I thought that the IG web site said that this art work was all 
original.  Now that you mention it, I recognize the style, but 
couldn\'t tell you if I\'ve seen the exact paintings or just some other 
Foss stuff.  He definitely has a style.  

Too bad it is not Traveller.

Actually, I\'m a firm believer that Traveller art work can be both 
good and Traveller-esque.  Foss is not doing that.

An RPG\'s artwork should reflect the flavor of the game.  Vampire does 
a great job of this (although I don\'t play).  Star Wars, too.  

Foss\' stuff is OK, but it does not suit my tastes as far as Traveller 
goes.  There\'s got to be another way.

Well, the small size of the reproducitons in T4 of his artwork do not
give his work justice.  I have a Chris Foss poster book with many of the
same illustrations, and the artwork looks much better in the larger
format.

Actually, I have never associated Foss\' work with pulp sci-fi...  But I
do admit that it is not as hard edged as it should be for Traveller.  My
only real problem with seeing Foss\' work paired with the game is that
the scale of most of the spacecraft he draws is way too large for
traveller, IMHO.  Most of what he draws is simply immense.

None of the color illustrations are new.  I\'m not sure about some of the

I don\'t, and never have, claimed to represent the majority. I am part of a
very vocal minority. But (no offense to Ken intended), His extensive
backhistory is of limited interest. And I have felt since the announcement
of T4 that there should be a mechanics & technologies list and a historical
list; none of them need be by game system. Rather, I am a gearhead and
system mechanics otaku; I have players work out with me their own
backhistories at start of every campaign.

Overall, it\'s the kind of thing that belongs on a web page, not the list,
IMNSHO. (No, I have no delusions of humility; only of reality.) His own
recent post suggests it as better for a web page. Heck, I\'d rather his
combat system have been on a web site; it would have been far easier to d/l
than to snag from digests.

Sorry, but *no way* would I want to see Foss as an artist for Space Opera
(not that I\'m likely to need a say, or even get one - but if anyone does
plan a reprint, *and* they ask the original authors, I\'ll put in an
{attempted} veto).

For *years*, even when it was difficult to get US editions of SF here in
Oz, I *refused* to get UK editions - the reason? The predominance of Foss
so-called "artwork". He may be good with colours, but a SF artist he ain\'t.
In fact, I\'d pay extra for a T4 edition *without* his godawful garbage-art.

But carriers aren\'t *meant* to be in the "line of battle"! They have CAP
(Combat Air Patrol) to defend them, with lots and lots of escorts to
provide a ring defence and *good* ESM/ECM/ECCM to detect any threat that
gets too close. The Fighters are the vessel\'s defences, and can be launched
even more quickly than those of a moden CV/CVN. So you argument is not
relevant.

Well, so what? A CV/CVN is pretty much a "one shot" weapon against any
enemy that is capable of getting close enough to do that. So, if the Space
Carrier doesn\'t survive, so what - their "alpha strike" has probably wiped
out more tonnage than the carrier anyway. However, the carrier isn\'t likely
to get close enough for this to happen - unless the Imperial Navy is
commanded by ex-IJN Carrier Admirals!

Unlikely to happen before the strike is launched given halfway competent
leadership. Remember, a space carrier is able to launch the fighters from
*hundreds* of hours out, after all, they have PPlants worth (assuming
Fusion Plus for maximum internal space) at least 3000 hours between
maintenance. And the Fighters/Strike Craft have a 6G speed as a matter of
course, of course!

No. This is wrong. Well, not entirely wrong. You *did* have more planes
than ships, but that certainly *wasn\'t* the reason for spotting the planes
on deck. Now, IIRC, the US had begun experiments with this before the war
but had abandoned it for full scale deployments because of the increased
corrosion damage to the exposed aircraft - peacetime budgets made this a
no-no, those aircraft had to last a set time. During wartime, corrosion was
*not* the reason most of those aircraft went to an early reward, and so did
not figure in planning. The reason they were spotted on deck was quite
simply what I said - the USN wanted to have more aircraft on the carriers,
and that was that.

> >Seems that we have more Vilani conservatism here!

Still seems to be the case!

No. For example, if you light a match to dynamite or C-4 it\'ll *burn*,
not explode. With fusion reactions, it\'s even worse. Without enough
energy input, the reaction will stop as soon as you remove the energy
input.

It\'s like trying to light a big log. Hold a flame to it, and it\'ll char
a little. But remove the flame and it goes out. You not only have to
get it reacting, you have to get *enough* reacting at the same time.

To get an explosion, you have to concentrate enough energy to get "all"
the hydrogen to fuse at once. And a good chunk of the energy has to be
used to compress the hydrogen so that it stays packed tightly long
enough for the "boom". Without the pressure, you get a "fizzle". A
small explosion that just scatters the hydrogen before much of it can
react.

For any sort of fusion reaction you need three things: heat, pressure,
and time. You need high temp & pressure for a short time, or lower for
longer. But the reaction rate depend on temp & pressure. For a bomb,
you need a reaction rate measured in kg per microsecond. Which requires
very high temps and pressures. And the means high energy input. 

The temp & pressure are related to the energy input *and* the amount of
material. For a fusion reactor, you need to bring *small* amounts of
material to fusion conditions (much less than a gram at any time). For
bomb you need to bring kilograms to those conditions.

Leave - sort of a sabbatical to you Yanks - and six weeks end of academic
year holidays), I have some time on my hands and, apart from playing
computer games, completing my *own* SF RPGs and having a life, I have
decided to do a -

*Alternate Simple Vehicle Design System*

This will sort of be a cross between Rigger Black Book (FASA, and by yours
truly), Car Wars (SJ Games), Maximum Metal (R Talsorian Games) and my own
"Ad Astra" system. What will it be like? Well -

* It *won\'t* be SVDS*

The prime assumptions that it is based on will be -

1) Vehicles are a *plot device*. All players and GMs need (apart from the
gearheads, who don\'t count in this, because FF&S and SVDS are basically
unusable) to know are such things as - Speed, Range, Fuel Consumption,
Cargo Capacity. The volume of the suspension or the Mw rating of the radio
are irrelevant for PCs and GMs alike.

2) Military Vehicles are even *more* a "plot device". They are what the GM
wants them to be. It is unlikely that PCs will ever own them, only have to
run away from them or fight from them. The data on how they operate is
really what the GM wants it to be. If he wants the PCs to be
detected/caught or to get away, then he\'ll manipulate things to work that
way anyhow, regardless of what the SVDS numbers say. Sorry, only gearheads
(and not even all of them) are so ignorant of role playing that they\'ll
have the PCs killed out of hand just because they don\'t have good sensors,
fast legs, tough armour, or whatever. Just doesn\'t work that way.

3) The system will be built about the concept of the "space" (as used in
RBB, CW and MM - hey, why waste a good idea!), which will be mutable. It
will basically be equivalent to one cramped passenger seat (for
passengers), but may not directly equate with a "space" for electronics or
weapons.

4) Differentiation between Military and Civilian "spaces", maintenance
effects on internal space availability, and the possibility (and type) of
minor (and major) inherent design flaws will also be covered.

5) Design will be built around basic hull types (Cars, Vans, Pickups, Light
Aircraft, AFVs etc.) and each type will have a base speed, range, and fuel
consumption which will be modifiable, but no space will be provided for in
the basic hull form. Tech effects will improve base fuel consumption, speed
per volume of "standard" engine etc.

Like I say, this will be more along the lines of the RBB - and the
assumption that the system will provide "reasonable" figures. They may not
work out exactly the way that SVDS does, but they *will* be internally
consistent and will provide figures that players and GMs will be able to
live with. And, after all, that\'s all that counts, isn\'t it.

Anyone with any ideas and inputs is welcome to email me with them. Be
warned, however, that when I did RBB some years ago, it took a *long* time
- - basically all of my then Xmas hols, and I don\'t intend to spend that sort
of time on this. So it may well take a lot longer, but something will be
available in the first quarter of 97 - probably in parts, and probably in
Dark Star (and probably thereafter in a complete one-volume format).

Provider and phone lines are back for now...

I shoudl not have said "the book is the same old tired ships". I should 
have been clear that there are several new designs in the book, mostly 
those by list members (I especially like the Corsair and the illo that 
comes with it).

However, the ships from the T4 book are here...again...it\'s those tired 
ships that I was referring to. Also, I am having a major problem 
reconciling some of the illos with the deckplans--the "Type S" scout 
being the biggest problem here. And, as somebody pointed out, some of the 
plans are ultra-vague: Where are the staterooms in the scout? 

As for Tech Levels, it goes up to 15+ in the design sequence--just not 
12+ designs in the front part of the book. I haven\'t run through the 
sequence yet.

On grids: Yes, no grids. Next to each overhead plan is a square marked 
"2m". So they give you a reference square, marked 2 meters, but don\'t 
extend it to the plan itself.

On plans, my favorites are a toss up between FASA\'s and the ones that 
appeared in DGP/SGS products. Especially the Beowulf in the SO book. Of 
course, you could not have done that level of detail (a ship tour) in 
Starships, but plans with a little more detail would have been nice. 

I\'m hoping that IG can pump several more of the promised products out the 
door before the end of the first quarter of 1997. Sure, Traveller is 
popular...but I think that they\'ll have to reach a certain critical mass 
of background products before it gets to the point of sustainability. A 
lot of us have CT, MT or TNE items to flesh out our backgrounds. Many 
more, especially the crucial new audience that we need to get into the 
fold (in order to keep this thing going) do not have older items. So, I 
think it is crucial that Aliens, M0 and the supply catalogs get out  as 
soon as possible (and for a more important reason than sit under the ol 
Yuletide tree for me to open!).

Thanks for listening.

        Using terran watercraft, for example, Chinese junks haven\'t changed
much for bloody centuries: the lack of wood, and shallow seas with lotsa
rocks basically call for a light, very compartmentalized design.  Last
summer I was down by a boatyard in Stanley, Hong Kong: they had a motor
junk up on skids: aside from the fact that it was motorized it still was
recognizably a junk.  Same hull construction, same hull shape; it just had
a prop instead of a rig.

        Ditto for dhows, apparently; classic design very well suited to the
exigencies of local navigation and commerce, and they\'ve been sailing those
babies for a very long time...

        I\'d think that if economic and navigational (whatever that means in
the space context) requirements remain the same, then ship designs are
going to reach an optimum for whatever niche they fill and stay pretty much
the same for long periods of time...


        Styling may well differ; some noble might have his yacht done up
with big fins and a pink & chrome paint job, and for the next century or so
every ship built in the sector is going to be styled vaguely like a 1950\'s
Caddy; however, the basic ship will probably not vary overmuch.

"Democracy" is "everybody votes on everything". And it\'s impossible on

Yes, but in the system you\'re suggesting, they\'re not going to be any 
more representative of their people than the Imperially-appointed Nobles 
are at present.

OK, let\'s have some numbers. But remember, I\'m basing my arguments on the TCS
rules, not on the counters in _Fifth Frontier War_ (which does not remotely
come up to the force level that TCS implies; I consider 5FW a simplification
for purposes of playability). I enjoy a good argument, but it\'s more fun when
people agree about the premises ;-).

That\'s what he did "in reality". He moved many of his regular forces up to
defend against the Zhodani, something that turned out not to be necessary,
but he didn\'t know that. However, I claim that even if he just left the
reserve forces in place, they would be strong enough to hold the Aslans
and the Vargr at bay. I also claim that if he had sent his regular forces
off to fight for Strephon and left the reserve forces behind, the same
would apply PROVIDED the Zhodani remained quiscent.

Now you may argue that he also moved many of the reserve forces to the
Zhodani borders. I don\'t think that it would be according to SOP to strip
a subsector of all its reserve forces before war actually broke out, but
if you insist I\'ll accept that too. Just tell me how big a proportion of
the reserve forces you think it is reasonable that he left behind and I\'ll
argue from there. My own take is that the reserve forces would be left in
place.

(What Vargr assistance??? The Vargr were on the other side of the Domain.)
That\'s one problem right there. Glisten is a high-population TL 15 system.
It\'s defense forces alone amounts to (...damn, I don\'t have the Glisten
population figure handy) a lot, anyway. It\'s also one of the four most 
important systems in the Spinward Marches. Do you really think that Norris 
would have stripped it of ALL its regular and reserve forces? You seem to 
have a much poorer opinion of him than I do. I claim that the Aslans didn\'t 
have any more chance of capturing Glisten than they did of capturing Tobia.

>One can imagine that they would have performed even better if a good chunk

Well, yes and no. One cannot imagine that Norris would leave all his forces
guarding a peaceful Zhodani border if the Aslans had had the singular good
fortune to make any headway against the forces left behind to rimward. So 
if the Aslans could have made an impression on Tobia, Gazulin, Trin\'s Veil, 
and Glisten, then the fact that the regular fleets were so close would mean 
that a few of them could get back in a hurry and kick them out again, which 
wouldn\'t be possible if they were far away in the Imperial core. But since I 
claim that the Aslans couldn\'t even make headway against those defense forces 
and a few reserve fleets, I can\'t imagine that they could have performed any 
better.

Like Tobia and Glisten (Or Aki, for that matter).

Which is exactly what I said myself. (Although we don\'t know just how big a
proportion of the system defenses that would be jump capable. I wonder if
you will allow me 10% of the defense budget as a reasonable figure?) I said
that the reserve fleets alone would be enough to keep the Aslans at bay,
but that if Norris did send those away too, all he would lose would be the
low-population (and possibly the medium-population) worlds. Not that I can
see him doing that. I think he\'d leave behind at least _some_ of the
reserve fleets, don\'t you? How big a percentage will you allow me?

There are no rules about how quality of crew affects ship performance, but
as far as that goes the Aslans aren\'t elite; they are _ihatei_, equipped
with obsolescent ships. As for the TL of the reserve forces, the salient
point about them seems to be that they are locally produced and maintained, 
which means that they may be TL 14 in some subsectors and even TL 13 in a 
few, but in Tobia, Trin\'s Veil, and Glisten they would be TL 15 (They may 
be _old_ TL15 ships, if they are regular navy hand-me-downs, but they won\'t 
be any older than the _ihatei_ ships). As for crew quality, it is possible
under High Guard rules to have a long career in a planetary navy. I see no
reason why the reserve fleets and PDFs wouldn\'t be up to snuff.

>Sword World naval forces would be at a distinct technological disadvantage, 
>but their morale and training would likely be superior as well.

How much better? 10 % better? 25%? Half again? Double? The Sword Worlds are
mostly TL 12 IIRC. Their ships will be at a 10:1 disadvantage against TL 14 
ships and a 20:1 against TL 15 ships.

Starve? You aren\'t proposing that any high-population world would actually
be importing food in amounts large enough to make a significant difference?
Try working out just how many ships Glisten or Tobia would need in order to
import food for just 10% of its population. Luxury imprts, sure. 
Supplementary foodstuffs, possibly. But relying on it? Impossible for a
high-population world (A medium and low population world can do it _if_ they
have a high-population world nearby that can provide the necessary
shipping).

Why? A low or even a low medium population world, yes, if it is a "one-crop"
world. But a high-population world is just too big to be a one-crop world. A
system like Glisten must produce almost everything basic they need.

In any case, you can\'t blockade a world if you can\'t station ships in its 
system.

Well, for one thing, they can\'t. But apart from that, what descriptions of
the Vargr and the Aslan psycology have you read? I\'m unable to believe in
the Aslans cooperating for long, based on what we\'ve been told about them,
but my mind positively boggles when I try to imagine a stable alliance
between dozens of Aslan clans AND Vargr groups.

The big basic fallacy here is that you speak of the Aslans as a cohesive 
whole on a par with the Zhodani. I admit that a union of all Aslan clans
on the far side of the Great Rift would have the strength to replace the
Zhodani. What I can\'t believe is that such a union is possible. At most
we have some cooperation between the various _ihatei_ of the clans (which
are not nearly the same thing), and even that is stretching things beyond
belief (More about this later).

Well, this is one of those places where we have to decide on what we will
consider reasonable. The regular fleets are busy guarding the Zho border
(All of them? Do you really think it is reasonable to assume that Norris
would move every single one of the regular fleets to the Zho border?) Are
the reserve fleets with them? All of them? I\'d like you to tell me just
how few forces you think Norris left behind to rimwards. Give me some 
numbers to work with here.

Look, I hope you won\'t take offense at this, but are we reading the same
books? It is axiomatic that the Aslans are incapable of uniting for any
length of time. That is mentioned time and time again. The only reason
the Aslans managed to grow so big is said to be because they arrived 
during the long night. They can barely manage it on the defensive (The
Peace of Ftalhar was only made with the four biggest Aslan clans; the
inference is that those were the ones involved in the duel war on the
Aslan side). And leaving aside any clan rivalry the _ihatei_ carry with
them from back home, they are rivals for the same pieces of real estaste. 

>have superior morale and training, and have a warrior ethic which says 
that you win the war, then settle down with your family in peace.  

You\'re ignoring the Aslans\' two greatest handicaps: 1) Their division into 
separate clans and 2) that we\'re dealing with _ihatei_.

1) Seperate clans: There are literally hundreds of clans. Of these there
are 29 especially powerful, but those 29 by no means represent all the
military strength of the Aslans. How strong can the biggest clan be? I\'d
say no more than 5% of the total Aslan strength and much more likely 2-3%.

2) Ihatei: We\'re not talking about a concerted attack backed by the full
military power of the entire Aslan population of the Trojan Reaches. We\'re 
talking about younger sons being fitted out with _surplus_ ships out of 
what the clan chief feels that he can spare. Is he going to commit his full 
military strength? No, he\'s going to keep 90% of it home to defend his own 
lands against rival neighbouring clans. Remember that taking over a
neighbouring world will let you get rid of orders of maginitude more
_ihatei_ than sending them off to the Imperium. In Rebellion we\'re told that 
the typical _ihatei_ fleet is TL 13. Ths must mean that _ihatei_ fleets are
a TL lower than regular clan fleets (Presumably for the same reason the
reserve fleets are a TL lower than regular forces). If so, 55 billion TL 14 
Aslans will muster the equivalent of the full navy of 5.5 billion TL 13 
beings for their _ihatei_ and 170 billion TL 13 Aslans will represent an 
actual menace equal to the full navy of 17 billion TL 12 beings. IF they 
cooperate fully and IF they use all their ressources on warships, which we 
know is not the case.

IMO the Trojan Reach forces alone can deal with this. But even if you inflate 
the strength of the Aslan _ihatei_ they still can\'t win. Even if the Domain 
don\'t have the muscle to deal with all Aslans, they will certainly have 
enough to make life impossible for any one clan if they get really upset. Any 
_ihatei_ admiral is going to think long and hard before sacrificing his fleet 
so that other clans may have it a bit softer. Remember that the goal of every 
_ihatei_ admiral in a coalition won\'t just be to defeat the Imperial forces 
defending his chosen bit of land, but to do so while sustaining the least 
possible casualties. And if the other clans take disproportionally greater 
losses, so much the better when the time comes to divide the spoils. Don\'t 
you think any half-competent Imperial diplomat could do something with that 
situation? Especially since there are much easier targets available closer to 
their home bases.

Recipice for roast moose: First you catch a moose. The human starports will
be defended. Any starport big enough to be any use will be defended.

There is one problem, the Zhodani. Certainly enough to make it plausible that
he stay put. But I think it equally plausible that a direct order from the 
true Emperor could set him off.

And then again, she may not. We don\'t know anything about her personal
integrity. Besides, I\'m not sure that siding with even a _false_ Strephon,
let alone a true one, wouldn\'t have been useful enough to get even a 
thoroughly machiavellian Margaret to see him. As I said before, imagine how
many more defections a Strephon backed by an Archduke and a close personal 
relative would have provoked.

I agree that Strephon mishandled the Longbow situation. What is puzzling is
that even the mishandling was mishandled, so to speak. Dulinor should have
been told. The risk of him seeing through the double might not have been
very big, but there must have been some risk, and the offense it would give
if that happened would surely have been far worse than that of telling him
beforehand.

Nice work, Kenneth, but I have a couple of problems with the story: How will
enlisting in one Imperial organization hide Shawn from another Imperial
organization? Surely the Imperial Army isn\'t the French Foreign Legion?
And surely the Navy will be able to find the March Harrier at the very
least. If they can\'t just check the Army\'s files, that ship will point a
direct finger at Shawn as long as he retains any title to it. And the Navy
isn\'t just going to forget anything; piracy is something they take very
seriously.

Nope.  Actually, given the fact that it was Don Perrin who oversaw the 
Starships project, I\'m pretty sure it wasn\'t a mistake, in the sense that 
he didn\'t intend to put them there and then forgot, or something like 
that.  I just meant it was definitely going to be a big negative factor 
for Traveller fans.

Hmmm.  Not a bad thought (not thinking as clearly as you, I\'d figured I\'d 
have to pull out a ruler and pencil,and pencil in some grids - of course, 
use  copier you dope![G]).

How about Cycles, and Small Watercraft & Submersibles?

One of the things that has always disappointed me about the original 
Striker rules was the lack of design sequences for Watercraft & 
Submersibles. (Okay, flame throwers, too. ;-)

I have no idea what\'s covered in FFS, but it would be nice to be
able to create interesting vehicles like Sailing Ships and other low
tech level stuff in addition to the usual high tech gadgets.  (For
example, a wooden sailing ship with grav plates?)

No, not at all.  I find his stuff okay at best -- which is why I am selling my  
copy of his 1990 softcover large format book, _Diary of a Space Person_, for 
$15 (includes shipping).  [Send me personal email if interested.]

As others have pointed out, the color pieces are reprints -- many (such as the 
cover) appear in _Diary_.

I have to admit, though, there has bee n a lot of previous Traveller art I 
didn\'t like either.  Anything by Tom Peters (especially the Fiery!) was great, 
but most of the ships in, for example, _Fighting Ships of the Shattered 
Imperium_ were just bizarre, from an engineering as well as an aesthetic 
viewpoint.  The general rule of thumb I have noticed (with the exception of 
the Azhanti High Lightning class frontier cruisers) is that the larger the 
ship, the goofier it looks.

I disagree with this -- I don\'t think Foss could do _Space Opera_, either.  
Many of the Terran ships (at least) from _SO_ (e.g., Nike class, scout, 
<Can\'tThinkOfIt> patrol ship) would look at home in Traveller starport.

guys.

        WRT the whole T4 quality thing: as a new Traveller player, I\'ve
gotta say that I\'m not terribly offended by the new stuff.  It\'s not
spectacular, but I enjoyed reading the rulebook, and am looking forwards to
Starships and the other books.  Sure it\'s not exactly the same as the old
Traveller stuff, only better; it\'s just a restatement for the 1990\'s to get
the game back into the market again.  And I think that what with the whole
administrative clusterfork being overwith, they\'ll be able to build on the
feedback they get and improve as they go along.  So count me in as an
optimist on this one...  I\'m planning on buying as they appear; I\'ll get a
set of rules, and what I don\'t like I\'ll ignore or change.  It\'s not like

I beleive that Dulinor is, well living in a bunch of silly game 
supplements proof, of the best of intentions gone arwy.  His heart and 
thoughts for the future were in the right place, his method of 
accomplishing his goals was just plain wrong.  Even if his attempt had 
succeeded he still would have been a murderer.

The curious thing was if you look at Dulinor\'s plans for the imperium and 
the social reforms which have been preformed in both the Regency and the 
RC you suddenly realize that if anyone came out of this thing on the plus 
side it was Dulinor, and Craig and Noris of course, but the social 
reforms he wanted to put into motion were eventually accomplished.

Nope.  

The art students at school tell me that, as an artist, he is good.  That is:
he has a good technique, and his paintings have a nice balance between
light/dark, colours, and also have something called \'visual tension\' (which I
gather is good).

However, anyone who knows a bit of physics or engineering has broken out
laughing.


You\'re right, Foss is better suited for space opera than hard-core SF.  Of
course, this may be where IG is trying to position Traveller.  Personally,
I\'m going to ignore the Foss art (and the deckplans based on Foss\' paintings)
and stick to te game I like.  I have liked most of the artists who have
illustrated Traveller, with the exception of Foss and the chap who did
cartoons.  


PS.  A friend in the printing business tells me that having several pages of
colour art is not cheap.  (Depending on print run, the colour art + cover
could well have been over half the price of the book!)  Am I the only one who
wants cheaper books and no colour art?

These were covered in some Challenge articles by Terry McInnes, as extensions
to the MegaTraveller design system.  Terry worked with a Royal Navy naval
architect on the modern ships, and I helped him with the ancient ships, so
the design system produced realistic results.  Sadly, the limits for our
formulae didn\'t make the final editing cut, so you can design really
unrealistic ships if you go outside the range (and you don\'t know what the
range is...).

I converted these to FF&S a few years ago, but have misplaced the file. 
(Moving and having a hard disk crash have something to do with that.)  

Among my many projects is finished the FF&S software I started a few years
ago.  It includes watercraft, because watercraft are the most cost-effective
way of moving bulk goods.

with small crosses at the centre of each tactical square.  I also draw in
furniture and other stuff to make the plans look more realistic.  (Note: the

1) What plans would you like to see drawn?  Be specific here: tell me ship
and publication.

2) Do you want furniture?

First of all, I haven\'t seen Starships yet, so I can\'t comment on it 
specifically.  However, having looked at the Foss &  Elmore artwork 
in T4, I can\'t get all that riled up about it one way or the other.  

I have never, ever bought an RPG book or supplement based upon 
the artwork contained therein.  Well, that\'s not true.  I didn\'t buy 
some of the later TNE books because the production value itself of 
the artwork in the books made me question the quality of the book 
itself.  Most of the later TNE stuff was illustrated with a lot of stuff 
from the Dover Books collections and it looked it:  crude, 
and very generic.

OTOH, nothing in T4 even approaches that poor quality.  I\'ve seen a 
number of people question the look of the Foss stuff, I\'ve seen no 
comments re. the actual quality of the work itself.  For those 
longing for the look of the old Keith Brothers stuff (which I liked), 
there is no question in my mind that Chris Foss stuff is MUCH better. 
 Yes, some of the craft designs are odd, and a couple border on 
unbelievable, but they are physically attractive, and that\'s enough 
for me.  I don\'t want 0 I.E. ships to look like 1100 I.E. ships, so I 
have very little problem with the peculiarity of some of the designs. 
 Who says that they\'re going to look alike.  In 1100 years, the 
Imperium is going to undergo not one, but probably dozens of changes 
in aesthetic values and these values are even going to vary by 
region.

Another consideration is who/what they\'re up against.  Let\'s face it. 
Star Trek/Star Wars ships defy about as many laws of physics as T4.  
The intention is to attract new players.  I think that the 
peculiarity of the Foss designs would be very attractive to the whole 
Warhammer crowd.  In addition, I think a Traveller that rehashes the 
same old vanilla designs and deckplans out of Traders and Gunboats 
will automatically turn off anybody who remembers the old game.  I\'m 
likely to buy anything that comes out for the game.  However, if I were 
somebody familiar with Traveller from the CT days, and somebody just 
put out Foss & Elmore redoing the old Keith Brothers & others drawings 
of starships in some of the CT stuff, and the same old, TIRED deckplans 
from Supplement 7, as some people seem to propose, I\'d probably look 
at it once, say "Why do I need this, I already have Traders and 
Gunboats.", and put it back on the shelf, and look at the really cool 
new supplement I found for Warhammer/Shadowrun/Vampire, whatever.

As for Larry Elmore\'s stuff, I think that its at least up to the quality 
of the better CT & MT stuff, and the early TNE art.  In many cases 
its a lot better than some of the early CT stuff, and is worlds better 
than the stuff inflicted on us in the latter years of TNE.

 I haven\'t looked at it, but I see no reason why this should
 not be the case - arranged marriages, and early marriages, are
 both not unusual in SF, and my trick memory insists that there
 are some real-world, present-day cultures where both are
 routine.  Also, consider that in the Original Star Trek (or at
 least the "non-Canon" Pocket Books novels that are based on
 it), Spock and T\'Pring were "married" in a sense at age 7.  The
 episode at Qun-ut-Qalifi was essentially the "public ceremony"
 to be followed by the consummation - although Trek fans will
 remember that it didn\'t work out that way...

 four pieces (and never along article boundaries) by my BBS\'s
 Usenet-to-BBS gateway software so that broken QWK readers like
 early versions of the one I use can handle them without doing a
 brain-barf.  I don\'t find that long articles "break the flow",
 or do anything negative to the digests. Certainly, they\'re
 on-topic for the list. And I have no objections to seeing four
 or more _digests_ per day if the volume warrants it.  Most of
 the stuff is fascinating.

Well put.  A descriptive subject line -- including the word LONG as 
appropriate -- is a considerate thing to do, but asking that people not post 
messages simply because they are long is a little extreme.  If the argument is 
that "I\'m not interested", then the answer is the Delete key; if the argument 
is that it "breaks up the flow of a digest", then either don\'t get your mail 
in digest mode or undigest it before reading (instructions for which I will 
send to the list in a moment).

I for one could go an entire lifetime without the urge to see a single 
character generation post, let alone either of The Topics Which Shall Not Be 
Named.

Digests are great for receiving mail but not necessarily great for reading it.  
Given that some have argued about particular posts cluttering up digests, I 
thought it would be appropriate to post instructions on how to undigest a 
digest.  I used this method for TML for several months.

Please note that you can use this with several digests at once.


ASSUMPTIONS:
1) Your mailer uses regular, unix-style (RFC 822) mailboxes and will recognize 
text messages which contain mail messages;
2) You have a word processor with search and replace capabilities.

STEPS:
1) Make a copy of the mailbox containing the digest(s) to be converted.

2) Open the Digest in your favorite word processor.

3) Analyze the digest: What does it use to divide messages?  Most likely, a
line of hyphens.

4) Using the global search and replace function of the software, replace a
certain number of hyphens with an appropriate message header.

This is the meat of the operation.  RFC 822 defines the indicator of a new
message to be the first line of the message, the "From filer..." line, e.g.:
"From filer Tue,  1 Oct 1996 06:58:59 -0500"

So, what you need to do is make sure that this line (it doesn\'t matter what
the actual values are) is at the top of each message, and to do that you do a
global replace where you search for, say, ten hyphens in a row and replace
them with a carriage return and the "From filer" line.

Example:

SEARCH FOR:  ----

REPLACE WITH: <return> "From filer Tue,  1 Oct 1996 06:58:59 -0500"

5) Save the file.

6) Open the file with your mail program.

If you have a good mailer, such as InterCon\'s tcpCONNECT4, then you will get a
message like "Whoa -- methinks these are mail messages.  Do you want to open
them in a new mailbox?"  If you click OK, you get a new mailbox.

At this point you open the mailbox, and all your mail messages should be
unDigested.  You can then go through and delete the threads (and people) you
don\'t want to read, etc, just as if you were getting the mail in non-Digest
format.

Hope this helps.

>Senators were not directly elected. Either the state governor or the state

Before the adoption of the 17th Amendment in 1913, the Constitution said
the state legislatures would appoint senators.  Actual methods varied from
state to state, with direct election and legislative approval in some,
governorial selection and legislative approval in others, and direct
legislative appointment in the rest.

The Founders feared extremes, they didn\'t want government controlled by
small elite groups or by popular mobs.  States with small populations
wanted equal representation by state.  States with large populations wanted
representation based on population.  The "Great Compromise" gave us
both...in two houses.  

The House of Representatives is based on population, and is composed of
local citizens expected to represent the interests of the people in their
district.  Originally, each district had only a few thousand citizens and
the Representative really was close to the people and known by everyone. 
Today, of course, each district\'s population is above a half million, so
the Representative is more remote than they used to be...this is a major
problem, IMO.

The Senate is composed of 2 leading citizens from each state,
regardless of population, appointed by the State Government, and are
expected to represent the interests of the state.  Senators were always
supposed to be "statesmen" and leaders...as much of an elite as the
founders would tolerate.

The result worked well, but there was a continuing disagreement over the
philosoply of government.  The division was between those that believed the
US was a union of States (State\'s Rightists) and those that believed the US
was a Union of states (Federalists).

The tension between State\'s Rightists and Federalists was a major reason
behind the War Between the States...yes slavery was an issue, but it was
really whether or not the Federal Government could force State Governments
to eliminate slavery.  That issue was settled by force of arms.

With the adoption of the 16th (income tax) and 17th (direct election of
Senators) the Federalists pretty much won a complete victory.  Of course,
the war was really over as of 1865. <g>

In a Traveller setting, I\'d say that the only workable legistature would be
composed of members appointed by System Governments (by whatever method),
and that would still be too big at 11,000!  A better method would be to
have Sector level Moots that elect a couple of Senators each to serve in
the Imperial Moot.

Craig, 

I don\'t agree with you.  The "house rules" posts, for example, are just
what I want to see more of on the list.  They don\'t "break the flow of the

something when you go to digest.  Personally, I use mark, copy and paste on
digests when I have to, seems to work well.

A compromise might be for people to post *summaries* of things like Ken\'s
House Rules and Ken\'s and Rich\'s adventures, and include an email or web
address for those interested in receiving the complete posts.

Quite true!  Good idea.

Excellent suggestion!  Here\'s an idea, go to an office supply store and buy
a few acetate page holders (the kind you can slide a sheet of paper into). 
Now slide the acetate grid AND the deckplan into the holder.  I already do
this (less the acetate hex sheet) for deckplans, star systems and subsector
charts. 

For a more "hitech" solution...scan the deckplan into your computer and
overlay it with the hex/sq grid pattern of your choice, then print the
composite out.  You should be able to print the deckplan out large enough
for tabletop playing with minitures.

Now, who can tell me how to get Visio or CorelDraw to produce a hex pattern
as a background, so I can lay it down and draw deckplans on a layer over
it?  Doing this *should* be easy, but I haven\'t figured it out yet.

According to my CT & TNE books, Clairaudience and Clairvoyance were both
distance spatially and not temporally. TNE, under arcana, included an entry
for Foreboding, dealing with the reciept of \'impressions of events before
they occur\'. 

Precognition is the term I have heard most often used in reference to seeing
into the future psionically.

Tacked onto the front of every Internet mail message I get is a header

FFS covers starships, aircraft, lift vehicles (grav and hovercraft), ground
cars; subsystems such as power generation, jump and maneuver drives,
electronics; and weaponry from small arms to meson guns.
It didn\'t have much below TL 4. Sorry, no watercraft: those were promised
in another book which never came out :-(

World Tamers\'s Guide fills in some gaps on for TL 2 and 3: Wagons, bow and
arrown, Black powder rifles and cannon. No catapults etc., and still no
watercraft.

        Ok...  I know diddley-squat about either piece of PC software, but
based on my experience with BluePrint, a Mac CAD program, I would suggest
doing the following:

1) somehow get a perfect hexagon to the right scale.  This should not be
too difficult if your program is a half-decent one; at the very worst you
can scan some hexgrid, zoom in, and use any of several methods that spring
to mind to trace a hex, such as using a polygon tool and tracing the hex,
or, doing a single line of the right length, duplicating it eight times,
and assembling and grouping them.

        Personally, I would recommend the second method.  Anyhow, once
you\'ve got a perfect hexagon to the right scale that would make a Greek
geometer wet his chiton in ecstasy,

2) duplicate it.  Take the second hexagon, zoom way in, align properly with
the first hexagon so that their bottom/top lines overlap perfectly, and
group them.  Duplicate the group.

3) Align the second pair with the first as per 2, supra.  Group.

4) Once you\'ve got a nice single vertical line of properly aligned hexes,
group it, duplicate it, align it (here is where you find out whether you
aligned them all properly :>), group it, duplicate the new double-line,
align, group, duplicate, etc, etc, etc.

5) Once you\'ve got hexes filling your sheet, group the whole bunch as a
single object, highlight it, and select a transparent fill.

6) Save and lock the document.

        Now, what you can do is a) use it as a guide when drawing your
deckplans, and b) once the deckplans are done, simply move it to the front
layer, where since it has a transparent fill, it will overlay nicely
without concealing your architectural masterpiece.

        Scaling it properly would be recommended; that way, if you\'re doing
small ships are large ships and you\'ve got a drawing program worth its
salt, the grid will remain to the right scale.

     I own a set of tech drawing rulers that have a number of different 
     scales on it: 1-10, 1-50, 1-100 and so forth. Perhaps one of these 
     might meet your needs if you care enough about scale that it matters. 
     
     It doesn\'t matter much to me. On a spacecraft (or in a building) you 
     will usually have two (maybe three) ranges: point blank and short 
     ranges, for which you don\'t really need scales; and two types of 
     movement: unopposed, in which case you only need an estimate for what 
     kind of walking speed they are doing, and opposed, in which case you 
     will only go a few metres before your head explodes into pink mist if 
     you don\'t take the bad guys out first. 
     
     I for one am happy enough just to see deckplans. A rough idea of scale 
     is fine - I\'ll leave fiddling around with plastic sheeting for those 
     guys that get a kick out of that sort of thing. 
     
     LONG POSTINGS
     My vote for long postings is that the sender should make sure that the 
     stuff is worth the bandwidth. I like the idea of adventure/character 
     profiles, but many I\'ve seen recently have been of pretty poor 
     quality. Please spend a few minutes reading over messages before you 
     post - many of these long posts just need a couple of minutes of 
     intelligent editing to make them perfect. 
     
     STREPHON
     Why was Nero fiddling while Rome burned? Strephon was a dilettante, or 
     a "playboy" in Dulinor\'s terms. He was off checking on a pet project 
     and the Imperium died while he was absent. When the $h1t hit the fan, 
     Strephon ran away. 
     
     After he got some Dutch courage up, he announced that he was the real 
     emperor - but he was wrong. Strephon was never a \'real emperor\'. He 
     was the degenerate descendant of the same hereditary monarchy that 
     allowed Lucan to become an heir to the Iridium Throne, despite the 
     doubts surrounding his ascension to the throne and even his sanity. 
     
     Strephon gave up, with the justification that Dulinor and Lucan would 
     stop attacking Gushemege with Strephon gone. And finally, true to 
     form, *Strephon ran away*. Nobody knew what happened to him, and 
     nobody cared.

The idea is this:  The Navy is suspicious but not checking in to the 
case that closely.  The pirate attack excuse is holding, albeit 
thinly, but Shawn also bribed the Oberlindes agent, who vouched for 
him.

I wrote the story from Shawn\'s point of view.  As you can tell, he\'s 
got some problems.  His whole rational for killing the vargr in the 
first place is not sound.  Any healthy person would have just 
quit--not subject themselves to that unpleasant of a situation for 12 
years then kill an entire crew of vargr.  


I wanted to show how Shawn got that way--grew up on Porozlo in all 
the nationalism (almost a facist society), then had all of his dreams 
come crashing down when he realised all the bullshit he\'d been buying 
all those years, then he was stuck in a dead end job for over a 
decade while his predjudice grew.

Let\'s face it.  Shawn Grey has a screw loose.  He\'s the type that 
would have been a good Nazi.  He\'s an ex-brainwashed dysfunctional 
kind of dude.  Since the story was from his point of view, I tried to 
heighten his feelings of being paranoid for his crime.

In reality, which was not the POV of the story, the Navy was somewhat 
suspicious of Grey\'s story, but lack of evidence and the Oberlindes 
investegator was on his side.

Shawn felt that it would be better to go away a while and let things 
cool down.  It\'s an outta-sight-outta-mind kind of thing.  In his 
mind, there was a good chance of getting caught, so he joined the 
Army.  Then he was screwed with mandatory reenlistment.

So, to answer your question, I agree that you cannot hide from one 
service in another service.  Shawn wanted to get out while he was 
ahead, then come back to the Harrier.  The ship is locked in the 
Aramis Trace because of it\'s meager jump-1 capability.  The Army 
advertisement seemed a logical, rational move (like the killings) in 
his state of mind.

Kenneth.

PS  Also keep in mind that these stories were written around the 
Traveller character generation process (which, BTW, I think is the 
best I\'ve ever seen in any role playing game.  You discover 
the character through the process, and look what we did with Shawn.  
I guarantee that he would not have turned out like that if we had 
just used generation points to build a character.  The Traveller 
system inspires creativity).  So, we generated Shawn, then filled in 
the holes on the frame work decided by character generation.  Shawn 
was originally intended to be a Marine.  Instead, he was in the 
Porozlo Marines for 1 and a half years and did not make his survival 
throw.  This is how he was wounded the first time.  Then he was a 
merchant, in the free traders, for 12 years and never made a 
substancial profit on his speculative trade throws.  This was his 
time on the Harrier with the vargr.  And finally, he made a 
successful enlistment throw for the Imperial Army--the player wanting 
Shawn to try to get more combat skills, but it was a two edged sword. 
 He rolled 12 on the reenlistment throw.  Thus, the story of Shawn 
Grey had to fit around these facts determined in generation.

This is what I use in my game.  If I couldn\'t find a one-sheet in the

I\'m very fortunate that many people have offered to house the Grand 
Adventure on their sites.  Heck, now I\'ve got to choose one.

But, many still want to see the Grand Adventure on the TML too, and I 
think it\'s rightful place is here.  I\'m going to continue with the GA 
here on the TML, but I will mark the posts clearly with "GA" and 
"Long" for people like yourself.

When I get the stuff on a site, I\'ll announce it here as well.

Thanks,

Actually, we know that they do. Although they may have other ways of seeing 
the future, the Zhos have access to an Ancient artifact (the star map 
projector of the route to the core) which gives occasional glimpses of the 
future (see alien Book 4)

(Backstory to the Grand Adventure and detailed, fleshed out NPC with stats and game 
information.)



Grand Adventure Backstory Part III:  Defender of the Imperium 

by Kenneth D. Bearden



Daeus Jacks grew up poor.  Dirt poor.  His family operates a moisture
reclamation farm on the planet Yres in the Regina subsector.  The
planet has an atmosphere of acidic hydrogen chloride that can eat
through a vac suit in less than 12 hours.  60% of the planet is
covered in non-water fluid oceans of liquid hydrochloric acid.  Yres
is definitely not an easy place to live.  

The Yres system defines the Imperial frontier.  Once you leave the
system coreward or spinward, you are no longer in Imperial space and
are located in the no man\'s land between the Zhodani Consulate and the
Vargr Extents.  In 1082, the Zhodani Consulate invaded Imperial worlds
in the Jewel and Regina subsectors.  The war was short, inconclusive,
and characterized by the stalemated fighting waged primarily in these
two subsectors.  

Two years later, the last battle of the war was waged between the Yres
and Menorb systems.  The Battle of Two Suns was one of the most bloody
space battles in Imperial history.  Losses on both sides were heavy,
but the Imperium held the field.  The Zhodani supply lines were
stretched to their limit and absorbed heavy loses from Imperial naval
commando teams.  The Zhodani were unable to continue their advance. 
Had the battle gone the other way, the loss of Yres and Menorb would
have forced the evacuation of the Imperial stronghold at Efate and
meant the collapse of the entire coreward end of the Regina subsector.
 The area of space where the battle was fought is still littered with
debris to this day.  It is posted as a dangerous area and avoided by
interstellar transportation.  

Daeus was a 13 year old child on Yres when the Battle of Two Suns was
fought, and it left an indelible impression on him.  He remembers the
reports and visual transmissions and then the medical transports that
landed on Yres.  In particular, he remembers an interview with a
wounded Navy pilot fresh from the battle on his way to the facilities
planet side.  From that moment on, all Daeus talked about was being a
pilot in the Imperial Navy.  At first, his parents thought it was a
phase like what a lot of little boys go through, but, as he reached
college age, he was still talking about it.

He played around with the idea of going to college and being in the
NOTC program in order to get his commission when he graduated.  But,
the education he received growing up was not strong, and he knew that
it would be hard for him to place on the entrance exam.  He toyed with
the idea of attending the Imperial Naval Academy on Regina as well,
but he also knew that he didn\'t have the money or the social status to
even try.

His mind made up, 18 years old, he went down to his local recruitment
office and enlisted.  His dream was to be a pilot, but he learned that
job was usually reserved for college honors and naval academy
graduates.  He was trained as a zero G insertion specialist.  When a
target ship is rendered inoperable by a navy ship, an insertion team
is sent over to crack the hull so that the shock troops can be sent
in.  Sometimes this is a matter of cutting into the ships electronics
and opening the air lock via computer.  Sometimes this entails
torching into the hull with laser drills to open the lock
mechanically.  Sometimes it is only a matter of knocking and having
someone let you in.  And sometimes,  it is a matter of blowing the
hull with demolition charges.  Many times, the insertion team is also
the first boarders on the target ship.  Whatever the case, this is a
high risk, high danger job.

And Daeus loved it.  He was made for it.  It was his life\'s calling,
and he was thankful that he did not have to wait years to find it.

His first year out of boot camp, he was promoted.  The year following
that he was awarded one of the Navy\'s highest commendations, the Medal
For Conspicuous Gallantry.  

His ship was responding to a distress call.  Upon approaching the
ship, there was no answer to the hails.  Sensor sweeps revealed
nothing.  Daeus\' insertion team was sent over to open the ship.  No
life signs were detected.  The boarding party was sent over waiting
for Daeus\'  team to let them in.  It was decided that a mechanical
entry was needed, but as the tech began cutting on the hull, Daeus
stopped the insertion procedure.  He had discovered that the ship was
a terrorist trap rigged to blow the ships reactor.  If it blew, it
would take Daeus\' team, the boarding team, and probably Daeus\' own
ship with it.  

A beep in Daeus\' helmet alerted him to the Captain\'s voice.  He was
ordering immediate evacuation from the vicinity of the target ship. 
Sensors had picked up the reactor reaching critical mass.  It was
probably activated by remote.  

There was not enough time to for both teams to return to the ship. 
The Captain was moving the ship away from the target ship and ordering
the teams to get as far away from the target as they could using their
thruster packs.  

Daeus knew that neither the ship and especially the insertion teams
would make it.  He and the demolition tech stayed on the hull in an
effort to stop the reactor breach.  Searching the skin of the ship, he
found the control line towards the engineering section of the ship and
deactivated it saving himself, his partner, his ship, the lives of the
other two insertion team members, and the 12 members of the boarding
party.

At the end of his first tour, the Navy crossed trained him in
engineering.  He was a master at his first specialty, and he was
trained to be more valuable in other areas.  His first four year stint
behind him, he promptly re enlisted.  

Assigned as an engineer on a battle cruiser, the ship was involved in
maneuvers on the Vargr/Zhodani border.  They were shadowing a vargr
corsair when the crazy canines fired a nuke that hit the ship hard in
the hull.  Men were being sucked out the hull breach like gnats out
the window of a ground car.  

Daeus\' leg was broken in the explosion.  Maneuvering in the zero G,
Daeus moved to the emergency controls and installed the emergency
sealing.  As gravity returned, he slammed down hard on the deck
breaking his leg in a second place.  He almost passed out.  Dragging
himself to the reactor controls, he secured the unit from breach and
fell to the deck unconscious.  For the second time in three years,
Daeus was awarded the second highest medal in the Imperial Navy, the
MCG, along with a purple heart, a combat ribbon for the tour, and
another promotion.

After recuperating from the damage done to his leg, he was assigned
light duty at the Naval base on Aramis.  The year was 1094, and he was
24 years old.  He had experienced quite a bit for someone so young. 
He taught computer entry techniques to new recruits at the base, but
he wanted to get back to away/assault teams.  He was a seasoned
veteran with two MCG\'s to his credit, and the Navy gave him his choice
of assignments.  

He spent the next two years doing what he did best, operating in
insertion teams, before he re enlisted and continued for another year.
 In 1099, his Captain recommended him for OCS.  He applied, made it,
and earned his commission at 29 years of age.  His parents were proud.

New rank, new position, he was stationed back on Aramis to learn the
finer points of being an officer--administrative work.  He took some
leave and celebrated the beginning of a new century back on Yres with
his parents.  

His third term was up.  He had been in the Navy 12 years and had
received another promotion straight out of OCS.  His mother asked him
what he was going to do now.  "Easy mom," he said, "reenlist.  They\'re
going to give me a ship"

1101.  His first command was a patrol cruiser like the one he had
spent all of those years on.  Piracy in his sector fell by 12%.  He
earned his third promotion in three years running.

During a particularly nasty engagement with some pirates, his ship was
badly damaged and put into dry dock for 10 mos.  During that time, he
was back on his home base at Aramis training zero G assault teams.  

A few months later, his ship out of dry dock, he found the pirate base
and led a multi-force strike against them.  He had used his off time
planet side wisely keeping his ear to the intelligence wing of the
base.  He made some calculations and some assumptions and went out
looking for those responsible for damaging his ship.  

He found them in between Vargr and Imperial space.  The battle was the
worst that he had ever been in.  Several ships in the Imperial
squadron had been damaged including Daeus\'.  He ordered half the
force, all of the ships too damaged to continue the fight, to follow
him out of the conflict in an effort to save what he could.  The
remaining Imperial ships were ordered to fight a holding action to
protect the retreating ships.  

The vargr corsairs thought that they had won.  It was almost two to
one against the remaining Imperial ships.  The vargr were more
numerous than the Imperials had anticipated, and they were taking
advantage of it.  The Imperial ships fighting the holding action were
taking a beating, and the line was about to fall.  Once that was done,
the vargr would have easy pickings with the retreating damaged ships. 


Then they noticed more targets off their flank.  It was the damaged
Imperial ships.  They hadn\'t retreated after all.  They had swung
around the moon, which blocked sensors, and trapped the vargr in a
pincer movement.  It was a classic, textbook maneuver, and they should
of seen it coming.  

But they didn\'t.  Daeus had executed it perfectly.  

Although giving the battle another front was a huge blow to the vargr,
it only made the odds about even for the Imperials.  The battle was
fought hard with only a few of the ships that went into the battle
able to leave the area under their own power.  But in the end, Daeus\'
force prevailed, and everyone knew that it was his maneuver that had
won it.  

He didn\'t receive the Navy\'s second highest honor again, but only the
third highest--the medal for Meritorious Conduct Under Fire.  He was
becoming one of the most decorated service men in the Navy.  

Another year went by, and his tour ended.  He was 34 years old and had
spent half of his life in the Navy.  He had begun to think that he had
done what he set out to do.  He began to think about his parents back
on Yres.  They weren\'t getting richer, but they were a lot older.  He
sent them what money he could, but that was never enough on a Naval
salary.  And what if he was killed?  Would the state take care of his
parents then?  And anyway, he wasn\'t getting any younger himself. 
Scrambling around on the hull of a starship with people wanting to
shoot at you on the other side was a game for the young.  His age was
starting to show.  He felt a lot older than he was.  He had seen and
lived a lot.  And yet, he could just as easily spend the rest of his
days in the service and retire with a full pension.  

About this time he was sitting in a bar on Aramis.  His ship was in
for maintenance, and he was collecting his thoughts and sipping on a
glass of that famous Zilan wine.  A man sat down across from him.  He
introduced himself and proceeded to tell Daeus about a merchant vessel
that was looking for a crew.  They needed a pilot, and Daeus\'
particular background seemed to fit in perfectly with their operation.

How Glynn Connal had found him, or even found out that he was contemplating
leaving the Navy, Daeus didn\'t know, but what the man was saying made
sense.

"Mr.," he said, "you\'ve got yourself a pilot."



Game Information:
All of the planets named are in the Spinward Marches.  Aramis is hex 
3110.  Yres is hex 1802.  Menorb is in hex 1803.  The info on the 
Battle of the Two Suns, the debris field (which I think is an 
excellent place for an adventure), and the Fourth Frontier War is 
consistent with listings in official Traveller products.

DESCRIPTION

Manufactured primarily for the Imperial Navy, the weapon is normally
carried on a sling that enables it to be fired from the hip using the
attached laser sight.  The performance of this weapon is respectable
with the shot round\'s ability to penetrate AV1 at short range.  For
close fighting where range is not an important consideration, such as
is found in boarding actions or urban locales, this is the small arm
of choice for the Imperial Navy.

Standard equipment includes gyroscopic recoil compensation that lowers
the weapon\'s recoil for zero-G combat, an optic sight (a military
version of the telescopic sight that is more rugged but not as
beneficial), a laser sight, and a sling.  

Autofire for all ammo types is 3 round bursts, but resolve the Med 
Shot rounds as if 5 rounds were fired.  For single fire--give an
additional +2 to hit when rolling for each single shot with the Med 
Shot ammunition.



This weapon was taken from the RC Equipment Guide for TNE.
Here\'s the combat chart conversion for T4.  Simply figure range to 
the target and cross reference with type of round used on the chart 
below to determine difficulty.

Features											
 .
Optic Sight:	This is a rugged, but less beneficial, military version
of the telescopic sight.  It provides a +1 DM on aim, bead, or snipe
actions at long and very long range.  If dropped or otherwise jarred
out of alignment, roll 11+.

Laser Sight:	This TL 10 laser sight has a range of 240 m.  Use of the
sight will allow three consecutive fire actions, instead of the usual
one, at the same target while performing aim, bead, or snipe actions.

PSIONIC TIME TRAVEL

A Note for Referees

   Only three individuals out of the 50+ billion inhabitants of the Terran
Republic are known to have the ability to psionically time travel, and they
are all related.  This should give you some indication as to just how
uncommon Psionic Time Travel ability is.  However, it is conceivable that
another person not of the Dahnara-Avila line could also have it.  Thus, a
description of Psionic Time Travel and how it is used in Traveller is
included as part of Children of Earth.

   As with all psionic skills, referees should use care in allowing a player
character to have this ability, least it give the PCs an unfair advantage.
 Remember, Traveller was never intended to be Advanced Dungeons and Dragons
(AD&D) with gauss rifles and laser guns.

Introduction

   Similar to Prescience and Teleperception, Psionic Time Travel is in fact
an Arcana psionic ability. Characters with this ability don\'t actually
physically travel through time, but are receiving impressions of events that
have occurred in the past, are occurring in the present, or will occur in the
future.  At times these impressions can be so clear that the psion feels as
though they are actually experiencing the event as it takes place, while at
others, only vague emotions and images can be felt.

   It is not known when the first instance of Psionic Time Travel took place.
 It is likely that an individual at some point in the past experienced it,
but did not know what was happening to them (it has been suggested that
so-called "past life regression" that was popular on 20th century Terra may
have been a primitive form of Psionic Time Travel), or mistaken what they
were experiencing for something else, probably Prescience, Teleperception or
even insanity (not all worlds in the Imperium and Solomani Confederation have
a full understanding of psionics).

   The first recorded use of this ability was by Gabrielle (later Gabree-el)
Dahnara, who had just completed her psionic training in Los Angeles on Terra.
 She experienced a time travel of some 3450 years to the era of the Great
Southern California Earthquakes of 2072 AD.  Gabrielle continued to practice
this psionic skill in secret, and was later able to use it in her
classification and authentication of ancient Terran artifacts was she was a
professor in Damascus.  Since then, both Gabree-el\'s granddaughter Shoshanna
and great-granddaughter Ellora have also tested as having this ability, and
both practice its use.

Usage and Restrictions

   In order to successfully psionically time travel, the gifted individual
must be in a Relaxed Environment as described in the TNE Manual.  The base
difficulty of Psionic Time Travel is Difficult, though this difficulty can be
reduced to Average if the psion undergoes a meditative trance, either through
use of psionics or special training.  The emotional state of the psion is
also important.  Witnessing events while psionically time traveling that
evoke strong emotion (either great joy or sorrow) immediately cause the psion
to come back to reality and lose all memory of the event that caused it (this
is why Gabree-el was able to foresee the Virus attack on Earth, but not the
death of her husband when his Virus infected grav bus crashed to the ground).

   Psionic Time Travel also requires a psionic focus.  This focus can be an
object, a place, a person or animal, even a photograph or a recording.  The
only stipulation is that the focus must be present at the time of the event
the psion wants to observe in the past, present, or future.  A forgery of a
historical object, for example, will not evoke any impressions of the
historical era it supposedly came from, if anything it will evoke impressions
of how the forgery was made.  

    Psionic Time Travel to another place in the same time frame (using it as
a substitute for Teleperception) is possible, but only if the psion is in
communication (by radio, camera, etc.) with the place to be observed.  If a
high level of success is achieved, the psion will receive impressions of
images and sounds from the scene that is not available through the limits
imposed by standard communications devices.

Levels of Success

   This is largely determine by the referee, but at the lowest levels, only
flashes of still images will be received.  At the upper end, not only will
the psion be able to view the scene as though they were there, but they will
also be aware of how many years prior to or subsequent from the current date
the event the psion is viewing is taking place.

Additional Considerations

   Regardless of success level, Psionic Time Travel into future is an
uncertain (small \'u\') task.  This is because the future, unlike the past (as
the saying goes "what has happen, has happen, and nothing can change that
now") is not fixed in time.  What the psion sees when he or she travels into
the future is what will happen if none of the significant variable that
caused a particular event to occur are changed.  Change one or more of the
significant variables, and the event might not take place at all, or will
happen differently.

   Psionic Time Travel into the past can also involve a degree of
uncertainty.  Unless the psion has a knowledge of history (small \'h\'), he or
she may be unaware of the significance of the event they are witnessing, or
may interpret an event incorrectly (particularly if the psion was taught a
biased view of the subject of History).  Referees should determine just how
much (or how little) a particular individual player character knows about an
event they are witnessing and adjust the description of the event
accordingly.

umm, is this any different than the situation we have now?

At present (although I\'m moving in 2 weeks thank god) I live in the small 
mining community of Flin Flon, in the wilderness of northern Manitoba. Do 
you think northern Manitoba (or northern Canada, for that matter), has any 
say in the governance of Canada? In Manitoba alone, out of 14 federal 
ridings, 1 of them, the Churchill constituency, contains over 50% of the 
land mass of Manitoba.

Well in the real world, many countries have gotten around the problem you 
raise by having 2 houses of government, one rep by pop, one rep by area 
(e.g. the US Senate).

Unfortunately, Canada is not among them :-(

>Besides, if the Imperium was a democracy, we\'d have to call it the 
Democrium.

Well, after exactly 3 seconds of thought, I figured it could be called the 
First Republic.

You\'re probably right, but maybe Strephon intended to diss Dulinor.  Dulinor would 
likely have realized that it was a double and been insulted -- but also put in his 
place, as someone who doesn\'t have a right to see the Emperor.

I\'m on my way to the San Francisco store tomorrow, in that case!  Palo Alto is bit of a

If this is a covert landing, generally you do not want to announce your
arrival (a 10KLb bomb tends to make a little noise), nor leave a trace of
your landing afterwards.  It also sends spikes to any seismic recorders on
the continent.

I wouldn\'t want a FAE on MY ship!  Nukes, on missiles, are kinda hard to
set off with a hammer or a gun...conventional explosives however...  Always
remember the rogue crewman and Murphy\'s Law!  

Kinda hard on any locals, or whatever, that are in the LZ.  (Say daddy,
that ship just laid an egg...)

On a related note, if you need to find a place to land in a heavily
forested or jungle area, you can use a time tested technique.  You simply
drop something equivalent to a 10,000 lb bomb onto a portion of that
jungle, and you have an instant landing zone.  This was used during the
vietnam era to make impromptu landing sites for helicopter transports.  The
bomb (very large) would be rolled out of the cargo bay of a C130 at about
5000ft.  Pretty devastating to the local flora and fauna.

Cycles and all sorts of other types of vehicle will be included. Maybe not
watercraft, though - I don\'t have the data to work with for them, but I\'ll
see what I can do anyway. The idea is for the system to be as widely
inclusive as possible.

The rules are intended to be simpler even than Striker in many ways -
without being too (obviously - I mean, we\'re talking Cold Fusion and
AntiGrav here, gutys!) unrealistic.

Urrm. This is meant to be *simple* - which means tradeoffs. One of the
major ones is that you are limited to some standardised vehicle
parameters/types. And I don\'t think that Sailing Ships are high on my list!

The main reason for the existence of the rules (well, the *potential* to
exist, at the moment!) is that I want to have a system to design something
that is *post-20th Century*. I figure "old fashioned" and "current"
vehicles are so easy to extrapolate from existing designs that there is no
need to design them. I guess that sailing ships would fall into that
category. The only difference would be the materials and (presumably)
reduced maintenance cost, as well as peripherals.

Sounds reasonable for a working title! Though it will be more detailed than
the RPSCS for *design* - just one hell of a lot *less* detailed in what I
feel are irrelevant areas!

Anyone any idea how effective high explosive (and related ammo types)
would be in a vacuum - ie. what fraction of the effect is due to the
shock wave of the air expanding from the explosion, and what fraction
due to the actual explosive device?  This is important as many of the
more destructive weapons rely on explosive ammo.

In TCS it gives rules for the shipbuilding/repair facilities and (I think)
refuelling capacity of a given starport.  This is strongly linked to the
population of the world on which the starport is located.  I think that this
would also affect the volume of traffic to and from the port...

I can\'t remember exactly but I think that the shipbuilding/repair facility
was about 1 million displacement tons for a Pop 9 world.  There was also
an allowance for this to vary in size depending on whether the planet was
at war or not.

In summary, I think that you should treat the starport class as an indication of
the quality (and not necessarily the size) of starport facilities. 
Forex:
(Class A, Lo Pop) The privately-owned Orbital Docking Complex (ODC) 
on Kafdan-7 (vassal world of the Ithuukan noble family) can only handle up to
1,000 tons of vessels at once, but all possible ship needs can be catered for in
a luxury environment (to say nothing of the overnight entertaiment).

(Class C, Med-Hi Pop) Desolate Down Starport is a sprawling concrete
wasteland built on the edge of the Dark Hills.  Hundreds of bulk transports in the 
MegaTon range land every hour to take away the precious lanthanum that has 
brought humanity to this rock-ball.

I hope this helps

I can see the ancestry of the 11-th Century Midi Ashgauum (or some such

That\'s a good lodestone to follow in designing a ship -- what would _my_
players like? A 60-ton fighter with J-6 and a spinal mount, perhaps?

Yep, IIRC, the  "Sylea"-class BB is 200Ktons . . . but for my M0 game, 5Kt
_is_ a DN/CVA hull. Time to whip out FF&S if you still want the big boys.

> - --Glenn 
	I still think Strephon was right to leave Capital to investigate 
the Empress Wave but even_if_he was wrong to leave that does not 
mean that he was wrong to miss his meeting with Dulinor.  Just because 
two important politicians are in the same room does not make the meeting 
important.  It can be just a ceremonial public affirmation of details 
that have already been worked out, or evan just a photo opportunity. The 
same situation can apply to the meeting with the Aslan ambassador 
(although they probably would not see it that way)

	  It is not Strephons JOB to make Dulinor happy, it his job to 
run the Imperium.  While feudal loyalties do run both ways & Strephon 
does owe Dulinor something for his "loyalty" (at least as far as 
Strephon knew) this loyalty takes second place to duty.  Dulinor should 
trust that if Strephon is gone he has a very good reason to be gone. He 
owes his place as Archduke to Strephon & Strephon got some unfavorable 
reactions for appointing him as Archduke.

	We also have no reason to assume Dulinor would_know_that he was 
dealing with a duplicate.  It has never been cannonically established 
(anywhere I have seen) that Dulinor & Strephon had a personal 
relationship that would let Dulinor recognize a fake or that the meeting 
was informal enough that he would get the chance if he could. 
	
	As for the notion that Strephon knew that Dulinor was having 
problems with him the data does not support that either.  Yes the 
reforms that Dulinor advocated were not going much of anywhere 
Imperiumwide but the fact that they went anywhere & that he had a chance 
to try any reforms is due to Strephons appointing him Archduke.  
Strephon presumably knew that Dulinor was disappointed but he had no 
reason to believe that Dulinor would Go Postal on him with a gun.  That 
is the job of the spies to anticipate & they are the ones who failed - 
not Strephon.

	Another point you is that the duplicate of Strephon who was 
killed by Dulinor was a CLONE of Strephon.  If Strephon can not trust 
his own clone, someone who is genetically identical to him, was raised 
to fill in for him, & has been pretending to be him for the last 50 
years or so, who can he trust.  Moreover who says that a clone does not 
have as much right to act as Emporer as the "real" Strephon does - a 
difference that makes no difference IS no difference.	

	It seems to me that a lot of the analysis of the rebellion that 
I have seen on the list uses the benefit of 20-20 hindsight.  Yes a Very
Bad Thing happened because Strephon was gone - but Strephon had no way 
to know this & based on the data he had he did the right thing.

        Seems like someone else noted that exception for shotguns to the
rule that weapons do only a max of 3 dice damage and decided to try and
exploit it to the hilt...  why am I not surprised :)?

        I\'ve been working on an automatic shotgun for our upcoming
Traveller game.  I haven\'t run it through FF&S yet, just done some sketches
with my CAD program.  It looks to be a very different beast; it\'s only
70-odd cm long with the stock folded, with a 25-round drum magazine.  The
barrel works out to being about 30 cm...  Essentially, it\'s a full-auto
sawed-off shotgun.

The whole concept is simple, cheap, mass-produced, mostly plastic horror
weapon for defending starships (with side markets for quelling riots in a
hurry, hunting sparrows flocks at a time, and so forth), so no gizmos.
Personally, I doubt _anyone_ needs a laser sight to hit something with a
fully automatic shotgun with a barrel a foot long :).  I\'ll post it when I
get it designed, (over Xmas).

William Hostman suggested copying grids onto transparencies to solve the "no

Another way to solve the problem is to photocopy the deckplans onto graph

the advanatage of not slipping when in use.

Actually there are rules re: crew quality in BL & BR, as well there should
be.  A trained, experienced, and motivated crew is a greater asset that a
*slightly* better ship.  It ain\'t just the bus, it\'s who\'s driving it.

Don\'t confuse a long career with an elite crew.  Elite forces are those who
are trained and experienced, but not yet worn out from constant fighting.
 Reserve forces, by their very nature, don\'t get into a whole lot of fights,
so the idea of them being *elite* is very, very unlikely.  Mind you, they
would be fighting to protect their homes, which has got to count for some
sort of advantage, though I see reserves vs. ihatei as something of a
stalemate at best for the Regency.

I have stayed out of this one for a while, but here\'s my Cr 0.02:

If Norris tried to cross Corridor for the purposes of helping Strephon, or
himself, to reintegrate the Imperium, the results likely would be disastrous.
 I don\'t believe that the Regency has the naval strength for extended
campaigns toward Capital, *and* defending it\'s spinward flank.  As I said
above, the reserve fleets could probably hold their own, and little else, vs.
the ihatei, the Vargr or the Sword Worlds, but against a coalition of the
same with or without the Zhodani, they would be hard pressed to achieve any
significant victories.  If the Zhodani were to support a new Outlands
Coalition (of the Sword Worlds and Vargr, and possibly the ihatei), (a none
too unlikely scenario, given the fact that the "joes" wouldn\'t welcome a
reunited Imperium) the reserve fleets would be hip deep in what would hit the
fan.  

Now to really throw y\'all a curve:  I don\'t believe Norris would agree that
it is in the best interest of the Regency to reunite the Imperium anyway.
 His reforms are far easier for him to enact "behind the Claw," without a
distant emperor trying to tell him what is best for his domain.  Remember,
Norris is a man who used his advance knowledge of the emperor\'s death to
elevate himself to a position of greater authority, a fairly mercenary
tactic, regardless of how altruistic his motives were.  He is a former
intelligence officer who must have been planning some kind of radical (by
Imperial standards) course for Deneb for some time, and saw an opportunity
when he received that fateful message.  What good would it do him to now
subjugate himself, and his territory, to the larger desires of a reunited
Imperium?  Very little good, indeed.  An interesting "alternate future,"
starting prior to the assassination of Strephon might involve Norris seizing
power and Deneb seceding from the Imperium.  Given my feelings about the
power controlled by the dukes which I\'ve expressed here before, it isn\'t that
unlikely a scenario.  Really.  Norris is surrounded on all sides (except for
a few subsectors to trailing) by societies which distrust the Imperium (the
Zhodani), dislike the Imperium (the Sword Worlds), want to invade it\'s lands
(the Aslan), or want to plunder it\'s wealth (the Vargr).  Norris supports
fairly radical notions of government (again, by Imperial standards) and seeks
acceptance of psionics in general and the Zhodani specifically.  The Zhodani
would be pleased by this turn of events (a psionic-tolerant, non-expansionist
polity with plenty of high-tech resources would be a valuable and welcome
trading partner), and probably would be able to help keep the Sword Worlds
and Vargr in line.  Likewise, the Aslan could be coopted effectively using
the tactics seen in the Regency sourcebook (offering land to some clans in
return for patrolling the border, keeping other clans out, thereby avoiding
direct conflict between the Regency and the Aslan governments).  Just an idea
I\'ve been brewing for a while.  What do you think?

No Rob, you are not the only one that would prefer less (not no) color art
and cheaper books. I picked up the Starships book last night (which means
it\'s hit Minneapolis/St. Paul) and have taken a quick spin through it. It
is very pretty and I have no complaints the illustrations, other than the
quantity and the amount of color. I did not think, however, it was a $20
book. Based on the content and comparing it with my White Wolf, Call of
Cthulhu, and other systems, based on content, I\'d rate it a $10-12 book,
$15 at the outside.

The information inside is nice, I\'ve played Traveller for a long time, but
not as GM. So, except for what I can pick up here and there, I\'ve very few
CT books, no MT books, and some of the TNE books. I was and am looking
forward to the other books, but if the price stays this high, I\'ll
reconsider. I know that today\'s audiences, especially the younger audiences
need the pretty pictures to be intrigued (a gross generality, I know).
However, if they are survivors of the White Wolf Maelstrom, the continued
supplements at $18-25 will be a disadvantage rather than an advantage.

What I really liked about the outstanding ship descriptions in "Safari
Ship", "Signal GK", "Death Station" and, of course, "Kinunir" was the
fact that each room on the ship was numbered, and there was in the text
an itemized description that told what was in each room, and often what
the room looked like.

I couldn\'t agree more. I\'ve never been an "arty" kinda guy, so as far as
Trav art goes, it has never been more than a recruitment tool for me.
In the past, much of Traveller\'s art has been rather bleak looking line 
drawings, not so great for recruitment. Given my needs and purposes,
Foss is easily the best artist who has ever worked for Trav (I\'ve been
playing since 1979).

I just asked a similiar question about grenades and here\'s what I 
gathered from all of the informed minds on this list.

I\'ve simplified this, just like the T4 rules are simplified, but 
basically, here\'s how I\'m playing explosions.

If a grenade is in physical contact with a surface or character, I 
let it do full damage.  In this manner, you can still have breaching 
charges for starship hulls and so forth.  But, I do not allow 
concussion damage if the target is not in physical contact.

I have my explosives, in my House Rules system, rated, like in TNE, 
for both concussion and fragmentation damage.  For example, take the 
generic grenade listed in the T4 main book.  It says that it does 7 
dice damage (and under the really simply T4 rule, this is all 
considered fragmentation damage).  In my game, I\'ve split this 
grenade into its concussion and fragmentation components.

The same grenade looks like this:

Concussion Damage:  2
Burst Radius:  5

Here\'s the section from my House Rules on grenades.  I\'ve modified 
this from the TNE rules.

24.  Special Rule--Hand Grenades.  This rule modifies the hand grenade
rule listed on pg. 59 of T4.  Roll a normal to hit throw as described in the thrown
  weapon rules, and a successful hit means that the grenade landed
  with the target in the primary burst radius.  A miss indicates
  that the scatter rules must be used--see below.  A spectacular
  success means that the grenade actually landed on the target when it
  exploded--apply double damage.

  Concussion.
  Grenades have two values listed in their damage columns.  One
  designates the concussive force of the grenade indicated with a
  "C".  The number beside this indicates how many damage dice the
  grenade does due to concussion.  The second listing is a number
  with a "B".  This is the grenade\'s primary burst radius in meters. 
  Targets within this burst radius will be hit by fragments--how
  many depends (see below).

  Targets at greater range than the primary burst radius, up to twice
  the primary burst radius, are in the weapon\'s secondary burst
  radius.  Targets in this secondary burst radius will take less
  damage than those in the primary burst radius.  These ranges 	
  continue until no more damage can be applied to targets, but the
  damage rating of the grenade is reduced at each burst radius. 
  When the damage of the grenade drops below 1, the grenade cannot
  inflict any more damage.  Use the chart below to determine the
  damage a grenade does due to concussive force.  When applying 	
  concussion damage use the second column on the critical hit chart to
  determine location.

  Concussive Damage for grenades.

                                Indoor or Enclosed Areas            Outdoor or Open Areas
  Burst Radius	                 Full damage                          Full damage
  2 x Burst Radius            1/2 damage                           1/4 damage
  3 x Burst Radius            1/4 damage                           1/8 damage
  4 x Burst Radius            1/8 damage                            1/16 damage

  Fragmentation.
  Characters in the burst radius will also be hit with fragments
  (given that the grenade is designed to throw fragments).  Roll on
  one of the charts below to see how many fragments hit targets
  based on which burst radius they are in.  Each fragment in the 	
  primary burst radius will do 2 D6 damage.  Each fragment in the
  secondary (or beyond) burst radius will do 1 D6 of damage.

  PRIMARY BURST RADIUS               SECONDARY BURST RADIUS

  D6        Shrapnel                                     D6          Shrapnel	
  1-2        No fragments                             1-3        No fragments
  3-4        1 fragment                                  4-5        1 fragment
  5-6        1 D6 fragments                           6           1 D6 fragments

  Deviation.
  If the to hit throw fails, the grenade will deviate.  Use one of the
  two charts below depending on which way the character was
  throwing.  Roll two dice.  The result will indicate which
  direction the grenade scatters before it explodes.  The center
  square indicates the target square.  ^ or \\ indicates the
  direction of the throw (pointing towards the 7).  Distance is
  calculated by rolling 2 D6 and halving the result.

SCATTER DIAGRAM			DIAGONAL SCATTER DIAGRAM

  6		7		8		7		8		9

  5		^		9		4		\\		4,12

  2,10		3,11		4,12		5		2,11		3,10

  Other Notes for Grenades.
  1.	The 3 D6 maximum damage rule does not apply to grenades.
  2.	Handle fragmentation attacks just like slug throwers--armor can
  block the frags. 
  3.	Concussion effects ignore armor. 
  4.	The concussive damage of a grenade can be ignored based on the situation
  i.e. in a vacuum.
  5.	There may be some protection from partial cover such as crouching
  behind a vehicle or hunkering down in a foxhole.  The GM makes the final
   decision, but partial cover could afford half damage from
   concussion.  For instance, this would be the case if a character
   was lying prone in a foxhole.  Partial cover may effect 	
   fragmentation damage as well.
  6.	Characters in small, tight enclosures such as armored vehicles,
  small concrete rooms, or narrow trenches suffer automatic double 
concussion damage.


And here\'s a section from my House Rules on zero-G/vacuum combat.

5.	Vacuum Grenades.  Grenades will not produce concussion in vacuum.
If the grenade is in physical contact with a target (not just in
the primary burst radius), the 	 grenade will provide explosion damage
(the same as the concussion damage) to the target.

  All fragments from a grenade exploded in vacuum will do 2 D6
  damage--no matter the burst radius.  Although there is no concussion, the
burst radius of the grenade should still be calculated (based on
concussion damage as normal) to determine fragmentation effects. 
Although the grenade is not losing force, this will simulate the
spread of the fragments, and therefore make it harder to hit
individuals at great distance.


As far as HE rounds go, I allow a danger space like in CT and MT, but 
in space, I do not allow use of the danger space.  I do not decrease 
the damage an HE round does when it hits a target though.

Maybe this is enlightening.  Maybe this is confusing.  But since 
right now, in my game, we are in the middle of a huge fight in 
zero-G, I had a lot of information on the subject.

I hope it helps.

Since I am not a computer guru, I made my earlier statement about 
posting deck plans here out of ignorance.  I can see from the 
comments that this would not work well.  

Oh well, it was a good thought.  I\'ve noticed that sometimes, if I 
print a page with graphics on it from a site, I will have pictures on 
my printed copy and sometimes I won\'t.  I just don\'t know how to make 
them appear all the time.

Bummer. I suppose that makes acetate sheets with a standard sized

    'body' => 'I just thought of an alternate way for computing "skill assets" for TNE. 
It\'s based on the method used by HERO Games (Champions, and others).  In
the HERO System, an attribute usually ranges from 8-10 (average) to as
high as 23-25 (exceptional) for human (non-superhero) characters.  The
base "asset" (chance of success) on 3d6 is 9+(attribute/5).  Thus, the
average chance of success in HERO is "11-" on 3d6 for a charcter having
the skill in question at the base level.

For TNE, I would suggest using "Asset = 6 + (Attribute/3) + Skill Level"
as an alternate method of computing skill assets.  A character having an 
average attribute (5-7) and a modest skill level (2) would have an asset
of 10 (6+2+2), which -- for me -- is about right (a 50% chance of success
for a Difficult task).  This method would reduce the effects of extreme
attributes without further inflating the value of extreme skill levels
(skill levels of 10+ are not uncommon using the character generation as
presented).  

I\'d appreciate your thoughts on this.  Thank you.

Thank you, Suz.

I was just starting a MegaTraveller campaign after not even SEEing 
Traveller for 10+ years.  I don\'t have alot of material.  First
thing I did was look for this list. ---- Lo and behold, T4 was
on it\'s way.  I\'ve switched because it captures the feeling I
remember from when I first saw Traveller.  Those "old" starship
plans, I NEED \'em...  I\'ve got some stuff culled from the net,
but I still need more info.  I\'m waiting for the CSC with bated
breath.

1. Say what everything is - it\'s really annoying to find a room on a

2. Grid squares.

3. Consistent symbology - CT defined this, but for some reason TNE

There is a certain symmetry with these, trading off time spent/relaxed
atmosphere for range of prescience. I would make all part of the same
psionic skill, adding one at a time (in any order) as the character gets
more adept at using it (stopping at any time--prescience is tricky and
hard to control). I think you should add:

"Prophecy" gives you the ability to foresee specific events in the future
that will result if events proceed as they currently are proceeding. This
must be done in a truly relaxed state (e.g., while dreaming). Since using
this ability would tend to alter the future, events in the near future are
almost imposible to foresee--it is very hard to control this ability at
all, in fact. It is up to the individual to determine the meaning of the
event that is foreseen. If an event is foreseen, it should be very hard to
avoid (although events can be manipulated so that foreseen events were not
what was originally thought).

There could also be some use for all of these skills going backwards in
time. Backwards "anticipation" would work almost the same, allowing you
to duck blows, etc. "If sense" would be useful when pursuing someone.
"Hindsight" would let you know if someone had passed through in the past
day. The opposite of "prophecy" might let you detect major (or violent)
events that happened in the past.

Interestingly enough, prophecy (and its reverse) are the two skills most
commonly attributed to "psychics" today.

For the record, I hate using psionics in Traveller. But if I were going
to use them, I would certainly include prescience skills. These "feel"
like psychic phenomena. All of the other psionic skills have equivalent
magic spells in D&D (shudder).

post it.

	This is starting to get as bad as when the Great Split appeared in
the list...I don\'t want that to happen again.

	This list is for ALL things Traveller, whether you like it or not;
that\'s the point behind free speech, folks. At least Kenneth\'s posts have
substance to them and aren\'t long point by point bickering over technical
details. Whether you think the substance is any good is up to you, but it
is not your place to demand to not see it.

	The argument for simply pointing to a web site could easily be
extended to everything on the list; at which point you could wonder what
the point of a mailing list is.

	But I like the group nature of the list, and the fact that there
are a wide variety of viewpoints here...inspiration comes from all over,
in Great Adventure postings, in ship design postings, in, yes, arguing
over the finer points of the Weak force. The more people are shouted down
here, the less valulable this list becomes to all...

	As a point of fact, how about some of you gearheads, instead of
whining about how \'un-traveller\' Foss art is, come up with a good,
rational Traveller-esque idea to explain the \'Monorail track in the Sky\'

	Let\'s have a competition...I\'m sure some of you out there have
imaginations unfettered by 20 years of rigid adherence to canon!

	Me, I\'m wondering about the possibilities of Roller Coaster design
with the addition of contra-grav technologies.  How about completely non

casino/whatever developed to take advantage of some weird ruling by a
local court that airspace structures aren\'t taxable by ground governments.

I would really rather that the list be for everything readable (ie, not

radical position, but it\'s the way I\'d like it to be.  I expecially don\'t

Sounds like a good idea.  I\'ll even donate a free copy of Starships to be 
the prize, as long as you do the judging and take the heat for the whole

I agree with Trent on this.  Please put the deck plans on one of the many excellent

Gimme a bloody break! Giant Robots!

My favorite description of Giant Combat Robots can be found in the
supplement Trident/RMBK for Living Steel: 70 tons of junk, 70 tons of
Molten Slags, 70 tons of useless scrap".  Giant Robots, while
technically feasable in Traveller terms (remember the mention in 101
vehicles), they are useless militarily.  The pressure on the ground
would make these vehicles useless on any type of terrains but the
hardest.  The technology (and space) required to put legs on something
like that and make it walk is useless when one can think of what you can
put on a grav tank.  The signature of these things would be so great as
to make them useless militarily.  Any decent missiles would blow them to
pieces.  It would be sufficient to blow one leg away to make these
vehicles stationary.  At least a stationary tank can be thought of as a
light pillbox that can rotate.  A stationary mech is but a target.  You
couldn\'t put any decent armor on these things because of the weigt ratio
(you don\'t want your mech to end up in the ground evertime).  Think
there is a reason for tracks on tanks.  Once more, while building mechs
is a fun thing to do using the traveller rules (even FF&S), any decent
general would prefer to donate them to his enemies in the hope that they
would use them.  This was my ranting for today.  This closes our
programming for today.  Thank you :-#).

A 10,000 lb bomb would likely leave a huge crater.  In Vietnam, the US forces used 
fuel air explosives ("FAE") to flatten the plant growth.  FAE works by filling a large, 
spherical volume of air with a highly volatile fuel and then combusting it (which 
results really in a detonation).  The concussive force is enormous, and the explosion 
has the side effect of getting rid of all of the oxygen in the affected area (most 
oxygen is consumed by the fuel air explosion, and the rest is pushed out by the blast). 
The center of the sphere was well above the ground, and all trees, grasses, huts, and 
anything else that was relatively soft, would be flattened so that it was safe to land 
helicopters.

During the siege of Saigon in 1975, the ARVN and US forces used FAEs against NVA 
headquarters units, with devastating results.  

Depending on where you\'re landing your spaceship, FAE might be a good approach.  If 
you\'re landing it in Vietnam, it would not be, because the ground is often very soft, 
and the weight to surface area ratio of your landing gear may not be as favorable as 
that of a Huey.

A big bomb might therefore be better; it might blast a hole to the bedrock.

If it\'s a covert landing, why land at all?  Surely you can hover on contragravity close 
enough to the ground that the team to be inserted can get down by jumping, rappelling, 
being lowered by rope, or using grav belts.  Now if it\'s a covert extraction, especially 
involving a few tons of contraband, you may have some other problems, but gravitic 
technology should resolve them.  Maybe put several grav belts on the contraband? Pick it 
up with the ship\'s air/raft?

>I wouldn\'t want a FAE on MY ship!  

Well, if you store the compenents safely and put them together just before you\'re going 
to use it, you should be all right.  Maybe the fuel should have two parts that won\'t 
combust until they\'ve mixed together for a while.  What do the chemists think of this 
solution?

Well, OK, but how do you describe Chicago-O\'Hare?  I realize in-system and
on-world traffic is likely to be much heavier than off-world traffic, but I
bet Regina, or Mora, or Vincennes get more than 1000 passengers per hour in
M:1100.  And what about Terra?  As a "fer instance," Mora has a population of
tens of billions, and is on a major trade route in a heavily developed area.
 Assume the lowest population multiplier gives somewhere around 10 billion
folks on-world.  If one-one-hundredth of one percent of those people travel
off world per year, the starport would have to handle 1141.5 passengers
*outbound* per hour, (assuming a Terran year) never mind inbound.  I have
always assumed that a Class-A facility is able to handle whatever is thrown
at it, using multiple highports and downports, each capable of handling at
least 10000 tons of ships (be it 50 Free Traders or 5 Type TI Frontier
Transports), and all the cargo and passengers they can carry, supplemented by
smaller orbital and groundside "berthing and repair" facilities that aren\'t
part of the starport proper.  I also imagine that most larger vessels are
"parked" in orbit, since space is much larger than the ground below.  Again,
a Type-TI might land for the loading or unloading of high- and
mid-passengers, but would then be assigned an orbit, rather than sitting on
the ground when not in use.  IMHO, of course.

No, but it would be on the order of the difference between Japanese WW2
carriers and US ones at least (say a max of 80 planes for a large Jap CV
vs. 120 for a large US one - 1/3rd more!). I suspect that similar benefits
would accrue - but I\'m waiting for Starships to design one, and even when I
get it, hulls are evidently limited to 5000 tons! I refuse to use the
unusable FF&S and don\'t have *Blunt Hairpins* and *Cattle Carriers*, and
Book #5 "High Guard" can\'t really do it justice. Still, maybe I\'ll try to
put something together for a future "Dark Star" ... after all, we\'re told
that the (otherwise poorly designed) 10 ton Fighter is what makes the
Imperium superior to its competitors ... so maybe its the *number* they can
carry on their carriers that gives them the edge?

Depends on the mission parameters and the environment.  If you are dealing
with a fair tech level (7 or even 6), sophisticated orbital surveillance
is possible.  To reduce the chance of detection, 1 trip down and 1 trip up
maybe more favorable.

So far as why not use a air raft?  I can\'t remember where I saw it, but
using an air/raft to reach even low orbit takes a considerable amount of
time (6 hours is what I recall), I would imagine a similar amount of time
applies to the grav belt.

While a ship\'s boat (preferably with a HIGH G M-Drive) would be infinitely
preferable, if I were smuggling in cargo, I would prefer to reduce my
detection by reducing the number of penetrations required.  (ie. if the
ship can do it in one trip, and the ships boat needs 4, use the ship)

Still requires a fairly large bomb casing, which eats cargo cubage.

All things being equal, I prefer soft landings (ie. fluid) to hard when I
just HAVE to land in the wilds.  Any hard landing will leave evidence, and
there is always a greater chance of mishap.  (of course, any pilot worth
his pay will tell you that\'s where the fun is!)

Ooooooh.  This got me thinking...

First off, in John Varley\'s _Steel Beach_ (a must read, btw), he describes
a roller coaster on the surface of the Moon (at the site of the Apollo 11
landing, no less...I seem to recall the place was called "Armstrong
Park").  Along with the typical loops and dives and so forth one expects
from a coaster, this puppy featured a ballistic section -- track ends, car
flies free in a long arc to other track section which grabs it
magnetically, ride continues.  This would require slightly better
fail-safe technology than we have now, but not by much...and, of course,
relies on the lunar vacuum to make the car\'s arc utterly predictable given
a fixed "launch speed."  This sounded like *major* fun.

Add in gravitics, and the fun increases exponentially.  The possibilities
are endless, but here\'s a good trick I just thought up.  Car enters long,
dark or disorientingly lit tunnel, visibly straight.  While inside, grav
generators gradually rotate "down" 180 degrees, with the track following a
long half-helix through the tunnel -- so when you pop out into daylight
again, you\'re *upside down*, hanging from your seat harness, the sky below
you, ground above, all in an instant.  Perfect time to throw you into a
nice loop-and-corkscrew, don\'t you think? :)

Just imagine it..."Nine Flags Over Sylea"...

"Die Weltbund" - "The World Union", but probably translates to "The
Confederaton of Worlds".

Since folks discussed planet names some time ago (BTW, you may like to know
that almost every town in Oz has a "George Street" or "Victoria Street" ;-),
some planets in that subsector are:

Liebeskinder - "Child\'s Love" (or should that be "young love"?)
Quatsch - "Rubbish" ("Trash" to you Yanks)
Abwehr - "Protection"
Beinbruch - "Broken Bone" (what, a high-G world??)
Bundestag - something like "Confederation Cornerstone" but probably means
"Seat of Power" (yes, it\'s the capital of the die Weltbund confederation)
Bierstube - "Beer Hall", ie. the pub
Gasthof - "Hotel"
Oberprasidenten - "Highest Capital" (this is the subsector capital)
Ewig Weibliche - "Eternally Female" (or is this "Forever a Woman"? ;-)
Vierjahrezeiten - "Four Seasons"
Liebeslied - "Love Song"

In Liberty Hall, there are:

Platz - "Place" (with a name like this, even "Earth" - ie. *dirt* - sounds
more imaginative! ;-)
Schloss Adler - "Eagle\'s Castle" (or is this "Eagle\'s Nest", wasn\'t this
Hitler\'s retreat?)
Nervenheilanstalt - "Nerve Healing Place" (??? well, maybe. Maybe just
"Nerve Centre")
Staatsbibliothek - "State Library"

I think you\'ll find that these were done up by English-speakers (hence
feminine "die" with masculine "bund") for a bit of a laugh - another
in-joke. You can do that in English too - I\'ve met a titan and a red dragon
that were both called "Bob".

...although that\'s probably just an in-house joke as well.

Perhaps one of our German friends can help us out. Harald Budschedl or
Michael Koehne, are you free??

look the same, they\'re not laid out the same, and the USPs are fairly 
close to those in the previous books (within the constraints of the 
tech level).  That\'s exactly what Milieu 0 needed, IMO.

I haven\'t spotted any glaring typos.  

I love Liam McCauley\'s "Large Armed Freighter" and "Military Frontier 
Cruiser."  They\'re 3000 and 2000 tons displacement, respectively.  Nice, 
big ships that fill a need within the established setting.  Very cool.

And, of course, the SSDS system is excellent.  Dave Golden, Guy Garnett, 
Joe Heck, Merrick Burkhardt, and John H. Bogan Jr. have given the 
Traveller community something really great by creating that system (and 
QSDS, it\'s counterpart).

Unfortunately, I don\'t have TCS :-(

I was thinking _minimum_ requirements, and you\'re quite correct that for
low population worlds, the cargo, passenger, and material handling
requirements for a Class A port could be relaxed. Those related to quality
would be unaffected.
OTOH, it\'s hard to reduce the Class B or other requirements very much at
all: about the only thing reducible is the capacity requirements for cargo
and passengers, and fuel, and those only slightly.

Class A and B starports must have both orbital and ground facilities and
shuttle service between them: this is irreducible. So are the presence and
capacities of the communications equipment. The skills of the key
personnel, such as the Sytem Traffic Control (STC) and Orbital Traffic
Control (OTC) and Medical officer are also irreducible. The ability to
handle specialized cargo in the orbital facility is needed for class A. The
repair equipment requirements can\'t be reduced much. A class-A repair
facility, for instance, would have expensive diagnostic and specialized
equipment needed for overhaul of most models of starship in commercial or
private use. A class B facility would lack many of these, but would still
have the common essential tools to work on each subsystem.

To further distinguish quality of class A from class B starports, add this
requirement for class B ports and substitute it for the onboard shuttle
requirements of the STC.

Class B
Ground Facility)
#) Ambulance/rescue craft with maximum G\'s for tech level of spaceport)

Class A
Orbital Facility
#) 1 On board ambulance/rescue craft with maximum G\'s for the tech level of
the spaceport) and pressurizable hangar
#) 1 On board tug spacecraft. (Assist in fine docking maneuvers for large
starships, and other uses)

Large ships incapable of planetary landings use their own launches and
ship\'s boats at less than class A ports.

High population worlds will undoubtedly have bigger facilities than I have
outlined. It\'s even possible for a facility that would be adequate for
class B on a low population world to be wholly inadequate for the needs of
a world with more traffic and thus only qualify as class C, for instance.
For a low population world to support a class B port, it needs to be
wealthy, and for class A, it needs to be filthy rich.

Also, high population worlds will almost certainly have more than one
ground facilty. These will vary from the listed class (one required) to at
most two levels less as a general rule.  A class A STC would demand OTC at
each ordinary launch or landing site, while any STC and most OTC\'s would
demand at least communication with any such site.
OTOH, more than one orbital facility of the same class is somewhat
redundant.

We need some imput for a future Traveller product.  So what do we need?
We need generic rumors (adventure hooks), hundreds of them!  They need to
be 50 words or less. Rumors are informations PC\'s would hear traveling
through sub-sectors. Rumors can relate to other Rumors you write.  They can
focus on the sector, sub-sector or planet level. The can be about lost
treasures, governments, anything!

Examples:
* There is rumored to be an ruined city of gold in this sector.
* There was a great war that used bio-chemical weapons and some of the
plants have mutated life forms.
* The government on this local planet is very corrupt, the only way to get
things done is to grease palms.
* There is a secret order of terrorist who want to destroy any members of
the Imperium.

All rumors submitted will be owned by FarFuture Enterprises if published.
However, you will receive a name credit in the book.  All entries must be
e-mailed by 12-15-96.  Send them to whitman@pensys.com.  Please type the

        I figured out a dead simple way of doing perfect hexes to the right
size, and proportions, using a drawing program:

        Start with one circle drawn by diameter and then draw circles by
radius around its perimeter, then draw lines from point of intersection to
point of intersection, delete all circles, and group all the lines into one
object (transparent circles are the best way to do this :>).  Then you
rotate it 90 degrees to get a horizontal line on top.  It\'s just like
doodling with a compass in grade school...

        Soon as I get some time (after the 18th), I\'m going to try and do
an 8-1/2"*11" sheet covered with my handy dandy homebrew hexgrid (I already
have my perfect single hex, all I need to do is duplicate, align and group
until exponential magic takes over).  Depending on the import & export
capabilities of the software involved, I could be persuaded to release it,
complete with my own Vaccsuited Human Figure(tm) in one corner as a visual
size guide.  Is there anyone interested, and if so, in what scales would
you want it in: 1:25, 1:50, 1:75, 1:100, or whatever?

        Finally, would an x-meter hex be measured a) x meters along one
side from corner to corner, x meters across as measured by a line drawn
from one corner through the center to the opposite corner, or x meters from
center of one side through the center to the center of the opposite side?

One of the reasons I love SF gaming is the sense of wonder in discovering
something new.  My favorite stories include "Rendevous with Rama" and the
HeeChee series, precisely because I thought they did an outstanding job of
evoking the feeling explorers would have when they stumbled across evidence of
an alien civilization.

So, I guess I don\'t look at the Foss artwork and think "That\'s impossible!",
but rather "How is that possible?  What technology could have created it, and
what was it used for?"

However, I strongly feel that those pages with black borders were a _bad_ idea
- - it makes the artwork hard to see.

effect of HE in vacuum: Zip, zero, nada, nil, none, nothing
Fragmentation on the other hand: faster, deadlier, longer ranged, more fatal due to ripping of 
pressurized suits
HOWEVER...if you are touching the explosive as it goes off, 100% transfer of explosive

        Well, everyone I finally got my copy of T4 (thanks Joe!!!), and I
must say, I\'m impressed, but only at first.  The art work certainly gives it
some \'oomph\' but this only lasts until I realize that except for the front
cover picture (which I love), none of it really fits Traveller, and is
pretty much generic science fiction artwork.  However, I suppose art takes a
while to produce, so, for the main rulebook, it\'s not a crime I guess.  Just
hope it didn\'t give people the wrong idea of Traveller technology.
        I like the majority of Larry Elmore\'s artwork, it really adds to the
flavour of the book, and the somewhat continuing story throughout it (via
the captions) is quite good.  One picture I don\'t like on the weapons
section is the laser pistol, which looks like a 50s SF \'ray-gun\' not a
\'real\' laser pistol.  The rest were pretty well done.
        The Exit Visa and Rubicon Cross adventures were a good idea to
through in, and they should be good to run through with my PCs.  Also, one
part I thought was very well laid out was the character generation section,
which seems to have been thought out very well indeed.
        As we all know, and I agreee, the QSD sections was badly done, but
since I have access to the Internet version I don\'t mind.  However, again,
considering it wasn\'t going to be in at all, it\'s better than nothing for
people who don\'t have Internet access.

        I won\'t get into rules dicusssion as that\'s been done to death a
while back on the list.  I will say that although there\'s lots of typos and
such, it\'s easily readable, and usable (contrary to some USEnet claims I
heard).  It\'s a good way for Traveller to return, but the quality of product
does need to be imporved. 

Thanks for listneing...just my 2 cents worth (or is ti 2 credits...)

Two questions. What\'s your address?  And , are their print versions of both
magazines still left?  if so, how much dot hey cost.  Lastly, how identical
to the original are the computer versions.  Do they have art, etc?

The thing that leapt immediately to my mind was the logistics of 
manning the fighters in a crisis.  On a wet navy carrier, the pilots 
run out on deck and jump in their planes.  That doesn\'t work in a 
space navy.  10,000 externally mounted fighters means to me that you
have 10,000 pilots running down 10,000 corridors to get to the 
10,000 hatches which lead to them.  How many and how long would the 
corridors have to be in order to give access to all those fighters?  
How much internal volume would have to be didicated to those 
corridors?  What provision would you make for recovering damaged fighters 
when you have 10,000 different docking locations?

External mounting is a great idea for small numbers of large(relative 
to the carrier) riders, it is IMHO unworkable for large numbers of 
small riders.

Actually, IMHO, a Fuel-Air Explosive device would probably be one of the 
easiest and safest types of (non-nuclear) explosives to carry.  The 
components are, strangely enough, fuel and air.  The fuel can be 
carried in liquid form and would be safe enough until vaporized. (If 
you drop a match into a bucket of gasoline, it will go out.  Don\'t 
try this on a hot day when gas vapor is present.)  The size of the 
bomb casing would be whatever is necessary to hold the volume of fuel 
desired. It would not be necessary to provide the air, unless you 
wanted to use it outside an atmosphere----Hey!  this ties right in to 
the explosives in vacuum thread----a FAE is a pure concussion device, 
but it could do a lot of damage in a vacuum because the explosion 
would take place throughout a large volume of space. 
Q-How much damage do you take from concussion in a vacuum if
 you are _surrounded_ by the explosive?  A- _Lots!_

I don\'t understand this.  Six Gravities is a measurement of accelleration just as 
six miles is a measurement of distance and six kilos is a measurement 
of mass.

The steam catapult was needed to quickly get the airplane to a speed 
where the wings would generate sufficient lift for it to fly.  This 
is not a problem in space.

All of the color illustrations are recycled works.  I\'m not sure about

Nope... the cover isn\'t new either.

OTOH, I really like his work... Although, you\'re right that it doesn\'t
seem very Travellerish.  Most of the ships he draws are way to big for
Traveller, IMHO.  Also, I have seen much better b+w works by him...  All
the b+w works in T4 and T4:Starships look like quick, rough sketches.

Only if, by dint of that act, you could _legally_ take over his job _and do it
better yourself_. Now be honest. You know he/they were bad; so do I. I know,
deep in my heart, that given a job like VP of the USA I\'d probably make a hash
of it. I\'m not trained or talented for it. Dulinor thought he could _improve_
things by taking over - and had tried everything else first.

BTW, for years my wife kept asking me to go to London and run over Margaret
Thatcher...

But I agree with your analysis of his later actions. Craig? Never thought of
him. Y\'know, the quiet little guy...:)

No ship in traveller has ever had a drive that works this way.  gs
are acceleration.  T-plates are just reactionless rockets (kind of
an oxymoron, but you know what I mean).

You accelerate with t-plates as you would with any drive, that\'s why
there is so much talk about planet-killing lifeboats linked to
t-plates----they can accelerate as long as you can make electricity
to power the drive.

        I\'d disagree to an extent; the shock wave of an explosion is due to
the very rapid expansion of the combustion gases due to the extremely high
pressure caused by the combustion being transmitted through the atmosphere,
no?  So up close to an explosion in a vacuum, you\'d have a lot of gas
expanding away to dissipate: there\'d be no shock wave per se since there\'s
no atmosphere, but I\'d argue that there\'d be some sort of pressure effect,
decreasing with the inverse square law (???), that would be felt...  A lot
of hot gas expanding away at high speed is surely not going to be a good
thing to be near regardless of atmosphereic pressure.

        Reminds me of that IMAX flick Destiny in Space, where after
replacing a Hubble solar panel, the shuttle crew knocked the discarded
panel away by hitting it with bursts from an attitude jet...i.e. more
expanding gases;  you just see the panel floating there, and all of a
sudden it jerks and billows like it just got hit by a gust of wind; which
in a sense it did...

        Igor and I are pleased to announce that we have created LIFE!  YES!
LIFE ITSELF!  Well, actually, no; just hex paper.  And it\'s not ugly, in
fact quite the contrary, and it\'s guaranteed not to kill village children
and bring those damn peasants mobbing up the mountain with torches and
pitchforks to burn down your laboratory.

        Took less than an hour to do, too, and that\'s doing three different
sizes of hex, with a little vacc-suited dude in one corner to give an idea
of scale...

        To Eris and anyone else requiring hex paper in electronic form,
just tell me the size of paper (8-1/2"*11, A4) and the size of hex (1cm, 4
feet, whatever) you\'d like, and I can email it to you in EPSF (Encapsulated
PostScript File) format, either black hexes with white lines, or white
hexes with black lines.  I can also tweak the scale pretty much any way you
need, so if you want 1-meter hexes for a 1:5,000 scale deckplan for an
Imperial BigAssed Motherhuge Dreadnought From Hades drawn onto a single
sheet of paper (you\'d need a magnifying glass to see the hexes, I think)
and ask me nicely, I could probably be persuaded to do a custom job for
you.  Especially if you promise to send me the completed deckplan.

        If this gets too popular, I could also be persuaded to do a few
standard sizes and put them on a web page somewhere.

        Now back to the regularly scheduled wierdness...

Well, quantity does not always mean quality.

I\'m passionate about Traveller, and I like to be creative.  When I 
get the inititaive to write, I look at Traveller, something I know 
and am passionate about, and I write.  It serves a dual purpose for 
me because I also look at it like a writing exercise.  I try to 
experiment and approach things in different way.  You may have 
noticed that I\'ve tried to give each of the character intros to the 
GA a different tone.

It\'s a learning experience for me.  Call it my Traveller notebook.

   I think it does in the context presented, at least as much as any other
psionic talent.  To me, Psionics and truly Hard Science-Fiction are mutually
exclusive concepts.  Frankly, I like my sci-fi a little soft around the

   Because you can see things in the past, present and future and at the
highest level of success feel like your standing next to King John as he
signs the Magna Carta, or as though you are on the deck of the U.S.S.
Constitution as it sends another hapless British frigate to a watery grave
(btw, did you know that the U.S.S. Constitution is still a commissioned U.S.
Navy vessel?), it acts in very much the same way as physical time
travel--without all the paradoxes, dilemmas, and other standard plot devices
that cause headaches and periodic reader\'s anxiety.

I plan to put a huge ancient space ship in one of my next adventures.
Of course, no one really knows IF it IS a space ship, as long as they 
don\'t enter it.

The rumour comes from media.
"Channel ???? News: A big artifact, probably of ancient origin, is 
floating at the boarders of Sylean space..."

You can imagine, how many prospecters, luck-seekers, pirates and other 
people you will meet there, no one willing to let anybody set foot on the 
ship.

And you can Imagine, that the ship is FILLED to the top with ancient 
tech (more or less usable as it\'s been out of business for quite a 
while)!

Hope this gives you the same kick as me ;-)

        I toyed around with some FFS -based mech designs, but I also
        reached the above conclusion. Mechs were generally too large,
        slow and heavy, and fell too easily to prey of any decent
        helicopter gunship, grav tank, or assault speeder.

        Landmate armor (large powered armor, or "micro mech") had some

        mechs just appeared to be large and slow targets.

Not large scale warfare.  As people have pointed out, they would be 
handicapped.  The purpose was for duelling or grudge matches.  Mech 
against mech.  Like in Robojox.  A champion from the contesting worlds 
brought their mechs to an arena to battle.  In this form, the mechs 
would be feasible.

It was done to limit the size of the tables in SSDS, if the tables went
all the way up to 1 million tons, it would make the book huge.  It was
also pointed out, that if someone was into making giant warships, that
they would probably want the full design system and be able to tweak
every part.  (Personally I don\'t know if that is actually true, but I
do agree there needed to be some limit to keep the size managble.) 

If you have FFS you can use it to build hulls of any size and then
stick in SSDS components. If you don\'t have FFS, you will have to wait
until Naval Architect Handbook comes out, with the full design rules. 
I have no idea when this is planned for.

I\'m a little unsure about this.... but it seems to me that the area of effect
of this concussive damage ought to be smaller in these denser atmospheres.  
It takes energy to push the concussion through a dense medium.  Has anyone
studied gasses or fluid dynamics?

If you think this would work, you should try the design yourself. I suspect
it won\'t make a huge difference:
- -externally carried fighters will still need grapples (relatively heavy)
- -you\'ll still need a fair amount of internal hanger space for rearming,
repairing and maintaining
- -large ships that try to carry weapons (as opposed to dedicated carriers)
will run out of surface area
- -most important of all, since empty hanger space doesn\'t way anything, it
doesn\'t save you any weight, which is what really matters for starship
performance. Hull volume does cost you some weight - since it makes your
hull plating mass bigger - but not much, for large, lightly armed carrier.
Manuever drive performance should really only be based on weight...I suppose
the main saving will be because jump drive performance is based on volume
rather than weight, but even there, the saving won\'t turn out to be huge except
for very high jump-performance carriers.

Actually, my question would be, how do you propose to jump this beastie
with all the fighters hanging off the hull?  Cover each fighter with a
lanthium grid?

IMHO, while covering multi Kton battle-riders with a lanthium net to
facilitate a jump IS cost effective, putting lanthium on 10-50 ton
fighters and integrating it into the jump net is not.

Two comments:

How do you jump with any externally grappled ship?  The Traveller 
Adventure\'s March Harrier subsidized merchant carries a launch
externally...  How does this jibe with the rest of "canon"?

OR:

I get a picture of a great ball with thin lanthanum grid around
everything with 1000\'s of pop open doors.  Would be terribly 
vulnerable but that\'s what covering fighters are for.

Actually this goes to a deeper problem.  Let\'s take a ship into
combat:  If the lanthanum grid has to be outside everything, then
a couple of surface hits would disrupt the jump capability of the 
ship.  If the lanthanum grid is inside the armor, how does this 
jibe with something I believe I\'ve read which impied that anything
NOT in the lanthanum grid would be jumpspace affected?  What about
externally mounted items like: sensor receptors, turrets, and of
course your grappled ships?

Comments jump space gurus?

Sonic energy is transmitted better, farther, and faster thru denser
media. Now a concussion is not exactly the same thing as a sound wave,
but it is very analogous. I know for a fact that concussion damage is
far more devastating underwater than it is on land (try to harm
a surface ship by exploding depth charges near it ---- hah!). I would be
stupified to learn that this principle is not generally true.

    'body' => 'I recently snatched at the opportunity to acquire both 101 cargos and 101
plots, both by Jo and Lesley Grant.

Both products are well worth the $7.00 USD Plus Postage.

101 Cargos is full of one or two paragraph descriptions of cargos one
might find in a starport either for freight or as a speculative cargo
(although there are more of the former).  They are imaginitive and
Original, with only a few being obvious references to some cultural icon.

There is also (yet another) Trade system which I haven\'t had the
opportunity to put to thee test.  It seems quite as good as the system in
the Megatraveller Referee\'s manual, or the one on Rob Prior\'s Web Page
which I have found quite good.  Note that the Cargos which are the main
reason for buying the book are not directly selected by the trade system,
rather the trade system (like the MT one or, for that matter, any one I\'ve
seen) gives you a generic description (like "Uniques" or "Bulk
Carbohydrates) which, it so happens, is how the cargo section is
organized.

All the cargos provide the GM using them with a seed for possible
development.  Many are quite amusing.

101 Plots is misnamed.  A note in the beginning explains that, although
there are actually 136 plots, 101 plots sounds nicer.  The plots are all,
again, quite unique and fresh.  Thay are also, in my opinion, very
traveller!  The format is like 101 Patrons, for most of it, with a full
section of advertisements which may be found in the local news-paper
analogue.  

The plots inthe first section start with an explanatory
paragraph suitable for reading out to the players.  Then there are 3-6
options for resolving the situation.  some are quite humorous, others
deadly.  

The adverts are divided into opportunies and red herrings, with a boxed
text of the actual advertisement followed by the GM\'s explanation. 

My favorite section is titles Gimmicks, and I wish I had a whole book of
these.  They are devices or things which are unusual and/or unique and may
provide the players with riches if employed properly, or may be looked at
puzzlingly otherwise.  The best example are "Grav Assisted Stillettos" for
people who wish to wear really high heels, but have poor balance (First
question my players asked "Do they come in hip boots?").

There are plots and cargos which are somewhat interrelated, and could be
strung together.  Some are applicable only to certain kinds of parties
(i.e. those without a ship), but these are few.

All in all a great product.  I give it 4 Starbursts (of Five)

Not very many regulars would be elite either. I didn\'t mean that the reserve
and planetary forces would all be elite, just that they wouldn\'t be green
first-term novices. I don\'t see why either should be much inferior to most
of the regular forces. They\'d\'ve had just as much training albeit perhaps
not quite as much actual combat experience (Though note that the Character
Generation System dosen\'t give them any less combat experience than regulars;
there\'s no distinction made between them at all.)

Any rules for morale effects in BL or BR?

A stalemate is all the Domain needs. And why a stalemate? Crew quality is
propably equivalent; the Domain seems to have the advantage in TL and
numbers. How do you manage to give the Aslans even a stalemate?

Well, as I said rom the start, I don\'t know how much good he could do, just
that it wouldn\'t automatically spell disaster back home.

You may not believe it, but do you have any figures to back it up? Otherwise
we are just going "Can not!" Can too!" at each other. Show me where my
figures are wrong.

1) A significant coalition of Aslans is strange enough. A significant
   coalition of Vargr is even stranger. And a coalition of Aslans AND 
   Vargr is strange beyond belief.
2) The regular fleets represent 15% of the Naval Budget of the Domain. The
   reserve fleets represent another 15%. The planetary defense forces
   represent the remaining 70% with an undefined part of this being jump-
   capable ships. The reserve fleets alone represent more strength than
   _ihatei_, the Sword Worlds, and the relevant part of the Vargr can
   muster. Why should they be unable to to achieve any signifivcant
   victories? It would be more apt to say that they would be unlikely to
   achieve any significant defeats (Though of course there\'s always a 
   possibility that the inferior force can achieve local superiority once 
   in a while).

I\'ve never argued otherwise. If the Zhodani attack the Domain is hip deep
in it, with or without the regular forces. Nor do I argue that it is not
reasonable for Norris to fear such an event. What I\'m arguing about is the
situation if the Zhodani says quiscent.

>Now to really throw y\'all a curve:  I don\'t believe Norris would agree that
>it is in the best interest of the Regency to reunite the Imperium anyway.

And I don\'t believe that that is necessarily relevant. Norris is described
as a man with a high degree of integrity. A direct order from a man he is 
convinced is his feudal overlord could plausibly set him doing something
that is against his better judgement. Though I don\'t think he would strip
the Domain for anybody. Sending off most of his regular fleets would propably 
seem a reasonable compromise between his duties up and down, especially as
the months go by without the Zhodani making any moves.

Actually, the question of how altruistic his motives are is crucial to an
evaluation of his character. And from his personal musings it seems that
they are, indeed, altruistic.

It all comes down to the question of his integrity. You seem to have a
lower opinion of him than I gain from what I\'ve read. I think Norris really
believes in his duty to the Imperium, not just his own corner of it.

OH, and just how great a chance do you think he has of convincing Duchess
Delphine and the other dukes (his peers) to back him? Anything less than 
total cooperation of all the Domain and the Corridor fleet could propably 
settle his hash on its own (unless the Zhodani bails him out). After all, 
the Corridor Fleet really isn\'t necessary to guard against the Vargr; the 
reserve forces should be more than enough to hold Corridor against them.

From everything I have read, and from several discussions in the TML, I
believe the accepted explanation is that the grid creates a field, much a
current passing through a wire creates a magnetic field.  The designed
grid on a ship includes some overlap (I imagine military grids incorporate
a much high overlap in anticipation of damage) to cover failed areas.

So far as externally mounted ship\'s boats (the Gazelle-class CE has one as
well), either the field is extended over the boat via a lanthium grid in
the boat, recessing the boat into the ship enough to be covered by the
surrounding field or perhaps by amplifying the field in that area, or even
by covering the boat prior to jump with a flexible grid (like a boat cover).

All of these ideas, while possible for a single ship\'s boat, are not very
practical for a carrier operating in a combat zone.  Extending the J-field
would leave the ship more vulnerable to combat damage to the net,
recessing the boats into the hull means more time is required for docking
(not to mention increased chance of mishap) or more machinery to draw the
fighters in (especially if they are damaged), and covering each fighter
with a lanthium net would be very time intensive and not practical if a
tactical withdrawal were required.  Of course, the carrier could always
jettison the fighters, but that would leave it unarmed and
vulnerable...and you do not waste resources like that!

Um, yes.  But it was also the name of Germany\'s Military Intelligence

I\'m a little unsure about this.... but it seems to me that the area of effect
of this concussive damage ought to be smaller in these denser atmospheres.  
It takes energy to push the concussion through a dense medium.  Has anyone
studied gasses or fluid dynamics?

Just took my final... (Hope that doesn\'t disqualify me ;>)  )

Higher density media (gases)  would produce higher concussive effects (like
the grenade under water crushing the skull of a swimming frogman type thing
you hear about in all those b-rate movies).  The two main factors of
consideration being sonic velocity, and shock front effects.

1.      the speed of sound in any fluid medium is determined by the
TEMPERATURE (surprise, not density... at least not directly anyway),
expressed as c = (k*r*t)^.5, where k and r are gas constants, and t is
temperature.

2.      shock waves (or fronts) can occur anywhere there is a supersonic
flow (like in some rocket nozzles), and are essentialy a barier between
supersonic media and subsonic media... in the case of an explosion, this is
where the punch is, at the outer shell.  Just remember that you can\'t have a
shockfront without supersonic expansion... the faster the shock travels, the
greater the punch.

In the case of a vaccum, the media for the shock is the gas of the explosion
itself, and the nasty effects would occur at the outer shell only.  (if you
were inside the shell, when the boom happened, your hull would be the shock
front, and you could be crushed, but after the front passes, it is rather
like being inside an atmosphere, as the pressure all around is equal for a time)

The problem in a vaccum is that the shock will attenuate as you run out of
gas to drive it. (This is not a problem in an atmosphere where the
surrounding media helps to carry the blast.)  The overall effect is similar
to a sonic boom (actually, they are the same thing, just different in
scale).  My guess would be that in a vaccum, you have to be fairly close to
an explosion, (or have a realy big one with lots of driving gases) to be
affected much at all.  

BTW, if your media is noncompressable (liquid, instead of gas), all of this
sort of falls apart.  In liquids and solids, the speed of sound is expressed
in layman\'s terms as c=(Elasticity / density)^0.5.  (hence the grenade
underwater thing).  

Hope this helps, (and makes sence)

Brief summary, off the top of my head, Crews are defined as being Green,
Trained or Experienced (I don\'t remember which), Line and Crack.  Basically
the way it works is more experienced crews are more likely to succeed at more
difficult tasks.  BL does it with dice rolls (higher assets per TNE rules,
like the NPC assets in TNE Rulebook), BR does it with cards that are drawn.
 The card lists the success number for an "average" crew, i.e. Experienced or
Line, with option boxes for Green and Crack crews.  In certain cases it may
make no difference (the result in all three boxes is the same) and in some
cases it is dramatic (i.e., the "average" crew succeeds, the Green crew
fails, and the Crack crew achieves spectacular success, double damage, big
explosions, etc.).  I prefer the BL system, since it follows the RPG more
closely.  (Which isn\'t BR\'s fault, really.  It\'s tough for a single character
to have a major impact in a huge fleet action, which is BR\'s intended use).

I know.  That has always bugged me.  Oh, well.

<Much sawing noises>

None that I recall.  Actually, morale in the grossest sense is much easier to
enforce in a shipboard crew (I would think).  After all, what are the
demoralized crew going to do, run away?

Unfortunately, unless someone has data of which I\'m unaware, there aren\'t
numbers to prove this.  I\'m going more on perception, which, of course, is
nothing but a Humble Opinion.  Though as an insight into why I feel this way,
I offer the following:

According to the Regency Sourcebook, Aslan ihatei have captured several
worlds in the Glisten and Trin\'s Shroud (Formerly Trin\'s Veil) subsectors,
and could not be displaced prior to the sealing of Regency borders.  This
despite the fact that the 100th and 207th Fleets (Active, not Reserve) are
headquartered in those subsectors.  Now, these fleets probably didn\'t do too
much to help, but possibly (and I admit it\'s only possibly) because they did
not wish to become involved in a war of attrition with the ihatei.  That
leads me to believe (and again, I admit this isn\'t the strongest evidence)
that some ihatei are trained and equipped enough to defeat reserve or system
forces.  (OK, it\'s a little weak, but I\'m trying to make a point, and it\'s
all we\'re given to work with).

Can not, Hans!  ;-)  Seriously, as I said before, I don\'t have numbers, I\'m
afraid, so your point is extremely well made.  (Damn, I hate it when that
happens). ;-)

Agreed.  Though as I stated above, the Aslan may be able to coalesce enough
to gain minor victories (i.e., a world here, or there).  But, you\'re right,
not with the Vargr.

I misspoke.  They could, should, and would certainly win some significant
victories.  Just not all.  (See above).

Allow me to rephrase the point:  The Regency, and the Imperium, may be better
served by his failing to respond.  I think Norris knows enough to realize
that his contingent may not be enough to sway the tide of war one way or the
other.  I quote, "The past, no matter how vivid, no matter how preferable, is
not ours to grasp.  We must let it go.  The Empire will not save us...They
cannot save us, *nor can we save them.*...We are those who are left to carry
on whatever work the Empire began."  (Taken from MT Arrival Vengeance, p. 25
 Dated IE 110-1127).  I edited out commentary and speech-fluff.  These
comments lead me to believe that Norris sees the continuation of the Regency
as the continuation of the Imperium.  For it to fall, as so much of Imperial
space had fallen, is tantamount to the end of civilization, a new Long Night.
 I agree he was a man of tremendous integrity.  And that integrity forces me
to believe that he felt his responsibilty to the Imperium demanded he keep it
alive, albeit in just the few sectors he served.

I hold Norris in the highest regard.  He did what was right to save not only
"his" people, but many traditional adversaries, including the Zhodani, Sword
Worlds, and Aslan.  And as I stated above, he probably saved the Imperium,
albeit just a piece of the former.  That said, I stand by my earlier
statement of his "mercenary" action.  Tough times call for tough action, my
father always said, and I believe Norris took one of the toughest actions of
his life in suborning the Imperial Stationary, and elevating himself to
Archduke.  For ten years, he alone lived with the knowledge of what he had
done, and probably slept none to soundly for it.  In Survival Margin Norris
writes in his diary: "Too bad more famous liars don\'t agonize over it like I
do...I hope you forgive me Strephon.  It would mean much more coming from
you."  Those aren\'t the words of a man who seeks power.  I agree his goals
were altruistic.  It doesn\'t change the nature of his tactics, though.  In
fact, almost eleven years later he writes, "Thank God I had the sense to do
what I had to do when I had the chance to do it...And better me than
gawdawful Delphine."   Those two quotes speak volumes about the nature of his
character.  Altruistic, but realistic.  "Someone had to do it, dammit.
 Better me than the less capable."  Thank God he was also *right*, in
addition to his considerable character.  Don\'t forget, Dulinor was a man of
principle who did what he felt strongly was the right thing to do, too.

Bruce Johnson recently suggested that a discussion of why Foss\' art _is_

effect.  I, in turn, offered to provide a copy of Starships to the 
winner of that contest, if Bruce will be the one to judge it.  He agreed.

So, here\'s the deal: if you would like to participate, send an email to me 
(ransom@iconnect.net), with the subject line "Contest" and the body of 
the message consisting of the answer to the question:

"Why is the art on page 140 of the T4 rulebook an example of _hard 
science fiction art_?"

I will then take your email, and forward it to Bruce with the header 
stripped (so that he won\'t know who wrote each entry; I\'ll keep track of 
which is whose, though!:).  He\'ll then read them, and judge which is 
"best" - and that\'s understood to be a very subjective judgement, and 
only means which is "best" in Bruce\'s opinion.  Bruce will judge on use of
technical knowledge, as well as use of humor, and the overall entertainment 
value of each entry.

Entries must be in my mailbox by midnight GMT, December 31, 1996.  The 
winner will be announced on the TML during the first week of the new year.

A quick point that, believe it or not, I left out of my last post on this
subject regards my what-if scenario of Deneb seceding from the Imperium prior
to the Famed Three Bullets of Dulinor.  I\'m not sure Norris would actually do
such a thing, I\'m merely presenting it for discussion.  To my way of
thinking, it is simply more believable that an honest-to-God rebellion would
be started by a secessionist, than by an assassin.  (See civil wars, ad
infinitum).  Maybe Norris felt that the best thing for the Imperium, which I
agree he dearly loved, would be it\'s dissolution, so "democratic" reforms
could be more easily enacted.  What do you think?

Were you going to call it "Solaris VII" by any chance?? -:)

A long time ago, back when I was running my RC game, I designed an adventure set on 
Promise (notorious for the Viral junta that runs it), and included an encounter with 
Virus-controlled FASA-style "BattleMechs" designed with FF&S. I use explosive reactive 
armor to simulate the ablative armor on BattleMechs -- blow off the multiple layers of 
ERA and then punch through the lighter metal underneath. 

Lessee, I had mechs armed with medium lasers (not enough to hurt anyone in RC heavy 
battledress, which is anout right for med lasers versus FASA\'s Clans Elemental Armor), 
gauss rifles (100mm hypervelocity railguns . . . a PC that got hit anywhere vital with 
one of these was toast, armor or no), PPCs (CPAW, a hit from which would just about kill 
a man in heavy battledress), machineguns (go prang off heavy battledress), various 
autocannons and missiles, etc. I even set the rates of fire and targeting capabilities 
to be consistient with BT.

If there is a demand for this material, I\'ll post it to the list . . . else, I\'ll find 
it a home on the Trav Fan-Web(tm).

Ahhh yes, the "walking tanks suck" thread. 

I counter by saying: Trav is a science-fiction game. Technical barriers are assumed to 
be overcomable. You say they can\'t be overcome, I say that technology can and will 
overcome the barriers you raise. 

I\'m a gentleman, not a flamer, so can we agree to disagree?

We\'ll see how this contest turns out - if it goes well, I\'m not opposed 
to doing another one in January, if Bruce isn\'t (perhaps with a prize of 
a copy of Aliens or CSC).  We\'ll see...

Since there are no rules in Traveller for *any* sort of corridor/access
space, so what? Sure, this *is* a "cop out", but we\'re not *really*
pretending that Traveller Ship design is realistic, are we?

Anyway, I doubt that you\'d get carriers with 10k fighters - that\'s 100k
displacement tons of fighters alone! Since most CV designs in Traveller
don\'t have that many *anyway* it is a ridiculous objection. IIRC, the
biggest CVs in "Fighting Ships" (the Antiama Class Fleet Carriers) only
displace 100ktons themselves, and carry a mere 300 fighters. They also have
offensive armament that could (and should) be disposed of - a 100 ton Meson
Gun Bay, a 100 ton Particle Accellerator Bay, 5 x 50 ton Fusion Gun Bays,
60 x 50 ton Missile Bays, 160 triple beam laser turrets.

All it needs are the fighters and its *defensive* armament - 100 ton
Repulsor Bay, 160 triple Sandcaster Turrets, Nuclear Damper, Meson Screen -
*and* its Battle Group of escorts. Carriers do *not* operate alone.

I would guess that you could fit at least double the number of fighters in
with no loss of functionality.

Even if you did, the way you\'d do it is, of course, by dispersal. You\'d
have the fighters deployed on the hull in clusters, probably one per
Squadron or Wing, and the Pilots and Crew would have their quarters (or
ready rooms) situated close by for immediate access. Think of something
like the multi-plane access hubs at major airports, but for Fighters. I see
no problem, personally.

dissappointed.  I know it\'s Traveller, it\'s nostalgic, and we\'ve been giving
them lots of room to get their act together, but how much room is enough?

My previously posted fear regarding ship design limitations proved true.
 5000 tons, no more.  The ship design sequence is fabulous, but should have
been extended.  Waiting for a supplement is no excuse.  There would have been
plenty of room in THIS book if they\'d removed the superfluous "art" plates.
 These plates are all clotted into a section in the back without explanation,
and, as everyone has pointed out, have nothing to do with Traveller.  And I
am sure they added considerably to the (over)price on this book, which is a
$12.00 book at most.

The ship layouts are pathetic "Windows Paint" computer-generated sketches.  I
pulled out Supplement 7 to compare, and there was NO comparison: Traders &
Gunboats was phenomenal, Starships is juvenile.  One detail in particular
irks me more than others:  there are tiny areas on the ships labelled "fuel",
and there are also large "grey" areas that serve no apparent function.  Are
they fuel, too? Streamlining?

As much as I LOVE the T4 rules (simple, clean, rational), so far Imperium
Games\' production has just, to put it politely, REEKED.  The many volumes of
errata for MT and TNE told me something wasn\'t right at GDW; now I\'m starting
to think they should have just let it die gracefully.

I know, a game is what you make it, and a lot of us have been playing
Traveller for long enough to be able to make up for any errors on the part of
the company, but if they, as professionals, expect people (especially the
"next generation" of Traveller players that\'s been discussed as being their
focus) to PAY them to put out game material, they have GOT to get their act
together.  The products thus far have been unprofessional in a way that is no
longer accepted among game companies.  This isn\'t the 70\'s anymore: the
market is full of other GREAT sci-fi games.

I get the creeping feeling that IG is coasting on their reputation to produce
sales.  In my eyes they are rapidly losing credibility.  I ADORE Traveller!
 I want IG to excel!  However, their next releases better kick butt, or I
fear IG won\'t be bragging about "20 years" of anything.

I\'ll cast my bet for "Seven Flags over Sylea":

	Pre-Contact "United Nations" -type flag
	   (Assuming the Sylean race, like the Solomani, tended towards
	    balkanization in their early, pre-starflight history)
        Sylean multi-world government
	   (After jump drive acquired from Vilani traders)
	Vilani Ziru Sirka
	Solomani Rule of Man            (-2204 to -1776 or so)
	Independent world in Long Night (-1776 to - 650 or so)
	Sylean Federation                (-650 thru   0)
	Third Imperium                      (0 and on)

Last week had a reasonable turnout, we had a total of ten people show 
for the evening.  We\'d love to have more!   Our topic last week was 
"Game Handouts" and we came to the general concensus that nobody 
really gives anything out, but do generate deck-plans, maps and that 
sort of thing.  Many of the attendies remembered Supplement 12 fondly 
for its ID\'s and forms.

Here is a sample of part of the evening\'s conversation:

<SteveP> Y\'know...all the handouts I ever got in any game 
were durring cons while playing LARPG\'s.  Pretty neat 
stuff, though....albeit not Traveller related.

<JoeW> What type of stuff?

<SteveP> Various currency (drawn or typeset up...it\'s 
fake, of course), Mangled documents...cut glass used to 
simulate crystals or jems...

<JoeW> The cut glass idea is good.  Rhinestones would 
work, too.  

<SteveP> Yep.  And I think somewhere packed away is my 
"official Temporal Council of Earth" membership card.

<JoeW> Ah, right - I have used ID cards in my games.

<SuzD> I would think that various ID\'s would be fun.

<SteveP> I got to play Santa Claus...it was a hoot.

<SuzD> Think of all that kind of stuff we carry around now...
<SuzD> And imagine what kind of stuff they\'d have then.

<SteveP> IG should release another set of ID cards like 
GDW used to have in Supplement 12.

<JoeW> If the game was taking place within Solomani 
space,there is a perhaps interesting possiblity.  If 
it\'s happening at a supposed Ancient site, they could 
dig up some product currently available in th real 
world...or from earlier this century...
<SuzD> That would be fun.

<JoeW> ..might be a good opportunity for role-playing as 
th characters try to figure out the purpose of this 
"ancient" device.
<JoeW> Maybe ATari 2600 paddle controllers or something. 
[G]

<SteveP> Hmmm...CredCards that read your thumbprint...a-la 
MasterCard?

<JoeW> Steve: Yup.  I had those printed up on cardstock, 
cut \'em up, and used \'em.

<SteveP> Joe: Or Worse...run an RCES game where the 
players have to access some incompatable computer 
database...and hand them an 8" floppy disk!

<JoeW> LOL, Steve. :)

<shadowcat> oooohh...
<shadowcat> better idea 
<shadowcat> hand them a stack of punch cards

* SuzD grins

<SteveP> Ouch!  Much better!

<SteveP> Shadow> AND get them to translate them?

<shadowcat> my dad actually asked me to take a box full of 
puch cards to have read

<shadowcat> this was yesterday

<SteveP> Ick!  Wha\'d you do to irritate him so?

<JoeW> Steve: Yah, make them do conversion to octal, then 
to EBCDIC or something like that - by hand. ;)

<SuzD> I thought we were trying to make the game enjoyable for 
our players?
* SuzD looks confused *

<shadowcat> He had NFC that you couldnt find a reader for 
them

<JoeW> Suz: Oh, yeah. :)

<SuzD> Oh, we\'re in the "out to get them" mode.

<SteveP> Suz: our Evil Ref side is coming out.

<SuzD> Ok, I can play that game, too.
* SuzD grins


The conversation always wanders around the Traveller universe, and 
rarely stays on the topic of the week, so even if the topic announced 
doesn\'t interest you, come by anyway!

This week\'s topic is "Your Favorite Character", either one you played 
or one that played in one of your games.  Discuss what made the 
character so memorable. Was it their personality or something 
eventful he/she chose to do?  

I will be asking all attendees tonight what night next week would be 
best in light of the Holiday week.  Please feel free to email me a 
preference, as well.

I\'ll be on IRC by 6:00PM Mountain Standard Time.  The following time
zone equivalents apply:

             US Eastern :  9:00 PM 
             US Pacific :  6:00 PM 
             London     :  2:00 AM 
             Paris      :  3:00 AM

We have been trying to use the same server to help keep us from
getting lag.  We have had recentt luck with:

             Manhattan.KS.us.undernet.org
             ports numbered:6660-6669 

If at first you don\'t get through, try again.  If you can\'t get on
this server, try another one that you have with your program, but make
sure that it has the \'.undernet.org\' suffix or you may not be able to
find us. Finally, as a last resort, if you have any troubles, eMail
me. I will keep my email running and checking mail every 3 minutes.  I
will be happy to try to help you land at the correct jump coordinates.

You should try growing up with this guy as a big brother.. he ALWAYS is
thinking like this.

Hmmmm... Vland, Rule of Man, whatever they had before the SF, Sylean
Federation, Third Imperium.  Since sylea might have been balkinized at some
point in it\'s history, the possibility for multiple flags for the Long Night
must be considered.  (78 Flags, Shields, Rock Paintings, and Transponder
Codes Over Sylea!)

Now let\'s put these flags *high* over Sylea.. Orbital roller-coaster,
anyone?  AT TL14-15 You could probably build it so an atmosphere is
reatained along the track, allowing for thrilling open-car rides.

You expect people to make sense?  In 1939, Hitler made outrageous demands of
the Polish government to widen the East Prussian corrider to Danzig.  The
Poles, mindful of what had happened to the Austrians and Czechs, not only
agreed, but gave Hitler more than he wanted.  Hitler broke of talks, fuming
to the press that the Poles were being unreasonable.

You expect a Hitler to accept the results of one-on-one combat to decide the
fates of worlds?

Human history is filled with vendettas and wars that spiralled far beyond
their modest beginnings.  (A prize to those whose can explain to me how the
assassination of an Austrian Arhduke by a Serbian led France and Germany to
four years of bitter warfare.)

I think that if this contest were to take place, the losing leader would
calmly open his comm, state "begin plan \'B\'" and then gun down his oppenents.

=46irst off, let me say that there is nothing inherently wrong with nor
missing from the T4 Psionics rules. However, there are both several
"traditional" special disciplines, and some extensions to the standard
five, as well as some new (read: optional) rules for dealing with psionics.

*Disciplines* and Powers
The following new powers and disciplines should be rolled for just like the
base five, but some of these may either have pre-requisites of other
disciplines, or be augmented by other disciplines, or may be part of other
disciplines, or diallowed entirely, all at the ref\'s option. Note that
expansions to some of the existing disciplines are listed under headings of
that discipline.

*Telepathy*
Telepaths have so many abililities that I thought these abilities should be
in a separate discipline; GM\'s may, at their discretion, merge them into
one or re-arrange them.

One other note: a telepath should be able to converse freely (as long as
they want) with another telepath at no cost to a range of 3 meters; It may
be adviseable to let them converse with anyone who is willing by this
method, to.

*Advanced Telepathy*
=46eeder: This ability allows one Psionic to feed Psi-Points to another
Psionic. The other cannot go above his normal maximum.
Range: Contact ,+ 1 band per +1 point.
Target gains: 1 per point.
Duration: until used.

Mental Illusion:This power allows the telepath to plant visions into the
target\'s mind. ONLY the target will see them. If the target is not
conscious, they will be nothing more than a dream. This power may be
actively resisted by the target, if the target has a reason to believe that
the images he\'s seeing are not real. To do so, the target rolls versus the
higher of Int or End, and rolls with a number of dice dependant upon the
nature of the illusion. A Firebreathing dragon while the character is in
the bathroom would be easy; the same dragon in the woods would be average
or difficcult (depending upon local fauna and the target\'s knowledge of
it). Resisting against a gunshot in the middle of a firefight while
charging would be impossible.

Also, the target will react as though the illusory world is real, but
willactually act out the fantasy. To change the illusion while it is going,
the telepath must roll 2d6+(Telepathy Level) -(number of active changes).
Normal changes due to the target\'s actions do not count. Ths power can also
be used to present the real world, as it is, with only minor differences,
with little or no effort.
Range: Touch, + 1 range band per point.
Duration: 1 minute, x2 per point.

Invisibility: This power allows the telepath to become invisible to direct
observation by sapient or near sapient beings. Most animals with
centralized nervous systems will also be affected, but will become edgy.
The character will not be percieved by anyone within range by any means
(direct or indirect), but no equipment will be affected whatsoever. So,
afterwords, the guard\'s security taes will show the telepath, even though
the guard will swear he didn\'t see the telepath at all.
Range: Close plus 1 per range band
Duration: Minimal concentration.
Effect: non-Psi\'s, +1 level of shield per +1 point

Shield Other: This ability allows a Psionic to shield other persons than
himself; unlike his or her personal shield, this is not automatic nor free
(except at low ranges and durations). The target loses the shield if he
gets too far from the Psi during the duration.
Range: Contact, +1 band per point
Duration: 5  minutes, x6 per point
Targets: 1, +1 per point

Borrow Senses: This ability allows one to telepathically "Ride Along" and
utilize someone else\'s senses. The Telepath has no direct control over the
person whose senses he\'s borrowing. Excellent for teleporters, as they have
"Directly Percieved" the area.
Range: Contact, +1 band per point.
Duration 1 minute per point.

=46licking: Flicking is the ability to utilize psionically sensitive
switches. To use such a switch, one must know (or have reason to assume
correctly) the location of the switch. This power is most common amongst
the Zhodani, for whom it is simply an aspect of normal telepathy OR
telekinesis. Such switches are usually of the on/off type, but may also be
3 position, or even "Keypads" or "Keyboards" composed of multiple switches.
Range: Contact, +2 range bands per point.
Duration: instant, +1 minute per point.

*Domination*
This discipline is a relative of telepathy, but focuses upon forcing ones
will upon another. While some can do both, many can only do one or the
other, despite the fact that both use the same basic neural pathways. The
same task rules apply to dominate as for telepathy: Roll 2d6+(Dominate
Level)-(Target\'s Telepathy Level) for Int or less. Also, unless the Psionic
is a telepath, many of the powers will require the user to speak to the
victim in a language the target knows. Unless noted otherwise, the dominate
powers require communication. Those who posses this discipline are often
(sometimes for other reasons) called Dominatrixes.

Stun: This ability allows one to momentarily stun or frighten the
target(s). The target will be unable to act for a certain (very short)
period of time. This power may be used upon more than one target. This
power does not require communication.
Range: Contact, +1 band per point.
Duration: 5 seconds, +5 seconds per point
Targets: 1 point for 1 target, x2 per point

Command: This power lets the character give a simple (one sentence, must be
short) command to the target. If the command would bring physical harm to
the target, the ref may allow a resistance roll versus (Target\'s
Int)+(Target\'s Telepathy or Dominate)-(Dominatrix\'s Dominate), and at a
difficulty based upon how innocuous the action seems; ie. the less obvious
the harm, the harder the task. Also, the target will not contiune the task
after the duration expires. The target must succeed at a formidable task
against intelligence to recall doing the command, unless the Dominatrix
lets him, in which case the target recalls the whole thing, including the
Dominatrix\'s telling him what to do (unless telepathy was used to give the
actual command).
Range: 1 pt for contact, +1 band per point.
Duration: 1 minute, x10 per point.
Add send thoughts: +1 point (if a telepath)

Subjugation: This power completely subjugates the target\'s will; he will do
whatever he is told. He will not even hesitate to do things directly
putting him at risk. He will, however, recall the entire action (although
not know why he did it). The target may be given command after command, and
there is no range limit upon completion of the task.
Range: 3 points for contact, +1 band per point
Duration: Concentration, +5 minutes per point
Add send thoughts: +1 point (if a telepath).

Compulsion: This power is used to plant a deep seated compulsion (one
sentence in length) into the tartget\'s psyche. Compulsions implanted with
this power are treatable by a good Psychologist; who must roll a
psychology + Int task to eradicate it, usually taking several weeks of
therapy. The more obvious the compulsion, the more likely someone will
notice. May be resisted, as well, an impossible task of int, unless the
task is directly and obvously hazardous, in which case it would merely be
staggering. In cases where the compulsion is obviously lethal, the
resistance roll is Formidable. Compulsions may be beneficial, too; the
Zhodani use them in severe criminal insanity cases to prevent the abberant
behaviours so that the underlying psychological problems may be cured.
Range: 3 points for touch. +1 range band per +2 points
Duration: Permanent
Difficulty to cure: Easy, + 1 difficulty level per +1 point.

Exhaustion: The target will suddenly become mentally and physically
exhaused. This is enhanced by the target\'s brain releasing sleep hormones
and excercise by-products, as well as reducing respiration and heart rate,
and setting opposed muscle groups off at the same time. This power does not
require communication. The "Damage" is an addition to the target\'s
endurance pool, and lasts until the target has rested enough to recover
from the endurance pool.
Range: Contact, +1 point per range band.
Duration: Instant/Until rested.
Damage: 1d6 per point.

*Teleport*
Teleport, as shown in the T4 rulebook, is a one-trick discipline... but it
need not be so. Here are a few new abilities to go with it

Exoteleport: The ability to send items elsewhere. Especially usefull with
grenades, buckets of paint, clips of ammo. Note tat the power has two
ranges: one from Teleporter to object, one from teleporter to destination.
Both must be paid for separately (it is easier to send a held something 25
meters than to move an object 20 meters away a mere 5 meters from its
starting point). As with teleport, the teleporter must have a good
visualization of the destination, and of the target. Just like normal
self-teleportation, the attempt will fail if there is matter in the target
point. Also, the whole object must be teleported as a whole; you cannot
exoteleport parts of an object or being.
Range to item: Touch, +1 range band per point.
Range to destination: Contact, +1 band per point.
Mass: 1kg, x5 per point

Blink: This power allows one to "Dodge" bullets, blades, fists, etcetera.
This is an active, semi-instinctual, and expensive defense. Blinking moves
you one to one and one-half  meters in the direction of your choice
(provided nothing is at the target point). You can turn this power on and
off at no cost; you cannot override a blink when it is on, and you cannot
bring it up in time to avoid an attack that has already been rolled. You
must also have been aware of the attack for the blink to occur, best
handled as a task: Int +Perception +Teleport with the same difficulty as
the attacker had for hitting you. Note that blink is generally ineffectual
against autofire when in the open.
Range: 1 point for 1 meter.
Duration: Instant.
Mass: self and items carried only. No other beings or life-forms.

=46licker: This power involves teleporting inches at a time, continuously. I=
t
is very draining, and causes as much to be added to the endurance pool as
is taken from the Psi Points for using it. It causes the Teleporter to
"flicker" through teleportations, making him harder to hit.
Range: Self
Mass 100kg per 1 point
Attacker Penalty: DM-1, additional -1 per +1 point.

*Telekinesis*
This Discipline is relatively complete, although some would say that the
Thermokinesis should be part of it. (One previous edition of traveller did
so.) I will present Thermokinesis as a separate discipline.

*Thermokinesis* (AKA Adv. Telekinesis)
The ability to heat and cool matter through force of mind. There are only
two powers, and they are both (intentionally) fairly "low powered" at first
glance. Keep in mind, though, that a 5=B0 C change in body temperature can b=
e
fatal, and that objects should (for play ballance reasons) be heated or
cooled as a whole... it\'s fine to heat the door \'til it melts, or the knob
and lock, but not the tumblers, nor 1g of the petrol at the fuel dump.
Effect is in Degrees C per second.
Also, the two powers are so closely related as to need only one set of stats=
:
Pyrokinesis and Cryokinesis
Range: Contact, +1 band per point
Duration: 5 sec, x6 per point
Mass: 1kg, x10 per point.
Effect: 1 point per 1=B0/sec.

*Clairavoyance*
This discipline is again, fairly complete. However, a few more oddball
clairavoyant techniques might find some use. The new abilities are all
temporal in nature; mucking about with viewing the past can make a Ref\'s
life hard. Some ref\'s might want to split these off into Temporal
Perception as a Discipline of its own.

When using Clairavoyance, Clairaudience, Clairaolfactilism, or
Clairatactilism, the character can move his sensual focus anywhere within
his range; anything within range will be visible; anything beyond will be
grey fog. When using them in combination, they all shift focus together.
The movement can be as fast or slow as the user desires. These powers
should be blocked by artificial psionic shields. An individual in a shield
should have his face described as an orb of grey fog.

Psychometry: The ability to read psychic impressions off of a device,
primarily the unique signature of someone who has handled it previously.
Effect is a measure of time back that the clairavoyant can check. This
power cannot give a view of the circumstances, but only the user and how he
was handling the item.
Effect: 1 day for one point, x7 per point thereafter.
Range: Touch, +1 range band per point thereafter.
Viewing: one sense, +1 sense per point

Postcognition: the ability to see the past. Range is a measure of how large
an area the clairavoyant will percieve; said effect is always centered upon
his location at the start of the viewing. Effect is, once again, the amount
of time into the past he can look. Normally, the clairavoyant will be using
sight, although other forms of perception are allowed. Duration is how long
he can look around.
Effect: 1 day for 1 point, x7 per +1 point.
Range: Close, +1 range band per point.
Duration: 1min, x10 per point thereafter.
Senses: one sense, +1 sense per point.

Clairaolfactilism: The ability to Smell and Taste at range. This ability is
of rather limited use on its own, but is able to be added to clairaudience
or clairavoyance for +1 point. The effect is that the clairavoyant\'s senses
of smell and taste become located at the focus of his power; he can sniff
at anything in range.
Range: Contact, +1 range per 1 pt
Duration: 1 minute, +1 minute per 1pt
Effect: Clairavoyance, Clairaudience, clairatactilism may be added for 1
point each.

Clairatactilism: The ability to feel at range. Just as sensitive as the
character\'s chosen Range: Contact, +1 range per 1 pt
Duration: 1 minute, +1 minute per 1pt
tactile appendage.
Effect: Clairavoyance, Clairaudience, clairasentience may be added for 1
point each.

Precognition: The ability to see into the future. Thiswould be great, were
it not for the axiom "If you don\'t want the players to ruin the plot, don\'t
let them roll the dice". Rather than letting the player aim this one, the
Ref should instead let the playerse part of the event, but not its
resolution. For example: let the player see the back of Dulinor\'s head
before he assasinates strephon, with Dulinor raising his gun, but from such
an angle as not to see who he\'s aiming at, and the vision should fade
before Dulinor fires. Also, don\'t let them ask specific questions; rather,
let this power be a plot hook generator, that the players invoke. There is
no range limit, per s=E9, but rather a time limit. Due to the lack of rolls
under T4 rules, this power can easily be a problem if not handled
carefully. Also, the events might require task rolls to be understood; 4d6
vs Int + Clairavoyance Discipline is a basic guideline for anything the
player wants explained. Players should be free to leap to conclusions of
their own, without resort to system mechanics.
Number of Events: 1 event per 1 point.
Time Range: 1 month, x5 per point

*Computer Empathy*
This discipline, I have found, can be one of the most unballancing psionic
abilities in a game unless held carefully in check by the ref and the
player. You have been warned. This discipline is the ability to access,
control, and program computers via a warped, machine-specific, form of
telepathy. This discipline is not meant to be a catch-all machine controll;
it should be a tool for the hacker of the party. It can be even more fun to
put the least computer-friendly of the party with computer empathy, and let
him learn to be a hacker.

Terminal: The Psionic can acess the computer as though he was at a
terminal. He has no more access than any other terminal connected to the
machine, nor are his actions any less traceable by the security software.
It is just that he need not be near any actual terminal, and his actual
location might baffle guards for quite a while. If he does anything he\'s
not allowed to, he will set off security protocols, just as though he were
at a terminal.
Range: Contact, +2 range bands per 1 pt.
Sophistication: 1point per 2 Computation Ratings (CR; see T4, pp. 64 and
78)  of the computer.
Note: 1 point could also get +1 Range Band and +1 Computation Rating.

Back Door: This allows the user full access, as though he were logged in as
the system adminisitrator (superuser status). His actions are not traceable
nor logged, but he can still only do what the system is designed for and he
is skilled enough to do with full access at a terminal anyway. So if he
can\'t program, he can\'t write new programs. If he doesn\'t know how the
system\'s password file is set up he can\'t make any new accounts. But he can
still look around. He can run programs. He can muck up the system. He
effectively has all the passwords (although he will NOT remember them
afterwords, since the real process is bypassing them all, but he might be
able to set up a new account for himself with superuser priveledges...),
and cannot be traced.
Range: Contact, +1 range band per 1 point.
Sophistication: 1 point per 1 CR.

Thought into Code: The psionic can actually put programs into the computer
with mere thought. Such programs are not commercially viable, however, as
they are totally machine specific, and utilize actual code from the
existing software. They cannot be run on any machine other than the one
they were put into. The character must have the needed skills, as well
(except computer). Said programs function just like any other program, so
long as no other programs on the machine are removed, moved, or upgraded,
and so long as no hardware is added or removed. This power can also be used
to create data files; Data files created this way ARE portable.
Range: 1 for contact, 1 point per range band.
Sophistication: 1 point per CR.
Program Size: 1 per size point of the program.

Zap CPU: The psionic can actually cause damage to a computer, as a telepath
would a mind. The damage may be chosen as either permanent or temporary.
When the damage rating of the computer is exceeded by permanent damage, the
CPU and memory storage systems are all melted, blanked, or otherwise
permanently destroyed. Temporary damage, or some combination of temporary
and permanent, that exceeds the damage rating results in shutdown until a
techie resets the machine and reloads the software.
Range: contact, +1 band per 1 point
Damage: 1d6 per 1 point, on the personal combat scale.
Duration: until repaired if permanent.
        until reset/rebooted if temporary.

Read Storage Devices and Peripherals: the ability to read data going to or
from a given peripheral or memory device (Printers, drives, sound cards,
jump drive interface, holo-crystals). This power is the most problematic;
it should be carefully watched, if allowed at all.
Range: 1 point for touch, +1 range band per point thereafter.
Duration: 1 minute. +1 minute per 1 point.
Speed: same as reading.

Handling Psionics: Rules Options

With the addition of new disciplines and powers comes a need to re-evaluate
some of the methods of character aquisition of psionics. Since some of
these also involve adding to the existing disciplines, the task is more
complex.

Rolling for Psionic Disciplines
When looking at the gaining of psionic disciplines, one must consider how
many disciplines the ref wants. The standard, -2 per roll, is enough to
limit average characters to one or two, and the brightest will have 3 to 5;
few will have more disciplines than that. Switching this modifier to -1 per
roll will tend to give every psionic at least 1 discipline (assuming Int
7+), and many will have two or three; some will actually have 6 or 7
disciplines!

Going the other direction, to a -3 per roll means that most will haveno
abilities, and no human can have more than 3, as a roll at -16 to Int is at
best a target of -1.

Wild Talents
Another Option is for the Ref to check for "Wild Talent". Wild talents are
individuals who posses the ability to use a particular discipline without
formal training. I reccomend 4d6 versus the lower of the character\'s Int or
age 18 Psi. Wild talents should have a 1d6 skill in 1d3 POWERS, all from a
single discipline. These powers are used normally, but the player only
knows what the powers are, and nothing else. Wild Psi\'s do not lose their
power-specific skills when trained. They learn the disciplines normally,
and until the discipline is to the power\'s skill, uses either. As they are
eclipsed, they may be dropped. Additionally, Wild Talents continue to lose
points off the Psi attribute until trained. (In a lot of the  literature,
Wild Talent Psionics tend to fade in power with age.) Wild talents may not
raise their "wild" skills.

Power Specific Skills
This option allows Ref\'s to require separate skills in each psionic power,
rether than the broader disciplines.

Doing so is simple; the character graduates with all the powers he can use
at level 1. Using Telepathy against a shielded target requires rolling your
skill in the offensive power, and deducts the target\'s skill in shield.
(Shield gets a check any time it blocks a telepath.)

This proceedure has the additional advantage of slowing down psionicists
development rapidly.

Limited numbers of powers per discipline
as an option, require players to roll for each power within the disciplines
they have. Either they can do it or they can\'t. The proceedure is simple:
roll 2d6 for each power for Int - number of powers in that discipline
attained. Each discipline resets the target numbers. A 12 roll means stop
rolling for that discipline.

Learning New powers requires some rationale. It also usually requires a
teacher. Basically, the proceedure is basically about a week or two of
training, followed by rolling as above. Said roll is at the same modifier
as you left off at. Because of the nature of the modifiers, you will never
have more powers in a discipline than Int -1 (roll a 1 on 2d6 buddy... I
dare you... and no cocked dice or telekinnesis, either!)

This option works even better when combined with the Power-Specific Skills
Option.

Going Too Far
When a psionicist pushes his ratings, under the T4 rules he permanently
loses one point of his Psi rating if he fails the Int roll. Several other
options are presented here.

Losing the Use of Powers
When the player fails the Int check, he loses the use of the power, for as
many weeks as he failed the roll by. On a crit fail, he loses it
permanently.

Losing Psi Temporarily
The psionicist still  loses the psi, but only for as many months as he
failed the roll by. Again, a critical failure is a permanent loss.

Gaining Insanity Points
The psionicist has a blow-out causing hallucinations, bad dreams, or other
psychological problems... gain one insanity point per point you failed by.
(See the Insanity Rules, below.)

Losing Disciplines
Rather than the loss of  Psi point, the character loses a discipline, and
all of its powers. This can be either temporary (1 month per point failed
by is reccomended) or permanent.

Combinations
Randomly or logically choose which of the options best fits the current
plot lines and needs of the game each time a psi pushes his limits. Tell
him the effects AFTER he has failed his Int check... and watch him squirm.
Losing disciplines, or a whole point of psi permanently can be very
draconian, and make for hard choices, especially if the players know in
advance that those outcomes are possible. If using a random table, each ref
should set it up for the feel and style of his campaign.

Pushing too Hard, part II
Players will often feel contstrained by the costs of powers, in terms of
psi-points. This is both good, and needed for play ballance. There are
times, however, where a few extra points would be really usefull for the
plot.

Burning Psi
I allow players to permanently burn one point of Psi to refresh their whole
pool of Psi-Points; this is not a safe thing to do.  In addition to the
permanently lowered Psi,  they take 1d6 damage to each attribute except Soc
and Psi. Such damage is healed normally. No rolls needed. The damage alone
is enough to keep the use of this down.

Burning Endurance
Allowing PC\'s to burn past their Psi can be useful; Spending endurance on a
1 for 1 when all Psi points are gone is fairly useful. This tends to be
abused by power-mongers, so I make them roll 2.5d6 against endurance (now
lowered by the expenditures) to avoid blacking out. If this is abused,
change it to one point of Psi costs 1 point of damage each from Str, Dex
and End.

Insanity and Losing It
Traveller is about heroes and adventure... but the most memorable
characters are those who have overcome some major flaws. Also, Psionics and
Horror tend to go hand in hand, so derangements resultant from these can
become major factors in a psionically oriented or horror oriented campaign.

Insanity Points
Each time a character is subjected to mind bending stress (ie: Ref\'s call),
he or she rolls versus the lower of Int or End, at a difficulty set by the
Ref. If he makes it, no problem. If he fails, he gains 1d3 insanity points.
He might gain more if the experience is particularly hideous or personal.
Being in Jump for more than 8 days is usually grounds for a difficult roll
or gain 1 insanity point; roll daily from day 9 on  to represent the
growing fear and claustrophobia that is exacerbated by the certanty of a
misjump. Being dead is usually no problem, but the resuscitation is usually
good for an automatic d3 insanity points. Watching your family tortured to
death is usually grounds for an imossible roll or gain 1.5d6 to 2d6
insainity points. You lose one insanity point per month during which you
gained none.

These points add up; any time the character gains more, the ref should roll
3d6 for the number of insanity points or less; on a crit failure, lose 1d6
insanity points, as your mind  leans new ways of coping. On a success, you
lose your sanity, 1.5d6 insanity points, and should gain a minor to
moderate insanity. On a roll of a 3, you go completely berserk or gain some
other major insanity, and must hand over your character during his bouts.

Also note that all insanities gained this way are curable without recourse
to chemotherapy (Drugs); they are products of an overstressed mind, not a
brain that doesn\'t produce the right chemicals in the right ammounts.

Sample Minor Insanities
1       Delusional (sky is the wrong color, etc)
2       Paranoid (they\'re out to get you)
3       absent minded
4       Bloodthirsty
5       Obscession &/or Compulsion
6       Phobia (Irrational fears)

Sample Major Delusions
1       Schitzophenic (The whole world becomes one big delusion/hallucinatio=
n)
2       Multiple Personality Disorder
3       Homocidal or megalomaniacle
4       Catatonic
5       Regressed (Acts like a  child of 2.5d6-3 years old)
6       Suicidal or deathwish

Note that Schitzophrenia has nothing to do with Multiple personality.
Schitzophrenics live in their own little world of their own creation,
denying reality, or at least "adjusting" it to make it fit there warped
world view.
Catatonia is fits of total incapacitation; a catatonic person will have
periods where they will do absolutely nothing; if they are phobic, exposure
to the phobic trigger will make them totally useless, otherwise, they
should be semi-random.
Homicidal means seeking to kill, and megalomaniacs believe they are the
center of the universe, and generally become violent when not treated as
such.

Curing Disorders
Each disorder will require 2d6 months of intensive psychological theraphy
to cure, followed by a task roll by the psychologist. The difficulty is
generally difficult for minor disorders, and staggering for major ones; if
the first try fails, anonther may be made after another 1d6 months.
Critical failures result in causing 2d6 more insanity points for major
disorder treatment and 1d6 for minor disorders. Major disorders are
actually not cured, but reduced to a minor level, which may then be treated
separately. Outpatient therapy increases the difficulty by one level, and
triples the time required.

Outpatient therapy generally costs around Cr1000 per month, and takes 4-6
hours a week, with no session less than one hour. Missing any session time
at all in a week means the whole week doesn\'t count; if more than 2 weeks
are missed in a row, the whole process must start over.

Resident therapy generally costs from Cr4000 to Cr10,000 per month. missing
more than a day means the week doesn\'t count, and missing more than one
week in a row causes the time to be reset.

Psionic therapy, with a good telepath, cuts the required time to 4d6 days
for the first roll, and 2d6 days per additional attempt. Psionic Therapy is
rare (except in Zhodani Space), and often not available commercially. It
requires intense in-patient type treatment. Psionic Therapists with the
Probe and Compulsion disciplines can crack even the toughest nut, and can
halve the time taken for Psionic Therapy. Psionic Therapists can only
handle one patient at a time.

Chemotherapy can be added by any therapist with Medical 3 or more; It
raises the difficulty by one level, but allows adding Medical skill to the
Psychology total.

Low Tech Level Effects: Below Tech 8, double all times taken. Below Tech 5,
double them again.

The problem I see is that you seem to suggest that there is a humanly
way to figth wars.  War is hell (W.T. Sherman).  It is, sadly, one of
the things we humans are best at and, ultimately, the one thing that
distinguishes us (higher primates which includes some other primates)
from other animals (ants do not wage war in the sense of organized
violence).

The suggestion of champions would mean that a society would accept to
submit to a judgement of champions.  This is unthinkable in a democracy
and even more in a dictatorship based on violence.  A leader that would
have failed would simply be killed by his own side.

The closest thing to the type of world that you are describing in earth
history would be \'la guerre en dentelles\' (the period that includes
Frederick the Great and Louis XIV) where professional armies of soldiers
would go out of their way to battle one another and would limit the
devastation.

This went away with total war under Napoleon.  An entire country got
drafted into the war effort, making it total.  We cannot go back to the
time of champions.

A democratic leader that would submit to a judgement of champions would
be taken out of office and the democracy would simply ignore the
decision and (if they decide to do so) fight.  A dictator would simply
be taken out and replaced by another one.

My ranting for tonight.  What a great subject to actually pass on my
frustration on my keyboard...

	Well sure, they could do that, but I thought we were trying to come up

	However, there are all kinds of historical counter-examples. Well, not of 
playing Yahtzee to decide conflicts, but all through feudal Europe and Asia 
(and probably elsewhere), there were long, complicated rules and procedures 
involved in fighting a war due to principles of honour, the church, etc.

	While one side could theoretically break the rules and, say, launch a 
sneak attack on a Sunday, they never did. It all has to do with the culture 
a person lives in.
>I think that if this contest were to take place, the losing leader would
>calmly open his comm, state "begin plan \'B\'" and then gun down his

	Only if Plan B was commonly done in that culture, or there was no serious 
taboo against Plan B.

	In modern day earth, the UN (or anyone else) couldn\'t sit down and decide 
to solve all conflicts by advanced computer simulations (to throw in a 
random Trek reference). We all know how easy it is to wage a war. But if it 
naturally arose in a culture that the only way to wage war was in a giant 
suit of armour, and it slowly evolved into giant mechs, no one would ever 
really imagine anything else.

Overall, I rate it very good.  It\'s well laid out, the artwork is, as
usual, excellent (although I\'m beginning to wonder about Foss\'s penchant
for putting giant crane-like thingies on his vehicles-what the hell /is/
that on the vehicle on the front cover?), and the design system is not only
good but /complete/ and logically organized.
  The deckplans and ship data are both useful; though the deckplans may be
a bit sketchy for some people.  They\'re good as a starting point, though; I
think that was the idea.  Kind of like the blank areas in the subsector map
in the rulebook.  They should have gone with a white background for the
plans, though.  There\'s defintely too much black.
  The color plates should have been placed between the plans and the design
rules.  Having to flip across 6 pages of basically nothing to get between
one part of the rules to the rest is kind of annoying (and I don\'t mean to
imply that the art isn\'t necessary or good; just that its placement hurts
the readability of the SSDS).  As usual, Foss\'s art is bizarre.  Some of it
isn\'t "Travelleresque".  But that\'s not the point of it; the point is to
"fire the imagination", to create a sense of wonder.  And it definitely
does that.
  I\'m glad they decided to go with SSDS, but I wish IG would synchronize
the two systems.  The most glaring inconsistency I\'ve found between QSDS
and SSDS is in the HEPlaR drives.  I know a lot of players and GM\'s don\'t
bother with HEPlaR, but I believe in using all the resources that are made
available.  Here\'s an example of what\'s wrong with the systems:

Example:  Standard Maneuver Drive for the Scout/Courier (2G, 100dT Ship)
Values for QSDS HEPlaR Drive (Rulebook Values)
2G/100dTons
Volume:  1 (14kl)
Cost:  MCr0.0
Power:  10MW
Area:  1
20 hours\' Fuel:  7.2dT (100.8kl)
Crew:  0.0

Values for SSDS HEPlaR Drive
2G/100dTons
Thrust: 2,000 tonnes
Mass: 10 tonnes
Volume:  10kl
Power:  100MW
Area:  10
20 hours\' Fuel:  35.7dT (500kl)
Crew(Mx):  0.1	

And to make matters worse...
QSDS Values for HEPlaR Drive (from the pre-print version)
2G/100dTons
Volume:  1 (14kl)
Cost:  MCr0.0
Power:  140MW (!)
Area:  1
20 hours\' Fuel:  7.2dT (100.8kl)
Crew:  0.0

  Also, in the T4 basic rulebook, it states that Thruster Plate drives
become available at TL12.  However, on the SSDS charts, we have them
appearing at TL11, one level /before/ High Efficiency Contragrav.  This is
minor, however, and on page 71, they\'re described as being TL12.  So it\'s
not /really/ a problem.
  Still, I\'d like to see something done about the differences between SSDS
and QSDS.  Actually I\'d like to see the QSDS HEPlaR drives redesigned
according to SSDS.  Since SSDS is the more detailed system, it\'ll be the
one I use from now on, especially for lower-tech ships.
  All in all, I feel Starships is a good buy.  It\'s well organized,
attractive, the design system is logically organized, and appears to be
well proofed.  I\'d recommend it.

        "For when it absolutely has to get there, *fast*".  The FSY
Moufette Rapide-class Far Courier, capable of acceleration matching that of
the standard Imperial Patrol Cruiser and double that of the Mercenary
Cruiser, is designed to meet the courier needs of a young and expanding
Imperium.  With enough fuel for 1 3-parsec and 1 2-parsec jumps required
before refuelling, it is capable of doing the 5-parsec Sylea-Eneri or
Sylea-Abbanol runs in approximately 14 days(!), and with its fuel scoops
and compact TL-12 purification plant, is capable of of a complete
wilderness refuelling in approximately 12 hours.  Power is supplied by a
TL-12 Zhunastu Fusion Systems 500-Mw fusion plant which provides sufficient
excess capacity to emergency overload the Thruster Plates by 100% while
operating the laser at maximum ROF).  It is built into a 200 displacement
ton crystaliron streamlined wedge hull.

        "For when it has to get there, *period*".  The FSY Moufette-Rapide
class Far Courier is also heavily armoured, and packs a nasty punch with a
TL-12 Ling Standard 251-Mj laser in a caudal mount (a small rearward-facing
spinal mount).  Being a courier, not a fighting ship, standard doctrine
dictates that a Moufette-Rapide, when confronted with a threat, should
literally turn tail, presenting the smallest possible surface area, and
accelerate away... and if the threat is foolish enough to give chase, open
fire to convince it of its folly.

        The high acceleration of which the Moufette-Rapide is capable
dictate a vertical deck layout and concomitant vertical landing
orientation.  The upper sections of the ship are connected by a single
spiral staircase.  Accomodations are tailored to its mission: the engineer
and gunner/steward bunk (literally) in the engineering spaces when carrying
passengers, and the captain/pilot and navigator bunk forward in small
staterooms immediately aft/below of the cockpit. Immediately aft/below
their staterooms are the two small passenger staterooms (convertible into a
single large stateroom for a small additional cost.  When not carrying
passengers, the engineer and gunner may bunk here).  A moderately spacious
lounge/dining area (approximately 50 m^3) occupies the next deck down.

        Fuel tankage takes up much of the remaining space, traversed by a
lift shaft running from the lounge down to engineering.  The cargo hold is
right aft, served by two large cargo bay doors that drop down to double as
loading ramps.  The thruster plates are of course mounted below the hold.

        With a price tag of 145 Mcr which reflects its equally high
performance, the Moufette-Rapide is not designed for free-trader
operations.  Rather, it is aimed at a higher market niche; at governments,
corporations, and militaries that require a fast courier vessel capable of
putting up a strong defence.

I don\'t know about other states, but the "Six Flags Over Texas" park
refers to the (duh) six flags that have flown over Texas as, respectively,
a part of French territory, Spanish land, the country of Mexico, the
independent Republic of Texas, a state of the Confederacy, and a member
of the United States of America.

Not to pick on you specifically Brian, but to everybody whining about the 
5000 ton limit for SSDS, when did you subscribe to TML, last week?  
If not, then you, I and everybody else should have known since June 
that this was the limit to which SSDS was going up to.  Except for 
new subscribers, this should have come as no great surprise.  The 
system was fan designed, after all.

mentioned in the Terran history write-up that\'s part of the Solomani Rim New
Era history....

   Well what the *&%(*....

   Basically, combat walkers emerge on Terra as a result of two factors.
 First, the lack of proper gravitic manufacturing facilities.  This shortage
was due to the fact that prior to the Collapse, Terra imported practically
all of its gravitic generators from offworld (usually Agidda or Ember), and
what facilities that were present were for the most part were in ruins.
 Second, technological advances are made in walker design that make them the
overall equal of tracked and wheeled vehicles.  These advances, related to
the field of Cybernetics, would have been made previously within the Imperium
or the Solomani Confederation, but did not occur because of the advent of
gravitic technology.

   Terran combat walkers do not look like giant samurai, or a giant cow.
 Most have multiple legs and resemble spiders, though some of the smaller
ones, used for infantry support and scouting, have only two legs.  After
about 1160, all Terran combat walkers were manufactured with gravitic
generators and short duration heplar thrusters.  Most previously manufactured
models have been retrofitted with these devices over the years.  Combat
walker manufacturing ceased some 10 years ago, and their number are slowly
being replaced in military units by more traditional gravitic designs.  The
Terran Army still maintains large numbers of them, however, and the smaller
versions can be found in Terran Republic Marine infantry units where they are
predominately used as weapons platforms.  Surplus combat walkers have found
their way into mercenary units based in the Republic, and some combat walkers
have even been converted for the tourist trade and for the luxury off-road
vehicle market.

I give out a bunch of things as handouts and props in my games.  It 
makes them more real, and the players like this.  I think I picked 
this up after GMing the James Bond rpg.  They gave you a lot of 
handouts in that one.

Just recently, I\'ve copied the wallet contents of Roet Bannerji\'s 
wallet, put in some ID cards from supp 12, and gave this to the 
players when they found the wallet (in the Traveller Adventure).  

I\'ve also been known to copy pictures, write documents, and do all 
sorts of things to have a physical hand out for my players.  The 
backstory posts in the Grand Adventure were written and mailed to the 
respective player.  I\'ve got a lot of written material that is sent 
out on a periodic basis, like Traveller News Service items.

Each time the characters reach a new starport, I mail out TNS items 
between game sessions.  This simulates their catching up on the news 
while the ship is insystem.

My players come home from work, check the mailbox, and have something 
to think about until the next session.

From you comments, I\'m one of the few GMs who actively uses handouts, 
but I encourage all GMs to use them more often.  You will be 
surprised what a cool prop can do for a game.

Actually, six, given the history we know.  Of course one is assumed to be the
flag of a united, pre-First Imperium Sylea.  The second would be the Ziru
Sirka, followed by the Terran Confederation, the Rule of Man (Second
Imperium), Sylean Federation, and finally, the Third Imperium.  I don\'t think
the influence of the Old Earth Union reached Sylea, so that\'s pretty much
out, though you could extrapolate Sylea into a pocket empire and have a
seventh.  Anyhow, that\'s the way it looks, as far as I can figure.

Six Flags Over Texas was the first of several theme parks in the US owned by
Six Flags, Inc.  Despite the fact that there is now a Six Flags Over
Mid-America, Six Flags Over Georgia, Six Flags Great America, Six Flags Great
Adventure, ad nauseum, the original name referred to the six governments
which led Texas (if Texans would ever allow it to be said they were *led*.
 They prefer to go their own way).  In no particular order, (I think) they
are: French, Spanish, Mexican, the Republic of Texas, the Confederate States
of America, and the United States of America.  Actually, to relate this to
Traveller in some meaningful way, this post has given me the idea of
modelling a planet, and it\'s history, after Texas.  It truly does have a
fascinating, frontier-type history.  And how many states in America existed
as independent nations for nine years (as Texas did, and some folks down
there think they still do).  :-)

"Hals" means "neck". Even if this sounds strange to you, this is a way of 
wishing luck ("Break your neck and leg!"). Some sarcasm here...
As sailors wish "Mast- und Schottbruch", which means "break your mast and 
your ????" (don\'t know the word for "Schott").

Some of your comments are right on the mark: I was trying to go for the
_minimum_ requirements, which were still probably too big for some of the
smaller class A ports.  The size of the starport has a lot to do with the
population and traffic of the world. A class A port might be compared to a
controlled access freeway: You have standard 4-lane rural versions with
sparse traffic, and you have 12-lane major arteries that still get clogged.
A high population, high tech, industrial capital on a major trade route
would measure traffic in ships per minute.

On such a world, yes definitely on multiple downports. Also yes on separate
berthing/service/repair facilities. Probably yes also on multiple orbital
components, but only a few. It ranges between between inconvenient and
impossible for most ships larger than about 1000 tons 
to land on a planetary surface, so most large ships do remain in parking
orbit, and rely on shuttles and launches for transfers to planetary
surfaces.

Oops!  Seriously misplaced a decimal point there.  With a population of 10
billion, one one-hundredth of one percent (or one percent of one percent; or
 0.0001) equals only 114.15 passengers per hour, a number which shoots my
point to hell.  One tenth of one percent seems more likely, and makes my
earlier math correct.

As regards Thad Coons\' comments, I also agree that there would be fewer
orbital components relative to the number of groundside.  Groundside
facilities are cheaper to build, and maintain, than orbital.  I see the
primary function of orbital facilities as being a "control tower," and
coordinating parking orbits and shuttle services to and from the same.  Hey,
cool!  Valet parking in LPO.

so you need other news items to make the important ones less obvious.
I also have "ship\'s in port" at each stop, so that the PCs can look up
old friends, expect problems with old enemies, and actively search for
rumours from arriving vessels.  There are other props such as computer
data acquired, forms needing filling in and signatures affixed.  All

The problem I see is that you seem to suggest that there is a humanly
way to figth wars.  War is hell (W.T. Sherman).  It is, sadly, one of
the things we humans are best at and, ultimately, the one thing that
distinguishes us (higher primates which includes some other primates)
from other animals (ants do not wage war in the sense of organized
violence).

The suggestion of champions would mean that a society would accept to
submit to a judgement of champions.  This is unthinkable in a 
democracy
and even more in a dictatorship based on violence.  A leader that 
would
have failed would simply be killed by his own side.

The closest thing to the type of world that you are describing in 
earth
history would be \'la guerre en dentelles\' (the period that includes
Frederick the Great and Louis XIV) where professional armies of 
soldiers
would go out of their way to battle one another and would limit the
devastation.

This went away with total war under Napoleon.  An entire country got
drafted into the war effort, making it total.  We cannot go back to 
the
time of champions.

A democratic leader that would submit to a judgement of champions 
would
be taken out of office and the democracy would simply ignore the
decision and (if they decide to do so) fight.  A dictator would 
simply
be taken out and replaced by another one.

My ranting for tonight.  What a great subject to actually pass on my
frustration on my keyboard...

Not to pick on you specifically Brian, but to everybody whining about 
the
5000 ton limit for SSDS, when did you subscribe to TML, last week?
If not, then you, I and everybody else should have known since June
that this was the limit to which SSDS was going up to.  Except for
new subscribers, this should have come as no great surprise.  The
system was fan designed, after all.

Since you aiom them at the missiles, not at your own ship, I don\'t see

That reminds me of something I\'ve wanted to ask. If you take one of the
listed starship hulls and multiply all figures by some factor, how much
would one be off on the average? If, say, you take 

Wedge U    4    20    5000    4745.3    1365.6    208.2    10396.0    28

how wrong will it be? (I realize that the surface area and the structure
will be wrong, but what about the other stuff?

    'body' => '     I\'ve been thinking about the technological level of the late Sylean 
     Federation/early Third Imperium (SF/3I). From what I\'ve seen in the T4 
     book, it seems that around Year Zero, the SF/3I has *early* TL12 
     technology. Why do I say this? Because certain developments known to 
     be TL12 are not available! 
     
     A notable example is the PGMP-12 (plasma gun, man portable, TL12), 
     which I suggest probably develops from the kind of technology that 
     allows mini-fusion reactors (aka Fusion Plus), which has only recently 
     been discovered in Year Zero. 
     
     The SF achieved TL12 in about -150 (AFAIK), and we know the 3I didn\'t 
     reach TL13 until around 300. I guess this means that around Year Zero, 
     the tech level would be approximately TL 12.4 or so. 
     
     However, the 3rd Imperium is expanding into the space that was 
     occupied by the 2nd Imperium/Rule of Man (ROM), which possessed TL12 
     for some time before its collapse (500+ years?)
     
     For gaming purposes, I think it would be nice to have ROM technology 
     peaking at about 12.9 (late TL12, borderline TL13), giving the 
     potential for SF/3I adventurers to \'discover\' Second Empire 
     *artifacts* that are more sophisticated than existing technology! 
     
     Such artifacts wouldn\'t be super-technology like Ancient relics, but 
     they *could* be a century or two beyond currently available items - 
     and therefore quite valuable! The SF/3I are probably putting a major 
     effort into \'rediscovering\' these technologies, as a way of giving 
     themselves a lead on their competitors; in fact, rediscovered ROM 
     artifacts might have helped the SF get to TL12 in the first place. 
     Another possibility is that the SF discovered an old ROM library 
     holding technological data. 
     
     Ideas for adventures can then be drawn from Traveller: The Next 
     Generation (Sorry! Traveller: The New Error). 
     
     Mind you, few actual ROM artifacts would be in working order. 1700 
     years is a very long time for a device to be sitting there doing 
     nothing...
     
     Another possibility: the Terrans were known to be masters of genetic 
     and robotic technologies. It is quite possible that ROM artifacts of 
     TL13 or TL14 might exist in these fields!

Absolutely not.  The largest ship my players\' characters have ever piloted
was @ 1,000 tons.  (And it didn\'t really belong to them . . . ; ) )  However,
we do occassionally do some non-role-playing "Trillion Credit" kind of
playing, where the Capital Ships are needed.

But my point really is that all of the previous incarnations of Traveller
have allowed for over 5,000 tons.  To call a book "Starships" and stop the
sequence at 5,000 and waste space with expensive color plates that serve no
purpose AND charge $20.00 for it - that\'s what irks me.

that I haven\'t checked them):

>Gvurrdon, Spinward Marches, and Trojan Reaches

I once asked Steve Higginbotham about relative strength due to TL
differences. Here\'s what he said:

Thus one TL 15 ship should be the equal of 3 TL 14 ships or 5 TL 13 or
20 TL 12 ships of the same size.


As an aside, heres what Rob Dean and I have to say about one very strange
aspect of the strength distribution in Trojan Reaches:

Rob:
>>Also, note the existence of Strend in subsector A of the Trojan Reaches. I\'ve

Me:

No, that\'s just precisely not all we\'re given to work with. If it was, I
wouldn\'t be claiming that there is a major discrepancy between recorded
Taveller history and the Traveller rules. But we have a lot more: We have
population figures, we have rules for estimating fleet sizes based on
population figures, we have rules about TL differences and we have 
information about TL differences. 

Based on those the Aslans can\'t hope to make any progress in the face of
even the Domain reserves alone; and even if Norris strips Reft an Trojan
Reaches of the reserve forces, the planetary defense forces can make things
tough provided as little as 15% of planetary forces are jump capable (and
while we don\'t know what percentage of planetary forces are jump capable,
we do know from the Character Generation System that some of them are).
And even if Norris strips the rimward subsectors of _every_ jump-capable
ship (which I for one thinks is a totally unlikely thing for him to do;
it would certainly earn him a nomination for the Worst Leader of the
Century Award (present contenders: Dulinor, Lucan, and Strephon)) Tobia
and Glisten is STILL too much for the Aslans to handle (Though Glisten
may be vulnerable to raids; a belt is an awfully large area to guard).

We also have information about Aslan psycology and politics that makes it
likely that any halfway competent diplomat could turn the Aslan tide even 
with forces inferior to their combined might. (Of course he\'ll need _some_
clout, but not nearly as much as you may imagine. The ability to soundly
trounce any single clan in Trojan Reach is propably enough).

Of course, we can postulate that the Domain dosen\'t have any half-way decent 
diplomats...

As for the Wargr, what we know of their strengths and politics tells us
that they aren\'t even the threat that the Aslans are and that the total
overrun of Corridor and the intrusions into Deneb and Spinward Marches
is equally bogus. They may be able to disrupt trade in Corridor if Lucan
strips it of every jump-capable ship including those from the planetary
forces (which is quite likely what he did), but they are not going to
disrupt military communications and they are not going to take over worlds
like Khouth, Mikesh, Shushaka, Durima, Kaasu, Khukish, Inarli, or Plunge. 
Indeed, about 3 and a half years after the Corridor fleets leave for Core,
Mikesh alone will have over 500 jump-capable 20,000 T cruisers in commision
and 50-100 heavy cruisers and battleships being built and sceduled to be
finished within another year (TCS construction rules). In 1120 the Vargr 
are on their way out of Corridor even if the Corridor worlds have to do it 
on their own (What is much more likely, of course, is that the Domain of 
Deneb and Vland will send ships into Corridor to cover for the absent 
fleets and meet in the middle).

Maybe, but what happens then? An Imperial task force appears, blockades the
world, and either kicks them off the world or (more likely) makes them
swear fealthy to Norris. In the latter case they are no longer part of the
problem; if they have any warships they become part of the solution.

A couple of alternate solutions if the clan in question is violently anti-
imperial:

1) The Imperial Admiral threantens to take his task force back to the world
   the _ihatei_ came from and kick the hell out of its defenses unless the
   _ihatei_ leaves. Since this would make their clan lord vulnerable to his
   neighbours, the _ihatei_, who still owes him fealthy, will have to do
   what is best for him and leave.
2) The Imperial Admiral cfontacts a rival clan and offers them land in
   exchange for fealthy. He then escorts them to the world and helps deal
   with the defenses. Again the new Aslans become part of the solution.

>Allow me to rephrase the point:  The Regency, and the Imperium, may be better
>served by his failing to respond.  

Ah, but what about his oath of fealthy? He owes it to Strephon to make any
reasonable attempt to help him (And even to stretch the definition of
reasonable a bit). Keeping guard against the Zhodani is a reasonable choice
to make, but it is not the only reasonable choice. And it becomes less so
with every passing day that the Zhodani keeps quiet.

but I\'ve run across a few questions so far, and maybe someone out there can
bring me up to speed... sorry if these questions have been covered already,
but I\'m fairly new to the list here.

1)  What\'s the difference between "Stealth" and "EMM"? I found the reference
to the -3 DM  for EMM on p.117 of T4, but I can\'t find a reference anywhere
that tells me what the effect of just plain "Stealth" is.

2) What\'s up with the Sandcasters table? What\'s this "Beam Reduction" thing,
and *why does it mention a d10*??? This is *Traveller*, for gosh sakes...
:)  And why is there a USD number? My reading of the Basic Combat rules says
that each sandcaster reduces laser/PA damage by 1 for each sandcaster, or
eliminates 1 missile. And does Fire Control make any difference with a
sandcaster?

3) How much do missiles cost? I could understand counting the initial
loadout as included in the building cost, but I\'m planning on expending them
sometime, and I\'d rather not have to replace the entire mount.  :)  And
shouldn\'t there be some differences in the effects of  contact nukes and
nuke-pumped lasers? Maybe allow laser heads to attack at Short range,
instead? Can you shoot at a missile salvo with a sandcaster each turn until
it reaches you (once at Long range, once at Short range, and then once at
Very Short, just before impact)?

4) When using various point-defense weapons, can we safely assume that they
don\'t target weapons already killed? In other words, will my sandcasters
affect only missiles that got through my nuclear dampers, or should the
missile-kills from each defense be distributed randomly throughout the salvo?

More questions later, as I come up with them...  :)

I have delayed posting anything on this but this book is simply awful.
And unlike the others who have posted concerns on this and "bought it

disappointed, I won\'t buy anything else from IG without reviewing it
first.  And if it isn\'t any better than starships I will just have to
be happy with my old stuff.

The art is reused, except for the new ships and takes up far too much
space for the quality, and who really needs a full page deckplan for a
fighter or a lifepod?  

The deck plans are poor and the personalities sections, two pages of
3 characters each as far as I can tell had no artwork at all!  Even
the adventures in Challange and Traveller\'s Digest would have portrait
shots of the NPC\'s they introduced, you would think a $22 book could do
the same.

As for the ship descriptions themselves there was no color, no details
given.  The entire thing looked like someone had thrown it together in
a few hours and rushed it off to the printer.

Contrast this with any of the DGP offerings and it suffers badly, how then
can it compete with the current crop of RPG books?

I really miss Joe Fugate.

The list has already pointed out that this is a misinterpretation; six
gee is shorthand for an acceleration (change in velocity) of about sixty
meters per second every second.  This builds up fast -- in one 30 minute
turn, a six gee ship can change velocity by about 106 km/s.

SSDS does raise some interesting drive-related questions.  For instance,
thruster plates now fail to operate efficiently if they are not within
about 1000 diameters of a mass.  Is this a sudden cut-off, or does the
drive efficiency gradually drop?  How gradually?  Linear?  Inverse-square?
Inverse-cube?  The rules seem to imply it\'s a sudden change, but they
aren\'t clear.  

The same question goes for the new thrust-and-lift contragrav drives.
They have an efficiency limit as well ("within ten diameters of a planet"
is the way it\'s put, as I recall).  The wording here suggests a gradual
drop-off ("the given accelerations can only be achieved in a one gee
field", and the odd "only nullifies gravity" comment).  Do they get more 
thrust, say, in a two gee field?  Less in a half-gee field?  For the
same energy inputs?

Incidentally, the thruster plate 1000 diameter limit applied to our
solar system implies that thruster plates can be continuously used out
to the Sun\'s 1000 diameter limit, just short of Saturn (and Saturn\'s
own 1000 diameter limit allows continuous thruster travel all the way 
there).  Beyond that, you begin to depend on coasting mid-course.

Well.  I\'ve got to concede all your points regarding ihatei and Vargr
invasions, Hans.  Still more reasons (IMHO, of course) why the whole bloody
Rebellion makes entirely no sense.  I\'m afraid TCS is still absent from my
collection of CT materials (though if anybody\'s got an extra copy...), so I
really have no "rule" foundation on which to base my argument.  The only data
I was drawing on was "historical" information from the Regency Sourcebook,
Survival Margin, Arrival Vengeance, and TNS, which clearly indicated that the
Cats and Dogs had indeed posted gains; in some cases, significant gains.  I
love your idea of how to deal with ihatei in all their sundry varieties.
 Coopting one clan or another to do the dirty work always made a lot of sense
to me.  You make a great point about Glisten being hard to defend, being a
belt, yet in the Regency Sourcebook, it says that the ihatei were easily
booted out.  Oy.  None of this makes any sense.  I hate to say this (I expect
massive flames here), but why doesn\'t IG throw out all material after 1117
and rewrite the Rebellion.  Keep the highlights like Virus (if you must),
just clean up the details in a way that more closely observes established
practices like TCS.  Or, throw out TCS, and admit that the numbers were
inaccurate, and rewrite them to fit the history.  Just as a point of
reference, BTW, I\'d be curious to see what percent of GNP was spent by
various nations, in various time periods, on defense.  Real world, that is.
 It sounds to me like TCS has a stock rule for determining what percent of
the economy may be spent on ships.  Well what if the population is willing to
accept (or is forced to accept) a lower standard of living.  (See US v. USSR
1945-1990).  Just wondering.

And as for Norris\' oath of fealty <rolling up my sleeves>, we may have to
agree to disagree on this.  Fealty is defined as "the duty and loyalty owed
by a vassal or tenant to his fuedal lord."  Got that from the dictionary.
 How Norris defines his duty can be argued.  Perhaps he would feel it was his
duty to Strephon to tell him to give up.  Norris would offer him asylum in
the Regency, a comfortable life, etc.  Not sending ships when (if) Strephon
called for them is not necessarily disloyal.  Loyalty, again from Webster,
"faithful to those persons, ideals, etc. that one is under obligation to
defend, support, or be true to."  At some point Norris would have to decide
which is the greater obligation: Strephon, the man, or the Imperium, the
institution.  I simply believe that Norris would choose the Imperium.  In
Survival Margin Norris is quoted as saying, "...(T)he first thing to believe
in is that *our* destiny *belongs to us*, and we are the only ones who can
take it away from ourselves.  The Imperium is not a supernatural force.  The
Imperium is not an exhibit in a museum.  *The Imperium is us.*  And the
Imperium isn\'t over until we say it\'s over."  Norris also sent a letter to
the head of each faction, asking (p. 4 of Arrival Vengeance, p. 44 of
Survival Margin) specifically, to whom this fealty is owed.  IMHO, Norris
admires Strephon, the man, and would whatever necessary to help him, but not
at the cost of his domain (the only place the Imperium still lives).  And the
biggest perceived threat to his Domain is not the Vargr, Aslan, or Zhodani,
but rather the forces at work throughout the Imperium that have brought this
great institution crashing down.  Better Deneb should be intact when it all
is over, to act as the conciliatory force to bring the Imperium back
together.  That is the ideal to which Norris would be most faithful.

While most of the time I prefer the smaller vessels, I am currently planning
a game set aboard the I.N.S Coronation (BB-216), a 75,000 ton TL 12
battleship.  The players will control various characters from the senior
officers to the ship\'s Marines.  I\'m stealing the idea from Ars Magica.

For most Traveller campaigns, the big ships are just that: big.  They are
beyond the scale of a free trader or scout in much the same way as a Geo
Metro compares to a M1A2 MBT.

	Responding weakly...Well, we just let you win this year (yah
right:-/) But watch out for the real Arizona team, there boyo...the bball
boys\'ll show you who the Real powerhouse is in this state!

	As for the Rose Bowl, I\'m stuck between a real rock and a hard
place: ASU (gaak I\'m choking on the words) does deserve it, and they
deserve the #1 spot, but my mother-in-law\'s a huge OSU fan, and they may
be here visiting by then.

And for the record, I work for the College of Pharmacy, not Pharmacology,
and if there are further contests, I would at least like to win one of
them, so I won\'t judge them all!

Actually, classic Traveller rules only supported ships up to 5000 tons.  To
build bigger ships, you needed to buy _High Guard_, and the rule systems 
between the standard "Book 2" designs and _High Guard_ turned out to not
quite be compatible.  SSDS looks like a fancy version of "Book 2", when
I think many people were expecting a fancy version of _High Guard_.

I\'d make some comment implying that there might *possibly* be a negative
effect on production values due to the pressure that fans have been 
putting on IG to try and stick to their original, unrealistic release
schedule, but my asbestos shirt is at the cleaners.  That having been
said, I don\'t think _Starships_ is worth $20 either, and illustrates
why I don\'t pre-order products sight unseen....

    'body' => '        I will say going in that I have yet to see STARSHIPS for myself, but
I do have some comments regarding some of the things that are being said.

THE 5000 TON LIMIT: First of all, I agree with Stu; if you objected to the
fact that SSDS was stopping at 5,000 tons, you\'ve had plenty of time to
voice your objections. The document for SSDS has been available on Joe
Heck\'s website for some time now; I\'ve had it for months!
        Secondly, there\'s this tendency for some people to complain bitterly
when they don\'t get what THEY want, never mind if anyone else wants it or
not. There is AS OF YET no system in place for handling starships larger
than 5,000 tons in space battles. When there is it will undoubtably involve
a slighly different rating system than that used for smaller ships (example;
High Guard as opposed to Book 2, or Battle Rider as opposed to Brilliant
Lances). When this system is ready, there will undoubtably be expansions to
both QSDS and SSDS to cover ships of that size. Failing that, there will be
(eventually) the Naval Architect\'s Handbook, which will allow the building
of any size ship you like. In the meantime, FIRE, FUSION and STEEL is still
available to allow building of larger hulls; while it is out of print, there
seem to be enough people who bought it and hated it that I\'m sure they\'d be
willing to unload their copies on you!
Also, what happened to all the complaints about TNE being "too military"?
What\'s more military than capital ships? 
        I\'m sure TCS and High Guard et. al. are fun to play if you\'re in to
that sort of thing. IG is trying to get the basic materials out for
ROLEPLAYING in the Traveller Universe. Traveller is, first and foremost, a
ROLEPLAYING GAME. In my mind, and I\'m sure in the minds of some of the
powers-that-be, this is it\'s primary focus.
        There is no way I would let my characters have ships that big. And
if they fight them, I don\'t need stats; I just say the magic words, "You\'re
Dead". Works real well :)

DECK PLANS: Having not seen them I have no opinion on their appearance, but
we live in the age of the Photocopier. A little fancy trick with copies and
you can overlay your own square or hex grid as you wish. That way, you have
a choice about which to use, whereas if IG had superimposed a square grid,
and you wanted to use hexes, you\'d have to redraw the deckplams anyway!
Freedom of choice; ain\'t it great?

        I\'m just glad, given the circumstances, that there\'s any Traveller
at all.

How about regulations prohibiting large areas of
tarmac/exposed-non-natural-bedrock? Maybe they are just unwilling to allow
the risks of large vessels in atmosphere, and have (at best) a shuttleport
(AKA Type D Port).

Also, dependant upon government, it could be that the D port is the
official civillian one, and several corporate ones of better quality exist,
but charge high fees.

motivation for putting it in (aside from planet-killing lifeboats infested
with virus, loaded with burnt singing hardcovers and high school texts on
Rebellion-era history, and covered in Chris Foss art, natch?

        Personally, I think that it\'s  annoying, and would use the
following explanation for how T-plates work: rather than depend on existing
gravity fields, T-plates create their own.  T-plates have two major
subsystems; a gravity field generator and a big flat plate of dense metal,
sandwiched together with some space in between.  The grav field generators
generate an extremely localized gravity well in a space surrounding the
plate components (hence the gap between the generators and the plates), and
the plate component simply moves within it, shoving the ship (solidly
attached to its T-plates, one hopes) along with it.  Essentially, the ship
just bootstraps itself along.

        As the gravity field is quite localized (rather than space curving
nicely in towards it, it takes a sharp bend, almost like a corner), the
rest of the ship and other vessels are not affected (unless they\'re close
enough to touch) by the field.  Light passing through it is of course
affected.

        As for the annoying blue glow, it is a result of of the photons
being emitted by the  plate interacting with the trailing edge of the
gravity field; the plates become quite hot as a result of the high energies
involved (perhaps they serve as heat sinks for the grav generators).  This
causes them to glow, emitting  photons; as the photons "jump the curb" out
of the area of sharply bent space surrounding the plate into normally
curved space, they emit Cerenkov radiation.

        Thus, the T-plates do not have to depend on local gravity fields...

Only once, it didn\'t last long, but I had to do *something* with the
Azhanti High Lightning deckplanms.  The ship involved had a robotic brain
installed and decided to go it on it\'s own at one point.  Shades of
Vampire Fleets.

5000 tons in the Classic Traveller sense is the largest vessel of merchant
type that one is likely to encounter along the backwater routes of the
spinward marches.  I would expect the fledgling Sylean Empire to be the
same.

No flames, but I would like to say that I disagree with this assessment.  Fan 
pressure isn\'t the reason for the bad art (not just "unTraveller-like," it\'s 
BAD) or the deckplans that any one of us could have done in an afternoon.  And 
it is not like Imperium has delivered shoddy product but met the schedule.

I may be the only one on this list who doesn\'t think the little black books 
are the be-and-end-all of Traveller.  I do think, however, that NO artwork/
deckplans is better than BAD artwork/deckplans, especially if I pay more as a 
result of the bad artwork. 

I think Imperium would be well-advised to recycle old art/deckplans (heck, 
there is 20 years worth available) and concentrate on the system and the 
background.  The first rule of such a product should be to avoid turning off 
the customer;  I wonder how many newcomers have picked up the T4 book, took 
one look at an illustration and put the book back down, never to look at it 
again.

That\'s all of it William, with the exception of a MTJ article that
listed a bunch of extra components that you could purchase for starships
(high-efficiency drives, low maintenance drives, etc...).  I was real
careful not to miss anything when I shipped you that stuff.

People may want to check out GURPS Vehicles as well (to see what an
itegrated design system looks like) and then just convert the stuff over
to Traveller.

I like what I\'ve seen of T4 so far.  The only thing that I would
possibly change is just using MT\'s task system.

Really?  I\'m currently playing the Traveller Adventure..... I\'ll have

remember finding a wallet, but it was described to us,  news

At times I heard \'Kind der Liebe\' [child of love] being used in a way of
meaning \'stupid\' or \'foolish\' but as far as I know as a native german,
it\'s pretty are and not commonly used.

Yes, \'Hals- und Beinbruch\' is used for some sportsmen, pilots, etc.
\'Hals\' means \'neck\'.

        It was another one of those canon-things. The limit was put in to
allow ships to travel freely through most of the solar system, but not out
to the Kuiper belt, located around and beyond Pluto\'s orbit. The Kuiper belt
is supposedly a big belt of icy bodies, which would be perfect for refueling
(say, an invading fleet).

        But canon says that the main areas for refueling for anybody are:
starports, large bodies of water, and gas giants. If you can efficiently use
the Kuiper belt, there\'s no reason to try a gas giant. Which breaks all the
history, feel and flavor for wilderness refueling and invasions.

        So, in our haste (one week from being asked to create SSDS to having
to turn in the results), we grabbed at a hand-waving limitation. Naturally,
there are ways to get around it (I personally think most major military
vessels will have HEPlaR boosters as well as thrusters, anyway, and HEPlaR
works fine out there). Your mileage may vary.

        Except that the generator which creates the force on the plates will
experience an equal and opposite force on itself, cancelling out. Try
lifting yourself up by your bootstraps some time--it just don\'t work.

        It was intended to be a step function based on
(mumble-mumble-tetrion-mhmrfm-mumble quantum-mumble-hrmph-mumble
gravitic-mumble-quantum) effects. The thrusters work fine until the local
curvature of space drops below a specific threshold, and then continue
working at a much lower efficiency.

        That was the general idea, to allow you to get most places in the
solar system efficiently, but deny the Kuiper belt as a more desirable
refueling location than gas giants.

To my way of thinking, the major problem with having characters in charge
of big ships (or big troop units, or big *anything*) is that it gives
them in (paradoxically) too little freedom of choice.  A 75 kton warship
is going to be very, very, *very* closely watched by multiple agencies,
commanders further up the chain, and so forth.  The Captain and senior
officers will have broad discretion on how to achieve goals -- but the
goals themselves will come from outside, and gods help them all if they
aren\'t carried out!

There\'s a lovely scene in one of Clarke\'s early short stories in which the
skipper of an interplanetary cargo vessel bound for Mars muses as the ship
leaves Earth\'s atmosphere.  "Ah, the freedom of space," he thinks to
himself.  "We can travel anywhere I choose...Venus, the moons of Jupiter,
the Belt..."  Then he sighs and continues the thought.  "Of course, there
will be twelve different kinds of hell to pay if I don\'t choose Mars, but
still..."

This to my mind captures the dilemma of being in too powerful a position.
The crew of an aging Far Trader are (relatively) free to go pirate, become
smugglers, involve themselves in secret plots, or whatever.  The crew --
and *especially* the officers -- of a big warship are not.  And this
constrains adventures severely.  Having every adventure consist of "You
receive orders to jump to Obnox XII and pick up Ambassador Querf and her
party" gets a little old...even if you come up with intriguing stuff about
the Ambassador and her party.

Of course, one could argue that Star Trek (especially TNG) suffers from
the same problem -- and this is true.  Trek manages to manufacture tension
by throwing an absurd number of extremely unusual situations at the
Enterprise and her crew.  It\'s really more "space opera" than "hard SF,"
when you come right down to it.  Also, Picard appears to have far more
leeway than I\'d expect an officer in his position to have, given that
(barring plot devices) they never seem to be out of contact with Starfleet
HQ via subspace radio.  We won\'t even talk about *Kirk*\'s leeway. :)

Sorry for the digression into Trek, but it\'s the best illustration I could
find for my point.  Anderson\'s Flandry series does a good job, too --
notice that as he rises through the ranks, he gets more constrained in
his options.  Ditto Laumer\'s Retief -- he\'s a second-string flunky, and
thus relatively free to skulk around during formal dinners and the like.

Brother o\'mine, you\'ve had a major failure of the analogizer. :)

Displacement of your example vessel:  75,000 dtons
Displacement of scout:                   100 dtons
Size ratio:                           750:1

Mass of M1A2:                          5,000 kg (IIRC)
Reduced by factor of 750:                  7 kg

So the correct ratio between your battleship and a scout is that between
an M1A2 MBT and a medium-sized dog. :)

Starships, since it is outside of the regular rules is more of a fancy High
Guard, while QSDS, being in the main rulebook is more of a Book 2, in my opinon.

"fit" and "feel" better than any other we\'d had.  (And I get a minor
egoboo by getting my name in the "Starships" credits for having written
the flavor text for it in the SSDS... :-).

The intent of the gravitational cutoff was to solve several problems:

	1) The aforesaid Near-Luminal Killer Lifeboat from Hell Scenario,

	2) Why don\'t stealthily-travelling ships use the Oort Cloud or
	   Kuiper Belt for refuelling in preference to the (canonical)
	   gas giants, ice balls, or planetary oceans?

	3) Why aren\'t "Calibration Points" and other such deep-space
	   transit and refuelling depots more common for commercial
	   carriers, rather than being purely the province of the
	   military?

The solution, of course, was to limit the "magic" of thruster plates to
within an (admittedly tiny) gravitational field.  I did the math (could
dig it up again if people are interested)... the cutoff ends up being at
about 400 nanogravities or so, which gives stars a _very_ generous space
but limits the "window" of opportunity around, say, rogue comets to just a
few kilometers or even meters.  And it "feels" better to hard-science
types, since we wave our hands to claim that, through interactions with
the local gravity well, the _entire_system_ is being used as "reaction
mass" in order to drive the vessel concerned.  If you had multi-million
ton shipping all heading out in the same direction, ultra-accurate
astrometry equipment might even notice the velocity change.  :-)

As Dave Goldman, several others, and I all agreed during the initial
discussions, "magic" is far more interesting when it has limitations
and inherent disadvantages, rather than being a universal panacea.
The "annoyance" you feel is intentional!

But that\'s the classic recipe for a Perpetual Motion Machine, and gives
many gamers hives.  To give a simpler example, it\'s like moving a train
car I\'m riding in by pulling on a rope attached to the back wall....
It\'s fine for your campaign if it doesn\'t bother you:  but on gdw-beta we
were striving mightily for at least a scientific fig-leaf.  If you do the
math, you\'ll probably find that, to fit the system in a reasonable volume
and yet have it yield appreciable acceleration, you\'re rapidly going to
create a quantum black hole.  And that makes the system even heavier to
lug around....

Only if the speed of light differs in highly curved space from what it is
in flat space, which I don\'t believe is so: Cerenkov radiation requires a
medium in which the speed of light is lower that it is in vacuum, not some
exotic gravitation bounding condition (which I\'m not mathematically
qualified enough to calculate, though it gives me the willies thinking
about it).

	I agree entirely, that\'s one reason it would have been good to
see nicer deck plans. The lack of a grid doesn\'t bother me, but the lack
of detail does. Oh well, it\'s not like they suck; they just aren\'t as
good as Traders and Gunboats, which was a lot cheaper than Starships
even adjusting for inflation.

One thing that would have been good about seeing High-Guard- like rules
is that a few of us use naval strategy, naval bases, and naval
construction for campaign flavor. In fact, I\'ve never used High Guard
and TCS for anything else but these "role-playing" considerations. The
lack of rules in Starships isn\'t going to stop me from doing this, of
course. (I still have my High Guard, afterall, and I\'m working on a High
Guard to T4 conversion.) But new referees may be looking for a little
guidance. And while I\'m sure that T4 is not going to change CT\'s
"flavor," newbies may not yet have a complete sense of what that flavor
is. This means they may have to later invoke a few retcons into their
campaigns if they want to maintain compatability with canon; this
can sometimes be a minor annoyance.

Of course, most of us have known for a while that SSDS was going to be
limited to 5000 tons. But I understand that a newbie who\'s heard of High Guard
may feel some legitimate disappointment.

PS - Hans asked earlier if the hull tables are extrapolatable to higher
tonnages. The answer is yes, if somewhat crudely. It requires a small
amount of mathematical sophistication (in other words, you can\'t have
forgotten your high school algebra), but that is no problem for Hans. I
don\'t know whether this will help Brian; I suspect most people will find
puzzling out the extrapolation formulae too tedious. (Hint: If you have a
spreadsheet program, it is often helpful to plot the tables in a log-log
format.)

What I haven\'t figured out yet is how to extrapolate the spinal mounts.
But I haven\'t had a lot of time lately.

Well I\'ll admit I\'ve done the Trek campaign in Traveller - having the ch  
aracters still enlisted in the Navy. AS a matter of fact, the idea is 
suggested in an article in JTAS #23.

You\'re completely right - the players freedom of choice is severely 
restricted. On the other hand, it makes it very easy for the Referee to get 
his players to go where he wants them to ;-)

It was rather entertaining, but I wouldn\'t want to do it forever. But some 
players do get a kick out of \'owning\' (more or less), a Tigress class 
Dreadnaught.

It\'s no great feat of imagination to guess how much IG will want for a T4

Big targets are big targets, now and forever. The surface area of a box is less than that of a

	First of all, is DGP material considered an official part of the Traveller 
canon? I ask because after checking with Don McKinney\'s Traveller timeline, 
I found a couple references from an MT journal that conflicted with some 
material I was working on for my web page.

	I\'ll probably go ahead with it anyways, but I still can\'t help wondering 
about this.

	Secondly, I really liked the MT idea of each faction/ nation having a 
symbol. Well, I\'m starting to work on my K\'kree homepages (the LSAT is over 
- - finally. hooray!). And I was wondering if anyone had any billiant ideas 
for a symbol for the 2000 Worlds.

	To date the best I\'ve come up with is a tree, but that somehow seems a 
little too peaceful for the K\'kree.

	Any ideas? I\'d be most grateful!

back in Sacramento) and after looking it over a bit I\'m disappointed
with what I see.  First off let my say what I liked about Starships. 
I like that there are new ships and that the "old ships" are
different from previous versions of Traveller.  I had fear that most
of this book would end up being just a recycling of old material and
I\'m very happy that it isn\'t.  I Love deckplans and am quite pleased
to see a large majority of ships with deckplans.  And for the most
part I like Foss\'s black and white illustrations of the various ship
designs.
   Now for the things that I didn\'t like about Starships.  First off,
The information telling us what all the data for the starships means
is buried in the Standard Ship Design System (SSDS) in the back of
the book instead of at the front of the book where it should be. 
While the SSDS allows building more detailed ships than was possible
using the Quick Ship Design System in the T4 main book, the ship in
the book don\'t seem to make use of this extra detail.  In particular,
Its hard to determine how many and what type of staterooms there are
on these ships and its even worst for airlocks and cargo hatches. 
Also, the 12 pages of color art shoved in the middle of the SSDS is
baffling.  These aren\'t any of the ships in the book and in some
cases aren\'t even ships.  Also, there is no attempt to make them
relevant to the rest of the book.  Finally what has to be the biggest
disappointment for me are the deckplans.  Not only are they boring,
but they are drawn very poorly.  Most amateur deckplans are drawn
better than the deckplans in Starships.
    BTW I not particularly bothered by either the lack of Grid lines
or the 5,000dton limit on hulls.

"Heck, my opinion matters too! Doesn\'t it?"

Overall, I liked it...this puts me in the minority it sounds, but I do
like it. I think the designs are well thought out, and there are some
good new designs to offset the inclusion of the old ones. The presence
of the old designs doesn\'t bother me as much as it does some people,
I consider it useful to have all of the designs in one place.

SSDS appears to be good - I haven\'t tried to make a ship yet, but it 
looks good.

The imperial calandar and the personalities are fine - not spectacular,
but not bad.

The art: much to-do has been made about the art - about how it\'s not
Travelleresque....and it\'s not. But it\'s not bad. I think it will appeal to
some people. And since IG needs to bring in some players, flashy
art is a good idea. Old timers like me will always keep the old art near 
and dear...but it\'s just art. If it attracts attention, I say good for
Traveller.

What really disappointed me are the deckplans. Not the lack of grid
lines - that\'s small potatoes. No, the plans are simply bad. There is
no detail. The ships are not designed logically. They don\'t have exterior
airlocks! Most of the ships that have small craft, the small craft docking
areas are not shown. Some room sizes make NO sense - on the far trader,
staterooms are 4x6m...a little bigger than the 3x4.5 that was the norm in
the past. On the secure trader, some rooms are 6x6, and some are 2x6.
And the subsidized liner - where staterooms need to be "nice", has spacious
2x2m staterooms. See if you can fit a bed, fresher, dresser,etc in a 2x2
room.

This part of starships is what I find insulting - these errors are glaring,
in
my opinion. If this is the quality that they were setting out for, I think
they should have scrapped the deckplans and added more ship designs. But,
of course, the better solution would be to have better deckplans. People
have mentioned Traders and Gunboats - this book should be the MINIMUM
standard for published deckplans...and the quality of some DGP deckplans
should be the ideal.

All in all, I enjoyed the material in starships, and I don\'t regret buying
it like
some people did - but I am very disappointed in the deckplans. I really
feel
that if you fix the plans, the book is quite excellent.

\'nuff rambling...

Sorry for the tone of the message that I intended to be humorous (hence
the quote from Living Steel and the attempt at humour at the end, I
though I had been clearer).  While we (me and the original poster) may
disagree over this issue, and technology may change, there is still the
fact that Trav (even if there is a space opera undertone) is still hard
science.  It is possible to imagine a mech unit that would not go into
the ground everytime it attempts to walk by putting grav units into it,
but wouldn\'t it make it even more useless?  Why not build a grav tank
instead?  It also doesn\'t change the signature of these units and their
relative fragility.

I can imagine a feudal type society with the nobles playing around with
mechs, however, the same thing that happened to historical knights would
happen to these nobles: they found themselves outclassed by technology. 
Suddenly, the nobles were being picked out by peasants (how
embarassing).  The same thing would happen to your high tech knights
when they would be facing an army.  The only use these units would have
would be to fight other units of their type.  When facing a regular tank
they would rapidly die.

It is important to remember that I am referring to the technology of
Trav (not some imagined technology).  In traveller terms, a mech is
useless in warfare.  You can imagine that it could have some use as a
pleasure vehicle for racing or fighting between youg nobles, but I don\'t
think it is possible to justify their existence as a military vehicle.

    'body' => 'Well, I called my local gaming store today, and low and behold, they 
had Starships!

I was excited.  I\'ve been reading the recent posts condeming the 
book, but I ran down to the store to get it anyway.  I\'ve been 
waiting too long, and I was thinking 
that people were nit-picking.  Starships probably had some 
problems--so did the main book, but it cannot be that bad.

I\'ve got to admit that the posts did make me a little apprehensive, 
but all that went away when I saw it there on the shelf.  I really 
don\'t like Foss\' art, but the book did look good sitting there with 
the other new items.  My first impression was that this wasn\'t really 
going to be that bad.  I picked it up and flipped it over.  The pick 
on the back was cool too.  The T4 covers have been pretty good so 
far.

One thing that I noticed was that the book seemed a little thin as I 
carried it up to the counter.  A red flag went up, but this was 
probably because of all the bad press it has gotten so far on the 
TML.  I slapped down my 20 bucks plus tax and took my prize out to my 
car to retrieve it from the shrink wrap and immerse myself in its 
pages.

And...I can\'t believe how bad this book is.  I sat there in my car 
astonished.  It was the same feeling I got when I bought Fighting 
Ships for MT (I think I\'ve cracked that book twice since it came 
out--both times just to scan through it).

I sure didn\'t want this to happen.  Massive dissappointment set in.  
The posts are correct.  Starships is a ripoff.

My first inclination was to join the others and say how much I 
dislike this book.  But, a second thought hit me.  Everytime we bad 
mouth the game, it hurts the chances that T4 will become a success.  
A first time player (or long ago player who hasn\'t seen the game in a 
while) finds the TML to learn about T4, and what do they get?  
"Starships stinks", that\'s what.  

I feel a certain responsibility to promote T4--thereby promoting my 
favorite rpg in an effort to do my part in its success.  But, you can 
think about it another way too.  It is obvious that many people are 
disappointed with Starships.  If we don\'t tell IG about it, they may 
continue doing what they\'re doing, and T4 will fail.  People won\'t 
play it if they are unhappy with it.  In this sense, I feel a 
responsibility to report what I do not like about Starships as a 
consumer.  

So, given that thought, what I want to do with this post is not only 
point out what I do not like about the book, but to also say what IG 
could have done to make me happy.  They obviously think they have a 
pretty good product on their hands, and they may be scratching their 
heads wondering why we don\'t like it.

Well, this is why I\'m really upset about the book.  Let\'s take it in 
logical, specific topics.

Content

If you look at Starships, what you are basically getting is a 
reprinting of the Imperial calender (which is fine, because it does 
need to be included somewhere in the T4 rules though I question why 
they chose the book on starships to put it into), 30 pre-generated 
ships with deckplans, 7 NPC characters, and a more fleshed out ship design 
system than was in the basic book.  

$20 does seem a bit steep for bacically 30 ships and a design system. 
 Compare what you get for $20 in other rpgs, and it does seem like an 
inequity.  For $20, you can buy a hard bound Star Wars book full of 
good art, well thought out rules, and tons of information.  There 
just is no comparison with T4\'s Starships.

What would have made me excited about the book as far as content 
goes?  

Well, I would have liked to see more things about Starships.  There 
is more in two pages of DGPs Starship Operators\' Manual that in all 
of Starships.  The book should have had loads of info about space and 
ships.  There should have been sidebars and essays on jumpspace, the 
different types of m-drives, communications, and various other 
techno-babble.  The IG site said that Starships would have the 
function of each ship described.  I got the impression that there 
would be "interviews" with Imperial Navy pilots and scouts about the 
pros and cons of different ships.  A better ship combat system would have 
been a nice inclusion too.  I don\'t know if the one in the main book is missing 
something or what, but it is pretty unuseable.  I thought that they would take 
old Mayday rules and incorporate them into the book.  Looks like I\'ll have to
wait on that.

I could carry this on forever, but I think you can see what I\'m saying.  
There could have been much more in Starships.  I wanted it to be a book 
of "Everything you wanted to know about starships, and then some".  
What I got was something I wish I hadn\'t bought.

The only thing about the book that looks like it was done right is 
the Standard Ship Design System.  I will have to run through the 
system before giving it a more elaborate comment, but on the surface, 
the system does look to be complete.  

With this being the only thing of value I find in the book, you will 
agree that $20 for the book is way too much.

And, I can\'t help but wonder what IG did to produce the book and why 
it took so long.  I mean, the Imperial calendar is a simple reprint 
from its incarnation in CT and MT\'s Referee\'s Companion.  Of the 30 
ships in the book, 17 are from the original book.  There are 13 new 
ships, but members of this list designed 7 of them.  The SSDS was 
designed by list members.  The art was done by Chris Foss.  So, just 
what put IG behind so on this book?  They didn\'t do much with it but 
edit other peoples\' work.  Each of the 2 or 3 lines that Don Perrin 
wrote for each ship is a simple, fill in the blanks statement about 
each ship.  I don\'t know.  Maybe the hold up not IG fault at all.  
Maybe they were waiting on a painting or a sketch to be done, or 
maybe their were final touches to the SSDS.  The point is, IG served 
as an editor on this project--not a creator.

Deck Plans

The deck plans are horrible and, for me, unusable.  I can only guess 
that Ashe Marler used the old Judges Guild supplements as a guide 
when he designed the deck plans.  Anybody on this list could create 
these things in an evening.

And you know, it was acceptible to have these types of deck plans 20 
years ago when Traveller first came out.  As I said, the Judges Guild 
products were notorious for this simple style of deck plan.  But that 
was OK back then.  The JG products were produces at a very low cost 
on recycled, newsprint style paper--and they didn\'t cost a lot 
either.  Today, in 1996, this is just not acceptible.  

We want plans like DGP used to do regulary in the Traveller\'s Digest 
and the MegaTraveller Journal.  Heck, look at the Beowulf in the 
Starship Operator\'s Guide.

And what is the deal with the Scout/Courier?  The deck plans are 
triangular like the 1100 era Scout, but the picture is round.  

I draw better deck plans on the spot, during a game.  IG should be 
embarrassed that these were produced in their product.

ART

Art is subjective.  But, I believe if I took a poll of all the people 
who play Traveller, an overwhelming majority would vote against the 
down right ugly designs in Starships.  How many GMs want to hold up 
one of these pictures and say, this is what your ship looks like?  
I\'m sure that I\'d get an answer like, "Why can\'t we play the Star 
Wars game?  They\'ve got cool looking ships."

I want Traveller to have cool looking ships.  Foss is not doing that. 
I even like the ships in the MT Fighting Ships supplement better, and 
I thought that most of those looked stupid.

I\'m not crazy about the Foss color plates, but I can live with them.  
The other ships, though, have to change.  I know that they won\'t look 
like that in my game.  I\'ll find pictures of other ships, probably 
from DGP, and use those.

How would I have put this book together?

First, I would have changed the art.  I believe the game\'s atmosphere 
should be reflected in its art.  This is not happening with T4.  
There is no way I would have approved the ship drawings, and I would 
have chosen another artist for the color plates.

The art I would have chosen would have been more realistic looking.  
I feel like the Foss stuff is very Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon.  

Next, I would have added more content.  Essays by Imperial Navy 
personnell and such as I stated above.  I would have included a ship 
combat system.

The deck plans would be more like the DGP deck plans, and I would 
condense the ship\'s stats, plans, and picture to about a page.  I\'d 
use the extra space to write about the particular ships and give 
details about the plans.  I\'d have some ships selected for additional 
illustrations of the bridge, engineering, cabin, etc.

Yes, if Starships would have had all of this, I wouldn\'t be writing 
this post and telling my players not to bother buying this book.  I\'d 
be writing a very different post and ecouraging my group to get the 
book as soon as possible.

There is a saying that I usually adhere to--"You get what you pay 
for."  In the case of Starships (and I hate to admit it), I did not 
get even $10 worth.

I\'ve been in (and run) the occasional military campaign where the players
are in control of a destroyer or other military vessel above 5ktons, and it
was fun.

I was also in a campaign where we were the crew of a long-term market
development craft - we had a surplused (helps to have an Imperial Charter,
although it stick us with a useless bastard daughter of a Duke as Captain)
12Kton destroyer (Sir Francis Drake) that had several bays weaponry yanked
and replaced with cargo.   We went on a two year cruise outside the borders
of the Empire (was a non-canon game universe) to find and exploit new
worlds.

An excellent example in fiction is _Honor Among Enemies_ by David Weber,
which details  what happens to Honor Harrington when she is assigned
command of a Q-ship squadron.  I won\'t go into more detail for fear of
spoiling it, but it (and the others in the Honor Harrington series) are
good references for a military campaign.

IMO, one of the best reasons to keep communication limited to jump speed.

I\'d go with either a wartime scenario, patrol the frontier, or explore new
subsector(s) mission.  That way, they have a goal, but nothing more
specific than "be in hex 0308 in three months to meet a courier" in the way
of supervision.

Of course, when you get back to civilization, you may have to explain your
actions - we had to explain several unfortunate incidents, all of which
boiled down to "it was the Captain."  The fact that her final stupidity got
her killed went a long way towards proving our point.

        Hm.  I see.  So it\'s canon-related, then.  Ok, then, inshallah.
I\'ll just go start growing my beard and go buy a prayer mat.  Dunno how I\'m
going to have to break the chador to my GF, though :).

        Agreed on the HEPlaR backup; if your main drive is as crippled as
T-plates are with the 1000d limit, you\'re going to need it.

        It\'s too bad that the Kuiper Belt/Oort Cloud is not a popular place
to hang in in Traveller; ever since I read Carl Sagan\'s _Comet_ I\'ve had a
thing about the Oort.  In fact, I have this really cool idea about a
culture of comet miners that I may use in this Milieu 0 campaign that I

        Why would the generator absolutely have to experience an equal
opposite force though?  What about the Gruuvashilli bozotronic
mumble-handwave Principle of gravitics that states that a Huugaaplonk
flaparms-mutter-quantantrum bounded gravity field projected outside its
generator has no effect on the generator itself ;)?

        Well, as I pointed out to Dave, one could handwave around it, and
to a certain extent, the bootstrap analogy was a bad one; it\'s not so much
that the grav field generators in my explanation would be directly
_pulling_ on the plates; they\'d be creating conditions so that the plates
would be falling towards them; the grav generators, being outside the
field, would not be subject to the same gravitational influence, ie
connected in any way to the motive force; hence the motion, the plates
being attached to the generators.

        I dunno; it does sort of bother me, and I\'m dead sure it would give
Sir Isaac Newton fits, but then again, it does involve a fundamental force
of nature that we haven\'t fully theorized yet being mucked about with by
extremely high technologies that we don\'t know are even possible, much less
how to build.  I can accept for game purposes that terajoules of
electricity suddenly being pumped in the right flow patters into a
lanthanum grid embedded in the hull will tear a bubble of space out of our
space-time continuum, wrap it around the ship, and send it hurtling through
another continuum somewhat contiguous to ours to emerge a week later
light-years away, rather than just simply vaporizing it.  I think that
bootstrapping T-plates aren\'t that much of a stretch in comparison, and
certainly have hard-sf precedents; look at Niven\'s gravity polarizer-driven
ships...

        Hm again.  OK... it was a valiant effort at dealing with the
blue-glow problem, and I\'m certainly not qualified to handle the math
either :).  The main thrust of the idea was that travelling over the curb
would impart excess energy to the photons which they would then dump as
Cerenkov radiation as they emerged into unmangled space.  Maybe there\'s a
slight "raised rim" to the curb.  Whatever.  Anyhow, I have to get back to
work... I hate end of term.

ramifications about the design , capabilities, and operations of military and 
custom-designed ships.

Many of these ships will want the ability to operate in deep space 
and will thus require HEPlaR drives.  They will also want to operate 
within solar systems without having to be concerned about limited 
fuel, and will thus require T-plates.  

So what happens the ship uses both drives at the same time?  Does 3G 
from T-plates plus 3G from HEPlaR equal 6G?  

To carry it one step further, does 4G from T-plates plus 4 G from 
HEPlaR equal 8 Gs of acceleration?  Is there any limit other that 
what you can stuff into a hull?  

I think that 6 G from T-plates can be easily justified by 
Traveller-pseudo-physics as an absolute limit, based on 
a limit on maximum gravitic potential or some such thing.  This 
could also make 6G the maximum that can be compensated 
for.  This ties in nicely with everything from CT on.

HEPlaR is more problematic.  I\'m not sure I  can justify any restriction
on the maximum acceleration of a reaction drive other than the ability of 
the ship and/or crew to survive it.  IMHO, a fit crew should be able 
to survive, for the duration of a starship combat turn, an 
uncompensated acceleration of 1G easily, 2G with some discomfort, and 
3G with degraded performance. They would probably survive 4G, but 
wouldn\'t be fit for duty for some time. (This is based on some hazy 
recollection of something I read about US Air Force? tests of physical 
endurance under acceleration in a centrifuge.  If you have more 
accurate knowledge, please share it.)

So if you design a ship with  6G T-plates and a 3G HEPlaR drive, can 
it accelerate at 9G, with the crew being subjected to an 
uncompensated 3G?  This makes a lot of sense to me, but has 
wide-ranging implications for space combat.  

What do _you_ think?

David, thanks for the explanation.  It actually makes sense.  I agree 
that it captures most of the flavor of CT. 

The point about auxiliary  HEPlaR thrusters is very interesting.  I 
have been thinking about this for a few weeks and have come to the 
conclusion that _all_ military ships in my campaign will have at 
least 1G HEPlaR auxiliaries if I can squeeze it in.

To me the ideal K\'kree symbol would have to have something to do with the

claustrophobic... I picture in my minds eye a stylized half-circle view

I\'ve been following with some interest these thrust plate/gravitic 
threads and the quote above reminded me of something I read some time 
ago, back in those heady pre-teen days. I got the first of a series of 
Time/Life books (I think it was Time/Life) on the paranormal, and this 
one was about UFOs, extraterrestrials n\' such. They had a neat artists 
conception of a real UFO and some conjectured mumbo jumbo on how they 
might work.

The only kind of propulsion technology we know of, like rocketry, is 
strictly "pushing" objects around. The analogy they gave in the UFO book, 
which btw stuck with me all these years, is that if you have a train with 
many cars, and you try to push it down some tracks, you (a) Are not 
moving that train very efficiently and (b) are causing all kind of 
unneeded stress on components of that train. (I wish I had the little 
drawing of a train with all its cars sort-of haphazardly zig-zagging out 
of their characteristic straight line)

They (the authors of this article in the UFO book) figgerd that an alien 
UFO maneuvers so spectacularly through the sky, turning at 90 degree 
angles and so forth, because they propel it by using gravity to "pull" it 
around. They project a gravitic field _in front of the UFO in the 
direction of travel_.

Which brings me to my idea

<heresy alert!>

Thruster plates indeed use gravitic technology to create a warping of 
space-time (a gravity field "dimple" in space time) projected in the 
direction of accelleration. IIRC, somewhere in canon it states (was it 
DGP\'s Starship Ops?) that there is a certain angle within which thruster 
plates provide their thrust:

       | |  /
       | | /         
       | |/   no thrust possible here
       | |\\ 
       | | \\
       | |  \\

I want to throw canon out the window and say that thruster plates point 
in the direction of acceleration "projecting" a gravity field behind them 
(away from the ship). In short, a ship with *aft* thruster plates can 
only accelerate *backwards*. (Would that part of the ship still be called 
"aft" then? hmmmm...)

Before I\'m drowned with a chorus of boos and hisses, let me explain how 
this would solve some nagging little nits:

Since thruster plates and Hep\' drives operate by accelerating in opposite 
directions, Heplar and T-plate drives *can\'t* be used in series. No 
addition of G\'s. (assuming, of course, that they\'re mounted on the same 
side of the ship. I can\'t see how it would be efficient in terms of 
streamlining and engineering placement to do it any differently, and 
besides, what would happen if the gravity field intersected the ship? 
Don\'t open that can of worms or we\'ll get into the Horiz/Vert debate 
ag\'in -- but I digress) 

I have no problem with t-plates "pulling" the ship. When you decelerate 
with HEPlaR drives, you have to turn the ship around, it\'s just the 
opposite effect with t-plates, turn around to *accelerate* face "forward" 
to *decelerate*.

And before anybody pulls out the Laws of Newton and wacks me on the \'ead 
wit\' \'em -- Action-Reaction Satisfaction... Riddle me this: How do 
inertial compensators and artificial gravity circumvent them? How come 
the artificial gravity field that accelerated (oops... M0...) er.. *will* 
accelerate Olaf hault-Plankwell towards the floor of his dreadnaught 
isn\'t counteracted by an equal and opposite force. Or am I stepping in it 
here? Howzzat "normal" force work again? Those mechanics classes are a 
foggy memory now...

In any event, if an artificial gravity field can be created *within* the 
ship to keep everyone accelerating towards the floor without moving the 
ship as well, why cant the pesky field be created to move the ship 
towards a "phantom" floor outside the ship?

OK. I\'m ready to be raked over the coals for this.

Signing off. <steeling myself>

PS. One major flaw in my rambling (it\'s late, forgive me) is this 1000d 
limit thing. If T-plates work on the same gravitic principles as the 
artificial gravity on board the ship, then shouldn\'t artificial gravity 
"conk out" at 1000d as well? erk. My brain hurts. I\'m going to bed now.

I know it\'s not exactly what you\'re talking about, but your description
sort of reminds me of the Alcubierre Warp Drive.  His drive is based around
the use of "exotic matter.", and a sort of negative gravity.  

Check the web site, www.islandone.org/propulsion/alcubierre.html

It\'s not clear to me whether his drive would create a *real* acceleration
or a *pseudo* acceleration.  In any case, the technological implementation
in the Imperium could be limited in some way keeping the drive to some
small fraction of c...

Something to think about.

No, _some_ downside facilities are necessary. Otherwise the upside is cut
off from the inhabitants of the planet. Landing of starships at the
downport, however, would be discouraged or prohibited. Most of the traffic
would be shuttlecraft especially designed for the environmental
requirements. Even underwater facitilites are imaginable.

Type C is manageable by a low population world, but would dominate the
local economy. Type B: inhabitants are wealthy. Type A: Inhabitants are
filthy rich.
As capable as they may be at their designed function, robots are less
flexible (physically and mentally) than humans, and unsuited for tasks that
demand extensive interaction with free-willed humanoids. Expensive, too.

> Port A/B; tech 9- = starport operated by offworld owners 

It\'s actually possible to maintain an orbiting component with as low as
TL-7 (e.g. early Terran orbiting stations) if supplemented by imperial
know-how. Class B is about the best they could do with native tech, and
some imports would be required in any case.
        Good thoughts!

   Using FF&S, the problem with adding gravitics to a combat walker (aka
mech) is not the gravitic generator--it\'s the heplar fuel volume needed
for thrust.  That\'s why it makes sense to mount a gravitic generator if
you can (that way you can get over obstacles when required), but only
carry enough heplar fuel for short duration flights.

   Properly built combat walkers would be low to the ground, thus
providing them with an extremely low silhouette.  They would also have
multiple legs like spiders, so that they would be less vulnerable to
mobility kills when they get a leg blown off.  

   In terms of flexibility in deployment, walker type vehicles are
better in rough terrain than wheeled or tracked vehicles.  They can go
anywhere (within reason) a legged creature can go, and even some places
they can\'t.

>Why not build a grav tank instead?

   Naturally you would, because grav vehicles are better than walkers. 
However, if you don\'t have gravitic generators, or they are so scare
and/or expensive you can\'t afford to put them in your military vehicles,
you are going to have to develop something else.  Combat walkers would
be one solution.  

   Most gravitic combat walkers are going to be retrofit jobs.  An
attempt at saving money, especially if you\'ve got a whole bunch of the
beasties sitting around and you can\'t afford to build a whole new fleet
of grav tanks/APCs, etc.

>Suddenly, the nobles were being picked out by peasants (how
>embarassing).

   Of course if this were 17th century Japan, you could always round up
all the gravitic generators and keep them out of the hands of the
peasents.

   The only way a combat walker (mech) would survive such an encounter
would be to lay low and wait for the grav tank to come in range and then
ambush it.  In general, I agree that they would not stand up very well
in a one-on-one engagement on the open plains.

   The only way you can is if there is additional technological
developments that would allow them to reduce the amount of space they
have to devote to things like transmissions.  I posted a long time ago
my draft of a FF&S Revised Walker Design Sequence.  Perhaps it is time
to dust it off and present here again.

Huh, seems to be some kind of noise on the line, Dave.  Too bad we don\'t have

You want Horiz/Vert, I\'ll give you Horiz/Vert...;-)  Just kidding.  Actually,
I\'m a trifle confused by this part of your post.  Namely, how are the two
drives accelerating in opposite directions?  One is pulling, one is pushing,
much like a front wheel drive car stuck in the mud, with a couple of drunken
fraternity lads at the back pushing, whilst their more sober compadre floors
the gas pedal.  (OK, it\'s late.  It\'s just the image I got).  Or am I missing
something here?  (Besides sleep, that is).  Anyone?

So what\'s the problem? I can read punch cards. I had to do it often
enough back in the 70\'s. I can also read both ASCII and BAUDOT
paper-tape (and have samples of both).

As for the 8 inch floppies, I still have gear that uses them! And I\'m
planning on hooking a spare 8" drive up to an old PC. An 8" MS-DOS boot
disk should be weird enough to freak even my friends.

        This is a no-brainer: I say they add.

        Say I\'m getting 0.3 g acceleration in my VW Beetle, and am clearly
being outdragged by that jerk in his Dodge Viper.  Hah!  say I, and I
trigger the 4 mil-surplus JATO units I have strapped to the roof, thereby
adding another 420 G\'s of acceleration to my Bug, literally blowing the
Vipers doors off.

        I leave the large fireball that would be the inevitable result to
the reader\'s imagination; I don\'t think that any Volkswagen every built
could handle 423.3G accelerations without crumpling like a beer can, much
less the driver.

        Sure: if your hull is built to take 9Gs, and your power plant can
handle the demand, and the crew\'s UPP\'s all read like B9A777, by all means
run 6G T-plates concurrently with your 3G HEPLaR backup drive. Given that
TL12 Inertial Compensators only provide 3Gs of compensation, and G-Tanks
could deal with another 2, you\'d have your crew taking 4Gs at best if you
have Gtanks installed and everybody had time to get in them before the
pilot put the pedal to the metal.  Military crews could probably handle
this for a while, and a really demented Noble out to prove just what a stud
he was to the Sylean Imperial Yacht Club might try to pull it off too.
Your average civilian ship, OTOH, would not...

        Why not then simply flip the plates over so the business end is
pointing forwards and say that those big flat glowing thingies on the back
of the ship are merely the radiators/Cerenkov Radiation Exhausts?  No more
forever travelling in reverse, being the laughingstock of those guys

        I read ya...  Personally, I can accept the 1000d limit if all of
Imperial military history depends upon it, and the details of Imperial
history yet to occur are important to my campaign.  OTOH, limiting an SF
RPG\'s reactionless drive to some arbitrary limit because the game\'s
original developers didn\'t quite think everything through completely, and
the background that developed reflected some of their bad assumptions,
doesn\'t strike me as being a good thing.

        Whatever.  This is an RPG.  We\'re supposed to use it to stimulate
our imaginations, trigger that "sense of wonder" that the cosmos raises in
the minds of anyone with half a brain, and to have a good time.  If canon,
or heretical reinterpretations of T-plate functioning, interfere with this
for you, by all means go with whatever you prefer...  I know I will.  Now
I\'d better get back to the books.

Maybe what we are seeing here is the difference in technology.  This 
is just a suggestion, and I have not thought it out completely.  But, 
here goes anyway.

Is there a possibility that the T-plates were in their infancy in the 
year 0?  They need gravitational force from large mass to push off 
from?  Then, a thousand years later, in the 1100\'s (what we are all 
used to seeing), the technology has been refined to where particles 
actually push off from themselves (as described in the Starship Op 
Man.) allowing use in deep space.

The way the T-plates are described in T4 is how they describe grave 
plates in the 1100\'s.  I remember a description, somewhere, that if 
you altered the altitude govenor on an air raft (provided the 
g-plates were powerful enough), you could take the raft out into 
space, but you would eventually get so far away from the planet that 
you had nothing to push off on.  The air/raft would then remain 
helpless.

It seems the T-plates in T4 are just longer range versions of this 
principle.  I could see, a thousand years in the future, the 
technology growing to be what we all know T-plates to be in the 
1100\'s.

What do you guys think?

One side effect of projecting the gravity well ahead of the path of the
ship will come up in combat - if there are incoming missiles, what\'s to
stop the pilot from manuevering his g-well into their path - that last

Ya, you\'re missing my entire point. ;-)

Since the drives are mounted on the same side of the ship, the frat boys
(representing the T-plates) are hanging onto the rear bumper *pulling*
the car while their buddy (representing the HEPlaR) is flooring it. I\'ll
leave what happens to the drunken frats to your imagination.

The rear mounted T-Plate pulls towards the rear, the rear mounted HEPlaR
pushes away from the rear.

Hope I\'ve cleared up my idea, crazy as it may be.

I guess I wasn\'t clear. I alluded elsewhere in my post that flipping the
thing isn\'t possible because there\'d be the possibility of projecting
the gravity field *within the ship*. You can insist (ie. handwave) that
the projected t-plate gravity field has to be projected a certain
distance away from the t-plate. Or perhaps the field distance is
variable, depending on local gravity potentials, the acceleration
desired... or what if the thing just plain got hit and wonked out its
projection distance?

"Keptin! The T-plate\'s bin hit!"
"Oh shiiiii---- *splat*"

Here\'s the best idea yet: The field projected is a gradient. If you
project the thing from the back over the x metres to in front of the
ship, then people standing on the bridge and the front half of the ship
accelerate at a different rate than those in engineering. Bad stresses
on the structure of the ship (and it\'s occupants), I\'d say.

OTOH, if you meant mount the plates on the *front* of the ship instead
of the back, sure it\'s possible. Just as possible as mounting HEPlaR
drives on the front. But that just changes the definition of fore and
aft, now doesn\'t it? It makes no difference. My whole theory is this:
HEPlaR, like all rockets, pushes. T-Plates pull.

Funny thing is, what you describe above doesn\'t break canon. What do you
think those maneuver/evade programs are for? Any shmuck can give his
ship some random accel vectors, but it takes a real studly program to
compute exactly where and when a gravity well should be placed to avoid
being hit.

Good LORD, I can\'t believe how strongly I agree with your entire post!

The deckplans alone were my main warning signal. Non-artists in my group
could do better! The similarities to Judges Guild is dead on. It\'s very
unfortunate.

I think one of the problems is that Imperium Games seems to lack a decent
graphic artist. Someone in charge of the overall look and feel of the line.
Someone with enough know-how to say "Hold on - this is going to get laughed
off the shelves" when it comes to layout and design. Someone who knows
enough to seek out Blair Reynolds for freelance illustrations. (GDW
suffered the same fate later on in the final releases of T:TNE: some of the
products, cover and interior art was just UGLY to look at).

While I still Believe in Traveller, I think Imperium would do well to slow
down with their release schedule until they get some of the basics
straightened out (yes, I know delays have slowed it down plenty as is - but
I\'d rather see them concentrate on one GOOD release every two or three
months than running around trying to rush out one mediocre/poor release
everyone or two months). In fact, I would have LOVED to have seen T4
released *next* summer instead of last, so that it could have been properly
playtested, edited, and smoothed out. Why the rush (and it WAS a rush) as
soon as GDW folded?

People here know my views on the Foss art. It\'s good. It\'s recycled. It\'s
not Traveller. (Those are for the Starships. The vehicles and equipment
illos in T4 are just ill-conceived). "Starships" IS thin - did no-one look
at DGP\'s "Starship..." to see just WHAT a Traveller supplement should look
like?

Production levels for T4 are FAR below industry standards. I\'ve done a fair
bit of work for Steve Jackson Games, and we may all laugh at some of their
delays, but for the most part, when a SJG product is released anymore, it
looks, reads and feels DARN good.

I love Traveller, and so I hope this is not taken as an indictment of Marc
or his vision. But between the stupid typos in T4 and the out-and-out
ugliness of Starships, I\'m starting to worry. We who all love the game may
pick them up, but what about the newbie, who is going to compare them to
GURPS and GURPS SPACE?

EXACTLY the way MBTs (main battle tanks) were described when the shoulder
fired LAWs and again when the hunter/killer helicopters, like the AH-64,
were first being deployed.

Firepower, armor, mobility, and sensors will offset a lot of the size
disadvantage.

So why not gang inertial compensators?  Really.  Compensator one is engaged
at all times, lowering acceleration effects by 3 Gs.  The second is designed
to kick in when it detects acceleration over 1 G, AND while the first is
engaged.  Boom.  Instant compensation.  Of course, if you can manipulate
gravity to the point where you can use it to push a ship around, why can\'t
you use it to push missiles around, so they don\'t hit you (gravitic shields,
which I use extensively in a GURPS campaign).  You think comet refuelling
would throw canon for a loop, try that one on for size.  Y\'know, one of the
problems with "magic" technology, (and I\'m not disputing the *possibility*
that it could exist some day) is that it creates these sort of problems with
your players.  They say, "Well, if it can do this, why can\'t it do that?"
 (Also not necessarily a bad thing; keeps the earnest ref on his toes).  And
eventually you turn into your parents and say, "Because it can\'t.  I\'m the
referee, and I say so."  (A time-honored tradition amongst referees
everywhere).  That\'s why I tend to use HEPlaR, myself.  Less messy, from a
late-20th century physics standpoint.  (But I do use inertial compensators,
CG, and, for that matter, JUMP DRIVES!  I simply explain CG and ICs as
related technology which can counteract gravity effects, but provide no
thrust).  Though when I\'m waxing nostalgic (like today, since it\'s my
birthday; and yes, I am fishing for birthday wishes) I break out my Black
Books and pretend I\'m a teenager again, and just play without regard for "how
the Universe works," (a la Star Wars) which is a hell of a lot of fun.  And
isn\'t that why we all started playing this game in the first place?

necessarily travel in massive ships. I am using a fleet of this for an Aslan
long-term migration from Dark Nebula to Theta Borealis around the 600s, but
that\'s another story that maybe I will explain later.

Khaoleakh class Aslan Low Berth Transport

It is a mid-sized ship that can transport 700 colonists and 800 tons of
equipment. It is a TL 11 design that was popular in the Aslan hierate in the
500s. Many small companies operated them within the hierate for low berth
transport. When they became obsolete, many minor clans and backwater worlds
used them for their ihatei.

Special Notes:

1) The fuel allows for one Jump-2 and 80h of operation of the HEPlaR drive,
or, alternatively, for one Jump-2 and one Jump-1 immediately after, allowing
the ship to cover 3-parsec barriers in exceptional circumstances.
2) A special, separated fuel deposit of 64.2 ton allows the two twin power
plants to function for a whole year.
3) The ship has a 360 ton hangar for subcraft. It is usually fitted with 3
or 4 90-ton shuttles for refueling and landing (not accounted for in the cost)
4) It is fitted with medium military sensors very useful for exploration.

That\'s the point in doing the multiple characters.  This adventure involves

Well, the Coronation is doing the Great White Fleet thing and traveling to
various worlds contacted by the Imperium to show the flag..  there are the
fair share of Ambassador Querf stories, but a few I\'ve come up with to fill
in the gaps:

Players are a young Ensign and his Marine Shore Patrol.  Assignment: Keep
Keep the Coro\'s crew from running afoul of the law during Liberty.  Hook:
This place was settled by religious fanatics and the blue laws are amazing.
The crew is going to get pretty rowdy when the find a distinct lack of bars
and barmaids....

Players are the crew and passengers of one of the Coro\'s shuttles.
Situation:  While making an in-system run, the shuttle suffers a near
complete system failure, leaving the boat crippled.  Objective: Survive, and
find a way to signal your distress to the Coro.

Players are midlevel officers in Engineering  Assignment:  Someone is making
and selling drugs in your department.  Stop them quietly if possible, loudly
if necessary.  Hook:  Your immediate boss will try to cover up everything to
keep his image clean.

Those are just a few I\'ve come up with so far..

Ah, but a dog stands a chance of at least piddling on, or outrunning a M1A2.

Well, there isn\'t a shoulder fired missle in the world that will do much
more than ruin the paint job on a MBT.. with LAWs you shoot for the treads,
make it a mobility kill, and hose the crew when they bail out.

The point we are making is that something standing up in the middle of
combat will attract attention to itself.  Why do you think that the Infantry
spend so much time hugging mud?  It isn\'t because we like it, let me assure you.

I have seen M1A1s hiding behind 1.5m berms, with their guns so well cammoed
that it took a good look to tell what it was being aimed at.  MBTs can hide
in the woods, under tarps, even in haystacks!

Then there is ground pressure. Tracked vehicles do well in soft terain due
to their weight being spread out over the large surface of the tracks, we
sink into the mud because our weight is pressing directly down onto two
fairly small feet.  Scale this up a little, and you have a vehicle that will
balk at the slightest bad road or off road movement.  I know that grav units
have been mentioned as a cure for this, but do think if the Pentagon got
hold of a device which eliminated 99% of the Earth\'s effect on a item, they
wouldn\'t try staping jet engines to a M1?

>Firepower, armor, mobility, and sensors will offset a lot of the size
>disadvantage.

But I have those too..  and I have four target areas that come to mind
immediately that *can\'t* be well armored and are vital to your operation:
the hips and knees of you \'mech.  I posistion a platoon of infantry with
LAWs along your probable route of advance, have them impersonate bushes
(Army slang for hide), and wait for you to go past.  Then, Whammo!  20 or 30
anti-armor rockets all aiming for the vital leg joints.  If I get lucky, you
are out of the fight before it begins.

<grin>, there are a few issues that emerged during our discussion which 
are clearly in need of attention.  I\'ve outlined them below.  Before I 
send them to Courtney (with explanatory text, of course), do you have any 
other items to add?

I want to avoid the divisive issues, and only give him the things that 
are clearly important to the vast majority of customers.  Also, keep in mind 
that he\'s not promising to implement every suggested change - face it, 
it\'s impossible to make all of us happy about every aspect of T4! ;)

Anyway, here\'s my outline.  Feel free to add items to it.  I\'ll compile 
all the *reasonable* suggestions, and send it along to Courtney (again, 
with explanatory text).


I)  T4 Main Rulebook

    A)  Editing
        1) Grammar
        2) Typographical errors
        3) Errata - missing tables, incorrect values given, etc.

    B)  Task System
        1)  Number of dice rolled at each level (esp. upper end)
        2)  Figuring target numbers (overemphasis on attributes)
   
    C)  Art
        1)  Use original art.  It doesn\'t have to conform to previous
            editions of Traveller, but it should be original and 
            recognizably "Travelleresque."


II)  Starships

     A)  Editing
         1)  Grammar and sentence structure
         2)  Typos

     B)  Deck Plans
         1)  Blank space - all interior hull space should be used
         2)  Interior structures should be drawn according to the design
             system\'s specifications
         3)  Use grid lines

     C)  Ship Designs
         1)  Include a listing of the crew positions

     D)  Art
         1)  Use original art
         2)  Use less of it, or use smaller pictures

     E)  Background
         1)  Include more on the operation of starships

     F)  Personalities 
         1)  Include a small sketch of each individual
         2)  Write them at a higher level of education

     G)  Ship Design
         1)  Include provisions for ship hulls above 5,000 tons.
             A) Perhaps go by thousands between 1,000 and 10,000.
             B) Then go by ten thousands between 10,000 and 100,000.


III)  Shipping

     A)  Method
         1)  Within the U.S., use Priority Mail ($3.00 for 2 to 3 day srvc)
         2)  Outside the U.S., offer choice of 4th Class or Air Mail, 
             at the _actual cost_ of these services (plus packaging 
             costs).

     B)  Packaging
         1)  Use at least a bubble mailer, at best a box.


IV)  Charges

     A)  Don\'t charge anyone\'s credit card until the day the product is
         actually shipped to them.


V)   Future Products

     A)  Just show a little fore-thought.
         1)  Examine previous Traveller products that offer similar 
             design elements as the product you\'re designing.
         2)  Use original art.
         3)  Keep the useful content (i.e., not the art) high, sacrificing
             art if necessary.
         4)  Make absolutely certain to find as many typos, grammatical 
             errors, and rules errors as possible before printing the 
             product.

Nope.  And I know I for one sent along that information, as well as what 
the crew positions consisted of, when I gave Don my designs.  I included 
detailed text descriptions, as well as the USD and crew detail.  

Another item to add to my list of things to discus with Courtney.

I can\'t disagree with this more. I\'ve stayed out of the whole Foss art 
debate (mostly cause Starships hasn\'t made it to Flin Flon), but TRAVELLER 
NEEDS ART!

	The days when CT could get by with no cover art, and very minimal (well, 
make that no) internal art are gone. IMHO, the very drab and colourless 
nature of many of the TNE products really hurt the game on the FNGS store 
shelves.

	Several games have now gone to 100% colour inside! While that\'s probably 
too expensive for Traveller, if T4 is ever going to get beyond this small 
group of fanatics, it needs art!

of a planetary or stellar mass. It only makes sense when thrusting away
from the mass; I don\'t understand how T-plates "push against" a gravity
field when they are thrusting *towards* it. Can someone explain how this is
supposed to work?

Further, what\'s the big deal about fleets refueling in the Oort or Kuiper
belts during an invasion? Surely it\'s a very long way to the Kuiper belt -
and an awful lot farther to the Oort; won\'t the defenders have a lot of
warning that a fleet is invading? They\'ll pick up the invader\'s signatures
long before they arrive - especially since, for half that distance, the
invaders will have to decellerate into the inner system. Even a T-plate
drive is going to be obvious for quite a while. There\'d be no chance of a
suprise attack. Or am I mistaken?

I\'m leaning towards getting rid of T-Plates in my own campaign (a
non-Imperium future history), but have yet to make a final decision. I do
have a theory I\'m kicking around, which might help explain away some of the
nagging problems without drifting too far away from Holy Canon; to wit:

We know that a ship generates an inertial damper field. Seems to me that
reducing an object\'s inertia would make it easier to move. Obviously the
field doesn\'t completely eliminate a ship\'s inertia, because any push would
then cause it to whoosh away at light speed. So we\'ll say that it simply
reduces the amount of thrust required to accellerate the ship. Thus we can
claim that the maneuver drive is a conventional reaction drive (either
fusion or some other rocket system) but it doesn\'t have to produce as much
thrust, or use as much fuel, as it would without the inertial damper field.

But objects on board the ship still behave normally: throwing a softball
down a corridor does not become easier when the damper field is on.
Obviously, the damper field only reduces the inertia of everything within
the field *relative to the rest of the universe*. Relative to each other,
objects within the field seem unaffected.

One problem with this theory is that it violates the law of preservation of
energy: the ship is getting something for (almost) nothing. But compared to
FTL travel, it\'s a minor violation. And we can always point to the Fusion+
plant and say "That\'s where the extra energy is coming from. (Mumble mumble
handwave handwave - ignore that man behind the curtain...)

We might suggest that the inertial damper field is a low-energy effect
related to the jump field and governed by closely-related physical laws -
perhaps it\'s even generated by the jump drive. I suggest this because the
jump drive also alters the relationship between the inside of the field and
the outside universe.

Comments or objections, anyone?

I like this theory mainly because it eliminates the need for reactionless
drives, and it doesn\'t require us to invent things like gravity generators.
I suppose I\'m probably re-inventing the wheel, though. Has anyone suggested
something like this before?

Well, yes, you have almost re-invented the Bergenholm drive, used by 
E. E. "Doc" Smith in his Lensman series, a founding work of the space-opera
sub-genre.  The Bergenholm *completely* neutralized inertia, and worked 
as a hyperdrive as well as a sub-light drive, since there was no longer 
a relativistic mass increase to get in the way of accelerating through 
the light barrier.  No jump-space, either.  You moved faster than light 
through ordinary space.  The only limiting factor on your speed was the 
density of the interstellar medium.  (This introduced interesting navigational
hazards and meant you could fly INTER galactic pretty well, since the 
gas between galaxies is so thin.)

The Bergenholm drive also affected life aboard ship. Your in-flight ball 
game would not work on a Bergenholm craft.  Ship-to-ship combat entailed 
grappling each other with tractor beams, since otherwise your target 
just got batted harmlessly aside by whatever you threw at it.

I figured there\'d be some problems with posting the outline format. :)  
What I mean to say is, if it\'s a book like Starships that is 75% art 
(including deckplans), then it IS appropriate to reduce the size of the 
art, and yes even delete some of it, in order to bring more actual 
gaming content to the book - ie, stuff like you find in Starship 
Operator\'s Manual.

So, I\'m not advocating going back to the little black book style of no 
art.  I just think most folks would rather the gaming supplements have 
more text than art.

Before we go to far into this, let be be really clear.  I don\'t think that
"mecha" ala Robojox, RoboTech or the like are very practical.  Attractive,
and they give the audience something \'humanoid\' to bond to, but not
practical.  Walkers such as exhibited in \'Star Wars\' and in William
Dietz\'s novells MAY have a place.

There has been a lot of experimentation with alternate forms of
transmission for vehicles, including \'legs\' for rough country.  I see no
problem with a multi-legged vehicles in a variety of environments.

This is where this thread consistantly gets hung up.  I really think that
a lot of us are only considering the \'star knight\' mecha (yes, I know
that was what was pictured, but we are discussing the whole class,
right?).  No doubt, they stand tall, and would be difficult to hide on a
plain.  What about an urban setting tho\' (crouching behind, or in an
office building?)   :)

Instead of the \'star knight\', let\'s consider the \'star spider\'.  Central
pod with multiple (let\'s say...8) legs, jointed at the pod and
approximately 1/2 way along the length.  Fairly easy to put a rocket
launcher on top of the pod, perhaps a gun or laser below (with appropriate
firing cutouts).  Various A/P and A/M defensive weaponry placed as
appropriate.

Normal cruising for the vehicle is with the "knee" joint bent aproximately
90 degrees, putting the \'body\' about even with the joint (8-10\' off
ground).  For maximum sensor capability, the knees can straighten, raising
the body another 8-10\' (this can also be used for pop-up shots).  For
maximum protection and stealth, the knees can be bent more to lower the
body to 1\' or so off the ground.  With the knees flexing as the
vehicle moved, platform stability should be high, improving
weapon accuracy.  Flexibility is the key.

Lets consider the M1.  Treads are about 2.5 feet across (as I remember)
and about 40 (?) feet long.  That gives a surface area (assuming I am
anywhere near correct on the length) of about 200 sqr feet (for both
treads) supporting the weight.  Now, on the \'star spider\', say we use 5\'
diameter foot pads on 8 legs...

Even MBTs face difficulty there, which is why we have things like infantry
screens.  The advantage the legged vehicles are supposed to have over
tracked vehicles is there are SO MANY MORE routes of advance.  Thus
causing you to diffuse your defensive strength.  Plus, we have, as I
already pointed out, infantry screens for armor (for just the reason you
describe), artillery barrages, and a whole slew of \'special\' weaponry
designed just for infantry sitting out in the middle of nowhere waiting
for expensive weapons to come along!  :)

As for the legs, well...scr@w \'em!  They are cheap, easy to replace, and
you can afford to lose 4 of \'em before it becomes serious!

: Thoughts?  Comments?  Flames?

I think that we will all be torn on this issue.  I get the very distinct
feeling that lots of people are clamorring for Traveller of twenty years
ago.  If that wasn\'t the case, I wouldn\'t be seeing the arguments over
ships of Mileu 0 not looking like ships of Mileu 1100!

Honestly though, I think a lot of the problems with Starships was that
Don Perrin made the foolhardy mistake of giving us what we asked for.
It may not have been exactly how we wanted it, but it did fit the
original parameters (looking through digest I see things like "I want it
to be like the little black books," "no sidebars if you can help it,"
etc...).

I don\'t think Greg Porter or Tim Brown will make that same mistake.

Have Courtney check out DP9\'s Heavy Gear for what I consider the
"penultimate" game line.  It\'s tight, it\'s well laid out, and it\'s well
written.  The biggest complaints about it is that much of their original
art is recycled too much.

Likewise, anything that BTRC puts out is very utilitarian and well laid
out.  Have him look at CORPS 2ed and the latest version of 3G^3 (it\'s
still at the printers, but the hypertext version is now available).

As for things not to do.  Don\'t put middle-of-the-page-wrap-text-around
graphics the way White Wolf does.

Well, I don\'t look at T-plates as "pushing". (See my previous posts) But
to answer your question, it\'s the gravitational potential lying around
that is important, not its direcitonal vector. If you buy the fact that
gravity is a property of space and is transmitted by gravitational
particles "Gravitons", then if there aren\'t many lying about, the
t-plates don\'t have anything to work with.

This of course messes with the conventional view of artificial gravity:
wouldn\'t everyone start floating around outside the 1000d limit if
T-plates and artificial gravity worked on similar principles? But why
not? I don\'t think it\'s a major canon heresy to say that artificial
gravity is greatly reduced or eliminated outside of the 1000d. limit. It
discourages people from hiding out there, in the depths of space, and
refuelling etc. It\'s rather uncomfortable to float around all the time.

I even thought of a way of explaining why artificial gravity works in
jumpspace <he says, smugly>. If the jump field contains a separate
normal space-time environment, then the mass of the ship takes up a
large percentage of the "mini-normalspace-universe" contained in the
jump bubble, therefore the gravitometric potential is rather high. To
put it another way, the particle density of the normal space in the jump
bubble is really high, so there\'s lots of gravity potential. Artificial
gravity works.

Physisists and Cosmologists: Is my assumption valid? As the universe
expands, does the force of gravity change, however slightly? If we use
the proverbial rubber sheet with a dimple on it analogy; if you stretch
the sheet, the dimple is reduced. If you compress the sheet, the dimple
is exaggerated.

I agree. The K-belt is ~40 AU away. It takes a looong time to get to the
inner system. But the problem isn\'t surprise attacks, it\'s retconning
the strategy of protecting gas giants, and the importants of said GG\'s
for refueling. If T-plates worked in the K-belt, then everyone would
refuel there and not bother getting closer.

Also there\'s the little problem of relativistic objects...

< snippage of excellent inertia discussion >

Here\'s a question I have for physics experts. Is inertia a property of
mass? (yes, I think) Do inertial dampeners basically reduce an objects
apparent mass? (if yes, then artifial gravity doesn\'t really need to be
as powerful as regular gravity, right?)

But whatabout rules for acceleration and fuel usage with HEPlaR drives?
They don\'t seem to take neglected or reduced mass into account...

So then, if inertia is a property of mass, and dampeners *don\'t* reduce
the mass of an object, then what the heck do they do? How do you dampen
inertia without affecting mass? I\'m having trouble handwaving that one.

I don\'t buy this. But I have my own jumpspace assumptions as you well
know ;-) Non-starships without Jump Drives have inertial dampeners. I
think dampeners are more closely related to anti-grav devices which
partially negate mass. Also, you indicate that jump drives generate a
dampening field. This doesn\'t make sense, I\'ve always assumed jump
drives only operate when they are ready to enter jumpspace.

IIRC, in TNE anti-grav was strict mass negation whilst in CT/MT
anti-grav was related to artificial grav and provided propulsion.

I think we, as traveller fans, need well thought out gravitational
"laws" and assumptions. I\'m quite hazy now about how these
anti-grav/artificial grav/inertial dampener/thruster plates work. They
appear to all operate due to gravitic principles but seem (in my mind)
to follow divergent assumptions about how gravity works.

Whatever happened to the Grand Unified Theory?

I\'ve never seen a *need* for reactionless drives. One of the things I
liked about TNE is that it got rid of the pesky things. But since
they\'re back, I\'d sure like a plausible explanation, pseudo-scientific
as it may be, of how they work.

There have been some speculations that the force of gravity changes over 
time, but none of these has yet panned out experimentally.  (Observing 
distant galaxies gives us a window on how gravity worked a long time ago.)
The depth of that "dimple" is determined by the amount of mass in it and 
the gravitational constant, G.  So far as we now know, that constant really 
is constant.

 "Here\'s a question I have for physics experts. Is inertia a property of

Inertia DEFINES mass, and vice versa.  They are essentially two words for 
the same concept.  What "inertial dampers" do is up to the joint imaginations
of the Traveler authors and your local GM, but the general idea, I gather, 
is that they protect the interior of a ship from the effects of acceleration.

To me, that implies they are a form of artificial gravity.  I would 
suppose they are so many acceelerometers, rigged to the cabin gravity 
system, cancelling acceleration effects before you can feel them.

The gravity field around a running starship would be a very twisty thing.

Yes.  I recall glimpsing a ship design that does this in _Starships_.
Fine by me; eventually you\'ll overload those compensators anyway....

I\'ve played with this as legal in TNE (big HEPlaR drives) and yes, 
there are implications.  In TNE, the fuel constraints seems to deal
with those to some extent, as well as the nasty reduced-efficiency
rules for over-acceleration in combat.

Oh, kilometers at least.  Thruster plates are supposed to depend on the
curvature of the field, not intensity, so they should have a 1000 diameter
range around the comet, I\'d think.  Still not much to work with, but just
enough to manage if you jump in with a vector *just* right.  You\'d want
to be good at navigation, though, since jump exits can be a bit off, so
this still isn\'t as safe, and therefore should still work as intended.

My guess (and this is sheer speculation) is that they are seen as
operating by exchanging gravitons/anti-gravitons with a nearby
mass.  Gravitons pull toward the object and anti-gravitons push
away (which is how antigravity works).  The 1000 diam. limit
is based on how far you exchange (anit)gravitons and is consitent
with the fact that (even if you added in enough life support)
air rafts can\'t be used for interplanetary travel.

I never liked them, but that was a matter of taste ("everyone knows"
that spaceships are suppost to whine and kick up dust when they
land!  And "everyone knows" you should be able to use the thrusters
as emergency weapons!  :-)

You\'re completely right - the players freedom of choice is severely

But to me that takes the fun out of gaming.  In our campaigns, it 
wasn\'t about what the GM had setup for us.  It was about what we 
wanted to do.  He had several ideas and would throw adventure hooks at 
us, if we chose not to follow it then he\'d just store it away for a

There again, Traveller is not supposed to be a militaristic game 
correct?  But by "owning" dreadnaught, you turn it into such.

Remember the old saying about not getting a second chance to make a first 
impression?   The first impression in this case is the art, and while I agree 
with K.C. that "Traveller needs art", I think it is important to qualify that 
it needs to be _good_ art.  

While "art" (including deckplans) is a nebulous term, and generalizations may 
not apply in every instance, so far there appears to be three opinions:
1) The art/deckplans is pleasing to look at and fits Traveller.
2) The art/deckplans is pleasing to look at but does not fit Traveller.
3) The art/deckplans is not pleasing to look at.

I for one am definitely in group #3. I can\'t say that any of the artwork/
deckplans -- from the Chris Foss art (which is lame, aside from being non-
Traveller and/or recycled) to the incredibly poor weapons illustrations -- 
qualifies as "pleasing to look at", let alone "pleasing enough to pay extra 
for".  

Some have accused the group #2 people may just be yearning for the past; on 
the other hand, the better the art ties in with the game, the more likely it 
is that people who find the art interesting will be attracted to the game -- 
and more importantly, the _less_ likely it is that people who will be 
atrracted to the game will not be put off by the art.  When someone points out 
that an illustration isn\'t "Traveller-esque", that doesn\'t mean that the 
problem is that the ship designs look different from what we are used to -- 
the problem is that the ships don\'t look like anything the design rules would 
produce.   For example, you wouldn\'t include Star Wars-type illustrations with 
a 2300-type game -- the Star Wars-type game people won\'t like the game, and 
the 2300-type game people will be put off by the illustrations.

If the art can\'t make a GOOD first impression, we need to prevent it from 
making a BAD first impression -- and that means not having it if it detracts 
from the product.  Maybe the answer is to pull the current art out altogether 
and use the old art and deckplans.  I like the idea of new artwork (Traveller 
has always had the problem with every Far Trader looking alike) and I 
certainly don\'t think that Milieu 0 ships should look exactly like ships a 
thousand years later, but presenting the old deckplans/illustrations as 
"typical" with lots of "useful content" (e.g., DGP-style starship operations 
stuff, lots of stats, ship design, cargo systems, the works) is a preferable 
option to the current one one (bad art with little content).

We asked Don Perrin to not abandon FF&S in favor of a ship design system which 
was broken 20 years ago, and to his credit, he did what was asked -- that was 
a very good sign.  I don\'t recall anybody, however, asking for a thin 
expensive book with bad art, bad deckplans, few ship descriptions, or any of 
the other things we got.  I bought T4 and _Starships_ DESPITE the art, which 
is so bad that both products would have been better if it had been left out 
altogether (even if the price didn\'t decrease as a result).

I don\'t claim to represent the roleplaying (or even the Traveller) mainstream, 
and I think that some Traveller players sometimes have a tendency to take 
their game a little too seriously, sometimes forgetting in the process that 
the writers are human beings with feelings and their own visions -- and 
constraints concerning what they can and can\'t do.  I do know, though, that 
there are a lot of other books and games available to spend my money on that 
look like better purchases than what Imperium has produced so far.

OK, my take on all this - more analogies too. Imagine that gravity
is a polar force, like the electric or magnetic forces (I know they\'re
the same, but). If we could treat the Sun like a giant "North" or
"positive" pole, we\'d be able to move freely in reference to it just 
by sticking a big "north" pole on the back of our ships. Alike poles
repel. Or a big "south" pole to move towards it. Maybe we could even move
along equipotential line (ie. at right angles to the attractive/
repulsive force) through... ok, through magic. I don\'t have all the answers.
Anyways, without a big-ass mass, like a sun, nothing to push/pull against.
There aren\'t any equpotential lines to "ride" either.

Now, shipboard AG works by setting up a closed field. Just like there\'s
a big electric field between the plates of a capacitator, you make
a gravitic field between the grav plates.  This doesn\'t require any mass
anywhere, but needs to have a floor and ceiling to work - ie. like on a 
starship.

Well, inertia is a property of mass, but there\'s no guarantee that
inertial and gravitational mass are the same...

Inertia formula: a = F/m
Gravitational formula: a = GMm/(r^2)

Are the two m\'s the same? Apparently scientists have measured them
to be withing 4 decimal palces of one another, but hey, when it comes
to bending the rules, maybe you could cancel (or increase) inertial
mass without affecting gravitational mass, or vice-versa.
Refs feel free to completely snow-under any player with less
than a masters in physics. (hm, that includes me, oh well)

Indeed.

They were going to put it FF&S, but they felt that a grand unified

        Depends on how far it projects; OTOH, if the ship is closing at a
high velocity, the brief amount of time the missile, possibly still under
high G thrust, will be affected by the grav field might not be significant,
especially if the missile is a nuke.  And even if it did, why not allow it?
If it\'s a logical extension of the tech concept, I say go with it...

Well, whatever works for you. Personally, I think my characters had fun for 
the one adventure we had where they ran characters in the Imperial Navy. 
Its a rather different tone, however.

As I said, I wouldn\'t want to do it forever.

I think it depends on what the characters/ players attitude to RPGs are. 
One extreme is where they decide well in advance of the actual game exact 
what their character\'s motivations are, exactly what they achieve. This can 
be quite difficult for the Ref, but lots of fun.

I\'ve also seen (and unfortunately, this is most of my role-playing 
experience) where the characters just stroll into the nearest bar/tavern  
/starport, and wait for thr Ref to drop the next adventure into their lap. 
While perhaps not AS fun as the first extreme, a lot of fun can be had as 
well in this type of gaming environment.

>There again, Traveller is not supposed to be a militaristic game
>correct?  But by "owning" dreadnaught, you turn it into such.

I don\'t know if I agree with this. What about all those TCS 
adventures/campaigns that have gone on? What about all those mercenary 
groups? What about the entire MT Rebellion setting? I think Traveller has a 
definite militiristic element to it, its up to you wether you use it or 
not.

so-called "technical" illos, of things such as deckplans, ships, equipment,
and vehicles, I personally find (YMMV) that blueprint-style illustrations,
such as the side/front/top elevations in the Starship Operators Manual, do
a lot more to convey a feel for the subject of an illustration then does
the cool but artsy Fossish stuff.  Little details such as designers notes
in a font like Architect, dimensions, little arrows with explanatory text
pointed at the details, that sort of thing really help to convey a sense of
verisimilitude.  I find that a blueprint makes an object a lot easier to
visualize than a Foss illo, much as I like his stuff.  And the more detail
in a blueprint the better.

         If Traveller is a Hard-SF game, than more "technical"
illustrations are the way to go: it\'s better at conveying verisimilitude
(especially if the ship drawings actually correspond to the deckplans).
The Foss stuff is really good SF art, and might have a place on the covers,
but if it doesn\'t actually relate to the material, and only jacks up the
price, it\'s gotta go.  So, first piece of advice would be to seriously
rethink the graphic design approach.

        Secondly, quality control is obviously something that needs to be
looked at; my job involves churning out large documents in a context where
a typo or a citation error is the kiss of death.  Proper editing and
proofreading is a *must* for anything that is going to be distributed to
the public.  As well, you don\'t use a sans serif font for text!  As well, I
found that stringing chapters together in some sort of conceptual order
would have helped the first rulebook.

        But enough; I gotta study.

There will be some disagreement on the art, but I think we can all agree that
if they do insert sections of color art ala Starships, please put it at a 
chapter boundary, not in the middle of the Starship design tables.  In general
I think chapters, and especially table sections should be free of this kind 
of interruption.  A smaller picture among the tables on the other hand would
be fine.

I wasn\'t here for the previous discussion on Starships prior to it\'s publication
but I cannot see the reason for not wanting sidebars, I think that if properly
done they can break up the text and make a book more readable, especially if you
don\'t have enough art to fulfill this task.

I get the feeling art is expensive, or can be and that\'s why so many of the 
smaller game companies have trouble with it.   

You should also suggest anyone at IG who is unfamiliar with the competition 
try to get some familiarity with it.  This doesn\'t mean they have to play
Star Wars or GURPS, but they should at least take a look at the books and
see how the other guy is doing it.  Ignorance of the competition is never
a good idea.

Other than that Joe, you have a pretty good list here.

I think you\'re very right here.  I\'m very impressed with Greg Porter who
has told us to "suck the pipe" (in a nice way of course) when it comes
to making certain changes to rules.  Talk about sticking to your guns
and banking on your integrity.  I think we\'ll see that CSC will be a
better book (it\'ll just be populated with horrid art) 8)

I think that IG could stand to use some quality control.  But I also
think that some of us are so old that we don\'t know what the RPG
industry is today.  Someone said that $20 was outrageous for Starships.
Looking around the shelves I noticed that most books of that size
clocked in around the same dollar amount.  And to think, I still
remember paying for my first Traveller product at a hefty $30
(MegaTraveller boxed set).

Joe,

VERY good list. Very succinct. And very good at geting to the heart of the
matter.

As far as art specifically goes:

I DON\'T mind art in Traveller: I mind bad art (ala the late GDW
releases).Art used badly is next on the list.  In fact, the very last GDW
releases managed both bad art AND bad art used badly. I stopped buying
stuff at "Star Vikings." And Roger Sanger can tell you how complete my
collection was up to that point. :-)

A lot of what you said does indeed seem to be a "consensus." But not

I love the new task system. Judging from the large variety of "fixes"
that have been introduced, I would hesitate to say that there is any
kind of consensus (except among a few dedicated math fiends) as to how
to change it.

The new art is vastly superior to the old. It could be improved by
making it more directly related to content, of course, but don\'t go back
to the bad old days.

No! Such detail is less than useless to me unless it\'s extremely well

I\'d suggest that they look to Trav\'s past to see the standard of quality

I\'m not sure why that would be confusing, Glenn.  Basically, we\'re taking
what was long alleged to be a "reactionless" drive, and turning it into a
reaction drive -- thus eliminating a certain amount of handwaving around
violations of energy/momentum conservation.  If you want to move away from
a world, you shove it away from you a teeny bit.  If you want to move
toward a world, you pull it toward you a teeny bit.  Simple Newtonian
equal-and-opposite stuff.  What\'s the problem?

You\'re right as far as you go, but the problem is that a lot of Traveller
canonical history hinges on Jovian worlds and Terrestrial oceans being the
*only* places to refuel in most systems -- in other words, deny the enemy
those, and he *can\'t* refuel.  Providing an alternate fuel source that
probably exists in 95% or more of systems, and can be used without
harrasment from the locals, completely changes the strategic nature of
interstellar warfare -- basically, fronts become a lot more "porous" than
they are in canonical Traveller.

[Nostalgic sigh] E. E. "Doc" Smith, in his "Lensman" series (the best
full-tilt space opera ever written) during the 1930s, pioneered the
"inertialess drive" concept.  When a ship fired up its Bergenholm
generators and "went free," a whisper of thrust would send it shooting off
a multiples of c.  IIRC, FF&S contained a design system for this style of
drive.

None at all.  Grav comp will only go up as stated, so you\'ll pull
more and more gs inside.  You might be able to do 8gs on a ship with
4g g-comp for minutes, but it will get hard on the crew if you try
exposing them to the difference (4gs) for several hours or more.

Yes.  They suffer :-)  Actually, BL had rules for applying DMs to
tasks under different g loads.  All the combat system needs is a way
to express this.

That\'s one of the Big Questions.  When you come right down to it, "mass"
is defined by two properties:

1) Resists acceleration ("inertial mass")
2) Creates gravity ("gravitational mass")

The cool/weird thing is, while the two correlate exactly in every known
experiment, nobody has produced a theoretical basis for their always being
the same.

In other words, if you decrease both the gravitation and the inertia of an
object, you\'ve de facto reduced its mass.  If you reduce just one of the
above, you break the (current) definition of mass; we\'d need new technical
vocabulary to talk about what had happened.

   The original mechs in Robotech, et. al. were suppose to be futuristic
samurai controlled by a human from the inside.  In many ways the mech is
just an extension of the warrior\'s body.  I\'m not a huge fan of
Robotech, but I have noted that over the years additional designs have
been introduced that were more on the practical side.  

   The giant AT-ATs of Star Wars are not all that practical either
(looking back, you sorta expect Luke in "The Empire Strikes Back" to
jump on the back of one of them cowboy-style and ride it like a bucking
bronco, yelling "yahoo!").  They are slow, high profile, lumbering
beasts that are too easily taken down.  While well armored against
energy weapons, apparently all that is necessary to destroy one is to
trip it.  They scream, "we are the Galactic Empire, go ahead and shoot
at us you idiot, we\'ll burn you and your whole family down."  For that
reason they look *very* impressive on the big screen, but that\'s about
it.  The scout walkers from Empire and "Return of the Jedi" were a much
more practical size, though they seemed rather underarmed for a military
vehicle (talk about a design that screams for rocket pods).  Perhaps
they were intended more for crowd control than scouting....

   So could a well designed combat walker/mech.

   Gee, sounds like somebody has been reading my posts to this thread
afterall.

   I\'m figuring on a small head as well (similar to the type on very
large spiders) that would hold a rapid fire engery gun or a mass driver
gun of some sort.

   Imagine the first time infantry encounters these beasties....humans
have a natural fear of spiders as it is, imagine the fear factor one
large enough to hold a crew of two or three would cause.

     being associated with T4. However, I think the place for spiffy colour 
     artwork of starships is on the *cover*, with B&W art of various kinds 
     inside. Heck, DGP did a bloody brilliant job with almost exclusively 
     B&W art! 
     
     A suggestion: get a superartist to do the covers of books (which have 
     to look *great* these days), put the rest of the art resources into 
     good quality deck/building plans, line drawings etc. a la DGP\'s 
     traveller licenced materials. Colour plates inside? Only if IG feel 
     they have too much money floating around...  ;]
     
     I have some limited (very limited) experience of publishing, and one 
     thing I know is that colour of any sort is very expensive. Mind, an 
     idea for making deckplans more visually appealing would be to do them 
     in something cheap like 2-colour (you know, maybe a 4-page spread in 
     the centre of the book with *blue* blueprints, like I remember from 
     DGP\'s Starship Operators\' Manual).

Can\'t explain it. But, it does violate some very trivial references in some
of the traveller games (Imperium and Dark Nebula) about sub-light long term
thrust potential and crossing parsecs in a year or two... without jump
drives. [note to tech-heads: I DID mention this during the discussions last
spring, and was either ignored or dismissed... B-P ]

Again, this was not weighed against the travel times; it is cheaper
(time-wise) to jump in from said belts using a micro-jump. Under TNE, the
previous version of traveller, we had heplar as cannon, but not T-plates,
and even Mars was frequently faster by microjump! The concerns, IIRC were
that "T-Plates wouldbe unballanceing" if not somehow limited (to make
HEPlaR more compareable). The arguments (on both sides) were spectacular.

So, in short, if you want to ignore that limit, it didn\'t exist prior to
T4, and can safely be ignored (unless you\'re paranoid about not being able
to intercept 0.1C asteroids... He, he, he...).

Joe,

Nice constructive criticism. This, rather than lengthy debate, is what is
needed. The biggest recommendation I could make would be to keep prices for
similar industry products. Knowing the slams that White Wolf gets, I still
respect a number of the their products. They pack a large amount of useful
information and then fit poor to good artwork around the contents.

Although the content and "useful" information is different (different
systems and styles) the core concept of information first and then working
the art in and around the content is the most important core.

Actually, I like the Foss artwork. It causes me to think about what could
be, not what the rules or the descriptions say. What I resent about it is
that it takes up so much space. In the starships book, we had roughly 41
pages of pictures with large captions (most of the ship data took up 1/3 or
less of the page).

                107 page book
                 - 2 for the title page and publication info
                  -1 for the table of contents
                  -1 for the introduction
                  -1 for the calendar
                  -1 for the personalities
                  -1 for more personalities
                  -6 for the SSDS
                 - 1 for the worksheet,
                  -1 for the sample usp
                -18 for the tables
                  -1 for the advertisement in the back.

    totaling   73 pages of pictures.

Now, as I said, I like Foss\' artwork, but not $20 for 73 pictures of
varying size and quality.

Food for thought, hmmmm.........

Control and reliability are the two big issues with a combat walker.  The
legs must be controlled and controlled quickly.  You\'d need multiply
redundant controllers and each leg would require a lot of motors to move
it around.  The legs would also have to be strong to move an armored
cabin around at any speed.  They really suffer from leverage problems.
All those motors become a reliability problem.  They all have to work
together or the thing won\'t move.  A single motor going out could quite
easily cripple a leg.  A tank has the advantage of having a very simple
motive system that is probably a whole lot more reliable.  I wouldn\'t
want to have to work on those leg motors...

    'body' => 'I have felt, and argued (ineffectively) that refueling from cometary bodies
is not really much of a strategic issue except in very long term interests.
Here\'s why I believe that the Kuiper and Oort belts are strategically of
minimal importance compared to Gas Giants:

1: Gas giants contain fluids (gasses and liquids) whic are easy to shove
through scoops. Cometary bodies in the outer system do not; they are solid.
Solids will require shovelling, or specially designed "Crusher Scoops"
which can chop up the cometary mass into small, meltable pieces.

2: They are beyond the jump vs thrust threshold; any refuelling that far
out is likely to use micro-jumps to get in. Unless the Ref is AR enough to
figure the 100 diameter limits of the star.

3: they are HUGE ammounts of volume (even if you assume a roughly 0.1AU
mean thickness, ~40 +-0.5 AU, you get 25 CUBIC AU! for the Kuiper belt.)
You couldn\'t STOP someone from using them if you wanted to... but would
they want to? (See #1, above)

4: They may or may not exist in the same relative location in other systems.

5: Gas Giants have many other exploitable resources besides fuel, and are
thus more vital assets than cometary belts

As stated in the Subject line, the above is my OPINION, put out for the
edification of those not yet able to avail themselves of it.

As for the 1000 diameter thrust limit on T-plates, it makes the Kuiper and
OOrt belts nigh on unpatrolable, as well as the outer gas giants, unless
one micro-jumps there, and/or uses a reaction thruster (HEPlaR or Ion come
immediately to mind). It does eliminate some of the concerns about 0.1C +
speed attacks upon worlds, but also makes the outer systems far more likely
(IMNSHO) to be pirate havens.

What could you tell us, I know I\'m interested, about the process that went
into the creation of T4?  What types of alternative systems and stuff did
you create that didn\'t end up in the product.  Also, do you have the \'inside
track\' on Traveller\'s 1997 schedule, at least, that you could divulge to the
general public?

I\'d appreciate any answers, thanks

Yup.  I remember that.  I also remember paying $3.98 for each

Wooaoahhhh! Slow down there K.C. Your statement is not entirely true. In 
Canada we *do* have 2 houses of government: The House of Commons (Rep. by 
pop, 1 per about 50,000 IIRC) and the Senate (Rep. by area)

Our system is unlike the U.S. system in that our senators are appointed

a list of senators to the PM, who then chooses a senator.

An absolute must.  All three of these items must be corrected if Traveller

It\'s easy to pile on the dice when a PC tries to do something *really*
stupid.  The target number system does give high attributes to much pull,
some sort of fix is needed.  An addition of skill uses with other
characteristics would be nice.. using EDU with your Gunnery skill to figure
out how to diable the fire control of the Zhodani Crusier you\'re escaping
from, for example; or SOC with Ship Tactics to hobnob with the admiralty at
a cocktail party.

IG, go forth and look athe works of William Keith and the artists of DGP.
*That* is "Traveller" art.  The slightly rounded look, the scale, all of it
makes for a good hard-SF feel.

Since the reason we want deckplans in the first place is so we can run
conflicts on board (I don\'t know anyone who pulls out a deckplan when the
pilot needs to use the fresher), gridlines should have been included.

I found little or no relation between the description of the ship and the
deckplans.

Use art that makes SENSE.  the beloved Beowulf Free Trader is a lifting

How about a little more about the ships themselves?  Remember Traders and

Advice to IG:  Dig up the old Digest Group supplements.  Well thought out,
beautiful illos, packed with background and useful rules mods.  The Aliens
books, Starship Operator\'s, World Builder\'s Handbook, Traveller Digest/MT
Journal.. these all gave excellent value for the money.

Also, just to add on, our PM is directly elected as a member, not singly.
For instance, in my area, I vote for my MP (member of parliament) and party,
not necessarily the PM, who must run in his own riding.  Unlike the uS
System where you all, throughout the country for the President.

About the US system, that\'s to the best of my knowledge, and I\'l pleade
ignorance if I have it wrong.  I\'m taking a US hisotry course next semester,
but until then, my US politics knowledge is through the newspaper and media.

Thanks

    'body' => '     People have been complaining bitterly about "Starships" (which,
admittedly, I haven\'t yet seen) and a lot of that complaint seems to revolve
around the artwork and the general "look & feel."  People apparently want
a reworking of the "Starship Operator\'s Manual," including the type of info it
had, the type of layout, and the type of artwork.
     Now, while I\'ll admit that SOM was loaded with good anecdotal info and
that really nice \'tour of the ship" section, it was woefully short on
"gameable" info, and, at this point, I DON\'T think it would have been a good
idea for IG to release something like this.  What players of the game need at
this point is ship stats and a design system, not hand-waving technobabble
about how the various systems work and anecdotes.  Another thing to keep in
mind is that SOM was originally published by a lisencee, and thus (presumably)
had a lower expectation of sales; this book wasn\'t supposed to keep the line
afloat, it was a bonus for hard-core fans who really want the extra background
stuff.  I think that\'s a more important distinction than some folks are taking
into account.
     As for the artwork, I\'ve avoided this topic in the past, and plan to
mostly avoid it now, except to say that, when you look at it on the shelf, the
T4 rulebook looks very nice.  When you get it home to read it and notice all
the errors and take a closer look at the artwork, you\'ll become less 
impressed, but that\'s a lesser concern (since hopefully those problems will
become less severe with time).  TNE didn\'t have this immediate visual appeal
even with the main rulebook, and artwork and presentation went even further
downhill pretty fast.  This is the era of color and glossiness, for better or
worse.  I\'m glad that IG at least recognizes that.  Hopefull, they\'ll also
learn to execute their knowledge better...

Now I don\'t have these products, but these references are just impossible. 
One parsec is 3.26 light years. So in order to transverse this distance in 
only 1 or two years using sub-light drives just doesn\'t compute.

There are some reference to sub-light interplanetary travel, but I always 
gathered that it took a lot longer than 1 or 2 years to travel even one 
parsec.

Nah, you get a decent velocity in-system, then accelerate more
slowly from there to midpoint, it\'s still possible, it\'ll just take
longer.  BTW, if any published stuff said you could cross 3.26 light
years in less than 3.26 years, then it was just plain stupid
(assuming it wasn\'t a jump ;-) and should be ignored.

The Grand Adventure is the campaign that I am running.  In it, I am 
linking together all of the major adventures produced for Traveller.

I\'ve been tinkering with it for 3 years, and we started playing about 
a year ago.  Consequently, I have a lot of Traveller stuff (NPCs, 
detailed star systems, planetary info, adventure ideas, home grown 
rules and equipment, short stories, etc) that I am sharing with all 
who are interested.

Remember that the hexes in Dark Nebula are not the standard parsec 
hexes used in most of Traveller.  They are one half parsec 
hexes--1.63 light years.

Does that compute?

Also, maybe they were using some other type of drive besides 
T-plates.  Heplar or some other type?  I don\'t know.  Dark Nebula 
says sublight.  It could be anything.

   Absolutely, and will TL 12 controls or better be sufficent?

   That\'s my theory.  And on Terra in the mid-1100s, a *lot* of combat
walkers get built for the reasons I mentioned previously.  With
gravitics being re-introduced, it is only natural that many of the
combat walkers would get retrofitted with contrgrav generators.

   "Haw! those walkers can\'t cross that river, we\'re safe now!"

   "Uh, sir, you\'d better take a look at this."

   "What\'s wrong, private?"

   "The walkers appear to be crossing the river, sir."

   "But how?!  They don\'t have any boats or bridging equipment!"

   "They don\'t appear to need it...."

Another few things I would like to add to the list:
           4)  Don\'t fill the area surrounding the deck plan in with
               black.
           5)  Label every room on the plan.  Otherwise, people won\'t
               know what the rooms are for (duh!).
           6)  Show more details on the plans (chairs, beds, etc...)
           7)  Put a lot more thought into the plan itself.  Many of
               the deck plans in starships are as badly designed as
               they are badly illustrated.
           8)  Don\'t forget essential parts of the design (like
               AIRLOCKS!)

The Starships book for T4 was a big step backward for Traveller.  The
Traders & Gunboats book for CT is much better... and it was published 17
years ago.

>  TL...

Yeah, but you\'re not.  The perceived internal acceleration *IS* only 3 Gs, or
whatever.  I know the big joke is "perception is reality," but you know what?
 It is.  If the human body only perceives 3 Gs, the same should be true of
the machinery.  Put another way, how does the IC know how much to compensate?
 It must measure acceleration, and compensate accordingly.  The first
compensator does the best it can, and brings our 8 Gs down to, say, 5.  The
second one is attached to the first, sees it is engaged, senses forces
greater than 1 G, and kicks in, bringing the perceived acceleration down to
(the much more manageable) 2 Gs.  If one works, there is no reason why more
can\'t work.  It would have to be set up serially, of course, but it\'s going
to measure acceleration and apply it\'s compensation accordingly, if
necessary.  I don\'t see this as any more problematic than, let\'s see, HEPlaR
and T-Plates used together, jump drives, and any grav comp at all.  The
physics is "clearly" stated; this is how these things work.  And if the tech
level is sufficient to build the things in the first place, ganging them
should be a breeze.  Hell, that part we could do today, if we had machines
that negated acceleration effects currently. Just MHO, of course.  Fire at
will.

Seems like one hunk of ice would have as much hydrogen as you\'d be able
to scoop out of the atmosphere of a gas giant in one swoop.  I\'ve always
been a little suspicious of the whole scooping thing.  Either these
ships go hurtling through the top of the atmosphere where the gasses
are relatively thin (and composed of who knows what), thus not scooping
much at a tope, or they fly deep into the atmosphere and have to thrust
like crazy (or go through at meteoric speeds) to keep from losing so
much speed that they spiral into the gas giant crash.  Seems like no
matter how you do it, it\'s going to be hell on your ship and having an
open scoop is really going to play merry hell with your maneuverability.
I wonder if anyone has done any kind of reasonable first pass feasibility
study on this kind of thing...

Even Jupiter and Saturn are far enough out that you\'re going to have to
thrust for a long time to get from them to Earth.  I\'m assuming (given
that I have no data) that other star systems will be laid out similarly.

All I can think of is that they have all kinds of gasses in their atmosphere.
Of course, that\'s the problem... they\'re all mixed up.  I wonder if you
could even scoop anything since hull friction may be igniting all the
gasses around the ship...

>As stated in the Subject line, the above is my OPINION, put out for the

This is my opinion, too.  :)  Though I\'m curious if anyone really knows
or has done any modelling of a ship scooping hydrogen.  How fast would it
have to be going?  How thick are the gasses?  What is the composition of
a gas giant\'s atmosphere?

If you want to attack a world with large rocks, there are a number of ways
of doing it without launching rocks at .1C.  Jump in to the system and have
special ships that are mostly engine and fuel.  Strap these onto asteroids
and send them on their way.  Strap a sensor pack on the front of the asteroid
and you have yourself a nice guided missile.  If it\'s big enough, shooting
it down would just cause a large number of smaller impacts...

 MAJOR probs here. I saw mistakes in T4 and Starships that even a typical

Define "Travelleresque" to someone who is _not_ a fanatic (admittedly, the

a lot of the Foss interior illos aren\'t. The Elmore b&w illos _are_

Interesting, I think you hit on the problem.  The units on the SSDS

Got my point here.
I just found ONE!!! gamestore, having ONE!!! example of T4 rulebook. 
Price was more than 40,- Dollars (around 450,- Austrian Schillings).

I have thought about "alternative" refuling and powering up systems.

** To gain electric power, you could use the magnetic force field of a 
planet by sticking out a divice, which allows magnetig induction of 
electricity. NASA has aleady experimented with this...

** There could be some devices with quite a high TL, which utilize the 
gravity-forcefields of planets, suns and black holes for generating 
power.

** I would consider the ancients to have used more and more organical 
components in their techs and mechs. There could be i.e. an 
organic-crystalline component which produces either hydrogen or 
electricity as a product of its metabolism (like our urine or sweat or 
so). It may feed on the energy of gravity or magnetic fields or something 
other strange things. (I know it sounds weard, but it\'s ancient tech, you 
know?)

Whadda ya think?

One trip may indeed be better.  Nevertheless, you don\'t have to land the ship on your
one trip.  Can\'t it hover at one meter above the (presumably spongy or above major
animal warrens) ground, and let the team jump out?

Landing in water has some other benefits, too, like fuel and probably better

My first job as a lawyer was at a big firm, one of whose clients was a company that made

So the explanation that ThrustPlates "push against" a gravity well might be
translated to mean that they "convert gravitons to antigravitons," say, or
"redirect the interchange of gravitons between the ship and the star"( or
some such sci-babble), but the effect requires a certain density of
graviton exchange. Neh?

Personally, I like the CT idea that there is no such thing as gravity
generation, only "mass repulsion". Thus, onboard a ship the pseudogravity
is actually caused by repulsors in the ceiling. This clears up a number of
nagging questions, such as asked in my post on the subject a while back. It
also sidesteps your suggestion that artificial gravity on ships doesn\'t
work outside a 1000d limit.

I might also point out that, since most ships are under thrust most of the
time anyway, zero G isn\'t much of a problem (assuming your decks are
arranged perpendicular to thrust - whups not that thread again!) And
perhaps its just the anarchist in me, but I rather like the idea of hermits
and scoundrels lurking out in the cometaries, avoiding the Long Tentacle of
the Law...

>I even thought of a way of explaining why artificial gravity works in

[sound of G.Hoppe patting himself on the back and spraining his arm deleted]

Again, this is unnecessary if the shipboard \'gravity\' is actually repulsion.

I take it that "retcon" is gamedesignerspeak for "retain consistency with"?
Okay, I can see that the IG folks have to jump through hoops to retcon game
history. Fortunately, I\'ve jettisoned the game history, so I don\'t have to
worry about this.

But I *can* suggest less strenuous explanations for the bar on cometary
belt refueling: 

1) Would it not take many times longer to refuel from a comet than from a
gas giant? You can easily slurp the hydrogen out of a gas giant\'s
atmosphere, run it through the purification plant, and liquify it. Simple
and quick. But you\'d have to melt the comet, using up lots of energy, then
separate it, then re-liquify it. And much worse:

2) I\'m certain a comet contain far more impurities than the atmosphere of a
GG? Heavy stuff will be pulled down out of GG\'s atmosphere. Heavy stuff in
the cometaries just sits there in the ice, dirtying it. Why not say that
comet refuelling will cause your purification plant to choke on inedible
chunks of carbonaceous chondrite? Which brings up the question:

3) Wouldn\'t melting and purifying comet ice involve expensive specialized
machinery? Which would probably weigh even more than the (already
incredibly huge) standard purification plants? Would you rather fill your
ship with cargo, or ice mining equipment? Fighters, or a heavy-duty
comet-ice purification plant?

>Also there\'s the little problem of relativistic objects...

Not a very well designed lifeboat. :)  What good is a lifeboat that gets
you home, but then destroys you and your home in the process? Or are we
assuming malicious intent? If it\'s intentional planet-splashing you\'re
trying to avoid, the 1000d limit doesn\'t do anything to eliminate the
danger. You can get the same velocities with a wimpy ion engine, given
enough distance. (Uhoh, not that thread either!)

Hence my contention that an inertial damper field only affects the inertia
of objects *relative to everything outside the field*. Another nice side
effect of this is that, if your dampers conk out, you are not immediately
splattered against the aft bulkhead by your drive\'s thrust. Instead, we can
say that the drive rating depends on the inertial dampening effect; when
the dampers are cut, the ship\'s inertia returns to normal relative to
everything else, so the drives suddenly drop to a fraction of their usual
thrust rating.

>But whatabout rules for acceleration and fuel usage with HEPlaR drives?
>They don\'t seem to take neglected or reduced mass into account...

Hmmm... good point. Something to think about. But isn\'t there a lot of
fudging  the numbers involved in Traveller fusion drives? I mean, could
"real" fusion drives actually deliver that much thrust for so long on that
much fuel? Not being a gearhead engineer, I can\'t say, but from what I\'ve
read (in books such as _The Science in Science Fiction_), there\'s a lot
more \'magic\' in Traveller space drives than real physics. (Do correct me if
I\'m wrong.)

>So then, if inertia is a property of mass, and dampeners *don\'t* reduce
>the mass of an object, then what the heck do they do? How do you dampen
>inertia without affecting mass? I\'m having trouble handwaving that one.

Following this logic (just to see where it leads), I\'d say that inertial
dampers *do* reduce the mass of the ship - *relative to everything outside
the  field*. Again, physics inside the field functions normally. But
relative to a ship standing still, the inertially damped ship will seem to
have reduced its mass. This would have strange effects on orbital
calculations.

Yeah. I was just thinking out loud, trying to tie together jump tech,
T-Plates, and contragrav. I assume they\'re all implied by the same
far-future Grand Unified Theory, as you go on to suggest...

life-bearing moons (Chemosynthetics come to mind, also the possible
magnetosynthesys?)

As for hull friction "Igniting" the gasses... Fire needs OXYGEN.. Something
notably lacking as a free element in what little we know of GG\'s. Magnetic
scooping into physical ramscoops should work.

Also, I normally describe "Normal" scooping as flying rather slow (if not
just wafting down) into the methan and amonia layers, opening the scoops,
and slowly flying through the clouds, and letting the pumps compress the
materials into the tanks.

Cometary bodies need to be bronken into chunks, put where they can be
melted into a liquid state, and fed to the fuel scooping system, or at
least the purifiers. Have fun with pick, shovel, and micro-gravity.

As for vaping and the scooping, we turn to leonard, and ask

"Hey, Leonard, how fast will vaporized hydrogen compouds escape to minimal
concentrations (below trace atmosphere pressures), and likewise, how fast
will liquids turn to vapor, both assuming prior pressur <=0.01 Atm???"

\'Way back in late October, Leonard Erickson <shadow@> said:

I don\'t think this is true. The internal stateroom walls are not bulkheads,
and therefore not airtight. The SOM even suggested that you could unbolt and
move the walls around (justification for the same class of ship having
different floorplans!). There would be a minimum air
circulation/conditioning cost for each room.

However, this is probably just a nitpick and doesn\'t address the main issue.

I think that the real reason for the high travel cost is for the service.
Think in terms of bus/train/car. The cost of a bus vs a car is 1 order of
magnitude (100,000\'s vs 10,000\'s). A average person can own their own car if
they don\'t like taking the bus all the time. Now look at starships. The
average citizen cannot own their own ship; it is several orders of magntiude
more expensive (10,000,000\'s, and the rest!). They have no alternative means
of transport. Now, the starship owner has (generally) a huge debt he must
pay off. I think that *this* is what you can use to justify the price -
starship travel is a luxury service that is being provided to the traveller.
Take out the life-support/food/salaries/etc running costs, and the rest goes
to the bank to pay off the debt.

As for low passage, my opinion is that the Imperium imposes this rate in
order that travel not be totally restricted. Yes I know their charter is to
"not interere", but it is also "not to restrict free trade". I say that the
Imperium uses a minimum of enforcement to allow free trade/cheap travel
between the stars - even the poor can travel (albiet under restrictive
conditions) if they can scrape up ImpCr1000 (yes, exchange rates make this
higher in local currency ;-).

BTW, *you* are the DM! You say what goes. If you don\'t like something,
change it! For example, with passage costs:
1.	Use the exchange rates to change the price.
2.	Roll on the brokerage tables (or some local version specifically for
passages) to increase/decrease the price. The PC\'s get DM\'s for Broker, or
Liaison, or Carousing (whatever seems appropriate at the time!)
3.	Heck, make up your own rules, such as have different ratings for starships:

"Gee, Fred, should we take passage on the _Luxury Star_ or the _Kzurakg_?"

"Well, my holo-crystal of the \'Starship Ratings Guide\' says that the _Star_
really is just a one-star ship. That means shared staterooms, canned food,
poor quality of air, and the minimum in safety equipment. But the _Kzu_..,
_Kuzur_.., oh heck, [points] that other ship over there is four-star."

"Meaning?"

"Expensive. But...[consults hand computer] it does have single-occupancy
staterooms, full stateroom service, a dining room with a *dance floor*, food
fit for four major races..."

[Interrupts] "Ok, Fred I think we\'ve just found our ride. Come on, I want to
try out my new piezo-crystal flashing disco jacket I just bought from that
Vargr trader."

3) Change only what needed to be changed in light of 20 years of role-playing.

Originally, I proposed that we start an alternate time line that would take
place after the Virus Era.  We were going to write a summary book to T:NE
and start from there. However, because Marc and I were working with
Hollywood, they wanted every possible timeline plotted out.  Marc wrote
over 16 timelines.  Miliieu 0, Milieu 200: Aslan Borderwars, etc.  Then we
decided to go retro and bring the universe up to the Virus Era in 3 to 5
years.  I hope that is still the plan.

Wes, my point is that going by the rules and the background information the
reserve forces of Corridor is more than enough to hold it against the Vargr,
any historical information to the contrary notwithstanding. I know that we
are told that the Vargr overran Corridor, but they shouldn\'t have been able
to. Even with ALL jump capable ships removed in 1117 (plausible, given what
we\'ve been told about Lucan) and even if Deneb and Vland didn\'t move in a
few fleets to take up the slack (implausible, given the number of ships 
that ought to be enough to protect against the Vargr), there are a half
dozen high-population worlds that have so massive planetary defense forces
that the Vargr have no chance whatsoever of capturing them (Mikesh has the
equivalent of _200_ trillion credit squadrons (_after_ we\'ve deducted 20%
for jump-papable planetary navy ships sent off with the regular and reserve
forces)). And those worlds would be able to build an effective force of jump-
capable ships in less than three years. Even with no help from outside,
Corridor should be more or less cleaned up by 1122.

Pointing out that the background history says otherwise is redundant. I know
what the official story is. Trouble is, it dosen\'t make sense. Tell me, would 
you have defended a story about the Vargr developing superpowers instead? 
That actually makes roughly as much sense as the official story. Hey, if it 
was psionic superpowers it would make _more_ sense! Yeah, that\'s it, Corridor 
was overrun by a pack of psionic supervargr!!

I\'m not exactly "anti-Foss." I loved his work when
they were on the cover of British paperback editions
of Asimov. I just didn\'t need to see them again in
Traveller.

The problem is, we\'ve seen those chrome tailfins before -
in 1950s science fiction. So instead of evoking the optimism
of the 50s for me, it evokes some of the cheesiest SF I can
 remember.

It may well come back into style in 2,000 years. Here and
now, however, it still looks retro to me.

Perhaps part of the problem in\'t just Foss\'s art, but the fact that
Foss is the only "vision" represented. And Foss\'s vision,
which worked well for Paperback covers, isn\'t to my taste
for Traveller. True, TNE had some awful art in the main book,
the majority was pretty decent. Some was even awfully good.
It was only later, when GDW could only afford one artist, that
it became really awful. But artists as different as the Keiths
and Blair Reynolds and Ken Frank capured a spirit that
seemed (to my mind, at any rate) to capture the spitit of
Traveller.

Foss isn\'t awful - good lord, he\'s one of the finest, most respected
SF artists out there, and his covers got me through Millfield High
School. But (I believe), he is mis-used here. And this is not
helped by the poor production standards of Imperium Games,
which cries out for a professional graphic artist to act at least
as a line consultant. It\'s not enough having good art, it\'s knowing
how to USE it, which neither T4 nor Starships has demonstrated.

        Let\'s add to the fact that #3 implies that you might have to do a
lot of needle-in-a haystack searching, disperse your fleet more thereby
making it vulnerable to forces suddenly jumping in and attacking.  What\'s
the average mass and distribution of icy bodies in the Kuiper & Oort?  If
you\'ve gotta spend long & risky amounts of time finding & extracting, it
might make more military sense to charge in head first and go for the inner
system.

Hey, Rich,

I do a lot of work for Pyramid ("Murphy\'s Rules, among other things), and
was originally assigned the review to write. It caused me a great deal of
pain, but I told my editor (Scott Haring) that I couldn\'t recommend T4 as a
Pyramid pick due to in small part to its typos, but mostly because of the
missing information (Tables, and so on, you know the story...) I said that
I thought we should wait for a second printing, to make sure most of the
obvious mistakes were corrected.

The fact that the reviewer didn\'t even mention the missing info, didn\'t
mention gameplay, and just mentioned on "a few" typos, led me to suspect
that he hadn\'t actually played the game. (A phenomenon quite common in
Gaming reviews, I\'m afraid).

I\'ll be running a Reformation Coalition game in Toronto over the Christmas
vacation.  Part of this game will involve political maneuverings in the
Assembly.  To make this realistic, I need to have LOTS of politicians, aids,
and so forth.  While many can be little more than a name and description, the
more influencial ones will need to be detailed.  I don\'t have the time to do
a good job of this, and besides I don\'t have the imaginaion to do a good job
quickly (ie. after a few most will end up being similar - this has happened
before).

I plan on writing this up as an adventure (probably for TTC).  If you send me
a character, you will receive full credit.  

What I need are name, description (physical and personality), important
assets, goals, motivations, personal history, catch-phrases, and the like.  

To avoid clogging the list (and ruining the surprise of my players), please
post these to me (rob_prior@nynet.nybe.north-york.on.ca).  I will upload them
after the game, along with a _short_ account of what happened (written like
one of the old DGP adventures).

All true, though you can find many of these things in various planets.

Combustion does need oxygen or some oxidizer.  However, a ship coming
through an atmosphere at orbital velocities will quickly be surrounded
by superheated gasses which will probably form a nice plasma shell around
it, much like the Shuttle or a meteor.

I guess you could do this with contragravity, though the atmosphere of a
gas giant is going to have incredibly high winds, nasty storms, high
pressures if you go down very far, and high gravity.  I\'m sure you could
do it, but it\'s going to be somewhat dangerous.

You could use a scoop to scoop these up, too.  Or just pull up next to
it.  As far as melting them, just use heat from the powerplant or drive
to melt them down.

I don\'t necessarily think that scooping up bits of comets, etc... is
better than scooping from a gas giant, I just am not convinced that
it\'s worse...

suggest a positive course of action:

A good starship needs several things:

1) the statistics
2) a deckplan
3) a description
4) a crew roster
5) an exterior drawing
6) a Brilliant Lances counter* (optional)
7) some adventure hooks or suggested uses

* Even if you don\'t use Brilliant Lances, having a counter of some sort for
when you want to game a battle involving several ships is nice.

There are people here who like designing ships.  There are people who are
good at writing.  There are people who are good at art and drawing.  And
there are people with web sites.

By now you\'ve guessed where I\'m heading.  If we can link up and produce some
really good detailed ships, the game will be better for all of us.

To avoid problems with rule editions, I\'d like to suggest that _all_ rules
sets and eras be supported.  Thus, if I design a TNE ship for the Reformation
Coalition, I also include T4 stats so someone who uses T4 rules in the
Coalition can use it.  (If I can\'t convert to T4, I\'m certain someone on the
list could do it for me.)  

As to deck plans, I\'ve decided that the missing grid in Starships wasn\'t so
bad.  Judging by my email, you lot are pretty evenly split between scales
(1.5m or 2m squares) and how to mark them (full gridlines, corners dots,
centre dots...), so having at least one copy with _no_ markings ensures that
the individual referee can use the plans (by drawing on the marking of their
choice).

Thoughts?

some excellent insights into \'how it all fits together.\'

I actually corresponded with Dr. Kaku about the subject of \'ZPF/Inertial

caused by the vaccuum fluctuations around matter--that the ZPF \'resists\'
the motion of an object in the local frame of reference.  Dr. Kaku
pointed out some flaws with that theory.

I also got to confound a \'Starship Design\' panel at NorWesCon (NW
SciFi/Fantasy Convention here in Washington) last year.  Actually there
was one member of the Panel who knew what the heck I was talking about.
Dr. Robert Forward said \'I think I know what this gentleman is refering
to.\'  

It turns out that he\'d recently completed some consulting for the US Air
Force on this very subject.  He found from some research that was done
(at Stanford(?) where a beam of  electrons were fired out of an
accelerator through a high intensity magnetic field and a high power
laser beam) that the reduction in mass was on the order of 10^-6, or in
the range of experimental error-- i.e. little or no effect.

example? (This is a pretty fundamental one - there\'s a 50/50 chance that
any TL-11 starship a player/ref designs will be completely wrong.) 
One gets the feeling that there\'s no one putting much effort into 
going through the books to make sure that they *do* agree with each other, and
produce the results that Milleu 0 wants. (Maybe that\'s wrong - how much
input does Marc have into each project?) Still, fundamental technology 
decisions get made by the authors of each individual product. (For example:
Greg Porter set the minimum size for thruster plates at 10 m3. (I bet
"Starships" doesn\'t reflect this, btw.) That number affects how practical it
is to design vehicles with Greg\'s system...but it also affects how practical
it is to design ultra-high-velocity thruster-powered kinetic kill missiles
that can destroy large starships in a single hit. Personally I think it
should have been 14m3, which makes it much harder to design KKM death-missiles.
It\'s not a big deal, and it\'s ultimately Greg\'s call, and I don\'t think we 
should worry about changing it, but *somebody* at a higher level - presumably
Marc - should be thinking at least a little about how these technology 
issues fit together.

- -insufficient Milleu 0 information to run a campaign in the main rulebook

- -starship combat system in T4 main rulebook doesn\'t work well (see the
Role Playing Combat System put together by people on this list for a better
alternative, even for non-gearheads.) (Gearheads want Brilliant Lances
back.)


- -Find out how much the Foss art added to the cost of (say) Starships.
If it only added a dollar, it\'s a nuisance. If it added (say) $5, it wasn\'t
worth it.

I do it all the time.  I used to use a ship, the "Aulimpia Nuun," (cheesy

liner that charged Cr 25,000 for High Passage, in several adventures I wrote.
 And the very rich traveled on it frequently, for the status it implied.

I love this idea.  (Hell, I thought this was the main purpose of this list
when I joined).  I will be happy to post my designs, and would be more than
happy to write, or edit, backstory for anyone else designs, if they feel they
are unable.  Alas, I am not so great at drawing deckplans (probably why I
love others so much), and have no software to produce them on my computer
anyway, so I would gladly let someone else (who IS good at that sort of
thing) do it.  Sign me up, Rob.  I\'m in.

These are *essential*. Nothing ticks me off so much as having to go through
and fix a bunch of mistakes in a product. OK, nobody\'s perfect, I\'ll
admit... but more time needs to be spent on editing. I also don\'t mind, and
even rather *like*, well-done sidebars.

I like the "KB v. 1.1" fix, myself. It\'s simple, and easy to add in. I\'m
using it already.

I\'ll join the crowd here, and say that the DGP stuff was an excellent
example. I *do* like the way the T4 rulebook gives the art a full page,
rather than interspersing pictures all through it. I *don\'t* really want to
pay more for color plates in my RPG books, though.

As above... and go through *checking* all your cross-references! Make sure
that you don\'t have to on a quest to find a reference in some other book...
put all pertinent data together! I ought to be able to find all the rules
about a starship in the book called "Starships". If that means you have to
skip the deck plans for a light fighter in order to have room, well, we\'ll
just have to suck it up and deal with it, won\'t we?   :)

Yes!!! These deck plans are *awful*, and they *sure* aren\'t worth all the
space given over to them. Also, do we really *need* a deck plan for light
fighter, or a rescue ball? And if all I\'m going to get for the deck plans on
a "luxury liner" is something that tells me roughly what deck things are on,
I\'d rather have the space used for something else.

>     C)  Ship Designs

Heartfelt agreement. Actually, enough data should be given about the ship to
go through and "reverse-engineer" it from the SSDS.

Frankly, I think a lot of the worthless pages of deckplans should have been
taken out, and a complete example of designing a ship should have been put
in, just so that new players, and folks who aren\'t familiar with the FF&S
design sequence, could go through it more comfortably.

The B&W art is, IMHO, not too terrible, but it wouldn\'t have hurt it to be
compressed somewhat to fit in the extra ship data mentioned above. And,
folks, I know this may get me flamed, but some of the Foss stuff, even the
color plates, is damned good... see p. 82 of Starships for my favorite
piece. Yes, other pieces remind me more of Judge Dredd than Traveller,
but... Also, as I said above, I don\'t want to pay extra for color plates in
the rulebook, *especially* ones inserted in the middle of the design tables,
so I have to flip past them every damn time I\'m designing a ship, over and
over...

I *love* background. If it strikes me as "incongruent", I\'ll drop it, but
the "Starship Operator\'s Manual" by DGP was, IMNSHO, the best damn Traveller
supplement ever made. \'Nuff said.

Leave \'em *out* of a book like this. Put them in a supplement focusing on
NPCs, or as an appendix to the main rulebook. I want all my prospective NPCs
in the same place, so I don\'t have to go digging through eleventeen
different books looking for that Marine Captain....

I\'d only add to this specs for 15K, 25K, 35K, and 45K... above that, 10K
increments are fine with me.

Shipping and charges stuff snipped because, as a result of all the past
errors, I just won\'t buy it until it comes to my FLGS. Too many folks have
been burned ordering direct from IG. (Plus my FLGS knocks 15% off the cover

I\'d like to emphasize point 3) here... frankly, IMO, Starships could have
been cut down to a 64 page book selling for $8.95 for what we actually
*got*. More editing, and just more *stuff* will make me a lot more likely to
spend more money on IG products in the future.

In fact, they must have been usign HEPlaR, since T-plates are now TL-11
(or maybe 12.) Which makes it harder to cross interstellar distances - max
delta-V you can get out of a HEPlaR drive is a few thousand km/s before you
run out of fuel.

However, on the whole, Imperium and DN (though wonderful games) are hard enough
to reconcile with Traveller tech that it\'s probably not worth worrying 
about the details. Maybe those interstellar crossings really represented
the slow process of using tankers to establish refueling points.

I agree. But it could have been so much more. Even a fraction of the info
from SOM (which couldeasily have fit into some of the blank spaces or
full-art pages) would have made it a better product.

This was suggested by, I think Don Perrin to the list, that IG, or him were
thinking that offering each book, in a limited fashion available as a
hardcover.  I guess it fell through, at least for Starships.

My idea, is that instead of increasing the cost of sourcebooks like
Starships by making them hardcover, why not just make the Milieu books,
which are the core background material hardcover?

However, I also like the limited hardcovers idea that someone proposed (I
think it was Don, not sure).

Thanks

Combat ranges in T4 are in multiples of 3m. A 1.0m, 1.5m, or 3.0m
square grid is compatible with the T4 combat system.

Personal weapon ranges in T:TNE are given in meters. Several pistols
have short ranges that are an _odd_ number of meters. A 1.0m square
grid is compatible with T:TNE. T:TNE uses a 2.0m grid system, but
that is compatible with a 1.0m grid system.

Deckplans made with a 1.0m square grid are 100% compatible with T4
and T:TNE. (Heck, a 1.0m square grid is compatible with every game
that uses the metric system, for that matter!)

Why not use a 1.0m square grid for deckplans, and be done with the 
issue of compatibility?

Cheers,

Someone mentioned that "The problem with Starships is that
we got exactly what we asked for." I think this is it.

The Traveller we all know and love was produced by a few people
who, due to the nature of things at the time, were by and large
out of touch with the people who bought the product. By which
I mean they didn\'t have direct correspondance, not that they didn\'t
understand people who bought RPGs. I think that our heaping
suggestions upon IG/Marc probably does as much harm as good - 
either these people have the vision and creativity to put together 
a great game and a great background that fits what we all know
and love as Traveller, or they don\'t. If they don\'t have it, no
amount of work on our part is going to give it to them.

After hearing all the complaints about Starships, I\'m sorely tempted
to buy it, fix the typos, put in useful info, sidebars, steal
a copy of Pagemaker and relayout the entire thing! Of course, I\'d probably
do a shit job, but hey, if they can\'t do it the way I like it and
I can\'t either, then I might as well give up. I think CORE has
the right idea - get a license and publich good stuff for T4.
You think that SOM was the best supplement ever published? Well,
CORE, GoldRush, etc all have licenses.  Go out and write it. If
I had the smallest shred of artistic talent, I\'d do it in a minute.
(Well, I guess I\'d need a spare minute too, which I don\'t have, but
my point is...) Like it, lump it or DO BETTER I say.

OK, rant over.

P.S. I really wish someone would go out and find a better artist
or track down Blair Reynolds or someone, \'cause I don\'t like
Foss or Elmore and it\'s not like they\'re the last artists on the face of the 
Earth or something!

And this all comes down to: how does IG want to position Traveller?  CT
drew a heck of a lot of inspiration from 50\'s/60\'s science fiction, which
showed in technology, background, history, and on.  It seems to me that
the quest for "real science" really took hold with DGP and MegaTraveller,
then even greater purity with TNE (viz. Chadwick & Nilsen\'s articles on
laser focusing, the change to HEPlaR, and so on).

People didn\'t like that.  And Traveller had too much at stake in the old
paradigm (okay, I said it, shoot me now) that it had trouble dealing with
newer science fiction tropes like cybernetic augmentation, direct brain
interfaces, nanotech, and the actual research rather than wild storytelling
being done in those fields and contemplating their realistic social effects.
(Look at some of the tech charts in MT: we\'re close, or conceivably capable
of getting close, to many of those things within two or three tech levels,
I\'d gauge, rather than six or seven.  Look at books like Rifkin\'s THE END
OF WORK, or others, about the real social effects that increasing
automation may bring).

So -- which Traveller do we want?  One which harks back to the science and
science fiction of the past, and its grand romantic vistas, or one which
explores the strange and hardly-conceivable wonders of a more "realistic"
future, totally different in feel and assumptions from the present day?
T4 looks to be perched precariously in both camps, between Foss art and
Greg Porter\'s wonders of widespread synthetic diamond and spray-on view
screens, and Traveller fan reaction seems equally to be questing for the
best of both worlds while disliking the baggage that comes with either.

Sorry to wax so philosophical on you guys.  :-)  Any comments?

Again, it depends on the mission.  If you are smuggling in 100 tons of
contraband, it\'s not very practical to hover during the off-loading
period.  If it\'s strictly an insertion of a covert team, then yes...but
what about extraction?  (or is this something the players are not being
told?!)

 Since this has been verified, I encourage others to spread the
 word and to participate themselves.  It\'s nice to see a
 corporation that does things like this, even if they\'re doing
 it for the publicity.

    'body' => '  There have been a lot of negative reviews of Starships here
  lately, and I must admit that I agree with most of the points
  made.  This is simply not what I had hoped, nor, IMO, does it
  even live up to the standard set by the T4 core rules book.

  \'Nuff said on that topic.

  Ken Bearden said, prefatory to his comments about Starships...

        I feel a certain responsibility to promote T4--thereby
        promoting my favorite rpg in an effort to do my part in
        its success.  But, you can think about it another way
        too.  It is obvious that many people are disappointed
        with Starships.  If we don\'t tell IG about it, they may
        continue doing what they\'re doing, and T4 will fail.
        People won\'t play it if they are unhappy with it.  In
        this sense, I feel a responsibility to report what I do
        not like about Starships as a consumer.

  This is a telling remark, with respect to my current thoughts.

  First, I\'d appreciate it if we could drop the repetitive
  remarks about the non-Travelleresque Foss artwork.  I happen
  to agree with them, but really, it\'s something that only need
  be said once. At best, a side remark to the effect of "...and,
  as usual, there are a number of those gorgeous Foss color
  plates" would remind people of the point.  See below about how
  to promote changing it.

  Second, on promoting T4: Bad reviews are a service to the
  buyers, just as good reviews are.  However, they have the side
  effect of discouraging some buyers, and potentially injuring
  the very game that we have all agreed we want to keep alive.
  I spent a while pondering the implied problem, and came up
  with the following solution, which will be implemented
  effective immediately on Freelance Traveller:

        Freelance Traveller has a self-imposed responsibility to
        _support_ Traveller.  Because of this, Freelance
        Traveller can not in good conscience print outright
        negative reviews of a product. Non-committal or neutral
        reviews are acceptable, as they permit the reader to
        draw his own conclusions; and positive reviews are
        always good promotional material for the product and
        product line.

        The reader of FT may draw his/her own conclusion
        concerning the lack of a review of a Traveller product.

  I\'m sure that IG and Sweetpea are continuing to monitor this
  list, and are aware of people\'s opinions.  I would encourage
  people to provide direct feedback (i.e., letters and email) as
  well, setting forth, as Ken has done, what you find
  unsatisfactory about the product.  In this way, we can make it
  quite plain that we are less that totally pleased by their
  work, and why, while at the same time _not_ doing things that
  will ultimately cut into their ability to produce future (and
  hopefully better) products.  Someday, when the company is on
  solider ground, it will be appropriate to change this
  attitude.  But for now, I am inclined to back off to the
  extent that I have outlined here, _in_public_only_.  In
  private correspondence, and perhaps on the TML and GDW-Beta
  (whose name should probably be changed), polite but insistent
  mercilessness is called for - it\'s the closest thing to a
  "family" environment that Traveller has.

  Now, having said that, I\'m going to get off this damn soapbox,
  get into my asbestos/Nomex PJs, and crawl under my bed to get
  some sleep.

I don\'t own this, either, but IIRC correctly Frank Chadwick and Dave Nilsen
wrote in a Challenge "Designer\'s Notes" article that construction times were
left out of FFS because they couldn\'t come up with a system that produced
results that consistently seemed realistic enough.  And, again IIRC, they
said TCS and High Guard each had problems with construction times being
generally too short for most large (over 10Ktons) vessels.  Just adding fuel
to the fire.

My apologies for this little outburst to the rest of you.

Anyway, as for his points about high winds: velocity is all relative to
your frame of reference, Bolie. BASIC PHYSICS. If you match up with the
"High Winds", they effectively do not exist for the person in them unless
they NEED to reference beyond the high winds.

Take, for example, the jet stream. If you get into it in a cessna (Not very
doable, but just for hyperbolic example\'s sake), you will have a ground
speed of over 400 kts, even if your Air speed is only 85 kts. You air speed
simply measures how fast you are to the air around you, a narrow frame of
reference. Ground speed, while insignificant to keeping a plane airborne,
uses a larger frame of reference than the physics of flight, therefore, in
same example, could be in any direction relative to the plane, since a
cessna cannot overcome the jet stream. But the cessna, other than ground
speed, will not really notice the local winds for flight effect, but only
when referncing the ground. The only really notivceable wind effects while
flying are when you cross a boundary between tow different air movement
patterns.

Assuming T-plates, you can enter an atmosphere at relatively low
velocities. Just thrust at 0.95-0.99 of local gravity, and you slowly waft
right down. if you do this slowly enough, most wind effects will be barely
noticeable to the ship until it references the GROUND.

Last night on IRC, we had a great turnout!  Everyone was on early, 
and we even stuck to the topic of the evening, at least until 
everyone had a turn at telling about a favorite character or two!

We were treated to the story of Commander X, the character that Bill 
Prankard, our CmdrX, nicks himself after.  I received his permission 
to relay the story to all of you.

<CmdrX>
Well, the guy you all know as Commander X, Count of Planet X, of
dimension X...blah blah blah yakkity smackity.... began life as a youth on
the hard streets of Efate, during the Zhodani occupation. Wanting to
get out of the streets, and into space, he joined up with a cutthroat
band of pirates.

 The young X, his name still a mystery to this day,
proved to be a brilliant tactician (when his tenure in the pira..er..
Privateers was over X had a Ship tactics skill of 6!) When the war was
finally over, he went into the merc business, mainly patrolling the
Vargr Extents border. Then, without warning, news of Dulinor the
Userper reached the Marches before he knew it, those individual Vargr
raiders became entire fleets! 

It was time to get a bigger ship.   He sold his old 400ton corsair and with 
the extra cash gotten from the doggies, he got a modified 600 ton 
liner.  He heard of the vigilante, and wanted a ship like that   so into the 
extents he went, pillaging the pillagers   then, at the battle of Depot in 
Corridor...the worst happened....   Vargr ships by the hundreds attacked!   
Yes, The Commander was there for that mighty battle   he destroyed 
100\'s of thousands of tons that day, but his ship was soon disabled and 
captured.   

But the commander had a plan   "let them take the cargo, there in for a 
surprise!   the commander took the nuke missiles from the turret and
placed the warheads in the cargo crates   he had the engineer rig a
masking field so that the dogs wouldn\'t detect the bomb.  Well the
mutts went for the bait, the commander the engineer and one last
crewman(all others dead) hid in the "secret compartment" with the
Trojan bomb on board the Vargr capital ship, the commander pressed his
detonator   >PHOOOOM!    2 Megs of nuclear fire ripped through the
doggie crate!

Now safe, and Probably thought to be derelict by the other dogs, the
engineer, X and the computer ops went to work on rigging the jump 
drive and getting the dodge out of hell-they hit the jump initiator, and
jumped OK.   3 days passed and then the computer guy got sick...yep 
misjump!   but they misjumped....back home to Mora!  (lucky bastards!)  

Afterwards Norris knighted Commander X on his deeds...   and went in 
search for a planet to call home.  He settled down on what TNE calls the 
"Ijiwa mines"   unclaimed by the Imp at that time.   For 10 years X became
a bureaucrat and managed this Planet, this was not planet X tho.
(forgot to say this story is rather long!)

It was called Krugers World.  It was not until the Virus came, that 
Commander X once more was called to space duty, as an RQS reserve.
One day while fighting virus infected ships, he thought that maybe
he was infected, but no this was something different. Sensors were
going off the scale, and radio was staticy(thus the virus scare)   but
when the pinpoint scan was activated, the Fortune and Glory, detected
a strange object, floating in space.   Suddenly, as they got closer to
it, a torus-like object, they got caught in a grav well and were
pulled inside a swirling blue-grey field.   

Minutes later the ship finds itself in decaying orbit around a terrestrial 
world.  Tthere are 12 of these, "portals" as it was discovered to be,
in orbit around the planet.  They land, next to some ruins, and there is 
a smaller portal in the ruined city as well-   Eventually they got the
one portal they came from to become a gate between the regency and
this pocket dim- they are still working on the land portal.    

The Commander claimed the world for the regency, and Norris Counted him
Recently, there are rumors of people in another ruined city who wear
ancient Sylean uniforms!     Which now ends my story...or is it just 
the beginning? 


Well, thats the story of CmdrX, for all those who always wondered 
where he got the nick.  Hope you all enjoyed it and won\'t flame me 
for too long a post <g>

Courtney called me today during my lunch hour, and we discussed the 
issues brought up by the constructive criticism we TMLers put together 
(which I sent him this morning).  He hasn\'t had a chance to read the email 
thoroughly (he will get back to me over the weekend with a more 
complete response, since the email I sent him was quite large), but 
here are some things he told me he\'s decided on at this point: 

1)  In the next two weeks, he will put up a list on the IG web site of the 
planned products for 1997.  He will also provide an area on the web site 
for fan feedback.  That way we can tell him of our expectations for each 
product.  

2)  Editing will be a priority.  He wants high-quality editing on all 
Traveller products, and will make sure that is done for all future 
volumes.  Aliens and CSC have already been printed, however, so we\'ll 
have to hope a better job was done on those supplements.

3)  He was upset that the art in Starships was clumped together in the 
middle of the tables section.  He felt that was inappropriate, and he has 
already discussed that with the design team.

4)  Generally regarding the art, he feels the use of color, full-page, 
high-quality art is a must.  He wants Traveller to look better than any 
other product on the shelves, and the art is large part of that.  As to 
what may be changed about the art in future volumes, he can\'t say at this 
point.  But, I did email him the comments about "Travelleresque" art - 
including the definition of that term that was posted recently - and I 
explained it further in our phone conversation.  We\'ll see what happens.

As for the rest of the issues, I\'ll let you know as soon as I find out.  
But the bottom line is, Courtney DOES care what we think about IG\'s 
products.  He wants Traveller to be the best game on the market, and 
understands that we want that as well.

You\'re probably right. Many reviews (including a few I\'ve written) suffer from this 
syndrome. In order to get a timely review, the gamer buys the product, which biases the 
review with the "I paid for _this_?" bug.

I disagree, inasmuch as I think Traveller owed far more to Star Wars,
despite the obvious bows to (primarily) 60\'s SF.

But I agree that the Foss \'50s art DOES have the game ballanced
precariously between the two styles.

Hals means neck.  This was what the German aviators yelled at each other before take-off

Unlikely, since, IIRC, the first printing of the Classic Traveller rules
set came out the same summer as (or even shortly before) Star Wars: this
was one reason for its rapid and runaway success.  Loren Wiseman still
lurks around here sometimes, I believe, and I\'m sure could regale us with
tales of assorted inspirations.  But I find the character write-ups in CT
S4, "Citizens of the Imperium," to be instructive as to what the designers
were thinking.  Some Star Wars types are there, of course -- in that era,
they had to be! -- but there\'s a lot of E.C. Tubb, Keith Laumer, & Co. too.

Is there an easy way to search the TML archives?  We had a splendid thread
lo these many months ago about "period" and inspirational literature for
Traveller, from both before and after the game\'s publication.

I don\'t know if this has been mentioned before, but I for one would prefer to
see 2 pages of formulas rather than 18 pages of tables.  Maybe with some
samples so I know that I am computing things correctly.

This has two main advantages that I can see:

   1 - It cuts down on densely packed columns of digits, which must be
       proofreading-hell.

   2 - If the formulas are well thought out enough, then the ship design
       system automatically extends to any size you want!  Just because the
       table ends at 5000t doesn\'t mean you have to stop there...

This has the drawback that the T4 Starships book would be even thinner.

I will be deriving the formulas anyway with my trusty HP-48GX, mainly because
I like to know those things and I frankly don\'t trust the tables to be
error-free.

My dream is to have a 1 page starship design system...

I thought that I would define what I thought was Travelleresque art 
by giving examples from previous Traveller works.

By looking at these pictures, it should relay the impression I\'m 
talking about.

I thought the cover of the first editon of Traveller 2300 was 
Travelleresque as was much of the art in 2300.

I didn\'t think any of the art in TNE was Travelleresque.

I liked the art in the Alien Modules--especially the anatomical 
drawings and the Dietrick ships.

The ship and gas giant on the cover of the Spinward Marches Campaign 
are very, very, very Travelleresque.  The Battle Dress picture on pg. 
5 is also.

The ship on the cover of the Atlas of the Imperium is very Traveller.

Much of the art, vehicles, weapons, and ships in the Traveller Book 
are very Traveller.

The interior scenes of the Beowulf in the SOP are very Traveller.

The combat armor on the cover of the Rebellion Sourcebook is my 
favorite of this item.  Very Traveller.

The cover picture of Fighting Ships is cool!  Although the pictures 
of the ships inside are incredibly bad.

The art in V&V and S&A are very Traveller.

And, I could go on with this.

In sum, these are what I call examples of Traveller art.  There are 
many more.  I like the idea of T4 having more elaborate art (most of 
what I have picked are simple line drawings), but Foss does not seem 
to capture this Traveller feel.  

I agree with Joe.  The cover to Starships is very Traveller, and a 
lot of the interior pics are not.

William Hostman gave a good description of what I\'m trying to say 
with these pictures.

Jeff,

Althought we agree on your reasons for doing this, you may want to

From: That Computer Guy <darkstar@brahms.udel.edu>

: Regarding the SSDS (and the QSDS for that matter):
: 
: I don\'t know if this has been mentioned before, but I for one would prefer to
: see 2 pages of formulas rather than 18 pages of tables.  Maybe with some
: samples so I know that I am computing things correctly.

This was done in Fire, Fusion, & Steel.  I think only three or four of
us actually like it, the rest of the world found it cumbersome and
unwieldly.  The tables came about because they really are a more
digestable and easier way of designing ships.

: This has two main advantages that I can see:
: 
:    1 - It cuts down on densely packed columns of digits, which must be
:        proofreading-hell.

I think that SSDS was pretty well proofread by all of us, and thus it
should be okay.

:    2 - If the formulas are well thought out enough, then the ship design
:        system automatically extends to any size you want!  Just because the
:        table ends at 5000t doesn\'t mean you have to stop there...

The formulas are thought out enough.  The only problem is that all the
components are integrated to the 5000t limit.  You\'d probably be better
off purchasing a copy of FF&S and going through that.

: This has the drawback that the T4 Starships book would be even thinner.

Hahahahahahahahaha.

: I will be deriving the formulas anyway with my trusty HP-48GX, mainly because
: I like to know those things and I frankly don\'t trust the tables to be
: error-free.
: My dream is to have a 1 page starship design system...

One page?  Hmm, I guess that this page will be very light on
descriptions?

[very good examples deleted]

: I agree with Joe.  The cover to Starships is very Traveller, and a

I think that both the covers of T4 and Starships are very Traveller.
However, I must say that the more I look at Foss\'s pencil drawings of
the ships (but not the weapons), I must say that they are what I imagine
Mileu 0 to be like.  They are different and they fit in with what I see
as many of the sci-fi roots of Traveller.  But you know, the more I look
at the drawings, the more they grow on me.

That said, I will mention that hands down, bar none, Rob Caswell *is*
Traveller art.  Everything he did was simply beautiful and well laid
out.  And his equipment drawings were spectacular to boot!

All I can give you are the following refs:

1.      Digest #16. Includes subsector key, sector library data, adventure
on Irlaggur (Urlaqqash/Reavers Deep 2624), Irlaggur library data, Urlaqqash
subsector map, communication (ie. no xboats!) routes.

2.      Far Traveller #1. Includes sector library data, full
description/stats/maps/etc etc for Roakhoi (Ea 0404), Ea subsector map.

3.      Far Traveller #2. Includes more library data, full
description/stats/maps/etc etc for Rejhappur (Scotian Deep 0408), Scotian
Deep subsector map.

4.      High Passage #4. Includes full stats (Striker v1) on the Caledon
Highlander merc unit.

5.      Aslan Mercenary Ships. This boxed set is all about ships from the
Roaa (Uhtaa 0706) shipyards, plus the Teahleikhoi ("Soldiers of the Falling
Night") Aslan regiment. Through the descriptive text, adventure backgrounds,
etc, you can gather a lot of info about the political power games that occur
in this sector.

6.      Drexilthaar. Somewhere around are full stats for this subsector (a
"Pilot\'s Guide"). I *think* this is a separate module.

7.      The Traveller Chronicle #6, 7. A lot of info. The Aoreriyya region
(Ea, Drexilthaar, Eakoi, Drinsaar subsectors) at 1115, 1125-30,  1200. FULL
regional Library Data!! Gralyn Union data. Gralyn stats (Drinsaar/RD 1735).
Pilot\'s Guides to Caledon subsector (overview #6, info for every world  in #7).

In some ways, Reaver\'s Deep is more fleshed out than the Spinward Marches!
Thank the prolific Keith brothers who wrote nearly all of this stuff
(actually, can\'t think of anything they didn\'t write!).

...BTW, I created an MT deep trader (J-3) that I called the Scotian
Deep-class. Externally, it looks identical to the Subsidised Merchant...

...to Brian Borich - I was wrong. The last thing I\'ve seen from the Keiths
(J. Andrew) is the Caledon Pilot\'s Guide, in TTC#7 (1995).

Tired of getting raped by AOL, huh, Harold.  Me too.  I used to be 
with AOL, but that per hour crap is for the birds.

AOL has a nice set up, but at those prices, who needs it when you can 
get all the important stuff, with unlimited time, for $20 a month.

They remind me of Blockbuster.  Don\'t get me started on Blockbuster.

In this post...
1)  A TL12 4mm Imperial Marine Gauss Rifle
2)  Information is provided for both TNE based rules systems and 
     CT/MT/T4 based systems.  The weapon can be used for all types of 
    Traveller rules systems.


This is the gauss rifle that Frank Fornne mustered out with.  It 
should be considered the standard Imperial Marine slug thrower issued 
to all troops.

The weapon below was designed for a house rules system based on TNE.  
Since the creation of T4, the weapon has been modified for the T4 
rules.  

If you are using T4 rules, or my House Rules based on T4, you should 
disregard information that is not pertinent to those rules.  
Subsequently, this weapon sheet can be used for any Traveller rules 
system whether its TNE based or CT/MT/T4 based.  For T4, 
cross reference the range of the target with the type of ammo used.  
This will give you the difficulty to hit and the amount of damage the 
round does.  Other information on the sheet is needed for TNE rules 
systems.

DESCRIPTION

The ultimate development of the slug thrower, the gauss rifle
generates an electromagnetic field along the length of the barrel
which accelerates a 4mm, .5 gram needle bullet to velocities of 3740
meters per second.  The most popular round for the weapon is a HEAP
consisting of a dense armor piercing core surrounded by a softer metal
covering, ending in a hollow point, giving the explosive round both
high stopping power and a good armor piercing capability.  Flight
along the barrel is nearly frictionless, with spin stabilization
imparted through magnetic bias.

A 40 round magazine is attached, and each pull of the trigger fires
one, five, or ten rounds.  The firing setting may be changed during a
combat round at the cost of one action.  It also costs one action to
reload a new magazine.  

Standard equipment on the gauss rifle includes a battlefield sight
that incorporates both light amplification and passive IR, visual
magnification, and a laser range finder which may also be used as a
target painting device.    

Other items that are standard are integral gyrostabilization (the
range and recoil have already been adjusted), a RAM grenade adapter, a
bayonet lug, and a sling.  Power for the magnetic barrel is provided
by a disposable/rechargeable power pack included in each magazine.


Use the below chart to find the to hit difficulty based on range and 
type of round used.

Features											
Electronic Battlefield Sight:

	The electonic sight provides a +4 DM on targets at long and very 
long range when aim, bead, or snipe actions are used.  The sight also 
incorporates a laser range finder/sight that can be used to allow 
3 fire actions at the same target instead of the usual one when 
performing aim, bead, and snipe procedures.  The sight can be damaged 
or misaligned on a 11+ if dropped or otherwise roughed up.

The Grand Adventure Backstory Part IV:  The Rock 

by Kenneth D. Bearden



Frank Rock Fornne.  In later years his friends called him the Rock. 
Born in 1066.  His father was a military man.  Marine Corps all the
way.  He was a good soldier.  No.  His father was a great soldier. 
No.  He was a hell of a soldier.

His father worked his way up from grunt to receiving his commission. 
He earned the highest award available in any of the Imperial armed
forces, the Starburst for Extreme Heroism, and was granted a patent of
nobility .  This made him a knight, and when he was killed in 1068,
the title passed on to his first born son.  Frank Rock Fornne became
Sir Frank Rock Fornne at age 3.  

Frank grew up on Roup in the Regina subsector.  The planet is a water
world with close to a trillion people.  The population is squeezed
into floating and underwater cities.  Every decade or so, what little
land mass there is flooded from the oceans and new island appear.  The
seas are sometimes violent, and dry land is a commodity that has a
time value attached to it.  The people of Roup learned to capture food
and all of the necessities of life from the sea, but Roup has an
atmosphere with a chlorine taint.  This has had a debilitating effect
on the evolution of sea life on Roup, and the planet is characterized
by a chronic food shortage.  Although Roup lies along one of the major
trade and communication routes in the sector, the Traveller\'s Aid
Society has declared Roup an Amber Travel Zone because of the frequent
turbulence among the populace.

Fortune and nobility do not always go hand in hand, and Frank was the
epitome of that.  Don\'t get it wrong.  Frank\'s family was very well to
do on Roup, and he never wanted for food.  But he wasn\'t an heir to a
fortune like many of the other nobles.  

As Frank grew up, he had encounters with other nobles who looked down
upon him.  He was too common, they would tell him.  At first, this had
the intended effect of causing distress in Frank.  After a while,
though, he came to think that if being a noble meant being a snob,
then he would choose to be a commoner, and that is how he has lived
most of his life.  

Before he was two years old, Frank was stricken with the Corfu
disease.   Corfu is a planet in the Aramis subsector.  In 1067, about
5% of the population was stricken with virulent, crippling disease
that withers muscle tissue.  No cure for the disease is yet known, but
there has been some success in finding treatments to relieve some of
the disease\'s effects.  The Imperial Scout Service now maintains a
surveillance post in the system, and access to the planet is
controlled.  The TAS has declared the system a Red Zone, but this all
happened after the disease became wide spread.  

A merchant ship visited Corfu and purchased raw meat for speculative
trade with Roup.  Foodstuffs always garner a high price on Roup.  That
meat made its way to a planetary distributor which, in turn, sold it
to a market in Frank\'s home town and ended up on Frank\'s plate.  His
mother was effected as well, but his little brother, and sister were
fine.   Frank and his mother were two of the first people outside of
Corfu to be diagnosed with the disease.

Frank wasn\'t completely crippled by the disease, but for many years,
he was very weak and frail.  One note of interest to his doctors was
that even though his muscles were withered, Frank possessed a
fascinating amount of dexterity.  In fact, Frank was quicker and more
manual dexterous that any other child twice his age.  This was a good
sign, and there was hope.

When he was 18, Frank decided to be a marine like his father.  He
applied and was accepted at the Imperial Naval Academy.  This became
the worst year of his life.  He missed too much class because of his
disease.  He fell behind, and physically, he couldn\'t compete with the
other cadets.  He flunked out before the start of his sophomore year. 


But he was determined.  He went to enlist after a few months home back
on Roup.  They were not going to take him, but, being a nobel, the
Corps accepted his enlistment on the condition that he took a support
MOS.  Frank agreed, went to boot camp which was a struggle, and became
a combat electrician.  

Frank\'s first tour of duty included 6 mos. of basic training, 6 mos.
of MOS school, and 2 years garrison duty.  He was a behind the lines
kind of guy and no where near the type of gung ho soldier that his
father was.  "In the rear with the gear," he would always say, and he wanted 
to get out and prove himself, but the forces
that be saw his place behind the lines.  

So he appealed again to his CO.  After all, there were advantages to
being noble.  Frank just made sure that he wasn\'t a snob about it. 
During that fourth year, he landed duty as ship\'s troops.  He liked
it, and he re enlisted.

During his first tour, he earned three promotions in 4 years, and he
noticed something else.  His muscle tissue was becoming stronger.  His
body was healing, and the disease was retreating.  He reported this to
his unit medical officer, and they transferred him back to garrison
duty.  They wanted him available to study and conduct tests on.  The
military was very interested in the disease on Corfu.  Frank was the
first known case of actual disease recession, and they ordered him to
keep it secret.

Frank did as they asked.  He submitted to their tests, let them take
samples from his body, and acted the good soldier by keeping it all
quiet.  They rewarded him with another promotion and choice of
assignment.  He opted for cross training in artillery, spent another
year in additional artillery training, and finally saw action again in
a military policing action.

He re enlisted for his third term.  This time in artillery.  They gave
him another promotion and set him back on Aramis for garrison duty. 
He taught combat computers to new recruits and served in the garrison
for three more years.  He was beginning to think of changing his
middle name to \'Garrison\', but they had already started calling him
something else.  The Rock, because of his middle name.  He was a
hardened gunny and had spent several years on Aramis.  He had many
friends, and they all had nicknames.  He used to think that it was a
prerequisite for a military man to have a nickname.  And the one that
stuck with him was the Rock.  Yes, that\'s right.  Sgt. Rock.

He served as ship\'s troops again, received a promotion, and re
enlisted again.  He was a lifer.  His second year into his fourth term
he won the MCUF which was the highest honor he had ever received.  He
also reached the top of the enlisted grade scale.  E-9.  Sergeant
Major Rock Fornne.  

In 1099 he was approached by a civilian physician with Corfu\'s
disease.  The Dr. was a few years younger than Rock and had contracted
the disease when he was young.  The Dr. had been studying on Corfu
with the Imperial Medical Outreach Program and had read the case on
Rock\'s improvement.  The Dr., Too Pak Neimerani, and Rock kept in
touch over the next 6 years.  Rock liked him and respected the man\'s
dedication to his cause, and it wasn\'t long before he called Too his
friend.  

Rock had one more term before he was eligible for his pension.  He\'d
be 39 years old at the end of this tour, and he was looking forward to
retiring.  He re enlisted and spent much of the time in his position
as artillery sergeant on the base.  It just wasn\'t in the cards for
him to see a lot of action, and he guessed that it was good.  The few
times his unit was called up it meant that the situation could not be
controlled by only ground troops, and Rock had seen what a meson gun
could do to a target.  Yea, he was getting a little soft in his old
age, and he was used to life on the base.  

One of the pilots he knew stationed out of Aramis was Daeus Jacks. 
Daeus was an officer, but Rock didn\'t hold that against him because
Daeus, in Rock\'s estimation, was a stand up guy.  They had served
together a few times as ship\'s troops, and Rock had learned that all
of the candy strips on Daeus\' uniform were well earned.  

Rock was speaking one day with Daeus about what they were both going
to do at the end of the year.  They were both mustering out of the
service within a month of each other, and Daeus told him of his new
position as pilot aboard a merchant vessel.  They were still looking
to fill other positions and if Rock knew of anybody who might be
interested....

What the hell.  Rock had some experience with turret weapons, and the
ship needed a gunner.  This might be just the opportunity for a
retired gunny like himself.  And they were still looking for other
crew members.  

He sent a message via X-Boat to his old friend Too at Corfu Station.



Game Information:
Aramis, where Rock was stationed, is located in hex 3110 in the 
Spinward Marches.  The information about the disease on Corfu was 
extrapolated from the short reference in Marc Miller\'s Traveller 
Adventure.  Corfu is located in hex 2602--in the Aramis subsector of 
the Spinward Marches.  Roup is located in hex 2007, in the Regina 
subsector of the same sector, and all the information about the 
planet\'s food shortage is consistent with how Roup has been described 
in official Traveller supplements and adventures.

Yes, I agree. I should have been more precise. The POST-three-black-book
supplements and adventures, to me, evoked "Star Wars," but that could have
been because I went into "Traveller" with "Star Wars" in my High School
mind. Of course, there was planty of "Reteif" in there as well. :-)

I don\'t see as great a leap from late 60\'s and early 70\'s SF to "Star Wars"
(and hence to "Traveller") as I do with 50\'s SF. "Citizens" is - as you
state - a perfect example, with lots of stock SF heroes included. Didn\'t
one of the early JTASs have a competition to name the famous inclusions?

However, I still think the flavor of 40s and 50s SF differs profoundly from
that of the 60s and 70s, which became (after a typically hard-to-define
transitional period), "harder" and more realistic, and less Pulpy). So what
the Foss vehicles inspire to me is the feel of Pulp SF. There\'s a place in
the market for Pulp SF gaming, but for me, Traveller is not that place.
Whether it\'s Asimov\'s "Foundation," Niven\'s "Known Space" or "Star Wars,"
Traveller has - for me - always evoked post-Pulp SF.

        IIRC, James Blish\'s Cities In Flight is where TDX is to be found;
gravitationally focused or some such handwaving explosive that produced
thin horizontal disk-shaped explosions...

The answer to (b) is 3m x 3m x 6m, according to the equipment sheet on page
28 of MegaTraveller Journal #3.  This is a 4 tons disp. container.  I also
designed smaller and larger models, but DGP didn\'t publish those.

This won\'t work for QSDS, because the \'hull\' is actually a hull plus other
components - ie. there is not a linear relationship there.  (Rather like a
basket of groceries: you could establish a pattern but not a precise
formula.)

It may be possibly to calculate a formula for the hull by itself, but I
couldn\'t find one when I tried (when FF&S came out).

Not true, at least in real life and hard-SF games.  Any formula will have a
region in which it applies, and will be increasingly inaccurate outside that
region as factors that were negligable within the region begin to have an
effect.

Here is a list of the pictures of ships in Starships.  Answer yes or 
no if you think the pic is Travelleresque.

Let\'s get an idea of (A) what people think is Travelleresque, and (B) 
which of Foss\' art people think fits Traveller.

I\'ll start.

1) Cover pic:  Yes.  Acceptible for Traveller, but that ship, or 
whatever it is sure is long and borders on the non-Travelleresque.

2)  Rescue Ball:  Yes.  Yeah, I can accept that one.

3)  Launch:  No.  But, I could be persuaded on this one.

4)  Ship\'s Boat:  Yes.  I actually like this one.

5)  Slow Boat:  Yes.  It\'s OK.  I consider it on the border.

6)  Pinnace:  No.  Dumb looking.

7)  Slow Pinnace:  No.  Again, dumb looking.

8)  Modular Cutter:  Yes.  I can accept that one.

9)  Shuttle:  No.  Dumb, again.

10)  Gig:  No.  Absolutely not.  Crappy drawing.

11)  Scout/Courier:  No.  Hmm.  It\'s not so much that I don\'t like 
       the design, because I think it would be good for some type of science 
        or industrial use, but it is just not a scout looking ship.  If it\'s 
       function were more appropriate, then I may change my opinion to yes.

12)  Luxury Liner:  No.  If I were Lewis Roberts, I\'d be upset that 
        they drew my ship like that.

13)  Free Trader:  No.  Again, what a crappy design.

14)  Far Trader:  No.  Poor Joe Walsh.  I bet he cried when he saw 
        that his ship looked like a shoe.

15)  Secure Trader:  No.  If this was a Buck Rodgers game, then 
       maybe.

16)  Subdized Merchant:  No.  I expect to see 1930s sparks flying out 
        of the back of this one.  Flash Gordon all the way.

17)  Subdized Liner:  Yes.  It\'s OK.  I can accept it.

18)  Yacht:  No.  It\'s a 1955 T-Bird!

19)  Patrol Cruiser:  No.  This reminds me of third grade, when the 
        art teacher drew a line on a piece of paper, and you were supposed to 
        draw something from it.

20)  Mercenary Cruiser:  No.  I hope the mercs in that ship are real 
        bad asses, because as soon as they land, they\'re going to be laughed 
        off the planet.

21)  Laboratory Ship:  No.  What\'s the deal with the circular fins?

22)  Safari Ship:  No.  Looks like my radar detector.

23)  Corsair:  No.  Ever see The Spy Who Loved Me?

24)  Large Armed Freighter:  No.  If it wasn\'t so curvey, I\'d count 
       it as a yes.

25)  Military Landing Ship Infantry:  No.  I want to like it, but I 
        just can\'t.

26)  Military Frontier Cruiser:  No.  Just don\'t like it.

27)  Military Destroyer:  No.  Just don\'t like this one either.

28)  Light Fighter:  Yes.  Hey!  One I really like!

29)  Medium Fighter:  No.  Looks like the close up of the head of a 
        bug.

30)  Heavy Fighter:  No.  What\'s the deal with the smiley face 
         sticking its tongue out in the rear of the craft?

31)  Missile Bomber:  No.  This is the epitome of the 50\'s retro 
        style that Foss is being accused of by members of the TML.  Looks 
        like a soap box racer.

32)  Pg. 81 Foss Plate:  No.  What the heck is that?

33)  Pg. 82 Foss Plate:  No.  Is this D&D or Traveller?

34)  Pg.  83 Foss Plate:  Yes.  Yeah, cool!  It looks like one of my 
         campaigns.  I DO like this one!

35)  Pg. 84 Foss Plate:  No.  Get rid of it.

36)  Pg. 85 Foss Plate:  Yes.  Almost a no, but I can accept it.

37)  Pg. 86 Foss Plate:  No.  It looks more like a giant robot rather 
        than a mech.

38)  Pg. 87 Foss Plate:  No.  Reminds me of futuristic Jules Verne.

39)  Pg. 88 Foss Plate:  No.  If the ship looked like it would fly, I 
        would have said yes.

40)  Pg.  89 Foss Plate:  No.  If the ship were worth a damn, I would 
        have said that this is a cool picture of a ship coming out of jump 
        space.

41)  Pg.  90 Foss Plate:  No.  Is this a virtural reality test for 
        Imperial Marines?

42)  Pg.  91 Foss Plate:  No.  Like the idea, hate the ship.

43)  Pg.  92 Foss Plate:  No.  More crap.

45)  Back Cover:  Yes.  I like this one.

So, what are all of your opinions?

in the Starships book.

And you know what?  My Grand Adventure posts are just as good, if not 
more detailed, than Don Perrin\'s stuff.

What gets me is this.  I wrote the GA stuff for my players to do four 
things:  1) flesh out the events that happened during character 
generation;  2) tell the player a little about his character\'s 
homeworld;  3) show how the character came to be involved in the 
Grand Adventure and a member of the March Harrier crew;  and 4) lay 
down some hooks for adventures that I have planned down the road.

From reading Perrin\'s stuff, it looks like he did the exact same 
thing.  He rolled up a character and filled in the holes.  

Now, I\'m not saying this is a bad thing for a published Traveller 
supplement, but I was looking at the writing level of the stories.

My GA posts are one through first drafts.  I could do a lot more with 
them if I only put in the time (and it does take a lot of time to 
write those things).  Eventhough they were first drafts, they served 
my purpose, met my 4 goals, and were entertaining enough to read.  I 
thought, hey, they are as good as most of the other NPC character 
bios I\'ve seen in most RPGs.

I guess my point here is that, if I was going to publish the GA stuff 
in an official Traveller supplement like Starships, I\'d make damn 
sure that they were written well (meaning interesting and exciting) 
and that there were no problems with them.

For example, look at pg. 45 under Marine Captain Melissa Von Sarnoff.

	"Captain Von Sarnoff noticed a discrepancy in the fake ID\'s, and 
then infiltrated the band and capture them."

She infiltrated and capture?  Maybe this is not Don\'s fault.  It 
looks like an editing problem, so this is either Tony Lee\'s or Lester 
Smith\'s area.  But, Don should have written those bios more 
professionally.  He\'s got several short stories and books to his 
credit, doesn\'t he?

My point is that most of us could have written bios as good as what 
is in Starships.

Maybe I\'m wrong, but I expect professional writing.  I want to be 
entertained with this type of stuff.  I want to say, "Cool!  Did you 
read the one about...?"

Instead, I read and say, with a befuddled face, "Huh."

OK, I\'m done ripping Starships apart.  That\'s enough for me.

I whole-heartedly disagree.  Many professional magazines in the RPG
industry have this policy: "Pyramid Picks," which John Kovalic has already
mentioned, only reviews products, in their words, that make them think
"Gee, we wish we\'d done that!"  (T4 might be a borderline case here....)

The _reviews_ will be unbiased, and Jeff\'s already said that _constructive_
criticism is acceptable.  He just doesn\'t want to fill the site up with a
lot of bad press from old Traveller-grognards with more history to compare
products with than the prospective new Traveller player has.

(Sorry if I\'m putting words in your mouth here, Jeff!)

Courtney is the owner of Sweet Pea Entertainment (a film production 
company that has the film rights to AD&D and Traveller), and the owner of 
Imperium Games.

Just for completeness, I\'ll also mention that Authority Publishing & 
Design is the name of the company that includes all the designers we\'re 
familiar with - Tony Lee, Ashe Marler, etc. etc.  AP&D has the contract 
to design Traveller products for Imperium Games.

So, what does that give us?  A company that has the money to finance this 
project of producing the fourth edition of Traveller, but which is 
unfamiliar with the RPG market (Imperium Games); and a company that is 
familiar with the RPG market, but which only designs the products, 
leaving the sales and customer service to IG (AP&D).

It\'s a pretty good distribution of the varius functions necessary to 
bringing Traveller products to market.  In the last several months we saw 
that game designers don\'t necessarily do the business end of things real 
well - you may recall credit cards were charged months before products 
were shipped, etc. etc. etc.  And I\'m pretty sure that the average 
business person isn\'t a good game designer [grin].  AP&D just has to 
learn enough about business to make their designs more easily 
marketable, and IG has to learn enough about the RPG industry to allow 
them to understand what their customers want out of the game designs 
they\'re commissioning.

The person trying to stretch himself to bridge the gap between the two 
worlds is Tim Brown (of CT and 2300 AD fame, and who owns his own game 
company, Destination Games (producer of the Chaos Progentious 
collectible dice game, and the Pulp Dungeons series of generic adventure 
modules)).  He works for IG, overseeing Traveller product development by 
the AP&D crew.

And then there\'s us - the people on this list know more about Traveller 
than anyone in the world (and I can confidently say that because Marc 
Miller is a subscriber to the list![Grin]).  The folks at AP&D have 
brought us into the process in the past (Don Perrin asked us to do ship 
designs for Starships, and also had the wisdom to acknowledge that Guy 
Garnett, Dave Golden, and the rest of the QSDS/SSDS design teams knew how 
to make design systems that would make everyone happy), they\'re doing so 
now (the Rumors project), and will undoubtedly do so in the future.  Marc 
himself has asked for feedback several times - on the skills list for T4, 
on the vehicles list for T4, on the sector data for T4, and the outline for 
Milieu 0, among other things.  We have a place in the process, too.

We\'ve all been disappointed - to one degre or another - with the products 
and services we\'ve gotten from IG over the last several months.  But, 
they\'ve recognized those problems, and they\'ve been working consistently 
to change things.  AP&D is no longer responsible for doing 100 things at 
once - their sole tasks are product design and development now.  Sweet Pea 
is no longer sitting back just waiting for the money to roll in - 
they\'ve become Imperium Games, and they\'re running the business 
end (doing customer service, taking orders, shipping products, and so 
on).  

And, Courtney\'s trying to get some understanding of the industry he\'s 
involved in, as well as specifically what Traveller fans want.  I think 
we\'re helping there, too.

IG and AP&D are beginning to, as my business-jargon-prone co-workers are 
fond of saying, "do the right things right."  The coming months will 
bring additional changes, as each of the people involved becomes better 
at his or her new role, and become more attuned to customer needs.

Here\'s hoping 1997 is The Year of Traveler.

Running even a thin atmosphere through scoops at merely supersonic
velocities would yield respectable volumes. There\'s no need to go deep. Gas
giant refueling *is* hazardous, though.
Since the atomic composition of the universe is some 90% hydrogen, 10&
helium, and maybe 1% everything else, any sufficiently large body is likely
to be mostly hydrogen. Gas giants are almost by definition sufficiently
large.
Since hydrogen is the lightest of gases, the upper layers of a gas giant
atmosphere will be richer in hydrogen than the lower ones. The other gases
are most likely to include helium, neon, and the hydrogen saturated
compounds water, ammonia, and methane. 

> Of course, that\'s the problem... they\'re all mixed up.  I wonder if you

Separation of the hydrogen from all the other stuff is the problem.
You shouldn\'t worry about igniting the hydrogen: In a gas giant, you can
assume that all the oxygen that can combine with hydrogen already has.

Research in electronic analogues of neural networks was being done on Terra
at about TL-7. By TL-8, successful robots which duplicated the walking and
jumping motions of insects and spiders had been developed. These were
initially only curiosities. Specialized military vehicles based on these
designs were in use about TL-9, but their use declined as grav technology
was perfected.

Someone at GDW (Challenge No. 75) stated that the ship construction times
in TCS were far too short, and promised that as soon as they came up with a
system they liked better, they would publish it. Sigh...

It seems that the rate of ship production depends on the size of the
shipyard.  In the absence of better data, the economic model of TNE World
Tamer\'s Handbook suggests 1 to 2 MCr of starship per hundred line employees
per month, depending on TL. This does not include the rest of the company
staff nor any dependents.
I\'ve done a couple of estimates of rates of production of a few craft, and
I like the feel of the numbers I get.
I\'d need to guesstimate the percentage of a world\'s population devoted to
starship building and the cost of a 50,000 ton Imperial Cruiser to get a
number, but I\'d have a hard time believing any rate greater than about a
half dozen of those in a year.

sectors produced by Planet III software (which has changed it\'s name to

supported, but the designer, Jeff Davies, has made them available. There are
five sectors; Deneb, Diaspora, Old Expanses, Reft and the Spinward Marches.
These sectors also include EVERY ship published for TNE as well as few new
ones (like a 55-ton Jump Boat). These are available from:
        ftp.best.com/pub/jdavies

There is a web page telling about this at kttp://www.davtechsys.com/ftp.htm

BUT the ftp links don\'t work. so use the ftp site above.

I\'m sorry to see that Planet III has thrown in the towel on doing Traveller
software, as I was looking forward to their Traveller Shipyard program. But
now at least those still playing TNE and Brilliant Lances can get these sectors.

Foss is probably expensive for custom color work.  That\'s one likely
reason they\'re using his extensive collection of prior paperback covers: 
second-publishing rights are often quite low, and much more viable for
cash-short RPG companies.  (Steve Jackson Games used quite a bit of
recycled cover art for a while there).  So you might get what you want,
but it depends on IG being successful to build up the capital.

the kick in the rear I needed to post to my website a couple deckplans I 
made a few years ago.

One is of a Type A2 Far Trader, and the other is of a few Small Craft 
(Cutter, Ship\'s Boat, Launch). The plans bear more than a passing 
resemblance DGP\'s excellent deckplans. I made them from scratch to 
Snapshot scale (1":3m) Unlike the original T&G plans, the Far Trader is 
actually of a 200 ton size. (IIRC, the plan in T&G was 2x too big!)

The originals were created in Deneba Canvas verison 3.5.2. Though Canvas 
isn\'t normally my "main ax", at the time I found the ruler scales and 
other functions useful in the creation of deckplans. I have posted two 
versions of each deckplan: The Canvas version, stuffed, for those with 
Mac\'s and Canvas; and an Adobe Illustrator version, zipped, for those 
with PC\'s and Illustrator (or *ugh* CorelDraw, which can import .ai 
files). If you have Illustrator on the Mac, the zipped version is the one 
to get. (Stuffit handily unzips files)

If anyone on the list has Adobe Acrobat Distiller or whatever, to make a 
.pdf version of the plans, please contact me. That\'s probably the ideal 
solution for distribution of the plans, as Acrobat Reader is free and 
truly cross-platform.

Except possibly for your Atari, Joe! ;-)

Get them here: http://www.geocities.com/Area51/8275/traveller.html

Query: Am I in copyright trouble for distributing these things? I did 
make them from scratch, and they aren\'t *exactly* like published 
versions. Standard disclaimers apply.

After seeing this theme a couple of times, I\'ve arrived at the following

Sorry, david, but that makes it incompatable with that which uses 1.5m
grids for combat: CT, MT, Snapshot, AHL, and several other (non-traveller)
games. It\'s a game design consideration. 1.5m gridding allows 4 persons per
square in combat capability... 1m doesn\'t. 1m makes 2 per square but just
barely, also, 1/"=1.5m is roughly 15mm (Feet to eyes) minis just a wee tad
oversize; also a consideration when CT and MT were in use, and for those of
us switching back to CT/Mt/T4 hybridizations. (BTW, most everyone I\'ve
talked to is UNHAPPY with T4 as far as my local area traveller community.
I\'m still unsure.)

If you\'re gonna reduce to a common denominator, I\'d rather see 0.5 meter
grid with heavier lines at the 1.5m breaks... but that approach can lead to
reductio ad absurdium. (My b*stardizsed latin may not be acurate, but I
think it makes the point).

 I understand that there is a "Hell" in Pennsylvania.

 There used to be a "6" in Kentucky (yes, spelled exactly that
 way).

 There is also a "North Pole" in New York.

 "Hoople" can be found in southern North Dakota.

 "Tar Heel" is a well-known town in North Carolina.

 There is a "Chipping Norton" and a "Leighton Buzzard" to the
 north of London, England.

 One of the five towns that joined together to form Queens
 County, New York (part of New York City) is named "Flushing".

 New Jersey Transit has a station on its main rail line in the
 village of "Ho-Ho-Kus".

 Some of you might remember the early days of FASA, when it
 actually stood for something - "Freedonian Air and Space
 Administration".  "Freedonia" is a town in New York, west of
 Buffalo.  They have (or had) a highly renowned jazz ensemble.

 Shall I continue?

You all just should consider that books are sold to newcomers by first
impressions.  Books without arts probably will sit like a duck in a shop
and won\'t be moved.  Compare T4 to other current products (Feng Shui,
Castle Falkenstein, even the older Underground and many others).  They
have a lot of color and they have a lot of art... and that\'s basically
what you need on this stuffed market.  If nobody notices your product you
are dead pretty soon.

You really should look a little more.  Most rulebooks seem to cost $25
these days but are at least twice the size of Starships (I yt have to see
it and then write my own review): take a look at some recent $25 products:
Deadlands ($25, 224 pages, great art and good editing), Bloodlands ($25,
240 pages, overall ok art and ok editing), Immortal ($25, 296 pages [!],
lots of colors [although IMHO ugly]), Conspiracy X ($25, 224 pages), ...

The average price for a 100-128 pages supplement these days seems to be in
the range of about $15 (take a look at Earthdawn stuff e.g.).

IMHO the T4 rulebook already was a little overprized (I heard something
about the price being raised to $30 for the softcover -- is that true?),
but demanding $20 for 100 pages book is pretty much a very bad joke.  If
this prizing policy continues I\'m pretty soon gone (I promised I\'ll give
them another chance but they better should do something good very soon).

There are many companies out there who know how to produce a good-sized
book with art and color stuff for a decent product.  IG should learn
quickly from them.

I imagine Marc could answer this better than anyone, but my guess would 
be that, as long as you aren\'t making money from them, and as long as 
they are your original works, and as long as you note the usual stuff 
("Traveller is a registered trademark of Far Future Enterprises." and 
whatever else people have been asked to put on their web sites), it 
should be fine.

Marc?  Any additional comments?

According to the \'story,\' Deneb and Vland had their own fish to fry, and 
were unable (or unwilling, perhaps, in Vland\'s case) to commit sufficient 
forces in time to prevent the closing of Corridor.

One resource you keep using, which I lack, is Trillion Credit Squadron.  
I have no inkling of the assumptions used therein regarding the defense 
forces that a given world can afford.  I can only offer statements as 
"seems like" and "probable" as weak refutations of the arguments you\'ve 
put forward regarding the defense forces of some of the high population, 
high tech worlds in Corridor Sector.  I have some TNE resources which 
detail the amount of personnel and economic output a given world (or 
nation) can commit to their military, but they\'re not handy.

Given the chaotic nature of Vargr society I, too, have some trouble with 
this scenario.  What further galled me were some of the larger ship 
designs provided in MT material.  It\'s difficult for me to imagine enough 
Vargr collaborating long enough to construct a TL-14 20,000-ton cruiser, 
much less crew one.

However, on the question of Vargr \'superpowers,\' the relevant MT 
resources which describe the Corridor invasion mention just these 
entities.  Apparently, the perceived weakness on the part of Imperial 
forces, combined with the unifying effect (however transient) of the 
Oekhsos tirades and the emergence of several powerful Vargr leaders led 
to a coalition of Vargr nations and corsair bands that was able to take 
Corridor.  Some incompetence and poor leadership on the Imperial side 
also made this feat possible, according to the \'official\' history.  Of 
course, with Corridor taken, this coalition was already beginning to 
erode, with clear divisions emerging on the issue of dividing the spoils.

The \'official history,\' which you dismiss in favor of TCS, makes no 
mention of any of "Trillion Credit Squadron"\'s assumptions, oddly enough.

Psionic Supervargr?  Perhaps you mean the Roth Thokken?  Of course, 
they\'re sorta diminutive, kinda like Brain Chihuahuas or something...

Liz is a great artist.. and she\'s joined at the hip with Mike Stackpole, who
has written the backstory for BattleTech for almost 15 years now.  If you
haven\'t read the "Warrior" Trilogy, find it now.  You will *never* be able

Be nice if he wrote some Traveller stuff....

   I recall reading somewhere that back in the early 70s the US Army was
seriously looking at a six-legged utility transport vehicle.  I think
the program was dropped because of the maintenance issues involved.

   I\'ll post my combat walker design for FF&S within the next few days.

Kenneth, I was extremely disappointed by your post.  It seems to me just
the sort of ill-thought-out negative nattering that has plagued the
mailing list all too much of late.  In place of actively trying to help
define this bugaboo of "Travelleresque" art, it just stoops to low attacks
without making any attempt, most of the time, at explaining your evident
dislike.  Thus it comes across as simple petulant whinging. 

I thought about two of your comments were useful:

> 11)  Scout/Courier:  No.  Hmm.  It\'s not so much that I don\'t like the

I rather like the Scout picture, aside from the sillouhettes marking it as
utterly the wrong size for a 100-ton craft and the fact that it doesn\'t
look much like the deckplan (unless you try _real_ hard....).  If you\'d
bothered to say what a "scout-looking ship" would be like, your post might
have been more useful yet.

Anyone swimming this far through your scrofulous prose might guess from
your second lucid comment that you don\'t like "curvey" ships.  Except
your positive comments, equally sparse in detail, don\'t seem to bear this
out: fully half the ships you approve of also seem to be "curvey".  So
what\'s a poor, misguided art director, if he bothers to collate and
cross-reference it like this, going to do?

Then we get to the really useless part of the "comparison."  Evidently you
got bored with simple negatives, but instead of trying to explain yourself
just went searching for fresher and longer invective.  I usually hear
better from the middle-school students in the local game store.

Is there any useful content whatsoever in the above mishmash?  I don\'t
think so, and I doubt most IG staffers would bother to read past the first
two or three lines.  To the probably relief of many a digest-reader, I\'m
not even going to touch the similarly content-free puffery about the color
plates.  (Besides, I don\'t care for many of them either... thoughts on WHY
below :-)

And now, at the risk of being hoist by my own petard, I\'d better toss in
my own two metaphor-mixing cents.

The more I look at the Foss art, the more it grows on me: not as the
be-all and end-all of Traveller (I, too, was a great fan of many of the
DGP publications\' "look"), but as a good try at a different look for
Milieu 0.  If the designs look "old-fashioned..." maybe that\'s what the
designers were _trying_ for, to provoke the right image in all we die-hard
fans brought up on the Spinward Marches in 1100-1200!

One thing that bugs me about the Foss line-art, especially, is the large
number of puzzing openings on the ship\'s hulls.  "Okay, they\'re fuel
scoops," I thought at first... but there are a hell of a lot of them, and
they often show up on the sides of vessels as well as the front.  Pop
turrets?  Didn\'t think so.  They\'re evidently Foss\'s way of trying to give
more "texture" to his drawings without having to specify any of the
technology with hatches, valves, pipes, etc.  And I don\'t care for art
which evades the technology rather than displaying it: that, to me, seems
"un-Travelleresque."

Rocket engine placement is another big bugaboo.  Look at the Shuttle on p. 
20.  (Why, by the way, does the text refer to it as being "the smallest
effective space-worthy vessel [before TL12]," when the preceding twelve
pages have been devoted to just such ships?  Bad editing -- I suspect they
mean the smallest ship to be able to operate beyond contra-grav\'s natural
limits).  Sorry -- back to rocket cones.  The two largest engines are the
furthest from the apparent center of gravity/mass of the vessel!  Again, I
suspect Foss put them there to give "balance" to the large plane of the
wing surface (is that a hypersonic waverider wing?  If so, cool.  But
probably not....). 

In short, Foss seems to love the art more than the technology.  Obviously,
you can have really boring art which emphasizes the technology while
totally ignoring artistic considerations.  I think the genius of classic
"Travelleresque" art is to _balance_ the two.  Objects are handsomely and
actively displayed, but they also look like they work and are designed
with an eye to utility, not just presentation and appeal to book-browsers.

Why the elevated bridge on the Far Trader?  Why the elegant wasp-waist on
the once-stodgy standard subsidized merchant, forcing irregularities in its
cargo bay?  Indeed, as many have said, why the furled wings on the lab
ship?  Don Perrin fell down on the job, certainly, by totally neglecting
"flavor text" for the ships -- again, on the "Travelleresque" front, ships
are not just gadgets, they are _homes_, constant companions, even, in many
a campaign, _characters_ in their own right, balking or succeeding in
hindrance or help of their crew.

So, to me, for Traveller\'s art as well as its text, to be "Travelleresque" 
it must be both technical/pragmatic/practical AND humanistic/stirring/
adventurous.  Foss errs to much to the latter, Perrin to the former.  And
that\'s why we all feel such a crying dissonance in the appearance and
"feel" of the new Traveller.  The happy medium is a hard row to hoe, but
that\'s where True Traveller has always lain.

> So, what are all of your opinions?

If opinions are what we saw above, let\'s have FEWER of them.  If we\'re all
to be of the opinion that "art is what I like", then we can table this
discussion along with feudal technocracies and near-luminal lifeboats: 
it\'s all heat and no light.  But if posters are willing to put some
thought and reasoning into what they write, maybe we can actually give
some positive and useful advice to IG -- which was, after all, what the
whole thread was _supposed_ to be about in the first place.

No it wasn\'t.  Sure there might have been 2 pages of formulas, but they
were spread out across 100 pages in a more or less haphazard pattern.  If
the formulas had been grouped together in a logical way I might have liked
them better.

Ok, I *could* have spent the time to gather up all the formulas and lay
them out myself, but I didn\'t. <g>

There will eventually be the _Naval_Architect\'s_Handbook_ for T4 (or
whatever name they end up with).  Work on that is occuring, sporatically,
over on the Beta-List.

Liz is a great artist.. and she\'s joined at the hip with Mike

I did not know Liz did the art, but as far as Stackpole goes it would 
be nice if he could right for T4.  I have enjoyed everything he has 
written, espically the Warrior Trilogy.  I think he could add lots of 
live to the game.

Oh I got my Starships from my UFLGS today.  Dont have much to say 
that has not already been beaten  into the ground.  Though it does make 
 great reference for all the complaints. 

I think we should give IG some more time with their products.  They 
are not MS or GDW  its going to take time.  If it was easy to write 
rules for a new T4 and put them out we all would have done it ourselves,
 but its not.  On top of that they have had to find things like printing and 
shipping companies and Lawers which is an on goeing process for a new 
company.This takes time, money and wares people down., cause long weeks
 with no sleep. The best we can do is encourage them and even buy their products
 we don\'t like, to keep their doors open, because we know Marc, IG, and
 Sweetpea can do this if given  more then what 9 months  total 5 since T4
 came out.

Lets move on.  I have talked to JoeW  about more background material for T4 so 
we can tear that apart and not the same old stuff.  I like Tony Lee 
asking for rumors this will help start the new T4  background era, 
and gives us the players a chance to give input.  Kenneth has the 
right idea too lets help each other and IG out with new ideas.

\'Fraid so, Joe. Just like I\'m (apparently) the only person who thinks Donna

But then, I only went to art school for several years and have worked as a
commercial illustrator, so what do I know about art? :)

Would it have been too difficult for the authors to draw at least deckplan
that seems to match the configuration of one of Foss\'s ships? I haven\'t yet
seen Starships, but surely they can\'t all be illustrations of zillion-ton
freighters with claw-hooks and cranes?

I\'m a Foss admirer, I must admit. I used to actually carry the book _20th
Century Foss_ to my games club - for ship design inspiration, and to
*illustrate* Traveller adventures ("Your Scout Courier is being hailed by a
megaton cargo hauler that looks like....this!") Yep, I\'m probably the only
person on the list who thinks that Traveller ships should look *more like
Foss illos*, not the other way around!

Well, okay, clearly some of his images are wrong for the game, usually
because they\'re too crazy. One of the things I\'ve always liked about his
work is its sense of humour; many of his designs are clearly absurd -
impossibly huge, layered with ridiculous details, often appearing to serve
no sensible purpose. That\'s part of the fun; you stare at something like
that finned monorail thing in T4 and wonder, "What the hell is *that*?"

BTW, I love Joe\'s idea for the "Explain the Foss Art" contest. I was going
to suggest something along the same lines to the list, but more as an
exercise than a contest: consider each illustration as a challenge to your
imagination, in the tradition of Seemingly Impossible UWPs, and try to come
up with a Travellereque \'explanation\'.

Let\'s consider, for instance, the color plate on page 54 of T4: a typical
Foss scene, illustrating a patently absurd \'Islands in the Sky\' motif.
Those big floating rocks are definitely not free-floating belt asteroids.
They\'re far too close together, they bear structures that rise only on one
side, all of them sharing the same up-down orientation! And the farthest
rocks are disappearing into the haze of distance - an effect known as
\'aerial perspective\'; it\'s caused by nitrogen in the atmosphere (think of
the way hills become more pale and blue with distance). Foss uses aerial
perspective in most of his space paintings, though of course he knows
there\'s no air in space; it\'s a familiar way of providing a sense of great
scale and distance (something he\'s really good at).

But if we take this painting literally (more literally than Foss himself
would), we might guess that these asteroid installations are floating in
the atmosphere of a planet - indeed they\'re designed to do so. Heavy duty
contragrav lifters are keeping them up. I think they\'re some sort of gas
giant atmosphere refineries, down-market cousins to the \'Cloud City\' of
Bespin in _The Empire Strikes Back_. The asteroid rock provides cheap
radiation shielding, not to mention cheap armor; clearly defensibility was
an issue in their design. Perhaps the operators are enforcing their
monopoly on gas giant skimming against potentially well-armed opponants
(rival refining companies? Pirate skimmers? Invading fleets?)...

Sounds pretty damned "Travelleresque" to me.

I agree that Foss was the wrong guy to do the equipment and small vehicle
drawings, or indeed to illustrate existing ship designs. Maybe those
assignments should\'ve gone to Elmore: notice the relative realism and
restraint of the guns in his combat drawing on page 22.

Elmore\'s problem is that he clearly lacks a science-fictional imagination.
Though the figures and technique are very professional, everything in his
drawings is boring and mundane, from the compositions to the clothes. Even
his \'alien\' looks like someone I might\'ve gone to high school with. On page
114 there\'s a guy wearing what looks like *prescription glasses*  - in a
Tech 12 society??

But I do applaud Elmore and IG for eschewing the mindless and sexist
cliches of SF rpg illustration. These drawings communicate a little story
that encapsulates the essence of a typical Traveller adventure. But all
together they don\'t provide even a fraction of the mind-stretching
inspiration of one of the better Chris Foss paintings.

I\'m not counting the small B&W ship illos, though. Those suck, as everyone
has pointed out already. If I\'d been art directing T4, I\'d have sent them
back to be re-drawn. I know Foss can do very good, hard-edged technical
illos: check out the _Alien_ preproduction work in _21st Century Foss_ (if
anyone out there has a copy). There are some stunningly detailed  concept
sketches of the Nostromo, and very clear line drawings intended to direct
the model builders. Too bad the T4 and Starships illos don\'t look like
that. (Mind you, I have no doubt that Ridley Scott was paying Foss much
more than IG ever could....)

Consider this my vote *for* the color plates - but some attempt should be
made to integrate the content of the art with the content of the books.

    'body' => 'My first and only comments on the subject of Chris Foss art:

   I own a book entitled "Space Wars: Worlds and Weapons".  I bought it
during the Middle Ages (known to some as the early 1980s).  It is
copyrighted with the date 1979, and features art by a number of artists,
including Chris Foss.  In fact, he wrote the Foreward for the book. 
There is a description of his art on page 31 which I think is of
interest:

   "It\'s hard, though, to look at a Chris Foss space ship and see a
symbol of anything.  Jagged, deformed, weird, suspiciously reminiscent
of items of household furniture, they stand apart in sf art as probably
being far more practically realistic than any streamlined stellar
crusier, too big to cope with gravity, and yet still fashioned with
aerodynamic precision, presumably ready to cope with those gusty solar
winds.  Foss has made an artform of the hideous; he has painted a sense
of wonder from the epileptic combination of bits and panels and frames
and pipes.  It is really difficult to choose between his totally
individual vision of the fantastic future of hardware and, say, Chris
Moore\'s precision paintings of Pan Am space craft approaching the
towering, stratospheric navigation buildings of his future space port."

   In other words, Foss has his own particular style.

   Presumably, the people responsible for recruiting him to do art knew
that what they were getting was not going to be in a style that was
anything like previously published Traveller material, and that much of
what they were getting was going to be recycled stuff he had previously
published elsewhere.  Frankly, IG/Sweetpea Entertainment probably
couldn\'t have afforded the price for Foss originial color illustrations
anyway.  You could question the wisdom of bringing in an artist with
such a unique style into a situation where there was already an
established style (one that is pretty dissimilar), but then we don\'t
write the checks.

   If I ran the circus....

   I would have went to Marvel Comics, or one of the smaller comics
houses, and recruited one of their younger artists to do some stuff for
me on a freelance basis.  Ideally, this person would be able to draw
stuff that at least comes close to the "Official Traveller Style" while
adding his or her own special flare to it.  When the 16-24 year old
crowd sees Traveller "featuring the art of Sam Smith" (or whatever) of
Malibu Comics, who has worked on X-Men, etc. and they recognize his
style, you\'ve just made a sale, even if the kid buying it is only
vaguely interested in playing the game itself.

   The art in T4 is for the most part well executed and thought
provoking.  It also bears little resemblance to the "Official Traveller
Style", and has little appeal to anyone under the age of 30 (no knock on
Chris, but let\'s face it, he was a cutting edge illustrator in 1979--he
is no longer cutting edge in 1996).  While this in and of itself will
not cause the 16-24 year old crowd to be discouraged from buying
Traveller, it won\'t convince them to buy it either.  For T4 to be
successful and increase its base of support, it has to have greater
appeal to that demographic.  You do that, in part, by featuring cutting
edge art.  While it may be too late now to change the artistic style of
T4, it is something that should be given some consideration,
nevertheless.

Harold

I think that you are missing the point of what I was trying to do, 
and that was to simply give my opinion on what ships pictured in the 
Starships supplement were Travelleresque.

And, I wanted to compare my thoughts with everyone else\'s to see if 
we all have a consensus on what is Travelleresque.

Joe got me to thinking about this when I read his list of things that 
the Traveller fans want.  It is hard to describe what is and is not 
Travelleresque, and there have been so many flames on Foss\' art.  My 
intention with the post was to actually go through the pictures in 
Starships and get TML reactions for IG eyes to see.

This would tell them what most of us think Travelleresque is.

My ramblings on the specific ships were just that--ramblings about 
why I liked or disliked something.  It should have given you a little 
more insight into why I did or did not like something (I originally 
was just going to indicate what I thought was or was not 
Travelleresque).

Since I have inevitably been the GM in my gaming groups over the last
ten-plus years, NPC-writing is a campaign-long exercise for me. The only
game-system with which I\'m familiar that seems to produce _excellent_ NPC
writeups is probably the White Wolf/World Of Dorkness system.

With respect to relating the character to game background, you are probably
right, but in the broader sense,  NPC writing is an art independant of game
systems. It is more an authorial/storytelling skill than one gained through
familiarity with a game system.


  For example, take the Starships product.

As Benny Youngman might say if he were a TMLler: Take the Starships product

TCS defines the yearly Naval budget of a world as Cr500 x Pop * 
GovMult, with the GovMult ranging from 0.5 to 1.5.  10 times this 
amount is how much you can spend on your initial fleet (based on 
maintenence being 10% of the ship\'s cost per year).

I feel the numbers are more applicable to independant worlds, rather 
than to the peacetime Imperium.  Member worlds leave the bulk of 
navel defense to the Imperium, which doesn\'t spend nearly as much TCS 
suggests.  The Domain of Deneb has (very roughly) 3-5000 ships in 
it\'s 34 regular fleets, perhaps a similar number in the reserve 
fleets.

0.5m works for me. (I\'m not too picky - Really. :-)

I like the idea of making some lines heavier than others, but I
wonder which lines should be heavier. Every second line (1.0m), every
third line (1.5m), or every fourth line (2.0m)?

A nuclear damper is normally set up to increase the stability of the 
nuclei in its area of effect, stopping, for example, nuclear 
warheads from going off. You could thus render the material safe by 
keeping it permanently in a damper field, but this would be 
impractical in the long run. A better solution would be to use the 
ability to tinker with radioisotope half lives to speed up the decay 
and emission of radiation. This would let an area be decontaminated 
within a short period of time. As I see it, decontamination would 
consist of the following steps

1/ Vehicles with nuclear decay inhibitors would move into the 
contaminated area, and would deploy a second set of nuclear reaction 
accelerators.
2/ The deployment vehicle would withdraw to a safe distance.
3/ The deployed dampers would be activated. Temporarily the 
contaminated area would become intensely radioactive, releasing 
a large quantity of energy.
4/ During decontamination the progress of the reaction would need to 
be carefully monitored. If an area was sufficiently contaminated, 
then there would be a danger of the reaction running away and causing 
an explosion. There would be trade-offs to be made between the safety 
of taking it more slowly, and the cost of hiring the equipment for 
longer.

This presents a number of possibilities to throw the players off 
guard.
- - One of the dampers could be damaged by the radiation and stop 
responding to outside control signals, threatening a detonation.
- - A nearby village is sufficiently far from the radioactive area to 
be safe normally, but the increased emissions during decontamination 
threaten the health of the villagers. The players would have to 
negotiate an evacuation.
- - The radiation emitted from the area far more intense than expected, 
as beneath the surface is an old crashed battleship from the 
Terran-Vilani conflicts, containing a large number of nuclear 
warheads which are in danger of being detonated. 

All this depends on the level of contamination, and assumes that the 
area has some fairly high level waste. 

There was a big feature on radiation in Travellers\' Digest 15, and a 
brief summary of the treatments presented is:
TL8- Treatment of symptoms only
TL9  - Anarad - a drug which combines with ionized atoms and removes 
them from the body.
TL 11 - Retrorad - a virus which repairs cell damage/mutation. Fairly 
slow acting so cannot handle fatal exposure levels. Must be prepared 
by medical personnel specifically for each patient. Preparation takes 
6-36 hours, which may be too long to be helpful. Must be administered 
soon after exposure.
TL 12 - Fast retrorad - Faster acting version of the above, faster to 
prepare as well (6-36 minutes). Can cope with otherwise fatal 
exposure.
TL 14 - Retrorad shield - As above, but remains dormant until needed. 
May prevent radiation sickness entirely, but expensive and needs 
weekly renewal. 

As always, feel free to find the gaping flaws in any of the above...

No you are not the only one.  I have always thought that Donna Barr was 
a great illustrator.  Her drawings were among my favorites among CT 
illustrations.  Her drawings of people always seem to tell you that 
there is a personality behind the picture & her drawings of Naval 
personnel are especially good.  IMHO Donna Barr\'s spot illustrations are 
more usefull than some other artists full page illos.  If she is not too 
busy with her comic books (insert shameless plug here) I\'d love to see 
her work in Traveller again.

	One of the things that a good RPG needs to do (and which 
Traveller has always  done well) is to let the players know that the 
charecter & personality of the charecter is important.  Traveller is 
about people interacting, the technology just controls what people 
(& aliens)_can_do & not what they _do_do.  This is why a good drawing of 
people is better than a good drawing of a ship.  The charecter is the 
important aspect.  Don\'t get me wrong I am a gearhead too & I\'ve spent 
many hours designing ships, but you are not roleplaying the SHIP you are 
roleplaying the Charecter.  I like some of the Foss Art but don\'t like 
most of it. I have been staying out of that discussion because I do not 
think the ships are as important as the people.
	Remember this list is about a game called Traveller not about a 
game called Starship...

I expect to be playing it in 3 of 4 years, we will all find out the 
answer then.
	I realize that taking away this argument will leave a hole in 
the list so I would like to propose a NEW subject to argue about.
	Why did the Aslan cross the Great Rift to find new land in the 
first place when there is lots of unclaimed land to the Rimward & 
SpinwardRimward portions of the Hierate?  If you look at the map of 
Aslan Spacein Solomani & Aslan (pg 50) you will notice that while a good 
portion of the nearby Sectors are Aslan Colonies most of this land is 
unclaimed by a government.  We do not know how many Aslan live there but 
we can assume that these Aslan are weaker than the Third Imperium (if 
they were stronger than the Imperium we would have heard about it).  
Therefore why didn\'t the ihatei go there instead of crossing the Rift. 
It was not easy or cheap for the Aslan to crosss the rift so why did 
they bother?  Please do not answer honor as Aslan honor is a cultural 
construct but desire for land is a genetic imperative & is therefore 
more fundamental.
I would like to throw this question out for comment.

Sorry Allen, I don\'t agree with you here.  I\'m not going to flame ya, 
but I do thing it is important the we communicate what we like and 
what we don\'t like as far as Traveller goes.  Art and the Traveller 
look is one of these.

You said that maybe the people\'s expectations who don\'t like the art 
are incorrect.  How can that be?  We are consumers, and as consumers 
we buy what we want and like.  I think communicating what kind of art 
we like for Traveller is just as important as discussing the latest 
rule controversy or change in technical thoughts (like the change in 
T-plate function).

We have to communicate what we want T4 to be!  Many people do not 
like the Foss art.  Communicating this is important.

I thought by showing IG what Foss pieces we like and what we don\'t 
like would be valuable.  "Hey, this is the type of stuff the fans 
want to see."

I don\'t necessarily need the art to look exactly like the Traveller 
of 20 years ago, but I do know what I consider Traveller art and what 
I consider non-Traveller art.  Joe Walsh made a good point in one of 
his posts.  IG may not know what good Traveller art is.

It is our job to tell them what we like.  If we don\'t, we\'ll keep 
getting the stuff that we don\'t like.

others).  I\'d like to take another stab at it, now that I\'ve had some 
time to really go through it - I want to try to be a bit more rational 
about the whole thing than I was in my first reaction.

I can live with the color plates.  It\'s no big deal to me, really.  They 
should have been placed in a less inconvenient place in the book, though.

I can also live with the B&W illustrations of the ships.  Some make me 
think, "Huh?" but I guess that isn\'t necessarily a bad thing.  I have to 
face facts: I\'m a pretty darned conservative person, and my ties are 
solidly to CT.  But I\'m not the average RPG consumer out there, so what 
do I know?  Maybe it\'s a good thing that the new art gets people 
thinking.

Finally, I can live with deckplans that have no gridlines.  I can add 
those on relatively easy.  Or, I can pull out a ruler.  Whatever.  Easy 
fix. 

Really, all that stuff should be of negligable concern.  There are bigger 
problems with the book.

The big problem with the deckplans is that things are mislabeled (anyone 
else notice there are no power plants??  I think they mean power plant 
when they say "engine" - but not all ships have "engines"!  And some 
jump-capable ships have no jump drives - the corsair for instance.), many 
areas are not labeled at all, and the plans don\'t conform to the design 
specifications.  2m by 2m staterooms?

Those are the real problems with the deckplans, IMO.  

There are also some real problems with the text.  Of course, it\'s not 
edited very well.  But there\'s a more serious problem: there\'s not much 
text in the book. 

The text /is/ the RPG.  One could certainly create an RPG solely using 
text.  One could not create an RPG solely using art.  An RPG supplement 
that is 75% art is rather a waste of paper as an RPG.  As something to 
keep on your coffee table as a conversation piece, maybe it\'s not so much 
of a waste. ;)

I believe the things we need to emphasize to IG and AP&D at this point are:

1) Editing (Including consistency - T-plates at TL 11 in one place, TL 12
            in another, etc.)
2) Add more text - 25% art and 75% text should be standard; 50/50 for books
   like Starships that have deckplans or other useful illustrations.
3) Make the illustrations (deck plans, weapon illustrations, etc.) conform
   to the descriptions of the items in the text.

Once they get those areas under control, we can decide whether to move on 
to the other issues.

That\'s my current thinking on the subject, anyway.

Traveller (Traveller 4th Edition; in this review it will be referred

changed nothing so you get my first-hand impressions.

Some facts about me, the reviewer, beforehand: in 1982 or 1983 I
played in a couple of Classic Traveller sessions, but the campaign
died due to a variety of reasons.  Since then I remember Traveller
fondly and always wanted to start a campaign of my own.  My first
attempt to do this was with Traveller: The New Era, but since I hated
both the background and the rules I nuked this idea.  Now T4 provides
another chance to go for it and I\'m still very excited about it.

First of all I\'ll summarize my general impressions (part 1) and
afterwards you\'ll be able to see my detailed comments and rants (part
2).  A summary concludes my review (part 3).


- ---- PART 1: General Impression

LAYOUT: The bad thing about the layout is: it\'s bland and boring.  It
looks as if it were done by someone who knows how to use \'Word for
Windows\' but that\'s it.  The (good?) thing about the layout is: it\'s
bland and boring.  There are no ugly backgrounds to distract the
reader, the information is presented in a pretty straightforward way
and there are no disorganized sidebars, etc.  There is no index but a
book with this little contents probably doesn\'t need one.  The colored
artwork (for comments about its quality see the next section) sadly is
scattered in a very stupid way in this book.  *All* the plates are placed
in the middle of the table section used for creating new starships,
where it\'s of absolutely no use and even disturbs the ship design
process.  It appears to have been randomly inserted in that place, as
if nobody ever considered whether the artwork has some meaning and
where it could be put to better use.
	Then there are the deckplans for the ships.  The initial
comments on the Traveller mailing list already made me expect ugly
deckplans, but they are even worse than I ever would have believed to
be possible in a professional company.  They were obviously drawn with
some kind of primitive graphics software, they are extremely ugly, they
don\'t show *any* details, there are no grids on them and there is no
description for ships interior except a couple of words like \'Fuel\',
\'Cargo\', ...
	The organization of the book is a little strange, too.  On
page 5 e.g. the imperial calender is displayed, then you turn to page
6 and *blam*: you see a rescue ball and the ship data?  Where\'s the
start of that section?  Where are the introductory words?  Where\'s the
organization?
	Another main problem is that the individual descriptions for
ships (as far as you can call them \'descriptions\') take up by far too
much space.  A description plus picture took up one-fourth of a page
in the basic rules; now they take up one page alone (without adding
*any* information).  Half a page would have been enough for so little
information.
	The tables for the ship design process (there are 18 pages of
tables shock-full with numbers) are placed at the end of the ship
design instructions (which is basically a good idea in order to not
interrupt the design instructions), but sadly there are *no*
references between the individual design steps and the tables involved
(or the pages where to find them), so that you basically have to
search a lot.
	Finally the page numbers again show up at the bottom center of
a page which makes it somewhat difficult to find a page if you flip
through the book.  Also the layouter should consider to use a smaller
typeface for variable indices since currently the usage of the same
typeface size for the index as for the variable itself destroys the
line layout.
	Rating: 5 out of 10 (-0.5 for the badly placed page numbers;
- -2 for basically useless and very ugly deckplans for the ships; -1.5 for
wasting a lot of space in the ship presentation; -0.5 for misplacing
the artwork; -0.5 for a general lack of organization).

ARTWORK: The artwork is done by Chris Foss.  The front art looks good
although I would have expected a picture more clearly concentrating on
a starship and not on a planetary surface scene *with* a starship (or
something like that; it looks a little like a mechanized sandworm from
Dune).  Personally I\'d have preferred if the picture from the back of
this book had been used as the cover art since it fits the topic a lot
more.
	The interior art consists of B/W illustrations for the various
ready-to-run starships and some color plates in the back of the book.  The
B/W artwork is not bad but it\'s not good either.  The ship art generally
lacks some detail and is too close in colors to the background so that it
is not really well recognizable.  Also several of the illustrations fail
to convey a hard SF feeling but rather look as if they were coming from a
Flash Gordon comic.  On the whole it is usable though (although it won\'t
spark your imagination). 
	The colored artwork has a different problem: while it is pretty
well done it is not related to the topic of this book in *any*
reasonable way (most pictures show a starship, but no ships from the
book from what I can see).  There is no text for the pictures and they
aren\'t even placed close to any meaningful section.
	Rating: 4.5 out of 10 (-2 for unrelated color art; -2 for the
somewhat boring B/W illustrations; -1 for the bad choice of too many
dark colors for the B/W illustrations; -0.5 for the strange placement
of the color art).

EDITING: The editing is a lot better than in the basic T4 rules
(although there was only very little text to be edited).  There are a
couple of typos and grammatical mistakes, but nothing too distracting.
The text itself is written in a very sober style (maybe a little dry)
and I found it somewhat difficult to understand the ship design
process (the missing references to the tables involved are a major
factor in this).  The rules really seem to be written for people with
previous experience in designing Traveller ships and not for newbies
like me.
	Rating: 7 out of 10 (-1 for a couple of easy to spot typos and
problems; -1 for missing references; -1 for the somewhat confusing
explanations).

RULES: While the Standard Ship Design System (the only 6 pages of
rules you\'ll find in this book) seems to be well thought-out the
presentation is less than perfect (see the next section).  The rules
seem to strive for quasi-realism through number-crunching (the number
of tables and the fractional numbers involved even makes most Phoenix
Command supplements pale in comparison).  On the good side, the
complete design process just takes up six pages so that it should be
manageable with a little practice.  The tables also sport a couple of
abbreviations which obviously nobody wanted to explain.  You\'ll
definitely need a pocket calculator to use these rules and you\'d
probably be better of if you know how to create a spreadsheet for
this.
	Sadly they also neglected to include examples of ship design.
The process is very involved and somewhat complicated and it would
have been nice to receive a complete example of a starship designed
from scratch.
	Finally you won\'t be able to create any starship in the
Traveller universe with this supplement.  Ships are limited to 5000
tons in size.
	Rating: 6.5 out of 10 (-1 for obfuscated presentation; -0.5 for
being a little number-heavy; -1 for failing to include examples; -1
for being limited to 5000t ships)

COMPLETENESS: The rules are somewhat confused and suffer from missing
references to the relevant tables (see above).  Also they are
basically presented as a plain text divided into some steps.  A little
more formatting to highlight the different actions required would have
been better.  The system obviously expects the reader to have
completely read and memorized the starship rules in the basic system.
Thus you\'ll even have to read the design rules from the standard
rulebook to understand the improved design process (and can\'t use it
as a stand-alone system).  Examples are missing which further
complicates things.
	Since there is already a lot of redundancy in this book (15 of
the 30 ships were already presented in the T4 rulebook) they also should
have added all the important formulas and descriptions (I e.g. hate
flipping from the ship design book to the basic rules and back just to
determine what a black globe defense system does).
	I also had hoped for a new and improved ship combat system but
they don\'t even mention anything like that.  At least some details
about the workings of sick bays, laboratories, etc. also would have
been nice.
	Rating: 2 out of 10 (-1 for not including the basic travel
formulas, etc.; -1 for missing references; -2 for lack of general
descriptions; -2 for a missing new ship combat system; -1 for limiting
the ship sizes and thus requiring yet another supplement; -1 for
including so much redundant information).

PRICING: $20 for a 107 pages book (3.5 pages of introduction, 1.5
pages on the imperial calendar, 30 pages of tiny ship descriptions and
average quality art, 32 pages of useless and ugly deckplans, 18.5
pages of tables, 1.5 pages of forms, 2 pages of NPCs, 6 pages on ship
design, 12 pages of color art).  Thus the useful parts of the book
basically consist of 41 pages (15 new ship descriptions, 20 pages of
forms and tables, 6 pages on design).  To put it bluntly: the pricing
is excessive and an absolutely bad joke.  The book is worth $10 at
most and even then I would think about it twice.  The book just does
not offer enough for this very high price.  You can get complete
roleplaying systems for this price with a lot more content.  If you
are not a die-hard Traveller fan (or a despaired Traveller newbie
like me) save your money for something else (maybe TSR\'s 1997
Alternity SF rpg, maybe WW\'s upcoming Exile rpg, maybe the Fading Suns
rpg or maybe just some some movie tickets).
	Rating: 0 out of 10.

- ---- PART 2: Detailed Review

The detailed review will comment each section in the order it appears
in the book (if I have to say something about it -- good or bad):

Introduction
- ----
The short introduction contains some basic words on how important
starships are for the third imperium (what a surprise) and then
continues with the Imperial Calendar (I\'m still wondering how it\'s
related to starships although I\'m glad about all background
information I can get).

Starship Descriptions
- ----
This actually is not really a section since you are immediately
dropped into it without any explanation (now words about the format;
no explanations for the abbreviations; you\'ll need to refer to the
basic rules for this).  A ship description takes up two pages: one
page for the illustration and the basic data (in the basic rules they
only needed one-fourth of a page and the presentation was no worse
than it is now) and a second page for the deckplans.  While the waste
of space for the description is only a little annoying the deckplans
are truly bad: they lack all details, there are no grids on them and
they look as if drawn by a fifth-grader who learned to use some
painting software a couple of days ago.  Truly ugly, truly useless and
absolutely bad.  15 of the 30 ships are reproductions from the basic
rules.
	Twice there are NPC descriptions inserted in between ship
descriptions.  While the descriptions are okay, they do not shine.  A
somewhat experienced GM can make up such NPCs on the spot.
	Basically this section offers only very little information on
very many pages.

The Standard Ship Design System
- ----
The system seems to be well-conceived, heavy on numbers and fractions
and is not very well organized.  While the steps are logical they lack
references to many tables and auxiliary formulas used and thus are
pretty confusing at times.  They also require knowledge about the ship
design process in the basic rules and force you to constantly flip
back and forth between the basic rules and this manual unless you
already have memorized all the information about starships from the
basic rules.  This makes it somewhat difficult for newbies to use this
section (although practice will change this).

Tables
- ----
Lot\'s of them.  A little more organization would have been nice but
basically they are okay.


- ---- Part 3: Summary

The summary consists of two parts: an objective part (counting the
numbers) and a subjective part summarizing my personal impressions. 

Layout ........... 5.0/10
Artwork .......... 4.5/10
Editing .......... 7.0/10
Rules ............ 6.5/10
Completeness ..... 2.0/10 
Pricing .......... 0.0/10

Overall rating ... 4.2/10 (25/60) (rounded)

Objectively rated the latest offering in the new Traveller line is a big
disappointment.  The book again appears to have been put together without
spending a lot of time thinking about the composition.  It lacks in many
places and is far too low on useful contents.  The price is by far too
high and there is nothing in the book or in its production value
justifying this price.  Basically this is a below average supplement. 

Now for the subjective part (and personal comments)... I hope I\'m not
too insensitive in my comments but I never liked to only hint at
problems:

1. The book is almost three months late.  Looking at it I wonder what
   IG did in all that time.  The book is pretty thin (a meager 107 pages)
   for its price and more than half of this is filled with at best
   average illustrations and deckplans.  

2. The presentation again is not very good.  When will people
   understand that technical instructions (the ship design process) need
   good examples and that roleplayers want *detail*?  Both is missing in
   this book which is bad for new players.

3. The editing still has a lot of problems in general: what IG
   basically needs are IMHO one or more editors, who have knowledge about
   roleplaying games but aren\'t die-hard Traveller fans.  Again and
   again the current editors seem to neglect that they need to draw new
   gamers into this genre to be able to survive.  Sadly the current offerings
   are not very well suited for new players since they again and again
   assume previous knowledge about the game.  To spot such problems is
   very difficult for someone who his an expert in his field since he\'ll
   automatically assume certain things a newbie doesn\'t know.

4. The price (I can\'t repeat this often enough): $20 is by far too much
   for a book of this size.  If the color art would be excluded I\'d rate
   it as a $8.95 or $10 supplement.  This product really seems to be
   pushed to 107 pages artificially (especially in the section with the
   pre-designed ships).  It just does not have enough contents.  I\'m very
   concerned about this since the next products in the line again are
   priced at $20.  I don\'t know about their page count but I know that I
   *definitely* won\'t buy them if none of the following is going to be
   true:
	- the supplements need to be larger in size and they need to
	  contain a lot more information
	- the price needs to be scaled down (okay, this is not going to
	  happen with the immediate releases coming but I still can hope
	  for the future).
	- the quality of writing needs to improve drastically; currently
	  the quality is on a fanzine level (sorry, but it\'s that average).
	- the quality of the art has to improve and it needs to be *related*
	  to the game!

5. I\'m also pretty disappointed with the little background information
   in Starships.  The meager two pages of NPCs are pretty average and
   lack good ideas, interesting stories and flavour.  Any moderately
   experienced GM is probably able to come up with at least as good
   descriptions on the spot during a game (I know that I regularly do so
   since I don\'t like excessive preparation).

To sum it up: I am (again) very disappointed with the latest offering in
the Traveller line.  My main problem with it really is the high prize (I
got my Starships book for free so I shouldn\'t complain but I would be
really disappointed if I had paid $20 for it).  It really would fare
better at a lower prize (maybe as a 64 pages supplement for $8.95 or $10). 
One half of that would have been dedicated to ship design (tables and
rules and some more formulas and basic descriptions for the equipment) and
the other half could have been used for ready-to-run ships (at the scale
of one ship per page, where the deckplan would take up one half of the
page, one quarter would be used for the data and one quarter for a good
illustration).  That would have been a good product as far as I am
concerned and it probably would rate a lot higher for me.  I fear that IG
(or Sweetpea Entertainment or whoever) will very soon get into financial
problems with the Traveller line if they don\'t manage to captivate a new
audience (the old fan base was never large enough to support the game on
its own).  Over here in Germany Traveller does not seem to sell well
(judging from first-hand expressions in my area and from what I saw during
the Essener Spieletage).  I really hope that things will change soon for
the better though but there is still a lot of work to be done...

True, but most of the formulas in FF&S were for the gun design, or the
alternate technology.  Besides, I don\'t see anything in FF&S that even comes
close to the pages and pages of nothing but tables that T4:Starships has.

> The formulas are thought out enough.  The only problem is that all the
> components are integrated to the 5000t limit.  You\'d probably be better

If the formulas are thought out well, why not publish them?  For example, a
quick analysis of the SSDS jump drive table shows the following relationships:

   Jump Drives 1 Parsec             Jump Drives 6 Parsecs
      Mass  = 0.84 * Hull Size         Mass  = 1.96 * Hull Size
      Vol   = Mass / 3                 Vol   = Mass / 2
      Area  = Vol / 3                  Area  = Vol / 3
      Price = 10% Mass                 Price = 15% Mass
      Crew  = Mass / 500               Crew  = Mass / 500
   For all sizes, fuel = 1.4 * Hull Size

MUCH CLEARER, IMHO, than the table - and that is just a small table.

And pg 95 is _covered_ with numbers from just 2 tables, which are also
completely defined by the two sets of formulas below:

   TL9 Basic ContraGrav       TL10 Standard ContraGrav
   mass   = 2*thrust/75       mass   = thrust/50
   volume = thrust/30         volume = thrust/50
   area   = thrust/500        area   = thrust/50
   power  = thrust/50         power  = thrust/75
   prices = thrust/750        prices = thrust/600
   crew   = thrust/18000      crew   = thrust/25000 (min 0.1)
      approx; min 0.1

Notice how much easier it is to evaluate the rationale behind the numbers when
the formulas are shown, rather than just lists and lists of digits.

If the formulas are tuned to \'max out\' at 5000 tons, then any system published
later will not be consistent with the SSDS!  Personally, I don\'t have a
problem with justifying to my players why 5000t is the physical limit for jump
drive technology - I just want some insight into how the numbers were
determined.

> > My dream is to have a 1 page starship design system...

Touche!  I want a single page of formulas to compute the stats of every major
system - the descriptions and technobabble I consider more as role-playing
material, separate from the number-crunching necessary to have consistent ship
designs. So I would be happy with volumes on how the stuff works (like the
SOM) and how you use it, but I want a fairly simple, consistent mathematical
model to create the ships.

Unlikely, since, IIRC, the first printing of the Classic Traveller rules
set came out the same summer as (or even shortly before) Star Wars: this
was one reason for its rapid and runaway success.  Loren Wiseman still

Um, I just checked my copy of Trillion Credit Squadron (and NO, it\'s not for
sale... <g>). Listed times go from 174 weeks for a 20kton vessel all the way
up to 240 weeks for a million-tonner. True, the times can be shortened with
the "not the first in the class" bonus, or by throwing more money at the
problem, but there\'s still no way to complete a 20 kton vessel, even with
the most opportune situation imaginable, in less than 20 months. For a
million-tonner, the absolute best possible time is just under 2.5 years.
Most vessels will take significantly longer than those times, too, so *I*
don\'t see the problem, to be honest with you.

It was 20,000 ton cruisers he mentioned... IMO, not *quite* big enough, but
I have pretty radical ideas in building cruisers, at least using the High
Guard rules.

Well, the TCS shipyard capacity numbers were directly proprtional to the
population of the manufacturing world. A TL 15 world with, oh, say, 30
billion inhabitants is going to have some big damned shipyards, especially
if the Imperial Navy orders a "crash construction"/wartime production
program. For example, Mora, with a population of 10 billion and a
Charismatic Oligarchy, has a wartime shipyard capacity of 15 million tons
according to TCS. If absolute crash priority is given to the "Cruiser
Project" (enough money spent to bring construction times to a maximum), and
half of the world\'s shipyard capacity is given over to it, then Mora alone
completes 150 50-kton cruisers in 22 months. *That* sort of thing is what
Hans was talking about when he talked about the worlds of Corridor just
building themselves new fleets.

So, in essence, you\'re proposing a rate proportional to population, as well?
That\'s fine by me... you just have to keep in mind the industrial *might* of
a world with 8-10 billion people on it at TL 14 or 15, and remember just how
many of those there are in the areas we\'re talking about here. You\'ve got 5
of those in the Spinward Marches alone. If you just don\'t *like* seeing
large numbers of ships built, well... remember, that\'s going to affect the
Aslan/Vargr, too. A 50kton  CA is a good sized ship, and a feat of
engineering prowess in and of itself... but it\'s just not that major a task
for one of these industrial powerhouses. I will concede that basing
construction times *solely* on displacement is probably an
oversimplification... but it seems a reasonable and workable approximation
to me.

But they didn\'t.  And there\'s the crux of my whole argument.  Your comments
served only to exercise your wit against the Foss art, telling us in more
detail _that_ you didn\'t like it rather than _why_ you didn\'t like it.  To
rephrase, your objections were vague and unformed, amounting to more Foss-
bashing rather than an attempt to further pin down what "Travelleresque"
is, other than Allen Shock\'s caustic but true assessment as "the same
pictures we saw in 1980."

Which is good -- blocky or curved?  all of one piece or with superstructures,
outriggers, and outliers?  "textured" or smooth?  These are the issues to
be addressed, not whether a ship looks like a shoe or a radar detector or
is just something you "can\'t say why" you don\'t like.  (In that case, think
more before posting, so you can tell us).

IG, and Foss, have little reason to change, and little help for doing so,
if merely told "it sucks."  Rather, they need "a, b, and c are inappropriate
for the genre because of x.  More of d would be sensible.  How about
showing us what e looks like?"  Where a, b, c, and d are _features_ or
_elements_ of Foss\' style, not specific and misinterpretable pictures.
I listed a few trends I disagree with (inexplicable openings, off-center 
engines) -- can you do the same, specifically and dispassionately, to be a
useful critic rather than one more naysayer on the bandwagon?

        The fusion plants given in SSDS are all non-Fusion Plus plants, so
you don\'t need to do anything. Fusion Plus was _intended_ to be unsuitable
for spacecraft (part of Marc Miller\'s vision for this was that prior to TL12
you just couldn\'t make small spacecraft). How it\'s going to actually work
with the values given in Vehicles is anybody\'s guess.

        *SIGH* It\'s wrong, that\'s why. Looks like I got bit by FF&S\'s
annoying habit of defining some tables as "per displacement ton of enclosed
volume" and others as "per cubic meter of enclosed volume." Unfortunately, I
guess I had just created a table based on the "per displacement ton" and
thought the life support factors were the same. And nobody caught it during
the review process. So those values should all be multiplied by 14m^3.

 I had considered this - as I indicated, a very strong concern
 is that I want Traveller\'s resurrection to be a success -
 especially given that I consider the death of Traveller to have
 begun not with the demise of GDW, but with the _release_ of
 Traveller:The New Era, or perhaps the release of such grotesque
 concepts as _Dangerous_Dimensions_ [sic] and _Cadillacs_and_
 _Dinosaurs_.

 I would like Freelance Traveller to be considered a "reputable"
 source.  What I perceive as a problem is that currently,
 Traveller is not that well established in the marketplace, and
 I want it to be.  I don\'t want to see a steady stream of
 material of the quality that T4 seems to be, and to the extent
 that lost sales will help IG clear up the quality issues,
 negative reviews are helpful.

 But the question that comes up is whether _at_this_stage_,
 those same lost sales do more harm than good, through reducing
 financial wherewithal and shaking confidence in IG\'s ability to
 produce.

 I do understand your point, and it is a troubling one.  It _is_
 causing me to constantly rethink the policy.  So far, I have
 not come up with a satisfactory compromise on this.  It would
 be ideal if I could get a review of Starships that makes all of
 the discussed points, without the "emotional" baggage, and
 loaded words and phraseology.  It would be much easier to post
 such a review, even if it was ultimately a "don\'t buy"
 recommendation.  But Starships _is_ pretty awful, and _well_
 below my expectations - I don\'t think _I_ could write a review
 of it that I would be willing to publish unless I were
 _anti_-Traveller.

 I\'m willing to reconsider.  Always.  It\'s called "quality
 control" and "goal/progress re-evaluation" and it\'s an
 essential part of any product.  But in this case I\'m going to
 need some hard convincing, and a review that I won\'t feel
 uneasy about.

 Just as a side note - I have a feeling that the New York Times
 may also have a limit to what they\'ll publish as restaurant
 reviews - I\'ve read a couple of Ruth Reichl\'s reviews that
 quite definitely feel like there\'s an unspoken statement "This
 was my second choice for review this week - my first choice was
 so bad that I couldn\'t in good conscience write what I
 thought".  At the moment, I sort of feel that way about
 Starships - but I don\'t have the benefit of another product to
 review, unless I want to review GURPS Vehicles II.  And GURPS
 ain\'t Traveller, no matter how you slice it.

 From "Cities in Flight" by James Blish.  TDX was a
 "gravitationally polarized" explosive whose force was directed
 outward from the detonation point in a plane that was
 perpendicular to the gravitational gradient.

 It was also mentioned in a "Ships Locker" in an old JTAS, but I
 have a copy of Blish.

 1) Space in the Domain of Deneb is far better-charted than the more
    unexplored stretches at the fringes of Charted Space: it\'s nice to
    already know where the pleasant planets and accessible resources
    are instead of having to search and survey (hardly a warrior\'s task!)

 2) The Fiyfiyalr (Imperials) deserve retribution for their murder of
    the Aslan ambassador at Strephon\'s Palace.  The rimward Imperium
    is wracked by horrific battles among large fleets and wide-spread
    destruction of the very land the Aslan are searching for.  So the
    more peaceful Domain of Deneb makes an apt target for appropriate
    but productive vengeance.

 3) I was of the opinion that many of the ihatei were already from the
    trans-Rift Aslan colonies, and thus would have had to cross _back_
    over the Reaches to avoid Denebian space.  Nevertheless, as news
    of Imperial disintegration travelled, perhaps some sons in the main
    body of the Hierate were fired to go there themselves rather than
    trek through already-occupied space, negotiating for passage with
    older and stronger clans, to reach the more open areas outside the
    Hierate\'s rimward and spinward frontiers.

Just a few thoughts, off the cuff.  As many have argued, portions of the
Rebellion are hard to reconcile with logic and sense.  Thank goodness it\'s
still over a millenium away.  :-)

Um... not entirely.  I\'ve always liked Danforth\'s art, and I thought Barr\'s
cartoons were hilarious.  Especially the picture of the starship porthole
with a hammer next to it and a sign saying "In case of fire, break
glass"...

Is anyone else longing to see David Dietrick\'s line drawings in T4?  Now
/there/ is some good illustration.

I actually like Foss\' art.  However, I do think it\'s been way overused in
T4.  His cover illos are great.  But using his stuff as the baseline for
/all/ starship illustrations, and then trying (IMHO) desperately to make
the deckplans fit the often nonsensical way he draws starships was a
mistake.  The job of doing the ships actually used in Traveller should have
perhaps gone to someone with a more "scientific" approach to ship painting.

I think IG has been relying too much on the work of one artist.  Variety is
the spice of life, after all, and adding two or three more artists (like
Dietrick or Danforth) will only improve the quality of the printing.

Unfortunately I think they were draw using Adobe Illustrator (IG was
looking for someone with Illustrator experience a while back), a very
nice and professional caliber drawing package.  The problem with the
deckplans is that they seem to have been drawn by someone who didn\'t
know how to use Illustrator.

	Well, I have another, similar, funny-map question. Why did the Vilani 
expand all the way to the Solomani Rim sector, a full 4 sectors rimward, 
when they only controlled HALF of Corridor, which was right next door to 
Vland sector?

	I\'d have to guess this is because very early on in Traveller history, 
someone designed a nifty-looking map, and then later authors and designers 
had to write history around this map.

I don\'t care if scouts are needle configs or box configs... so long as they
aren\'t an image I would associate as ASLAN... all the ships in the tw

Some do.. look at the soviet ones of the 80\'s vs the british and american

the two are, IMNSHO, incompatible. Differences, when explained, will become

Stands for "Two Dimensional Explosive". Appeared in an old ship\'s locker
from JTAS.

Directs 90% of it\'s explosive force through a 45degree (22.5 off plane)
doughnut, and the other 10% into the remaining.

So I would not want to be lying down under a TDX Bouncing Betty... ;-)

        Yep. Basically, you\'re the rotor in a VERY big generator. However,
those &^%*^% Conservation laws take away kinetic energy. So you\'ll slowly
fall out of orbit. OTOH, you can reverse the process--feed electricity INTO
the cable, and you can increase your speed.

Funny you mention Liz Danforth.  She lives here in town.  Her work is 
great, and she\'s a funny lady to talk to.  She\'s been doing a lot of 
the illos for M:tG cards, and some of the other CCG\'s.  She finally 
tied the knot with Mike Stackpole, another name some of the grognards 
may remember.

Mike of course, wrote the GDW novels for Dark Conspiracy, some of the 
better ones in the genre.

        I think the idea here was to define, by example, what does and does
not constitute "Travelleresque." And I\'m betting he got bored, just as I
did, by repeating "Yes" or "No" over and over again, so he tried to add in a
little humor. YMMV.

        The problem is, you can\'t narrow it down like this--both textured
AND smooth are acceptable, in different circumstances. Some ships look good
blocky, other times a curved ship looks good. For something like this, the
only way to do it may be by example.

   Speaking as somebody who\'s embraced every new incarnation of Traveller
upon its release (the only time I went "retro" to play CT was in
anticipation of T4), I don\'t think I\'m TOO hidebound... :-)

    However, I don\'t think many people worry too much about the ships
"looking different." In fact, one of my minor beefs has always been seeing
the same ships, hundreds of years apart in different Traveller settings. At
least the Star Trek franchise has ship design changing, but remaining
recognizably "Trekkesque," over the course of a few hundred years. Maybe
the interior Foss black and white ships would have been better received had
the reproduction been better. Or those damn deckplans not been so pig-ugly.
I would have liked a nod to the future, and have had one or two designs
that at least *resembeled* what would become in 2,000 years. But, like I
said, I don\'t dislike the ships because they\'re different, *per se*.

    In fact, to take this argument further, *aesthetic ship design* (what
it looks like on the outside ) may not change as much over 2,000 years as
*philosophical ship design* (how it functions and how it was designed to
serve its purpose on the inside). I mean, all of the ships in Starships
seem to me to be the *core* of ships 2,000 years later (that we all know
and love) inside different SHELLS, so the differences are VERY superfical.
Look at the design of a Roman Villa and a modern upper-middle class house,
for example. Both have pretty much the same purpose, but were built under
the constraints of differing social paradigms. The only ship that marks a
different design philosophy in Starships is the (pardon if I get the name
wrong) Secured Trader.

    The "retro" look lies fully in Foss\'s vehicle and small arms sketches.
And the fact that, so far, the only visual clues we have of this new
Traveller universe come from Foss (good, but mis-used)  and Elmore
(competant but dry).  Hell, a *few* Foss color pics are very
"Travelleresque." But in concentrating on huge World ships, the feel of
Traveller is lost. Where is the tiny Free Trader, fighting it\'s way out of
a deal gone sour? Where is the solitary Scout Ship, making first contact
with an unknown race?

    "Travelleresque Art" does not, to me, mean endless Kinunirs running
around the galaxy, or every scout ship looking like a door jam, or every
artist trying to copy the fun but scratchy Keith brothers (who did a fair
amount of mediocre work as well). I think we\'re talking about some
nebulous, hard-to-define "spirit of the game" when we say "Travelleresque".
For example, some British list members may remember an old adventure comic
called, I believe, the Trigan Empire, or somesuch. Its style was pure \'70s
schoolboy "True Adventure" comics, but, in a Mileu 0 setting,  I\'d consider
it "Travelleresque" AND "Retro" AND completely unlike anything that\'s been
published so for for Traveller.

   New Foss art can\'t be cheap - the Black and White pieces have to be
above RPG industry freelance standards. So why not get the word out to
other artists? A few names mentioned are all ones I\'d long to see back with
Traveller:

Liz Danforth
Blair Reynolds
Ken Frank
David Dietrick
Donna Barr

But even so, there are a lot of talented newcomers out there who would at
least add some variety to what IG has published so far. IS there an art
director somewhere in the T4 pipeline? Someone with a good base in graphic
design (for the overall look of the line) and who could coordinate a team
of freelancers? I\'m guessing no, given the amature deck plans, mis-used
art, "clumped" color plates in Starships and reliance on two artists.

These ships serve as mobile repair depots for the fleet.Small ships
up to 300 ton can be repaired in the cargo bay. Larger ships are 
repaired using the 50 ton cutters with the repair modules to handle
and move large pieces of equipment or metal. The engineering shop is
equipted to repair or make misc. pieces of ships equiptment. The power
plant produces a surplus that can be transfered to a ship under repair

Actually, that one\'s not by Donna Barr. That\'s by Loren Wiseman and John
Morrison (presumably Wiseman made it up and Morrison drew it).

Credit where due, and all.

I don\'t get the impression that you were around a lot when FFS what the
design sequence for Traveller.  Lots (and that\'s an *understatement*) of
people complained that whereas before they could do everything with a
pocket calculator and a bunch of tables (Book 2-Starships, Book 5-High
Guard, and the MT desgin sequence), you now needed at least a math
minor, a good understanding of abstract algebra, and a spreadsheet being
run on a Cray 3 to design a ship!

So, what to do?  Take FFS, put it into table form, leave out the
equations that people didn\'t want to see in the first place, and viola
you have the SSDS.  Make it even simpler and you have QSDS.  People
raved and much praise was lauded.  Apparently, there is something to be
said for being parsimonious.

You could ask Dave Golden and Guy Garnett for the specifics and see if
you can derive equations.  However, if I recall correctly, a lot of
individual components from FFS have been lumped together into packages
now and thus may not be able to scale well in an equational sense.

My system would have industrial employees going up with the population
(though not necessarily directly proportional), while TCS has shipyard
tonnage directly proportional to the population. 

I think the biggest difference between what you are using and what I
propose is that you are using a system based on the *tonnage* of a ship,
while mine is based on the *cost*. Military vessels cost more than civilian
vessels (weapons, armor), of the same tonnage and the cost goes up somewhat
faster than the size. If the benefits go up faster than the cost, it\'s
still economical, but it shouldn\'t be easy or cheap.

I guess it comes down to personal preferences, but I don\'t like the high
construction rates that TCS can give you for heavy military craft.

No.  I\'d like to also add the artist for the weapons in Guns Guns Guns.  I
also like the guy who did the CORPS gm screen, although I\'m not sure if I\'d
say it was travelleresque.

Look.  What I tried to say is simple.  I don\'t know why you find it 
so hard to understand.  

These are the pics that I think are Travelleresque, and these are the 
pics I think are not Travelleresque.

It is nothing more complicated than that.  I was not trying to be an 
artist and suggest new ways of drawing the ships--rather I wanted to 
give examples of what I like and don\'t like.  I did that.

I don\'t think anything about T4 is innovative.  As a matter of fact, 
the rules are much simpler than I am used to using.  But, it is a 
return to CT, and I like that.   I really, really, like that.

And let\'s not forget Tom Peters (who did very nice ship illustrations)
and Mike Vilardi, who does fantastic character work.  Vilardi is
currently doing very nice work for WEG on Star Wars - his art is one of
the few things I really like about that game system any more.........

     How about making future T4 books (including reprintings of T4 and 
     Starships books) ring-punched, and sell ring binders complete with 
     gorgeous looking colour plates to those that *want* expensive looking 
     art. Those that don\'t, can use ordinary ring binders (this is market 
     segmentation or 2-part pricing for any economists out there). 
     
     A further refinement - 2 different releases for each T4 book: one 
     \'book\' (colour plates, possibly hardcover, non-punched, price/quality 
     up with industry standard) as the flagship; another (hole punched, no 
     colour plates except cover, priced lower than most other games) for 
     the budget-conscious. The hole punched version would basically be a 
     cheaper reprint of the main book, with the expensive bits extracted. 
     
     Updates/errata etc. can be printed as complete replacement pages, and 
     inserted in place of the error-ridden pages (a la military manuals). 
     
     Selling point would be the continuing support that IG gives its 
     customers (ie justifying the price tag by distributing free/cheap 
     errata pages via the same channels they distribute the books). 
     
     The T4 \'system\' books could be set up as chapters of a large \'volume\'. 
     Thus MMT (book 1) would have chapters 1.1, 1.2, pages 1.2.12 and so 
     on. Starships would be 2.1, 2.2 etc. 
     
     The advantage of this is that IG could periodically update a 
     consolidated index that refers throughout the entire body of work, 
     making T4 a new standard in gamer-friendliness and usefulness. 
     Cynically, this would also induce people to \'complete\' their 
     collection, because the holes would be bleedingly obvious...but that\'s 
     just basic marketing.

Anyone who\'s got a copy of The Long Way Home care to comment about the
deckplans in the back of that? How about any members who saw the full-colour
"Eagle" liner deckplans we used for the Traveller tournament at Euro GEN CON
this year? These plans include internal pictorial detail of all rooms, plus
The Long Way Home included a \'walk through\' description by the ship\'s
engineer. I am proud to say that in TLWH we very much tried to emulate the
quality of previous DGP products.

Oh, and for anyone complaining about artwork, TLWH doesn\'t have any room
inside for spare artwork - the only \'art\' are the plans, maps, etc. you need
to run the adventure. No wasted space, no conflict over who should have
drawn what sort of blob spacecraft with a crane (and just so you know, I
count Chris Foss as a friend, so be careful what you say)...

The "Eagle" may well be released as a BITS/CORE product in 1997, with a
series of linked adventures...

And for all those people in the US waiting to get hold of The Long Way Home,
I apologise for the delay in getting it over to you, but we are currently in
discussion with Imperium Games with regard to TLWH being released as an
official IG publication. If you\'d like to see TLWH as an IG product, then
e-mail Imperium Games and tell them so! :-)

No, count me in as a LizFan.

          While we\'re on the subject, would there be any interest in a kind of
          \'art index\' that would provide details of what pictures were where
          in the Traveller corpus?

          Has something like that been done?

          If not, I would envisage it containing info such as:

          artist
          source (book and page number)
          colour/b&w
          type of picture (this is outside my expertise if anyone can advise)
          size
          subject (with perhaps some loose definitions)
          keywords (so you could track down every picture containing say, a
          Vargr)



          Can anyone add to the list?

          With various commitments this is not something I will be undertaking

question by Harold Hale, I\'d like to make a more positive
answer.

1. I think the task system is a good compromise between
the (reputed) complexity of MT and the dated CT system.
I know the difficulties are a bit off but this will suit a more
heroic style of game and is easily fixed by those of us that
prefer more grit under our fingernails

2. I think the new Psionics system is a bit more interesting than
previous incarnations.  Athough I haven\'t really read it with game
balance in mind (yet).

3. As many people on the GDW-Beta list have said, the introduction
of structure points in space-combat is a good addition (even if the
space cbt has other flaws)

4. T4 seems to have succeeded in finding common ground amongst
traveller players - a few months ago we couldn\'t even have a unified list.

5. I think the char gen succeeds in unifying the old advanced/basic
systems so that there is no longer a 2-tier system of character types.

6. <Warning, I\'m going to mention Chris Foss, please skip this point if 
you\'re easilly offended>  The production value of the game is much higher
than any previous version of trav.  There has never been so much good
art in a trav product and the use of full-colour spread through the basic book
is unequalled in any previous incarnation.

to other game companies.
Just take a look, for example at the later boxed sets by T$R 
(boo,hiss): You pay 30 $ and get at least 2-3 booklets with 4-color 
art, 2-3 maps and counter sheets. That\'s only 50 % more money for i 
don\'t know how much more content compared with Starships.
Granted, IG doesn\'t have the same turnover, but it should work harder 
at keeping the prices low and the useful gaming stuff up.
Keep the full color plates out of the books and only use them for 
front and back-covers, for example. I liked the DGP way of doing the 
art much better, spreading lots of B/W illus that relate to the 
information detailed in the text out over the book instead of putting 
in (admittedly beautiful, but useless) full color art with no 
relation to the data presented.

In short, find a cheaper printer, lose the full color bits and do 
more B/W art, maybe asking some of the old guard (Blair Reynolds 
springs to my mind) if they wanted to do some art.

Secondly, think before yopu publish! Check and doublecheck the data 
presented to the effect that it stays consistent (Thrusterplates-TL 
is one such example for louzy checking) with the rest of the 
material. Having published only two manuals and already such 
contradictions spells no good for the future!  

Lastly, advertize your products where people will see it, i.e. in 
larger gaming magazines like Dragon, Pyramid and the like (simple 
reviews don\'t count). Full page adds that excite the future customer 
and point him to the game. Some stores i have seen don\'t even put the 
new rules manual on the "New arrivals" shelf, but directly to the old 
Traveller items, because general lack of promotion makes them feel 
that the space is better used on other items that have higher sales 
expectancy (like the new T$R super supplement). Big companies can 
afford only to advertize in their own Mags since they are standards 
everybody reads, small ones like IG can\'t!

Just my 2 pfennig!

        No.  I\'d think that in general, it\'s hard to be innovative in the
RPG field.  Essentially, each genre (fantasy, SF, horror, etc) seems to
develp from a matching genre of geek literature/cinema.  I think that
innovation in RPGs lies in either doing a good job of opening up a new
genre (such as White Wolf with Vampire and perhaps Mage) or in coming up
with a fundamentally different gaming system (such as the transition from
class-based to skills-based character generation). T4 doesn\'t do either.

        Thus, I don\'t think T4 is innovative.  I think (albeit what I hear
of Starships has me worried that the guys implementing it might not be up
to the task) that OTOH, it has the possibility of become great.

        Why?  It is a fairly simple, elegant SF RPG with a hard-sf bent but
room for soft sf if you want it.  It has very enjoyable design systems that
add a lot to the gaming.  It might eventually have good background
materials.  And of course, there\'s the setting: the whole bloody universe.
That\'s a lot of room.

        I think that in general, although I haven\'t played any of these,
that in comparison Star Bores is just (yaaaawn) a merchandising phenomenon
and more to the point bad sf,  and that Fading Suns and especially White
Wolf\'s upcoming Exile are just a little too thematically limited; they
trade room for variety for feel.  I suspect that Exile might be really bad
in that respect; I can just see it now: "great... here we are angst-ridden
exiles from human space, sitting around a dingy cafe in a dingy station
wearing lots of black, bemoaning the high Gothic tragedy of our horrifying
existence.  <lots of high roleplaying of dubious quality ensues>  And the
coffee *sucks*.  Let\'s get some stakes and go beat up on the Camaril... er,
wups, nevermind..."

        To get to the point and then back to the books.  Sometimes,
innovation is not neccessarily good.  Sometimes being a very, very good
non-innovative product is all you need to do well.  I mean, for some
things, nothing tops a good solid claw hammer with a nice non-slip rubber
grip...  Even though you can still do some cool stuff with a power hammer,
it just isn\'t the same.

        Back to the books...

redundancy with prior materials.
Information about starships, Aliens and Equipment is still widely 
available in the shops from earlier editions of Traveller, just see 
the Imperial Encyclopedia for a good example.

I feel it would have been wiser to first publish the rules (as they 
did) and then directly the first Millieu /(which isn\'t even printed 
at this time) an RPG in this day and age needs a background and when 
the other information is still available on can wait reprinting them 
until the basics are out.

This also increases sales, btw: 
I won\'t buy Starships (becxause i own all the old stuff from CT to 
MT, which is fully compatible, and due to the bad review)
I don\'t know yet wheather i\'ll buy Aliens (I\'ll compare it to the DGP-
Modules first)
 I won\'t buy the new equipment book (i have the old stuff and to me 
equipment isd not that necessary, i\'ll invent it myself, normally)
I will, however, buy all the new Millieux, since they include NEW 
STUFF, NOT AVAILABLE ANYWHERE ELSE! That\'s what i really want. 
However, IG keeps concentrating on material, that, although necessary 
in the long run, could without problem, be published at a much later

That is great news, Andy.  I liked the module, The Long Way Home.  It is a
return to the type of Traveller that I like.  If fact the only thing that I
am upset about is that I read it already...(I found out last night that the
module is being run on the Undernet on Wednesday Night and I can\'t play
(serious sad face).

Is the Eagle the deckplans I saw in Schweinfurt?  They were great.  If the
linked adventures is anything like TLWH, I am interested.

I emailed Jo yesterday about the card game. I have heard anything back yet.

Andy keep up the good ideas.  It is nice to know someone understands what
real Traveller products should be.

I have to agree with Grant. I *loved* Donna Barr\'s artwork. Do you remember
the "Been good to know ya" nuke pic in "\'Til They Glow..", or the captain

"Starship Malfunctions" pic (JTAS15) with all the intricate little high-tech
parts lying around in pieces as the crew pores over the tech manual.

They were the perfect foil when everyone (myself included) started taking
the whole thing too seriously. It\'s a GAME, for goodness sake! You\'re
_supposed_ to have fun! That\'s why it\'s so silly when everyone starts
arguing about "how technology should work", and so forth. Might as well
argue about the "whichness of the why" or whatever. Argue about things that
affect game balance, or that affect the standard history, but not that "this
bit of equipment should be able to do such-and-such". Rather, say WHY it
should, in terms that speak to game balance, flow of game play, character
development, and so on.

Thanks, 

Going to the FAQ Subscribe/Unsubscribe I see that the address has changed to
majordomo@lists.MPGN.COM.  The address listed in my old copy of the  FAQ and
"Welcome to Traveller" response is (now was)  majordomo@MPGN.COM.

Apparently the @lists. caused the problem.

Uh, last time I checked, AOL gave you unlimited time for $19.95US per
month... also, if you only use it a little bit (3 hours or less per
month), you can get on for $4.95US per month... plus, AOL has an 800
number that they only charge 0.10US per minute to use (otherwise I\'d
have to dial long distance which would be a whole lot more...)

Not in Classic Traveller (I never got comfortable with Megatraveller designs
and FF&S, so it\'s possible that things are different under them). Small
ships cost ~0.75 MCr per ton, big ships cost ~0.5 to 0.75 MCr per ton. 
Anyway, things don\'t have to be easy or cheap when you have 45 trillion 
credit per year to spend on new construction. Besides, I don\'t really care 
to defend the time when the Vargr would have been kicked out of Corridor 
too vehemently since I don\'t believe they would ever get far into it. If 
you want to double the time it takes to construct them, be my guest. The 
Vargr are still out of Corridor before 1125.

>I guess it comes down to personal preferences, but I don\'t like the high
>construction rates that TCS can give you for heavy military craft. 

However those are the ones we have to work with. I don\'t know enough about
the subject to say wether they are realistic (Perhaps some WW2 scholar can
help us?). The figures are for example 144 weeks to build a 5000 T ship, 
174 weeks to build a 20,000 T ship, and 224 weeks to build a 200,000 T ship.

In one example that I worked out I had Mikesh building 2600 Sloan Class
escorts in 72 weeks (and starting on ~2300 more), 1250 20,000 T cruisers
in 87 weeks (and starting on ~1100 more), and 220 200,000 T Plankwell Class
Dreadnaughts in 112 weeks. That is with construction bonuses for class
ships and overtime payments according to the rules.

Well I finally got Starships and I figured I give my opinions.  I don\'t
mind the art, some of the B&W pictures are good and some not so good.  

The main problem with the deckplans is that they don\'t follow the ship
very well. I think it is the Free Trader which lists 10 staterooms, and
the plans only show 8.  Also for some reason some of the statrooms
change size on the same ship.  On the Royal Class Luxury Liner, the
plans list MiddlePassage staterooms, but there aren\'t any such
passengers on the ship, I don\'t know where the Artist got that idea from. :(
Also, the plans list jump drives, manuver drive and engine.  What is an
engine if it isn\'t a jump drive or a manuver drive. ???

I am listed as the designer of two ships, the Modular Cutter, and the
Luxury Liner. But the Modular Cutter is not the one I designed.  I am
pretty sure that the Modular Cutter can\'t be built with the present
design rules.  It is listed at 4-G acceleration and TL-9.  But at TL-9
there is no grav compesation available, so the crews will be squished
flat.  Also small fusion plants are unavailable at TL-9, requiring,
either a huge ship, or a fission power plant, which is so heavy that
the ship can\'t go very fast.  

I think Don Perrin just looked up the stats for TL-15 spacecraft and
just fudged the lower tech level versions.  I doubt that many of the
small craft are even doable with the SSDS rules.  There is no mention
of Fusion Plus, and rules for it are not listed in the SSDS rules, so I
don\'t think you can say the fighters use Fusion Plus.  I\'ll try to make
up some of the small craft to see if they actually follow the rules.  

Someone was mentioning the personalities section. Don Perrin didn\'t do
these, in the credits they are listed to someone else. A woman I believe.  

I\'ll send in the designs I made up for the Cutter and Luxury Liner, so
people can see what the individual crew members do and the like.

Crew Description:
Notes: The Royal is a USL box.  It carries a crew of 20 Engineers,
9 maintenance staff, 1 electronics operator, 16 Gunners, 2 Flight Crew,
80 Stewards, 5 doctors, a pilot, a navigator and 8 Command Crew. A
42 piece orchestra is also on board.
It carries a 95 ton shuttle in a minimal hanger.

Description:
	The Royal class of liners is designed with luxury in mind. It is
how the Nobles of the new Imperium travel the stars, along with the super rich.
The Royal is outfitted with every conceivable luxury, it features a
Grand Ballroom with one of  the finest Sylean Style chamber orchestras
in the sector.  A high rollers casino, where the super rich can try to
become even richer.  A sports center with a small swimming pool and
variable gravity weight lifting equipment.  The finest in original holo
movies are shown each night in the Grand Salon.  20 of the finest chefs
from the Imperium create masterpieces of culinary delight each and
every night. An excellent sickbay and an expert staff of physicians
stand ready in case an medical emergency arise.  The staff is highly
trained and taught how to deal with the rich and famous with the utmost
of discretion.  
	The Royal class has 414 standard high passage rooms, and 100 super-high
passage suites which have twice the space and are even more pampered
than the other guests.  
	The ship carries a shuttle craft to load and unload passengers.
 Each ship is named for members of the Imperial Family, and several of
the Emperor\'s nieces have traveled on a Royal liner, and have raved
about their stay.  More members of the Imperial family are expected to
soon take a cruise.  
	Each Royal ship is equipped with a state of art defense grid, and all
members of the staff are cross-trained in security matters, so as to be able
assure passengers of their safety.  It mounts an Advanced Civilian Sensor suite.

Here is  the design for a TL-11 Modular Cutter. It uses a Fission power
planet, becuase all available fusion plants are too large, and nothing
else would fit on board.  I came up with stats for the three standard modules.

The modular cutter is designed to carry one of many modules available.  
Three are the ATV module, which can hold up to 14 displacement tons of 
vehicles; the fuel module, which serves as a fuel skimming vehicle and
storage tank; and the cargo module.

That is one possibility, of course. Note, however, that those Cr500 per
citizens works out at roughly 3% of the GPP (Gross Planetary Product)
as defined in _Striker_. And according to _Striker_ the maximum spending
in times of war is 15% of the GPP...

I may be misremembering, but I think the figures I\'ve seen somewhere (in
_Rebellion_ perhaps?) is that there are ~1000 fighting ships and ~1000
auxiliary vessels in a fleet. That would bring the number up to 34,000
fighting ships in the regular fleets and the same in the reserve fleets,
plus whatever strength there is in the four named fleets. And this says
about the size of those ships or about the strength of planetary defense
forces.

The one thing I\'d be careful around are the volume component figures.  
IMHO, the worst ship design problem that we\'ve been dealing with from
MT and FF&S is that we have *two* volume units, the displacement ton
and the cubic meter (kiloliter).  We\'ve already found one error in the
SSDS tables due to this -- hopefully the only one, but I\'d check for
others.  One of the more annoying things about FF&S was how it would
change back and forth between displacement tons and cubic meters at 
the drop of a hat, from table to table. 


The second worst problem is probably the m-drive "displacement*10"
rule of thumb we\'ve been using to determine ship acceleration.  It
only works if a ship has a density near 0.714 metric tons/m^3.  
Small ships with a lot of armor can mess this up badly.  This figure
tries to estimate final ship mass; the problem is that it is *hard*
to come up with an easy, user-friendly way to do this without 
designing the whole ship and tweaking the size of the maneuver 
drive afterward.  I don\'t know if there\'s a good way to make this
more "realistic" and keep it simple.  But this is a design issue,  
not a proofreading issue.

One neat thing is that SSDS can be used to quickly build starships
for _Battle Rider_.  Once ship design is complete, instead of making
a USD, you can use the rules in the back of _Battle Rider_ to make
_Battle Rider_ stats.  Am I the only person here who\'s noticed that
the USD Conversion Chart is the same as the one in _Battle Rider_,
but extended to *60*!?  Heck, this is cool just for BR fiends....

In fact, you can almost directly convert between a USD and stats
for _Battle Rider_.  The main stumbling block is converting the
weapons batteries correctly.  The USD figures give intensity in
the same figures as BR, with an assumed short range of 10 hexes.
However, in SSDS multiple weapons can be organized into permanent 
batteries that are considered *one weapon*, with a USD value which
is the something like the sum of the USD values of the components.  
In addition, the effect of overpowering gets added in somehow,
not considered separately as in TNE.  If armor works the same way
as TNE, this has obvious effects on combat; large ships and deep-
site meson guns may no longer be as invulnerable to laser turret
fire from permanent multiple-turret battery equipped ships.

Kenneth,

I could be mistaken, but knight is almost never a hereditary title.  It must
be earned in every case of which I am aware.  I have always explained
characters who are "born" with a SOC of B as being children of nobles\'
servants or liveried men.  The parent in service probably died, and the child
was brought up in the lords\' household.  The rank of knight, and the title
sir, reflect the child\'s living primarily in the house of a noble, although
they are not truly of the noble class themselves.  BTW, I really like your
posts; just consider this a little constuctive criticism.

yet, and frankly, my expectations have been lowered to the point where I am
likely to think it\'s not too bad, given what I\'d read about it.  I have a far
more serious concern.  Namely, who gives a s***?

Why are we debating the quality of the Starships book, when there is little
to no campaign material in which to fly these designs?  Where is M:0?
 Shouldn\'t it have been a higher priority for the second release by IG than a
catalog of ship designs?  If IG wants to attract new customers, it needs to
be done with story.  Period.  Yeah, the Starships book, and CSC, will be
useful resources.  But consider what else is out there.  If I were a
20-year-old college student (*oh*, if I were a 20-year-old anything...) in
Tempe, going into my FLGS looking for a new SF RPG, I would probably (at
least) find copies of T4 and Fading Suns.  Let\'s see, T4 has this rulebook
without a whole lot of campaign material, and a book of ships and rules for
designing my own; Fading Suns has a rulebook with quite a lot of campaign
material, and a sourcebook called Byzantium Secundus, detailing an entire
world and the intrigues and adventures to be found there!  Hey, cool!  I\'ll
take Fading Suns.  I realize in the Good Ole Days, (or the Dark Ages,
depending on your POV) you put out three black books (or in T$R\'s experience,
a couple of Manuals) and people went out and created their own universe.  I
did.  You probably did.  But most kids today don\'t.  Not because "kids today"
are lazier, less intelligent, less motivated, less concerned.  (They aren\'t).
 They don\'t because they don\'t have to.  Look at how many BattleTech
supplements are on the shelf.  Or Star Wars.  Or SFB.  Or Shadowrun. Or (God
forbid) D&D.  Detailed, rich storylines that exist so the new player can get
rolling with a minimum of fuss.  I realize each of these systems has a longer
history than IG, so, naturally, they have had more time to fill those
shelves, but the same can\'t be said of Fading Suns.  And, it\'s not like
Traveller doesn\'t have a long, rich, detailed history of it\'s own.  Exploit
it as soon as possible to capture the hearts, minds, and imagination (not to
mention buying dollars) of young, new gamers, the ones who will keep the
company alive for us old farts.  The game will always live for us, but for
the sake of IG\'s success, forget Starships, and CSC, and QSDS, and RPSCS, et
al.  (No offense to those who created them.  I use RPSCS and SSDS
extensively.  They are wonderful rules additions that support my fifteen
years of campign materials).  Put out M:0, and M:1100, and M:TNE, and
M:Frontier Wars, and M:Rebellion, and all the rest, and put them out now.
 Draw on the talents of those who have gone before, and those who wouldn\'t be
designing games now if it weren\'t for Traveller, and return it to it\'s
rightful place as the premier SF RPG on the market.

Hmmm... but how are you going to determine the number of "shipyard
production workers", to coin a phrase? Just by referee fiat?

Well, I can see your point here, but the rate you mentioned earlier was
awfully darned slow, IMO ("1-2 MCr per hundred production workers per
month", as I recall). If it takes 100 guys 1 month to install one light
laser turret, then the shipyard must have hired them away from the Highway
Department, where eight guys stand around watching one guy swing a pick
every 60 seconds.  :)    I\'d be much more inclined to cut a break for
civilian vessels on the time required.

However, I don\'t follow your last sentence quoted above... what "benefits"
are we talking about here?

>I guess it comes down to personal preferences, but I don\'t like the high
>construction rates that TCS can give you for heavy military craft. 

Whereas, to me, construction times of 3-5 years for military vessels seems
reasonable, with more expensive "crash programs" cutting that somewhat, and
the large numbers of ships that can be built just are a reflection of the
industrial might of the Third Imperium. YMMV.

Off this topic... I found a second copy of TCS up in my parents\' attic this
weekend, so it the person who posted looking for it still wants one, email me.

        Hear hear...  It\'s kinda hard for a lot of people to do a decent,
flavourful campaign without a developed background to build on.  That was
the most glaring omission in the T4 rulebook, IMHO: little or no
background.

        I\'m currently gearing up for a Milieu 0 campaign starting out of
Sylea... and will have to make most of Sylea up.  Not a problem, but it
just means I\'ll have to give out a more massive pregame handout than I
usually do.  Oh well.

I took a look at the QSDS & SSDS again and finally figured out why 
the cargo numbers published in _T4_ & _Starships_ look really 
strange. They\'re in *cubic meters*!

T4 (page 96), and Starships (page 75) state that cargo capacity
should be given in displacement tons.


Someone needs to proof read the ships published in _T4_ & _Starships_ 
for similar small errors. (I would, but I\'m kinda busy at the 
moment.)

I agree with this. Externally, T4 and Starships look very nice: black, 
with great, full colour pictures. A quick flip through shows clearly 
laid out text and more colour pix. Definitely a good-looking product.

Have you ever seen CT Book 5, High Guard? It had a four page 5.5 by 8.5
inch pull out in the middle (equivalent to two pages of 8.5 by 11
inches) which pretty much let you design any ship between 10 and 1
million tons. (Well, you had to keep in your head a few small rules
about bridges and fuel purification plants.)

Someone said here last week that the old High Guard rules were broken.
Quite frankly, I don\'t see how they were in any way inferior to SSDS.
They certainly weren\'t any less "realistic" (whatever that means in this
context). They gave you fewer options in types of lasers (four types,
instead of the scads of laser types you get in SSDS), but gave you
more meson guns and particle accellerators. And I\'m not sure that having
umpteen different lasers to choose from really adds that much to the game.

And using High Guard, I can crank out a ship design in 5 minutes.

Sure, the space combat system was too abstract for role-playing (it was
meant for fleet battles). But the design system was a whole lot easier
to use, and the ships that resulted were in no way inferior for
role-playning than what we\'ve got now.

Well, that\'s the end of this quarterly pro-High-Guard rant.

Not really.But as the K\'kree (and probably the Vilani) might say, 
innovation doesn\'t necessarily mean better. T4 is an attempt to take the 
original CT rules, and update and modernize them.

I have to say for all the flak IG has taken for their production values, 
I\'m very excited about T4 because of these new rules. They\'ve changed all 
of the things I had problems with in the original Traveller, and left alone 
all the things I loved about it.

I didn\'t think MT was complex at all.  In fact, I found it easy to 
master and with just the right amount of detail.

CT was like old D&D--looking at table after table for modifiers.  I\'m 
glad they changed.

I do think T4 is the best task system yet for Traveller, but the 
original post was talking about innovative.  I haven\'t seen anything 
in T4 that just blew my socks off.  I mean, T4 has a good system, but 
it does not do anything that I haven\'t seen in another RPG.  Adding 
skill and attribute is an old system.  James Bond used a system like 
this.

Then use one of the fixes.  I, of course, use the KBv.1.1 task system.

True.  If you look through all the griping, you find dedicated people just 
wanting Traveller to be the best it can be.

Me too!  My 4 year characters can now compete with my 1 year

Even though I don\'t like much of the Foss art, I have to agree with 
you here.  Just compare your T4 book with any of the old books, and 
it looks a lot better.

This is not true.  Usually, the title must be earned, but I ready 
every source that I had on Traveller nobles when I put this backstory 
together (because you are about to see some more of them in future 
posts).  What I got from it, reading between the lines, is that the 
Imperium is so big that anything goes.

It depends on the specific order, at least that\'s how I\'m playing it. 
 Over 90% of the knight titiles cannot be transfered like this, but I 
put Frank into one of the few that could.

There is no where that specifically states this in the rules.  It is 
just the feeling I got throught the tone of the various noble 
articles I read.

Another thing that prompted me to do this was an aritcle in the JTAS 
(I think it was JTAS).  It said that, during character generation, if 
you roll an 11 or 12 for the first unmodified SOC role, then your 
character obtained the title either from birth or at an early age.  
This was true for the Frank character.

The article also said that if modifiers put the character in the 
noble bracket later in character generation, then that would 
approximate the time in his life that he received the title.

This article was one of the main reasons that I described Frank\'s 
title so.  Before I read it, I would have agreed 100% with your 
comment.

one last thing.  

The fuel used by all the starships is liquid hydrogen.  But to my
understanding it takes great pressure, or very cold temperatures to keep
hydrogen liquid.  How is this done.  It always says in the rule books that
it\'s just liquid hydrogen, but never details the container/tanks/or freezers
that it would have to be kept in.  Would it be in pressurized tanks, like
liquid nitrogen or liquid oxygen??

The problem is, how many additional sales would IG realize from the cheap 
versions, and would these additional sales more than make up for the 
production costs of producing two different versions.

I really don\'t think there are very many people would would buy a $20 book, 
but not a $25 one (and lets get realistic about how much a few colour 
prints adds to the price of a book).

As well, much has been said about how Traveller needs to "look" good on the 
store shelf to attract new players. I wholeheartedly agree with this 
sentement, and I really can\'t see a game in a 3-ring binder as anything 
other than really, really cheap.

	This idea sounds a heck of a lot like Star Fleet Battles - a model I

Tech 12.  It was simply Battle Dress done on the cheap; just enough power to

It was, I think, an attempt to add a little more reality.  Lasers would need
a little time to burn through ceramic or metal plates, and hand-held weapons
just couldn\'t deliver enough energy to make burn through with one pulse.
They could burn through cloth/kevlar with ease, along with flexible metal
armors like chainmail.  I liked this rule.. made laser armed snipers real
dangerous in rear areas when people took their helmets off.

A microjump is a jump that doesn\'t leave the local area.  Still takes all
the normal fuel, still lasts about seven days, but you pop out in the same
system.  While playing the Islands Campaign from TCS, I once microjumped my
fleet to the exact same place.  Imagine my opponent\'s surprise when the
fleet he had driven off comes right back with a week\'s worth of repair done..

I imagine that the tanks are pressurized and refrigerated, but that would
take a trivial amount of power.  For TNE, you could add a .001Mw per ton of
fuel carried requirement on the power plant; and perhaps require and extra
5% over on volume and weight.

I made the table, so yeah, I noticed (I just followed the pattern to

It takes a lot to get the USD up for lasers.  The rules for adding
weapons together are available if you want them.  Bay weapons are
one per battery, for example, small lasers can be added together.
ROF modifies the USD as well since we thought the combat system was
going to look more like HG.

Don\'t you think the name"Roger Young" should be reserved for a troop

Carrying a Company with a captain named Rico maybe?

THe problem I see with a binder system is the same as when TSR did it\'s
monster compendium\'s in a binder format.  Many sheets are lost!  And, if the
pages ar emade laminated, plastic, reinforced or whatever, it drives the
cost right up. 

This is unfortunate, as I like the binder format, but one thing I see is it
must be made single sided so that updates cn be added a lot easier than if
it\'s double sided and thngs get out of order.

 Not that it means anything specific to us, but even in areas
 that have a strong British influence (such as most of the
 states north and east of New York - a region we call New
 England), we don\'t have those kinds of names.  To us, those
 kinds of names are Just Not Done.  As a result, it sounds
 weird.

 Bell End isn\'t a problem for most Americans - it could easily
 be an exclusive neighborhood at the end of a peninsula or
 elongated island.

 On the other hand, names that we don\'t consider remarkable,
 such as those taken from tribal languages, would probably
 strike you as quite strange - for example:

 Mississippi
 Missouri
 Ohio
 Oklahoma
 Sioux City (pronounce "Soo City") (a city in South Dakota)
 Dakota (the name of two states, North and South)
 Connecticut
 Quogue (a town on Long Island)
 Amagansett (ditto)
 Manhattan (what most people think of when they think of New York)
 Chappaqua (a town north of New York City)

 This is quite true, although I was not consciously considering

 couple of days ago on the policy.

 Not entirely correct - comparisons with older Traveller
 products, and commentary based on knowledge of such is
 acceptable - see the review of T4, for example.  What\'s not
 acceptable is the kind of vituperation that has been seen in
 quite a number of the reviews of Starships posted here, which
 have all focussed on the bad points, without answering certain
 basic questions, such as "Is it _useful_?  Not _ideal_, but
 _useful_?", and concentrating on the superficialities (like the
 non-Travelleresqueness of the artwork) without catching some of
 the glaring flaws (like staterooms that have less than 4 m^2 of
 floor space, according to the information given on the plans).
 That kind of review is outright negative, and worse, it\'s not
 useful to the reader.  It would be a disservice to print
 something like that.

 I\'ll admit to being a little more lenient on _positive_ reviews -
 but even there, I want them to have _substance_, not just "Gee,
 this is neat!".

T::>(Sorry if I\'m putting words in your mouth here, Jeff!)

 Not at all - you\'ve done a reasonably good job of interpreting
 my words without having access to my thoughts.  If you\'re off
 the mark, it\'s _my_ fault for not explaining myself clearly
 enough.

There is a problem with this way of publishing material to overseas =

There\'s been a lot of discussion about T4\'s lack of a setting.  I thought 
it might be helpful to address the issue here.

Milieu 0 had been completely written by the beginning of November.  Since 
then, it\'s been in editing, typsetting, layout, and so on.  Presumably, 
they\'re taking extra time to avoid the typos and other errors that IG\'s 
current two products have exhibited.

The Milieu 0 book is scheduled to be released next month, or so I\'m told 
by Tim Brown, the project leader for Traveller RPG development.  So, if 
all goes well we\'ll have a setting before 2 months are up (hopefully 
sooner, but we know how these things go!).

In other news, I\'m told that CSC and Aliens are supposed to ship to 
direct-order customers by early next week (keep your fingers crossed).  
At the same time, they should be shipped to distributors.  Expect to see 
them in stores in early January.

decided to _not_ post the detail-y stuff about the Sunday Follies game. I don\'t like 
hosing the site of a recent bonfire with Napalm, if you get my meaning. 

Instead of posting the detaily stuff, I\'ll post instead an item of more general 
interest: a status report on the game as T4 demo, and the results.

The game is now up to 14(!) players. The once-quiet Sundays at the Grapevine are a thing 
of the past. The only people upset with  are the Magic players -- once the rulers of the 
roost here -- who are now reluctantly relegated to the former gaming table In The Back 
Of The Store. Take _that_, WotC!

Folks are coming in and Buying Stuff, which pleases the FLGSO to no bloody end. The 
store has sold every copy of T4 it has been able to get, and some other stuff as well. 
Not every player has a copy, but I\'m working on that ;)

The key now is to avoid becoming a victim of my own success. I\'m pretty well maxed out 
as far as the number of players in the game . . . which means that it is no longer 
really a "demo." I\'m also reaching the maximum as far as time I can devote to game prep 
each week . . . .

This week, I made use of _Starships_ stuff in the game. The Large Armed Freighter made a 
good Ardin Navy Q-Ship with the addition of boarding parties and damage-control 
crewmembers . . . .

A binder format is a REAL bad idea: witness the "Captain\'s Rulebook" for Star Fleet 
Battles ca. 1984. The thing looked LOUSY. IIRC, SJ Games once considered publishing 
GURPS books in that format . . . however, they got second thoughts and abandoned the 
idea.

_Starships_ showed me that IG does learn from its previous efforts, so I\'m happy to see 
this. I\'m willing to wait if the time spent waiting produces a superior product. I 
expect M0 to reflect these learning experiences.

Even though I\'m running a very nonstandard game, I expect to make some use of M0. I\'ll 
also buy it to avoid being clueless in any TML discussion about it. ;)

Ken, you claim to be a writer -- and I\'ve enjoyed some of the "backstories"
you\'ve posted to TML.  So you must know that writing, that communication,
is founded on details.  I agree that it\'s important to distinguish between
"Travelleresque" ships and those not so -- but a bare collection of "Yes"
and "No" votes won\'t do that, for IG or anybody, because it doesn\'t say
_WHY_.  I likewise feel that this is "simple," and am frustrated by our
apparent lack of connection.

With you in high hopes for Traveller, 4 or otherwise,

I greatly enjoyed the deck plans for the LINTULA SUNRISE (although for every

I once asked a friend who used to work for Task Force about putting stuff in 
three-ring binders. He said that the extra cost involved in making the sheets 
heavier/reinforced/laminated at best means that it costs the same as if it 
were bound.

Of course, it sounds like the proposal here is for the binder and art to be 
sold separately from the looseleaf contents, so it may end up being cheaper.  
Given the rise in paper prices since I asked about this, though, I somehow 
doubt it (although I like the idea).

K.C. Komosky responded:

It isn\'t really a case of two versions, because the art would simply be 
included as part of the binder rather than the looseleaf.  It\'s not two 
versions of the same product, rather it\'s two products.

Having the art on seperate loose-leaf pages would be really helpful as well,
as you could organize it where *you* wanted it, instead of where IG wants it
(which doesn\'t seem t agree with the majority of Traveller fans - at least
on this list).  For example, you could take it out of the rules alltogether
and shove it at the back of the binder.

I\'d be interested in hearing from someone at IG\\AP&D about how much the
binder format, with single-sided, reinforced (ie. built to last) pages would
cost in comparison to a normal, binded softcover book of similar size.

Thanks

<snip>

I would say Traveller is innovative; it provides a framework for a game
without a "God in a Box" key. Star Wars as the Force; Star Trek has the
Transporter that can cause or cure anything. Fantasy games have some
pantheon of deities or extra planar beings to fall back on for cause or
solution. Traveller has people. And people oriented problems and solutions.
The Ancients (Granfather) are incidental to functioning of the Imperium and
neighbors. Psionics, if you want to use them, and if you want to run near
Zhodane space, is still a people oriented effect, with the conflict created
by how different cultures view the same rare ability. We don\'t have a one
theme game. You really don\'t even need the Imperium(gasp), if you have the
time to build your own history.

If you mean from some other version of Traveller, that\'s hard to get around.
However, I do think one place Traveller has always been innovative, is in
it\'s character generation process.  I personally can\'t think of another game
which allows you to basically create a whole character before even playing
with them!  I love the character generation system, and personally can\'t
wait to see the return of advanced generation, ala MegaTraveller!

Thanks

First week of the year? I hate to just make this message a flame of IG, but
even they said the delay would _not_ be _this_ long...hopefully we\'ll
_never_ see delays of this duration again.

What exactly is Citizens offering?  The IG web page is pretty sketchy on
what is being offered, and I\'d personally like to kow more before jumping
aboard.

I don\'t know how many starship deckplans I\'ve seen that

In the late 60\'s General Electric invented powered armor.  They never did
finish the system, there were still unresolved control problems with the
legs, but the unit allowed a man to lift 1000lbs above his head.  The 
unit was built under  joint Army/Navy funding and known as the 
HARDIMAN Project.  I have the microfiche of the project reports.  It\'s
not armored and wasn\'t envisioned as armor.  It was meant to be used 
to allow a single man to restock bombs on fighter/bombers.  One of 
the test articles built to test the concept was an 18foot tall walker.

If you\'ve ever watched the Anime "Madox-01" you\'ll see a strong 
similarity.

But a model which seems to work for several current RPG\'s, and one that
many former wargamers and current/former military types are intimately
familiar with; it also allows easy reorganization of what you need for a
specific session.

Say, for example, the GM knows he\'ll need ship combat and personal combat,
but not CharGen, he can just put those into Report Covers, and turn the set
into special topics books. (Exactly what I do anyway with charts and
tables. And SFB.)

Also, He could flop CGen in front of the new guy, while continuing to use
the rest of the stuff himself, or hand worldbuilding to the guy who\'s
character is in low berth til they hit a planet that can heal him. The
three ring approach is BETTER for RPG\'s than wargames.

Michael Barry.....Michael.Barry@finance.ausgovfinance.telememo.au

I\'d like each of you four to send me the snailmail address you\'d like

reviewed the index. Shame on you! :-)  And, yes, Michael, I\'m aware
you\'re in Oz (wish I was).

I appreciate the effort you all went to and I especially appreciate

need to send the compilation to.

Once I\'ve kicked the copies off to the appropriate people at IG and
its affiliates, I\'ll send the errata (and fixes, including those
posted by Wildstar) to the 1st 3 people with a Traveller Web page who
request it. Please understand that the list of errata is simply too
huge to post to the TML, even in stages. It encompasses 198 errata
items (with fixes for some of them) on the equivalent of 15
single-spaced pages (and I used a _small_ font).

If you\'d like to have a copy emailed to you for posting on a home page,
email me your email address, Home Page URL, and state whether you\'d like
it in ASCII (text format, that is) or RTF format. I can\'t (ok, I won\'t)
send it to anyone other than the 1st 3 requests because my overtime
starts again day after tomorrow and I simply won\'t have time. I work for
an airline and the holidays are the worst at starpo...er, airports.
Apologies, but that Reality critter can really be a pain sometimes.

Agreed on all your points!  Perhaps, just perhaps IG could produce this in a
limited quantity available via the web page as kind of a test product of
some sort.  I for one would love to get a old of this (that is, the T4
rulebook in this form), and I\'m sure others participating in this thread
would as well.

Joe, perhaps you could bring these comments to the ears of IG?

        This is a slight exaggeration; the largest handout I did was only
24 pages; if the players are going to be doing London during the Blitz, I
think that a minimum should include maps, social history complete with
fashions since the end of the Great War, description of the civil defence
measures, and a glossary of common slang, no?

IMHO leaving a ship in jumpspace is a bonehead maneuver. One of two 
things could have happened to your cutter:

1) Using the most common interpretation of canon:

Since the cutter left the protective jumpspace "bubble" generated by the 
Lanthanum grid of the starship and it has no protective jumpspace field 
of its own, it is irrevocably lost in the depths of the jumpspace 
dimension and/or destroyed instantly.

ie. you\'re dead.

2) Using my own twist on Jumpspace Theory:

If I were ref, I would assign a chance of the ship\'s survival. Oh, I\'d 
say off the top of my head, a 10+ on 2d6 chance of survival. (Just to 
make it sporting)

Since the cutter left the jumpspace "bubble" generated by the Lanthanum 
grid, it is no longer a virtual hyper-lightspeed (tachyon) particle in 
jumpspace and immediately naturally "precipitates" into normal space. 
Since the precipitation is uncontrolled and non-uniform, it is therefore 
unpredictible. Essentially the cutter misjumps. The roll above is used to 
determine whether the misjump is treated as a < 10 diameter jump, or a < 
100 dia. jump. Whether you misjump near an inhabited system or not is up 
to serendipity.

See page 116 of your T4 rulebook for misjump rules.

Some would say my above explanation neglects the fact that the cutter has 
to "pierce through" the protective bubble of the starship, and so at one 
instant is partially inside and partially outside the bubble, making 
survival increasingly unlikely. (*part* of the ship precipitates, part 
remains... ouch... boom) I rather like keeping things sporting and 
exciting, so I would give the survival roll and say "Miraculously, the 
electromagnetic charge of the cutter managed to drag part of the 
jumpspace field just long enough for the ship to precipitate into normal 
space relatively unharmed, unfortunately, your ship has misjumped... 
let\'s see if you\'re lucky enough to end up near a civilized world... 
<evil grin>"

>could someone tell me what jumpspace is supposed to look like?

The general description of jumpspace as viewed through a porthole of ship 
is a hazy uniform grayness. People who stare long enough tend to go 
insane or become otherwise mentally unbalanced -- if they aren\'t already.

Well, it sounds as if you are refering to the "Commander\'s Editon"
actually.  The "Captain\'s Edition", which came out in 1990, looked much
better.  

The trick to presenting a game in a binder system well lies in the
organization and editing department, though.  If it is improperly
organized, pages integrated from different sources can contradict each
other, and the binder soon becomes a mish-mash of pages (as in the
Commander\'s Edition of SFB).  OTOH, if the rules are very well organized
and potential contradictions within the rules are averted by intellegent
editing (as in the Captain\'s Edition of SFB), the binder format is a
viable format.  Unfortunately, the editing staff at IG has demonstrated
that they cannot even handle the editing requirements in a normal book
format.  

However, I have been thinking of cutting up my T4 books and putting them
into a binder anyway.  Altough I love the Chris Foss color plates, I\'m
getting sick and tired of some of the ones I can\'t even imagine having
anything to do with the Traveller universe.  Also, the ones that are
bunched in the middle of the Starships book are getting particularly
annoying due to their placement in the middle of the tables.

If you ask me your players should be very happy to have a GM willing to
give them that kind of reference material.  I personally think such things
are invaluable to players, especially when it\'s a setting they aren\'t
familiar with.

So true... many Americans I\'ve spoken to surpressed a giggle when I told 
them I was from Saskatoon, Saskatchewan.

(Try saying it real fast)

You can pick out the \'mercans and easterners (like from Ontario) by the 
way they say "Saskatchewan". Out here on the bald prairie, the last 
syllable is pronounced "one" like the number.

Most yanks say "So, yer from Sask-atcher-whaaahhhn, huh?"

The coupon in the back of Starships mentions a quarterly newsletter, 
registration of a character (you get a certificate back, and no one else 
can register a char with the same stats), 10% discount on mail orders, a 
dog tag with the char\'s stats, "plus special offers for members."  $15.

Heh... I think I just played to much Star Fleet Battles and Advanced

In the SOM, it describes what jumpspace looks like.  It says that all 
you can see from inside the ship (and, therefore, all anybody\'s ever 
seen) is a dull gray, featureless bubble around the ship.

There\'s a very quick seen in Star Wars that has this same effect, and 
I always use it as a good example of what Traveller jumpspace looks 
like.

The Millenium Falcon is going into hyperspace, and 
for a moment, you see the whiteish-gray tunnel approach the ship.  It 
is only there for a moment, but if you have the film on tape, you\'ll 
see what I mean.

the lyrics are crap. Here\'s my suggestion along the same lines for Milleau 0:

"God save our gracious Emperor,
Long live our noble Emperor,
God save the Emperor!
Send him victorious,
Happy and Glorious,
Long to reign over us;
God save the Emperor!"

Hmmmmm.......Doesn\'t read like the far future eh?

Also, the advert on the back page of Starships would put me off buying any
more T4 products if I were a newby to Traveller. Any publisher that exhorted
me to cut out coupons (and therefore destroying the last page of the SSDS) and
"buy MORE BOOKS!!!!!!!" would get nothing from me.

Imperium Games had better get its act together. I\'m an avid Traveller fan -
but I had the urge to physically rip the Starships book to bits while I was
reading it - It\'s what someone in IG should have done to the final draft.

Still waiting for someone to tell me it was just a bad dream.......

        Dunno where to buy a pre-made d3.  Mine I made by filling in holes
on the 4, 5, & 6 sides of a white d6 using liquid paper.  Ugly, but it
works.  And it annoys the hell out of Ross,  who\'s allergic to d3\'s, it
seems.

        I\'m tempted to do a special d3 just for him by adding dots to the
1, 2, and 3 sides, but I figure he might catch on eventually when the
lowest he ever rolled on a d3 would be 4.

        I was thinking the same thing; high population density, high income
disparity, heavy urbanization.  As far as absolute poverty level goes,
well, I was figuring on following the "What is poverty at TL-12" sidebar...

Basically he states that since the smaller ship is within 10 diameters of
the other ship\'s gravity well (small though it is), the smaller ship

        The Jump Drive formula for all Jump Numbers is:

        Volume [m3] = ( Jump Number + 1 ) * ( Hull Displacement / 100 ) * 14 m3
        Mass  [ton] = Volume * 3 (Volume * 2.5 in TL-14, Volume *2 in TL-15)
        Area   [m2] = Volume / 3
        Price [MCr] = Volume * 0.3

        I used this kind of formulas in my starship design spreadsheet,
        but I still had to include several look-up tables for other
        components.

I absolutely agrre on this.  Since IG needs to get new players to thrive
it IMHO was a reasonable choice to use Chriss Foss art (there is a good
choice that many people know him if they are interested in SF and thus
your chances are good that they might try *your* game since you utilize
Chris Foss art).

I\'m not a hardcore Traveller fan but I own many roleplaying games and thus
feel like commenting: no, I don\'t think that there is anything innovative
about T4.  It\'s rather a collection of stuff (IMHO some good, some bad) of
things that appeared in past editions of Traveller and people wanted to
see back.  Some things in Traveller (not necessarily in T4) are nice.
Personally I e.g. like the simple way of describing worlds with UWPs in a
very short way (although one needs to get used a little to that).  But
innovative... nada.

Personally I don\'t believe that a game needs to be innovative to be good.
There seem to be a couple of systems on the market which really try to be
different but all the effort amounts to new vocabulary for old stuff and
strange dice methods being used.  I always liked Dangerous Journeys (and
there was nothing truly innovative in it... it just combined good and
tried systems into a new whole).

1. I think the picture/stat pages would have been done better using the TNE
format, the picture is in the frame and the page is white rather than the
stats in the frame and the page black.

2. I do not consider the "deckplans" to be true deckplans.  I am happy to
see the virtical aspect of the decks being at least considered, but I am
very disappointed in the "deckplans."

3. I really like the Foss color art.  No, it is not "Travelleresque" (that
word ranks right up there with "canon" on my hated word list).  I don\'t have
a definition of what is Travelleresque, but some of the Foss pics aren\'t
what I expect from the Traveller universe, but I do like them and I am
willing to accept some of them .  The ship pics are ok, some of them really
jumped out at me and said Traveller is back, others barely even lifted their
heads and said nothing at all.

Overall (without having read the text) I say that the book is not worth the
full $20 in and of itself, but for completeness sake, I am glad I got it.
If the SSDS is identical to what Dave created, then I will be a bit
disappointed.  As I have mentioned before, SSDS and QSDS need to be related
more than coming from the same parent.  I can\'t speak on the editing or
writing yet, but I will submit a complete review when I finish reading the
sparse text. :)

Ah, but you have something else. You have the mothballed ships of four
recent years of conflict ready to be recommisioned in 1/10th of the time
and at 1/10th of the cost it takes to build new ones. Surely the Domain
(and propably Corridor) shipyards must have been building warships full
time during the Fifth Frontier War. That\'s four year\'s production at
full wartime tax rates hanging around, which would amount to something
like at least 50% of the peacetime navy (Much more if the shipyards
actually expand in size in wartime). And they can be ready in 24 weeks for
the largest of them. That\'s too long for the ones in Corridor to be
recommisioned in time to be sent off to Lucan (Lucan\'s order to the
Corridor Fleet arrived in early 1117 according to _Rebellion_), but they\'d
be ready a few months later, just in time to welcome the Vargr. And so
would those of the Domain.

In fact, the Imperium may have a lot more mothballed ships than that 
floating around. Remeber that _Arrival Vengeance_ is scheduled for
reactivation in 1123? Given that reactivating mothballed ships is a so
much more efficient way to utilize your shipyard capacity than building
new ships (10 times faster and 10 times cheaper) you would think that
the shipyards would recommision everything they could before beginning
new construction. Since a given shipyard capacity can recommision roughly
3 ships per year, the shipyards at Trin ought to have recomissioned about
18 time their capacity in 1123. Even at 20% of the shipyard capacity that
TCS would give Trin, it would work out at roughly 36 million tons of ship.
If every big Imperial shipyard has similar numbers of mothballed ships
hanging around we can get the Domain Navy up to snuff in very short order.

Yes, you\'re right, except that the figure dosen\'t include any auxiliaries.

Let\'s have a look at those figures and see if the Kinunir Syndrome has struck
again: 

That would make the total Imperial strength roughly 20,000 fighting ships. 
Let\'s double that to account for any and all auxiliaries, scouts, couriers, 
etc. What would be the average tonnage of those ships? Let\'s say 100,000 
and let\'s put an average price of MCr 0.75 per ton on that. That would make 
the cost of the entire  peacetime Imperial Navy 3,000,000,000 MCr (or 3,000 
trillion credits). This would make the total Navy budget of the Imperium 
300 TCr per year and account for 30% of all navy spending of Imperial 
planets, making the total amount of money spent on navy and planetary 
defense 1,000 TCr per year. With 15 trillion citizens in the Imperium that 
would make the per capita payment 67 Cr per citizen. This would be nudged 
upwards a bit by unfavourable exchange rates for some planets, so let\'s call 
it Cr100 per citizens. That\'s about 0.6% of the GPP for all Imperial planets. 
Does that seem a bit low to you? It certainly does to me. But apparently 
Imperial planets don\'t use more than 20% of the minimum peacetime budget 
defined in TCS. Well, that does make things a bit tougher for the Imperium. 
But it\'s not enough to save the Aslans or the Vargr.

There\'s two possible explanations for the low figure: 1) TCS is wrong and
general economics prevent planets from spending much more than 100 Cr
per citizen in peacetime and 150 Cr in wartime. Or 2) The Imperium felt
so secure that it didn\'t bother to use it\'s full potential.

Situation 1) fails the reality test, of course, but I\'m not too hung up on 
reality. My particular interest in these matters is consistency. And for 
consistency\'s sake, the Aslan and Vargr navies would be similarily affected, 
leaving us with the same situation as before only at a lower level.

2) means that the Imperium is worse equipped to deal with Aslans and Vargr
in 1117, but it also means that they can get up to TCS levels given enough
time. They may indeed lose most of Corridor, but for how long? The Domain
will go from Cr100 per citizen to Cr750 per citizen and start a massive
building effort. I suppose that we must assume that the Imperial shipyards
are also only at 20% of their potential max, but even that is impressive.
Remember Mikesh in Corridor? Instead of 200 TCr Squadrons to defend them
they only have 40 to begin with. Still too hard a nut for the Vargr to crack.

Situation 2) _also_ means that every comparable rival of the Imperium has 
fleet levels comparably low, which implies that The Solomani Confederation,
the K\'Kree, and the Zhodani navies are similarily underbudgeted (Since the
Aslans and Vargr are so disorganized they may have had full naval spending 
without triggering paranoia in the Imperial High Command  --  though I doubt
it, given the military definition of the word "threat"). That too seems to
fail the reality test given the tensions between them.

There\'s also the possibility that the average of 100,000 per ship is off
by the missing amount and is actually 500,000. That would mean that a
large number of the battleships are 1,000,000 T ships, each one capable of
protecting a star system from aquisitive Aslans and voracious Vargr.

Or perhaps... Ah, if you look on page 27 in _Rebellion_ is states that the
1000 ship figure includes cruisers, carriers, battleSHIPs, and escorts. Now,
I think that the author propably meant battleriders too. But the text dosen\'t
actually mention battleriders. So maybe the figure dosen\'t include 
battleriders. If a carrier plus it\'s riders are counted as one ship then 
quite lot more firepower can be packed into those 1000 ships.

You may be right. I chose 20,000 for my example because they are the biggest
cruisers that can be bult in the shortest possible time. Besides, a 20,000 T
TL 14 cruiser ought to be more or less a match for a 30,000 T TL 13 cruiser.
If not, we\'ll just gang up 2 to 1 on those pesky Vargr.

Yes, but this is predicated on the assumption that it would take a lot of
ships to stop the Vargr, which is actually not the case.

Others have answered this, but it really isn\'t necessary to know (although
it helps ;-). All you need is to assume that such strength is proportionate 
to the size of the population. In other words, that a Vargr world with X 
people can support roughly as many tons of warships as an Imperial world 
with X people. Oh, and also that Imperial, at least, use roughly 70% of 
their budget on planetary defense forces.

You\'re missing the crucial point about the Vargr. Unlike the Aslans, who are 
prepared to pay for the land they take in blood and ships, and unlike the 
Imperium, who taxes their people to build their ships, Vargr corsairs are 
supposed to make a profit. Where an Imperial fleet commander only has to 
worry about wether he can defeat the opponent, the Vargr fleet commander has 
to select a target that he can capture without using too much ammunition, 
taking too much battle damage, AND DOING TOO MUCH DAMAGE TO THE TARGET IN 
THE PROCESS!!! Attacking armed opponents is not a profitable business
unless you have overwhelming odds. So the best defended Imperial planets
would be safe because it would take far too many ships to attack them. It
would take the ressources of 630 billion TL 13 Vargr to achieve 3 to 1 odds
against Mikesh, for example. (Or if it\'s true that the Imperium only uses
20% of what it ought to on its fleet, a measly 126 billion Vargr). How many
it will take when you consider that the leaders of the Vargr that are 
paying for the ships passionately wants the leaders of the ships to stay
home is left to your imagination).

Secondly, a grand alliance of Vargr leaders is a very strange thing, seeing 
that a Vargr Ruler-type leader has almost diametrically opposite interests 
from a Corsair-type leader. A Vargr leader wants to keep his ships home to 
defend his worlds against the corsairs from further coreward. (If you were 
a Vargr corsair would you prefer to raid a Vargr world a few parsecs away 
or would you go 10-20 parsecs across another Vargr state to attack the 
Imperial and hope you could get your loot back home without being ambushed?)
The Corsair wants to steal the ruler\'s ships, go to the Imperium and take
over some world and become an independent ruler himself.

A warship costs ~MCr0.75 per ton, so that would translate as 2 tons per
month or 24 per year. Let\'s call it 25 T of ship per 100 employees.

TCS says that a world\'s shipyard construction capacity is equial to 1 ton
per 1000 citizens (modified by the government modifier which runs from .50
to 1.2 in peacetime). 

That would be 25000 citizens per 100 shipyard employees. That would make
the shipyard sector from 0.4 to 2% of the population depending on how many
dependents a shipyard worker has (I don\'t think more than 4 dependents on
the average is reasonable, do you?). Personally I\'d say that 1% sounds
about right.

Since the average naval budget is 3% of the GPP I\'d say those figures match.

In peacetime it takes 138 weeks to build a 50,000 T ship. So you\'d need
about 800,000 T of shipyard construction capacity to build 6 50,000 T
cruisers per year, which requires a population of 800 million. But there
are many worlds with 10 times that many citizens and some with 80 times 
that. So some worlds can produce 500 heavy cruisers per year. (Not for
long, of course. Building 500 heavy cruisers would use up about half
the naval budget for that world.) In wartime the speed could be increased
by about 40%.

Also, since we\'re talking about a non-jump capable vessel leaving a
jump-capable vessel, I think the end result would be the same as with
anything else dumped outside of a ship in j-space, i.e., it\'s lost forever.

Even if the ship\'s boat managed to return to n-space, it would most likely
apppear in the middle of nowhere, light years from the nearest star system,
with only an m-drive (if it\'s still in one piece) to run on . . .

A valid criticism of CT, but T4 has solved this problem by making its
ordinary char-gen system produce power-house characters. If you were to
use Mercenary to generate advanced marine characters now, they would
never be able to compete with their T4 comrades.

I wouldn\'t mind seeing a beefed-up version of the advanced char-gen
system, one that kept skill levels compatable with the ordinary system.
In fact, I use one right now. I allow my players to use books 4-7, but I
don\'t require them to roll for skill eligibility; skill rolls come
automatically once per year.

Actually, I\'m designing a battalion sized drop ship to be named the "Matthew

ship, and the "Richard Marcinko" Special Operations Lander.

The difference is though, that the Cutter isn\'t jumpspace capable. Marc
was describing one starship "jumping" from another. ie. activating its
lanthanum grid. I would think this is even more dangerous than just
leaving the ship. I envision the jumpspace field as being a very
delicate and precisely controlled thing. To introduce another jump field
within the current one would upset the <handwave ON> tachyon particle
field density and jumpspace vector transit energy <handwave OFF> thereby
destroying both vessels, or at the very least causing both to misjump.

Interesting, I didn\'t recall that. Perhaps Joe\'s description
unconsciously lodged itself within my brain only to resurface later :-)
According to the rules in T4, though, they changed it so a ship is
*always* destroyed if it jumps within 10 diameters of a gravity well.
(see p.116 of T4 rulebook) I don\'t like the *always destroyed* change in
the rules. It\'s too absolute. I prefer MT misjump rules.

Using a x dia. limit for starships is problematic and an
oversimplification, in my mind. In my game, the 10 dia. is a "rule of
thumb" used because making the actual calculations of "gravitic tidal
force potential" (or other such mumbo-jumbo) is too time consuming.
Without doing any calculations, I think the misjump limit for a starship
would be within a few meters from its centre of mass.

There\'s not a lot of canon to draw on on here, and some of what we do have
conflicts.  However, the consensus seems to be that if you leave the "jump
bubble" surrounding a jump-capable ship (and opinions as to the thickness
and shape of that bubble vary widely), you die.  Immediately.

Now, the *details* of what kills you are again open to debate.  My own
homebrew description is that normal matter tossed unshielded into
jumpspace basically "misjumps" on a particle-by-particle basis, with
partial conversion to energy in the process.  In other words, you wind up
turned into a collection of subatomic particles and extremely high-energy
photons, scattered over a 36-parsec radius.  Pretty thorough death,
that...

> Also could someone tell me what jumpspace is supposed to look like?

Again, not much canon to go on.  For my own purposes, I\'ve swiped Larry
Niven\'s "blind spot" effect -- a window looking out into jumpspace simply
disappears, the windowframe contracting down to a point, so to speak.  For
this reason, most ships keep windows covered while in jumpspace.  This is
a psionic effect; a photograph of the same window will show utter
blackness outside.  This concept makes a nice piece of "color," I think.

If you insist on using CT rules, you are perfectly free to do so: I was
just trying to propose an alternative for those who don\'t. Maybe in CT,
military ships don\'t cost more than civilian types, but there I think
there\'s ample reason to believe they ought to.

Since I have TNE but not T4, I can\'t speak to when the Vargr get kicked out
of corridor.

We??  Have to??  I\'m not saying anybody has to use anything.
My proposal is just so others will have something else to work

That\'s exactly what I\'m talking about. IMO, those rates are unrealistically
high for a single world, and ought to be about a tenth that.

As a matter of fact, I hadn\'t worked that out yet. The best I could do
anyway is to suggest maximum probable limits. A world\'s UWP can suggest its
potential industrial capacity, but whether it builds starhips or asteroid
mining equipment or somesuch else is up to the referee.
Come to think of it, "shipyard production workers" is a bad term: "Starship
construction industry workers" is better, but that\'s still a mouthful.

Maybe four guys could *install* the laser turret in half a day-- but where
I come from, weapon\'s turrets don\'t exactly grow on trees. Somebody has to
build the things. Many of the starship\'s components will be manufactured
elsewhere by different people, and then assembled. By the time you get to
the components of the components, you\'re talking about a noticeable
fraction of the whole planet\'s industrial base. That sounds better to me
anyway.

> However, I don\'t follow your last sentence quoted above... what
> "benefits" are we talking about here?

The "benefits" of a military vessel are, of course, its ability to break
things and hurt people. What can a 17 trillion credit heavy battleship do
that 350,000 armed scout craft at 50 MCr each can\'t? Maybe bigger is
better, maybe not.

IMO, The heaviest battleships the imperium can build should be roughly
comparable to WWII battleships or modern nuclear aircraft carriers.
There are only a few of them, and once lost, they can\'t be replaced
overnight. Maybe only one or two worlds in an entire sector can even build
the biggest ones at all.

Once again, Kenneth and I are on opposite ends of the spectrum.
Personally, for basic ruleset completenes, playability, and even editing,
DGP did it best: MegaTraveller.

The more I see of T4, the more I think Marc Miller hath made a HUGE mistake
by not going with DGP for T4, or at least someone who was familiar with
traveller. (No offense to the guys at IG, but y\'all just ain\'t got
traveller in your SOULS.)

What\'s more, I think that T4 has been Totally integrety-challenged by IG\'s
production schedule, editing, and such.

 ----

All the ships in the "Roger Young" class are capable of been converted
to troop/assault carriers by using 100 ton modules which can be carried
in the cargo bay. The ship\'s surplus power can be transferred to the
modules
for heating,lighting and life support. The ship\'s weaponry can be used
from orbit
for Bombardment or as "on call" close support fire as required.

100 ton troop module(carries 36 infantry) consists of
15 bunks
3 small staterooms(2 Officer\'s or 2 N.C.O.\'s each)
1 Armory
1 common area
1 Gym

100 ton cutter module holding
3-30 ton cutter modules(passenger modules or ATV. modules for use by the
ship\'s
50 ton cutters. These have to be loaded onto the cutters from outside)

When the modules are secured in the cargo hold they all interrconnect
with each other
for easy access by either the infantry teams or the ATV. crews.

Good show, Andy.  Get back up on the box anytime.  I agree 100%.

I disagree 100%.  My vote (and all of yours count).  I don\'t think 
the people should be disuaded from stating their opinions in this 
manner.

If I like something, I\'ll post it.  If I don\'t like something, then 
I\'ll post that too.  Any comments that I make, as a final consumer of 
the T4 products, is important.

I always disregard those posts that say, "Well, IG could have done it 
that way but it would cost too much."  

I think that is crap.  If there is a market for it, and the product 
meets the needs of the market, people will buy it.

All of our opinions count.

Ahh, it can\'t be that bad, can it?

I really liked MT, but I think T4 is a tincy wincy bit better.  Heck, 
it\'s going back to its roots!

LOL

Probably.  DGP is by far the best producer of Traveller products that 
I\'ve ever seen.

And, to produce quality Traveller material, it should be more than a 
job.  

I\'d love it if I did that for a living.

Yes, I\'m getting worried.

I don\'t have a problem with the ships in M0 looking different than 
M1100.  I do have a problem with two things though.  

1)  I think that the Foss ships are not what I want the M0 ships to 
look like.  

2)  I think that the ships in M0 should be somewhat different from 
the M1100 ships--not just the picture.  Slapping a new picture with 
the same old ship stats bothers me.

	Absolutely. I hope that IG et al does consider any and all advice that may 
be garnered from the TML. T4 isn\'t going to sell very well if the die-hards 
(namely all of us) don\'t even like some aspect of it, since we all almost 
by definition will buy anything with the Traveller logo on it.

Okay, I was with you up to here Kenneth. If something would cost IG a lot 
of money, that equals higher retail prices, which WILL effect wether there 
is a market for it.

So before we all go spouting off our next \'brilliant idea\' (gold-plated 
collectors editions of T4! yah!), considering the cost of it is certainly 
important.

Well Ken,

I understand your point.  However, few of our fans either choose not to or
do not know how to use... Tact.  It is alright to say you are "disapointed"
in certain aspects, however, T4 is bringing in new customers to this list
everyday, and when they get on this mailing list all they here is everyones
crap.

It is this kind of negative talk that will distroy the thing we all love,
Traveller.  So when you deside to not like something, do Traveller a favor
and use some Tact.  Point out the good qualities as well as the bad.  And
if there we no good qualities then take the advice that was given to
Thumper....

...If you can\'s say anything nice, dont say anything at all.

How you react may deternine the future of this game, and if you dont care
about this game, then maybe you should find a game that means alot to you
and find that maining list.

Thanx for your time,

Ken Whitman

   No, that would be opinion in a court of law.

   The evidence simply does not support this statement.  In fact, the
evidence submitted thus far (some of the most incriminating by IG
itself) supports *just the opposite conclusion*.

   This is not to say that T4 is the worst incarnation of Traveller
ever.  Anyone who suffered through the first printing of MegaTraveller
knows that its record for pain and suffering inflicted upon the masses
will be hard to top.  It is also still possible that five years from now
we will all be here having a discussion about the early days of T4 and
someone will say, "remember all the problems Imperium Games had getting
T4 started? Man, it\'s a wonder they survived, but look what they\'ve
accomplished since."  

   I\'m sure that Imperium Games appreciates your enthusiasm.  I wish I
could share it.

Hey, this is a game, a product, not a person. We\'re not going to hurt 
anyones feelings. I really don\'t think we need to dance around this issue. 
If I fell something is \'crap\', then I sure as hell am going to point that 
out! I\'ll point out the good qualities if and only if its relevent.

Give me a break! You don\'t want to see any negaive comments? Well, while I 
wish I could love every single Traveller product in existance, I don\'t.

Are we supposed to all be good-little sales-drones for IG? This is not 
rec.games.traveller.advocacy, for petes sake! Its a meeting of minds of 
Traveller fanatics. Unless IG wants to hire me on as a consultant, I\'m 
going to say and write whatever I think - damn the consequences (well, 
short of anything liberlous, or whatever). If IG prints a crappy book, is 
it my fault for pointing that out?

As to finding a new game, don\'t you get it? Anyone who is slagging 
Starships (or whatever) is doing it BECAUSE they love the game of 
Traveller. If someone didn\'t care about it, they wouldn\'t be sending in 
long e-mails to TML. They\'d just quietly disappear, never to be heard from 
again.

As a hard-core right-wing person (politically speaking), I firmly believe 
in the principle of "tough love".  Doing the nicest, soft-hearted thing is 
quite often not the best in the long run. If IG prints an awful T4 book, 
saying negative comments may well hurt some sales in the short term, but if 
the comments and sentiments are taken to heart by IG, then the end result 
will be improved sales because of a better product.

I will say that as lovers of the Traveller franchise, it may be more 
helpful to point out specific ways for things to improve, or specifics on 
what is missing rather than just "its shit!". But as to scrambling around 
trying to point out the "good qualities" of a product we hate, thats not 
going to achieve anything.

Wait a minute..who said that?  Ken posted HIS opinion, which, may or may not
be the list majority\'s view.  However, he is entitled to thgat opinon, and
if we can allr emember, is NOT representing IG in anyway.

I don\'t think we need a list split again, I think we\'re all adult enough to

<snippage>

I just went through the TL-15 ships in MT Fighting Ships of the Imperium,
and it appears that the average cost used in TCS is a truly gross
oversimplification. Among TL-15 ships, Tankers cost around .1-.2 MCr/T;
battle tenders and carriers at .3 MCr/T; light escorts in the .5-.75 MCr/T
range; light cruisers about 1.2 MCr/T; Fighters, Heavy cruisers, light
battleships, dreadnoughts, and light battle riders around 4-6 MCr/T; and
the heaviest craft with equally hefty price tages of 16-25 MCr/T.
Checking with TNE gives costs of around .5 MCr/T for the smaller civilian
types. Such variability in ship costs does bad things to your calculations
on shipbuilding capacities. 

If you keep your TCS assumptions of 1 T per thousand imperial citizens, and
use .5 MCr/T as an average base cost, you get annual shipyard capacity of
500 MCr per million citizens, or (for instance) 15 million MCr for your
world of 30 billion. Comparing that with MT\'s 3 million MCr for a 700 kT
Dreadnought gives a production figure I can live with. I think I could
accept figures and rates based on MT, TNE, or T4 ship prices.

Another thing that I overlooked is that the figures you have been giving
seem to be theoretical maximun values for production of one kind of craft
only. In practice, a world (left to itself) would produce a mix of
different kinds of ships, which means fewer of any given type.

Now that I\'m more firmly convinced I mostly right all along :-), thanks for
the information and discussion. I admit to having been prejudiced against
TCS, and having an even worse impression when I saw some of your figures,
but it looks like only minor fixes are needed to make it sound and
compatible with later Traveller.

Don & Ken,

*Warning major RANT mode on * 

Both of you are speaking in haste and in anger.  There is no reason 
to vote for a net split because *ONE*  person who does not speak for 
IG or AP&D or SweetPea (read that Traveller) in any official capacity shoots 
off and tells everyone to shut up and stop bitching.  Seen IG\'s web 
page, since Dec 2?

I\'ll bitch at him, I\'ll bitch at you and I\'ll bitch at 
IG/AP&D/SweetPea if its appropriate.  Thats as much what this list is 
for as it is hooraying over the fact that a new version of Traveller 
is here and arguing relativistic rocks.

Personally, I am trying to support T4 as much as possible.  There are 
problems with T4, there are major problems with Starships.  I\'ll call 
a spade a spade.  But everyone else has already said what needs 
saying and I won\'t do the "me too" thing, wastes bandwidth, you know.

Now, as far as how we are representing ourselves to The New Blood... 
I do believe that is a concern.  But I will *not* impinge on anyone\'s 
free speech because I am concerned about how the newbies are going to 
react to my (or anyone else\'s) criticism.  Nor will I accuse anyone 
who criticizes a game they love enough to wade through this mailing 
list every day of not caring about it.

We *all* care.  We *all* want Traveller to do well.  We *all* want 
perfect products.  We may differ on what a perfect product is, but 
its what we want.  Which is why we are all here, and on #traveller, 
and harassing our local FLGS over when is <insert new IG product 
here> is coming in.  

Well, I\'ve done my bitching for the year.  I\'m going to get back into 
my civilized suit again and crawl back to #traveller where the flames 
are less intense.

OK, rant mode off.

Ok, I spoke in haste, and I apologize to the list.  God, I feel like I\'m 
selling this game for IG, and they keep dropping the ball - and my morale
snapped.  Actually, I feel better being slammed for this - it tells me
others care too...

Thanks! (for the flame!)

Huh?  MegaTraveller.  Are you playing the same game I run William?  
Are we talking about the Same MegaTraveller whose errata runs 25 
single space pages for the 3 basic books?  The MegaTraveller who as 
they were printed had a broken Advanched Merchant 
Character Generation system, a broken Starship Construction 
system, and a Starship Combat system that was totally useless as it 
was originally printed?  Don\'t get me wrong, I run a bug squashed MT 
as my system of choice, and probably will until the rest of the main 
body of T4 comes out, but compared to MT, T4 is bug free.

Are we talking about the DGP of Joe Fugate, Rob Caswell, Mike 
Vilardi, et al, or the one of Roger Sanger?  There\'s a world of 
difference there, my friend.  The creative body of the DGP of the 
CT/MT days is LONG gone, and from all appearances, they ain\'t coming 
back.

Of course, the only way to interpret this statement is to take 
offense.  I dispute this statement, when you consider that a couple 
of IG staffers have worked on Traveller related stuff for GDW in the 
past.

How does a production schedule challenge integrity?  Frustrate those 
like myself who placed orders, yes, challenge the integrity of the 
product?  Doubtful.  If anything, a slower approach to pushing new 
product out the door SHOULD result in a better product.  Editing, OK, 
but NO edition of Traveller has escaped editing problems, including the 
hallowed and holy little black books.

Loren could probably answer this one better, but there were 3 
editions put out of the MT rules, AFAIK.

The 1st edition, frankly, was atrocious.  25 pages of errata just to 
remove the errors.
The most glaring of the problems were:
Broken Advanced Merchant Generation
**Missing Special Duty Tables
**No Pilot Skill for Free Trader Merchant Characters.

Broken Starship/Vehicle Design
**Several bugs in numerical ratings for various ship components
**Several Columns in tables mislabelled.

Broken Starship/Combat Rules
**Combat rules mislabelled ranges for various sensors
**Some Combat Tables omitted

Broken Weapons Tables

The Second edition cleaned up some, but not all of the errors.
The Third edition were basically bug free.  A few minor problems, but 
nothing serious.

IMHO, even the Second edition of MegaTraveller was worse that T4 1st 
Printing.  It can be worse, and it has been in the past.

   This is a bastion of free speech.  Occasionally people vent their
spleens, but for the most part the posts are constructive.  Those that
get too far out of line hear about it, believe it.  

   It is assumed that the subscribers to this list realize that it
contains the good, the bad and the ugly in the way of Traveller and that
you are adult enough to know the difference and not get your feelings
hurt and take it all personally because somebody said a mean thing.  If
we disagree strongly at times, it is because we feel passionately about
a particular subject.  I hold no personal grudges because of something
that was said here, and I would expect that no one else would either.

   The day this list resorts to Politically Correct speech is the day I
will unsubscribe myself from it, permanently.  

   This is not a forum for generating sales.  People are going to give
their honest opinions of product because they want the product to be
better, or they want to express their pleasure with it.  If the comments
on product are generally negative, then it is because there is something
wrong with it--in our humble opinions.

   Don\'t put the weight of Traveller\'s failure or success on our
shoulder\'s Ken.  Because if Traveller can be killed by our little group
of electronic know-it-alls, then it was going to die anyway.

A micro-jump works just like a jump-1 except that your target is a less

Pressure *won\'t* liquefy hydrogen unless the temp is very, very low
anyway. Ditto for oxygen and nitrogen.

All gases have a set of related properties. One is the critical
temperature. That\'s the temp above which it is *impossible* to liquefy
the gas, regardless of the pressure. The pressure required to liquefy
the gas *at* the critical temp is the critical pressure. 

The critical temp for hydrogen is several hundred degrees below zero (C).
The critical temps for oxygen and nitrogen are higher but still more
than 100 below. The only "common" gases that have a critical temp above
room temp are things like CO2, chlorine, propane, freon, etc. 

So LH2 is *cold* (around 20 K or -253 C). Like all cryogenic gases,
it\'s kept in what amounts to a high-tech thermos bottle. In fact,
thermos bottles were originally invented to store liquid gases, and
then someone realized that if they\'d do that, they\'d do great at
keeping things like coffee hot or drinks cold.

The basic setup is a double-walled tank with a vacuum in between the
walls. The vacuum prevents heat transfer by conduction and convection.
The facing surfaces are polished and plated to give a mirror finish to
reduce heat transfer via radiation. Obviously, there do need to be
occasional "spacers" in-between the walls. You use things with *very*
low heat conductivity for such. 

There are also some insulations that have been developed that allow you
to fill a railroad tank car with liquid helium (at around 3 K) and ship
it clear across the US (say a week\'s travel) and only have the temp go
up by less than a degree. 

So keeping the stuff cold isn\'t a big problem. Especially in space.
It\'s the folks on the ground that have the real problems. In space, you
can liquefy hydrogen, or even helium simply by sheilding it from the
star and local planets, and letting it radiate its heat to empty space
(effective temp of the empty sky is 4 K). You have to be patient, but
it will work!

No, just do it the way IBM did (and for all I know still does) manual
updates for mainframe stuff. If the update requires something that
would go between the two sides of a page (say page 35-36) the update is
two pages (say 35-35a, and a 36 that\'s blank on the other side).

Once things get moderately ugly, they issue an update that\'s a
replacement for the whole chapter. For RPG stuff, you\'d do it by
section or subsection.

The cabin design I use for the Lintula Sunrise has a composite shower/toilet
cubicle in one corner. I can\'t remember off the top of my head how much
detail I wrote into TLWH about it, but the toilet is a fold-out-of-the-wall
minimalist design. EVERYONE is expected to sit down at it, not stand (for
safety reasons and to allow a simple suction system [or something like that]
to remove the results). One could envisage long suction hoses being used for
certain purposes but I think after the first few law suits for damage to
sensitive organs (over-suction, blow-back, etc.) that these might be
discontinued! :-)

Covering things like this is a constant problem. The number of deckplans and
floorplans I\'ve created \'on the spot\' for my games and then realised that
there are no toilets, or that the hotel\'s dining room is on the opposite
side of the building from the kitchens, or...

Don\'t be silly.  IG doesn\'t own this list.  Besides, Ken Whitman has 
nothing to do with IG - as he recently posted, he\'s just here as a fan.  
He\'s given his opinion of how the conversation should proceed, and some 
people have responded.  I don\'t see a need to flee this list!

If you can generate a 1-year system that isn\'t _too_ much more work to roll
up, _plus_ gives you a better feeling for character background, and which
gives _equal_ skills to those in the basic T4 book (much easier than with
CT, since T4 has started off with 1 skill min per year), then I don\'t think
you can go wrong.

CORE is currently planning out a series of such books. The obvious question
is, what would you like to have in such a book other than the 1-year system?
More detail on the character _class_, or splitting major classes into
subclasses, or just adding lots of new careers? How about little things
specific to classes, i.e. special contacts or equipment - perhaps even
ships. Would you want to see career-oriented adventures (several A4 pages),
say 1 per career, or just plots that the ref\' can flesh out? Would you want
the career detail to be Milieu-specific? How detailed do you want the career
description - i.e. a technical discussion of how the Imperial army\'s
organised, or just a brief bit of fiction describing a typical trooper in a
warzone.

I can\'t think of cash values straight off, but I\'d imagine that you could
grade it:

Basic UWP stuff (assuming they\'ve visited the star system) - about 1/2 the
cost of getting the ship there, because this information can probably be
built up from passing traders, etc. If the system\'s totally new, or they\'ve
been _asked_ by the IISS to do it, then perhaps full costs for the trip plus
a weekly pay equivalent.

A few detailed scans of the main planet (complete surface maps) - full costs
plus say Cr3,000 per UWP size digit?

Complete scans of natural resources (you\'d need quite a lot of sensor
equipment to do this) say Cr5,000 per UWP size digit.

A ground-based analysis of the locals, or perhaps a long period of recording
their broadcasts, or whatever, on a fairly non-hazardous planet, say Cr4,000
per population digit?

In the extreme, a ground-based analysis on a hazardous world up to having
worked out a complete translation for their language and recorded a
substantial amount of cultural information would probably work out to Cr3000
per person per week spent working on it (that wouldn\'t be a quoted IISS
figure, but that\'s the way you as a referee could work it out). Such a
survey could take years and lots of people, but could be very valuable.

HOWEVER, meddling in, or cocking up, the local culture... giving away
technology, trading without an IISS license, etc. could all cause the
rewards to disappear and substantial fines, prison sentences, impounding of
ship, etc. by the Imperial authorities.

Alien artefact finds would be on a straight payment plus a percentage of any
final value (if auctioned to a collector or if used _directly_ in some
technological innovation). Straight payment would be small (say Cr1000) as
would the percentage (say 1%) but then something that led, say, to the
creation of black globes, might net the finder a humungous amount of
finders\' royalties.

CORE SECTOR DATA

Harald Budschedl <Harald.Budschedl@mag.linz.at> asked:
>Is there any Sector Data of Core available (not just one Subsector as in T4)?

We generated a potential set of data (based on down-grading existing 1100
data) for use both with Milieu 0 and First Survey, but I\'m not sure what
Authority are doing with this. In fact I worry what they\'re doing with all
the Milieu 0 stuff we wrote, given the way the Starships stuff seems not to
totally resemble what the authors sent in...

For the record, this list operates under a modified first amendment right
basis.  That is, you are free to say what you want to say as long as:

    a) It relates to Traveller
    b) It is not intentional flame bait
    c) It is not insultory to an individual
    d) Language is kept somewhat PG-13 or kinder

If you have an opinion that does not follow the IG thinking, feel free to
post it.  That\'s why the list is here to discuss the game, not as an IG
information source.  We are very happy that IG recognizes this list,
subscribes to it, and takes part in our discussions.  As far as I can tell,
IG has never done anything that would limit your freedom to discuss your
views.

Now the Ken Whitman thing is probably a simple statement that Ken no longer
works for IG (based on what I have read).  However, he is free to still
particpate in discussions.  It would be similar to if I left this job for
another, and still wanted to talk about Traveller, I could do so, but the
employeer I left, would need to let you know that I am no-longer "offical".
 This has gotten a bit blown out of proportion.

As far as X-Boat goes, it is dead.  It\'s mission was to talk about Classic
Traveller and not TNE.  Now the Traveller list is handling things well and
Xboat had died its own death.  It will not be resurrected.  Should there be
a resurgance of TNE talk or if IG takes Traveller down a path that diverges
from the core of Classic Traveller, then there might be new list(s) created
to deal with that, in any case IG, its representatives, and so on are going
to be free to subscibe to those lists as well.

No wonder Andy is so busy.  All those characters generated year by year.
Perhaps you could publish a supplement that charachters could use as month
by month diaries.

but yes, please, please keep them compatible.  I still recall realization
dawning that letting PCs loose with books 4-8 meant upgrading NPCs or
starting all over.


>CORE is currently planning out a series of such books. The obvious

Hooray!  Given COREs products to date they must be fast aiming at *being*
the new DGP.  (Sorry Rodge, that wasn\'t meant to sound like a cheap shot at
you, just a compliment to the previous DGPers at the quality of their
products.)

>question is, what would you like to have in such a book other than >the 1-

I\'d go with the first or third choice personally.  How about *lots* of new
career books detailing the character *classes*?

>How about little things specific to classes, i.e. special contacts or >
equipment - perhaps even ships.

Sounds good to me.

>Would you want to see career-oriented adventures (several A4 pages), >say

Dare I say "both".  How about a longer adventure and several plots?

>you want the career detail to be Milieu-specific? How detailed do you
I\'m not sure I\'d want it to be this specific but what might be good would
be pointers as to how to make them more appropriate for a particular
milieu.

Definitely the first but only the latter if it wasn\'t at the expense of
anything else.

Well I liked Advanced Character Generation... but back to the point.

I\'d like plenty of milleu-specific technical stuff; apart from being good
background for character generation, it would also be interesting from the GM
point of view to see how and why things have changed.

How about 1 book per milleu, giving all of the appropriate information for that
period - military organisation, major technical and scientific institutions,
current economic state and operations of the megacorporations. Hard facts and
figures rather than hand-waving generalisations.

Sub-classes would be good, provided that characters could move out of them.
Perhaps this could be done by adding more detail at the assignment stage
of career history generation.

But whatever you do, PLEASE, no fiction! Nor am I too keen on having adventures
in the book - how about a seperate supplement with these instead?

Hoo boy.  The dinosaurs stir in their long sleep. (-:

There is a major problem with Mr. Coons\' line of reasoning, and that is
that Shattered Ships of the Fighting Imperium was without a doubt the
worst product ever issued for MegaTraveller. The designs of the ships
are riddled with typos, don\'t conform to the rules (especially in the case
of maximum armor limits), and are not even close to optimized for the combat
system.  The general result is that the battleships are all horrendously
overpriced, and more reasonable designs tend back toward that .5MCr/ton
generalization.

The problem still exists with relative resource levels between the Imperium 
and the Aslan or Vargr, even if the total number of ships is reduced.

The example I used was the difference betweena  Roman Villa and a

just *different*, relying on and bowing to differing social forces of the

It\'s been noted that society is believed to be more dynamic in Mileau 0
than it will be once Strephon takes the throne. How will that be reflected
in design philosophy? (We\'re not talking simply tacking on tailfins here -
we\'re talking overall approach). Larger, hence less "efficient" staterooms?
More living space, more comfort, with less emphasis on the bottom line? Or
will there be a Wild West mentality, with most ships resembling the Secure

To me, the differences between Mileau 2000 Aslan, K\'Kree and Vilani
starships is what I think of when I think of differing design paradigms. I
don\'t see any reason why starships from Mileau 0 and Strephon\'s Imperium
should be - when compared side-by-side - any less alien.

Indeed.  I have been playing Traveller in it\'s many incarnations since the
early 80\'s.  I have spent the better part of 15 years wandering about
cramped, dusty, litlle bookstores and gameshops seeking anything with the
words "Science Fiction Adventure in the Far Future" emblazoned on the cover.
 As I indicated in my post regarding the "Starships Sucks" thread, if I never
read another word of criticism about that particular product, I will consider
myself a better man for it.  That said, anyone who chooses to write such
posts has every right to do so.  This list is a Godsend to someone like me,
who long ago moved far away from his "gaming circle," and now has to make do
with whomever he can find.  And lastly, anyone who dares challenge whether or
not *I* care about Traveller should be prepared to back it up with a FGMP-15,
else angels will weep for you.  

Now about those .1C chunks of rock...

I\'m going to be working on some deckplans of my own.  I\'ve settled on a
1.5m grid.  I\'m trying to decide how "deep" these squares should be and
I\'ve pretty much decided on 4m, which gives me 2.5m height for hallways
and rooms while leaving 1.5m for decking, conduits, and the like.  This
means each square will be 9m^3.  Does this seem reasonable, or is there a
different/better convention I can use?

On the whole "Tact/Censorship/Listsplit" topic, I offer my humble opinion.

<soapbox>

1.  Saying "<insert supplement name here> is Crap" is a statement of
opinion.  Saying it when 15 or so other people have already said it
earlier in the week is still a statement of opinion, but it gets a little
repetitive.  It doesn\'t add anything to the discussion.

2.  Saying "X is Crap because..." is better, because it gives us something
to talk about besides the horribleness of X.  Namely, we can talk about
WHY X is horrible.  Again, however, if 15 people have given the exact same
reason nothing is being added to the content of the list.

3.  Saying "X is Crap.  Here\'s how I would fix it:..." is even better,
because now we can talk about rule patches, new systems, and the like.

4.  Saying "X is crap.  But I liked y.  Here\'s some stuff I built using
y." is probably the best.  If half the energy which has been spent on
analyzing Foss color-plates and those horrible deckplans had been spent on
using the SSDS, think of all the useful stuff which would have been posted
to the list in the past few weeks...

I haven\'t been able to find where the hull configurations are actually

stab at what I think they are supposed to be:

1.  Wedge -- seen from the side, a triangle.  Seen from any other side,
roughly rectangular.  

2.  Block -- rectangular/square no matter which side you look at it from. 
 The Borg ship, for instance...

3.  Needle -- A pointy wedge.  Star Destroyers from the Other Game...

4.  Disk/Dome -- Circular.  The Millenium Falcon, frex.

5.  Cylinder -- Rectangular from the top or sides, but circular from the
front.  The Discovery from 2001 is probably Cylindrical.  

6.  Close Structure -- Any sort of solid shape which is not regular.  Like
the Nostrumo, or the Red Dwarf.

7.  Open Structure -- Any sort of weird splayed-out shape, like the
Enterprise.

I admit that these are guesses.  Am I even half right?  Does anybody have
better examples for the shapes?  Or a pointer to where they are described?

	Actually, they are far more technology related than social
related, insofar as environmental protection is primarily a technological
issue.  Roman Villas are reasonably well designed for comfortable living
in a Mediterranean climate, whereas most modern middle class dwellings are
designed for the periods of extreme temperature fluctuations one gets in
the temperate zones of the world(as I found out today...Brrrrr. 28 degrees
(F) as I rode in to work. Yes, I know, I\'m just another whining desert
rat, so shut up already ;-) 

	The ideal house design for (non air conditioned) southern Arizona
is remarkably similar to a roman vill, with smaller windows, but still
essentially a string of rooms looking in on an enclosed courtyard.  Of
course that design is around, in part because of the Spanish influence,
which derived directly from Rome, with a lot of input from the more
desert-dwelling Moors.

	Starships, OTOH are designed for the IDENTICAL technological
problems; humans being humans, tend to be conservative, especially when
they\'re Vilani as well. It is a box designed to provide air, water, light,
heat, cooling, etc, while moving about in space using two or three modes
of propulsion that do not change in the intervening 1000 or so years of
the Imperium: Gravitics, Jump, and Newtonian (HePLaR, or whatever the
%#@$ odd capitalization is).  What\'s left is primarily a function of
style, and that, dear hearts, is in the capable (snigger...snurf...hee hee
hee) hands of the Marketing Department.

	All of these are primarily style related issues; moreover, I
thinks ALL of these will be present at ALL times throughout the Imperium
in one form or another. It depends on who you buy the things from.  I
think that the problem here is that we\'ve gotten jammed up into the USD as
the end all and be all of a ship\'s description...it\'s not, merely a rough
guide to a technical desription of a ship.

	No way...K\'Kree and Aslan ships are different because their basic
desription is different: the physiology of their designers demands it;
Vilani shipas are that way because of societal differences and cultural
expectations, true, but the Imperium has always been a hodge-podge mongrel
of Vilani, Solomani, and other cultural influences, and like goulash on
the third reheating, starts to look the same everywhere.

	Better prose descriptions of the ships would point out the
differences better than just the USP.

The way the original lab ship designed t made sense.  The ring allowed 
the scientist to kill artifical gravity and just have the thing rotate 
creating minimal gravity for crew movement.
With the new ship, it would look stupid rotating to create the same 
effect.

I like the new scout ship.  True the deckplans don\'t exactly match up 
with the picture but hey, how many actually do?  The glass front 
canopy would allow better visual of new planets.

The Safari ship bites though.  I liked the old one.  The front side 
being glass allowed for better views.  This new design doesn\'t even 
show the capture tanks.  And the lounge is spread out.  Plus what\'s up 
with the parasail look?

Seems to me they went at the deckplans backwards this time.  First 
they had the exterior drawn then created interior to match as best as 
possible.  This is evident by the different size staterooms for no 
apparent reason.  At least in all the other version of Traveller the 
ships were better laid out.  Someone with some sort of architectural 
knowledge took time to lay out the plans to make sense.  Gallies were 
next to staterooms.  Capture tanks hooked up to airlocks.

One point but unless the cryos are actively maintaining temperature at the
critical temp the container must be venting, the smaller the cross sectional
area the more it must be vented. Also the tank car that you talk about must
have some extremely expensive insulation because the liquid gas vendors(Air
Liquide, Tri State, and Linde division of Union Carbide) in my state just
accept the gas loss due to venting. But they make sure that the cross
sectional area is to their economic advantage though.

If the container does not vent it will blow up.

After my number of rants about the low quality of the T4 rules and books I
finally decided to do something more constructive: since my first attempt
to design a ship with the Starships rules was pretty frustrating (I hate
them the way they are presented... totally obfuscated to me) I decided to
rewrite the SSDS for more clarity and a little more brevity.  Since I\'m
coming from a mathematical background I\'ll also junk tables whenever
possible and will replace them by nice and short formulae (which IMHO
e.g. show the differences between hull shapes a lot better than huge
tables).

I\'ve started on it this morning and will continue over the next days (as
my time permits) and will provide my revised design system probably in
postscript, HTML and maybe one or two other formats for proofreading and
checking by more experienced Traveller players on the list (if anyone is
interested that is).  If I like my final results I even will consider to
submit them to JTAS (with credit given to everyone who helped on it
naturally).

This leads to a question: how do I subscribe to the GDW-Beta list?  Since
rules discussions for new supplements seem to take place there I\'d like to
see what they are doing before (as far as I am concerned; no insult
intended) the jug breaks again, if I dare say so :-)

Studying the tables in Starships already astonished me a couple of times:
is it correct that all the airlock data in all the hull tables is the
same?  Looking at them I couldn\'t see any difference.  the nice thing
about this is that I can save at least one page of rules by replacing the
air lock data with 6 tiny formulae (is that really the correct plural?  As
a native german I always believed it to be \'formulas\'... where\'s my
dictionary?).

My results so far: it\'s pretty simple to derive some formulae for the
volume, the size code, the air lock data and the jump drive data without
*any* tables.  For the length and the surface area of a given
configuration I seem to need a table for some basic numbers (up to now I
could not find any real pattern for these things).

Now I\'d naturally be interested in formulae for all the weapon data and
such things (figuring them out from the tables probably is a lot of work,
if possible at all).  Any help would be appreciated :-)

Greetings from Germany,

				Thomas.

    'body' => 'Hi!

This evening I tried to design my first ship ever for Traveller using the
SSDS from Starships.  My initial experiences with the system and the rules
as presented were not very good and I discovered that the rules leave some
more questions open (or I missed something).

First of all I was wondering about the effect of high G-values with
maneuver drives.  The ship I tried to design was a kind of emergency
vessel for the rich nobility should the need arise to leave a planet in a
hurry (maybe because of a rebellion or something like that) and thus needs
good acceleration values (among other things) to get away from potential
pursuit.

Thus I wanted to have a small, high-acceleration ship with good stealth
values and a minor jump drive to be able to escape to the next system.

I decided to read the system while designing the ship (probably my first
mistake) and headed initially for an 8G maneuver drive.  Now the ship
obviously need some compensation for such acceleration values.  On page
103 there are two tables labeled \'G-Tanks (TL 8-9)\' and \'Maximum Gs
Compensated\' which do not seem to be used in the text (or I missed the
relevant parts; the missing references in SSDS are really annoying and
make it very difficult to learn the system :-( ).  What the heck is a
G-tank and what are its effects?  What is the meaning of the second table?
What meanings do the different G-values in that table have?  As far as I
can see form the table I won\'t be able to have full compensation for 8Gs
at TL12... so what are the game effects of \'excess G values\'?

Then I started to look at the travel formulae for starships in the basic
rules (page 115) since I wanted to get some idea of how fast this little
ship really would be.  The section on interstellar travel mentions that
the transit time for a ship with 1G acceleration from a size 8 world to
100 diameters is about 5 hours.  This value obviously was not calculated
with the travel formulae on that page (size 8 world: 12800km, jump
position at 12800 * 100 = 1,280,000km; T = 2 * square root(D [in meters] /
A) = 2 * sqrt(1,280,000,000 / 8) =~ 25298 seconds =~ 7 hours).  Thus my\'d
TL12 8G acceleration ship would need longer than a 1G acceleration ship.
Do these formulae only apply to travel between worlds?  Even then I can\'t
see the reasoning?  What\'s my mistake?

Another problem I had with the SSDS itself (maybe it\'s just my approach) 
is this: rather late in the design process I discovered that I nearly had
used up all the space (volume and surface area) available for a 100t
displacement ship, which either would force me to start over with a larger
ship or force me to forfeit some nifty equipment.  Is there any more
intelligent approach other than just trying and starting again and again 
until one has figured out the best possible configuration (especially
the size)?

I also found it a little difficult to deside for a specific hull type
(checking all those tables to see which configuration might be most
appropriate for my goal is really tedious).  I really miss some textual
advice on this in the rules (which are really lacking comments and
examples for about everything :-( ).  I never liked Fire, Fusion & Steel
(maybe that\'s my basic problem) since all the math never did seem to yield
any realistic results and thus for me was not worth the trouble -- maybe
that\'s my basic problem :_)

Other things I didn\'t manage to figure out:

What\'s the use of EMM?  The text doesn\'t seem to mention this.  What\'s the
difference between basic and standard life support?  How is stealth used?
What use is the artifical gravity/inertial compensation table?

Finally (after some frustration I started to page through the TNE
rulebook) I noticed that the TNE rules provide a very nice start & land
sequence for starships (IMHO; when I bought the rules I put the book away
in disgust before I got that far) where players have to use some skills
and rules for emergency starts, etc.  I really feel that these details are
missing in T4 since many of the spaceship-related skills (especially
Astrogation) seem to be basically useless in the T4 rules (is there any
comment anywhere in the rules on when and how to use this skill?).  I
really plan to use the TNE system (maybe slightly modified)  for my T4
campaign (should I ever get around to start one before giving up in
frustration about the shoddy rules). 
What are you all doing in your games if the PCs want to fly away with
their ship?  Is this automatically possible if they have the skills, do
you make up some checks or were you never concerned about this?

Final comments on the presentation of the Starship rules: the missing
references are annoying, the missing explanations even more troubling, the
color art is really placed in one of the worst possible positions (it
constantly gets into ones way), the number-loaded tables are really
tedious [I\'d really prefer a couple of well-organized formulae] and
generally I\'d lower my review rating for the rules from 6.5 to about 3.5.
As well the designer probably wanted it to be -- the presentation is
really bad and the editors are really guilty of neglecting to make the
rules readable for persons who want to understand them without knowing how
they worked in previous Traveller editions (thus I\'d lower my editing
rating from 7 to 4, too; this makes for a new overall 3.2 out of 10 rating
for Starships... *ouch!*). 

Help would be appreciated.

Thanks in advance,

				Thomas Biskup.

Speaking of beacons through the fog...

Hi, Leonard.  Now, I\'m assuming that on the ground there would be a kinds of
steam as the outer surfaces of LH2 containers are much colder than the air
around them, right?  Makes for great visual at a starport refuelling area.

T4 (IMHO) is not innovative; it does nothing in a new and exciting way. 
But so what? Very few RPGs are (especially these days). Innovation 
doesn\'t mean it\'s any good - maybe the reason nobody has used an idea 
before is that it stinks! CT was innovative, T4 is just the latest 
version.

I once knew a Vargr who used to like \'looking out of the window\' (she was

the start of the jump, and at the end she\'d eat the ones floating on top

Standard convention for a 1.5m grid is a 3m ceiling; then two squares are
almost one displacement ton (2*1.5*1.5*3 = 13.5).  This is why a MegaT
displacement ton was 13.5 kL instead of the more correct 14 kL.

This isn\'t true on all official ship designs, however.  The old Type S
Scout/Courier had an upper attic deck and lower oversized airlock which 
did double duty as a cargo deck.  There is a vertical ladder aft of the
flight deck which connects all three.  At that point, due to the wedge
shape of the ship, the mid-deck can\'t be more than about 6 ft 2" high,
and the attic and cargo/airlock can\'t have a clearance of more than
thirty inches -- it still is enough for access, but the deck plans 
don\'t show this well.  It gets better as you go aft, of course.

[I came up with the figures above independently; does anyone know what
the old _Traders and Gunboats_ said about this?]

The Azhanti deckplans used a 4.5 m convention; the hangar decks were
set as being four standard decks (18m) tall.  This is about 3 squares
for two displacement tons (3*1.5*1.5*4.5 = 30.375 is a bit more than
14*2 = 28).  The Sub Merchant had a 6 m high cargo deck but left the
crew deck at 3 meters.

Pick one you like and go with it.  Note on the plan which convention
you settle on.

	Well perhaps I was a little too hasty with the " No no no no!" line. *IF* 
you can pull off the above paragraph, I for one would love to see the 
return of advanced character generation.
	Thats a big if, though (although I don\'t mind if it is more work to roll 
up, since its entirely optional, and doesn\'t give you more powerful 
characters).

If I have to chose, just brief plots, but I\'m not crazy about either.

Thats a hard one - its difficult to discern IGs intentions as to the 
different Milieus i.e. are they going to start pumping out a bunch of 
different M books, or just put out M0, and the others "sometime". It would 
depend where you see T4 in the next year or so going.

I WANT PLENTY O\' DETAIL!

>TELL US WHAT YOU WANT AND WE\'LL SEE IF WE CAN EXCEED YOUR >EXPECTATIONS...

If you can create a 1 year character generation system tha creates 
characters of equal poer to 4 yearers, you will have already exceeded my 
expectations.

Good luck, can\'t wait to see it!

        I\'ve found that working from a grid actually hampers the deckplan
process personally.  The way I\'ve done it (three sets of deckplans so far)
is to work up the dimensions of the ship (based on the length, volume, and
shape data from SSDS), and then draw front, side, and top elevations of the
ship to scale using a draw program.

        Then I figure out roughly where the decks fit into it, trace the
appropriate outlines on the exterior, and use those to draw the outlines of
the decks, which I then fill in with plans.

        The advantage of doing this to scale is that one can have the
front/side/stop elevations on one sheet of paper, and then have each deck
to a sheet at a smaller scale to show it in greater detail.

        Of course, you need decent drawing software to do this...

Got a bit over half a billion credits (not counting crew costs) to spend on
impressing your fellow nobles or MegaCorp directors?  Then the Famille
Spofulam Yards Caligula-class megayacht is just what you need!

        The Caligula is built into a 1000td airframe saucer hull, with
elegantly styled vertical stabilizers said to resemble the fins of an
aquatic terran mammal known as "the dolphin".  Overall, the styling evokes
the classical opulence of bygone early Space-Age Terra.   With its 3G
thruster plate maneuver drive and 2-parsec jump drives, the Caligula has
the accelleration and range to meet the most demanding of civilian
applications.  Nobody takes their customers\' safety to heart more then
FSY\'s design bureau; Caligula owners can venture safely into the riskiest
regions of an expanding Imperium thanks to its four MFD-linked 143
megajoule lasers, armour, and twin sandcaster turrets.

        Its superlative flight characteristics and armament aside, the
Caligula is also a very capable ship, with extensive fabrication and repair
capabilities (it carries complete electronics and machine shops), an
onboard laboratory, and a full sickbay.  It carries a 50-td modular cutter
(tracked ATV module comes standard) in a spacious hangar and a 30td ship\'s
boat in a minimal hangar, to meet auxiliary craft needs.  For wilderness
refuelling, it comes equipped with fuel scoops and an on-board fuel
purification plant capable of refining 700 m^3 every 6 hours, thus enabling
full refuelling in a single 24-hour period.  Massive power-systems
redundancy is provided by 3 500 MW fusion generators.

        The crew complement of 29 (7 gunners, 2 maintenance, 5 electronics,
4 engineering, 2 flight deck, 3 command, 2 small-craft pilot, 3 steward,
and 1 doctor) are lodged in exceptional comfort in 21 small staterooms for
junior crew and 4 large staterooms for officers and the doctor.  The two
junior stewards and six junior gunners sleep two to a stateroom; the others
junior crew sleep one to a stateroom.  13 4-person emergency low berths are
provided in case of need.

        However, it is in the passenger accomodations that the Caligula
truly shines; 8 large staterooms and a truly enormous owner\'s suite are
provided, along with another 250 m^3 of customisable leisure space; the
first Caligula-class commissioned carried a small arboretum, for which it
is now famous.  Other uses to which this space has been put are swimming
pools and alleys for an ancient Solomani sport known as "bowling".

I think you are still with me, KC.  It\'s just that I didn\'t explain 
myself well.

What I was trying to say is this.  Let\'s say someone proposes an end 
all Traveller equipment book.  IG actually goes through all of the 
things ever published on Traveller, pulls all of the equipment, 
updates it for T4, and publishes a series of books on it.

Then someone says, "No.  We can\'t do that.  It would cost too much.  
There would be multiple volumes, and people just wouldn\'t buy it."

Well, that is the type of cop-out crap that I\'m talking about.  If 
there is a market for it, then it will be bought.  IG will have to 
make a decision whether they can make money on the idea.

I\'d buy such a product.  And as an example, I will cite the series of 
D&D books (the ultimate guide on magic items), selling at $25 a piece, that 
everyone I know who plays D&D will buy.

So, I\'m not saying that economics is not a factor in business.  I 
just don\'t like an idea being shot down on unobvious economic 
opinions.  Gold plated T4 books is an obvious economic opinion, and 
I\'d agree with you that IG would not sell many of them.

I just thought of another example of this, but it is not related to 
Traveller.  Let me give it to you just to sum my point.  

I saw a preview to Starship Troopers the other day, and I\'d heard 
from others that it looked exciting.

Well, I was with my gaming group (there, that ties it in to 
Traveller), and I was explaining that I just didn\'t think it looked 
as good as it could have been.  I thought that the digital creatures 
the marines were fighting looked very digital.

Excuses abounded.  "Well, they have to look that way.  You couldn\'t 
put all those people in suits."

That\'s bull.  The film did not HAVE to look that way.  It could have 
looked much different.  Look how great the predator looked in 
Predator.

"Yeah.  But that\'s a man in make up.  Starship Troopers has a horde 
of bugs attacking them.  You had to do it digital."

And, I said that digital was fine.  But digital creatures don\'t have 
to look digital.  Look at Jurassic Park.

KC, what I\'m talking about is acceptance.  Just because somebody says 
that it is cost prohibitive doesn\'t mean that it is.  And I\'ve seen 
this happen on this list.  Once you work out the details, maybe it is 
not cost prohibitive, or maybe the extra cost will be worth the extra 
sales.

Hi, Ken,

I wasn\'t going to respond to this post, but since you addressed it to
me I felt that you deserved a reply.

First off, you are trying to make the point I made with my original
post on Starships written the day I got it.  But, there was one
difference.

I said that we should be constructive in our reviews of 
Starships--not just say that it is crap.  I said that IG may be 
thinking that they had a good product on their hands and be 
scratching their heads wondering why the response to the book has been so
negative.

So, I wrote what no marketing test could give you.  I wrote my 
feelings from the point I entered the store, picked up the product,
and took it out to my car to read it.  And, I wrote about the buyer\'s
regret that set in almost immediately.

I also wrote about the responsibility I feel to help promote 
Traveller.  After reading this, Jeff Zeitlin concurred, and changed
his policy on T4 products reviews in Freelance Traveller.  I think this touched 
a chord with many TMLers out there, because I have seen many of the 
posts become more constructive.  I think I said what a lot of people were 
already feeling.

I have even been accused of not being constructive with my post on the
Starships pictures when my intent was nothing but to give examples of
what I, and everyone else on the TML, wanted.  There has been a lot of
negative talk about the look Chriss Foss has given T4, and it was
logical to me to cite examples of pictures and say which were and were
not Traveller.

The difference in what I\'ve been saying and what you just posted is
that I don\'t think Traveller is going to be helped by just saying good
things about it.  As fans, it is important for IG to know about what
the fans are upset about.

Heck, this is a marketer\'s dream!  IG has instant consumer reponse!

I know that you are worried about the newbies tuning in to this list
and getting a negative reaction to T4, and as I stated in my original
Starships post, that is a concern of mine as well.  

But, more importantly, this list is not a bunch of yes men.  You will
get the cold hard facts about T4 here.  If IG is doing well, then this
list will reflect it.  If the list members don\'t like something, then
IG will hear about that here too.   And if IG is smart, they will take
this to heart and make T4 the premier science fiction role playing
game that it should be.

This purpose of this list is the free, unrestrained discussion of
Traveller.  If that ever changed, I\'d leave it.

So here is my recommendation.  Let\'s make T4 the best rpg ever.  Let\'s
have the best rules, the best background, the best entire system.  If
we do that, people will play it, and T4 will be the success we all
want it to be.  I want to be able to teach my kids about Traveller.

How do we do that?  Well, we continue with the good stuff and fix the 
bad stuff.  How do we know what is bad and what is good?  Sales and 
the instant consumer response available on this list.

If we do it your way, and the supplements from T4 continue to be like
Starships, then I\'m afraid that Traveller will die again.

Ken, I think your heart was in the right place, and I think we both 
want the same thing.

And that is for Traveller to be a success.

Thank you,

Kenneth.

NO! The original Enterprise would be probably classified as a cylinder.
Just because it has warp nacelles tacked on, doesn\'t make it an open
structure, imho.

An Open Structure means an open *framework* with no enclosing outer hull
covering the entire thing. There may be enclosed parts, but an open
structure means the framework is on the *outside*. Like the proposed
space station Freedom, forex.

More than half. They\'re described more fully in earlier Traveller
rulesystems. Remember that the hull shape is a description of the
structural design and shape, and isn\'t necessesarily immediately obvious
from the outside.

The standard used in CT-MT deckplans (albeit inconsistantly...) is:

2 "squares" == 1 Displacement ton.
1.5 x 1.5 x 3 = 6.75 cubic m = 1/2 Displacement Ton

That is, a 1.5 sqare meter deckpan with 3m of height. The 3 m includes
decking, conduits, et. al. Remember, you\'re allowed +/- 20% leeway when
drawing plans for access corridors etc.

The equivalency to the displacement ton was useful back in the days when
everything was measured in tons, it\'s easier to mentally juggle those
numbers and count squares. I can\'t recall off the top of my head whether
13.5 cu. m is still 1 disp. ton, or if it\'s been rounded to 14 cu. m.
Regardless, when I make deckplans I use 2 "squares" = 1 ton.

<soapbox> stuff deleted.

Good summary. This flame stuff is getting waaaayy outta hand.

I read Ken W.\'s post last night and thought, "hmmm... interesting
viewpoint." I didn\'t agree, but I had no idea so many would take it
personally... I was happy to see that KW really cared about Traveller,
for a sec. I thought he just "flitted in and moved on..."

And cut Kenneth B. some slack, eh? He just wanted to check in and see if
his idea of what looked and didn\'t look like a Traveller ship jibed with
other\'s view. His intent was not malicious.

<after staying firm for so long, Glenn bites the bullet and wades into
the art controversy vis-a-vis Foss>

Chris Foss draws well. He makes interesting use of perspective. He\'s
(relatively) popular and famous in mainstream sf. Trav\'s use of him was
probably a good thing, if IG wanted to attract new players.

Personally though, I don\'t like the way he draws _my_ Traveller ships.
Though I sometimes like the surface stuff, I\'ve never liked the
retro-cliche\'d high-school mag-wheeled roadster style when it comes to
vehicles and starships. And everything\'s too big. So what? That\'s just
me. I have tons of books with neet-o pix by other artists, who have been
mentioned a lot already, in MY minds-eye those are still traveller
vessels.

I\'ll admire Chris\' work, and then ignore it.

Why get so worked up about it? If it sells Traveller, that\'s good. If it
doesn\'t, well, IG should find someone else.

But everyone has the right to say whether they like it or not.

My next post will be constructive criticism on why IG needs better art
direction. (To me it seems they haven\'t had any)

Ok, towards different ends of the spectrum. Hyperbole for illustration.

I don\'t think so. IMO, traveller\'s roots have always been grand panoramic
empire as backdrop; a common thread amongst much early (and late) 70\'s Sci
Fi. TNE, T4: both have small, multiple, minor (but expanding) powers are
NOT the same.

The Shattered Imperium was still a group of large enough blocks that within
each block you had the classic backdrop; you could also easily use it for
the classic era. But that\'s still "semi-fluff".

T4 just has the worng systemic feel. it doen\'t feel like traveller. It
makes quite different assumptions about careers than MT/CT. MT was CT with
a Task system, the gap between basic and advanced c-gen narrowed, and
striker and high guard integrated. T4 is mechanically incompatable with
CT/MT. HG vessels could be used (although not built) in MT with NO
conversions (the USP values are identical). T4 is closer to CT than TNE,
but still is a revision of TNE in the hardware department, and CGen
department.

As will I. And suggest same to anyone I know. And also, probably NEVER buy

It was dieing. Slowly, oh so slowly.  But will t4 resurect the traveller
that some of us loved, or the TNE that others loved?

*N*O*!*. It must build upon it\'s own foundations, as, like TNE, it\'s too
different from CT/MT to be played the same.

one last thjought: censorship, imposed or customary, self or external, is
the death of what we call freedom. I\'m not talking about "naughty words";
censorship is about IDEAS. Mr Whitman has asked us to keep our thoughts to
ourselves; had we done that, would Marc Miller have even tried to do t4?

Yeah, the fins ao that thing ARE wierd, and maybe they are the folding 
sensors :)

Having being the first time i posted anything bout starships in the list, I 
wanted just to point out something not pertaining to "art" or 
"Travelleresqueness".

Many have been wondering about typos, well I found one for the LAb ship, the 
structure is 1! this would mean that this thing would fly appart at the 
slightest nudge, but it is in error(thankfully)

I looked up the USP conversion for a ship that size (400tons) at 1g 
acceleration.  Looking on the sheet 400+ has a rate of 9 (correct me if im 
wrong, i am at work right now and do not realt have the book in front of me! 
:)  )

Another thing I wondered about was the fighter style of sensor packages, I 
looked eveywhere for a package with 5A 2P 2J but all i found were military 
versions with 10A 5P 5J.

I aleviated this easily enough, I created the "Military-Small" sensor 
package, i basicaly halved all values of the stadard military sensor 
package, it\'s fudging i know, but it works for now.

If you want some cool designs made using QSDS/SSDS, designs they way the 
were MENT to be made, visit my site at www.magicnet.net/~opp-mag  (choose 
Planet X main option) .  Most are small fast military ships that will kill 
anything Cleon has to offer!
Honestly, I tested them myself! :)

well thats enough for my rants, raves, and of course my plug!

It better! There\'s not much point to making a new game if its not better
than the old ones.

Lets compare the games on an equal footing; lets compare them with what
they had a few months after they first came out.

CT: The first three LBB\'s (Little Black Books) contained very little
compared to what we have today, but they did hold the nucleus of what
was to become Traveller: A radically different kind of character
creation system, a world creation system, and an idea of what science
fiction gaming should be all about. Every version of Trav since then has
held this same nucleus (except perhaps for TNE). There was practically
no background; the words "Imperium" or "empire" were not in these rules.
There was a vague inference of some kind of laissez-faire interstellar
government, or convention, mention of piracy, tramp freighters, and
marines who used swords alot more than we do today.

MT: The three BCB\'s (Big Colorful Books) contained everything that the
LBB\'s had (except for a SIMPLE starship construction system) and about
a million typos, bugs, and bad rules to boot. Nice task system tho.
The game was basically unplayable unless you already had the LBB\'s
or knew someone who did. Background info was GREAT, basically all of it
taken from late CT; the only new stuff was of limited interest
(rebellion, rebellion, rebellion and then some rebellion).

TNE: No comment, except that starships rules got even more complicated,
and they ejected the above-mentioned "nucleus" of Trav.

T4: The BGBB (Big Glossy Black Book) contained everything the LBB\'s did
(except, yet again, for a SIMPLE starship construction system), but with
updated and much improved (IMHO) combat systems. LOTS more background
than the LBB\'s, not nearly as much as MT, but most of it is new this
time. A new and easy to use experience system, no book-keeping
necessary! RELATIVELY few unexplained assumptions in the rules (a curse
of every Trav release so far). A fun and exciting starship combat
system, especially with the role-playing modifications found on
Wildstar\'s website. "Starships" was a disappointment tho, but not a
catastrophic one. I\'m still glad I bought it (but then I can afford it).

So it\'s still hard to tell. Is T4 the best? It may yet be; it has
weaknesses, but then so did its "competitors".

some useful thoughts and constructive criticism that hasn\'t been wholly

didn\'t speak up...

well, I just wouldn\'t forgive myself.

Onward!

Because of what I\'ve been hearing on the TML, I likely won\'t buy
Starships. From the descriptions I\'ve heard, I know I won\'t like it. If
IG goes bankrupt because *I* didn\'t buy starships, I\'ll be sad. But I
won\'t blame myself or this list. I made an informed choice.

Information is good. It works both ways. Next product IG makes will be
better, because so many disliked Starships.

What *I* look for in a good game product:

1. Useful information

Depending on the type of book, Useful Info means game mechanics
("rules")  and/or background. I personally believe that adventure plots
belong in adventure supplements and not rulebooks.

Starships I\'ve heard, has very small useful info:page count ratio.

EXAMPLES: I thought those small "mini-supplements" put out by GDW were
great. Forex, the Diaspora one. Lots of information deatailing changes
in the sector, and little library data tidbits that stimulated the
imagination. I think IG should put out one of these for each sector in
its milieu. Start with Sylea: Milieu 0, then move on to Vland: Milieu 0,
Spinward Marches: Milieu 500, Solomani Rim: Milieu 1000, etc etc...

2. Accuracy and well thought out diagrams (and art too)

The point that kills my desire for Starships. From what I\'ve heard, The
deckplan\'s *suck*. I don\'t want a book of pretty pictures, I want
useful, well thought out deckplans.

EXAMPLES: DGP\'s alien modules. Illustrations in the modules related to
the text, and gave the "flavour" of each race\'s setting. Stellar maps
gave loads of detail without looking cluttered.

3. Intelligently laid out and organized, with an eye to ergonomics

That is: *serf text* is for reading lots of copy, *Helvetica* is for
tables of numbers and labels. *Chunk* things more for goodness sakes, I
hate wading through uninteresting-looking mounds of body copy. DGP
products had great art direction and layout. Most T$R (shudder) products
are relatively good at "chunking" and organized, intelligent layout.

The T4 rulebook was seriously negligent in this respect. The best part
was the career tables! They had some organization and consistancy.

EXAMPLES: The much maligned little black books were excellent for
gaming. They could be laid out flat. They were small enough so that if
you\'re looking for a specific piece of data, you knew where to look,
quickly.

- ----
My Recommendation:

IG needs an Art Director. I don\'t think they had a *real* Art Director
working on T4. A good Art Director has some knowledge of typography and
layout. S/He knows what is easy to read and how to communicate
effectively. S/He knows the difference between effective and
constructive art, which *enhances* the text, helps illustrate a point,
or provides setting and background for the information presented, and
pure "fluff".

A good Art Director isn\'t _just_ an artist. In fact, an Art Director
doesn\'t even _have_ to be an artist! (just look at me :-) But an Art
Director knows the art must serve a purpose.

FACT: It has been *proven* that serif typefaces are easier to read for
long body copy. Why make a rulebook that\'s hard to read?

FACT: It has been *proven* that black type on a white background is
easiest to read. The Macintosh platform was designed to be black text on
white because the designers knew this! Microsquish figgured it out too. 

There\'s no point in trying to *simulate* a computer in print, or to
simulate outer space. It\'s a book, darnit! It won\'t work! Does NASA
print out orbital plots of the Space Shuttle white on black? (BTW I
*hated* the way weapons and equipment were presented in TNE rulebooks.
What a waste of ink and space, trying to simulate a "computer terminal".
Tacky. Corny. DGP did it WAY better with well laid out 1 page per
equipment sheets.)

I admit that it (white on black) may work if colour is used
intelligently, and/or for a specific purpose. The aforementioned
Diaspora map, was on black cardboard stock and was colour coded. In
DGP\'s Traveller Digest #3 there was a pull-out wall map, white on black,
of the Domain of Deneb. It looked cool.

Note in both those exceptions: The map was separate from the product!
                               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is "jarring" to read a book and *wham* white on black. Epecially when
the world dots have tacky grayscale blends that add nothing to the
design.

I\'m not slamming all of T4 by my points above. Some of the art in the
rulebook had a purpose, the b&w art wasn\'t too bad, as far as giving
setting and "feel" to the rules. Obviously, the Cris Foss stuff, being
recycled, wasn\'t specifically designed for Traveller, but if it attracts
people to the book, it\'s good. It could have been better placed, tho\'.

The cumbersome grammar, poor organization and poor subdividing of info,
distracting colour plate interruptions, and goddawful typography, made
the rulebook a *chore* to read. In the past, I\'ve read every Traveller
thing I bought cover-to-cover. I was literally unable (unwilling) to do
it in this case.

>From what I managed to read, the rules seemed pretty good. Some minor
quibbles, but the "vision" of Traveller has improved, IMHO. I like
Traveller\'s direction in terms of setting. I like the emphasis on
historical milieux, good roleplaying (as opposed to wargaming), Marc and
IG\'s attitude that *we* as Traveller fans, have something to contribute.
eg. the ship design systems and ships, relative lassiez-faire attitude
towards fan fiction and copyright compared to T$R...

To summarize:

I like Traveller.

It tastes good, but at this point it\'s hard to Digest.

(pun intended)

IG needs to worry about "glitz", yes. But they should worry *even more*
about content and usability.

Hey, feel free. If you can come up with something that works better than
what we have at the moment then more power to you. The only thing I ask
is that you keep it consistent and at least semi-plausible. Not necessarily
realistic, but at least consistent. That means that if starship construction
works in one way for the Imperials then it should work the same way for
Vargr and Aslans.

Of course military ships are more expensive than civilian ships; that wasn\'t
what I commented on. It was the next sentence, the one just before my
comment. Large military ships tend to be slightly cheaper than smaller
military ships undet CT.

And neither did I, I said that those are the ones we have, at the moment.
The ones we have (pause) to work with. Those are the only official rules 
we have on the subject. You can use whatever rules you want, but those 
wouldn\'t be the Traveller rules, now would it?

Of course, if you can demonstrate that the Traveller rules don\'t make sense 
and provide some that do make sense, then I\'ll be delighted to use those in 
our arguments.

The big problem I have with that statement is that you\'re talking about \'a 
world\' as if all worlds are equal. They are undoubtely high for a medium 
population world, and they are also high for a normal high-population world, 
but Mikesh is a world with 60 billion inhabitants. That\'s actually the crux
of the argument.

Or are you saying that Mikesh should be able to build and support all those
ships, all right, but that they shouldn\'t be able to do it so fast? That it
should take 22 years to build a 200,000 T ship rather than 2.2 years? If
you are, are you basing that on anything more than a feeling? Does this
ten times factor also apply to 20,000 T ships and to 5,000 T ships? What
about 100 T ships? Should they take 200-400 weeks to build rather than the
20-40 weeks the rules says it takes? Do you have any real-world figures 
that support this?

The biggest battleship building nations on Earth during WWII had a
population level of 8. The Imperium has scores of worlds with a population
level of 10. You don\'t think that would make a difference?

But the ones that would be defended way past the ability of any Vargr
corsair alliance to defeat are precisely the ones that will be able to build
the biggest ships. Besides, it dosen\'t really matter. If the Imperial planets
can\'t build big ships then the Vargr can\'t either. So Mikesh will just build 
that many more 20,000 T ships. I don\'t really care what rules you use, but I
do insist that you apply them equally to both sides.

While externally imposed censorship is a bad thing, self-imposed is a
good and necessary thing.  I certainly hope that everyone on this list
decides what to and not to say.  Self-censorship is nice because it allows
you to choose what to say and not say.  I think of a lot of things that
it would be a bad idea to say or which would be a waste of time to talk
about and I censor those things.

	I do agree with the sentiments you\'re expressing here. I was more replying 
to your previous statement that you disregard any statement that says "such 
and such is too expensive".

	Obviously, cost is a factor, but certainly not the only factor. I think we 
can all agree on that.

For those of you who have been off in Siberia or somewhere equally remote
from the TML, Dark Star #2 is now available - and, guess what, one of the
articles included is on the Ila\'u ("Lucky") Class Modular Scout-Courier ...
and included as part of the design are standard High and Middle Passage
Cabin layouts that show the placement of all internal fittings ... yep,
*including* space for a shower/toilet (or bathroom, if you\'re a yank) and
closet space. Suffice it to say that the rooms are *nothing* like as
spacious as the one depicted in DG\'s "Starship Operator\'s Manual", but
*are* fitted into the 3 ton displacement space listed in all iterations of
Traveller (and allowing for one ton of personal baggage as well).

These are drawn with a cheap little "Home Floorplan" layout program that
gives rather nice results - and shows *exactly* to scale all the likely
fitments.

Cost is 5stg to the UK, US$7 to the US (you can send cash, a Bank Draft or
Postal Money Order ... assuming your Post Office hasn\'t abolished them! -
but *no* personal checks on your local bank ... it costs more to clear than
the amount you\'ll send. No subs are available as DS is a *fanzine* and not
necessarily all that regular - other parts of the world check with me -
that\'s for the print-on-paper version (and there are still over 20 of the
30 printed left! :-(

It is *also* available as an Adobe Acrobat .pdf file for electronic
transmission - check with me for costs.

They make a great Xmas present - though you wouldn\'t get them in time for
Xmas, unfortunately, as it\'s rather latish (unless you live in Oz, of
course!)

<grin> true, it is a mouthful... although accurate. I do think that
starships (and particularly military ones) will *be* major products for
worlds with TL 15 and an A class starport, and the worlds in my games
reflect this. Still, if a world  has 10 *billion* folks, a certain amount of
capability in every industrial area is going to be a given, I\'d say.

Well, Instellarms *is* one of the thirteen megacorps in the Imperium, after
all...and weapons are also going to be standardized for a Navy production
contract. I still think that rate mentioned above is too slow.

<grin> And here we get to one of the key points in the High Guard
construction sequence for military ships. It\'s been over ten years since I
ran the numbers out, so I don\'t have them at my fingertips, but the *best*
way for a military starship to inflict damage is with a spinal mounted meson
gun, and you can only put in one of those per hull, no matter what size the
hull is. Also, if you look at the damage done by a really *big* meson gun
(factor N or greater), it\'ll produce enough damage to put any ship it hits
out of action until dockyard repairs can be effected, if it just doesn\'t
eliminate it altogether. And hull size doesn\'t help *here*, either, except
for saving you from some additional critical hits.

What this *means* is that the 500kton DN that gets hit by a factor R meson
gun, let\'s say for example, gets put out of action *almost* as often as a
40kton CA, with the small difference being due to the *extra* critical hits
due to the size of the ship. This monster DN, though, costs just as much per
ton (assuming the same capabilities... same armor, jump, maneuver, agility,
and so forth... which are all strictly proportional to size).
Cost-effectiveness suggests that spending the same amount of money on a
squadron of twelve CAs as opposed to the one DN provides *vastly* improved
firepower (12 spinal mounts, as opposed to only one), and a lot more
survivability, as twelve hits are required to put the entire squadron out of
action, as opposed to only one for the DN. The additional strategic
flexibility in having 12 hulls available as opposed to just one is simply
another major perk.

Where am I going with all this? Well, contrary to the canonical "Fighting
Ships"... I don\'t think the Imperium *ought* to build big DNs at all. At J3
a wonderfully capable CA can be built on 40 ktons, and at J4, an
equivalently capable ship can be built on about 70 ktons. Anything bigger
should be an auxiliary of some sort, a CVA or tanker or troop transport, for
instance. Bigger is *not* better, and is demonstrably worse, IMO. Packing
more stuff inside a bigger hull just gives you more stuff to be destroyed by
a meson gun hit, that\'s all. Your best defense is giving the enemy more
hulls to shoot at than he\'s got meson guns to shoot with.

Well, the shortest times I\'ve seen anyone mention here have been something
on the order of two years for a CA, and lots longer for bigger ships, which
isn\'t anywhere near "overnight". You can cross the length of the Imperium
and come back in all that time. "Only a few of them"? Look at the US Seventh
Fleet, in 1945... once the US got cranked up for full production, there were
carriers all over the place! I don\'t think the WWII model fits on all points
to Traveller, either, BTW, as you mention above. And as to just a few worlds
building them... how many TL 15, class A starport worlds do you run across
with enough population to do any significant shipbuilding? In the Spinward
Marches, for instance, there are four... Mora, Trin, Glisten, and Rhylanor.
Pallique is TL 14... and that\'s about *it*.

I\'m writing a T4 supplement for GoldRush Games.  The supplement is about 
a small confederation of worlds, and in it will be two deckplans for
small, locally-made ships. 

I\'m checking opinions here to see if the following format would be 
acceptable:

1) The USP

2) A brief description of the ship (300-400 words)

3) Crew rooster (usual and minimum)

4) Deckplans on the order of those in Traders and Gunboats, but 1.5 m squares,
and numbered rooms.

5) Descriptions of each number room


I could do 1 or 2 m squares, but 1.5 is the closest thing to standard
Traveller has and 0.5 m squares give too many lines for my taste. 

Comments greatly appreciated-

Yet another flagrant misunderstanding of the meaning of the term "censorship."
Prohibition of self-censorship is a worse infringement on freedom: would
you force WalMart to carry all CD\'s ever produced?  Must the 7-11 in rural
Gopher Junction, South Dakota carry smutty magazines?  Should newspapers
print Holocaust revisionism advertisements?  This is just a poorly-thought-
out straw man.  Which is to say, it makes no sense.

As Bolie Williams so aptly pointed out, self-censorship is common and
necessary in all people but the insane.  Often it goes by the name of
"tact."  Which this list lacks in astonishing variety (see the above re:
\'insane"?), and is all that Ken Whitman was asking for in the first place.

For that matter, I suspect Marc Miller would have produced T4 with our
without this list.  We helped shape it, certainly.  But don\'t arrogantly
inflate your own importance: viz. previously posted comparisons of the
size of TML vs. IG\'s worldwide sales, which bring to mind previous
comparisons between the size of a scout/courier and a dreadnought.

ObTraveller:  Doesn\'t sodium pentathol work by removing rational self-
censorship, in order to make victims babble on and hopefully divulge
useful information?  Might a more tightly-focused version (perhaps, say,
making the victim shut up but then say everything he thought when verbally
prompted?) appear at higher tech levels?  How does high-tech questioning
and interrogation go about?

A good Art Director isn\'t _just_ an artist. In fact, an Art Director
doesn\'t even _have_ to be an artist! (just look at me :-) But an Art
Director knows the art must serve a purpose.

Yes, a thousand times, YES.

 I didn\'t think IG had an art director in the simple fact that they were
only working with two artists. A good art director will probably also
assemble and oversee a team of freelancers. Unfortunately, art and art
direction is often one of the first things a publisher sees as a "luxury."
Look how quickly art direction in the final GDW releases plummeted. From
the poorly designed covers (the elements are good, but not used to their
greatest potential) to the interior art (poorly used, whether you like or
dislike it), to the typefaces, this is one area IG *really* needs to shore
up.

 But then, as a graphic artist, I may be biased. :-)

High Guard had a hull type of \'Dispersed Structure\' rather than open
structure, which does describe most any of the Star Trek ships.
Except the original, seen only once in Classic Star Trek, Romulan Bird of
Prey, which was a semi disk shape.

Open frames and Dispersed structures are not the same thing. As noted above,
the open frame is a basic grid work to which interchangable modules can be
attached as needed. A dispersed structure is one where different parts, of
different shapes are connected together as suits the purpose. The Discovery
of 2001 is a dispersed structure becase the reaction drive, powered by a
fission reactor had to be separated from the living area to prevent
contamination. The Enterprise design put the primary living quarters into a
separately detachable module, the saucer, apart from the Warp Drive and the
associated potentially unstable Matter/Antimatter fuel supply, the lower
cylinder plus nacelles. Makes jettisoning runaway powerplant easier.

Having played Traveller since the "Black Book" days,  I can honestly say
that with each new "edition/incarnation" of Traveller there has been
something, if not many somethings that I have not "liked, or felt could
have been done better" about each item.  But, as I did, if you don\'t like
it then change it in your game.

I guess what I\'m trying to say is that Traveller (as designed,without GM
input) cannot be "All things to All Traveller Fans" and that we should
accept and work with the system to make it what we want it be.  Whether
this means changing ship designs, combat systems etc.

I am a firm beliver in CONSTRUCTIVE criticism!!,  I feel that it, when
used/stated with respect and tact, can be one of the most helpful forces in
the design process.  While no doubt exists that as end consummers we should
have a larger voice in the "Constructive Criticism" area we must always
remember that without the efforts of the designers we\'d still be playing
the "Black Book" era. 

Well now that I\'ve spouted these personal opinions for all to see, I await
the flames!!

But lets try to remember that everyones opinion matters/counts it\'s just in
how you state that opinion that will affect how it is recieved and replied
to.

	Congratulations Thomas, you have just recreated FF&S.  SSDS was written in 
response to all of the people who wanted to design starships but didn\'t want to have 
to trudge through all the dreaded formulae in FF&S.  So we (mostly Dave Golden, 
Merrick Burkhardt and others but I like to think I helped) created a simpler version 
of FF&S with lots of plug-in components from tables.  In fact all of the values on the 
SSDS tables were created with and are totally compatible with FF&S.  If you want the 
formulae, you can simply get the book; this is also likely to be more accurate than 
trying to reverse engineer them from the tables.
	An updated, and hopefully clarified version of FF&S for T4 called the Naval 
Architect\'s Handbook, is being designed slowly but surely over on the beta list.
 
> This leads to a question: how do I subscribe to the GDW-Beta list?
	gdw-beta@qrc.com with "subscribe" in the subject line should do it.  New folks
are added by hand by the list admin, Derek Wildstar, who I gather is busy right now, 
so there might be some delay. 

>  Since

	For those who are less than satisfied with SSDS, let me just point out that the
system was designed by a group of volunteers taking time out of their _personal_ lives
and that Don Perrin gave us only a week to give him the completed product.  Given that
Don and IG then sat on the design system for another 5 months of their _professional_
lives to produce a set of ship designs and deckplans which don\'t even all conform with
SSDS, decide for yourself where the "jug broke" as you put it.
	Yes, there should be more detailed text and descriptions of what everything
does, yes, there should be a good design example, and if we had had more than a week
all those things would have been included.  As it was, we delivered an almost errata
free product on time.
	*Please Note*  I am speaking only for myself here, not for anyone else on the *
*SSDS/QSDS design team.  I haven\'t even discussed this with them so I have no idea how* 
*they feel about it and I don\'t want anyone on the TML or at IG thinking I am putting *
*words in their mouths.                                                               

(/rant mode on)
	If I sound a little bitter it is only because we could have made the Starships
book a whole heck of a lot better and we were willing to work for *free*.  In fact,
we\'re not alone.  I hope that IG does publish The Long Way Home and other CORE products
as official IG material, and I hope that they begin tapping the incredible stream of
creative output available absolutely free from Traveller\'s many devoted fans.  IG could
do a lot worse than simply farming out the development of supplements to groups of fans
and merely checking them for appropriateness before publishing them. Yes, it all needs 
to be consistent and have a good Traveller feel, but with the volume of output from 
Traveller fandom, even if only 10% was any good, they\'d have a complete line for each 
Milieu.

	G-tanks are fluid filled tanks in which crew or passengers sit which help 
negate the physiological effects of excess accleration.  A g-tank negates 1G of 
acceleration but has no effect on Gs due to evasion.
	The effect of excess Gs is game system dependent.  Since we had very little 
idea what the T4 rules or task system would look like we didn\'t want to make up 
something that wouldn\'t be compatible.  Furthermore, we figured that IG would create 
its own rules for this sort of thing.  Apparently they didn\'t.  My suggestion is that 
for every uncompensated G greater than 2 (for strapped in crew) or 1 (for non-strapped 
crew), every task difficulty is increased by one.

	Ship design is inherently iterative.  I suggest that it is easier to 
over-estimate the size hull you\'ll need and then shrink it to fit than vice-versa.

	If so, then you might as well make up your own rules because the ship design 
system for T4 is based on FF&S.

	The combat system should tell you what the effects of EMM are.  EMM stands for
Electro-Magnetic Masking, if that is what confused you.  Stealth is a low-tech version
of EMM which works against radar and HRT sensors but not PEMS or AEMS.  Basic
life-support is for short trips (<12 hours) and includes air, water, a little food, and
a tank for waste.  Standard life support is for trips of weeks length and recycles air,
water and (maybe) food.  The inertial damper table tells you how many Gs the inertial
damper equipment can cancel out for each TL. 

Happy Travelling.

And an interesting way for the mob to get rid of embarrasing bodies.  Way

"Psionic Effect"?  Hmmmmmm.. might explain why the Zhodani haven\'t expanded

When you write up the USP, consider mentioning wether or not the ship is
Streamlined, Airframe, etc. 

I\'ve personally always liked the 1.5m square, but then I used it for
snapshot and enjoyed that system too. Sounds great otherwise.

to be sung to a theme from Gustav Host\'s "Jupiter, The Bringer of Jollity"
in "The Planets" which I\'ve always thought deserved some words.  (For

Not So, mon frer... Most persons find black on white easy to read, but a
huge minority (dyslexics and those with scotopic sensitivity) find the
contrast too great. Black upon soft, colors (yellow, soft pink, soft rose,
or sky) are used for minimum reading problems by the aforementioned
minority. And, normally, those are easily readable by the vast majority.

OTOH, White or slightly off-white papers are cheapest to purchase, and
SERVE the majority.

[Sorry, Disability Awareness kick. My mailer is set to black on sky so I
can read it. Otherwise, I get many transposed letters, and letters
in-between lines, and flipped, etc... and I\'m only MILDLY dyslexic. It\'s
entirely a problem with brain function. And judging from the consistant
typos on this list, I figure there are quite a few dyslexics on here.]

What I should have done is list the 3 forms I am objecting to:
	External Censorship
	Imposed Self-Censorship by custom (as was seen on the WFRP lists)
	Customary requirements (without formal penalty, but customary penalty)
As for the WFRP lists: they required you to adhere to the very limited
mores and interests of the group in order to be "accepted". Failure to do
so was flamed beyond belief.

Also, to many of us Alaskans (Part of the USA)... Censorship has different
connotations; It has connotations not of rational limitations, but of
Limitation for Irrational or oppresive purposes, or to limit rational
communication in an unfair or undesireable way. All of which apply to Mr
Whitman\'s cry.

If you use the broadest sense of the term, technically you are correct. I
made the mistake of utilizing terminology with (obviously) very different
connotations.

A requirement to censor one\'s self is as bad as a forcible blocking of
material, Assuming that said censorship is not the rational, literral,
blocking of the undesireable you [pl.] assumed. <sigh> Yet another reminder
of the SEVERE linguistics gap between the various sub-languages, languages,
and dialects collectively known as "English".

Your scale will work pretty well.  With 1 square equal to 9 stere, you will
have 3 squares equal to 27 stere..or right at 2 traveller displacement
tons.  

3 squares/ton works pretty well. <G>

Personally, I\'d go for lower overheads as in...

Length = 1.5
Width  = 1.5
Ceiling (2.2) + Overhead (0.91) = 3.11   

1 Square = 1.5 x 1.5 x 3.11 = 7 stere = 1/2 displacement tons.  This works
really well for me.  

Engineering, cargo, and specialty spaces would be deeper.  I
try to keep them multiples of the standard cube, foex doubling the depth
gives you a 5.31 (17ft) deep cargo hole below the overhead with 1
ton/square.

ps.  What\'s the abbreviation for stere...st? <g>

I think this is a real problem, but hard to address.  Social changes on just a 
single planet over 2000 years would be hard to imagine, much less large chunks 
of interstellar empire.  Even with high communications technology and 
prevalence (ie a global village), there will be a tremendous amount of change 
(and with the 1+ week jump time between worlds, they will drift considerably 
between worlds, even in the same interstellar political unit).

Some common themes that I think will drive differences in ship design are:

Military Ships

   The basic idea is making something harder to damage for an acceptable 
   price; or easier to maintain. Changes in doctrines of weapon use would give 
   rise to different designs (as long as they weren\'t too far from optimal - 
   or the idea doesn\'tt survive long enough to become doctrine!).

   The following two ideas are somewhat at cross-purposes, but different 
   cultures, or different military philosophies might give rise to one or the 
   other.

   Distributed Jump Drives

      Since the grid is distributed all over the hull, then it makes sense 
      from a damage-control point of view to spread out the jump drives also. 
      This makes it less likely to lose the whole wad at one time - perhaps 
      just a degradation in performance as \'jump drive nodes\' are lost.

   No Jump Grid

      Since the grid is distributed all over the hull, then it can be easily 
      damaged - I think there would also be research into making something 
      like a centralized jump field generator.

   Perhaps a government would be willing to sacrifice some performance to gain 
   tougher systems?

Civilian Ships

   Economics and competition would certainly drive some changes.
      "Why pay 34MCr for the competitor\'s plain-jayne sportster when you can 
      have a BeebleBrox9000 (C) SuperYacht (TM) with our famous \'mini-fresher 
      in every stateroom\' and our \'super-state room\' - twice the size with 
      wet-bar and entertainment center... for a mere 36MCr (tags and title 
      extra)"

   Enhanced State Rooms
      The possibilities are endless.  Everyone (except perhaps the strictly 
      luxury ships for the ultra-rich) would be looking at cost per passenger 
      types of ratios - the consumer market would basically drive what kinds 
      of facilities would be considered acceptable.  And this would vary 
      dramatically from world to world and century to century.

   Specialized Cargo Holds
      An earlier thread talked about transporting live animals one way and 
      then something else the other way.  Design philosophies would evolve to 
      handle these problems - a multitude of 200 ton trader designs (forex) 
      meant for different kinds of cargo.  I\'m sure modular designs (like a 
      giant version of the modular cutter) would become the standard for some 
      cultures.

One big thing about ship design philosophy:  Given that starships and related 
systems are critical military technologies, how much freedom would commercial 
shipyards really have?  I\'ve always thought that civilian starships would be 
at a tech level lower than the current military ships.  T4 answers part of 
this question by having different civilian versus military systems.  I still 
think that the Navy would have ships a tech level ahead of what they would 
admit - at least some of the sub-systems...

        Before you go trying to reverse engineer all of SSDS... pick up
FF&S. That\'s what was used to create SSDS. All the equations are in there,
although the organization wasn\'t the best.

        And the new, improved version of FF&S is being worked (albeit with a
minor hiatus due to family crisis and holidays on my part) on the GDW-Beta
list as the "Naval Architect\'s Handbook." Check my web page for the (not
very recent) latest.

The drop tanks are unstreamlined cylinders with a 4g rating.
They cost 39 KCr and mass 22 tons for a pair.

The maneuver rating is only 2.5g when the actual mass of the
spacecraft is taken into consideration.  More would require
the sacrifice of some armour.

I am quite pleased with how close this comes out to the Gazelle 
listed in Traders and Gunboats.  The deckplans require only the
removal of the venteral barbette, and the replacement of the
dorsal barbette with a spinal mount.  Above the second deck will
be the NPAWS fire-control station and some maintenance hatches.
I\'m glad spinal mounts are now within the reach of 300 ton 
spacecraft.  My players rarely encounter anything larger than
1000 tons.

There is now a crew of 11 instead of the original 12.  They are
the captain, the medic, the pilot, the navigator, four engineers,
four electronics technicians and two gunners.  The commander, 
pilot, navigator and chief engineer are the officers and have
staterooms on the lower deck.  The medic has a stateroom to herself
on the upper deck, and the others share the remaining three.

As I recall, Fighting Ships vessels didn\'t stand up too well when brought
against ships designed for Trillion Credit Squadron style games.  

When the Naval Architect book comes out, I\'d like to see a page with
tournament standards similar to what was in TCS.  That way, people can
compete their squadrons at conventions and the winning squadrons can make
it into the T4 Fighting Ships.  Besides, the old tournament rules made it a
lot easier to play pickup combats at conventions.

I have the T4 Rulebook (of course).  I also have lots of CT stuff, 
but I stopped buying Traveller when MT came out.

I guess I expected T4-Starships to be, when taken with the basic 
rulebook, a standalone product.  Perhaps like an improved High Guard, 
which included revised combat rules that explained how all the 
new goodies in the improved design sequence would affect game play.  
For example, it would be nice to know how uncompensated Gs affect 
the crew in T4. An explanation of _what_ a G-tank _is_ would also 
have been nice.

So, now that I have T4 and T4-Starships, what MT or TNE books am I 
going to have to buy to explain how T4 starships work?

Patiently hoping IG gets their stuff together,

Bingo!

This is exactly why. using High Guard, my design philosophy for 
capital ships (mostly battle riders) was to pick the meson or 
Particla Accelerator spinal mount I wanted to carry and build 
the smallest ship that could carry it at manuever 6 and 
agility 6.  If you don\'t have to carry jump drives, it can be
amazing what you can fit into a (relatively) small hull. 

I enjoyed designing HG ships because the system is robust and not 
overly complex(as is FF&S, IMHO).  But most of all, I knew how the 
design choices I made would affect game play, especially combat.  
That is my chief complaint about T4-Starships - SSDS allows anyone to 
design a ship fairly easily, but there are no rules about how these 
ships _work_.  I like to build ships that are efficient within the 
rules of the game.  There is not enough info in T4-Starships to do 
this.

Everybody has their own take it, but this is the way I do it....

...each individual sees something different.  Generally, it\'s
described as "swirling, psychedelic, mind-numbing, colors"; "uh, I can\'t
remember"; "utter blackness"; "flat grey..just nothing there", or
"darkness, sucking me down, swallowing me up"...something like that. <g>

The effects of even a quick glance is enough to grab some people and lock
them into slack-jawed catatonia...sometimes just until someone pulls them
away, sometimes forever.  On most people, it\'s not immediately disabling,
but continued exposure produces psychotic symptoms in *all* sentient
beings.  And this is just *looking* at jumpspace.  The higher the psionic
rating of the character the more problems they have with jumpspace.

If the protective field produced by the hull\'s jump grid weakens the crew
is in *bad* trouble!  If it fails, well, they\'re dead!

The way I play it, the protective field forms a shield between the ship and
jumpspace.  If that shield weakens the ship begins to disintegrate. The
sanity of the crew goes first, but with further weakening actual matter
begins to disappear...imagine the ship beginning to disappear, in bits and
pieces, all around you.  

If the shield completely fails then the ship and everything in it is gone,
Gone, GONE!

How does that sound? <g>

Interesting... My intention wasn\'t to marginalize those with disability. 
I just wanted to make the point that books are printed black on white 
with good reason.

Pah! Today I *biked* to work. It was -26 deg C (-15 deg. F for you Yanks) 
Wait till January. That\'s when it gets *really* cold. :-)
