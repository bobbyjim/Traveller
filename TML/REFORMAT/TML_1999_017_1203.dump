I would point out that this often entails recruiting from high
population, low-tech worlds.  The colonial forces, OTOH, are generally
limited to recruiting from the home population.

This is very similar to a lengthy post I sent a couple of weeks ago. 
The biggest single change I would propose is that there are a number of
small (division or smaller) units that are at the disposal of the Sector
General Headquarters.  This permits the deployment of units larger than
Marine regiments for contingency operations.  (Yes, _I_ grew up in XVIII
Airborne Corps....).  In FFW, this applies to the 8 divisions, 4
brigades, and 4 regiments of the Imperial Army.  The 6 corps and 8 Field
Armies are subsector forces in peacetime.  The numbered colonial units
are, IMTU, similar to the US Army Reserve, while the named colonial
units are equivalent to the National Guard.

remain within \'Holy Canon\'.  In my Traveller Universe (IMTU for all those
new folks who may not have learned this one yet!), the Imperial Army exists
only as a cadre structure (Corps and Army-level units only).  The maneuver
units are all pulled in from Imperial Worlds at teh request of the
subsector or sector Duke or the domain Archduke.  For rapid-response, the
Imperial Navy has its Marines, and the local duke/archduke has a Commando
Brigade available from the Corps-level full-time cadre, and perhaps other
forces as well.  Each subsector has at least one IA Corps cadre, and some
have several, with one or two IA Army cadres to boot.  These get combat
divisions assigned to them from the levy that is raised by the
duke/archduke\'s request.

The levy units are of two classifications: IA-Standard and Colonial.  The
Imperial Army-Standard units adhere to the published IA standards for
equipment and organization.  A planet that has IA-Standard units gets to
pay for them (at least partially) by reducing their planet\'s contribution
to the Imperial Defense Budget.  The Imperium gets a ready reserve of
properly-equipped troops, and the planet effectively gets top-of-the-line
units for half price.

Colonial units are raised totally at the planet\'s expense, using local
equipment that may not be quite up to IA standards.  The planet still finds
this advantageous, since he can equip his units from the local economy
without having to meet rigorous Imperial standards.  The Imperium only
calls up high-quality Colonial units, and due to the potential logisitcal
issues these units will often be deployed on worlds with Tech Levels
similar to the home planet of the unit.  However, if needed Colonial units
will be deployed at thefront line right alongside Imperial MArine, Army and
Army-Standard units.

The cadre units fall into several categories:

1.  Special Operations Units (each Corps has a Commando Brigade and a
PsyOps Battalion).  Army cadre includes more of the same, and some more
esotreic units (usually in the company to battalion size range).
2.  Headquarters Units.  Not just HHC, but also communications units,
Military Police Brigades, Logistics units, etc
3.  Specialist Units.  Port Service companies, Engineering Brigades,
PointDefense Brigades, Orbital Transport Squadrons, Medical units, etc.

Probably not the way most people do it, but variety is the spice of life!

The section on "super lasers" is *very* interesting. They\'ve got a
"modest tabletop laser" with an intensity of 3e17 W/cm^2. And the pulse
duration is 3.5e-14 sec (I get 10.5 kJ/cm^2). Fired into a jet of
Deuterium gas the jet exploded fusing some of the deuterium into
Helium-3.

Apparently the energy in the laser pulse is converted to kinetic energy
in the gas with *high* efficiency, then the fusion adds even more
energy. He speculates about developing this into a propulsion system. 

Sure sounds like Heplar to me! Only a lot less bulky.

Well, whatever the temp, that recombination will have a higher Isp than
*any* other chemical fuel. By quite a bit. 

The helium will drag down the performance.

Well, if you check my other posts, you\'ll find that we may be on the
way to developing "HEPlar" in the real world. Laser initiated, fusion

While "ellipsoid" is technically correct, "oblate spheroid" is a better
description (and Niven\'s Jinx is a "prolate spheroid"). 

Mesklin is *very* unlikely. But not impossible. If you somehow *did*
get enough mass acuumulated *and* keep that sort of spin, it *would*
lose most of the hydrogen from the equatorial regions.

Doesn\'t sound like the "Cycle of Fire" I recall. As I recall, we had
a world that was either orbiting two stars, or in a very eccentric
orbit. Thus it has long periods of "Earthlike" conditions, and lopng
periods of what we would consider *extremely* hot conditions. The two
species alternate in using the world. The hot cycle species has refuges
in geothermally active areas, the cold cycle species have refuges in
the ice caps (which shrink severely during the hot periods, but don\'t
go away).

True, and a major part of my "Clouds of War" campaign..

Kiri and Glenn, DO NOT READ!!

Strouden has close to 80% of Lunion\'s population.  The Sword Worlds and Ine
Givar are help to stir up trouble between the classes on the planet.  The
idea is to lock much of the subsector\'s Army in a nasty, N. Ireland-like
confrontation that will fray the combat readyness of the mostly-Stroudenese
Army units.

I\'m sorry to say it, but all of the materials that I\'d used in my 
Traveller/SL game vanished long ago, so I can\'t give you any details.  I used 
the maps and rules, and made up a bunch of handmade counters.  The player 
characters recieved individual counters, appropriately rated for their skills 
and stats for a result simialr to a hero counter, but with more varied 
morale.  The players were allocated the support weapons which they had (which 
wasn\'t much).  The locals were generally represented by multi-man counters, 
for example a 3-2-7 might be used to represent 10-15 archers, with individual 
counters for the various local leaders.  It worked out pretty well, everyone 
agreed that this experiment felt more like a real field battle than the 
altrnatives.  I was especially pleased to see that the players had an impact 
on the game, but the locals got their licks in as well.  Two of the eight 
players blundered out into a field into the path of a cavalry charge, and 
were hacked to death by swords in melee combat.  The rest of my memories of 
this experiment have become misty with age.  Get some blank counter sheets 
and give it a try.

I\'m sure I\'ve got "No Night Without Stars". I\'m not sure about "Yurth
Burden".  While I probably own them, I haven\'t read & re-read the post
70s stuff *nearly* as much. So I don\'t recall it as well. 

Another one that just jumped out at me. "Dark Piper"(?). The one with

an an archeological "dig" in some lava tubes. When there\'s an attack or

I note that your "list" doesn\'t include *any* of the "singleton" books.
That is, the ones with no sequels or super-close ties. 

Also, you can go *nuts* trying to tie Norton\'s books together. I
believe that Catseye (or one of the other books dealing with Forerunner
artifacts) has a passing reference to the Caverns of Arzor. Which ties
that book/series to the Hosteen Storm books. Only problem is, in the
latter series, Earth has been rendered uninhabitable. Yet I can show
links equally good to books like The Last Planet. :-)

Galactic Derelict, and the books that follow almost *have* to be the
source for the "Jump tapes" in Classic Traveller. And they make a
*damn* good gimmick for "coming out of the Long Night" type scenarios.

I sort of suspected that it might be del Rey. It seemed like his style.

Rocket Jockey was reprinted in paperbacvk in the late 60s or early 70s.
And under del Rey\'s name. It\'s also the (obvious) source of one of the
scenarios for GDWs old Triplanetary game.

I don\'t recall if I have a paperback of "Trouble on Titan" or not. But
I read all three back in the 60s.

I recall a novel about an alien being the first alien trained as a
doctor by humans. This was in a universe where sort of like Norton\'s
"Star Guard" humans had been assigned a "slot". In this case "medical
work".

Well, as far as the Winston stuff goes, here\'s the (partial) list of
them from the dust jacket of one of mine:

"The Ant Men" by Eric North. I think I\'ve seen it once, maybe even read
it. But I\'d sure like a chance to read it again just to find out. 

"Attack From Atlantis": Lester del Rey. I\'ve got the paperback.

"Battle on Mercury": I\'ve got the Winston edition. I first read it
around age 8 or so, and then couldn\'t find it again until my late
teens. I re-read it, and *that* time I remembered the title/author. I
finally found a copy about 10 years ago.

"Earthbound": Milton Lesser. Read it a number of times, as I recall it
was so-so. \'Typical\' "boy flunks out of academy, makes good anyway"
plot.

"Five Against Venus": Philip Latham. I read it once, many years ago.
Might be nice to re-read. Note: "Philip Latham" was a pen name for
noted astronomer Robert S. Richardson!

"Islands in the Sky": Arthur C. Clarke. I\'ve got the paperback. This
has been reprinted zillions of times. 

"The Lost Planet": Paul Dallas. No idea. Don\'t think I\'ve ever seen it.

"Marooned on Mars": Lester del Rey. It\'s ok. It\'s also what this list
is on the back of . :-)

"Missing Men of Saturn": Philip Latham. Another one I\'ve read once. I
do recall the interesting point that he (correctly) speculated that
drinking heavy water wouldn\'t be good for you. 

"Mission the the Moon": Lester del Rey. I\'ve got the paperback. 

"Mists of Dawn": Chad Oliver. Never seen it. 

"Moon of Mutiny": Lester del Rey. I\'ve got it in paperback. 

"The Mysterious Planet": Kenneth Wright

"Planet of Light": Raymond F. Jones.  No idea,.

"Rocket to Luna": Richard Marsten

"The Secret of the Ninth Planet": Donald A. Wolheim. Don\'t recall if
I\'ve read it, but I\'m pretty sure the whole "series" was reprinted.
Probably by DAW books. :-)

"The Secret of Saturn\'s Rings": Donald A. Wolheim. See above.

"The Secret of the Martian Moons" see above.

I think I\'ll stop now... :-)

Well, in the case of "First Cycle", it\'s *not* a "planet & moon". It\'s
a "double planet". Virtually the same size, and orbiting a common
center of gravity *between* the two planets. 

I think this was an attempt at another of the "Twayne Triplets" such as
Uller Uprising. That\'s because a nearly *identical* set of planets
shows up in a James Blish story in Analog in the early to mid 50s. I
don\'t recall the title and my collection is in storage. Worse, U\\I only
have one or two out of the *four* parts, and the conclusion is one of
the ones I\'m missing.

    This is certainly possible (compare with the French government\'s policy 
of favoring the Parisian dialect as "real French" to the detriment of the 
others, thus reunifying France as a linguistic entity).   Once contact and

I agree.

A canon statement on languages is in the MT Imperial Encyclopedia:
<quote>
Anglic:  The official language of the Third Imperium.  A distant descendent
of Terran English, Anglic was the language of the Rule of Man (-2294 to
- -1776).  Anglic remained a common interstellar language for trade and
commerce during the Long Night.  Its widespread use on the original worlds
of the Third Imperium made it the natural language when the Imperium was
established.

On many worlds, Anglic is only a second language used for system traffic
control, commercial operations, and interstellar communications.  Anglic is
sometimes called Galanglic for (Galactic Anglic).

The Imperium has not been able to prevent the emergence of a wide variety
of Anglic dialects.  Interstellar communications, holocrystals, and
recordings help to spread a uniform pronunciation of Anglic throughout the
entire Imperium.  Within the Imperium, any Anglic speaker can understand
almost any other, but isolated communities on worlds with little contact
with the interstellar trade lanes shift their speech patterns to form
dialects.  In addition, broad areas within the Imperium have established
their own pronunciation patterns;  accepted dialects include Rim (which
includes Terra), Core (the central region of the Imperium), Riftian (the
spinward frontiers), and Transform (the Antares region).
</quote>

One alternate language that might be kind of fun is a Vilani-ised Anglic,
along the lines of Melanesian Pidgin.  Essentially what you would have is a
vocabulary mostly drawn from Anglic, and a Vilani grammar.  This would be
predominantly spoken by non-Anglic speakers, and would represent their
appropriation of the language for their own needs.  It would make most
sense in a situation where they spoke a variety of languages, with the
"Pidgin" emerging as a common language.  I can\'t quite work out why they
wouldn\'t just use Vilani with Anglic loan-words though - maybe Vilani isn\'t
a "native" language of these people either.  

We haven\'t got a lot of information on Vilani grammar, unless the
Language/Culture list has created it, so writing this gibberish might be
difficult.  It could be fun to use in a scenario though.  Of course, we
need to remember that the "Anglic" words could well be spelt phonetically,
with a "Vilani accent", so recognising them wouldn\'t be automatic.  There
may be some "Tok Pisin" somewhere on the Net, if you want examples of how
incomprehensible such a thing can be to a speaker of one of the root
languages.

Sure 5 second rounds for space combat is possible, but there are
going to be problems...um...opportunities that you might not like.

>> What I\'m trying to figure out is...
>>
>> How fast can a starship weapon fire?

There are some lasers rated at 800 shots per turn in FFS/BL.  The BL
turn is ?30? minutes, so...1800/800 = 2.25 seconds per shot.  Of
course, those are considered *very* rapid fire weapons.  At 1 shot
per 5 sec, you need a ROF of 360/30 minutes, still faster than you\'d
expect from most lasers or any PAW/Meson weapons.

What you\'re really interested in, I think, is keeping the players
involved in action, right?  You don\'t *have* to fire weapons every
turn.  You might want to allow weapons to fire every X turns, where
X is some number larger than one, and let the players continue to
act between shots.  They can try sensor locks, rush to damaged areas
to start repairs, sweat out the wait until they can fire again.

For lasers say maybe...

Turn 1               - Start charging up power cell

Turn 2 through (X-1) - Lock target while finishing the charge

Turn X               - Fire laser


For sandcasters maybe...

Turn 1 through (Y-1) - Move canister to launcher

Turn Y               - Launch canister


For missiles...

Turn 1               - Start moving missile to launcher

Turn 2 through (A-1) - Missile continues to move while the gunner
                       sets up the firing solution        

Turn A through (B-1) - Lock target and transfer data to missile

Turn B               - Arm missile warhead (don\'t want to do that 
                       until you\'re ready to fire it)

Turn B+1              - Launch missile         

Events could happen while weapons are being prepared to prevent the
players from following through.  I can see the players sweating out
the turns to see if they can get the shot off before they get hit or
something else "screws the pooch."

Heck, I can see a player saying...

"Abort, that missile sequence, they\'re lighting us up!  We\'ve got to
get sand out NOW!"

"Argh!  Only 2 turns \'til the the missile launches.  Hold on!  Hold
on!" 

<g>

Having said all that...I still think 5 second rounds will be too
short.  I\'m afraid you\'ll end up with lots and lots of turns without
much happening with an occasional flurry of harried and terrified
action.  

Hum, you know that sort of sounds like combat, doesn\'t it?  <g>

Good point! If you\'re turn is 5 seconds (I think I\'d use 6 like Ian, 10/min) and firing every turn then the odds of hitting on any one shot need to be *greatly* reduced.

What was the one where an non-coporeral alien criminal escapes to Earth and "hides" in the minds of various Earthlings (there was a bear among others, IIRC) from the policeman who is after him...and has to do the same thing?

Heavy Grav Belts are limited by the weight the Harness can carry, 
which would be how much the user can carry.  However, on High G 
worlds, the extra lift provided by the larger GravPacks should prove 
useful.  Just assume that the Harness is strong enough to carry a 
person that weighs 1000 lbs ... who knows what kind of nylon will be 
available at GTL10.

According to COACC and other MT sources, the "Imperial Army" is quite
literally:
1) Just a Subsector (and higher) HQ system
2) Every Imperial Subject world\'s standing troops, airmen and sailors (and
sometimes police).

So, IMTU, the "Imperial Army" dictates only the JIS ranks, and an
organizational model.... and deployments of local units by command for the
purposes of the 3I. Thus, the IA will NEVER have a "Base" in a system...
but each local world maintains bases for it\'s own forces, and marine and
naval bases have "Crash Overflow" capacity for units in transit. (Shades of
a certain B5 episode with General Franklin....)

As for the 5Fw forces, they are "Imperial Army" from the moment the unit is
comandeered by the SS HQ from local to imperial duties. IMTU, Regular
forces are forces maintained to "Specification" and often include Huscarles
and Subsector Tax Funded units answerable to the local moot. Colonial
forces are those that are either TL12-, Non-standard equipment,
under-equipped, or poorly trained...

When I read between the lines of the various Traveller materials, I get the same

Yes, that\'s the idea.  The ship the PCs are on will be boarded.  A fight will
ensue.  The character\'s ship will fight the enemy ship, and while this is going
on, the other characters will have to deal with the boarders.

The range for starship combat will take place on a micro scale (not the normal
thousands of kilometers usual in starship combat), so it is important to figure
out how often the opposing ships can hack at each other.

Plus, the dynamic on the PCs inside, dealing with the boarders, will be
something else.  Every round they waste not stopping the boarders their ship is
getting blasted to pieces.

It puts real pressure on the PCs to win the personal combat scenario (the focus
of the game), while in the background, dire consquences wait for their ship.

I wouldn\'t waste time with this sort of thing if the range was standard
thousands of kilometers.

Well, my focus is stated in the reply post I wrote to Nick Bradbeer.
Basically, I want to run a round (or a few rounds, as you suggest) of combat
inside the ship, then I want to do one round of starship combat, and cycle like
that.

1000 seconds (16.5 minutes) is way too long for this scenario.  The whole
interior fight will be over, and we\'re talking about range measured in meters,
not kilometers.

Maybe.  This is why I\'m asking questions.  I\'m happy with a 6 second personal
combat round and a starship combat round lasting a few to several personal
combat rounds.

I just don\'t want to wait 16.5 minutes for ships to fire.  I want to scale
things down and have that enemy ship pounding on the player\'s ship while they
are fighting for their lives inside the corridors.

Actually, the MT Rebellion Handbook has a section on the Imperial Army.
That arm of the military is just not as visible as the Navy and Marines
are, and like many have said already, planetary armies are usually brought
in to supplement the Imperial Army.

I see no reason that the Imperium would not maintain Imperial Armies for
when there is another xFW.  Marines are painted as reaction forces it seems,
so an standing army would not be something the Imperium would overlook.
Those original worlds of the Empire would probably have standing armies just
like we do in our r/w, only they would be united under the Imperial Banner.

Other member worlds of the Imperium would have their own standing armies if
they deemed warranting it/them, but the Imperium would surely maintain a
choice piece of real estate on many worlds for "Imperial Army Garrisons" (as
in the expanded generation system in Merc), as well as training grounds on
those worlds.

They would be RDF for instant deployment (as far as instant, spanning
parsecs goes) while the colonials (armies of the actual world governments)
made ready if needed.  There would be times that the Imperium would have to
field an Imperial Army to a world for deterrent value, to make it harder for
the enemy to establish a bridgehead, or to try and take back a local.

Colonial world armies would be used to bolster the number of IA troops on
the ground, garrison after a fight, or be bolstered by IA forces where
needed as mentioned above (deterrent, etc.).

It\'s not the 360 lb men that worry me (only the injured Gibson is that big,
right ... great line by Holmgren \'He\'s big enough to play guard and tackle.
At once.\') ... it\'s the 240 lb ones that run 40 yards in four point six or so.

Actually, the armour makes things worse, because it allows players to lead
with their skull without risking concussion. Unlike, say, Mark Carroll
(Mark is a rugby league player who actaully likes those day-after-the-game
film sessions. They let him remember what he did over the weekend).

Doug, it\'s worse than that.

There is no sendoff rule in Aussie Rules. At all. You cannot get ejected
from the game. They can throw the book at you afterwards (one bloke in
country NSW got 500 weeks for thumping an umpire), but you cannot be made
to leave the ground.

Oh, and if a couple of evenly-matched blokes are having a bit of a push and
shove, then the umpires just let play go on. If the ball comes close and
they keep fighting, the coaches will take them off the ground anyway.

The closing quotes go to Andy Platt, one of the hard men from Wigan.
\'Australian Rules. I\'ve seen Australian Rules. Rules ? What rules ?\' and to
Tony Lockett, one of the greatest ever Aussie Rules players. Tony Lockett
is a goalscorer, literally built like a linebacker (6\'3, 240 lbs) in a game
full of safeties and corners, and was known for many years for his quick
temper. His reaction to defensive holding was traditionally \'I\'m only going
to tell you this once. Do that again and I\'ll thump you\'. Very few
defenders attempted to illegally hold him, because doing so usually got you
both a 4-6 week break from the game.

PS If any of you guys know any NFL people ***sign Ben Graham*** ... he\'s
got a leg on him that makes Darren Bennett look like Daffy Duck. Last week
the guy punted the ball to halfway on a kickout ... 70 yards, easy. And
that was *against* the wind. Oh yeah, and he plays fullback, so you could
put him on man to man against a big slow wideout like Ricks in San Diego.

Clement wrote a sequel in the 70s "Through the Eye of a Needle."
Interesting book. Made me track down the first book.

Then you *don\'t* want reality.

In reality, you won\'t even *know* about the laser shots that miss you,
unless you are on the sensors. Even then all you *might* see is a faint
flash caused by the very small number of "off axis" photons produced
along with the actual pulse that does damage. 

Missiles that miss will again only be seen on sensors. And you\'d have
to either be in a weapons turret or on the bridge to tell when the ship
fires lasers at incoming missiles or at the other ship.

It would be possible to notice some noise and vibrations when a missile
is fired. Ditto for sandcasters.

Space combat ain\'t gonna be like the movies and TV. One of David
Gerrold\'s early books about Star Trek (The World of Star Trek) goes
into this in *great* detail in one chapter.

I\'d do the starship round *first*. If there are any hits, you can roll
to determine which combat round they\'ll happen during. 

Missile hits will be like you\'d expect only more so. *Big* blasts. Lots
of vibration and noise carried through the frame of the ship.

Hits from ship lasers or det-laser warheads will actually be more like
explosions than like the sereotypical "laser beam". 

So basicly, *any* hit will have aspects of "hitting the ship with a big
hammer". But misses will have to be actively *looked for*. 

Yes, believe it or not, a ship may not realize it is under attack (by a
distant vessel) until the first hit occurs! Near misses would have to
be *really* near for you to notice them. In space, laser beams are not
bright glowing lines (in *atmosphere*, on the other hand...).

In fact, this may be part of what makes piracy *possible*. The fact
that you can snipe at a ship and not have them *realize* it until they
are hit.

"Normal" starship combat ranges are in tens and more likely *hundreds*
of kilometers. 

At boarding ranges, many weapons can\'t be brought to bear. And many of
the rest will hit *automatically*.

No offense, but *nobody* closes for boarding until *after* the
defender\'s anti-ship weapons are gone. For one thing, it\'s not
*possible*. Any sort of boarding craft will be blown away before it can
lock on. That\'s because the chance to hit becomes 100% at *hundreds* of
km with ship mounted weapons.

This will have happened *before* they are boarded. By the time they are
boarded, the ship won\'t be able to fight.

As someone pointed out, he was talking about H. Beam Piper\'s "First
Cycle".  Speaking of which, I\'d like to put some of Piper\'s classics
on the "list"...

Piper seems to have been one source for CT gravitics, BTW.

"Little Fuzzy", "Fuzzy Sapiens", etc.
	source of the "speak & make a fire" rule for determining
	sentience.
"Uller Uprising" - essentially the Sepoy Mutiny in SciFi drag,
		except that the Brits in India didn\'t have atomic weapons.
"Space Viking" - source material for the Sword Worlds.
..and a whole lot of short stories.

        Hi, Kenneth!

        I did a short-story fragment which is posted on my Traveller website
which involves two ships working on each other for the last bit of it...
take a look at it and see if it gives you ideas
("http://www.atlantic-online.ns.ca/travller", "Traveller Fiction" Button) on
possible look and feel to "gotta play through it" starship combat.

        FWIW, I highly doubt that any competant/ experienced Marine is going
to willingly get into a boarding shuttle to try and dock with a ship that is
still combat-capable.  Most shuttles are less than 100dton, which means any
smart gunner will hit it with a laser and automatically score at least one
critical hit.  Which means that the Boarding Party has slim odds of getting
there;  then there is the issue that docking is a concensual issue...  if
one or the other ship doesn\'t want you to match docking gear, you won\'t.

        Continuing to fire on a ship that you are successfully boarding is
just as liable to kill your boarding team as any of the target\'s crew.
Which will make you extremely unpopular with your Marines. =)

        What I tend to role-play out during the combat sequences are things
like the damage control problems, the  Captain screaming at the engineer to
red-line a damaged power-plant so they can get a *bit* more agility, that
kind of thing.

    'body' => '	A little while earlier Stone Throw Industries posted their list of new
space to space missiles, and had poised the question about maximum
acceleration for the missiles.
Here\'s my take on the issue: 

[WARNING: Gearhead Alert]
	Traveller canon for CT and MT limited the Maneuver drive to 6g. Even
the special supplement for missiles limited their accelerations to 6g. I
don\'t know about the TNE and T4 systems (FF&S is not a book I own). 
	Gurps Vehicles (as stated in the post) makes no limits on space
acceleration capability limits. 
	So, Option 1: Arbitrary limit of 6g due to Canon. 
	Or, Option 2: No limits, make your missiles with the 30g accelerations.

	Third option is to calculate the Aerial Maneuver Rating (aMR pVE135) as
a vehicle with stall rating of 0 (TL-size modifier)/2. This gives most
missiles a maximum acceleration of between 5g and 6g. The problem
becomes if you apply the same aMR calculation to larger vehicles, their
maximum acceleration quickly drops to something pathetic. And it doesn\'t
take into consideration the material to structure the vehicle. 

	Fourth option. Calculate the Max Acceleration as (Structure TL)/2 then
multiply by the HP modifier for the frame Strength on pVE20. Building
most space ships with the medium frame gives you the 5g to 6g as
dictated by canon. Build the Extra Heavy frame for your high speed
missiles and you top at 20g to 24g. Which should be enough for anyone. 

	Thanks for your attention.

   And how long would that take to reach us? If it dropped sublight, how far

   In a way, this would probably be how we would get first indication of an

        Are you sure about SS-Missles having a limitation?  I seem to recall
that building 30g missiles was fine;  in fact, it made for *ugly*

Perhaps there is a setting that lets you lower the output and fire faster
for visual range encounters.  The lower power setting would still have the
same USP rating due to the range, but would be able to fire in time
increments measureed in seconds rather than minutes.

couple of people, that has local planetary armies united under an Imperial
command structure in times of conflict.  IMTU, this command structure is
(for historical reasons) integrated into the Imperial Marines.  Most worlds
boast at least some army units equiped to higher standards that the local
TL would suggest, but these are expensive and very difficult to maintain if
the world is besieged.  These elite units are not usually TL15, rather they
are limited by the TL of nearby worlds (especially nearby industrial
worlds).  Of course, small groups of hi-TL mercenaries (who are responsible
for their own equipment) may be in the employ of some
governments/corporations/ individuals on any world.

Thus, the "Imperial Army" will tend be dominated by the armies of the
hi-pop worlds in a subsector (rarely will it be practical to transport
significant armies across sectors).  This makes for some interesting
conflicts, for example TL15 Impy Marines spearheading an invasion supported
by TL8 Rethe Army units against the large local TL10 army which has scant
TL14 support.  Ortillery might be provided by the TL13 Regina Subsector
Navy with a TL15 Imperial Navy batron.

On the whole "Cycle of Fire" mystery, here\'s the link with Poul Anderson...

Poul Anderson wrote a book called "Fire Time" (which I believe is still in 
print in the US via Baen, it originally was printed by Ballantine in the 70\'s 
with beautiful "end papers" showing the planet and the orbit of the 
planet--I\'m not sure if these have made it into the Baen edition). The book 
is dedicated to "Hal Clement--Worldsmith". From what I\'ve heard, Hal Clement 
helped Poul Anderson design the planet, it\'s orbit, and it\'s inhabitants.

This book would also make a good Scouts/First In scenario. To summarize (and 
it\'s been years since I read it), the characters are caught on a planet 
during a war (religious in orientation) while the planet is also undergoing 
some...errrr..."interesting" changes (the orbit has some variation in it, to 
put it mildly). The aliens are alien, the humans act predictably ("To heck 
with the Prime Directive" more or less), it\'s a great book, like most of Poul 
Anderson\'s work...

On Hal Clement, yep, forgot to mention his other new release (Half Life). I\'m 
haunting the bookstores now.

On Mesklin, yep, maybe it wouldn\'t work, but who knows if we\'ll ever get jump 
drive! The way I run things, most of my players are more in it for the action 
and adventure, rarely have I ever gotten a player that has questioned the 
"science". So, we just accept the wacky planets I\'ve thrown in and go with 
the flow (heck, they\'ve even encountered the Well World and Tekumel at 
various points, along with Jack Vance\'s "Planet of Adventure" and others...)

On inspiration, I have used Julian May\'s Galactic Mileu for a couple one
shot games.  But by far one of the best sources that I\'ve mined has to be
M. K. Wren\'s Phoenix Legacy Trilogy (Sword of the Lamb, Shadow of the Swan,
and House of the Wolf).  It spans the solar system and one other system, is
very political, and is very imaginative.

You are reading too much into the scenario.  One ship is trying to "talk" to the
PC\'s ship.  The PC\'s say "OK", and the two ship come side by side.  An umbilical
is exteneded.  The bad guys walk across the connection umbilical to the airlock on
the PC\'s ship.

Inside the PC\'s ship, the PC\'s are waiting.  They know who these guys really are.
They\'re not here to just talk.

As the bad guys get into the airlock, the PCs hit all the overrides and open all
of the cargo bay doors--hoping to suck the bad dudes right out into space.

Some go.  Some survive.  And the ones that remain on the PC\'s ship are a little
pissed--thus the combat  inside the PC\'s ship.

The bad guy pilot says, "Oh shit!", and he hits the thrusters.  The two ships
break away from each other, twisting the umbilical between them.

Wa-laaa, we\'re in starship combat at close range too.

That\'s how it is going to go--not two hostile ships fighting, then closing to
boarding range.

Good old Leonard.  I\'m away from the list for a year and a half.  I come back, and
good old Leonard is still at his keyboard, plugging away.

I\'ve got a picture of this sad little guy, up late at night, a single uncovered

do whatever he can to get a rise out of someone.  It is all he has in his sad

        Hi, Ken.
        I do.  Leonard is a constant source of good information and reality
checks on the hard-science aspects of Traveller.  He contributes willingly
and richly to the level of conversation on the TML.  I don\'t recall ever
having seen him resort to the sort of mud-slinging you just did.
        I would suggest that in the future, if you are not interested in
someone\'s opinion or commentary about a question you pose, either do not
read it or do not ask the question.  Slamming someone for giving you the
straight dope on what you are asking about is the sort of behaviour which
gets you ignored.
        
        Respectfully,
        -- Michel

Anyway, Leonard is correct. I think that those two ships at that range

I\'m amazed that you, Kenneth, posted this? You do realize that this 
description (incorrectly spelled words and all) could easily fit a mental 
picture of you?

It\'s a freaking game. If you don\'t like what Leonard posts, fine. Respect his 
opinion as being (in the bigger picture) a fan of the game that we all 
admire. If you don\'t like him personally, please keep it to yourself or keep 
it to private e-mail!

I\'ve read everything you\'ve posted, Kenneth. I don\'t always agree with what 
you write, and I\'m certainly tired of seeing some subjects rehashed after 
they were beaten to death in the first place (half-die anyone?), but I\'ll 
respect your right to post and expres opinions.

Close range?  Try point-blank, in terms of starship combat.  Automatic
hits, up to the maximum ROF of the weapons.  Both ships are going to get
shredded if they open fire.  Hell, they\'re in the danger space of their own
missiles.  Possibly close enough for sand cannisters to function as KKMs.

Unfortunately(?) Leonard is right on the money this time.

You might want to handwave up something to hamstring the ships\' sensors
(nuclear EMP, jamming or something). Otherwise, at kilometer ranges, it\'s
hard to believe a starship laser could actually miss at all. (And taking a
hit every five seconds would knacker the ship pretty fast - especially since
they could prolly do the Star Trek thing and shoot individual bits off the
hull).

    I remember fighting out LBB (not High Guard) spaceship combats, and it 
seemed those were bad enough.  The only way that you ever got to boarding 
actions was to have both ships shot up so badly that only one could move, a 
little.  One fight was so bad that it ended up with the enemy ship trying to 
launch a carried GCarrier across to the PC\'s ships and them firing at it 
through open airlocks with laser rifles.  This is of course the best argument 
against poracy, if anyone fights back, you are out so much money in repairs 
that it just ain\'t worth it.  (This is not to say my campaigns don\'t have 
scads of pirates in them anyway, and if the version doesn\'t have pirate 
character generation, the first thing I do is whip a table up).

Beg to differ. The danger radius for a grenade is greater than the

Over the last week or so I\'ve added a few more logs to the site.

I found a copy of Mission File 1.1 so I edited it and uploaded it.
We completed Mission File\'s 1.10 and 1.11 so they\'re both up and ready for
you to read and I did a major edit/rewrite of Mission File 1.2 to make it a
little easier to read.

Let me know if you find the edited files easier to understand or am I just
wasting my time?

As usual all comments are greatly appreciated whether pertaining to the site
in general or the game itself.

In infantry basic, you throw two live grenades.  The first one goes about
five meters, the second about fifty.

Real world checkpoint. During the 1960s there were *chemical* powered
rockets with accels up to around one *thousand* g. Those were research
units. But they actually *flew*. 

There were actual "production" missiles (the old Sprint system) with
accels above 100 g. And they *tracked* targets. 

So 30 g is *nothing*. Just remember that for the same amount of
fuel/power the higher the accel, the shorter the time the missile can
be under power. That\'s *why* the rating is "g-turns". 

I think the Sprint would be rated something like 100-200 g-seconds. :-)

As noted above, for *missiles*, you should be able to go *much* higher.

And several more novels that you\'ve missed:

"Cosmic Computer" (aka "Junkyard Planet"). Set on Poictesme, which
*was* a forward staging base, and command center during the System
States War. None of the gear was worth the cost of shipping back across
interstellar distances, so they just sealed everything up and left.
40-50 years later, the locals are making a living by locating the
abandoned installations and salvaging the equipment.

"Four Day Planet" Fenris is an earthlike planet, except that it\'s solar
day is around 2200 hours (91+ days). 

Both Poictesme and Fenris would be nice places to drop on the map.
Poictesme would be great as a leftover from one of the Frontier Wars. 

And I\'m sure I\'ve missed others. 

Oh yeah, the "short story" "When in the Course..." is the *original*
version of Lord Kalvan of Otherwhen. Only it\'s not a person dropped
across timelines. It\'s a group of explorers looking for a planet that
they can lay claim to. And they find one. But it\'s already got humans
on it, at the late medieval techh level. And the group they first
contact is about to be overrun by their neighbors. So they help out
some. :-)

Personally, I figure that most of Piper\'s planets *belong* somewhere in
the Traveller Universe.

Uhh  - in reality it\'s a bit more complicated than we\'re all playing with
here, but....

Correct, for some hand grenades the shrapnel is lethal at a distance greater
than it can be thrown. These are classified as \'Defensive\' grenades, and the
assumption is that one throws it and takes cover. \'Offensive\' hand grenades
are either smaller or employ smaller shrapnel to reduce the lethal radius
below what one can throw.

However, it\'s also important to make a distinction between Half-Lethality
radius and danger area. Maybe at 6m there\'s a 50/50 chance of a shrapnel
hit. That\'s how far you want to put it from the bad guy. At 30m (the guy who
threw it) there\'s only a couple of percent chance of being hit by a piece of
shrapnel. However, that\'s a couple of percent higher than most folks would
care to chance.

Oh, aren\'t they just the most fun? <g>

I have a friend who lobbed one (fortunately a dummy with just the primer
charge) from tree cover, hit a branch about eight feet in front of him, and
watched the grenade land between him and his pair buddy. Never seen either
of them move so fast in my life...<g>

I\'m given to understand the biggest limit on acceleration is the ruggedising
of internal systems. Gyros and INS, for example, don\'t like really high
acceleration any more than humans do. Complex nuke/detlaser warheads could
be finnicky too.

But then as TLs increase, who knows how well systems will be able to cope
with severe conditions?

So I\'ll come down with my usual argument, which is that we can alter our
basic assumptions to end up gearhead-justifying almost any result you want
in your TU.

Indeed, it is the real 3rd book.  The other 2 you refer to are "Fuzzy Bones"
by William Tuning and "A fuzzy Odyssey" by an author who\'s name is so
strange I can\'t remember it.  :)

I too, prefer the fuzzies to be natives of the planet.  I use fuzzie
character types myself in classic Traveller.  Certainly they have low
physical stats, but their social and charisma are higher than normal.  Takes
a pretty grim Merc to blow away a cute, adorable little fuzzy critter.  :)

\'Grav ping pong\' as a defense against piracy, mutiny, etc, has been debated heavily.  Personally, I tend to assume that a standard grav belt will negate artificial gravity just fine.

Well, his scenario for *getting* to close range is plausible. But
missiles are likely to have safeties that won\'t even let them *arm*
until they are 100 km or more away.

As for anything else, it\'s like dueling with 50 cal machineguns at 10
paces... 

Or, just consider what would happen if *any* surface combatant in a
modern navy got *alongside* an enemy warship before they opened fire.
The ship that fired first would have an almost guaranteed kill. 

And given the relative masses and momentums of the ships, that
umbilical will snap almost immediately. God help anyone who gets in the
way.

Personally, if *I* had to *plan* for getting that close to another ship
while we were both armed, I\'d replace the doors on some cargo bays and
(and maybe a few weapons bays) with *heavy* armor (at least as goo as
the surrounding hull, maybe a bit better, containing firing ports and
mounts for heavy infanty/light armor type weapons.

Plasma guns, Recoilless rifles, artillery (prohectile and energy
weapons). That sort of thing. 

Of course, in his scenario, it sounds like the *players* rather than
the "bad guys" would be more likely to be set up this way.

And one of the reasons that there were *several* attempts to
re-introduce the sling (either strap and pouch type or the "staff
sling", not the y-shaped stick thing) when the modern grenade was
introduced. But they fell victim to the unfortunate fact that it takes
a *lot* of practice and training to use a sling in a manner that isn\'t
more dangerous to *you*. 

ObTrav: Marine and army boot camps keep a close eye out for recruits
from low tech worlds. Some "low tech" skills like sling, bow and
crossbow are *very* useful even at TL15.

A decent slinger would only need a little practice to get used to the
heavier grenade. Standard sling "bullets" in roman times were 4 ounce
(115g). So his range will reduce a bit. Which means he may only be able
to do 100-150 yards. Though without looking up figures for ancient
slingers I won\'t rule out 200 yards.

That still makes him an asset to a squad. Almost as good as a mortar,
but with the only extra weight being a few ounces of nylon and plastic
(a "GI" sling). And if he\'s any good he can *aim* the damn things. As
in "Which eye do you want it in?" (Or more to the point "You want the
grenade dropped through the driver\'s hatch or the commander\'s hatch?")

And if he runs out of grenades, rocks will do. Trust me, unless he hits
your helmet, a trained slinger *will* wound you if he hits you,
possibly even kill you. 

Bowmen and crossbowmen get sent to sniper school. 

So don\'t go sneering at those "barbarians" lined up at the enlistment
office. They may be more valuable than you are!

Some thoughts on Kenneth\'s insulting comments towards Leonard:

I think Kenneth may have been put off by Leonard\'s tone as opposed to his
words.  All those *asterisked* statements can give the impression that one
is talking with the kind of condescending emphatic tone that one uses with
a child: "No, *that* boot goes on the *other* foot, Timmy!"

None of this is to say that I condone what Kenneth said.  I think it was
mean and petty to attack someone like that.  And I don\'t think Leonard
intends to come off as condescending, but I have to admit that that\'s the
way I saw it in the first few posts of his that I read (several years
ago).

When you need it now, but it is inconveniently half-a-system away, the
Thunderbolt Shuttle gets it to you in a hurry.

Taking small packages across a star system in less time than you could jump,
this craft is the ultimate in raw power. With only a basic life-system, no 
stateroom, and nearly 7Gs of acceleration it is not for the faint-hearted. 
Indeed it is often used totally automated as a package delivery system.

There is no dedicated cargo space. Small packages have to be stuffed into the
access spaces in the drives and fusion reactor! There is around half a DT of
very small maintenance access spaces available.

The military also use these craft as high speed couriers. It is rumoured that
they use stealthed versions as very long range, ship killing missiles, though
this has always been officially denied.

That would be \'Golden Dream: A Fuzzy Odyssey\' by one Ardath
Mayhar.

I have all three canonical Fuzzy books, and both deuterocanonical
Fuzzy books.  While I prefer, emotionally, the idea of the
Fuzzies being native, I can\'t see it happening given the
information in LF and FS; fb and gd are attempts to explain those
oddities, and, in my opinion, reasonable ones.  FAOP doesn\'t
explain them in any way, and actually leaves the \'native origin\'
question open.

And I _do_ like the idea of Fuzzies in a Traveller campaign; I\'m
not sure whether I\'d restrict them in any way, or whether to
allow them to do anything reasonable within the limits of their
physiology (i.e., allow them human-level INT and EDU, but reduced
STR and END).

It depends how you see thruster plates work. IYTU , if thruster plates just
creates thrust, then you can 30g missiles and have the KKM from hell, given
enough acceleration. If Thruster plates manipulated space in some strange
way to provide movemnt, then 6g is the hard limit.

I personally see Thruster plates to be in the second catagory.  Missiles
have a hard limit of 6g. They can accellerate to near light speeds, if they
have the endurance. They dont have the worry of turning whatever inside of
them into anchovie paste.

At least his comment was on the technology - you may not like his opinion

has started out too personal.

I for one do not read his emails unless something extremely interesting
comes up. This is mainly due to his writing style and different views on
Traveller science.

I have read a book by Ben Bova (from the top of my head "How to write Space
Sci Fi\', but the book is at home so I can not get the name right). He had
an interesting point. In one of his stories, he mapped out exactly how his
spaceships worked. Yet he did not use any of this information in the story.

Why? They where not needed to progress the story.

The problem with real science, it is only as real as we think it is. Take
Space 1889 for example. That game was based on "real" scientific theories
of the day, and yet we know that such things as Ether are in fact
incorrect. We are still today coming across observable events that defy
realistic explanation, and some basis of foundation scientific theories are
being challenged by the lack of evidence predicted by these theories.

Traveller is set in a future far in the future. Thruster plates and Jump
drives are fact in this "fictional" universe. Scientific theories can be
observed and tested by observation in over 10,000 habitable systems. We
have only 1. They have had cultures not limited by the Terran mindset
exploring the universe. There have had a Mule character create a pocket
universe.

If you want to have a game of Traveller that is based on real science, it
is your right. People who like myself enjoy the sense of wonder imagining
are universe where humanity and aliens regularly laugh at the laws of
gravity, design vessels which make the Concorde look like a biplane, and
fight wars of senseless carnage.

On a personal level, Leonard, I wish you would not *accentuate * as often
as you do. That more than anything else deters me from reading your emails.

I agree it would be loads of fun in a campaign, it would sure help in
suspending ones disbelief. The only seriously lengthy campaign I have run (5
or so yrs), I developed the Common Tongue (it had started as an AD&D game)
around archaic english spelt with a phoenetic alphabet slightly more
comprehensive then the one we use. Somewhere around 40 letters IIRC, simple
enough for the players to quickly grok, and modeled after ours and the
russian one I can never spell. ;)
This gave two very good results. The suspension of disbelief and sharply
reducing the literacy of the players in respect to the game. The letters
were similar enough you could recognize many simple words, and the only
changes I made to syntax were to force myself to write the props useing the
language (wanted posters, correspondance, Royal Decree\'s, etc.) in an
archaic style akin to Henry David Thoreau. I love that guy. Occasionally if
I wanted the prop to be more arcane, I would switch to Elizabethan era
syntax and vocabulary.
Of course when one undertakes a task like that, it can take up a hell of a
lot of one\'s  time.
Are there any Traveller alphabets besides the fonts Binladi and whatever
that other one I saw was. Can\'t remember the name, goshdurnit! But these are
not supposed to be the alphabets used in the 3I, are they?

Yeah, I knew I would get flamed, but Leonard has always irked me.  He always
talks down to people when he responds.  Go back to the archive and check his
posts to people.  He\'s always like that.

When I used to participate on the list before, I never read his posts and

That\'s it for me on this discussion.  No use adding fuel to something that

    'body' => 'It\'s taken me a bit of time, but I think I\'ve come up with some Ideas to
help the conversion process along.

First for infantry fire rules.

Squads (and crews) are rated based on the weapons of the individuals

Firepower (FP) is largely a result of rate of fire
  1/3 FP for a revolver or bolt action weapon
  1/2 FP for a semi-auto weapon
  1 FP for 3/5 ROF
  2 FP for 10 ROF (Higher depending on ammo availability ALA german mg\'s)

Penetration (PEN)
  Because of the different personal armor options available in traveller, I
find the need for a PEN/ARM
comparison. (In SL there is of course only 1 armor type - none.)
  I worked it out based on the pen factors from Azhanti High Lightning. But
you can probably figure them out from your preferred resolution system. The
basic mechanism is if penetration equals or exceeds armor then you roll fire
resolution normally, If penetration is less than armor ADD the difference to
the fire res.
(SL is Backward that way.)
  For squads with mixed weapon types. determine PEN by multiplying each
weapons PEN by it\'s FP,
then dividing the sum for all weapons, then dividing by the squad FP rating.

Range (RNG)
  Determine effective range by dividing the weapons maximum range in meters
by 100 (remember that fire at up to double range is posible at 1/2 FP)
For the range of a squad with multiple weapon types use the procedure
outlined under Penetration (above)
substituting RNG for PEN in the calculations of course.

Morale (MOR)
   OK this one you just choose numbers that work
6 for green troops, 7 for regulars, 8 for elites or whatever scheme fits
YTU.

Leaders
  Leaders work like standard SL except use two ratings: Leader skill for
rally, entrenchment, etc.
and Tactics Skill for fire combat, instead of the catchall leadership rating
in SL.

  For vehicle combat and weapon charecteristics I think the easiest way to
do it is to assign armor mods and weapon capabilities on a basis of how the
various weapons/vehicles relate to each other in YTU (but partly this is
because I haven\'t had a chance to really look into this in any detail {Lots
of things going on at work})

  The really fun part is assigning "National Charecteristics" to the units.
As an example think about the Vargr; \'Vargr are frequently charecterised as
"inconsistent".... driven by dominance and... charisma." They would be more
likely to break but easier to rally... hmm... you could probably model them
with the americans straight out of the box. They are Dogfaces after all.
<big grin>

  Some other things that come to mind.

  Any unit equiped soley with Lasers and/or gauss weapons can fire without
automatically losing concealment. (perhaps a die roll depending on
circumstances)

  Many Grav-vehicles will have functionally unlimited movement points in
game terms, but noe efects would slow them down to a bit faster than an
Armored car.

  Lots of problems still to be worked out perhaps if others are interested
I\'ll work it out in more detail later.

NOTE: "Squad Leader is Avalon Hills trademark name for it\'s world war II
infantry combat game" and nothing in this posting is meant to infringe upon
said trademark or to be a replacement for the said game. If you\'re intereted
in squad level combat pick up a copy. It\'s a goodun.

Please note that I\'m an American so all errors of gramar usage and spelling
can be attributed to the fact that english isn\'t really my native tongue.

This will be my last post on the subject.  I don\'t think anything is to be
gained by continuing to talk about it.

Charles has it exactly right.  When I was on the list a year or so ago
(actually, I never left--I just haven\'t participated in a while because I
wasn\'t playing Traveller), Leonard was always condescending.  It got to the
point that I never read his posts.

So, I\'m back on the list, and boom, there Leonard goes again.  I ignored the
first couple of remarks, but he insists on keeping it up.

Now, I\'m back to ignoring Leonard again.  He just not worth reading.  Even if
he has something constructive to say, he\'ll get his kicks by letting you know
how much more he knows than you do.

At least, that\'s the way he comes off.  Go back through the archive and check
out his posts.  You\'ll see what I mean.

Thanks all,

Kenneth.

In JTAS 13, GDW announced that they won a lawsuit against the publisher of
two text-based adventure games, Space I and Space II, and GDW gained the
rights to them.

As you\'ve seen, they also sold several other titles, including a word
generator, a bestiary, and a trading program.  All these titles were offered
for the Apple 2e.

 When GDW closed down, the rights to this software reverted to Marc.

Recently, these titles have been re-released as freeware by Marc (due to the
effort of Paul Sanders and a group of dedicated Apple 2 users, who are
working to find the current owners of early Apple software, and trying to
get the software released as freeware), and are available as disk image
files, for use with an Apple 2 emulator.

There are Apple 2 emulators available for just about every OS, so everyone
can now enjoy these!

Recently, I\'ve been having some trouble getting to the main Apple image FTP
sites,  but I have Apple disk images of most of the Traveller disks, and if
you ask nicely, I can send them out via email.  If I get too many requests,
I may ask someone to host them on their website.

I have:
Space I Text Adventure
Space II Text Adventure
Trader (creates trade info)
Traveller (an updated version of Trader)
Word Gen (generates alien words)
Bestiary (generates encounter tables)
(I *don\'t* have the sector generator)

Warning! A .zip file of the all the files takes up almost half a meg.  If
you need a format other than Zip, I\'ll try to accommodate you.

IMHO, it\'s the presence of these hi-TL mercenaries that make the elite
units necessary.  The elite units, whether called Huscarles, or just plain
Guards, or whatever, exist both to serve in Imperial forces *and* to
prevent little gangs of hi-tech offworlders from pushing over local
governments.  Specifically, I use them IMTU to lean on PCs who feel like
throwing their weight around on lower tech worlds.  

What TL gear is required to bounce small mercenary/pirate attacks?  The
highest available, preferably matching or exceeding what the mercs have. 
It\'s expensive, but if it makes the difference between having your
government survive and having it overthrown, equipping a few battalions
with TL15 gear is a sound investment.

My only gripe with this would be that the more TLs you have in a single
force, the more complicated the logistics get.  It hardly seems worthwhile
hauling TL8 troops across interstellar distances, although, of course you
use the troops you have available.

This looks like fun.  I\'ve been fiddling about with the Ine Givar
organisations in Lanth and Regina.

My take on it is that the IG fragmented after the 5FW, and is only "now"
(1116-1120) getting back together again.  As a result the local "Regional
Committees" are organising fairly autonomously, and engaging in diplomacy
to negotiate cooperation between each other.

In Regina, I have a split between the pro-Zhodani Efate Regional committee,
and its allied planetary committees, and the independent Regina committee,
which has allies on the coreward worlds of Lanth.

In Lanth I have pro-Regina groups on Extolay and Dinom, pro-Sword World
groups on Ghandi, Lanth and D\'Ganzio, and unspecified groups elsewhere. 
This last category probably includes pro-Zhodani, pro-Sword Worlds, and
independent groups.  Some groups are probably allied to the Rhylanor
Committee, which I haven\'t designed yet.

The Regina group controls the "Ine Givar Highway" - the J1 route to Arden -
a notorious smuggling route, which is of course heavily policed by the
Imperial Navy.

Interesting places include Dinom, where the IG has a rather strained
relationship with the local government, and Extolay, where, according to
Behind the Claw, a colony of Vargr exiles was placed in 1116.  Eventually I
intend to make one of my favourite NPCs, a Vargr "Merchant Adventurer"
named Ouzo, (who I use as a playtest and solo adventure character), the
leader of the Vargr enclave.  What\'s his attitude towards the Ine Givar? 
Only time will tell....

2) More seriously, and this is on Ken\'s side, reading a post from Leonard is
rather like reading the Bible or Nietzsche (Sp? My checker spazed on that

reference to whatever "IMTU" is the "real world" for that reader.

I\'ve gotten "good things" - many in fact - from both. For ex, Ken\'s task

DGP/CT task system :> (Sorry Ken. KBv2 was really good, but T4 was too bad
for even that to save it.)

Leonard has also given goodies to my campaign too. I won\'t go into it any
further, but it\'s still truth.  End result? Even. Unlike the un-namable ash

So it goes.  Take care of yourselves - both of you.

	Hi, Nick.  I have always commented that in a TL12+ game that
"there is no problem too complex that cannot be solved by a suitable
application of technology and funding...".
	I say TL12 because that is the point, IIRC that nuclear dampers
become reasonably common kit at all levels of the battle field.  That kind
of fine control over the basic forces of the Universe means you can just

I\'m looking for an experience system to use in my new campaign.  CT
really doesn\'t have one.  I\'m so-so about MT\'s "AT" (action tally)
system.  And T4\'s is a bit broken, but workable.

So, here\'s what I worked out today while driving around--if anybody
cares to comment.  My tweak on this is a bit of a combination between
the MT and T4 systems, and you can use this experience system with CT,
MT, and T4 rules sets.

(I won\'t even flame Leonard this time, if I see his name next to a
response).



I\'m thinking this...



1)  Nightly Experience.

I like systems where characters are rewarded at the end of the night\'s
gaming session.  It gives players a good pat on the back each time we
play, fosters good talk of the game post-session, and it gives the
players a feeling that their characters are growing, becoming better,
learning from their experiences.

The prerequesite to this system is that actually going up a skill level
should mirror attaining skills in character generation--that is to say
that most PCs should get about 1 skill level per game year (more if it
is a action heavy campaign, less if skills aren\'t used that often).



2)  Experience Points.

I call them "pips".  The ref awards these at the end of the night.  He
looks at what a character did and awards a point or two to the skills
used by the PC during the session--the ones that were most important to
the game.  Standard award is 1 pip (or, you could call it an experience
point) for a skill that was important during the session.  If called for
in the ref\'s opinion, this award could be as high as 2 (maybe even 3 in
extreme cases).

Players record these "pips" next to their skill.  When they have enough,
they can attempt to raise the skill.



3)  Character Improvement.

When a PC has enough "pips", he can throw to see if the skill is
improved.  To earn a throw on a skill, the PC must have a number of
"pips" equal to 6 x the new skill level.

Ex:  So, if you have Pistol-0, and you want to see if you can move up to
Pistol-1, you need 6 pips.

Ex:  If you have Medical-3, and you want to throw to see if you can move
up to Medical-4, you need 24 pips.


If elligible (meaning:  the PC has earned enough pips), the player may
throw to see if the skill is improved.  The throw is similar to T4\'s
system.  A player must throw THE NEW SKILL LEVEL or greater on 1D.

Ex:  on the Pistol example above, the throw to move up is automatic.

Ex:  on the Medical example above, the throw is 4 or better on 1D.


I\'m still playing with the rule that handles skills of 6 or better.  I
don\'t like the T4 rule where the chance to improve to level 6 is the
same as the chance to improve to level 7 when all other throws for
improvement are harder the higher level you are trying to obtain.

Another thing, I\'d like a PC characteristic (like Int) to give a
positive DM to the throw (or possibly count as pips--so that a character
could try for a skill even if he doesn\'t have the required pips to
try).  Extra pips providing a better chance of success is an idea too.

As far as pips go, we could do something like this:  Int 0-4, no pip
bonus.  Int 5-9, 1 pip bonus.  Int 10-14, 2 pip bonus.  Int 15, 3 pip
bonus.


Once the throw is made, whether successful or not, all pips are lost.


Refs could easily use this system for when a PC wants to attain a new
skill.  The skill is kept on the PC\'s sheet in parentheses.  Player\'s
throw on it at the standard negatives for not having the skill (if a
throw is allowed at all.  Some skills cannot be learned through
experience only.  They must be taught.  Ref\'s decision on this.).  And
the PC earns pips in the standard way.  When he has enough, he can throw
to see if he gets the skill at level 0, or at level 1 (bug--needs to be
worked out).



It seems to me this might be a viable Traveller experience system, once
the bugs are worked out.  There will be a lot of throws where the
character is not improved, but that one time that the throw does work,
it will be joy in the player\'s heart.

Thoughts?

Bout the only references I see have them dialable between 0 and 2Gs.  But 
they\'re DGP, IIRC, and of dubvious canonocity.

\'Grav pong\', I think it\'s called.  Set 1 plate for 2G, the next plate on the 
floor at -2G, the third plate for 2G, so there\'s about 4 G shear at the 
edges.  <grin>  They waddle over the first plate, get slammed onto the 
ceiling, walk across it for a bit, then get slammed back onto the floor.  Fun 
stuff, always good for a few laughs & broken bones.

Two things.

1.  It would take a major handwave to get back from the Well World, basically
a readjusting of the equations that define the universe.  This is pointed out
in the series.  *BOTH* series.  <grin>  And I\'d *shudder* to think of what TL
it would take to *BUILD* the Well World.

2.  No *WAY* would I, as a GM, allow *any* Markovian holdout like Nathan Brazil
to be a player character.  NPC, mebbe.  But not a *player*.

And I\'ll add a 3rd thing:

3.  It would be *MUCH* more fun to dump the PCs into Flux on World and see how
well they adjust *there*.  <grin>

I probably would give bonus pips as unattached (not linked to use of a
specific skill in that session).  This would not only model study and
practice during the PC\'s "off-hours", but also serve as an additional
reward for good role-play (the extra flexibility of getting to choose
the skill toward which the pip counts).

This seems a bit harsh.  Let\'s take your example of a PC going for
Medical-4.  Let\'s say that your gaming group plays once a week.  That
means that the good doctor needs to have Medical skill be that PC\'s most
important skill use for _at least_ 12 sessions (assuming that the player
always receives a bonus pip due to good role-play).  Unless the PC is a
"one-trick pony", this will probably take about six months (or more) of
weekly gaming sessions.  After all that, the player has a 50% chance to
see all that work go ~poof~.

To balance this, I would consider letting the player postpone the roll,
collecting more pips.  Each six extra pips would give a +1 DM on the
skill roll.  That way, the player can wait another 18 pips (at least 9
more sessions, probably more) for a sure thing (+3 on the die roll gives
automatic success).  Of course, if the player gets impatient, and rolls
prior to getting an automatic success, then "let the dice fall where
they may."

I would rule that six pips on an untrained skill equals level 0
automatically (for skills where level 0 is appropriate).

Which is why I see the actual IA being equipped to TL 14-15 standards.  The
extra cost of procuring the equipment and training the "barbarians" to use
it is more than offset by the value of having universally equipped troops.

Funny, on Cottman IV that\'s actually a family name... there\'s a whole family
of Hasturs up in those hills...

You had me fine right up until here.  A character with average intelligence
will need to amass, say, 18 pips to move from skill-2 to skill-3.  At an
average of 1.5 pips per session, that\'s 12 sessions.  At, say, a session a
week, that\'s three months that this player has invested in these pips.  To
have him lose them all and have to start completely over based on a single
die roll is, in my opinion, unacceptable.

I\'d say just let them spend the pips to buy the new skill level and let
that be that.

Thanks for the input.  I\'ve been thinking that way too.  I like rewarding
players for good role play and great ideas during the game session.

For instance, in my last Traveller campaign, the players were stuck on this
space station, fighting some aliens they\'ve never seen before.

Power was out on the station, so they were fighting in zero G.

The PCs were on the top level of the station while the aliens were on the
bottom level.  Separating them was this elevator shaft with the car up next to
the PC level.

The problem was getting down the narrow elevator shaft to the alien\'s level.
The aliens were in vac suits while the PCs had none.  The air in the station
was getting stale, and the temperature was starting to drop, so the aliens
were waiting them out.

The aliens positioned themselves at the bottom of the shaft.  They had a
marvelous field of fire.  Anyone floating down the shaft would be cut to
smithereens.

One of my players came up with an idea.  They had a fusion torch available to
them.  He went to an area of the upper level and cut out pieces of the metal
deck.  In zero G, they were easy to move.  He stacked them together, then
tacked them with the torch so that they wouldn\'t separate.

Then, inside the elevator car, he cut out the floor.

Now, the aliens were below, with their mouths watering as they saw the torch
cut through the floor of the car.  The pieced shoved aside, the PCs above used
the thick pieces of flooring as a shield.  They floated behind it, pushing
along the wall.  The aliens opened up, but their weapons could not penetrate
the several thicknesses of flooring the PCs had welded together.

This allowed the PCs to get from the top level to the lower level and avoid
the blood bath that would have happened as they moved down the shaft.

Brilliant idea.  I loved it, and it worked like a charm on the bad guys.

Thing was...the guy who came up with the idea during the game did nothing but
come up with the idea.  He\'s a weak character stat-wise, and he remained up
top during the fighting.  He\'s not even the same character who actually used
the fusion torch.

No dice rolls for this guy that night.  It was all pure role playing.
Obvisouly, his input made him the star of the night.

I think this is a grand example of using pips as you suggest.  This guy should
be awarded pips for his great idea that really saved the entire party.

It does seem a bit harsh...but that\'s by design.  Remember, I\'m trying to
mirror PC Gen.  I doubt we\'d play a whole game year in six months of real
time, and I want the PCs to go up about 1 skill level (or so) per game
year--just like what would happen during character generation (I use 1 skill
per year on the 4-Year method careers, like in T4.  It fits better with
advanced char gen that way).

If I don\'t do something like this, a game year will go by, and PCs will have
improved 5, 6, 7 or more skills levels.  That\'s too much for Traveller.

What I want is for a character who goes through char gen until he is 26, then
played for 4 years, to have about the same amount of skills as a character who
is taken through char gen until he is 30.

Milage will vary, but I\'m trying to skew them to being close.

Char gen makes a lot more sense that way.  And besides, I\'m using the CT
rules.  A +1 DM when you only need 8+ on 2D to hit is a hell of an
improvement.  I mean, that +1 REALLY improves that character\'s chances.

Character\'s throw to improve when the players want to.  They are not forced to
roll at any one time.

Good point.  Not sure if I want to go this way, but you will see in my
original post that I would like extra pips to improve the chances of the
roll.  You\'ve got the same idea here.

Nice thought.

I don\'t like "buying" things.  Never have.  One of the things that attracts me
to Traveller char gen is the uncertainty of it all.

"I want to go to college".

"OK, nine or better."

"I rolled a 7."

"Sorry, no college for you.  What do you want to do next?"

I like how Traveller char gen mirrors real life.  Players can direct the PC\'s
choices, but things do not always work out as planned.

I\'ve said before that Star Wars has the best game mechanics I\'ve ever played
with.  Well, I\'ll say now that Traveller has the best character generation
system I\'ve ever seen.

Why *not* a Fuzzy chief engineer?  All he\'d really need is the training, and 
by the books, they\'re pretty bright.  They just don\'t have much in the way of 
technology.  Which supports the \'castaways\' theory; they\'re *MUCH* too smart 
to be native stone aged beings.  Also, the fact that they needed a trace 
metal that was only found in one source locally.  If something would have 
happened to those \'land crabs\', the Fuzzies would be an evolutionary also-ran.

Scouts, definitely.  Special ops, depends on the op.  But I doubt they\'d make 
good regular grunts.  They\'re too small and fragile for it.

Well, if there is no incentive to wait, then all one achieves by waiting

You can always flex the number of extra pips needed to gain a +1 DM.  I
might go with the following:

1 pip per session for the most important skill roll (applied to the
appropriate skill);
1-2 pips per session for good role-play (applied by the player to the
skill of the player\'s choice);
Bonus pips for attributes (only applied once per game year [only one
roll per game year can get _any_ attribute bonus]);
DMs from extra pips for a given skill (gained by delaying the skill
roll; 6-9 pips per +1 DM)

Note that, if you want to replicate the possibilities found in character
generation, you will need to allow for the increase of attributes, as
well as skills.  I\'d consider playtesting the following:

Every n pips (where the desired attribute = n) applied to an attribute
equals a +1 DM.  No more than once per game year, a PC can roll 2d
against the current attribute, with any accumulated DMs (the PC must
have at least +1 to allow a roll).  A roll equal to or greater than the
new attribute level increases the attribute by one.  All pips invested
in the given attribute will be lost upon rolling to increse the
attribute.  A PC can only increase one attribute per game year.  Note
that this will allow relatively rapid increases to low stats, but will
reduce the chance that players will rapidly improve already-high
attributes.

This system assumes that most pips applied to an attribute are either
discretionary pips (gained through good role-play) or are based on
straight attribute rolls (if such straight rolls are the most
significant rolls made by the PC during the game session).

Don\'t forget that, while some game sessions will cover only a day or
less, others will include one or more jumps, each of which can be a week
of game time in a few minutes of real time.  If one plays one session
per week, game time probably runs a bit faster than real time.  (Of
course, this depends on the type of adventures one runs.)

It depends on how much high tech you have, compared to how much moderate or 
low tech you have.  A single company of BD-equiped drop troops would be good 
to hold a beachhead on a midrange tech planet (say, 9 to 11ish) while the TL 
10-12 colonial troops land in shuttles.  IMTU, garrisoning low tech planets 
is done by either mercs recruited in the area, or colonial troops of a bit 
higher tech than the indigs, from a colonial world nearby.  There\'s usually 
only a TL or 2 between the garrison and the indigs, just enough to give the 
garrison an edge.  Also, IMTU, the higher your unit\'s TL is, the more of a 
logistical nightmare it becomes.  Being part of a TL12 garrison on a TL3 
world is *NOT* going to be a picnic if the enemy cuts off your supply lines.  
Eventually, your supplies *will* run out, and you\'ll have to rediscover 
\'stuff\' on your own...

That Merc Cruiser is new since I had last dropped by too. Jesse has the

Hey Jesse, how about an orbital colony? A big honking torus or maybe an
asteroid with some superstructure. Or how about a half finished ship with
scaffolding al around and little worker pods scooting around it. Just some
ideas to spur your imagination so we all can see more pics.

 Anything but a glancing blow will -RING- that helmet, too.

While the sling was well respected in ancient warfare, it takes living with 
one to get really good with it.  "If you want good slingers, start by 
training their grandfathers."

The only good slinger I\'ve seen in SF&F literature is Leiber\'s Grey Mouser, 
who could pull off amazing stunts of marksmanship while riding a horse at 
full gallop. Ignoring the "literature" requirement brings up an excellent 
visual guide to slingers in an advanced setting: Walt Simonsen\'s "Star 
Slammers," a classic Epic/Marvel Graphic Novel (and more recent tepid revival 
comic book). The Primitives-gone-Merc of the title were a sling using culture 
the whole time, and the sling (or "slammer" as they called it) basically 
replaced the pistol as a side arm for many of them. Their grenades were built 
with the sling in mind.  I\'ve been intending to drop the Star Slammers into 
my Traveller universe for years, just never got the opportunity...

I love the "low-tech disciplines with high tech tools" slant too. As you
said, a sling is very backwards compatable. Better than even a bow, and much
less bulky, as well as incredibly easy to conceal. Can also double as
binding, a garrot, etc. Can also be used to deploy targeting transponders,
surveilance gear, message capsules, and so on. But yes, it is damn hard to
learn. I worked with one for a while, and after over a year of hucking rocks
at ground squirrels, I finally hit one. Lucky shot. Getting the projectile
to go towards the target, as opposed to straight up, down, or behind you,
only takes a few weeks to accomplish *most* of the time. It\'s range that\'s
really difficult.

Does anybody have any experience with those spear chucking thingies? Atlatl
or something? I was thinking of making one. I have no idea how to use a
sling staff, although I had a Kender chr. who was sling stone silly.

Which is a good argument for letting pips increase the chance of success on a

The reference I read on slings, oh so long ago, was that a historical sling
(the one David was said to use, for example) was about 3-ft in length
requiring the user to be standing (you cant lie or kneel) have approximately
5-ft on each side (arm movement, body shift, etc.).  Which was fine in the
times when one agreed with one\'s enemy as to the battle field location and
lining men in ranks against each other... but against firearms, the slinger
cannot typically hide in inside a building or brush/bush and snipe.

He would have to stand upright in a battle, and at best, fire from over a
low (lower than I\'d be comfortable with?) wall.  I may be wrong, the text
was old, but that\'s how I understand it.  But I\'m led to believe that a good
slinger could punch a hole in a man\'s temple and kill him!!  In modern
times, that\'s why rifle delivery systems (grenade cups, etc.) were
developed... to get the grenade a tad further from the thrower (officially,
to cover the area between throw range and mortar range)

Interesting idea though, if you have to get the grenade that bit further,
wasn\'t there something in a movie once about using a woman\'s bra to deliver
a grenade?  That was probably more as a slingshot/shanghi thing as opposed
to a sling?

Most of the planets are in the Lanth and Rhylanor subsectors. Information will be

What is needed is basic system overview, number of planetoids, star type etc.

    I am thinking a lot of the census information can be gathered from planetary
databases by making contact with the locals, one of the crew should have some

    I thought I would put this to the list and ask for suggestions and comments.

Is this what happened or what you expect to happen? Personally, as a PC,
I\'d hit the thrusters and start firing whilst they were in the umbilical.

(Start off by "drifting" the two ships together for a boarding party squash)

At this range, you can use the normal starship combat rules for damage, just
assume the turn length is (say) 6 sec, not 16 min. Assume that "misses"
either knock a hole in the cargo bay or are weapons out of arc.

(If you assume that the normal rules have 16 mins of firing of which a few
shots hit, then at this scale, every 5 to 10 seconds a weapon hits somewhere.)

Can WJP\'s special effects department say BANG! very loudly? I thought they
could:-)

As has been mentioned, each weapon hit is a 100MJ explosion (even without
anything bigger than turrets)

If you use triple turrets, you have the option of *BANG!* or BANG!BANG!BANG!
or BANG!...BANG!...BANG! depending on if you fire tham at the same time and
same
target, same time and parallel shots (ie put three shots into the enemy\'s
likely
position at 100,000km) or as successive shots (effectively trippling the ROF)
Note that the default setting for space combat is probably the second one.
Since you can track to targets quite quickly and only need one shot to kill,
option three is probably the best - if the gunner thinks to reset the
defaults.
This should give the PCs an edge.

One thing your gunners are going to want is aiming rules for target locations
(eg the other ship\'s turrets, sensors, drives, <joke> the captain looking
through
the bridge windows </joke>)

Also, you\'are going to need some sort of 3-D model of the ships (even if
only your
own mental image) since at this range there are going to be a lot more
problems
with weapon arcs.

=====================

Thoughts - If Trav weapons have focussing arrays about 1 m across in order
to hit stuff at tens of thousands of km, can they focus the beam to a
1cm point at sub 1 km ranges?

As someone pointed about, the missiles are almost certain to fail to arm
in the distance involved, although there would be some kinetic damage,
this won\'t be much at these ranges and Trav missiles don\'t tend to have
explosive fuel. However, there is still a chance that after the battle
(roll 2D, did you get a number greater than 1?) that the PCs will find
an unexploded missile on the ship. Note also that, even without
anti-handling devices, there has been thought on this list before
that missiles would have life expiry charges on them so that they don\'t
become wandering space junk.
(Especially fun if someone is using nukes, I don\'t think any published
Trav design could survive even a small nuke going off internally;-)

What about sandcasters? Either they will release at too great a range
or they are going to seriously block laser fire.

Personally, I always like to fit a Type A with one multi-purpose
laser/sand/missile turret and one dual fusion. I don\'t think anyone
would want to be hit by (fire from) a dual fusion turret at this range!

Or perhaps, let them keep the points and re-roll when they next acquire

	I have the same feeling.

	When the "plasma focus" effect was first discovered, I
	considered it as a possible explanation how Traveller HEPlaR
	drives and plasma/ fusion guns might work in the real life. The
	more recent experiments have also suggested that plasma focus
	effect could also be used for generating power (reaction is used
	to generate a stream of charged high-velocity particles which
	are directed into a "particle decelerator").

	The technology required for initializing the reaction is also
	relatively simple. While the experiment in "super lasers" was
	done with a T3 laser ("Table Top Terawatt"), the same effect can
	apparently be generated by focused electron beams.

	Hmm. If Traveller HEPlaR drive is considered to be a kind of 
	plasma focus device, it might be possible to use FF&S to 
	calculate how much damage the exhaust plume inflicts, assuming
	that it is a fusion gun with very high rate of fire...

You could reroll and add - probably something like the old GW
rule (ie 4,5,6 on second die is 7. 5,6 is 8. 6 is 9) which avoids
6 and 7 having the same probability.

For CT (which, IMO, looks on skill-4 as very good and skill-6 as
being towards the limit), I wouldn\'t bother with the "roll-though"
rule.

I\'d just let the players have a target number of 7 on 1D and use
the stat point bonus + using extra pips ideas discussed elsewhere
to give them a chance.

Over here, there are two acknowledged uses for grenades:

(a) when the enemy is in cover, and you\'re not. Get the grenade into the
enemy emplacement, and his emplacement will keep the fragments away from
you.

(b) when you\'ve in (semi) cover, and the enemy isn\'t. Works exactly the
reverse of (a).

	Opps. You are right. This was an old IMTU GM ruling. It comes from the

My guess is that the mass media provides a "lingua franca" of sorts, one
that is understood by all parties, but one not necessarily *used* by all.
Take England as a modern-day example. "BBC English" is used by the media,
and is understood everywhere in England, but England still maintains its
own regional pronounciations.

who can identify whereabouts a person comes from just by their accent.
Eg., I played him an audio clip of Dave Lister from Red Dwarf (a program
with which he is totally unfamiliar) and he (correctly) identified the
accent as being from Liverpool.

ObTrav: I can envision a variance in Anglic pronounciation on a more or
less sector basis (subsector would be maybe a little too fine?). "That
man is speaking with a distinct Dagudashaag lilt in his voice..."

It sounds a lot like Star Frontiers, minus the throw to improve.
In SF you just bought the skill and got better, but the idea of getting
experience at the end of each session & point costs increasing with
skill level was basically the same.

I always thought it took too long to improve in SF, especially as characters
get better skills. It was compounded by the fact that there were really only
a handful of skill in SF in the first place, meaning that everyone got to
level 2 or 3 quickly (out of 6) but then things really started to drag.

Have a look at the Call of Cuthulu system (at least the edition I played, 3rd
I think) - skills are percentile based and if you used the skill successfully
in a session, at the end you got to roll you skill or higher to improve the
skill by some small amount.

Unfortunately Traveller falls between SF & CoC in terms of # of skills and
granularity of skill levels, so it\'s hard to make any direct comparisons.
Anyway, both provide interesting alternatives.

Success:  If the ship and its cargo is intact with only minor additional 
damage, but the unit or base personnel have suffered fatalities, then the

It\'s what happened.  That is the end of my last Traveller campaign.  We ended with
a cliffhanger.  The PCs rushed across the umbilical after they blew the bad guys
out the airlock.  They rushed across and started cutting into the bad guy ship
with their fusion torch.  The few bad guys left on the ship hit the thrusters with
the PCs dangling outside the airlock.

See...this is what I like about this list.  My first inclination was to just scale
down combat--range and round.  I hadn\'t even thought of the effect this will have
on the to hit number.

And, that\'s what we\'re really talking about.  To break things down to their most
basic elements, we\'re talking range, round time, and to hit.  The closer you get,
the easier it is to hit.

I\'ll look at the ranges involved and decide on an appropriate modifier.  I\'m sure
we\'ll be looking at automatic hits at this range after what I\'ve heard here on the
list.

Thanks to all.

Haven\'t played the CofC system, but this is the original idea I had on this
experience system.

I thought that every night I\'d award points (pips), and these points would
basically be percentage points.

Ex:  If you had one point in a skill, you had a 1% chance of going up.

Ex:  If you\'ve got  42 points in a skill, you\'ve got a 42% chance of going up.

Players could roll to see if they go up at the start of each session.  They will
have a low chance at first, but the more they use the skill, the more likely they
can go up (and, you don\'t loose the points once your try--each game session, you
can try everything that has a chance to go up).

Of course, there are two problems with this:  (1)  It\'s not becoming of Traveller
rules to be thrown on anything other than six sided dice.  Percentage dice just
aren\'t Traveller.  (2)  Doing percentage points that way makes for a long, long
time before anyone goes up.

Well, in the case of boarding actions you\'ve probably taken down the ship\'s power plant, which will have disabled artificial gravity in the entire ship.  It\'s really more of an anti-hijacking/anti-mutiny measure.

	This is a good start, but I tend to think that an ACR-equiped
	squad should have a higher FP than one with assault rifles.
	The ACR-equiped troops have a better chance to hit and tend to
	do more damage, not to mention the possible effects of HE near-
	misses.

	I was thinking of just awarding "terrain DM\'s" for armour. 
	For example, +1 for jack/cloth, +2 for CES, +3 for combat
	armour, and +4 for battle dress.  I\'m not sure what to do
	with SL penetration, but I expect that gauss rifle-equiped
	squads would enjoy at least some penetration with their 
	firepower.

	As I use CT, maximum ranges do not vary as much as effective
	ranges.  SL commandos (which are presumably armed with smg\'s)
	have ranges of 2-3 hexes, while CT smg\'s may be fired at long
	range (250-500 m?).

	This is good, though many NPC Leaders may just happen to have

	How about light-, field-, medium-, and heavy- guns being 
	37, 50, 75, and 150 mm respectively?  Howitzers get a *
	rating, guns a L rating, and mass drivers a "LLL" rating.
	Lasers, tac missiles, plasma guns, etc.?

	:-) I had already pegged the Vargr as SL americans.  K\'Kree
	morale might be contingent on the number of adjascent squads.
	Would you see Aslan as something like the SL Fins?

	I hadn\'t thought about this.  Chameleon suits might allow 
	concealed status in any hex.  Laser weapons might start fires,
	too.  Night vision equipment would negate certain penalties.
	How about in-helmet commo allowing multihex fire groups that
	are not in adjascent hexes?  Grav belts would give squads the
	mobility of grav-vehicles (including flying above the 
	battlefield), and perhaps reduce the penalty for moving in 
	the open to -1 (the troops can "lay down" and fly just above 
	the ground).  What would be the terrain DM for troops flying
	above the battle field?

>Many Grav-vehicles will have functionally unlimited movement points in

	That is a good point, but terrain effect on movement would be
	different.  Moving through a forest hex would be slow (but no
	chance of breaking down), moving above the trees would be as
	fast as moving above a road, turning might entail limits 
	(e.g. use at least 5 MP before changing direction by one
	hex-side).

	Yes, please.

Ahhh, so the PCs figured that they could capture the ship belonging to
the guys trying to board them, did they? The scenario does start to sound
resonable now.

[Reasonable in this case meaning "I have adventured with groups who
 would consider doing this". Reasonable ideas and sensible ideas are
 not often^H^H^H^H^Halways the same thing.]

Keven, I\'m a local, and whatever she said to you, I wouldn\'t take it too
personally.  She\'s been suffering from a progressive immune system disorder
of some sort for more than ten years, and it\'s seriously messed with her
mind.  She\'s said odd things to me, too.

Don\'t let it spoil the books for you-- she couldn\'t have managed to continue
writing without her many coauthors.

	What most governments want is a cost-effective force.  In 
	Regina subsector, for example, the cost of building and 
	maintaining a TL15 force is higher that that for a TL 10
	force because the equipment is more expensive (and perhaps
	requires more logistical support), and this difference in
	costs is magnified by the great distance to any TL 15 world.
	The Imperial Navy maintains Imperial Way Stations at great
	expense to keep it\'s forces "in supply," but a TL8 world
	would have to have a really good reason to pay for a 
	significant TL15 army unit.  IMTU, TL15 mercs/pirates are 
	rare outside of areas that have a TL15 world.  Even a few 
	unsupported TL15 miscreants (PC\'s) can probably be handled 
	by a division equiped to TL10.

	Both are good points, I don\'t see the Imperium doing this
	unless really pressed.

	I would agree with this if the IA was being used regularly.
	IMTU, it is used only infrequently, and the (IMTU) massive
	expense and dependance on distant sources of equipment makes
	most worlds unwilling to go the extra distance.

Yes.  I didn\'t elaborate before because it was moot.  I was interested in
examining starship combat at close range.  How the ships got to close range
really didn\'t matter.

Last week, the Kansas Board of Education\'s vote to omit
macro-evolution from the list of science topics created quite a stir
among academics. Noting the outcry, a Chinese paleontologist, who
reports that recent fossil finds in his country defy the Darwinian
evolutionary theory that major animal groups evolved gradually from a

Presumably the grav field reaches up to top of the deck and outwards in a
sphere. So gravity near the walls might be a little interesting if your
stateroom was set to zero G and the next one to 1G

More like randomly varying between 0 and 6G :-O

That is a very foolish thing to say. I am still behind in the posts as I
have not been on the computer in a while, but I have to say something to
this. As I mentioned in an earlier post, I have been reading about E-Prime,
a language based on English, but without the word "is". This is because the
word places us back in an Aristotlean mind set with things having immutable
"essences", as in certain units of furniture having an essence of
"chairness". This is why most Skin Monkeys are baffled by Quantum Physics,
including myself. We are using poor software in our heads.

How do you know Leonard was being condescending? Are you an empath? A
telepath? I missed the paragraph were Leonard says "I am in contempt of your
ignorance". I wonder where you found it. I am not so much defendind Leonard
as making a pre-emptive defence for myself and others. How can one place
verbal inflections on the written word? If one does not, much of the meaning
can be lost. Asterisks before and after a word are not to indicate
condescension. They indicate itallics, at least as far as I know. OK, I\'ll
admit that some of Leonards posts sound like he is overly confident in his
own knowledge, but so are we all. Even A. Einstein had a streak of arrogance
that caused him to dismiss theories based on his own predjudices. S. Hawking
is the first really open-minded scientist I have read, but even there, some
Aristotlean thought patterns come through.

Your statement written in E-Prime:
Leonard\'s posts seem to my perceptions as extremely condescending.

Now that is a reasonable statement, and could even allow the two of you to
learn a little about each others mindsets. Maybe even help Leonard to not
sound as condescending to you.

If my post ever generate this type of misunderstanding, I would appreciate
it if members of the list could *ask* what I mean before jumping to
conclusions.

I thought I would continue my trend of asking questions that have probably
been hashed to death before by asking about Black Globes.

The books talk about black globes absorbing energy from energy weapons, but
what do they do to matter & kinetic energy.  If you fired an unarmed/dud
missile or a mass driver at a ship protected by a black globe set full, no
flicker would it.

Strike the black globe as a solid and smash?

Strike and bounce off elastically?

Stop dead in space with it\'s kinetic energy absorbed? (And if so how much
energy would this put into the capacitors, or would it be inconsequential
for a non near C projectile.?)

Be absorbed?(I doubt this in that matter to energy conversion would probably
create way to much energy for capacitance.  Also the reference to the first
person turning on a black globe being cut in half and from then on learning
to do it with a stick.  They never mention the black globe absorbing/
interacting with the planet/research station/ whatever.  Off course, black
globes when activated small behave a little different, like being stable.)

Something else?

Amateur! The _proper_ way to do grav pong is to CYCLE the plates from
+2/-2 G continuously so they actually never know which way they\'re going
to fall. Or when.

In TNE the plates cycled fast enough that you could probably play
Breakout with the poor boarders.

And that\'s nothing to turning the grav _sideways_ ;-> suddenly that
hallway is a 15M shaft and you\'re at the top. EEEEEEEEyyyyyyooooowwwww
splat! Then you switch it the other way. EEEEEEEEyyyyyyooooowwwww splat!
You can continue, but it\'s just a different sounding SPLAT! after that,

Does it need to be exact? I suck at math, especially when we get into
averaging probabilities over long streatches. No, my idea won\'t work for
that without tweaking it. I don\'t know how much. I think the easiest would
be to increase the target number required to suceed in the training. You
will of course have limits on the quantum of success, and individual results
will vary, with an average result hopefully high enough on the bell curve to
make it "standard". I see you are asking for something a little trickier
that I first thought, I rarely concern myself with achieving identicle
results from alternative generation systems, it would give me migrains I\'m
sure.

Speaking, as I am wont to do, as one whose first  and most pervasive ideas
of Traveller came from TNE, I work mostly from the writings in FFS. There\'s
a pretty clear reference in FFS to the effect that a globe contacting a mass
tries to drain all the kinetic energy of the mass, effectively trying to
cool it to absolute zero. (Second Law of thermodynamics be damned...)  I
take this to read that BGs don\'t annihilate matter.

Personally, I wouldn\'t. I can\'t speak for anyone else, but game years pass
pretty slowly in the games I\'ve played in (except Ars Magica). I tend to
want my PCs to improve faster than that.

First thing we would need is a baseline in your campaign.  On average,
how many gaming sessions does it take for one game year to pass?

I never liked the idea of an engineer sitting at his control console,

grav plate switch. With this use of technology available, some staples
of heroic space opera fiction don\'t happen, like any real kind of
shipboard battles.

IMTU, I just made it take a while for grav plates to build up "charges".
Not a long time, a matter of minutes for the usual 1G to tens of
minutes for the heaviest plates (which weren\'t that heavy). 

I also had the field a little limited - say, two or three meters above the
field, and an area a little bit around the field. Thus two grav plates right
beside each other, one set to zero G and one set to 6G, would have
a couple of feet of transition between them, and a 6G plate at the
end of a 50 meter corridor wouldn\'t turn it into a deadly pit trap.

The idea of a grav plate at the far end of a corridor being effective at
turning the corridor into a deadly pit always struck me as a little wrong
anyway. How is a grav plate the size of the corridor going to project
effects tens of meters away, when the usual floor-section sized
grav plate only effects its section of one deck?

Excuse me? Members of stone age socities are *not* stupid. They merely
lack the *knowledge* of how to make better tools. It takes a *lot* of
time for such small populations to stumble across a new "trick". Once
they do, they usually exploit it to the hilt. 

But going by Piper\'s books, Fuzzies *aren\'t* as intelligent as humans.
If they *were* as bright as humans, then the court rulling that gave
them "minor children" type status was a travesty.

Still, there\'s room for doubt.

We need vitamin C. Unlike many creatures, we can\'t produce our own.
It\'s thought that the trait was lost while our ancestors were tree
dwellers, with a diet that was high in vitamin C. Thus, the accidental
loss of the gene wasn\'t a problem. 

Fuzzies were just unlucky that whatever *common* species or group of
species they formerly preyed on and that also concentrated Titanium
died out. Heck, it could be that they developed in an area where some
*plant* was the source. But it doesn\'t grow outside a limited range.

Small has advantages. For one thing, given how small they are, they
should have a *much* lower terminal velocity.. Thus they can survive
falls from much greater heights than humans. So if you need something
climbed, send the fuzzy. :-)

It just occurred to me that at normal ranges, ships are essentially a
"point" target. 

When you get close enough that a ship subtends multiple *degrees*, the
aiming software may not know *where* to fire. I\'m told that some
missile systems have had this problem. 

So the "automatic" aiming software *might* just have a nervous
breakdown, or at least sit there dithering about what *part* of the
target to aim at. 

So players might have to take manual control and do the equivalent of
"firing over open sights". That should makes hits not *quite*
automatic. 

But this is *definitely* a matter for each ref to handle on his own.

I have vague memories of a D&D campaign where someone either found a
scrap of parchment with "that name" on it, or where it was a bit of
graphitti on the wall (in an obscure alphabet). 

Either way, the idea was to see if the players would be dumb enough to
read it aloud. :-)

Also, there\'s a moderate amount of evidence that *some* aspects of
human language are "hardwired". If so, they obviously *can* be
overriden, but it\'d still tend to make the languages tend back towards
something "more human" in such a time span.

Atlatl is a name in one of the "Mexican" languages (Nahuatl?).
Australian aborigines call them woomeras. Mostly, from the few antro
types I\'ver talked to, they seem to use "spear thrower" as the generic
term. 

From the description in a few texts, they sound like they aren\'t *too*
hard to use. Still need a lot of practice though. 

> I was thinking of making one.

As I recall, there\'s a pretty good description in one of Jean Auel\'s
books. Not "Clan of the Cave Bear", but one of the sequels.

The only problem with this is that it\'s as easy to go from Pistol-33 
to Pistol-34 as it is to go from Pistol-1 to Pistol-2. Traveller\'s
lack of a skill level ceiling makes it difficult to judge which
of these two things should be harder.

One way is to say that skills should be harder to improve as the levels
get higher, as you need more and more knowledge/experience as you go up.
Electronics-6 could be an order of magnitude more knowledge/experience
than Electronics-5.

The opposite view is that since going from skill-1 to skill-2 is a 
100% increase in skill level, it should cost more than the skill-33 
to -34 progression, where it\'s a question of whether you\'re 
able to shoot just a grape or a grape _and_ a raisin off the head 
of the Emperor from 12 parsecs (i.e. negligible difference).

At what point do the pips get cleared out? When the skill goes up?

Well, multiply pips by 5 then. Though I agree about the six sided die issue.

My suggestion:

Every time a character successfully uses a skill, that skill gets a "check".
At the end of the session (easier to remember then a week later at the 
beginning of the next session), roll the skill level or higher on 1D for 
each checked skill. If successful, the skill goes up. 

The problems with this are that a) skills will top out at level 5, which is 
not necessarily a bad thing and b) skills will go up way too fast at first.

So, how about this: if the roll succeeds, add 1D divided by 10 to the 
skill level, rounding all skill levels down. This means that on average,
each skill will need 3 successful rolls to go up a full level, which will 
probably take more than 3 successful uses. At absolute best (worst?), it 
will take a minimum of two sessions with all rolls coming up 6 to get the 
skill up a full level. IMO, you have to make sure that the skills actually
do go up once in a while, otherwise the experience system is just a big
frustration for players.

This is sort of the CoC system "scaled". Of course, it doesn\'t allow for
people to get new levels in skills they don\'t already have. Which again,
is not necessarily a bad thing. I would have a hard time justifying how
someone could go from no Engineering skill to Engineering-1 after 
whacking a jump drive with a spanner a few times and making a few lucky rolls.
(Although, come to think of it, that was kind of how _I_ got through
engineering school... hmmm...)

In CT there was a distinction where some skills could have zero levels 
while others couldn\'t... for example, you could allow people to have
Vacc suit-0 but not Astrogation-0. If you successfully use a zero level skill,
I\'d allow the player to roll to see if it goes up, but since there really 
isn\'t any way to successfully use a skill without a zero level, it would never 
increase either.

Hope this helps,
Ethan

Since I can\'t underline, use italics, or wave my hands in email (at least
not using Eudora); the asterisk has become the standard method of showing

Maybe Leonard over-uses them, but that\'s hardly cause for the abuse shown
him by Mr. Bearden.

The US Army has experimented with crossbows for Ranger teams doing recon,
as a method to eliminate enemy soldiers who wander to close to the wrong
set of bushes.

Don\'t know if anything ever came of it.  But I do recall finding the NSN
(National Supply Number) for compound bows and arrows while working in a
supply room.

The only time I got to meet Heinlein he was pretty scary, kept forgetting

But it\'s important so that your technology remains constant.  Otherwise,
you get a "Star Trek:TNG" environment where every other menace is solved by
manipulating particles or forces that never get mentioned again, despite
the world-shattering nature of the solution.

My favorite example of this is "Rascals", where Picard, Ro and Chief
Bartender Whoopie are reduced to adolescence by the ubiquitous transporter
malfunction.  Later in the show, they figure out how it happened, and
restore the characters to their proper ages.

Examine this for a second:  The Enterprise just discovered practical
immortality!  Age regeneration without *any* loss of memory or brain
function!  I could endless go from 28 (when my cancer presented itself)
back to 14 or so, and live forever with a working immune system!  But we
never hear about this marvelous discovery again.

Having your technology set as hard as possible keeps the abuses down to a
minimum.  If you have a transporter that can do the tricks shown in
_Rascals_, your society is going to be very different (add in the "pattern
buffer" trick from _Relics_ and you have a race of immortal
twenty-somethings who aren\'t afraid of death, because they have spares in
the Life Center pattern buffer.)

Yes, but we define just what it takes to defy the laws of gravity.  Not so
much in theory, but in terms of how many kg of CG gear will it take to
propel mass x at velocity y.  That\'s the hard "gearhead" science, a
coherent set of design rules that follow that internal consistency.

Make no mistake, I love scooting across solar systems at ridiculous
velocities, arming my ships with grav-focused lasers, and carrying
unlicensed nuclear reactors on my back.  I just enjoy having it all make a
little sense.

Due to my ISP\'s upgrade, I missed the original message)

At the Cinco de Mayo festival in San Jose about two years ago they had a
demonstration of Meso-American weapons at Spartan Stadium.  Without the
atl-atl, I could toss a spear about 6 meters.  After ten minutes of
instruction, I was doing 40+ meters, with reasonable accuracy.  The
instructors were hitting 20cm targets at 75 meters.  Impressive little
piece of technology.

That could actually work, if your campaign involves very regular fatalities
- - witness Car War\'s Gold Cross.  In the one GURPS Reign of Steel campaign I
ran, I allowed cheap cloning/braintaping technology due to the fact that
the campaign has such a high fatality rate if you play it as written.

Or say that they are responsible for g-comp as well as for atrificial
gravity. If the ship is of a "typical" layout, and under even *one* g
of acceleration, it\'s going to be a long fall down the shaft that used
to be the main corridor. :-)

Well, for starters, *any* data in the planetary database would lkikely
be treated as "suspect" in many cases. 

That\'s *why* the US Census not only sends forms all over the place, but
has actual census *takers* gathering much of the population info.
Experience has shown that doing it some other way tends to result
either in guesses, or in officials filling in the numbers that will get
them more federal money, or let them get away with not passing on large
chunks of locally collected Imperial taxes.

I also wouldn\'t trust *any* government\'s statement as to what "type" it
is, nor what the local "law level" is. 

> What type of ship? I was thinking standard scout Type S. What about special

A standard scout should be ok. For doing the "update" to the "system
survey" (ie star type, physical info about the planets and satellites)
I\'d consider some upgraded imaging equipment (whatever they use instead
of a telescope and camera), and maybe some specially calbrated sensors.

Documentation would probably be a *very* limited "Imperial Warrant"
stating what they are supposed to be doing and requiring a certain
level of co-operation.

I\'d go for wording that more or less said "We understand if you are too
busy to give them huge amounts of help. No need to bend over backwards.
But if we find out you were foot-dragging just to show how important
you are..." Obviously, it\'d have to be "prettied up" a *lot*.

I like that sort of thing. I have ever since I read Norton\'s "The Sioux
Spaceman" which has a "small craft" belonging to the alien owners of a
planet the Terrans have a trade post on flying over to the post, and
then *slowly* "backing down on its tail".

Fried the post and left a nice expanse of trinitite (fused glass). It
didn\'t dig all that *deep*, as we later find out. 

My take is to consider that *mass flow* of that HEPlaR engine. That
energy is concentrated in not very much mass. So the exhaust will act
more like a "particle beam" or the like. It\'ll tend to dig long fairly
straight holes in what it hits, but not spread out too much. So ships
would leave *very* distinctive "landing scars". *Narrow* (a few cm?)
*deep* glass-lined holes in solid rock. 

You *don\'t* land these on wet soil, as the heatbuildup deep in the
ground could cause a steam explosion. 

But if you have the thrust to spare, you could possibly "defocus" the
exhaust, and trade thrust (and penetration) for area. This lets you do
the sort of "burnoff" described by Norton.

	A fair question, and one which has in recent weeks been much

If it takes two years of game time for a character to make a significant
advancement, and it takes you six months of real life gaming sessions
for two years of game time to pass, it will take six months for the
player to see a character advancement. If the average campaign
(or character) only lasts three or four months of real time - say,
a college semester or summer break - then the player will probably
*never* see a character advancement.

If it takes one month of real life gaming sessions for two years of game
time to pass - let\'s say you play episodes of the character\'s life,
and allow months of time to pass "off camera" - then the player may 
see a character advancement every real life month or so.

Yes, at the speed of a HEPlaR reactor, the effect is equivalent to a (poorly
focused) particle beam.  This doesn\'t mean that you dig small deep holes.  At
those energy densities, it pretty much doesn\'t matter, scattering off of matter
means that _anything_ acts like an explosion.

With a little development research how about designing circuitry so that the

flying near a thunderhead.  He/she/it either recharges the belt\'s batteries
or gets fried.    Its a dice roll and they don\'t find out how the recharge

That will teach them to read the Field Manual from cover to cover.

I really like this idea, and I don\'t even use full-on gravitics. Perhaps I
will now, at least as Ancient tech, with these mods. Your other ideas are
great too.

Does anyone else seriously curtail in some way the use of gravitics?

It may be urban-legend, but I have been told that one of the nastier
cross-DMZ harrassment weapons emplyed in Korea was a great honking
crossbow presumably constructed of something on the order of a truck
leaf spring. Story had it that some unfortunate sentry was found nailed
to a tree by a four foot length of sharpened 3/4 inch rebar.

This sort of job is exactly what the Type S is built for. Two \'ships crew\'
and two \'technical specialists\' do the job nicely, and lets face it ... who
really cares if you lose one every now and then.

Any \'extended UWP\' will give you most of the answers you want for
mainworlds. I think there are UWP lists for the Spinward Marches in various
places - punch Spinward Marches into a search engine and take it from
there. If all else fails, mail me seperatly with the worlds you want most,
and I\'ll punch them in from The Regency Sourcebook. Or buy Behind the Claw
- - I think it\'s pretty good, and you can write off any conflicts with
existing material as \'Why the heck do you think we\'re sending these blokes
off for two years, anyway ?\'.

Maps of mainworlds OTOH ... thats tough.

Personally, I think the IISS could get the information about mainworlds
pretty easily - just hang around Free Trader bars and ask, record
everything and then cross-check it to find out the tall stories. Or just
put ads in the paper asking for \'Ex-residents of X needed for interviewing
by IISS. Cr 50 per hour paid\'.

The Outworlds, on the other hand, are a different matter. Small worlds off
trade routes tend to be fairly insecure to start with, but in the Outsystem
of these worlds the Imperial Writ runs very very shallow. I can easily see
the IISS having patchy and out of date data about the Outsystems of most
secondary worlds.

After all, those places are *dangerous*. The average lifespan of a career
pirate near a mainworld is about, well, nil, but when the nearest missile
battery is 4 AU away, well ... even if the mainworld\'s sensors pick you up,
what are they going to do about it at 3 AU distance  ? Of course, this also
means that the traders that go to the Outsystems go there loaded for bear.
Which makes life less simple for the ethically challenged.

Think of it as the equivalent to sending three blokes from the Survey
Office in a pickup into Ozarks country. In the Twenties.

What aspects? For that matter, what evidence? This sounds interesting, are

Nor would I trust their adversaries. What do the various governments in Trav
think of each other as opposed to their view of themselves? Remember the
Racial Relations table in the DMG? Could something like that be built?
Perhaps with better coding, as theirs was very general.

150 Spacedock - I ran the figures and this has to be total space, not carried
craft space so your space dock is 150 DT too small. You require 2DT of space 
dock for each DT of craft carried.

You only need a space dock for one of the cutters. The spare modules and spare
cutter can go in vehicle bays to save a lot of space.

The jump drive/jump fuel figures are correct.

>Empty Mass:13,728.680tns Loaded Mass:15,003.680tns      

These figures are too low. I got a Loaded Mass over 16200 stons and that was
excluding carried craft. Your armor alone is 12320 stons. The M-drive, j-drive &
fuel tank add another 2900 stons. So this makes the unloaded figure well over
15000 stons. 
This makes your acceleration figures too high too.

>Spare Cargo Space:205,000

I don\'t understand this number, what is it?

You have cradles available to carry 250 tons mass. 
You have cargo space for 100 Displacement Tons volume.

>Armour:10,000 

This is an awful lot of armour for a support craft. This much armour is more in
line with a front line combat craft. 

>2 Nuclear Dampers

Why no meson screens too?

>4 Corridor space

Is this a component allowed in space dock? 
Corridoor space is already included in the stateroom & other living quarter
figures.

I don\'t see a price tag. I got MCr 718.

Special Forces teams usually have somebody who can use a crossbow if they\'re
doing deep penetration missions.

That was my *point*, Len.  *Both* counts.  A being as bright as a Fuzzy 
should have been able to conquer top position in the local food chain and 
expanded to fill the top exploiter niche *IF* it had evolved locally.  
According to the books, the total Fuzzy population was *small*, on the order 
of a few thousand, and all on 1 continent of Zarathustra.  They\'re too highly 
evolved *not* to have spread across the planet, and too dependent on traces 
of titanium (IIRC) for reproduction and health.  A being that naturally 
evolved on Zarathustra wouldn\'t necessarily be tied needing rare trace 
elements.  They\'d tend to evolve to not need them as much.

Vitamin C is relatively easy to find in our ecology.

Which would only account for their relative few numbers and concentration in 
1 area of the planet.  To totally exploit the niche, they\'d have to evolve 
beyond the need for titanium.

I\'ve played with them a bit.  They\'re pretty easy to make, and they work 
pretty good.  I\'m a *LOT* more accurate with an atlatl than I am with a 
\'regular\' bow and arrow, and about the same accuracy with a crossbow.

They need a *bit* of practice, but believe it or not, they\'re easier to hit 
things with than just the spear itself.  If you\'re anywhere *near* 
co-ordinated, shouldn\'t take more than a couple weeks.

It\'s not even in our galaxy, from what I remember.  Only way to get to it is 
by entering a Marcovian gate, and they\'re a bit tricky to open unless the

Great stuff.  Check out the \'Flux and Anchor\' series, as well as some of his 
other stuff:  \'Dancers in the Afterglow\' (note:  Do *NOT* read this if you\'re 
in an extremely depressed mood and have been partaking of recreational 
chemicals; you might end up slitting your wrists), the \'Four Lords of the 
Diamond\' series, the \'G.O.D. Inc\' series, and for serious sword and sorcery 
freeks, the \'Dancing Gods\' series.  <grin>

One thing to bear in mind is the impact of jump on skill progression. If
you don\'t have something happen, a two jump sequence on commercial shipping
takes characters out of play for about a month game time. When I last ran a
merchant campaign it was surprising how fast time added up...

This was part of Anne McCaffrey\'s Planet Pirates books.  Elizabeth Moon 
co-wrote 2 of the 5: Sassinak and Generation Warriors.  I am not positive, 
but I believe this was done the way many co-authored books are today, 
McCaffrey providing the basic storyline and the co-author writing the story.

I remember Chalker writing something on a simular line, and I *know* Niven & 
Pournelle have, too.  They also mentioned that they had to work out the 
*implications* of their technologies like the Alderson Drive to see what 
kinds of cultures were possible.  For instance, given even *current* weapons 
technologies (1999 AD), no Langston Field, and an Alderson Drive that allowed 
you to pick and choose where in a system you could come in at, assuming you 
could come out at orbital distances instead of \'way the hell out there\', it\'s 
just too easy for Bad Guys to come out of space, shoot the place up, land, 
loot, and fade into the woodwork before getting caught.  Planetary defense is 
a *nightmare*, and \'upward mobility\' means getting your hands on a ship and 
some nukes and raiding your neighbors.  Damned near impossible to create and 
maintain anything like a stable culture.

Typical TNG.  Typical plot:  "Wesley saves the ship again using Yet Another 
Weird Bogus Particle\'.  Thing I *liked* about the original series (\'TOS\') 
were remarks like Scotty saying \'But Cap\'n!  Ye canna break the laws of 
*physics*!!\'

This is pretty much the same reason I like B5 and Crusade so much.

A quick fix would be \'Yeah, we hit them with the antibogositron particles.  
But it fried out the main flux manifold, and we\'ll have to send back to Star 
Fleet Supply for a replacement; we *can\'t* replicate it, they just don\'t 
*work* when you try it!\'

Just curious, but isn\'t this why most downports have landing pads = separated=20
from living quarters?  Some of them with high earthwork walls? ...or am = I=20
missing the point?

The only problem with this is that it\'s as easy to go from Pistol-33
to Pistol-34 as it is to go from Pistol-1 to Pistol-2. Traveller\'s
lack of a skill level ceiling makes it difficult to judge which
of these two things should be harder.

One way is to say that skills should be harder to improve as the levels
get higher, as you need more and more knowledge/experience as you go up.
Electronics-6 could be an order of magnitude more knowledge/experience
than Electronics-5.

You have a darn good point there.  I never really sat and thought about
that, but in real life the more you delve into a field, the more esoteric it
becomes.  Stands to reason any good skill system should at least attempt to
mirror this.

I\'ve mentioned this before, so I will again.  <grin>.  There is an even
greater miracle in their tech.  What do you get when you combine replicator,
communicator, computer and transporter technology?  The ability to recreate
someone who has died, with their computerized \'copy\' constantly updated via
communicator.  Therefore, death is meaningless in the long run.  sure, its
unfortunate for the copy who dies, but just replicate via the transporter
another copy and presto.  Stephen Goldin writes about such a thing in his
book, "The Eternity Brigade" which is a damn good read.

IMTU crude grav seeking missiles were introduced one TL after air rafts.
They got better and more diverse as TLs increased, as did counter measures

dichotomy as a model.

The physics of the system fall well outside of the range that ANY
Traveller based design system could create, with three habitable worlds.

The main effect in the stories, the nanites that change the agent, can
be hand waved as some type of ancient artifact. Once beyond the fact
that they are well beyond the highest Trav tech level, their effects can
be gamed rather easily with Trav\'s rules. It\'s quite reasonable to have
the nanites tied to something on a world or worlds (possibly a central
processor... anyone see Crusade?) and have one of the effects be the
death of the host once away form the control of the CPU. 

The fact that the lead character was a multiple clone with matched
memories is also beyond the scope of Traveller tech levels.

Best bet would be to modify the scenario to a single world, maybe with
three distict continents (all artificial and equal in size) that
"someone" is using as a prison after finding out that the nanite "virus"
kills anyone infected once a certain distance from the world (say just
under the jump limit) was reached.

Another possiblity is to have the nanites create massive jumpspace
intolerence in the recipiants. THat way they can move at sub-light
speeds but not jump. This would make the system less effective as a
jail, however.

Don\'t know about the above but I heard tell of a simular pintal mounted xbow
used from river partol craft in the delta in the Viet Nam War.  It was
reportedly used to fire "torchs" into buildings.

I loved the book, but as I remember, you couldn\'t come out just anywhere.
There were specific points or areas one had to get to in order to Jump and
from which one exited from, although they were not limited by the same 100 d
limit of Trav. I asked about ideas on how the Alderson Drive might work in
the TU earlier, and am eagerly awaiting the arrival of First In (couple days
from now, I think.) to see how the steller data is handled.

Not if Ken is looking for 1 level per year. ;-> 

During character generation the number of levels gained per year varies from
system to system.  So perhaps the experience system you use should vary from
system to system matching character generation.

I use the Intel version of Lightwave 5.6.  Reading from the box cover, LW
5.6 requires a minimum of 32megs, a 486 w/FPU, 10megs hdd, cd, and a screen
resolution of 800x600.  That said; BWAAHHAAAA HAAAA HAAAAAA HAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!
Oh, I don\'t think so!!  While I\'ve run LW on as little as a P120 with 64megs
of RAM, I did not enjoy it :)  Currently, I run it on a PII-266 or PII-350,
with a 128megs of RAM, depending on whether I\'m at home or work.  This is
starting to get a little long in the tooth for me.  I\'d like to get up to a
dual PII-550 with 256megs+, and a SERIOUS video card like an Oxygen 404 or
better :)

When I arbitrate a game* I always maintain the right to throw an occasional
goody beyond the scope of the usually restrictive system I have customized.
And even if I start off canonical to a particular system, I always find
myself tweaking it till the Heresy Event Horizon is crossed. Usually in a
matter of months. By keeping the base experience system restrictive, I can
keep things from getting crazy when my local number cruncher has discovered
all the quirks in the system that can be exploited. I think that\'s more
enjoyable to him than even the playing, except when I arbitrated Amber. No
point in that type of mindset with that game. And I can subtly steer the
chr\'s skill progression. When the Goodies come out, they get a kick too, and
you can tie many into the storyline.

*I try to avoid this, as I want to play instead. But my group whines a lot
when neglected. ;)

I\'d actually like to do something like your second suggestion for the
interior of "Starports" or for my own Blackmoore Heavy Industries site.  The
idea has been floating about my head for some time :)  I MAY do your first
suggestion for G:S if possible, but that may not happen due to time
restraints.

Thanks for the comments!!!

Actually, "flat" fields, *between* pairs of plates are a lot more
likely than spherical, for a number of reasons, including the one you
just mentioned. 

But basicly a "confined" field should take a lot less energy. But there
will be a *distinct* "step" between fields of different intensities.

Well, since there\'s no way to convey tone in print (or at least no
"standard" way), I use asterisks to indicate stress. That is, in most
cases where a sentence can be taken more than one way, the difference
between them when spoken is which words are stressed. So I use the
asterisks to indicate the stressed words. 

I\'m not talking about the sort of overemphasis that one post mentioned
(put *this* hand in *that* glove). Just the "normal" bit of extra
stress on words in some sentences. Stress that tends to change the
meaning. 

I could use _underlines_, but that requires using the shift key, and is
a lot more awkward to type.

For what it\'s worth, I enjoy sharing my knowledge, and helping people.
In person, I\'ve gotten compliments on the fact that I don\'t talk down
to people when doing things like helping them out of messes caused by
"stupid" mistakes on their computers. 

ps. please note that I\'ve only used asterisks once in this message, and
that was essentially a case of quoting someone. And I just hope my
meaning isn\'t distorted by their absence.

    Bugger, Jesse, the thing is that the universe is great, & I have been
using Traveller Starships in my game.  I am also working on a Traveller
Netbook for Phase World.  If Marc would let me use the Traveller Name & Logo
I would love it.  But, if he will not, that is fine as well.
    Btw, do you mind if I link some stuff on my page to your pics.  I am
working on the Far Trader, the Suliman Scout, etc, etc, etc.

have any ownership of the game, that I know about.

Don\'t forget, put large heavy tools/parts/stuff (spanner wrenches,
spare 5cm bolts, bowling balls etc etc) in storage locker bins at each
end of the corridors, with solenoid activated releases on the bin 
doors so you can key them from the bridge when you initiate the 
grav pong game.  If you make it grav pong plus asteroids, it\'s much
more fun for the casual anti-hijack gamer...

You could tie the skill advancement to game time, instead of play time.
Players may accumulate points for play session, but can only redeem them
for skills at the rate of one skill point per character year.

Sure, if the players run marathon sessions they could rack up years worth
of points, but that just means their characters will have to spend years
training or working to make use of their experiences.

And if they don\'t, so what? Characters should be able to make use of what
they have accomplished without necessarily becoming superheroes. People in
real life build on their past accomplishments, travels, friends, jobs, and
experiences without getting bigger, stronger, and faster as they age.

I played in one guy\'s homegrown fantasy campaign where experience points
were used for things like die modifiers. You could use your points to add
to your hit or reaction rolls and subtract from your enemies\' damage rolls.
Maybe it would be better to let characters gain skill and stats by
studying, surgery, job training, or whatever, and let the points that
players get be used for game effects.

  To be fair, I was thinking of something a lot more reasonable  - a self-

Frankly, I am surprised that this is beyond Traveller\'s scope.  We can
almost do it now.  (The cloning).
As far as the guy\'s mind placed within the skulls of all those people..I\'m
not quite sure..

The memory exchange was more of what I was thinking of. In GT, with a
little finagleing it could be done. Ultatech supports brain taping. But
in main stream Traveller canon, this would be impossible.

Well, how about "large" deep holes? :-) 

I thought that they had done some work on using electron beams for
tunneling through rock?

Grammar. 

When you throw a bunch of people together without a common language,
they develop a sort of mish-mash of several of the languages. This is
"pidgin" and people use their "native" grammar when speaking it, as
word order and the like have gone out the window as far as being
meaningful grammatical elements.

When a community of pidgin speakers is stable for a generation or so,
you have kids growing up with it as their "native" language. At this
point it acquires "rules" and becomes a "creole".

Since there are no grammatical cues from their parents and other adults
(well, no *consistent* ones) ones, the kids have grown up in a "grammar
free" environment.

Yet studies seem to show that the grammars of *all* creoles are far too
similar to for it to be a coincidence. Even when they throw out the
cases where it\'s arguable that the sample was "contaminated". 

I also seem to recall that some sounds/expressions/whatever you want to
call them *are* hardwired. Laughing, for instance.

Check out Niven\'s essay "Theory & Practice of Teleportation". As he
points out, *any* teleport system that doesn\'t require both a
transmitter *and* a receiver will result in a short, *nasty* war almost
immediately after being discovered.

For example, just consider what would have happened if during the Cold
War either side had come up with a way to transmt bombs to any point
they chose ("receiverless teleportation") or to snatch missiles and
other items from anyplace they chose ("transmitterless teleportation").

Instant, *very* one sided war.

And if you want to see what happens in a universe where the "plot
saver" devices *aren\'t* forgotten, try E.E."Doc" Smith\'s "Lensman" or
"Skylark" series. The arms race in those books is almost enough to
frighten a munchkin! (Hint: at the end of one series, Our Heros have
just destroyed an entire *galaxy*.)

Let\'s see how many of you can figure out the right response to *this* "world".

You\'ve encountered a system containing a ringworld, and two planets.
All orbiting a fairly normal G class star. 

One planet is an airless rockball, and as I recall orbits inside the
"orbit" of the ringworld. The other is rather Earth-like and orbits a
bit outside.

From the spacing of the shadow squares and the rotational speed of the
ring, it would appear that the local day is about 30 hours. 

The ringworld and the Earthlike planet seem to be *very* "under
developed" apparently these folks like lots of space. There\'s eveidence
of lots of small towns and villages, but the only major urban type
concentrations seem to be at the rim walls. 

There\'s one *odd* feature on one of the "continents". It looks like
someone sliced off a small mountain range at a few thousand feet up,
and polished the resulting flat surface. Looks like some sort of
marble, not granite.

Anybody recognize the place yet?

For a "literary" example, refer to _Judge Dredd: The Apocalypse War_.

This storyline complilation of the famous british comic series has
two megacities in a nuclear balance of terror. Unknown to the good guys,
the bad guys have developed a defense shield known as the
"Apocalypse Warp". When the good-guy city gets invaded by the bad 
guys, the good guys launch a bunch of missiles - which hit the
Apocalypse Warp, and get teleported to another world. The bad guy 
missiles, of course, meet no such warp on their way to selected sectors
of the good guy city.

What was a balanced cold war turns almost immediately into 
guerrila warfare versus a conquering army, with vast portions of
Mega City One (the Good Guy city) simply gone.

Four habitable worlds.  But they were terraformed by nanites.  A bit of a

Actually, the 4 \'donor\' bodies were natural bodies that had been brainwiped 
and retaped with the personality and memories of the agent.  According to my 
BBB (Traveller \'hardback\' rules set), cloning is a TL13 technology, thus 
\'brain taping\' should naturally start happening around TL14, 15, or 16.  
Thus, the taping is reachable.  <grin>

That\'s *why* the Alderson Drive was rigged to work like it did.  If you could
pop in right over top of a planet, wait a few tens of seconds to shake off the
Jump effect, you could then attack or invade the planet in question
preactically with impunity.  Planetary defenses would be wired to attack at
detection unless an automated IFF signal with the proper code keys wasn\'t
transmitted.  And ghod help you if your IFF transmitter was whacked.  <grin>

Without Langston fields, space combat would be short and brutal, with few
survivors.  Ships would be *small*, lightly crewed, and basically \'pt boats\'.
Emphasis would be on sheer numbers, and you\'d expect heavy losses.  *With*
Langston fields, combat craft would be larger, and you\'d get large crewed
cruisers and battleships because they\'d *survive* longer.  Space combat would
become more of the long range long duration duels talked about in MIGE.

I don\'t know, but I suspect the Astronomy article will have been
written by an American. The pronunciation was actually changed - very
amusingly to the British, I assure you - during the fly-by, due to
pressure from a group going by the name of the \'Moral Majority\'
(whatever that is) which felt that it was an inappropriate
pronunciation for prime time television reports. If you check the
dictionary (not Webster\'s) you will find that "your anus" is the
correct pronunciation.

Um, don\'t take this as a flame, but on all my computers "*" requires

Italics would be the standard print way to do so I guess, but it

Well, I can do transfers at work. Kodak Pantone printer hooked up to a Mac
(we usually print from Photoshop). IIRC, transfers were $5 in real money
(not that overvalued US stuff :-) ).

T-shirts would have to be bought. MEC has a nice organic cotton for $11, so

Also called nuclear pulse drives, Orion thrusters work by detonating a
nuclear bomb under a large hemispherical baseplate. The plate, with the
rest of the ship mounted on large shock absorbers, is thrust forwards.
Orion drives are large, uncomfortable, and anything but subtle-but they
work.
Orion engines are rarely encountered in the Traveller universe, because of
the early advent of reactionless thrusters. However, they can provide
low-tech planets with a nasty surprise for intruders: the bombs themselves
are dangerous at close range, while they can also be used to trigger
nuclear-pumped x-ray lasers. The effective thrust of an Orion drive is
dependent on two factors: the yield of the propellant bombs, and the pulse
rate (the number of bombs exploded per second).
thrust = 200 tons x yield x pulse rate
An Orion drive consists of a baseplate module, plus a variable number of
shock absorber and bomb delivery modules.
Baseplate Module
Every Orion drive requires one of these.
Volume: 2 spaces
Mass: 50 stons
Cost: 0.1 MCr x Sqrt(BPS)
Bomb Delivery Module
Every Orion drive requires at least one of these. Multiple modules can be
used to give higher pulse rates, up to a maximum rate of 10 bombs per
second.
Volume: 0.5 spaces
Mass: 12.5 stons
Cost: 0.25 MCr x Sqrt (BPS)
	Maximum output:	GTL7	2.5
		GTL8	5
		GTL9+	10
Shock Absorber Module
Every Orion drive requires at least one of these. Install one shock
absorber module for every kiloton yield of the drive bombs.
		GTL7	GTL8	GTL9+
Volume (spaces):	2	1	0.5
Mass (stons):	50	25	12.5
Cost (MCr):	0.1	0.05	0.025
Note: multiply cost by Sqrt (BPS)
Bomb Rack Module
An Orion drive requires bombs. Divide the number of bombs carried by the
pulse rate to determine maximum time under full acceleration. (Of course, a
lower pulse rate, and hence lower acceleration, is always possible.)
Volume: 1 space
Mass: 12.5 stons (when loaded)
Cost: 25 MCr (to load)
Depending on yield and tech level, each bomb rack module can store the
following number of bombs.
	Yield	GTL7	GTL8	GTL9	GTL10+
	1	595	1190	2380	100000

According to FF&S the deck plates provide both inertial dampening and
internal gravity. That is, they both hold you to the deck and prevent you
from going splat when the ship accelerates. This is a good ruling, IMHO,
since it explains why large ships\' acceleration is limited to that of grav
compensation and not the propulsion technology, why missiles are not
limited in the same way, and why there are not separate "acceleration Gs",
"maneuver Gs", and "habitable Gs" in the design rules.

However, this makes it necessary for deck plates to be able to change their
interior field at least as fast as the ship can maneuver; probably
instantly. Otherwise you\'ll get "grav pong" whenver the ship changes facing.

First of all, they have to be able to turn a corridor into a deadly pit
because in most ship designs corridors already are deadly pits when the
ship accelerates.

Leonard\'s answer to this is that the grav effect is generated between pairs
of deck plates, so they don\'t have to "project" anything. I think this is
an excellent ruling because it also explains why you can\'t use deck plates
as a tractor beam or grav gun, and why Traveller starships have parallel
decks stacked up like earthbound buildings instead of allowing crew to walk
all over the entire interior of the ship including the walls and ceilings.

Perhaps this is one of the reasons that cloning never took off big in the
3I, Ziru Sirka, or Rule of Man.  Surely the nobility in all three Imperiums
wouldn\'t want an emperor/emperess to live forever even in cloned form.  The
Moot would never stand for it.  OTOH there were alot of emperors in the 3I
that were suceeded by assassination.  Maybe they were looking in to the
forbidden(?) science of cloning?

I do remember reading somewhere (maybe the Rebellion Sourcebook) that the
Strephon who appeared after the assassination in MT was an android or robot
duplicate?  The dependence on robotics and computers in the 3I (even in MT)
fits the premise for TNE....  A cloning technology wouldn\'t have allowed for
the kind of history that TNE shows.

Any thoughts?  Opinions?  Flames?  :)

I don\'t like the underline style, I\'ve seen it on a few posts, and I find it
very distracting. They break up the flow of words even worse than asterisks.
But don\'t asterisks also require the shift key? They do on my keyboard,
unless I reach way over to the number pad.

That was one of the first things that caught me about Shadowrun. After the
first game the arbiter started handing out rewards, and along with the cash
and experience I was expecting came a couple of contacts to write in the
appropriate box. It turned out to be a major part of the campaign, the
contacts, allies, rumours, etc.

IMTU I was declaring inertial compensators to be a seperate system,
one that nullified all gravity and acceleration effects - within the
effects of the inertial dampening field, the only acceleration/gravity
would be that generated by the g-plates.  Turning inertial comp off
and on was similar to turning grav plates off and on - it would take a 
matter of minutes for a charge to build up in the system, once it was
"up" you stopped feeling gravity and acceleration effects.

I can see that it would be easy to combine both into the same 
system. Have the grav plates substitute their own vector - 1G "down",
for example - for any vectors applied by gravity or acceleration from 
outside their own field. This allows inertial dampening, varying internal
gravity (including "zero G" - the grav plate substitutes *nothing* for
external accelerations, very different than having the grav plate 
turned off completely), *and* allows the "build a charge" effect I
was talking about.

First of all, they have to be able to turn a corridor into a deadly pit
because in most ship designs corridors already are deadly pits when the

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
I thought the original FF&S grav & inertial compensator plates in the 
floor (and ceiling?) of the corridor were taking care of that...oh, I see, 
inertial compensation is through application of more or less gravity,
which only works towards or away from the plates...thus the entire
internal surface of any inertial comp\'ed area has to be lined with
grav plates, ceiling, floor, walls and all the corners.

Grav compensation must also not be dependent on the distance from
the plate, otherwise a 6G counter-acceleration on me while I was
50 meters from the plate would squish the person standing next to
the plate, what with the usual distance squared laws.

I like this idea as well, I think I may make us of it. It makes the
classic yacht with a transparent ceiling for the ballroom a little more
difficult, though.

Speaking of stacked decks:

What if grav plates work best if you apply them in large sheets? That
is, the larger the area of each deck, the better they work?

That would explain a lot of the ship designs in the OTU with deck
layouts paralell to thrust, when perpendicular ("stacked like
earthbound buildings") often makes more sense from an acceleration
point of view.

Now this statement I must agree with.  I have seen and read numerous studies
on psychology, sociology and education that show how facial expressions and
body language (the sub-conscious type) are common in all cultures
world-wide.  Even dogs are known to attempt a smile in imitation of us.
There was a recent National Geographic special on Koko, the signing gorilla
with a kitten, that showed her common facial expressions, as well as
understanding of them in humans. My answer to the question is:

Facial Expressions.

That looks great!!  That would be about $10 US or so plus s&h.  I\'d buy
some!

This would make it about $15 US each.  That\'s still a good deal!  Especially
for Jesse\'s level of artwork!

Just such a thing was done in a book by F. Paul Wilson called "Healer".
There was an entire race or lizards controlled by an insane god-like mutant
member of their race.  They were clear accross the galaxy from the Terran
Federation and they\'d open up what looked like wormholes, at random, and
have their jump-harness assisted troops go thru, shoot up the immediate
place, then retreat.

        For those of you who have never looked at R.Talsorian Games\'
_Cyberpunk 20202_, the EXP system there is pretty nice.  To increase a skill
costs 10x the current level of the skill in XP.  So, if I am going from
Pilot-1 to Pilot-2, it\'s 10XP.  From Pilot-2 to Pilot-3 is 20XP.  Some
skills have difficulty modifiers associated to keep things in balance...
Fixed Wing Pilot is x1, where Vectored Thrust is x3...  so to progress from
VT-Pilot 2 to VT-Pilot 3 costs you 60XP instead of 20XP.

        Its nice, easy to remember and quick.

I suppose we could go with how the ancient Greeks pronounced the
name. (And why is it that the planet is named for a Greek god when
all the others are named for Roman ones?). But then we\'d have to
pronounce the Jovian moon Io as "EE-oh" rather than the more usual
"EYE-oh"...

The alternative pronunciation "YER\'n-us" that some people have
been suggesting doesn\'t quite work. It sounds so... so... renal.

Surprisingly little.  Just the nanites, mostly.  Brain taping should come in 
around TL15 or so, since full body cloning comes in at about TL13, 14.  
Remember, the \'prisoners\' weren\'t cloned, they were brainwiped and had the 
agent\'s memories and skills and such downloaded onto the blank brains.  <grin>

Standard jump drives would work well here, of course, with a \'mcguffin\' that 
the nanites *kill* anybody \'infected\' with them when they get a certain 
distance from the star (somewhere *within* the 100 diameter limit, of 
course...)

Ah, but Kali\'s troops didn\'t have an easy time.  AAMOF, it was Kali herself that openned up the wormhole, and she could only open up 1 at a time.  <grin>

Take a look over on the numeric keypad. :-)

In any case, underline is more of a reach. And before you jump on me
about "clear over on the keypad" let me point out that I\'m a two-finger

Well, given that you *can\'t* do italics without HTML or the like, I\'d

Well, with good sensors and switching, you migght pull that off for
*one* person in an area. I can even see a limited form of it being used
with multiple people in medium sized (but *very* well padded) rooms in
amusement parks. Try playing multi-person "tag" in a room like that.

of the players on a more or less level surface. :-)

I can also see a race using spherical ships with the "decks" being
concentric spheres. It\'d still work with my "between plates" model. So
would "nested cylinders". But they\'d be be a royal pain to deal with if
the grav plates were knocked out.

Please re-read the paragraph you quoted. I said "hardwired", I also
said that they can be overriden.

In other words, they are "merely" a default setting. In the absence of
an established grammar, humans seem to "invent" the *same* grammar over
and over. But they can learn other grammars just as easily.

*How* we got from this to the diverse grammars in the world no one
knows. I\'d suspect that some cases may have stemmed from attempts to
create a "secret language" that eventually took over.

It\'s possible (in theory) to create a *real* gravity field with
"parallel" "field lines". It\'s the solution for an "infinite" flat
plate. And the strength of the field *doesn\'t* drop with distance.

You see, the inverse square law is a consequence of *geometry. Of the
way the "area" to be covered by the field changes with distance. If the
field doesn\'t spread, there\'s no decrement with distance.

Not necessarily. The "grid" for the field elements ("grav plates" ) may
be of something that can be transparent. Or, it may be possible to use
very fine wires, closely space. They\'d double as an electrostatic
shield against high energy charged particles, so as to reduce the
radiation dosage to anyone in the ballroom. 

So if you looked *really* closely, you\'d see a faint hint of a grid of
nearly invisible wires running thru the "glass". 

This has a third advantage. It prevents radio signals from going thru
the "glass". Anybody trying to signal to another ship will have to use
a visible or IR laser.

Interesting thought. Except that then the most efficient layout for
spherical ships is concentric spheres. 

I\'d guess that they simply trust grav plates the way we trust
elevators. 

Hmmm. Now *there\'s* a thought. We have to go to considerable lengths to
get people to *not* use elevators during fires and similar emergencies.

So maybe in Traveller, they have to have special locks and warning
signs to keep people out of the "pit trap" corridors during emergencies
where there\'s a chance that the gravity might fail.

I can think of a couple of consequences. First, the "ceiling" of all
such corridors has one (or even *two* if the corridor is wide enough)
set(s) of ladder rungs, such that you can climb the length of the
corridor when the g-comp and grav plates are off. 

Other possible safety features are nets that snap across the corridor
at intervals, so as to catch anyone stupid enough to have walked in
from a cross-corridor. 

Likewise, the sternward wall of cross-corridors would have a surface
suitable for using as a floor. And cabins would have ladders or the
like to allow getting to the door under thrust, but with g-comp out. 

And there might be "ornamental" partial bulkheads extending out into
the "pit" corridors. Which become ledges, just big enough to walk on
when g-comp is out. Doors tend to be placed so that you have either no
drop or a very short drop to such a ledge.

I *like* this! It\'s giving me all sorts of neat "details" for cabins
and corridors. They\'re dictated by safety regs, but most folks would
never even notice them or think that they were decorative. 

Hmmm. I know my artistic skills aren\'t up to it. I wonder if my (unused
for 25 years!) model building skills are? Now *that* would be a
project. Build a detailed model at fairly large scale and then use a
digital camera to take photos of shipboard life. Boy, now I wish I
still had all those old Major Matt Mason figures (6" tall "astronauts"
that were poseable).

They also need cooling for the baseplate. And in the process they
provide *enormous* amounts of high temp steam for generating power, use
as thrusters, or direct use in "catapults" for launching ordinance.

Shouldn\'t the volume/area depend on the yeild of the bomb *and* the
size of the ship? Also, they don\'t *have* to be hemispherical. Merely
curved appropriate to the bomb yield. And for *really* big ships (such
as an old Orion powered *starship* design I once saw) they become
spherical thrust chambers with exhaust nozzles. These *greatly*
increase the thrust given by a bomb, but require truly *huge* ships. 

Oh yeah, an Orion ship has *greatly* increased resistance to most
weapons if it is positioned so that they hit the baseplate. :-)

If you are sufficiently crazy (or desperate) you could even build Orion
drives to boost large ground installations into space. Picture an Orion
drive "ship" a kilometer or more across, which has a payload consisting
of an old research installation\'s particle accelerator ring upgraded to
a weapon. (along with a nuclear reactor for power).

A 500 meter radius, circular CPAW with (probably) at least 8 "firing
ports" around the circumference. 

"Low tech" worlds are *full* of nasty suprises for would-be conquerors.
There are all sorts of things that *could* have been built but never
were because the need wasn\'t there. An invasion can change that.

ACR\'s have other advantages in my scheme. Below is a chart summing
up the common personal weapons.

Oops this has been renamed Damage (DAM) to avoid confusion.

Your aproach is certainly simpler, (and therefore in that
sense superior) than mine. The only problem I have with it
is high damage/low rof weapons will not be modled correctly.
IE a laser rifle has purty darn good Armor penetration
capability but still only fires once per trigger pull.
if you up the FP of the laser to reflect its ability to
punch holes in armor, you give it too much kill power
against lightly armored opponents.
If armies in YTU are prety much all equipped to the level of
CES or better your aproach will work grand. If like me you
have a significant low tech element in your campaign, I think
some seperate comparison of weapon/armor is called for.

>>Range (RNG)

Determine range as suits you of course, See chart below for how
I actually worked it out. Which is of course entirely different
than the way I described.

This is a judgement call. I personally wouldn\'t. Low tech forces
are gonna have enough troubles without the added burden of an
artificial morale decrease.

Yup. It\'s amazing how homogeonous the training is for graduates of
the imperial command colleges.

Good point on the K\'Kree, have to double check the canon on
the Aslan though.

Zhodani forces should be fun to work with too.
Imagine trying to hold the Tractor Factory when a company of teleporters
materialize and engage your forces in mellee.

Now why didn\'t I think about grav belts? In-helmet commo will allow
non-adjacent fire groups, but what if your opponent has significantly
better EW assets? (An obvious TL advantage will give opponents fits
in this department.)

All good points. As for starting fires, I think the big weapon in
this aspect would be the P/FGMP\'s. Part super bazooka, part flame thrower.
Oy, I\'m still trying to figure out how to rate them.

the weapons were increased to bring them in line with
SL capabilities. You may wish to Rate SMG\'s RNG=2
I wanted to give the Shotgun a slight edge on range
but didn\'t want to rate it at 3, so....

AHL armor ratings for comparison are
Mesh, -2. Flak Jacket, -4. Cloth, -6.
Combat Armor, -8. Battle Dress, -10.
Ablat, -6 (vs laser only)
Reflec, -10 (vs laser only)

Note that lasers, can paint targets for guided munitions
at darn near any range in SL terms. (Unless you\'ve got
16 boards stuck end to end. <grin>)

I\'m still trying to figure out how to rate the support weapons,
and the RAM Rifle grenade causes problems as well.

    Just wanted to chime in here, although I must confess I am more of a 
philologist (one who studies word origins and change over time) than a 
bio-linguist.   There are things about spoken language that are hard wired 
into the brain, at least according to Naom Chomsky and other more modern 
linguists.  I believe their point is that specific grammars are not wired in, 
but the system of translating "grammars" into useful ideas is.   So for 
example English marks the subject of the sentence by placing it in a 
particular place in the word order, but Latin marks the subject by a 
particular word ending.   Both grammars are very different, but the need to 
mark the subject of the sentence is the same:  that is the hard-wired part.  
"The What we need to say" is built in, "The Way we say it" is essentially 
aribrary and changes constantly.

    The planets out to Saturn were all named in ancient times, since they  
are all visible without a telescope.  We inherited the Latin forms of the 
names because of the cultural dominance that Latin had in Western education 
up to this century.  

    I would surmise that Uranus was picked as part of this sequence:  the 
father of Mars (Ares) is Jupiter (Zeus), the father of Jupiter is Saturn 
(Kronos).  The father of Kronos in Greek mythology was Ouranos, for whom 
there was no Latin equivalent.  So who ever named the planet must have 
hastily "Latinized" Ouranos as Uranus, which is the correct transliteration  
Thus keeping th father/son sequence in tact.

This helps!  I hadn\'t thought of it that way.  It helps clarify what was
said earlier.  I was looking at it from the purely genetic(?) point of view.
Babies understand facial expressions early in their development long before
their "speech" is recognizable.  I see your point as well.   Thanks!

Wow, other people who have read HEALER!  I suppose this would be the place
to look.  I only happened to because I plucked it out of a free bin at a
local bookstore years back.  I remember it best for an exchange near the
end (quoted from memory):

"Might I ask, sir, what you intend to shoot with such a weapon?"
"God."

Imagine my surprise when I found a reference to alarets in one of the old

guess it\'s one of those "secret classics."

Leonard has some great thoughts on architectural details for ships with
artificial gravity.  Might \'drop shaft\' corridors also have air-bags hidden
in the end walls to catch the really determined idiots?  ("You can make a
thing fool-proof, but you can\'t make it damn-fool-proof.")

Finally, something has always bothered me about the Orion concept.  Perhaps
I\'m just ignorant about nukes, but how do you keep the ship from being
simply vaporized by the blast(s), especially when starting from rest?

The hypertext is relative, but the menu bar is not.  With over 120 pages in
about 20 directories, implementing and maintaining the JavaScript is less
labor intensive this way.  It also brings downloaders back to the source and
helps when tracking my stats.  I get the best trace of how people navigate
my site.
Besides, I had no idea I was going to be moving the site and losing my DNS
at the same time!

IIRC A.C. Clarke once wrote a short story about that. The martains
blockladed Earth just after WWII, when our rocketry and atomic weapons
started making us a threat. They were amazed at our meek behaviour -
which was cover for intensive R&D into a transmitter only teleporter.
The war was over before the Martians even knew it had started, with all
of their cities, etc nuked in an instant.

The Strephon who appears after the assassination was in fact a clone.
In is explicitly mentioned in _Survival Margin_, where IIRC (all my
Trav books are still boxed up after moving) he laments his clones fate
in his private dairy.

With concentric cylinders in the event that you lose the plates
spinning could be an option, provided that you\'ve bothered to keep
track of your mass distribution.  I could see a lot of the standard
commercial ships having software packages that have all that sort of
stuff buried out of sight, with the result that when something goes
wrong that the package\'s producers didn\'t allow for you\'re in at the
deep end.

Interesting thought. Except that then the most efficient layout for
spherical ships is concentric spheres. 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Here\'s my guess as to why ships like the Kinunir are built
instead of concentric-deck spheres or cylinders:

To get efficient large fields, the plates have to be fitted together
in the same flat plane - if they\'re on a curved surface, their fields
interfere with each other. Even ramps and other inclined surfaces
will actually be structures built above non-inclined grav plates.

I like the way this idea works. Since you can still make small
grav-plate areas work, you will see small-diameter ships with
decks perpendicular to thrust - ships built with very high
maneuver drive capabilities, or with such tight power availability
that the crew regularly has to reduce or cut off g-comp.
Any ship where an efficiency loss in the g-comp was considered
a reasonable trade-off to get floors that are under your feet
when you\'re thrusting with no g-comp.
However, since there is an efficiency benefit to large deck areas,
you\'ll see Type-S scouts, Kinuinirs, and even multi-kiloton
battleships built with decks paralell to thrust. These will be built
by cultures that seldom see g-comp fail, so they only minimally plan
for such a failure, and reap the benefits of a more efficient (more stable?
less expensive? more reliable?) g-comp system on their ships.

Alternately, ships with parelell decks are built because they\'re easier
to draw... <G>

Um, not *quite*, Rupert.  The Strephon that Dulinor whacked was the clone.  
The guy writing the diary in SM was the *real* Strephon.

Speed *20*????  In the book, they just basically hung from the ceiling and 
dropped when they detected any kind of warm blooded critter coming into the 
cave.  More like, \'Speed: 0\' for all intents and purposes.

> Planet :  all                                           Terrain :  Caves

I wouldn\'t put these things on *every* planet, just *one* someplace outside 
the normal space lanes, on a TL3- place.  <grin>  Otherwise, they *might* get 
hunted to death.

More of an auxiliary personality.  When the Healer got examined after getting
symbioted to one, the doctor couldn\'t find anything out of the ordinary with
him.  Presumably, it would use the glial cells of the brain instead of the
neurons for its storage.  Thus, two seperate \'brains\', undetectable, in one
body.

I know speed and planets don\'t make sense, but I typed it in right from the

For humans, spinning a ship that way is out of the question. It turns
out that spins with that small a radius at the required rates induces
*extreme* disorientation in most people (that\'s why so many carnival
rides spin the way they do). And a significant fraction suffer from
extreme naseua under those conditions. 

Experiments show that spin gravity is only practical with a radius of
say 50 meters or larger. Preferably a *lot* more. Like several hundred
meters. All because of human physiological limits.

I had no idea that the limit was that large. I thought it was more
along the lines of 50 _feet_, which would allow a ship with only about
10% of the cross section of a 50m radius ship.

Of course you did say that nice efficient orion engines need to be
mounted on big ships. It would appear that everything becomes so much
easier if you biuld on a grander scale.

GT Streamlined is "Very Good Streamlining, Lifting Body".

The combination of the two options is apparently the work around to the fact
that VG streamiling in G:V is limited to subsonic speeds (740 mph).

G:V USL is limited to an airspeed of 600 mph, as you will note on a couple of
ship designs in the main GT book.

CT - haven\'t a clue.

Actually, in MT, the Marines are shown more as shock troops overall rather
than simply reaction forces: Massive ammounts of firepower in small
(relatively) sized units, usually let loose with orders like "shoot
anything which even looks armed" and "Kill that man, and anybody who tries
to stop you" or the ever popular "Leave nothing standing but the people,
and them only if they stand unarmed".

Marines are the "Finesse" arm of the Navy, which is the mailed iron fist
inside that velvet glove.... the Marines are the Thumb.

IMTU, The army is there to hold marine acquisitions, provide the "Body
waves", and surpres populations in the long run. (Military occupations are
often the best way to introduce cultural elements...)

I can send you the disks in ShrinkitII files (I\'ve made the files for net
distribution in Binscii\'d SHK files... sendable as text)... you\'ll need to
have either an Apple II or an A2 emulator.... DOS 3.3 is not MSDOS3.3, but
Apple\'s Apple Disk Operating System 3.3 vs Apple ProDos x.x.

One of the disks sent to me for the project was not valid... don\'t remember
which.

And yes, there was an MSDOS 3.3 ... but no traveller files for it ...

One thing you all are overlooking is that the Hand Sling is a pain to get
any accuracy with... novice slingers are as likely tom end up with grenades
at their own feet that way. (heck, it was hard enough to keep a rock in the
hand sling).

A staff sling, however, can be used with as little training as a any modern
firearm, with nearly as good an accuracy. After only 15 to 20 minutes, I
was puting Grade AA extra large eggs _into_ a 4m gazebo at 60-80m... and
able to get them from the pitchers\' mound to the mound on the adjacent
baseball field after only a few hours of work. With 2 men on it, grenades
could work well. Especially the 18mm cylidrical ones undeer development for
the US army to export.

A staff sling is essentially a hand sling on a 2m pole... and is not
twirled, but used exactly like an atlatl, only much easier to do
successfully.

I remember that. It was in a collection of "First story sales". So it

Alarets! I recall a story in Analog many years back involving a
creature with that name. By any chance are these critters that normally
dwell in caves, and kill 99% of the humans who enter the caves? If so,
I\'d like the author and title of that book again!

I get the impression that the Imperium doesn\'t hold with going *that*
far towards protecting fools from themselves. Otherwise grav belts
would be illegal.

Easy. It\'s *too massive*. One of the early tests placed a set of
graphite coated spheres a few meters from the bomb. They survived the
blast unscathed. 

Theres a lot of heat, but if the plate can conduct it away fast enough,
and has enough thermal inertia it\'ll survive. There\'s pressure too, but
that is want pushes it.

Take a look at the stuff that survives near blasts. Or even check out
how *small* the cavities created by underground blasts are. 

It simply requires good engineering.

Yup, that\'s the critter alright.  The book is called \'Healer\' by E. Paul 
Wilson.  Loved it.  There was another book as well that Wilson set in the 
same universe, but I can\'t for the life of me remember its name, and \'Healer\' 
is packed away in one of my boxes someplace or I\'d check it out...

For ships that are "unstreamlined" by GT/VE2 standards, use the "no
streamlining" entries (or the default formula, if there isn\'t one). 

For open frame or planetoid hulls ("unstreamlined" to the rest of the
Traveller community), as best I can tell you have to invoke the rule (p.
VE166) that "all vehicles are treated as having "radical" streamlining due
to the lack of air resistance" in vacuum or trace atmospheres; in any other
case the ship is going to be destroyed on entry.

Which doe, of course, suggest an alternative means of playing ping-pong.
Next time you\'re boarded, simply turn off grav compensation in all the

I have another use for \'em, based on an observation I made. As well as being
the only beings in the universe to understand military science, they also
display almost total immunity to any kind of energy weapon (even AT-ST chin
blasters).

So, what I\'m going to do is buy a Navy-surplus Imperial Class Star
Destroyer, and plate the hull in Ewok hide. This solution gives me an almost
invulnerable warship and rids the universe of the Teddy Bear nation.

That wasn\'t a comment on PBEM, Keven. Please don\'t kill my character...

Actually I meant face-to-face roleplaying. Most of my characters have never
really had time to get more than a year or two older. We\'ve tended
not to have much downtime in the games I\'ve played in.

Prolly best that way.

My group always had the philosophy that the learning rate during adventuring
was a lot higher than in downtime.  I think that makes sense, since in
everyday life I\'m actually learning very little, just carrying out tasks I\'m
fairly familiar with with no need to expand my abilities very much. During
more intensive periods though it\'s possible to learn at a much much higher
rate (usually the few weeks before an exam period...).

$20 US is about $30 Cdn. About on par for retail markup, when you consider
license fees to Marc, and compensation to Jesse and myself.

I\'ll check out printing supplies next week. The easiest way to handle
logistics is probably to collect orders and cheques, only cashing them when
I make/ship the shirts, and then posting Jesse and Marc their cuts of the
action. As it\'s Jesse\'s art, I\'ll let him decide on whether or not he wants
to go ahead with this, though.

didn\'t like the new version of the Aslan, I still prefer the DGP 
explanations and style in that particular case.

I am also 75% of the way through writing a G:T module, but may need somebody 
to do some floor plans for me using CC2 or something similar (no access to 
my software over here...)to do up plans for a 400t Labship, a scientific lab 
and a large installation. I am in the process of teaching myself how to use 
GURPS Vehicles and Robots and appreciate any advice anyone can offer.

Has anyone heard anything about a release date for Paul Sanders\' Books?

Also possible are:

Doors that open into the corridoor and lock at 90 degrees to form ledges. Door
hinges are always to the rear of the ship. Doors are never further than 3 feet
from the rear wall of a cabin so they can always be reached when gravity is at
90 degrees to normal.

Spring loaded floor panels, hinged at the back end. They are normally held down

they fall flat against wall ledges to form a new floor. They leave a one foot

    If you mean the tonnage as in "100-ton scout" then this really refers to
displaced volume, measured in metric tonnes of liquid hydrogen (LH2),
sometimes called a "displacement ton". This comes out at 14 cubic metres.
(Water-based ships float, so their displacement is related to mass.
Spaceships are effectively immersed in their environment, so displacement is
related to volume.)

    As far as actual mass is concerned, ships tend to have a density of
between 0.5 and 2 tonnes per metre cubed, so one displacement ton will
really account for around fourteen tonnes of mass.

    Hope that helps (and is what you meant).

That\'s what I was looking for.

Is the amount of cargo space on a ship measured in displacement tons,
registered tons, or freight tons? Do you have to make a conversion for the
cargo space on a ship? It seems that you could carry a lot of freight tons
in the volume of a cargo hold measured by LH2 displacement.

It\'s kinda cute to think of jump capable ships with cargo capacity measured
in tuns of wine.

	In non-GT versions of Traveller, ships are rated *strictly* by
volume. One displacement ton is the volume taken up by one (metric,
mass) ton of liquid hydrogen, or about 14 cubic meters. Cargo space,
fuel tankage, everything. One ton=14m^3.

	As you\'ve noticed, there are a few problems with this:

	- Carrying one (displacement) ton of iridium should be a much
greater load on a ship than one (displacement) ton of feathers. As an
option for greater realism, for example, /Traveller:The New Era/
allowed for you to calculate the performance of ships based on their
actual mass rather than volume. But that\'s a slippery road to go
down. To be truly consistent, you\'d have to be constantly
recalculating ship performance based on how much fuel had been used
so far.

	For simplicity\'s sake, I considered going so far as to precalculate
ship performance every 10% of fuel, i.e. performance at 100% fuel is
xG, performance at 90% fuel is yG, etc. You\'d still have to adjust
for cargo loading.

	- It can get confusing, because vehicles, equipment, etc. are all
rated in *mass*, not volume. How many 1.5 ton (mass) automobiles CAN
you fit into your cargo bay?

Disclaimer: Note I said non-GT versions of Traveller ... due to real
life, I haven\'t been near a game store in over a year, and haven\'t
checked out GT versions ...

This may be somewhat heretical, but I\'ve always been dubious of "grav pong"
to repel boarders. From illustrations of the inside of starships, it
doesn\'t look like furniture, cargo, carried craft, and interior fixtures
are attached to bulkheads sufficiently strongly to stay put during variable
multi-G lateral acceleration. Moreover, most interior walls are not
load-bearing and wouldn\'t withstand the impact of, say, an air/raft at 4
Gs. This leads me to suspect anyone attempting to bounce boarders around
would quickly destroy the inside of their ship.

A freight ton is also 14 cubic metres, as far as I\'m aware.

A 200-ton (2,800 m3) free trader which was 25% cargo space would have
capacity for 50 tons (700 m3) of cargo.

Most design sequences assume that freight does not exceed 1000km per m3 (the
density of water). It\'s widely assumed that really dense items of freight
are packaged in containers with a lot of waste space to keep the density
below that value.

That was my solution in a (forgive me, I have sinned... I was young, 
naive...) Star Trek game once.  After the bad guys transported to our 
bridge.  Hold on to the console, and just flip the AG on and off.... as 
everyone floats off the deck and then crashes back down.

GT still rates cargo by volume, but calculates ship performance by mass. 
For simplicity, cargo mass is approximated at 5 mass tons per displacement
ton, which may be too low; most commercial designs should also be rated at
their "overload" condition of 20 mass tons per displacement ton of cargo. 
(Sometimes it\'s also worthwhile to calculate fueled and unfueled
performance; it can make a significant difference in light, high-Jump
ships.)

On the question of carrying vehicles as cargo, this is one of the few good
results of the detailed GURPS Vehicles design system*; it produces a volume
figure as well as a mass figure.  Vehicles are treated as
"Roll-on/Roll-off" cargo, which takes up twice its actual volume in cargo
space.  

* otherwise, Vehicles takes for too much work for the results, and takes up
way too much space in the source books.  IMHO, of course.

Interesting.

I thought asterisks represent bold or emphasis.

Also that underscores represent underlining, which represents italics.

So, if the drives are running at max thrust and someone turns them off,
are all loose items thrown against the ceiling/front of the ship?

I assumue that you don\'t have ships with decks parallel to the axis
of thrust (eg Type A free trader) where there are long corridors which
would turn into lift shafts after the first few metres.

IMTU I chose the "field created between plates in floor and ceiling"
option. I also have plates at the top and bottom of all lift shafts
(aka fore-aft corridors).

What\'s "VRML"?

Personally, I think it\'d only be practical for ships that never landed.
Otherwise, it\'d be next to impossible to get around in the ship while
refits were being done. 

It\'d sure confuse the heck out of boarding parties though. :-)

I suppose it\'s better than what William Herschel, the discoverer of the
planet, wanted to call it -- he wanted to name it "Georgian Sidus" after
King George III. Still, I wonder why in the Roman mythos, Saturn/Kronus\'s 
dad Ouranos was left out of the translation? Me, I\'d have fired his agent.

These days, the US dollar is worth about $1.50 Canadian. Of course, rates
change daily, if not more often -- I\'ve seen the exchange go from $1.46
to $1.50 in the space of a week... just before my one-week vacation trip

    Saturn and Jupiter were both names of gods who were worshiped in Italy 
before the identification of Roman gods with their nearest Greek equivalents. 
 Ouranos in Greece was never actually worshipped in the religious system, he 
existed in some stories and myths but wasn\'t considered "active".  So there 
was no compelling religious reason to find a Roman equivalent for Ouranos.   
    Ouranos was basically confined to Hesiod\'s early mythological account.  
When Ovid produced his Roman version of the great Greek myths (which version 
is the basis for most mythology texts of the middle ages and modern times) he 
omitted the entire Ouranos story.

	I\'d learned, at my  grandpappy\'s knee, that asterisk meant *bold*,
underline meant _underline_, slash meant /italic/; all generically
provide some form of emphasis to the words so marked.

	And comfy shoes means Aslan pirates.

The Romans killed all those who opposed meetings? Lethal bureaucrat-mind...

ObTrav: The First Rule of any organization is Self-Perpetuation; the Second
Rule is Empire-Building. After 1,100 years of growth and competition, what
kind of Byzantine (and I use the word advisedly) bureaucratic organizations
and weird turf battles exist in your Traveller universe? Perhaps this is
why we never see a coherent picture of the Imperial Bureaucracy -- there
just isn\'t one.

    The thing is that I think the Plankwell has more personallity that the

Perhaps you are using an inappropriate historical model, I would suggest
that using the imperial Chinese bureaucracy/civil service as an archetype
might be more appropriate.  It served for centuries through the rise and
fall of dynasties and even foreign invasion and conquest.  Arguable it still
exists, albeit in a modified form, on both the mainland and Formosa.

Congratulations!

On Saturday I got to meet the baby of some old friends of mine.  She was
really interesting (and cute, of course).

I\'ve always wanted to play a character with green eyes and a fairly dark
(ie non-European) skin colouration, and was never sure quite how this
combination would work.  But, my friends\' baby looks like that!  (Actually
her eyes are blue, and her hair is brownish.)

Basically, her father is anglo-Indian, giving her dark hair and skin, and
her mother is incredibly blond and blue-eyed.  So you get this interesting
combination, that I\'m more or less going to steal next time I roll up a
human PC.  

Hmm, let\'s see - he\'s one of Ouzo\'s(*) old friends, is more or less a
merchant, or could be an ex-Scout.  He\'d be 30-something, and probably from
Regina.  Now, what\'s his name?  Scratches head....

Alan Bradley
alanb@elf.brisnet.org.au

(*)  I\'m doing a fair bit of solo stuff at the moment, because I\'m not
currently living in "civilisation".  Ouzo is one of my solo game
"alter-egos" and a recurring NPC in my face to face games, although his
name only dates from early this year.

It\'s clear Ewoks are amateurs!

Obviously all the professionals in the Star Wars universe have been
neglecting the study of tactics to an extreme degree....

Welcome back!

A lot of the people I worked with when I was in Port Moresby were former
employees of Bougainville Copper.  Most of the "Bougainvillians" I knew
were actually from Buka.  (Note to everyone else:  Buka is a smaller island
just north of Bougainville.)  I heard a lot about the place.  

You should tell us a bit about it - how the society works, what the towns
and villages look like, and so on.  It\'s definitely "not-Kansas", and thus
of interest.  (Of course, I\'ve never been to Kansas...)

I picked up "First In" and "Cats and Cows" on Saturday.  I haven\'t really
looked at the Aslan section yet - I\'m reading through the K\'kree part in
detail.  It\'s a bit different from the old CT Alien module.  Most of it
kind of works, though.  There\'s still the problem of them being too far
away from where my campaigns are usually set  - it\'s hard to integrate them
into a game that uses Zhodani, Aslan and so on.

Was that the FASA Star Trek game?

FASA, of course, started as a Traveller licencee.  The ST RPG was a
"cousin" of Traveller, with marked similarities.

So, it\'s only a mild heresy.

This should be an important feature. Remember, _The Traveller Book_

Bureaucracies...

Then there was a similar White Dwarf scenario. 
...interior, PC approaches permit desk with a simple request.
"You have to fill these forms out, in triplicate, with a ball-point pen."
"OK."
<shuffle, scribble, write write...>
"Here you go."
"Nope, I said *ball-point pen*. Not this silly marker stylus stuff you
spacers use."
"A what?"
"One of these."
"Wow, that\'s a pretty primitive writing tool, I\'ve never seen one before.
Can I borrow one of yours to fill out these forms?"
...bureaucrat hands over a "Request to borrow writing implement form".
"Ummm, what do I use to fill *this* out?"
"Ball-point pen. All official forms must be filled out in ball-point pen."

I\'ve always been fond of "GarryOwen", myself.  OTOH, that may be a
result of having a Traveller character who, based on the T4 chargen
system, apparently spent most of his career in light armor (a.k.a.
"cavalry").  In fact, during his time as a major, he picked up
Equestrian skill.  We ruled that he commanded his regiment\'s ceremonial
horse-mounted troop (his home regiment having traditions modeled after
late 19th century American cavalry, down to the Stetsons, yellow
kerchiefs, and boots and spurs)....

That has so many really nice elements in it that I think it would look
great on a shirt!

No, actually this was a free-form PBEM that started out on Prodigy and

The one with the lens flare paralleling the ship?  I\'d vote for that too... 
I put it up on my workstation at work  this summer, and by the end of the

The novels are very entertaining. Well written, solid (if predictable) plot
line, and an excellent discussion of why there is no dominate culture in the
galaxy.

It\'s also GREAT source material for a (TL9?) lower tech Traveller game. The
plot revolves around the US Marine Corps. It\'s the story of how the Marines
battle to save the world, high TL "ancient" technology on found Mars/Moon,
and once again save the Marine Corps by giving it a new mission.

Pardon me if this is in the FAQ. Is there a Classic Traveller FAQ?

Just read book 1 "Simper Mars". Don\'t see my self ready any more of the
trilogy. To much US flag waying for my Canadain heart,and I don\'t like the
way the UN is painted as toltarian power-mad group. I got the feel that Mr.
Douglas got the idea for this trilogy (maybe even wrote some of it) before
the fall of the USSR, and tried (badly) to have the UN fill the role of evil
empire in later rewrites.

Well I can not agree with you there (see above)

Here I agree with you, with a little change the setting works for early
solomani space travel (just befor jump drives)

Any spelling mistakes in the above are mine (spell checker will not work for
some reason).

IIRC the actual default setting is quite strong, studies on language
universals done on creoles suggest that the basics settings are things
like, Subject Verb Object is the way to lay out a sentence, single
word negatives, etc.

Basically people who can\'t communicate on a first language basis, find
a way to communicate using a mixture of whatever languages are about.
There descendants than take this basic communication and create a
natural language. Anything missing in the pigeon (the basic
communication) is created by the next generation in the creole (a
natural language). As far as I am aware all Creoles are so alike that
when you move passed the words to the underling structure it suggests
that language and it\'s basic settings are instinctive in the human brain.

In other words leave some non speaking humans somewhere, and they will
create a language and it will follow certain lines.

Please note I haven\'t studied linguistics for six years so current
thinking may be different from the above.

Welcome to Alpha Complex!

That\'s not Traveller...that\'s Paranoia.

It must be all this talk of cloning.

Besides, in my current campaign, the first thing that the PC in charge
of stores did is design lots of requisition forms. I\'m sure one of them
was a writing impliment requisition form (and to get that you had to fill
in the form requisition form.)

GT still rates cargo by volume, but calculates ship performance by mass.
For simplicity, cargo mass is approximated at 5 mass tons per displacement
ton, which may be too low; most commercial designs should also be rated at
their "overload" condition of 20 mass tons per displacement ton of cargo.
(Sometimes it\'s also worthwhile to calculate fueled and unfueled
performance; it can make a significant difference in light, high-Jump
ships.)

On the question of carrying vehicles as cargo, this is one of the few good
results of the detailed GURPS Vehicles design system*; it produces a volume
figure as well as a mass figure.  Vehicles are treated as
"Roll-on/Roll-off" cargo, which takes up twice its actual volume in cargo
space.

* otherwise, Vehicles takes for too much work for the results, and takes up
way too much space in the source books.  IMHO, of course.

Tom Schoene

Vehicles designed with FFS were also designed according to volume first.
Aircraft used mass but then were given a transport volume for carriage on
starships.

A freight ton is also 14 cubic metres, as far as I\'m aware.

A 200-ton (2,800 m3) free trader which was 25% cargo space would have
capacity for 50 tons (700 m3) of cargo.

Most design sequences assume that freight does not exceed 1000km per m3 (the
density of water). It\'s widely assumed that really dense items of freight
are packaged in containers with a lot of waste space to keep the density
below that value.

Nick

I read somewhere (I think it was an issue of Challenge) that if cargoes of
greater than standard density (ie 1 ton per cubic meter) were carried, the
ships performance should be re-calculated if it was likely to take the ships
mass over 15 tons per cubic meter.

Not-so-silly question.

Why would they "float off the deck"?

Seriously, this is *the* single biggest error in damn near every movie,
TV program and even *story* that deals with zero-g. 

If you are in the middle of a compartment in zero g, you\'ll stay there
unless some force pulls or pushes you out of that location. 

But if you are along a wall (or the floor or ceiling) you\'ll *also*
stay right there unless some force moves you. 

Removing gravity *won\'t* make you "float up". But your muscles mighgt
push you off gently.

I wouldn\'t argue that lots of languages are SOV. All I was saying was
that the basic building blocks of language are ingrained as instincts,
and these instincts have been seen to produce languages with
remarkably similar structures, thus reinforcing the theory.

Now if you take these natural languages and apply a couple of thousand
years of language change to them, you might end up with what we have
at the moment. Thousands of different languages with all sorts of
different structures.

No one really knows but then the above is what the field of
Linguistics is all about.

Got me thinking:  Is 20 tonnes per displacement ton the maximum deck
loading?

I remember moving offices and the fit-out manager getting upset because the
fireproof safe used for the computer back-up tapes exceeded the rated
loading for the building floor - a special platform had to be built to
distribute the weight.

Is there an effective limit, or is future tech materials technology so good
that we can assume the deck plates can support anything we can fit in the
hold in a 1G gravity field?

On a vaguely related thread, suppose you drop a huge cargo container onto
you deck plate from a height of a few metres.  How much damage would it do?
Would it screw up the grav plate?  (I ask purely from interest of course, my
character would never actually have done such a thing to her ship...)

Opinions?

You know you\'re hanging around the wrong people when your co-workers agree
that Maslo\'s Heirachy of Needs is Food, Sleep and ISO 9000 compliance.

(go to slashdot, plug in Y2K into the search engine and read Hyde

find a way to bill you. It\'s the promise our lawyers made to us, and it\'s

OK. Imperial bureaucracies. We know there is friction between them, becuase
Imperial Warrants exist to trump any minor issues of protocol, procedures
and who gets to use the slush fund this month.

OK. Time to write out the campaign thats been kicking around for a while.
The High Violence Mercantile Campaign. Think Manga. Think Dr Strangelove.
Think GAO reports.

First the good news. The PCs run one of your classic free traders. Jump-2,
probably armed, probably pretty marginal. There is a tradewar on. And thats
the good news.

The bad news is the trade papers are running a story that the Imperial
Ministry of Commerce just approved a Ling Standard application that
declared the subsectors Free Traders as contributing to the Clear and
Present Overcapacity in the subsector.

In sixty days, the PCs ship will be fair game to anything in LSP\'s colours.

Some time after this, the Ships Purser gets a note that their moprtgage has
been bought, and that the new owner wishes to have a talk to the captain
and crew.

The address they get is in a hotel in the good part of town. Understated.
Natural everything. Butlers with that very discreet badge that indicates an
ex-member of a Imperial Marine Spec Ops unit.

They are very quietly ushered into one of the private suites. The fittings
make the foyer look like a startown bar. The chairs could cover the
downpayment on a brand new Far Trader, and the paintings would cover the rest.

An exteremly relaxed gentleman is lounging on what appears to be a genuine
T\'kami chaise lounge. He leans towards our heroes and says \'Gentlemen. So
pleased you could make it. A drink ?\', and waves towards the wet bar.

Conniseurs would recognise much of the contents of the bar. So would anyone
specialising in low-volume, high value special cargos.

Drinks are drunk.

\'Frankly, business is such a bore. But my people tell me your accounts are
quite a mess. And theres that LSP business. Tell me, gentlemen, do any of
you play cards ? I have a couple of people coming over to my lodge tonight,
and I\'d be honoured if you\'d be there. I can only spare a couple of days.
The MoJ Competition Subcommittee has gone into permanent session, and I
really have to get there, or Bubbles will get antsy. Again.\'.

The interview is clearly over.

Presumably, the next question is who now owns the mortgage, what is the
Competition Subcommittee, and why did all this just happen.

As far as anyone can tell, there is no Competition Subcommitee, and unless
Our Heroes move in very exalted circles, they have absolutely no idea who
Bubbles is.

I guess there is nothing but to enjoy a quiet game of cards.

That makes sense. Which means that they\'d also need water tanks, but that
you could use the steam to produce electrical power if you wanted.

I\'m just quoting from GURPS Vehicles (2nd edition) here. In fact, the
modules are the Orion engine from VE2, just rewritten into Traveller
format.

If you can improve the modules, I\'d welcome the input. (And if you don\'t
have a Pyramid subscription, I\'ll pass it along to the GURPS Space folks
for you, so that you have a chance of getting it used in GURPS Space 3rd
edition. Assuming that you don\'t mind, of course.)

Kodak Pantone colour laser photocopier/printer.

The transfer can\'t show quite as many different brightness levels as a
photograph, but it\'s pretty good. I borrowed a family portrait to make one
for a friend once, and it looked almost identical to the studio print.
FWIW, they also work well on mousepads. (I have a Space 1889 mouse pad that
I made four years ago, and it\'s showing no wear yet.)

If you\'re interested in doing this, we should probably move the logistical
discussions to private email.

Well, other than Cleon the Mad, and Strephon the Clone, the rest of the

the Civil War. They all died not for experimenting with cloning, but
experimenting with crowning themselves Emperor.;-)

Oddly enough, I finally began to figure out GURPS Vehicles this summer.
Amazing what 10 hours at the beach with a book and palmtop can do! GURPS
Vehicles don\'t seem that complicated if all the calculations are done
automatically.

Anyway, I\'ve decided to write GT Infini-V: a GURPS version of Infini-V,
initially aimed at GURPS Traveller but with enough hooks to include other
technologies. This is more complicated than Infini-V, and my work schedule
this semester kinda sucks, so I may not get finished until Christmas. OTOH,
I may well have usable results by Friday, too, if I don\'t hit any snags.

As usual, BITS will have a free downloadable demo available once the
software is ready.

I\'d be tempted to whisper something into my com-link and then stand
there patiently until someone from the ship arrived. At which point I\'d
take the bundle they were carrying, flip thru it, and hand the
bureaucrat some choice forms. Such as "request for permission for
business related data", "request for permision for personal data" (such
as name), "monetary reimbursement forms (with a rate for filling out
paperwork), etc, etc. 

A "properly" written "AI" program can come up with "logical" stuff that
will make even the most hardened bureaucrat cringe.

	I certainly agree that the damage/to hit/ROF balance is
	difficult.  My own bias is to make lasers practical infantry
	weapons (as IMTU they are used by TL 8-9 armies).  This means 
	making them at least as lethal as contemporary slug-throwers.

	True, there is no point in running a battle that is totally
	one-sided.  On the other hand, TL 4 troops would tend to be
	terrified by plasma guns, even if not actually hit.

	Any thoughts on TL changes in howitzers et al?

	This might affect called artillery as well.  Would you include

	Pardon my feeble-mindedness, but I\'m not getting everything 
	in this table.  FP =  Squad Leader firepower per troop?
	DAM = Traveller damage per hit?  I am not familiar with AHL,
	and this may be my problem.  Bottom line: what SL firepower

	Thus, if a squad can keep a LOS on a target, that target

Yah, you\'re missing the point.  You have the equivalent of a strategic nuclear
weapon going off every time a ship lands or takes off, this will destroy the
landing field in a single landing (in fact, it will also tend to destroy the
ship) and destroy the entire port in short order.

Yep.

Under AG you\'re pushing against the floor with enough force to accelerate
you upward at 1 gee, at least momentarily. Unless you can adjust that force
perfectly to match the decrease in AG (which you probably can\'t if it\'s
instantaneous and comes without warning) then you\'ll push yourself off.

Even if it is then it\'s possible to build a specialised cradle to spread the
weight of particularly heavy cargoes. The maximum deck pressure wouldn\'t be
much of a problem for properly packaged and loaded freight, but it could be
if the players are trying to recover a relic grav tank or something....

Well, taking current ships and aircraft as a basis, that\'s would utterly
knacker your floor, probably requiring expensive repairs and maybe even
making a hole. A couple of metres is a long way to fall under 1g. The grav
plate? Well, I\'d say that\'s pretty much up to the GM.

wouldn\'t have thought in some directions at all).

Thanks.

You\'ve been a big help to my game.

I LOVE this freaking list.



RANGE MODS:

Anyway, I\'ve simplified the thoughts, and I\'ve come up with a simple
addition to CT starship combat.

I\'m just adding two different range modifiers to the to hit throw.
These were derived from your comments and the two range modifiers
already printed in the CT rules.

Range to target 5,000 km or closer?     +2 DM

Range to target 2,000 km or closer?      +5 DM



HEX/RANGE BAND SIZE:

For the close ranges in this boarding scenario, I\'ve changed the
hex/range band size to 1,000 km each.



LENGTH OF ROUND:

To coincide with the internal combat going on inside the ships, I\'m
changing the starship combat round for this scenario to a 6 second
round--just like the personal combat round I\'m using.

I\'ll probably run 3-5 rounds inside the ship, then 3-5 rounds outside,
keeping everything constant.



ROF:

Looking at T4\'s Starships book (imagine that!  I used it!), I see that
most lasers on small scale ships have an ROF of 10 (for the 10 minute T4
combat round).  With extra power, those all can easily be boosted to 100
ROF.

Doing the required math, those weapons will fire exactly once per 6
seconds (with the ROF 100 figure).

That\'s perfect.  In this very close range scenario I have, these two
ships carving away at each other should turn out to be a meatgrinder of
an encounter.

That\'s exactly what I want.

Thanks again, to all.

Kenneth.

Oh, certainly, as long as you have ships with both CG and HEPlaR, and only use HEPlaR in space, you\'re fine -- however, standard designs frequently don\'t have contragravity.  HEPlaR is a fast way to commit suicide in any sort of atmosphere, or near the ground.  Incidentally, contragravity is capable of doing directional control without any use of thrust anyway.

Well, every single ship in Brilliant Lances (that\'s all the classic designs)
has contra grav, except for the Lab Ship, Donosev, Chrysanthemum and Aurora.
All those four are unstreamlined, and thus not atmosphere-capable.


I thought CG could only change the magnitude of your gravitational vector
(ie reducing it by up to two orders of magnitude), not affect the direction
of it. If it can affect the vector\'s direction, has it not just become a
thruster plate?

Well, at that particular moment, the bad guys (can\'t remember who they were 
now...Cardassians maybe...)  had just transported aboard and were in the 
process of running around the bridge disarming the crew, shouting at 
people, and generally swaggering a lot (on second thought, maybe they were 
Klingons...).  It seemed to me that chances were good that most of them 
were in the process of taking a step as the gravity shut off, and would 
thus be flung away from the floor.  Even those that were standing perfectly 
still, would still automatically shift their weight when the gravity was 
released and be unable to regain balance quickly enough to avoid falling.

IMHO, this would certainly not work against any Traveller combatants, who 
are routinely trained for Zero-G operations, but remember that these were 
_Star_Trek_ villains... And at least until Star Trek 6, there\'s been almost 
no evidence that anyone in that world could fight in Zero-G.  Well, Spock 
maybe....

Well, it can only get a limited fraction of local gravity perpendicular to gravity.  Contragravity is like a thruster plate, except that it can only be used close to a planet, since its thrust is reduced proportional to the local force of gravity.

The Last Planet was the ***first*** real book I ever read, as well as the
first novel and first science fiction book.  I\'ve always imagined that the
books take place against a multi-millennium long background.  Humans
discover spaceflight by time mining the secret of spacetravel from Foreunner
technology. They start exploring space and colonizing. Eventually they meet
other races and eventually supplant them almost entirely. Over the centuries
the location of Earth is entirely forgotten, though the legend lives on.

If you figure that the stories are generally separated by centuries it\'s
much easier to accept the inconsistancie.

This depends on the game system being used.  In TNE/FF&S, contragravity 
simply reduced the gravitational vector over a specific volume by 99%.  In 
an atmosphere, this might make the ship neutrally or positively buoyant, 
but no thrust is involved - that would be provided by HEPlaR or some other 
engine.

Um...wrong ;)  It provided 10-20% of gravitational force sideways in TNE/FF&S.  In Striker it could provide any amount of sideways force.  I don\'t know about T4 or MT.

In FF&S2, page 18 (gravitic vehicle design sequence):  "Most of the
force is directed parallel to the gravity field (straight up and down),
but a fraction of the lift is available to provide thrust."

This sentence is repeated almost verbatim on page 65, dealing with
thrust agencies.

Under "Reactionless Thrusters" (also page 65, FF&S2): 
"...\'Contragravity\' at earlier tech levels can only interact with the
local gravitational field (and is hence limited to use near a planetary
surface)...."

Hope this helps....

DISCLAIMER - Not an official statement on behalf of BITS, but an explanation:

Some of you writing to us by email may have seen some delay in response
from BITS. Firstly, we aren\'t ignoring you! BITS is run by volunteers, and
at the moment we are pulling together the material for release at GenCon UK
99, preparing to run the trade stand, 3 RPGA tournaments and a number of
demonstrations, and dealing with real life(tm) (imminent fatherhood for
some people, major work projects etc). We only have a small active CORE
<grin> which means that time is being juggled.

At present, we have four books in the last stages of preparation (you\'ve
seen 3 advertised here, ACQ being the fourth) plus three tournaments (which
require nearly the same effort), and we\'re also doing the usual newsletter,
2nd hand material and website...

Hopefully, once GenCon is out of the way things will calm down, and we\'ll
go through the non-urgent mails. if you need to contact someone at BITS
(bits@bits.org.uk) urgently, mark your subject line URGENT, or copy me (for
example). I hope to see some of you in the flesh at GenCon UK 99, maybe for
a drink at the bar, or a game at the stand or the demo area. FWIW we are
actually in two locations this year - in the trade hall, and running demos
in the balcony above (GURPS Traveller & T4 as the standards, but I\'m sure
we\'ll get volunteers for CT, MT and TNE as ever). As ever, we\'re happy for
anyone who wants to volunteer to try their hand at running a game/demo.

All the best,

Trebuchets keep a cup fixed to the end of the arm, and the cup remains open.

Staff slings: the sling\'s cup is attached by two lines (3-4 feet long is
good). One of these is fixed to the pole near the end. The other string is
terminated in a loop small enough not to fall past the first one\'s
fixation, but loose enough to fall off if you point the tip down. The start
position is with the staff parrallel tothe deck tip behind you, with a
loaded pocket.Generally, you then (rapidly) bring forward the staff til it
is roughly 45 degrees from parallel in front of you. The second loop lets
go normally about when you stop the swing, but the cup is lagging. When the
string lets go, several things happen, including putting a spin on the
projectile, converting that rotational velocity into linear velocity, and
also opening up the cup to actually let the projectile go.

The thing can be used while kneeling (I\'ve done it). In a Short trench, two
guys could work it easily.

Oh, and just for reference, a golf ball can occasionally be sent  over 200
m in flat terrain by a practiced stafslinger.

Auditors: IMTU I have used Barrayaran style auditors since I read about
imperial warrants... well before I read anything by Bujold. I allow sector
and arch dukes to issue similar warrants for their own turf, including all
vassal held lands. I use two warrants: The "Bring all force to bear to aid
the bearer" and the "you can\'t arrest this man, and if you do, and the duke
finds out, you WILL be shot". Auditors tend to hide their warrants unless
absolutely needed. And yes, most of them seem as ... uhmm.... barely safe
from themselves as Miles vorKosigan.

Likewise, russian has no truly "Proper" sentence ordering except that
depdendant clauses follow the main clause. It is not uncommon in literature
(altho in speach it tends to be Suj Verb Object) to find any combination of
SVO, SOV, OSV OVS, VOS, OSO, etc. used to slow the reader down or to make
rhymes. Since word declesion usually sets subject and object apart (russian
declension affects almost everything in the sentence).

That was my understanding as well.

However, I just picked up Hard Times and read that Strephon refused to be
tested by IRIS to confirm if he really was the Emperor.  After he refused,
IRIS publicly stated that "Strephon" wasn\'t a contender and backed Margaret
as the highest ranking noble eligible for the Iridium Throne.  Despite the
fact that IRIS holds no significant power during the Rebellion, it has to
be PR that is extremely damaging to Strephon\'s cause.

If he was the real Strephon, why the heck didn\'t he go along with the test?
 Was this written up anywhere else?

I\'m looking for a couple of items of information. First I\'d like to find
out if Guy Garnett is still ghosting the list or if anyone has a current

The second item I\'d like some information on is a group calling itself
the Aoreriyya Project. I have no names for any of the members.

Now the reason... I recently received a copy of the boxed edition of
Brilliant Lances thru an ebay auction. As a bonus there was a typed
manuscript tittled "Gralyn: One Small Jump:. The manuscript is the
"playtest edition" of the players section for what looks to be a
complete source book for a pocket empire adventure in TNE!

Now I admit that my knowledge of TNE is shakey but I haven\'t seen any
references to this manuscript ever having seen print. I\'d really like to
contact the authors!

IF any of this is familiar to anyone please contact me off list at the

My mistake. My info comes from watching the a documentary about mad
englishman whouses the one he\'s built to fling used automobiles about 
his property. On that one, the car is attaches to a sling that works
just as you\'ve described. (fortunately! one of the launches he did for
the camera crew involved a lit 5 gallon can of gasoline ;-)

Yes, his wife thinks hes certifiable, and really wishes her husband
would find a safer hobby. Him, well, he just wants to build a _bigger_
one ;-)

You\'re thinking of FF&S2 (a T4 product).  In FF&S1 it cancels over 99% of weight but 
thrust agencies of some sort still have to be applied to move anywhere.

From the RCEG under the description of the grav belt:

"...contra-grav technology is not a thrust generator, but rather creates
a field within which gravity vectors are 99% negated..."

and from FF&S1 itself, pg.25:

"Grav and air cushion vehicles also require thrust, as their suspensions 
serve only to hold them up, not move them forward."

Ugh.  Having worked for the California State Government, I know exactly how
that would be handled.

"Thank you very much for the forms.  A state employee will take care of
this as soon as possible.  Please have a seat and we will get you the
completed forms as soon as possible."

Then the form would be placed in a large pile of papers and never be seen
or remembered again.

Actually, many Trebuchets used precisely a staff-sling arrangement of a 
soft sling attached at both ends to the arm.  One end was fixed to the arm 
while the other one was rigged to release at the top of the arm\'s swing.

However, a staff-sling isn\'t really a human-powered trebuchet, since by 
definition, a trebuchet uses a counterweight as an energy source.  (I think 
the word trebuchet actually has something to do it in some language.  My 
reference books are all in boxes right now...).

For a decent discussion of Trebuchets you can look in Payne-Galloway\'s "The

I don\'t think that\'d be practical. But since you are generating steam
with the waste heat *anyway, you could add a multi *gigawatt* steam
calliope to the ship. 

High notes shatter *steel* miles away. Low notes induce earthquakes a
continent away. :-)

Not quite. 

Human powered trebuchets (aka "traction trebuchets") did exist. Instead
of a counterweight you had a *whole bunch* of people pulling in unision
on a set of ropes. 

The local SCA group has a three man traction trebuchet they use in SCA
"wars". It\'ll lob whole *baskets of "fuzzy green death" (tennis balls

Check out the "yeild" of a Saturn V or the Space Shuttle. 

You *can* handle that sort of thing. It just takes "a little
engineering". After all, if an Orion drive is possible, so are
facilties that can survive a HEPlaR landing and takeoff. You just need
*lots* of water for the "deluge" spray on the exhaust deflectors.

Someone mentioned that playing Grav Pong with boarders would damage one\'s
own ship by throwing around the cargo, furniture and ship\'s vehicles. 
This is only the case if one assumes that small individual grav plates
can\'t be manipulated.  I would rule that the plate at the end of the hall
on a scout/courier could be turned up or down without affecting the
staterooms to either side.  Certainly the air/raft bay would be fine.  So
you could pong intruders up and down the hall while your crewmates stayed
comfy in their rooms.  The lounge furniture might get wrecked, though...
:-)

IMTU, you have to disable the plant to board effectively (just to wave
cannon around indiscriminately, that\'s mentioned in HG). Boarding actions
are usually in the dark (or by emergency lighting, flare light or some
such).  I agree with a previous poster that a grav belt should be able to
keep you in place.  You just need to hook it to an inertial compass and
program an autopilot to only allow movement you input.  I still think you
could be made quite nauseous/ineffective in such a situation though, with
several g pulling you in various directions, up and down changing second
by second...yuck!  Much better to zap the plant (if you can get close
enough to board, you\'re close enough to blow up the plant!).

Real world data point. 

Some years back, I was working graveyard shift at a plant not far fron
one of the cargo terminals on the waterfront. Due to the wayt bus
schedules worked out, I caught a bus from home to a place about a mile
from the plant, and had dinner (breakfast) at a burger joint while
waiting for the bus I\'d transfer too. 

One night, I was sitting there eating my burger when there was this
*enourmous* crash. A semi had stopped at the light and had a slight
"accident" when starting back up. 

Instead of a regular trailer, he had a "long" cargo container. These
are often fitted so you can "snap on" a set of wheels at the rear and
the "mounting" hardware for the fifth wheel at the front.

This one had been set up that way, but something had gone wrong. The
rear wheels had come loose (I think the brakes must have stayed locked
when he started up again, because they wound up sitting in the street
*upside down*). 

So the rear of the container had fallen about a meter and a half (while
the front half remained supported). It gouged the pavement some. It
also *bent* so abnout the last third was flat on the pavement, with the
rest angling up to the fifth wheel. 

So dropping a container from a couple of meters may or may not damage
the deck. But it\'ll *definitely* mangle the container.

Well, I\'m a tad slower than that.  it took me a full weekend to properly
spreadsheet just the gun design system.  That\'s too much work for a
non-gearhead, liberal-arts major like myself.  The GT starship design
system is about my speed.

I regard the space issue as a bigger problem.  I don\'t need all the design
nuts and bolts spelled out in the final text of a non-Vehicles supplement. 
I\'d be perfectly happy with short descriptions that include key 
performance data, electronics and other key systems, and armor/hit point
values.  I don\'t need the nitty gritty on how it was designed to use it in
a game.    

Perhaps future GT books can use the compact format being worked up for the
Vehicle Companion.  Based on the current books, this could free three or
four pages for, IMO, higher-value content.

That\'s just one man\'s opinion.

Saturn V: 30 million newtons of thrust at 2800 meters/second = 20 tons/second.
Free Trader: 10 million newtons of thrust at 20,000 kilometers/second = 50 kt/second.

That\'s 2,500 times more dangerous....

I fear that you may be somewhat in error.  Your classic  trebuchet did not
have a cup but a sling.  What you are describing in the arm of a classic
catapulta which was powered by a tightly twisted band of cord.  Maiden\'s
hair was the legended fiber of choice.  There are several 16th century
illustrations of trebuchets by Rampauli (sic) which are as you describe
however they are quite clearly post its general use on the battle field.
Check out Payne Galloway\'s research on the subject, while ancillary to his
main interest it is still quite interesting though late Victorian or early
Edwardian (I forget exactly when she passed beyond the pale).   In the last
15 years or so there were several articles in Scientific American some of
which provide quite excellent information on the classic trebuchet.  I have
a photo copy of one of them about some where.  Mad Englishmen having jolly
fun launching a small Brit auto, sans engine I believe.  You might be
interested to know that while the trebuchet was the biggest projectile
launcher on the pre and even some what post gun powder battle field there
was a smaller non-gravity arm, traction arm version using the combined
pulling efforts of men.  Both of the versions of the trebuchet I have
described have been recreated by SCA members.  the Grey Company down under
has a web page devoted to the trebuchet which you might find interesting as
well.

If anyone is truly intersted I will dig through my library and give them
several book cites re siege weapons in general and the trebuchet in
particular.

I later saw that 1dton of spacedock equals 1/2dt space craft. This will

The last three Emperors/Empresses before the Civil War took the throne by
assassination:  
Cleon IV whacked Nicholle
Jerome whacked Cleon IV
Jaqueline whacked Jerome.

Olav was just following tradition when he whacked Jaqueline.

I doubt any of them were hit because of cloning experiments - there are
plenty of good reasons for grabbing the throne without it.

And by the way:  Cleon the Third was "Cleon the Mad".  I tend to think of
Cleon the Fourth as "Cleon the Bad" - a non-dynastic usurper and all-round
disreputable character.  Of course that raises the question of "Cleon the
Dangerous to Know"...

It as because Strephon didn\'t much trust or believe IRIS, seeing them as
only a bunch of opportunists angling to be the power behind the throne.
That is mentioned in Survival Margin.

I\'m fairly sure that this is a FF&S2 thing, as the grav belts in the
RCES equipment book have ducted fans for thrust, which they won\'t
need if you can get thrust from the CG system. It\'s helicopters, etc
that get 10% of their lift in \'free\' thrust.

The same thing is said in _Survival Margin_, and in his personal diary
he says something about it, but I can\'t remember (and my stuff is still
in boxes) whether he won\'t allow the tests because they\'ll show that
he\'s _been_ cloned, or that he _is_ a clone.

A USL ship can land in an atmosphere with CG, provided the bracings are
adequate (ie it is stressed to take local gravity). In most cases this is
probably the case as the ship can take accn from the drives.

CG means it can float down real slow.

See Survival Margin - he refused the test as he was sickened by the
destruction his policies had caused (the death of those he loved, the
mistake of making Dulinor ArchDuke, the destruction in Dagudashag and
Gushemege Sectors resulting from his declaration of existance post
assassination). That\'s why he sends Avery to the Marches, which is the last
vestige of what he wanted to build. ISTR that the Regency Sourcebook and
Arrival Vengeance have some more on this topic.

HT is the best ever Traveller supplement and background, IMO. I think that
it has more of a feeling of hope, of turning back the tide, than TNE did.
There are opportunities for the players to do something that matters, to be
heroes or villains. The fact that Virus snuffs out these efforts just
heightens the candles against the night feel.

I\'d rate it up with: High Guard, The Traveller Adventure, Milieu 0
Campaign, the Regency Sourcebook, and GT: Far Trader. (*)

(*) DGP excluded as we don\'t talk about that anymore. ;-)

Very similiar, except the Achuultani were being used by a psychotic sentient
computer system and are unaware that they are slaves to it.  Captured
achuultani eventually become friendly when outside the influence of their
computer systems.

I spent most of the trip above 10,000 feet (that\'s what 3,000 meters? 
There really isn\'t much oxygen there, especially when one has been

thin atmosphere (see, there\'s an ob Traveller in everything).  We were
also carrying fairly heavy loads (about 1/3 of our body weight), so I
could feel the effects of encumbrance, too.  I definitely couldn\'t do
things at altitude with a pack that I could do at sea level without a
pack.  

We also climbed Mt. Goddard (13,500+ feet; class 2), where we found rope
and webbing leading off the mountainside to something that we couldn\'t
get close enough to see because of the slope (and our lack of gear; it
was after all only a class 2 peak).  From below, through a small
telescope (15x) it looked like a white outline of a human form, upside
down, and very symmetrical.  A ranger later told us it was wreckage from
a plane crash in December, and "they" (he didn\'t specify who) would be
coming to recover that item over Labor Day weekend.  The proximity to
Area 51 made me a little suspicious, of course.

Anyway, I hope everyone has had a week half as good as mine.

As I recall from my reading of _Survival Margin_, Strephon was a ruler with
an abundance of conscience - perhaps an overabundance.  By the time IRIS
dropped by, he had given up any hope of his faction being able to retake
control of the Imperium and had fallen into despair over the sheer number
of people, HIS PEOPLE, who had died.

He deliberately let himself be thought an imposter so that at least no one
else would die in HIS name.  (There wasn\'t anything he could do about all
the others.)  As to why he didn\'t just surrender his faction... perhaps he
felt an Emperor should not surrender, or feared that Lucan et al wouldn\'t
LET him survive as a threat, and would spend more lives getting to him.

Good-hearted people usually get the short end in wars.

I\'d agree with Dom\'s view of HT at least, though not with the rest of his list.
HT is a far more interesting milieu (for me, he says hastily) than TNE. There\'s
no feeling of material withheld, or being railroaded down a specific plotline.

For the rest of the list:

A huge amount of CT is excellent - all of the books, most of the adventures,
all of the alien modules, and some of the supplements, as well as the material
from FASA, Gamelords and Paranoia Press.

For MT Knightfall is also pretty good (though the most of the best MT material
was published by DGP).

For TNE, um, Regency Sourcebook and, depending how you count it as MT or TNE,
Survival Margin, though it\'s more of a spin-off novel than a supplement.

It\'s too early to really evaluate GT against these as yet, I think.

    'body' => 'I am always interested in conceptual tools that will give me a better
handle on aliens in a campaign. When my wife, Monkey Girl, mentioned a
principle of evolutionary theory I hadn\'t heard before, I realized that it
has implications for Traveller. Herewith is my understanding of what she said:

"Complete co-competitors cannot co-exist." (C4, for short.)

First, some definitions:

Competitors: depend on the same, limited resource.
Co-competitors: compete within the same ecological niche.
Complete co-competitors: compete for all and only the same, limited
resources within the same niche.

So, all animals that eat field mice are competitors (for field mice, a
limited resource). All ground animals that eat field mice are
co-competitors. Two ground animals that both subsist solely on field mice
would be complete co-competitors.

The C4 principle is a restatement or corollary of "survival of the
fittest": if two species try to inhabit exactly the same ecological niche,
one will prove to be better at it and drive the other out (either literally
or through greater reproduction).

There are basically three ways to resolve such a conflict:

(1) The species remain geographically distinct. This probably only lasts
when there is some kind of barrier between them, like a river or mountain
range.  The barrier can be as seemingly insignificant as a 3 degree
temperature difference.

(2) The species diverge into distinct niches -- nocturnal vs. diurnal,
ground vs. arboreal, etc.  The differentiation can also be the adoption of
other resources -- one becomes an omnivore instead of a strict carnivore, etc.

(3) If possible, the "species" interbreed until they are indistinguishable
(this may be happening with coyotes and wild dogs in the eastern US). 

The resolution, whatever form it takes, rarely requires more than 10
generations to reach.

A secondary principle that relates to this discussion is the idea that
species will change rather than die out. Put a species under stress and
most of the time one of its weird fringe populations will prove adaptable
to the new circumstances. That will be the version of the species that
survives the stress. This is how the 2d solution occurs.


So what has this got to do with aliens? Suppose that "interstellar
technological civilization" is a niche. The C4 idea implies that you will
not have a peaceful, egalitarian coexistance. Within about 10 generations
of first contact some other kind of accommodation would be reached. Either:

(1) Each species would maintain its own, distinct territory. This is the
situation among the major races in Traveller (except the Droyne; see next).

(2) Each species would adapt to specific (good word!) roles, perhaps even
become castes of a sort. This is the fate of most minor races in Traveller,
and most major-race exclaves in other states: Bwaps as diplomats, Dolphins
as fish-herds and wet-navy scouts, etc.

(3) Where possible, as in the case of long-separated populations descended
from the same species, the species would intermix until there is no
noticeable difference left. This is very probably the fate of most Human
races in Traveller, minor or major: remain isolated (like the Zhodani) or
be assimilated (like the Vilani and Solomani).


It is possible to read too much into this idea, and use it as a
rationalization for racism (among other abuses). I am not suggesting that
biology is destiny, especially for social and economic creatures like
Humans. However, I do believe that biology is a force to be recognized. The
more "alien" the aliens, and the less able we are to understand and trade
with them, the more important I believe it will be.


*Disclaimer:  I am not a biological anthropologist; my wife is. Any
distortions or oversimplifications of theory are strictly my own -- so deal
with it.*

I\'ve got a PC hanging by the handgrip of the airlock ON THE OUTSIDE of
the bad guy ship.

The bad guy ship just slammed on full thrust.  It\'s moving from an
all-stop position to 3G acceleration.

So, my questions are--

1)  Inertia.

There are no inertial dampers outside the bad guy ship.  What will
happen to the PC as he holds onto the bar?  Can he withstand the force
of the ship moving and ride on the outside of the thing?  Or will the
ship leave him floating in its wake?



2)  Radiation.

If the PC is left floating (or if he lets go and does not travel with
the ship), what happens when a person in a vacc suit veers too close to
the wrong end of a T-plate?  Those things glow blue with the ionization
(I use the DGP style of T-plates in my campaign).  Will that radiation
fry anyone who comes to close to it?

If so, how close does one have to get to the T-plates in order to take
damage?

What kind of damage (how many D) would you put on a PC in that kind of
raditiation?

I love the concept.  In the kinds of total war of the Rebellion (\'to the last
man\' and that nonsense), it\'s useful for me to figure out what all is happening
on a planet you\'re dealing with.  <grin>  The current time IMTU is 1124, just
before the effects of HT start hitting.  <evil grin>

Thing about IRIS was, it was just a bunch of covert ops types trying to be
kingmakers.  There never really *was* an IRIS.  It was all smoke and mirrors.

This brings up an interesting question: why can\'t an USL ship land in an 
atmosphere?  Considering the fact that some of them have 6G of thrust, a 
mere 1G of gravity shouldn\'t bother them (of course, if it\'s the AG that 
provides some of the structural strength, then you\'d need to keep that on).

As for the atmosphere itself, that\'s only an issue if you do a fast, TL7 
spacecraft style landing.  Given either CG or Thruster Plates/Reactionless 
thrusters, it should be possible for a ship to take a few hours to _slowly_ 
come down through the atmosphere and land gently.  Same on takeoff.

Admittedly, this wouldn\'t work for warships, but a large cargo hauler can 
take it\'s time going up and down.  The slight increase in costs for extra 
time would be more than made up by no longer using interface craft.

Am I overlooking something?  Is this in a faq somewhere?  Or is this an 
acknowledged hole in Traveller?

Two questions--

different?



2)  What kind of throw should I impose on the PCs as they try to work in

For MT there are two implicit ceilings, a) the maximum number of levels
(int+edu) for all skills and b) the maximum useful skill level (7).

There is at least one experience system I know of for CT (the one published by
Andy Slack as part of his Expanding Universe series, and available from his
website). 

The easiest, most usable systems I came up with, and have used in
practice were as follows:

Under CT:
- - player nominates a notional "career" which they will continue in for the
purposes of development. It may not necessarily be the same as their pre-game
career.
- - each game-year the player makes a skill roll against the appropriate
chargen tables for their notional career. If they are rolling against
different tables than their original career they get -2 modifier.
- - if they make the skill roll they roll for the skill in the appropriate
tables.
- - player gets max one skill per game year.
- - later revision of it had the skill roll (in secret, by the ref) at the start
of the year so that the ref could build any resulting character development into
the game (OK we weren\'t very sophisticated).

Later system, under MT:
- - each time a player makes a critical success role (5 or more than required)
they get a point against that skill.
- - when their skill points = their current skill level +7 they get a skills
roll. They need to roll > their current skill level + 6, modified by int
- - skill point can alternatively be used as a "discount" against Instruction.
- - practice attempts are allowed - ie a routine task involving a particular
skill, duration 4 days. Effectively this only allows practice during jump,
unless you\'re characters are completely sedentary. If they get 5 or better
modified against the task, this counts as a point.

The second requires book-keeping, unlike the first, but works better so long as
you use a dice-based system (ie roll tasks rather than resolve through
adjudication).

Young characters are however still at a disadvantage against pre-experienced
characters - reason being that pre-experienced characters can develop UPP stats
as well as skills, especially in mustering out.

Note also that it is usually (and should be) quicker to gain skills under
Instruction then via experience, post-Mercenary.

Well, you *don\'t* want them on every planet in the galaxy.  Everybody would
head for a cave and take their chances.  Hey, you either die or live *forever*.
 A nice quiet lowtech planet way off the regular lanes would be better.  And
the legend would be a *local* one.

Also, if they move *too* fast, they can chase down a host and attack them
before they have the chance to get away.  Speed .5 gives a victim the chance
to get away.

One of my F2F characters aged over 5 years.  Fun guy; a merchant prince style 
character developed and run *way* before Merchant Princes came out.  He ended 
up a convicted felon, sentenced to become \'governor\' of a newly developed 
colony in the Spinward Marches.  Problem was, he had to see his parole 
officer 2 parsecs away every 3 months, which tended to keep him out of *too* 
much trouble...

"Yep, he\'s the real Strephon, all right. Pass me the lethal dose of
tranquilizer so we can eliminate him, as per Dulinor\'s orders."

Not canon, but a possibility... Strephon may have been paranoid enough
to suspect Dulinor\'s (or Lucan\'s) influence everywhere. (Just a thought.)

Heaven forbid I should defend Star Trek, a sci-fi setting which is
constantly criticized for its lack of scientific accuracy in this venue.
But....

This technique was mention multiple times in the STNG series.  It was used
several times, once just as you suggest, when the Doctor, (not Crusher, the
other one), developed a degenerative aging disease after being exposed to
some genetically engineered children.

Why isn\'t it used to keep everyone eternally young?  Why doesn\'t the
Federation use money? It\'s a social decision. Perhaps people in the Star
Trek twenty fourth century feel that you should live your life in it\'s
natural span and not attempt to extend it forever. Perhaps transporters are
so horribly expensive that only Star Fleet has access to them, and they
won\'t authorize their use for this purpose.  Perhaps the transporter
malfunction was irreproducible.

I would recommend both the book the Physics of Star Trek and the Star Trek
Interactive Tech Manual. The first explains where the series attempted to be
accurate and where it deliberately fiddled with the laws of physics for
dramatic effect.  The second paints the Star Trek universe in a very self
consistent way.  This series had excellent scientific advisors. When they
ignored the science (handwaved it if you will) it generally was for the
purpose of making the story better. Certainly no one on this list would
fiddle with the laws of physics, just to make their game better. ;^)

Actually, it\'s because Strephon knew that IRIS were a complete
fabrication not a legit organization, probably formed to try
and push themselves as a power behind the next throne, or an intel
scoop by Margaret\'s forces trying to make her the next "legitimate"
emperess.

A rather interesting relevation that was...

You may or may not call this good. However, canon is that the "Strephon"

Ah, yes.  Formerly known as "TNE-Pocket" or the tne-pocket@ocf.berkeley.edu
mailing list... we were semi-officially licensed by GDW to take a
corner of Reaver\'s Deep and develop it into some pocket empires
for TNE.  Project died when GDW died.  Guy\'s idea, and I ran the
mailing list.  [Wow, this takes me back, we\'re talking like 92 and 93 8-]

Yep.  That was the intended first major project...
I didn\'t directly have anything to do with the Gralyn part.
Those that did are probably still on TML or locatable...

I thought the archive would be DOA now and I\'d have to recreate it somewhere,

The list of participants (people who posted messages, not sorted
by volume of content or anything else, is at:

Not everything is there, but lots of it is.

Why would you use *water* for this purpose?  Why not freon?  And besides,

Still, it would be interesting to see a group of PCs\' faces when they see an 
Orion launch into orbit and park next to them.  <grin>

After rereading Survival Margin, I would have to agree that this analysis
is the one that made the most sense to me.

I can\'t believe that I forgot about the listing in Survial Margin.  I mean,
SM is probably one of the coolest books for Traveller, IMHO.

They only *suspect* that Cleon IV put the hit out on Nicholle.  Nobody ever 
proved it one way or another and lived to tell about it.  Remind you of 
somebody?  <grin>

I would prefer to utilize a lot of spin grav constructs IMTU, as I think of
gravitics as being way ultratech. Do you have any further ideas on this? As
in what diameter would be ideal, overkill, unfeasible, etc.? The results of
smaller diameters and how to compensate? Perhaps alternate shifts, nobody
living on the station?

You two are talking different pseudo-sciences.  <g> Nick, you are
correct for TNE CG and for GURPS Vehicles CG, too.  CG doesn\'t
doesn\'t produce thrust, simply negates gravitational attraction by
some amount (up to 99% for TNE).  CG in MT, T4 and maybe GT (I
haven\'t checked the book) can produce directional thrust.  It can
IMTU, too.  <g>

I haven\'t seen a truly LONG range scout yet.  Jump-6 with a long endurance.
The ones in CT are Jump-4.  The Book 2 rules allow for a Jump-6 100dT scout,
but none of the later rules make it possible.  Perhaps one with a new
silhouette?

After reading Hard Times years after it came out, I had the exact same
reaction.  I wish I got this book years ago.

The Short Dusk of Hard Times is a far more interesting setting than what is
presented by the Reformation Coalition/Regency setting, IMHO.  HT took a
shooting war game (which doesn\'t really appeal to me except in a "metagame"
concept) and made it something I could use with my players in many
different directions.  I never really disliked TNE, but after seeing Hard
Times vaporized by the Virus I am starting to get irked.  Hmmm... I think
this is how TNE haters are born. :)

It was left open for "interpretation." <g>

One possible interpretation is that the surviving Strephon was not the original
one, but that\'s not the only reason he might have refused IRIS\' test.  

In HT, I believe, Strephon writes that he\'s never heard of IRIS...and where
else is IRIS ever written about? So, maybe IRIS was a fiction invented by
Margaret\'s supporters for the sole purpose of eliminating all other
contenders. If so, Strephon would have been foolish to walk into the trap that
the test presented.

I always saw it as a "Are you still a drunk?" sort of thing. If you say "No"
then it\'s "Ah ha! He admits he used to be a drunk.", if you say "Yes", it\'s
"He admits he\'s still a drunk", and if you won\'t answer, it\'s "He doesn\'t deny
that he is a drunk."

More ships along the lines of the one that looks like a Square rigged Man 
O\' War...  (can\'t recall the name right now...)

Dunno how much of this you have already (I\'ve only looked at 101 
briefly...) But I\'d love to see more versions of existing ships, competing 
designs so to speak.  Surely the Empress Marava isn\'t the only Far Trader 
out there... (note that this applies to civilian ships much more than to 
standardized naval vessels)...

MT uses same basic features as striker. Same results for CG thrust.

  I just read an otherwise somewhat disappointing C.J. Cherryh novel,
"Rimrunners", in which the heroine spends no small amount of time at
various points trying to avoid being squished flat while aboard ships
prone to pulling heavy G\'s at short notice - in a universe that doesn\'t
tolerate G-compensators :)

  The character recalls the internal structure of one of the big Earth
Company battle-rider carriers, and how even with all sorts of side bays 
and safety clip points they once ended up incurring hundreds of dead when
they had to pull max G\'s at only a few seconds notice - probably suddenly 
enough even for many well-drilled individuals.

Holding on: simple... if he can hold on when somebody suddenly tripples his

I took the reference in Survival Margin as a (petty) jab by Nielsen at the canon
that Charles Gannon was building up in HT and elsewhere. IRIS was Gannon\'s
invention.

Whatever, if you look at the TNS reports in Challenge and Survival Margin it
becomes clear that IRIS is converging with Margaret & Tukera. Naively so, since
the Vermene are stronger and less scrupulous and likely to wipe IRIS out.
It\'s possible Strephon assumed that any screening he underwent would lay
himself open to a suicide attacker.

IRIS seems to raise strong feelings pro and con. But if you look at, say, the
Soviet Union after Stalin\'s death you get all these minor agencies coming out
of the woodwork, with overlapping and competing missions, and my take is that
IRIS plays really well as part of the war of succession ambience.

As for Strephon, at the time the various revelations were coming out about what
TNE was going to be, I was working my players through a plot which was to
conclude in the discovery of a deactivated "other Strephon" being discovered in
a captured Hiver ship heading back towards Hiver space. Sigh. Unfortunately TNE
pretty much killed our campaign.

I\'d personally like to see TNE declared a second variant timeline and the
primary timeline restart at the end of HT, without Virus. But I guess there are
so many possibilities in earlier milieu that the issue is anyway (no pun
intended) moot.

I\'ve come up with.

(Again, I\'m using CT rules with a few modifications from MT and T4.  I
expect you could use this experience system with any of those
systems--maybe even GT or TNE too).



KEN\'S ALMOST-A-DONE-DEAL-WORK-IN-PROGRESS EXPERIENCE SYSTEM FOR
TRAVELLER



1:  EXPERIENCE AWARDS

At the end of each gaming session, the ref looks at what the PCs did and
awards experience points.  Points are awarded to those skills (used in
the game) which had an impact on the night\'s game session.  Ref\'s
discretion on this, but the player is welcome to point out where he
thinks his character excelled.

Normal award is 1 point per skill.  On rare occasions, the GM may award
2 or 3 points to a particular skill.  The skill being awarded need not
be one that the PC already has.  If the PC threw (taking the appropriate
negatives) on a skill he doesn\'t have, he can try to gain the skill by
experience (in this case, write the skill on the character\'s sheet in
parentheses).

Points can also be awarded for good role playing or great ideas during
the session.  In this case, the player is allowed to apply these points
to whatever skill he wishes, even if it wasn\'t used during the session
(rewarding players for good play and allowing them to direct the
improvement of their characters).

Experience points are notated next to the appropriate skills.



2:  PREREQUISITE POINTS

At the beginning of each session, players are allowed to attempt to
improve their characters.  Skills that have earned enough experience
points can be thrown on for improvement.

In order to throw for improvement on a skill, the skill must have earned
experience points equal to the next skill level.

Ex:  Going from Pistol-0 to Pistol-1?  You need 1 XP.

Ex:  Going from Pilot-4 to Pilot-5?  You need 5 XP.



3:  THROW FOR IMPROVEMENT

You throw a number of dice equal to the new level.  You can attempt a
throw on a skill only once per game session, but you can throw on as
many eligible skills as you like.

Ex:  Trying to go from Pistol-0 to Pistol-1?  You will throw 1D.

Ex:  Trying to go from Pilot-4 to Pilot-5?  You will throw 5D.



4:  SUCCESS ON THE THROW

When a throw is successful, the skill is improved to the new level.
Success occurs when all 6s are thrown.

Ex:  Pistol-0 to Pistol-1?  You must throw a 6 on 1D  (about a 17%
chance).

Ex:  Pilot-4 to Pilot-5?  You must throw five 6s on 5D  (about a .01%
chance).



5:  BONUSES

If INT is 5-9, you get a +1DM on the throw.

If INT is 10-14, you get a +2DM on the throw.

If INT is 15, you get a +3DM on the throw.

Ex:  On the Pistol throw above, you could succeed on a 5 or 6 if you had
INT 7.

Ex:  On the Pilot throw above, you could succeed on a total of 28 if you
had INT 13.


- ----


You can also get a bonus by having additional experience points.  Double
the amount of points required nets you a +1DM on the throw.  Triple the
amount of points required gets you a +2DM on the throw, and so on.



6:  COST OF TRYING

Every time you attempt to increase your skill and fail, it costs you 1
XP from that skill, but you keep the rest of the points (so you can try
again at the beginning of next session--provided you have enough XP to
try).

If you improve a level, all experience under that skill are spent.  You
start anew with the new skill level sans any XP.



7:  EXPERIENCE LIMIT

I use a modification of the MT rule that says a PC\'s total skill levels
cannot exceed the sum of his INT and EDU.

If total skill levels do not exceed that sum, prerequisite points remain
as stated above.

If total skill levels exceed the sum but are not more than twice the
PC\'s INT + EDU, prerequisite points are doubled (so are the bonus points
mentioned above).


- ----


Ex:  PC has INT 7 and EDU 7, but he has 15 levels in skills currently.
He can still improve, but he improves at a slower rate.  To improve his
Pistol-0 to Pistol-1, it will take 2 XP instead of 1.  To improve his
Pilot-4 to Pilot-5, it will take 10 XP instead of 5.

Ex:  Remember the amount of bonuses are doubled too.  To get a +1DM on
his Pistol throw, he will need 4 XP instead of 2.  To get a +2 DM on his
Pilot throw, he will need 30 XP instead of 10.

INT bonuses remain the same as stated above.


- ----


If total skill levels exceed the sum of INT and EDU by more than twice
but not more than three times the sum, the prerequisite cost is
tripled...and so on...


BECAUSE of this limit (well...call it slowing down in the amount you
learn), players should be choosy about what they attempt to improve.
There will be cases where a player will not try to improve a skill
eventhough he has earned enough points.  Like real life, potential is
there, but the person is not applying himself in that direction.



Well, how\'d I do this time?  Like the experience system?

Um...wrong ;)  It provided 10-20% of gravitational force sideways in
TNE/FF&S.  In Striker it could provide any amount of sideways force.  I
don\'t know about T4 or MT.

Actually in both FFS1 and the Brilliant Lances Technical Manual it states
"...CG lifters do not provide thrust and so cannot physically lift the ship.
Instead, they neutralize most of the gravitational attraction of the world
(approximately 99% of gravitational force beyond which power use becomes
prohibitive).

it is the next section which caused the problem "...This combined with
atmospheric pressure, will provide buoyancy in very dense atmospheres, and
so allow the craft to float at low altitudes.

Eg a ship with a mass of 1,000 tons in a 1G field (Earth) will weigh 1,000
tons with CG lifters off and 10 tons with them on. It would therefore still
fall to Earth unless countered by  some other vector producing agency such
as HEPlaR, Chemical rocket etc. It may be able to float in dense
atmospheres, anyone  want to try and work out how dense for say the type S
scout? Also would inertia in such a case mean the planet will gently revolve
leaving the ship behind?

HT is the best ever Traveller supplement and background, IMO. I think that
it has more of a feeling of hope, of turning back the tide, than TNE did.
There are opportunities for the players to do something that matters, to be
heroes or villains. The fact that Virus snuffs out these efforts just
heightens the candles against the night feel.

I\'d rate it up with: High Guard, The Traveller Adventure, Milieu 0
Campaign, the Regency Sourcebook, and GT: Far Trader. (*)

That was my understanding as well.

However, I just picked up Hard Times and read that Strephon refused to be
tested by IRIS to confirm if he really was the Emperor.  After he refused,
IRIS publicly stated that "Strephon" wasn\'t a contender and backed Margaret
as the highest ranking noble eligible for the Iridium Throne.  Despite the
fact that IRIS holds no significant power during the Rebellion, it has to
be PR that is extremely damaging to Strephon\'s cause.

If he was the real Strephon, why the heck didn\'t he go along with the test?
 Was this written up anywhere else?

Thats also in Survival Margin,  they way I read it, once Strephon saw the
way the war was going he was a broken man, and used IRIS to remove himself
as a contender to minimise any further deaths in his region - looks like it
failed anyway.

I don\'t see it that way.  He refused to be tested by them because he *knew* 
they were frauds.  That they would \'prove\' he wasn\'t the \'real\' Strephon is a 
given.  Since he\'d never had to deal with them to become Emperor after Paulo 
died, why bother with them now?

Strephon was the most underrated Emperor since Cleon II.

    I agree, it is one of the best Traveller Sourcebooks out there.  It has
the felling of hope & rebuilding the 3I.  But, TNE blows that away.
Personally, I do not like the idea of Virus or TNE.  So I do not use it,
though I do use the TNE setting, without the Virus & CT/MT rules.

3G\'s of acceleration would make a 100kg (220lb) weigh 300kg (660lb). I would
say that the person would not be able to hold on with their hands but a high
strength rope/cord might hold. However they would also have air resistance
to contend with if in an atmosphere. Personally I tend to think that the
person might be able to hold on for a few seconds and then would be forced
to let. Call it some sort of strength check/task every couple of seconds
with a growing penalty for fatigue. Best to try to ensure that they have a
rope or a niche with a floor to ride out the acceleration.

Unless it is gamma/X-ray radiation it wouldn\'t get through the space suit.
(If the person is not in a Vacc suit they had best have marshmallows in
their pockets cus\' their going to roast in even alpha radiation.) Micro
tides from the gravitic drive might be fun and not immediately fatal. [Best
described as your rump is accelerating away from the ship at 1000 G(*) while
your nose is accelerating away at 999 G(*). Only lasts for a fraction of a
second but should be enough to give the person a bloody nose (nice red mist
on the face plate) and a really bruised rump.

I recall reading that one of the benefits of gravitics was that it had a
consistent strength over an distance and then dropped off rapidly (log
curve). I would also assume that the force was in a relatively tight cone
facing aft of the ship. So our poor space man would let go of the ship. The
ship would accelerate away at 3 G. Our space man would travel towards the
aft of the ship covering 30 m of length in second 1; 90 in second 2 (total
of 120 m) and 180 m in the 3rd (300 m total). At this point he would be in
the drive cone. And would be accelerated at 1000+ G for a fraction of a
second and then just coast with a reasonable net vector away from the ship.

(*) Just numbers I chose: to get a 100 td (call it 28,000 metric tons) ship
at 3G means the ship is producing a thrust of (F=ma) of 84,000,000 N. On the
100 kg person that gives an acceleration (a = F/m) 840000 G at (lets say 1 m
from source). Say the force drops off at 1/r^2 so at 10 meters the
difference between your front and back (a .2 m distance) (Da = Fm/r1^2 -
Fm/r2^2) (a = 8400 - 8074) or 326 g. Ok so that would be fatal. 20 m  it
would be 2100 - 2058.6217038 = 41 g. That would hurt (Allot) but it wouldn\'t
last for even a fraction of a second.

Please correct an math errors: My calculus was back when CT was still out.

Snork

I disagree. Strephon was certainly an honourable and compassionate
character. But I don\'t see him as being great.

1 - He left Capital without taking basic precautions against the eventuality
    that something might happen to his clone. As far as we know, he didn\'t
    tell anyone he was away. I guess its safe to assume that Iphegenia and
    Iolanthe knew, but he failed to take the basic precaution of ensuring that
    at least one of them was safe at all times (while Strephon was absent,
    Iphegenia, Iolanthe and Strephon\'s clone should not have ever been in the
    same place at the same time).

2 - He failed to tell Tranion (the very model of Imperial honour) that he was
    absent. If Tranion could not be trusted, nobody could.

3 - He failed to take even basic steps to ensure that the third in line to the
    throne received even the most rudimentary preparation for public life.

All this might be excused, except for point 4.

4 - When faced with the crisis, he (apparently literally) went to bed, pulled
    the covers over his head and wished the world would go away. A great
    man would have acted decisively, Strephon did not act at all.

I see Strephon as a competent but rather uninspired leader. Perfectly fine
for running the Imperium under normal conditions, but totally unsuited for
a major crisis. My view of Strephon is a rather tragic character. An
honourable man, who failed totally when faced with the crisis and lived
the rest of his life stricken with guilt at his failure and trying futilely to undo
what he had done.

Depends - personally, I couldn\'t hang on at 1G for very long.
For a strength 12 character, think of a climber hanging on to a rope
with two other fallen guys tied to him (not forgetting equipment).

So it sounds possible. How about rolling 1D per G under strength each
round and another success needed to actually do anything (like getting
a foothold or trying to open the airlock).

I\'d suggest a bonus for constant acceleration (as the PC gets used to
the situation) and a bonus in the first round for zero G combat skill.
Alternatively, that\'s a negative DM in the first round, offset by
Zero G comabt skill and/or dex.

Note that even if the PC fails, the bad guys ship is likely to impart
some velocity to him away from his ship. So unless your vacc suits
have built in thrusters, someone is going to have to come and pick
him up.

Sorry for opening my big mouth then.  <oops>.  Remember there are 3 books in
this series :

Mutineer\'s Moon
Armageddon Inheritance
Heirs to Empire

I wish he\'d write more in this series, and get that sequel to "In Death

ages.  I never liked his Honor Harrington stuff..too much aristrocratic
detail for me to stomach.  I like a good fight story.  :)

Just think of the poor guys face if after succeeding in holding on he

This isn\'t quite near c rock territory but is close to lasers vs missiles.

;-)

IIRC the only conclusion last time was that the difference in price
between USL and SL spaceships pays for whatever it takes to land on
a planet with an atmosphere. However, I don\'t recall any agreement
over what it was that you paid for.

While I think you\'re right, I\'m not sure who you actually mean here -
Varian was third in line, and died in suspicious circumstances. Lucan
was forth in line, but both of them should have had at least some
training, and preferably practical experience.

Surely you mean T4? TNE doesn\'t have jump grids, as its Jump Drives
create a field surrounding the ship, thus allowing the piggybacking of
non-jump capable boats.

An interesting description of an Orion drive was in "Footfall" and then one

No Strephon was Emperor, Iolanthe was Empress-Consort (and as such
not in line of succession), Iphegenia was first in line of succession, Varian
second and Lucan third. Working from memory Margaret was fourth.

As I\'ve said before, the lack of preparation for Lucan (and probably Varian)
speaks heaps about the nature of the Late Imperial Court, as does the fact
that Strephon did not tell either Tranion or some senior members of the
Moot about his absence. Either Strephon was a total incompetant, or the
highest Imperial officials and the model of Imperial honour could not be
trusted with the fact that the Emperor was away from court. Given the
balance of what we know about Strephon, I\'d say he wasn\'t a total
incompetant, which leaves ...

	Imagine that you are standing on a street corner, holding

Surely you mean T4? TNE doesn\'t have jump grids, as its Jump Drives
create a field surrounding the ship, thus allowing the piggybacking of
non-jump capable boats.

Rupert Boleyn

Since jump drives in TNE have surface area I always assumed that some of
this was the exhaust from the fast burn reactor and some from "the hull
grid" which turned up in the DGP publication (shh musnt talk about that)
Starship Operators Handbook, besides I like a hull grid explains how
different configurations can enter jump space.

	Entering the atmosphere may be possible, though awkward if
	the ship must be pointed straight up all the time, but
	landing requires more than surviving the atmosphere.  I
	have always assumed that "streamlining" includes landing
	gear, wilderness refueling equipment, and general design
	considerations that allow access to the ship when it is
	landed.

I\'m designing my own weapons for a ship I\'m building, and then comparing my design to 
the "standard" designs - and mine are coming out quite a bit more powerful. The reason, 
as I see it, is the power requirement.

Pow = kJ * 2.666 * ROF 

For a TL 10 360MJ laser (ROF 1/2)

Pow = 360,000 * 2.666 * 0.5 = 479,880kJ or 480MJ.

This is exactly half of what the "offical" design says - it has a 960MW power cell, not 
a 480MW. If you correct the design, you can get a bigger laser - around 584 MJ.

I\'m including the weapon, universal mount, full stab, power cell, power plant that 
provides 1/60 the power of the cell (to recharge it in 60 seconds) and access space 
around the power plant. Am I missing something?

Well, there goes one rewrite to MTU.

It also explains the small "vecotr thrust ports" seen on smaller Trav
ships (Jesse\'s Scout, Free Trader and Sub Merc come to mind). If CG and
Thruster plates provided vectored thrust why would you need these? But
if GC didn\'t provide vectored thrust they become quite resonable for
small ships designed to be independant of tugs.

*Scratches head* Lots of rewriting to do now!

Could you please give a page ref for that? All I can find in FFS is a
statement on page 75:

"CG Lifters do not provide thrust and so cannot physically lift a craft or
vehicle. Instead, they neutralise most of the gravitational attraction of a
world (approx 99%, after which point power usage becomes prohibitive). This,
combined with atmospheric pressure, will provide bouyancy in very dense
atmospheres and so allow the craft to float at low altitudes, but usually CG
is used only as an adjunt to the ship\'s thrusters."

As far as I can figure, that would be directly contadicted by a statement
that force can be redirected sideways.

Subject: OT but interesting Keith Bro. note

Just thumbing through Cinescape magazine and noticed an article about a
new Dune novel. It\'s being written by Brian Herbert (son of Frank) and
Kevin J. Keith. Since this book (actually first of a trilogy) is a
prequel to the classics, it might have some further insight into the
classic Dunes Imperial politics, maybe fodder for 3I politics?

- --end paste--

Close, but no cigar. The co-author is Kevin J. Anderson, author of several 
Star Wars novels, several solo novels, and several novels (in the 
technothriller mode) with Doug Beason.

A recent (probably the current) issue of Amazing Stories has a short story by 
the duo set during the battle in Dune where Baron H. and the Emperor\'s 
personal troops attack Duke Leto...

I borrowed a laptop to tinker with, but haven\'t had much luck actually
making Delphi work. Part of the problem, i suspect, is that I keep trying
to use Mac user-interface elements when Windows doesn\'t have the equivalent
(or when what I think is the equivalent behaves differently).

In any case, my workload next semester precludes learning another platform.
I have two courses I\'ve never taught before, one that I have taught before,
and my schedule doen\'t have a lunch break. (In fact, given that I am
supposed to be in the lab continuously while class is in session, I run
slightly over five hours without even a pee break.)

In game terms, because he didn\'t recognize IRIS as having any legitimacy.
From page 28 of Survival Margin:

     "Who are these IRIS people?
     "You\'d think that I might have heard of them once or twice.
     "Who owns them, and what are they getting at? Besides the obvious, or
course, attempting to place themselves as the Emperor brokers. Perhaps
someone should explain the Moot to them. For that matter, perhaps someone
should explain the Moot to the Moot.
     "So why is Lucan playing along? Unless he assumes that they are real,
and if he admits ignorance he\'ll somehow undercut his claim?
     "Perhaps IRIS is onto something after all, if this insecurity about
revealed knowledge affects even the claimants themselves. Certainly I\'d
undercut my miserable, pyrrhic claim if I stood up and said I\'d never heard
of them before.
     "It\'s fascinating, though, how they\'ve pulled this off. Their story
has not been questioned in the slightest: this elite gang of undercover
übermenschen who can tell claimants to the throne where to get off in the
name of some higher, all-powerful string-pulling force of order and
predicatbility in the universe. Not a bad idea after all."



In real-life terms, I\'ve heard it was because IRIS was a variant that Chuck
Gannon kept writing into all the stuff he was doing for GDW, and that after
he left they remaining writers didn\'t like the idea, so this was a way of
cutting IRIS down to size. I could believe this story, but really don\'t
care whether it\'s true or not after all these years.


I never liked IRIS when it first appeared, so had to edit the TNS to cut
out all references to what I saw as a silly variant. After Survival Margin
came out I restored the references, because I could accept IRIS as a con
job -- just not a superspook agency.

Sorry, suspect I was mixing up TNE and T4.  Ok, I guess all the grav vehicles in TNE are impossible, since using HEPlaR in atmosphere is suicide.

However, every version of traveller other than TNE had CG providing manuever capabilities (well, GT doesn\'t, but it doesn\'t strongly distinguish between contragravity and reactionless thrust anyway).

The territories in Traveller are political, not ecological in nature.
Socioeconomic and political competition is _not_ the same as the
\'competition\' as used by evolutionary biologists, as it is rarely driven
by reproductive fitness.

This is dangerous, extrapolating from a monospecies sterotypic game role
to something in the real world. \'Bwaps as bureaucrats\' is a dangerous
oversimplification, both from a real-world standpoint (were Bwaps to
exist in the real world) and from a game universe standpoint. They too
rapidly become Trek  \'humans-with-bumpy-foreheads-an-funny-noses\'
aliens. They may _culturally_ be suited for a bureacratic role, but they
will be found doing just about anything else.

Dolphins, otoh, _would_ be restricted to a great extent, simply because
of their physical requirements, but any race that can exist comfortably
in human \'shirtsleeves\' environments will not.

_Cultural_ assimilation is a very real possibility; but I don\'t think
that would necessarily result in genetic assimilation. Some minor races
would blend into the main population, but most, I suspect, would not.

The aftereffects of 5000 years of the Vilani caste system may segregate
some races into specific roles, but the explosive effect that the Rule
of Man had upon the Vilani system would have wiped out most traces of
that long ago, to the extent that though your name might be, say,
Miller, that would hardly mean you ground flour for a vocation. ;-)

One thing that is missed in all the Ttraveller discussions, is that
people who actually _leave_ their homeworlds regularly are a minority;
Travellers are rare.

The OTU is clearly depicted as very heterogenous, so I don\'t think
biological _or_ cultural convergence is an issue in the Imperium.

That\'s true. I set the TU I\'m GMing several thousand years after TNE
and a long, *long*, long night, but I think my second choice would be

BTW, and not just to be different, I use a lot more of TNE\'s mechanics

	In my TNEC game, I actually note what generation "spacer" the

The only differences I saw were in your Radio Direction Finder 
(which you forgot to mention receive only) and the total KW (though 
it was close enough to be considered round off error).  Also, you 
only need to multiply the RX cost by 3, not 4 for access space.

I also am not sure if you would calculate the Structural Weight and 
Cost.  I would think so because you can make a section of the ship 
a little more damage resistant than the rest.

All in all, I would say this is a good design:  Small enough to go in a 
Courier, cheap enough that small governments can afford one and 
sneaky enough for PCs.

Thanks for the addition!

Quite true. I guess the designers of the Lab Ship, Donosev and Chrysanthemum
felt that was not required by the mission profile, and that the Aurora was
built mostly out of bubble gum and baling twine, so maybe CG was a luxury
they couldn\'t afford (or find the bits for).

I think of it more an issue of internal stiffness and bracing. If, for
example, we took a current-day aircraft carrier, strapped a huge mother of a
rocket pack to its belly and lifted it out of the water on our single thrust
point, it would just plain snap in two. I\'m sure we all know why it would do
that - because it\'s supposed to have water supporting it along its length.

That\'s the kind of thing that happens when you move something outside of the
environment for shich it\'s designed. A spaceship designed never to enter a
plant\'s gravity well (except in orbital freefall) would have exactly the
same problem. Sure, you could redesign an unstreamlined ship to have the
internal bracings (or distributed thrusters) necessary, but I think that\'s
actually the majority of what you pay for when you buy a
TNE-streamlined/HG-partially-streamlined (as opposed to an
TNE-airframe/HG-streamlined) ship.

I can drink water. (And breathe the vapour without *too* much trouble.)
Freon I\'m not so fond of. A hige steam cloud over the landing pad doesn\'t
cause many environmental problems. That\'s assuming a world with a
breatheable atmosphere to start with, of course.

Graphite\'s also not the best thing to make a blast shield out of. Graphite\'s
most important property is its softness (lubrication, pencils, etc). Not
something I\'d want to be shooting high speed rocket efflux over for any
length of time. They\'re probably expensive to replace.

What you have built here is a \'rapid fire\' laser!
While all weapons in G:T are built for a RoF of 1/2, most are only given
enough power and capacitor for RoF 1/60.  In this way you get more weapon
in the module as you alocate a smaller slice of fusion power to charge up
the battery.  More power, faster recharge and thus quicker RoF. But using
the module design system, you loose space for your actual weapon.

Standard weapon is therefore: 
360*2.666 *1/60 = 16Mw

At higher RoF, you get a bonus to hit.  +4 at 1/60, +9 at 1/2!

It wouldn\'t get left behind.  Either there is no atmosphere, in which case
the ship is in a low surface orbit, or there is and the ship will act like
an rather heavy airship, with air resistance trying to accelerate it the the
location\'s windspeed.


For a scout, the ship displaces 1,400 m3 of air.
At 1 atmosphere, air masses 1.2 kg /m3.
So the scout displaces 1,680 kg of air, providing an upthrust of 16,800 N at
1g
The scout masses 477,000 kg empty, but has a weight of only 47,700 N (at 1g)
due to CG.

For complete bouyancy you\'d have to increase the pressure to 2.83
atmospheres.
Alternatively, you need to provide 30,900 N of vectored thrust, equivalent
to running the scout\'s engines at around 0.006 G.

With that anology you\'re going to get a LOT more than 3G of acceleration as
the rope snaps tight.

Or even large airships could work. You manoevre underneath one at
stratospheric altitude, they attach cables and wind you in, then descend
(maybe requiring assistance from your manoevre drives for thrust).

I quite like that idea.

That\'s pretty much my feeling on the matter. I find the collapse of HT more
believable than Virus; however, Virus does has some interesting ideas.

Some thoughts - Strephon is (SM source) devastated by the news of the death
of his wife and daughter by one of his allies/appointed men. In shock, he
lets them take him somewhere safe. His trust in his aides is misplaced as
all he really needed to do is get back to Capital and Code Blue the Navy
base. Lucan would have fallen in line (faced with his uncles\' return),
Dulinor would have been a murderer and the people of the Imperium would
have \'one clear choice\'.

The failure in Strephon was to be human and allow his grief to blind him to
his aides\' decisions. On them must fall the blame for the deaths of
Trillions of sophonts following the Collapse and the release of Virus.

Most of the published grav vehicles in TNE with design breakdowns use
HEPlaR. It\'s not necesarily suicide to use HEPlaR in an atmosphere, it\'d
just be a hell of a lot less efficient than in space since you can\'t use a
needle-thin exhaust stream moving at a significant fraction of c.

The whole problem can be handwaved by the presumption that one accepts a
ludicrously-low-Isp-drive without also requiring a
ridiculously-high-exhaust-velocity. In my head, that\'s easier to accept than
the concept of a reactionless drive. Sure, it\'d never work *really*, but at
least it uses principles I\'m familiar with, rather than some strange
mystical science.

>However, every version of traveller other than TNE had CG providing
manuever capabilities (well, GT doesn\'t, but it doesn\'t strongly distinguish
between contragravity and reactionless thrust anyway).


I don\'t know about MT (and I have a pretty low opinion of much of T4\'s
science - sorry if the author\'s listening) but I\'m told GT contragrav just
nullifies weight, and as far as I was aware Classic assumed use of T-plates
for manoevring under contragrav.

Very much agreed.  Hard Times is an incredibly rich book detailing a
fascinating setting.  What I liked least about TNE was that it took all
that richness away.  All those worlds struggling to maintain space travel,
keep their life support working, ward off pirates, and/or keep in contact
with the rest of the universe were totally trashed and reduced to very
similar dead worlds or TL 0-4 wrecks.  TNE is fine as its own thing, but
it feels much less like Traveller than Hard Times.

ATLANTIS CLASS GUNBOAT (TL 10)

  The newest vessel in the Taneian fleet, the Atlantis class 
gunboat is designed to be a jack-of-all-trades, serving as a 
patrol vessel, escort, picket, and SO (special ops) vessel.
  The Atlantis is highly advanced, and equiped with an extensive 
suite of electronic warfare equipment. These systems serve it 
well in all its roles - lying in wait for privateers and pirates, 
altering its signature to appear like a merchant vessel, and 
providing electronic warfare support to fleet elements.
  The vessel has a bunkroom capable of holding a total of 
8 individuals. This bunkroom is intended to hold prisoners if the 
craft is operating in a patrol capacity, or a squad of RATs 
(Rapid Assault Troopers) when working as a base ship for special 
operations. To further support RAT operations, the Atlantis mounts 
a single OIC (orbital isertion capsule) launcher and OIC storage 
rack, as well as Golem Assault Armor storage. When not operating 
as a SO craft, this space is largely wasted, athough a small amount 
of cargo can be placed in the Golem storage area.
  To handle a large number of prisoners, or to assist in the
evacuation of a damaged ship, the Atlantis has forty low berth 
units.
  The crew of fifteen consists of the Captain, XO/Navigator, 
Medic, Helmsman, Sensor/Commo Operator, Electronic Warfare 
Specialist, three engineers, and four gunners. The Captain and 
XO have their own staterooms (being officers), while the rest 
of the crew lives in double-occupancy rooms. A large common area 
keeps the ship from seeming too cramped. 
  Per normal Taneian operational doctrine, the Atlantis is 
equiped with enough life pods to support the full crew (six pods 
support 24 people, enough for the crew and a squad of RATs). 
The forty low berths are also ejectable in a large powered module,
allowing for the entire compliment to escape a doomed vessel.
  For offensive power, the Atlantis has two laser turrets and
two missile launchers. The missile launchers are standard
triple tube launchers, capable of launching standard missiles.
The lasers, however, are large single-barreled weapons giving
the Atlantis a long range energy punch. All of the weapons retract 
into the hull to provide a undisturbed surface for stealth 
purposes.
  The harshest criticism of the Atlantis is its armor - or more
properly, the lack of armor. Compared to ships of the line, the
Atlantis is rather fragile, being vulnerable to even turret
lasers. The vessel is intended to rely on its stealth and ECM
to avoid danger.

Actually, if a drive has an exhaust velocity of less than Isp*9.8 meters/second,
it violates conservation of momentum and is just as bad as a reactionless
thruster.  My personal favorite is total conversion thrusters, where the
majority of the energy is assumed to escape in some invisible way.

But the important thing (to me at least) is a distinction between the
quantitative, scientific analysis, and fundamental principle. With a HEPlaR
drive *something* comes out the back of the engine. If there\'s a nice
cinematic flame or exhaust stream then, well, the engine obviously ought to
be going forwards. Any TV sci-fi will show that. T-Plates require a whole
quantum step forward in suspension of disbelief.

On the flip side, usual rules apply here. We all use what works for us.

(Actually I\'m not sure what we\'re actually debating now - I\'m sure the
original point mutated into something else along the way.)

well, I actually really like the Harrington, but I think Mutineer\'s moon is

incredible again.  Just started the third one...

What\'s the In Death Ground about?  I haven\'t seen that one yet...

well, that\'s an acceptable solution for small ships, but that still doesn\'t 
explain why it\'s "streamlining" that\'s at stake here.  I can see a 5000dt 
USL freighter slowly settling, nose up, into a prepared berth in a 
downport, where various gantries grab onto it for support, and fuel hoses 
attach to the same nozzles used in orbital refueling.  The ship never 
completely powers down, and takes off, slowly, as soon as it\'s unloaded and 
re-loaded.

This would save a fortune in interface craft costs, and any maintenance 
that requires full power down can be done in orbit.  Of course this ship 
can only land at prepared locations, but for high-volume, high-pop routes, 
that should be ok. (Hmm... Maybe it can use drop tanks, too... :)  )

Not quite.  For normal GT VE2, this is correct, as it allows a battery to 
hold one (normal GURPS combat round=1sec) round worth of fire.  However, in 
GT, the battery holds not one round worth but one _shot_ worth.  That\'s EPS 
(energy per shot) and is EPS=kJ * 2.666 (for a laser).  Giving you the 
factor of two error you are getting.  Note that despite this, the 360MJ 
laser is slightly broken (as far as mass is concerned)...

If you\'d like, I can email you a spreadsheet I designed that does energy 
weapon calculations for GT.  It\'s not available for public distribution 
yet, but I\'m looking for beta testers to shake out the bugs before I submit 
it to SJG.

	Sounds like a good system to me.  IMTU, it is easier and
	cheaper to offload "unstreamlined" ships at the highport
	and ferry the goods down in a shuttle, but what you

While some of the technical ideas were worthwhile, I considered none of

I read somewhere that a computer simulation was used to model the fleet
battles. While I enjoy wargaming, I would never write a book based on a

Again, YMMV. I don\'t think you could pay me to read part 2. Honestly, I

I don\'t think that analogy holds.  An aircraft carrier isn\'t designed to 
take a single point thrust, but a space ship is.  A better analogy would be 
a modern fighter jet, which, given the right birth , could sit on the 
ground on it\'s tailpipe all day long

Instinctively, I have to agree with you.  If a vessel isn\'t designed for 
atmosphere, it shouldn\'t be able to handle atmosphere.  But I want to know 
_why_.  I\'m really looking for specific problems the ship would 
experience.  I don\'t think that internal bracing is an issue, as it\'s 
already in place to survive the multi-G thrust of the ship.  (a ship rated 
for .01G OTOH, _would_ get torn apart by a planet....)

	Gather concrete blocks equal to twice your weight. Do a chinup on a
steel bar and have a friend tie the blocks to your ankles. Now have
your friend drop the blocks ...

	Hanging on by hand I\'d doubt. If he had a place where he could brace
himself feet and hands (and preferably other body parts as well),
maybe ... until you start doing evasive maneuvers at 3G.

	This one is, I think, entirely your call ... at least until Glenn
makes a better report on his sighting near Area 51 and we find out
just what thruster plates are. Blue light, by itself, isn\'t a
penetrating radiation hazard. It may be bright enough to burn through
a faceplate, or even fry. What other radiation accompanies it is up
to you.

Only if it\'s a dead calm all the way down. USL means that it is *not*
staticly *or* dynamicly stable under the combination of thrust loading
and wind loading. 

The usual result of such lack of stability is *wild* tumbling in even a
breeze. 

And trying to weasle out by saying "but the computer will compensate"
requires that the computer have been programmed *in advance* with the
aerodynamic properties of the ship. Which, since *by definition* USL
ships are never intended to land seems more than a little unlikely.

The problem is *wind*. USL is "unstable" in a wind. I won\'t go into
details, just note that the wind forces act thru a point *other* than
the center of mass. And where the point is depends on the angle. Thus,
in the presence of even a *light* wind, the vehicle will tumble
wildly. 

> Am I overlooking something?  Is this in a faq somewhere?  Or is this an 
> acknowledged hole in Traveller?

It\'s a frequently debated question. 

Having had to design objects that were aerodynamicly stable at low
speeds, I can assure you that it will be a major problem.

Engine thrust is fixed with respect to the hull. And any "deflections"
are figure with respect to the hull, not with respect to the outside
world. 

Thus, when a light gust of wind exerts more force on one side of the CG
than the other, the ship will turn in the direction of the excess wind
load. But the thrust *also* turns (until someone tells the system to
change it). 

So now the ship is moving in a *different* direction relative to the
wind. Which means the wind forces are form a different direction, and
since (by definition) this ship is not even rudimentarily streamlined, 
the wind will now turn it in a *different* direction. 

The result is a wild tumble. And to attempt to compensate for it would
require that the ship\'s computer be programmed with a lot of
aerodynamic data about the ship. Which is hard to justify in a ship
that (again, *by definition*) isn\'t intended to enter atmosphere.

And even if you use this sort of computer aided stability, these wind
forces impose a *lot* of strain on the hull. And in directions that
manuevers in space *won\'t* impose stress.

Now consider the fact that speed relative to the ground and speed
relative to the atmosphere aren\'t the same thing. Not even close in far
too many cases. Things like clear air turbulence and wind shear (the
boundary between two masses of air moving in different directions at
*very* different speeds) regularly destroy airliners that run into
them. And being slow is a *dis*advantage, because it means you are
dragged or tossed around for that much longer. 

Heck, look at hot air ballons. They are streamlined (really!) and move
slowly. And even then, sudden updrafts and downdrafts are a danger. 

So, essentially, the answer is that a ship has to be *designed* to
enter atmosphere.

Probably leave him floating. Picture yourself holding onto a similar
grip attached to a rope going over a pulley. Your feet are *securely*
fastened to the floor. 

At the start, the grip is pulling upwards gently (say there are a
couple of pounds on the end of the rope. (zero G). When they
hit 3g of thrust, it is pulling upwards with *three times your weight*.
(ie someone just *dropped* weights equal to 3 times your weight into
the "basket on the end of the rope).

I doubt that anybody could hold onto it.

The tyupe of radiation involved has never been stated. You\'ll have to

Check out some of (Gerald?) O\'Neil\'s stuff on designs for L5 colonies.
It\'s old but it should have references to the actual research. 

Basicly, you can get away with the classic "wheel" type staion. And
with *big* cylinders like the proposed L5 colonies. 

For ships, such as some designs for Mars expeditions, you seperate the
living quaters and drive section leaving them connected by a strong
tether. Then you spin them about their common center of gravity. This
also helps minimize shielding requirements. 

And the ship "decks" can continue to treat the "nose" as the top (or
any other orienation that is convenient).

Because water has *the* highest heat capacity of any common substance.
That is, it takes more energy to raise the temp of a given amount than
it does for other substances. 

The graphite is to provide protection from the high temp plasma. It has
the highest "melting point" of anything. But the baseplate has to
*absorb* a lot of neutrons and the like to protect the crew. They wind
up as heat.

An Orion could possibly out accelerate a lot of ships. And the sheer
*size* has to count for something. Remember, one of the early
suggestions was using one to establish a lunar colony. By launching the
entire colony as a unit!

It all comes down to what you want in YTU.  

I *like* the picture of *huge* battleships slowly drifting down
through the atmosphere on their CG\'s, occasional puffs of flame from
their maneuvering thrusters keeping her in balance. Pilots having to
keep an eye out for sudden downdrafts and wind gusts that might
unbalance the waddling ship and snap her into.  And heaven help them
all if their CG goes out...

There was a story a few years ago with that very image. A
multi-million ton ship suddenly losing CG at a few thousand meters,
breaking up, and plunging into the ocean. I can\'t remember the story,
but the image has stuck with me.

Presumably \'blue light\' was chosen to resemble cerenkov radiation, in which case I guess you\'re being affected by a wave of tachyons, since nothing else will produce cerenkov radiation in vacuum.

[MORE KNIFE WORK]

Speaking as someone who builds and flies model rockets, the major problem you are
going to have with landing an unstreamlined ship in an atmosphere is control.

Unless the exposed surfaces are balance with respect to the centers of pressure
and the center of mass, and the axis of thrust passes through the center of both
points, the ship will be /negatively/ stable.  Unless the control software is
prepared to handle this, and control surfaces or sterring jets available to
control the effects the instant they begin to occur, the ship will tumble out of
control at the first gust of wind or application of thrust.

*WHEW*

Here\'s an ASCII diagram of a rocket showing the locations of the points:


 _
| \\
|  \\________________________________
|                                   \\
|            +   +                   )  ---- Axis of thrust
|   ________________________________/
|  /
|_/          |   |
         Center  |
           of    |
        Pressure |
                 |
               Center
                 of
                Mass

Now, the fun parts.  The center of pressure is the point here the air forces along
the hull are balanced.  The pressure of the wind flowing along the hull can be
simulated by applying pressure at this point.  As speed increases, the point tends
to slip
back non-linearly based on the geometry of the fins.

The center of mass is the point at which the rocket is balanced.

If the center of pressure is behind the center of gravity, the wind will tend to
autocorrect the orientation of the rocket.  The further back the center of
pressure is, the more stable the rocket is.

If the thrust is out of alignment with any of these two points, the rockt will
tend to rotate about that point.

Since the USL ships can thrust at all, we can assume the axis of thrust passes
through the center of mass, else they would spin out o control in all cases.  One
of the things that streamlining does is to assure that the center of pressure is
properly located.  USL ships have to reason to assure this, and in  many cases it
is difficult and awkward to assure this is so.

Before anyone mentions gyro-stabilization, the forces we are talking about are
immense on large graft, more than sufficient to rend steel at not unreasonable
speeds.  Gyros could be used to detect sheearing, but you would have to rely on
some pretty honking thrusters or control surfaces.

Chris Olson
chris@pdaguy.com

PS.  Negatively stable craft do fly, but they are not very unstable, only
relatvely unstable.  To far out of stability and there is no hope of reacting
swiftly enough, or of being able to apply enough force to correct it.

No, its much too heavy for that.  Your average 200-ton unstreamlined ship has
a terminal velocity in air of somewhere around 700 mph, a typical heavy wind
(say, 35 mph) will accelerate it at .002 Gs or so.  Assuming the ship can turn
moderately quickly, this is flatly ignorable.

Given that ships can turn, this simply isn\'t true.  Manuevering thrusters are
plenty to overcome wind effects.

They\'re also 3 orders of magnitude lower density than a spaceship.

The Xen class is a long range 2 man scout craft. It lacks comfort. It lacks
space to move about in. But it has a full sensor kit, and it can move. It
is also hard to distinguish from the ubiquitous Sulieman class Type S
scout/courier. The minimal cargo space is usually food or urgent messages.
As an adjuct to scout HQ, as a courier it has sufficient computer power for
internal use. The problems are the dirves maintenance and the same (low
bid) life support system as the Sulieman class scout; the life support
problem is compounded slightly by having far less habitable volume.

Danson\'s Chance (Alaret)

Size :  30cm                                        weight :  2kg
Speed :  20                                          Hits :  3/0
Planet :  all                                           Terrain :  Caves

Danson\'s Chance looks like a small flat rug, dark brown.  It clings to the
ceiling of a cave from which drops on the heads of intruders.

There is a 99% chance (which can be adjusted for personal fortitude) that
the victim will die; if he does not, he will gain the creature as a
symbiote, providing an auxiliary brain and fine control of body functions.

Probably an incompatibility issue with ftp in passive mode.  Try standard ftp
instead of a browser, that seems to work fine.

7.1 MW power shortfall.



The Ironwing is a flat disc 15 metres across with a teardrop shaped fuselage
rising out of the centre. This fuselage contains bridge, staterooms and
cargo bay, with engineering spaces located across the back of the disc and
accessable only by crawlways. Sensors line the forward edges, arrayed below
fuel scooping vents and bridge windows. The airlock is located ventrally, on
the after centerline, immediately abaft the cargo loading hatch. The gentle
curve of the dorsal surface is broken only by the low dome of the turret.

Inside, the ship has a utilitarian feel and fairly cramped quarters. The
bridge doubles as a workspace, and contains a small kitchen and fresher. The
two crew share four staterooms between them on routine survey missions, but
the ship can carry up to eight persons for an extended duration, and up to
twenty four at an absolute limit, although ths number would only be carried
in the most extreme circumstances. The bridge lies at the front of a short
corridor with two staterooms to either side. The after end of the corridor
is a set of stairs leading down into the airlock, with access hatches for
turret and engineering to either side.

Normally the ship is operated with a crew of two manoevre-trained crew, one
of whom is often cross-trained in gunnery. For missions where trouble is
likely a specialist gunner is often carried, upping the roster to three
although this obviously inceases operating costs. As far as mission
equipment runs the ship is decked out similarly to the Sulemaine, although
with a slightly inferior Active EMS Array. The Ironwing\'s crew accomodation
is notably more spartan, but some tradeoffs must be expected for a 200%
increase in Jump performance. Cargo carriage is slightly increased, and the
power plant is slightly downrated by comparison.

Why such a big one? This is the major component of the module & price tag. 
What EW software have you got up your sleeve?

Unless you are thinking of code breaking & multi-stream data analysis software

Long term access space is equal to power system volume doubled. So 10.5 cf only.

I would also put a few fuel cells in there to enable the computer & detectors to
be run for long periods with everything else shut down, including that noisy
neutrino source, otherwise known as a fusion reactor.

I would also put some fuel cells in the thruster module to enable a few minutes
manouver without the reactor too.

	Just the opposite: Netscrape was at least able to pull up a
directory listing for the base directory given above, and read files
in it. But no subdirectories, which is where all the goodies seem to
be. My FTP client won\'t even get a directory.

The hull/thrusters are transparent?  Blue light inside an opaque chunk of metal isn\'t very interesting.

	Actually, not being that familiar with Cerenkov radiation (aside
from the basic concept), I was visualizing the C-r emitted by the
surface layer of the hull/thrusters/whatever. Agreed, the C-r
"emitted" inside isn\'t going very far ...

his storyline. If the Ewoks had been Wookies, well, /that/ would make sense.
Not cuddly enough.

George is a *great* storyteller... For me to poop on!
Bleh, sorry SW fans, I just had to get that off my chest. I love the idea,
and the comics that preceded the sequels, but I think the story degenerates
only slightly slower than Herberts Arrakis series.

I\'m having a hard time justifying that IMTU.  In fact, IMTU that\'s 
precisely the system I use.  IMHO, it\'s really cool to watch a multi-kdton 
freighter slowly lower itself to the pad.

The reason I brought this up to begin with was to find reasons why this 
_can\'t_ be done, since that seems to be the OTU claim...

Ok, this is a lot better than most arguments I\'ve heard, but I\'m still just 
not sure that these problems can\'t be dealt with by the ship\'s maneuvering 
thrusters.  Unfortunately, AFAIK, none of the design systems ever deal with 
just how powerful the "little" attitude thrusters are...  IOW, how fast can 
a ship rotate around it\'s CG?  If these are 6G thruster plates/HEPLARs that 
whip the ship around in any direction at will, than your argument doesn\'t 
work, since the ship can handle these stresses anyway.  OTOH, if these are 
little .01G nitrogen jets, you are certainly correct...

Gyro stabilization is, of course out.  At this scale gyros are only useful 
as a feedback mechanism.

Would they have to be big thrusters? (see my answer to Leonard)  It seems 
to me that the vessels attitude thrusters would be more than 
enough....  Too bad none of the systems describe just how strong these are 
(AFAIK)

Hmm... X31 fighter, negative static stability stability (not sure about 
dynamic...)  It\'s designed to be flown by a computer that constantly 
struggles to keep it in control.  Of course this doesn\'t apply here, as 
it\'s quite definitely SL and designed just for this purpose.

No, I\'ve completely and *intentionally* forgotten anything even remotely
similar to that. <grin>

Anyway, Cleon the Bad was a usurper.  There\'s a fair chance that he was
responsible for hitting Nicholle, and the hit on him was probably a \'Right
of Assassination\' job too, even if Jerome may not have done it in person. 
It wouldn\'t necessarily be recognised as such, though, since Cleon\'s
legitimacy as Emperor  was somewhat dubious.  He was on the throne for
about 80 years or so, IIRC, so he would have been accepted by most Imperial
subjects, as the only Emperor they had ever known.  The Moot might have
other ideas.

Who hit Jerome is really the only one that\'s not obvious.  There is a
certain appeal in having an Emperor blown away by their loving subjects,
rather than in a coup by some noble cousin, but there\'s also interest in
having Jaqueline herself being as big a worm as Olav, and getting some of
her own back.

I guess it doesn\'t really matter which, until someone gets around to define
the canon events.

Is this what you\'re looking for? Or are you after an IISS model?


Geist-class Deep Scout (GTL12)

The existence of the Geist-class of deep-penetration scout is officially
denied by the Imperial Navy. The following design is conjectural, based on
mission requirements and known technological capabilities. Most respected
naval experts agree that the Navy maintains long duration, deep penetration
missions inside foreign territory, to serve as advance listening posts and
warn of enemy mobilization.

The Brass Goat. Then there\'s the Hudson-class Lander: very useful for a

I think I\'m hitting the wall on merchants; not so much in the designs as in
the descriptions. IIRC, I\'m up over 100 civilian ships now. I\'m going to do
some GTL11 versions, and some more K\'kree ships.

How about this:

1) You either post a general name/description, either to me or the TML.

2) I\'ll create stats based on that description and post them back.

3) You amplify the description and post the final version back again.

(This applies to anyone, not just Juliean.)

I was going to reply to this the last time it was posted, but...

For true faithfulness to the story, it\'s actually a 99.9% mortality rate.
And I don\'t recall any modifiers.  Make the player roll a d10; unless he
gets three zeroes in a row, the character dies on the spot.

For obvious reasons, the book focuses on the one guy in a thousand who MADE
the roll...

I don\'t think so. Consider this: At what point does competition between
intelligent species cease to be social or economic, and become biological
or ecological? Before there can be trade, there must be a social contract;
before there can be a social contract, there must be fundamental trust and
understanding.

My interest stems in part from a strong personal bias toward truly _alien_
aliens -- the kind that have to be treated as "black boxes" to use as
NPC\'s, and can\'t be used as PC\'s at all. My point is that, while biology is
not destiny, supposing biology has /no/ effect on relationships between
alien species is just as likely to result in fallacy and
"humans-with-bumpy-foreheads-and-funny-noses" as overgeneralizing them.

Ahh, but it wouldn\'t be on official paper, the layout wouldn\'t conform to
regulations, the form doesn\'t exist on the authorised database etc etc ad
infinitum / nauseum.

After all, to any bureaucrat worth his pension, the *only* bureaucracy the
exist is the one he/she/it is in.  Any attempt to get them to sign *an
offworlder\'s* (shudder) documentation will simply result in being presented
with a application form for an appointment with the bureau of
xenobureaucracy.

  Striker is, AFAIK, still available from FarFuture. It is, IMHO, an excellent

  That may have been just the civvies, like the interstellar transports
landing at Uller and Poictesme* - the Space Viking ships of later epochs
and probably earlier warships (also collapsium-clad, IIRC) simply didn\'t
bother unless there was a danger of them bumping into something fragile.

  Mind you, that simply points out that TFH starships had adequate maneuver
drives for most on-world ops; CG most certainly didn\'t provide lateral thrus
 - witness the combined tracklaying/CG tanks from "Uller Uprising" (IIRC),
and the recovered scout car in Cosmic Computer, which had a jet engine to
provide mobility (?).

Actually, if AuricTech were designing the USL ship, we would, as a
safety measure, include the aerodynamic properties of the ship, just in
case.  (Naturally, this additional normally-useless programming costs a
bit extra [for additional computer memory and processing power, plus the
requirement to conduct extensive wind-tunnel and other airflow modeling
for a variety of atmospheres].  This _is_ AuricTech, after all....)

That doesn\'t surprise me.  After all, while there may be many diseases

I haven\'t yet gotten the hang of working with GT ship design, so I would
request that one of AuricTech\'s cruiser designs (take your choice,
either from Freelance Traveller or my own site) be translated into GT
stats (as closely as possible).  That would give me more of a feel for
what to expect, should we switch from T4 to GT.

_Tuscaloosa_ would be my first choice of AuricTech cruisers (my ref has
a special place in his heart for the WW II cruiser USS TUSCALOOSA).  Its
stats are on Freelance Traveller, as well as on my Web site.

Viking type raids in particular wouldn\'t worry about what was under them
when they landed. Large ships would probably haul their own tugs or have
auxilaries that could act in that capacitiy.

Piper\'s civilian ships also landed in cradles IIRC. I\'d still expect
them to have landing legs for frontier type landings. Of course over a
cetain size the bracing for self supporting landing legs might be more
costly than a multi-purpose cradle.

Makes for interesting changes to other equipment as well. The
umbiquitous airraft would now need some form of propulsion, in addition
to the CG generators. Still I like this model. It now makes sense to
have CG AND Thruster plates on ships and other vehicles.

I don\'t remember seeing one in Deep Impact, but I *do* remember the scene in Footfall.  Great book, btw...

Also, as has been mentioned before, is King David\'s Spaceship, which is an Orion derivitive, using conventional explosives IIRC.

Considering that Longbow II was partially psionic in nature, and it was
Imperial policy to stomp on psionics, I\'d say it was something *too* serious
to trust outside of the \'need to know\' circle.  Remember, Longbow II detected 
the Empress Wave inbound.  That\'s pretty serious, IMNSFBHO.

Also, Lucan and Varian were never considered to be viable candidates for the
Throne, thus were only given the *basics*.  If something had happened to
Iphegenia, this \'oversight\' would have been corrected of course.

IIRC, it didn\'t give me a *losting, but I was able to use \'get *\' with my ftp

In Deep Impact, Messiah, the ship sent to intercept the comet, used an 
Orion.  Interesting scene when the detonated the first weapon, everyone 
rocked back in the acceleration couches.

My main complaint about Virus is, it leveled the field *too* well and

The advent of Virus IMTU is still about 6 years away, *IF* I decide to go 
with it.  I\'m not sure yet, one way or another.

But then again, Chin\'s Raid of 1123 still hasn\'t happened by 1124 IMTU, 
either, so I guess I\'m a variant already.  <grin>

But what about the effects of the nukes going off in atmosphere?  Somebody\'s

Graphite coated spheres were able to survive nuke blasts at close range, which
is why you\'d want to coat your pusher plate with it.

  The ease of loading/debarkation, etc., is probably what drives the cradles,
plus perhaps simplification of maintenance while the ship is being readied 
for turn-around. The bigger ships (w/o getting into just how _too_ big some
of them are described as being) probably would threaten almost any practical
landing pad unless their feet got huge or the CG got left on 7/24 (presumably
not desirable - or do they leave the CG on in the cradle in the novels?).

  The only reason I wouldn\'t adopt it is because it makes (re)-designing
Striker vehicles a real pain.

If it\'s 0-3 in no seconds, then you have the suitcase/brick anology.  If
it\'s several moments... then your player has reaction time where I would
allow (for the epic adventure telling) him to say, "Oh farrrrrrk..." then
aim himself back at his own vessel\'s open airlock (or whatever it was that
allowed them to exit the ship), and kick-off... hopefully to torpedo
straight into his oen ship, or atleast grab something on the outside that he
can crawl back in!

However, if you intend on punishing the player for his actions (as foolish
as they may have or may not have been), then

1)  Dislocate some joints, have his hand ripped away from it\'s hold and burn
him :^)
2)  Let him hold on until he can no longer hang on, then just let him drift
in space to die a long, lonly death... *eg*

If he lets go, will the ship\'s "wash" push him away into space?

All these,and many more questions to be asked on... TML!

While I agree with elements of your summary I think  the  comment
about Strephon\'s inaction is a bit harsh.  Apart  from  the  time
immediately after the assassination (in 1116) when he was  grief-
striken he  was  apparently  in  charge  of  his  faction  for  a
considerable length of time  (atleast  until  1119  and  possible
until 1121).  Reading the diary  entries  in  Survival  Margin  I
suspect part of the reason for Strephon\'s reaction  to  IRIS  was
the accumulated stress  of  5  years  of  frustration  and  guilt
leading to Clinical Depression.  There are clear  signs  that  he
was becoming overwhelmed by these feelings by 1119.  And his  own
doctor noted after the assassination Strephon was "more  detached
than usual" ... suggesting someone who tended to bottle things up
(and thus psychologically more vulnerable  to  long  term  stress
related disorders).  He probably used to confide,  and  lean  on,
his wife (Empress Iolanthe) but obveously she\'s  not  "available"
to him any more.  So that\'s 5 years  of  facing  the  crisis  and
trying to deal with it before he "went to bed, pulled the  covers
over his head and wished the world would go away."

Rather than a "competent but rather uninspired  leader"  who  was
out of his depth, I see a man crumbling under the strain.

I wonder, sometimes, what would have  happened  if  Strephon  had
gone along with IRIS.  I suspect there were many on  Capital  who
were afraid of Lucan and would  have  jumped  at  any  excuse  to
depose him.  Similar in ways to the situation during WW2  between
Hitler and his general staff.

Then what the Hell is the Power Requirement step for (yelled in 
confusion ... not anger)?  

If you have a TL10 2000 kJ weapon with a cyclic rate (RoF) of 1/2 
then you require 2666 KW of power.  

If you have a TL10 2000 kJ weapon with a cyclic rate (RoF) of 1/60 
then you require 88.87 KW of power.  

Is that per Second?  If so, then it appears to consume much less 
power at a lower cyclic rate.  What am I missing?

IMHO, the way the formulas are presented in VE2 are a bit confusing.  Look 
at it this way:  a 1000kJ laser has an EPS (energy per shot) of
1000*2.666=2666kJs.  Remember, kJ is power, but kJs is energy, which is 
what a battery stores.  So, to fire this gun once, it takes 2666kJs.

Now comes the rather confusing question of ROF.  Basically, there are two 
ROFs that play a part here.  First, the intrinsic ROF of the weapon.  This 
is the highest ROF that the weapon can sustain given unlimited energy.  So 
if we say that the intrinsic ROF of this weapon is 1, then hooking it 
directly to a 2666kJ (or greater) fusion plant would allow it to fire at 
one shot per round (second).  even if we gave it excess energy, that\'s the 
fastest it can shoot.  The official SJG ruling is that the lowest intrinsic 
RoF allowed for GT is 1/2.

However, the intrinsic RoF is only attainable if the weapon is given 
sufficient power.  If power is insufficient, then a lower RoF is 
required.  This \'effective\' RoF is what\'s given as 1/60 in the book.  It 
simply means that the weapon is only given a battery with 2666kJs, enough 
for one shot, and then it takes a full minute to recharge that weapon.  If, 
OTOH, the battery was recharged twice as fast, an effective RoF of 1/30 
would be attainable.  However, regardless of how much energy, the effective 
RoF can never exceed the intrinsic RoF.

So when do you use which?

For any calculations regarding the size/weight/price of the weapon: 
intrinsic ROF.

For calculating battery size: Use EPS without factoring in the RoF

For calculating fusion slice: Give enough power to maintain the effective RoF

For calculating aiming bonus: use effective RoF.

Hope this clarifies the issue.

Um, kW is power, kJ is energy (equivalent to kWs).

HOLD ON!

J = Joules. That\'s a metric unit!

Shouldn\'t GURPS do this calculation in horsepower or therms?

That\'s more than 3G instantaneous load.

A better picture is that the rope is held taut and the basket is sitting
on a chair, then someone knocks the chair away.

I\'ve no doubt that I couldn\'t hang on, even if it wasn\'t for the fact
that I\'d be watching the ship\'s thruster glow before I realised that
it might have been an option.

A player with a strength 12 character and zero G comabt 4 isn\'t going
to let go until they\'re looking at a failed dice throw.

Oh? I suggest you ask the skipper of a supertanker about how
"ignorable" the way off center "sail" area of his superstructure is.
Luckily, it\'s at the *tail* of the vessel, so it helps keep the ship
pointed into the wind. It\'s a royal pain if you *don\'t* want the ship
pointed into the wind. And this is with much of the ship immersed in a
medium (water) that helps *damp* the effects.

Remember that a "200 ton" ship is 200 *displacement* tons. It doesn\'t
*mass* 200 tons. 

The force exerted by the wind is:

P = 0.5 D V^2 cos^2 A,

P = Pressure, N/m^2 (multiply by 0.000146 for psi)
D = Density, kg/m^3 (=1.225 for sea-level air on Earth)
V = Velocity, m/s (multiply by 2.24 for miles per hour)
A = Angle from perpendicular

So, let\'s try perpendicular impact at 35 mph, in sea-level air.

P = 0.5*1.225*2.24*35
P =  48.02

That\'s 48 newtons per square meter. Assume the ship has 100 meters of
cross sectional area in the plane of the wind (it likely has *more*).
That gives 4800 newtons of thrust. 

Assuming the ship really *does* weigh 200 tons...

F = m*A
4800 = 200,000*A
A = 0.024

That\'s 10 *times* the thrust you guessed. And if the ship has a cross
sectional area of 1000 m^3, the thrust is 0.24.

And the important part is that the thrust is *off center*. It imparts a
*turning* moment to the ship.

No, it *is* true. Manuevering thrusters *can* turn the ship. But the
main drive thrust is fixed. There\'s no real advantage in making the
main drive "steerable" that way, and lots of disadvantages. 

And I *wouldn\'t* count on thrusters intended for changing heading in
vacuum being able to overcome any sort of significant wind forces in an
atmosphere. 

As I recall, we worked out some time ago that a ship didn\'t need to be
able to use even .1 g for manuevering thrusters. They\'d actually whip
the ship around so fast that it could *cause* problems. 

But it won\'t take a lot of wind to generate more force than the
manuevering thrusters.

Your ship on CG is *just* as light as a hot air ballon. :-)

You\'ve got Isp *backwards*. High Isp = High Ve. And Isp is simply the
exhaust velocity times acceleration due to earth\'s gravity (9.8 m/s^2,
used as a conversion factor from "mas" units to "weight" units).

Actually, such a drive is flat out impossible because Isp is *defined*
as exhaust velocity times 9.8 m/s^2. 

But I\'m sure there are dodges that can be used. The one I\'d look into
is similar to the stunt they do with jet engines in some applications.
"High bypass turbofans" for example. 

Have a "shroud" around the HEPlaR unit. The exhaust of the HEPlaR, even
at *really* low power will create a partial vacuum behind the shroud.
This wil suck air into the shroud and out the back. This provides a lot
of extra thrust without increase full needs to much. And it provides a
"sheath" of air around the HEPlaR exhaust.

So now you have the possibility of broken ribs or a dislocated pelvis.

(try Jackie Chan\'s autobiography for an insight into breaks an dislocations
 from hits and falls - he\'s dislocated joints you\'ve never thought of.)

I hope there aren\'t any edges or protrusions - just slamming into the
door handle could be very painful.

So...

When the poor PC, having been battered into submission
(dislocated shoulder, greenstick fracture to the arms, twisted knee,
 broken ribs and torn ligaments in the fingers), finally lets go...

Then you want to have them drift through a radiation zone from the engines.

(Presumably causing several cancers throughout their body as well as
 leaving them unable to have children, even after the initial bleeding
 gums and hair loss effects have been cured.)

There\'s a chance that the effects of damage to the vacc suit could cause
lung damage due to exposure to vacuum. The PC will probably be fried from
inside and out when looked at by an active sensor designed to work at
1 million km, causing internal organ damage and surface burns (this might
break the vacc suit\'s cooling system, leaving them cooking on the side
facing the star and possibly frostbite on the other side).

Then someone will probably fire a sandcaster between the ships and,
as the battle moves away, the PC will be stuck in the sand cloud,
unable to signal for help. When someone finally returns to look for
they\'ll probably be running out of air and risking brain damage.

I think this is going to depend on the ship. The classic Broadsword

elevators in them - but some other unstreamlined ships simply aren\'t
shaped for landing on anything but a spacedock or a very specialized
landing cradle.

Consider the classic Lab Ship (a wheel design, it can even spin),
or the Merchant Cruiser Leviathan. Tough to figure out where landing
legs would even go on such a ship.

IMO, whether or not a particular unstreamlined ship can land should
be the GM\'s decision, based on the size and design of the ship.

Hm, I was thinking of  the Oster Band\'s song:

The generals are born again,
They\'re going to change the world.

(Seeming right, seeming right)

	Just because something is not done does not mean that it
	cannot be done.  Drawing on the various posts on this subject,
	one might assume that:

	1) non-streamlined ships are unstable in atmosphere and
	   require specific software to fly

	2) even with this software, unstreamlined ships in
	   atmosphere move slowly and are unable to handle stormy
	   weather

	3) landing unstreamlined ships requires special docking
	   facilities on the ground that are specific to that
	   particular class of ship (and may also require special
	   modifications to the ship).

	4) using a highport with connecting shuttles is more cost-
	   effective, entails less risk to the ship, shortens the
	   turn-around time, and makes it much easier to load/
	   unload

	With this approach, the PC\'s could try to enter an atmosphere
	with an unstreamlined ship in extremis, but there will be risk
	involved and landing would tend to be a one-way affair.

I always figured that it could be done if enough time was allotted to the 
process.  Even in Adv 7, Broadsword, it has the Broadsword "grounded" at 
the starport.

Yep. And still Tranian at least should have known it. Unless he was

Hmmmm.... was VARIAN taught only the basics? Is there a source for 
that bit of data? He was *before* Lucan, so maybe it was just Lucan 
who was left to himself... and maybe that\'s the reason he got jealous 
enough to want to usurpe Varian\'s right.

In a related note - is my math correct in figuring that the TL 10 maneuver module

	Darwinian evolution is driven by the reproductive success
	of replicators.  These replicators are typically organisms
	but, as has been pointed out on this list, it may sometimes
	useful to consider the gene the replicator (or, rarely, the
	population).  In any event, the replicator is favoured by 
	natural selection if it can make more copies of itself than
	its competitors.  Social evolution has another method of
	spreading: sophonts can adopt a new culture because it is,
	for whatever reason, appealing.  It is worth noting that the
	"C4" maxim only applies to identical competitors for the same
	resources (as was pointed out earlier).  The various species
	competing for the galaxy in the OTU are not identical.

	While I am often lazy enough to use HWBFAFN aliens, I also

	probably much more than most humans would like to believe.

	of the alien, paying attention to the patterns of behaviour
	that were likely to be favoured.  This does not mean that

maneuver drives - the mass/volume was prohibitive. The major change is a bug-fix in the 
weapons.


ATLANTIS CLASS GUNBOAT (TL 10)

  The newest vessel in the Taneian fleet, the Atlantis class 
gunboat is designed to be a jack-of-all-trades, serving as a 
patrol vessel, escort, picket, and SO (special ops) vessel.
  The Atlantis is highly advanced, and equiped with an extensive 
suite of electronic warfare equipment. These systems serve it 
well in all its roles - lying in wait for privateers and pirates, 
altering its signature to appear like a merchant vessel, and 
providing electronic warfare support to fleet elements.
  The vessel has a bunkroom capable of holding a total of 
8 individuals. This bunkroom is intended to hold prisoners if the 
craft is operating in a patrol capacity, or a squad of RATs 
(Rapid Assault Troopers) when working as a base ship for special 
operations. To further support RAT operations, the Atlantis mounts 
a single OIC (orbital isertion capsule) launcher and OIC storage 
rack, as well as Golem Assault Armor storage. When not operating 
as a SO craft, this space is largely wasted, athough a small amount 
of cargo can be placed in the Golem storage area.
  To handle a large number of prisoners, or to assist in the
evacuation of a damaged ship, the Atlantis has forty low berth 
units.
  The crew of fifteen consists of the Captain, XO/Navigator, 
Medic, Helmsman, Sensor/Commo Operator, Electronic 
Warfare Specialist, three engineers, and four gunners. The Captain 
and XO have their own staterooms (being officers), while the rest 
of the crew lives in double-occupancy rooms. A large common area 
keeps the ship from seeming too cramped. 
  Per normal Taneian operational doctrine, the Atlantis is 
equiped with enough life pods to support the full crew (six pods 
support 24 people, enough for the crew and a squad of RATs). 
The forty low berths are also ejectable in a large powered module,
allowing for the entire compliment to escape a doomed vessel.
  For offensive power, the Atlantis has two laser turrets and
two missile launchers. The missile launchers are standard
triple tube launchers, capable of launching standard missiles.
The lasers, however, are large single-barreled weapons giving
the Atlantis a long range energy punch. All of the weapons retract 
into the hull to provide a undisturbed surface for stealth 
purposes.
  The harshest criticism of the Atlantis is its armor - or more
properly, the lack of armor. Compared to ships of the line, the
Atlantis is rather fragile, being vulnerable to even turret
lasers. The vessel is intended to rely on its stealth and ECM
to avoid danger.
  Atlantis class vessels are named after mythical, fictional,
or "lost" cities from early Earth history. Other vessels
include Shangri-La, Asgard, Olympus, Rivendell, and Zinj.

It can skim, but according to the hull form (and book 2) it was unable to 
land on a planet.

We weren\'t carrying equipment to measure radiation, but none of us have
suffered any of the typical symptoms of radiation exposure (hair loss,
vomiting, burns).  The guy who got the closest to the unidentified items
was probably in the best health before, during, and after the trip (and

As the illustration shows in Adv. 7.  But, Garda-Villis, IIRC, has a 
breathable atmosphere and Broadsword was mentioned to be grounded at the 
starport.

Why should it?  Americans mix terms all the time.  Volts, Watts, and Amperes
are all metric units, and used in this country.

That\'s ok.  The supertanker has only a few percent of the available power of a
starship.

Actually, its the same as the thrust I guessed.  I just assumed a 200 t ship
weight 2,000 tons.

If ships are capable of evasive action, there\'s a damn good point to making
the main thrusters steerable in exactly this way; even a 5 degree slew would
be enough.

So?  Weight is irrelevant, momentum is what matters.

I think our references are both very obscure, at least to one another. 
Now I\'m reminded of The Night of the Generals (by Hans Helmut Kirst, I
think), in which a German intelligence officer tries to figure out which
general raped, mutilated, and murdered a French woman during the
occupation.  Apparently three visited her on the same night.  The
intelligence officer is Inspector Grau, who has appeared as an NPC in my
Traveller universe from time to time.

Well, its only impossible if its really a reaction drive.  Thus \'violates conservation of momentum\'.

Actually, it will superheat the air, creating in effect a fusion-powered jet
effect.  That _would_ work, though it would require somewhat special design
for the drives.

I haven\'t read KDS; if it tries to use explosives it carries
up with itself, then the specific impulse is lousy.  TNT has Isp(vacc)
of around 190 or so; good non-hydrogen (LOX/Kerosene, Tetroxide/Hydrazine)
liquid fuel engines get up to 340, good \'conventional\' solids get up
to 310 or so, and hydrogen/oxygen burners get up to 460.

You can get a pretty good tankage fraction out of an explosive kick
vehicle as the explosives are solid and don\'t need a tank (just some
sort of aeroshell, mostly).  Getting to a mass ratio of 10 might be
practical, which would get you around 4,300 m/s.  I don\'t know what
orbital velocity was on the KDS world, but that\'s not enough for
most habitable planets...

Err... the ship weighs a _lot_ more than a 200 tons.  so the acceleration 
is even less... but even if it did weight 200 tons, .024m/s2 is only .002G, 
nothing compared to the multi-G drives of Traveller ships.  Remember that 
the supertanker can do much, much less than a G of acceleration...

Again, it comes down to how strong the attitude jets are...

Comrade Hudson, the plot is working. Your slogan for the revolution has
been adopted by the unknowing and has permeated the consiousness of the
TML. At last we can have revenge, at last we can reveal ourselves to the
Templars.... Keven is subverted, and soon Legate will be too.

All those units predate the metric system. Their SI _definitions_ are
based on metric measurements (mks system or maybe cgs, I forget which),
as are joules,ergs, etc, but the only truly _metric_ system units are
meters (distance) or grams (mass). 

One definition of an ampere, in fact, is a _chemical_ term: one amp = 1
mole of electrons, 6.02 x 10^23 electrons.

I looked them up in my handy-dandy Microsoft Bookshelf and got:

Ampere:

A unit in the International System specified as one International
coulomb per second and equal to 0.999835 ampere.

Coulomb:

The meter-kilogram-second unit of electrical charge equal to the
quantity of charge transferred in one second by a steady current of one
ampere.


Hrmmm, I must have a Pentium Dictionary...

Huh?  Ok, if you want to distinguish SI from metric I suppose.  However, those units _are_ SI units.

One joule = 1 kilogram meter/second = 1 coloumb-volt.
One watt = 1 joule/second = 1 ampere-volt.

That would be mol, not mole, and is also a SI unit (1 mol is a number of grams of a material equal to its molecular weight)

As the illustration shows in Adv. 7.  But, Garda-Villis, IIRC, has a 
breathable atmosphere and Broadsword was mentioned to be grounded
at the starport.

IMO this was either an error, or the ship was "grounded" at a highport.
Garda-Villis\' starport is class B, so this should be a city-sized 
orbital installation - and if the situation on Garda-Villis was really so
bad, it should not be a problem for rebel infiltrators or sympathizers
to be present at the highport.

This gives you the questions like why the mercs were using ground
vehicles, or how the baddies got a ...never mind, I don\'t want to spoil

Err... the ship weighs a _lot_ more than a 200 tons.  so the acceleration 
is even less... but even if it did weight 200 tons, .024m/s2 is only .002G, 
nothing compared to the multi-G drives of Traveller ships.  Remember that 
the supertanker can do much, much less than a G of acceleration...

Again, it comes down to how strong the attitude jets are...

Well, at least in GT, _all_ ship drives are assumed to be vectored 
thrust.  In fact, a ship built without would suffer massive penalties... 
But even disregarding GT...

even .1g is still 10-100 times more than the wind effects above.

And that\'s the crux of the matter, IMHO.  Just how strong are those 
maneuvering/attitude thrusters?  (I\'m going to use GT as that\'s all I have 
handy right now...)  A 5,000 ton Young Assault Tender (GT:SM, p73) is 
approximately 101 meters long (it\'s about 27-7-7 proportions according to 
the book illustrations.  It\'s actually longer, but this should be close 
enough)   and 27 meters across.  It\'s loaded mass is 24,180 tons or about 
29,000 metric tons.

According to the combat rules, any ship can do a 180 turn in a single, 
20-minute combat turn.  So we can do a rotation of pi radians in 1200 
seconds.  The relevant equation is:

theta=.5 alpha*t ^2(theta is angular displacement, alpha is angular 
acceleration)

pi=.5 alpha (1200)^2
alpha=4.4e-6 rad/s2

the torque is:
tau=I*alpha (tau is torque, I is moment of inertia)

for a cylinder rotating around it\'s middle with the axis perpendicular to 
the axis of rotation,
I=1/4MR^2+1/12ML^2
I=.25*29e6*(27)^2+.083*29e6*(101)^2
I=30e9

tau=30e9*4.4e-6

tau=132000 Nm

to get the force back,

tau=F*x (where x is the lever arm, in this case, half the ship length)

132000=F*50.5

F=2613N

F=Ma

so,
a=9e-5m/s=9e-6G

so, assuming my math is correct, the thruster only needs to put out 
.0000009G.  That means that, in fact, wind is a huge factor, and will 
tumble the ship out of control.

Would someone double check my math please?  This doesn\'t look right, and I 
don\'t have my good calculator handy....

No, according to the combat rules a ship can do _at least_ a 180 degree turn
-- you just can\'t measure more than 180 degrees.

However, a vectored thrust ship in GT can dodge, with a bonus based on its
Gs.  According to GURPS Vehicles, dodging requires a 15 degree/second change
in direction (though the ship itself doesn\'t turn that fast, that\'s why you
have vectored thrust).  That\'s roughly 1/4 of the directional Gs of the ship,
and is plenty for overcoming air resistance.

Basically, any ship capable of evasion needs _substantial_ turning ability, or
substantial vectored thrust effects.  I\'m not terribly familiar with all of the
starship combat rules in Traveller, but certainly in High Guard ships could
dodge.

Part I:
The main problem is not being torn apart by the winds (which are faster than the 35 mph being bandied about here) aloft,  it\'s being torn apart by the aerodynamic forces acting on the hull once tumbling begins.  Once tumbling begins, the ship is subjected to air pressure based on its speed relative to the air around it.

Part II:
A lot less force is required to rotate an object around its center of mass than it does to start the object moving in a straight line (hint:  you are not accellerating the entire mass equally, the center is hardly being accellerated at all).  Anybody feel up to calculating torques and moments of revolution?

Part III:
It appears from all of the calculations being thrown about that landing a ship under power in an atmosphere is possible if it descends slowly enough and the winds aloft co-operate.  This would not be a casual affair attempted everyday, but it would be possible, if risky.

While the winds can be significantly faster than that, the high speed winds
are also mostly at high altitudes and thus significantly lower pressure.  In
any case, we\'re mostly talking about landing under contragravity, at quite low
speeds.  Given the overall structural strength of a typical traveller
starship, being torn apart is essentially a nonissue, if you can evade at 6 Gs
you\'re way too tough to worry about being damaged by wind.

Nah, it requires a different kind of force.  It\'s true that a strangely shaped
ship (close or open structure) will be subject to substantial torque, but many
unstreamlined ships are basically shaped like large bricks, and aren\'t going to
be terribly unstable.

It depends a little bit on how contragravity works.  Landing under thrusters
is potentially quite tricky, since that\'s negatively stable.  Landing under
contragravity should be fairly simple, unless you\'re completely without power.

I\'m still not convinced of that, although between Leonard\'s analysis of

That\'s ok, IMHO that\'s not a major factor for civilian operations (when a 
jump takes a week, a few hours on either end aren\'t _that_ 
significant.  I\'m not talking courier work here)

Again, that\'s ok.  A given spaceline would standardize to one type of ships 
and need only one type of cradle.

Now that I have trouble buying.  You are talking about putting in a whole

If a landing is possible, the takeoff shouldn\'t be any difficult...

Again, I recognize the fact that in the OTU the highport/interface craft 
model is the one used.  I\'m just trying to figure out why...

Now that I have trouble buying.  You are talking about putting in a whole

A cargo shuttle built for interface work will probably be better at it
than a jump ship that isn\'t, even if a kludgy way can be worked
out to let an unstreamlined ship land. And don\'t forget, a world with

a sizeable offworld population already, asteroid miners and whatnot.
They\'ll need these shuttlecraft even when no interstellar traders are

In particular the AESA & PESA costs alone exceed the book price of the bridge.
I have allowed for the ten times range factor for non-atmosphere use and the
long range price formula but I cannot make them match. 

e.g. GTL10 Basic bridge (GT price : MCr 4.0)

Traveller has 3 levels of Streamlining, and these three DIFFER from edition

CT Bk5: USL PSL SL

USL - Unstreamlined
PSL Partially Streamlined
SL Streamlined
AF Airframe

I have always interpreted the MT USL as "Not designed for surviving high
winds, and incapable of withstanding reversed skin pressurizations for long
periods. Not to mention not having landing gear"

 As for landing ships, under MT, where the T-plates can generate thrust
(diminishing in ammount) in any direction, I\'ve allowed some USL designs to
"Float down" (The Lord Baltimore is a bad ship to land this way). They
Entered in a nose up attitude, Matching the local gravity (0.9G) this left
0.05G for lateral vectors (90 deg from forward gets 50% thrust, IIRC)
without overpowering the drives. Which, BTW, MT T-plates can do... up to
400% for short times. I also required 4 Formidable piloting rolls, 4
difficult engineering rolls, and a computer roll (To lock out the computer
safety ovverrides), plus 4 determination rolls (Easy, Routine, Difficult,
formidable) for all the crew working to keep up with the stress. All but
hte determination checks were hazadous, fateful.

The problems of wind shear are also interesting... Since thrust acts on
mass in MT/TNE/T4, and TNE CG negates WEIGHT, not mass, slow wafting down
with the expected 4-12 Tons Metric mass per Td, the g levels are coverable,
provided you don\'t have a variety of odd structures sticking out.... that
will make you spin more surely than off-center thrust. Or, if you go too
fast, you lose them.

starship, being torn apart is essentially a nonissue, if you can evade at 6
Gs you\'re way too tough to worry about being damaged by wind.


As we all seem to agree, the problem indeed isn\'t the risk of being torn
apart by the winds. The winds just start the tumbling process which, unless
the craft is stable (we\'re assuming not being stable is part of what makes
it USL) or is actively stabilised by a system with sufficiently high thrust
and low latency to compensate in real time (again, I\'d assume this wouldn\'t
normally be present on a USL ship although it *could* be installed in
theory) can increase substantially - enough to tear a craft apart.  I\'ve
seen aircraft type-test simulations which illustrate this quite nicely.

Modern fighters are capable of withstanding 7-9G evasive manoevring if the
aerodynamic forces are carefully controlled (ie direct pull-up) but it\'s
still possible for one to shred itself in flight in the event of a
catastrophic control failure. Or, of course, to fall out of the sky
altogether - equally catastrophic.

shaped ship (close or open structure) will be subject to substantial torque,
but many unstreamlined ships are basically shaped like large bricks, and
aren\'t going to be terribly unstable.


Keeping this scientific, it doesn\'t require a different kind of force to
turn a body at all. It requires a moment, which is just a force applied at a
distance from a pivot (in this case, the centre of mass).

On a second point - a brick is not an aerodynamically stable shape. Compare
a paper dart in flight with a brick in flight. If the nose of both is lifted
slightly, the dart\'s nose will be flipped back down again by aerodynamic
forces (it is stable in that configuration) whereas the brick\'s nose will
not.

Well, you only measure heading at the end of a turn.  Your heading, from beginning to end of turn, cannot change by more than 180 degrees -- because a 270 degree change is a 90 degree change in the other direction.

True, your scalar heading change cannot exceed 180 degrees, but (for
example) a 270-degree turn is a widely used way of describing a 90 degree
turn taken the long way around.

Ugh, where\'s my copy of Halliday & Resnick when I need it...

My failing memory seems to recall that an amp is defined in terms of the
current required to achieve a certain attractive (or repulsive) force in
a pair of wires of a given size suspended a certain distance apart... it\'s
too damn hard to measure all those electrons zipping by.

Ah-ha! All praise AltaVista... from
http://www.sp.se/pne/ElectricalMetrology/ElMeteng/dccurrent.htm :

The ampere is that constant current which, when maintained in two parallel
infinitely long rectilinear conductors of negligible circular section placed
at a distance of 1 metre apart in vacuum, produces between these conductors a
force of 2x10-7 newton per metre length.

Everything comes back to meters, seconds and kilograms, eventually.

Isn\'t this a bit of a circular argument. If you intend a USL ship to
land you must surly have programmed the computer. Not that I would
like to be in a USL ship attempting to land in either case.  Maybe we should 
compare the risk of landing USL ships with the (rigid) Zeppelins of the 30is 
and 40is. Usually safe but not a good idea under some (most) conditions.

</serious>
Clearly this outrageous practise of operation of unsafe starships must be a 
flagrant breach of the Imperial Safety Regulation on the Operation of 
Atmospheric Craft. (or ISRotOoAC for short)
<serious>

Maybe we should split streamlining into two steps.
1. USL, SL or AF.
2. Landing or no landing.

Oh and while I remember it:
Shouldn\'t FFS allow for designs with limited access space say for example 
fighters. You could ump the effective volume by say 25-50%, increase repair 
time and/or diff mods (having to use access panels or remove the parts). 
Maybe a size limit on the ship.

What do you think?

Varian\'s training was a guess on my part.  Lucan\'s training is canonical.

There\'s \'nearly undefeatable\' and there\'s \'nearly undefeatable\'.  Somebody 
who\'s highly connected to the local politics and can get away with just about 
anything is one thing.  An entity that takes the death of hudreds to 
thousands to defeat is another.

	It depends on just how slow the ship has to move, and how deep

	I\'m assumimg that the highport is not built just for this

	build streamlined ships in free-fall.  How are the

	I\'m with you there, and am just throwing out some ideas as

If I remember my Basic Electricity and Electronics courses, one 
amp is produced by one coulomb of electrons passing a given point 
in 1 second.  I "believe" there 6.24 x 10^18 electrons in one 
coulomb.  One electron has the charge of  1.602 x 10^(-19) 
coulomb so the inverse of this gives the first number.  

Wow!  Those energy weapons pump out a lot of electrons!

Why so many?

A single 5DT long term life pod should be able to support 12 people (5DT SL,
cockpit, 0.5 manouver, 3 low berths, 12 seats).

You could use advanced armour to lighten the ship, and allow more armor for the
same performance.

You could use a heavy or a very heavy frame to double or quadruple hit points.

Except most systems should have battery backup, and batteries are all over the
ship, so Grav Pong is still an option. I also put a few minutes battery backup
in all my thruster modules.

Also sneaky is powering up the missile rectionless thrusters inside the turrets.
In GT they have 1800 lbs of thrust each and there are 77 in a magazine so
potentially they could move you at a small fraction of a G for an hour, or
simply give you an unpredictable spin. Just remember to turn the self-detonation
warhead off!. Hmm, how hard is a hardpoint?

Command  11 MCr (GT 9.6)

In particular the AESA & PESA costs alone exceed the book price of the bridge.
I have allowed for the ten times range factor for non-atmosphere use and the
long range price formula but I cannot make them match. 

e.g. GTL10 Basic bridge (GT price : MCr 4.0)

Item       Range   lbs   cf     Cr        kw  comments
AESA       10000  7500  150  2,625,000  2500  ten times range in space

I don\'t think batteries require access space. Certainly none of the examples in
GV gives them any. I think it only applies to power generation systems.

> is my math correct in figuring that the TL 10 maneuver module requires 4000 KW 

Yes.

Note that there is a lot of empty space in a GTL10 thruster module (92 cf). 
You could actually get 49 stons of thrust in the space available (69
unvectored), or a lot of
batteries, oh yes and some CG ;-)

    'body' => 'Thrusters in GURPS Traveller are designed to give nice round numbers, to
make ship construction simple. If you design the thrusters from scratch
using GURPS Vehicles you find that you can fit quite a bit more thrust in
the space available. For example the TL10 Thruster module produces 40 tons
thrust. You can actaully fit 49 tons worth of thruster, and associated
fusion power, in the space available. So 40 tons was chosen as a nice round
number to make hand designs easier.

On top of this all thrusters in GT use vectored thrust. This imposes a 50%
space, volume and cost penalty over unvectored thrusters. The reasoning
being that ships can land and hover if using vectored thrust. Space combat
dodge also relies on vectored thrust.

However I can see no reason why you can\'t use a small amount of vectored
thrust for manouvering, and have the rest unvectored as forward propulsion.
In space it will not affect you ability to manouver. If your craft is going
to enter atmosphere then why not install contragravity units for lift to
enable you to land or to hover. CG is cheap, small, light and requires
hardly any power.

The only exception I can see to this is for atmospheric fighters, where you
want a zero stall speed. If you provide the lift for this with CG then
enemy gravitic sensors might be a problem. Though even here you only need to
provide one G of vectored thrust and the rest can be unvectored.

New Thruster Modules

Here are some new thruster modules designed using GURPS Vehicles.

The Composite Thruster modules each contain appropriate components to
provide vectored and unvectored thrust, contragravity lift, fusion power
slice, and battery backup for about one minutes emergency power.

TL9 Composite Thruster Module

       Thrust  5.8 tons (0.8 vectored)
      CG Lift  11.6 tons
        Mass   4.16 tons
        Cost   1.21 MCr

TL10 Composite Thruster Module

       Thrust  65 tons (9 vectored)
      CG Lift  130 tons
        Mass   4.21 tons
        Cost   0.21 MCr

TL11/TL12 Composite Thruster Module

       Thrust  130 tons (20 vectored)
      CG Lift  260 tons
        Mass   4.26 tons
        Cost   0.30 MCr

     TL11 and TL12 use the same thrusters and fusion power figures.

TL13 Composite Thruster Module

       Thrust  360 tons (60 vectored)
      CG Lift  720 tons
        Mass   4.39 tons
        Cost   3.31 MCr

The Short Term Access Thruster modules are composite thruster modules with
only short term access maintenance spaces available. These should only be
used for short duration craft (e.g. fighters, shuttles, lifeboats). They
have to be maintained on the ground or in a full space dock.

TL10 Short Term Access Thruster Module

       Thrust  100 tons (8 vectored)
      CG Lift  100 tons
        Mass   6.28 tons
        Cost   0.31 MCr

TL11/TL12 Short Term Access Thruster Module

       Thrust  200 tons (19 vectored)
      CG Lift  200 tons
        Mass   6.33 tons
        Cost   0.44 MCr

At TL10 and TL12 Standard Armor increases armor mass by 50 percent and reduces

Using Standard Armor allows you to create slightly cheaper merchant craft. The
saving isn\'t very large but it is enough to make economic sense.

At TL10 and TL12 Advanced Armor costs three and a third times as much. At TL10
it saves 40% of the armor mass. At TL12 it saves 37.5% of the armor mass.

Advanced Armor is normally only available late in a TL, and is available to the
military first. Using Advanced Armor bumps up the price. On large heavily
armored ships it typcially saves enough mass to add an extra G or two to its
performance, or you can have more armor for the same perfomance.

Hit points are very important to combat craft, they should have heavier frames.

  Light  - Hardly ever - perhaps on small, low G, low usage craft (e.g.
           lifeboats) 
  Medium - All commercial craft, some military auxiliary craft.

I think he understood the British meaning, but hoping that it meant
something different to Americans. Also, when used to refer to someone else,
wanker is quite a strong derogatory term, with a bitter undertone. If you
simply want to convey that the said person etc is a bit odd / acting in an
idiotic way etc, you would probably use plonker. As in "You plonker,
Rodney!" (or nutter, or weirdo, or a myriad other terms)

all the other calendar systems.  My problem is that there are discrepancies
in all the canon sources I can find.

I often find that either several different dates are used for the same
corresponding date in the Imperial calendar, or that using the day/year
length of one calendar it soon (that is over a thousand years or so) gets
significantly out of step with published dates.

I\'m assuming that 001-0000 is a Jan 1st in the Solomani calendar (despite
the canon date of Jan 9th that I\'ve seen mentioned before), as the Imp
calendar obviously derives from the Solomani based Sylean calendar (365 days
of 24 hours etc, but \'tidied up\' and standardised, hence no leap years).  It
would make sense for Cleon to have announced his new calendar some months in
advance and stated that Jan 1 5xxx would be 001-0000. Does this make sense?
I now just need a definite year for the 5xxx.

I\'m also going to assume that \'miracle of miracles\', 00:00 hours 001 - 0000
is also the start of a new day (ie 00:00 equivalent) in all the other
systems. It won\'t necessarily be the start of a new year in those systems
though.

Sorry, guess I was unclear. You send me a concept, along with a general
description, Something along the lines of:

Concept: 400 dton sub merchant, GTL10, jump 2-3, good acceleration

The Snartlebart is a general-purpose merchant intended to service
less-travelled routes in the Somomani Confederation. While larger than most
tramp traders it uses the extra space to improve performance not capacity.
As with most Solomani subsidized merchants, the Snartlebart is intended for
use as a naval auxiliary during wartime.


I\'ll then design the ship to GT rules, and then email you back the
completed design for a final check. This gives you a chance to point out
where I made any mistakes ("Yeh, you nut, you forgot the jump drive!").
Once we\'ve got the design hammered out (as far as possible with GT) we
release it.

Someone stated the same thing I\'m going to say as relates to LTA craft like
dirigibles. Wind, weather, atmospheric disturbances all conspire to make you
USL craft a pile of debris on the ground. Obviously this is not true of
spacecraft that can survive skimming a GG. I\'d say any craft that can skim
refuel can probably land on a planet with an atmosphere.  All my USL craft
cannot skim fuel and they don\'t land on planet, crash maybe, but not land.

Just duplicate the above experiment ;).  Sort of like computing the length of a meter by yourself by measuring the distance light travels in 1/299,792,458 of a second (last I knew, that\'s the standard meter).

Yeah it is; it also impossible to figure out with official SI definition you
present, with those infinitely long, infinitely thin wires...see what happens
when you let physicists and <ptooi> _mathematicians_ into the club! Yeesh,
pretty soon they\'re off making up definitions that are impossible to verify in
the real world, so us messy chemists and engineers just have to slog along in
our burnt, smelly, multicolored, toxic lab coats. ;-)

I have a real challenge for you! 

How about a mixed technology ship in the 1 - 2 thousand ton range. What
I\'m picturing is a Gypsy ship made from add ons to a 2 Imp cruiser. I
have a group of wanderers that refused to give up space during the long
night. Since that time they\'ve lived in a small fleet by cannibalizing
they\'re own wrecks and any other ships they could find. After the
formation of the 3 Imp they continues they\'re ways and are a staple (if
somewhat shady) encounter through out most areas of Charted Space.

Ships should be less than Jump 3, with moderate maneuvering. USL is
probably the best configuration. Beyond that, well they are a mongrel.

Also in GT: Behind the Claw, the reference on p66 for Tionale has a 
Broadsword landing on the planet and being captured and it has a

20 bays and 100 turrents (unallocated)
Logistical modulas (to represent space manufacturing facilities)
1/2 of the space allocated to cargo
5 Spacedocks.
Manouver drives (mainly station keeping [I calculated around 940] , but

1 engineering modual

I envision this to look like a Cylon Base Star, with the spacedocks on the

central core.

Doesn\'t matter. All that Tranian needs to know is that Strephon is away
from Capital on important state business, if he\'s that anti-psionic the
exact details of the reason for Strephon\'s absence can be left out. Heck
for that matter Dulinor should have been told before his audience with
Strephon too! After all, he\'s an Archduke of the Imperium, if you can\'t
trust an Archduke with state secrets who can you trust.

Its not, its just an assumption on my part. Hmmm, if Varian had been

Very true, but this is what distinguishes the great from the competant. A
great leader would have put their grief aside and acted desisively. Strephon
did not. When faced with crisis he faltered (very badly). Strephon was so
badly affected that he had to be sedated and sent to bed, then abdicated
responsiblity to his aides. These are not the actions of a great man.

No, to put it bluntly, Strephon was not an ordinary man. He was leader of
the Third Imperium and as such had responsibilities. He abdicated those
responsibilities. Or in other words "The buck stops here".

You can get 892,857,142 kWs in 1 dTon.  This is enough to run a 
(notice I said, "a" as in one)  Thruster Module for 62 hours, 2 for 31 
hours, 4 for 15.5 hours, etc.

IMTU, I would treat it as a "portable battery."  As such, it needs to 
be treated as a Body with Medium Frame and Standard Materials, 
comes to :

25.38 sTons
5.019 MCr
1 space

Recharging is a problem.  I did some rough calculations and found 
you would need a triple laser turret\'s reactor to recharge one in 
about 5 minutes.  Put too many of these on a ship and you will be 
spending a lot of time recharging.  I did toy around with the idea of 
putting a rx slice with it for recharging purposes, but decided against 
it due to the fact that there isn\'t a whole lot of power vs weight 
available.

SOM says yes.  Not exactly a flash, but there is light and presumably other
emissions  "When a ship comes out of jump ... first there\'s a blue glow,
then the ship appears out of nowhere, and the glow fades a little so you
can see the grid lines, and then they\'re wiped out one by one."

Also, GT confirms that this is not forbidden canon. "A ship /leaving/ jump
also emits a detectable pulse of energy.  It is possible to determine the
approximate size of the ship, and the time it entered the system." (GT:121)

Hope that helps.

A recommendation, if I may?

Change your firm\'s name, ASAP.  "X-Tech Maximus" is _far_ too close to

Taneian naval doctrine. Life pods are designed for long-term periods - thus
the design is:
    5 ton SL
    Hardened Cockpit
    Maneuver
    4 Low Berths

You are correct that for a mere escape vessel, you can design a better ship.
These pods allow the crew to escape and remain in stasis until recovery - in
some cases, that could be hours, days, or even weeks.

Just a design decision. Of course, the most efficient thing would be to
follow the Imperial Naval method and have no escape vessels - but I prefered
this idea, and it fits in with the culture/society/doctrine of the Taneis
Covenant (the government this ship belongs too).

True, but I was simply using the stock GT rules, and didn\'t even bother with
specific armor types...might have to look into that...

The CT Creed: "There is no Game but Traveller, and High Guard is its\' Product"

  <ahem>  Comrade Hudson has been re-educated and is now a productive citizen
of Serendip (gov\'t type 5; describe fully in three rants or less :> ). Please 
be advised that in addition to the dodgy theology advanced by cheap rip-offs
there is a risk of brand infringement once MiniTru & SoCo-AgitProp decide
which of them gets the trademark; admittedly as both sides still have multiple
surviving Permanent Under-Secretaries this is not an immediate concern.

    OK.  Got one.
    If the Battle Rider idea can work for military ships, why not for
merchant shipping?
    What I would like to see is this:

The Sharlin class Merchant Tender
Concept:  50,000 dton USL merchant tender, CT TL 13 (I do not know what the
GTTL is, sorry, Rob), jump 3 or 4, & 1 g of acceleration.

    The Sharlin is a bold concept in Merchant shipping, using the idea of
the Battle Rider tender the Sharlin carries 5 Tebryn class Mechant Ships.
Used in the 3I on major Trade Routes.  By using the Battle Rider Concept,
the 5 Tebryn class vessels while still jump capable, are also able to be
dropped off to service planets in the area.
    While service on a Sharlin is a long & hard duty, the crews enjoy their
status as truely far traders, as they go from one end of the 3I to the
other.
    Sub Craft:  several Type S Scouts, several shuttles, and a few fighters.
    Passengers:  between 1,000 to 5,000.
    Defenses:  Good, as the Zho, Alsan, & Solomani would love to get their
hands on one of these ships.
    Extras:  Able to refine its own fuel.

The Tebryn class Merchant Ship
Concept:  10,000 dton SL merchant ship, CT TL 13, jump 1 or 2, good (2 or
3g) acceleration

    The Tebryn is a standard large Merchant ship, but built to be used with
the Sharlin class Merchant Tender.  As a Sharlin moves across a sub-sector,
the Tebryns will go off the main track to trade with other systems nearby.
    Sub-Craft:  A few Type S Scouts, shuttles, and a few fighters.
    Passengers:  between 100 to 500
    Defenses:  Good.
    Extras:  Able to refine its own fuel.

    Rob if you can get a few more passengers on the Sharlin, that would be
great, & a military version of the Sharlin & the Tebryn might also be a nice
idea.
    The idea is that when the Nobles go to Capital, they will take Sharlins
there, so they are very high-class ships & should have the room to take a
few yachts & other noble-owned ships onboard.
    For example, a Sharlin will start off at Regina (for the Trip to
Capital) & all the nobles in the area will converge on Regina, for the trip
to Capital.  As the Sharlin & it\'s Tebryns move along the space lanes more &
more nobles join up with it, either at starports & board directly, or they
dock with it, using their yachts.  I can see this ship as one, durring this
time at least, that the nobles will be plotting against each other, & the
players could be involved either in doing the dirty work, protecting a
noble, or as a crew member.
    Durring war-time, these ships are easily turned into Troop carriers for
the Army.  But, there might be a dedicated Troop Carrier, if Rob creates it.
    I hope I have given you enough information to work with Rob.

Hmmm, perhaps he WAS told, but didn´t care. Maybe he thought that shooting
the clone would have the 
same effect as no-one knew that the man he shot was the clone, namely
allowing to take control (a plan which backfired as we all know).

One question:

What would be the economic benefit from building such a ship?

Admittedly, AuricTech Shipyards will be _more_ than happy to design such
a ship and build it (using either HG2 or FF&S2).  All you need to do is
pay us.  (Note:  in TML credits, expressing appreciation for a design is
considered payment.)

Your shareholders/bankers/whoever else is putting up the money to build
this ship are concerned with one thing:

Will this make me a larger profit than other ways of investing my
capital?

Considering that the AuricTech _Electra III_ yacht has Jump-4, 4-G
performance, at a cost of only MCr 824.07, I would think that most
nobles who would need to travel to Capital would have ships of similar
performance, and would not need to hitch a ride on a _Sharlin_.

Further, were I a noble of such stature that I needed to travel to
Capital, I would be loathe to expose myself to the hazards you describe
below....

Such a ship would, at least, be immune from the profit analysis required
of a purely civilian vessel.  I could see a government providing a
subsidy for a tender capable of providing wartime services.  However, I
doubt that such a ship could earn its keep in peacetime, as a merchant
vessel.

I would gladly change my mind, if the economic numbers work out....

    Well, not all Mega-Corps are going to be able to use Free Traders, Far
Traders, & Sub. Merchants to carry its cargo, so they will need a large ship
to do that, right?  And, why not this one?  If this ship has say, Jump 4, it
could cross the rifts so Sector Trade can be carried out.  This ship should
also beable to carry enough High Passage passengers to turn this ship into a
true luxury liner.
    Also, why are there so few cargos & passengers?  This ship could be one
of the reasons.  Megacorps will not use Free/Far Traders 7 Sub. Merchants to
carry their cargo, would they?

    Easy, these ships, the Sharlin & Tebryn can cover a sub-sector in about
2 monthes & that means if say, AuricTech Shipyards needed 100,000 tons of
metals, would you rely upon c. 2,000 Free Traders or a few larger ships?
The profit in this ship will be in bulk cargos & passengers, just like the
real world.  *weg*

    True, but then are not nobles, in general, a petty lot?  Always wanting
to show off their wardrobes & finery?  Do they not want to advance their
Houses at the expense of other Noble Houses?  You cannot do that while you
are alone, can you?  A yacht is fine for short range travel, but say you are
on Regina & you have to get to Capital in style, comfort, & you want to one
up your enimes or make allies on the way there.
    "I say, my lord, Auric, did you see Baron Moony\'s wife last night in the
arms of that young Count Legate?  I hear they spent the night together."
Nobles love to gosip, an party together & the trip to Capital would be a
good time for them to do it.  Without having the bussiness of government get
in the way.  Along the way, fueds could end, start, marriages could be
brokered.  "I say, my lord, Prior, my daughter is 16 years old & I hear that
your son, Micheal, is 17, what would you say in use talking about joining
our two houses?", duels could happen, "Count Legate, you have slept with my
wife for the last time.  I challange you to a duel.", & other fun hijinks.

>Further, were I a noble of such stature that I needed to travel to
>Capital, I would be loathe to expose myself to the hazards you describe
>below....


    You maybe, but what about your enimes?  "Did you hear that Lord Auric is
going on his own yacht this year?"  "No, pity, his fortune must be gone."
    Rumors could start that because a certain lord or lady is not on the
ship, then something is wrong.  Also, again on the upside, alliances can be
made.  "Count Legate, may I talk to you?"  "Of course Lord Auric."  "Well, I
have a dicey problem, it seems Baron Prior has been trying to put me out of
business."  "So, how can I help you?"  "Well, I hear you have the best
household troops in the Ley Sector."  "So, what would it take for you to
\'loan\' me a battalion or two."  Sort of deal.  Not all nobles will be good
at everything.  So will be good shipbuilders, other will be good warriors.
This way, with them under one roof, so to speak, they will have time to
talk.  *weg*

Actually, without special supports, you\'d *ruin* the plane. It\'d
designed to have "push" applied from the location of the engine(s), as
well as various aerodynamicd streses.

Balance it on its tail, and the tail will crush (it wasn\'t design to
support the weight of the plane).

Aerodynamic forces occur in locations and directions that result in
*different* stresses than engine thrust does. That\'s *the* most basic
difference.

They only need to be big enough to turn the ship 180 degrees in a
"reasonable" amount of time. Which doesn\'t require a lot of power. 

Figuring out how much thrust is required requires know the moment of
inertia of the ship about the axis of rotation. That\'s a bit beyond my
abilities.

I read this and read this tender thing, and liked the idea greatly.

Benefits?

1)  Ideal for convoys, all vessels in the convoy would be assured of
reaching a given system at the same time.

2)  A non-jump capable merchant would be easier to maintain and cheaper to
purchase... however, the shared cost of the jump capability provided by the
tender *should* be low enough to make it financially feasible (but no
promises there! :)

3)  If the tender had couplings that were universal, that could take on
certain jump-capable vessels, then for a minor cost, a Type a, for example,
could jump via tender, then continue onwards immediately to another system,
thus extending it\'s capabilities/range?

Just the three that popped into my head of course.  There are probably r/l
economics that factor in to make it unfeasible, but otherwise, it makes
sense to me.

    Well, I tend to build a J-4 "Tender" & J-1 or J-2 "Riders".  So that the
"Tender" can move along on the main route & the "Riders" can vist systems
off the main route.

    True, or it could carry a few Scouts or X-Boats for communications.

    Correct, why not use the Battle-Rider & Battle-Tender idea for mechant
shipping?  Heck I can even see building a J-1 Tender & several non-jump
capaible Riders to go along with it.  Why not?  The Tender in this example
could be an open structure & it could carry 6 riders & in war-time, one of
those riders could be a true Battle-Rider.  Think about a commerce raider
who runs into a Battle Rider.  *weg*

Nope. Check my other message, where I point out that far *less* than a
g of thrust can turn a ship 180 in a very few seconds. Pivoting the
main drive *won\'t* change your COURSE any faster. And changing your
*heading* (facing) without changing your course is moderately pointless
as far as evasion goes. 

And by *not* pivoting the drive, you avoid some *very* massive
bearings, making various feed and control circuitry runs "flexible",
and you get to keep everything but the exhuast nozzle (if any) *inside*
the ship, where the engineers don\'t have to suit up to work on them.

Check out some of Willy Ley\'s stuff. I recall a book I had as a kid
(and wish I still had, I *loved* the illos) that had a ground to orbit
shuttle using jets, then ramjets, then "ram-rockets", and finally pure
rockets on the way up.

See my other message where I show that for a 200 meter long ship, it
takes 0.07 g to turn the ship 180 in 30 seconds. Plug the proper radius
(half length) into the formula and come up with your own figure. 

You *don\'t* use the main drive to turn.

And the only time vectored thrust is "needed" is for landing these

And I\'ve just shown today that the manuevering thrusters need *less*

I derived similar results by working from the equation for the
acceleration *induced* by rotating at a given radius with a given
period: 

a = 4*pi*2*r/t^2

So with your figures:

a = 4*pi*2*50.5/1200^2
a = pi*404/1.44e6
a = ~8.8e-4
a=~0.00088g

I get a much higher value for acceleration, but still far too little
for significant help against wind forces.

Another point. You can turn faster and with less stress on the hull by
using *paired* thrusters. The fire in opposite directions and are
either placed equally distant from the CG of the ship and are the same
strength, or, if the ship\'s CG is noticeably off center, they may be
placed as far as practical from the CG, and have their thrusts set to
provide equal "moment arms" (thrust * distance from CG). 

These will have problems compensating for wind force, because the wind
forces *aren\'t symettrical about the CG. :-)

BTW, so far we\'ve been considering *rotational* thrusters (yaw, pitch &
roll). Translational thrusters are what you use for making small
movements "up", "down", "right", "left", "forwards" and "backwards". 

Since these will be used for things like the final stages of docking to
a station or another shiupo, you want them to be inducing very *low*
velocities. Just consider what a multi-thousand ton mass ship can do
when it impacts at a "mere" meter per second. Ouch!

15 degrees is 1/24th of a rotation. Therefore we get a 24 second period
of rotation. Great. We now have a figure for the acell provided by the
thrusters.

a = acceleration (m/s)
r = radius of rotation (m)
t = period of rotation (s) 

You\'ve just "fixed" t at 24.

a = 4*pi*2*r/t^2

becomes

a = pi*r/72

So if the ship is 20 meters long, you need 0.04g of acceleration from
your thrusters to meet the turning specs for dodging.

Actually, as shown above, the requirements aren\'t all that
"substantial". 

ps. In actuality, moment of inertia (which depends *strongly* on shape,
and is a bear to calculate) will be required to determine the actual
*thrusts* involved. But the figures I\'ve given are correct for the
*acceleration*.

Nope. It has to have been programmed in advance by people considerably
different from the captain and crew of the ship. The required
programming requires info and calculations that the crew *won\'t* have. 

The equivalent of a bunch of wind tunnel tests, and control loop
calculations. Or detailed info on aerodynamics, the shape of the ship
(down to the millimeter level) and some really *massive* numerical
intergration.

Producing such a program is gonna get *expernsive*, and it\'ll be one of
the things involved in the cost of producing "streamlined" ships.
Another will be covering and securing all the pipes, conduits, control
runs, etc that could otherwise be left open to space.

Actually, the reason zeppelins and dirigibles went away isn\'t because
they were hard land. It\'s because they were *inherently* too flimsy to
withstand weather conditions that they weren\'t fast enough to outrun.
Read up on the Akron and the Shenendoah. They got ripped into large
pieces by the same sort of winds that throw jetliners out of the sky. 

Jetliners can be built stronger because they don\'t have to average out
lighter than air.

I think the real problem is that when you have things broken down into
USL, SL, and AF people are *reading* USL, but *picturing* SL. For
example, a *brick* is SL! It\'s got a regular shape and relatively
smooth surface.

Basicly, any building or "vehicle" that can survive medium to strong
winds without having to be tied down qualifies as "SL",

Stuff that gets flipped end over end or gets the odd shaped bits (or
exposed bits) ripped off is USL. 

It\'s *possible* to build an "SL" open structure (but far from easy!). 

In short:

AF	can *use* aerodynamic forces for steering or even lift
SL	won\'t be adversely affected by aerodynamic forces
USL	will be adversely affected by aerodynamic forces

And for ships that aren\'t *too* weirdly shaped, software may be able to
make an USL into an SL. But it ain\'t the sort of programming that
anybody but professionals can write. Well paid, experienced
professionals. 

It\'d take an awful lot of skill levels of various sorts (and "pilot"
*isn\'t* one of them!) before I\'d consider a program written by anyone
on the ship\'s crew to give any sort of chance of getting an USL ship
down safely. And it\'d have to be "borderline" USL.

There\'s an old Heinlein short story from the 40s that applies. "It\'s
Great to Be Back". Also check out "Columbus Was a Dope." I can\'t recall
what collection either is in, but they *should* be tracked down. They
both give *excellent* examples of how perceptions of "normal" are
likely to change.

*characters* might feel about things.

Sure. It\'s the *atmosphere* that\'s the problem. :-)

BTW, I just realized another "yipes!" effect that I don\'t think has
been mentioned in this or any previous discussion.

The mere act of passing thru the air, even at a low speed, can cause
several interesting effects. One is that suspended, supercooled water
droplets deposit on the hull as ice. *Heavy* deposits can build up
rather quickly. Far *too* quickly for the "ease the ship down slowly"
folks. 

A 200 ton ship has a *minimum* surface area of 937 m^2. Call it 1000
m^2. 1000 m^2 of area with a 1 mm thick coating of ice is an extra
*ton* of mass.

But most ships *aren\'t* spheres. So they\'ll *easily* have 10-100 times
as much surface area. Which gives us 10-100 tons *mass* of extra load
for every mm of ice. 

Oh yeah, it will melt from the radiators. And maybe re-freeze
elsewhere? :-)

BTW, were the ship\'s radiators atmosphere rated? Or will they catch
fire upon exposure to high levels of oxygen? Remember, those puppies
are *hot*. :-)

IIRC being out of sensor range of the primary world is possible with some of

A way I see this happening: the disgruntled mercs are leaving unpaid, and 
the incoming ship could be construed as property of the government
that just stiffed them. Only doable if the government in question has
just done some things themselves that will make them want Imperial
attention even less than a band of starmercs do.

Lets say the mercs didn\'t dare hang around the planet and blackmail the
government with what they know, but feel pretty safe getting a lick in on
the way out. The local gov\'t doesn\'t want Imperial agents asking 
questions, either locally or of that merc company, so they either
misrecord the data on the attacking ship, or cover up what happened
to the incoming merchant.

One of the problems I have with "opportunity piracy" is that IMO using a
multi-million starship to catch another is very much akin to wearing a
highly identifiable uniform when robbing a convenience store. A \'uniform\'
moreover that\'s worth considerably more than what you can expect to gain
from the crime.

You might answer that your example proves that some people are that stupid,
and I\'ll have to agree. But how many people owns a uniform? And how big a
perctentage of them are that stupid? How many people own a starship? And
how big a percentage of them are that stupid?

Heh...

Actualy X-TEK/Maximus is the partnership between X-TEK Industries and
Maximus Interstellar Defence Industries.  There will be no disintigration
for copyright infringement, this time ;->

The two companies decided to join together to combat FS \'Ditziemania\'.
With their own ad campaign using scantily clad females weilding weapons of
mass destruction.  (Hey it worked for beer commericals.<G>)

Unfortuneately much of the latest technologies from X-TEK were classified
by the Imperial Navy.  Any ship designs using that technology were also
classified.  Result was the suspension of the ad campaign for an
indetrminate amount of time.

(Real Life:  Some stuff I developed got submitted for G:T Starships.
Consequently I cannot post any of those modules or anything using them on
the website or the TML.  But after the books release, I should be able to
post some ship designs.)

Currnet Plans:

X-TEK/Maximus is planing a few new systems for development including the
Dragonfire Fusion Spinal,  remote gun-drones, rapid fire meson guns,
kamakaze robot fighters, and other insidious devices.

Rumors are that data has been found in the Commander\'s personal archives.
Thought lost after the civil war, the data details weapons used in a
future time, when machines turned against man.  It is believed that this
was a work of fiction, but some detailed design specs are included within
the "dark crystal"

Not really. This is true for an aircraft, because the aircraft
manuevers by generating aerodynamic forces against the hull. 

But for a spacecraft, changing "facing" and changing "direction of
travel" are uncoupled. You can change facing all day with *low* thrust
manuevering thrusters. To change *course*, you need the main drive. You
use the manuevering thrusters to change facing until the main drive is
pointed in the right direction, and then fire the main drive. 


But the acceleration required to rotate the (maximum) of 180
degreesisn\'t all that high.

	Acceleration on a cylinder (space colony, etc.) of radius r and
	    rotation period t:

	    a = 4 pi**2 r / t^2

Say that 30 seconds is enough time to rotate the ship 180 (which means
that 60 seconds is the rotation period), and the "radius" (distance
from the CG to the farthest point is 100 meters (*big* ship).

a = 4*pi*2*100/60^2
a = pi*800/3600
a = pi/4.5
a = ~.7 m/s^2

Or a bit over 7/100ths of a g. Lower the radius, and the acceleration
drops in direct proportion. Lower the period, and the accel increases
by the square of the difference. 

Let\'s see how fast we can whip it around to get 1 g at 100 meters.

9.8 = pi * 800/t^2
9.8*t^2 = pi*800
t^2 = pi*800/9.8
t^2 = ~256
t = ~16

So you can flip a 200 meter long ship end for end about it\'s long axis
in 8 seconds and only induce *one* g of accel.

I expect that most ships will do it a *lot* slower. More like the 30
second figure (which has the 0.07 g accel).

Well, I think the wind force can exert stronger forces than the
manuevering thrusters can. In which case structural failure *is*
possible.

But see my notes above. Spaceships are not and *will not* be braced for
that sort of strong side force, simply because it *can\'t* occur in
normal operation (or even in most "emergency" situations).

Actually, if the ship *is* "shaped like a brick", then, baring some
*really* off center mass distribution, it *is* "streamlined" in the
minimal sense.

I think that\'s the source of the arguments. People are *assuming* that
certain shapes are "unstreamlined", when in actuality such shapes
*would* be "streamlined" (and thus incur the extra cost). 

Take a good look at a tractor-trailer rig (a "semi"). *That* is
"streamlined"! 

So the fact that the ships didn\'t have the "Streamlined" bonus means
that they do *not* have that nice smooth surface you are picturing.
Instead, the *outside* of the hull looks like space just below the
ceiling in most manufacturing plants, or onboard non-passenger seagoing
vessels (ie a maze of pipes and conduit). Stuff that needs insulation
or shielding will have it, but nobody will bother with "prettying it up
by putting in a smooth sheet of metal over it. 

*That* is what the "cannot enter atmosphere" ships look like. No smooth
surfaces. Lots of projections, not braced against wind forces. And
which may tend to get bent or even torn off during atmospheric flight.

True enough. But the brick has "neutral stability". Which is sufficient
to avoid a lot of problems.

Ah, we may be debating two different types of USL here. To convert from
GURPS Traveller to Classic Traveller:

GT	CT/MT
SL	Airframe/Streamlined
USL	Partially Streamlined
see note	Unstreamlined

Note: Open frame and planetoid hulls (which I\'ve coded as OF and PL in 101
Starships) would be the CT USL hulls.

We had this debate over the battledress issue. I think there was a ruling
somewhere in there about how much area could be covered by the advanced
armours.

Remember that we\'re trying to model CT here, not min-max GURPS Vehicles.

I would add one other thing.  I would move the number of carried craft from 
5 to 6 and add two couplings capable of handling standard 30kt 
battleriders.  This would give the ship the potential to earn a subsidy 
from the system/subsector/sector/domain/or Imperial government as an armed 
auxiliary.  Instead of jumping a battle tender into a system just to drop 
off one or two riders for picket duty, you use one of these converted 
merchants.

So were the Vargr. ;-)

Actually, I\'ve always that _elements_ of the duplicate fleets were assigned
different postings based on the way the Imperial Admiralty perceived the
need to cover varying hot spots.

I envision squadrons being shuffled about rather often along the Vargr
Extents borders.

Well, they are NOT on the map in MT Rebelion SB, so they probably derive
from the solomani rim sectors of Magyar, Canopus, Aldebaran, Neworld, or
Alpha Crucis... or possibly from Reaver\'s deep.

One item I noted is that the 208th Fleet is not in imperial space (Spinward
Marches/SS M) but an imperial ally. In fact, the imperium is separated by
nearly a parsec.

This is where the economic problem arises, IMHO.  The tender is having
to use jump capacity to move a number of ships, each of which _also_ has
jump capability.  This strikes me as more costly than simply building an
equivalent capacity of regular freightliners, per dton of cargo moved.

OTOH, I\'m not an economist, so I could be wrong about this.

I doubt that the same cradle designed for a 10,000 dton freightliner
could be used to carry a 200 dton free trader.  (At least, I wouldn\'t
want to try it with _my_ ships!)

While there are universal docking umbilicals, I don\'t think that they
are suitable for securing a ship during a jump.

Here you\'re talking about a LASH configuration.  The economics for these

I allows you to trust bring a weapon to bear (or protecting damaged areas
of a ship, keeping sensors pointed in a certain direction, etc.) while
still thrusting in another direction.  Also, being able to change course on
the time scale of a few seconds is useful since that is the
timescale between targetting info and return fire.  Loosing
even half a second can make a difference.

I need a bit of help tracking down a book I had, but lost.  It dealt with a 
group of people, both military and civilian historians, going from the 
present day back in time to December of 1941.  The current president is 
suffering from cancer and is in critical condition when an archivist 
discovers some log books that show that an American researcher in the 
Philippines seems to have discovered the cure for cancer.  Two small 
problems...the rest of the notes are lost and the researcher himself 
disappeared during the Japanese invasion of the islands.  The heros use a 
modified 737 to travel back in time.

Alas, I\'ve lost the book, forgot the title and author, and am considering 
basing a scenario off of it in the future.

Considering how well read this list is, I was wondering if someone has read 
this and can lend a hand with the title.

Thanks!

That\'s fine if you own the ship, but what about the person whose ship is
owned by the bank, and has no money to pay.  What do you do after you skip.
For awhile you might be able to engage in commerce, as long as you stay
ahead of the skip chasers. What then?  Leave Imperial space? Is that really
likely to stop a good skip chaser? The Zhodani won\'t welcome a thief.  Vargr
space just means you\'ll be fighting off other pirates.  Doing business in
Aslan space requires contacts.  There\'s a few places that will buy cargoes
no questions asked. So you go into the life.
Then there\'s the traditional way. You\'re crew on a trader or Megacorp ship
with a real bad set of slavedriver officers, or perhaps the Megacorp is not
exactly the most employee friendly group. You and your shipmates decide you
have had enough. Mutiny! Now what? You put in at any standard starport and
there will be questions. You have the skills to run a ship for a long time,
if you can pay for the maintenance or get the spare parts. A captured ship
every now and again might let you scrape some kind of living on the low TL
worlds. As long as you can stay out of the way of the IN and the Colonial
SDB\'s.
You can add escaped criminals, losers in system wide warfare, and even
disenfranchised local despots and their troops.
Will they last long? Probably not. Most historical pirates ended up either
dead or in politics. (Several were granted pardon by the English Crown and
even appointed Governor of English holdings in the Caribbean.)

I didn\'t participate in that discussion. 
Looking back at the archives I see that someone made a handwave on this.
It doesn\'t hold water though. GT sidebar p155 discusses creating non-standard
hulls using the different armors available in G:Vehicles. In G:Vehicles there is
an example scout ship with composite armor. In G:Space it makes reference to
using different (unnamed) armor types as a mass/cost trade-off with no limit.

We?

I thought this was a forum for discussing all aspects of all versions of

or maintaining its "purity".

Right.  The question is, can the tumble be prevented...

Dunno, it depends on just how powerful the maneuvering thrusters are...  If 
they are on the order of .1G or higher, than this would seem to be an easy, 
routine maneuver.  If they are on the order of .01G, then yes, it\'s a risky 
but doable feat.  At anything less than that, it\'s nigh-impossible.

While the special purpose shuttle is more efficient, what\'s really gonna 
kill you (IMHO) is the extra loading/unloading required, both in terms of 
money and equipment/manpower.  Remember, pre-Suez canal, it was considered 
more efficient to sail all the way around Africa then to unload the ship in 
Egypt, bring them across the narrow isthmus there and reload to another 
ship in the Red Sea.  It\'s almost always preferable to keep the cargo on 
the same vessel for as long as possible.

Except that those shuttlecraft are already busy doing their own thing.  The 
company would need additional shuttles to do their on- and off- 
loading.  Whether it\'s actually purchasing extra shuttles or renting space 
on them for the duration, that\'s still pretty expensive.

This is where I have the problem - It seems to me that the normal 
maneuvering capacity of the ship is more than enough to deal with these issues.

Don\'t laugh.  I remember the old military manuals from when I was a kid 
(Dad was in the  Corps of Engineers) that had illustrations of attractive 
young females in a \'reduced uniform\' pointing out the technical aspects of 
the manual.

This was of course, in the old, non-PC days of the military, back when the 
O clubs had go-go dancers.

FASA spoofed this for some BTech manuals.

Not necessarily.  I can just as easily define an Ampere to be:

The ampere is that constant current which, when maintained in two parallel 
infinitely long rectilinear conductors of negligible circular section 
placed at a distance of 3.28 feet apart in vacuum, produces between these 
conductors a force of 1.4*10^-8 pounds per foot length.

(I may have gotten the values off a bit...)

Some units are clearly metric, as they are defined in terms of exact metric 
values.  However many units are just re-calculated to metric 
quantities.  For example, a Newton is a metric unit, as it\'s exactly on 
Kilogram-meter per second squared.  Other units, especially any that take a 
weird constant to calculate, are just units.  They can be expressed in 
metric or in customary.

The ship may or may not decide to stabilize; it probably wouldn\'t stabilize going nose-first, though (it will tend to stabilize heavy-end first.  This probably means that the fuel tanks wind up in the back).  If its going more than (terminal velocity)*sqrt(Gs) the hull almost certainly isn\'t strong enough; in practice I suspect even a considerably lower velocity would cause many forms of hulls to break apart, and small objects to break off.

Almost any ship can manage a \'meteor\' style landing, if you don\'t mind hitting the ground at several kilometers per second.

At a minimum, it can be prevented with a cheap and fairly fast retrofit.  Take a superdense bar 10x the length of the ship.  Point it towards the ground, outside of your contragrav envelope.  Add a weight at the end -- should be at least 0.1% of the ship\'s mass, which shouldn\'t be too hard.

That will provide enough torque to keep any moderate size ship from flipping over, though it could probably wind up with a 45 degree tilt at times.

Unfortunately, to allow _evasion_ (which High Guard allows, dunno about other rule systems) you need manuevering thrusters in the 1G range...otherwise you simply can\'t turn fast enough to be relevant while using lightspeed weapons.

I\'m not saying no highports.  I\'m just saying that a company that is able 
to land all it\'s freighters doesn\'t need to buy/rent a chunk of highport 
(presumably a high-price piece of real estate), or as much, anyway, it 
doesn\'t need as many shuttles, as much Vacc-Trained personnel, etc...

Presumably construction/maintenance still happens in orbit, but you don\'t 
need that in as many systems...

Think of it this way:

Let\'s say you are playing Gurps:Cliffhangers. Your GM might allow you

I would say that just as you wouldn\'t use Gurps:Supers to make (most)
Gurps:Cliffhangers characters, you wouldn\'t use every possible trick
in Gurps:Space, Gurps:UltraTech, and Gurps:Vehicles to make
Gurps:Traveller gear that is markedly different (i.e., more powerful)
than the starships, armor, weapons and vehicles that are part of
the standard Traveller setting. Such minimaxed equipment may be
fun to build, but it may also be as inappropriate in a (Gurps:)Travelller

Isn\'t this essentially an upgrade on the LASH ship from Far Trader?

Rob: that\'s actually a good Idea in general - do you have any Really Big 
freighter?  I\'m talking 50kdt+ here....

I don\'t see that.  IMHO, with the standard equipment on any spaceship this 
can be avoided.

Considering that even the scout masses several thousand tons, this isn\'t 
_that_ big a deal...

OTOH, they will be cooled much faster in atmosphere.  Conduction is much 
more efficient than radiation...

err. we don\'t need to do that anymore even today.  The Boeing 777 was 
designed entirely on the computer with virtual "wind tunnels".  A TL10-15 
shipboard computer should be able to do that very fast.

no, the program will be cheap.  All you need is detailed blueprints 
(already available) and a _lot_ of computing power.  Fortunately, at least 
in GT, there\'s plenty of that.  It\'s only expensive now because a lot of 
number crunching is involved.

V3 is offering new services, and because of that, they are making
changes in the present redirection services.  The change that
affects you the most is that you will no longer be able to avoid
V3\'s advertising when using the come.to URL. Instead, you will
see a popup window, much like the Yahoo! Geocities option, or a
delay page (which can be clicked through, at least for now). We
apologize for this, but we feel that the come.to URL - and the
forthcoming email address, FreelanceTraveller@come.to (NOT YET
ACTIVATED), are too convenient to give up. If you are really
dead-set against seeing V3\'s ads, you can always bookmark our
current real location,

cool! It\'s a Trepida, BTW. Looks a bit shiny...I think you\'ll need to

This is the age old question: "Do the people exist to serve nobility, or
does the nobility exist to serve the people?"
I have to agree that even if Strephon didn\'t directly neglect the people, he
did abdicate his rule to his subordinates.
If an Army or Navy fail in combat, who takes the blame?  The General or
Admiral in command of that force.  Political rule has VERY little difference

This is going to be covered in some detail in GT: Starships, along with
some other cans of worms (lesser forms of streamlining, for example). One
suggestion that looks likely to be adopted is that the Imperium is early to
mid TL12, so advanced TL12 armor may not be available for large
constructions like starships.

There is an effort within GT to maintain the "look and feel" of Classic
Traveller.  That\'s not to say some variation is not allowed, but that\'s the
basic design philosophy that\'s being used in the books.

NO, a thousand times no.  I definitely do not want GT relegated to some
sort of second-class citizenship.  However, there needs to be some
recognition that the ultimate goal of GT is to replicate the feel of the
Traveller universe, not to transform it into something else by pushing the
system to its limits.

The difference is that:
- - GT invites you to do so (within the traveller framework) - it specifically
  mentions armor as one area you might want to customize.
- - G:Vehicles provides an internal consistency, which I thought was one of
  Travellers cornerstones.
- - It isn\'t that markedly different.

Why is efficient GT design upsetting CTers?  I don\'t see complaints about
efficient CT design.

Ok, try this on for size. At 20 mph, it\'s going to take your ship 5-10
hours *each way* to go from the top of the atmosphere to the ground.
That *alone* is expensive. 

Also, at 20 mph weather, such as storms, moves a *lot* faster than your
ship can dodge. Since weather is a chaotic system, the Imperium won\'t
be able to predict it any better than we can. So you could easily start
a descent (or a takeoff) and a couple of hours later find yourself in
the path of a squall line that was "supposed" to be nowhere near you.
Or trying to dodge a jetstream.

And this is an example of what I pointed out earlier. The Broadsword is
definite not "airframe". But it\'s *also* most definitely not
"unstreamlined". It\'s symmetrical. It\'s got a smooth, rounded surface.
It doesn\'t have "stuff" sticking out all over.

Which is just plain *silly*. If you can skim, you can take strains that

But there are good and sufficient reasons for having it *anyway*.
Satellite repair, access to low g & vacuum, truly *isolated* quarantine
facilities. 

Also, even if you can spare the many hours to land and take off again,
what do you do if the weather patterns aren\'t suitable? Sit up in orbit
for days, waiting for favorable weather?

These sound like an *ideal* case for using fission reactors for the
main power plant. You get to go a *lot* longer before overhauling the
plant, and they can set up breeder reactors on worthless chunks of
rock. Use NERVA type rockets for maneuver drive.

Nope. Volt, Amp, etc came *after* the metric system. Remember, metric
was started during the French Revolution (about 1800). Units like
volts, amps and the like came *afterwards*.

Nope. An ampere is a unit with the dimensions of charge/time. That is X
number of charge units flowing per time unit. A coulomb is defined as
either so many "elementary charges" or as the charge required to
deposit a certain amount of metal in a precisely specified
electroplating setup. 

This is no different than the definitions of the second and the metter.
Both are tied to a particular wavelength that is easily produced and
measured in the lab, and to the speed of light, which is now a defined
quantity.

Definitely garbage.

That\'s better.

The SI unit of charge is the Coulumb. An Ampere is a current of 1
coulomb per second. Except that for various reasons SI makes Ampere the
"fundamental" unit and Coulomb the "derived" unit.

Using Q for charge, M for mass, L for length, and T for time, here are
the dimensions of the units:

Charge	 Q
Mass	 M
velocity L/T
current  Q/T
energy   ML^2/T^2
Power	 ML^2/T^3

voltage*current=power
voltage*Q/T=ML^2/T^3
voltage*Q=ML^2/T^2
voltage=ML^2/QT^2

That is, voltage = energy/charge. Thus the definition of a volt as
involving moving one coulomb of charge across a potential difference of
one joule.

And resistance is derived similarly, using Ohm\'s law.
resistance  ML^2/Q^2T

But in essence, we use the metric units for electrical quantities
simply because there are no *non*-metric units for such. The units were
invented after the metric system, and every effort was made to fit them
in seamlessly.

Actually, graphite\'s most important properties in industry are
electrical conductivity, and *high* temperature resistance. It\'s solid
at some *really* outrageous temperatures.

Actually, the design was even weirder. It used the equivalent of a
vulcan cannon (possible several of them) as a drive. I asume that was
what was feeding the explosives out the back.

As I understand it, the basic problem was that our heros needed to get
a manned craft into orbit by a specific date. With technology
equivalent to the 1930s. They had obtained the contents of a First
Empire technical library, but they didn\'t have time to build most of
the required infrastructure. 

They needed to get into orbit so that they would be admitted into the
Second Empire as a "spacefaring" planet, rather than "planetbound". As
I dimly recall, the latter was about as much fun as being a native of
the Belgian Congo. The former had some rights.

Note that the ship was built to get to orbit only. They relied on the
presence of the Imperial ship in orbit to get the pilot back down.

There\'s a lot to be said for hitting players with truly "alien" *human*
cultures. One good example is Donald Kingbury\'s "Courtship Rite". There
are a few other SF stories that use good antropology as a basis. And
they\'ll drive your players *nuts*. After all, these people are *human*
"surely they must xxxx". Well surprise, surely they must not. :-)

People "expect" aliens to react oddly. They don\'t expect it from
"fellow humans".

There are a couple of possibilities.  One, obviously, is that different
elements of the fleets are in different areas.  

The other one is that the IN\'s organisation is not entirely rational.  The
IN has been around for centuries, with units being raised by various
leaders, at various times, through civil wars, and in states that were
subsequently absorbed by the Imperium.  Most of the effects of this would
appear at the squadron level, where there are probably lots of "1st Battle
Squadrons", and, no doubt, "101st Battle Squadrons" too.  It seems less
likely that you would get multiple numbered fleets through this kind of
process, but it could happen, I suppose.

A hybrid of the two cases could occur too, where the detachments from a
parent fleet could themselves be reinforced so as to become as large as a
normal subsector fleet.  This could well have happened centuries ago, and
the task forces detached from the 213rd fleet could have been used as
"real" fleets ever since.

In other words, make up a story!

Sure, but wouldn\'t you want to coat it with something either a) tough, so it
wouldn\'t wear as fast as soft graphite or b) ablative and cheap?

Not really.  First of all, you can probably safely go 50 mph.  Secondly, the atmosphere gets thin fairly quickly, at 20 miles you\'re at 1% of normal atmosphere and can probably go 500 mph, at 40 miles you\'re in functionally \'trace\' atmosphere and can safely move at a significant fraction of orbital speed.  probably go as fast as you want.  Call it an hour each way, and that\'s being careful.

We can predict weather an hour ahead plenty accurately.

In Gurps Traveller, the fusion plants are larger and less efficiant than in
MT/FFS1.

This is rather anoying, as even toasters had fusion in Traveller (I am
joking). In 101 Vehicles (a great GDP product) at High tech levels only
realy small vehicals used fuel cells or other power sources. BD\'s , FGMP
and PGMP all where fusion powered.(I have ignored Fusion Plus, for while I
worship Greg Porter as Gaming God (tm) F+ was not Traveller)

I have calculated the Fusion plants for GT (FFS1 and MT have the same
stats). Conversions may be wrong, let me know if it is>

    Well, the idea makes sense.  If a 100K dTon Battle-Rider are better than
a 100K dTon Battleship, then why not use the same system for merchant
shipping?

    That is a great idea.  What about being able to carry 6 10K dTon
Merchant Riders, 3 10K dTon Merchant Riders & 1 30K dTon Battle-Riders, or 2
30K dTon Battle-Riders?  This way in wartime, a Merchant Tender could carry
some cargo & be well protected.  Think of the Vargr Commerce Raider who
attacks this ship & meets up with a 30K dTon Battle-Rider.  *weg*

Against nuclear weapons, graphite _is_ really tough.  It requires an enormous quantity of energy and very high temperatures to vaporize (weight for weight, many times higher than steel), it mostly isn\'t bothered by neutrons, and it conducts heat extremely well.  Incidentally, against lasers, macrocrystalline graphite (with the planes aligned flat on the surface) would be wonderful armor, it\'s incredibly hard to vaporize, and would conduct heat away from the impact point very fast while conducting quite poorly through the armor.

They\'re larger.  Not sure if they\'re less efficient, they run 10 megawatts per ton.

Incidentally, in response to this: I redid the Intrepid without advanced armor. Resulting stats are: price $11.7 MCr.  Weight 379,490, LWt 380,315.  DR F6/18,000, sides,top,bottom 4/6,000, cupola 4/3,000.  For $12.8 MCr it has standard laminate armor instead.  No stats other than those listed are affected.  

I also have a _serious_ rewrite of the Astrin -- it is, correctly, TL 14, and has been redesigned as an IFV instead of an APC, with better stealth and substantial increases to electronics, firepower ,and threat protection.

I am not upset, and I love CT. But I am a heretic...

GURPs is a "core" system, not a "meliuex", and you aren\'t supposed to put
/all/ of it into a single campaign unless you are playing a Rifts type game.
This is not to say I object to putting a lot of "goodies" in, but care needs
to be taken. I would not implement every tech application I added into every
culture for one thing. Some might be _completely_ off-limits, and others
used only in economically feasible circumstances. This last thought comes
from an "electro-laser" I saw in a GURPs book once. I can\'t recall which
book. I don\'t even know if it is possible, but even the rules limit its use
to arid environments. Other bits may move up or down the TL scale, or need
the rules tweaked to fit Sacred Canon. Heresies are then up to Individual
TU\'s, and should be noted IMTU. This does not mean it can\'t be discussed,
IMHO, but it should not be /assumed/ that all tech in GURPs is available,
that is against the precepts of the system. GURPs is cogs and sprockets,
Traveller is a specific machine.

  The economics shouldn\'t be too bad, but some crucial variables arise:
 1) can the subordinate craft be designed so that when carried their own
internal tankage is available to the tender?
 2) can the scheduling difficulties be overcome such that a standard hull
tender (for the 20% discount) can operate its sub-vessels efficiently?

  I would suggest that for a purpose-designed system the first answer would
be yes; the second issue is more dubious, but some basic work-arounds may
cover it while maintaining much of the cost advantage.

A top-of-the-line Solomani design, Augustus Deo-class liners serve
long-haul express routes within the Solomani Confederation. Unlike most
Solomani designs, they are spacious, with a theatre and multi-function hall
to accomodate high passengers.

In 998 Deepak Rao, the notorious terrorist, was captured when he attempted
to hijack the Australis Deo. Although observers expected a lengthy trial,
Rao unexpected pleaded guilty, calling himself a "very bad man who should
be locked away until he can behave himself." While Confederation
counter-terrorist experts were astonished, the passengers and crew of the
Australis Deo were unsurprised. "Even my young niece told him that," said
Hengabar Spofulam. "It is no surprise that he realized it himself." Further
details of the incident, including how untrained civilians overpowered the
ex-commando, have been classified a state secret by Solomani Security.

I ended up ignoring most of it myself (real life got a bit too real just
then).  I think the catalyst was the Scout Commando Battledress and
"insanely" high armour levels. (Which might have been errataed: I ignored
the issue because I don\'t run military games anyway.)

You\'re right, I hadn\'t noticed the GT reference.  Hm.  This kinda kicks
most of the designs in 101 Starships out the window, then.

Even worse, we may have a "GT canon contradiction" right here, in that GT:
Imperial Navy is being worked on right now, and we already have several
military ships published. Why do none of them use different armours, if it
makes that much difference?

It is. Sorry if I\'ve offended you: it wasn\'t my intention.

I was trying to point out that GT is a conversion of CT to the GURPS rule
system, and as such not everything in every supplement is available. I\'ve
got Biotech and Ultratech, for example, but I wouldn\'t assume that
everything listed in those books is available in the Traveller universe.
Ditto for Vehicles.

>Are you saying that Gurps gearheads are not welcome on the list?

Well, they welcome _me_, and I think I qualify as a GURPS Gearhead (GG). At
least, if GT Shipyard and 101 Starships don\'t make me a GG then I don\'t
know what will.

Toves-class Bulk Freighter (GTL12)

Toves-class freighters are very rare. They are usually owned by
high-population worlds, who use them to bring in food and raw materials-few
other organizations need a freighter with this capacity. Toves are too slow
to be worth arming; instead, they are invariably escorted by a small naval
squadron on anti-piracy duty.

rulebook sidebar that says you can use different materials from GURPS
Vehicles when designing ships, and the fact that all GT ships published to
date have just used the standard \'expensive metal\' option.

Practically, I think this is because most of the ship designers just used
the standard system, possibly designing a few more modules, without
examining the hulls.

OTOH, assuming that John is correct that you can get an extra G
acceleration (or more armour) by using advanced materials (and his numbers
look correct to me), that begs the question: what is the game reason that
all the published military ships don\'t use advanced materials?

I can see three choices here:

1) Errata the GT sidebar that allows advanced materials (ie. prohibit them).

2) Handwave a reason why they aren\'t used for starships.

3) Redesign existing military ships to use advanced materials.


Now, personally I like the idea of military ships being intrinsically
different from civilian ships (in more than just the amount of armour).
OTOH, I don\'t want GURPS Traveller to drift too far from the Traveller
background, and I certainly don\'t want GT to be a system where all the
official ships are intentionally suboptimal.

I\'d make that "unable to handle *weather*". Even fairly "light" winds
(say 15-20 mph) are going to make things *really* difficult. And as
we\'ve been discovering in recent years, "clear air" is not *calm* air.
More than one airliner has taken a surprise roller coaster ride in what
everyone *thought* was clear, calm air.

Personally, I\'d try for a lake. A shallow one. Shallow enough that part
of the ship would be above water if it turned out to be too heavy to
float, and deep enogh that it *could* float if it was light enough to.

(Just popped into the TML to have a look around, and noticed this
discussion.)

This may have been asked already, but is G:Starships going to define the
max tonnage that can enter atmosphere? Or land?

For the record, my (simplified) take is:
     - 10,000 tons is the most that can land on the ground on its own
landing legs (as long at it it correctly braced internally, of course)
     - 100,000 tons is the most that can land in water (or on some

definitely. Reread your GT Book... it clearly states that GT is an
emulation of traveller, not mainstream GURPS. It expressely includes some
tech limits, and others should be extrapolated from them.

Definitely not all aspects... MWM has set some limits, and Rob set a few
others... common courtesy says a few others should be avoided (Like
kvetching about your GM\'s nosepicking, etc)...

And while I speak only for myself here, I don\'t really consider GT to even
be Traveller...

>Are you saying that Gurps gearheads are not welcome on the list?

Min-maxers have not been welcomed on this list in the 4 years I\'ve been on
it... they tend to get obnoxious and asked to leave. Gearheads are not of
necessity min-maxers. Min-maxing gearheads create such "un-travelleresque"
things as the BD in GT:SM; things which have no buisiness in Traveller, but
are doable with GURPS.

>Anyone else want to move over to the Gurps traveller mailing list?

No one is likely to stop you from so doing, but keep in mind that this list
focuses on Traveller first, Rules Second, and minmaxing is lost somewhere
way down the list (At least since Phil, Cliff, and Leroy left), and
minmaxing G:V is something the non-GT\'ers like myself would rather not see.

FF&S1 and MT DO NOT have the same Fuel Consumption rates! MT measures
Fusion in KL/hour, while FF&S1/TNE measures in KL/year!... Then again, MT\'s
rates work out to a month\'s fuel being about the same ammount as under
CT... TNE\'s assumes most CT fuel was maneuver fuel/reaction mass.

TL 15 powerplants
TNE/FF&S1:  6 MW per KL, thus 3 MW/Tm or 84 MW/Td
MT: Max of 18 MW per KL, thus 9 MW/Tm or 243 MW/Td

Interesting that I never before noticed that FF&S1 lacks the Scale
Efficiencies table for power plants.

Well, one thing that seems virtually certain is that the sudden

to generate a quite noticeable gravity pulse.

Please re-read my post. 15 degrees per second gives a 24 second time to
revolve 360 degrees. That makes the "period of revolution" 24 seconds.
*That* is the "period of rotation" I\'m talking about.

Huh? Where did you get *that* figure?

a=4pi*2r/t^2

.96g=8pi*r/t^2
9.408=8*pi*10/t^2
9.408*t^2=80*pi
t^2=80*pi/9.408
t^2=~26.7
t=~5.2

So a turn is 5 seconds?

Thrust forces can only happen in a few *specific* directions. The
forces from the main drive are *always* in the same direction. The
forces from thrusters are much weakers, and in a limited number of directions.

But when moving thru an atmosphere, wind gusts can come from *any*
direction, and thus exert forces in any direction. And (given that the
ship is *by definition* not intended to deal with an atmsphere), these
forces can and *will* occur in directions that those *parts* of the
ship weren\'t intended to incur stress.

Heck, just consider the forces the air exerts on a jet fighter. Then
notice how many parts they have to mark "not a step". Those projections
are designed to resist a *lot* of force, but not in *that* direction.
Thus the warning signs. 

Mach 5 won\'t tear them off, but a little bit of *sideways* force will. 

Same thing with an USL ship. 


The equipment *can\'t* avoid these stresses. Even if the thrusters keep
the ship pointed in the right direction, the wind forces wuill be
coming from *multiple* directions. And hull irregularities will result
in *weird* eddies, that may well exert forces in their ownn odd
directions.

No, it does NOT. "Vectored" thrust from a "gimbaled" engine *turns* the
shiip. It won\'t push it at an angle. Not unless the engine is mounted
at the CG (center of gravity, aka center of mass) of the ship. 

A thrust vector that *doesn\'t* pass thru the CG causes the ship to
*spin*. It does NOT move it at an angle. That\'s because it (in effect)
decomposes into a pair of vectors. One thru the CG, and the other at
right angles, applied at the location of the drive.

To *make* it move the ship at an angle would require manuevering
thrusters strong enough to counter the turning vector imposed by the
main drive. And if they are *that* strong, it\'s much simpler to just
use *them* to to hold the ship at an angle, rather than waste all that
space, massd and money on making the main engine "steerable".

You can pull this sort of stunt in aircraft and watercraft, because
they\'ve got a dense medium (water or air) to generate stabilizing forces.

You can change *facing* on that sort of time scale, even with *weak*
manuevering thrusters. You can\'t change *course* that fast, because
your course is determined by adding your new thrust *vector* to your
old velocity vector.

If the ship maintains it\'s current acceleration (magnitude and
direction), its position in "a few seconds" is easily known. Ditto for
if it maintains *velocity* (no acceleration). 


The position of the ship (actually, the ship\'s CG) will be somewhere
inside a sphere centered on the position you\'d have if you cut thrust,
with a radius determined by your max thrust and the time you have to
apply it.

For example, if you are moving at 100 km/s, and have a 6g drive, your
position will be inside the following spheres:

time	center	radius
- ----	----	----
0	0       0
1 sec	100 km  30 *meters*
2 sec	200 km	120 meters
3 sec	300 km	270 meters
4 sec	400 km	480 meters
5 sec	500 km	750 meters


That is, one second later, the center of your "possible position"
sphere is 100 km away in the direction you were traveling, but it\'s
only 30 *meters* across. That\'s because that\'s the maximum *distance*
change 6 g of acceleration can produce in that time period. 

Now you can see why *course* changes aren\'t all that important, but
*facing* changes can be. At least for the first couple of seconds.

Here\'s the "radius" table for 1 thru 5 g. The "center" depends on your
starting velocity, not your acceleration.

time	1g	2g	3g	4g	5g
- ----	----	----	----	----	----
1	  5m	 10m	 15m	 20m	 25m
2	 20m	 40m	 60m	 80m	100m
3	 45m	 90m	135m	180m	225m
4	 80m	160m	240m	320m	400m
5	125m	250m	375m	500m	625m


BTW, *I* was shocked when I first found out just how predictably
positions where. I\'d been expected the "possible position" to be some
really *weird* shape. But thanks to relativity (all inertial frames are
equal) You can just pick the "frame" in which the ship was at rest when
last observed. Which makes the future positions spheres centered on
that position. Of course, since the frame is actually moving, so is the
position. But that\'s easily corrected for. With the results above.

Well, you have to realize that even if the ship\'s manuevering thrusters
*are* up to the job (not a given), the "programming" to *enable* them
to do so isn\'t that simple.

Why would it have the required programs? They are *very* specialized
simulation software.

And since you are modeling a real object, you need *detailed* info on
the "shape" of the ship and on the internal mass distribution. I can
see the ship having the mass distribution info, as it\'s need for cargo
loading to balnce the ship. But the aerodynamic info about the hull? I
don\'t think so. 

Remember, the whole *point* here is that the ship *wasn\'t* intended to
enter an atmosphere when it was built.

Maybe. I\'m still not so sure that the blueprints will have the right
*kind* of details. Why would they include info about the drag
coefficients of the various materials on the surface of the ship? And
even if they did, what makes you think that info is still correct after
however many years of micrometeorite pitting, and "repairs" (paint?
sanding?) to same.

Well, that seems to be your point... but it\'s not
the one others are making.  Many people are saying 
that *some* /unstreamlined/ ships were *designed* 
to enter the atmosphere, just not at high velocity.

But there doesn\'t have to be a strong *side* force.  After all, all the 
forces acting on the ship will add up to one force vector and one torque 
vector (yes, that\'s a bit oversimplified.  But I think it\'s close 
enough...).  You use the main drive to cancel the overall force vector, and 
the attitude jets to counter the torque.  So again, it comes down to: how 
strong are those jets.

I\'ll refrain from asking "why in the world you\'d want to do that!" and just say, that I agree that the TML is a pretty civil list.  Yes, we have our disagreements, but even at their worse they are more polite than most online forums.

well, I originally emailed this directly to the original poster, but it 
seems it\'s worth repeating on the list:

consider getting 4.61  They fixed a _lot_ of bugs from 4.6 to 4.61, 
including some nasty memory leaks.  Better yet, use Eudora for mail :)

Personally, I prefer Netscape 4.61 and Eudora Pro 4.2 for their respective 
tasks.  IMHO, Netscape is an excellent browser, and a lousy anything else.

Ok, this I like.  That\'s finally an argument that makes sense to me.  Thus, 
USL landings are possible, but pretty damn dangerous, and thus only used 
for emergencies.  Perfect.  Thank you very much.

But it won\'t keep the ship from *spinning* abou the axis of the bar. :-)

Actually, the required thrust for manuevering is nowhere *near* that
high. "Evasion" in the sense we normally think of it is IMPOSSIBLE for
spacecraft that obey Newtonian phsyics. You can\'t change your *vector*
fast enough. 

What you *can* do is spin the ship around an axis lined up with the
line of sight between you and your attacker. That makes it hard to hit
the extremities of the ship. But the *center* of the ship doesn\'t move
much in a few seconds. Not relative to your starting vector.

In *that* case, the forces from the craft\'s velocity relative to the
atmosphere will tear it up unless it\'s at least a *little* streamlined.

Remember, the forces exerted by the "wind" go up as the *square* of the
velocity.

Must be in storage. I can tell you that it *isn\'t* "The Proteus

though. Or maybe something by Dean Ing.

Well, I\'m flattered :)  I just looked at the info on the Majesta, and I 
pretty much agree with the author, It\'s the Mega-ships that are the 
lifeblood of the Imperium.  Although I\'ve never seen an explicit reference, 
I\'ve always assumed that most "real" freight traffic happens on ships in 
the 50kdt-500kdt range.  A reference in "Fighting Ships" seems to indicate 
that 1,000kdt is the largest military vessel ever, and civilian ships that 
big don\'t exist.  Hence, I figure these monsters top out at 500kdt...

I\'m not sure how much I\'m allowed to say here, so I\'ll say very little... 
This is a topic that was seriously discussed by the editors, authors, and 
contributors of GT Starships and GT Imperial Navy, and is still not quite 
settled.  All I can advise is that you wait for the release of those two 
books before making final judgments.  I realize this isn\'t helpful, but I 
feel that I can\'t disclose any further details at this time.  Perhaps Chris 
or John can give more of a sneak preview.

Another thought is that the fleets listed as duplicates are really the
missing fleets, but there are ten duplicated fleets and only four missing
fleets. What ones get the missing fleet numbers and what ones get the new
numbers of 315th, 316th, 317th, 318th, 319th, 320th?

I noted that also; I would mark it up to being an area of "interest" to
the Imperium.

With the 314th numbered fleet being the highest numbered fleet (correct
me if this is wrong), it would be odd that two separate fleets would be
given the same designation number.

>I envision squadrons being shuffled about rather often along the Vargr
>Extents borders.

I agree, but one could reassign a squadron from one fleet to another. The
squadron would jump to the next subsector and become part of that
numbered fleet. I would follow the example of the ScoutRon below.

ScoutRons (Scout Squadrons): Scout vessels; Rarely seen during peacetime,
ScoutRons are IISS vessels loaned to the navy as couriers, scouts and
intelligence vessels. Almost never deployed as ScoutRons, a scout courier
sent from the 10th BatRon with a dispatch to the 212st BatRon becomes
part of the 212th until it is sent elsewhere. ScoutRons generally consist
of ships waiting to be reassigned, repaired or resupplied.

One could easly absorb the local squadron into the new fleet.
i.e.: the 1st battle squadron of Regina becomes the 1st battle squadron
of the 212th Imperial Fleet

I would say that this case would be normal for new sub-sectors at the
frontier areas. But once the reinforcements have been there long enough
and the sub-sector is secure and incorporated, the orders from sector
command arrive congratulating the new fleet.

>In other words, make up a story!

It had crossed my mind that the fleet numbers might have been "retired"
because all ships of that fleet sacrificed themselves for the Imperium by
"Holding the Line".

Sorry, I was unclear.  I didn\'t mean the crew would do this.  I mean that 
at GTL10-12 generating this software is so trivial, that I\'d expect the 
finished program to be standard equipment on any ship, even an USL one, as 
a safety measure if nothing else.  And even if it wasn\'t standard, it still 
would be trivially cheap, so someone who wanted to routinely land their USL 
could go out and buy it.

again, see above - I meant that the factory had these details.  As for 
repairs, well, you\'d better log them into the program, or else....

The problem is that GT is representation of Traveller, and should attempt
to do as little \'violence\' to established Traveller canon as is possible. Now
GT does indeed say you can play with alternate armours, but I don\'t think
that was intended as carte blance to ignore established Traveller canon.

But GT is intended to be a representation of CT in GURPS terms. As
such it should attempt to maintain CT "purity" as far as is possible.

> Are you saying that Gurps gearheads are not welcome on the list?

I don\'t think anyone in their right mind would suggest such a thing.
However, it should be remembered that GT is an attempt to model
CT. GURPS is (as its name suggests) a generic system, an attempt
to cover all possible gaming universes with a single system. Traveller
is a particular universe with its own limits and restrictions. Somethings
from GURPS are just not appropriate in that universe, take for instance
FTL radio. Its part of GURPS, but has no place in Traveller. As with
everything, care needs to be exercised to avoid destroying the nature
of the Universe. Now in Traveller, the most advanced armour material
available at TL 15 is Bonded Superdense, which is best represented
as advanced metal, adding a better armour goes changes the nature
of the universe.

> Anyone else want to move over to the Gurps traveller mailing list?

I sincerely hope not. I don\'t play GURPS (just not my thing), but GT
has brought a lot of new players/ideas/etc to Traveller and added
greatly to it.

But it is markedly different. By adding advanced composite armour existing
designs are rendered obsolete. It was ACA that brought us the abomination
of Marine Battledress in StarMercs.

Because anything in CT is by its very nature a part of the Traveller universe,
the same is not true for VE2.

Let me preface this by saying I *like* the TNE system, but...

...my main complaint was that Dave Neilson was telling *a* story
through the the TNE line.  The story was his, and GDW\'s, story...not
the individual GM\'s.  Secrets were kept, to be revealed over time,
the various games were to follow a script from event to event.  It
felt to *me* like a game of follow the leader, and I didn\'t want to
play.  Now, I\'m *sure* others don\'t agree with me, but that was how
I saw it.

I\'m going to make a suggestion that won\'t be universally popular,
some folks will consider it a call to mass heresy, but here it is
none the less.

Given that GDW is no more, and GT is off in a non-rebellion
universe, and Marc has no plans to come back to the rebellion any
time soon why don\'t all the folks that liked the universe that HT
was creating make it so?  Get together and create the framework for
the universe you wanted to play in.

Not tooting my own horn ... well, maybe I am a little bit, but GTS 
allows different materials factoring when entering a Hull into the 
Repository.  The Fudge Factor is the key.  If you will notice, there is 
a 50,000 and 20,000 value for the GTL10/12 hulls (and a really 
strange number for Asteroid Hulls ...).  This equates to a 2.5 times 
factor.  Looking at VE2 pg.22, you will see where those numbers 
come from (50,000 / 20,000 = 2.5 and 0.1 / 0.04 = 2.5).

With a little Multiplication and Division (on your part), you can have 
GTS generate the correct weight, cost, DR and HP required for just 
about any hull.  

Example:
Say we wanted a TL11 Hull:  First we calc all the necessary Hull 
numbers the old fashioned way (volume, hull cost and weight, etc.)

Now we want the armor factors so we can just choose the DR and 
have GTS do the calcs for us.  We see that the Weight Modifier for 
TL11 is 0.06 so  0.1 / 0.06 = 1.6667.  Now we take the 1.6667 and 
multiply it by the 20,000 (the GTL10 Fudge Factor) and we get 
33,333.  Do the same thing for Cost if moving between the different 
Armor Types.  

Now when we select this hull and say we want 100 points of armor, 
we get the correct the weight and cost.  There may be some round 
off error, but when dealing with MCr, a few Cr here and there 
"shouldn\'t" matter too much :)  Think of it as Creative Contracting.

As I pointed out in an earlier post, AuricTech ships would normally have
this information, as a safety feature.  I _also_ pointed out that our
customers would pay a premium for this programming, as AuricTech would
have to conduct all the wind-tunnel and other aerodynamic modeling
tests, in a variety of possible atmospheres.

Here\'s an interesting way to judge such matters:

Assume the following:

1.  Given that streamlined ships cost more than their unstreamlined
counterparts, assume that 75% of the cost of streamlining is the actual
structural cost (fairings over protrusions, protective coverings over
sensitive areas, etc.).  The other 25% of the cost pays for the various
aerodynamic modeling tests, over a variety of possible atmospheres.

2.  As a safety measure, many unstreamlined ships undergo aerodynamic
modeling, just in case they have to perform an unscheduled re-entry. 
This modeling costs 1/3 of the price of streamlining.  (The modeling has
a disproportional cost, due to the fact that modeling airflows over
rough non-aerodynamic surfaces is more difficult than modeling airflows
over smooth non-aerodynamic or true aerodynamic surfaces.  It\'s still
cheaper than full streamlining....)

3.  Unstreamlined ships, regardless of the presence or absence of
aerodynamic modeling software, will have _extreme_ difficulty in
launching from a world with any atmosphere denser than Trace.

I\'d have to agree with Leonard on this one.  Only ships that come from
shipyards (such as AuricTech) that have crunched the numbers will be
able to cope with atmospheric conditions _in realtime_.

That should be equivalent to the M1 Abrams tank keeping track of such
matters as barrel wear and barrel droop.  Once the original values are
loaded, and the appropriate sensors mounted, keeping track of such
changes should be fairly simple.  As noted earlier, however, the naval
architect must design the ship in question to account for such matters. 
This costs extra....

What\'s going to "wear"? It\'s getting hit by hot *gases*, not being
sandblasted or something. And graphite *is* cheap. We wouldn\'t use it
in pencils if it wasn\'t. 

Graphite is *brittle*. But fairly strong.

So? At 20 mph it takes *5* hours to get from 100 miles altitude (low
orbit) to ground. Not counting the tme it takes to reduce your speed
relative to the ground to zero.

Then you\'d better hope that the controllers care about your ship, and

See my note earlier today.  I meant that it was the shipyard, not crew that 
could do this.  However, I think that this would be a trivial task for 
GTL10-12 computers, and  would _always_ be included as part of the standard 
package, as a safety feature.

(This is all in GT stats.  I don\'t know the other systems well enough to do 
this.) Look at it this way:  The best computer possible today, at TL7, 
would be a Genius Mainframe, which is complexity 5.  Say this computer 
takes a year of actual number crunching to do an analysis like this (I 
suspect it\'s actually much lower, but I don\'t know how long Boeing took on 
the 777).  1yr=31e6 seconds.  That means that the program is complexity 11 
(5 for the comp, and then another one per order of magnitude).

A TL12 Genius Macroframe, which any decent Shipyard would own (it\'s only 
3,500,000 credits...) has complexity 10.  That means it would take it 
approximately 310 seconds to do the same computation.  A whopping 5 
minutes.....

I can\'t see this not being a standard safety feature...

"Vectored thrust", as defined in GT, does allow you to thrust
in any direction.  It is also the term described for similar
effects such as in the Harrier jump jet.  But if you have
been using term differently in this thread then I\'m sure you
will let me know.

Seems to me that theis space craft was designed based on Jules Verns
From the Earth to the Moon, which was found in the Imperial library
archive that was the target of the first part of the book. A giant
cannon launced the capsule which depended on the Imperial\'s kindness to
recover. The heroes had recovered a number of other alternative but they
couldn\'t be implemented in time with local tech (roughly 18th - 19th
century). \'Course it\'s been several years since I reread it, so I could
be wrong.

How about the simplest one?  The material required to make the advanced
armor is simply too expensive to use on such a LARGE structure as a
starship, especially a MILITARY one (because they tend to be larger than
civilian ones...).  The resource materials are simply to scarce...  the
manufacturing processes are too lengthy and too involved to produce enough
for an entire starship in the time allotted for starship construction.
Vehicle construction however is another matter because of the SIZE
involved...  sometimes one forgets just how large starships really are...

In the middle Roman Empire, it was common practise to dispatch a portion
of a legion (called a vexillion) off to trouble spots rather than the entire legion.
Now on some occassions, these vexillion\'s did not rejoin their parent unit
and evolved into a complete new unit retaining the parent units designation.
Perhaps this is the explaination.

Another explaination is that during the Civil War different factions raised
fleets with the same designation and some of these survived. The Spinward
Campaign mentions that Imperial naval squadron maintain an existance over
time (to foster esprit de corp). Perhaps the same is true of fleets.

If the Ancients did it then it can be anything you want. But as you say,
that\'s the least preferable option. If it\'s a human-instigated
terraforming program, then the situation is less clear-cut.

Certainly feasible, but 10,000 years is still a relatively short time for
a terraforming (or vlandoforming :) ) to bear fruit.

This assumes a complete terraforming project. Large artificial habitats
are quite acceptable within the timescale and, if large enough, would
also only lose their atmospheres over periods of tens of thousands of
years.

Absolutely. Although you don\'t actually need TLs to be that high. We
could start terraforming Mars now if we were willing to throw enough
money at it.

If anyone wants to get a really detailed description of the technologies
involved then I recommend that you get a copy of \'Terraforming\' by Martyn
Fogg. A warning though - this is the definitive university/college level
text with plenty of graphs and equations in it. If that doesn\'t bother
you, then it\'s a fascinating read. For something a bit lighter, try
Robert Zubrin\'s \'The Case For Mars\'.

I\'ll try to address some of your concerns here. Most of whatever tweaking

it involves proprietary material belonging to SJ Games.

The draft design material that was made available to designers of ships for
GT: Imperial Navy (which I am _not_ writing, though I am helping with
design questions) included variant hull armors.

A quick poll of the designs submitted shows that none of them used other
than standard (i.e., expensive metal) hull armor, though there was some
fiddling with frame strength. More on this below.

There is still a fundamental misunderstanding here: "advanced" is not a
/type/ of material in VE2, it is a description of relative /quality/ of
materials at a given TL.

Here is a partial reprint of a reply I sent to this list on 9 July, on a
similar question (Re: Armour Limits):

>That\'s not quite what\'s going on in VE2. "Advanced laminate" isn\'t a
material, it\'s a relative quality and a construction method. Materials are
introduced as "advanced", then become "expensive" one TL higher, "standard"
the TL after that, and "cheap" three TL\'s after introduction. It is true,
however, that new materials are always being introduced to fill the
"advanced" category.

don\'t tell me there is no "bonded superdense" -- I know that.

Robert again:

>1) Errata the GT sidebar that allows advanced materials (ie. prohibit them).

At this point, I will probably eliminate the "hyperdense" entry from the
table and simply ignore laminates and composites for starship hulls. This
has the effect of capping hull armor at "improved nanocrystal", which at
TL12 is "expensive". It leaves the question of whether laminates and
composites are appropriate in GT up to the individual GM -- I don\'t think
they are, but I don\'t want to tie the GM\'s hands with an explicit ruling.

The designers of GT:IN ships knew this, at least in its preliminary form,
and (so far as I know -- Juliean? Tom?) purposely avoided TL12 advanced
materials.

>2) Handwave a reason why they aren\'t used for starships.

Actually, the cheaper armors are more the problem here -- why aren\'t they
used for freighters and such? For this, I am including the following handwave:

"Jump Grid: Starship hull armor, and the hull armor of non-starships
designed to be carried externally by starships, automatically includes a
jump grid (if desired) if constructed of Expensive or Advanced materials."

Jump grids were introduced by Marc Miller in JTAS#24, so I\'m not creating
canon here. The idea that jump grids are made of /lanthanum/, however, is a
DGP artifact (in SOM); Mr. Miller\'s article specifies that lanthanum is
used in the construction of the "jump coils". 

I have "jump grids" as a separate component that can be added to cheaper
hulls (at additional cost and trouble), and will include no-grid designs as
an option and variant.

This, by the bye, is the difference between Class A and B (GT Class V and
IV) shipyards IMO: Class A/V shipyards can produce hulls with jump grids,
Class B/IV cannot. This makes importing jump drives from elsewhere more
problematic.

>3) Redesign existing military ships to use advanced materials.

Not going to happen -- SJ Games will handwave like the dickens rather than
implement an erratum that requires widespread changes in published material.

There _has_ been a recent, global (i.e., GURPS-wide) change in high-energy
(>1 Tj) energy weapons to make them less powerful, specifically as a result
of concerns that they were unbalanced against armor -- you can thank
Anthony Jackson for that one.

Probably not -- streamlining (or lack thereof) is the question, not size
per se. I\'m keeping an eye on the "unstreamlined ships in atmosphere"
debate, to see if there is a concensus resolution.

>Or land?

Maybe. Truth be told, I hadn\'t considered it before in quite those terms.
GT: Starports may contain some standard landing pads I designed; those did
take the structural strength of the pad and the ground pressure of the
landing gear into account. John M. Ford (the author) is fond of landing
cradles, so those will almost certainly appear.

I\'ll take a look at ground pressure as a function of size and the standard
landing gear, and see if I can\'t come up with a simple table. Be fun to
know that a Scout can land on soft dirt, but the Kinunir that landed next
to her is going to get stuck, eh?

FWIW, CT makes a couple of reference to 1,000 dtons as the largest ship
that _does_ land, whether anything bigger _can_ land or not. Since there
are canonical 5,000-dton streamlined freighters, however, I designed a
large pad to suppport 5,000-dtons.

    I have to agree.  Why else do you think I came up with the Tender-Rider
idea for a ship with a high jump rating?  The Mega-Ship will service the
mains, but what about outside the mains?  You will need something with legs,
& still a high cargo capacity, & this idea gives it to you.

"[L]arge scale trade calls for large scale ships to carry it out. Such
trading ships are generally huge bulk carriers with displacements in the
multi-kiloton range." Traders and Gunboats, p. 18.

Fighting ships mentions "10,000 or 20,000-ton bulk [cargo] carriers" (p.
25), but says that "commercial ships of [50,000 dtons] are unknown in the
Spinward Marches" in 1101-1107 (p. 44). Whether they exist later, or closer
to the core, is a matter for speculation.

I\'d be interested in having such a discussion, but from seeing similar things
happen on other mailing lists (eg 2300AD) I don\'t think we should delude
ourselves that we\'ll get anything other than a (very good) discussion out of
it, and probably about as many timelines as there would be participants.

I\'d be keener still to see whoever picks up T5 and beyond recognise the warmth
of feeling behind HT as a viable setting and take it forward as the/an official
timeline.

Ah! I see your problem.

The jets and main drive are *countering* the forces. That\'s far, FAR
different than *neutralizing* them.

If the wind forces are trying to accelerate the ship in direction X,
and the jets cancel that, you\'ve got *two* force vectors applied to the
ship. And at *different* points. The ship is braced for forces applied
*at* the the thrusters and at the main drive. It\'s *not* braced for the
wind forces that sum to a vector someplace inbetween.

Having the *motions* resulting from forces cancelled isn\'t the same as
cancelling the *stresses* induced by those forces. The "push" on
various parts of the hull isn\'t being allowed to turn the ship, but
it\'s still there. 

Consider a "box" attached to a pivot (the CG). It\'s got panels braced
so that you can push on them to turn it. 

Now have someone resist that turning force by pushing on an *unbraced*
portion of the box. At some point, they\'ll push thru the side of the
box. 

Wind force is applied over the entire surface of the ship, with the
force proportional to the area and the angle of attack (we\'re assuming
a "constant" wind speed here).

Thrsusters and the main drive apply force against the *framework* of the
hull. So it\'s braced for forces applied at those points *by* the
thrusters and the main drive. And it\'s braced for the inertial forces
caused by the various portions of the ship reacting against the
attempts to turn it about the CG. 

So the wind force is being applied in places the ship was never
designed to have forces applied. 

A steel beam that isn\'t moving because there are no significant forces
acting on it, and one that isn\'t moving because the torques and
impulses from the forcing affecting it "cancel" may look the same at
first glance. 

But the former is under no appreciable stress. The latter may be ready
to fail catastrophically at any moment. 

Lack of motion doesn\'t mean lack of stress.

It\'s nowhere *near* that simple, as a few studies on trying to "fly" to
orbit have shown. The way temp, pressure *and* density fluctuate on the
way up, you\'d wind up crossing the sound barrier at some point unless
you keep your speed *really* low. 

And there\'s *no* way you are going to get an USL ship to make it
throught the trans-sonic region in one piece. 

Check a graph of the way the speed of sound varies from ground up to
100 miles. 

Then check out "Reynold\'s number". 

Re = rho*D*u/mu = D*u/nu

 Re = reynolds number
rho = density
  D = "characteristic length" (size of the ship)
  u = velocity
 mu = abosolute viscosity
 nu = kinematic viscosity

Basicly, what Reynolds numbers let you do is compare the flow
characteristics in different situations. If two different situations
have similar Reynold\'s numbers, then the way the fluids involved flow
around the object involved will be similar. 

This lets you compare (for example) large, fast objects in air with
small, slow objects in water. 

Due to the temp & density changes your descent will cover a *huge*
range of Reynolds numbers.

And there\'s going to be a need to keep slow moving ships away from fast
moving ones. So I doubt that you\'d get the "preferred" short route.
That\'d be for the faster ships.

I too, was hoping that it was some US slang. I don\'t think the BBFC
would accept it in a PG movie over here.

I was listening to a radio programme about a group of people whose
job it is to substitute words in films to allow a TV showing or use
as an inflight movie.

From what they were saying, it is possible that "plonker" was invented
for use by that BBC comedy series to substitute for that other term,
since it has a similar sound and mouth shape.

Unfortunately, I don\'t have the derivation of plonker available to check
this.

I bet you wouldn\'t object so much if you could get your hands on the
infinitely long, infinitely thin wires which must have infinitely low
resistance (unless you want our power source that can generate the
infinite voltage need to drive that current.)

Pah! Next you\'ll want to know who supplies all our "light, rigid rods"

Not any more. The second and the metre were both defined in that way, but
I think people got fed up that the value of that fundamental, universal
constant "c" kept changing everytime they refined one or other.

So now c is defined as a certain speed and the second is defined as
number of cycles of some fregquency of radiation.

The metre is now a derived unit.

I don\'t know the provenance of the word either, but it was around before the
comedy series. On the other hand the word "naff" was invented specifically for
the BBC comedy series "Porridge" as an all-purpose 4-letter word, and entered
the language.

In *that* case, the forces from the craft\'s velocity relative to the
atmosphere will tear it up unless it\'s at least a *little* streamlined.

Remember, the forces exerted by the "wind" go up as the *square* of the
velocity.
>>>>>>>>>>>>
I\'m trying to see if some kind of crash landing situation for a CT
"partially streamlined" ship on a planet with a breathable atmosphere
were possible, either with some crew survival or at least with some
salvage potential.

I was thinking of a ship with a major power problem, perhaps enough
power left over for a few minutes of CG, intertial comp and thrust doing 
a meteoric style reentry, followed by an emergency decel and a *really*
big bump.

Does that include such UK oddities as:

"Eight-be-four sheet of six mil ply"	(8\' x 4\' x 6mm)

"Fifteen metres of two-be-one"		(15m x 2" x 1")

Have your players ever landed on a world where imperial units have only
been partly adopted? Think of the trouble they would have delivering
a block of wood 15m x 2m x 1m. Or even if they worked out that
8mm x 4mm x 6mm was unlikely, 8m x 4m shhets of plywood aren\'t too common.

    Not only that, the subordinate crafts Jump Drive should be linked with
the main ships Jump Drive, so the combined ship should have Jump-3.

    I should think so.  If you are organized enough.

    Well depends upon how organized you are.  If you schedule it right, #2
should not be that much of a problem.

I tried Netscape 4.61, and IMO it\'s excessively bloated (on my 
system, anyway), and I\'ve gone back to 4.08, which runs just fine. 
However I don\'t, never have and never will use Netscape or IE for 
news and email. IMO they are both hopeless.

Isn\'t that 8\' x 4\' x .006"?

That sounds interesting...

*ESPECIALLY* if they don\'t happen to have a converter handy to keep them out of trouble...

Well, that seems to be your point... but it\'s not
the one others are making.  Many people are saying 
that *some* /unstreamlined/ ships were *designed* 
to enter the atmosphere, just not at high velocity.

Sorry, wrong answer!

A Brick (according to High Guard) is partially streamlined and can refuel
from a gas giant.

The only unstreamlined configurations are either asteroids or type 7.

Now an oil rig at sea could be given thrusters in their legs equivalent
to 1G and fly around in space without breaking up.

However I wouldn\'t want to try and fly one through an atmosphere.

I would limit the armor types to the metal class - no composites or laminates. While 
this might be a largely artificial limitation, it bridges the gap - it allows a little

IMHO, of course...

I concur, these notes (and the artwork they point me to) I find very

planetary bodies to enhance the "Traveller experience",
the closest pictures ever taken by NASA\'s Galileo spacecraft of 
Jupiter\'s volcanic moon Io will be unveiled Friday, August 27, at
8 a.m. Pacific Daylight Time, at the following Internet addresses:

     http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov 
     http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/galileo/sepo	
     http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/galileo

That\'s _today_, folks; about 90 minutes from now.

The images are in true color (as they would appear to the naked eye) and
in enhanced false color.  They reveal a patchwork of pastels, punctuated by
areas of black, brown, green, orange and red, near Io\'s active volcanic
centers.  The pictures were taken on July 3, 1999, as Galileo passed closer
to Io than it has since it entered orbit around Jupiter in December 1995.  

BTW, the spacecraft is continuing to lower its orbit toward Io, the most
volcanic body in our solar system, in preparation for two closer flybys of
Io in October and November.  The upcoming flybys are expected to yield
images of unprecedented clarity and detail.  In case anyone isn\'t
familiar with Io, the radiation belts of Jupiter are very intense at Io\'s
distance from the huge planet, and this can disrupt spacecraft functioning.
If fact, it already has but the flight team was able to compensate for the
damage. Unfortunately, some rather valuable data was permanently lost.
To insure that Galileo will be able to perform science observations from
this
unique vantage point, the Galileo flight team is preparing contingency plans
to protect against radiation-related problems.

Most of the above was plagiarized shamelessly from an email I received from
NASA.

Oh, yeah. Expect the sites above to be absolutely overwhelmed.

People who grew up on metric and are not particularly measuring-unit-picky
have a tendancy to abbreviate millimeters as "mils", which, of course,
is a really, really bad thing to do. 6 mils != 6 millimeters.

I also read something where someone who used "clicks" for seconds, when
__everybody__ knows that a click is a kilometer. ;)

Anyway, since there have been a dozen digests since my last post, I\'ll reply
in bulk here...

While the definition of an amp using two infinitely thin, long wires may seem
hard to use for calibration, it\'s onviously a good model to use for doing
mathematical calculations. Presumably there\'s some sort of ugly integral
you\'re supposed to do to turn the standard definition into something more
useful.

The fundamental quantities, for those curious, are: length, mass, time,
electric current, therodynamic temperature, amount of substance & luminous
intensity. A free peanut for the first person to name all the units.
(Hint: http://www.its.bldrdoc.gov/fs-1037/dir-019/_2826.htm)

Ah-ha. (Sorry for the train of thought post here). The definition of a second,
from encyclopedia.com:

   "Since 1967 [the second] has been calculated by atomic standards to be
    9,192,631,770 periods of vibration of the radiation emitted at a 
    specific wavelength by a cesium-133 atom."

And as for engineers wearing messy lab coats... lab coats?? My sister had one
when she was doing her chem eng research, but us over the the computer
engineering building, we just had to make sure not to drop the waveguides on
our toes. :)

I like the rationalizations people are coming up with though.

Historically, many states have disbanded units for participating in coups.
However, when a unit performs miserably in battle I can remember more
instances where a unit is shamed and then given a chance to redeem
itself.  Perhaps in a suicide mission.  But even units that are completely
anhialated are usually reconstituted (like Germany\'s 6th Army and its
components).

Or that they were defeated soundly enough in, say, the Solomani Rim War,
that the number was retired until memories fade or the defeat is erased.
To trot out the Romans again, during the reign of Augustus, three entire
legions were wiped out in a surprise attack while on an expedition in 
Germany.  (Prompting the famous quote from Augustus, "Quintilius Varus,
give me back my legions!"  Considering that Varus had been decapitated
and partially burned by the Germans, he really couldn\'t respond.)  I
don\'t think the Romans reconstituted legions with those designations.

Should be; isn\'t that Five Sisters subsector?  That\'s the furthest 
extension of the Imperium to spinward, cut off from the main body of
the Imperium by the Sword Worlds and District 268 (vaguely under 
Imperial protection but unincorporated).

Umm, not quite.  What actually happened was a cross between that and 
Orion.  The ship had an Orion/style blast plate at the bottom, and a 
_ground_ based VRF Cannon fired explosive shells at it.  The shells were 
designed to go off just under the plate, and thus provide propulsion.

My point is that the fact that you can rotate 15 degrees in one second, starting from _no_ rotation, does _not_ imply a 24 second time to rotate 360 degrees.

yup.  I remember that.  I\'ve always assumed they exist to coreward.

One thing to keep in mind, is that IRL, cargo vessels have always exceeded 
military vessels in size.  Even a modern aircraft carrier is dwarfed by a 
supertanker.  Just remember that the cargo ship are mostly empty space, 
whereas military ships are all equipment....

Sounds about right, I haven\'t located the book yet to check but this is
a variation on the laser launch system the Pournelle seems to like a
lot, He\'s used them in several other works.

Possibly related to why they also don\'t use antimatter power plants and APAWS,
neither of which are obviously impossible in Traveller, and both of which are
available at GURPS TL 12.  The easiest assumption is that TL 12 in GT is
relatively early in GTL 12 (this would require errataing the Darrians to late
TL 12, but that\'s not obviously bad, a \'full\' TL 12 GURPS ship is considerably
more powerful than one limited to Imperial technology).

Yes, but do we care?  The point is that starships are sufficiently overpowered that flow characteristics aren\'t terribly important.

Shrug.  Or anything which you didn\'t put streamlining on.  Given that definition of streamlining, I\'m ok with saying unstreamlined ships can\'t enter atmosphere, its just that basically everything winds up being streamlined so it sort of doesn\'t matter ;).

Sure. Just not the same niece. This is the one that Ditzie wants to be when 
(if?) she grows up. This is also (unless he\'s got REALLY good anagathics)

It was in the Space 3e playtest, and was actually considered \'optional\'.  Basically a response to the problem that armor becomes irrelevant for large ships, which may or may not be realistic, but isn\'t particularly playable.  It shifts the damage formula from sqrt(E) to 10*E^1/3 for E>1,000,000.

What he said (although the actual GURPS formula uses "O" for "output
energy", and "E" for a different fudge factor).

Based on some side traffic with Sean Punch (the GURPS line editor), I
understood that this would be the official version, at least where GURPS
Space and GT were concerned. The spinal mounts and bay weapons in GT were
supposed to be errata\'ed for the 2d edition. I\'m still waiting to see what
was really printed.

This will ultimately require that the armor guidelines for GT: Imperial
Navy be redone, and probably some of the previously submitted designs
tweaked. Since I\'ve only just today gotten my computer unpacked, and I\'m
still surrounded by boxes as I type, it may take me a day or two to get to it.

A naval ship or squadron is assigned to commerce raiding behind enemy
lines.  They\'re still at it even though the war is over -- they just
haven\'t gotten the word yet, or perhaps their side lost and they\'re
unwilling to surrender, so they keep up the fight.  Naval vessels would
make much better pirate ships than commercial vessels, especially when
acting in as a squadron rather than a single ship.

Yes, but that was in the days before containerized shipping, automated bulk
loading/unloading and other technlogical inovations.  This was when
steveodores literally had to unload a ship full of boxes, drums and crates
by hand with nets on cranes, winches, etc. (think of "On the Waterfront").
It could take days to unload a ship.  And if the cargo was bulk - say grain
for example - it was shoveled out by hand.  Nowadays, containerized ships
are loaded/unloaded in a matter of hours.  And of course, pre-Suez was a
time when concerns about freight "getting lost" while between ships was very
real.  

Perhaps another comparison might be long distance common carrier trucking
firms (like, say ABF Freight).  Today, if I am shipping less than a
container of material from one place to another, ABF will send a truck to
the first location, pickup my material and bring it to their "local"
warehouse.  The first truck will be unloaded, and the material will be
loaded onto a second truck fo shipment to the "local" warehouse closest to
the destination.  And at this second "local warehouse" it will be unloaded
again and reloaded again onto a third truck for delivery to the destination.
So here we have a truck full of boxes, drums, vrates, pallets, etc. being
loaded and unloaded twice.  

Free traders, and other jump capable freight/cargo ships, fill the role of
the long distance haul between cities.  There needs to be local companies
avaialble to fill the roles at either end, though.  Someone has to pickup
the freight from the source locations and deliver it to the destinations.
This company will need to have warehousing available to sort out departing
and arriving loads of freight.  Where would these warehouses be?  In the
case of and individual freighter, his/her cargo hold is probably filled with
containers from a variety of locations and which are going to a variety of
destinations within a system.  Some of these destinations are dirt side (and
they can be anywhere on a planet - think of someone shipping material to
Terra - one ship could contain material for cities all over the planet) and
some are not (orbital stations, belter settlements, bases on moons and other
planets, etc.).  And of course, the same situation is true in the case of
the sources of the material.  Why warehouse material bound for the outer
system on the bottom of the main world\'s gravity well?  It just needs to be
lifted out again.  And as for freight whose destination is on the mainworld,
unless there is only one big city, freight could be bound for literraly
almost any spot on its surface.  Again, why should this warehouse be at one
spot within the gravitywell if the freight will just need to be picked up
and carried somewhere else.  Although, an efficient and cheap surface
transportation system (say waterborne shipping, high tech trains, or the
like) would make a central dirt-side warehouse possible.  

Perhaps larger freighters dock and unload at up-ports because with their
larger cargo holds they are more likely to be carrying freight bound for
destinations both dirt-side and out in the system. But smaller freighters
(with their smaller cargo holds) are loaded only with material bound for
either the up-port of the down-port only.  And of course, PC ships get
whatever\'s left over and what ever the GM finds reasonable.

Only if you stop thrusting and coast around the rest of the way. In fact, if
it takes one second of constant acceleration to cover 15 degrees, you will
have accelerated to a rotational speed of 30 degrees per second.

Assuming that acceleration (30 degrees per second per second), it should be
possible to spin the ship through 180 and stop in a little under five
seconds (by accelerating hard until the 90 degree point is reached, then
decelerating hard to stop.)

Not sure if this bears on the argument (I stopped paying attention some days
ago) but I thought I\'d chip it in.

>Against nuclear weapons, graphite _is_ really tough.  It requires an
enormous quantity of energy and very high temperatures to vaporize (weight
for weight, many times higher than steel), it mostly isn\'t bothered by
neutrons, and it conducts heat extremely well.  Incidentally, against
lasers, macrocrystalline graphite (with the planes aligned flat on the
surface) would be wonderful armor, it\'s incredibly hard to vaporize, and
would conduct heat away from the impact point very fast while conducting
quite poorly through the armor.


I meant tough in the engineering sense - as in "resistant to wear". My
concerns were less of neutron or thermal absorption, and more of skin
friction from rocket efflux. (I\'ve seen the steel efflux deflector behind a
Sea Dart launcher scoured to a mirror-finish by the exhaust from a missile
launch.)

I think, however, that we\'re talking at cross purposes, borne out of the
spaceport-launchpad/Orion-pusher-pad misunderstanding. In space the skin
friction problem is almost non-existant.

True and untrue. While it will spin the ship, it will also push it along. If
you can cancel the rotation by some other means (smaller manoevring
thrusters with a better angular position, for example), it may well be
possible to accelerate the ship along a non-axial line.

Speaking of units of measure...

i\'ve been reviewing the GURPS Traveller ship designs and have just a few
questions.

When a weapons maximum range is listed, is that in meters, kilofeet, what?
Also, does that mean a weapon will automatically miss beyond max range?

The tech levels appear to be 10 and 12.  Do these exactly correspond to
previous traveller tech levels?

"No" to your question on corresponding tech levels. That\'s one of the
major issues I have with GT. GT TL12 is roughly TL14-16 with some aspects
of TL17, as far as previous versions of Traveller go. GT TL10 is roughly
12-13.

Has anyone seen/done a TL by TL conversion of pre-GT TLs to corresponding
GT TLs? I seem to recall a discussion of "early/late TLs" but I can\'t
find the original posts.

	Nope, not close enough. All the forces acting on the ship are acting
all over ... and in some places the force acting *at that point* will
break it locally.

	Example: Sum up all the forces of a hurricane acting on a house. The
house doesn\'t go anywhere, therefore there\'s no problem. Except that
the portion of the forces acting on the window shattered the window,
the portion of the wind blowing over the roofline lifted the roof off

I honestly wouldn\'t recommend _anything_ from imperium games, and I definately

Except that there are \'advanced\' metals at every tech level. Weight is 2/3,
while cost is 3-1/3 more. For heavily armoured ships, like battleships,
this makes a significant difference.

The problem comes from the definition of USL. If you work through the
design process, you\'ll notice that a GT USL ship is, essentially, a giant
cube (or something approximating a cube in surface-to-volume ratio). Dave
Pulver (the designer of the GT ship contruction rules) has already stated
that in GT USL ships are equivalent to the MT Partly Streamlined ships.

My own solution is that USL ships can enter atmosphere if they go slowly
and pay attention to weather; this is, however, _not_ a routine operation
and should be role-played. Open framework and planetoid ships can\'t enter
atmosphere (OK, they can enter, but will require a miracle to land safely).

Yes, but Mr. Rao felt so bad about how much of a certain young lady\'s

	Nor is Greg Porter\'s interpretation what had already been written
into T4. *All* Fusion-Plus was supposed to be was a reduction in
*minimum* size, not an increase in efficiency (output per unit
volume).

And so ends a great experiment in measuring human ability to function in

Here is my recommendation. DO NOT ORDER FROM IMPERIUM GAMES!!

Go to Marc Miller\'s web site (you can follow the links from BITS\'
webpage at  http://www.bits.org.uk/ 

Look for (In my opinion, from the list you gave) FFS 1 or 2, Imperial
Squadrons.

Not listed would be High Guard (ver.2) and Trillion Credit Squadrons
(CT) for these you\'ll have to search OOP sources like Ebay or the
Traveller Trader to see what\'s available (ebay - www.ebay.com  Trav
Trader - www.downport.com and follow the links)

	According to an announcement from Marc, IG is prohibited from
selling any Traveller products as their license was not renewed.
However, products already in the distribution pipeline (i.e.
wholesaler, retailer, etc.) can still be sold.

Pick FF&S2 up ASAP (and make sure to download the errata).  For the
gearhead at heart.  I also recommend that you download Andrew Akins\'
FF&S2 Excel spreadsheet (if you have access to a computer that runs
Excel).  I don\'t have his URL ready-to-hand, but the ships posted on my
Web site all have their spreadsheets available for download.  You can
use them as examples, and, of course, once you download the spreadsheet,
you can modify the designs to your heart\'s content.

> Starships?

Avoid this one, as you would avoid swimming in nitrogen mustard.  This
book was broken from the first page to the last.  I\'m told that it makes
a tolerable emergency mouse pad.

> Emporer\'s Arsenal?

Not really useful for ship-to-ship combat, although it can help you get
a feel for boarding actions.

> Milieu:0?

Again, this one doesn\'t directly apply to your stated goal of designing
and fighting warships.  However, I\'m told that it\'s a reasonably good
campaign setting.

> Naval Architects Manual?

This will help you in devising deck plans.  Otherwise, not very useful
for starship combat.

> Imperial Squadrons?

This one gives you some roleplaying ideas for a naval campaign.  It also
gives strategic-level military/naval rules.  I\'d recommend it.
> 
> something I haven\'t listed?

You will need a decent set of starship combat rules.  I would recommend
one of two sets:

1.  Bruce Alan Macintosh\'s "Military Combat System."  I like this rule
set a lot, but I don\'t know from where to download it.  Bruce e-mailed
me my copy.  His e-mail address (at least, the one from which he posts
to the TML) is:

bruce.macintosh@worldnet.att.net

2.  Mayday M4.1, available for free download from BITS.  This updates
the original Mayday system for use with T4.  You can find it at:

http://www.bits.org.uk/

A caveat:  As another poster pointed out, _don\'t_ buy directly from
Imperium Games.  I would recommend that you look at the following sites
(in addition to the suggestions from other posts):

FFS2 was a really nice revision of FF&S that went astray from piss-poor
production and a schedule that was more suited to a
chewing-gum-and-sealing-wax nasty I-gotta-get-this-done-by-tonight hack
than what the authors intended it to be. (I STILL don\'t know how the
typsetters managed to turn an asterisk (denoting multiplication) into >
| < without noticing it, and since IG was so supremely confident of
their typsetters expertise, they never bothered to show anyone a galley
proof.

Not nearly enough time to playtest or reality check things, and lots of
good stuff got left on the cutting room floor.

Had FFS2 been what Guy and David INTENDED it to be it would have been a
phenomenal resource. :-(

Starships <puke> was awful.
NAM is only a deckplan resource, and a rather skimpy one at that.

None of the rest have anything to do with designing ships.

If IG is _still_ selling things they are doing so illegally, as last I
knew, Marc had gotten a court order preventing them from doing that.
Considering they didn\'t pay the authors for their work, I wouldn\'t buy
anything from them.

I understand that the hull skin is corroded to the point where it will 
shortly start leaking air anyway. We\'ll all just have to hope that the 
international station doesn\'t get murdered by some politician out for 
cheap votes.

On that note I finally got to read _Fallen Angels_ a few weeks 
back, and I was very impressed. It made up for _The Ringworld

For our group, starship encounters have but one major issue:
the weapons system.  The rest may be designed at our
leisure.  To that measure, then, what a "Dirty" Ship Design
System needs to serve us best is a simple table mapping
hull sizes to reasonable weapons arrays.

A ship of a given hull H will have nominal firepower N.
Increasing this firepower reduces other systems\' performance
from a design perspective.  Likewise, decreasing this firepower
improves other systems\' performance from a design perspective.

In the table below, three columns represent typical defenses
aboard a particular class of ship for the given hull volume
in displacement tons.  The defenses are organized into two
columns: \'M\' for missile turrets, and \'Laser\' for Laser turrets.

These values are somewhat arbitrary; my hopes are that others
out there in the list could contribute potential corrections,
observations, and extensions, and hopefully also find this kind
of table useful.

A possible improvement is to build a separate table containing
weapons arrays, from the most primitive to the most formidable
in reasonable mixes.  I could then refer to an entry in the weapons
table for more than one hull configuration below.

On those lines, has anyone thought about calculating a defense
factor based on installed defenses?

FFS? Version 2

Get this. + Errata from web. Not as clear as the GDW version, but a superb
resource.

>Starships?

Don\'t buy. Lousy broken book. The designs are broken, the deckplans are
drawn by a 5 year old, and the colour plates damage the SSDS design system
by breaking it up. You can download the SSDS design rules from the Missouri
Archive for free as a pdf (I think QSDS is there too). The Missouri archive
is linked off BITS (see below).

>Emporer\'s Arsenal?

Personal and vehicle weapons. Has a few notes on converting between scales.
Not really a starship design source.

>Milieu:0?

Background for MO - get the _Milieu 0 Campaign_ version not the original
_Milieu_ 0 Softcover as it has 32 pages of extra material and First Survey
thrown in.

>Naval Architects Manual?

Deck plans, some of which break Traveller canon. An okay resource.

>Imperial Squadrons?

Roleplaying background plus Fifth Frontier War/TCS rewritten to link to
Pocket Empires. There is no tactical level combat system like TCS included,
just the scenario rules.

>something I haven\'t listed?

Pocket Empires if you are interested in modelling the background economics.

Combat System:
1) Download the free MayDay M4.1 version PDF from BITS - it works with FFS
and QSDS/SSDS.
Http://www.bits.org.uk/ on the archive page

2) Try the Role Playing Ship Combat System V0.9 from the Missouri archive.
This is good for player level stuff/

3) Have a look at MCS by Bruce Macintosh if you can find it.

4) Consider the HG to T4 conversion rules by Rob Eaglestone on my site
http://www.cybergoths.u-net.com/

BUT DON"T BUY THEM OFF IMPERIUM GAMES! They didn\'t pay the authors and they
are effectively out of business. Try Marc Miller directly (he has old
Traveller material - linked off BITS website jump site pages) or the retail
trade loop.

I\'ve just seen something great - the cover for our new adventure \'SpaceDogs\'.

It\'s been produced by the TML\'s very own Jesse DeGraffe
(http://www.vision-forge-graphics.com/) and has an Empress Marava Far
Trader in distress. It looks really nice! The book should be out on
Thursday next, but I\'ll try and get a small version up, along with the
cover for the Khiidkar Incident this weekend.

Speculation in both senses of the word.  Some merchant of Gatesian wealth

Something to think about. But I still think it is an error.

It is my understanding that each fleet has a reserve fleet at the same
location.
i.e.: The 212th at Regina also having the 1212th reserve fleet stationed
along side.
The main difference being the extra "1" at the begining.

No excuses. I did hear that there are several new typing classes being

True, many good ideas flying about.
I do hope that it will be sorted out in G:T Imperial Navy.

In which case they are missing the point. The debate starts every time
with someone asking "The rules say that USL ships can\'t land on planets
with atmospheres. Why can\'t they?"

So the from the start, it\'s a *given* that the USL ships *aren\'t*
designed to enter atmospheres. Otherwise the rules would say something
different.

Ok, *partially* streamlined is not the "unstreamlined" that\'s been
discussed here.

Actually, you\'ll want to keep the velocity as low as possible. Meteoric
re-entry tends to tear chunks off ships not designed for it. 

I\'d suspect that it takes less power to *forget* the inertial
compensators, and decel at the max you are willing to subject the ship
& crew to. 

Ignoring losses, it\'s going to take the same amount of energy to brake
to a stop whether you do it at high accel in a few seconds, or at lower
accel over the course of several minutes. 

And at the lower accel, you cover *more* distance during the decel
phase, which may well be useful in getting rid of that excess altitude.


You might get a slight advantage from the "braking" effect of the air,
but if your speed is high enough for that to be a factor, then those
same aerodynamic forces are strong enough to rip chunks off the ship.
And the heating could be a problem too. 

Just keep in mind that the Space Shuttle makes it from ground to orbit
in a "few minuts" at only 3 g. So doing the reverse is easy too. 

In one minute, a 6 g drive can move you 108,000 km. And drop your
velocity by 3.6 km/sec. Since orbital velocity for Earth is about 8
km/sec, it should only take about two and a quarter minutes to kill
orbital velocity. It\'ll take 13 minutes at 1 g. Better have your CG
working. 

Something that can be done by airframe hulls is "skipping" off the
upper atmosphere. Hit the atmosphere at a shallow angle, and you\'ll
"bounce" like a stone being skipped across water. And the bounce will
absorb a fair amount of enery without *too* much heating. After several
skips, you\'ll be quite a ways around the planet from the first skip,
and at a velocity of only Mach 5 or so. Maybe as little as Mach 1. So
from that point you can "glide" in. 

This may account for the deck layout on Type S scouts and some small
merchants. It allows for a somewhat stealthy approach. The ride is
pretty bumpy, but it\'ll save a lot of fuel. 

BTW, "pretty bumpy" means it\'s worse than the nastiest rollercoaster
you\'ve ever ridden.

Streamlined have to make "straight in" approach, but get down
faster. BTW "straight in" tends to be at some angle from the vertical,
to take advantage of the streamlining.

Partially streamlined have to make a slower approach, but still go
"straight in". Though they prefer more vertical aproaches.

Unstreamline hope that the weather is favorable. They then secure
themselve well to their seats, place their heads between their knees
and kiss their ass goodbye. :-)

For "blast pits" at a spaceport, I\'d run *lots* of water over something
strong but cheap. Concrete with some extra fire-resistance seems to do
well. 

I\'ve speculated that for places that can\'t afford to use *huge* amounts
of water for this sort of thing, *sand* might be useful. You\'d have the
same *huge* "pipes" to channel the exhaust off to someplace else. But
instead of spraying water tto keep the sides cool, you\'d "spray" fine
sand. It\'d absorb heat by melting, and maybe even vaporizing a little. 

Sure, you\'d have more maintenance in "scraping" the slag deposits off
the sides of the "pipes" every so often. But it *might* protect them
more than damage them. 

Or maybe just using deep pits full of sand, and hauling out the slag
between uses would work?

No, it definitely wasn\'t the "launch from a cannon" bit. Though they
*may* have used a "small" cannon" type arrangement to give some extra
initial velocity. 

I definitely remember the continuall pounding as the guns/explosive
charges fired. The shaking was bad enough to give the pilot (a woman,
because they are generally "tougher" than men) internal injuries.

Sorry, but the flow characteristics *do* matter. If flow goes
turbulent, the buffeting could be *really* bad news.

Well, you should remember from the old days, I never liked
arbitrary rules that existed for no other reason than to preserve
some poorly thought-out background explanation intact. They tend 
to wreak havoc with the necessary "suspension of disbelief"...

It better be a real damn good reason. Please don\'t tell me it\'s
because they\'re all used in the transponders ;-)

Which is the classic TML answer to half-baked published designs.
The huge flood of MT designs in the archives came about in response
to the poorly designed ships originally published in Megatraveller.

Maybe these missing fleets had the same fate befall them.

IMHO Performing miserably would receive a poor rating for that fleet and
"on the wrong side" would have the crew imprisoned and the ships
repainted and redeployed to needy fleets.

That sounds about right.

Yes, a tragic defeat, like being caught off guard, would be one reason.

        I have seen a few different approaches.  I personally run a
non-canon CT PBEM.  I have all the users post thier characters actions set
in chronological order to me.  I then take that information and synthsize a
narrative out of it and mail it back to the players.  That starts the cycle
again.  See my TNEC website for how it looks as finished product.

        Another popular approach is using a mailing list server and playing
essentially as though sitting around the table in terms of dialog flow.
This approach is *mucho* easier on the ref than the way I do it...  which
means the rate of play tends to be higher.

        Last variant is using chat systems like IRC and ICQ to play a
session in \'real time\', again as though sitting around the gaming table.
Biggest issue is getting everyone to be available at the same time.

        I am also toying with starting a "Merchant Prince" PBEM using a

An emulation of WHICH Traveller?  CT books 1-3, CT + all the supplements,
CT+Striker, MT, TNE, T4, TDR? Even with the same ruleset, MTU and YTU can
look radically different. I personally am delighted that the various GT
authors have taken the opportunity to clean up a lot of the vagaries and
inconsistancies in the CT, 3I background that used to drive GMs nuts
trying to explain away and prompted incessant arguments on the TML.
(Seems like rock-throwing and piracy are still with us, though...)

I like the differentiation I see these days on the TML between MTU
(My Traveller Universe) and OTU (Official Traveller Universe) and maybe
YTU (Your Traveller Universe).  It\'s a distinction that used to be
forgotten in the endless discussions of what was "sacred" Canon and
what wasn\'t.

They have?  When? Where?  The only FAQ I have seen is so ancient,
it is identical to the one I got the first time I joined the TML,
back in the early MT days. I heed common courtesy, but dadgumit!
This is the TRAVELLER Mailing List, therefore fit for all things 
Traveller.

Sounds like a personal problem. OTOH, I consider TNE an aberration 
best forgotten, though I like FF&S1.  I consider GT the first *real*
Traveller since the earliest days of MT. The background is right,
the rules support the background rather than creating inconsistancies
with it, and there\'s some really good work being done with it.

When the hell did that happen?  Gearheads *were* the heart & soul
of the TML 8-10 years ago. Traveller is a Science Fiction game with
advanced technology--take out the engineering and science and what\'s
left? Politics & religion? 

And who decrees what is "un-Travelleresque"?  You? The Traveller
Game police? With 11,000 worlds of varying tech levels, you can justify
damn near anything within the range of those tech levels.  Just because
it hasn\'t been seen in published Traveller material doesn\'t mean
a thing/place/race can\'t exist--maybe we just haven\'t visited that
world yet, or looked at that aspect of society.

Okay, then don\'t read those letters. Simple.  But don\'t bother trying
to tell me (or anyone else) what I can and cannot post, unless you
have replaced Rob Prior as moderator in recent years.

The ruleset used defines the game: it does not work to say
in your background that everyone emfozzes A if your rules make
emfozzing a rare, impossible-to-learn skill and A\'s are too
expensive for anyone but the most wealthy to afford. (The 
classic game rule example is AD&D rules for creating magic items,
and the vast numbers of trivial magic items littering most AD&D
games. There have been similiar glitches in Traveller rulesets.). 

Therefore, Rules are as important as Background (I assume that
Background is what you mean by "Traveller first"). I do not
understand your disdain for "min-maxing", as any rules should
be pushed to see what their limits are--you need to know where
the ruleset falls apart, so it can be fixed or taken into consideration.
Some extremes of design have given me new ideas and new insights
into the game universe. OTOH, I have no idea who Cliff and Leroy
were, they seem to have been after my time.  Must have been
bad, as the names seem to frighten people when mentioned. Anyone
want to clue me in?

I am puzzled by your obvious hostility to GURPS:Traveller,
a system I find so elegant and delightfully well-supported that
I have decided to convert my campaign-in-search-of-a-ruleset
over to it. GT seems a worthy heir to CT, at least as good
as MT (without that be-damned Rebellion), and much better than
the atrocity TNE made of the OTU.

Meter, Kilogram, second, ampere, kelvin, mole, candela.

I\'m not sure about that last one. Also, I\'m one of the "heretics" who
considers radian and steradian as fundametal. Which means I consider
torque to have "radian" in the units. (newton-meter/radian?)

From the CRC Handbook:

Second - The second is the duration of 9 192 631 770 periods of the
radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine
levels of the ground state of the cesium-133(13th CGPM, 1967).

Meter - the meter is the length of path travelled by light in vacuum
during a time interval of 1/299 792 458 of a second(17th CGPM, 1983).

Kilogram - The kilogram is the unit of mass; it is equal to the mass of
the international prototype of the kilogram (3rd CGPM, 1901).

Ampere - The ampere is that constant current which, if maintained in
two straight parallel conductors of infinite length, of negligible
circular cross-section, and placed one meter apart in vacuum, would
produce between these conductors a force equal to 2x10^-7 netwton per
meter of length (9th CGPM, 1948).

Kelvin - The kelvin, unit of thermodynamic temperature is the fraction
1/273.16 of the thermodynamic temperature of the triple point of water.
(13th CGPM, 1967).
 
I\'ll skip the mole and candela, unless folks are *really* interested. :-)

Note that the kg still refers to an actual physical object, rather than
a reproducible measurement of some sort.

Yea, you are right, we don\'t want them back. Although there is no damage
to any of the ships, there is a mono-molecular layer of dog slobber that
smells of rotting Alpo, and all of the toilets are lacking water. ;P

Everyone says this about bad game books, but when I use \'em for mousepads, I
can\'t get any traction. Only book in my library that gives traction is
"Orations of Demosothenes"(sp?), because of the fabric cover. Like I would
use /that/ for a mousepad. The Hypercleats Terminal that I am on now has a

And that\'s the problem - you _could_ make it that much thicker in the
timespan involved, but only if you plough most of your homeworld\'s
economic output into it. If you have something like a Dilgar War or (to
bring it back to Traveller) an Interstellar War or N (which are at about
the same time as B5 is set), then you won\'t have the money to do it
because you\'re too busy building warships.

And they cheated, just a little too, IIRC.  The capsule didn\'t
actually make *orbit* it just went into space on a very high
tragetory.  This probably *shouldn\'t* have qualitied them as
"spacefaring", but again, IIRC, the local Imperial representative
was friendly and didn\'t tell the entire story back at Capitol just
that they *had* put a man in space.  ;->

Of course, I didn\'t read the *book*, I read the four part serial in
Analog Magazine, so things might have changed by the time it became
a book.

Yes, please don\'t send attachments, but don\'t stop creating and
making available all the neat stuff you come up with.

Instead, of an attachment consider posting a url or email address
where we can get a copy of whatever you wanted to send as an

You might, or might not.  It depends on a lot of things.  I\'m
playing in several PBEM\'s, and GMing a couple at the moment.  I\'ve
been active in PBEM RPing for 10 years now and I can say that the
experience is *different* from FTF gaming, but it isn\'t inferior.

PBEM RPing requires everything that a FTF game does and more.  In
addition to creativity, a sense of fun (if not humor) and the
ability to spin a good yarn you have to have the ability to write a
good post putting all that in writing.  You have to be able to
visualize a scene from a written description and not only *enjoy*
doing it, but be able to give it right back to the GM and all the
other players.  And, not least, it requires a lot of patience and
stamina.

The need for writing and reading skills are obviously due to the
nature of the medium where almost everything happens in writing.
The GM posts background, descriptions of the scene and the dialog
and actions of the NPCs. The players respond for their characters
explaining what they want to do and what the PC\'s say in posts.
A flurry of posts cross back and forth between the players and
GM as the PC\'s and NPC\'s talk and interact and the scene progresses.
The GM has to take all the posts and integrate them, resolve actions
telling the players what happened and continue to post descriptions
and NPC actions.  

It isn\'t uncommon for a player to post two or three times a day and
there to be twenty or more posts total each day.  If the players and
GM don\'t enjoy reading and writing, they won\'t enjoy the PBEM RP
experience...they won\'t stick with it.

The need for patience and stamina is because PBEMing just takes a
*lot* of time for much to happen, and as you can see from the
previous paragraph a lot of time each day just to stay up with the
game.  For example it\'s taken 2 real years to play 3 game months in
my AKUS MOBY game, and this has been 2 years of continuous play with
no downtime or breaks.  PC\'s go off on their own and/or get ahead of
the others, then they have to wait until the others catch up.  Real
life intrudes, from time to time, and illness, work, holidays take
players away and the others have to go slow (or put up the the GM
NPCing the missing players).

It\'s also true that sometimes players simply go AWOL, and have to be
dropped.  This can slow things down and make for discontinuities in
the game.  It can be very disheartening for the GM when a player
who has a character in the middle of a plot just disappears.  I
guess being stubborn, and refusing to give up on a game, is a
requirement for PBEM RPing too.

IMO, though, PBEM RPing is a very rewarding experience.  I\'ve been
able to play with and become friends with many excellent people from
around the world...people I would never get a chance to play with
otherwise.  I am able to give my roles and moves, as player, a lot
more thought than I ever could at the table in FTF games.  As GM, I
also have the ability to work with the players (and their PC\'s) as
individuals, allowing us to run many private sub-plots and
breakaways from the whole group, even to explore aspects of the PC\'s
"inner life" that simply can\'t be done at the game table.  And just
as a practical matter, it has let me continue to play Traveller
consistently when I couldn\'t find a FTF game.

You asked for it....


Mole - The mole is the amount of substance of a system which contains
as many elementary entities as there are atoms in 0.012 kilogram of
carbon-12. When the mole is used, the entities must be specified and
may be atoms, molecules, ions, electrons, other particles, or specified
groups of such particles (14th CGPM, 1971).

Candela - The candela is the luminous intensity, in a given direction,
of a source that emits monochromatic radiation of frequency 540X10^12
hertz and that has a radiant intensity in that direction of (1/683)
watt per steradian (16th CGPM, 1979).

If the Imperium is early GTL12, then it just has \'expensive\' metals
available to it. But other states, in the later phases of their tech
levels, should have advanced metals. So far we\'ve seen \'typical\' ships from
the Imperium, Vargr, Zhodani, Aslan, and K\'kree, and none of them have used
advanced metal.

I think I\'ll play around with some GTL10 ships, both military and civilian,
and see how significant the effects are.

Also, I suspect that the Sword Worlds, being mostly GTL9, would get the
most benefit from advanced materials. I\'ll post a few redesigned ships once
I modify GT Shipyard.

Not in GURPS Traveller.  According to the starship construction sequence
designer (David Pulver), in GURPS Traveller SL ships are the MegaTraveller
Airframe ships, while USL ships are the MegaTraveller Partially
Streamlined. Open Frame and Planetoid ships (OF & PL? hopefully coming in
GT: Starships) will be the equivalent of MegaTraveller Unstreamlined.

This will hopefully be errataed in the second edition of GT, to clear up
the confusion.


However, to avoid confusing ourselves, maybe we should use words rather
than configuration codes. Alternately, attach the game system to the code.
For example:

GT:SL ships are designed as radically streamlined lifting bodies, and may
safely enter an atmosphere at transsonic speeds. GT:USL ships are not
streamlined, but are compact designs; most are capable of entering
atmospheres at low speeds, although \'heavy weather\' can be a severe danger.

I was thinking more along the lines of making \'expensive metal\' the best

No. But they _are_ vulnerable to the Empress Wave. :-)

This would be a break from Classic Traveller practice. Would it be a
significant one?

What do people think? Would having military ships use heavier frames and/or
more advanced armour upset the \'look-and-feel\' of Traveller?

Case in point. GT: Imperial Navy will be the GT FSotSI, hopefully with none
of the flaws that product has. But to do that we have to ensure two things:
(1) the designs should be good Traveller designs using the GURPS design
rules, and (2) the GT-specific flavour of the GURPS design rules needs to
have its limitations clearly spelled out.

Exactly. We discuss Traveller, not modern geopolitics, religion, and the
latest paris fashions. We also refrain from personal invective. Cynthia,
were you around during the "Clif Incident"?  That is the kind of thing we
don\'t tolerate (and Rob Miracle suspended Clif\'s access to this list -
which I think is a TML first).

Actually, we\'ve always had that kind of common-sense limit. One edition of
the rules (FFS1?) had no lower limit on meson guns. The kind of min-maxing
gearhead being complained about would have insisted that that made meson
pistols legal, while the rest of us figured that it was an errate for the
design rules.

In this context, I think the original poster is equating "min-maxer" with
"munchkin". If you reread the post thinking "munchkin" whenever you see
"minmaxer" you\'ll see what I mean.

We still do gearhead stuff. Scott Streibech would fit right in.

Exactly. But there\'s a difference between pushing the rules until they
break then fixing them, and insisting that the rules can\'t be altered.

GURPS is not the original Traveller ruleset. We are still in the stages of
figuring out what GURPS options to include in GURPS Traveller. That means
that we push the rules, but it also means that we accept that GURPS
Traveller will have limits.

As an obvious example, just because FTL radio is included in GURPS
Vehicles, we wouldn\'t include it in GT because that violates one of the
basic elements of teh Traveller background (that communication is limited
to the speed of travel).

The \'outrageous\' battledress mentioned earlier using the Vehicles rules to
design battledress that was totally impervious to most military weapons.
This isn\'t how we\'ve always seen battledress in Traveller, and there was a
long and somewhat rancorous debate about how to handle it.

It\'s been a while, eh?

Leroy insisted that the Rule of Man had a high tech level. He was always
going to post his \'evidence\' in support of this, but never did. He also got
fairly abusive, for example, insisting that his friend\'s deer-hunting skill
meant that his friend knew more about rifles than Doug Berry (an
ex-sniper). He also made thinly veiled personal threats.

Clif was a troubled individual who had some very strange ideas. At one
stage he was accounting for  over half the posts on the TML! He got
personally abusive multiple times, was suspended by Rob once, and
eventually resigned just before Rob was going to cut him off permanently.

So far, the AuricTech designers have been able to approach, but not yet
meet, these design specifications (using FF&S2).  By using TL-15
materials and techniques, we have been able to, on a base hull of 50,000
dtons, achieve a jump-3 ship, carrying 4 10,000 dton freightliners (for
a final size of 90,000 dtons).  Other parameters are broadly similar to
the specifications above.  Your suggestion that the tender be able to
use the jump drives of the carried craft to supplement its own jump
drive does not appear to be feasible.  However, we are still
experimenting with using power couplings from the carried ships, to
assist in charging the tender\'s jump capacitors.  The ability to do so
will depend in part on our final design for the Tebryn-class
freightliner.

IMTU, it is simply unexplained.  Obviously *some* precursor
civilization(s) did extensive terraforming in this this part of the
galaxy, but it was far, *far* back.  It must have been a million
years or more, to have been as extensive as it is and leave zero
evidence of who or how.  Then why are a few 2,000 mile planets still
with dense atmospheres?  It\'s a puzzle, a mystery, and something
that *worries* people that think it though.

Who, or what, was behind this?  What happened to them?  Are they
still around...somewhere?  Is terraforming still happening?  All
unanswered questions.

Even Grandfather...if there *is* a Grandfather...has no answers.  I
imagine what would most worry him, if he existed, is "Why did they
do it, and are they coming back?"  ;->

So, am I involking "the ancients?"  Maybe, but not GDW\'s ancients.
Besides, this is a mystery that the players and their characters may
never solve.  (I\'m tempted to simply say they *can*not* solve it, but
I don\'t mind letting them try, and you never know they might,
someday, find what they think is the answer.)

Heck!  The GM doesn\'t have to worry about a *real* explaination if
it\'s "just a mystery that no one has ever figured out."  I don\'t
have many of them, but this *is* one. ;->
