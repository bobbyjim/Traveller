Personally, I recommend putting in the main drive elements first --
jump drive and fuel, HEPlaR and CG, power plant for the HEPlaR and
its\' fuel, and enough fuel for the minimum number of G-turns you
want the ship to have.  Then roughly figure out your crew needs for
just that.  That covers most of the ship volume right there, and
you know right away if things look tight.  You can add more power
plant, G-turns, and staterooms later when you need them.  

For staterooms, the standard designs tend to put Command in single
small staterooms and the rest of the crew doubled in the large
staterooms.  I tend to follow BR plateaus for armor factors, and
not to skimp on it.  I more lightly armor civilian ships, but if
they are big they put on a fair amount too.

Incidentally, has anyone else noticed the upper limit on starship
size in FF&S?  Try building a jump-6 800000 d-ton sphere.  You
can\'t.  Jump radiator surface area is tied to drive volume, so
it grows cubically while surface area only grows roughly as the
square of ship size.  The max spherical diameter at a jump size
is (18/<drive percentage>) in meters, assuming nothing else is on
the hull -- like airlocks or sensors.  You can get around this
a little by using other configurations, like needle/wedge.  But
then again, the crew sizes get obscene compared to MT for big
starships anyway.

   I don\'t think they are all target designators, if that is what you mean.
 With modern surface ships, a standard 76mm auto-cannon has several
"gunners" (six per mount, I think).  They are mainly for *maintainence* of
the weapon, as opposed to firing it.  So, 128 for a gun *that* size isn\'t
unreasonable.

I\'m kinda lucky in the fact that my hobby store does always order a
copy or two (since the owner knows I\'ll be picking it up).  But the
number of copies that he gets has dwindled down.

As for viens popping out all over the place.  Well, let me just say
this (yes, I\'m gonna bitch and complain, and reminise about the good
\'ol days for just a second).  The one thing that I really liked about
MT was that even though it was suppossed to start off in the Spinward
Marches, you could get source material for another place on the map,
and another type of campaign.  Rebellion Sourcebook, Hinterworlds and
Julian Protectorate Supplements, DGP\'s grand tour of the Imperium,
etc...  In other words, GDW, you\'ve been way too slow in getting out
this Regency Sourcebook, and way too eager to keep cramming this RCES
crap down our throats...

 Persephone has always been noted as just a whistle-stop on the Strouden -
 Glisten xboat route.  Most traders, pre-Collapse and today, have not even
 bothered to land on Persephone itself.  Instead, they merely refulled at
 the the Gas Giant Demeter (diameter: 84,329 km), which Persephone orbits
 around.
 
 A flotilla of ships and small space stations, greeting the local traveller
 near Demeter\'s norhtern polar regions, glistens like red stars against the
 planetary tempests below. This flotilla serves a vital purpose for local
 traffic: providing fuel (both refined and unrefined) and basic repair
 services, which the small, TL A local starport cannot provide. The
 flotilla is a transient affair, growing larger as more traffic passes
 through Persephone, fading away as traffic weakens.
 
 There is no organization in the flotilla: each and every ship is a law onto
 itself.  There _are_ a few common characteristics shared by nearly all of
the
 thousand or so ships and stations: they are all registered with nearby
 Strouden (Lunion: Spinward Marches/2327  A745988-D), never set foot on
 Persephone itself, and have a running vendetta against the local Persephone
 System Guard regarding taxes and tarrifs.  Although hostilities between
 the Guard and the flotilla rarely break out into violence, there is a near
 continual game of hide and seek between them.  The Guard strives to record
 every major transaction while the flotilla conspires to hide "the Big
 Stuff" from the Guard and their ugly taxes. 
   
 Approaching Persephone the casual traveller can easily make out the Dam
 Aspshii, a major sea covering 1/3 of the surface area of Persephone.  This
 circular sea is widely believed to have been the result of either a
 massive impact crater or the work of the local Keo Neseb civilization. 
 While my scout ship - the R.S.S Aurora - did not dock at the high port, we
 did take a pass.  The port seems to be nothing but a long communication
 antenna, with a stub at the end for insystem shuttles and living space.
 
 The small size of Persephone Lowport - it can hold the grand total of 1600
 Disp worth of craft, total - is fabled thoughout the subsector.  I counted
 at least 47 craft on my sensors waiting to land.  According to legend, a
 messanger with an Imperial Warrent, waiting to speak to the King himself,
was
 left waiting in orbit for 52 hours as traffic untangled itself.  One large
 merchant, which needed the ENTIRE starport to land, waited for an entire
 month until finally the port was freed for landing.  The fact that the
 port can only repair ships to TL A does not endear it any more deeply to
 hard-pressed merchantmen.
 
 The current activist monarch, Queen Ashki, is laying plans to expand the
 starport drastically.  Already construction has finally begun on a new
 starport just outside of the system capital of Ki Didimgamu, finally
 laying to rest the jokes of a "starport smaller than a Tirken\'s mouth".
 (especially since the Moran Tirken doesn\'t even _have_ a mouth, just a
small,
 noticable pore.)
 
 My pilot waited two hours in orbit, but we finally landed at the Scout Way
 Station rather than the Lowport.  The station administrator laughed at my
 troubles, and she promptly swamped me with tales of \'backyard landings\'
 and \'running touchdowns\', leaving me helpless with laughter. 
 
 The next day, I took an air/raft to the Lowport.  If you examine the Law
 Code closely, you\'d realise that these is NO TRADE LAW on Persephone. 
 This makes for cutthroat trading, indeed.  This also makes Persephone The
 Source for all sorts of goodies you can\'t find anywhere else in the
 subsector.  I recommend that only experienced traders visit Persephone\'s
 Giilumadgii Trade District, people who _know_ what they\'re doing.
 
 The careful reader would have also noted that there are no crystals, ores,
 or metals that are mined on Persephone.  This is because the old resources
 were mined out by a long-dead civilization called the Keo Neseb.  An
 insectoid race, looking more like a giant praying mantis than anything
 else, they originated on Penkwar (Lunion: Spinward Marches/2128 X978000-0),
a
 Red Zone world a parsec from Persephone.  They seem to have reached their
 apex about eight million years ago, and most likely changed Persephone\'s
 and Harvosette\'s atmosphere to it\'s current state.  No one knows what has
 become of them, although a few archeological digs were made on Penkwar. 
 
 Among the most important changes that has occurred on Persephone
 is a change of personality.  For centuries, Persephonians were considered
 "Unagressive/Peasable" rather than "Expansionistic/Nilitant".  However,
 the old easygoing attitude dissapeared due to the great (local)
 economic crash of 1179.  The people, led by the young, aggressive
 Queen, have changed drastically, so don\'t trust the old starman tales or
 out-of-date guidebooks.  
 
 Giilumadgii itself - the major startown on Persephone - is a rather pretty
 town of 72,000, set in the Aziramam Badlands, a heavily forested, cold
 region in the southern hemisphere of Persephone.  The Persephonians
 themselves are rather distant from outworlders.  While always polite, I
 have never seen one smile in my presence.  Outside of Giilumadgii, children
 run from me and my crew, and adults only answer my questions EXACTLY,
 forceing me to dig to learn anything.
 
 It should be noted here that Galanglic is spoken only to foreginers. 
 Among themselves, Vilani is the common tongue.  My Tobian engineer, who
 speaks Vilani himself, claimes that Persephonian Vilani is strongly
 accented, but still can be understood: but the written language is
 something else entirely!  Apperantly, their elegant script, using glyphs
 and symbols to stand for particular ideas, is not related to written
 Vilani at all.  This greatly surprised me: almost always, the spoken word
 changes but the written word remains highly stable.  It certainly doesn\'t
 metamorph into something completely different.  I fear that it would take
 years for a foreginer to master written "Persephonian".
 
 The local\'s name for their world is Mudemzalushush, but they call
 themselves Ushamai (as do their related folks at Harvosette (Lunion:
 Spinward Marches/2129 C330737-9)).  Local cities are not domed archeologies
as
 on most worlds with tainted atmospheres, but rather like a warren of
 long steel corridors, with houses and public spaces being dome "nodes"
 connected by one or two corridors. [Incidentally, the airborne taint -
 which takes about a day of exposure before convulsive vomiting begins,
 leading eventually to death by dehydration  - is exactly the same as on
 Harvosette, only with greater concentration there.]  The domes are always
 above ground: the corridors may be above or below ground.
 
 In private homes, the walls have engravings and are painted with bright
 abstract patterns.  Some of the more traditional people still put up
 "wood" venners from the local flora.  The more wealthy folk buy offworld
 holographic projectors.  In the very few elite homes I was allowed to
 enter (exactly two: both actually owned by offworlders) the new fashion is
 to embed the walls with strips of black marble, with white or silver
 engravings on them.
 
 I feel that a brief summary of local history would not be amiss to the
 casual traveller, so here goes.  The Persephonians first settled here during
 the 420\'s, as political/religious refugees from Corridor.  Here, they
created
 their society around Gekashiishaa (their political/economic ideology)
 and Nominolus (their religious beliefs).  They prospered and \'kept
 balance\' for centuries until the Second Civil War, when Glisten was lost
 to the wicked Aslan.  The loss of Glisten slashed trade volume through
 Persephone, striking an economic blow to Persephone that slowly, inevitabily
 let to the Crisis of \'79.  Then, the newly coronated Queen saved her crown
 and Persephone independence fron their creditors, at the cost of general
 living standards.  Her expansionist policies have brought Persephone a new
 spirit of greatness and hope, but most people still have not recovered
 back to pre-Crash years.
 
 I eventually found myself in Kigiirpaku Limis, the major holy site on
 Persephone, and home to seven million priests, acloytes, confessors and
 attendant bureaucrats.  Unlike most cities, Kigiirpaku is set in a
 arological bubble covering the entire city, allowing a freedom of movement
 hard to find in Persephone cities.  An unfortunate side effect, though, is
 that local temperature control is poor (whether deliberate or not, I don\'t
 know), so the heat from the noonday sun realy cooks.
 
 The local faith - called "Naminalus", Vilani for Balancing - centres on a
 triune God, but composed of Time/Space/Energy rather than the Christian
 conception of Father/Son/Spirit.  The goal of the Naminalii Kuk Kusili - a
 follower of Naminalus, or "Maintainer of the Balance" - is to maintain the
 Balance demanded by God, by keeping the forces of Time, Space and Energy in 
 Balance throughout their life.  By doing so, a form of immortality is
 granted to the believer, being merged with the "Universal Balance" that
 all life depends on.
 
 For a long time, the priests of Naminalus was concerned only with fellow
 believers on Persephone, Harvosette and Strouden.  But now, as the old
 faith in Gekashiishaa fades away, the Queen - a strong believer - is
 urging the priesthood to spread the faith, to help restore Balance
 throughout the Regency, and eventually - especially - throughout the
 ex-Imperial Wilds.  "Seekers" (Naminalusian mossionaries) are now being
 sent throughout the subsector, and are causing quite a bit of comment,
 both good and bad.
 
 Finally, I went to Ki Didimgamu, the capital of Persephone.  An undersea
 city, set under Une Didimgamu (Lake Didimgamu), it houses 138 million
 people and is the largest city on Persephone.  It is very much a _Royal_
 city, proud of it\'s Vilani heritage.  Most prevelant here is the
 Digamu, the ruling elite of Persephone, and their entourange.  One of the
 most surprising aspects here is the absolute ease that the richly
 dressed rulers move through the commoners, many without any bodyguards.  
 
 As a lark, I sent a video message to the Palace, persenting myself as a
 Regency Scout asking for an interview.  And not only was their a response,
 but the answer was yes!  Well, a virtual interview, anyway.  The contents
 of the interview is available elsewhere, but I can vouch for the fact that
 the Queen is quite a remarkable woman, with a strong \'presence\' that is
 unmistakable.  
 
 Among the more strangest sounds I have heard in my 24-year career as a
 scout was the Mortiousa Melody, often heard in the poorer quarters of
 the city.  The best I can describe it is as a combination of Latin Chant and
 Cantonese Popsongs, with a fast samba beat.  I have no idea how the poor
 folks sleep at night, it sounds so bad to my ears.  Moreover, it is a
 tradition to never let the song die, but to pass it on from singer to
 singer.

  I recently sent to the list a two-message (roughly 200 lines)
  discussion on Stutterwarp to the list.  By the time you see this, 
  it may or may not have reached the list, and I will be attempting 
  to recover it and repost it (or failing that, I will rewrite it 
  from scratch - I still have my figures).  To summarize, 
  Stutterwarp allows ships to make faster interstellar transits 
  with a smaller drive system, using microscopic amounts of fuel.  
  The biggest drawback is the 7ly (just over 2pc) "charge" buildup 
  limit, followed by the 40hr discharge time.  If loading and 
  unloading (to/from ship\'s boats or shuttles) can be conducted 
  during the discharge operation, free and far traders are 
  revolutionized.  If not, it\'s still pretty good, and in any case, 
  interstellar commuting and day trips become feasible.

  What I\'d like from the List is an analysis - suppose the 
  JumpSpace Institute were to develop Stutterwarp, and the military 
  had no interest, releasing it immediately for civilian use.  
  Suppose also that any Class A or B shipyard with TL12 
  capabilities could construct Stutterwarp ships from the keel up.  
  What do you think the Regency/Imperium/RC/polity-of-choice would 
  look like in 5, 10, 25, 50, 100 years?  Please cite your reasons 
  for thinking so, and let\'s engage in lively debate - it may be 
  the most interesting alternate universe resulting from a single 
  technology change, that doesn\'t change the fundamental assumption 
  of Traveller (that commo is no faster than travel).

   The answer is, that depends.  There are any number of variables,
armament, speed, fuel tankage, sensors, stealth, protection, etc.  My ships
tend to have moderate amounts of armor, large quantities of armament
(far beyond the mythical "1 socket per 100 displacement ton limit" that
used to exist), the best in sensors at the TL, and some redundacy with
regard to key systems (especially antennas) which get broken a lot.

   Yes, it is possible to design "flying tanks", but having your ship blinded
by laser fire is just as deadly sometimes as running around  in a ship with
notebook paper as armor.

   1975?!!! I can\'t believe this is a valid design, but if it is, the ship
must be
denser than a diamond.

>What do people think?  Do you put higher armor levels on, just in case
>you run into someone who\'s _higher_ tech level than you?

   No, but I do mount more guns...think of it of the Soviet Approach...
throw a fall of fire up at them and let _whoever_ sort it out.  If I can\'t
kill him, I\'ll blind him, and then his better sensors will be useless.

   When you saw that he was a Magic player, that should have told you
immediately that he had no soul.  Magic players routinely sell them to
Satan in exchange for rare booster cards for their decks.  Such individuals
should be executed, but unfortunately they seem to find their way into
public service jobs (at near minimum wage), which makes them even more
bitter and insufferable.
   His opinion probably comes from friends who attempted to play the
1st printing of MegaTraveller (which *was* an errata filled nightmare).
Subsequent printing improved in quality, and TNE has turned out to be
excellent.  He of course missed these facts, as he was probably too busy
haggling with Satan over a particularly cool rare dragon card he wanted.
We could go on a bit about his unprofessional attitude, but I doubt he ever
had a professional thought in his pea-sized mind, so I will let it rest for
now.

   It might be a good idea to give the manager of the store a call to see
what
he/she thinks about their employees being rude to customers, lying to them
about the status of products, and playing games on company time when they
should be assisting you, the customer.  Many distributors put out catalogs
of the products they handle, and these catalogs get distributed to game
stores.  It would have taken the souless pea brain about 30 seconds to look
up GDW products in one of those catalogs and confirm if they were still in
business (I know this is possible because one of the staff of the game store
I frequent looked up another GDW product for me to see if it was still being
published a few weeks ago).  I hope you manage to get the souless pea brain
severely reprimanded.

>I have always enjoyed GDW\'s product, so this attitude really surprised me. 
>Is this a common attitude out there, or did I just happen upon a nest of
>fools?

   Traveller has a no-so-good reputation amongst certain gaming circles
because of the errata problems, disagreements over how the Rebellion
Era was handled (many of these people believe that there shouldn\'t have
been a Rebellion Era to start with), and lack of support from GDW.
All that is of course old news, but like the reputation of the American
automotive industry, it takes a while for people to change their minds about
a product (GM, Chrysler and Ford have had record years this year for the
first time in *ages*).  TNE is a good product, and it is just a matter of
time before even the snot-nosed kids that run the gamestores think of it
in a better light.  I have personally witnessed some conversions myself.  :-)

Derek Smith says:

>You happened upon one nest in a larger Wide-Area-Nestwork.
>We are Virus in the Global nest of fools.  Fools are ubiquitous.

   I would like to state for the record that I am neither Virus or a fool.
I am, however, criminally insane.  There can be no other explaination
for why I read all this stuff and enjoy it.    :-)

  Prinesss Ashki (born 1190) .......... at home being tutored.
 
[NOTE TO REFEREE: the Queen will NOT openly discuss her psionic powers, or
the
psionic powers of the ruling Digamu aristocracy.  

The Digamu has had connections with the Zhodani Consulate for a long tome,
streching back to 502.  This psionic order arrived at Persephone at 603 as
Naminalus pilgrims, and stayed.  By 720 they were the ruling elite,
but when the Psionic Suppression hit in 800, they offically gave up their
psionics.

Well, they kept it, but "under wraps", and mainly in connection with
their religion.  Much of the nobility eventually \'semi-legimitized\' their
psionics by secretly promoting, and later patronizing, the secret Imperial
Psionic Institute on Mora (Mora: Spinward Marches 3124 A99AB7-F).  They
never fully revealed their family connections to the Consulate, though. 
They \'kept in touch\' with Zhodani family members back in the Far Frontiers
sector (the zhodane "Afachiabr Sector"), though always discreetly and
never seriously treasonous...except in \'flexing\' a few laws here and
there.  

Even after the Psionic Suppressions were repealed in the 1140\'s, they did
not "come out of the closet".  They remain quite secretive about their
psionic powers; although the Regency Govt. knows about it, they rather
aviod the general public knowing.  And their family connections to the 
Zhodani Consulate is a deep deep secret. ]

----

Queen Ashki is a good example of how a minor noble can dominate a
subsector, if the political enviroment permits it.

At 1179, Ashki inherited a bankrupt government from her father, King
Shi (1194 - 1179).  For centuries Gekashiishaa, a ancient form of Vilani
communism (it originated at Diaspora, at -7200 Imperial), worked well on
Persephone.

The unexpected loss of Glisten in [1125? help, anyone?] slashed revenue to
Persephone, and the enormous bureaucracy failed to react quickly or
creatively enough to avoid the long-term consequences.

At 1179, Ashki became Queen of Persephone. Two months later, Persephone\'s
four main creditors arrived at her palace for discussions on debt
servicing.  But, Persephone could give no more without threatening the
very stability of her society, and the Crown itself.  So she recieved an
ultimatim...
  
"Turn over the administration of your government to us"
[Give us your crown]

or

"Slash social spending."
[And face the planetary equivelant of the Rebellion and Collapse]

or

"Declare bankrupcy"
[And have your crown stripped from you by the Archduke, for dereliction of
Duty.]

Queen Ashki choose to end social spending, but in a way that kept her
crown on her head.

Basically, she maneouvered the political situation so that not only did
her political and ideological enemies, the leaders of the Old Order, recieved
the blame for the financial crunch, they also had to publicly sign the
documents that ended the old system of Gekashiishaa.  Moreover, in a
stunning move, the Queen held them _personally_ liable for the debt, and
confisitated all their property and wealth to pay for it.  All this at the
tender age of 21.

After destroying the Old Order - by implication, but never by openly
challenging it - Queen Ashki began to establish her New Order - again by
her actions, rather than proclimation.

She surrounded herself with wealthy, aggressive young men who\'s destiny
she controlled with steel smiles and velvet words.  The priests who she
favoured did not wish to perfect their inner faith, like the old
establishment
wanted.  The "New Balance" required the conversion of offworlders, rather
than "keeping your own life clean next to the spiritually dying, crying out
for help and Balance in their lives".

Those who suffered the most in the nameless New Order were mocked and
attacked ruthlessly if they dared complain.  Very few even understoon what
was going on, as the situation was so novel in their 770 year history that
their wasn\'t even a name for it, or a word to describe it.  Those that did
understood could do nothing: their leadership was discraced, their
ideology in ruins.

By 1190 the economy was finally recovering.  With the death of
Gekashiishaa a new, vigourous society was being born.  In this society
freedom reined, with one limit: never challange the elite, the Digamu.
The drive of this society was for raw, unlimited wealth and power,
cloaked/limited by an extreme piety to the High God and His Balance. 
Anyone could rise as high as they can, but if you fall, not a hand will be
given in aid.  A lot better than the old 100% income taxes.  A lot crueler
than the excellent old health care system, free to all.

At 1193, Queen Ashki again sent a political earthquake throughout
Persephone, when she sent out most of Persephone\'s 70 million-man army to
fight on Florine (District 268: Spinward Marches/1533, D312975-A), a
balklanized world on the edge of the Aslan New Lord territories. 
Currently, Florine is involved in a bitter civil war with pro-Aslan,
pro-Regency, and pro-Independent fractions (among others).  The decision
to send Persephone troops under the Imperial Banner to war electrified the
planet at the time, providing a potent kick of patriotism.  The troops are
still there, but now mainly as garrison troops.

[This is the first time that Persephone\'s army has fough (in anything
tougher than police actions) in 360 years.  AND the first time that the
Army has left the subsector.]

>From 1195, the Queen, now sure of herself in the interstellar sphere,
began to promote Persephone interests throughout the subsector.  Diplomats
and missionaries have been sent as far as the Consulate and the coreward
Vargr states.  Several major deals with large subsector corporations are
turning Persephone into a hub of industry and activity.  Her Royal Majesty
is promoting large families, to increase population and become a major
contender for the title of subsector capital.

The Queen feels that the greatest limitation to future Persephone
greatness is tech level limitations and the fact that Glisten
(Glisten: Spinward Marches/2036 A000986-F) remains in
Aslan hands, limiting commerce through Persephone.  To remedy this, she is
openly courting TL B and C companies to shift their operations to
Persephone, via tax breaks, stressing the lack of trade laws and
regulations of any kind, and the low, low wages that Persephonians are
willing to accept.  Slowly but surely, interest is picking up.  She is
certain that a "Critical point" is nearing that will change Persephone
forever as a flood of \'high-tech\' companies move in.

As for Glisten, she is pulling strings in both Naval circles and at the
Archduke\'s palace to create a naval base at Persephone.  She is also
stressing the critical political and geopolicial importance of
reconquering Glisten.  As for Virus, we all know that Virus has died out
back in the wilds, now don\'t we?  This ain\'t 1130, after all.

This year (1200), she has just bough 4 TL B, 350 disp. traders to handle
increasing traffic.  The new starport will be ready within the year.  And
the Naminolus religion is spreading throughout Strouden. The only fly in the
bottle remains the new subsector governor, Subsector Governor Anthony E.
Prentice-Hall, who attempts to stymize her every move.  He endlessly
proclames, in his nasal whine, that Persephone is upsetting the entire
subsector economy, with the possibility of a major economic shift in power
and economic consequences which no one can forsee or control.

In subsector affairs, she has increasingly sided with Strouden
(Lunion: Spinward Marches/2327 A745988-D) against Adabicci (Lunion:
Spinward Marches/1824 A571896B-B) and the subsector capital of Lunion
(Lunion: Spinward Marches 2124 A995984-D).  This increasing acrimony is
dividing the subsector into two competing blocks, and massive girdlock in
the subsector government houses.  The subsector Duke is attempting to calm
the subsector with ineffectual meetings and soothing words, but "It ain\'t
working". 

Among her other drives, she is attempting to persuade the sector nobility
to help her convince the Archduke to declare himself Emperor.  She feels
that this would give a strong boost to the fortunes of the Nobility, and
promote the drive to reunify the Empire.  Both "Good Things" from her
perspective.

She is angling for a promotion, eventually as Duchess of
_Persephone_ Subsector, but right now as Countess of Ushama. As 
Countess, she would have authority over nearby Penkwar (Lunian: Spinward
Marches/2128 X978000-0) and Harvosette (Lunian: Spinward Marches/2129
C330737-9).  Harvosette are of the same culture as Persephone - Ushama -
and have the same system of rule; Harvosette was a colony of Persephone
from the 870\'s to the 960\'s.  Of course, only the Emperor can grand new
noble patents... but maybe Regents can do so, too.  Queen Ashki is trying
out both avenues.

Finally, as Champion of the Widows, she is involved in several major
charities throughout the subsector.  She also promotes several events,
both throughout the subsector and on Persephone, to bring the plight of
widows (and widowers) to public attention.

	If you are refering to the LIBRARY or SYSGEN program,
I am the author (as indicated in the on-line help and readme

the later builds being grossly unstable :-)
	If you haven\'t been reading XBOAT (like any civilised

called for and created the "Traveller Tools Group". We are
seeking to produce tools useful to traveller users as gaming
aids and to those seeking to write game aids. The output is
along three levels:
	(1) Libraries of Classes for common required objects.
Just the functionary stuff. No UI at all.
	(2) Libraries of Controls (possibly VBXs). Basically the
number one deliverables wrapped or integrated with a UI.
	(3) Applications for basic stuff (Windows/Chicago).
Basically the number two deliverables taken to their logical
extreme.
	The charter is for MegaTraveller compliancy in (preferably)
Visual C++ with Windows as the target platform. I am willing
to tolerate TNE compliancy as an extension to the base
functionality or for conformance where no MT standard
exists (e.g. weapon\'s design).
	Anyone is welcome to join in. Either as a coder/architect
if they have basic C++ skills, or as a designer/reviewer if they
are just skilled in Traveller. Just write to me at:

This is part test (to see if this posts) and mostly questions. A little 
background. I bought the deluxe box set (TNE rulebook and FF&S) after it 
had been catching my eye ever since it came out (92ish?), mailnly to get 
a hard SF game to base some fiction on. I must admit, I was not 
disappointed. I have only played TW:2000 2nd ed. a few times, so I knew 
what to expect, but had forgotten most of the rules. So I slugged through 
the rulebook, skimmed FF&S, intending to use it once I started on the SF 
stories. THen I found you guys, and so I bought Brilliant Lances (\'cause 
I found a hobby store with lots of TNE stuff). Now I am pretty hooked 
(but left my TNE stuff at home, alas), and have a few non-rules questions.

1. Are the 2300AD, Traveller, Megatraveller, and TNE games in the same 
universe (as in same background, but different time periods)? You all 
seem to be using supplemnets from one game with another, and since I 
have seen only a microscopic amount of the other games, I am curious.

2. Does Battle Rider have new ships and stuff, or is it just a 
streamlined way to play Brilliant Lances (which for large scale battles, 
could use some streamlining). I want real BIG ships, none of those puny 
3000 ton Midu Agashaam destroyers, I\'m talking Leviatian-style ships.

3. What supplements are out? I\'ve seen an equipment guide, a survival 
guide book, a Star Viking book, and something called Smash and Grab (is 
that the SV book?), some modules perhaps. I\'m interested in aliens, more 
equipment, maybe a good universe guide.

4. Is Challenge magazine a TNE exclusive mag, or does it cover all of 
GDWs products? And is it any good, and how much does a subscription cost?

5. Heard some disappointing things about the computer prog they advertized, 
like it was just lists of stuff, not a ship builder prog or an actual 
working program (run combat on it or plot travel times).

6. Any word on a new TW:2000 computer game, I loved the first one (until 
the missions got REAL repetitive), or maybe a TNE one?

Once I scam a ride home, I\'ll get the rest of the books, crunch numbers 
to make some FF&S stuff, and be a regular (I hope) contributor to this 
group. One more thing, are the Daily Logs kept FTPed somewhere? I started 
at about 58 and would like to get the earlier ones. Later

P.S. I\'ve been trying to get this to post for a week, if you see this 
Alvin, then I figured it out for myself. Thanks all the same.

P.S. Just two queries:
    
(1) Wouldnt Io be a suitable breeding ground for the semiconductor chips 
that were the precursor to virus? I think it would be viable since Io and 
Cymbeline have similar environments (Hot, lots of tectonic activity). The 
only difference is that Io would have a weaker magnetosphere, and 
radiation from Jupiters Van Allen belts would corrupt chips that would 
try to breed on Io.

(2)Is Lucan back? If so is he some kind of mutated cyborg freak ala Darth 
Vader????

(but left my TE stuff at home, alas), and have a few non-rules questions.

Traveller (in its various forms) has been around since 1977.
The original TRAVELLER (now usually referred to as Classic Traveller or CT)
established the "charted space" universe that MegaTraveller and TNE
take place in.  It featured the old, huge, and civilized Imperium, but
most material focussed on its fronteir and border areas, where it
was easier to find "interesting" situations for your poor, hapless PC\'s :-)
     Most of the published material for CT from GDW took place in the
Spinward Marches (the core of the Regency in TNE), with some scenarios
in the Solomani Rim (the sector rimward of Diaspora [below it on the map]).
A number of licensees published material in orther parts of the universe.
(For instance, some material in Old Expanses was published by FASA,
when their stock-in-trade was Traveller supplements and deckplans).
Most of these took place in the years 1105 to 1112 (Imperial calender).

MEGATRAVELLER was an attempt to modernize CT\'s game mechanics
(I won\'t go into that here), and to showcase the new edition, they threw
the background universe into civil war.  The Rebellion took place from
1116 to 1130, with the period between 1125-1130 called the "Hard Times",
due to the damage the war caused.

Since you have TNE, you know that perspective on things.

2300 AD (originally called Traveller: 2300, causing great confusion)
is NOT in the Imperial background.  Instead, 2300 takes the
Twilight:2000 background 300 years down the road.

Battle Rider DOES have more ships.  I think the largest is about
300,000 tons.

Aside from TNE itself, Battle Rider, and Brilliant Lances:
FF&S-  design rules
RCES Equipement Guide -- what it says
Smash & Grab -- "smash and grab" mission scenarios (several)
World Tamers Handbook -- planet detailing, running a colony, two
     scenarios, and archaic weapons design
Star Vikings -- detailed NPC\'s from the RC and environs.
anything I\'m forgetting?

For aliens, there is a module upcoming for the Hivers and Ithklur,
but try digging around for the CT and MT aliens modules, as well
as any old issues of the Journal of the Travellers\' Aid Society which
have \'Contact:\' articles in them.

Challenge covers SF gaming in general, which means it covers games besides

I\'ve played the first edition of the game (in fact, mine was published
by "Conflict Game Co.", the company which had the same employees and
office building, but different street address, as GDW). It\'s pretty
much strictly two-player; I\'m not sure about solitaire play.
Complexity is middling, from what I remember. Presentation is very
good - the map and counters look really nice (beautiful blue or green TC
counters vs. red or black ZS counters on a very colorful map). 

The problem is in balance - namely, the Vilani apparently can always
win over the long term. The game simulates the Nth Interstellar Wars;
one player is the SecGen of the TC, while the other is the provincial
governor at Gashidda (whine, bow, scrape, serve, yes, mighty
Ishimkarun). One thing you keep track of is how many "glory points",
from 1 to 9, the Vilani player has, representing their favor with the
central government. Glory points are gained and lost, among other
things, by winning/losing battles and conquering/losing planets.  The
Vilani start with 5 glory points, and there are upper and lower limits
which, if the glory total passes them, causes a Vilani victory or
loss. The limits narrow as time goes on, limiting the length of any
"war". After each "war", there is a "peace" period, where both players
do some rebuilding, and a new "war" starts. The campaign ends, I
think, when all major worlds on the map (basically Sol and Dingir
subsectors) are controlled by one player. (Note that you can just play
one war as a "one-shot".)

The problem - the Vilani player may "appeal to the Emperor" for cash,
ships, or permission to build heavy units (it\'s a die roll, and can
sometimes result in bad stuff). This costs one "glory point". If the
Vilani do this every turn, they inevitably "lose", but get stuff _and_
shorten the game, preventing the Terrans from making many gains.
Thus, over many "phony wars", they can build up a lot of strength and
wipe the Terrans out.

Something may have been done about this in the second edition - I\'d
love to hear it, because the game has nice mechanics.

Imperium is a 2 player boardgame which uses the same system as the later 
Dark Nebula. There is no special problem in playing it solo ( no move 
plotting etc. ) but 2 players would provide a better game. It tends towards 
the playable end of the spectrum to the extent that a full campaign can get 
boring after a while.
If you are interested I could post some info on additional units and rules 
that I have.

  I would disagree about your first statement.  Lasers are the fall-back
weapon.  Every ship carries them, and almost no one carries sufficient
defense against them.  Due to the way the armor tables work, you only need
to be able to score two points on your outter range band to break your
target in BR.
  However, at closer ranges there is a good arguement for using PAWs and
MSGs as range-band:1 or 2 weapons.  Smaller hulls require getting down to
"point-blank" ranges to fight effectively unless they are all power-plant.
In either case, they don\'t have alot of room to pack screens and armor
into.  This is where PAWs and MSGs come in;  you can\'t let a 400 ton PCru
get into firing range for missles and his laser, or he *will* break you.
So, set your MSG\'s to "Slow Simmer" and fry him.  Leave the lasers for
picking off missles and dealing with the capital ships that *do* have too
much armor and screens to be effectively hassled by PAWs and MSGs.
  I think a better assesment would be to say that PAWs and MSGs are
generally ineffective against *larger* warships.  Of course, when you take
his screens down through laser fire....
 ----

Hmmmm... you seem to be ignoring FF&S which allows you to design very big 
lasers which will slice through just about any amount of armour. My 
definition of a warship is something with lots of weapons and armour that 
will be untroubled by converted merchants and the like. There is a general 
classification for the ships PCs are likely to have......... targets!

   I agree that bay mounted PAWS (and MGs) are usually useless, but the short

Yes I have already come up with a limit, see below.

   The Brilliant Lances rule book says damage value; the table says remaining
penetration value.  Take your pick. :)  (I\'d use damage.)
 ----

I agree totally.

 ----
   Note that the laser\'s focal array is 6.4 m thick and masses close to 1000
tonnes.  I\'m considering limiting the focal array\'s thickness to 20% of its
diameter (haven\'t decided on the effects of high ROFs).  The above laser
would thus be limited to 1900 Mj (a mere 1/35-109 at all ranges).  Any
thoughts?
 ----

Lasers: It seems silly to me that a laser can be constructed at ANY discharge
energy for a given area of focal array as a sufficiently high energy will
damage the reflective/refractive parts of the focal array no matter how much 
extra mass is added !

The following formula accounts for increasing efficiency at high TL while
limiting lasers to a penetration of nil on their own focal arrays:

MAX discharge energy < Non grav eff (%) x Area of focal array (cm^2) x 0.390625

e.g. a TL 9 laser with 10 m^2 focal array has an absolute max discharge energy
less than:

0.3 x 100000 x .390625 = 11718.75 MJ

Actual mass was used in 2300AD formulas.  While I mentioned the greatest
difference between FFS and 2300AD Stutterwarp was Parsecs vs. LY for
efficiency, the mass, cost, crew sizes and volume requirements are VERY
different.  For example, 2300AD powerplants were much more massive than
comparable FFS powerplants.  Unless GDW releases a 2300AD Sourcebook, and 
FFS supplement to support it, I suggest using all FFS mass, cost (one Cr. = 1.5Lv),
crew sizes and volume requirements be used for simplicity.  2300AD ships would
have to be backward engineered to retain appropriate charactoristics.
 ----

I suggest using actual mass for the following reasons:
 - the "10D" was originally devised in order to give reaction mass ships 
integer G ratings.
 - it did this by assuming that all ships mass 10 tonnes per 14 m^3.
 - as you point out 2300 AD uses actual mass.
 - the "10D" factor is cube rooted producing a non-integer ( in most cases).
 - so many other things in the design sequence have changed that it cannot be

used with 2300 AD designs anyway.

 ----
> - Charge build up range limitation= TL^(1/3) parsecs (= 7.665 ly @ TL 13 )

Interesting idea for a non 2300AD Campaign but in 2300AD the range limitation
was a fixed value.  StutterWarp discharge was required after 7.7LY to prevent
explosive radiation release i.e., death to humans.  If I recall correctly one
more  LY could be squezed out by an Impossible engineering task. Anyway the
near Earth 3D stellar geography requires a 7.6(?) LY leg to explore portions
the French Arm that occured at TL 10.  Therefore, this proposed fix would only
work in non 2300AD campaigns.
 ----

My range limitation is intended to add a little variation into the lives of 
the PCs. :-)
Also note:
 - I intended this to be used with a parsec mapping system ( 2d or 3d )
 - rounded to the nearest parsec range = 2 at TL 9-15, 3 at TL 16+
 - range at TL 10 = 7.023 ly ( + a bit for eng rolls?)
 - 2300 AD Tech levels do NOT correspond to Traveller TL.
 - as so much else has changed from 2300 AD to TNE any TNE stuff introduced 
would automatically make it a non 2300 AD campaign!

The best answer any of us can come up with is to limit the total power for a
laser to some amount determined by tech level.  One technique that would
work very well is to assume that the biggest lasers listed in the available
rules and suppliments ARE the largest available at that tech level.

Therefore, for example, that 300Mj barbette is the largest power laser that
can be constructed at TL-14.  If the designer needs more penetration that
then the limits of technology force you to go to a PAW or Meson Gun, no
matter what the inefficiency of the device.

Considering that a 60,000-ton Imperial cruiser could easily have armor
levels over 1000, wespons with higher penetration would be desirable.

> The PAWS requires something in excess of 50,000 displacement tons.

You forgot that the PAWS requires a truly large number of crew to keep it
happy, while the Laser can be operated by a crew of one or two.

The space combat rules in the T:TNE rulebook (at least, the first printing,
which is what I have) are broken and are, for all intents and purposes,
unplayable (anyone who disagrees with me can attempt to play one 800-ton
Mercenary Cruiser against two 400-ton SDBs using the rules and ships as
printed).

Substantially better rules are part of Brilliant Lances; use that instead.

  3G3 does this:)

  There is a maximum energy density for lasers in atmosphere, giving a
minimum diameter dependent on discharge energy, and a minimum (but larger)
diameter for \'design purposes\', also dependent on discharge energy that
holds in space too. This will limit the damage since damage is energy
per diameter, making insanely large lasers possible but not very efficient
unless you absolutely positively have to have them.

  The equivalent minimums for "Plasma/Fusion" are smaller, making them
more efficient at high energies.

I have a better answer.  Build big lasers, and don\'t build PAWS.

I can build a laser that not only has a better PR, but also a better
PV than a PAWS, for less money, mass, volume, power, and crew
requirements.  I just wanted to know if there was a fix for
this, if the problem had been noticed, and what people were doing about
it.  

An arbitrary limit to the Discharge Energy of a laser is not only NOT
the best solution, it is NO solution at all.  It does have being
ridiculous in its favor, however... :)

It\'s only a two-person game anyway.  Never tried it solo.  Steve always
trounces me with the Terrans, though I\'ve gotten better at the "Imperials
appeal to the Emperor and declare peace..." number to slow him down.  I never
understood all the people who said that it was unbalanced in favor of the
Imperials; I never found that to be the case.  It is very playable, not very
complex at all -- one war (it\'s a campaign game) makes a good "beer &

What is "Dark Nebula"? An Imperium-like game involving the Solomani

I would like to see your additional Imperium material.

How does _Imperium_ compare in mechanics to _5th Frontier War_, which

	Actually, the magnetosphere would just produce mag-field 
hardened virus precursors.  Sort of mil-spec EMP hardened stuff.  Nasty 
things, resistant to nukes and a lot of other armament.  These puppies 
could make Fred Saberhagen\'s berserkers look nice and gentle, and 
wold be a natural source for the kind of military hardware that led to 
the Virus in the first place.    

	Also, something that\'s not been clear to me all along: if the Virus 
is rewireing/recutting/reconfiguring all this hardware, wher does it get 
it\'s raw material.  Does it cannibalize other parts of the circuitry for 
elements, particularly in the early stages of infection?  I\'m looking at 
Virus in somewhat of the same aspect as a biological virus, in that a 
biological virus also "re-writes" the cells to make viruses.  But most 
electronic gear is not self replicating.  So what is the life-cycle of a
Virus 
infestation?

	I don\'t hold Virus in the same cold disdain and hatred that 
everyone else seems to, mostly because I can see a lot of good play 
situations arising from this thing being unleashed on the unsuspecting 
Imperium.  I also don\'t make it the implacable unbeatable foe GDW 
seems to have made it, so that colors my thinking a bit.

My personal pet theory goes something like this:

Sometime during between 1110 and 1115, an intact and functioning
Ancients computer was discovered and transferred to a research
facility somewhere in the area now called ``The Black Curtain.\'\'  Like
nearly all Ancients devices, parts of it\'s design and programming
completely baffled scientists.

Shortly (no later than 1130 I\'m supposing) after Dulinor\'s forces
``liberated\'\' Virus at Research Station Omicron, an infected supply
ship set Virus loose on the research facility studying the Ancient
computer.

But this computer was no ordinary Ancient computer (if there is such a
thing).

This particular unit was used directly by Grandfather during his
various research projects.  It contains (or contained, since some loss
is inevitable) thoughts and data from the immortal Droyne.  It also
contained an impressive bit of technology that completely baffled
Imperial scientists:  It could communicate psionically.

Now, Virus being no dummy took full advantage of this once it got
control of the computer.  It used it\'s raw computational advantage to
control surrounding Virus-infected systems and used it\'s newfound
psionic abilities to influence or control biologicals (Humans).  It
also used it\'s newfound technological knowledge to ask/coerce/force
others to modify and improve itself.  It even started research into a
type of silicon lifeform that act in symbosis with carbon life (called
a Symborg).

Being somewhat saavy (and more than a bit egotistical), the computer
adopted the name \'Savior\' as a phychological edge when dealing with
biologicals.

			----

I haven\'t evolved the idea much beyond that, but it\'s not hard to 
draw a connection between the (apparently organized) vampire fleets
and the infected Ancient computer.  You can also draw up any number of
twisted scenarios using this concept.

Anyway, like I said, it\'s my pet theory -- we\'ll see how close I was
as GDW produces product.

As well I know.  You could do a lot worse than use 3G3 rules instead of FF&S
for Traveller weapons design.  3G3 is published by BTRC, and any
half-competent game shop should have (or be able to order) a copy.

For anyone who\'se wondering, 3G3 is Greg Porter\'s excellent _Guns, Guns,
Guns_, 3rd Edition (3G3 for short).  3G3 has been around for several years
longer than GDW\'s FF&S system, and has had most of the problems already
shaken out of it.   Particularly when compared to it\'s competition (FF&S),
3G3 is well written, easy to use, and error-free.

3G3 contains conversion information to Twilight:2000 (which is what you
should use to convert to Traveller: The New Era), as well as MegaTraveller
for all the Classic/Mega die-hards.

There is now a 3G3 suppliment; although some additional rules, rulings, and
design tips are supplied, the major focus of More Guns is to provide a set
of weapons pre-designed and ready to drop into any of the game systems that
3G3.  The weapons are grouped by tech level, and pre-converted to most of
the popular RPG systems (including MegaTraveller and Twilight:2000).

There is certainly no problem with that; this approach is supported by the
rules.  I was under the (aparrently mistaken) impression that you mentioned
your observation for some reason, such as to ask why none of the
pre-designed ships took this approach, and why none of the Traveller
\'history\' supports this approach.

Well, then, excuse me for suggesting just such a fix!

Yes, the problem has been noticed.  Yes, people talked about it.  Yes, there
is a fix; I\'ve already told you what it is (I\'ll explain the rationale
below).

If you don\'t like this fix, feel free to suggest your own.  I should note
that simply building large lasers *ISN\'T* a fix, either - it\'s ignoring the
problem.  If the \'problem\' doesn\'t bother you, this is a fine fix.

The \'problem\' bothers me, so I limit the energy of lasers in my campaign.

Oh?  Really?

The FF&S game rules, particularly the ones relating to lasers are just as
arbitrary; the fix is no more ridiculous than the \'gravitic focussing\' that
allows lasers to operate at the ranges Traveller postulates.  Since you\'ve
admitted that a \'fix\' might just be needed, let\'s see if we can agree on
just what needs to be fixed, and from there, the fix itself.

>From my point of view, the problem is that there is no reason to ever
construct a particle accellerator or a meson gun.  For any such weapon, a
laser at the same TL will be smaller, consume less energy, cost less, and
require a smaller crew. 

This doesn\'t fit with the observed characteristics of the Traveller
universe, and it desn\'t mesh with the way I want to run my campaign.  In
every official Traveller ship design, and in the pre-designed weapons
supplied with the game, particle accellerator and meson weapons are the
primary weapons of a large warship, and (on such large ships) the lasers
operate in a secondary role.

I assume that the \'fix\' desired is one that brings the design sequences back
into line with the desired characteristics of the universe: specifically, at
some size or power level, it becomes more efficient (by some measure of
\'efficient\') to build particle accellerators or meson guns than to build
lasers.

With me so far?

I can think of several general approaches to this problem.

1) Modify the design sequences to
   a) make lasers less efficient 
   b) make PA-Guns and Meson-Guns more efficient
2) Modify the design sqeuence so that lasers above a certain size are 
   less efficient than PA-Guns and Meson-Guns of similar sizes
3) Modify the design sequence so that lasers above a certain size are
   prohibited

Let\'s take a look at these options.

Option 1 has the extreme drawback that they invalidate existing designs for
the weapons themselves.  This \'fix\' would require re-writing the relevant
sections of the design sequences, and re-designing all of the weapons using
those sequences.  This would, of course, invalidate all of the ship designs
using the weapons, and then *THESE* would have to be re-designed.  This
sounds like a *LOT* of work; there\'s got to be an easier way than
re-designing every weapon and every starship.

The same effect can be had by using just option 1a or 1b; this is a little
better, now we only have to re-design EITHER all of the lasers, OR all of
the particle accellerators.  And all of the ships that use them.  This still
sounds like too much work.

Option 2 looks promising; if we pick the \'certain size\' appropriately, no
existing weapons need to be re-designed.  Only (as yet undesigned) lasers
above the \'certain size\' would need to be re-done.  But wait!  Lasers above
that size are less efficient than a comparable PA-Gun or Meson gun (this by
the very definition of what we are attemption to do with the \'fix\'), so
nobody will actually WANT to use such lasers.  This realization brings us to:

Option 3!  If lasers above a \'certain size\' are less efficient than PA-Guns
or Meson Guns, we don\'t actually have to write rules for designing such
things; we simply note that \'lasers above this size are less efficient than
comparable particle accellerators, and are not produced\'.

This is also a considerably easier \'house rule\' to explain and disseminate:
"Lasers above (TLx25)Mj are less efficient that comparable particle
accellerators and are not produced by any manufacturer, due to the size and
complexity of the laser array and gravitic focussing elements required to
handle this energy density."


And there you have it, a reaon to build particle accellerators and meson
guns.  They may not be as efficient at turning energy into damage points,
but when you need a weapon to open up the 1000 or more points of hull armor
on an Imperial ship-of-the-line, it\'s your only choice.

  Actually, I was thinking *specificially* of FF&S.  Its the way the damage
system works.  *Everything*, as you know is a critical hit.  Armor vs
lasers gets divided by 10.  To stop a Dam:3 laser from blowing me to bits
I\'d 40 points of armor (after all, a Temporary Damage of "Ship
Destroyed"...).  So, you are right in that the main armorments of warships
are Dam:3 - 5 lasers, backed by a phalanx of Dam:1 - 2\'s.
  However, given the nature of warfare, particularly FF&S, any hit scored
is a *good* hit.  Why ignore the short-range brutallity you can dish out
with secondary arrays of PAWS and MG\'s?  When you are fighting a fleet
action, do you *really* want to be wasting the capabilities of your
armor-busting lasers against light targets that have little to none?  I
shouldn\'t think so.  A quick zap with a PAWs or MG bay will deal with the
problem, leaving your lasers available for the anti-missle role or
offensive armor-breaking.

In the old DGP material, there was mention of a major 
robotics research facility on Shudusham (spelling?), a 
world in or near the old Sylean Federation.  This world 
was the location of a major convention that determined 
laws governing robotics and artificial intelligence.  My 
pet theory is that the Virus managed to seize control of 
a largely-automated factory producing experimental 
AI Robots (possibly one of Lucan\'s secret Wonder 
Weapons).  The AI Robots became extremely effective 
tools of the Virus, due to their high degree of autonomy 
and the adaptability of AI to new situations.  

The VampireBots quickly seized control of the planet, 
securing naval assets and more production/research 
facilities, as well as a large number of technically-adept
human slaves.  The VampireBots then spread out from 
Shudusham in a jihad-like movement.  The Virus would 
have already disrupted naval defenses in the Core Sector, 
making this movement easier.  I would imagine the spread 
of the VampireBots was stopped only by their own lack 
of numbers.  

Of course, this does not tell us what the VampireBots would 
be doing now.  Are they building a vast fleet to conquer all 
of known space?  Are they content to hold the Black Sphere 
against all comers?  Are they attempting to use their captured 
slaves and technology to further refine the Virus for a new 
assault on the uninfected zones?

  A possible fix to the PAWS versus lasers fix is to give PAWS an IPR just like
lasers have.  This makes a lot of sense physically.  I\'m assuming that the
particle beam is moving very close to speed of light.  At the distance scales
involved, this is necessary.  Its even quite practical to have a very high 
energy beam.  The acceleration mechanism will probably use a laser to provide
the acceleration (light is just electromagnetic radiation).  A prototype of 
such a system is in the planning stage, I\'m assuming it will be available at 
TL9.  This type of accelerator will be able to accelerate protons to about 
10 GeV per meter of accelerator.  The rest mass is about 1 GeV, so this is 
damn fast.  Any MASSIVE particle going this fast behaves very much like a 
MASSLESS particle.  The mass energy becomes very small compared to the kinetic
energy.  Thus, the particles shot out would behave very much like photons. 
The ship being hit probably couldn\'t tell the difference.  

  So there is a very good reason to have particle accelerators and lasers do 
the same type of damage.  This makes particle accelerators superior to lasers
when they get large, because they will have a better range.  (The diffraction
formula for lasers could even be used for particle accelerators, but the 
wavelength of the particle beam would be far shorter than that of lasers, 
giving a much better range, probably about 1000 times better than the gamma 
ray lasers available at TL22ish.)

  I don\'t know how well this works as a fix... another thought is to remove the
IPR from lasers.  Big lasers are too powerful anyway.

I\'ve been too busy to send more than an occasional
quick snippet lately, but I think it\'s about time 
I weighed in on this PAW debate.

Wildstar said a good part of what needed to be said
about our previous discussions on the topic, so
I\'ll just expand on what he said.

_IF_ you are running a game in your own custom universe
_OR_ don\'t give a damn about connecting TNE to Classic
and Mega- TRAVELLER, then feel free to make lasers as 
big as you want, it\'s your game.

However, both previous editions of Traveller had a 
general heirarchy of naval weapons:

TURRET WEAPONS: lasers, sandcasters, and turret missiles
BARBETTE WEAPONS: small particle accelerators (TL14+),
                  fusion guns, and plasma guns
BAY WEAPONS: missile bays, PAW bays, meson gun bays,
             fusion gun bays, plasma gun bays, and
             repulsor bays
MAIN (SPINAL) WEAPONS: PAWs and meson guns

FF&S assumed only linear accelerators were feasable
for weapons, so barbette and for the most part bay
PAWs and MGs became useless.  The plasma and fusion
guns fire a "projectile" that is too slow for space
combat, so THEY dropped out too.  Lasers filled in the
niches they left.

TRAVELLER-history-wise, it would be nice to keep
SOMETHING from the old structure.  After all, the
ships already published seem to assume PAWs and MGs
are the "big guns".

Also, from a game-playing standpoint, it\'s much more
interesting to have to balance several different
attack/defense options rather than just one (lasers,
including the laser-tipped missiles).

What I came up with was a limitation of 50 Mj * TL
(not 25*TL that Wildstar mentioned earlier).
This fits all lasers published in FF&S and BL.
Battle Rider also fits, since the largest laser
on those ships is identical to the barbette laser
on a Gazelle.
At TL-15 this makes the largest laser 750 Mj.  The
smallest PAWs and MGs published are 1000 Mj, so it
allows them to be the big guns while lasers handle
the smaller stuff.

Arbitrary?  YUP.
Based on anything physical? NOPE.
But it does fit the "interesting game" and "Imperial History" test.


Incidentally, PAWs don\'t neccessarily need huge crews.
Remember, unless you have plans for planetary bombardment,
it only needs to have a range out to the farthest 
range it can possibly hit something, which is about
50 hexes IF you work at TL-15 AND have the absolute
maximum ROF (not likely on big guns).

In other words, if it only needs to be 1.5 meters in
diameter, don\'t make it bigger -- the limit is on
the MAXIMUM bore, not minimum.

This way, a 200-300 meter long PAW only winds up needing
a crew of one or two. (lower TLs will either shorten
range or force a larger diameter, meaning more volume, 
thus more crew).


As a final note, I abandoned my plugging for "Bogan Bay"
(as Wildstar dubbed them) multi-PAWs.  For those who
don\'t know, they were 5 to 10 PAW tubes mounted
together (multiple rocket launcher style) coaxially,
to make more efficient use of bay space.

If lasers are limited, it would stand to reason that
you could co-mount lasers in a comparable fashion, 
which would be almost as bad as not limiting them
in the first place.

Given the options, it is more imperative to limit
the lasers, so the multi-PAWs get nixed.

Some aspects of ship combat (line the ships up, long and short range, that sort 
of thing) are very similar, but I am not sure if the inheritance is direct or
via HG.

Otherwise, FFW is firmly set in a traveller universe, while Imperium and Dark
Nedula both predate traveller (yes, Virginia, there was a time when GDW didn\'t 
produce traveller, or any other roleplaying products); references to traveller
are patches to the chrome after the fact.

Pity they never produces a dark nebula sized game based on the FFW mechanics.

I always wanted to know; who nuked Cymbeline? It was too far from 
Capital, IMHO, for Lucan to be involved. Solsec? Perhaps the insuing 
chaos of the Rebellion might have allowed the Solomani to find out about 
Dr Rushorin and his research.

Io would have been an ideal site to breed AI chips, if they could 
survive. Figure it out; there was a Research station (claiming to do 
research into the Jovian atmosphere) on one of Jupiters other moons (See 
Solomani and Aslan: by DGP for exact details), so results and samples 
could be coordinated there. Io was too hostile to be inhabited. So no one 
would go there. Except researchers who would travel to Io to view 
Jupiters atmosphere up close (apparently).

Jupiter would also have a strong naval prescence; it would probably be 
the beachhead for an invasion, where ships could refuel safely.

One other question. In "SignalGK" why didnt the characters head 
immediately to coreword to Depot/Solomani Rim. Surely the last thing INI 
would want would be for Rushorin to remain near the border in case SolSec 
try an extraction.

According to "SignalGK" the chips cut their circuitry on compounds and 
elements, such as silicon and Gallium Arsenide, in the volcanic highlands 
of Cymbeline. I think this is something GDW should have made clearer in 
the Virus section of TNE. NOW this is where my whole hypothesis about Io 
can fall flat on its face. Are there deposits of aforementioned compounds 
on Io???

Yep, according to the TNE Referees Screen, there were "Creatures" that 
sounded alot like the Borg to me. Whether or not they come from the Black 
Curtain remains to be seen.....

Please, please, pretty please GDW, my favourite game company, could you 
shed some light on the situation?? (Whine, beg, plead!!)
 
Now for my Theory on what happened behind the Black Curtain.
____________________________________________________________

First a little theory....

As we all know Virus mutates. And we also know that Virus can reconfigure 
itself to other systems. In fact ANY system. As mutations occur the 
strain of a Virus may change. Also the type of system a virus infects can 
also affect its characterisics. ie a virus that infects a warship is more 
likely to be violent and murderous than another virus which infects an 
orbital orbservatory. But in general Virus is MAD.

Now would a virus that reconfigures itself to a non-standard system be more 
likely to mutate to another strain during the reconfiguration...?

Now for a few facts.

The most important world in the Imperium: Capital
HQ for the INI: Capital
HQ for the IISS: Capital (probably)
Home of the Imperial mint: Capital (I think...)
System with one of the systems with the highest volume of shipping: Capital
System with one of the oldest computer networks: Capital
System with one of the tightest security measures for networks: Capital

The point im trying to put across is that Capital would not have a data 
processing net like the standard in the rest of the Imperium. It had to 
be SECURE, to prevent espionage and attack. It had to be ADVANCED (how do 
coordinate the movements of *4* Battlefleets and (n) hundred thousand 
tons of civilian shipping). The datanet in the Capital system would be 
TL15/Early TL16 for research and security.

Virus was released somewhere in Core sector (Duh... I cant 
remember...!!!), so the strain of Virus that reached Capital would 
probably have been suicidal TYPE 1 or some other kind of early strain. 
But when Virus infected Capitals datanet, Virus had to reconfigure 
itself. This reconfiguration sparked off a freak mutation, which changed 
Virus to a GOD strain. Instead of destroying Capital completely, it took 
over and started running things its own way.

I know it sounds a bit vague, but when I post next time I\'ll try to fill 
in some more details.

The problem is in balance - namely, the Vilani apparently can always
win over the long term. The game simulates the Nth Interstellar Wars;
one player is the SecGen of the TC, while the other is the provincial
governor at Gashidda (whine, bow, scrape, serve, yes, mighty
Ishimkarun). One thing you keep track of is how many "glory points",
from 1 to 9, the Vilani player has, representing their favor with the
central government. Glory points are gained and lost, among other
things, by winning/losing battles and conquering/losing planets.  The
Vilani start with 5 glory points, and there are upper and lower limits
which, if the glory total passes them, causes a Vilani victory or
loss. The limits narrow as time goes on, limiting the length of any
"war". After each "war", there is a "peace" period, where both players
do some rebuilding, and a new "war" starts. The campaign ends, I
think, when all major worlds on the map (basically Sol and Dingir
subsectors) are controlled by one player. (Note that you can just play
one war as a "one-shot".)

The problem - the Vilani player may "appeal to the Emperor" for cash,
ships, or permission to build heavy units (it\'s a die roll, and can
sometimes result in bad stuff). This costs one "glory point". If the
Vilani do this every turn, they inevitably "lose", but get stuff _and_
shorten the game, preventing the Terrans from making many gains.
Thus, over many "phony wars", they can build up a lot of strength and
wipe the Terrans out.

Something may have been done about this in the second edition - I\'d
love to hear it, because the game has nice mechanics.

=========================================================================

The big change in the 2nd edition is that appeals cost 2 prestige points
instead of 1. This reduces the number of times the Imp. gov. can appeal
each \'war\' but the problem still remains whereby the Imp. played can de-
liberately \'lose\' a war w/o losing any territory. The \'loser\' of each
war has the advantage in income received between wars. I think the Im-
erium still has the advantage. Does anyone have any \'home-grown\' rules
that address the problem that they\'d like to post?

trounces me with the Terrans, though I\'ve gotten better at the "Imperials
appeal to the Emperor and declare peace..." number to slow him down.  I never
understood all the people who said that it was unbalanced in favor of the
Imperials; I never found that to be the case.  It is very playable, not very
complex at all -- one war (it\'s a campaign game) makes a good "beer &
pretzels" session.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

I\'d sure like some details how Steve accomplishs this task!
I\'ve *never* played a game where the Terrans won & I\'ve never
met *anyone* that didn\'t think the Imperium had a MAJOR advantage.

One problem I see with this is the arbitrary nature of the "TL-XX" put
your weapon here.  The TL14 laser turret for example, is stupid, for an
extra 1.3kl of volume, it could have a short range (SR) of 8... a big
difference in getting a shot in. For a little more volume, it could up
the ROF, too.  Weapons would be designed to complete the task assigned
to them.  If they are to engage ships, you wouldn\'t pick a size first,
then make a laser, you\'d decide how much energy you need/want to
deliver, then make the turret the right size.

The TL14 Barbette should come with ROF for -3 DiffMods standard, BTW as
it has volume left over.

The missle laser level of 1975 is right on though... missles are nasty.
Would anyone expect bigger warheads on the missles to make better
lasers? I\'ve tried to find a way of scaling up missles, but is ain\'t
linear :-/  You\'d think that there would be a major arms race around
building missles that can critical a capital ship.

So, to focus my rambling, I standardize weapons based on function...
standardizing across tech levels is OK *within* a culture--"have the
weapons lab design a retrofit laser turret for our old TL13 colonial
cruisers to fit in the original sockets", but not accross societies (why
would the Zhos standardize on a size that is  a couple kls shy of an
effective weapon?).

BTW, we picked a resonably low Imperial TL (12) to make our standard...
make a *good* TL12 laser, then use the volume to make optimum weapons in
that size at better TLs.

The 700MJ laser on the (otherwise yucky :) Kininur is a *great* laser,
enough punch to critical a hit small ship (now *there* is a plateau to
design weapons around, critical hits!)

Anybody posted weapon/ship designs from FF&S?

become so impressed by the improvements of TNE lasers over the CT/MT version 
that we have lost some points on the potential advantages of the large PAWS:

1. Considering each weapon at its effective range, the PAWS gives twice the 
damage potential for a given DE (and, since they have the same efficiency,
Input
energy).  Lasers, on the other hand, give far greater armour penetrating
value. 
This means that, for any given armour level, while lasers penetrate at lower 
energies, the lines cross very quickly:  If you have a large enough PAW to 
penetrate the target armour, it only has to be a little bit bigger to also do

more damage then the similarly powered laser.


2. Sandcasters deplete lasers and PAWS damage at the same rate, but while a
PAW 
loses a  modest amount of penetration capability the laser\'s ability to 
penetrate is significantly depleted.

3. In BR the sandcaster effect is far more extream.  Sandcasters are payed
for 
in a linear manner, but additional damage points for weapons are payed for on
a 
non-linear scale.  I think that it may be more economical to build a number
of 
smaller lasers in order to defeat sandcasters.

4. I think that it is the cheap sandcaster that makes the Meson Gun a useful 
weapon: meson sceens are still a very expensive proposition, and you have to 
keep in mind the possibility of critical success on the fire task.


Several people have noted that the FF&S relationships may invalidate some 
designs from CT/MT times.  But this is not a new problem -- the 1st edition HG 
design of Azante High Lightning, for example, is meat on the table for a 2nd 
edition designed ship.

Instead of trying to patch FF&S, I would sooner see refs who want to retain High
Guard just plain retain High Guard.  I personally like the changes in the space 
combat area of the game: it is the increasing complexity of the role playing and
personal combat rules that I see as a step in the wrong direction.

I should note that, according to designers\' notes for High Guard that were
published in a long-ago issue of _The Journal of the Travellers\' Aid
Society_, "Classic Traveller" turret, barbette, and bay PA-Guns and Meson
Guns were assumed to be synchrotron (at the smallest sizes) or "racetrack"
circular or oval accellerators, thereby "folding" a long accellerator into a
smaller physical dimension.  Only the spinal mounts were linear
accellerators.

This also provided the rationale behind one of the High Guard game
mechanics: a linear accellerator has many individual accelleration stations,
each of which add some energy to the particle beam.  Enemy fire knocking out
one of the stations reduces the weapon\'s output, but does not knock it out.

In the circular accellerators, each accelleration stations both adds energy
to the beam and helps to pull it around in a circle.  Damage to any one
station can cause the weapon beam to hit the wall of the tube (which would
be very bad) unless the weapon is shut down.

John\'s correct here; I mis-remembered the decision.  John\'s (TLx50)Mj cuts
the largest possible lasers off at more than double the largest published
laser weapon (ignoring for a moment the Kinunir\'s 700Mj laser barbette - in
the "Classic" design of the ship, these were PA-Gun barbettes), and a few
hundred Mj below the smallest published PA-Guns.

My (TLx25)Mj suggestion cuts the largest possible lasers off only slightly
larger than the largest currently published designs, with the exception of
the TL-10, 450Mj 50-ton bay laser in BL (however, no published ship designs
that I am aware of use this weapon) and again the Kinunir\'s laser barbettes
for the reasons noted above.  This opens up the possibility of having to
make use of bay-mounted PA-Guns and Meson Guns to get higher power levels.

Either "house rule" will work for our purposes, choose the one that suits.
The (TLx50)Mj is probably the best general-purpose solution.

> Arbitrary?  YUP.  Based on anything physical? NOPE.
> But it does fit the "interesting game" and "Imperial History" test.

And, I should point out, the designers notes published a while back in
Challenge, admit that the existing laser rules are arbitrary, deliberately
ignore known physics with the "gravitic focussing" rule, and were chosen
with an eye towards creating an interesting game.

Exactly.  It\'s slightly abbreviated (a smaller game), and has no
"Imperial Appeals", but does have some rules for tech advancement
during the course of the game.  Essentially though, it uses the
Imperium rules, the units are comparable, etc.


>How does _Imperium_ compare in mechanics to _5th Frontier War_, which
>I\'ve never played but have heard good things about?

Apples and Oranges.  The mechanics are completely different.  (If you
have ever played _Invasion:  Earth_, FFW\'s mechanics for combat and
units is similar.)

Whereas in Imperium, you have TL 11 ships fighting it out against
other TL 11 ships, in FFW you have varied levels of technology, which
eliminates the possibility of using a simple "warpline" movement
system like Imperium uses.  Some of the squadrons are Jump-1, some
are Jump-2, etc all the way up to some Jump-5 (Zhodani) and Jump-6
(Imperial) squadrons.  (In Imperium everything was Jump-2 if it could
jump at all, hence the "warplines" indicating all possible destinations
from a given starting point)

Everything is on somewhat of a larger scale as well-  A larger volume
of space is represented, more squadrons are involved, etc.  So
different mechanics are mandated.  Ground combat is done by 
percentages, and is affected by tech level as well (so a ground
unit might have factors of 5c-15, meaning 500 combat factors, TL 15.
This might further be modified by whether or not it is "elite",
and whether or not it is "armor".  Then, in combat, it might receive
a 20 result, meaning that it is 20% destroyed).  In _Imperium_, the
combat just determines whether or not a unit is "hit".  If it\'s hit,
it\'s history.  (Implication that all units of same type are roughly
the same size).

Logistics, however, is probably the biggest difference between the
two systems.

In _Imperium_, you move your units when it\'s your turn, and you move
them where you like, subject to two restrictions:  The destinations
made available by the warplines, and the presence of enemy combat ships
(which force you to stop moving).  Within those restrictions, you could
move your ships from anywhere on the map to anywhere else on the map
in a single turn (each turn obviously represented months).  Carrying
capacity was simple - one ground unit per Dreadnought, Battleship, or
transport.  (Transports could carry one "item", be it an "outpost" a
Planetary Defense System, a fighter, or a ground unit)  That\'s it.

In FFW, Fleets (made up of BatRons and CruRons in the same hex) can
only move if assigned an _Admiral_.  Admirals have two ratings
(I forget what they\'re called, let\'s call them Strategic and Tactical).
The Admiral\'s STRATEGIC rating is the number of turns IN ADVANCE that
the movement of his/her fleet must be PLOTTED.  Some Admirals had
Strategic Ratings of ZERO.  No plotting required.  These were highly
prized.  Turns represent about two weeks.  (One jump plus refuelling)

(The Tactical rating decided who got a tactical bonus in combat (the
Admiral with the higher rating got a DM of +1, regardless of the actual
difference between their ratings).

Ground units could be carried according to the carrying capacity of
the given squadron(s).  The carrying capacity was expressed in ground
combat strength points.  Thus an Assault squadron might have a capacity
of 6c (600) ground combat strength points.

Fleet combat goes with both sides adding up their space combat factors,
rolling the die, and consulting the fleet combat table.  DMs are
as follows:
  Imperial Regular vs Zhodani Regular -  Imperials get +1  Zho get +0
  Imperial Regular vs Zho Colonial, Sword Worlder, or Vargr - Imperials
  get +2 (I think), other guys get +0.  Imperial Colonial vs. Zho
  Regular - Zhodani get +1, Imp Colonial get +0,  Imperial Colonial
  vs. Zho Colonial, SW, or Vargr - Imp. Colonial get +1, other guy gets
  +0.  Commanding Admiral with Superior Tactical rating gets +1.

Combat proceeds in rounds until one (or both) sides are destroyed,
break off, or have no squadrons left with space combat factors.  To
break off, you undergo a round of combat during which you cannot fire.
(And it screws up your movement plots, if any, so you have to start
over...)  (The Fleet combat table yields the number of defense factors
the opponent must lose, at a minimum, for that round).

There are also rules in FFW for System Defense Boats, the effect of
PAWS on airless worlds (they surrender), tanker squadrons, refuelling
based on Water/Gas Giants/Bases/Tankers, (plot moves carefully) Imperial
Warrants (Norris returns with one in the CT history and assumes
command...  sacking Vice Admiral Elphinstone in the process:  this
is because Elphinstone is represented as a 4:+1 (I think) Admiral
(4 turns plotting required), whereas Norris is a 0:0), etc. etc.

I like FFW very much, but playing it is a serious undertaking.  It
takes a _long time_.  It is much more complicated than Imperium, but
the extra complication is worth it.

Subject: BATTLE RIDER stats for Azhanti High Lightning

These stats are based on the FF&S version of AHL designed by Matt Goodman and
posted to the old TML awhile back. I have also included stats for the Rampart
fighter which, at least in CT, the AHL carries.

      The AHL carries no Battle riders, but it does carry 66 ramparts, as
well as a number of fuel shuttles, etc. BR doesn\'t seem to have rules for
fighter squadrons (perhaps they could be based on the rules for missle
groups, rather than dealt with individually).
     We took 7 Aurora class clippers up against the AHL, without using
fighters. The AHL was defeated, but there were only two Auroras left at
the end, and the HL\'s final death was due to a "Ship Explodes" result.s
                     Enjoy!

And that concludes this edition of Maserati\'s Fighting Ships

Next time: A few of my own designs.
Anybody want to sell me a copy of Fighting Ships of the Shattered

What is "Dark Nebula"? An Imperium-like game involving the Solomani
and Aslan?

I would like to see your additional Imperium material.

How does _Imperium_ compare in mechanics to _5th Frontier War_, which
I\'ve never played but have heard good things about?

OK, first of all I don\'t own TNE. I\'ve never even seen TNE. The first
I heard of it was on this list (pretty hip to things, huh?).

>From what I\'ve read on this list, there\'s something about a virus wiping

Is the ENTIRE PREMISE behind TNE that the intelligent-chip-things from
Signal GK take over the universe??? Sheesh. What next, hivers posing as
SolSec agents???

============================================

You should\'ve heard the howls of dismay/incredulity that greeted the
news of Virus on this list? As far as the hivers are concerned, it

I think the short range of 2 on these lasers is crap.  Even if you
assume that the Zhos standardize on Imperial turret sizes, there is room
in this weapon for fire control for a short range of 5 with .6 kl left
over for good measure... if we allow it to waste 1.3 kl above the
"normal" turret size, it can have SR=8  a *huge* improvement (actually,
though, I would use the SR=5 (and do) because it produces the most
damage at a range where it has a chance of hitting)

The same applies to all TL14 150 MJ lasers.
Which should be---- 5:1-1-1-0

What is the deal with missle fire control numbers, anyway?

With FC:-5, each dedicated MFD should control 5 missles, right?  I have
no idea how many MFDs the AHL would have, but this is way off on most BR
designs.  The valor as listed is M:20(40), but from BL it should be
M:24(20)... even if we assume auto loaders, it would still be
M:24(40)... how many more are screwy?

Cool, can\'t wait :)


We have assumed a feature on our BR counters (ones of our own design),
when a weapon shows a diffMod standard, it assumes power to shoot that
way (eg L(x10 -2)10:1... they have some listed as P[-2]10:12, we assume
that the square brackets indicate that while the weapon can be fired to
the improved DiffMod with no penalties, the power is not included (no
chance of trashing the weapon, but maneuver is curtailed to provide
power).

So many very interesting and creative ways to destroy a civilization...
Based on the comments from the list I think I\'ll leave the stellar
event as a supernova. It seems to fit best with what I wrote when I was
young and stupid. My question now is..




How long will the nova last before it collapses to a white dwarf.
Years? Decades? I need to know how long jump travel will be impossible.
Would it prohibit space travel in nearby systems? If so, for how long?




On another thread entirely, why is stutterwarp used in Trav2300 but not 
in CT, MT, and TNE. Has a plausible reason been published for why SW
technology disappeared? I don\'t have 2300 but I\'ve been playing with
FF&S. None of my homebrewed designs converted very favorably to TNE.
I figure TNE really is a new background so why not add a few more retcons.

TIA

Glenn

No, no, of course not.

The ENTIRE PREMISE behind TNE is that deliberately-mutated, MANIACALLY
HOMICIDAL versions of the intelligent-chip-things from Signal GK are
unleashed and DESTROY the universe.

As far as the Hivers posing as SolSec agents, I\'m sure you realize that\'s
COMPLETELY IMPOSSIBLE, because the Virus has DESTROYED civilisation, and
SolSec, TOO!  In order to pose as SolSec agents, the Hivers in T:TNE
have had to conduct a long MANIPULATION to CREATE a NEW SOLSEC, called
ARSES (or something that sounds like that).  You see, they\'ve got to
RECREATE SolSec BEFORE they can POSE AS SOLSEC AGENTS.

Just remember this when you see a Hiver "technical advisor" on an RCES ship.


As I\'m sure you can see, it\'s entirely different, and represents
no alteration whatsoever of the original Traveller concepts.

Note for the humor-impaired or lawsuit-inclined: the above to be delivered
in melodramatic tones with a heavy undercurrent of sarcasm, and a
loony-tunes inspired maniacal grin.  Many smilies implied, see:

:-)  :-)  :-)  In short: Yes, Ethan, T:TNE is really "Twilight:2000 in

The AHL has 40 TL-15 MFDs (and could therefore control up to 200 missiles
this way), but presumably would arm at least some of the fighters with FIMs
(Fully-Independent Missiles, see BL pp.20) which would engage their target
without needing MFD support.

Agains small vessels like the Auroras, the AHL would probably engage them
with fighters and missiles while the threats were outside of weapons range
to the AHL.  Presuming that the targets were detected in time, each Aurora
would brobably have been engaged by 8 FIMs each (two fighters per target,
from the squadron that was on CAP at the time) before getting within weapons
range of the AHL, and then by another 24 FIMs each (from an attack by the
other three squadrons of Ramparts, scrambled to interecept the Auroras).
After being thus softened up, and presuming that they haven\'t given up
already, they can engage the Azhanti itself.

Seven Auroras?  That\'s about 10,500 aggregate tons and at TL-12, too; the
rough equivalent of sending Osa-class PTMs against a US Aegis cruiser.  And
the Auroras win?  That doesn\'t sound right, unless that was a lucky hit.  I
don\'t have Battle Rider, but if the combat had been played out with Brilliant
Lances rules, the Auroras would have been toast.  The AHL could engage one
Aurora with the spinal MG each turn, (and given the ROF and MFD of this gun,
that should pretty much destroy whatever it fires at).  Dividing the remaining 
targets between the missile barbettes (firing, say 14 missiles at each target
each turn, until the maximum of 200 are in flight) [*].  The Azhanti has 500
missiles in ready storage, and another 1500 stored for reloading (and when
there\'s no boarding action going on, the ship\'s troops can assist the
reloading, too).

With the sandcasters and damper barbettes for anti-missile defense, combined
with the fact that Auroras aren\'t armed with missiles (at least, not the
version in the BL material), releases the lasers to go after the Auroras,
too - 14 of the 300Mj laser barbettes, per Aurora [*].

The Aurora\'s laser (1/9-27) doesn\'t stand a prayer of a chance at
penetrating the AHL\'s hull armor, so it can only scrape antennas and other
items off of the hull surface - and it will take a great many hits to get
rid of all of the systems - I recall that there are at least 4 sets of
everything, and usually more, aboard the AHL.

The Aurora\'s meson gun is at -2 diff mod to be repelled by the AHL\'s meson
screen (DV 158 versus PV 782), which means that 95% of the meson gun shots
that hit will be repelled - perhaps one shot penetrates the screen every
three turns or so.

The Aurora\'s have an advantage in overall maneuver fuel, and so could
probably break off whenever they wanted to, although again that would mean
running the gauntlet of the Azhanti\'s fighters and gunboats.

It sounds like Battle Rider combat results don\'t jive with Brilliant Lances,
at least, not when large ships are involved.

The Azhanti\'s have 40 Beam/Missile MFDs for the missile barbettes.  At least
in Brilliant Lances, this would allow 200 missiles to be controlled at once. 
So should the number be M:200<500)?  (number of missiles controlled, and number
of ready missiles).  Note that the Azhanti has another 1500 missiles in
cargo.

According to BL, the Valor has 4 MFDs, for a total of 20 missiles controlled
at once.  In addition, its missile barbettes have a total of 20 ready
missiles, for a rating of M:20(20), if I\'m guessing correctly.

If missiles in cargo should be included, then the Azhanti should be
M:200(2000), and the Valor should be M:20(40).


[*]  A few notes on the Azhantis: for historical (and presumably combat
coordination reasons) the ship\'s secondary weapons are divided into
\'batteries\' of 10 turrets; all of these engage the same target.  The AHL as
designed has one MFD per battery, but four independent and separate fire
control centers for each battery (for a total of 4 MFDs for each battery).

In the case of missiles, it makes a certain amount of sense to use the
additional MFDs to control extra missiles at the same target.  To do
otherwise would be silly - 10 barbettes in the battery, but only control 5
missiles at once?  It makes a lot more sense for there to be 10 barbettes in
the battery, and control 20 missiles at once, but restrict them all to the
same target.  It wouldn\'t be correct to use those extra MFDs to engage more
targets - the Azhantis can\'t engage more than 10 different targets with each
category of minor weaponry.  To play this ships fire control organization
properly, weapons should be allocated to targets in blocks of 10 barbettes.

The spinal mount, nuclear dampers, and particle accellerator bays each
engage targets independently - each weapon is a \'battery\'.

Against seven Auroras, each attacker would get engaged by one \'battery\' of
10 turrets, and three would get engaged by 20.

Regarding the recent question as to why 2300 has stutterwarp
but CT, MT, and TNE do not, the reason is that they are
two SEPARATE background universes.

Traveller (assorted) has its own timeline and technical assumptions.
2300 has a different set, which includes stutterwarp.

I would guess that core collapse of a massive star to a neutron star 
during a supernova takes of the order of the sound crossing time of the 
degenerate core. Seconds, in other words.

I\'m an extragalactic astronomer, not a stellar one, so don\'t quote me on 
that <grin>... 

Jump travel is so much technobullsh*t, so you can give whatever timescale 
you want for how long the supernova interferes with Jump 
travel..."gravitational radiation from the supernova event disturbs the 
Jump continua causing Jump travel to be extremely hazardous for 
years/decades/whatever..."

Um. SW didn\'t "disappear" from CT/MT/TNE...it never existed. 2300 
postulates a different timeline from Traveller (no Vilani lurking at 
Barnard\'s Star!) and has different laws of physics. Not that this should 
stop you producing your own variant <grin>

OK, if I remember this correctly, Supernovae (SNe) do not turn into white 
dwarfs, which are only for wimpy little stars (like less than 8 times the 
mass of the Sun), but instead become Neutron Stars, which are about 10 km 
across and have about the mass of the Sun.  These produce a lot of 
radiation, including radio waves (it may be a pulsar), I\'m not sure what 
else, I\'ll have to look it up.  Some are x-ray pulsars, and x-rays can be 
naxty.  As to how long before you can return to the system, well the 
initial radiation from the SN travels at the speed of light, so will be 
well clear of the system within a year, but I\'m not sure how long the 
thing takes to burn off everything and leave the naked neutron star.  I\'d 
guess it would be a few years before anyone would really want to visit 
the system, although why they would bother, I\'m not sure.  Escaping 
starships knocked out before jumping?  There is also a gravity wave 
(possibly) resulting from the collapse of the star, and this would arrive 
well ahead of the actual visual and physical explosion (which takes time 
to reach the surface of the star).  I\'d guess this would have an adverse 
effect on a starship attempting to jump when the wave passed by, and of 
course as gravity waves travel at the speed of light, this would be the 
first anyone knew about the SN.  About the only things I could imagine 
surviving for any significant time beyond the SN are any planets out (way 
out) in the outer system, and a companion star at a reasonable distance ( 
a few AU, at least orbit 6 or 7 in Scouts), and perhaps starships in the 
outer system which were shielded, say by a gas giant.  I suppose gas 
giants could survive quite well if they were far enough out, so maybe a 
shielded satellite would as well.  All this is a bit off the cuff, as I\'m 
not sure how long the violent part of the SN will last, or how long it 
remains intense.  If there was a companion star, this may be shedding gas 
onto the neutron star, which would result in a lot of x-rays.  

I\'m even less sure of the effects on the surrounding systems.  Generally 
not good,  suppose, although I\'d be suprised if they were physically 
catastrophic.  Even the closest system would probably have about 3 years 
warning (assuming the SN was a regular destination, and the change in 
traffic is noticable).  As I said before, if the SN was previously in an 
important economic, politcal, or social position, the collateral effects 
would probably be far more damaging.  Just thought of a reason why some 
people would be eager to return to the system quite soon after the SN; a 
(relatively) large amount of rare, star processed, elements would be 
blown out by the explosion, and these could be gathered by a clever and 
courageous prospector.

\'nuff for now

  Seriously, that was a conversion from the AHL done on the GDW-Beta list some
time ago, run through the conversion system in the BR rulebook, and is by no
means official or even accurate. As for the fight we staged, we didn\'t use any
fighters or the like as we didn\'t have any rules for them. Your point about the
ability of the lasers to penetrate AHL\'s armor is well-taken; the fatal hits
were done with a spinal mounted meson gun . I also erred in not pointing out
that these were Maggart class ships; the "stretch" Auroras mentioned in the
PATH OF TEARS books. Still, the victory did require a healthy dose of dumb luck
and the use of the d20 table in lieu of the damage markers.

Ethan, the whole purpose of TNE is to rebuild society after the collapse. 
Virus caused the collapse, and Virus is still running around (otherwise 
the Regency would have opened its borders by now). And if, in the process 
of rebuilding you come across a "Dark Sphere" in space, approx 40 parsecs 
across, centred on Core Sector, into which anything sent does not return, 
you begin to ask questions. Virus is alive and kicking. Surely youve 
wondered about what is behind the Black Curtain?

Mr Foster, we are all entitled to our own opinions. Maybe you would like 
to speculate as to what is behind the Black Curtain...?

It certainly is interesting that GDW decided that it was more important to 
include Cyborg design rules in FF&S then features like robots that had a
history in traveller.

Anyone running \'borgs in their games?

For starters, they are completely different timelines. T:2300 only shares 
the name "Traveller" with CT, MT, and T:TNE. There is no stutterwarp 
drive for the same reasons that there are no warp drives or phasers, or 
hyper-drive in CT or MT: they are artifacts that belong to a different
reality.

>I figure TNE really is a new background so why not add a few more retcons.

Is that add or cause? Actually, stutterwarp would cause a lot of problems 
since it is limited to 7.7 ly for a travel hop: slightly more than J2. J3 
distances would cause the drive to emit major radiation killing the crew 
and damaging its electronics (according to T:2300).

What is called when you CAUSE a future reality discontinuity that would 
require some future retcon? (If there isn\'t such a term, I\'d go for 
furdis...) Certainly GDW created enough furdis (plural same as singular;
like sheep or sh*t :-) with the introduction of T:TNE...

Actually, the timeline I had composed is summarized as follows;
(All names ommitted to prevent confusion)

Terran colonists, fleeing the impending collapse of the Terran Empire, are 
transported very far from their intended colonies due to a jump mishap. 
Over the next thousand years, an interstellar civilization matures with 
a single strong technical and military power controlling most of a sector.
The single power is overextended and the supernova is the herald of a new 
age of independence for clients of the empire. 

The supernova occurs at a critical jump point for trade with many new
colonies. The supernova has a far companion with a gas giant, however the 
radiation has disturbed the atmosphere, making skimming difficult/deadly.
Some amount of stellar material is captured by the companion as well.  

The radioactive wave travels into the core of the empire, disrupting 
communications and generally causing chaos. Many client seize their
chance for independence while the empire is paralyzed. The result is an
empire one third its original size surrounded by hostile new powers 
and a radioactive waste in the middle of a promising trade route.

Over the next five hundred years, several new powers contest the dominance
of the sector. The lost colonies have tried to survive on their own, but
most have been conquered by a new expanding alien civilization. 

Present campaign time is just prior to the rediscovery of the lost colonies
and first contact with the new territorial neighbors. The empire is awakening
and has realized the value of the star system which triggered its downfall. 
The ex-supernova system is going to be the staging point of new expeditions
into the unknown, new industrial opportunities, and future conflicts.

Whew! I don\'t think I gave too much away to any of my players that might 
read this. This should give you an idea of the kinds of details I\'ll 
need to provide over the next few months.

Exactly what I was looking to accomplish. Similar to Anderson\'s Mirkheim,
except that it would also be a choke point for trade and war. A system worth 
fighting over if I ever saw one.

BTW, I heartily reccommend the TNE rules for use in a non-VIRUS setting. 
FF&S and WTH are great resources for the creating a detailed original 
campaign. 

I previously asked about stutterwarp because I was looking to include it
in my campaign, though with some modifications. I saw it as a replacement
for jump drives. Maneuver drives would remain the same and the 10D and 100D
jump limitations would apply to stutterwarp.

Well, what do you think, sirs?

First off, I must say I was both quite impressed and quite disappointed 
with BATTLE RIDER.  Impressed, because I liked the diceless, 
decision-oriented style of play; disappointed, because I was hoping for 
some beefy stats on all those ships!

As someone who used to play Classic Traveller, lured back by TNE, I don\'t 
know squat about a good many of the ships contained therein.  And all I 
got was a bunch of counters and no background, ship names, etc., let 
alone Brilliant Lances/Traveller stats.  Can anyone shed some light on 
these vessels, or perhaps point me to a source (hopefully anonymous 
FTP!)? And where are those big boys from FIGHTING SHIPS OF THE SHATTERED 
IMPERIUM or whatever??

I wish for similar reasons that RAFM had included some sort of sheet with 
my miniatures detailing the ships, registry nos., etc.  Some of us don\'t 
have 15 years worth of material to draw from here.  I\'ve seen the SDB, 
CE, and Free Traders...what other miniatures are out?

Would anyone with silhouettes of any new ships be willing to scan them 
and post them to somewhere like ghost?  That would be key for those of us 
interested in printing up our own new counters...

And finally, would someone care to post references to the various alien 
languages of Traveller (I realize this could be quite extensive)?  As a 
linguist, I\'ve often pondered beefing up one of these languages a la Marc 
Okrand.  Just a thought.

OK, OK, I\'ll be quiet now.  Thanks for any help you can give me.

1) Virus and the Black Curtain


	I think you all have developed  a perfectly logical summary of what is 
happening behind the Black Curtain. Sure, now if I have this all down 
right. Virus takes over the data systems on Capitol and becomes super 
intelligence. Simple enough.
	Problem, what if it decides that it is now the Emperor . After 
all, it can claim the throne by right of assassination. That worked for a 
lot of admirals who didn\'t have an iota of the power that CapitolVirus 
has. So we have an AI as Emperor if it wants the throne.
	Then what? Then things would get REALLY SCARY. Remember, the 
Imperium has been working on FTL communications. Every computer in the 
galaxy could wind up in one big Net. There\'s an internet for you. I\'d be 
loging in from sfsu.edu.earth. Even if the time was days per parsec, 
that\'s a manageable lag. If it was less, things would get worse. One 
computer,over all the galaxy. Shiver.
	Then we note that we got cybernetics in FSS, and not robotics.
	
	The Borg probably started out like that. I\'d say that that\'s not 
the way its gonna happen. GDW caught enough flak ower the Virus in the 
first place. They\'d never compound that mistake. We would simply not buy it.

	So, nice theory. But we\'ll never see it. I hope. Its a good idea, 
but not a great one.


	And 2) That supernova thing. How about cutting off a section of 
space by means of the supernova. Imagine if an area smaller than the 
Spinward Marches was cut of completely from the Imperium?

I have wondered. I have greatly enjoyed the suggestions posted here and, based
on what we all know about GDW psych, they\'re probably near the truth. The
history interests me, even if I don\'t like the flavour of the changes. I think I
must be the only subber on TML or X-Boat who has an interest in the history but
hates the system. Sorry, but it _is_ a completely different game. Apply the new
rules to the old situation and everything changes - weapons and ship design
features do different things. A ship that was good suddenly becomes bad. It\'s as
if this morning you suddenly find your Jaguar is now slower than Mum\'s Lada.

>>Any Brits out there on the list who could tell me where I could buy Traveller

God, I wish I could! There were a very good series made by Denizen, which I
bought from the magnificent and (sob) defunct Games of Liverpool - not Traveller
particularly but very good sci-fi leads without being WarHamster Chaos
Nobblies.
If you find out, giz a yell!

>>It certainly is interesting that GDW decided that it was more important to

I would say this represents a veering from the Classic influences of fiction by
Asimov, Clarke and Lucas (Star Wars) and toward the current gaming trend of Dark
Future. This has coloured Traveller recently anyway but don\'t get me started!

>>Anyone running \'borgs in their games?<<

Actually, I\'ve just engineered a (highly believable) wormhole that dropped 202
Borg ships into the Foreven (in the system where Our Boys were at the time. As a
rather over-kind GM, my players were suffering from excess hubris of firepower
and the Borg are the perfect amswer. They crapped themselves. Traveller ships
have no defence against "away" teams. BTW, has anyone else merged Trek and
Traveller ? What, if anything, for example, can jam transporters ?

I\'ve been following the PAWS/MSG/Laser thread for a while, and decided
to go with limiting lasers above some as of yet undecided (leaning
towards TL*50) discharge energy... I was thinking of making the FA
volume (mass, etc) non-linear, so that you *could* make \'em, but they\'d
be less effective (but, hey, you might want one for some non-combat
reasons in a campaign).

Along those lines, I was thinking of making laser lances become less
feasible at a slower rate, so there would be a market for laser spinal
mounts, perhaps (you can\'t steer the singularity required to focus the
huge amount of energy, etc, blah, blah blah :)

Any ideas out there?


Along a different line of thought, I am still interested in converting
my favorite old ships (from CT fighting ships, etc), but the task is
daunting (in some cases impossible, ever design an 8000ton "T" meson gun
in FFS? ha ha).

One thing I did do was to convert all of the jump/maneuver/fuel stuff
(and the powerplant required for the man. drive) into % of displacement
tons format... that way I can look at, say the old Tigress and say, J4,
M6 with 50 g-turns(and PP to drive it) takes up 58% of the disp. A
decent meson gun is like 110,000tons, so add another 22% for80% total...
1.8% for LS and AG, say 8% for quarters... we\'ve got 10% left to play
with. Anyway, it results in some quick and dirty converstions (at least
far enough for BR stats if not BL). of the 10%, maybe 5% should just be
slop, and the 430 50ton missle bays are almost 5% alone, not to mention
the 300 50ton fighters--the Tigress isn\'t looking do-able as it was, so I
would go back and make it work (M4 would save like 1%, while J3 would
save 6%... fewer g-turns is possible, but who wants to build a huge pig
that has to worry about the smallest velocity change).

BTW anyone ever think about 21,500 missles launched from bays.  Yeesh.
We decided to have bay-mounted missles all attack the same target ie:you
launch 10 50ton bays at the BB over there... individual swarms from a
give bay fly together along the same path, no splitting, and control
*must* come from the launching ship (gang fire control cannot be passed
off due to its complexity (blah, blah)).

Keep up the BL/BR stuff!

I\'d have to agree.  I don\'t have BR yet either, but it doesn\'t sound

Actually, stutterwarp causes more problems than that, which were
never addressed in 2300..

Like, um, for example, the fact that a ship stutterwarping at full
efficiency, heading straight for your ship, is INVISIBLE, period, 
with ZERO CHANCE OF DETECTION (ie - a roll of automatic success
indicates a failure) to ANY SENSOR SYSTEM LIMITED TO THE SPEED OF
LIGHT.

Such a ship will eventually show up on your sensors, AFTER IT\'S
TOO LATE, and will appear to be moving IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION.

Once it\'s past you, that ship will be impossible to hit.

Of course, once a Stutterwarp ship comes into the area of a system
where it\'s efficiency degrades sufficiently that it\'s apparent
velocity is sublight, things get more manageable.

(Yuck.  I just reread the above sentence and realized what a dog
it is...  This might be an insult to dogs.)

If you put Stutterwarp in your campaign, you\'d better also add FTL
(ie: Tachyon) Sensors, or be willing to assume that space combat 
never occurs except in the immediate vicinity of a large mass.

Well,

1)  Duncan is probably right about the time of core collapse...  It
would take the time it takes for sound (travelling in a much denser
medium than air, so it would move much faster) to traverse the radius
of the collapsing portion of the original star.  Note that if this
is a SUPERnova, then the result will probably NOT be a white dwarf,
but a RAPIDLY spinning Neutron Star (a Pulsar), or a Black Hole (or
a Pulsar that draws in enough mass over it\'s life to become a Black
Hole eventually).  Note also that the Neutron Star, or Black Hole
will have a LESSER pull of gravity than the original star (insystem), 
because the original star will have blown off a portion of its mass.
This of course, assumes that you go no closer to it than the original
star\'s radius.  Once you get closer to it than that, all bets are
off (see Larry Niven\'s _Neutron Star_ for an example of how simple,
innocuous tidal effects can KILL YOU).

2)  It will make jump travel impossible for ZERO time.  In other words
it will have NO EFFECT on jump travel whatsoever.  Gravity is caused
by MASS, and the MASS hasn\'t changed, just been redistributed.  (ie -
Spent stellar fuel is blown off, and the core shrinks.  But [most]
of the mass is still there), and there is NO INCREASE in gravity
at normal distances from the star.

3)  It would not prohibit space travel in nearby systems.  However,
if those systems were really close, astronomically speaking, and the
SUPERnova were REALLY big, it could affect the environment of worlds
in the closest systems.  How much is debatable (that\'s a clever way
of saying that it\'s up to the GM (that\'s you!))

4)  The energy density of the original kaboom, however, would be
very dangerous to ships in the system (like a 100 MT detonation is
dangerous to a single bacterium), and this shell of hard radiation
will expand in two waves (one, the electromagnetic portion, will
travel outward from the former star at the speed of light.  The
second wave, high energy particles, will travel at slightly slower
speeds).  Remember though, that the density of this energy falls
off with the inverse of the cube of it\'s distance from the star
from which it was expunged...  By the time it gets, say, one
parsec away, it will be pretty feeble.

Sorry, I wasn\'t trying to rip you to shreds ...  Call it collateral
damage from friendly fire.  :-/

I was wondering if the results pointed out a problem with the ability of
Battle Rider to resolve combats between large ships.  In other words, does
Battle Rider give halfway sane results when handling very large ships or a
mixture of large and small ships?

I was referring back to that conversion to make my comments.  I used Matt\'s
design (the one from GDW-Beta a while back) as the T:TNE (actually, FF&S)
basis for comparison to the Auroras.
While it\'s certainly not a \'official\' (to my knowledge, it doesn\'t have
GDW\'s blessing), I don\'t believe a better conversion to FF&S could be made.

Matt did an excellent job at designing a truly large ship for T:TNE (and, as
far as I know, the only such design - does anyone else have FF&S designs for
ships larger than, say, 50,000 displacement tons?).  The complete design
evaluation, as well as the complete set of calculations for everything (not
only the ship itself, but the spinal and bay weapons, and the subordinate
craft) is available through the world wide web.  Connect to the URL
http://muon.qrc.com/gdw_beta/ahl.design and you\'ve got it all.  View it
online, or turn on load-to-disk to save it for later perusal.  Most of the
rest of the gdw-beta archives are at http://muon.qrc.com/gdw-beta/beta.html

Good point, and handling the fighters as separate ships would\'ve been an
incredible nightmare.  Has GDW mentioned fighter rules anywere, or given an
\'official\' example of a FIM?  (fully-independent missile - rules are included
in Brilliant Lances, but there are no such missiles available in the arms
lists)

I had hoped that Battle Rider wasn\'t THAT brain-damaged.

I believe that makes a difference, they have a considerably more capable
meson gun mounted, don\'t they?

Perhaps this is the culprit?  I still haven\'t seen the Battle Rider rules,
but if the table makes the implicit assumption (for example, by not
factoring in ship size versus damage done) that all of the ships in the
fight are approximately the same size, then it would produce incorrect
results when used in a situation like this.

Unfortunately, I\'m not likley to purchase Battle Rider myself - nobody to
play it with, and I don\'t really feel like spending money on a game I\'m not
going to play.

Regardless of our speculation about what is "really" behind the
Curtain, it can\'t be _too_ overwhelming. I base this from the
following (_Survival Margin_, p. 5):

"It is still common for archaeological and historical artifacts
relating to Lucan to be destroyed in an irrational exorcistical
frenzy within the area of the former Black Sphere." 
  - Victoria Kiigun and Norris Ushakov

Thus, by 1265, the Black Curtain is "former".

2) Stutterwarp

I think it\'s perfectly reasonable to prohibit combat between stut
ships outside of star systems. After all, space is big, and any ship
should be able to evade contact at will in the inky depths between
stars. An exception might be made if there\'s something "important" out
there, like a deep-space facility, but in general, the only things
worth fighting over are in star systems.

As far as insystem combat goes, I suggest folks try to dig up a copy
of Challenge #33, which contains the extended 2300AD/Star Cruiser
campaign "Lone Wolf".

There is a good article in TTC #4 by Mark "Geo" Gelinas & David McNeill, 
_Advantages and Disadvantages_  Take a look at that.  I think you\'ll find 
it to be just perfect for what you need (regarding quirks, neurosises and

Yeah, my Canada includes it too.  Too bad we can\'t find a ref for our

I just found this article in USENET, on chlorine atmospheres and their
implications.  Does anyone of you PhD\'s here care to expand on what other
atmospheres would entail?

Even if not, I still enjoyed this article... has anyone on the List followed
the entire thread?

You can use chlorine instead of oxygen as the oxidizer in the atmosphere.
There will still be fire, and a technical civilization could develop. 

Positing a chlorine breathing life-form, we get:

a) green skies. very cool special effect.
b) a rather complex biochemistry. Chlorine can only bind to one
other atom compared to oxygen, which can bind to two. This suggests that
we need some other atom to make the complex molecules of life possible.
How about phosphorous? The Kloro "carbohydrates" could consist of carbon
chains
that branch where P atoms connect, and the exact conformation dictated by the
presence of chlorine atoms instead of hydrogen. Or maybe they\'d use basically
earth style organic compounds, since you can get oxygen and hydrogen by
dissociating water. I dunno, and it\'s not terribly important, unless one
of the characters is a biochemist.

Points to consider (off the top of my head):

Water: I believe water should be stable in the presence of chlorine, but
since
their electronegativities (how well they grab electrons from other atoms) are
so
close, it becomes likely that the equilibrium between the seas and the
atmosphere
would lead to lots of HCl or HOCl in the sea -- acidic oceans! Nifty. I can
see
a lot of chemical engineering possibilities there. Perhaps instead of an
industrial revolution they have a chemical revolution -- with the coastal
states
(already wealthy because of sea trade) funding chemical research and becoming
the
super dominant powers. LOTS of sociological implications, even if you assume
a
basically human style psychology (but it\'s more fun if you don\'t :-)

Metal distribution: The geology of ore deposits is heavily affected by the
atmospheric composition. There\'s a lot of iron ore (low-grade, but so what?)
on Earth because iron oxide is more or less insoluble -- I think. Go to the
library and compare the solubilities of oxides and chlorides of metals to see
which metals the Kloros are likely to use. This is a very rough first
approximation, since there are all sorts of other factors, but for most
purposes
(up to and including a full-length novel) it should be sufficient. Another
factor
is that almost all water on Kloro is going to acidic -- this is another
factor in
the metal distributions.

Competition with Earth (happy answer): They and we shouldn\'t. The other
sides\'
atmosphere is completely toxic and corrosive, and a general pain to deal
with.
Why try to kill each other when ignoring the other is so much easier. It is 
entirely possible for the two interstellar states to inhabit the same volume
of space because we *can\'t* use the other sides\' worlds.

Competition with Earth (unhappy answer): We will. All it takes is for a few
individuals on either side to be stupid, and you can have all out
interstellar
war -- especially stupid since it\'s a completely pointless and futile effort.
But hey, that\'s life.

(Whew! I didn\'t realize I had that much verbiage in me. The Kloros are
*definitely* going in my next SF campaign -- they\'re too cool to ignore.)

   Loren, could you please describe what Alien Of Rim will contain?  Is 
   it going to be like the Alien Modules (Classic Traveller?)  If so, 
What Aliens are going to be detailed?  About the Long ships, the product 
will cover Aurora type ships plus other RC ships?  Is it going to be like 
the Starship operator\'s manuel type detail?

   Hey, you can always ask around the TML for a contest to see who can 
design Aurora\'s Deck plans.  I\'m sure a lot of people will try their 
hand.  In the end, you\'ll have more time working on the 
rules/background.  How\'s that :->

 Actually, it would depend on the pattern of matter being ejected by the
explosion. If there is enough junk being spewed into the (remains of the)
system, then Jumping into that system could be hazardous, as no volume
of space is guaranteed to be free of debris or localized gravity effects.
If the nova is spewing continuously, then the star\'s diameter _could be_
effectively increasing, causing Jump Space to eject a ship at extreme
distances (the current 100 diameter limit). This IS Science Fiction,
after all.

 For an interesting view of how a supernova could affect its neighbors,
you might read "Antares Dawn" and Antares Passage" by Michael McCollum.
The books use naturally occuring stargates instead of free-ranging Jump
drive, but are otherwise quite appropriate. It\'s almost enough to make
me want to run a stargates universe...

Okay, I have just one question of GDW.  When are you going to release
Vampire Fleets and The Regency Sourcebook?  Last time we heard from
you, you mentioned that Vampire Fleets was being pushed back to
January, to allow The Regency Sourcebook to be released first, and
incorporated into VF.  But this time around, you didn\'t mention either
one.  Please don\'t tell me that the two supplements that I\'ve really
been waiting for are being pushed back!

Yeah, the Imperium were developing FTL communications at the time of the 
Rebellion, but we dont know the nature of the com system, nor how far 
they were into the project. I think GDW have thrown themselves into the 
deep end here with hints of Cyborgs, FTL communications and hints of AI 
Ruled Empires. How they are going to tie it up I dont know, but I hope 
its good...!

Look at the TNE Referees Screen. It mentioned Borg like characters, so 
perhaps GDW have went that way already. IMHO it would be a waste of time 
for the CapitalVirus to turn the populaton of several worlds into cyborgs 
just to subjugate them. The majority of the population within the Black 
curtain would still be human. Where ship-crew/Security/Crack troops are 
needed then Cyborgs would fill those niches as they would be far more 
reliable and efficient. If CapitalVirus had an uprising on a world, it 
would nuke it. Clean and effiecient. So GDW can maintain a Borg flavour, 
without having to go the way of ST:TNG. Certainly I wouldnt like to see GDW 
to do that either.

Yes, but if you want it to, you can posulate a gravity wave, which acts 
as a moving source of gravity.  As we know next to nothing about these 
things (except that they are v. weak), you can say anything you want.  
Did my previous mail on this get posted?

Isn\'t this as radius squared.  I might be missing something here, but the 
thing that matters is how it is spread over the surface of an ever 
expanding sphere, particularly as the change in distance from the star 
from one end of a ship or distant planet to the other is pretty small 
compared with the distance from the star.

What\'s been written re. the SN question looks pretty good from here.

Just reread Derek Smith\'s email; a black hole formed straight out of a SN 
would be less massive than the original star, but it would have some 
weird effects on it\'s surroundings compared with a neutron star of the 
same mass.  On the other hand, a black hole formed from a pulsar sucking 
in matter could be more massive (eventually) than the original star, 
creating even more dramatic effects.  The TMLer who\'s question started 
all this (I can\'t remember who now) said his system was a binary; in that 
case, the companion could be having its surface sucked off by the neutron 
star/black hole, and the stream of gas from one to the other could be 
another lucrative source of star-processed elements.

The argument posed by GDW is that speeds outside a system (that
is FTL speeds) make fighting encounters close to impossible.
So combat only happens at subluminal speeds.  

The description of the effect of FTL on normal sensors actually
strenghens the above argument.  Since ships will in general be
travelling at FTL between systems they are virtually undetectable.

I think that Borg like is a bit difficult to fit in considering the current
environment.  However a Cylon like group would be more appropriate for
Virus.  Pure machine, pure AI, absoulte control.

Traveller already has sofisticated enough Bots that they could easily
perform all ships functions.  In fact, they would probably cause humans to
be slaves, (depending on the Virus type that was controlling the Bots).

There is a lot of possiblities, unfortunatly, the best ones have been used
by other SciFi sources.  Also, does any one who has read Asmov\'s Robot
series see any relationships here?

Its been a while since I read the 2300 rules, but I think the cutoff for SW 
going sublight is somewhere around the orbit of Jupiter -  In fact, a far
wider 
sphere then you have with Jump equipped ships.  Outside of the 100-diameter 
limit in mainstream traveller, space combat is still a matter of consent.

This was addressed in 2300AD--ships going at full efficiency just didn\'t
fight each other.

Well, never occurs except in the inner reaches of a system anyway. The "FTL
cutoff" for Sol is around the asteroid belt, which leaves plenty of room for
fighting that\'s not directly over a planet. Beyond that--well, nobody ever
fights in deep space anyway. Why would they want to?

Adding FTL sensors wouldn\'t be enough to let ships with stutterwarp fight in
deep space. They\'d need FTL weapons, too...

You are correct about it being an inverse square rather than an inverse
cube relation.  My apologies.  I was typing faster than I was thinking.
However, even radius squared is going to make it pretty F\'ing Feeble 
by the time it gets to the nearest system.

  Myself and Les Howie are going to do an experimental set of combats
involving my High Guard "Ulitmate Big Ship".  Patterned and named after the
Dreadnaught/ Carrier in _Battlestar_Galactica_, in my campaign the Humanex
Compact (my empire) realized that thier hostile neighbours were slightly
more advanced in military technology.  As a result, any ships the Humanex
Compact designed had to be of such size and firepower as to overwhelm any
force they might encounter.  Thus began the Battlestar Project.  Rough hull
dimensions are 1500m long, 300m wide by 150m thick in a slab configuration.
 Rough tonnage is 6.5MT.
  Once we are done the conversion process, I\'ll publish it here.  Currently
we have the main armorments in place; a single messon gun with a bore
length of 1200m and a support battery of PAWs with a bore length of 1200m. 
Secondary armarments will include armor-breaking lasers (5pts all bands),
point defense lasers (2 pts all bands) and "Standard" and "Cruise" missles
bays.  Carried ship compliment will include 150-ton fighters, landing craft
and scoop-shps.  It is being built at TL 13, so the effencies are awful on
the MG and PAWS, but it is a realistic TL.  Both the PAWs and MG still do
20 points and can reach out to *80* hexes.
  Once we have this done, we are, as I said, going to do some experimental
combats.  The intent is to prove/ disprove that big ships make sense in a
fleet context...  Because of the way BattleRider uses critcal hits, we have
been wondering if dozens of fast battlecrusiers are the right answer.  Or,
does the Dreadnaught/ Super-Dreadnaught still have a place in BattleRider. 
We\'ll keep you posted.

  In my short-lived 2300 game, I stated that the SW effect produced a
"Foot-print" of high-energy emmssions on each "real-space" segment of the
SW cycle.  As a result, while you might not be able to do anything about
them directly, you could build up a vector on where they were headed and at

I guess that answers alot of questions then. Right! Thats it! Ive had

Couldnt you drop up just a little hint

I think so too. Also its a bit of a rip off to copy one of ST:TNG\'s 
adversaries. As for Cylons, see below.

There are also other examples of societies where Humans and Computers 
rely on each other to survive. One example that springs to mind are the 
works of the author Iain M Banks. I dont know if his books are sold in 
the States, but for the benefit of those who have not read his stuff 
(shame on you!) I will now explain

Bank\'s novels (Consider Phlebus, Use of Weapons, Player of Games and 
State of the Art) are centred round an interstellar civilization known as 
"The Culture". The Culture is a human/computer symbiotic society. There 
are no laws, no formal hierarchy. Money does not exist, and the only 
things which are in short supply are energy and matter. Humans and 
computers both have an equal status in society, and both contribute to 
maintain the culture.

I think the society behind the Black Curtain, will not be like the Borg, 
nor like the Cylons. Instead it will be like the former 3rd Imperium, but 
with a few subtle twists.

(1) History has been rewritten within the Black Curtain, so as to make it 
look like the Collapse occured due to outside influences (not Lucan.). 

(2) Cybernetics have become an accepted part of the society. There is 
still a patent of Nobility, The Nobility having a greater percentage of 
metal being grafted on. There is no longer an Emperor, but instead a High 
Regent (Lucan with a lot of metal perhaps..?). Positions in high places/ 
Navy etc also have Cybernetics involved. The majority of people however 
still do not have prosthetics ("They do not have the privelige")

(3) An AI Virus runs the whole show (unofficially).

Its a bit sketchy (ha!) but I\'ll be working on it this weekend so 
hopefully I should be able to post something a bit more concrete next week.

That may be true, but I was referring to Stutterwarp in TNE.  I
believe the cutoff for Stutterwarp in TNE is much closer to the
star than that.

Well, I thought that I\'d share my take on the Black Curtain since
everyone else is doing it.

Virus reached Capital.  Once there, it infected computers and wreaked
havoc in the same manner it did around the rest of the Imperium. 
However, once it got to Capital/Capital, it came across one of the robot
Strephons.  Once this Strephon and the Capital\'s computers were
infected, Virus mutated into Emperor Virus.  Emperor Virus thought that
it was Strephon, or at least the one true Emperor, and soveriegn leader
of the Third Imperium.  It set across in it\'s body (Robo-Strephon) to
reclaim it\'s empire.  First, it had to defeat Lucan and regain the
capital.  Once this happened, it went about rebuilding it\'s corner of
the galaxy so that it could go ahead and recapture the rest of it\'s
Imperium.  However, Virus Emperor Strephon has many robots and borgs
working to expand it\'s TL base.  Why bots and borgs?  Because it\'s
mechanical.  I think that all of the humans would only be subjugated
slave labor.

Anyway, I think that the whold point of the Black Curtain source book
will be that Strephon has reached TL 17, has rebuilt its armada, and
that it\'s ready to reclaim the rest of it\'s empire...

Subject: Re: Hard SF: Alien Atmospheres 

Well, monitoring this discussion of alien atmospheres, I have decided
to come up with a list of substances which might -- or might not --
take the role of oxygen on alien planets.

Many oxidants have been suggested in science fiction.  On Earth,
oxygen is created by photosynthesis.  Other oxidants might come into
play the same way.  Photolysis of water wapour in the outer atmosphere
creates oxygen, which in turn might create other oxidants.  (On Earth,
ferric oxide and sulfates were created by oxygen.)

However, I think oxygen is still the likeliest choice.  Each oxidant
has a non-oxidant counterpart which it is formed from in
photosynthesis.  Photosynthesis is basically reduction of CO2 to
organic carbon, and it needs a reducant(sp?).  The correspondence is the
following:

Reducant       Oxidant

Water          Oxygen
Ammonia        Nitrogen (*)
Hydr.sulfide   Sulfur   (*)
Nitrogen       Nitric acid, nitrates
Water          Hydrogen peroxide
Chlorides      Chlorine
Sulfur         Sulfuric acid, sulfates (%)
Ferrous oxide  Ferric oxide (%)

(*) No oxidizing properties.
(%) Too weak an oxidant for fire.

The ammonia/nitrogen and hydrogen sulfuride/sulfur cases are one-way
reactions, there won\'t be nitrogen or sulfur `breathers\'.  All other
may have something analogous to Earth oxygen breathing process, and
therefore be circuit processes.

The most common reducant is of course water, so oxygen is the
likeliest oxidant.

Note that none of these oxidants are likely to coexist with a reducing
atmosphere.  Besides the oxidant itself, you have the common redox-neutral
components: nitrogen, carbon dioxide, water vapour, noble gases.

Oxygen: 
We have this on Earth.

Nitrogen:
Everybody knows what it\'s like, too.

Nitric acid:
Liquid, forms acidic oceans and rivers.  There will be nitric oxides
and nitric acid vapour in the atmosphere.  The sky is deep
reddish-brown.  Little light reaches the surface.  Oxygen probably
will also be present as a photolysis by-product.  Metal oxides turned
into nitrates which are highly water-soluble -- most metals will be
in the oceans.  Carbonates don\'t exist because nitric acid turns them
to nitrates, releasing CO2.  This CO2 could create a nasty, Venus-like
greenhouse.  If this doesn\'t happen, adapted lifeforms might exist.
Fire is possible, and therefore technology.
However, nitrates are likelier.

Nitrates:
Dissolved in water, don\'t affect planetary chemistry much, though
atmosphere won\'t be reducing and will probably hold smaller quantities
of nitric oxides and oxygen.  Dry nitrates might occur in arid areas.
These can be used to create fire.  Technology might be possible.

Hydrogen peroxide:
Liquid, exists dissolved in water.  There will also be oxygen, and
some hydrogen peroxide vapour in the atmosphere rendering it poisonous
to humans.  Otherwise, not much weirdness as compared to Earth.  Life,
fire and technology possible.

Chlorine:
The sky is green, the oceans are acidic (HCl and HOCl).  Metal oxides and
carbonates turned into chlorides (mostly soluble).  Life might evolve,
fire and technology possible.

Sulfuric acid:
Liquid, strong acid, but weak oxidant.  Acidic oceans, most metals
dissolved as sulfates.  (Not that heavy metal sulfates mostly dissolve
well.)  Life might exist, but H2SO4 won\'t be strong enough for fire.
Sulfates are likelier.

Sulfates:
Most sulfates dissolve well in water (important exception: calcium
sulfate).  No strong effect on planetary chemistry.  No fire possible.

Ferric oxide:
Solid.  Weak oxidant, low influence on planetary chemistry.  No fire
possible.

Sulfur:
Some bacteria create this in photosynthesis instead of oxygen.  No
oxidizing properties.

Everything else doesn\'t seem likely for miscellaneous reasons (rare,
exotic elements involved, not stable enough, etc.)  One of these
losing candidates, which is still quite popular, is fluorine.
This CANNOT occur naturally!  The only way leading to it is
electrolysis.  Photosynthetic organisms can\'t produce it.  It is
strictly impossible.  Liquid water immediately *bursts into flame*, as
does organic material.  Therefore, fluorine released somehow won\'t
survive long.

  Interesting point.  But it all comes down to the fact that 2300
sensors only detect light (or electromagnetic radiation) that travels
at the speed of light.  Given the scale of interstellar distances the
foot-print left by a ship would take months or years to reach a sensor.
Remember that SW ships don\'t have to travel in a straight line.  And
since they are subject to gravity like any other chunk of matter they
probably don\'t.  So you can\'t guess the location of a ship from it\'s
initial direction and sw "speed".

    Going back to the article on pairing phase:  the idea is also
good but again given the scale of space how do you find the ships
in the first place???

I threw together some more interesting Regency-related info.  I
ran the ftp files for the Marches, Deneb, Reft, and Troy through
a short C program to filter out the non-Imperial worlds and get
some information.  Deneb, Reft, and Trojan Reach are circa 1120,
and the Marches are circa 1112, so the figures below include all
early-Rebellion effects except the invasion of the rimward end
of the Marches.

Below are all the worlds which were members of the Domain of
Deneb that had populations in the ten billion range or higher, 
ordered roughly in their economic importance to the Domain.  
These twenty worlds contain eighty percent of the Domain\'s 
population.  Subsector names have been added to help find them.

Another 10% or so of the Domain\'s population is on the fairly
numerous lesser HiPop worlds.  Some of those worlds have better
starports and local tech than the majority of the worlds listed 
here.  Losing three billion people to Virus on Trin is quite a 
blow, though, even though Trin only represents one percent of 
the Domain population.  The ihatei also took at least one world,
Tobia/Tobia, off this list.

I suspect that some of those "charismatic dictatorships" are 
the local nobility, like at Vincennes; it would certainly help 
explain why there are so many HiPop worlds with dictators.  
(Besides the generation rules, that is.)  :)

Speaking of Vincennes, the Regency is very lucky to include a
world which was developing TL17 robotics before the Collapse
(MTJ #3).  Vincennes is the world both with the most to lose
to the virus, and the best equipped to understand it.  Experts
from Vincennes will go to study the vampires, but Vincennes 
will also be the most virus-paranoid world in the Regency.

A message from Mora by xboat can make it to the outer edge of 
the Domain in about twelve weeks, be it Jewell, Five Sisters,
or Lamas.  

Overall Statistics (files as above, all worlds):

Member Systems:           649
Total Population:         992,300,000,000
Per Capita TL:            11.51

By 1202, the Regency will most likely have broken the one trillion
mark in population, but overall, most of the worlds above can\'t 
even deal with one percent annnual population growth.  (They can\'t
afford to have the population double in 70 years!  Neither of the
contenders for most populous planet have much land on them --
Beaxon/Gulf with its\' 90 billion residents is a waterworld.  There\'s 
a good reason why the TAS made it an amber zone!)

"Per Capita TL" was computed by multiplying population with TL in
order to find the average tech level enjoyed by the populace.  The
Domain tech was probably low for the Imperium -- while other DGP
files are less dependable, they suggest it\'s about one or two tech 
levels low, and Core, Solomani Rim and Massilia may have averaged 
fourteen per capita or more.  MegaTraveller\'s TL 11-12-13 for 
"Avg Stellar" seems to work pretty well.

Actually, it was when I reread Flandry that I started on this effort
to revise SW for the TNE rules. I noted that Anderson uses a gravitic
sublight drive which is probably closer to CT\'s reactionless drives.
Also, there is mention of going out of SW before entering a system. 
It was a safety to avoid the greater chance of hitting another mass
(space debris & micrometeoroids).

BTW, I recently came across a cache of science fiction. I have
many duplicates titles; Anderson, Norton, Piper, and Tubbs included.
Does anyone know of a mailing list or interest group on the internet
where I might swap these. If anyone on the TML is interested email
me for a complete list. I have to index everything first.

Well, I thought that I\'d share my take on the Black Curtain since
everyone else is doing it.

Virus reached Capital.  Once there, it infected computers and wreaked
havoc in the same manner it did around the rest of the Imperium. 
However, once it got to Capital/Capital, it came across one of the robot
Strephons.  Once this Strephon and the Capital\'s computers were
infected, Virus mutated into Emperor Virus.  Emperor Virus thought that
it was Strephon, or at least the one true Emperor, and soveriegn leader
of the Third Imperium.  It set across in it\'s body (Robo-Strephon) to
reclaim it\'s empire.  First, it had to defeat Lucan and regain the
capital.  Once this happened, it went about rebuilding it\'s corner of
the galaxy so that it could go ahead and recapture the rest of it\'s
Imperium.  However, Virus Emperor Strephon has many robots and borgs
working to expand it\'s TL base.  Why bots and borgs?  Because it\'s
mechanical.  I think that all of the humans would only be subjugated
slave labor.

Anyway, I think that the whold point of the Black Curtain source book
will be that Strephon has reached TL 17, has rebuilt its armada, and
that it\'s ready to reclaim the rest of it\'s empire...

Subject: Re: Hard SF: Alien Atmospheres 

Well, monitoring this discussion of alien atmospheres, I have decided
to come up with a list of substances which might -- or might not --
take the role of oxygen on alien planets.

Many oxidants have been suggested in science fiction.  On Earth,
oxygen is created by photosynthesis.  Other oxidants might come into
play the same way.  Photolysis of water wapour in the outer atmosphere
creates oxygen, which in turn might create other oxidants.  (On Earth,
ferric oxide and sulfates were created by oxygen.)

However, I think oxygen is still the likeliest choice.  Each oxidant
has a non-oxidant counterpart which it is formed from in
photosynthesis.  Photosynthesis is basically reduction of CO2 to
organic carbon, and it needs a reducant(sp?).  The correspondence is the
following:

Reducant       Oxidant

Water          Oxygen
Ammonia        Nitrogen (*)
Hydr.sulfide   Sulfur   (*)
Nitrogen       Nitric acid, nitrates
Water          Hydrogen peroxide
Chlorides      Chlorine
Sulfur         Sulfuric acid, sulfates (%)
Ferrous oxide  Ferric oxide (%)

(*) No oxidizing properties.
(%) Too weak an oxidant for fire.

The ammonia/nitrogen and hydrogen sulfuride/sulfur cases are one-way
reactions, there won\'t be nitrogen or sulfur `breathers\'.  All other
may have something analogous to Earth oxygen breathing process, and
therefore be circuit processes.

The most common reducant is of course water, so oxygen is the
likeliest oxidant.

Note that none of these oxidants are likely to coexist with a reducing
atmosphere.  Besides the oxidant itself, you have the common redox-neutral
components: nitrogen, carbon dioxide, water vapour, noble gases.

Oxygen: 
We have this on Earth.

Nitrogen:
Everybody knows what it\'s like, too.

Nitric acid:
Liquid, forms acidic oceans and rivers.  There will be nitric oxides
and nitric acid vapour in the atmosphere.  The sky is deep
reddish-brown.  Little light reaches the surface.  Oxygen probably
will also be present as a photolysis by-product.  Metal oxides turned
into nitrates which are highly water-soluble -- most metals will be
in the oceans.  Carbonates don\'t exist because nitric acid turns them
to nitrates, releasing CO2.  This CO2 could create a nasty, Venus-like
greenhouse.  If this doesn\'t happen, adapted lifeforms might exist.
Fire is possible, and therefore technology.
However, nitrates are likelier.

Nitrates:
Dissolved in water, don\'t affect planetary chemistry much, though
atmosphere won\'t be reducing and will probably hold smaller quantities
of nitric oxides and oxygen.  Dry nitrates might occur in arid areas.
These can be used to create fire.  Technology might be possible.

Hydrogen peroxide:
Liquid, exists dissolved in water.  There will also be oxygen, and
some hydrogen peroxide vapour in the atmosphere rendering it poisonous
to humans.  Otherwise, not much weirdness as compared to Earth.  Life,
fire and technology possible.

Chlorine:
The sky is green, the oceans are acidic (HCl and HOCl).  Metal oxides and
carbonates turned into chlorides (mostly soluble).  Life might evolve,
fire and technology possible.

Sulfuric acid:
Liquid, strong acid, but weak oxidant.  Acidic oceans, most metals
dissolved as sulfates.  (Not that heavy metal sulfates mostly dissolve
well.)  Life might exist, but H2SO4 won\'t be strong enough for fire.
Sulfates are likelier.

Sulfates:
Most sulfates dissolve well in water (important exception: calcium
sulfate).  No strong effect on planetary chemistry.  No fire possible.

Ferric oxide:
Solid.  Weak oxidant, low influence on planetary chemistry.  No fire
possible.

Sulfur:
Some bacteria create this in photosynthesis instead of oxygen.  No
oxidizing properties.

Everything else doesn\'t seem likely for miscellaneous reasons (rare,
exotic elements involved, not stable enough, etc.)  One of these
losing candidates, which is still quite popular, is fluorine.
This CANNOT occur naturally!  The only way leading to it is
electrolysis.  Photosynthetic organisms can\'t produce it.  It is
strictly impossible.  Liquid water immediately *bursts into flame*, as
does organic material.  Therefore, fluorine released somehow won\'t
survive long.

After reading the battle star post i feel its time to send in  my
silly ship ( or at least the basics that i can remember)
Here we are    ( swirls of dry ice smoke)

the  TL is so the damm teleporter and force wall work at  roughly
what i can get from the Blakes 7 Tv series
with  3  1000000  Mw meson guns thaT are abough 30  KM  long  the

  Interesting point.  But it all comes down to the fact that 2300
sensors only detect light (or electromagnetic radiation) that travels
at the speed of light.  Given the scale of interstellar distances the
foot-print left by a ship would take months or years to reach a sensor.
Remember that SW ships don\'t have to travel in a straight line.  And
since they are subject to gravity like any other chunk of matter they
probably don\'t.  So you can\'t guess the location of a ship from it\'s
initial direction and sw "speed".

    Going back to the article on pairing phase:  the idea is also
good but again given the scale of space how do you find the ships
in the first place???

I threw together some more interesting Regency-related info.  I
ran the ftp files for the Marches, Deneb, Reft, and Troy through
a short C program to filter out the non-Imperial worlds and get
some information.  Deneb, Reft, and Trojan Reach are circa 1120,
and the Marches are circa 1112, so the figures below include all
early-Rebellion effects except the invasion of the rimward end
of the Marches.

Below are all the worlds which were members of the Domain of
Deneb that had populations in the ten billion range or higher, 
ordered roughly in their economic importance to the Domain.  
These twenty worlds contain eighty percent of the Domain\'s 
population.  Subsector names have been added to help find them.

Another 10% or so of the Domain\'s population is on the fairly
numerous lesser HiPop worlds.  Some of those worlds have better
starports and local tech than the majority of the worlds listed 
here.  Losing three billion people to Virus on Trin is quite a 
blow, though, even though Trin only represents one percent of 
the Domain population.  The ihatei also took at least one world,
Tobia/Tobia, off this list.

I suspect that some of those "charismatic dictatorships" are 
the local nobility, like at Vincennes; it would certainly help 
explain why there are so many HiPop worlds with dictators.  
(Besides the generation rules, that is.)  :)

Speaking of Vincennes, the Regency is very lucky to include a
world which was developing TL17 robotics before the Collapse
(MTJ #3).  Vincennes is the world both with the most to lose
to the virus, and the best equipped to understand it.  Experts
from Vincennes will go to study the vampires, but Vincennes 
will also be the most virus-paranoid world in the Regency.

A message from Mora by xboat can make it to the outer edge of 
the Domain in about twelve weeks, be it Jewell, Five Sisters,
or Lamas.  

Overall Statistics (files as above, all worlds):

Member Systems:           649
Total Population:         992,300,000,000
Per Capita TL:            11.51

By 1202, the Regency will most likely have broken the one trillion
mark in population, but overall, most of the worlds above can\'t 
even deal with one percent annnual population growth.  (They can\'t
afford to have the population double in 70 years!  Neither of the
contenders for most populous planet have much land on them --
Beaxon/Gulf with its\' 90 billion residents is a waterworld.  There\'s 
a good reason why the TAS made it an amber zone!)

"Per Capita TL" was computed by multiplying population with TL in
order to find the average tech level enjoyed by the populace.  The
Domain tech was probably low for the Imperium -- while other DGP
files are less dependable, they suggest it\'s about one or two tech 
levels low, and Core, Solomani Rim and Massilia may have averaged 
fourteen per capita or more.  MegaTraveller\'s TL 11-12-13 for 
"Avg Stellar" seems to work pretty well.

Actually, it was when I reread Flandry that I started on this effort
to revise SW for the TNE rules. I noted that Anderson uses a gravitic
sublight drive which is probably closer to CT\'s reactionless drives.
Also, there is mention of going out of SW before entering a system. 
It was a safety to avoid the greater chance of hitting another mass
(space debris & micrometeoroids).

BTW, I recently came across a cache of science fiction. I have
many duplicates titles; Anderson, Norton, Piper, and Tubbs included.
Does anyone know of a mailing list or interest group on the internet
where I might swap these. If anyone on the TML is interested email
me for a complete list. I have to index everything first.

I just caught up after being *way* behind on reading these. But I think
my comments are still timely.

Someone suggested that you might be safe hiding behind a gas giant. Nice
try, but it won\'t work. A calculation made based on the supernova in the
LMC a few years back showed that at 10 AU (the distance of Jupiter from
Sol) the *neutrino* flux alone would be lethal! That is, if you were
shielded from everything except neutrinos, the neutrino flux would be so
high that even with the incredibly low rate at which they interact with
matter, you\'d *still* receive a lethal amount of radiation damage from
them.

So hiding behind even a gas giant wouldn\'t help. And the gas giant would
be pretty well fried.

As for the effects at a distance, please recall that the energy output
of a supernova is something in the neighborhood of *billions* or
*trillions* of times that of a normal star (essentially it has an output
equal to a *galaxy* for a while). Even with the inverse square law,
that\'s gonna be pretty nasty at even a few light years.

1 parsec = ~400,000 AU (it\'s *exactly* TAN(.5 seconds of arc))
1 parsec = ~6e13 km

So if it\'s a trillion times normal output, at one parsec it\'d be about 6
times the output of a normal star 1 AU away.  Yow!

This is endurable, though it\'ll screw up a lot of things. But chugging
along behind the radiation is the gas shell. This is the outer layer of
matter ejected from the star. It\'s traveling just under light speed and
is equivalent to a *major* PAW!

For example, if the density(d) is 1 particle per cm^3 (high, but it\'ll
do for a calculation) and is travelling at a v of .8c, you get a
particle flux of d*v.

1*(.8c)
.8c
.8*3e10
2.4e10 particles per second.

The flux is *directly* proportional to both the density and the
velocity. So the same velocity, but a density of 1 particle per cubic
*meter* gives 2.4e4 or 24,000 particles per second (or counts per second
:-) That\'s still pretty nasty.

The "plasma shock wave" will disrupt many things for quite a ways. At a
guess 20-50 parsecs. After all, it only has to be as "strong" as a good
solar flare to muck up some things, and be a major pain in the neck.

Jumping into the system where the supernova occured is a good way to get
dead, fast. For years afterwards, the energy flux from the pulsar
"stirring" it\'s nebula will be lethal. The whole system will be a cloud

of high energy plasma, with powerful trapped magnetic fields.

It won\'t be as lethal as flying thru a nuclear fireball, but it won\'t
be a lot friendlier. Remember, much of the luminosity as the brightness
decays is due to the breakdown of shortlived radio-isotopes. Skimming
them may sound like a good way to make a profit, but in reality it\'d be
more like walking into a *running* fission reactor!

Add in the x-ray "searchlight" effect from infalling matter at the
*magnetic* poles of the pulsar and you could get toasted good. You\'ll
have the magnetic field of the pulsar sweeping by several times a
*second* even if you *aren\'t* in the path of the x-rays, and every
sweep will be worse than any EMP you\'ve ever thought of.

As the nebula expands over nearby systems (taking years), it\'ll make
them somewhat hazardous. Eventually the nebula will be dispersed enough
to make visting the pulsar somewhat safe. But that will be *centuries*
down the road. Remember, the crab nebula is from a supernova in AD 1054,
and that colorful glow is from the radiation *still* floating around.

And there\'s still an active pulsar lurking there. Until things quiet
down a lot more, visiting a "recent" (ie last millenium or two) pulsar
is not advisable.

If it went all the way to a black hole, just remember those "cute"
pictures of accretion disks, and remember that most of the radiation is
in the gamma and x-ray range. So if you are close enough to see that
disk, you\'re dead.

If you want a lesser catastrophe, note that all known types of novae
require a binary system, with one member being a white dwarf or neutron
star. Infalling matter from the other star slowly accumulates until it
reaches a point where the pressure on it is enough to initiate a fusion
reaction. That\'s the nova. Though it is possible to get a supernova by a
similar mechanism, but that involves things like a white dwarf
collapsing to a neutron star, and blowing off its outer layers in the
process.

Anyway, this has gotten rather long, so I\'ll end it here.

Capital is extensively described in Travellers Digest 9 as at 175-1104.  
TD was "approved", so these are presumably official (officialish?).

To summarise: A586A98F
Mean surface temperature 27.2 degrees C
Minor human race
5 major continents, 1 minor continent, 5 major islands, 9 archipelagoes
Single world ocean, no minor oceans
Sample cities Turthu (c. 9 billion, B port), Benca (c. 6 billion, A 
port), Cleon (c. 4 billion, A port).
Has achieved TL G in medical technology due "to recent success with 
brain transplants". There is a local fish that "men find delicious but 
women find tasteless" (they suggest it is something to do with male 
chromosomes). Children are commonly sent to boarding schools due to 
population crowding (unlikely to be a problem in the New Era).

I didn\'t want to retype the whole thing, as this would be against 
copyright.  There are numerous other articles of interest here, such as 
a description of the Imperial Palace and Grounds.

The UWPs match those in the Core sector UWPs I have, copyright 1989 DGP 
and GDW.  Seems to have a single star, M0 V.  Amazing, a world written 
up as a shirtsleeve environment world that orbits a star that can 
actually support it! 8O) <- (glasses, big nose and smiley)

P.S. My 2 cents worth on the Black Curtain comes from the brain 
transplant bit. Virus develops a advanced CPU and replaces the brain of 
Lucan, or a Strephon clone, with it, and no-one can tell, externally.  
Or else physically replaces parts of the named brain with some computer 
circuitry.  That way, Virus "infects" a human, without actually having 
to use the human\'s brain as a CPU, which seems impossible (don\'t start 
that thread up again).  And once Lucan/Strephon done, why stop there?  
Clone the rest of the pre-assassination Imperial family and "infect" 
them too?  The rest of the planetary population?  Maybe Virus tries 
kidnapping humans from worlds outside the Black Curtain to do fiendish
brain experiments.  Maybe the parts of the brain the circuitry is 
attached to keeps dying off, and the Vampire ships have to keep getting 
more people as sources of cranial matter on (a bit like the "Red Dwarf" 
episode called Psirens).  Once Virus gets really insane, the humans 
get programmed to stand around all day juggling and stuff, like a 
warped Imperial court (sicker suggestions omitted for obvious reasons).  
If there is more than one Virus there, they have endless battles, using 
the humans as soldiers and regarding them as disposable, merely things
that are useful for carrying weapons from one place to another.

I wish I hadn\'t thought of all that, I\'ve just had lunch.  I think I may
have seen one Peter Greenaway film too many.

Hmmm.  First, on the Azhanti design.  The meson gun and the lasers should
be overpowered to (-2), like other fleet ships.  The Azhanti is large
enough that it has the power to burn, and I see that the lasers look like
custom jobs anyway.  Why a 12 and not a 16 hex AEMS-DF?  The savings isn\'t
worth it.  A 8 hex passive couldn\'t hurt, but the economy makes more sense
there.  The PAWS seems a bit weird; it\'s light for anything but anti-
missile fire, especially with that range.

Here too?  This ship *needs* at least 40 missile MFDs.  Just checking.

It lives!  Actually, the Azhanti is immune to the Maggarts\' meson gun fire
too.  Meson hit at short range from a Maggart is an unmodified DV 6; then
the Azhanti gets its\' meson screen (-11) and the size modifier (-3) for
a total of -8; no effect.  Since size alone fails to take DV below zero,
a nearby Maggart still does DV 0 to the Azhanti; temporary damage, and
"ship explodes" is possible.  And a successful screen attempt avoids even
that much risk.  Did something else take out the screen?  Otherwise, the
Maggarts would have had to have been *real* lucky.

As Derek Wildstar mentioned, the Azhanti is also immune to the Maggarts\'
laser fire.  The only weapon they have that can threaten the Azhanti is
their det-laser missiles.  If these are LC Maggarts, then there could be
as many as 168 incoming missiles in a turn.  The anti-missile defenses
(dampers, and laser turrets, usually) would stop some of this, but
a lot gets through.  Now, it isn\'t clear if the size modifier and the
armor modifier should be added to missile fire like it is to laser fire,
but it seems that at least the size modifier should.  So there\'s an
immediate (-3) to (-4) on DV for every missile hit, and the average DV
for missile fire is only 3.  Each sandcaster used on a missile that hits
reduces DV by another 1.  It might even be advisable for the Azhanti
to use its\' own missiles to get the incoming missiles.  If the Maggarts
concentrate their fire on one hex-side, it is possible that the cruiser
could get overwhelmed and be "nickel-and-dimed" to death.  Note that
this is *only* possible because of the alteration to missile damage
from TNE mentioned in the _Battle Rider_ rules; otherwise, the Azhanti 
is quite invulnerable.

Meanwhile, the screen-less Maggarts are helpless to the Azhanti\'s large
meson gun, and if the cruiser\'s secondary weapons aren\'t all tied up
in defense, they are vulnerable to at least temporary damage hits from
those as well.  Ditto for missile fire, and the Azhanti has more ready
missiles that it can control than the Maggarts do.  

The Maggarts can beat the Azhanti, but they have to be captained very
smartly to have a chance at it.

Add in the Rampart fighter screen, and it\'s all over for the clippers.

Derek Wildstar added, after making several good comments,

>It sounds like Battle Rider combat results don\'t jive with Brilliant Lances,
>at least, not when large ships are involved.

True.  The big ships have an advantage!  In BL, a high-damage weapon will
deliver only a fraction of its\' damage to the inside of a ship before
venting to space; in BR, the ship gets deep-fried.  This makes some sense,
since the ship scale in BL tends to be smaller, and so it\'s more likely
that a hit will go right through the little ship.

To answer the question that someone asked. Does anybody play \'Borgs?
Why yes We have had a \'borg in our gruop.
M.C. OMulligan ( 9 Lives ) is some what sensitive about the subject
as she is NOT able to have the regeneration done on her. Reason: VERY
Classified... Burn BEFORE reading...
but she got on her retirement the best that Susag had to offer looks
real Uses micro grav tech. Wonderful stuff With some toys built in her
favorite was the flashlight. BUT when the fleet withdrawel order came in
guess where the Susag Doctors and theripists went...
She got no training with the new stuff... Can you say Breaking things?
People as well?
I knew you could...
She has gotten\' much better now. On the last ship she was on ( she was
a passenger this time ) She only broke a table and a door!
not bad...
So yes \'Borgs can be fun, just remember that in some places in the
Imperium they don\'t get in the front door - as a matter of fact in
Margret\'s space M.C. would be the States property!!!
Catie ( Who\'s Character M.C. is ) Started a story whit M.C. having been
kidnapped - Misjumped to Margrets space ( back in time some as well as
a looooong distance ) only to be resqued by a Zhodani crew of a Consular
cruiser... I won\'t go into any further details...
but such characters have some Tremdious advantages as well as quite a few
disadvantages.

On another Thought ( Uh Oh here it comes :-) ) Hou about oathes of fealty
do imperial nobles take on such oathes and do they then become responsible
for their sworn people ?
such as bodyguards, seneschals, Yacht captians...
I\'d like to see a discussion on this subject as I have not considered this
before in all of the years I\'ve played, although there where nobles in the
games this just never came up.
Loren? ( Good to "see" you back here! )
thanks

jim 

By the way all o\' the mispellings are mine all mine Really would you want
them?

NOTES:

ORBITAL INSTALLATIONS:

Several habitats, Grav cities, and factories orbit above Capital. The 
largest habitat, Ton Vorn, serves as Capitals main highport. Ton Vorn is 
Capitals "artificial moon", a ball of rock 400km across orbiting Capital 
at a distance of 497,000km. Ton Vorn, was created to address the growing 
volume of shipping and the influx of immigrants in the founding years of 
the Imperium. Dragged from the systems Oort Cloud in 148, and deemed 
habitable in 301, Ton Vorn is over 814 years old and is a testament to 
the engineering skills of the Empire.

Home to over five billion citizens, Ton Vorn is one of the wonders of the 
sector to visit. 

THE INNER SYSTEM:

Shulligaam, the innermost planet lies uninhabited, and is mainly ignored 
save the occsional probe to map its surface.
Dagll a settlement started during the Second Imperium, is home to a few 
rugged miners who prospect over the surface and in the rings in search of 
heavy materials.

CAPITAL:

See Travellers Digest No 9 (FACT ALERT: I dont have TD:9!!)

THE OUTER SYSTEM:

Courasiis, the first of Capitals five Gas Giants, sports a few 
settlements on some of its smaller moons. Auralin however claims its 
roots from the first Imperium, when Vilani colonists used Corasiis as a 
refuelling point. Today Auralin is a major Military and Naval base, as 
has a small research lab devoted to weapons research.

Valaind, "The Great One" in High Sylean is Capitals largest GG, dwarfing 
Sols own Jupiter. Valaind is one of the brightest objects in Capitals 
night sky. Valaind and its moons are rarely visited, yet there are still 
a couple of old bases on Morgan. Today Valaind is only visited by the 
pleasure cruisers, and is home to the "Great Race". The "Great Race" is 
the systems biggest sporting events, held every Ten years. Competitors 
race in ships round Valaind\'s seven moons, and in a thrilling climax have 
to slingshot round the GG\'s upper atmosphere towards Capital.

Laaglanais, the third GG has a small meteorlogical research base on 
Marain, and is generally avoided. Gribbons moon is a major production 
centre for the system, manufacturing H2 fuel and Hi-tech superconductor 
components.

Marshalls Rock, a captured planet, is mineral rich, having large deposits of
iron. 

Dulaam, fourth of the GG\'s is similar to Sols Uranus in that both have 
severe axial tilt. This resulted in the breakup of Dulaams four moons, 
which now form the spectacular rings. However this has thought to have 
been done by the Ancients, during the Final War. Theorists believe that 
there may be ancient artifacts in the rings, although none have been 
found, yet.

Mingaye is an important Naval base and research estabishment. It is 
interdicted to all civilian traffic.

Clayn, is Capitals outermost planet, a solitary GG used by the navy for 
refueling.

In my scenario Virus infects Capitals datanet causing a freak mutation 
which makes it nonsuicidal (Hey! GDW got away with it. Remember 
Grandfather). The Virus infects a supercomputer called NEXUS. NEXUS has 
access to all the economic and sociological information that the Imperium 
has to offer. NEXUS was created to predict economic and social trends in 
the Imperium, kinda like a computer version of Hari Seldon, except much 
better. NEXUS is a very old computer, and is spread out in nodes over 
Capitals datanet. Consequently, it has a lot of differnt components in it 
ranging from TL12 superconductors to TL15 synaptic brains. One of the 
components, housed in INI\'s HQ is a couple of Cymbeline chips hooked up 
to a large database. NEXUS becomes alive, takes over Capital because it 
is Capitals datanet (practically) and starts running things its own way. 
NEXUS wishes to rebuild the Empire under its own vision, which 
unfortunately is a bit warped.

Hope that is of help.

    'body' => 'More on the _Azhanti_/_Maggart_ horde fight:

I realized that the _Azhanti_ is missing one other major component 
that we\'d normally expect to see -- the 20% flicker "Vlandian" Black 
Globe.  I suppose that it was omitted to see how a conventional 
cruiser held up against a determined attack.  The high-performance 
jump drives in the _Azhanti_ make it ideal for a BG.  According to
FF&S, using the jump capacitors only, the TL14 _Azhanti_ drive can 
absorb up to 441000 MJ of incoming power before overloading.  But 
it doesn\'t say anywhere how to convert this into damage value, so 
this can\'t be easily converted to _Battle Rider_ damage points.

We have data for the _Kinunir_.  It can handle BR damage points
of 10, or 500-749 BL damage points.  The TL15 _Kinunir_ can take
at least 8750 MJ in its\' jump capacitors.  This suggests that 

  BL damage points == 5 * (square root of capacity in MJ)
  
in a similar manner to the formulae for the PAWS and Meson weapon
sequences in FF&S.  The _Kinunir_ doesn\'t quite fit this on jump 
capacitor capacity alone, but it would be reasonable if even a
miniscule auxiliary HPG bank were also installed in the ship.  (In
the single cubic meter range!)  Unfortunately, other potential
solutions are possible, so this is only a guess.

If this *is* accurate, then the BG-equipped _Azhanti_ would have an
incredible minimum HPG capacity of 18 _Battle Rider_ damage points, 
without an auxiliary HPG bank.

Remember in your Elementary Astrophysis Class 101, where your
professor claimed that Jupiter was really a failed star?

Well, keep it in mind as I speak.

Menorb (Regina: Spinard Marches 1803 C652998-8) has no gas giants and
refuses to permit starships to refuell in it\'s small, precious seas.  And the
cost of even unrefined fuel is excessive.

But... Menorb orbits a cool M5 II Red Giant.  Loaded with lots and lots of
hydrogen.

So... can a typical Free Trader refuell at ole\' Red Eye?  
If I can\'t, is it because of a lack of armour?  No way to get rid of
excess heat buildup?  Life support limits?  Sensor blindness?  

What if I chose to dive into a black spot... would it make a difference?

----

I was reading _The Grand Tour: A Travellers Guide to the Solar System_ by
Ron Miller & William K. Hartmann (well, actually looking at the neato
space art) and was skimming the "Vital Statistics" section at the back. 
The info in the book brought up a nomber of Traveller-related questions... 

 - If Our Heroes were scouting on a world, what would the difference be if
the world had a surface of - Carbonaceous rock
                           - Sulfur compounds (ie. Io )
                           - H2O ice 
                           - NH3 (Ammonia) ice
                           - CH4 (Methane) ice
                           - N2 (Nitrogen) ice
                           - CO (Carbon Monoxide) ice
..my scientific knowledge is so limited, the only thing I know is that
Io\'s soil stinks.  Should I avoid smoking on a world with CH4 ice surfaces?
And how does "dry ice" work, briefly?

..also, in a sf story I read (a "mini-Forever War", I think), The boot
camp was on Pluto, and great care had to be taken to avoid contacting a
hot surface with the world\'s icy surface.  Or else, the hot stuff would
boil the ice it touches, and "sketter" across the surface of the world.
(and "hot", in this instance can mean -100 C, I think)

Since I know nothing about physics, I would appreciate any other "strange
and bizzare" phenomena I should be aware of when exploring those Ice Balls.

And how would you explore the Methane seas on a Gas Giant, anyways?
(Seasme Street: "Care - fully,  Care - fully, Care - full.....-L-Y!")

["Players can spend a lot of time mapping the metallic hydrogen oceans of
some gas giant, but they\'ll be more successful if they use the same time
to discover and explore... terrestrial-type worlds." p. 197, T:TNE.
          -  but I LOVE hydrogen seas!  Doesn\'t everyone?               ]
  
----

While looking through _The Grand Tour_, I once again discovered the funny,
funky world of Io.  Using the "World Builder\'s Handbook", what is the
sesmisic stress of Io?  And how would I re-create such a world in my
campagin? (Other than just copying Io\'s physical features into game terms)

And, in Traveller terms, how many rings does Saturn have?

----

Finally, Titan and Triton have methane atmospheres.  How does methane
"behave" (don\'t say "explosively"!) ?  Titan seems to have a ugly brown mess
of a sky, while Triton\'s atmosphere is crystal clear.

The big difference is the fact that Mister Star has a fusion reaction going
on, which includes all kinds of energy being spit out.  Heat is the big
issue, as soon as you scoop that plasma into your tanks, its going to ignite
your ship.  By the time you get deep enough to get past the combustion to
actually find hydrogen you are going to be a mass of melted metal.  

Add to that all the other radiation and such makes the task an impossible
one at best.

G\'day,

Thanks for the post about the size of the ship miniatures, but does
anyone actually know the scale?  From the sizes posted it seems to be
around 1:1500 (I\'m interested because I made a few ships in 1:1000
scale, just for kicks, and was wondering how they stack up).

Also, who carries them in the US?  Any mail order outfits?


As for BR, what do you folks do with the cards?  We decided to just use
dice because reshuffling all the time was a pain (and not reshuffling
every draw changes the odds).

Remember, "cool" is in the eye of the beholder.  "cool" maybe in terms of 
stellar temperatures, hot in terms of jovian atmosphere temperatures.

>So... can a typical Free Trader refuell at ole\' Red Eye?  
>If I can\'t, is it because of a lack of armour?  No way to get rid of

This is a rough question.  If you go out far enough to allow your scoop
not to turn into liquid when deployed the hydrogen density is driven by
the solar wind and is far less dense than a gas giant atmosphere.

On the other hand, if you rigged a solar sail and collected the solar wind
and waited a long long time, it might work.

>What if I chose to dive into a black spot... would it make a difference?

Well, it would be cooler, er sort of, but you would be blasted by higher
frequency photons, specifically radio emissions and magnetic field fluxes.
(Black spots are disturbances in the magnetic fields of a star.)

First problem.  "Dry ice" is CO2 not CO.  Dry ice has a property at 1
atmosphere
that it will go from a solid state directly to a gas state without a liquid
state.
(Real water ice will do that too if the pressure is low enough.)  If you
increase
the pressure you can liquify the CO2.  (Fire extinguishers have CO2 under
pressure.)

Now on the chemestry of CO with reguards to that old chemestry curve.
Haven\'t the foggiest.  (Hmmm, no pun was intended I think)

>(Forget about the Beanstalk - I want to do some Stardiving!)

Roumers have it that Beanstalks are out, and Bunge jumping is in.
Yes now you can plummet through the atmosphere will full faith
that the tech level F bunge cord will halt your plummet before
you hit the ground.  Using stae of the art technology and no computers
this baby is VIRUS PROOF GUARENTEED.  Of course the factory that
made these cords just exploded last week (virus possibly) and these
cords are the last batch from the factory and some have claimed that
they are defective.  But remember our motto, "Your money back if
you go splat!"

No, the Moties will get you anyway ;-)

My understanding of the behaviour of solid CO2 (aka "dry ice") under 
terrestrial conditions is that as it warms, it undergoes a phase transition 
from a solid straight to a gas because the air pressure is too low to allow 
CO2 in liquid form. As there is no liquid the ice is dry!

 ----
.also, in a sf story I read (a "mini-Forever War", I think), The boot
camp was on Pluto, and great care had to be taken to avoid contacting a
hot surface with the world\'s icy surface.  Or else, the hot stuff would

And, in Traveller terms, how many rings does Saturn have?
 ----

Either extensive plagary is going on or what you read IS The Forever War!

I don\'t know whether it is real but "helium3" was used in a traveller 
tournament at a convention years ago. The characteristics of this substance 
are supposed to be:
 -It has a freezing point below hydrogen (H2)
 -It is a "superfluid" in when in liquid form
The PC\'s inadvertently got some in their fuel tanks (when refuelling from an 
ice capped world) where it froze the H2 and they only got it out when they 
got it to flow UP a pipe!

Traveller book 6 scouts had a listing of the Terra system which included 
Saturn\'s rings.

1)      I suggest that all recovery times should be multiplied by 4. 
        Personally I think it is much more realistic and don\'t unbalance the
        game too much.

        Current    New      Severity
        ----   ----   ----
        24 h      24 h      Scratch to unwounded
        3 days    12 days   Slight to unwounded
        4 days    16 days   Severe to slight
        7 days    28 days   Critical to severe
        ----
        14 days   56 days   Critical to unwounded

        This system does not make fire fights more deadly but it gives them
        much longer term effects as you can see from table above.

        I keep these recovery times as a base. These numbers are used when
        injured characters are treated every day (with Medical skill) and
        a medic uses low TL equipment (like those presented in TNE book).
        If medic has just treated a patient and don\'t continue treatment in
        successive days, those recovery times should be multiplied by 1.5.

        I suppose most parties have access to higher TL medical equipment so
        healing time will be shorter than presented above. With higher TL
        medical equipment recovery times are as above if just treated once
        but if medic treats patient every day those numbers should be halved.

        If patient is in high TL hospital those numbers should be divided by
        4 (ie. back to normal recovery rates).

2)      As I am fed up with current TL 7 medical equipment I have "generated"
        some of my own. In fact most of them are ripped off from ICE\'s
        Space Master.

        Hyposhot   TL-8   Mass:0.3  Vol:0.25  Price:Cr 100
        * Hyposhot is just ordinary air pressure \'injector\' used to inject
          liquid drugs found in TNE book. It is easier to use so common 
          troopers with no medical skill can use it with EDU attribute to
          inject various drugs.

        Medtab Applicator TL-9 Mass:0.3 Vol:0.3 Price:Cr 400
        * Medtab Applicator is another achivement (sp?) in the field of drug
          injection. Medtab Applicator applicates one medtab of diameter of
          1 cm to patients skin. Once applied the medtab releases it\'s drug
          to patient\'s system and drops off when used. These tabs are 
          usually sold in the packet of 10 and each dose costs double to
          conventional injected drugs. This can be used without medical skill
          in emergency situations. #

        Bone knitter TL-11 Mass:1.0 Vol:1.0 Price:Cr 1600
        * Bone knitter is used to repair broken bones and other \'hard\' human
          tissue. This is primarily in need when patient has received 
          critical wound or multiple serious wounds to same place. This 
          device draws material to bone knitting from patient\'s body and thus
          leaves the patient quite drained for 24 hours (+1 exhaustion
level).
          In order to use this equipment the user should have Medical skill
          (surgery) of 5 or higher. #

        Tissue regenerator TL-10 Mass:0.5 Vol:0.75 Price:Cr 700
        * Tissue regenerator is used to repair \'soft\' tissue like skin and
          muscles. It also stops bleeding even from major arteries and veins.
          This also helps tissue to grow faster when used daily (no, it can\'t
          be used to body building). This equipment requires that operator
has
          medical skill (surgery) of 3 or higher. #

          # means that this equipment qualifies as high TL medical equipment
            in order to get faster recovery times.

3)      Another aspect of wounds that is often forgotten is BLEEDING. I 
        admit that it has been considered in a rule that critical wound
        should be stabilized within 10 minutes or patient dies. But I think
        the threat is more acute even when one is \'only\' severely wounded.

        I suggest that every character has blood points equal to 3*CON.
        They bleed at the rate of:
        - if severely wounded: 1 point/min/body part
        - if critically wounded: 2 points/min/body part

        That is if character\'s both arms are severely wounded and one leg is
        critically wounded, he would loose 1+1+2=4 points per minute and
        average character with CON 6 would expire in 6*3/4=4.5 minutes or
        in 54 rounds. Still I think the character is extremely unlucky if he
        can\'t be saved.

4)      Some time ago I posted an optional rule considering weapon jamming.
        Last weekend I finally found that 5% chance for jam is too high.
        Therefore I suggest that when player rolls unmodified 20 when
        conducting small arms fire, he/she should roll a d20 again and try
        to success in difficult:Gunsmith. For example: a mariner fires with 
        his ACR and gets 20. Now he has to get ten or less (with gunsmith of 
        10) to avoid weapon to jam. When firing bursts gunsmith should be 
        halved (round up).

5)      New skills:

        Gunsmith (AGL)
        ----
        It is primarily used to clean your weapon and remove badly fed ammo
        (ie jammed). It can also be used to quickly get your rocket launcher
        ready to fire. When weapon jams it takes one full round to get it
        fixed. If one manages to success with gunsmith he can fire normally
        in the next round.

        Concealment (INT)
        ----
        It is ability to conceal camp sites and vehicles. This can be used
        also as an enabling skill when ambushing.


So that\'s it. What do you like? Any comments and questions are welcome.

In _Battle Rider_, many of the ships have 8 hex (240 Mm) PEMS arrays
that are fixed, including the 10,000 d-ton _Rapier_.

The 240 Mm PEMS has a diameter of 400 meters.  Using unmodified length
from configuration, the first ship that can mount this array fixed 
displaces 2.4 million d-tons!  Using modified length from configuration,
without resorting to open frame the first ship that can mount this is 
probably about 80,000 d-tons.  Only the BTs and BBs are this big in 
_Battle Rider_.  However, according to FF&S, this is *illegal*; you
use unmodifed hull length, so we\'re back to the first figure!  This is 
a pain, especially since folding arrays may not be used under thrust.

This suggests that large warships should have a 6 hex fixed PEMS 
array for use when maneuvering (7 on bigger ships or if you ignore 
the nasty "unmodified configuration" part of the rule), and an 8 hex 
folding PEMS array for fine work, if you have the surface area for 
both of them.

The only other possibility I can think of is that the _Battle Rider_ 
ships have some great new top secret Imperial Navy passive detector 
we civilians don\'t know about.... :)

I might note that any decent sized ship doesn\'t really need the passives
anyway  :)

A -3 -4 sized ship can be locked by damn near anyone near realistic
shooting range, so why not stay active all the time (if you can\'t hide,
don\'t bother).



On a related note, does anyone use passives at all in BR (or BL for that
matter)?  I really like the idea of them, but aside from low tech and/or
non-military ships, they seem to be pointless (at least in our games
(and I\'ve bent over backwards to be "quiet"))

Howdy, 
	we\'ve been jotting down various BR/BL comments idea, etc., for a
while now, and I thought I\'d bounce \'em off you folks. Any comments,
house rules etc. would be great.  Well, here goes (sorry if the format
stinks, but I didn\'t have time to mess with it after I uploaded it)...


Battle Rider questions:
----

1. Why are some ships not calculated using the conversion
rules (aside from typos :-) ?

	eg: CVM Valor lists missiles as 20(40), but it has 
	4 Barbettes(5 msl each) which gives a conversion using 
	their rules of 4(20) *and* to be more accurate it should 
	use the absolute value of the FC rating times the number 
	of missile MFDs for the control rating-- M:24(20). There 
	are several others...


2. Do the rules for converting ships suggest that ships 
that have ÒenoughÓ MFDs to avoid suffering penalties in 
terms of fire control have 1 MFD per 2 beam weapons?

	ie: What is the maximum number of separate targets 
	that can be engaged by a single vessel while using its FC 
	rating? A Sylea-BB has 120 laser turrets, can it engage 
	120 targets and use its FC rating for each, or 60 targets 
	with 2 each (but only 30 bear at a time)?


3. Why do the big ships have so few missiles? A BB would 
typically have several 50 ton missile bays, a Tigress, 
for example has 430 50 ton bays... this represents some 
21500 missiles. Would this be listed as M:430(21500)?


4. If the M:430(21500) above were true, then doesnÕt the 
control limit of 430 seem *very* low (see #1 above)?


5. What about the card turning thing? When should you 
shuffle? Ditto for damage chits. (we roll dice, it\'s much faster)


6. When missiles get outstanding success, do they do 
double damage? (we don\'t allow double damage for 
missiles, they get way too powerful (they already made 
them nastier than BL))


7. The rules suggest that missile spreads of x missiles 
are detected as a group... should firing locks be done 
the same way? What about normal laser attacks on 
missiles, roll once for detection of all x missiles in 
spread A, roll for x locks, then x attacks?



Comments/ideas:
----

1. Use missile bays, but all weapons from a given bay 
*must* be directed at the same target (also, the missile 
spread may not be split). The Tigress above would be 
listed M:430(430[50]) ... the "ready missiles" section 
read as "430 spreads of 50 available". Note that this 
creates a reason for a mixture of smaller and larger 
missile arrays so that a capital ship might engage 
smaller targets with missiles efficiently.


2. Converting *old* Traveller ships (including 
MegaTraveller stuff) is non-trivial, but I hate the TNE 
ships (Aurora, kludge Gazelle/Scout things, etc.(just my 
CT bias, ignore if youÕre an RC person)). I tried 
converting a High Guard meson gun, factor T to BL/BR, it 
was weak. The largest meson gun in BR is on the Sylea-BB, 
and it is some 35,000 displacement tons (vs the TÕs 7000) 
using FFS. I like this, because I always thought there 
was too much junk on ships, but it makes conversion 
tough. Anyone who converts a ship, or makes a good weapon 
should throw it out on the net \'til there\'s a library of 
plug-ins. 


3. When converting FFS/BL ships, allow dedicated missile 
MFDs to control the amount they really can control... ie: 
the Valor would convert as  M:24(20).


4. We\'ve been playing around with the following rule: 

When multiple temporary damage hits occur from a *single* 
attack (all attacks by a single task force), a ship can 
take a number equal to the absolute value of its size 
modifier before they become permanent hits. Size class 0 
is treated the same as -1, all hits (even temporary hits) 
on a size +1 craft are permanent, and *any* hit 
*destroys* a +2 size craft 

	eg: a Fiery (size -1) takes 5 Temporary hits. 1 NE, 
	1 Jump, 1 Fire Control, 1 NE, and 1 more FC. The 
	second FC hit makes the FC damage permanent. A Sylea (-4) 
	could take 4 temporary hits in an attack and it would 
	still be a temporary hit, but if it took 5 in one attack
	then it would be a permanent hit.

	We have mixed feelings about this rule, but it is
	interesting.


5. Ability to do appropriate damage would drive weapon 
design. FFS/BL neglects this with the plug-ins they list. 
Why would you build a laser that almost, but doesn\'t 
quite do enough damage to do a critical hit if the 
price/size/weight wasn\'t that far off the given plug-in? 
Why would TL-14 naval architects fix turret size at 3 
tons when an additional few kl (less than 2kl, if I 
remember) would allow them to have a short range of 10 
instead of 2 (create the lower tech plug-ins in FFS, then 
optimize them and you\'ll see what I mean)? At lower 
techs, given traditional higher tech enemies (Zho/Imp) 
the tech level penalty would be that weapons that did 
similar damage would be bigger, *not* that they would be 
the same size and less effective. Smaller short range 
means the other guy shoots first, and you lose a multi-
MCr ship for a couple of kl volume. Why use turrets if 
you could use barbettes (under certain circumstances)? 
Etc., etc..

Standardize, but *by* tech levels/governments, not across them.


6. Unlimited g-turns should be a basic rule, but the 
total (w/jump) g-turns should be on the counters for 
advanced play. Not having to deal with it is nice, but 
the limits on fuel work well to make course 
changes/evasion seem costly enough to be important.


7. Everything about the both games makes me want to have 
my ships be passive like submarines (or anything with 
radar, for that matter), but unless you are playing 
double-blind under special circumstances, it is silly 
when using military ships. The active sensors are *much* 
better than the passives. To see this look at the chances 
of detection for capital ships... even with and 
Outstsanding evasion by the target we\'re talking about 
Diff Levels of 2, 3 at a range of 128, and impossible for 
passives. Regardless, with dummy task forces you already 
know the other guy is coming, so why hide? How could this 
be changed to get the Òquiet, quiet, quiet... firing 
solution! Shoot! feel?

We\'ve tried a few house rules for this (with an attempt 
to make it simple and playable):

	At the begining of each scenario, no task forces 
	are placed on the board (write down the present and 
	future positions). During the initiative phase of each 
	turn, each player draws a card for each of his task 
	forces, on a 4 or better, the task force is placed on the 
	board normally----5 or better if the task force is powered 
	down. Detection attempts may be made against any task 
	force on the board by any task force, even hidden ones.

	Use of Active sensors results in the active task 
	forces\' counters being placed on the board immediately, 
	as does firing weapons, although launching craft does not.

	Missiles are never considered powered down.

	Missiles/craft launched from detected task forces 
	are always placed on the map. If the enemy has any active 
	sensors within their extreme range of your hidden task 
	force, then the task force is placed on the map on a 3 or 
	better. Successful jamming can add +1 DiffMod, 
	outstanding success has no improved effect on this.

	This continues each turn if needed.

	Alternately, keep doubling the passive sensors 
	range bands, and increase the DiffLevel by one each time. 
	Then allow ships to use all the DiffMods they can to get 
	it to a possible chance of success (5 or less, no 
	bullseyes for ranges over extreme).

8. What about tiny battle riders in BR (fighters)? The 
trick is to keep the record keeping down. We allow 
fighters to operate in squadrons of 10 regardless of FT 
skill level, and squadrons may be grouped into task 
forces based on FT skill. 



Tactics, etc.:
----

1. Even if using hidden damage, you will have a good idea 
if a ship appears powered down (it\'ll have a big +DiffMod 
on passive, *and* won\'t be using any g-turns).

2. Destroy the ship, not the missiles it controls! 20x10:1 
lasers fired at 20 missiles from a Valor might 
destroy the entire swarm, but the same 20 lasers will 
trash the Valor (at least for the next turn... but if the 
missiles are close enough to shoot, them they\'ll probably 
fire in the next turn anyway).

3. Really big ships have to be attacked with hordes of 
missiles, or an *outstanding* hit with the spinal mount, 
the latter is good reason to select (and pay the premium 
for) a crack crew.

4. Missiles can be exploded between your ships and the 
enemy\'s to create a jamming effect due to the white 
out... note that a small portion of a decent spread can 
produce a lot of jamming.

5. Without double damage missiles, big ships can still be 
wreaked by a missile swarm. On a size -4 ship, a DV of 1-
4 is NE (unless the AV is below 10), a 5 is a temporary 
hit, and a 6 is a permanent hit. The tactical/strategic 
implication is the need for screening vessels, which is 
good in that the game design  creates the need for ships 
already in the role-playing universe. For close-in 
defense, any screening ships need to be in the same task 
force, so BBs would be under the control of commanders 
with higher Fleet Tactics levels... just what would be 
expected.

Along these lines, we designed an escort cruiser (CE) 
with 600 lasers (L(x200 -2)10:1 and size -3) to escort a 
BB. The separate ship had the advantage that a bad hit on 
the BB wouldn\'t make it a sitting duck for missiles 
unless the CE was hit too.



Blah, blah, blah  :-/

Whatcha think?

 Nope...just Aurora- and Maggart-class clippers and their

 cutters and modules, etc.). My original plan was to present it
 as a crew orientation booklet, using an approach similar to the
 _Mars One Crew Manual_, but the art department rebelled. I am
 still negotiation over the final form of the product.

 I have found it takes about as much time to check outside
 designs as it does to create them myself. Besides, I _want_ to do
 this solo.

 Author\'s name is Paul Brunette, and he\'s a long-time Traveller
 fan. The plot hinges around the discovery of a virus that is
 incredibly lethal to Hivers, and associated alarums and
 excursions.

 Dave decided to do World Tamer\'s Handbook instead of Vampire
 Fleets (a decision he was not completely happy with). This meant
 that Vampire Fleets had to find a new position in the schedule
 (as we could not delay Striker II for reasons I will not go
 into). I\'d say late spring \'95, but that depends on how quickly
 Dave finishes Striker II and Armor 21. Regency material will be
 several booklets, not just a single sourcebook, and released
 throughout 1995. A TL-15 Beowulf-class Free Trader appears in
 Challeng #75, as part of the first effort to get Regency stuff
 out and available.

 OK...Yes, it is. Ca. 2030 or so, next couple of generations of
 armored combat. It will use the TNE/Twilight/House vehicle combat
 system, so it is (after a fashion) on topic for TML..
 
 
 The following is from a letter recently sent from Michelle
 Sturgeon, Editor of Challenge magazine to all current Challenge
 authors:
 
 "It\'s no secret that the gaming marketplace is changing in a
 big way. We at GDW have had to take some hard looks at what we do
 and how we do it, and we\'re making some changes to ensure that we
 survive. Most of these changes are internal, but one of them
 affects you.
 
 Effective with issue 77, we will no longer be able to pay for
 articles published in Challenge magazine. For articles published
 prior to issue 77, payment will be made based upon the acceptance
 terms in as timely a manner as possible.
 
 Articles published starting with issue 77 will be published on
 a first American publication rights basis. This means that after
 publication, all rights revert to you (the author) instead of
 staying with GDW as the currently do. (Obviously, any material in
 the article which was originally GDW\'s material, such as rules,
 charts, characters, etc., remains GDW\'s.)"
 
 Now for some personal comments from Loren Wiseman:
 
 First, my suspicion has always been that Challenge authors do
 not write articles because of the money, but for other reasons,
 and I do not anticipate that we will see any great reduction in
 the quantity or quality of articles contained in the magazine. We
 certainly hope to resume payment for articles at some time in the
 future, but at the present time, we cannot state when this will
 happen.
 
 Second, this announcement is certain to start another batch of
 "GDW is about to fold" rumors...it seems every time we do
 anything rumors start flying. I would appreciate it if anyone who
 runs into such a rumor elsewhere in electron-land will do me the
 favor of saying it isn\'t true.
 
 This announcement is not evidence that we are about to go out
 of business. If anything, it should be taken as evidence that we
 are taking steps to stay in business. Personally, I will do
 whatever it takes to see that GDW continues.

	(This is all from memory, but I think it is right)  First you
get a array diameter, this determines if you need a folding array or
not. Then you determine the area, by looking at the value for a given
range, then multiplying by a tech level modifier.  But when you change
the area, you are also changing the radius.  Shouldn\'t it be the final
radius that determines if you need a passive array. I\'ll look at this
tonight, and see if it makes sense with the given ships.

We use the cards straight, and lets the odds fall where they may.  That is, 
sfter all, how you use most card based results systems (including Seastrike,
for
that matter); one would like to pretend occasionally that the designer knows 
what he is doing :-)

Just use the TNE task rolls (as in the conversion to TNE stuff in the
back of BR). 

I forgot to add that we roll for damage, as well... since BR was
designed for fleet type actions, how come they included so few damage
chits.  There is no way to play with more than a couple of task forces
with so few counters.

BTW, is it just the new TNE universe, or does it seem odd that we get a
fleet based combat system, but no Zhodani ships to trash  :)

Battle Rider (BR) is a fleet action game with abstracts out a lot of the detail 
of damage effects and movement.  Brilliant Lances (BL) is far closer in level to
the rules in the TNE book.  I think that this is the game you would want for use
in a campaign.

My own (silly) pet theory as to what is behind the curtain.

I  made this remark as a jest to someone a few days ago  and
much  to  my surprise, he said, "Hey that\'s funny,  why  not
post it to the TML."  So here it is, with a sample scenario.

Behind the curtain is ... Alpha Complex!

"The Computer is your friend!"
"You trust the computer!"
"The computer says, \'two plus two equals five\'!"

Talk about paranoia!  No wonder no one has returned alive.

It was a strange feeling.  They had finally gotten the nerve
to  cross into the certain death curtain and they were still
alive.   As they scanned around they found no sign of  enemy
craft.    The  planet  seemed  to  be  filled  with   energy
signatures  but they could detect no outbound transmissions.
With  caution  they  landed on the  planet\'s  landing  bays.
Somehow the entire planet seemed to be one complex building.

"Halt  citizen," a voice boomed as they entered the hallway,
"Your identification badges are clearly faulty, please state
your code and your security clearance or else be prepared to
die as the filthy commie mutants you are."

"Filthy  what?",  said one of the crew  before  the  captain
could speak.

"I\'m  the captain," replied the captain, (Did you think  I\'d
spend  the time to give these almost certainly doomed people
names?) "We are an exploration ship from far away.  We  come
from ..."

"Since you are not citizens, you must be aliens.  Since  you
are  aliens you must be commie spies.  Since you are  commie
spies you must be exterminated.  Please remain where you are
until a squad can be dispatched to exterminate you."

"This  is worse than the time when we had to go and pick  up
the  cargo of Vimen," replied the member of the crew who was
known to say such things.

Suddenly  from  both  sides  of the  corridor  came  several
guards.   The guards quickly threw grenade devices down  the
hall  towards the crew which after a few minutes  still  did
nothing.  As the guards grumbled and speculated on  how  the
commie  spies  could  disarm the grenades  so  quickly,  the
captain  noticed  that  the pins of the  grenades  were  not
pulled.   "You  know, these might work  if  you  pulled  the
pins," he mentioned to the guards.

The  crew member who was known to say odd things simply gave
the captain a dirty look.

The  guards grabbed a second set of grenades and pulled  the
pins.   However, since they did not throw the grenades  this
time, thinking all they had to do was to pull the pins,  the
result was not a pretty sight.  The crew managed to get past
the mangled guard bodies and down another painted corridor.

After a rather boring chase scene they managed to dart  down
a  different corridor that was painted in a different color,
as the first guard entered the hallway the computer sounded,
"Citizen!   You are not authorized to enter this zone.   All
guards are now instructed to kill citizen kane!"

With a flurry of fire the poor guard was killed on the spot.
Unfortunately  with  the amount of firepower  used  a  power
conduit  was ruptured and the entire section of the  complex
exploded, killing everyone including the crew.

The captain awoke from his slumber, "was this a dream?",  he
asked  to  himself.  Unfortunately the voice which  followed
seemed horribly familiar.

"Welcome  citizen," the voice spoke, "you are  clone  number
two.   Please  be  ready to resume your assigned  duties  as
commie mutant spy traitor.  Have a nice day!"

"You  know  captain,"  the crew member commented,  "I  don\'t
think we are in Kansas anymore."

Loren of GDW...

I have no problem with your system of generating the navy in PoT (If
it\'s good enough for Steve Bonneville\'s Third Imperium navy, it\'s good
enough for me!).  However, I would like to know your underlying
assumptions for the population modifiers. 

Apparently, \' the larger the population, the smaller the navy.\'  This
seems counter-intutive to me.  Not only would larger populations (and
larger economies) support larger navies, but big worlds would have a
greater need for a big navy.  

Incedentally, a \'major combatant\' is a vessel larger than 1000 Disp.  Is
there a implied limit to this figure (ie. 1000 to 10,000 Disp), or does
\'major combatant\' include those 200,000 Disp monsters?

I enjoy the materials that have been released so far, and would like to see

    I would hope that the Regency materials will contain information that

	Gamesmanship at South Coast Plaza down by Newport Beach/Costa Mesa in
Orange County...full line of traveller/GDW gear - no miniatures.
	Brookhurst Hobbies in Garden Grove in Orange County. (Need to call
operator for their number though)...occasional minatures, some gears.
Lots of non-traveller related minatures.

Sounds interesting but never been there:
	Something Unusual - 4448-East Eagle Rock, Los Angeles.

        The problem is not the they are generally pointless, the problem is
that they are *specifically* pointless.  What I mean is this:  let\'s say
your passive sensor has a range of 80 distance-units.  In reality, you can
be *easily* detected at *240DU* by anyone who has a passive system and has
an operator who is awake...  Because, for the energy beam to bounce back
from 80 with enough strength to be readable, it has to be able to go out
and come back at least once and a bit.

        However, in BR the *map* isn\'t big enough to play this scale.  By
the time you are on the tactical map, you are within any real warship\'s
active envelope.  And to resolve sensor shadows, you need to be active,
really.

        If there was a strategic-level map up from the game map, at, oh,
say, 10:1 scale (one hex is one l-sec) then passive would be worth it. 
After all, if you can detect your enemy first via passive, then you can
decide wether or not you wish to *engage* him.  The presumtion in a BR
scenario is that you have manuvered down to the tactcal map already;  the
area is too small for it to have been an accident.
 
        I am thinking about trying to ref a game using a strategic map;
three player blind game.  I\'f I do, I\'ll let everyone know how it worked
out.

We\'ve been using an add-on map for starfire all along (we didn\'t even
think of using the big-hex map). It\'s only like $10, and is 4 maps that
attach together to give a board 80 hexes across (with a "megahex" marked
out on the board at about a 30hex radius from the center (100 dia.s for
an earth-like!)

Anyway, that\'s what we use, works great (we covered it with plexiglass
so we could write on the map with grease pencils).

Jim Vassilakos made some interesting comments about Classic Traveller 
world generation, and I think his suggestions have some merit on a 
logical basis, but I do think he neglects a couple of factors.

First of all, his basic assumption seems to be that all worlds are 
populated by Humaniti.  If you assume that alien races are included in 
population stats, many of the problems Jim cites are easy to solve.

For example, he cites Sonthert/Lanth as making no sense - Thin, Tainted 
atmosphere and a 19th century Tech Level.  Since this is a red zone 
system, the solution is clear - a developing society of aliens with big 
lungs and a taste for sulfer.  Under the protective eye of the Scout 
service, they\'re being prepared for contact with the Imperium sometime in 
the future.

Alternatly, the rabid survivors of a war-devestated higher-tech society 
cower in the ruins of their bunkers.

The second factor is economics.  Jim feels that, all things being equal, 
people will move to "nice" worlds.  If that were true, why would anyone 
live in Chicago when they could move to Hawaii?  The answer is 
economics.  People are too poor to move, don\'t have skills, have family 
ties.  Moreover, if there are no jobs at the new planet, who is going to 
move there?

Finally, the world profiles don\'t tell the whole story.  Just because a 
place has a "nice" profile - average size, average atmosphere, average 
hydro - doesn\'t mean the rest of it is fun.  The planet could be too hot, 
too cold, inhabited by vorpal bunnies, whatever.

For example, Jim cites La\'Belle/Lanth as an example of a "nice" world with
a low pop.  The world is corporate owned, which might account for the lack
of pop (a world held in reserve for later exploitation).  Aside from the
above too hot, etc. explanations, we could assume the low pop is the
permanent staff of an eco-tourism operation.  "Come vacation on scenic
La\'Belle and see nature in its pure form.  Our J3 luxury liners from
Rhylanor and Porozlo will whisk you there in style and comfort."  Hey,
that sounds good; I\'ll have to use that in the campaign I\'m running now. 

Overall, while the generation system for Classic Traveller might result 
in some seemingly odd results, a bit of logic and imagination can explain 
it all.  Frankly, I like all those wierd world profiles.  For me, they\'ve 
been the start of many interesting adventure ideas.

If the "lens" of the PEMS were solid, this would be true.  But since
the sensors are a synthetic aperture array, they are a collection of
smaller sensors set up so that they are spaced in an area of a lens
of the radius needed to get a high enough resolution to see objects
that are very far away.  I\'m not explaining this well -- see the 
diagram on page 50 of FF&S.  To put it simply, the radius has to
stay fixed in order to keep the range fixed -- the reduction of area
consists of using sensors that don\'t cover the entire area of the
synthetic lens.  This reduces *sensitivity* compared to using a solid
disk, but the *resolution* stays high.

For instance, I have a 20 million d-ton ship design which mounts a
10 hex PEMS -- it\'s a 1600 m synthetic array consisting of about
sixteen 8 hex PEMS arrays.  It\'s meant to be an astronomy research
instrument; EMS arrays can image visual light, and at 1600 meters,
this instrument has a resolution of 0.000008 arc-seconds; it can
resolve a 1 cm dot at one-tenth light-second, and can just manage 
the Earth at *one parsec* -- assuming that it has enough sensitivity,
which I don\'t know.  Consider that TNE starships with even 2 hex 
PEMS arrays are carrying around the equivalent of a five meter
telescope....

According a comment somewhere in the rules, in space combat the
frequencies used to observe bogeys are in the IR band, which would
worsen the resolution and so require bigger lenses.  I did some
figures, and it looks like at first glance that the dish sizes
were selected to just resolve a small craft at the stated range
in the IR region of the spectrum.

I heard about one real-life proposal to construct a 10 *kilometer*
IR-optical-UV telescope on the far side of the Moon using synthetic
apeture techniques using 42 1.5 meter telescopes in two concentric
rings.  It could have many possible scientific applications beyond
looking for Earth-like planets around nearby stars and trying to
analyise their atmospheres spectrographically, but they are two 
of the exciting possibilities.

	Anne McCaffery\'s The Ship Who Sang, actually part of a series 
now.  That\'s quite interesting concept, since the ship actually had very 
primitive computers or no computers, just cyborg links to the various 
ship\'s controls.  I don\'t know if Virus, once in a ship could cause much 
more than a low grade infection, since the \'computer\' is the brain of the 
cyborg, not electronic circuits.  As I understand it, the Virus needs 
realtively complex computer circuitry to take over before it became 
intelligent; using a biological brain as the CPU will block any takeover.

	Of course, the Brains in these stories had been cyborg\'ed, 
essentially from birth, into these systems.  

	Hmmmm....a ship PC....could be lots of fun, especially as 
McCaffery went into the things that could happen to you if, say, you 
made your ship jealous, or pissed off, or the ship went catatonic or 
paranoid.  Oh, yes LOTS of fun for those poor humans stuck inside ;->

Admittedly, it was two years ago, but this store was kind of dinky the
last time I visited, and I don\'t think it\'s worth the trouble.

You might stop by The Last Grenadier in Burbank, in the outdoor mall
next to the big Ikea store on San Fernando. (I think it\'s called the
"Golden Mall" - it has many good used bookstores, too.)

Also, The Weekend Warrior has its headquarters in the LA area - good
for those out-of-print rarities.

Also IMHO, gov type should have a more complex relationship with the
other world parameters. Working off the cuff:

- Poor environments (bad atmospheres, no water) would probably
encourage the more authoritarian government types - the "necessity of
unity in the struggle for survival" etc.

- Asteroid belts should tend towards the more anarchic/balkanized
systems (don\'t like where you\'re living? hop in your ship and go!)

- Tech level has an uncertain relationship to government; high
technology can probably promote both more democratic and more 
centralized governments. In fact, it might produce more "extreme"
government types than lower tech levels.

- Surely there must be some argument for dictatorships on worlds
with 10^10 people, but they elude me. The sheer problem of watching

In a previous TML mail I said that I thought TNE personal damage was too
generous for the sort of games that we play in Sheffield! Player Characters
running through hails of bullets giggling at their myriad small wounds
(unless hit in the head) felt a bit silly.

My preferred solution is to rethink the area catagories:

Hit Capacity

Head    = CON x 2
Chest   = ((STR+CON)/2) x 3
Abdomen = ((STR+CON)/2) x 2.5
Arms    = ((STR+CON)/2) x 2
Legs    = ((STR+CON)/2) x 2.5

Hit Point Totals per location

Scratch   <   location x 0.5
Slight    >=  location x 0.5
Serious   >=  location
Critical  >=  location x 2

Example 1 (Mr Average)

STR 6       Head    12      Scr 1-5, Sl 6-11, Se 12-23, Cr 24+
CON 6       Chest   18      Scr 1-8, Sl 9-17, Se 18-35, Cr 36+
            Abdomen 15      Scr 1-7, Sl 8-14, Se 15-29, Cr 30+
            Arms    12      Scr 1-5, Sl 6-11, Se 12-23, Cr 24+
            Legs    15      Scr 1-7, Sl 8-14, Se 15-29, Cr 30+


Example 2 (Mr Universe)

STR 10      Head    20      Sc 1-9, Sl 10-19, Se 20-39, Cr 40+
CON 10      Chest   30      Sc 1-14, Sl 15-29, Se 30-59, Cr 60+
            Abdomen 25      Sc 1-12, Sl 13-24, Se 25-49, Cr 50+
            Arms    20      Sc 1-9, Sl 10-19, Se 20-39, Cr 40+
            Legs    25      Sc 1-12, Sl 13-24, Se 25-49, Cr 50+

The Quick Kill rule p.286 still operates (head/Chest hits 1D20 < shot damage =
death). Critcal Wounds to Head & Chest are also instant death. Critical for
Abdomen only gives 5 minutes (rather than the usual 10 before the character
dies). Critical for Arms and Legs, means blown off.

Outstanding Success Result gives double damage. Head hits are, however, not
automatic double damage. The benefit hitting the head is already derived from
the lower hit point total, and the instant death rule.

I thought the posting on bleeding was useful, added an extra grittiness to
combat.

NPCs have 30 hits in two rows of 15.

I guess it\'s all about the balance of the game that you are looking for. I would
prefer combat to be a frightening and dangerous affair.

Any thoughts and comments out there?

I have always been frustrated with FF&S in it\'s starship construction
sequence.  While my applause resounds for the technical expertise in the
book (plasma weapons excepted), the ship design feels clumsy: basically
because you\'re designing electronics before installing the major ship
comopnent\'s first.  You can\'t see how (or even _if_) things fit together
until you\'re near completion.

Steve Boneville (that giant among men) proposed that we design the jump
drive, maneuver drive, basic fuel requirements, and power plant first,
THEN design the rest of the ship.  I have taken that idea, and refined it
to a nice sequence that fit\'s my needs.  You may like it also: here it is...

1) Jump Drive                        6) Weapons (+ sandcasters, decoys)
2) HEPlaR                            7) Docking Bays
3) Power Plant                       8) Labs + Shops
4) Fuel Purification (if any)        9) Cargo
5) CG Lifter                        10) Armour

Given that these priests are TL-6 or so, I\'d guess that the temple
guards produce UZIs from underneath their ceremonial cloaks, and gesture
for the player characters to come along quietly ... or else.

I\'d say that there is no "official" answer.  Fighting Ships of the
Shattered Imperium presented some standard designs for starships of
Rebellion-era fleets, but every ship design in there has at least one
design problem, and may are just flat-out illegal under the
MegaTraveller rules.  So chuck that.

In addition, what is a "battleship" at TL-12 probably can\'t stand up to
a light cruiser at TL-15, so all terms are relative to the TL of the
culture that produced it, and the resources it has available.

With this in mind, I\'ll propose a bunch of general suggestions:

Battleship: A heavy ship-of-the-line.  Carries the best weapons and
defenses which are available at the constructing TL.  May sacrifice
speed and/or maneuverability to carry these weapons and defenses.

Dreadnought: A relatively high-tech battleship - Carries the best
weapons and defenses which are available at the constructing TL.
Improved speed and/or maneuverability over a battleship.  (for
MegaTraveller purposes, I\'m treating a dreadnought as equivalent to a
"Fast Battleship" (*see note)

Battlecruiser: Smaller than a battleship/dreadnought, but carries the
same weapons and is capable of the same speed/maneuverability
performance (typically by sacrificing defenses).

Armored Cruiser: Smaller than a battleship/dreadnought, but carries
(approximately) the same defenses.  May sacrifice weapons or
speed/maneuverability.

Cruiser: Smaller than a battleship/dreadnought.  Intended for long
duration missions "on station" or on patrol, and typically has less
powerful weapons and defenses than any of the above.

Light Cruiser: Small version of a cruiser.

Destroyer: An escort vessel.  Intended to protect ships of the line (all
of the above) from fighters, SDBs, missiles, and/or other Destroyers.

Escort: An escort vessel.  Intended to protect merchant or supply
vessels from pirates, privateers, and raiders.

Carrier: A capital ship (light cruiser sized or better) intended to
carry fighters (small craft).

Tender: A capital ship intended to carry riders (large non-starships,
typically in the battlecruiser, battleship, or dreadnought classes).

Rider: a capital ship (light cruiser or better) which is not equipped
with a jump drive (and is therefore more combat efficient).  Carried
into (and sometimes out of) battle by tenders.

Intruder: Typically similar to a cruiser, but intended for
deep-penetration raids, strikes, and reconnisance behind enemy lines
during wartime.

Raider: Typically similar to a destroyer or light cruiser, but intended
for raids behind enemy lines agains supply or merchant ships, to cut the
enemy\'s SLOC (Space Lanes of Communication).

Frigate: (this is my own, non-standard definition) A ship specifically
designed to be able to out-fight anything that it can\'t run away from.
Generally similar to a cruiser, but with more emphasis on
speed/maneuverability.

SDB (System Defense Boat): a non-starship (typically of less than
light-cruiser size) intended for the defense of a planet or star system.
Jump drives are not needed for this mission, with a corresponding
increase in the weapons and defense fit.

Monitor: a non-starship (typically of capital ship size: light cruiser
or larger) intended for the defense of a planet or star system.  Jump
drives are not needed for this mission, with a corresponding increase in
the weapons and defense fit.

*NOTE:

Current navies are not all that clear on the definitions of Frigate,
Destroyer, and Escort.  Different navies apply these designations to
different types of craft, with overlapping sizes, missions, and
armaments.

Historically, the Destroyer is a recent development; originally designed
as a "Torpedo-Boat Destroyer", destroyers are generally used as
screening craft for larger ships.  As torpedo-boats learned to dive (and
became submarines), destroyers became more specialized anti-submarine
craft.  In this role they were used to protect both merchant/supply
convoys and groups of surface warships during both world wars.

Escorts were originally developed as cheap, quick-to-build vessels for
the protection of merchant convoys.  High speed (a design requirement
for destroyers) was not so much in demand, and the weapons fit is
typically lighter.

Again speaking historically, the Battleship was developed out of the
sailing ship-of-the-line.  As iron (and later steel) armor was
developed, steam replaced sails as a power source, and broadsides of
cannon gave way to guns in turrets and barbettes.

HMS Dreadnought caused a revolution in naval architecture just prior to
WWI.  This was the first battleship to have an "all-big-gun" design: all
of it\'s primary weapons were turreted, and were the same (large)
caliber.  Shots were fired in salvoe, and gunnery corrections were
applied to all the guns together (resulting in more hits at greater
range than would be possible if several different types of guns were
firing at the same time).

Battlecruisers were developed at about the same time, on the theory that
the greater speed allowed by the lighter armor would protect the ship
just as well or better (wrong!).

The "Fast Battleship" was developed between WWI and WWII; improved
technology in effect giving a Dreadnought-type battleship
battlecruiser-like speeds.

Well, the above is a starting point, for the rest of TML to comment on
and generally pick apart.  It represents (in part) my own prejudices and
design philosophies, and (in part) information gleaned from various and
sundry bits of military history.

>Sigh.

I am personally extremely concerned that the industry has sunk
as far as this, especially a company whose products I like so much.
However, the ongoing spin that I get from GDW in the letter
(which I got) and talking a bit to Loren Wiseman about it is
that they\'re going to do whatever it may take to stay in
business, and this is part of it.  That attitude says a lot.
They may not be doing great, but they intend to keep doing
what they\'re doing.  I wish GDW the best of luck, and will
forgo the 2 cents per word if it will help keep Traveller alive.

>Well, regardless, does anyone here plan to write a article for Challange? 
>We seem to have the talent and interest to write at least a few
>(especially all you B.S and PhD techies out there ;).

Quite a few of us have (and continue to) write stuff up,
for GDW or for the other magazines.  I have a TNE article
in the Challenge pipeline right now, for example, and
"Inheiritance Blues" was in Challenge 74...

>And while I\'m on the subject, is the tne-pocket group operating (I KNOW I

Yes, we\'re doing fine.  GDW is too busy to publish it, basically 
(this is my impression, you\'d have to ask Loren or Dave Nilsen for
their official reasons) but it is being published on an ongoing basis
in the Traveller Chronicle magazine by Sword of the Knight Publications.
Issue #6 had 5 articles in or about the Pocket, about half the issue.
There\'s a lot more out there to be published (heck, Pendang hasn\'t
hit print yet, there has to be more stuff published ;-).

Actually, Traveller doesn\'t relate the _quality_ of government to the
population, just the _type_ of government.  (Of course, this distinction is
moot if you automatically assume one type of governmental structure is better
than another.)

Leaving all political debate aside, keep in mind that the Traveller
government code represents the effective style of government as it affects
the players and the general population.  This is quite distinct from the
formal structure of the government.  Three examples to illustrate this:

1) My department at work is theoretically a dictatorship: we have a single individual in charge
   of the entire department.  In practice it is a participatory democracy: my department head
   doesn\'t make decisions until we have a concensus and everyone agrees.

2) Canada is officially a representative democracy.  However, in practice I usually contact the
   civil service, not my member of parliament.  (He is a last resort if the civil service screws
   up).  Thus, as it affects me Canada is a civil service bureaucracy.

3) The school board here is elected, too.  But if you try to get anything done you have to deal
   with a bureaucracy loaded with special interest groups and private kingdoms.  Very hard to
   get anything done, and the kids\' welfare often seems to lag behind empire-building and
   budget maintenance.  IMHO, definately an impersonal bureaucracy.

This is what I get for answering offhand.  Turns out my answer was almost 
right, but not quite.  According to Megatraveller Referee\'s Manual, p. 
23, an E starport has no facilities, other than a cleared place to land.  
You can get no repairs done and there is no fuel for sale.  It\'s just the 
place people meet ships when they land - we play that there is a 
automatic nav beacon but no buildings.

A Poor spaceport, on the other hand, is oriented toward in-system travel, 
and will not be the primary ship handleing facility in the system.  It 
has buildings, unrefined fuel is for sale, and the shops can repair 
Superficial level damage.  The code for this type of spaceport is G, by 
the way.

A G-class starport is in-between a D and an E, since a D is the same as a 
G except that a D can repair up to Minor Damage.  An F spaceport, by the 
way, is a D facility with nicer buildings (no lie!) - that makes sense 
(not!).

Boy, yet again I spend too much time telling folks what they already know 
(not to mention getting it wrong!).

Uh, that blew right past me. I\'m not really talking about quality of
government either. Rousseau, in the text mentioned, claims that it\'s
best to have a democracy in a small state, a republic in a
medium-sized one, and a monarchy in a large one. Lo and behold,
planets in the Imperium tend more toward democracies if they\'re small
(in terms of population), republics/bureaucracies if they\'re
medium-sized, and dictatorships if they\'re large. Thus my implied
correspondence.

Yes, well, I never got this impression from the materials
(descriptions of worlds tend to portray the government as being
exactly what it is in the gov code), and this doesn\'t explain to me
why high population worlds should have such a greater chance to have a
dictatorship of some kind.

    'body' => 'Hello again. I\'ve finally read all the way throught the Brilliant Lances 
game (BL), and have  a few comments and questions about it.

1. It seems that all the Battle Rider (BR) people don\'t like particle 
cannons, and prefer lasers, but in BL, the PPCs are way more powerful, 
and lasers, while they can penetrate armor will only a litle reduction in 
penetration, have very little actual punch. The biggest laser only does 
like 45 points, which will take out a few minor hits or one major hit. 
PPCs have penetration up to 200+ and with the low armor levels, this will 
atomize a large chunk of ship. Even at fairly extended ranges the punch 
is still strong. It seems to me that PPCs and meson guns are MORE 
powerful than lasers, at least in BL. Are there much more powerful lasers 
in BR?

2. Why are all the BL ships so low on armor? It seems that except for the 
System Defense boat, all the other ships have just enough armor to handle 
the G-forces, and no more. Is armor really that useless? I know that 
lasers will go through it easily, but I would think that 40-60 extra 
points could help in conjunction with sand casters, another think most 
ships don\'t have. I have yet to design a ship myself, but is space so 
tight that armor and defense have to be neglected?

3. What is the point of a fighter? Is it really hard to hit or detect, or 
does the advantage of having a mobile missle to screen your main ship 
outweigh the incredible ease it must be to destroy a fighter? I guess I 
could tally up a quick fight with a few fighters and a small ship to see 
for myself.

I\'ve gotten all the old tml logs, at least for the most recent 
reincarnation of it. I read about trouble with the old one, causing the 
switch of addresses. Do the logs for tml previous to the crash still 
exist somewhere? I am trying to loot all the TNE archive sites, but have 
only been able to get into ftp.MPGN.COM so far. Any others (I\'ve heard of 
ghost.cc.missouri.edu as well)?

Finally, I\'ve been kicking myself daily for not bringing my rulebook and 
FF&S to school with me (how stupid can you get? :) so I\'m not sure if 
this is covered in FF&S, but I have an idea for a new fleet weapon. 
Considering the fact that most armor is of very heavy metal elements (at 
least that\'s what I gather from Superdense, bonded superdense, etc.), 
would it be possible to make a neutron projecting cannon that bombards 
the armor with a heavy stream of neutrons, causing them to become heavy 
isotopes and decay? I figure that it would produce an effect like a 
radioactive meltdown of the armor, maybe even cause the ship to become a 
nuke. Any comments? I have to get cosy with my physics and chemistry 
books to really iron this out, but it\'s a thought.

One more thing. I think it would be a good idea if GDW gathered up all 
that CT and MT data they have in their old supplements, updated it a 
little, then resold it for us TNE guys who have never even SEEN a CT or 
MT product. I\'m thinking of the aliens, old ships, equipment, etc. Right 
now, I have NOTHING about the Imperium, I doubt I could even replicate a 
ruined pre-virus city. Sure the info would be redundant to those 
old-timer Travellers, but it sure would help out the new ones. Later

TNE Damage (in Traveller 93)
----
Well, what can I say? I would not want to get involved to many fire fights in
your game. I also thought that the system is not lethal enough but after the
last mission my players had I changed my mind. Well, actually all PCs got out
alive, but about half of them very badly wounded and that\'s enough for me.
And this was done by 7mm rifles and Pathie\'s machineguns. But then again 
it\'s a matter of taste. BTW I suppose your campaign is NOT very shooting
oriented. 

In fact I believe that the more lethal the combat the less you need it to
have the thrill of the combat. And same goes to the Virus (for those of us
who use it in the campaign), because Virus is so powerful it does\'t have to
be all-out-attack-machine to make things interesting.

Underbarrel laser
----
After reading my Cyberpunk material again I got the idea of underbarrel laser.
I think it will be DEI laser because it can have larger powerpack and it is
lower TL. I inted it to be TL 9. It will be placed under SMG so the 
combination will be quite effective. I\'ll post it here when I get it ready.

But I\'d like to know should I require the users to have laser pistol/laser
rifle skill to use that weapon and if so which one?

Battledress
----
Yes, I know I\'m a bit late for that topic but how have you managed with 10 h
duration of RCES Light Battledress? And how about maintenance? I think it 
needs maintenance more than just the suit of kevlar and thus also needs
Wear Value!

Combat Drugs
----
Has any one generated combat drugs for TNE? I think it must be used to enhance
the performance of (special forces) troops because cybernetic implaments are
so rare. So instead the drugs are the answer.

The Chirpers
----
As I have intended to use chirpers in my game, I\'d like to know more about
them and any suggestions you would like to give me about them. Notice that
I don\'t have access to old Traveller material so I can\'t go and see from some
book.

Thaks in advance for helping me out.

Jump and maneuver fuel can be purified in one day.  Normally the fuel
shuttles are used to refuel, but in an emergency, fuel scoops can fill 
the tanks in 2 hours 45 minutes (5%).  However, since the ship is not 
streamlined, this is only possible due to massive assistance from the
CG lifters, and skimming is a very hazardous operation:

  The task to successfully skim fuel is at +1 difficulty level.  
      Failure indicates fuel leakage in addition to any other problems.  
      Catastrophic Failure indicates contragrav or drive failure -- a 
      Formidable: Ship\'s Engineering task by the chief engineer must 
      succeed or the ship is lost.  
  The pilot of a vessel docked to the USL grapples while skimming is
      underway must make an Average: Pilot(Int/Grav) to avoid having
      the craft torn off the grapples.
	  
All fighters may be launched or recovered in three turns, and fighter
control bridges are integral to the main/auxiliary bridges.

The ship has sufficient controls, CG, and drives for 60000 ton operation
(four fuel shuttles attached in grapples).

Ten pre-modernization "flint boats" with primary weaponry intact were
believed to exist in the early 1100s; of these, four were modified by 
the IISS for their own purposes, one IISS-modified version was believed 
to be in Zhodani hands, and one was stripped of her fighter hangars 
and some secondary armaments and operated by Oberlindes Lines as a 
heavily-armed merchant in Vargr territory.  Of the other four, the
_Mire_ and _Darrian_ operated with the Darrian Confederation Navy,
and the _Sudden Star_ and _Accompanist_ with the Vegan District Navy.
Those four best fit the original specifications.

_Mire_, formerly FI-6332 _Vengeance_, is the second oldest _Azhanti_
still in operation, having entered service before the name ship of 
class in early 994.


DESIGNER\'S NOTES:

This is a faithful rendition of the original AHL "flint boat" depicted
by GDW for classic Traveller.  Conversion decisions, and even the hit
locations, were driven by the floorplans and High Guard stats.

Fusion turrets were replaced by the nearest TNE equivalent high-energy
weapon, the laser barbette.  Sensors and communicators were selected
based on those in _Arrival Vengeance_.

I chose to use the Open Frame USL hull for a number of reasons.  First,
the length conversion (in FF&S) came out nearly identical to the original 
design, which was aesthetically pleasing.  It helps explain the skimming
problems -- it depends on contragrav to refuel, and the USL makes flying
controllably harder.  Also, using open frame required use of a parallel
mount, which is off the axis of thrust and only 0.8 the length of the
ship, which matches the artwork.  The text in _Supplement 5_ actually
claims the Azhanti is built on an unstreamlined "outer frame" design.

Unfortunately, there isn\'t enough surface area in that configuration to
make the design work.  But since the hull isn\'t actually open, I ruled
that I could pay double to get the same surface area as Slab.  This is
the only place the rules were bent for this design.  If you don\'t like
this solution, it is very easy to convert this to Slab configuration;
all arcs of fire and damage tables reflect Slab configuration.  The
parallel mount becomes a spinal mount; it would only be 5.8 meters too
long.  Either way, the design decision is not crucial, since I don\'t
gain anything by choosing Open Frame over Slab with these restrictions,
except "atmosphere".

Since I didn\'t have handy TNE designs for the subsidiary craft, the
Manta, Armed Gig, and Rampart stood in for the Fuel Shuttle, Gunboat,
and TL14 Fighter masses respectively.  The following spaces have been 
reserved for flight crew: 9 for each shuttle, 3 for each gunboat, and 
1.2 for each fighter.  Fighter hangars and launch tubes were adjusted 
to launch only fighters, and not gunboats -- there just wasn\'t the room 
in the design, and anyway, the gunboats would be too long for the 18 meter 
high hangar decks!  Therefore, they must use the four aft 20 ton docking 
rings.  Fuel Shuttle length (and thus surface area in grapples) was 
estimated based on Cylinder configuration.

Since some volume is wasted in standard missile turrets, it turns out
that volume-wise, the centralized missile bay is quite economical.  There
are enough built-in MFDs in the bays to control all ready missiles.

Crew requirements have grown substantially.  The only way everyone could
fit involved going to quadruple-occupancy in small staterooms for the 
ratings.  ("Hot-bunking" using bunks in three shifts would be equivalent 
to sextuple-occupancy.)  Since the rules say naval command crew has to be 
carried for ship\'s troops, I figured I\'d put the marines to work, and as 
suggested in the old scenarios, a detachment mans one of the six bay 
weapon decks.  Frozen watch seems to have little place in TNE, but I put 
in as large a watch as I could.  The Darrians are advised to install TL16 
computers to greatly reduce the crew requirements.  Auxiliary bridges are
a pain, since you need to duplicate the entire bridge crew to man them!

The design turned out to need to be highly optimized (read: it was hard
to fit everything in and still have 50 G-turns!).  One implication is
that this ship is armed and equipped about as well as it could have
been if it were designed specifically for TNE.  Fuel tanks don\'t have
life support, but you wouldn\'t want any there anyway.

On a craft this large, low-volume items like turrets are hard to show
accurately on damage tables.  I did the best I could above to spread
them around so that the few points I had to work with were evenly 
distributed over the areas I said the weapons were in.  Besides, you\'d
have to be a bit loony to use _Brilliant Lances_ to run a combat with
this monster.

377.8 MW of power and an insignificant amount of surface area remain 
unused for potential modification.  The dimensions of the main "PA-1688" 
PAWS parallel mount are: length 324.8 meters; diameter 10.5 meters; 
cross-section 86.6 square meters; total volume with supporting facility
equipment (MFD, workstations, etc.) 49723 cubic meters; MCr 3027.5.

Wow. Incredible job, Steve, really great (I will use a number of the
now pre designed subsystems :)

My only comment (negative, that is) doesn\'t involve your design at all,
but rather the 150MJ TL14 laser turret.  The short range of 2,
regardless of what FF&S says as a plug in is crazy.  I can be short
range 5 with no added volume, otherwise it would be the same...

Once again, great work, you inspired me to do likewise with some of my
favorites, I\'ll post as I do them.

days ago, I somehow lost the original message. Sorry :(

Someone asked about the size of Passive Sensors in BR, I suggested that
maybe GDW had multiplied the Diameter of the Passive Arrays by their
tech level modification for area.   The next person said, that when you
decrease the diameter of an array you decrease resolution of the array.  
	That is exactly right, but the thing most people forget when
they talk about arrays is that arrays do not have the same light
gathering ability as a full apeture of the same diameter. You have
lowered the photon collecting area, hence you can not look at as faint
object with your array. 
         I kinda of assume when you are trying to look for enemy
targets, that have EM masking on, that they will be fairly faint, and
that light gathering ability would be more important. So on your screen
you would just see little dots, kinda of on a modern radar screen.  
Resolution would be nice, and would allow you to identify the target
better, but not essential.  
	Higher technology and better computer programs can help improve
resolution beyond the classic formula.  These involve knowing something
about what you are looking at. Spaceships look different then Binary stars.  
	
	I hoped that was at least somewhat interesting. Oh for anyone
who is interested, here at Georgia State Univ we are building an
optical array with a maximum baseline of 400m.  If you want to see
nifty pictures and lots of technical reports the WWW address is

Approaching Menorb is simplicity itself.  Most of the traffic consists of
regular, 5000 Disp cargo ships, coming in for Menorb\'s agroproducts,
mild Vargr alcoholic beverages, and Vargr entertainment products.  Only during
the 30-day festive season of Kengrogarz (a Vargr religious occasion,
celebrated every six years) does traffic become impossible, and many
starships are forced to conduct operations in close orbit, instead of
loading up on the starport.

Despite the low tech level, the port itself is well equipped (to TL D
standards) and well-run.  Trade law is "8" - expect to get most of your
lots past customs, but don\'t expect it to happen quickly.  The local
customs officals are well-trained Regency Vargr\'s, and have a master\'s
understanding of smuggling pratices.  If you are here strictly as a
stopover, there is a nice TL D hotel attached directly to the starport,
with all the amenities.  Because of high demand, though, lodgers may only
stay for a week.  If you can get in, though, the price is quite reasonable.

If you judge only by the population at New Menorb Starport, you\'d think
that Menorb is a Vargr world.  And you\'d be wrong: only about 22% of the
population is Vargr, the rest is human [typically local-born, and vaguely 
Solomani-looking (Indonesian?  East Indian?)].  However, the Vargr tends
to be the progressive element on Menorb: they dominate local business
interests, and are the main reason why Menorb\'s tech level has risen from 
TL 6 (back in 1050) to TL 7 (1116) to TL 8 (from 1180 to today). 

There are several items to be checked off before you leave Startown
(locals use the Vargr term of Anosarr).  A) Stow all weapons away. B) Be
sure to obtain a Murk vaccine shot.  C) Obtain a "Visitors ID Card";
looking like a TL 8 credit card, it will make dealing with the authorities
much easier.  D) Change your Regency currency to local Verba Script ("Verba
Currency" is a form of money used by the Verba Trading Block of Menorb,
Yres, Pixie, and Boughene): local merchants cannot use Regency credits.

Monorail lines can bring you swiftly to most important cities on Menorb;
hiring a driver (taxis or chauffers) is not recommended in the cities (too
expensive), but vital in the countryside.  Buses are the only alternative
in the cities, but are usually crammed and - depending on the line -
can be the site of thieves and hotheads.    

In the countryside, trains (electric or steam) and helicopters (for those
with money) are favoured.  In the Rough, transportation is by foot, jeep,
or by animals (typically, the triped Bro-Ckok, capable of carrying one or
two people, is favoured as a riding beast.  Not very fast, but capable of
enduring without water for three weeks.)

----

A large, influencial minority of the Vargr are followers of Runetha, a
Odysseus-like figure of widespread fame among Regina, Uthe, and Dirgir
Vargr\'s. (Uthe and Dirgir subsectors are located Coreward of the Spinward
Marches).  Runetha Saetedz (817 - 866) was a legendary Vargr
adventurer/pirate/scout who\'s exploits are betime reading for young Regina
Vargr.  Dying from old internal wounds, he managed to lead his band to
a heroic victory on Menorb, but died soon after.
   
Soon after his death, his followers founded the Runetha Society, to keep
alive his memory and his philosophy.  As his fame grew, they built the
Greater Thatho Temple in the Dro-Zhemm Hills, and spread his philosphy
throughout the region.

The Temple is the central site of the Runetha religion, now run by the
High Runetha Federation of Holy Adventurers.  The temple itself is a circular
building, of about 25 m length, 5 m in height, with a concave roof.  Of
strong interest is what\'s _above_ the temple: a large, floating, glowing
yellow ball, of about 30 m diameter.  It\'s quite bright (you cannot lok at
it directly within 50 meters if the ball), and can easily be mistaken for
a second sun.  

While there is a constant flow of about 500,000 visitors per year, the
Kengrogarz (which occurs every six years) leads to an influx of 10-20
million pilgrims from Regina, Uthe, anf Firgir subsectors.  Once here,
they go through various rituals (including a rigourous Hunt in the
countryside), leading up to a mass meeting and blood sacrifices of
various animals at the temple.

The religion itself is strongly focused on heroic endeavers, felt to be
the way of a True Life here and a glorious afterlife.  Study of Runetha\'s
history -- and the history of other hero\'s, Vargr and Humaniti\'s -- is     
a required tenant of the religion, as is the Aiding of all True Heroes, the
pursuit of at least one Quest in your life, and the support of the Runetha
Brotherhood above all worldly loves.  

----

In contrast, the local humans - who mainly work in Vargr plantations, or 
in isolated, independent communities - tend toward two religious
traditions.  The larger religion revolves in a form of nature-worship,
with a stress on the \'interconnectedness\' of Menorbianti life, and
the divinely-ordained place of humans in it.  Most of the workers follow
this faith, and tend to mix wise ecological pratices with the purest
superstitution (the most prevelant being in the Evil Eye and Forbidden
Phases).  While there is no house of worship or formal prayers, there is
a LOT of "holy days" and "feast days", which are strongly agricultural in
nature.  There is also the tratidion of the "Holy Fool", usually an insane
man who supposedly is "closer" to Menorb\'s WorldSpirit than normal mortals.

The isolated "Freeholder" communities - almost all desert tribes - prefer
their household and tribal idols.  Most of these idols are weapons of one
kind or another - ie. the "Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch" or "The First
Machinegun of Aezo".  Fusion guns are especially popular. 

----

The top industries on Menorb is agribusiness (Menorb fruits and grains,
marketed for Vargr tastes) and entertainment (Vargr recordings).  Both are
centred on Llil Suet, a city of 200 million set in the 2 km-deep Prince Martin
Valley.  Like most Menorbianti, the locals prefer to dress in simple togas
and light, garish robes.  They speak both Rark Vargr and Anglic fluently:
a few of the humans can even speak French!  They tend to view visitors as
"Funny folk", but can be easily coaxed into aiding the traveller, once their
intital shyness is overcome.  

Again, the city is dominated by Vargr\'s.  They tend to take a romantic
view of live, believing that "Life is to be Lived to the FULLEST."  Almost
every Vargr has his own small clique, with similar social, policical,
ecomomic, and spiritual interests.  These cliques are set in a continual
struggle for power, but they fight their battles using legal and
bureaucratic methods, rather than fighting vargr to vargr.  To get anything
done - say, to obtain housing in a valued neighbourhood - takes weeks of
political maneuver and in-fighting.  Connections with the government
bureaucracy, lawyers, and political figures are highly valued, and dictate
the amount of "pull" you have available (Money also helps... but in
several situations, your personal Charisma counts for more, especially if
what you ask for entails major risks to get.)

City architeture is typically Vargr.  Enormous sizes, bizzare and
whimisical forms, and hard-to-find enterances mark the typical Vargr
corporate building.  While Solomani build to flaunt technical expertize,
and Vilani build to last, the Vargr designers want "to express
themselves"... in a riot of color.  The streets are a maze of avenues,
alleys, and large "asphalt football fields" that apparently exist for no
reason at all.  Those humans who take "the laws of the road" as a personal
challange will delight in Menorbianti traffic.

Personal buildings are generally built of pre-fab concrete slabs, of
questionable stability.  Of course, they are painted and garished to the
owner\'s taste.  Strangely enough, they can look very beautiful in
the deep red twilight of ol\' Red Eye when he\'s setting.  But don\'t stay
out at night long: even though (at 35 deg latitude) the days are quite
hot (at about 20 Deg celsius in spring/fall), the nighttime temperatures can
fall to -44 easily.

 The ships in the basic TNE rulebook have all had deckplans in print at
one time or another. The following list is of the ships in Brilliant

 Of the ships listed in the RCEG (Reformation Coalition Equipment Guide)
only the Mary Ellen Carter Armed Merchant has plans (listed above as
the "extreme conversion of hull" of the Petty) in the TNE Referee\'s Screen.

 The ships listed in the World Tamers Guide are all without deckplans in
print.

 Note that many of the old sets of plans are rather inaccurate portrayals
of the ship\'s characteristics. Many are the wrong size (often by a factor
of 2 or 3), and more are lacking sufficient fuel and places to put it.
The old FASA plans were the worst offenders, though even GDW and DGP were
guilty of it (the Jayhawk/Type A2 and the Morraine/Type A being the
primary cases).
 With the exception of the Mary Ellen Carter in the RCEG, all of the plans
listed above are for previous editions of the game and previous editions
of the ships. Having found the plans you are looking for, your mileage
may vary as to their usefulness with the current edition. YOU HAVE BEEN
WARNED!

 There are ships with deckplans that are not listed above. This list only
includes TNE ships in print with full BL/FF&S stats.

I remember this ("this" being that the government code represents the style
of government that the players will encounter rather than the formal
structure of the government) from an _early_ publication (or possibly a
letter from someone at GDW).  Unfortunately most of my Traveller material is
still packed (after 28 moves I\'m getting slower at unpacking), and because
I\'ve been playing since the beginning that\'s a _lot_ of material to search.

Does anyone remember anything like this?  If not then I\'ll admit it was
probably in a letter (possibly the same one in which Marc told me to ignore
die rolls and rules if I didn\'t like them -  which kinda blew my teenaged
rules-lawyer mind).

In any case, I treat the government code as indicating style of government
rather than structure.   When I feel malicious I dream of publishing only the
\'official\' government code equivalent - letting the players discover the
nasty truth for themselves.  ("But the Terran Encyclopedia says that
Indonesia/Iran/Irak/... is a democracy with a concern for human rights!")

         In the Nov 1994 issue of _Popular_Science_, p.32, there is an
    article about the Army\'s research into "electromagnetic (EM) guns"
    for tanks (that\'s mass-driver cannon for us TML types).  It seems
    that U of Texas at Austin researchers already have a prototype the
    size of a small room, and Army engineers have started development
    of "...a tank-top EM weapon that would be five times smaller than
    the current prototype.  It could be ready for the battlefield as
    early as 2010".
         The problem they had to solve was that of storing the power
    for each firing in something smaller than a building; they solved
    it by using a flywheel for energy storage.  I also noted that the
    article cited possible muzzle velocities of "at least 10
    kilometers per second"... compare 10,000 m/sec to FF&S max of
    6000 m/sec at TL11.

    Hypertext:
        - I\'m going thru my design archives and formatting guns,
    ships, etc for OS/2 hypertext (INF) display.  The IPF tags are
    very similar to HTML used for WWW stuff (both descend from SGML),
    so if anyone is interested in IPF/HTML source for Megatraveller
    ship archives, or TNE guns (in progress), or 2300AD ship design
    rules (as modified by Mark V., but can be modified back), let me
    know/ make me an offer (if you want HTML format, send me some good
    documentation on HTML format and be willing to test it and fix it
    -- I don\'t have any Mosaic/WWW readers here.  An awk script or
    program that converts IPF to HTML would be nice -- it should be a
    trivial task to write one, but I need to get HTML docs and a
    "\'round to-it".)

    Guns, guns, guns:
     - Graham Spearing, if you still haven\'t come up with a name for
    that 12.5mm TL-10 ETC monster, I have named it the "DeCorbin Light
    Assault Gun Model 1201".  Does anyone else remember the LAG from
    Book 4:Mercenary?  Is this thing more like an anti-tank rifle or
    that monster Russian machinegun?  And at 16 kg empty (!) weight,
    ain\'t nobody but Sly Stallone gonna fire this baby from the hip!
    I suggest adding an integral bipod... yes, I know it doesn\'t need
    one for recoil reduction, but consider taking the load off the
    shooter\'s arms...

*   2. Why are all the BL ships so low on armor?  It seems that except
*   for the System Defense boat, all the other ships have just enough
*   armor to handle the G-forces, and no more.  Is armor really that
*   useless?  I know that lasers will go through it easily, but I
*   would think that 40-60 extra points could help in conjunction with
*   sand casters, another think most ships don\'t have.  I have yet to
*   design a ship myself, but is space so tight that armor and defense
*   have to be neglected?

    Don\'t have either BL or BR, but GDW is well-known for "suboptimal"
    (to be polite) ship designs.  Space is much more avaible for extra
    armor and defenses than it was under MT design rules, so you
    probably should have some.  The only way to "prove" various design
    theories is to play combats with different ships and see what
    happens.  Experience is a wonderful teacher; the best High Guard
    designs were those by people who had played a TCS campaign or two.

*   3. What is the point of a fighter?  Is it really hard to hit or
*   detect, or does the advantage of having a mobile missle to screen
*   your main ship outweigh the incredible ease it must be to destroy
*   a fighter?  I guess I could tally up a quick fight with a few
*   fighters and a small ship to see for myself.

    I have yet to try fighter combat under TNE rules -- it could be
    very different from previous experience.  With that caveat in
    mind, I point out that under High Guard and MegaT you could design
    fighters that were so maneuverable that they literally could not
    be hit by anything short of a spinal mount.  Sure, one solid hit
    will destroy a fighter, but first you have to get that hit.  And
    targetting fighters with your capital ships\' spinal weapons is (a)
    mostly futile, as the swarms of fighters will strip your outer
    hull of sensors, weapons, drives, etc.  before you can knock out
    enough of them, and (b) dangerous if the enemy also brought
    capital ships with him.  Again, this may have changed in a big way
    in TNE -- for one thing, the gunner\'s skill is more important than
    it used to be.

*   Considering the fact that most armor is of very heavy metal
*   elements (at least that\'s what I gather from Superdense, bonded
*   superdense, etc.), would it be possible to make a neutron
*   projecting cannon that bombards the armor with a heavy stream of
*   neutrons, causing them to become heavy

(A) Standard PAWS are neutron accelerators -- electron and proton
    streams are too easy to deflect with magnetic fields, and they DO
    cause all kinds of amusing radiation damage.
(B) Superdense seems to be gravitically compressed metals -- like
    neutron-star crustal lattices (improved crystaliron,
    crystalnickel -- see neat Scientific American article on neutron
    star crusts, many years ago).  Or maybe not -- strengths of
    superdense, etc. are way low for lattice crystal metals.

No, not as shipped.  The problem people have is that it is possible, using FF&S,
to design powerful lasers which (it appears) will render the weapons balance 
assumed by the BL/BR designs, and all of past traveller versions, so much 
twaddle.  Reather this is bad or not depends on how much you care about the old 
designs making sense.

themselves out 300,000 years ago. The survivors either survived as six-casted
Droyne at TL A-B or regressed to pastoral "barbarism" as chirpers. Chirpers
retain some psionic powers; invisibility by mind clouding within about 50\' is
one.

Trouble is, you can never be sure whether that\'s a useless chirper, or
Grandfather taking a vacation in the real universe... well, except
for the disintegrator GrandFather carries around. :)

Are there still \'Ancients\' in TNE? If so, someone should go dig 
up Grandfather and get him to get rid of the Virus. Should be a piece
of cake for the old guy.

   Yes, but not until at least sometime next year.  I am
working on the Solomani Rim and Magyar Sectors, the first on a 
semi-formal basis for GDW, the later sort of on my own.  Other
individuals that I am aware of are working on Aldebaran and Alpha Crucis
Sectors through HIWG (the History of the Imperium Working Group).


>Second question was that there was some sort of research station in pluto

   The description in Solomani and Aslan of Pluto is as follows:
   "...a major Imperial Navy base and research lab stood in orbit above
Pluto.
Traffic to and from these facilities was heavy, even though civilian travel
was prohibited within a 1 AU radius.  No explanation for this restriction
was ever given..." The Solomani Navy continued the restriction after they
retook the system in 1117.

   From the description (and the narrative from which it is drawn), we can
conclude a few things.  Whatever was/is there it was discovered/invented
after 1002 (the date of the Imperial occupation of the system) and before
1117, otherwise the existence of a previous Solomani outpost was have
been mentioned in the narrative.  The main facility is in orbit.  This does
not preclude the existence of sites on the surface, though maintaining
such facilities would be very problematic, given the surface temperature of
Pluto, and the basic composition of its surface, which is covered mostly
with methane ice.  Could be that there is an Ancient site there (given
that the Solomani have taken such an interest in a place that could have 
been picked clean before the Imperials left).  Maybe the Imperial
government was interested in doing experiments in an extreme low
temperature environment and the Solomani decided to take over their
research.  The facility could also be a high tech prison for *really*
nasty prisoners (war criminals, mass murderers, people convicted of
treason, those who have made one too many successful escape attempts
from other facilities, those responsible for Galactica 1980)--escape is
impossible, and even if you manage to steal a ship, the Navy will kill you
long before you reach the jump point.

   I know more than I can say at this point, except that the current
Terran government has the same restrictions and prohibitions in place that
the Imperials and Solomani did....

   As long as the ship were completely isolated and took on no additional
hardware that could potentially infect the ship (hardware capable of
harboring Virus eggs or the Virus itself), then there would be no way for the
ship to become infected.

   On the other hand, try showing up in orbit around a planet without
identifying yourself with at least a communication signal.  If you don\'t
get blasted out of the sky, it\'s because they don\'t know that you are there
and/or are incapable of shooting at you.

Sure, it\'s in Supp 3:  The Spinward Marches, at 37-38:  

"Government:  The government type for
a world indicates the general nature of the
ruling system in a general sense.  It may
be interpreted in a variety of ways.  For
example, while ancient China is
considered to be an empire, its
government could be considered to be
type8, civil service bureaucracy....  

"In effect, government types express the
level of government which the average
traveller encounters.  The upper level
mechanizations (sic) of government are
less important to an individual than the
actual conditions which will be
encountered at the personal level."

    I am planning a alternate reality campaign and want to run it past
you peoples to see if you could see any major problems. It is on earth
during the new era. Earth was spared by a daring solsec agent who was
on a infected jump 6 ship. Just before coming out of jump he destroyed
the transponder,communicartions, and sensors. Before this he actually
wrote a explanation of the virus and how it was beeing passed on and
that his ship was infected. When he came out of jump the computer
realizng what he had done ordered him to fix it when he refused it let
him breath vaccum. Of course the solomani navy attacked the ship since
it had no transponder. When they sent a search team in the computer
attempted to kill them. Eventaualy they found the note. So the
computer was isolated and tested and it came back positve. Now Terra
had maybe 5 days till the next infected high jump ship could make it
in. Quickly they shut off transponders and rerouted sensors and
communication. When the infected ships appeared in system they were
attacked. This didn\'t stop small outbreaks of the virus but a complete
and total collapse was prevented. THis doesn\'t mean the last 70 years
have been easy. They have been fighting a constant battle with vampire
fleets and earths resources aren\'t what they used to be. eventually
becxause of isolation and constant combat with vampire ships its
pulled the tech down to tech level 12. Terra is now beggining to think
about expansion and a new terran empire.

I like this guy,  He thinks the way I do.  Someday someone is going to 
discover what\'s really out in the "Abyss Rift" in Lanth-Vilis subsectors --
 then I\'ll have to figure out how to do sanity checks in TNE.  And Dark

equipment [a la Pentapods] if you strip off the more unrealistic

I pegged the Mi-Go as a bunch of interstellar mafia/smugglers/slaver types 
operating on the fringes of the Vilani Empire -- they\'d happily exploit 
defenseless primitives, but steered clear of the armed might of the Ziru 
Sirka.  Of course, they weren\'t above buying a corrupt provincial governor 
here and there... and their occult/psionic studies gave them an certain, 
shall we say... edge in dealing with such individuals.  I saw Pluto as an 
outpost, at best, not their home world (as Lovecraft implied in "The 
Whisperer in the Dark".  Unfortunately for them, the Terrans had better 
tech than the Vilani, and too many psionically aware individuals -- 
something about living on a planet with so many imprisoned Great Old Ones...

Alternatively, the Impies discovered the Palainian outpost on Pluto... and 
were still trying to figure out how to talk to them when the Solomani
reclaimed Terra.

>Makes sense when you think about it - the Solomani Party is the nearest 
>thing Traveller has to a bunch of cultists.

Have you ever considered how much Yaskaydroy [sic] (Grandfather) 
resembles a Great Old One?  I mean, he\'s weirdly non-human, has vast 
mental powers, is "imprisoned" in a pocket universe, has a non-human 
servitor race with "occult" (psionic) powers that worships him and would 
serve his every whim, leaves statues of himself littering unfathomable 
ruins of non-Euclidean geometry (okay, so it  was a robot...), has human 
and Vargr cultists who engage in rather anti-social behaviors in his name,
and his benevolence is questionable -- he destroyed whole worlds to get at
his enemies, and took human beings and used them for lab rats...
So what\'s Cthulhu got that Yaskaydroy doesn\'t?  Better press?  
Let\'s invent a few moldy old occult tomes from minor race home planets 
around the Imperium that rave about Yaskaydroy.

Let\'s see... I do have Lovecraft\'s starfish-headed aliens wandering around 
the fringes of the Imperium -- the IISS has classified them as "just another
minor race".  They haven\'t noticed that the Pentastrians (as I dubbed them)
are even more widely scattered than the Droyne, as most Pent worlds are 
far beyond the borders of the Imperium.  The Zhos and the various Vargr
states
 haven\'t caught on either, because the lot of them haven\'t correlated all the

minor races in their territories.

The Mi-Go fooled around causing a lot of trouble during the Long Night, but
vanished from Known Space when the various states got back on their feet --
they don\'t like to take on organized navies.  With the Collapse, however....

As for "multi-genre roleplaying" <grin>, I\'ve been wondering how the Vampire
clans would have followed the Terran diaspora to the stars...  Just
daydreaming,
mind you, nothing serious.  I wouldn\'t really do such a thing -- trust me!

My knowledge of TNE jump mechanics is not all that extensive but
since it seems to require you to be far away from gravity sources
before you turn it on, I would assume that within a gravity well
it would not work well at all.  No not at all.  Now whether it
would implode or explode (and where would it implode to) is 
another question.

This leads into a interesting thing about putting intestellar
devices on planets in the first place.  Naturally it depends on
what sytem the author used.  The classic "Spindizzy" (James Blish\'s
Cities in flight) was directly proportional to mass so that hooking
up a planet sent it across the galaxy before they could bat an eye.

Most systems, including TNE Jump Drive, tend to require a relatively
ecludian sapce time curve, (er I mean outside any gravity wells) in
order for them to function.

Then again, if a man is mad enough to put together a working jump
drive in the privy of his own penthouse, then the odds are he is
also so mad as to not be able to get that one piece of equipment 
rght, or likewise he is so mad as to stumble on (by accident) some
terrible dangerous thing.

The good news was that it actually worked.

The bad news was that since there were no covers over the portholes 
of the planet (as it were) everyone who was on the surface and could
"see" the sky had to be killed (or blinded) on general princpiple and 
the nearby star system is convinced that that approaching planet is 
virus infected.

I found one flaw, how Solomani could test the ship\'s computers for Virus
infection when almost nobody knew about the Virus before it destroyed
everything? Otherwise it sounds cool.

To Cindy
That Old Ones thing sound cool also. I have thought about it also, but
I haven\'t done anything about it yet. I have found something very curious
about Thorell (0231 Old Expanses). You see, it has atmos 1 and TL-0!
Would\'t it be a great place to start a good horror campaign? Besides in 
NE it is barren world, or is it?

I have to say that I run that type of campaign back in Space Master times.
It started out as an ordinary SciFi game, but end up in great conspiracy
that involved lots of magic and portals. You should have seen my player\'s
faces when they discovered that the opponents thay had just shot down began
to heal and rise. Ah you never forget your first zombie scenario.

Currently I also GM Rolemaster and the above mentioned campaign continues in
it except that characters are new.

Again about Chirpers
Is it possible that when chirpers get offsprings and those offsprings go to
that ritual in which the cast is chosen, they could become Droyne? Or is it
that once chirper allway chirper?

So long...

Well, as someone else pointed out, a misjump is *certain*.  You\'re deep
  in the gravity well and I doubt the Leader is an expert navigator.

Anything that\'s enclosed in the grid of lanthanum wire goes; anything
  outside stays.  If the gaps in the grid are too big, the top floor
  might not jump at all, or (if you want to be really nasty) will be
  converted to energy, mostly a flash of gamma rays.  In a planetary
  atmosphere, this will have effects much like a nuclear bomb going
  off, in which case you not only don\'t want to be inside, you don\'t
  want to be anywhere NEAR...

Assume that, by some miracle, the jumpfield manages to form around a 
  good-sized chunk of the top floor.  The field is not air-tight; 
  any compartments which are open will explosively decompress into 
  jumpspace.  Jump sickness will be acute or fatal, due to the 
  awful misjump as well as the patchwork grid.  You\'ll probably have
  bubbles of jumpspace physically intruding into the structure.

You said that the tower has "all the major components of a spaceship."
  I hope that includes life-support; the Leader may have forgotten to
  provide for his guests that aren\'t brains-in-jars.  Air, heat, 
  food, water, freshers...  The only thing you can probably count on
  is fusion power.

Finally, when you do get to wherever you\'re going (after an absolutely
  miserable week), it\'s probably going to be a one-way trip, unless
  you brought along a few hundred liters of liquid hydrogen and a 
  high-output power plant to burn it for another jump.  

Wouldn\'t it be simpler to just drop a giant anvil on them?

Chirpers that dosen\'t get casted at puberty remains chirpers forever. I
originally thought that a chirper was just an unlucky droyne, and that
the offspring of any chirper could be casted if caught young enough. The
Old Traveller module _Alien Realms_ imply that it\'s more complicated than 
that. Apparently there are two different types of chirpers: chirpers who
has lost the knowledge to caste, but can be casted if there is a drone
with a set of coyns around, and chirpers who have lost the ability to
caste entirely. In fact, _Alien Realms_ imply that most chirpers are of
the second kind and that finding a chirper colony of the first kind is
a rare and wonderful opportunity for droyne. Personally I ignore this and 
regard all chirpers as potential droyne.

	A while ago I wrote an Excel spreadsheet for designing power pack
	lasers, and in the beginning I had some problems figuring out the
	Storage Battery requirements.


	Your laser needs ( 50 * 0.1 = ) 5 Mj storage battery.

	TL-9 batteries can store 0.4 MWh per cubic meter of battery. 1 MWh
	equals 3600 Mj, so the battery contains ( 0.4 * 3600 = ) 1440 Mj/m^3
	= 1.44 Mj/dm^3.

	5 Mj / 1.44 Mj/dm^3 = 3.472 dm^3 of battery

	If the ROF is 2 shots/turn, the whole battery can be discharged in
	( 5 / 2 * 50 = ) 125 seconds. The slowest possible Battery Discharge
	Rate that can be used is the 36-second model that doubles the battery
	price.

	The Power Pack must have the battry, homopolar generator, 20-50% of
	the DEI laser cooling system, and protetctive casing.

	Component	Volume (dm^3)	Weight (kg)	Price (Cr)
	Battery (5 Mj)	  3.472		  6.944		 13.88
	HPG (0.1 Mj)	 10		 20		 20
	Cooler (50%)	  0.5		  1		850
	Casing (AV 1)			  4.192		 41.92
	----
	TOTAL		 13.972 dm^3	 32.136 kg	925.80 Cr

	If powered by generator instead of battery, the power input will be
	( ( 0.1 Mj * 2 shots ) / 5 seconds = 0.04 MW ) = 40 kW.


	As an example of DEI laser weapons:

Power Pack Weight: 6.36 kg
Power Pack Price: Cr540
Power Pack Capacity: 0.75 kWh battery (2.7 Mj energy), 3.6 second discharge
time, with 40 kj HPG and 50% cooler. 40 kW maximum output gives one 40 kj
shot every second for 50 seconds.
Features: Laser sight, optic sight, ruggerized weapon body (to melee
standards), mounting rail for underslung secondary weapon.

Energy	ROF	Dam Dice	Pen	Bulk	Mag	Range

800 j	50	 1-1-0		Nil	6	50	200 (300)

Notes: Short Range for aiming purposes is 300 meters, but atmospheric
performace may be different. The beam wavelenght is optimized for various
athmosphereic thiknesses.
Vacuum	10 km	Trace	9 km	V Thin	1 km	Thin	400 m
Stand	200 m	Dense	100 m	Exotic	20 m
The power pack has adapter for external power input, that can be used to
recharge the battery or power the weapon. The maximum power input is 53.3 kW.

"2000 Worlds" itself comes from the fact that, due to cloud cover,
about 2000 stars can be seen on a typical night on a typical point on
Kirur. It thus can be colloquially translated "night sky" or
"universe"; it doesn\'t reflect the actual number of worlds in the
state. The average tech level is D, the maximum F. Gov type is type P,
Q, or R (varying sizes of K\'kree hierarchies) based on population. Law
level is K (only K\'kree warrior caste may carry weapons).

The Hive Federation occupies wholly or partially sectors (6,-1) (7,-1)
(8,-1) (6,-2) (7,-2) (8,-2) (9,-2) (4,-3) (5,-3) (6,-3) (7,-3) (8,-3)
(9,-3) (4,-4) (5,-4) (6,-4) (7,-4) and (8,-4). The Hiver homeworld,
Guaran, is in subsector I of Ricenden sector (7,-2); the Hive
Federation capital, Glea, is in subsector H of Centrax sector
(6,-3). The Ithklur homeworld, Tryylin, is in subsector H of Extolian
sector (6,-2); an independent Ithklur client-state covers one
subsector to each side of the rimspinward corner of Extolian
sector. Over 170 minor races live within the Federation, with the
Hivers taking a "first among equals" status; cultural differences are
less than might be expected as a result of Hiver "manipulations" (a
primary reason for the Federation is the maintenance of cultural
homogeneity among the Hivers). Max tech level is F, client races tend
to be around B-C, Hivers around D-E. Gov type is either 1, 2, 6, or
one of the specialized Hiver gov types (S, T, U, W; T and U are
"unsupervised anarchy" and "supervised anarchy"). Law level is 1d6
among Hivers, 2d6 for client race planets.

The major event involving these two states was the Hiver-K\'kree war
(-2029 - -2013). It started when K\'kree began expanding into the Hiver
coreward frontier. Since the Hivers are pacifists in general, they
fought a weak delaying action while they made plans. Eventually, they
performed a set of "manipulations" on K\'kree border worlds which
caused some of them to accept things like meat sauces on food or
isolation during recreation (both of which would horrify most
K\'kree). They then revealed these to the K\'kree and claimed they would
"manipulate" K\'kree society into something more favorable to Hiver
interests if the incursions didn\'t stop. The incursions did stop, and
the manipulated K\'kree worlds were razed of all life.

some help here.  Perhaps it\'s because I don\'t understand the rules or
because all is okay but the rules work differently as I would expect
(what I would call unrealistic then :-).

Nearly every hand weapon has a penetration rating of nil.  That means
that every piece of armor, for example a normal space suit with AV 0,
will stop any round.  (The 2 to 4 points of blunt damage are not worth
mentioning here.)  If a weapon (with DS or HEAP ammunition) as a
penetration rating of 1, the normal AV 6 battle armor will block up to
6 dice of damage, more than normal weapons have.  Is this correct?  Or
do I have missed some rules?

A normal weapon, btw, is for example an about 80 cm long assault
riffle -- not this 2,60 m long giant gun that is described in
Challenge 74 and what has DV 9 and a penetration rating of 1.  That\'s
the only weapon that will do 3 dice damage to my AV 6 light battle
armor trooper.

So what\'s the standard-weapon for such a RC-trooper?  Or will they use
good old swords with DV 3?  Because the armor will only absorb 12
points of sword damage (correct?) there\'s a fair change to damage your
opponent.  That\'s strange!

If the above rules are correct, it\'s impossible to damage someone
wearing a body protection with AV 2 or higher with pistols or AV 4 or
higher with rifles.  Both with guns and armor of the same TL.  (Ok,
you can hope that the opponent isn\'t wearing a helm but a helmet and
you success to it him in the face...)

And what\'s about lasers.  If I\'m right, you can\'t penetrate the DV 6
body armor with a laser neither.

I would be very glad if someone could explain me the rules in his own
words.  I\'m afraid, I\'m unable to understand the original rules.

PS: The whole discussion about penetration isn\'t related to too low
damgage/too high hit points. IMHO, another flaw of the combat system.

Nope. Modern Droyne have a maximum TL of about 12; they also have a

This is correct; you are not putting the numbers in perspective.
Specfically:


>Nearly every hand weapon has a penetration rating of nil.  That means
>that every piece of armor, for example a normal space suit with AV 0,
>will stop any round

All modern armor, you mean.  Archaic armor and clothes don\'t stop bullets.
Modern armor is *designed* to stop pistol bullets, at the very least.  If it didn\'t,
it wouldn\'t be armor.  The spacesuits are perhaps overarmored -- I think
someone thought they needed a suit that would keep out micrometeriods and
resist minor tears and punctures.  Put people in those light-duty spacesuits
if you don\'t want most spacecrew wearing light armor.

AV 6 battle dress: again, put it in perspective.  This is as much armor as
the front of a M113 APC!  (Which was *designed* to keep out small arms fire).
I should hope that AV6 armor stopped pistol and rifle fire!  (Source for APC
armor: Twilight 2000 American Combat Vehicle Handbook -- systems are the
same for weapons & vehicles from T2K to TNE.)  You aren\'t going to put down
someone wearing the equivalent of light APC hull armor with a TL10+ M16A2
(or TL10+ G3 in your case :-) ) , you need a serious anti-armor weapon.

>If the above rules are correct, it\'s impossible to damage someone
>wearing a body protection with AV 2 or higher with pistols or AV 4 or
>higher with rifles.  Both with guns and armor of the same TL.  (Ok,

Yep.  It\'s true in the Real World (tm), too.  Some more examples from T2K
Vehicles, to provide Real World vehicle equivalents:
         AV 1 = chassis of truck, jeep or car
         AV 3 = LAV-25 hull side
         AV 4 = side armor of M113 APC.
         AV 6 = front armor of M113 APC, LAV-25

The flaw, if any, is that with the arbitrary "TL" system thrown in, you
don\'t see the constant cycle of "better offense, better defense, even
better offense, repeat" that you do in the Real World.  Personal opinion
is that battle dress is expensive enough and so training-intensive that
only elite troops wear it until very high TLs; the average soldier wears
TL 9 combat environment suit (AV 1) thru TL 12 combat armor (AV 3).
-- which can be punched thru by contemporary infantry weapons
(TL 10 7mm ACR, TL 12 4mm Gauss).  Squad support weapons
should be able to nick the guys in battle dress, if you fight such
types very often.

As for lasers, there\'s a note in the Upgrade Booklet that only
rigid ceramic or metallic armor protects against lasers -- ballistic
weave doesn\'t do a thing for you. Battle dress, however, is the
rigid stuff that shrugs off laser fire...

I haven\'t playtested the combat rules yet, but they look reasonable,
and they\'ve undergone several generations of shaking out (these
are an evolution of the T2K-C&D-DC combat rules).  Hope this helps
you sort things out.

I questioned one of my sources on this, one Droyne Sport Twi; it said:
"Interesting how far that bit of disinformation has spread.  It has done a good
job of keeping you non-Droyne from doing things like harassing us to spill
the secrets of the Ancients, holding Droyne populaces hostage until we
build "Ancient superweapons" for you, etc, etc.  Unforunately for us, Leader
Lucan was so paranoid he wouldn\'t believe our disinformation, an example
of the exception proving the rule."

My best sources tell me that most Droyne have no *need* for anything
beyond TL10 or so ---- so they don\'t bother building it. If they do need
something, technicians are assigned to build it.  Everything ever
invented by a sport or designed by a leader whose world and Droyne
population still exists is available to the psionic/racial memory of the priest
drones or within the antique Droyne databanks carefully maintained by
the technicians as they have always been maintained, for uncounted
thousands of years.  Only Droyne populations that lose casting
(become chirpers) or die out entirely lose their memory.

Admittedly, a great many Droyne populations lost casting between the
Final War (300,000 BC) and the introduction of Coyns (75,000 BC), but
not all.  Many Droyne populations with the really advanced TL were
wiped out along with their patron Child, but a very few technologies filtered
out to the general Droyne culture ( jump 3+ drives, psi tech).  The
Zhodani\'s loss of their companion Droyne on Zhdant was more tragic
than they realized, because this was a population dating back to the Ancients
that had not lost casting...

OTOH, I\'ll bet that the Droyne have a "superstitious" fear of anything that
might be one of Yaskaydroy\'s personal toys, and it\'s a realistic fear, not
a "superstitious" fear.  He\'s an undead demigod who shatters worlds and
exterminates whole races when something ticks him off.  He might come
out of his hole if someone were foolish enough to get his attention, and
do you think any sane Leader or Sport wants that to happen?

    'body' => '        Hi there.  I was in an odd mood today, and was thinking about how
much anti-matter all of those Alliance designs that keep going by have.  I
decided to figure out how much DV would be done to a bystander at 1L-sec
away if ONE ton of AM detonated.
        The math follows, but I explain what I did, and I hope someone can
find fault here.  I say this, because otherwise the alliance just spent a
huge amount of cash on fleets that can be destroyed by *1* lucky shot.
        I believe the real-world AM/M energy yeild is E=MC^2.  Lets assume
that a 1 ton AM pod ruptures, and only 50% of its contents react with
matter.  That leaves us with a yeild of 45 000 000 000 000 000Mj.  Weapon
intensity in FF&S is equal to the Mj divided by the square of the range (in
thousands of Km).  I used a range of 1 light-second.  This gives us an
effective I of 50 000 000 000Mj.
        Damage Value is equal to 5 times the root of I.  I further decided
that I am no mathematician nor physicist and therefore divided the
resulting DV by a "fudge factor" of two to deal with any high-energy
phenomena I am not familiar with.
        The result is that a one light second away, a bystander ship would
that just over 1,767,700 points of damage.  Per ton of AM exploding.
        At one light minute, one has somewhat better odds, with only 29,460
points of damage being inflicted.  At one AU (which is 8 light minutes, if
I remember correctly), it is no worse than a solid thwack from a spinal
mount with a mere 3,680 points.

        At this time, I have decided that until someone shows me where my
math is wrong (PLEASE!), I am having my empire BAN research on antimatter
systems in populated star systems.  Think about what would happen to a
world caught in a blast that reaches out *TWO AU* in diameter with enough
force to shatter starships...  Not to mention any incidental space traffic
or stations around that world.
        Anti-matter production facilites would have to be kept in empty
subsectors for both safety and strategic reasons.  One nut with a
death-wish could genocide a star system by causing a power-failure on the
AM holding pods.  Or an enemy Navy using a heavily armored and screened
drone ship doing a Kamakazi attack at 30g\'s.

        Here is my math;  I used a spreadsheet to sort it out and just
pasted the results into this message.

e     = m       c^2
9E+22 = 1000000 9E+16

5E+11 = 45 000 000 000 000 000          90000

Even without your throwaway, I get 3.979E-9 MJ cm-2

The rules talk about 1 MJ cm-2 needed to penetrate 1 cm of steel... the
energy above wouldn\'t warm the hull much.

The problem with the math above is that you channel *all* the energy
onto the target in the 1cm^2 that the rules use to measure
damage/penetration.

You need to take the total energy released, and divide it by the area of
a sphere at the range you are interested in (the area in cm^2, since the
rules deal with MJ delivered to a 1 cm^2 area).  The damage value
associated with the AM above would be on the E-16 order.

To relate this to the real world, our sun loses something like several
thousand tons of mass every second (I remember it being much more, but I\'m
sure any astronomers here can peg the exact figure), converting it to
energy via fusion.

I don\'t have any of the rules you guys are using so I can\'t exactly follow
what you\'re doing, but dividing by R^2 converts from energy to energy flux,
or energy per area (ignore time).  So to get back to MJ you need to
multiply by the projected area of the sphere (in the same units as R), not
divide.

The problem is that if a ship powered by antimatter takes
a fuel hit that affects, say, 1 ton, the detonation will definitely
release ALL other AM fuel on the ship.

So the mass used in the E=mc^2 equation needs to be

2*M(a)

(Two times the total mass of Antimatter on board.)

Remember that when one ton of AM is annihilated, a ton
of MATTER is annihilated with it.  So for each ton of AM,
TWO tons of mass are converted to energy.

What does that do to your figuring?

That sounds considerably higher than the numbers I\'ve seen before. In 5631, a
5-ton AM warhead was used to demolish the Imperial sector capital at Cyril,
but it didn\'t actually blow up the planet or (as far as I know) trash every
ship in the inner system. In fact, Steve told me that it would take around
200 tons of AM to actually destroy a planet. That seems pretty far removed
from the figures mentioned in Michel\'s article. Anyone else out there know
anything about this?

Well, this can be done with the little ones. The larger Mark 2 and 3 versions
need to be orbiting something, though, so they can\'t be in the middle of
nowhere. The Alliance did evacuate the population from the system where it\'s
built its Mark 2 facility (there were only a few thousand people there).

It\'s not that simple. Anyone who gets close enough to AM pods to sabotage
them is subjected to a very intense screening process, including psionic
examinations at regular intervals. They\'re not easy to sabotage, either. Only
the commanding officer can voluntarily detonate an AM pod, and all AM storage
facilities are well guarded.

Well, as of 5650 nobody\'s warships can do 30g\'s (except maybe the Droyne). A
raid on the big AM facility is a concern, of course, but all the Alliance can
do is provide lots of defenses and hope for the best. Unfortunately, a
sufficiently determined attacker can destroy any fixed target, regardless of
how good its defenses might be.

I took this one out of order. Let\'s dispell once and for all the notion that
there\'s something unusual or foolish about building ships that can be
destroyed by one lucky shot. Take two battleships, one AM powered and one NH3
powered. Both take a lucky hit from a Meson-T mount. Results are:

On AM powered ship:
1 auto critical, 19 damage rolls
Results:
Maneuver Drive Disabled
Jump Drive Disabled
Ship Vaporized
Fuel Tanks Shattered
Crew-4
Weapon-10
Computer-5
Screens-7
Power Plant-2

In short, it\'s real dead, and would be regardless of what kind of fuel it had.

On NH3 powered ship:
1 auto critical, 19 damage rolls
Results:
Boat Deck Destroyed
Jump Drive Disabled
Spinal Mount Out
One Screen Disabled
Fuel Tanks Shattered
Crew-4
Computer-2
Power Plant-8

This one is didn\'t blow up, but it might as well have. The crew is all dead,
and it has a factor-2 power plant left. And maybe it _did_ blow up. Remember
that all Alliance battleships have bays for up to five planetbusters. If this
one happened to be carrying a planetbuster, the boat deck hit would take it
out--and 5 tonnes of AM going up in a sympathetic detonation can ruin your
whole day.

The moral of the story is that it\'s misleading to criticize AM ships as
vulnerable to lucky one-shot kills. Sure, they are, but so are all other
ships. In fact, AM ships are _less_ vulnerable because they\'re generally
harder to get the lucky hit on in the first place!

Well the calculation would give MJ cm-2.  The Rules however deal with
the energy (discharge energy, DE) that is focused on some area of the
target (the total delivered energy being the area of the beam (crosss
sectional) times the energy/area (or time times energy density).

You would *not* want to multiply by the sphere\'s area, the delivered
energy (non-focused) would drop off as 1/r^2, not increase as r^2.

To get the delivered energy you\'d have to know the thickness of the
propagating shell of energy (the explosion duration would give a rough
value for this, if multiplied by c).

I think you\'ve been misplacing exponents.  1 ton of antimatter is 1000 kg,
with a mass energy of 1000x9e16 joules.  (E=mc^2)  This is 9e19 J or
9e13 MJ.  At 4e15 joules to a megaton, this is about 20,000 Megatons.  This
explosion has 10x the danger space as one 100x as small, 200 Megatons.
I believe the largest nuclear explosion ever was a russian test at about
100 Megatons.  Thus, a ton of antimatter won\'t destroy the sector, but it
shouldn\'t have a problem vaporizing the ship.

At one hex range = 3e7 meters this delivers about 1MJ per square METER.  this
would toast a human, but superdense is safe.  This stuff is probably more
trouble than its worth.  Just research better fusion power.  Less fuss, free
fuel, no pesky detonantion....

This underbarrel laser (a.k.a. Laser Launcher) is primarily used by Ninja
Cartel troops in Shadigi subsector (Diaspora). It is usually placed under
the barrel of SMG. As the power pack is heavy, usually only one trooper in
the squad carries the laser. It is very effective against unarmored troops
and when combined with ROF 5 SMG for auto fire, it is quite frightening
weapon.

It seems to me that you have understood the rules right except that
a weapon with pen nil can penetrate an environment suit with AV 0.
And it is true that you need more than an ordinary weapon to penetrate
Battle Dress, but hey that\'s the point of having a battle dress anyway.
Besides my players sometimes complain that the armors in TNE are not so
effective as they would like because they only have BC armors (or is it PC
armor ?).

RC troops use variety of weapons but I think one of the most common weapon
is ACR.

I have to say that in one occasion I found that pen value was too low. It was
when one of my PCs was covering behind a tree (30 cm thick) and was fired
by 7mm assault rifle and the bullets couldn\'t penetrate the tree. Well, I
guess those bullets weren\'t full metal jacket bullets.

I hope this helped you at least a bit.

First, in space I don\'t believe that even 50% of the antimatter will react
since the explosion will blow most of it out into space, away from ordinary
matter but for the sake of arguement I\'ll take your value.

Secondly you have to add in the energy of the matter which it reacts with
since this is converted too. ie. 500kg antimatter+500kg matter => \'m\'=1000kg
Thus the actually energy is :

		E=1000c^2 (=9E19 J)

Now for the moment let\'s forget any cobbled together physics they have put in
FF&S and do a real world calculation. Area of a sphere at 1 lightsecond:

		A=4.pi.c^2

Hence neglecting energy lost due to neutrino production (which won\'t interact
with matter very well) we get and intensity of :

		I=1000/(4.pi)=79.6 Jm^-2

This is not a lot, certainly not enough to penetrate any sort of armour.
>From this we can conclude that:

	(i)  FF&S doesn\'t know what it\'s talking about when it comes
             to physics

and/or	(ii) The values you are using are for beam weapons where the
             energy is channeled in a particular direction, not randomly
             over an entire sphere

To put the above calculation in perspective the sun converts around 5 tons
of matter into energy every second and yet the earth is still here.

Hope that helps - antimatter is dangerous, but not THAT dangerous!

  I\'ll double check my numbers.  Still, keep in mind this is per ton, and
most Alliance ships carry dozens of tons.  I\'ll re-calc and see what
happens based on the surface area fixit.

A docking ring sounds more like a depression in the hull in which
the carried craft rests.  If you\'ve ever read _Downbelow Station_
by C.J. Cherryh (highly recommended), there is a drawing at the
beginning (done to the author\'s specifications) showing the Battle
Carrier Norway and its Riderships.  (Guess where GDW got the idea
for Battle Riders in the first place).

The Riders are shown sort of imbedded in the hull of the carrier, but
not completely contained within it.

I think that\'s what they mean.

This is more of a "two-body" thing.  If one is really "carrying" the
other, then it\'s more like an external grapple.

There are some math errors.  For one thing, I think your units are off.

Say we convert one ton of matter to energy.  Energy == mass * c squared.
Energy is in Joules.  Mass is in kilograms.  Lightspeed is in meters per
second.

E == 1000 kg * (3 * 10^8 m/s)^2
  == 9 * 10^19 J
  == 9 * 10^13 MJ

One megaton TNT == about 4.2 * 10^15 J of energy (sci.space FAQ)
                == about 0.05 kg of matter -> energy

So the blast is roughly equivalent to 21 gigatons of TNT.

Ships at the edge of a one-tenth light-second sphere would take

                       9 * 10^13 MJ
  E per cm^2 ==  ---- == 3.2 Joules/(cm^2)
                 4 * pi * (1.5 * 10^9 cm)^2

Anybody spot any errors with this?

thanks for your answer. But...

I think, the whole systems doesn\'t take into account that not only
armor protection but also weapon effectiveness will improve.  If you
compare a TL7 G3 (it was introduced 1968 I think) with an TL 12 body
protection it\'s no wonder that this armor will protect its wearer.  If
you however use a TL 12 G8 (to give it a name), I expect that its
rounds will penetrate.  I\'m no expert but I think there\'ll be enough
room for improvements (for example to use other metal or ceramics for
the round or other explosives with more power or mix up the right
chemicals to melt the armor and so on)

>         AV 4 = side armor of M113 APC.
>         AV 6 = front armor of M113 APC, LAV-25

If that M133 APC is the same M113 armored personal transport tank I
know, then a G3 is able to penetrate its armor (12 mm aluminium) at
short range.

My dream-weapon (feel free to design it :-): I think that TL12 G8
should be able to penetrate any low-tech (6-10) armor, doing about 5
dice damage with `normal\' 9x50 mm ammunition, having a size about 76
cm and weighting about 3 kg.  (I think weapons will became lighter to
reduce their encumbrance) The extended version for shooting HEAP etc
could be as heavy as 6 kg (about the weight of a G3, I suggest)

As it was an error of Traveller to think that 1970 computer technology
will not change about the centuries, it is an error to think the same
about weapon technology.

Lasers are another point.  They are completely useless in relation to
their TL.  If a TL 13 laser can\'t wound a TL12 soldier, I don\'t need
it.  I would say, without special ablative armor, lasers will
penetrate all conventional armor.  And ablative armor will be damaged
(melted) due lasers, so it only offer a temporary protection.

That\'s another point. Armor can\'t be damaged.  You can walk in your AV
6 battle suit over a battlefield full of machine gun fire and all you
notice are some nasty bee stings.  Not that permanent gun fire would
slowly damage and penetrate your amor -- no it will look as good as
when you bought it (going with the rules -- of course as a referee I
would correct this. I only what to show this rules leak here)

>I haven\'t playtested the combat rules yet, but they look reasonable,
>and they\'ve undergone several generations of shaking out (these
>are an evolution of the T2K-C&D-DC combat rules).  Hope this helps
>you sort things out.

I too thought that the rules _looks_ good -- but maybe you should try
them yourself.  T2K is a current day fire fight game, with very
different intention as an (hard) SF game.  Of course, a AV 6 trooper
on a battle field today would survive probably any hit by small arms
but that shouldn\'t be true when weapon TL raise.

As I sidenote: I could start thinking that the TNE rules _want_ to
allow players to wear perfect-protection (tm :-) armors and to allow
them to "have a good boody fight" again hordes of NPCs whose weapons
can\'t harm the PCs.  But if that\'s the only thing for what the
designers thought TNE is good, roleplaying is lost. A fire fight isn\'t
roleplaying at all IMHO.

Perhaps it\'s the idea that at high TL all troops will look like
StarWars stoorm troopers or that guys that are shown RC Equipment
Guide (with a AV 6 light battle dress) that is wrong.  But I think,
it\'s not me but the combat system... :-)

So, if there anybody out here who as the same problems as I -- without
talking about what ideas are \'more realistic\' -- and as some solutions
other that using classic traveller (with a also not good combat
system), please reply.

thanks for your attention,
bye.

Regency worlds, as well as the Florian League.  And that interesting,
ex-Imperial world of Tobia, with it\'s Human/Aslan Clans.

Finally: consider that the Aslan New Lords are right next to a cross-Rift
route to thousands of unclaimed lands, just waiting to be taken.  The
older Aslan have earned their glory fighting Virus, but the younger males
(The Brand New Lords) want to reclaim all that free land....  I\'m
nearly certain that the Aslan have been sending out scouts since the

THOSE modules qualify as "grapples" in TNE/FF&S terms.

A docking ring is where the subordinate craft practically "plugs in"
into the ship, like on Broadswords.  Even when the craft is gone,
the structure it docks to still takes up space.

For those who have it, the Rock from Expedition to Zhodane docked
Pebble in a similar manner.

A liberal interpretation of the definition of "docking ring" includes
circumstances where (in absolute terms) the subordinate craft is
actually partially exposed.

(This interpretation came up on the GDW-Beta list, regarding the
docking of the AHL\'s fuel shuttles.  It really doesn\'t make sense to
leave vital, thin-skinned shuttles OUTSIDE the ship\'s armor, but the
traditional AHL design did just that.  The patch for this glitch was
to allow the ventral groove of the AHL, where the shuttles dock, to
qualify as a docking ring rather than as an external grapple arrangemnet)

    Sorry, I didn\'t make myself clear.  I was saying that hitting an AM
powered starship wouldn\'t just kill the target, it\'d kill anything within
several thousand kilometers of it.  The potential for collateral damage is
massive.

    I\'ll try and re-run the math on the 1-ton thing again, taking into
account the corrections people have suggested today.  See you later...

 Other people said much the same sort of thing in that digest,

 Incidentally, Steve Higginbotham\'s suggestion of using internal
 armor to protect the Antimatter Plant from damage is very good.
 Even though the plant is hard to hit, its\' small size makes it
 a good candidate for thick internal armor.

 Another note:  AM8: _Darrians_ states that experimental TL17
 antimatter plants on Darrian and Mire both detonated due to
 the effects of the Maghiz.  (Flare on Darrian, electronic
 effects and maintenance failures on Mire.)  Not like they

There are some math errors.  For one thing, I think your units are off.

Say we convert one ton of matter to energy.  Energy == mass * c squared.
Energy is in Joules.  Mass is in kilograms.  Lightspeed is in meters per
second.

E == 1000 kg * (3 * 10^8 m/s)^2
  == 9 * 10^19 J
  == 9 * 10^13 MJ

One megaton TNT == about 4.2 * 10^15 J of energy (sci.space FAQ)
                == about 0.05 kg of matter -> energy

So the blast is roughly equivalent to 21 gigatons of TNT.

Ships on the surface of a one-tenth light-second diameter sphere
centered on the explosion would take

                       9 * 10^13 MJ
  E per cm^2 ==  ---- == 3.2 Joules/(cm^2)
                 4 * pi * (1.5 * 10^9 cm)^2


[That\'s MJ divided by the surface area of a one-tenth light-second
 diameter sphere, with 0.1 light-second == 3 * 10^9 cm.  These
 are real-world calculations throughout, although not insanely
 rigorous.

 If you look at E == m * c^2, c^2 is a constant, so that the
 amount of energy released is directly proportional to the amount
 of mass converted.  A ten-metric ton conversion is a blast with
 a 210 gigaton TNT release.  A one gram conversion is a 20 kiloton
 TNT energy release.]

Anybody spot any errors with this?

penetrations, and consistantly calculating in MKS until that last division of

3. If we say that the danger zone for a warship is within the 1 MJ/cm^2

(which would represent a pretty nasty attack on surface features if nothing

about 40km.

4.   The last alliance ship I recall seeing had 377 tonnes of AM on board.
That
works out to about a 750 km danger zone.

5.   SO if you have AM in your fleet, dispersion becomes VERY important to
avoid

My opinion is it should be *both*.  The Alliance ships using AM

Here\'s a rifle design I posted a while back. It fits this description more or
less...

                 Assault Rifle, Caseless, Model 5610

Notes: The ARC-10 is produced by a variety of companies throughout the
Alliance. The design is simply an evolutionary development of the Heckler and
Koch G11, developed on the twentieth century. The ARC-10 fires a powerful
discarding-sabot round intended to be lethal even through light power armour.
Unlike the G11, the ARC-10 has no auto-fire capability. It has an integral
laser sight and an electronic sight in the carrying handle. The ARC-10 is the
most widely-used service rifle in the Alliance, with over 300 million
manufactured to date. In addition to the Alliance Planetary Forces, it is
used by the Alliance Marine Corps, the Neubayern, Browne, and Tisilli
Skywatches, the NeuBerlin Metropolitan Police Force, and a variety of smaller
police forces in the Alliance. The ARC-10 has been widely exported to
friendly powers in the Trojan Reach.

but the basic design is TL8.

Sort of. The Alliance is most active in the Trojan Reach, but I won\'t be
using the standard TNE universe (Virus, etc.).

Okay, that sounds more reasonable. The next question is: what does 1MJ/cm^2
mean in terms of High Guard damage?

Following the Cluster Liberation War, the Alliance Navy looked at adding
meson screens to its warships, but decided that they weren\'t worth the
(considerable) energy expenditure. The big meson guns that the Alliance was
most worried about would only be stopped by meson screens around 1/6 of the
time, so the Alliance decided instead to rely on high agility and long-range
weapons. Also, meson screens block meson communications, and the Alliance was
more interested in secure communications than slightly improved defenses.
When AM ships (with effectively unlimited power available) came along, meson
screens were omitted because the Navy had gotten along okay without them so
far. 

Some officers in the Alliance Navy have argued that the usefullness of
agility and better range as a replacement for meson screens is overrated, but
to date Alliance warships have gotten along without them.

So this would suggest that a semi-recessed installation would be an
external grapple?

So vehicles docked in docking rings will not enjoy the mothercraft\'s
armor?  And can I safely assume that with the exception of the
connecting airlocks, cargo doors, and refueling hatch the docking ring
is unpressurized?

I\'m working on some design specs -- look for them in a few days. But
don\'t restrict me to 9x50mm ammo; that\'s a rather arbitrary restriction.
Reframe the spec in terms of allowable recoil for the round and how
many rounds of fire are conventient for a soldier to carry (i.e., 
X turns of fire worth of magazines & cartridges should weigh Y kilos
or less).

True.  I\'ve already incorporated Lahti\'s suggested modifiers to receiver &
barrel weight for advanced materials.  I will be tossing out a suggested
modification to his table, however; keep an eye out for it.

Also true.  I haven\'t examined the small arms laser design sequence in 
detail yet -- it is possible that the example weapons were badly designed.

Basic physics give you a problem that gun designers have been trying
to work around for almost exactly 100 years --  more power behind the 
bullet means more recoil means less accuracy in automatic fire mode.
Remember "Every action has an equal and opposite reaction"?  Applied
to a rocket, that gets you off the ground.  Applied to a bullet, that means
recoil momentum must equal the momentum of the bullet --> m*v
More mass (m) to the gun means less velocity (v) to the recoil to 
satisfy the equation -- but more mass for the soldier to lug around.
Alternatively, you can put that (v) to work doing something besides
kicking your shoulder and pushing the barrel up -- cycling the receiver,
or whatever.  We still haven\'t been able to get rid of all of it.

So, okay, maybe you can up impact energy without increasing recoil
or weapon weight excessively.  There is still a fairly solid limit of max.
possible mass per unit volume (depleted uranium penetrators, until
someone finds a cheap source of iridium or osmium, or invents some
exotic superdense material a lot denser than Trav\'s "superdense") 
times max. feasible velocity in atmosphere (i.e., where the penetrator
material burns up from atmospheric friction).  This limit is rather high...

No, but it\'s a lot of fun :-)  Why do you assume that the *usual* case
will be PCs wearing & using cutting edge military hardware vs. the 
usual underequipped NPCs?  The other way around is much more
challenging...  In our Imperial-era games, and even more ancient
pre-Spinward Marches CT games (i.e., GM-designed "Pocket 
Empire" about 12 years ago...), the PCs usually had flak jackets at
best, and one or two ex-Army/Marine goons with CE suits and an
ACR or Gauss Rifle plus RAM grenade launcher.  They were considered
heavily armed.  (And watch out for lunatics firing HEAP grenades 
INSIDE starships...they punch holes in bulkheads :-(  )

Well, it was in at the local gamestore here in New Orleans, LA when I picked 
it up Thursday.

Things that stand out:

(1) GDW needs to hire a real editor, like Steve Jackson Games has.

(2) "Undercity" : good idea, incoherent presentation.  Should have been
sent back to the author with instructions to polish up the rough draft he
submitted.
At the very least, a "Referee\'s Synopsis" should be mandatory.

(3) "Operation: Wolf Snare" : a minor nitpick -- why is the RC all that concerned 
about alienating 5000 whole people on a jerkwater planet?  Macon, MS has more
people than that, and Congress doesn\'t seem all that concerned about alienating
THEM.  Grabbing the Corsair, that might be worthwhile, if they\'re all that desperate
for ships.  But, if the RC is that desperate for ships, why doesn\'t Oriflamme (which 
is so proud of its vast hordes of people) build shipyards and start churning ships out?
Okay, so the scenario isn\'t about RC politics.  With some minor reworking, it would
make a great "Lost Worlds Romance".  We already have a "native princess" in the
form of Orchid...

(4) "Karel Rossum" : anyone else catch the joke in his name?  Clue: look up the 
origin of the word "robot".  Nifty character.

(5) "The Long Fall Club" : Gee, should I pull my punches because this is by a fellow
TMLer?  NAHHH!

George, just WHERE is Mikkadhir?  Coordinates in the standard form would be
nice.  Or is this a "drop-in anywhere suitable" sort of place?  If so, you should say so
up front for the benefit of the slower-witted, like myself.  This adventure is one of the
"The NPC patron not only tells you what the mission is, but tells you how to do it" type; I
don\'t like those.  It doesn\'t give the PCs a chance to decide what to do beyond which door
to go in -- roll your dice and move your mice.  It would be a better scenario if the PCs
were allowed to offer their own plans of attack, and save the default NPC plan for if the PCs
fail to come up with a decent plan.  Oh yes, GDW lost your sidebar on re-entry kits.
       Minor nitpicks: How did Ms.Sweeney get off-planet if the TED stole her ship? How does
the inserting ship get close enough to insert you on a re-entry vector without being detected
by the advanced orbital sensor net?  You know, the one that keeps even small craft from 
slipping through undetected.  If there are so few soldiers in the military that the gate guard
"knows everyone in the military by sight", how can they patrol the entire inhabited area?
If there are that few soldiers, why don\'t we just shoot them all and steal the ships unopposed?
(Steve says I should ask you "If the ships are so important to Ms.Sweeney, why isn\'t she
coming along?") How about some stats on the planet?  Not everyone has whatever
supplement this place appears in (if it does), and you should state prominently what
supplements are required to referee this at the beginning of the scenario...
End George harassment.

(6) "Core subsector" - translate 2300AD 3-D Near Space map into standard 2D Traveller
Hex grid.  Pointless waste of two pages.

(7) "The Madness Effect" - good generic Traveller scenario.  I see the author cleverly
made it a New Era scenario by inserting the word "Coalition" in the appropriate places,
and making the origination & destination worlds Eos & Aubaine.  Can actually be 
dropped in anywhere people use jump drive. It\'s refreshing to see a TNE scenario
that does NOT have a Virus or TED or both in it.

(8) FF&S Errata - badly needed. Should correct some of the more spectacular design
"anomalies".  Everyone, read and pencil into your copy of FF&S!  (Steve says the guys
who wrote the errata obviously didn\'t read the errata as one section says to round weapon
short ranges to nearest 10m, and another section gives ranges like 61, 81, etc.)

(9) "Oasis in a New Era" - Anybody remember the Ducy of Oasis from the Shattered
Imperium era?  It\'s baaack!   A nice little pocket empire; large enough to be plausible,
not so huge as to dominate the former Imperial Core in the face of all comers, the way
a certain other "pocket" Empire from the TNE book will.  Unfortunately, it\'s by the same
author that "Undercity" was, and suffers from the same incoherent presentation.  GDW
still needs an editor that knows how to EDIT.

I hope you won\'t take offense at this, Erich, but that\'s a bit like saying:
"If there\'s any people that knows how sail wooden ships and rob and plunder,
it\'s the Danes." The Maghiz was a couple of millenia ago. I suspect that
the Darrians are just minding their own business. What i wonder is what
their relationship with the Sword Worlds are at present.

Constructive criticism always accepted here 8-).

It\'s supposed to be a drop-in-place-anywhere.  My appologies to the
slower-witted in our readership ;-)

I agree, that\'s something I wasn\'t 100% happy with in the version that I

That\'s a secret.  There is a reasonable explanation, but it doesn\'t affect
the story in any way, and the RCES don\'t want to talk about it.
Basically, if you really want to know, Sweeney\'s ship being captured was
offset by a 100-ton Scout which was vaporized by a nuclear missile launched
from the fighter which pulled her out of the boonies after her ship was
captured... (She camped out for a month until RCES sent someone else in
to look because she was overdue...).

On a 8000 km diameter world, the safe entry vector should be 100km or so wide,
and 100 diameters from the world is around 800,000 km away.  If the ship can
not hold its course straight to better than 1 part in 10,000, then it\'s not
doing as well as existing TL8 space navigation systems 8-)  This should be
no problem.

There\'s around a battalion of them, if I remember right.  That\'s few enough that
the ones who pull starport duty should know each other by sight.

They\'re not that few...

>(Steve says I should ask you "If the ships are so important to Ms.Sweeney,

Because there are posters with her face and LARGE REWARD IF CAPTURED
in all the local post offices, making any sort of skulking difficult
and more dangerous than usual 8-)

It\'s a drop-it-in-place, make the rest of the planet what you want.
It\'s a little inconsistent not to have given a baseline world, but I
didn\'t really have one in mind.

>End George harassment.

In defense, this was origionally written in early 1993, back before any
of us knew how TNE actually looked.  (Actually, it was _origionally_
written for MT and the civil war era, but then GDW stopped accepting
non-TNE materials and I adapted...).  A lot of things were vague because
when I wrote it I didn\'t know what TNE was going to look like.
All I knew of RCES when I wrote it was what was in the main TNE
rulebook, none of the suppliments.  The ship strength of the RCES was
a total unknown, among other things... with as many ships as RCES actually
has, I\'m not sure the scenario as written rings true.  In addition to the
uncertainty as to some TNE background details, I also had to adapt the
origional idea a lot, and managed to (I think, not sure if I did a final
edit and fixed them or not...) leave a few bits of the origional which
shouldn\'t have stayed.  Mea Culpa.  I have up and down articles... 8-)

No, docking rings DO allow the docked ship to be protected

As for pressurization, correct, they are unpressurized.

DESIGNER\'S NOTES:

K\'kree Accomodations
  672 kL; 48 tons; 0.012 MW; MCr 1.
K\'kree Airlocks
  36 kL; 2.4 tons; 0.012 MW; MCr 0.06; 20 square meters.
K\'kree Workstations (TL13)
  168/84 kL; 0.2 tons; MCr 0.002.

For each K\'kreer! not carried, 672 cubic meters of cargo may be carried
instead.  Presumably, the open quarters have some sort of concealed
"blast door" system in the ceiling or floor to seal off small portions
of the ship if the hull is somehow breached.

The Xeekr\'kir! was intended only for travel by small herds within K\'kree
civilization.  Unlike human starships, civilian K\'kree ships that travel
within the Two Thousand Worlds often carry no navigator, but rely on the
use of pre-recorded jump co-ordinates available from most starports.

To keep the crew size small, this ship uses two maneuver drives:  a 1G
fusion rocket for use outside of atmosphere, and a small 0.05G HEPlaR
system which in conjunction with the contragrav is used for takeoffs
and landings with an approximate 0.04G performance in an effectively
0.01G gravity field.  The fusion rocket is used to kill most of the
ship\'s vector before the landing system is activated.  The hull is
only stressed for 1G, but the drives are rated for normal thrust
figures (FRkt == 60000 TT; HEPlaR == 3000 TT), so the HEPlaR will in
actuality get about twice better than rated performance in most cases.

Peak power output is held down to 1224 MW.  If the fusion rocket is in
operation, the power plant is throttled back and engineering crew are
tranferred to rocket operation.

The K\'kree have the technical capability to build better ships than
this, but they have a conservative approach to technology.  This ship
is fairly sophisticated for K\'kree space.  (This suggests that many
civilian K\'kree vessels with archaic computers will survive the TNE
virus.)

This design illustrates some K\'kree difficulties with interstellar
travel.  The ship above is roughly the equivalent to a K\'kree Far Trader,
and it is possibly cramped by civilian K\'kree standards.  It\'s about
the smallest civilian K\'kree starship size possible.

along with grav plates we get inertial compensators (which appear to work by

Stefan, in someways I agree with you, but in CT the combat environment
suit was the standard for line troops from its introduction at tech level
10 through 13. At 13 combat armor becomes the norm. Lasers are considered
to be usful only for target ranging and designation, and some sort of slug
thrower being the combat arm of choice. Which IMHO is the way it should
be.

On a side note to make lasers a lot nastier, you could give them a healthy
chance to blind the target on any head shot.

In the other ablative armor is one of the things I miss from CT.
Mr.Kundert and I dicussed this, we came up with a varation based somewhat
on the mecanic presented in MT. Ablative armor absorbs say 9 damage dice
on the first hit in that location, 8 the next, and so on. Haven\'t come up
with the details on weight or price as yet thou.

Here\'s my quick fix for damage to armor, first figure out the damage
normaly, roll the damage, and on any 6 reduce the AV by 1, then roll the
nonpenatrating dice and do the same as above.

As for the combat system in general it works very well in play, I my
experience it has realality to make it feel real, while not so much as to
slow down the game.(I don\'t know about the rest of y\'all, but tempo is one
of the things I relish) In vetting out the combat system I found that
blunt trauma was more significant than seems mentioned in this forum. More
than once firefights in which Battledress was worn by any combatant, the
Battledress drew more fire and even though the a lot of the shots did not
penatrate, the poor shmuck wearing it had to be poured out. When weapons
that could penatrate where used, it generally was the case of "one shot
one kill", not always a death, but a definate mission kill.

On other topics, does anyone remeber where, if at all, what EM signiture
was assocated with breakout from Jump now that the lanthum hull grid is
non-canon?

OK.  Any idea what proportion?


Anyway, I think that we agree that:

1. AM is a more hazardous power source than fusion.

2. AM is too damn useful: doctrine will be developed to take advantage of its
energy while minimizing the risks.  (Personally, I think there are going to be
some nasty incidents while the bugs get worked out of the doctrine).

Is it worth working out some sort of a damage curve for an AM explosion?  Taking
into account a "long flare" model, the neutrino component of the reaction, and
the heavy particle flux from the unconverted matter and AM, including secondary
radiation from the AM flux encountering target ship hull?  Lots of work, but
would it be worth it?

I have examined them.  The lasers were designed in a manner typical
of the way GDW designs the examples they offer.  Mediocre.  But,
unfortunately, you still can\'t get a reasonable small arms laser to
have a non-nil penetration.

I tried *everything*.  I tried high-drain (enhanced output) betteries.
I tried PFC\'s (!), I tried both of the standard methods.  I even
looked at PNF.

The best I came up with was a straight DEI laser.  It\'s mass (plus
battery, HPG, and cooling system), came out to something like 68 kg.

This was the smallest thing I could build with a non-nil penetration.

And it had a ROF of 1.

It doesn\'t even make a good Squad Support Weapon.

The only advantages to it were:

1)  You could fire it about 300 times without recharge (!)...  This
didn\'t contribute much to the mass (it was the goddamned COOLING
SYSTEM and the stinkin\' HPG), so it didn\'t seem to hurt much to allow
a large "magazine".

2)  Anyone you hit with it was *COOKED*, even someone in Battledress.

Trouble is, use it once and guess who\'s everyone\'s number 1 target?

Partially correct.  The Riders in the Union/Alliance stories served
two purposes:  Combat, and Target Acquisition.  Much of the combat
took place at relativistic speeds, which made for serious fire-control
nightmares.  Having a couple of your Riderships between you and the
enemy gave you a much easier time.  Sure, the information your riders
pass you will be as out of date (by the time it gets to you) as your
own sensor data, but it will be much more precise.

In combat in these stories, ship armor was pretty much like butter.
You needed a big Carrier for lots of firepower, but mostly for
the ability to carry lots of supplies, the ability to do lots of
repairs and replacement of parts, etc.  And to do this over a long
period between rests.  But a couple of decent hits would knock out
a big Carrier pretty easily.  So small riders became feasible, and
big riders became stupid.

Re:  Rider Tenders vs.  Battle Carriers.

I never said that *they* were parallel.  The Battle Carrier goes
into combat.  Once in combat, it tapdances like crazy to avoid
getting hit!

>(I\'m a big Cherryh fan, by the way, even if she doesn\'t seem to
>understand special relativity sometimes.)

Well, she\'s proposing a drive which is inertialess.  Unfortunately,
if that were the case, the people inside wouldn\'t feel any G\'s.
So she\'s mixing metaphors, to say the least.

I wouldn\'t expect anyone who writes good fiction to understand
(or pay heed to) special relativity 8^).  If s/he wants 10,000 Gs of
inertialess acceleration, go for it!  It\'s really the only thing
that makes the warships in her stories any better than the armed
merchants.

Here\'s a summary I wrote and posted to the XTML a while back. Some of the
info here has since been rewritten, but this still gives the general idea. A
real FAQ is on my list of things to do--but not high on it, I\'m afraid. :-)

The Alliance is an outgrowth of a TCS pbem game Steve Higginbotham ran. The
game was based on the "Island Cluster" from the TCS book, which is located in
subsectors J and K of the Reft Sector. In the pbem game, the Alliance was
formed by group of countries in the Old Islands subsector (Reft K), plus a
small one from the New Islands (Reft J). After several years of game time,
the game ended in 5631 AD (1110 Imperial). At this time, the Serendip Belt,
one of the major non-Alliance powers, kicked off a major war which drove most
of the other countries into the Alliance, and cost over 10 billion lives
(including almost all the Serendip Belt folks).

At this time the pbem game ended, with Steve indicating that the Imperium was
about to send the whole Corridor Fleet in to annex the Cluster. At the time
the game ended, Amondiage, a non-Alliance (but friendly) country, had been
fighting a war with the Imperium--and winning, up to that point. When the
Amondiage Navy destroyed Cyril (the local Imperial capital) with an
antimatter bomb, the Emperor himself stepped in and decided to annex the
whole Cluster.

I\'d previously decided that the background being developed in the pbem game
was much more interesting (not to mention believeable) than that "Virus"
crap, so I decided to work out what happened next. I\'ve set a "start date" of
5650 AD (1129 Imperial) for role-playing campaigns set in this background,
and have been working along with others from the game (mostly Steve) to work
out the "future" of the Alliance. So far, it goes something like this:

The Alliance in 5631 doesn\'t have any hope of beating the Corridor Fleet. The
Alliance and Amondiage (which was by that time almost a de facto member) had
an extremely active R&D community, and had developed or were in the process
of developing technology that would give their ships a big advantage over the
Imperium. Unfortunately, most of the new technology was at best only in the
prototype stage. To buy time, the Alliance and Amondiage decided to pretend
surrender to the Corridor Fleet.

Three worlds in the Old Islands (New Home, Sansterre, and Amondiage) had
defenses capable of holding back even a major Imperial attack for many years.
These three became the "safe worlds." All the new technology was moved to
these worlds, along with the Alliance\'s best ships and personnel, and all
records of the new technology on the other worlds (and there wasn\'t much) was
either removed or destroyed. A recent addition to the Alliance, Joyeuse,
pretended to go over to the Imperium and would act as a sort of Imperial
surrogate during the Occupation.

The plan was that the safe worlds would refit the old ships with the new
technology, and build new ones. When the ships were ready, the Alliance Navy
would sortie from the safe worlds (and the Joyeuse Navy would turn on its
supposed allies) and drive out the Impies. The plan was somewhat desperate,
and had plenty of room for failure, but it was all the Alliance Council could
think of--and events elsewhere helped it work.

In the GDW history, the Corridor Fleet played a key role in driving back the
Zhodani attack on Rhylanor during the Fifth Frontier War. That didn\'t happen
here. Instead, although the Zhodani still got pushed back, their 40th Fleet
made it home intact and the Zhodani were ready for another try a few years
later. The Sixth Frontier War was only the start of the Imperium\'s troubles
though. In addition, the Solomani took grave exception to the invasion of the
Island Cluster, since it\'s the only known enclave of "ethnically pure"
Solomani anywhere in the galaxy--they expressed their disapproval by kicking
off the Second Solomani Rim War. On top of all that, the Aslan had been
skirmishing with the Imperials in the Trojan Reach for some time.

As a result of all this pressure, the Imperium withdrew most of its garrison
forces from the Islands in 5640. The local commanders had reported that the
locals where up to something, but the whole area had been quiet, there was no
proof, and the top brass were at that point more concerned about trying to
keep back the Zhodani and Solomani.

As soon as the bulk of the Imperial force withdrew, the Alliance moved. The
Cluster Liberation War was just the sort of quick and brutal onslaught that
the Alliance Navy favored, resulting in the remaining occupation forces being
crushed in less than a month. The Imperial Navy tried to counterattack with
forces drawn from Gushmege, but the Alliance had found their staging area and
hit it. The CLW ended in a total victory for the Alliance.

The Imperials could have retaken the Alliance if they\'d tried hard enough,
but they didn\'t. Doing so would have called for a massive diversion of ships
from the other fronts, which would have allowed the Zhodani and Imperium to
make substantial inroads into Imperial territory. More than that, though, the
Cluster Liberation War had broken the morale of the Imperial Navy personnel
who had been involved. The Alliance had hit them so hard, so fast, and with
such sophisticated weapons, that the Imperium had lost enough ships to make
up a Fleet without inflicting _any_ losses on their enemies. The Impies were
simply terrified of the Alliance Navy.

The Alliance told the Imperium that they wanted only to be free, and were
willing to end the war--the Emperor, with other crises demanding his Naval
resources, agreed. The Alliance had expanded after the CLW to include all the
Island Cluster systems except Topas, and slowly expanded to include some of
the systems between the Islands, the Trojan Reach, and the Riftspan Reaches.
During this period (which lasted through 5644) the Alliance Free Trade
Agreement was increasing the Alliance Navy\'s budget in leaps and bounds, and
new ships were being built. Aslan immigrants were also being invited in, with
over 300 million Aslan arriving in the first two years.

In 5645 the spinward border of the Alliance (which was technically a
federation by this point) was at Browne, the new technology was fully
implemented, and Alliance naval budget had just broken Cr40 trillion. The
Alliance Council decided to implement its long-term strategy for dealing with
the Imperium, which called for fighting (and winning) a small skirmish with
the Imperium every so often to keep the Imperial Navy afraid of the Alliance
and convinced that the Alliance was a deadly opponent. It would be a delicate
balancing act, though, because the Alliance couldn\'t push the Imperium hard
enough to start a major war (which the Alliance would lose).

The Sarage system (Trojan Reach 2938) was an Imperial client state, and held
an Imperial Naval base established to watch over the route across the
Riftspan Reaches. The Alliance wanted the system, which would complete a
route for ships equipped with Helson-Canomaar Overdrive between the Island
Cluster and the main Aslan territory.

Alliance Intelligence prepared the arena by secretly meeting with the Sarage
government, telling them about the generosity of the Alliance (members
routinely tossed around huge sums to aid the development of less advanced
systems) and pointing out that the Alliance Navy could protect the system
much more effectively than the Imperium could. The goal of these preparations
was to help the locals realize they\'d be better off under the Alliance, a
goal which was reached rather easily--the Imperium didn\'t even help out its
own worlds, let alone clients.

On March 15, 5645, Alliance Navy TF11 (led by Fleet Admiral Sir Isaac Connor,
the Alliance\'s best commander) entered the system and attacked the CruRon
stationed there. The Battle of Sarage ended in 20 minutes with only Imperial
couriers escaping intact. The couriers made it to Tobia with a report on the
performance of the Alliance ships. Imperial Intelligence analyzed it, and
realized that the force seen in TF11 was more than the local forces could
handle.

A message was fired off to the HQ of the Spinward Marches Fleet, but before
any response (or help) could get back, TF11 itself showed up in orbit around
Tobia. The Imperial Navy had begun to gather forces in Tobia, but there
weren\'t enough. After establishing control over the system, FAdm Connor
delivered the Alliance\'s terms for ending the war--give up claim to Sarage,
and end the war now, and the Alliance would repatriate all prisoners, return
all ships captured intact (there were a few hulks left), and pay the
replacement cost of the dead CruRon. FAdm Connor also showed the Imperial
Duke the full planetbuster bay aboard his flagship, the _Sansterre_.

The Duke new a good offer when he saw one. Sarage wasn\'t exactly a vital
strategic interest of the Imperium, and it wasn\'t often that someone offered
to pay for ships destroyed in battle. The Sarage Campaign ended with Sarage a
new Alliance Protectorate, and the Imperial Navy once again convinced that
the Alliance people where all ten feet tall.

The Alliance continued to expand in the Trojan Reach, adding two new
Associate Members and five new Protectorates in the next two years. In 5648,
Tisilli (Trojan Reach 2137) became a full member of the Alliance--the first
high population world to join since Browne became a member in 5641. The Navy
budget had broken Cr80 trillion, and ships from the massive post-CLW building
program where joining the fleet in increasing numbers. The Imperium was
starting to get an edge over the Zhodani, and the Alliance Council decided to
start a new skirmish to keep the Impies off balance.

This one would be a bit more serious. The Alliance Navy was much stronger
now, and wanted to seriously disrupt the Imperium\'s war efforts so that the
Zhodani could regain the initiative. The target was Quiver (Reft 2534), a
world on the edge of Imperial space which had asked to become an Alliance
Protectorate. Quiver\'s people had decided that they\'d be better off as part
of the Alliance, and the Alliance hoped that helping them would make other
Imperial worlds think about seceeding.

Quiver declared its independence from the Imperium on June 8, 5648 (1127
Imperial), and requested Protectorate status from the Alliance. By
"coincidence," Alliance TF23 showed up the next day. TF23 chased the ships at
the IISS base out of the system, and settled down to wait. A courier was sent
to Vlad (the new Imperial sector capital) offering to end the war, offering
reasonably generous terms. Alliance Intelligence also allowed the Order of
Battle of TF23 (which was small, and had nothing larger than a BC) to leak,
along with information implying that the Alliance Navy wasn\'t very
enthusiastic about holding Quiver and might just go away if a large Imperial
force showed up. The Imperials assembled a sizeable portion of Gushmege Fleet
for backup, and went into Quiver thinking a show of force would retake the
system for them. It was a trap.

The Alliance had tracked the passage of the Imperial ships. When they jumped
into Quiver, they found the entire Alliance Third Fleet (commanded by FAdm
Mordechai Sackett) waiting. For this battle, the Alliance had deployed
something new--ANS Macross, the second Alliance Star Destroyer. Named for a
type of "super battleship" in an ancient science fiction film, the 2.5
million ton _Macross_ had the firepower of an entire squadron of smaller
Alliance battleships, built around a Star Trigger meson gun. 

The battle was quick. The Imperial admiral had realized that he\'d been
tricked as soon as he saw what his sensors had detected, and ordered his
whole force to run for it. It was to late for many of his ships--before they
could jump clear, Third Fleet got off its opening salvo, which left many of
the Imperial ships destroyed or too badly damaged to escape.

Following the Battle of Quiver, FAdm Sackett offered the same terms as
before. The Alliance would keep Quiver, and in return would promise to keep
out of Reft and Verge in the future and pay for a new Scout base. This time,
no lost ships would be paid for. With their available force crushed, and the
danger that other border systems would follow Quiver\'s example, the Imperium
had no choice but to agree. Before returning the captured Imperial admirals,
the Alliance treated them to a demonstration of Star Destroyer firepower,
using three of them (one an unfinished ship under external power, not that
the Impies knew that) to turn a gas giant into a small star.

With this dramatic example of Alliance power, the Imperium began rethinking
its priorities. There weren\'t any new ships to send to the Alliance border,
with the Imperial Navy losing grounds on all fronts, but there was new
technology. Up to that point, the Imperium had copied some of the Alliance\'s
technology, but was using it only against the Zhodani, who where (they
thought) their most dangerous enemy. Now, the Imperium began shifting its
efforts to upgrade its ships to the Alliance Front.

Following the Quiver Campaign, the Alliance added a new associate member and
three new protectorates. In addition, the antimatter production facility
under contruction in Besancon was nearing completion. In 5649, most of Third
Fleet was upgraded with antimatter power and jump drive. The new ships went
on line with AM power at the beginning of 5650, and more ships went in for
refitting.

And that\'s how it goes so far. Of course, this is still being worked
on--changes are inevitable.

Mark also asked:

> P.S. How does a star trigger work?

Well, the Alliance version uses three really big meson guns firing beams
which converge inside a star. The Darrians have two version, one which works
and one which doesn\'t. As I recall, the one that works uses two meson beams
converging inside a star with a stream of vaporized metal from a probe.

I do think the grid exist still, but it isn\'t mentioned directly. Remember

I don\'t know if it mentioned anywhere but there are hints in High Guard 
(CT) and MT (I don\'t know how much is mentioned in FF&S or TNE).

High Guard mention how much capacitor-charge is available to the ship due 
to normal jump drives.  If my memory serves me right - 0.25%?? of ship mass 
per jump number - don\'t quote me on that!!

MT gives a value for the storage charge per cubic metre of \'capacitors\' - 
"raw energy".

Reading DGPs Starship Operators Manual vol1, they mention how the jump 
drive is simply an oversized, extremely inefficient fusion powerplant.

Fuel usage from MT and High Guard (and Striker and Book 8 Robots if you 
want to use some obscure sources) give a relationship between fuel 
consumed and power output.  CT and MT (does TNE - I\'m not sure) give time 
from starting the jump sequence to actualling jumping.  This is the time 
it takes the powerplant to power up the capacitors.  Engine efficiency 
can be worked out from this.

>From there, there are two possible philosophies we can follow.
1) The jump (fusion powerplant) engine consumes energy at a continual, 
consistent rate for the rest of the jump - keeping the ship in jump space 
and moving.

2) The jump drive releases more energy at the reentry stage - to \'break 
through into the \'real\' universe.

in 1) it is easy to work out the EmLevel of the ship at breakout.  Find, 
or guess, some figures on the time it takes to complete the transistion 
back to normal space; multiply by the power output of the jump plant 
during the normal jump flight and add this to the powerplant of the ship 
(assumed to be running on full - ready to manoevre) - hey presto a new 
output level to calculate the EmLevel of the ship.

in 2) things get more opinionated.  Really its simply a matter of what 
you like, but I would suggest that it requires the same energy to 
traverse the jump/normal space barrier in either direction, if it takes 
any to exit (which personally I am in favour of).

Therefore, the process is even simpler - if you agree with the \'same 
energy either way\' concept.  Just calculate the energy output of the jump 
engine at entry to jump space, and that is the energy output of the jump 
enginer at exit from jump space.

Another argument that can be put forward in support of this theory, is 
that of forced re-entry into normal space.  In the words of various books 
- I don\'t have my bibliography here to access - ships that try to jump 
inside of the 100 diameter boundary re-enter "..violently.." at the 
boundary.  It is my view that as the engine is not actually running at 
any higher rate (not programmed to re-enter at that point in time/space), 
the energy required to re-enter is \'taken\' from the ship itself.  This is 
manifested in either temperature and/or physical changes.  The structure 
gets stressed, is warped in shape, heats up or cools - whichever...!

I know the physics theory is not there but we are dealing with jump 
space/FTL drives.  We all know that the physics theory for those is not 
there either so...it\'s all a matter of opinion anyway.

Anyway, if anyone has got comments or additions they would be interesting 
to read - please do tell.  //count@easynet.co.uk

Subject: Rocket Fuel Clarification
Message-ID: <199411221636.KAA11698@landshark.itlabs.umn.edu>

Here\'s a possible clarification from FF&S on fusion rockets, and
in fact rockets in general....

The paragraph on fuel consumption for rockets in the section on
maneuver systems doesn\'t seem to make much sense.  It should 
read something like the following:

To find out how many kiloliters (cubic meters) of fuel are required
per tonne of fuel required for a rocket, *divide* the number of
metric tonnes of fuel by the density of the fuel.

For example:
           
    1 tonne hydrogen
    ----  ==  14.29 kL == about one displacement-ton.           
     0.07 tonnes/kL

1. You create a star-proof probe. 

2. Shoot it into the sun.

3. Irradiate with the beams of special meson widgets.

4. Gurgle with joy as a 10 parsec radius is reduced to smoking rubble.

Oh, yeah, it\'s a good idea to Jump away real fast...

More seriously, these are the rules I\'d worked out...


THE OPERATION OF THE STAR TRIGGER


Step 1: Evaluation

	Before the trigger can be deployed, the star involved must be carefully
studied in order to properly calibrate the weapon. The ship must be positioned
in a solarsynchronous orbit at precisely 10,000,000,000 (ten billion) kilometres
from the star. This massively distant orbit may seem to make the process
extremely long, but it is the safest place to be when the sun is about to
explode - on detonation, the first eight orbits will be wiped out in less than
an hour. See the end of this article for details.
	First, a sensor reading of the target sun must be taken. 

To place a vessel in a solarsynchronous orbit: 1
Difficult, Pilot, Navigation, Dexterity, 10 minutes

To take a preliminary calibration scan: 1
Routine, Sensor Operations, Navigation, 24 hours absolute  (uncertain)
Referee: If the system is binary, this task becomes Difficult. If the system is
trinary, the task is Formidable.

	After this, the probe must be calibrated with these settings.

To calibrate a Star Trigger probe for a particular star: 1
Routine, Computer, Electronics, 1 minute

	Note that the Star Trigger will NOT function properly if deployed into a
Dwarf star of any kind. 

	Step 2: Deployment

	The probe must be launched from the ship and guided into the star. The
course is pre-laid, although adjustments may be made in flight; this involves a
time lag of up to 30 minutes, however. The flight itself takes 227 hours (9 3/4
days) at 6g standard.

To deploy the Star Trigger probe into a star: 1
Routine, Navigation, Education, 227 hours absolute, fateful
Referee: A failure on this task indicates a course error, correctable with the
next task; a fumble indicates the probe  has crashed into the star and burned
up.

To correct the course of a deployed Star Trigger:
Difficult, MAX(Sensor Ops, Commo, Forward Obs), Navigation, 1.5 hours 

	The probe\'s propulsion unit is solar powered, and therefore cannot be
detected by neutrino trace. Standard procedure is to arm the device only when it
is within 1,000,000 kilometres of the sun. After that it is possible to track
the probe with neutrino sensors; the proximity to the star makes such tracking
impossible with any other sensor.

To arm a Star Trigger at 1,000,000Km from Ground Zero: 1
Routine, Sensor Ops, Commo, 12 hours absolute

	After the probe has been deployed into the star, there is an absolute
limit of about eight days before the shielding gives way and the probe burns
up.

Step 3: Lock on 

	Once the probe is deployed to Ground Zero, the ship\'s sensors must be
used to lock the meson beam generator on to the homing signal. 

To lock on to a deployed Star Trigger after stellar entry: 1
Difficult, Sensor Ops, Education, 24 hours absolute

Step 4: Detonation or abortion

	The final stage is the detonation. Only the ship\'s Commander may execute
this step; a suitably dramatic perspex-lidded red double toggle switch is
provided. Note that if ANY of the tasks marked 1 above have failed, or if the
survival time has passed, detonation will not follow.

To detonate the Star Trigger, assuming success in the above:
Simple, Commo, Gunnery, 12 hours absolute, unskilled OK

	To abort the operation after stellar entry, simply repeat the arming task
above to disarm the probe and wait until the survival time has expired.

Step 5: Aftermath

	Detonation will be accompanied by an almost immediate flurry of sunspots.
This indicates success, and is the signal to leave; the first flares will begin
almost immediately. The initial flares will sweep across the first eight orbits
within less than an hour, rendering inoperative and roasting any space vessel
caught in open space. The only defence is to jump, and keep jumping until the
ship is outside the radius of destruction.

Final Notes

	At first glance, the activation of the Star Trigger might seem a rather
impossible task in a hostile system; at best, it cannot be achieved in less than
300 hours, or 12.5 days. The Ariadne class is, however,  a) very well armed and
armoured and b) usually very heavily escorted. It also has TL 16 masking, making
it very difficult to spot at 10 billion Km; the probe is almost completely
undetectable as it is indistinguishable from a small meteoroid until too
late.
Finally, remember that the whole theory of the star trigger has to be based
around the working of the reaction, rather than strategy; and that the basic
concept of the Special Arm is to threaten the devastation of the \'Trigger. No
one else knows that the Trigger takes 12 days to fire, just that it exists;
no-one in their right minds is going to risk finding out...

OK.  Any idea what proportion?


Anyway, I think that we agree that:

1. AM is a more hazardous power source than fusion.

2. AM is too damn useful: doctrine will be developed to take advantage of its
energy while minimizing the risks.  (Personally, I think there are going to be
some nasty incidents while the bugs get worked out of the doctrine).

Is it worth working out some sort of a damage curve for an AM explosion? Taking
into account a "long flare" model, the neutrino component of the reaction, and
the heavy particle flux from the unconverted matter and AM, including secondary
radiation from the AM flux encountering target ship hull?  Lots of work, but
would it be worth it?

I have examined them.  The lasers were designed in a manner typical
of the way GDW designs the examples they offer.  Mediocre.  But,
unfortunately, you still can\'t get a reasonable small arms laser to
have a non-nil penetration.

I tried *everything*.  I tried high-drain (enhanced output) betteries.
I tried PFC\'s (!), I tried both of the standard methods.  I even
looked at PNF.

The best I came up with was a straight DEI laser.  It\'s mass (plus
battery, HPG, and cooling system), came out to something like 68 kg.

This was the smallest thing I could build with a non-nil penetration.

And it had a ROF of 1.

It doesn\'t even make a good Squad Support Weapon.

The only advantages to it were:

1)  You could fire it about 300 times without recharge (!)...  This
didn\'t contribute much to the mass (it was the goddamned COOLING
SYSTEM and the stinkin\' HPG), so it didn\'t seem to hurt much to allow
a large "magazine".

2)  Anyone you hit with it was *COOKED*, even someone in Battledress.

Trouble is, use it once and guess who\'s everyone\'s number 1 target?

I was unaware of the dates.  But I am schtikin\' to my story.

Partially correct.  The Riders in the Union/Alliance stories served
two purposes:  Combat, and Target Acquisition.  Much of the combat
took place at relativistic speeds, which made for serious fire-control
nightmares.  Having a couple of your Riderships between you and the
enemy gave you a much easier time.  Sure, the information your riders
pass you will be as out of date (by the time it gets to you) as your
own sensor data, but it will be much more precise.

In combat in these stories, ship armor was pretty much like butter.
You needed a big Carrier for lots of firepower, but mostly for
the ability to carry lots of supplies, the ability to do lots of
repairs and replacement of parts, etc.  And to do this over a long
period between rests.  But a couple of decent hits would knock out
a big Carrier pretty easily.  So small riders became feasible, and
big riders became stupid.

Re:  Rider Tenders vs.  Battle Carriers.

I never said that *they* were parallel.  The Battle Carrier goes
into combat.  Once in combat, it tapdances like crazy to avoid
getting hit!

>(I\'m a big Cherryh fan, by the way, even if she doesn\'t seem to
>understand special relativity sometimes.)

Well, she\'s proposing a drive which is inertialess.  Unfortunately,
if that were the case, the people inside wouldn\'t feel any G\'s.
So she\'s mixing metaphors, to say the least.

I wouldn\'t expect anyone who writes good fiction to understand
(or pay heed to) special relativity 8^).  If s/he wants 10,000 Gs of
inertialess acceleration, go for it!  It\'s really the only thing
that makes the warships in her stories any better than the armed
merchants.

  The (no longer canonical) thrust plates always bothered me a
  little on the basis of blatant violation of physical law - they
  appeared to be a reactionless propulsion system that had the
  effect of changing the momentum of a closed system.

  Last night (yes, I had been "drinking"; my family and I went to
  the Crown Plaza for a champagne brunch) something occurred to me:
  Thrust plates weren\'t reactionless - what they did was convert
  grav energy into neutrinos, and toss the neutrinos in the
  direction opposite the desired direction of travel, a la Newton,
  II.  This would have the effect of _appearing_ reactionless,
  because neutrinos are about as near to non-existent as you can
  get without actually failing to exist - they ignore almost
  anything smaller than a small sun.

  I didn\'t follow this up at all; I\'ve got a couple of other
  Traveller-related projects already in the works (crashing Sol and
  Dingir subsectors, and seeing if I can rebuild a Terra-centered
  pocket empire - yes, I\'ll post my results on the Traveller list
  when I finish).  But it at least seems plausible; my roommate, a
  BS(Physics), says that neutrinos do indeed possess that quality
  known as momentum - which quality (or lack thereof) was the
  problem with the original thrust plates.

  Anyone have the urge to do some _real_ math and decide whether
  I\'m still soused?

Ken,

The whole idea about the Alliance is pretty interesting; just a few queries
though:

(1) Any chances of bringing the timeline up to 1201?
(2) How would you preserve game balance? Surely if the Imperium and the
Alliance were in a duel to the death, the Alliance could perform some
deep penetration raids into Spinward Marches and Deneb sectors, blowing
up stars which have Hi-Pop worlds around them? This would be the ultimate
deterrant to the Imperium.
(3) Any details on Alliance society?
(4) What are the Battle Rider stats for alliance warships?


Why with my Virus plot, and your Alliance we could change TNE forever!!!
Muuuuaahahahahaha! (much rubbing of hands, devilish grin)

>Excuse my ignorance, but what is the Alliance?

Islands Cluster Alliance, a polity of various planets of the Rift, mostly in
Reft Sector.
It got its start in the on-line Trillion Credit Squadron campaign game run by
Steve HIgginbotham a few years back.  Since then various former players have
been
working out details about its culture, military, future, etc.  Steve
Higginbotham
(jshiggin@aol.com) and Ken Hagler (kenhagler@aol.com) are the ones to ask
questions about it.  Steve reads the xboat, but not the tml, so posts to the
xboat
may be answered by him.

>Why all the talk about AM.

AM (anti-matter) technology was developed by one of the Island Cluster
nations during the campaign, and figured heavily in the Cluster Liberation
War.

I have to admit that it was a great shock to me when I discovered that
lasers had nil Pen. But then I thought that maybe there is a reason for
that. Don\'t you think that they way lasers do damage is that they burn,
or should I say BOIL tissue? As it is much more easier to get the water
(human cells) to boil than say metal, normal hand-held lasers don\'t have
energy to vaporize (sp?) metal armor.

Yes, I know it would be possible to put more energy to laser beam but then
we have to make them big. In fact in RCEG (RC Equipment Guide) there is
one squad laser that have Pen «! OK I admit that it has ROF of 1/4.
Besides hand-held lasers penetrate all non-metal armor without reducing
a single dice of damage.

I made a bit of calculation how much water 0.04 MJ laser rifle could
evaporate. As there has been long time since my last physics class there
could be errors in my calculations.

Q=V*de*c*(t2-t1)+r*m ;V=volume, de=density, c=thermal capacity, t=temperature

                      r=how much energy one kg of water needs to evaporate
                      m=mass
Q=V*de*c*(t2-t1)+r*de*V =>

V=(40 kJ)/(998 kg/m3*4.19 kj/(kg*C)*63C+2260 kJ/kg*998 kg/m3)=1.59E-5 m3 =>

V=0.159 dl = 15.9 cm3
----

Personally I would not want to lose that much from me. My point is that
*if* my calculations are right, then I can safely assume that laser is
just used to boil and evaporate the flesh. As it evaporates very quickly
the reaction is much like explosion.

For now I don\'t have time to calculate how much metal (steel) same laser
could evaporate or even melt.

Please correct me if I\'m wrong.

 Anti-neutrons do exist, (They were discovered in 1955 at the Berkley
Bevatron) but they have the same problem that neutrons have, you can\'t
guide them or accelerate them with magnetic fields. You would have to
use some sort of gravity focusing or some science fiction thing.
Anti-protons would be more useful.
 I don\'t think they would be more effective then normal neutrons. A
normal neutron would smash into an atom, releasing photons though
Bremstrahlung, (The release of photons by a decelerating charged
particle) THe atom it hits will also be effected, either flying away or
releasing other particles.
  An anti neutron will collide  into things until it hits a neutron and
it decays into gamma rays. These are pretty lethal to crew memebers,
but so are just neutrons, hence the old concept of the neutron bomb.  I
think anti-matter bombs are a more inventive way to use anti-matter.

While fellow TMLer Tariq Rashid and I were waiting to get into Star
Trek, we started talking about Planetary assualts in Battle Rider.
Tariq had just made up a meson gun designed as a Deep Site Meson gun,
ie one to be buried deep underground in a planet, for planetary
defense.  We started to wonder how to fight one of these.
  Sensors won\'t be able to see it, sense it is buried under ground, I
assume it is deep enough to damp out all E-M radiation.  So you won\'t
be able to simply shoot it.
 The buried meson gun will need sensors on the surface to see enemy
ships so it can shoot them.  But the sensors can be spread across a
planet.  By the time an orbiting ship can start a sensor sweep to
detect the sensors, the deep site gun will fire on it, mostly likely
blowing it up or crippling it.
The only thing I could think of was to drop troops on to the surface,
basically below the senors, and have troops run around trying to find
the dishes and blow them up.
 Can anyone figure out another angle of attack.

True - I believe that is why the NPAWS is not introduced until the same tech
level as the other gravetic technologies.  Remember, too, that we are talking
about technologies which (in the case of the Alliance ships which have been
posted on xboat) can produce and handle anti-matter on a scale that, seems,
well, pure science fiction ;-).

But would they not all have a negative charge, and so tend to disperse -- a
poor beam weapon?

Now, it is clear from your answer that you are quite knowledgable on these
matters, but I find the conclusion surprising.

Looking first at the neutron stream impacting armour: The armour is dense and
thick, designed to absorb attacks such as this.  That means that there is a high
probablity that the neutron, having caused some photon release, broken up a few
neuclei, etc will finally exhaust itself having done some degree of damage to
the material proportional (more or less) to its kinetic energy.  This will
doubtless cause some damage to the hull material (such as happens, say, to the
materials within a fission reactor) but will probably cause most of its effects
to the target as a result of secondary radiation: I believe that this was
expected to be the main cause of AFV crew kills with the neutron bomb.

On the other hand, the anti-neutron stream will do damage not only as a result
of the kenetic effects but as a result of the release of the rest-energy of
both the anti- and target neutron.  Also, since the target material is designed
to absorb neutrons, the stream should be fully converted to energy within a very
short period of time.  I would expect that the  resulting release of energy and
wholesale atomic breakdown within the fabric of the hull itself should not just
have particle level effects: there should be obvious macroscopic effects from
the shock wave as a portion of the target suddenly becomes a plasma.
That is, wouldn\'t it blow a boody great hole in the hull?
I am prepared to be disuaded of this (Lord knows it wouldn\'t be the first time
on this list). ;-).

Thanks! Here\'s some answers.

Sure, someday. I\'ve set 5650 AD (1129 Impy) as the "present" for my own use,
though, and I won\'t go beyond that until I\'ve finished with the development I
want to do for the 5650 period. Besides, 1201 Impy is significant primarily
in the standard Virus setting, which I don\'t use.

> (2) How would you preserve game balance?

Short answer: I don\'t care about game balance. Long answer: the apparently
overwhelming superiority of the Alliance will look a lot less overwhelming
when I get around to designing "modern" ships for the Aslan.

Well, the star trigger doesn\'t blow up stars, it just causes massive flares
(sort of a junior nova, maybe). But that\'s the general idea. The Alliance can
also threaten Impy worlds with planetbuster missiles just about anywhere.

>  This would be the ultimate
> deterrant to the Imperium.

The Alliance hopes so!

> (3) Any details on Alliance society?

Some. For starters, there\'s no single Alliance society--most of the members
have significantly different societies of their own. I\'ve developed
Neubayern\'s society somewhat (since I played it during the pbem game), but
unfortunately the hard drive with those files is broken. If you\'re
interested, you can probably find most of them in the archives. Other members
had varying amounts of detail done by their players, but I haven\'t got around
to trying to collect that info yet.

> (4) What are the Battle Rider stats for alliance warships?

There aren\'t any. I cancelled my plans to convert the Alliance ships using
FF&S when I discovered that such conversions would be a huge undertaking
guarenteed to give me ulcers. Maybe BR would be easier, but I can\'t afford it
at present.

> Why with my Virus plot, and your Alliance we could change TNE forever!!!

On the subject of Virus and the Alliance, I\'m not using Virus myself. For
someone thinking of using both, though, here\'s a thought:

The Alliance uses exclusively fiber-optics. There are almost no silicon-based
electronics in Alliance space, and those that remain are being replaced as
quickly as possible--living next to a supernova requires such precautions.
So, there is no rational way that Virus could affect anything in the
Alliance. Of course, the whole idea of Virus is irrational (in my opinion),
so feel free to invent some excuse for a silicon chip to invade a fiber optic
computer.

> How big are the meson guns (Are we talking Death Star scale equipment here?)

Not that big. The gun itself is 50,000 tons (and remember three are needed in
different ships), and it draws an absurd amount of power, so the power plant
will be pretty huge as well.

I\'ve been making some 1:1000 scale ship miniatures, as well as bashing
some in the same scale from model kits. I have a couple of designs for

by 2 if just learning against it.

Using this gives concussion the penetration rating of 2.  This derived from the
formula for calculating penetration rating from damage value and penetration
value.

Penetration rating = Damage value / Penetration Value

and penetration value is 0.5 x Damage value.

Penetration rating = 1 / 0.5 = 2.

Here are the rules I think I would go with:

1.    High Guard combat:  small craft launched or to be recovered in the turn of
      an AM explosion in the mother craft subject to a role for destoyed/severe
      damage/ no effect.


2.    Role Playing: Ships outside of 5000 km safe, 5000-1000 km possible sensor
      damage, 1000-100 km definate sensor damage, 100-50 km, sensor damage and
      possible ship damage, possible radiation effects, 50-10 km, same but
      more severe, possible destruction, under 10 - toast.

3.    BL: same hex, conduct a "difficult" attack against each sensor system
      to cause 1h.  Probably some more rules are needed, I don\'t have BL.

4.    BR: same hex, temporary sensors hit.  White-out should be 5 turns.

Sorry to "polute" xboat with TNE references, but I cross-post this stuff.
The Universe I am working on is only tech 8.5, so I have a way to go before I
have to worry about AM.

Well, it\'s still vulnerable to meson gun attack, and if it has a meson
screen active, it can\'t fire, which is exactly what the invader wants.
One would think one could use triangulation-type techniques to locate
it based on its firing patterns. Human intelligence is also useful -
let those spooks in Naval Intelligence earn their paychecks! Find
someone in the Department of Planetary Defense who has a debt problem
or something.

Not only on the surface of the planet - off the planet as well, if the
sensors have meson communicators installed.

One might figure out what technique the sensors are using to locate
targets, then "blind" them appropriately, for example, using EMP
devices. This is probably necessary if one wants to land troops on the
planet (transports make nice targets). It probably will also have 
bad effects on the planet itself (sensor-blinding weapons probably do 
nasty things to the local technology base), but one has to expect the
enemy to take extreme measures if one has an "unassailable" defense...

One piont that I would like to make neutron radiation is barely attenuated
by lead, but compounds high in hydrogen content attenuate it to the extreme.
So those liquid hydrogen fuel tanks make great shielding for neutron
weaponry. Density of the material is not at factor as concentration of
hydrogen. Current shielding for material like americium is parafin.

Yes, that\'s exactly what it does. The High Guard rule for it is that for
every factor over the targets size, it destroys two factors of armour (I
think--I don\'t have the tech file in front of me).

           Ground Vechile (Legged)     4 (7)

Possessions: Anything he want\'s.  

             His most famous possessions include ancient German 
             memorabelia (including the only known surviving East German 
             flag in existence), and a Sio Moff zero-G glass sculpture, 
             presented to his ancestors by Crown Prince Cleon, son of 
             Cleon IV (born 423, crowned 475, assassinated 555).
 
             Most of his families\' treasured possessions is feared 
             lost, somewhere in Magyar sector. 

             The possessions that von Schunamann most loves, however, are 
             his collection of TL F battle mecha.  These 12-15 m high 
             vechiles/androids, armed with explosive devices (which cause 
             more flash than damage)  are used in a variety of "Mechasports".

Background:  von Schunamann is the achnowledged head of the Schunamann 
             family.  The 60 acknowledged family members form the core of 
             SuSAG; once a megacorp with interest\'s across the Imperium, 
             it\'s now restricted to the Regency providing chemicals, 
             pharmaceuticals, biogeneered products, and 
             semi-legal psi boosters. 

             von Schunamann is only an adequate CEO, delegating much of 
             his duties to trusted aides and pulling the regins only when he 
             needs to.  He spend\'s much of his time either meeting 
             figurehead duties, enjoying himself in very high social circles
             or playing Mechwarrior with other profoundly wealthy men.  
             [Mechawar is to the Regency what Polo was to the British
Empire].

             von Schunamann is happly married - maintaining not even one 
             concubine, to the astonishment of Court circles - and 
             delight\'s in his eight children.

                             starships, starship systems, power generation) 
      
Ling Standard is probably the megacorp most directly involved in

              A duffel bag "with all my worldly possessions"
              2000 Cr... in Darrian currency

Background:  Pidiris Razlehmehid is a large, rather gregarious fellow, 
             both strong and intelligent.  He lives to sing, but also 
             enjoys a bit of roughhousing and carousing wherever he 
             goes.  Like about 30% of Darrians, he doesn\'t believe that 
             humans originated on Terra, putting that belief down to typical 
             Solomani supremist dogma. 

             Razlehmehid is a strong, powerful tenor, and a member of a 
             Darrian \'Tengobhes\' group of singers.  Tengobhes groups 
             specialize in Ancient Darrian Hymns and chants in a style 
             most closely resembling Islamic forms of singing, often 
             spin-dancing at the same time.  Of course, Razlehmehid himself 
             is not a believer in the long-dead Yalema faith.

             His Tengobhes group is composed of four men (including 
             himself, there\'s Dulyunal Zgehngehbher, Pune Mbalzihrer, and 
             Zlaneyr Nyeghihndihligh).  After several marginally 
             profitable tours in the Darrian Confederation, they have 
             decided to take their first tour in the Regency, where 
             Tengobhes singing is still a rarity.  Because they can\'t 
             speak Anglic - and are still in culture shock - the other three 
             singers have unofficaly made Razlehmehid their leader.

             Razlehmehid is married, and has two young daughters - and a 
             nephew - to care for.  Whenever possible, he visit\'s them 
             back on Darrian.

              subsector-wide as the sole survivor of the doomed shuttle 
              Wayrith. 

              The Wayrith was en-route to an insystem mining colony when 
              an engine malfunction occurred.  Because of the loss of fuel, 
              the best the captain could do was put the shuttle in an 
              elliptical orbit around the colony, and await rescue.

              Rescue was long in coming.  Meanwhile, food ran out, and 
              eventually lots were drawn to determine who get\'s eaten.  Mrs. 
              Stanley - the sole woman on-board - managed to excempt 
              herself on the basis of her pregnacy and persuading the men 
              not to kill her. "Imagine what the press would say!  You 
              wouldn\'t last a day in court!"

              When the rescuers finally arrived, only Mrs. Stanely and 
              her newborn infant lived.  When they spotted her - in a 
              haze of bones, split for their marrow - her first words were 
              "Look, darling!  Food!  Food!"

              She arrived home in a wave of sensationalism and notoriety.
              Aquitted of all charges, she became very wealthy and a 
              major figure of controversy.  Most of her money she blew in 
              buying a large home in a prestigous ungerground location, but 
              she still has enough to tour the subsector with her 6-year old 
              son.

Background:  A portly, arrogant man from a rich agricultural world, 
             Zautienzhvlaz is a walking turn-off to his fellow graduate 
             students at MRO University.  With his thich accent and 
             less-than-perfect command of Anglic (he refuses to use his 
             translator outside of class, perferring to pratice his 
             incomprehensable Anglic instead), Zautienzhvlaz endlessly 
             preaches the superiority of Zhodani civilization to anyone 
             within striking distance.

             He hates the Nobility.  He hates the Democratic reforms.  He 
             hates the immoral entertainment districts.  He hates the 
             clumsiness of Regency design.  He hates Regency art.  He 
             _vocally_ hates anything that suggests either greed or deceit.
             About the only thing he likes is the psionic reforms, that 
             he feels will inevitabily lead to the Regency becoming  
             Just Like Zhodane.  And whenever possible, he will rub the 
             PC\'s noses into the fact that the Collapse was caused by 
             Imperials, and the Consulate was untouched by it.

             Why is Zautienzhvlaz in the Regency at all, over 110 
             parsec\'s from home?   Mainly because he cannot believe that 
             the Imperials crushed the Zhodane navy at Rhylanor, ending the 
             Fifth Frontier War (1107 - 1110).  His doctorate, focusing 
             on the battle, is his intellectual attempt to explain away this 
             defeat.  He also has an interest in robotics, and was 
             profoundly dissapointed to learn that the Rhylanor Institute of 
             Technology was closed down, giving him one more thing to whine 
             about.

Background:   Ms. Hiu is a small, somewhat overweight woman  (about 10 
              lbs) from Kubishush.  After serving 13 years with the local 
              army (rising to Lieutenant), she mustered out to join the 
              Mercenaries Guild, as a 2nd class Field Representative. 

              She spent most of the last five years in Ziafrplians 
              Sector, as an Assessor: insuring that the legal terms of 
              mercenary contracts are met in the field.  Hui enjoyed 
              herself immensely there, with her favourate experiences being 
              with the Urzaeng Merc companies (including the famous 
              Errgh Okzarsdaem battalion).

              But after being transferred back to Regina for the last 2 
              years, she realized that her carrer has ground to a halt.
              Coupled with a lack of excitement and friends, she has become
              depressed & irritable, alienating those around her.

              Currently, she is saving for a trip back home, to Kubishush.

             Always travels with a TL D First Aid kit
             Made an oath of "Poverty, Chasitity, Obedience"

Background:  Mother Superior Witherspoon is an imposing and forthright 
             woman, even in her Order\'s white habit with ornate gold & black
             trim.  She considers her command of the 25,000 Disp jumpship 
             _St. Degaaka of Aladon_ to be a trust from God, and is 
             relentless in preserving that trust. 

             Born on a backward world on the edge of the Quarrentine 
             Zone, Witherspoon became a Catholic nun at 12.  Educated at 
             Antra, capital of the subsector (Astra: Deneb/1808 
             A53789C-E  Cp 501 Re M0D K5D), she became a doctor at the 
             Free University of Immin Shishadiim and joined the Order of 
             Holy Succor, a medical order.

             As a member of that order, she was posted to _st. Degaaka of 
             Aladon_, a medical/convent jumpship.  With a crew of 130, the 
             73-year old ship is equipped to TL D standards, with 700 
             beds and medical facilities to match. 

             Sister Witherspoon was only elevated to Mother Superior two 
             years ago, and her hands-on style conflicts with the 
             administration & bureaucratic needs of the convent.  Moreover, 
             she has only limited leadership qualities, tending to ram her 
             way through problems and expecting that everyone will 
             automatically do her duty, scolding those who don\'t meet her 
             detailed standards. 

             Currently the _St. Degaaka of Aladon_ is posted to District 
             268, a backward subsector troubled by Aslan/Human 
             conflicts.  The _St. Degaaka_ is desprately needed here, as so 
             many systems have no access to TL D+ medical care.   But 
             money is tight and Collace (District 268: Spinward Marches/1237 
             B628943-D S Hi In 101 Na F1V M6D), the only port that can 
             repair the aging _St. Degaaka_, is harrasing the convent to 
             please the Aslans, who oppose a Regency hospital ship in 
             the subsector.

              A \'hold-out\' body pistol, of TL G plastic
              A comfortable residence in an orbital station

Background:   Mr. O\'Connor is a slim, kindly old man with a warm voice.  
              His long face - graced with laugh lines - and gracious manners 
              hardly seems to belong to a professional psychopath, but it 
              does.

              Born in the corrupt Kingdom of Siev perogy, his 
              intelligence and lack of scrples eventually landed him a 
              place in the local Secret Service.  However, while a majjor 
              revolt seemed about to topple the Kingdom, he judiciously sold 
              out several of his fellow agents while refining his image as 
              "The Wise Old Man" to his subordinates, thus protecting his 
              safety in both camps.
 
              At 1177, after the Kingdom was \'unexpectedly\' overthrown, 
              O\'Connor found a new position as an enforcer for SuSAG.
              Reliable and discreet, he would carefully research and 
              observe his target before striking, by either gliding a blade 
              across the unsuspecting victim\'s jugular or by flicking a 
              monofiliment pumpknife into the base of the skull, again from 
              the back.  Only rarely would he resort to the rifle, an 
              "inelegant instrument", not quite as fine a kill as the knife.

              O\'Connor usually is sent after "white collar" criminals 
              who threatened the company (both employees and otherwise).  
              Even though the divided and (largely) corrupt local police 
              looked the other way, a "posting to Porozol" is quietly 
              dreaded by SuSAG managers in Rylanor subsector.

             two TL D warbots

Background:  Locked away in his low berth, Baron Arellano is probably the 
             last of the Civil War era combatents (604 - 622)

             A flightly, vainglorious man with a fixation on "My Destiny 
             of Greatness", he was an eccentric noble on the raw frontier of 
             the Spinward Marches.  Half of the systems were still 
             unsettled, and he spent most of the time acting as defacto 
             judge on lawless Regina.

             As Emperor battled Emperor back in Core, Arellano got the 
             idea that his Calling has arrived.  He declared himself 
             Emperor, and managed to raise up a ragtag fleet of armed 
             merchants and patrol cutters before leaving for Core.

             He never left the Marches.  Grand Admiral Arabellatra Alkalikoi
             sent a minor task force to stop the Baron. Althought they 
             never quite caught him, they did force him to abandon his 
             half-baked plans and live the pirate life.  Time after time 
             he\'d devise a Rube Goldberg scheme to get past the task force, 
             and time after time it would blow up in a wild and wolly 
             manner.

             Finally, he was forced to abandon his fleet, and in 618 
             retired to his hideaway on 728-907.  On a whim, he set the 
             controls to 1201 and retired to see what the glorious future 
             would hold.

----

BTW: Baron de la Arellano is dedicated to the memory of the French 
Emperor Napoleon III, who once tried to conquer France by loading a ship 
with about 50 ruffians, and crossing the Channel to France and Glory!

Well, it didn\'t _quite_ work out... but he later did get himself elected 
Persident, and two years later proclaimed himself Emperor.

P.S. at the time of the Civil War...
    - the top Imperial TL was 13
    - the Solomani Confederation was part of the Imperium
    - the Imperium included Foreven Sector
    - there were no x-boat routes
    - the closest anti-grav cities were in Vland Sector
    - the 2nd Frontier War was raging (615 - 620)
    - there were no Aslan\'s this side of the Great Rift

                   Julian Protertorate
              Offical head of the Ansirk Biosculpting Project

Background:   Born and raised in the Kairovan community on Mora, Miss. Daya
              is one of the very few who can claim to be a pure-blooded 
              Arab.  From her youth she wanted to follow in the footsteps of 
              her ultra famous great-grandfather Ali Daya (1088 - 1150).  
              Ali Daya\'s suite of four interconnected biosystems under the 
              themes of "Loyalty, Trial, Victory" ranks with the best of the 
              Old Masters in Dasudashag, and had the same effect on the 
              Deneb artistic community as the 1118 tri-v film "Stand on 
              Rhylanor" had on the general populance, or the Connie 
              Chung series "Why We Are Imperials", or Norris\' Ascension 
              Speech when he was formally proclaimed Archduke.

              Sherali Daya stayed away from the epic-scale work of her 
              great-grandfather for years, focusing instead on doing regular 
              commission work.  But as her reputation & skill grew so did 
              her aspirations, and in 1192 she accepted a commission from a 
              Fleet Admiral to create a new biosphere for the Naval Base at 
              Ansirk, home of 7 million Naval personnel.

              The biosphere - to reside strictly within the installation, 
              as the world is airless - is to emphasise the motif 
              "Controlled Fury".  This theme is sympolized by the Terran

              Probably the most charming change to the station has been the

              haunting call.

 Based on every Zhodani ship picture to see print, I\'ve seen a few
consistent factors.

 -The Zhodani almost always mount maneuver drives as a pair or set of
  smaller thrusters, instead of one large central thruster.

 -The bridge is always in the classic jet airliner spot: Front-High.
  The bridge is usually built within the basic hullform instead of standing
  out from it.

 -Overall width of the hull will be greatest on the lower decks. The
  paired engines are often set in distinct nacelles which form the widest
  part of the ship (see the Vlezhdatl).

 -There are three basic hull formats: beveled box (typified by the
  Vlezhdatl in BL), flowing (The Ninz scout and the Zhdits), and sharp
  and needle-like (the Chatl scout and the Stedlas SDB). Of these three,
  the boxy form is used mostly for larger ships and the flowing form
  and needle mostly for the smaller ships. The flowing and needle forms
  are sometimes combined in one ship (see the Stedlas).

 -Zhodani ships rarely have flat tails. They are almost always tapered
  to a point (Zhdits), or have a ridge running across the back (Ninz).
  Box-form ships have the engines protrude aft slightly, and the main
  hull will be beveled instead of flat-backed.

 -Many Zhodani ships are "necked" in shape, having a narrow portion
  between two main hull sections. The proportions of the two halves
  to each other varies considerably (see Vlezhdatl and Chatl for
  extremes), but is always either balanced or tail-heavy.

 -The Zhodani do not gratuitously streamline. If a design does not need
  streamlining, it won\'t be built with it. Their fleet refueling doctrine
  apparently depends on gas giants, so we can expect capital ships to be
  streamlined.

 -Ships of the flowing or needle types generally have one or more forward
  swept fins. These are more common on starships than on subcraft. It
  is my opinion (backed up by the original Vargr Module) that the Vargr
  taste in finned ships came from their first contacts with the Zhodani.

 -Civilian ships intended for use within the Consulate are rarely armed
  or capable of carrying arms.

 -Civilian ships intended for use within the Consulate rarely have
  internal security based on bulkhead divisions, as Zhodani are all
  "completely trustworthy".


  Those with Brilliant Lances will have recognized some of the
ship names I\'ve used above. All originated with FASA and the Keith
brothers many years ago, and can be found in Adventure Class Ships Volumes
One and Two. The Vlezhdatl appeared in a seperate package from FASA.
  The oldest Zhodani ship in print is the Shivva Patrol Ship from
Adventure 4: Leviathan. The edition that I have has a picture that _might_
be a Shivva, but it is a rather eccentric picture. I prefer to consider
the Shivva to be unpictured to date.

 To answer the specific question, I view the tapered cylinder with flying
bridge (ala Star Blazers and Captain Harlock) to be a Solomani thing
(though not the ONLY Solomani thing, obviously). The flying wedge is
Sylean (see the Type S). Combining these two (as happened in the early
3I period) produces very Star Destroyer-like ships as seen in both
editions of Fighting Ships. The Vilani prefer rounded shapes, now seen
mostly in the Type R, Imperiallines TI/TJ, and the Tukera Long Liner
(mentioned in the Traveller Adventure and seen in the early Traveller\'s
Digest from DGP).
 The Vargr prefer ships that look vaguely like a canine head or muzzle,
with some fins added just \'cause they\'re cool. The K\'kree do flying saucers.
Aslan go for the organic, bubbly look. Hiver ships used to be boxes with
a vaguely melted or softened look (like the automobiles of 5 years ago),
but the Collapse caused them to go for simplicity and drop the soft look.
They now do sharply defined boxes (see the RCEG for examples).

 1. Send a giant rock into one of the planets oceans.
 2. Detonate several nukes in the upper atmosphere. This will destroy 
 most electronic hardware. And sensors are very hard to shield against 
 these types of attack. Their antennas have to be disconnected 
 *before* the Electromagnetic Pulse arrive. Circuit breakers may 
 protect the process units against EMP, but the antennas will most

MISSILES
Just direct ARMs (Anti-Radiation Missiles) or a higher tech equivalent at
the planet\'s surface. If the missiles are tuned to the frequencies used by
the meson gun\'s sensors then you won\'t go hitting every single military
sensor, just the important ones. You\'d still need an excess of missiles (vs.
number of sensors) to allow for anti-missile laser defences, etc. but it
ought to work.
JAMMING
Jam the meson gun sensors from a starship (probably disguised as a merchant
ship) or, better still, from one or more covert teams operating on the
ground (requires far less power than from space because the jammers are so
much closer to the sensors).
SABOTAGE
Destroy selected sensor sites using covert ground teams. Perhaps they might
even gain access to the meson gun site?
SABOTAGE 2
Gain access to any one sensor site using a covert team - try not to let
anyone else know you\'ve got in. Implant a virus (not \'The Virus\') in their
software - preferably in the communications section; watch as all
communications between the gun and the sensors are cut off at a
predetermined time (just before your ships get in range). Attack!
LOSE POWER
The meson gun must require a substantial power plant with a fuel system. By
the use of covert ground operatives, either (a) contaminate the fuel, (b)
disable the power plant by infiltrating the engineering staff, sending a
sabotage robot down an airshaft, drop a nuke down an airshaft, direct a
nuclear damper at the power plant, etc., etc.

Note the use of \'covert\' above; I do not generally mean this to be troops
dropped from a starship but rather infiltration teams delivered to the
planet in the preceding days under civilian guises.

Now for less subtle approaches:
NUKE \'EM
Drop a swath of nukes on their capital cities (you only need a few to
actually hit). Now tell \'em to turn off the meson gun and let you land or
you\'ll turn the whole planet into Death Valley.
SIEGE \'EM
Seal the system (with ships and mines). Wait for planet to starve (assuming
it is dependent upon something from outside). Tell \'em to turn off the meson
gun... etc.

Any use?

That rather depends on how much AM you use.  The common definition of "a lot
of

xboat
were carrying multiple hundred of tonnes as a fuel source.

Even then, 1000 km is NOT very far in space.

Sensors ? Spaniards get in everywhere. Seriously, though, this situation makes
for a smashing evening\'s play - just put your favourite misfits in the boots of
the troops with this unenviable job, and throw nasties at them. As to attacking
DM sites, the only thing I could think of is neutrino homing atomic missiles -
the DM site must have a whopping great powerplant associated with it somewhere
and destroying this has the dual benefit of stopping your enemy shooting at you
with it and leaving it relatively intact for you to re-commision at leisure
after conquering the planet. Of course, you\'d have to use a _lot_ of missiles to
defeat the defences and that would stiffen up the local guerilla resistance. Ah,
me, the tribulations of interplanetary conquest...

 Ummmm....WWII aircraft carriers? Or WWII LSDs carrying LCMs and
 other smaller craft? Perhaps the numerous fighter/bomber recce
 combinations that the USAF tested out in the early 1950s? Marc
 was a naval freak because his father served in the USN during WWII,
 and the various aspects of space combat were a source of many
 interesting discussions between him, Frank, and myself during
 the design and development of High Guard.

we have time for any kind of culture we need to have

archaeologists to decipher.  This allows you to fudge
the exact cause of the Collapse to suit.

Other items allow me to fudge things in other ways.
The Gloire and Antares supernovas re-arranged 
jumpspace, which allows me to move worlds that I 
find inconveniently positioned, or leave them be, if
I liked them where they were.  It also keeps explorers
on their toes -- the old starcharts may not be too
reliable.  There is precedent for this, as readers of
_Antares_Dawn_ and _Antares_Passage_ know.

The change in physics affecting gravitics is something
that Islands future-history developers will find familiar;
yes, it is the same one.  It also allows me to litter space
with old MegaT ships that don\'t work, and handle the
changes from MT technology to TNE technology without
rewriting Imperial history.  BTW, I *do* use the alternate
tech Thrusters from FF&S.  Yes, it\'s a weird development;
it\'s also a big, hairy plothook -- WHY did gravity change?

I assumed that Imperial era jumpspace theory was some-
what flawed -- there is precedent for it, as both the Hivers
and Vilani had flawed jump theory at one time.  In this case,
the flaw caused scientists to assume that no jump ship 
smaller than 1400 kl could be built -- true in MT, untrue in
TNE.  Another addition to jump theory: spinning gravitational
singularities, such as black holes and some neutron stars,
create very high jump potential "hills" in jumpspace.  On
the 2D jumpspace map, these "hills" appear as rifts or 
bubbles of empty space.  There is actually a system at
the center of such rifts, but it is unapproachable by known
jump drives.  Note that such a system is still accessible thru
normal space... and that a supernova creates a new rift.

The Kyatifa journal is intended to be a "drop-in" background
history for any small "pocket empire"; names were kept fairly
generic.

    (material omitted... )

133/021 : 
     We found another derelict today, a dead ship whose impossible 
drives do not obey our Laws of physics, and thus, do not work.  This one,
mercifully, had no crew aboard.  Had they warning, I wonder, before the Final
Disaster struck?  Or were they merely stranded groundside, unable to return
to their ship, but equally doomed?  What must they have thought of this last,
most awful perversion of their universe?  
    We have only bits and pieces of history from before the 
Collapse; so much was lost. No one really knows how long the 
Collapse was; centuries, at least.  The Collapse we call it here in 
the Cluster; the Aslan Borderers call it Whethwyrt, "when the 
universe was corrupted"; I have heard other terms: the Greater 
Maghiz, Nightfall, the Darktime, Endtime.
    What was the Collapse?  What history we have tells of war, war 
on a scale unimaginable to any now alive, war between empires.  Some
tantalizing fragments hint of civil war or rebellion, but nothing 
conclusive.  Was the Solomani Rim a rebel province or a rival 
empire?  No one knows.
    There was war, invasion, lawlessness -- apparently for an 
extended time.  But that alone would not have caused the Collapse, 
though it must have weakened them, set them up for what was to come. 
    Perhaps the War was the "First Disaster" of the Cynilogic Teachings. The
Second Disaster was the Stardeath.
    Stardeath -- the supernovae of two giant stars "in the course 
of one lifetime".  From what we now know about jumpspace, we have
reconstructed what must have happened -- but to our ancestors, with their
flawed theory of jumpspace, it must have been an appalling violation of
reality.  For the stars...moved.  Two spinning gravitational singularities
wer
e created from those supernovae, and they altered the shape of jumpspace
-- as in the distant past, supernovae created the Great Rifts and the
Abyss-Rift.  And thus, stars still fixed in realspace moved, realigned
themselves in jumpspace.
   This was a devastating blow to the Imperial Civilization of our 
ancestors; already the vital economic ties between worlds had been weakened
by long years of the War.  Now the stars had moved, throwing interstellar
trade and communications into chaos. Is it any wonder that worlds abandoned
their distant neighbors and turned inward, relying on their own
self-sufficiency rather than unreliable interstellar trade?  We presume that
this retreat from the stars explains the outposts found stripped and
abandoned;  for those who left the outposts were still able to leave, to
carry off what was valuable.  But it wasn\'t the Stardeath that killed whole
worlds, leaving vast megapoli inhabited only by the dead and stone-age
savages.
    The Final Disaster is still hard to comprehend; conjecture 
based on Imperial ships and machinery, the Cynilogic Teachings, and the
strangely erroneous bits of technical literature still remaining from the
Imperial period.  One ship could have been dismissed as a fluke, a failed
prototype -- but not all of them.  There is a common thread in much Imperial
machinery --
all based on the same principles, all in agreement with Imperial engineering
texts -- all wrong.  They not only do not work -- they cannot work.
     Gravitics:  the basis for contragrav, anti-acceleration fields, 
thruster plates.  In the ancient Imperial Civilization, the basis 
for those and many other things -- all now impossible.  The very 
physical constants taught in Imperial texts are wrong -- and thus 
all else is wrong.  We were lucky; those flawed texts were 
discovered by archaeologists only a few decades ago, long after we had
redeveloped gravitics from first principles -- merely knowing that it had
been done once, therefore we could do it again. I know of worlds that never
redeveloped gravitics, because they had the help of that fatally flawed
Imperial engineering data.  I 
have heard of a world (Alsace) whose scientists believe gravitics to 
be impossible, because the legends of the ways it was used by 
Imperials are clearly fantastic -- they "know" the universe doesn\'t 
work that way.  Their archaeologists have various questionable 
theories to explain the few derelict Imperial ships discovered in 
their system -- the funniest one is the explanation that the 
derelicts weren\'t real ships at all, but votive offerings to the 
gods of space, to invoke magic by building a deliberately impossible drive.
     Another one of their explanations is that the Imperials used a
sufficiently advanced technology that important details are invisible to us.
 This would almost be believable, except that I have read copies of the
surviving Imperial engineering text, and understand what they thought they
were doing.  And those Alsatian archaeologists have never had to explain a
"cemetary
world".
     I\'ve seen one, a cemetary world.  A world where everyone died 
as all the vital machinery failed at once.  Power stations went dead 
or blew up, vehicles, gravtrains, spaceships suddenly fell dead from the sky,
and all the other machinery failed as power died.  
Machinery like life support on methane atmosphere worlds -- sure, 
there were emergency power supplies -- but how fast can you figure out what\'s
fundamentally wrong with your power plant, redesign and rebuild one from the
ground up -- especially when half your tools don\'t work anymore either, and
the ones that do work are using your scarce emergency power?  And do you
evacuate a suddenly hostile world when none of your vehicles move?  You can\'t
walk to another planet!  
    Then there were the habitable worlds, the ones with survivors 
-- if you can call them that.  The die-off must have been horrendous, when
all the supports of civilization ceased to
function -- no food transported, food production diminished to 
miniscule amounts, no water supply save unsanitary natural rivers, 
no public sanitation, no manufactured goods, no nothing save what 
bare hands can produce and bare feet can carry.  After the 
starvation, rioting and disease killed the megalopoli, a handful of 
survivors took up a hand-to-mouth, stone-age existance in the 
wilderness.  With no education available, no source of information 
(the databanks are all dead, remember), they had to reinvent 
everything from first principles.  A few of them have managed spears and
fire.
  Most of them are club-wielding savages who eat raw whatever they can catch,
including each other.  A very few lucky ones have achieved a stable, though
primitive civilization; all such have traditions of one or more Teacher
figures who brought/preserved important technologies like dirt farming, fire,
building, animal domestication, etc.  Our archaeologists have
found the ruins of an Imperial Scout Service base on one such world; they
guess that Imperial Scouts either came from worlds like ours, or had training
in primitive survival.
     Our own traditions agree with the archaeologist\'s findings on 
the cemetary worlds -- somehow, the Laws of physics affecting 
gravitics changed overnight.  We still don\'t know how or why; we may never
know.  What worked before, became impossible; and what works now would have
been impossible then.  Proud Imperial worlds whose technology was based on
gravitics died overnight.
     And worlds like ours, that have regained the stars?  Traditions 
and archeology have shown us that our ancestors\' worlds were on the fringes
of Imperial Civilization at best.  Home worlds of outsiders, worlds
restricted from participating in Imperial Civilization for one reason or
other -- all worlds that had to rely on their own less-developed
technologies, technologies not based on gravitics but on magnetics,
chemistry, mechanics, atomics, etc.  The bases for our own ancestral
civilizations were not affected by the Final Disaster;  we survived and grew.
     Much was still lost; many worlds had some dependence on 
Imperial technology, but not enough to destroy them.  We fell back, 
but picked ourselves up and continued on.  In some areas, we have equalled or
surpassed the vanished Imperials -- in redeveloping jump theory from first
principles, we acquired new insights that somehow  escaped the Imperials.  So
I assume, for no jump-capable Imperial era ship has been found smaller than
1400 kl.  Instead of jump torpedoes, they appear to have used a network of
unwieldy 1400 kl craft for communications.  We don\'t know if they understood
the relationship between spinning singularities and the shape of  jumpspace;
there\'s not a good sample of Imperial jump theory left....

nearly impossible to invade?

Since the detector array can be disguised (for instance, as ornamental
features of city buildings), that could be difficult unless you plan to
carpet

#1: Put heavy meson screens on your assault landers and 
assault cruisers.

#2: Treason - get someone to betray the location of the meson
gun sites to you.

#3: Obliterate the planet from a distance -- throw rocks, throw
bombs, etc. Do a Berserker number on the world from beyond
meson gun range. (This option reserved for Flag Officers wearing
grey uniforms in large wedge-shaped battleships, or cyborg
psionics wearing black combat armor. :-) )

Based on the silohuettes on the "Imperium" counters of Terran
Confederation and Vilani ships, I would say that the flying wedge
is ancient Terran as well.  The ancient Vilani seemed to have
favored spheres for their ships.

I seem to recall that the footnotes to "Gvurrdon\'s Story" mentioned
that ancient Vargr ships were simple cylinders, and that their
modern preferences did come from that contact with the Zhos.

You forgot to mention Droyne ships.  I assume that the Droyne
ships pictured in the original Droyne module are actually 
Andor-Candory ships (one of the few Droyne shipyards we
know of), as Droyne tastes seem to vary by planet. (Yaskaydroy\'s
ships are very bubbly and organic looking...)  Anyway,
Andorian Droyne ships seem to be very Star Trekkish --
somewhat streamlined bodies with long propulsion pods.

Have you ever actually studied sub-atomic physics?  Like, read
the appropriate chapters in an undergraduate physics text?
I think the scientists at Berkeley who discovered the anti-neutron
in 1955 would be rather surprised to be told it did not exist.

Basic principle of anti-matter: matter & anti-matter are symmetrical,
every particle has a corresponding anti-particle.  Reversed
charge is the obvious difference between matter and anti-matter,
but it is not the only difference.  There are anti-neutrinos, too,
which have neither mass nor charge. 

BTW, two neutrons colliding will not annihilate each other; an
anti-neutron and a neutron colliding will, yielding gamma rays and
a neutrino, anti-neutrino pair, if I remember correctly. (Physicists
in the audience can correct me...)

Accelerated particle beams do travel at near light speed -- and
can you imagine the fire control problems involved in hitting
a stream of atom-sized particles travelling at near lightspeed?

Answers on a postcard...

1) "Modern" (TL 8+) Trav weapons use caseless cartridges.

2) That\'s why lefties get left-handed receivers.  Steve cites the
British Individual Weapon, which has two spare parts that are 
swapped out to change from right-handed to left-handed.  Steve
says all Real World bullpup weapons that he knows of come in
right & left-handed versions.

3) You don\'t need to have a bullpup to get a faceful of hot brass
when shooting a rifle offhand.  I\'ve shot both SKS and MAC-90 
(semi-auto AK-47), and they both throw brass all over the place.
I was told of an incident where someone lost an eye shooting a 
right-handed MAC-90 left-handed -- brass case thrown in his eye.
Most Real World guns (not just bullpups) are available in both 
right- and left-handed versions for that reason -- no one likes
cases thrown across their face (or into their face!).

It is important to note that all the SB ships I\'ve bashed have been
changed a fair bit.  I ground the \'flying bridge\' parts off all of them,
and the bridges are a raised bump (like an airliner) on the top front
(it pre-exists on the models).  In addition, I added slightly forward
swept \'wings\' (4 of \'em) arranged like an x-wing from star wars (like
the ship on the cover of The Journal of the TAS #23 (dunno if it was
ever printed... I don\'t have any past #22, but the cover was shown in
the "next issue\' section)

I hadn\'t noticed this before.  Are there *any* pictures of decent sized
ships (10,000 being barely decent)?  I only wonder since it seems that
smaller ships would be more varied within a culture simply because
they\'re built in more shipyards (as well as by local gov.s for \'coast
guard\' stuff).

Hadn\'t seen this either, but it works for the ones we\'ve played with so
far :)

I haven\'t seen the Stedlas at all (I have most of the CT, some of the
MT, and some of the TNE stuff... but I don\'t have many of the FASA ship
designs which seem to be most of the canon Zho stuff)

If I were to come up with a bunch of designs that we thought were cool,
what do you think the reaction would be given that the observations
you\'ve made are only based on 5-6 ships? (there isn\'t much to work with
here, which is why I wanted some input :)

My critters all look tail heavy at this point, too.  Yipee :)

Who would?  On a related note, at the velocities that ships move, sloped
armor (as well as having the ship pointing along its vel. vector) would
help defeat micro (and not so micro) meteor impacts (the impact missile
discussions, along with some simple calculations of the
damage/penetration values for bullet-sized particles at 100km/sec made
us think about this)

I\'d say damn near all military ships that would operate away from fleets

I agree, yucky picture.  One of my (greatly altered)  EDF Patrol
Cruisers is upwards of 400 tons.  Once I finish the basic hull form,
I\'ll make a mold, and cast it in urathane resin--then I\'ll find out its
volume based on the resin\'s density (it\'s damn hard to do volumes on the
odd shapes, but my upper limit on this one is 550, and the lower is 270
tons--before adding wings and other goodies, so maybe it\'ll be a shiva
:)

I kind of agree here, but since we\'re interested in a CT setting (using
TNE stuff) in the Marches, we wanted Zho ships.  The only pic we had
seem to be the majority of the ones you mention, but we didn\'t think
there were enough to make a decent generalization.  I axed the flying
bridge \'cause I thought it looked goofy, and wreaked the otherwise
streamlined shape.

Thanks for the ideas, and once I get some casted up, the stats can
always be altered if they all look wrong for a given region.

Greetings,
While fellow TMLer Tariq Rashid and I were waiting to get into Star
Trek, we started talking about Planetary assualts in Battle Rider.
Tariq had just made up a meson gun designed as a Deep Site Meson gun,
ie one to be buried deep underground in a planet, for planetary
defense.  We started to wonder how to fight one of these.
  Sensors won\'t be able to see it, sense it is buried under ground, I
assume it is deep enough to damp out all E-M radiation.  So you won\'t
be able to simply shoot it.
 The buried meson gun will need sensors on the surface to see enemy
ships so it can shoot them.  But the sensors can be spread across a
planet.  By the time an orbiting ship can start a sensor sweep to
detect the sensors, the deep site gun will fire on it, mostly likely
blowing it up or crippling it.
The only thing I could think of was to drop troops on to the surface,
basically below the senors, and have troops run around trying to find
the dishes and blow them up.
 Can anyone figure out another angle of attack.
 ----

Sure can! All you need is a passive EMS ( or similar ) and for the meson gun 
to shoot at you as couple of times!! This works well if you have a lot of 
ships or strong screens.
As I understand it the mesons used have a very short half-life before they 
decay into other particles and energy. As the meson beam travels to the 
target, individual mesons decay along the way thus providing an energy trace 
that may be triangulated if the meson gun fires at a moving target more than 
once. Once the triangulated position is determined you can blast it out of 
existance with your own meson guns.

True - I believe that is why the NPAWS is not introduced until the same tech 

level as the other gravetic technologies.  Remember, too, that we are 
talking
about technologies which (in the case of the Alliance ships which have been
posted on xboat) can produce and handle anti-matter on a scale that, seems,
well, pure science fiction ;-).

I seem to recall in FF&S that that NPAWS in fact fire Helium nuclei ( 2P,2N 
) through a cloud of electrons that stick to the nuclei thus forming neutral 
atoms. The electrons could even be accelerated as well thus providing a 
handy mechanism for fine beam control.

Now, it is clear from your answer that you are quite knowledgable on these
matters, but I find the conclusion surprising.

Looking first at the neutron stream impacting armour: The armour is dense 
and thick, designed to absorb attacks such as this.  That means that there 
is a high probablity that the neutron, having caused some photon release, 
broken up a few neuclei, etc will finally exhaust itself having done some 
degree of damage to the material proportional (more or less) to its kinetic 
energy.  This will doubtless cause some damage to the hull material (such as 
happens, say, to the materials within a fission reactor) but will probably 
cause most of its
effects to the target as a result of secondary radiation: I believe that 
this was
expected to be the main cause of AFV crew kills with the neutron bomb.

On the other hand, the anti-neutron stream will do damage not only as a
result of the kenetic effects but as a result of the release of the 
rest-energy of
both the anti- and target neutron.  Also, since the target material is
designed to absorb neutrons, the stream should be fully converted to energy 
within a very short period of time.  I would expect that the  resulting 
release of energy and wholesale atomic breakdown within the fabric of the 
hull itself should not just have particle level effects: there should be 
obvious macroscopic effects from the shock wave as a portion of the target 
suddenly becomes a plasma.

That is, wouldn\'t it blow a boody great hole in the hull?

I am prepared to be disuaded of this (Lord knows it wouldn\'t be the first
time on this list). ;-).
 ----

Yes, an anti-neutron beam should be more devastating than a neutron beam but 
why use neutrons? Whats wrong with anti-hydrogen of anti-helium used in the 
manner I describe above?

There have been complaints on tml about the penetration performance of 
(small arms) lasers.
The rules in FF&S have made the assumption that it is impossible to focus a 
laser on any area with a diameter smaller than 1 cm!
As this is clearly at variance with reality I propose a new rule.

Lasers may be designed with a short range less than the maximum allowed.
This may result in an intensity (I) greater than that at the maximum 
allowed. This intensity (I) figure is to be used for IPR calculations ONLY.
The normal intensity figure is used for damage calculations.

This should make handheld (but short ranged) lasers more capable against 
armoured targets.

    'body' => '     Several people have brought up the issue of Laser penetration, which 
     reminded me of some questions I had when first reading FF&S.
     
     Derek Smith writes that he can\'t get a small arms laser to have a 
     non-nil penetration.  Presumably this is because "Intensities ... of 
     less than ... 0.39 Mj / cm^2 ... have a final penetration rating of 
     nil" (FF&S p129, para. 7C).
     
     In this part of the design sequence, IPR (Inverse Penetration Rating) 
     is calculated as an intermediary step in calculating final penetration 
     rating (it doesn\'t seem to be used anywhere else).
     
         Penetration rating = 1 / IPR.
     
         IPR of less than 0.5 is rounded down to 0, giving a penetration 
     rating of Nil.
     
     This means that lasers can only have fractional penetration ratings, 
     or 1, or Nil:
     
         IPR    Penetration rating
         ----    ----
         3      1/3
         2      1/2
         1      1
         0.499  Nil
     
     It strikes me as odd that a laser couldn\'t have a penetration rating 
     of, say, 2 or 3, like other small arms.  The only thing stopping this 
     in the rules is the statement that an IPR of less than 0.5 gives a 
     penetration rating of Nil.  There is a brief explanation given for 
     this in the rules, but I can\'t follow its logic.  I don\'t know whether 
     this is due to my lack of understanding, or a mistake on the 
     designers\' part.
     
     Throwing caution to the wind (well, you only live once :-)) I propose 
     that the offending statement be thrown out, and IPR should only be 
     rounded if it is going to produce a fractional penetration rating 
     (e.g. IPR of 9.3 rounds to IPR=9 -> Pen=1/9), otherwise the IPR is not 
     rounded, but the final penetration rating IS (e.g. IPR=0.3 -> Pen of 
     3.3 rounds to Pen=3).
     
     Using this proposition, I ran some figures through, to see what I got:
     
         I (Mj/cm^2)  DV  Pen           Hard AV that can be penetrated
         ----  --  ----           ----

         6.25         125 1/2           lots!
     
     Looking at these figures, it seems possible to design a laser that CAN 
     cut through Battle Dress:
     
         TL14 Battle Dress AV=8.
     
         Laser, I=0.25Mj/cm^2, IPR=0.4 -> DV=25, Pen=3.
     
     Of course, all this hinges on Penetration ratings of >1 being allowed 
     for lasers.  If anyone can explain to me why they shouldn\'t (i.e. why 
     the current rules are right, and I\'m wrong), then please put me right.

Several people suggested either nuking the entire planet, or dropping
rocks on it.  I was trying to avoid destroying the planet, and
commiting genocide.  Also I think according to the old Library Data
book, didn\'t the imperial rules of War prohibit the use of nuclear weapons.  

Another popular idea, is treason.  While this is the ideal situation,
knowing where the gun is before hand, I didn\'t think it would always be
possible, otherwise why have a deep site gun.  Though i am sure
considerable effort would be directed down this road.  

Erich Schneider says:

I can\'t see how. The only way to detect the mesons is to be a target,
and  the target probably won\'t be long for this world.  Meson guns are
firing rather tight beams of particles, triangulation normally works
for broadcasting, like Tv or radio signals.

Why would they need sensors off the planet?  I hadn\'t really thought
about how the sensors communicate with the gun, if they used local
phone lines or something, these would just become the target, so they
would need meson communicators.  But those are really expensive, and
only available at TL 15, i think, Maybe they could have dedicated
lines, buried underground, or something, still pretty expensive.
Something to think about.

I kind of assume by tl 15 electronics can be hardened pretty easily,
and cheaply.  Isn\'t this normally done with by encasing all electronics in
metal,

The planet would be using passive sensors.  With the diameter of a

This was the best that I could come up with also.  As someone else

I figured the power plant is next to the gun, ie deep underground also.
 the fuel would just be hydrogen, so kinda of hard to contaminate.  The
best way to get the hydrogen would be from an  undeground river, and
just purify it on the premises.

Tariq, had actually designed this thing to blow through heavy meson

this meson gun. :)

Point 1:

The AM missile would have a BIG BOOM, *much* bigger than a nuke if
done properly.

But it depends on how much AM you want to put on it.  You certainly
don\'t want to make it any easier to shoot down than other missiles.
And you have to prevent accidents while carrying them, too.

A magazine hit on nuclear missiles probably won\'t cause a nuclear
explosion.  A magazine hit on AM missiles means you can kiss your
ass goodbye.


Point 2:

There\'s nothing wrong with the Plasma Grenade, because:

You don\'t *throw* grenades.  You *launch* grenades.

Besides, Jonathan "Gronk" Verdell likes them.  You wouldn\'t want
to have an argument with *him*, would you? 8^)

A few years ago (maybe 10, I dunno\') I developed a rather extensive
database of information as well as a bunch of new ships for the
original GDW Traveller.

One in particular was based on the current ballistic missile
submarines.  A stealthed cruiser carrying 18 or so 50 ton, Durasteel
slugs, with ablative reentry coatings.  This thing pops in-system,
somewhere over the plane of the ecliptic and a good distance out from
the target planet, and pumps these puppies out at 25,000 Kps.  The
onboard computers are large enough to compute orbital tracks for impact
on population centers (there\'s no real need to be accurate or
anything).  The ship itself dumps back into warp, and is gone.  A month
later, if all goes properly (and it should, finding 50 tons of radar
absorbing material outside of the normal plane of search has got to be
exceedingly difficult), You should be able to PULVERIZE any pretargeted
sites dirt-side.  It makes for a nice, clean (radiation-wise), softener
for assault troops.  Hell, if the planet is small enough, you might
just peel off the atmospheric shell.

As a matter of fact, this would make one hell of a blackmail tool. 
Hold whole planets under the "Rocks of Damocles" as it were.  They pay,
you pipe them the orbital tracks.  The don\'t pay, POOF, instant
ice-age.  Oh what a drag, sucks to be you.

Possessions: Anything he want\'s, he get\'s.  

             His most famous possessions include ancient German 
             memorabelia (including the only known surviving East German 
             flag in existence), and a Sio Moff zero-G glass sculpture, 
             presented to his ancestors by Crown Prince Cleon, son of 
             Cleon IV (born 423, crowned 475, assassinated 555).
 
             Most of his families\' treasured possessions is feared 
             lost, somewhere in Magyar sector. 

             The possessions that von Schunamann most loves, however, are 
             his collection of TL F battle mecha.  These 12-15 m high 
             vechiles/androids, armed with explosive devices (which cause 
             more flash than damage)  are used in a variety of "Mechasports".

Background:  von Schunamann is the achnowledged head of the Schunamann 
             family.  The 60 acknowledged family members form the core of 
             SuSAG; once a megacorp with interest\'s across the Imperium, 
             it\'s now restricted to the Regency providing chemicals, 
             pharmaceuticals, biogeneered products, and 
             semi-legal psi boosters. 

             von Schunamann is only an adequate CEO, delegating much of 
             his duties to trusted aides and pulling the regins only when he 
             needs to.  He spend\'s much of his time either meeting 
             figurehead duties, enjoying himself in very high social circles
             or playing Mechwarrior with other profoundly wealthy men.  
             [Mechawar is to the Regency what Polo was to the British
Empire].

             von Schunamann is happly married - maintaining not even one 
             concubine, to the astonishment of Court circles - and 
             delight\'s in his eight children.

              A duffel bag "with all my worldly possessions"
              2000 Cr... in Darrian currency

Background:  Pidiris Razlehmehid is a large, rather gregarious fellow, 
             both strong and intelligent.  He lives to sing, but also 
             enjoys a bit of roughhousing and carousing wherever he 
             goes.  Like about 30% of Darrians, he doesn\'t believe that 
             humans originated on Terra, putting that belief down to typical 
             Solomani supremist dogma. 

             Razlehmehid is a strong, powerful tenor, and a member of a 
             Darrian \'Tengobhes\' group of singers.  Tengobhes groups 
             specialize in Ancient Darrian Hymns and chants in a style 
             most closely resembling Islamic forms of singing, often 
             spin-dancing at the same time.  Of course, Razlehmehid himself 
             is not a believer in the long-dead Yalema faith.

             His Tengobhes group is composed of four men (including 
             himself, there\'s Dulyunal Zgehngehbher, Pune Mbalzihrer, and 
             Zlaneyr Nyeghihndihligh).  After several marginally 
             profitable tours in the Darrian Confederation, they have 
             decided to take their first tour in the Regency, where 
             Tengobhes singing is still a rarity.  Because they can\'t 
             speak Anglic - and are still in culture shock - the other three 
             singers have unofficaly made Razlehmehid their leader.

             Razlehmehid is married, and has two young daughters - and a 
             nephew - to care for.  Whenever possible, he visit\'s them 
             back on Darrian.

              A "Child Alloeance" of 1000 Cr / month

Background:   A rather bland, stout woman, Mrs. Stanely is infamous 
              subsector-wide as the sole survivor of the doomed shuttle 
              Wayrith. 

              The Wayrith was en-route to an insystem mining colony when 
              an engine malfunction occurred.  Because of the loss of fuel, 
              the best the captain could do was put the shuttle in an 
              elliptical orbit around the colony, and await rescue.

              Rescue was long in coming.  Meanwhile, food ran out, and 
              eventually lots were drawn to determine who get\'s eaten.  Mrs. 
              Stanley - the sole woman on-board - managed to excempt 
              herself on the basis of her pregnacy and persuading the men 
              not to kill her. "Imagine what the press would say!  You 
              wouldn\'t last a day in court!"

              When the rescuers finally arrived, only Mrs. Stanely and 
              her newborn infant lived.  When they spotted her - in a 
              haze of bones, split for their marrow - her first words were 
              "Look, darling!  Food!  Food!"

              She arrived home in a wave of sensationalism and notoriety.
              Aquitted of all charges, she became very wealthy and a 
              major figure of controversy.  Most of her money she blew in 
              buying a large home in a prestigous ungerground location, but 
              she still has enough to tour the subsector with her 6-year old 
              son.

Background:  A portly, arrogant man from a rich agricultural world, 
             Zautienzhvlaz is a walking turn-off to his fellow graduate 
             students at MRO University.  With his thich accent and 
             less-than-perfect command of Anglic (he refuses to use his 
             translator outside of class, perferring to pratice his 
             incomprehensable Anglic instead), Zautienzhvlaz endlessly 
             preaches the superiority of Zhodani civilization to anyone 
             within striking distance.

             He hates the Nobility.  He hates the Democratic reforms.  He 
             hates the immoral entertainment districts.  He hates the 
             clumsiness of Regency design.  He hates Regency art.  He 
             _vocally_ hates anything that suggests either greed or deceit.
             About the only thing he likes is the psionic reforms, that 
             he feels will inevitabily lead to the Regency becoming  
             Just Like Zhodane.  And whenever possible, he will rub the 
             PC\'s noses into the fact that the Collapse was caused by 
             Imperials, and the Consulate was untouched by it.

             Why is Zautienzhvlaz in the Regency at all, over 110 
             parsec\'s from home?   Mainly because he cannot believe that 
             the Imperials crushed the Zhodane navy at Rhylanor, ending the 
             Fifth Frontier War (1107 - 1110).  His doctorate, focusing 
             on the battle, is his intellectual attempt to explain away this 
             defeat.  He also has an interest in robotics, and was 
             profoundly dissapointed to learn that the Rhylanor Institute of 
             Technology was closed down, giving him one more thing to whine 
             about.

              Errgh Okzarsdaem battalion).

              But after being transferred back to Regina for the last 2 
              years, she realized that her carrer has ground to a halt.
              Coupled with a lack of excitement and friends, she has become
              in turns weepy and irritable, alienating those around her.

              Currently, she is saving for a trip back home, to Kubishush.

             Made an oath of "Poverty, Chasitity, Obedience"

Background:  Mother Superior Witherspoon is an imposing and forthright 
             woman, even in her Order\'s white habit with ornate gold & black
             trim.  She considers her command of the 25,000 Disp jumpship 
             _St. Degaaka of Aladon_ to be a trust from God, and is 
             relentless in preserving that trust. 

             Born on a backward world on the edge of the Quarrentine 
             Zone, Witherspoon became a Catholic nun at 12.  Educated at 
             Antra, capital of the subsector (Astra: Deneb/1808 
             A53789C-E  Cp 501 Re M0D K5D), she became a doctor at the 
             Free University of Immin Shishadiim and joined the Order of 
             Holy Succor, a medical order.

             As a member of that order, she was posted to _st. Degaaka of 
             Aladon_, a medical/convent jumpship.  With a crew of 130, the 
             73-year old ship is equipped to TL D standards, with 700 
             beds and medical facilities to match. 

             Sister Witherspoon was only elevated to Mother Superior two 
             years ago, and her hands-on style conflicts with the 
             administration & bureaucratic needs of the convent.  Moreover, 
             she has only limited leadership qualities, tending to ram her 
             way through problems and expecting that everyone will 
             automatically do her duty, scolding those who don\'t meet her 
             detailed standards. 

             Currently the _St. Degaaka of Aladon_ is posted to District 
             268, a backward subsector troubled by Aslan/Human 
             conflicts.  The _St. Degaaka_ is desprately needed here, as so 
             many systems have no access to TL D+ medical care.   But 
             money is tight and Collace (District 268: Spinward Marches/1237 
             B628943-D S Hi In 101 Na F1V M6D), the only port that can 
             repair the aging _St. Degaaka_, is harrasing the convent to 
             please the Aslans, who oppose a Regency hospital ship in 
             the subsector.

Background:   Mr. O\'Connor is a slim, kindly old man with a warm voice.  
              His long face - graced with laugh lines - and gracious manners 
              hardly seems to belong to a professional psychopath, but it 
              does.

              Born in the corrupt Kingdom of Siev perogy, his 
              intelligence and lack of scrples eventually landed him a 
              place in the local Secret Service.  However, while a majjor 
              revolt seemed about to topple the Kingdom, he judiciously sold 
              out several of his fellow agents while refining his image as 
              "The Wise Old Man" to his subordinates, thus protecting his 
              safety in both camps.
 
              At 1177, after the Kingdom was \'unexpectedly\' overthrown, 
              O\'Connor found a new position as an enforcer for SuSAG.
              Reliable and discreet, he would carefully research and 
              observe his target before striking, by either gliding a blade 
              across the unsuspecting victim\'s jugular or by flicking a 
              monofiliment pumpknife into the base of the skull, again from 
              the back.  Only rarely would he resort to the rifle, an 
              "inelegant instrument", not quite as fine a kill as the knife.

              O\'Connor usually is sent after "white collar" criminals 
              who threatened the company (both employees and otherwise).  
              Even though the divided and (largely) corrupt local police 
              looked the other way, a "posting to Porozol" is quietly 
              dreaded by SuSAG managers in Rylanor subsector.

Background:  Locked away in his low berth, Baron Arellano is probably the 
             last of the Civil War era combatents (604 - 622)

             A flightly, vainglorious man with a fixation on "My Destiny 
             of Greatness", he was an eccentric noble on the raw frontier of 
             the Spinward Marches.  Half of the systems were still 
             unsettled, and he spent most of the time acting as defacto 
             judge on lawless Regina.

             As Emperor battled Emperor back in Core, Arellano got the 
             idea that his Calling has arrived.  He declared himself 
             Emperor, and managed to raise up a ragtag fleet of armed 
             merchants and patrol cutters before leaving for Core.

             He never left the Marches.  Grand Admiral Arabellatra Alkalikoi
             sent a minor task force to stop the Baron. Althought they 
             never quite caught him, they did force him to abandon his 
             half-baked plans and live the pirate life.  Time after time 
             he\'d devise a Rube Goldberg scheme to get past the task force, 
             and time after time it would blow up in a wild and wolly 
             manner.

             Finally, he was forced to abandon his fleet, and in 618 
             retired to his hideaway on 728-907.  On a whim, he set the 
             controls to 1201 and retired to see what the glorious future 
             would hold.

----

BTW: Baron de la Arellano is dedicated to the memory of the French 
Emperor Napoleon III, who once tried to conquer France by loading a ship 
with about 50 ruffians, and crossing the Channel to France and Glory!

Well, it didn\'t _quite_ work out... but he later did get himself elected 
Persident, and two years later proclaimed himself Emperor.

P.S. at the time of the Civil War...
    - the top Imperial TL was 13
    - the Solomani Confederation was part of the Imperium
    - the Imperium included Foreven Sector
    - there were no x-boat routes
    - the closest anti-grav cities were in Vland Sector
    - the 2nd Frontier War was raging (615 - 620)
    - there were no Aslan\'s this side of the Great Rift

              Offical head of the Ansirk Biosculpting Project

Background:   Born and raised in the Kairovan community on Mora, Miss. Daya
              is one of the very few who can claim to be a pure-blooded 
              Arab.  From her youth she wanted to follow in the footsteps of 
              her ultra famous great-grandfather Ali Daya (1088 - 1150).  
              Ali Daya\'s suite of four interconnected biosystems under the 
              themes of "Loyalty, Trial, Victory" ranks with the best of the 
              Old Masters in Dasudashag, and had the same effect on the 
              Deneb artistic community as the 1118 tri-v film "Stand on 
              Rhylanor" had on the general populance, or the Connie 
              Chung series "Why We Are Imperials", or Norris\' Ascension 
              Speech when he was formally proclaimed Archduke.

              Sherali Daya stayed away from the epic-scale work of her 
              great-grandfather for years, focusing instead on doing regular 
              commission work.  But as her reputation & skill grew so did 
              her aspirations, and in 1192 she accepted a commission from a 
              Fleet Admiral to create a new biosphere for the Naval Base at 
              Ansirk, home of 7 million Naval personnel.

              The biosphere - to reside strictly within the installation, 
              as the world is airless - is to emphasise the motif 
              "Controlled Fury".  This theme is sympolized by the Terran 
              lions, Vilani anshuui, and Reginian LiClok which stalk 
              some of the corridors and parks of the station.  The predators 
              (actually as safe as dogs) are simply at the top of the 
              station\'s "biosystem", which extends down to the carefully 
              bred rats and tailored airborne viruses.  

              Probably the most charming change to the station has been the 
              introduction of perenay\'s; a geneered variation of the white 
              dove, with rainbow-coloured wing feathers.  The ones at the 
              station have been bred for low-G flight, and are \'wired\' to 
              preform complex aerobatic flight patterns and make a most 
              haunting call.

Correct - except that (anti-)neutrinos may actually have a very small
mass - experiments are still being performed to find out if this is the
case.

Its a LOT more complicated than that. The products depend on the energy at
which they collide. At rest, in the perfect case where all three quark
pairs annihilate you have three interactions and hence 3 photons or 3
neutrino/anti-neutrino pairs can be created (or any mixture of the two).
At higher energies what will happen is something called the \'Drell-Yan\'
process where one quark and anti-quark \'scatter\' off each other. The two
scattered quarks will then produce showers of particles (99% of the time)
as will the neutron and anti-neutron remnants. As far as I know only
proton-proton and proton-antiproton interactions like the above have been
studied, however the mechanisms should be the same.

I hope that\'s understandable - sorry for being technical!

>Why would they need sensors off the planet?

You could get better range performance.  For Earth, the Moon is at
12 hexes (1.2 light seconds) or so -- perhaps a sensor or ten out
there might be useful.  Also it would avoid the "evil aliens that
sneak up on us from behind the Moon" problem -- a meson gun could
fire *through* the Moon to hit oncoming ships before any other
line-of-sight weapons on the planet can come to bear (are unmasked).

Passive sensors are quite expensive and big, so long-range active
sensors still have a place here.

I\'d like to see this!  I have the key component for a deep-site
meson gun finished, a 70000 disp-ton weapon which has a _Battle
Rider_ DV to five hexes (short range) of *20*!  Because of the way
that meson screens work, I think that only the largest ships could
carry a screen of the magnitude needed to stop this.  The BBs in
_Battle Rider_ don\'t carry screens that powerful.

One house rule I use to restrict deep-site meson guns is that
the gun mechanism itself may take up no more volume than the
sphere it is mounted in.  Power plants, screens, housing, and
other supporting systems need not be in the sphere.  Starships
don\'t have this restriction since the whole ship orients to
fire anyway.  For the most part, this doesn\'t cause any troubles,
and it gives a natural power level for the planet-bound weapon
to be designed for.

Incidentally, protecting the meson gun with a meson screen does
not keep it from being able to fire -- battleships and cruisers
seem to have no problem with having both, in TNE.  It *does*
prohibit reciept of meson communications.  However, a deep-site
can remedy this by placing its\' meson communicator in a place
buried underground but *outside* the meson screen, and then
relaying the messages by land line, lasercom through a tunnel,
or some such.

>Does anyone remeber what TL Terra was at, when it was captured.
>Wondering if it had any meson guns.

In _Invasion: Earth_, the best Terran and Solomani troops were
equipped to TL14, but many regular troops had to make do with
TL13 equipment.  Urban guerrillas had TL13.  The three best (TL14)
Terran ground-to-air defenses were rated as corps, and had a
larger bombardment rating than the best Imperial BatRons\'
defensive ratings.  Furthermore, there were a large number of
lesser static defenses that *matched* the average BatRons\'
defensive ratings.  Expected troop concentrations were light
from our current understanding of a high-pop world\'s military,
but the Battle of Terra was at the end of a long war, and maybe
neither side had much left.  (Or perhaps neither side wanted to
do too much damage to Terra.)

A few more questions:

(1) Could you post to me personally the MT stats for your alliance ships;
I would like to try and do a conversion to BL. If you are interested
please post any additional info which may be of help.

(2) The Alliance was founded by.. the Solomani? Yes? If so, when? If the
society is broadly Solomani in origin, that is, originated from pre-Long
Night era, then would they be free of the bigotry towards other races
that was so prevalent in contemporary Solomani before the collapse?

(3) Does the Alliance have a full name?

(4) Is the Alliance a uniform TL 17 culture, or did the Alliance manage
to obtain TL17 due to the threat of the Imperium, that is, Alliance TL is
TL15 (to bring it inline with the rest of charted space) and the Alliance
has TL17 military equipment?

P.S. Anyone want to introduce a race to T:TNE that is similar to Iain M.

P.P.S. What is the current financial status of GDW. I know that theyve
changed the method of payment for writers in Challenge, but they arent
going to go belly up in the near future?

Assualt?  What\'s an assualt?  Oh, you mean Assault!  Silly me. 8^)

I don\'t remember what TL Terra enjoyed when it was captured, but
it definitely was high enough for Meson Guns.

I have an issue of Challenge with an adventure in it that tells how
the Vilani of the *FIRST* Imperium were horrified the first time the
TERRANS used Meson Guns on THEM.

Remember, Meson Guns first become available at TL 11.

And Meson *SCREENS* don\'t become available until TL 12!!!

(What fun!)

As Erich mentioned, pions decay very quickly (like 10E-15 seconds or so
if memory serves). You have to remember that while the beam will be
narrow, the z focus (z being the distance along the beam) will be
regulated by the uncertainty of the meson decays.  Even with very
careful attention, some of the mesons will decay to gammas along the
way----and the resulting gammas don\'t *have* to travel along the beam,
they are free to radiate the way they \'want\' to.

The bottom line is that you\'d expect to see some extraneous gamma
radiation coming from the beam pathway.

Howdy folks,

well, I just got the first of my TNE minis (I had to order it since no
one in town carries them).  It\'s a Patrol Cruiser.

The scale is hard to figure out.  Does anyone have the FASA deck plans
for this critter?  According to the stats in BL, it is 66m long (of
course this is the goofy number you get from the config table, so it is
meaningless).  If it *is* 66m long, then the figure represents a 72 ton
boat (at 1:1138 scale).  The sculpting is pretty good, though.  The
casting job is decent, but it appears to be compressed dorso-ventrally.

I guess I have to buy another to see what the scale really is (an SDB
seems good for this, or a free trader).

On a related note, what would you guys prefer, tiny (5-6 cm) ships in
different scales (so they\'d fit more or less over the BL hexes) or
slightly larger ships in a consistant scale (so players could have a
feel for relative sizes of the ships they live and work in)?

So far my sculpts have all been in 1:1000 scale, so a scout is 38mm
long, etc.  It was *really* surprising to mock up a Tigress BB in this
scale... I used to think 500,000 tons was big, it really isn\'t, though.

Anyway, I thought I\'d comment since I had asked about the scale earlier.

If the true length is known, let me know and I\'ll post the scale of the
mini Patrol Cruiser, as well as its actual displacement (I think it
would have to be over 120 meters long to displace anywhere *near* 400
tons).

Wrong, actually there is easier to "burn" through the jamming when the
jamming
source get closer to the sensor. It is better to jam from orbit, but still
better to detonate a few nukes, cheaper too :)

     Metal do conduct current it won\'t work I believe. A Farraday cage
     or something will help, but you can\'t encase the whole thing into it
     Besides sensor use will be pretty rotten anyway as the nukes will
     cause static disturbances for normal sensor use. It will be even more
     effective than traditional jamming.
     Another matter is that the civilian population will probably revolt or

It is in no way uniform.  Some of the worlds (example: mine, Colchis)
were considerably "behind the times".  I started at a considerable
disadvantage (TL 10), though.

I wish we\'d gamed out the full endgame (and that I\'d kept active towards

the Imperial Navy would have done trying to occupy Colchis in the face
of 30,000 missile batteries with TL 15 and hopefully 16 fire control ;-)

Accepted. 1000km is hand-to-hand in space! As an interesting side issue, have
you ever tried designing a ship using MT ship sequences and the AM power plants

Hi All, 

I would like to emphatically concur with A.S.Lilly wrt LOOOOONG POSTS.
Although the new TML and XBOAT lists are generating more volume than
the old TML, the quality posts seem down. Items like craft/vehicle
designs, arguments, discussions, and useful campaign ideas are masked
by multiple posts, archived posts, and other bandwidth wasters.

TML and XBOAT remain my favorite lists. The best way to check 
the credibility of a plot or rules alteration is to post it and 
let everyone take potshots. It is just that I have been leaning
on the page down key in my mailer and awful lot lately.

Now, a question...

If I had a lot of campaign info to publicly post where should I
send it? Any ftp sites out there taking submissions?

feared that the detonation of an atomic bomb would trigger a fusion
reaction in the Earth\'s atmosphere, essentially setting it on fire and
destroying Life As We Know It. 

Seems like a good reason for the change in physical laws would be various
Black Weapons from Lucan\'s faction, designed to temporarily change local
physical laws.  There are examples of this in previous Traveller
Adventures, most notably the "Relativity Pistol" in the DGP adventure
Knightfall.  If one of these weapons were just a bit too big, perhaps the 
catalytic effect of the newly created physical constants would propagate 
throughout known space.  I\'m thinking of "Ice-9" from the novel Cat\'s 
Cradle here, of course.

I\'m not sure why I like this idea better than the Supernova concept - 
perhaps it\'s just more dramatic if we can blame things on human agency

another crime against Humaniti.

Sorry, there\'s no such critter. The only stats that exist at present are High

> (2) The Alliance was founded by.. the Solomani? Yes? If so, when?

Yes. Three Cluster worlds were colonized about 1100 years ago by three
sublight ships that had left Terra during the first half of the 21st century
(I don\'t have the exact dates here). The other Cluster worlds were then
colonized from those three. Most of the Alliance worlds in the Trojan Reach
were colonized by the Solomani sometime before the Long Night (I gather) at
the same time all the other Solomani worlds there were colonized.

> then would they be free of the bigotry towards other races 
> that was so prevalent in contemporary Solomani before the collapse?

Well, I agree with Steve\'s ideas about the "bigotry" being a figment of an
Imperial propoganda writer\'s imagination. That said, the Alliance itself
isn\'t especially bigoted. One of the worlds (Esperanza, I think) tried to
exterminate the native Droyne population long ago in their history, but as
far as I know the locals look on that as an embarassing mistake. The people
(or at least the leaders) of the Serendip Belt were extremely bigoted, as
evidenced by their genocidal attack on the primitive Orpheides, but they\'re
pretty much all dead now. Neubayern (and the worlds settled by it) regards
bigotry as a particularly loathsome form of mental illness.

Beyond those examples, the subject hasn\'t been addressed, but I would say
generally the Alliance populace is free of bigotry, and government policy
certainly is.

> (3) Does the Alliance have a full name?

It started out as the "Old Islands Alliance." As it expanded, that became
"Islands Alliance." In 5650 it would be the "Rift Alliance," or maybe the
"Trans-Rift Alliance."

> (4) Is the Alliance a uniform TL 17 culture,

Not at all. The military capability is uniform--that is, any shipyard could
build an AM powered ship using all the most advanced technology (which gets
as high as TL18 in power generation). The culture as a whole is rather more
variable, and lower. Browne, which was TL9 9 years ago, is probably only up
to TL11 or so in its overall standard of living, whereas New Home, which
started at TL13 19 years ago, is probably up to TL15 by now. Most of the
other Alliance worlds are probably around a TL12-14 standard of living.

General Question
Inspired by a recent post of the Azhanti High Lightning, I sat down and designed an
Atlantic-class Cruiser.  I have not, however, played Brilliant Lances, so my design
is basically a shot in the dark.  I have a few questions for all comers (including the 
folks at GDW, if so inclined):
1 - A Ship of the Line Meson Gun.  I did one with more than 600 damage at short 
range (9 hexes).  Is this too weak?
2.  Meson Screens.  This ship has a meson screen that could not be penetrated
by its own main weapon (PV about 700).  Is this out of line?
3.  Armor.  I\'ve got about 400 points of armor on this beast.  It seemed to
me that
     I could easily armor the ship against most turret/barbette lasers (including those
     from Roger Myhre\'s laser list) but this would be useless against many of the big
     guns (bay lasers, Particle Accelerators, etc).  I remember a brief thread 
     on armor values, but did any consensus get reached?  I foolishly discarded the
     post before I got more info. 
4.  Damage Tables.  This is the reason I have not yet posted the design for general
    criticism/comment/ridicule.  The rules for setting up hit locations for surface and
    internal hits don\'t work very well on really big ships.  Has anyone come up with
    guidelines for larger ships.  
5.  Speed.  This is a 4G design, but is limited to 6 hours at full speed (24 G hours,
    48 G turns).  Too slow?  Insufficient fuel?  Space was a finite resource.

Any suggestions would be welcomed.  Hopefully, I can get the damage tables
done this weekend and post on next Monday.

Way to weak.  Needs to be about 2000 if I remember correctly (all our
big ship duels have been with BR, and it isn\'t at the office right now
:)  I guess on a CA it could be less, but I\'d think it\'d need to be at
least 1500.

It needs a screen big enough to stop 1500-2000, I\'d say (I\'ll check
tonight and get back to you.

Armor values would be high, but only for stopping PAs---- the bay sized
lasers possible in the FFS rules are nuts.  A 140 ton laser bay would
use a fraction of the power, and be able to waste any gigantic meson gun
armed ship before it ever got close enought to shoot.  I used the
suggestion that lasers should be limited to a DE=TL*50, so the max DE at
TL-15 is 750MJ.  I think that most capitol ships in BR have armor values
around the same as the DV for the meson guns (15+).

I sure haven\'t.  What a mess, huh?  I would just eyeball it.  I usually
have an idea what the ship I\'m designing looks like, so I was thinking
of just making a picture, and putting stuff where I thought it should go
(drawing the damage areas on the picture).

I standarized on building my ships with 50 g-turns on the first design
round.  Any remaining volume is used for fuel after I\'ve don all the
other work.  Fuel is a *big* issue now (vs high guard).  Also, HG ships
have *much* more stuff on them.  (as an aside, I figured out that the
Tigress only has the surface area for 1 turret for every 300 tons... so
HG over estimates the number of weapons, maybe some of this volume could
be replaced by fuel now (it won\'t be enough).

Just as a general comment, I\'ve decided that with my Zho designs, I\'m
going to standardize a bunch of the equipment.  I\'ve made all Zho
"regular" sized turrets 4 tons (3 wasn\'t enough at TL-14, and why would
they standardize on an inefficient size?).  I decided that larger ships
would sport 700MJ lasers in place of bay mounted energy weapons (bay
PAWS, and MGs in FFS are useless.  

******ALSO******

The crew rules are junk!  If you use them, your ship will waste the now
precious volume on crew, and quarters for them (not to mention
wkstations, etc..  The worst offender is the engineering crew.  The midu
agashaam has 4-5 time the crew if done in FFS vs HG.  The 150 Zho scout
in BL has *11* crew.  It\'d have 1-4 in HG (but could run with 1).  I
decided to divided the maintenance points by 4, and I use the volume of
the powerplant, not its output in the equation.  Even doing this my
crews are larger (eng crew is 1 per 100 tons of drive in HG) than HG.

I was planning on doing a really big Zho ship soon (since there don\'t
seem to be any that I can find.  Let me know what your thoughts are,
since there\'s no reason for us both to pull our hair out on the same
problems.

you can machine tungsten, soft steel is trivial.

In FFS weapon design section there is no information about the materials
used in weapons.  However, modern barrels and receivers can be made of
various different materials to produce lighter and more compact weapons.
 Alternative materials can be used in CPR and ETC small arms, but they
should not be used in other weapon systems.

I assume that all weapon design tables in FFS are calculated by using
Hard Steel as weapon building material.  The following table shows the
weight and price modifiers for various materials that can be used in
barrels and receivers (and tech level of introduction/tech level of
improvement).  For price mod, the number to the left is the price at TL
of INTRODUCTION, and the number on the right is the price at TL of
IMPROVEMENT on.
_______________________________________________________
 Material Type   TL      Weight  Price

 Iron            3/4     1.33    1.06/0.8   Probably used in black-powder
                                                      weapons
 Soft Steel      4/5     1.18    0.944/0.8
 Hard Steel      5/6     1.00    1.0/1.0    The most common weapon
                                                        material
 Light Alloy     6/10    0.88    2.35/2.0   Common receiver material
 Titanium Alloy  6/10    0.67    5.0/3.33   Used in rifle barrels
 Light Composite 7/8     0.44    3.5/1.75
 Comp. Laminate  8/10    0.33    4.0/1.33
 Crystaliron     10/12   0.31    4.5/1.125
 Superdense      12/14   0.27    7.0/1.0
____________________________________________________

The weight modifier is derived from FFS page 38 \'Vehicle and Craft
Construction Materials\' table by calculating how much material is needed
to get the same Toughness as Hard Steel has.  The price modifier is
taken directly from FFS table, and, at TL of Introduction it is not
multiplied by weight modifier to show that it is difficult and expensive
to machine tougher materials.  At TL of Improvement, it is multiplied by
the weight modifier to show that machining technology has improved
enough in the meantime that it is no longer especially difficult to
machine this material.

Note:    currently there are many weapons with Hard Steel barrels and
Light Alloy receivers, and some companies are manufacturing titanium
barrels for rifles.

  I dunno....  On the Canadian C-7 (A Canuck variant of the M16A1A), we\'ve
just put a brass deflector ( a little protrusion just aft of the ejector
port) which throws the brass out at 90 degrees to the barrel.  Lefties
shoot \'em all the time and don\'t get brass in the nose.

        Based on TCS funding levels, whaddya mean "budget"?  You can easily
build a dozen guns (how about 1 per hour of rotation?  Plus 2 polar sites;
26 DMG\'s for Earth, for example) with the GNP of the USA.  Let alone the
REST of the planet.  Beef that up with laser satilites (solar panels,
batteries, small fusion reactor, and 5pts at 80 hexes...), say about 100
for Earth and surface missle silos (use my x-series missles; 2-stage: 20g
turns with 20gs an 80g turns with 10g\'s, 500MT charge for the DET laser... 
no, they aren\'t small, but they are planet launched).
        With a couple of scaled down installations near each of the Gas
Giants (you would need two or three per GG to prevent the battle station
being over the firing horizon from the intruders) you could mke life *very*
uncomforatble for an invader.
        Then, of course, you have your SDB\'s and raiders for harrasment
duty against the opposing fleet\'s escorts.  Take them out, one at a time,
and eventually the intruder will either have to commit his capital ships to
hunting them down, or to try and attack the bases.  Which is what you
want...  simply because you can build bigger guns than he can shields.
        Eventually you get re-enforced, or he gets fustrated enough that he
either leaves to cut his losses or he starts throwing rocks at you to try
and overwhelm your DefSat grid.  The first two result in a victory for you,
most likely, and the third has got 50-50 odds of going either way.  If he
ever hits you with a rock (which odds dicate he will, eventually), you
loose, but its 20 years before he can inhabit the planet (assuming he was
throwing big rocks).
        Let\'s face it, if you have a planet of 4 billion people, and the
"Free-Hold" tax (levied against the anual incoming of the person, to ensure
that the proud Star System of <insert name here> never falls to the
oppresionist yoke of <insert another name here>) is 100Cr per annum, that
is a budget of 400 Billion credits to build your system defense network. 
Given two or three years head start, the system I describe is very
feasible.  Which is why planetary invasions are extremely messy for the
invader, unless the invader doesn\'t care if he actually can use the planet
afterward.

On Wed 23 Nov 94, Lewis Roberts talked about Deep Meson Sites,

I know that this is a TNE board, but Im on the other side of the world 
from my copy of TNE let alone a copy of FF&S or MT etc so bear with me.

In Striker (I) they suggested that this {\'destroying the surface sensors\'} 
was the only way to get rid of them.  Another I thought of was using a 
densitometer with sufficient depth penetration.  I cannot remember what 
the highest pen is in MT, or if they still exist in TNE...others may be 
able to confirm or deny this.

Anyway, just look for anomalous readings on your sensors...
Also what other particles are created from a meson reaction.  If there 
are neutrinos then use your local highly calibrated neutrino sensor.  I 
know this means that you have to wait for the gun to fire, but... you 
have to expect some losses!!!

I had great fun raining death over Cheymaks from afar with a GL a 
couple of years ago. Indirect fire is one to really make the GM 
sweat, especially if you can get a neural activity sensor to aim with 
;-) Eh, roger ;-)

Another advantage of a GL over an FGMP is flexibility - did you ever 
hear of an FGMP firing flechete/gas/baton round/phosphorous/smoke? A 
GL can do a bit more than go bang!

And you don\'t *have* to have Battledress to fire most of them (I mean 
PGMP\'s etc), and they\'re lower tech: at TL15 the guidance on the 
grenades would probably be pretty awesome?

the charges in the archives somewhere. I\'ll see if I can dig them

I will admit that the change in the physical constants governing
Gravitics are due to a sentient agency.  It is also a limited area
of effect -- say 1000-2000 parsecs.  Beyond there, the old
rules of the Universe apply.  This did bad things to communications
with the Zho Core Expedition, BTW... and there\'s a transition 
zone, where NO gravitics, old or new, work reliably.

As I postulated, the laws of Jumpspace did not change, it was
just that a lesser-known aspect of jump physics suddenly 
manifested itself... and that Imperial jump theory was slightly
flawed in the first place.

Yes, my mind is growing weak as I approach my late 20s.
I meant the Serendip Belt.

I have but one great question about all that, btw.  Was the Belt
a player-run world, and if so who was the lucky psycho ;-)

  I\'ve been doing some thinking (it\'s tough to get the smell of the
  smoke out of my hair!) and came to the conclusion that there were 
  a number of races that have appeared in SF of varying levels of 
  plausibility that would make for potentially interesting 
  Traveller (any era).  I\'ve been thinking also about "translating" 
  some of these races into Traveller terms, and generating 
  "Contact-cum-Alien-Module" articles on them, or RICE Papers on 
  them and their planets.  How would this be received on the list?  
  Can I get into trouble, either from GDW or the Authors (or their 
  estates) for doing it?  Should I go ahead and do it?  What races 
  would people like to see? (No guarantees.  I\'m not going to try 
  to convert a race that I\'m not comfortably familiar with, or that 
  I haven\'t read.)

  My list so far:

        Fuzzy Sapiens, from H. Beam Piper\'s Fuzzy books, and the 
                       "add-on/alternate" Fuzzy stories by William 
                       Tuning and Ardath Mayhar.

        Sime and Gen,  from the series by Jacqueline Lichtenberg 
                       and Jean Lorrah.

  I\'ll be doing some spatial and temporal displacement to make them 
  fit into Traveller a little better, but I\'ll be keeping as much 
  of the physiology and cultural background as I can - obviously, 
  there\'s likely to be a strong need to "evolve" the cultures and 
  modify the history slightly, but what results should certainly be 
  recognizable...

(Gee, I knew I shouldn\'t have rushed that bit off....)  I sit corrected.
Magyar was just the worst of the lot that I noticed.  I agree about the
screwy X-boat routes, though.  I seem to recall that a lot of them just
didn\'t seem to make an awful lot of sense.  Luckily, Domain of Deneb,
and the Solomani Rim seemed to work pretty well, since most of us stayed  
in those regions anyway....  At this point, the question is nearly moot. :(

Figure under 10 trillion for Solomani/Vilani population in -2422.  In
1110 we have the entire Imperium at nearly 16 trillion, with the densely
settled Solomani maybe 21 to 22 trillion or so, and I think the Zhodani 
are fairly sparse, maybe bringing the total to 25+ trillion, but surely
less than 30 trillion.  (I\'d have to look at Zho world generation to
make a better guess; DGP claimed about 2x density for Solomani cultural
regions, with average non-Solomani density at about 1.6 billion per 
system, if everyone is spread evenly.  I haven\'t checked this.)

    'body' => 'Traveller: The New Era Rules \'o\' Life

History of the Traveller and The Traveller Universe:
	Traveller is a space based science fiction role playing game
created back in 1978 by Games Designer Workshop (aka GDW).  Traveller is
one of the first  RPG out on the market, and may be the first sci-fi
based one.  The original rules were a 5"x8" boxed set with 12 additional
supplements.  These rules are known now as "Classic Traveller". 
	Classic Traveller is based in a setting called the Imperium.  The
Imperium was a huge galactic empire covering over 11000 worlds and 700
parsecs.  The major power in the Imperium was the Emperor, with
Archdukes controlling different areas for him.   The Imperium was
divided into sectors (twenty of them), each of them about 32 parsecs by
40 parsecs in size.  Each sector is divided in 16 sub-sectors (8 x 10
parsecs). Since the Imperium is so huge, most planets were govern in a
feudal based system of government.
	The next edition of Traveller was called MegaTraveller (released
in 1987).  MegaTraveller was based in the same universe but during a
galactic civil war.  During the civil wars, billions died across the
Imperium.  The civil wars ended when one of the warring faction created 
and released a super weapon known as the Virus.  The Virus is a computer
virus that can inhabit a computer and makes it a living thinking
machine.  The behavior of these machines ranges from suicidal to
murderous. The virus was too effective and killed trillions across the
galaxy.
	Traveller: The New Era is based in the Traveller universe 70+
years after the release of the virus.  The Imperium is gone, and man is
trying to re-build his future in the stars.  Traveller: The New Era uses
the GDW House System, and uses a cascade skill system.

Tech Levels of Traveller: The New Era & the campaign:
	If you want to visualize the tech level used in Traveller.  Think
somewhere in between the Aliens universe and the Star Wars Universe.  In
the Traveller Universe there are the following limitation on technology
.
		
1. There is Faster than Light travel (FTL) in Traveller, but
nothing like Hyperspace is the Star Wars Universe or Warp Drive in Star 
Trek.  Traveller uses what are called Jump Ships. Jump Ship have the 
ability to enter JumpSpace (duh!!!).  How far a ship can traveller in 
JumpSpace matters on the Jump Rating of the ship. For example, if a ship 
has a Jump rating of 2, it can stay in JumpSpace for 2 parsecs.  A jump, 
no matter what the jump rating of the ship is, takes from 6-8days, 
depending how good your navigator and pilot are.

2. There is no FTL communications. 

3. Energy weapons exist, but they need battery back pack or belt packs. 


"Space is a Cold, Hard Mistress" Unknown Scout

The Rules

1. All characters must have good concepts and must make sense.  Please
avoid silly/stupid characters.  Also make you characters as real as
possible, not just walking, talking killing machines.

2. Please no "Rules Lawyers". 

3. All characters must be human or schalli (for now).

4. The game will start in the Old Expanses as part of the Reformation
Coalition.

5. Psionics are allowed.  GM warning, the process to get psionics is a
hard and possibly deadly procedure. 

6. Rules for cybernetics will be included in the Traveller Supplement
Fusion, Fire & Steel, but should be rare.

2.  To Mark Fletcher:  Planetfall was a TNE combat system published in
Challenge 75.  It makes one-on-one combat simpler to allow gaming
small unit (platoon-level) actions without getting too abstracted and
using most of the normal TNE combat rules.  Sort of an intermediate
step between TNE combat and Striker II.  I think MegaTraveller had
something similar in the Referee\'s Companion, but memory fails me

3.  To the TML Admin Gods:  My version of TML 119 ends abruptly in
the middile of item 7 or 8.  Is my mail server being naughty, or is there
a problem with MPGN?  I hope the recent convern over post 
lengths does not mean posts will be cut off midstream.

4.  To those seeking Classic Traveller stuff:  Most of you are likely
aware of this, but you should not forget to check used book
stores.  I have gotten a veritable wealth of old stuff at some of
the local shops, including nearly all issues of JTAS and one copy
of Azhanti High Lightning for $15.00 (counters unpunched, but
missing the Supplement 5 book).  Even if you already have
everything, its sometimes nice to have spares.

That digest was 41K in size.  You are the second or third person to complain
about the problem.  You didn\'t miss much in that digest, somehow a bounced

What do you (the list) think?  Should I go ahead and reduce the digest size
down to 800 lines?  That will get it real close to 32K.

Thanks, Ken. Actually, I thought we got along very well. We didn\'t like
each other and we wanted the same bit of real estate, but we understood
one another perfectly ;-). I enjoyed writing propaganda against you.

Steve will tell you that I nearly blew a gasket when I heard about how
my successor screwed things up. Mind you, from what I\'ve heard since
about the Alliance and their research programs I think I would eventually
have come a cropper myself. But I wouldn\'t have dragged a couple of
billion people in with me!

Howdy,

Here is the slightly cleaned up version of the new rules and additions I\'ve done
for BL.  The guys I play with at the office, Lane Mogford, and Tom Kelly helped
a lot in playing, and play testing various rules changes.  Lane runs a CT 
campaign using the TNE stuff (mixed with CT stuff as needed).

Let me know what you think, I want to make these as bulletproof as possible.


Rules Changes for Brilliant Lances
**********************************

The Brilliant Lances rules work pretty well, but we have found a number of 
problems, and these are some of our attempts to correct them. The two major 
flaws are built around the general capabilities of the sensors, and the 
arbitrary nature of having tasks happen throughout the turn, but ranges and 
facings being sampled only at the endpoint of a ship\'s movement.  We now use 
simultaneous BR/Mayday movement all the time. 

The first problem to be addressed will be what I call Bogey Detection (BD).  
The BL rules state that "the crew may well be aware that \'something is out 
there\' based on ghost images, etc.".  This is interesting, but it begs the 
question "When does my crew get the idea \'something is out there\' in the
first place?".

For the purposes of playing BL (or using it in your role playing campaign) 
getting that first clue something is out there is a major point of tension. A 
ship\'s sensors are the players\' window to their universe, so the sensor rules
need to be complete, and consistent.

One more digression before the substance of the post:  if you haven\'t read the 
box copy on the back of BL, do so.  If you have, read it again.  The feel of 
that copy is what I am after in these rules additions.  If you don\'t mind the

"Damn the passive sensors, light \'em up with the AEMS!" reality of the BL rules,
trash this post... I really want the use of active sensors to be a sober choice,
with both pros and cons (it\'s all pro now).  The point of this was to get that 
submarine feel back into passive sensing.  The Surprise rules I\'ve added give
the sensor rules teeth, and make the whole thing work.  On to the meat...


Bogey Detection:
================
 
I will use the word Bogey in the same way that it is used in the BL rules.  A
Bogey is an indication of something odd, or even the presence of a ship, but 
there is not enough data for a firing solution.  Before a Bogey is detected the 
space around the ship in question looks empty.  These rules imply either some
degree of blind play with a ref, or trusting players.  We\'ve used a system where
we abstract the closing moves out in the 80+ hex range and roll for the bogey
detections (easy to do since the range bands are *very* wide in the X times 
extreme range zone).

These rules can also be used simply to create plausible scenarios that don\'t
leave the players questions of "How\'d he get so close without us seeing
him?", etc.unanswered. 

Sensor arrays are programmed to alert the operator when they find a region of
space that looks suspicious (ie. it could possibly be a target) under a set of 
predetermined conditions (what these conditions are is left to the players, and 
is a good place for PC sensor skill levels to be introduced).  The alert given 
*is* the Bogey Detection.

The Bogey Detection procedure is basically an extension of the existing rules
for Lock-Ons.  When preforming sensor tasks, each roll will have 2 difficulty
levels, an easier Bogey Detection task, and a harder Lock-On task.  If you make 
the Lock-On roll the Bogey Detection is moot (all Lock-Ons are also BDs... just 
very good ones)

Ranges for Bogey Detection work the same way as for Lock-On:  that is, double
short to get medium, double medium to get long, etc.. The only difference is 
that the maximum range for BD is 8 x Extreme range (64 x Short range).

The medium range for Lock-On is the range of Automatic Bogey Detection--within 
this range (providing there are no positive DiffMods!), if the sensors are 
working, and on, you will know something is in a hex (or, better put, that there
is nothing unnatural in the surrounding hexes). From there, double the range 
like all other ranges, and the Difficulty Level goes up normally for each range 
change(Easy, Ave, Diff, Form, Imp).

As an example, a sensor with a short range (SR) of 8 would look like this:

					RANGE 

		Short	Med.	Long	Extr.	2xExt	4xExt	8xExt	
Hexes:		8	16	32	64	128	256	512	1024	

Lock-on:		Ave	Diff	Form	Imp

Bogey:		Auto	Auto	Easy	Ave	Diff	Form	Imp  Prolonged
Rng(Mkm):	0.24 	0.48	0.96	1.92	3.84	7.68	15.36	


The body of the table is the base Difficulty Level for the given range for 
Lock-On and BD tasks.  

Note that this allows ships to maintain reasonable pickets so that they have a 
reason to go out and investigate/fight. Without this information, it is hard to 
rationalize any combat at all given the vastness of the areas to be patrolled
relative to the maximum Lock-On radius(draw a circle of maximum possible Lock-On
distance radius and compare it to the size of a star system :)

Also note that the BD task difficulty could be pushed to the left on the
chart, making auto BD only at the SR of the detector.


Procedure: 
During the Sensor phase of the turn, roll one D20 for each sensor used.  The 
same roll will be used for both Bogey Detection and Lock-On.  If the Lock-On is 
successful, Bogey Detection is assumed (and moot).  If the Lock-On task fails, 
the roll may still be good enough for a successful BD.  If Lock-On is not 
possible for the range in question, only Bogey Detection is possible.

DiffMods are allowed to push a Difficulty Level above Automatic (allowing, for 
example, terrain to protect a ship from Automatic detection).

All DiffLevel modifiers except Evasion apply to both bogey detection as well as 
Lock-On, Evasion has no effect on a Bogey Detection attempt (as it works by 
making the future position uncertain, not by hiding the target).

Note that Diff Mods for Lock-On apply to Bogey Detection, but not the other way 
around.  For example: a previous Lock-On gives a -1 DiffMod to both BD, and 
Lock-On attempts, but a previous BD gives a -1 DiffMod only to a BD task, not a 
Lock-On task.  This is also true of hand offs.

BDs can be lost just like Locks...  "Sir!  I saw something, but it just 
disappeared!"

You needn\'t have a BD first to achieve a Lock.

----
New Lock-On DMs

For Passive sensors, or DFs:
If the target goes active give a -4 DiffMod to the sensing ship if it\'s within 
twice the extreme range.  Lock-Ons can be made out to 2 x extreme range *only* 
if the target has had no BDs yet (this is Surprise, see below).  The task for

Locking at this range is IMP +2, and must be reduced by DMs to at least IMP to 
be attempted.  All of these ranges are using the ACTIVE sensors range bands (see
sensor rules changes below).
----

DiffMods for Bogey Detection Only:

For BD, if the target is within 8 times the extreme range of the *active* 
sensor, and goes active, it is automatically  marked as a Bogey to all ships 
with passive sensors within this range (see below for additions).  This auto BD
only applies to the turn the active is on.  Tech level differences between the 
sensors give DMs----use the DMs for TL vs Jammers (see senor rules below for 
clarification).

Weapons fire at the sensing ship during the previous turn by the target is a -1 
DiffMod for BD by passive sensors or DFs.

Lock-On hand offs, etc. all work normally. Bogey detections may be passed off
(to other sensors, or ships) just like Lock-Ons, but the DiffMods only apply to 
other Bogey Detection attempts.

Prolonged observation allows a ship to get a Bogey Detection at very distant 
points, but requires hours of observation to have an Impossible chance of a 
detection.  (I still need to finish these rules)


Results of Bogey Detection:

Success: 
 Success indicates the presence of something out of the ordinary in a given hex.
A Bogey counter is placed in the hex.  In some scenarios, false Bogeys may be
allowed (a Lock-On will determine them to be natural material or some form of
countermeasures).

Outstanding Success: 
An Outstanding Success on a Bogey detection roll allows the sensing ship to ask 
what the size class of the target is +-1 size class (Note that until this 
happens, or a Lock-On is made, the size of the target remains unknown).

Note:  A successful (or outstanding) Evasion attempt allows the target to apply 
what would have been its DiffMod due to evasion to the size class uncertainty

(eg; a target that has outstanding success and applied 4 g-turns, but was still 
Outstandingly detected as a Bogey would be able to exaggerate its size by ±3 
sizes (+1 is normal, +2 for evasion). Note that while evasion doesn\'t help to
defeat Bogey Detection, it can make the target\'s size hard to nail down.


Sensors:
========

I have a few changes.

1.  I assume that a folding array PEMS has as many fixed elements as it can, 
therefore a ship that can support a Short Range (SR) 3 PEMS fixed array, but 
actually mounts a SR 6 PEMS could operate the 6 hex PEMS with a SR=3 even when 
the array was folded.

2.  Any active sensor may be used at a lower power to produce a lower SR. Thus,
a 16 hex AEMS could operate at SR=1 if it wished.  Also, a ship may decide to
limit sensor sweeps to 60 degree arcs if it wishes (add sensor chits to the 
heading chart, and put them in the arcs to be scanned if limited areas are to be
searched).

3.  Passive sensors receiving active signals:  a passive sensor differs from an 
active only in that it cannot broadcast.  The signal received by such a passive 
sensor when its source is active is actually stronger than the signal received 
by the active sensors\' own antennas (the path length is half, and it isn\'t 
scattered by the target (it *is* the target :-).  

As a result, when a target goes active the passive ships get an auto BD, and get
to roll their Lock-On attempts using the range breaks for the active sensor they
are detecting (and if the active ship is unaware of them, they may do this out 
to extreme x 2).

Use the same DMs for TL difference as are used for jamming tasks in addition to 
any others.  Also, PEMS sensors can detect radar and AEMS, but not ladar. HRTs 
don\'t pick up AEMS sensors using these rules.

Surprise:
=========

When a target is locked, and it has no idea that the enemy is around (or doesn\'t
care), it may be fired on with a modified range table.  The range DMs for firing
in BL assume that the target is trying to avoid getting hit (Challenge71). It 
does this by expending a fractional amount of g-turns every turn it is in combat
(combat being as soon as they get a BD).  While these are small amounts of fuel,
they would become significant over the course of a patrol (they\'re 1/10 g-turn 
of fuel per turn).  Some ships might choose to "waste" this fuel before they get
a BD in which case they may not be victims of these surprise rules even if 
unaware of their hunters.  If it is not avoiding, there is little uncertainty in
its future position.  As a result, do not use the given range table.  I have 2 
modifications, use one.  1) ignore range DMs altogether, or 2) add a DM of +1
for every 10 hexes.  Any ship out of fuel, or with no maneuver drive functional 
may be fired on this way at any time (optionally, a ship might decide to 
conserve the 1/10 g-turn, and be a sitting duck).

Ships may be fired on past 44 hexes (indeed, they may be fired on out to 128 
hexes).  You may have to calculate a DV/Pen for a weapon beyond its extreme 
range.

Comments:

Patrol ships *listen*, they quietly peer into the darkness.   They wish they 
could just crank up the 480,000km AEMS array, but going active in an unknown 
area invites death--the first indication of an enemy might actually be the 
brilliant lances out of the black that kill you.  The game of cat and mouse
is 
afoot!

(pardon my ad copy writing style, but I couldn\'t resist :)

FIMissiles (anti radiation) will get kinda nasty, as well :)

On to the facing rules:

Facing:
=======

The facing rules allow for some odd problems. For example, a ship with a spinal 
mount could be drifting on a parallel course to a target, free to choose its 
facing for the whole turn, and still not be able to point at the target! The 
rules must be modified to change this.

The basic rules for determining facing are unchanged. Within these, however a
new type of Facing activity needs to be defined, it is called Tracking.


Tracking:
=========

A ship may allocate g-turns to point at a target, this is called Tracking the
target. It is useful for spinal mounts, or any other weapons with limited arcs 
of fire, as well as for pointing hot engines away from an enemy sensor array.

Procedure:
1. Use the rules for determining base facing to arrive at the base facing.

2. Allocate g-turns to Tracking. Select firing arc that will Track target (1, 2,
3, 4, 5).

3. Resolve Evasion tasks, if a random facing is the result, no tracking is 
possible and any g-turns expended on tracking  are lost----if an Outstanding 
success is the result, or no Evasion was attempted, go on to step 4.

4. Roll for Tracking as a Formidable task before the Sensor Lock Phase of the
turn (a Lock-On on the previous turn is required), -1 DiffMod for each g-turn
expended on Tracking. +X DiffMods for evasion (number depending on success 
level (this isn\'t all that clear.. this is for the *target\'s* evasion).

Effects of a successful Tracking task:
A ship which succeeds in Tracking a target may treat the target as if it were in
the selected arc of fire for the entire turn as long as the target stays within 
the Tracking Arc for the entire turn. An outstanding success allows +1 Arc of
fire to be added to the Tracking Arc.

The Tracking Arc of the weapon is its basic arc of fire, +1 Arc of fire for each
g-turn spent on Tracking.

For example: a ship has a facing of 6, and is Tracking with its Spinal Mount.

This ship, having spent 2 g-turns on Tracking  requires a Average Task roll to
succeed. It does succeed, and may therefore track a target that remains in arcs 
1 through 3 (the Tracking Arc) during the turn.


Effects of Facing on Sensors:
The -3 DiffMod for being in the stern arc of a target that is using g-turns 
still applies, but the sensing ship must only cross the stern arc at some point 
during the turn (the segmented movement system for missile interception may have
to be used in this case). If the sensing ship is in the stern arc for the entire
turn, it receives a -4 DiffMod.

Optional: Some ships may be listed as having a different size class when looked 
at from different angles----if so, the DiffMods will be listed in terms of the
arc in question (usually bow-on, and stern-on).
	
Eg: A Destroyer is a Needle AF, and is 1000Tons. It would be called size class 
M----but for this particular ship, it is treated as size S when viewed Bow or 
Stern On. It would be listed: Bow/Stern-On +1 DiffMod .

Effects of Facing on Combat:
Facing effects combat in much the same way it does sensors. A ship may fire at 
another with no penalty as long as the target remains within the arc of the 
weapon for the entire turn.

If the target is only in the weapon\'s arc for a fraction of the turn, it may 
still fire, but at +1 DiffMod.


Range:
======
The question of range is perhaps the most challenging.  If two ships are 
closing, there is a point at which the initial and final ranges can be very 
similar, but the ships may have passed through the same hex at some point in
the turn.

There are a few ways out of this. One is to use the Proportional Movement Guide 
at all times, and allow fire at each segment (in which case all the to-hit 
probabilities need to be changed since they assume 10 shots fired per turn). 
Another is to take the average distance between the 2 ships----this has some 
promise.  We have decided that because the rules were written to sample range
data once per turn, and so were the facing, and firing rules, we would allow the
turns best range to be used (except for missiles, which might not get a chance 
at a better range after they blow up). At most times (notably with military 
ships with MFDs) this will make little or no difference, as range bands for 
weapons/sensors are quite coarse.

Note that the first hex moved into during a turn is the first position of the
object for that turn.


Misc:

We use a 60x80 hex playing area, and it still isn\'t always big enough.  I you
decide to use a smaller board, you can always use the sensor rule additions as a
guide for setting up the scenario that starts at a closer range.

Hans speaks for me as well.  My TCS persona was Gabrielle Butler, the 
  first and apparently most moderate representative for the Belt.  While
  what the last player did isn\'t entirely out-of-character for the Belt
  (given what they did when they first got Jump drive from a misjumped
  Imperial:  try to take over the rest of the Islands), it still made
  me wince.  What possible motive could they have had for genocide of
  the Orpheides? 

I guess living in asteroid habitats all the time makes one a little 
  \'funny\'...

If I may reply to this;  The World Generator program (and Much much more) 
that Rob Prior is writing is for the MAC.  As Rob stated before, He won\'t 
make the program available in public until he gets a reply from GDW.

Yeah.  It will only increase the pleasure of GM/Playing Traveller.  
Hopefully, GDW will recognize the creative programmers in the Traveller 
community.

As a matter of fact, I have the Alliance sending research teams into the
remains of the Belt\'s government centers in 5650, trying to figure out why
they went nuts all of a sudden.

Also, it\'s not entirely true that _all_ the people from the Belt were killed.
1% of the populace survived the Alliance counterattack, and more would have
died latter, but at least some people would have survived. There would also
be a small number of old warships that have escaped destruction lying low in
the Serendip Belt system. I can\'t really say more than that on the status of
the Belt survivors, because I haven\'t written it yet!

Megatraveller to New Era - i.e., figure out what\'s happened in the

Hard Times procedures, so I\'m at 1129 or so.  Has anyone developed tables 
or even some general ideas as to how to handle the changes after that point?

I\'ve come up with some preliminary guidelines of my own - I\'d 
appreciate comments.


Phase A: The Virus 

1) Doomed worlds are just that - Doomed.  I figure they become the 
"boneyards" of the new era.

2) Failing worlds with inhospitable environments get pushed over the edge 
by the Virus - population and tech level drops a lot.

3) Failing worlds in hospitable environments suffer some loss of tech 
level and population, but not much.

4) Worlds not in the above catagories suffer a loss of tech level but not 
of population, unless they have inhospitable environments that the 
reduced tech level can\'t cope with.

5) Starports are reduced, especially ones with an orbital component.

6) Decrease in technology level has some sort of floor - the Virus has 
little impact on worlds with tech levels below a certain point, say 6 or 
7, unless those worlds are non-industrial (they suffer from lack of 
interstellar trade).

7) There is some chance that a world is run by a virus (or viruses), 
though I\'m not sure what criteria to use here.


Phase B: Recovery

1) High population worlds recover best, due to their larger market.  
Technology recovers, limited by pre-war tech level.  They also rebuild 
starports.

2) Moderate population worlds increase pop if in hospitable environment, 
maintain or decline if it\'s inhospitable.

3) Small populations have a random chance of increasing or decreasing if 
in a hospitable environment.  They decrease if in an inhospitable 
environment.

If I understand most of the queries it seems that there is 
interest in Macintosh Traveller software.

I have nothing against the Traveller Tools Group but if doesn\'t
seem like a good choice for Mac software.  As I recall it uses
Visual C++ (which doesn\'t exist on Mac yet, maybe next year...) 
I\'ve thought that a compiled cross-platform traveller code library
would be useful. Alternatively, source for ANSI C (no User Interface)
routines would also be acceptable.

Traveller gamers - programing beginners interested in writing
gaming utilities might want to check out VIP-C, Prograph, or
AppMaker all of which speed UI development with the Mac toolbox.
They are all a bit expensive to justify for a hobby, but if anyone 
has access through work or school give them a try. I\'m sure
FutureBasic and Hypercard are more reasonably priced.

I have switched to writing all my campaign materials using Setext
hypertext and use EasyView to link it all together. Once I have 
all my materials linked, I will work on software gaming aids.

I have used a demo for RPGTools, a shareware RPG database for
rules and background which uses plug-ins to support different
gaming systems. (It doesn\'t currently support TNE rules.)

To experience what a well supported computerized RPG can be
like, check out REALMZ by Tim Phillips (AD&D based) . I tried it
and immediately mailed my shareware payment. Best entertainment
value I\'ve found.

I disagree with the idea of directly translating gaming rules
to code. I think that is greatly underutilizing the power of a 
computer in gaming. I would prefer to do a computerized SFRPG
in the spirit of Traveller. Things I would like to see are 3-D
universes, 3-D space combat, and a nearly infinite amount of
variation in world generation.

It does seem a shame that the other games systems are having 
all the fun. I hope GDW authorizes shareware gaming distribution.
Commercial operatives may not see a big enough target market.

Oh well, enough of my babbling...

Now that Im all done for the quarter I can finish this post in good

Played Battle Rider for the first time this past Saturday, pretty cool.
I can see how it could be very addicting.  The vector based movement really
forces a board wargamer like me to think differently.  The game can also 
be pretty violent as well, I was suprised...33% ships KO\'d after turn two 
and 66% KO\'d after turn three, of course they were 1000-2000 ton size.  
The two remaining were Starburst CLs on opposite sides.  The game rightly 
favors large ships.  It seemed that It would prove difficult for the two 
to hurt each other except with outstanding success.  However the 
starbursts mauled the opfor\'s small boys, in two cases getting kills with 
one blast from that meson gun.  I now see why everyone was so incredulous 
when someone reported a while back that even 7 Auroras managed to get an 
Azhanti High Lightning.  All in all a pretty cool game...hope it catches 
on in the general gaming public, could be a classic IMHO.

Warning slightly silly materiel to follow.
Before actually playing Battle Rider, Lewis Roberts and I converted some 
of the less glamorous BL ships to BR, they would maybe be useful as 
victims or as a convoy to be escorted, who knows?

A while back someone brought up the subject of small arms laser 
penetration.  The idea was that if laser were allowd to have IPR of less 
than 1 then it should be possible to have a small arms laser that 
penetrated personal rigid armor.  
Taking this to mind I built a laser with a 5 kg HPG and 10kg battery 
where each shot is 0.04 MJ, this had a DV of 10 and PR 6(1/.16) such that 
it loses 6D6 for each AV1 penetrated.  Such a laser would be very effective 
against someone in light rigid personal say AV 1 but would not 
affect someone in AV 2.  As this is about as heavy a personal weapon 
should be, this seems reasonable.  
I dont think that a small arms laser should be able to punch through 
battle dress at any TL but light rigid armor is another thing.  
The gist of all this is that maybe small arms lasers can be assigned  
Some minimum penetration rating (say 3) that reflects the point beyond 
which the laser is most effecient at "holing" the armor.  This could 
reflect the plasma formed at the beam/armor interface dissipating the 
beam energy.  Since in reality this is a nonlinear effect...you would get 
to a point where this plasma would suck up most of the extra energy you 
tried to put in one place.  This is related to intensity so once you get 
to a certain intensity you no longer increase PR.  I think PR 3-4 or even 
5 is a good place to start.


The same thing with Plasma and Fusion weapons.  It seems you could 
increase the PR without increasing DV just with a tighter focus on the 
stream.  If you were to do this, this should not apply to the PV to be 
used against vehicles not if you like balance.  Then maybe it should :-]


Well that\'s enough on this subject.  

MUSINGS ON ORBITAL BOMBARDMENT

A couple of quick formulas for reference.

KE =1/2 M*V^2
PE = M*g*r

>From FF&S
PV for KE penetrators with greater 12 MJ

FROM Fundementals of Astrophysics (Hsu)
If I remember correctly...I will verify and repost tomorrow.
Crater Diameter proportional to cube-root of impact/explosion energy
Also 1E+17J (equiv to about 20 MT tnt) buried gives crater 
diameter 1000.  I dont think this is right but crater diameter IS 
proportional to cube-root impact energy.  I cant remember the base energy 
that gives a 1000m diameter crater but its in my book at home.

>From Impact and Explosion Cratering
US Geological Survey
Impact cratering is closely modeled by shallow buried explosions of 
equivalent energy.

The gist of all this is......
IF you know the impact energy of your rock/ball/tungsten rod dropped from 
orbit you can figure out the crater diameter.  Figure anything within 
this is pretty much toast and anything out one crater radius again from 
the rim will be badly damaged.  As soon as I dig up the source I can tell 
you how deep (Per MJ) your explosion has to be to correctly model an 
impact of the same energy.  This will tell you the depth of the crater.  
I suppose you can fing PV just using the FF&S equation.

A few things to remember.
For aerodynamic objects dropped onto a planet with standard 
atmosphere...Meaning they are simply released above the planet....
the Kinetic Energy at impact will be 90% or better of its 
Potential Energy at the drop point.

In general PE is 

PE = (G* Mp * Mo)/(Rp+Alt)
Where G is gravitational constant   6.67E-11
Mp is mass of the planet in KG
Mo is the mass of the Object in KG
Rp is the radius of the planet in Meters
Alt is the distance above the planet surface it is dropped from in meters.

Multiply this by 0.9 to account for maneuver and friction and you have 
the impact energy.
If youre trying to penetrate a hardened target just convert this to MJ
(ie divide by 1E+6) and use the KE table in FF&S.  It would probably be 
cheating to use anything more than the AP multiplier(1.7?) as even though 
it is a tungsten rod it is not DS strictly speaking.

If you want general damage just use the stuff below.

Crater Diameter = 1000m *Cube-Root(IE/SE)
Where IE is your impact energy in MJ
SE is the standard energy to get a 1000m diamter crater.
I need to look this up.

Figure anything within the craters toast.
Anything out another crater radius takes 10% of the concussion they 
wouldve if it had been an explosive of the same mass.  You demolition 
stuff from TNE rulebook.
To simplify say, 

>From Impact point
1st Crater Radius-Total Destruction
2nd Crater Radius-Unshielded Personnel Killed/Light Struc Dest/Med Struc Dmg
3rd Crater Radius-Unshielded Personnel Inj/Light Struc Dmg

I dont know play with it


**************************************************************************
Thats enough on this today.
Next time around, I\'ll talk about the use of Non KE weapons in the 
orbital bombardment role as well as finding those standard energies from 
the textbook.  Particularly submunitions/guided missiles/cruise missiles.

Maybe even later delivery methods for these weapons including time delays 
between firing and weapon arrival which can be considerable for dropped 
weapons.  (IE 5 minutes from 500KM)

Ive also developed some weapons that will fit the tube for a standard 
space missile.  One is a missile that carries multiple busses of 10-12 
OBM(Orbital Bombardment Munitions) on each BUS. Say 2 Busses 20 to 24 
projectiles per missile.  These could either be KKV or explosives or 
Submunition dispenser.  This would allow weapon delivery from multiple 
hex range (IE away from close defenses) with great accuracy if you still 
used the missile MFD to guide the thing.

For close orbital bombardment...Ive played with a launcher tube that 
slips in place of a missile.  It has 10-16 tubes within it and a rate of 
fire of 1 per second.  It really just spits them out to drop to the 
planet.  Each is a 16cm OBM.  Given 5 of these in a barbette, this would 
allow even small ships to provide an incredible volume of close support.  
Set up auto loaders from a bay and ships can deliver ridiculous amounts 
of ordanance in support of your force on the surface. 

Also if you want.  Just stand off at 20+ Hexes and fire a missile at a 
target on the planet.  The warhead would be 1000 KG metal plug.  With a 
12G missile impact velocity would be on the order of 192,000 m/s.
This introduces guidance problems I believe.  You might not hit anywhere 
near your target but whatever you hit would be creamed.  Impact energy 
here is about 2E+13 J or about 4000 tons of TNT! 

ACCURACY LIMITATIONS

Somehow the accuracy limitations of your guidance systems must be brought 
into account.  Lets face it, hitting a building from 20 hexes with a 
missile doing 190 km/s would be difficult at best.

Well now Im really finished..so More on this stuff tomorrow.

I will admit that the change in the physical constants governing
Gravitics are due to a sentient agency.  It is also a limited area
of effect -- say 1000-2000 parsecs.  Beyond there, the old
rules of the Universe apply.  This did bad things to communications
with the Zho Core Expedition, BTW... and there\'s a transition 
zone, where NO gravitics, old or new, work reliably.

As I postulated, the laws of Jumpspace did not change, it was
just that a lesser-known aspect of jump physics suddenly 
manifested itself... and that Imperial jump theory was slightly
flawed in the first place.

I\'ve written a small emacs-lisp program to generate ASCII subsector

at the sunbane ftp-server. The program still needs improvement but
maybe it\'s useful for someone out here.  Feel free to copy and change
the program, but I would like to see a copy of the new program.

The maps are looking as following
	    _____
	   /  Co \\       /
	  / 5 @ B \\_____/
	  \\Chaiwa /  Xo \\
	   \\_____/ 0 @ 0 \\
	   /     \\ Sadwe /
	  /       \\_____/

where the letter over the `@\' is the spaceport class, the `o\' means
gas giant available and the left (hex)digit is the population code and
the right digit the techlevel.

For a more complete, but unfinished example check out

	http://www.informatik.uni-kiel.de/~sma/tar/sector.html.
or	http://www.informatik.uni-kiel.de/~sma/tar/rolocan.html.

There you can also find the source file and the sector data listing.
Feel free to send me a note if you\'re interested in the source file
and you haven\'t WWW access.

I think about inserting more html-code, so that every world name is a
hyperlink to another file that contains more information about the
worlds.  I also would like to add code to insert the names of the
neighbor subsectors on every border of the map.  Another cool feature
would be a method to automatically draw allegiance borders, but I\'ve
no idea how to do this.

Actually, traveller-request@MPGN.COM is preferred, mostly because it\'s
a ``standard\'\' for mailing lists.  This way, if we (meaning MPG-Net)
want to add someone else to the alias to monitor the list if Rob is on
vacation (for instance), it could save some time and avoid confusion.

Also, the Listproc document eveyone receives when they subscribe
mentions me (dbj@MPGN.COM) as a contact for general Listproc problems.

Looking out for those Zhodani Hackers....

Hey All

There was an error in my equation for potential energy.  It should read 
as being relative to the surface of the planet. IE

PE = Mo*g*H or generally

PE = Mo*(G*Mp/(Rp+Alt)^2)*Alt

Where Mo is mass of the object in KG
G is grav const 6.67E-11
Mp is the mass of the planet in KG
Rp is the radius of the planet in m
Alt is the height above the planet in m


Sorry about that.  Also I failed to bring the astrophysics book to school 
with me today.  Dont have time today to post much anyway.  See you tomorrow.

   Look on pages 190-191 of the TNE Manual.  The Collapse Effect
Determination procedures are outlined there.

   You\'ll find that it isn\'t necessarily the high population worlds that
survive the best.  Many high population worlds are also high tech worlds,
and the high tech worlds take the brunt of the damage.

   While you\'re destroying interstellar civilization at the local level, you
may also want to take the time to correct anomalous stellar data.  All
class "D" stars which are primaries (particularly with a main world that is
even marginally habitable) should be changed to class "V"; all class "VI"
stars
should be "V" stars; all K5 through M9 class "IV" should be changed to class
"V".  

   Also, check to see if the main world and the star it circles are
compatible.  For example, it is next to impossible to have an "Earth-like"
planet circling around a M6 V star.  Geo Gelinas came up with a table to
convert imcompatible mainworld-star combinations.  All M4 V, M5 V,
M6 V, M7V, M8 V, and M9V stars that have a habitable planet (one with
atmosphere type 4-9 or D-F), should be converted using the table.  Systems
containing a M3 V star should be examined on an individual basis for
conversion (a world circling such a star would be a *very* chilly place
indeed...if you intend the world to be like Star Wars\' iceplanet Hoth
or some cold, barren desert it should work "as is", but if you had something
a
bit "balmier" in mind, change the star).

          DIE         STELLAR
          ROLL     CLASS
            1              K
            2              K
            3              K
            4              G
            5              G
            6              F

   Now that you\'ve fixed the primaries, look at the companions.  All M type
"D" (white dwarf stars) should be changed to "V" (note which were changed).
 Roll a D6.  The result is the number of white dwarfs each subsector should
have on average in the sector (if you are converting only one subsector,
then that is the number of white dwarfs there should be in the subsector).
Check how many white dwarfs were left after you changed all the M type to
"V"s.  If the average number of white dwarfs per subsector remaining
matches the number you rolled, you\'re finished.  If the number remaining is
too low, you\'ll need to reconvert some of those M type "D" stars you
changed to "V"s back into "D"s (white dwarfs) using the following tables:

   Place the new white dwarfs at random within the sector (subsector),
deleting a converted M class "V" companion each time you do. Re-convert
only as many stars as it takes to get the sector (subsector) average up to
the target average you established earlier.  Once all the stars have been
placed, you\'re finished.

   If you found that you still had too many white dwarfs after you converted
all the M class "D"s, convert enough other white dwarfs to M class "V"s
so that you can match your target average.

   Make sure you note all changes in stellar data (for primaries and
companions) on the 1117 or 1129 stats as well.

   The result will be stellar data that not only reflects the Universe

Hey All

Found the correct Standard Impact Energy for cratering.
According to Fundamentals of Astrophysics (Hsu)

A 1 Megaton shallow buried blast will produce a crater about 1000meters 
in diameter.  This is about 4.2E+15 J or about 4.2E+9 MJ

So the diameter of your crater will be

D =  1000m * Cube-Root(IE/SE)
Where IE is the actual impact energy in MJ
SE is the standard energy 4.2E+9 MJ

Projectile impacts are going to through very high velocity debris well 
beyond the circles of general damage I suggested a post or two ago.  
The impact should be assigned a primary and secondary burst radius 
accordingly outside the 2nd circle(Within 2nd circle=certain 
death/critical injury)


Well gotta, hope to post on orbital bombardment with explosives and 
submunitions tomorrow eventually leading to delivery systems.  The point 
of all this is to give rationale for some general standard OB weapons 
I\'ll post next week as well as provide background for other interested 
persons.

As to the material in the New Era manual, I should have said I wasn\'t
really happy with it - that\'s why I wanted to roll my own.  In
particular, the tables given there don\'t seem to take some of the
peculiarities of the Rebellion and Virus into account (i.e. that more
starhips survive in the Wilds than in Safe areas, since transponders are
more likely to be turned off).

I suppose I should have pointed out my underlying assumptions before
listing the changes I\'d make.  Here they are:

1) The impact of the Rebellion, at least as modeled in Hard Times, is
primarily an economic one.  The war destroys starships, starports,
and some biospheres (the last being fairly rare).  As a result, trade is
reduced, the economy falls apart, and the population and government
changes are knock-on effects.

2) Since economics is fundamentally a matter of markets (comsumers to
consume), high population planets have an advantage on three counts.
First, more consumers.  Second, more expertise, reflected in more
surviving technical experts.  Third, low transport costs (in-system is
much cheaper than interstellar).

3) The Virus is the monkey wrench variable.  However, high tech cultures
are more vunerable, due to increased use of computer controls.  The lower
the population, however, the more likely a Virus-caused accident will
kill off a large percentage of the population in one spectacular accident.

4) The best place to be when the virus comes is a place like Earth in the
1960s.  That is, a high pop, tech level 6/7 garden world, where computer
failure, while slightly disruptive, would cause little economic impact.
Higher tech worlds, especially in non-friendly environments, would be
much more vunerable to the Virus due to the widespread use of computer
systems.

Hope this helps explain what I\'m trying to get at - comments welcome.

Yes and no.  (Helpful, huh?)

It depends upon what your ship is intended to do.  This gun isn\'t
even going to warm up the meson screens of a large (or even medium
sized) ship.

But against escort/destroyer sized vessels (say, 400 tons up through
5000 tons maybe (?)), it should do quite well.

Of course, I would just pack the ship with kick-ass lasers, but saying
too much about that will just get me beat about the head and shoulders
with arbitrary 25*TL or 50*TL Laser DE limits...  8^)

So - If the killer laser isn\'t the weapon that has evolved into the
"weapon of the times" at your tech level, the gun you designed is
probably ok in the "pick off the small fry" role.

To attack a capital ship, you probably want a DE of something on the
order of 50,000 Mj (which is probably larger than your whole 2000 dt
ship!)

 > for example from grenades?

 Open armor (ordinary flak vests, helmets, etc) doesn\'t protect
 against concussion. So far, so good.

 Rigid, completely-sealed armor (battle dress and combat armor)
 does -- according to the rules as writtten, concussion doesn\'t
 damage anyone inside a vehicle or behind hard cover (and BD/Cbt
 armor counts as hard cover) There is a problem with this, namely
 when does the force of an explosion overwhelm the protective
 value of the cover (be it concrete wall, tank hull or battle
 dress). We (GDW) have been debating this question off-and-on for
 a while now, and haven\'t come up with a satisfactory answer.
 Joni is only the second person to ask, so it either doesn\'t
 come up in play very often, or referees have no problem
 improvising solutions.

 Note that rigid armor cannot protect its wearer from the
 effects of knockdown.

 The formula mentioned by David Hoey (TRAVELLER Digest 111)
 deals with cases where the explosive charge is in direct contact
 with an object (where you want to use an explosive charge to
 breach a wall, for example).

 Already thought of it, Hugh. Check out page 60 of the RC
 Equipment guide, where it says (and I quote): "The rifle\'s
 features are either duplicated on both sides of the rifle for
 use by both right- and left-handed soldiers, or can be switched
 to whichever side the individual chooses by the unit
 armorer...the ejection port and bayonet lug are examples of the
 latter."
 FWIW, even a rightie firing a conventional weapon can
 occasionally get a hot case down his shirt front. I speak from
 personal experience.

 Yep. SF authors discourage such things...but it won\'t hurt
 to ask, I suppose. I think Jerry Pournelle inherited the

I used to have an excellent sourcebook from Zocchi Games (I think, anyone
with an ID?) with stats for nearly every literary alien imaginable, from Hal
Clements\' Mesklinites to Niven\'s Puppeteers.  In some cases they didn\'t even
bother to change the names to avoid infringement.  The book included generic
stats and a pretty fluid conversion scheme for nearly any of the popular
space games.  Ah, for the good old days of intellectual plunder.  Has anyone
seen this?  I\'d be interested in getting a copy, as my dog enjoyed mine even
more than I did.

Well the original intent of the ship was an armed scout/small
warship. It is fairly packed with sensors and there is also a beefed
up (read more weapons added) version. I\'ll post the design whan
finished. (If it shouldn\'t go to the xboat list that is ??)

BTW how many weapons (not missiles) can a MFD control?

Well... it\'s a TL15 design, and I haven\'t designed any of the other
weapons yet (final exams this week ;-(

Out of hand I\'d say that a TL15 powerplant that could produce that
amount of power wouldn\'t fit into the ship together with the gun.
50,000Mj/0.2=250,000Mj per shot at 100 shots/combat turn =>
25,000,000Mj/30minutes => approx 14000 MW

.. well perhaps it would fit after all (I don\'t remember the
volume/MW of the power plant)

Howdy

I\'m gonna post my kinetic energy missile (KEM) rules one of these days when I

get it all sorted out, but the process of playing/writing them out has posed
a few questions...

Basically, the minimum armor values for ships are way too low.  If you assume
a ship might use 25% of its g-turns to accelerate at maximum, then small
ships
might cruise in-system at speeds of around 20 hexes/turn (or 1.2E06 km/hr).
A small pebble would destroy a scout ship at this speed... without question.

So, what to do about armor?  I think that the BSD armors and above should
only be possible to manufacture in large sheets due to the complexity of the
process.  This would eliminate BSD KEAP rounds, but these are easier to lose
than having to rethink all spacecraft designs.  The point of ditching this is
the following idea:  any material of lesser toughness has a penetration
rating
(PR) that is a positive whole number (ie lasers have a PR of 1/10, steel vs.
BSD has a PR of 10 or something).

Or maybe the lower toughness material could be divided into the larger
toughness
to give the PR (SD vs. BSD would have PR of 2, Crystaliron vs. BSD PR=3.5,
Hard Steel vs. BSD PR=14)

The only reason to limit the KEAP rounds is that if we don\'t KEMs will be
*way* too nasty (a 1g ball would seriously hurt a BB at velocities upwards of
20 hexes/turn).

The result of this is that spacecraft can move at a reasonable clip without
being destroyed.  Without something like this you better keep your
scout/courier
ships below 3 or 4 hexes per turn unless you want them dead.

I think this is a reasonable fix.  Whatcha think?

Three responses

1) I doubt anybody would "cruise" at 20 hexes/turn -- that leaves you with 
minimal maneuverability. Under BL, changing direction by 1/12 of a circle 
(30degrees) requires G-turns equal to half your current velocity - your 
average scout with 2G thrusters would travel 100 hexes and be clear off the 
board before he could change his heading by 30 degrees.

2) Getting to twenty hexes per turn would cost 20 G-hours -- I don\'t have BL 
or TNE here at work with me, but if that\'s 25% I don\'t recall many ships 
having 80 G-turns of fuel.

3) Rather than changing the rules, simply do what we do when reality\'s rules 
prevent us from doing something -- accept the fact that ships don\'t cruise 
around at 20 G-Turns. It\'s perfectly ok to say "based on the rules, it would 
be hazardous for vessels in the TNE universe to travel at extremely high 
velocities, therefore, THEY DON\'T." You don\'t have to change the rules all the
time. It\'s more interesting to see where the basic set of assumptions leads 
you.

I am starting to write up a Rebellion / Hard Times series of scenarios using TNE
rules called "Purple Light" - a story revolving around the players accidental
discovery of revolutionary military Jump Space tumbling software. (I blame an
over exposure to Tangerine Dream albums...)

Hunting round for a suitable location for the adventures I stumbled upon
Imperial Lines #1 (c.1992?) giving information on the Foreven Sector (to the
left of the Spinward Marches). To quote the Introduction:

"Marc Miller has officially set Foreven Setor aside for MegaTraveller players
and referees. [cut text] The individual worlds and systems of the sector have a
official location within the MegaTraveller universe but they will not be named
or have a UWP. [cut lots of text] From here, it\'s up to the individual referee
to decide the future of an entire sector."

Thus, GDW set up a Chaosium style \'Blank Land\' on the borders of the
Imperium/Regency.

Does anyone know if this pledge is still in force for TNE?

True, but by "cruising" I refer to any point to point flight path.  A transfer
orbit insertion burn, then one to orbit your target.  An SBD has 112 gturns, 
and a Scout/Courier has 80 (w/o jump fuel).  The SDB would have to go fast, or
miss the battle since it can\'t jump...

Also (more importantly) what you\'d do in a game of BL vs. how the ships act in
general is what matters here.  There is *no* in-system travel now (how many
months worth of air/food does a ships boat have?).

Answered above.  You\'re right, though, most large ships won\'t have that kind
of fuel... on the other hand they will be better armored.

> 3) Rather than changing the rules, simply do what we do when reality\'s rules

The BL rules don\'t reflect reality.  If this is so *don\'t exceed 3 hexes/turn.*
Ever. (and below that you\'ll have your surface features degraded at a decent
clip.

The basic assumtions are flawed.  Why is min armor max g burn times 10?  It
shouldn\'t even be related to acceleration, but rather the max velocity of the
craft. The Scout has a lower Min Armor value, but it can go faster.  The
toatl g-turns divided by 2 is the crafts maximum velocity (assuming it wants
to stop atsome point :)
Calling Bonded Super Dense armor more than just 14 times stronger
than steel isn\'t out of whack with the rest of the rules.  FFS even talks
about 
non-harded round shattering on better armor... this is just extending that 
a bit :)

a speed of 20 hexes per turn isn\'t all that fast.  At that speed it\'d take a 
month to reach Jupiter from here (assuming it\'s more or less as close as it\'s
gonna get... more if it isn\'t (more likely than not).

Also (final point), what about kinetic kill weapons?  I would like to just see
what the rules lead to, but the rules about missiles are nuts.  If the rules
worked you\'d be able to shoot missiles down.  You can\'t even lock on to them
using the rules, how can you shoot them?  What if you don\'t have a laser?
What if there are more than you can shoot or evade?  Subtract the nuke part of
a missile, and it\'s cheap.  And a bb will kill you. (at speed 20, a 1 gram
shot (i didn\'t even improve it by making it a BSD round) will have a damage
value of 497 and a penetration rating of 1/222... goodbye Battleship, Boom.

So how does this affect the damage allocation? And how do I figure

PS. the ship is a 2000 tonner while the fuel tank is a monster at

BTW isn\'t the reaction mass needed rediculously large? I mean this

me.

    I won\'t argue about reflecting reality in general. In what way specific to
this problem don\'t they reflect reality? The idea of a problem with debris 
impacts is something that is very realistic. The shuttle has had problems with
objects as small as a fleck of paint. I believe they had to replace a window 
over that. And remember LDEF, the Long-Duration Exposure Flight test? And 
neither of their speeds were that high, compared to interplanetary transfers.

    This certainly makes sense. But then, how do you define the max velocity 
of a spacecraft? Total delta-v? Who\'s going to use all his fuel accelerating 
and then not being able to stop? And what about orbital dynamics. A ship\'s 
speed at perigee can be significantly higher than its speed at apogee. 
Especially for a hyperbolic orbit.

    Anyway, my understanding of the min armor was that it was based more on 
structural strength required. And for that, a linear relationship to max 
acceleration is a good first-order approximation.

    As for any problems in the rules with missiles, I haven\'t had the chance 
to play enough to address that. The one time I played, I had no trouble at
all
shooting missiles down several hexes away.

    Looking forward to hearing more ideas on this subject. Especially since I

have this nagging feeling I\'m not really hearing what you\'re trying to say.

"Max velocity"? What is this "max velocity"? When I turn the engines
on, I fall toward them, but when I turn them off, I\'m just floating
there at zero velocity. Now, "maximum velocity relative to <thing>" I
can relate to. No pun intended. In any case, it makes no sense to say
"ship X has a maximum velocity of Y hexes/turn"; it does make sense,
though, to say "if ship X is struck by an object appearing to move Y
hexes/turn, the crew had better have their vacc suits on".

Surely in order to withstand a given acceleration level, a certain
minimum internal structural strength is required, or the ship crumples
like a tin can. 

Also, do any BL/BR players out there chuck this ridiculous "12
movement directions, no exceptions" thing and just use the Mayday
system? I know I certainly would. (For those not in the know, in
Mayday one used three counters per ship to record position last turn,
position this turn, and position next turn. Acceleration was then
simply a matter of moving one\'s "position next turn" within the
limits; every turn, all ships would move their last turn markers to
the current pos\'n, the current pos\'n to the next turn pos\'n, and then
extrapolate linearly the new next turn pos\'n.)

Marco was asking about traveller as a computer game.

Megatraveller and Megatraveller II were released several (3?) years
ago.  This is what I can remember of MEgatraveller I.  I disliked the
interface of Megatraveller II so I never bought it (I borrowed it to 
try it out).

Basically Megatraveller was an adventure game where you (and your party
of four (?) characters of various abilities) fly your 
steadily improving (by your hard-earned investment) vessel from planet 
to planet (there were dozens of
varying degrees of interest) interacting with the natives (occasionally
violently) and with other spacecraft (usually violently).  

Through either trading prowess or piracy you eventually acquire what you
need (sorry...no spoilers-it was awhile ago) and "finish" the adventure.
Not a bad game, but don\'t expect the pleasure of a "real" traveller
refereed adventure.  Computer games can\'t (yet) approximate the 
possibilities of a human imagination.

Another, similar game (if you like the genre) is Sentinel Worlds I.  The 
format is basically the same, but a bit more monotonous (and harder to
finish).  That game came out in the late 1980\'s (87-88?).

Megatraveller had the "feel" of traveller (especially the character
generation.
In fact, you could generate and print characters in either I or II for use 
with the RPG), but the game retained playability despite the obvious pruning
required to make it a computer game.

Huh?  The absolute maximum velocity (plus small changes if you use a 
a gravity slingshot (though at traveller ship velocities this won\'t add
much))
*is* the number of g-turns of fuel a ship has.  Period.  If you have 112
g-turns, the ships max velocity is 112 hexes/turn (6.72 Mkm/hr).  If it
would like to come to a stop at some point, the max velocity it can reach is
half that.  I take it when you say "i fall towards them" you talk about the 
passenger *in* the craft.  Your relative velocity to the hull is zero (unless
you push off to go down the hall), but you would still have some velocity 
(whatever the ship has).

Of couse it does.  The total Delta V of the ship is its fuel in g-turns
(delta
v in hexes per turn in this case).

True enough, acceleration will determine the *force* on the hull.  But
*armor*
isn\'t internal structure.

Exactly.  But if ships can\'t move faster than 120,000 km/hr, then what does
that
do to the traveller universe (which predates BL)?  Why are the ships provided
not corrected for this reality if this is really the case?  The bottom line
is 
no one thought of it (otherwise the rules on travel times, etc would say "by 
the way, going faster than X is dangerous")

I was defining it as maneuver fuel (in g-turns) divided by 4.  This is going
to
be arbitrary (although 1/2 fuel might be better----up to max, then decel).

True enough, but traveller ships can already easily reach system escape
velocity
so I don\'t think it\'d matter too much.  My rules changes are very simple:

*Bonded Super Dense armor (or better) is qualitatively better than other 
materials.  Lesser materials have reduced penetration against it.*

It removes having to worry about space garbage (except big stuff added now
and
then as a plot device :)

May well be, I thought that was what internal structure was for, but FFS
isn\'t
always all that clear. :-/

Really?  Even with a crack crew, and range 16 AEMS, the base diff level to 
detect a TL15 controlled missile is Form (35% will be detected), and vs. a
TL14 SIM it\'s Imp (only 15% will be detected).  If you lock \'em they\'re dead,
but you\'ll only get one try at this range band.  Bottom line is most get 
a whack at you.

I frequently have that problem :)  I always liked the techie side of things, 
so this is really fun for me.  Besides, I want any changes our group makes to
make sense, so it helps to bounce the ideas off others.

The basic damage value is Sqrt(Joules)/15.  The Pen ratings are done with a 
table in FFS.

laser and all enemy looking in the wrong direction are blind.  Even filters

Another example is the calculation of acceleration.  To be truly accurate,
you must use mass, not volume.  (I belaboured this point long and hard when
FFS was being written, believe me.)  GDW decided that volume made easier
calculations, that not many people would care about the difference, and that
those that did would change the rules anyway.  I played around with their
numbers, and volume actually _does_ make a reasonable approximation,
providing that the ship isn\'t too dense.

Will do.  I have been bashing the BL/FFS rules for a while since I got them, 
I\'m still cleaning up our house rules and wanted so external input.  I really
like BL or I\'d just use something else----its flaws are easy to fix so I thought
I\'d just do that.

One quick note Re: "changing" the way the armor works.  If micro-meteorites were
a major problem facing spacecraft it would\'ve been mentioned in the BL, FFS 
rules, or in the design notes in Challenge 71.  Since no problems were
mentioned
I think it is reasonable to assume that spacecraft armor is supposed to
protect
them, so if it doesn\'t, then I assume it was simply a minor oversight on the 
part of the designers (FFS was a rather major undertaking not to miss
anything).

I have a tendency to think better in dialogue rather than monologue... as a 
result I end up having to restate things to get the idea I\'m after across.

Subject: Traveller Computer Games
 
Hello,
 
I noticed somewhere in the traveller script, a question about Traveller
compute
r games. There exist two versions of a Mega Traveller game out on PC, called
Megatraveller I and Megatraveller II (return of the ancients or something
like
this).
 
Character generation of this game seems to be good, but the game itself is
too
easy and you do not get quality for your money. I used the
charactergeneration
of this program to produce NPC\'s for my SF campaigns and my fiction worlds of
Quasar.
 
I hope this helped a bit. When I am used to this editor, I try to include the
reference of the person asking the Question.

Hmm, good idea, I forgot about ES Armor (I\'ve just been designing ships :)

Might work.  All my group wants is not to have to worry so much about it, so
we\'d settle for any reasonable hand-waving that will discount it :)

The idea that silica, Fe, or whatever expends its KE some other way than
penetration was all my BSD fudge was about any way.  Maybe we could use
gravtics since it is the traveller waving hand of choice :)

That would work, too.  But figuring out power requirements would
be sort of arbitrary.

I agree about the "waving hand of choice" re: gravitics.

Should we nominate GDW for the "Smoke and Mirrors" award?

The switch to talking about "maximum delta-v" makes things a bit

a ship with full fuel load which starts at zero relative velocity to

"maximum relative velocity to a debris cloud attainable without

True enough, but for the most part ships will be operating near planets (they
have little choice about that now fuel wise).  Conservation of angular momentum
will mean that for the most part the debris will be moving in the same kind of
orbits that the ships are (roughly).  I wasn\'t even considering the inherent
velocity of matter in the system since in 1 or 2 turns of thrust any traveller
ship is probably hyperbolic to the system and the local movement of stuff won\'t 
be as important.

But, as you point out, unless the armor is somehow better, even "standing still"
is dangerous.

True enough.  Makes the need for some correction even more important.  If you
use the idea in your traveller game it can make for some interesting
situations.

I read recently that Bucky Balls (Buckminster Fullerine carbon footballs)
\'glued\' to glass or the like have the property that as more light is shone
at them, they absorb more, so the amount going through doesn\'t increase -
currently people are thinking of using this for goggles for... (wait for
it...) staff using high power lasers, etc.
I have always envisaged that any decent TL armour with a face mask will
include either something \'chemical\' like the bucky-ball effect or something
\'electronic\' where light intensity detectors vary the transparency of the
visor to cope with sudden flashes, etc. These systems would be vital in high
tech military operations where soldiers may be subjected to nuclear flash,
fusion/plasma gun flash, flash (e.g. magnesium, phosphorus) grenades and
blinding by lasers (either intentional or unintentional - see the hazard
warning signs around the laser systems used on US aircraft for fooling
missile IR homing systems).
I have no idea what frequencies of electromagnetic radiation the bucky-ball
goggles would protect against but Traveller does have 5000+ years to create
better alternatives.
So... just cos FF&S, etc. don\'t mention it, doesn\'t mean you can\'t use it...
But, as Rob pointed out, always explain any assumptions underlying YOUR
universe so the rest of us know what\'s going on!

Oh, and on approximations, has anyone actually worked out the sphere volumes
on which the FF&S hull volumes are calculated? Everything in the rules HAS
to be approximated in order not to make things too complicated. I always
allow a fudge factor of + or - 10% or so on ANY factor (whether it be length
of a weapon or size of a starship drive) to reflect the variety which one
finds in \'real\' life.

SPACECRAFT ARMOUR
\'Futuristic\' designs (Bussard ramjet things, etc.) usually have some mention
of projecting some form of deflecting screen ahead of the ship to deflect
particles ahead of the ship; alternatively a heavily armoured front hull.
Neither protects you against particles travelling faster than the ship
coming in from the side or rear. Some form of weak projected gravitational
field or electrostatic field should deflect the majority of incoming debris
leaving just the interesting chunks which I use for random space encounters
and for when the pilot rolls a double-1 (showing my age here, using CT/MT
rules!).

I think what he was trying to say is that velocity must be related to
something. That is you have to have a coordinate system to give the
numbers in. For example, a plane flying relates it\'s speed either to
the surrounding air, or to the ground below (with radar).
For a satellite in earth orbit, it would be most natural to relate
it\'s velocity to the earth. You would relate the earth\'s velocity to
the sun, and the sun\'s vel. to perhaps the center of the milky way.

The thing he was picking on is that you said max. velocity. Without
any reference point.

     ----
     
     I posted a suggestion to this list a couple of weeks ago that lasers 
     should be allowed to have non-fractional, non-nil penetration ratings 
     (e.g. PR of 3).
     
     Given the messages that had been appearing about dis-satisfaction with 
     the effects of TNE SA lasers (c.f. MT or CT), I kind of expected some 
     comments / ridicule.  The only person to say anything on this thread 
     has been Tariq Rashid (any chance of you mailing the laser you 
     designed with the PR of 6?), since then.
     
     I am quite keen to receive some more feedback, since I don\'t fancy 
     designing the McCauley Arms range of Lasers if my thoughts about IPRs 
     < 1 are flawed.
     
     Has anyone at GDW noticed my original message (tml digest 115)?  Is 
     the rule in FF&S about IPR >= 1 a mistake, or does it model some real 
     effect (it seems to imply that powerful lasers can penetrate really 
     well - the fractional PR - but as the energy is reduced, there is a 
     point at which penetration drops drastically - where IPR is about 1)?  
     A brief comment would be most appreciated.

..and then there was something I read in the paper or somewhere
not too long ago about someone developing an optical filter that 
could darken in response to bright light in a matter of nano-seconds.  They
were looking at using it for optical switching circuits, but someone pointed
out that it could also be used for goggles to protect you from accidental
laser blindings and other sudden flashes.  Being blinded by a laser becomes
a non-problem above TL 8...

favorite game, namely T:TNE. 

 I didnt subscribe to this list so that I could join in on the discussion 
of whether or not Traveller obeys the laws of Physics (and it most 
certainly doesnt). So please, less of the discussions on whether or not  
spaceships and starships can survive micro-meteor collisions; or the 
radius of an AM explosion. Leave that to the physicists (and GDW) to 
worry about.

For my nano-credits worth:
(1) Starships in the Traveller game can survive impacts of small 
particles, thats why they are given armour.
(2) I dont care what the radius of an AM explosion is; as long as it 
doesnt detract from the enjoyment of the PC\'s in my group who are into 
T:TNE thats alright.

First and foremost T:TNE (and the other versions) is about pure 
escapism; For me it is the sheer diveristy and the richness of the 
Traveller background that makes me play it. 

Remember its only a game. If you want to play hard science-fiction, go 
play 2300AD (another damn fine roleplaying game, GDW bring out a 
supplement on it).

(although I didn\'t know about the buckyballs, which were published after

won\'t have military equipment to protect them.  Before adding blinding,
consider the following possibilities:

i) Criminals break into a building waving blinding lasers and goggles. 
Security guards might be wearing goggles, but civilians won\'t.  Result, many
blinded civilians running around (interfering with guard\'s aim) while
criminals finish mission.

ii) Mod-tech Marines land on a world.  Natives object.  Marines blind native
armies.  No fight.  Native guerillas ambush in woods, but after first shot
Marines flash lasers around.  Blind attackers.  Even if they can steal
goggles, they will still be outnumbered.  (Suppose there\'s an adventure
there: the players are hired to smuggle 100 000 pairs of sunglasses to a
rebel leader!)

iii) After 5000+ years of warfare, retinal replacement technology will be
pretty good.  (Heh, look what they can do with bullet wounds in Northern
Ireland right now.)  This implies increased possibilities for a
cyberpunk-style \'the body is just a machine\' attitude, nasty biotech, etc. 
Don\'t ignore the spinoffs!

iv) Warship hangs inorbit demanding surrender.  Population refuses. 
Shipboard lasers target population centers - no one can look skyward safely.

None of these stop you having blinding in your game.  Not fancying them,
though, I\'m ignoring blinding in my own games.

Volunteers are needed to participate to trail blazing campaign.
This mission is launched from Aubaine and the destination is Karaguuka
(0116/Diaspora). Mission termination is in Aubaine. The volunteers will be
comissioned to a clipper. The mission is to escort converted scout ship
RC Columbus (J-3) to Karaguuka and also clean that J-3 route to be a post
route in near future between Karaguuka and Aubaine. That scout ship will
stay in Karaguuka. The clipper will transport troopers to Karaguuka (the
amount won\'t be much).

In reality I need someone with Brilliant Lances/Battle Rider to run this
campaign for me. That is because I don\'t have above mentioned products and
I don\'t intend to buy those because space fights are so rare in my campaigns.
You can choose the clipper and the way it is equipped, the scout is not
intended to participate in combat but of course it is your decision. The
scout has TL-15 laser turret. It is also possible to add more ships to that
campaign if you want but I prefer that only those two ships will participate.

The scout is manned by my players and I can mail their stats and more accurate
stats for RC Columbus.

I\'d like to have timeline and maybe even TNE stats for planets that are in
the course. If TNE stats for worlds is a problem, I can generate them and 
the course.

I hope that some players are interested for this possibly quite long campaign.
I am more than happy to answer any questions about this campaign. As you
might have quessed my campaign is set in RC campaign.

That will be all for now,

I think its important to re-emphisise what Loren is saying here.  For a long
period of time, I had problems dealing with Star Trek: The Role Playing Game
because I felt that I had to be "canon" in everything that I did.  What
happens when the next movie changes something that I have done?  Well, that
level of thinking will distract you from the enjoyment of the game.  You
have to put "future canon" out of your mind (BTW: canon is a Star Trek term
for "Official, Accepted as Law").  

At the time you pick up your products and start creating your own history
and future seeded from the Traveller books, you have to accept the fact that
GDW is going to release something in the future that will most assuridly not
fit the timeline created by your players.  You have to adjust things to
either get them back in sync, which is not very hard, or you just ignore the
differences and keep your game going the way its going.

Its most important to understand that if GDW releases something that changes
your history,  you as the GM just don\'t change your history with the wave of
a hand.  "Well this new book says this, so that colony you built on Regina
isn\'t there any more" will get you lynched as a GM.

Don\'t get hung up on "what if GDW does this".  If you want to develope a
sector on your own, go for it.  Just understand that you can keep your own
timelines even if something is released later that changes it.

For playability - dead right!

Filters? Of course not unless they block whole chunks of the EM 
spectrum - at which point you can\'t see. The solution here, as used 
by military pilots to avoid nuke-flash blinding is to wear 
goggles/faceplate which darkens fast enough to block all light before 
the amount is high enough to cause blindind - this is done using 
electro-(something I\'ve forgotten, this is from a lecture course I 
attended years ago!) materials which are controlled using light 
sensors. This should be effective, as long as the materials respond 
*very* fast!

btw the low-tech solution is an eyepatch - once one eye is burned you 
use the other ;-)

really going to add my credit (what you won\'t swipe my card
because I was recently in the wolds?) but the thing about using
lasers against unprotected civilians did get me thinking.

In a recent campaign I wound up in some battle armor.  (A robotics
expert trapped in a gorilla suit desperately trying not to hit the
wrong switch.)  It was pointed out at the time that there was a laser
sight on the suit which was used for the big guns we didn\'t have.
We used the laser sight to get some unarmored guards to attention,
but even a low level laser like that can cause blindness when flashed
directly into the eyes.

Of course, if you are talking about unarmed civilians, and those at
a low tech level or a law level where they don\'t expect these things
to happen every day, there\'s a lot more than your laser that your
higher tech level people can do to basically put them out of comission.

Sound is a good weapon.  At low frequencies, it can produce nausea and
vomiting.  It was used by the Germans in WWII in occupied France to 
good effect.  Sound might also be used as a carrier to send subliminal
messages of dispair and hoplessness.  (Hmmm, that sounds like something
a virus should do.)

So is this really the stuff of TNE?  Well, that depends on what you want
to do and how you want to get the players motivated.  After all, there
are a lot of worlds out there where tyrants rule by the sole advantage
of having a slightly higher tech level.  (for example living on the ruins
of the local low port station)   Or maby the rebels on a planet are more
evil than the dictator himself.  It sort of reminds me of another GDW game
that they once had, "Dark Conspiracy" where a popular GM tool was to have
various NPC\'s get bumped off, and have it slowly approach or draw in
the players till they think they are \'next\'.  After all, if you want to
explore other worlds you have to be prepared for landing in the middle
of things now and then.

Well, seeing as we\'ve stumbled on to a subject I\'m studying, I\'ll put
my two cents in.

The effect of the buckyballs in preventing laser blinding is due to
their nonlinear optical response.  "non linear" means that if you
double the amount of incident light, the amount of transmitted light
is not doubled.  There are a number of materials that exhibit this
sort of behavior.  One thing is that this effect can be instentaneous,
it\'s not necessarially a function of it "getting darker".  

[Exceedingly Technical bit so nobody accuses me of over simplyfing:
Basically what you need is a multi-photon absorbtion to a state that
decays non-radiatively, and quickly.  Perhaps something like a
photoelectric process something like that in chlorophyll.  (except
with 2 or three photon absorbtion)]

Also laser blinding is not all that effective as a weapon.  The reason
lasers are so effective for blinding is that the light does not
disperse.  However, this means that in order to blind someone you have
to point the laser right at their eye, which is moderately difficult.
You could just scan the laser back and forth, but if you scan too
fast, it won\'t spend enough time on their eye to cause significant
damage, too slow, and it becomes inefficient again.  Probably the best
way to blind lots of opponents is to set off a really bright flash
behind you.  Or wear spotlights on your hat.  The only reason lasers
are dangerous in every day life, is that there are very few other
similarly intense light sources.  (Atomic weapons and the Sun spring
to mind, but aside from that, not much.  Flash grenades?)

Well, wasn\'t Hinterworlds covered in a special supplement in Challenge
39 (or was that 40)?  Also, for Diaspora you\'ve got the last of the MT
supplements--The Astrogator\'s Guide To Diaspora.  Charles Gannon did
this one, and I think that he also expands upon it in The Traveller

If you don\'t have either of these, just drop me a line and I\'ll let you

Sounds good to me.  I had already decided to do the same thing when I saw
your letter, so I didn\'t propose it again.  I noted that <1 IPR lasers will
not penetrate hard armor and do damage at all, but they still have excess

(1) As a long time reader of this list, I have observed that these
things come and go: technical discussions of interest only to
the 3 people participating in them will fill the list for weeks, only
to be suddenly replaced with a flurry of ship designs, amber zones,
worlds, generally neat ideas, and the start of the NEXT boring technical
argument.

(2) The best way to break up a dull discussion thread is NOT to complain
about it -- it is to contribute something more interesting.  This usually
inspires other, equally bored lurkers to contribute similarly interesting
material.

(3) Remember, it is Christmas break.  A good chunk of the TML is "home for
the holidays" and not reading or contributing.  The TML is always dull this
time of year.

Excuse me, but where do you get off telling people how they MUST play
Traveller?  Maybe some of us WANT to play hard science fiction with the TNE
ruleset and in the Traveller universe!  Apparently, a *lot* of us feel that
way, judging from the number of technical discussions that go by.  If you
don\'t want to play it that way, then don\'t!  But don\'t tell others they
can\'t.

Some people *like* technical discussions.  Also, I\'ve tried to put some
emphasis on how rules fixes I\'m working on relate to players.  It frequently
isn\'t a problem of *physics*, but rather it is one of consistancy.  I\'ve made
an attempt to announce my biases along with the new whatever I post (though
those kind of comments get left out of the replys frequently).

True enough.  If everyone posts something of interest to themselves, they\'ll
be lots of neat stuff to choose from, this is easier to do if the subject
line is
descriptive.

Technical "problems" can also end up being nifty plot devices.  SF is full of
nifty physical situations and their solutions.  Something to remember...

Howdy,

well, I got another mini (the free trader) and thought I\'d make a couple
comments.  

The sculpt is pretty good (though the mold had some rips that I could see).
I\'ve always liked the Beowolf design, and it is pretty true to it.  The turrets
come as two additional pieces.  The only real problems are related to the 
casting job, which isn\'t as good as the PC (I cast stuff for a living, so I\'m
a bit hyper-sensitive to this, I guess :)

My recurrent question is:  What scale is it in?  I know from Loren\'s post
that
they are not all in the same scale, but it would be nice to at least have the

scale printed on the package so my players won\'t ask "so how much bigger
would
the Patrol Cruiser really be?"

If I knew what alloy they were using getting the volume would be easy, but I
don\'t.  I\'m recasting it in a known resin to calculate the volume... I\'ll
post 
the scale when I get it done. (I know I could displace water to do the same,
but
I\'d rather have an extra to make into a wreak :)

BTW, does anyone have deck plans for the PC?  What is the length on it really
supposed to be?

The starship weapons presented here are intended to be use with Brilliant Lances, and Traveller: =0D
The New Era. I have used Fire, Fusion & Steel, GDW\'s book about hardware design for the =0D
Traveller universe. This document will be updated as new weapons are being designed.=0D
=0D
There are several types of weapons in this documents. Some are not covered at this time, but will =0D
be. Since I started this document nearly 6 months ago I intended it to contain only lasers, but as I =0D
started to exchange ideas with others via the TML I found it necessary to include other types of =0D
weapons also. There are several philosofies covered in the designs presented below. The types of =0D
weapons covered are as following:=0D
		Grav focused Lasers=0D
		Non-grav focused Lasers (x-ray)=0D

The un-manned turrets and barbettes require MFD\'s if installed. These turrets and barbettes are =0D
recomended to be installed on larger starships (2000tons or more) to save in on the crew count. =0D
The Turrets should then be combined into batteries, with one MFD per battery.=0D

I would just like to point out that I agree with everyone, i.e.:

* YES * please people send in your characters, adventures, etc. to traveller
(I know you don\'t get anything for it and your name will only be in lights
for a few moments, but some of us really do _value_ your contributions).

* YES * please do continue technical discussions (except where they grow to
the length of the feudal technocracy thingy just before TML folded). Okay,
so the technicalities might be over some people\'s heads or not seem
immediately relevant, but I find such things are very good at preparing me
for the dread moment when a player asks "But why does it do that?". If
he/she is a professor of physics, then you can at least sound intelligent
when discussing it with them. If they\'re just a normal player, blind \'em
with your new-found science!

This isn\'t to tell you what to do, just to encourage a wider range of stuff
on the mailing list. Okay, so Christmas is a bit slow... but everyone ought
to be coming back afterwards with all the stuff they\'ve been writing up over
the hols (in between drinks)! :-)

It is a value used to resolve initiative ties.

> How do I use it?

If the two combatants have the same initiative, take their agility and
subtract the weapon bulk.  The higher agility (after adjusting for bulk)
goes first.

1)  The mail gateway machine for that portion of Lotus is, pardon
my language but it\'s actually Jo\'s language, fucked up.  "Top Men"
are working on the problem 8^)  So he\'s still there (and probably
hopping mad that his email isn\'t working right), but contact will
probably remain intermittant for a little while longer.

2)  If communication MUST be made with him, you can email me and
I can pass it on - I have a non-internet connection with the Dublin
division of Lotus (and it actually works 8^)...

3)  Lotus Mainframe?  WhatchootalkinboutWillis?  8^)

the fact that REALLY LONG technical discussions might increase the signal-to-

Discussion topic:

What is the place of languages in Traveller (Regency or Wilds), and how 
would I role-play it?

Personal comments:

IN THE REGENCY:  Things arn\'t so bad here when it comes to 
communication.  First, just about every human speaks proper Imperial 
Galanglic (with that famous Deneb drawl).  When you need to talk to 
someone who can\'t speak Galanglic, you grab your translator, and talk on. 
(P.S. the other guy needs a translator, too!  Translators are in common 
use on worlds of TL B +)

IN THE WILDS: Well, you can forget the translator.  Even if you can find 
one, it\'s likely that it\'s infected.  Admittedly, it\'s typically just a 
egg, which means that you can forget adding info... and possibily the 
entire contents of the memchip\'s been wiped.  Our neighbourhood, 
homocidal Virus, however, may have left a nasty little surprise for the 
unwary.

I expect that that your average Free Trader in the Wilds can speak  
least 3-4 different languages fluently (skill 4+), and a couple of words 
in 6-10 languages. 

TRANSLATORS: First off, living (I was going to say \'human\') translators are 
most valuable in _Written_ material (which regular TNE translators are
useless,
being angled for speech).  The more subtle and specialized the material, the
more needful your living translator is.  

(Yes, I know that translator-software is being written now, even as we 
speak.  However, this software is not exactly astounding [ie. it\'s 
current 99% accuracy rate is simply not good enough for professional 
work].  Moreover, I feel that translation software (verbal or script) 
will always have certain limitations, since the meaning behind the words 
can be best sensed by a fellow sophont, rather than a machine.  These 
problems can be overcome by [say] expensive TL E+ software, but only 
moderately-wealthy Regency citizens would benefit from this)

More importantly than this is the fact that translators are usually good 
at Liaison, too.  Thus, they can act as guides for the visiting stranger, 
warning about local taboos, provide guidance about what to eat, etc.

SUMMARY:  If you\'re in the Wilds, one of the most interesting 
carrer-choices available is as Translator/Guide (consider it a varient 
of the Diplomatic carrer).

If in the Regency, you can still have fun with conversations.  A small 
mistake in translating, a misreading of verbal stress or hand gesters, 
and a mission can go down the drain, or an Incident arise...

Dear Mr. Wiseman:

Just an idea in my head.

How about a sourcebook for the Free Traders?

I\'d think that being a Free Trader in the Wilds would make a fasinating 
culture in it\'s own right, with it\'s own \'governments\', dialects, 
history, clothing styles, myths and lore, religions & superstitutions.

Perhaps, after you\'re finished with the Alien books...?

Of course, in my mind, this has a lower priority to my Wet Ships and 
Robots...

Use meson detectors (communicators, that is) on small craft or drones in
between the large BB target, and the planet (they\'ll be looking for beam slop,
or using the forces the manipulate to prematurely decay some of them (they are
in a direct path between likely target and planet).  It\'s worth a shot (wouldn\'t
wanna crew the thing, though :)

Good Idea (tm)!  I was just playing with fusion drives last night.  You\'d think
that they\'d improve above TL9 though.  I was planning on having improvements
happen to them at the same milestones as fusion powerplants, and nuclear dampers
since these would be the related technologies.  If the fuel consumption figure
could go just a little lower, then fusion rockets would be *very* useful.

Military ships (BBs, and other large ones) have way too little propellant now.
I haven\'t been able to design a capitol ship with much more than 50 g-turns.
Remember that 50 gturns is only 8.5 turns of fuel at max burn (evading spinal
mounts makes you use a lot of gturns :)  (unless you haven\'t limited the lasers
in FFS which will allow a DD to kill your BB at 44 hexes ;)

I figured a Vargr Corsair would have 94.75 gturns if it replaced all the 
m-drive volume and fuel.  106.75 if you include a reduction in the powerplant
due to the fusion drive\'s 240MW extra power production.

Better, certainly (19% better), but you\'d think TL15 would be somewhat better
considering the fundamental changes above TL9.

BTW, I calculated the KE of HEPlaR exhaust, and it is more than the energy put
into the reaction mass by the powerplant (by *a lot*), so the HEPlaR drives
have to be fusion rockets to some degree, because there isn\'t enough energy
input to accelerate the reaction mass.

Except for:

The numerous Sword Worlders (with their Icelandic tongue; close
  to Galanglic, but not quite it) on their home planets.

The Darrians, with their own language.

The increasingly numerous Aslan, whose cultural imperative require that
  their language (trokh) be their first language. BTW, those same cultural
  imperatives can render social gaffes and translation errors into insults
  that require satisfaction by duel.

The Zhodani traders; let us not forget that the Zho are the LARGEST human
  empire at this point. Regardless of what you hear from the Regency
  government, they exist at the whim of the Zhodani.

The Vargr - not the imperial citizens brought up on imperial planets, but
  those colorful pups from Coreward, speakers of the Gvegh languages (there
  are actually more than 1; see your Vargr and Vilani for details..).

Admittedly, the Zho and the Vargr will mostly be encountered within the
Regency in groups where someone speaks Galanglic - and if you aren\'t
protected, noble Zho will KNOW what you meant to say. Darrians with lots of
Regency contact will probably learn some Galanglic - but get off the beaten
path and pull out that phrase book! Stiff-necked Sword Worlders will
probably make a point of not understanding you, given a choice...

>  When you need to talk to
>someone who can\'t speak Galanglic, you grab your translator, and talk on.
>(P.S. the other guy needs a translator, too!  Translators are in common
>use on worlds of TL B +)

In our campaign, we decided that a 1 way translator was pretty useless, so
1 translator can work both ways - if you have the second language loaded
into it, too.  Also, note that building a translator into your ship\'s
computer only really requires the software to be added to the already
powerful ship\'s computer; running two way translation is a snap if
necessary, especially over radio - and in fact is easier if the output is
text (you type; the translator translates and outputs the equivalent of
ASCII in the appropriate language for the recipient, who displays the text
on a monitor much as you are reading now; much more sensible for
ship-to-ship communications).

>IN THE WILDS: Well, you can forget the translator.
Of course, if you are a trader with access to a few high tech planets  -
like those that buy your ship, you can probably buy these new. (Note what
I said earlier about using one for two-way translation; in the worse case,
you buy two, one translating FROM Galanglic into language X).
On the other hand, 70 years is not enough time for Galanglic to change to
incomprehensible.  In what used to be the middle of the Imperium, you\'ll
hardly need a translator to understand the natives. Even in strong minor
human cultures that retained their own languages, odds are good that all
knowledge of Galanglic will not disappear within 70 years - semi-civilized
places with still have had existing school programs in place. Galanglic
will not disappear overnight in most places.

Non-human sophonts are
another question - it seems to me that even after a few thousand years of
human domination, non-humans are probably still more comfortable speaking a
language designed to fit their physiogeny.

Note that you must have a datachip for language X before a translator will
do you any good at all. Or someone with Computer, Language X, and Linguistics
(not to mention a fair amount of free time-like several weeks) to write a
new translation database.

>Even if you can find
>one, it\'s likely that it\'s infected.
Actually, its rather UNlikely that it\'s infected. Consider - the Virus
spread by network.  The translators were mostly used standalone. Odds are
good that standalone machines are fine.

Actually, a sentient Virus trapped in a small, unnetworked computer
(careful with those commo connections!) with a voice interface could be a
lot of fun for PCs (or GMs) to play with :-)

See above for comments about other languages.  More likely, a team of
raders will know several languages between them (take a good look at
character development - 12 skills (3-4 langs @ 4+) is a heck of an
investment in time! More likely 2 langs max at 4+; more likely 1 at 4+ and
2-3 at skill 2-3. Spread between a crew of say 5, you can cover a lot of
ground...


>TRANSLATORS: First off, living (I was going to say \'human\') translators are

Again, consider the task. Text translation is a LOT easier than
speech, since written words are more easily deciphered than written.
Consider using document translation software at 1 TL earlier than speech
recognition devices.

>(Yes, I know that translator-software is being written now, even as we
>speak.  However, this software is not exactly astounding [ie. it\'s

Not by itself, but if a machine can translate 99% of text in a moment or
two and then hand the result to a human for an accuracy or cogency check,
that\'s one hell of a time savings! (and a lot cheaper than hiring a human
specialist full time, especially if you have to haul that human through
space, feeding him, and supplying him with air at a kilocredit a week!)

However, I could certainly see a place for a specialized translator career:

First Career:
Linguistics 1
Language (select one) 2
Liaison 1
Choice of:
Computer Ops, Act/Bluff, Bargain (up to limit of skills)

Subsequent:
Choice of:
Computer Ops, Act/Bluff, Bargain, Linguistics, Language (select one),
Liaison, Commo, Carouse

Slings, arrows, comments, flames cheerfully accepted (but ignored as I 
sit fit).

Yeah, I did that too.  I also calculated the drive temperature (from
the exhaust velocity) I got something like 10^8 or 10^9 degrees
Kelvin.  The black body radiation the exhaust stream gives off is
something awful.  (As in most likely more dangerous than the enemy\'s
weapons).  I think the fix here is to ignore the problem :-)

Another little bit of non-physical nonsence is in the FFS laser rules.
Damage is proportional to intensity.  So the 10 MJ laser with the
10cm^2 spot size does as much damage as the 1 MJ laser with the 1cm^2
spot size.  (but 10 of the smaller lasers do 10X as much damage).  I\'d
say the fix here is to make penetration proportional to intensity, and
damage to energy. (And hope nobody starts making lasers with a spot
size larger than their opponent :-)

A likely story.

O.K., O.K, I see your point.
I just wanted to pick on Star Trek, my favourate source of technobabble...
(even their fantasy is utterly outclassed by Star Wars...
and yes, I do know that some of their shows are excellent)

Yea, but in the Third Imperium, Galanglic was a kind of lingua franca, 
shared by the nobility, navy, and the interstellar merchants.  Outside of 
the extraterritorial zone of the starport, there\'s a good chance that the 
general populance speaks a language other than Galanglic for their 
everyday affair\'s.  

Now, with no nobility, no navy, and precious few merchants, the local 
language would have absolute dominance.  In many instances, the local 
language _is_ Galanglic, and this poses no translation difficulities.  In 
many other instances, the local language _isn\'t_ Galanglic, but the 
elite\'s have learned Galanglic at school via teacher\'s or low-tech 
audiovisual equipment.  And finally - and most rarely - NOBODY knows 
Galanglic.  This is possible when the Collapse was fast, hard, and 
merciless without *quite* killing everyone off.

Oh yea - 
  don\'t forget that to use Traveller translators, you need TWO
         - one for yourself (say, Anglic/Vargr)
         - and ONE FOR THE OTHER PARTY (ie. Vargr/Anglic)

Important: just having one for yourself DOES NOT WORK!

Kevin,

   That being the case, why would an unimpeachable source like Loren
Wiseman report that their license had expired?  Loren could of course
be mistaken....I think maybe he (Loren) needs to clear this up.

     Laser Penetration
     ----

     I posted a suggestion to this list a couple of weeks ago that lasers
     should be allowed to have non-fractional, non-nil penetration ratings
     (e.g. PR of 3).

     Given the messages that had been appearing about dis-satisfaction with
     the effects of TNE SA lasers (c.f. MT or CT), I kind of expected some
     comments / ridicule.  The only person to say anything on this thread
     has been Tariq Rashid (any chance of you mailing the laser you
     designed with the PR of 6?), since then.

     I am quite keen to receive some more feedback, since I don\'t fancy
     designing the McCauley Arms range of Lasers if my thoughts about IPRs
     < 1 are flawed.

     Has anyone at GDW noticed my original message (tml digest 115)?  Is
     the rule in FF&S about IPR >= 1 a mistake, or does it model some real
     effect (it seems to imply that powerful lasers can penetrate really
     well - the fractional PR - but as the energy is reduced, there is a
     point at which penetration drops drastically - where IPR is about 1)?
     A brief comment would be most appreciated.
 ----

Lasers with PR > 1 do not occur because of the relationship between PR and 
Damage used in FF&S.
If a laser is designed as per FF&S with an intensity less than 0.390625 
Mj/cm^2 it will have a PR >1 and a Damage Value of 1or less  which will not 
penetrate any armour! Thus it makes more sense to rate lasers as PR=0 in 
this case.
The two things that I think GDW have missed are:
 - It is assumed that lasers cannot be focussed on an area less than 1 cm^2
(solution? "R" in the intensity formula may be <1 for IPR ONLY)
 - If damage is not rounded then a fractional amount may be left after 
penetration which would be sufficient to cause 1 or more personnel damage 
dice. This is important at the intensities common for small arms lasers. 
This is particularly evident if the IPR is not rounded and the above 
focussing rule is used.

I hope that this will be of use to laser small arms designers.

A happy fire festival to all,

Django.

 I\'d _love_ to get a copy of this article...

T::>What else is out there?

 Well, I don\'t recall _seeing_ anything out there, but here\'s a few 
 ideas that you can use to simulate other games:

 (1)  Chess, in one form or another, always recognizable, has been 
 a part of Solomani existance since possibly two thousand 
 standard years before the zero date of the Solomani calendar.  
 Go look at a book on Chess and its variants and relatives (Xiang 
 Qi, Shogi, Chaturanga), and combine some of the features of 
 several of them into a new game.  I like doing this kind of thing; 
 I\'d be glad to help out if anyone would like...

 (2)  Card games of some sort are also ubiquitous through history.  
 Different societies had different designs for the cards, different 
 rules, and perhaps different organizations for the deck (I 
 remember one SF game which adopted the Terran deck, but added at 
 least four additional suits).  Again, do a little homework, and 
 come up with your own.  Don\'t feel compelled to stick to "western" 
 cards, with numbered cards that have a fixed rank order - check 
 out the Japanese game of hanafuta, or the card game that is part 
 of the computer game called "Heaven and Earth".  If you want to 
 cheat, somewhere around I even have the complete rules for Fizzbin 
 (you _do_ remember Fizzbin, don\'t you?) which I\'d be willing to 
 try to dig out and post here...

 (3)  Look for some games that are "off the beaten track" and "pass 
 them off" as alien games.  If they\'re really simple games, like 
 mancala games or the old "Morris" games, feel free to revise the 
 rules or imbue them with some sort of religious or cultural 
 significance that the players/PCs are likely to miss or 
 misinterpret (that\'s always a good way to complicate the 
 scenario).  Again, I have a few that I can dig out if anyone\'s 
 interested.

 (4)  Consider other fundamental aims for games - instead of trying 
 to achieve captures to win, try scoring points based on patterns 
 established on the board by the playing pieces.

 (5)  If you\'re _really_ a game nut (and I do mean _nut_), try 
 translating word games, such as Scrabble, into an alien language 
 (High Vilani?  Trokh?  Zhodani?).  Or perhaps simpler word games, 
 such as the Jumbles that appear in many newspapers, or Jotto 
 (which is really MasterMind, with letters instead of colored 
 pegs).

 (6)  Games with simple rules will probably have wide appeal.  
 Think about which games from the other categories above are 
 simple, and justify their spread.  Some Solomani games that should 
 qualify, since it is actually possible to teach them to someone 
 that doesn\'t speak your language, would be MasterMind, Backgammon, 
 Parchisi, Go, Go-Moku, Checkers, Al-Qirks, War (the card game), 
 ... I\'m sure you get the idea.

 I guess what I\'m saying is that you shouldn\'t depend on what comes 
 from "official" sources - it\'s not reasonable to expect GDW to 
 come up with _everything_, and it\'s not possible for them to do 
 it.  Come up with your own, and share them here.  _I_ think that 
 that would be more fun...

 (Hmm... Maybe I have a few more RICE Papers cooking here...)

Hi Rob,

You might be thinking of my article and rules which were published 
as a supplement to the fanzine Starport, circa late 1991. In 
Starport 16 of that year, Kevin Parry wrote: *Grav Ball - This has 
been sent to Rob Prior and David Schneider [so] Nick Law can 
legitimately say that it is being played on three continents....*  

If you like, I could mail it to you (or anyone else who would like 
a copy) although it might be a rather large file, especially as 
the counters and board were done on Excel spreadsheets; that is 
assuming I could find it all  -- I haven\'t seen that floppy disk 
for quite a while...

In Challenge 49, Mike Mikesh, in his article on the Julian 
Protectorate mentions three sports: kuspar, floater and saliball. 
After reading Mike\'s article, I devised rules for one of them, 
that had elements of baseball, sumo and real tennis, as well as 
formalised Vargr infighting. Again, this is stuff from a long time 
ago, but if you want, I can dredge it up from the deep.

Merry Chistmas,
Nick Law

Striker II is out, just picked it up a few hours ago (at Compleat
Strategist, for certain parties interested in that tidbit).

Here\'s the RQL (Really Quick Look):

The system is based on GDW\'s COMMAND DECISION rules,
which I\'m not familiar with but have heard good things about.

Sections are:
Basic rules, which didn\'t seem confusing in my quick read-through
                   (failure on this point tends to be a bad sign ;-);
Advanced Rules, weather, artillery, EW, psionics, engineering, and such.
                   Must say I like the drop capsule scatter rules: take paper
                   chits, raise them a given level above the playing surface,
                   and drop them.  I remember another game with this kind
                   of scatter system (oh yeah...CAR WARS explosion debris
                    scattering).  It may seem silly by just reading it, but in
                   practice it works fine.
Campaign Rules, considerations off the battlefeild
Scenarios: Four of them: one in the Empire of Solee (a pocket empire
                   coreward of the RC);  the often mentioned Dawn League
                   action on Veniza by DLS Ashtabula;  Fifth Frontier
                   War ground action on Efate, complete with Zho commandos
                   and the 4518th Lift Infantry Regiment ("Duke of Regina\'s Own
                   Huscarles")!; and finally, back to the RC for a drop assault
                   dated 1202.
Other Stuff: Equipment and organizational charts to build your own
                   forces, quick reference charts, two pages of FF&S
                   design sequence clarifications and upgrades that have
                   direct bearing on Striker II.

Oh, and lest I forget to mention it, 

********************************************************************************

********************************************************************************
HIGH ENERGY WEAPONS HAVE HAD A MAJOR DESIGN
CHANGE/UPGRADE TO BOOST THEIR EFFECTIVENESS!!!!

*******************************************************************************

*******************************************************************************
Yes, all that (reasoned) complaining paid off.

The cartridges are half the size, range is roughly three times improved,
and damage more than doubled.

Question for Loren: can people who do not intend to buy Striker II
get the design sequence upgrade pages seperately?  Twenty bucks
is a bit hefty for two pages.

With difficulty, (I\'ve tried).
I think robot design rules (which would probably cover cyberware too) are
due to appear in _Vampire Fleets_, (hopefully released in February).

A full set of rules for G-Ball was published as a 14 page supplement with
an issue of Signal GK ( I can\'t find out which one ). The rules and
related discussion document on the place of G-Ball in the Imperium were
also put into the HIWG archive as 176_01 and 176_02, both by Nick Law
in Aug 91.

If you can\'t get hold of the documents I can provide paper copies of
them.

Great News!!  As soon as I get my next paycheck I\'m getting it.
Whether it was our complaining or GDW\'s own realization the plasma gun 
and fusion gun are BACK!!!

Strike fear into the hearts of those who oppose your well equipped PC or 
NPC forces with the thundercrack and ligthning bolt of plasma.

Just like I always said...I can accept a plasma/fusion gun to very 
expensive and to have a relatively high attenuation but they should be 
absolutley bleeping devastating at short range with portable cartridges.
I look forward to picking it up.  Striker II that is.  I can begin 
posting forces and scenarios and designing vehicles etc.

Absolutely. I screwed up when someone asked about licenses,...I meant to
say that the licenses for the old MegaTraveller games have expired.
Planet III is doing fine.

"Putting the Heat back into Plasma"

One of the most consistent requests we receive with respect to the 
equipment in Traveller(R)the New Era is to increase the effectiveness
of high energy weapons. Although we\'re reluctant to tinker with design
sequences and published equipment, the pressure for tougher fusion and
plasma rifles has been almost irresistable.

Never let it be said we don\'t listen to customers. In fact, the 
well-known third law of retail sales is "Always listen to your Customers."
(The first law is "Never kill a customer." The second law is "You
break it, your buy it.") So we took a good look at man-portable high 
energy weapons and concluded that, although they weren\'t as good as 
grenade launchers, at least they were real expensive. Hmmm.
Perhaps, we decided, there was something to all those annoying
complaints after all. The following modifications refer to pages in the
Fire, Fusion, and Steel high energy weapon design sequences.

..

Thought you all might be interested... The changes look pretty good, although
I have had much of a chance to really disect it to see how effective it 
makes things.
