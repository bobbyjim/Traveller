    'body' => '   Hi.

   I bought M0 last week and have read about a quarter of it, but I
   thought I\'d go ahead with a premature review.

   IMHO, this is the best SINGLE campaign resource for Traveller since
   "The Traveller Adventure", and maybe the best ever. Every page is
   chock full of adventures, rumors, and seeds for the enigmas, gimmicks
   and patrons that every campaign needs to be fun. An amazing amount of
   creativity went into every paragraph of this sourcebook, my
   compliments to the authors!

   Every Traveller referee will find too much campaign grist for his
   mill possibly use all of it. Whether you want to portray Cleon as a
   great spiritual leader in a culteral revival, or as the worst serial
   killer on Sylea, you\'ll find information to support your campaign
   direction in M0. Whether you want your characters pushing the
   boundaries of known space or engaging in trade wars on Sylea, you\'ll
   find adventure layouts in M0. Whether you want your focus to be
   military adventures in hostile territory or romance and intrigue in a
   provincial palace, you\'ll find characters and situations to fit your
   bill in M0.

   Quite simply, the scope of this book blows me away. I compared it to
   "The Traveller Adventure"; Kenneth compared it to the SOM; both
   comparisons, though, are quite weak. Trav has never seen anything
   quite like this before.

   FLAWS: The previous reviewers mentioned that this book had flaws, but
   they only scratched the surface. M0 is filled with flaws, so many
   flaws that it will be almost useless as a source for canon. (It is
   too self-contradictory or just plain silly in some respects to make
   for good canon.) But as a source for IDEAS, for prods to a referee\'s
   writers-blocked mind, for adventure situations and characters, these
   flaws do not make M0 a bad buy. It\'s THAT good.

   The flaws come in three types:

   1) Typos. Too many to mention, no page in M0 is free of them. If this
   book was edited, the editor\'s copy never reached the printers.

   2) Inconsistency. As has been previously noted, the map and the text
   do not agree. Either the map must be altered to fit the text (my
   suggestion), or the text must be altered to fit the map.

   3) Silly ideas. In a book with so many imaginative ideas, some
   fraction of them are bound to be stupid or silly. Fortunately, these
   ideas are easy to ignore. The rumors section is particularly cursed
   with silly ideas; on the other hand, it is also particularly blessed
   with good ones.

   I won\'t go into detail about which ideas are the silly ones, because
   different people will have different opinions about which ones are
   silly or useless. Also, if you are running a comedic campaign, some
   of the stupidest ideas will be the real gems for you. (If the
   "Murphy\'s Rules" column is still in existence, it has some real
   fodder in this sourcebook. 8^)

   Conclusion: This is a great book. Each referee will have to make some
   decisions about which parts of it to ignore, but there\'ll still be
   plenty of good stuff left over when he\'s done.

   P.S. M0 is a book that screams to be annotated. If you don\'t mind
   marking up your books (I normally do, but I\'ll make an exception in
   this case), then M0 will be more usefull to you than it might be
   otherwise.

I was talking about find the GDW Alien Modules in my post.  I haven\'t 
seen the DGP modules since I bought mine way back when they came out.

As far as the quality of the Alien Modules, I\'ve liked them all.

The GDW CT ones are great.  The DGP MT ones were are even better. 
 
The TNE one?  I\'ve got it, but I haven\'t used it.  I bought what I 
could of TNE, but I just didn\'t like the game.  I haven\'t 
incorporated Hivers into my campaign yet, so I haven\'t paid much 
attention to it.  I bought it within the last year, and it has just 
been sitting there.  

I expect I\'ll look at it in more depth when I get around to exposing 
my players to the Hive.

If you have additional questions about it, e-mail me in private.  
I\'ll do what I can to look through the book for you and explain 
what\'s in it.

Kenneth.

    'body' => 'A few weeks ago, Marc indicated to the list that he was not happy 
with the T4 task system.  This sparked off the task system debate.

Marc wanted to, like many of us, get rid of the 1/2 die as a 
difficulty dice code.  I couldn\'t agree more.  I\'ve never liked the 
half die.  KBv1.1 used them because the T4 system uses them, and I 
wanted KBv1.1 to be as close to the original system as possible and 
still fix the two problems it has.

Marc\'s tinkering with the task system told me that the door was open 
to tinker with an improved version of KBv1.1.  Although the system 
give some good numbers and fixes the problem of high attributed 
characters dominating the game (when another character has much more 
skill than the high attributed character), KBv1.1 still has some 
problems.

These problems are small in my book, but as long as a revised edition 
of T4 is being written, we might as well fix these two little 
problems as well.

What are the problems with KBv1.1?  First, it uses the half die, 
albeit in only two categories--Easy and Difficult.  Everybody, it 
seems, would rather get rid of these pesky little dice.

The second problem with KBv1.1 is the awkward math.  Many people 
don\'t find it a problem to halve something, double something, and add 
those two values together, but as some have said, this is bothersome, 
especially in the middle of combat when a character\'s stats go down 
and the target number has to be refigured.

Although I\'m willing to live with these two small problems in order 
to gain the benefits that KBv1.1 has instituted in my game, if there 
was a way to eliminate these problems and still have the numbers that 
KBv1.1 gives us, I\'d be all for it.

That was my goal in designing KBv2.0.  I wanted a system that would:

	* Eliminate the half die--only use whole dice as difficulty codes.

	* Require only simple addition, like the T4 system, during combat.

	* Provide the adjusted numbers that KBv1.1 gives us (i.e. fix the 
	problem in the T4 system where the higher difficulties are too easy 
	to hit).

	* Provide, like KBv1.1 does, a benefit to having high level skill 
	(the old Pilot-1/Dex-10 vs Pilot-4/Dex-6 so-who-should-fly-the-ship 
	problem)

These are some lofty goals, and, I can tell you, that this has not 
been easy to achieve.  I\'ve played around with several ideas in the 
last couple of weeks.  It\'s required a lot of thought, number 
crunching, and testing.

But, I think that I\'ve licked the problem and accomplished all of 
these goals.

I introduce to you...

				KBv2.0

As with all of my rule fixes, I try to keep game mechanics as simple 
as possible while still providing the desired result.  KBv2.0 is no 
different.  

KBv2.0 consists of only two changes to the T4 rules.  One is a change 
in the difficutly codes, the other is a change in the way target 
numbers are calculated.  Simple, simple, simple.



1)  THE DIFFICULTY CODES:

Change the difficutly codes to match these.  Notice that I am only 
using whole dice--no more half die!

	Easy:  		2D/Auto
	Average:		3D
	Difficult:		4D
	Formidable:	5D
	Staggering:		6D
	Impossible:	7D



2)  TARGET NUMBER:

Calculating the number in combat is as simple, like T4, as adding two 
number together.  

There is a peliminary step that is necessary to increase the impact 
skills have on the target number.  This should be done only once and 
written on the character\'s page next to his skill--say in the area 
that you record the governing attributes for each skill the character 
has.  This will not need to be calculated again unless the 
character\'s skill increases.

	Preliminary step.

	Multiply all skill levels by 3.  Record this number next to the 
	skill on the character\'s sheet.  This new number will be referred to 
	as the character\'s experience score or number.

The experience score is used as a base number when determining the 
target number for a task.  Since skills are not effected by combat, 
this number will never change.  The only way it can change is if the 
character goes up in skill level.  If that happens, you simply 
repeat the preliminary step.



TARGET NUMBER CALCULATION:	

A character\'s target number is calculated by adding the experience 
score to the character\'s governing characteristic for that skill.

	Experience + Attribute = Target Number

It\'s as simple as that.  You\'ve already calculated the character\'s 
experience score, so the target number is a simple matter of adding 
this number to the attribute--just like in T4.

As the character\'s attributes goes down due to wounds, it is a simple 
matter to recalculate the target number.



SUMMARY:

And that\'s all there is to KBv2.0--just two changes.  Change the dice 
codes for the difficulty categories and change the target number 
calculation to the sum of experience and attrubute.

I still have to figure out a few periphial issues, like how to 
calculate SS and SF based on this system, but the basics are solid.  
I\'ve done extensive number crunching to ensure that the percentages 
come out close to the way they did under KBv1.1. 

I used KBv1.1 as the model instead of the T4 system becuase KBv1.1 
solved a basic problem in T4--the high percentages of success on the 
high end of the difficulty scale.

I\'m not going to list a lot of numbers here.  I will be doing that 
later as I\'m sure that I am going to have to defend KBv2.0 to some of 
you before it is accepted.

What I\'m interested in here is to see if all of you are comfortable 
with the mechanics involved with KBv2.0.  It\'s simple addition, but 
you never know.  I can guarrantee that somebody here on the TML will 
have a problem with it even though it solves all problems.

For comparison purposes, though, here\'s a somewhat average character 
and the numbers he would generate under both systems.

	Plain Jane
	Stat-7
	Skill-2

				KBv1.1 (TN 8)			KBv2.0 (TN 13)
Easy					94.44%				100%
Average				72.22%				82.41%
Difficult				42.59%				44.37%
Formidable				25.93%				15.2%
Staggering				  5.4%				  3.59%
Impossible	 			  0.72%				  0.62%


You couldn\'t ask for better numbers than that--especially when you 
are dealing with 6 sided dice.  The KBv2.0 system is more generous at 
the low end and less forgiving at the high end, but I kinda like this 
shift.  It makes Average skills a little easier with the trade 
off being that Staggering tasks are a little harder.  I have no 
problem with that at all.

OK, hit me with your comments!

Kenneth.

Fireworks are not always bad.  Whenever you have a group of 
opinionated people together talking, you get disagreements.

Heck, whenever you have a group of people together--strike the 
opinionated part--talking, you get disagreements.

That\'s what this list is all about, isn\'t it--to discuss differing 
views of Traveller in all its forms?  

When I get into a disagreement with someone here on the list, there 
is one of two outcomes for me.  We agree in the end or we disagree.

I\'ve gone into some very strong debates with the intention of 
changing the other guy\'s mind--and I got my mind changed.

I always try to keep an open mind to what the other person is saying. 
 My opinion is not always the best one.  And that\'s why I\'m here--to 
share ideas with fellow people who like Traveller.

I guess I\'m saying all this because it seems, from your post, that 
you are afraid of offending somebody here on the list.

I\'m not advocating belligerency, mind you, but you should state 
what you think.  

One thing that is true here on the TML--no matter how many people 
agree with you, there are always those who don\'t.

But, that\'s not a negative to the TML.  It is one of the good things.

    'body' => 'In the T4 rulebook, it mentioned that someone using Fencing would have an
advantage over someone using Blade Combat (or, presumably, Melee Combat 
as well).  In reality -- or, at least, in the Society of Creative
Anachronism (SCA) -- a fencer has a major *dis*advantage against other
fighters: *shields*!

In reality, someone using sword-and-shield (or weapon-and-shield) will
kick ass against an equally skilled opponent using just a sword; he will
usually score well against a moderately better opponent.  

I have yet to see *any* version of Traveller which takes this into
account.  Another disadvantage to the fencer is the relative strength of
the blades.  Consider the following example:

Sir Fop: "I parry your clumsy slash!"  

<SFX: broadsword shatters sabre>

Thonk the Uncivilized: "<grin>... <slash!><slash!><slash!>... Are you dead
yet?"

Sir Nebbish: "I say, that\'s not terribly sporting of you."

Thonk: "<shield-punch>... If you hurry, the dentist can salvage most of
those teeth I just knocked out."

The only real disadvantage for someone using a shield is the fact that he
can\'t see through it.  When he uses it to block an upper strike, he\'s
momentarily blind (to his opponent).  But, in a SFRPG, a star-faring
barbarian can have a shield crafted from a transparent metal or
high-strength ceramic to get around this.  To be even more clever, he
could have it coated to be one-way transparent (I can see you, but you
can\'t see me...).  

The main reason I even mention this is because of the "history" of
barbarian PCs and NPCs in my campaign; many of them worked as bodyguards
and professional champions for their patrons.  Which leads me to my last
point.  

In T4, mention is made of the nobles\' /code duello/.  If a noble were in a
situation where he was incapable of defending himself, he would need the
services of a champion.  Thus, I postulate that the Imperial (nee Sylean)
Marines are the historical descendents of the nobles\' /huscarles/, their
fighting men on retainer, and that they have traditionally been used as
champions for indisposed nobles.  This gives an elegant explanation for
the automatic skill Long Blade-1 that is in keeping with the background
presented in T4.  

Rebuttals?  Agreements?  Suggestions?

I liked the TNE Hiver&Ithklur book.  It presented an interesting view of the

just saying Hivers are one way or the other.  This works well with the

The Ithklur are the part that most people hated.  The Ithklur write up
involves many 20th Century jokes.  It says the Ithklur play Calvin-Ball.
Personally I dislike the use of 20th century references. But one of my 
players loves it and she is quite happy playing an Ithklur.  

I think you can just ignore all the jokes and 20th century refernces and
be left with a very interesting alien race.  

Some of the things that were standard in the CT modules, aren\'t in the TNE
module. There are no examples of alien ships.  There isn\'t a sector of the
Hive Federation.(Actually there wasn\'t one in the CT module either)
Dave Nielson gave his reasons for these and I can see his points.  

I\'d recomend buying the book if you want more on the hivers.  Just beware of the
jokes in the Ithklur.

I\'m currently tweaking a couple of snub pistol designs using 3G3.. when
their done, I\'ll post them to my weapons pages:

Well, don\'t mess with the Marines comes to mind...  Seroiously, BD is
supposed to be the ultimate expression of military technology.  You just
aren\'t going to do much to a Marine in BattleDress unless you have some
access to militarygrade firepower yourself.

You could try for a Spectaular Sucess, and say you were aiming for a joint
or visor, but I\'d recommend against that, since while your shooting at him,
he\'s shooting at you, and he doesn\'t need a SS to kill you.

There is always Arameth Gridlore\'s suggestion:  "Wait until he takes off his
helmet, and brain him with a rock!"

My problem is that I\'m a planet-head.  Some people tinker with starships, I
tinkers with ecosystems.

All of the above solutions are nice, but they still don\'t avoid the fact
that a world orbiting a very dim, cool star is supposedly producing enough
Agricultural products to make them the planet\'s primary export.

What I\'m really bitching about is that Traveller has always assaigned
stellar types at random.  It becomes very hard to explain a world with a
population in the tens of billions orbiting a nightmare like a type-A star,
or the above Ag world orbiting something one step ahead of stellar extinction.

So now I have to go through FS and fix the stars, fix the planets that had
been a threat to the Sylean Federation, fix Vland, and use the maps that Joe
kindly posted (thanks Joe!) to figure out where the Imperium actually is in
Year 30 or so.  For this I paid ~20 bucks?

I am almost tempted to just chuck it all and start designing Fornast Sector
exclusively.  While FS does a lot of the work for me, it leaves so much to
be desired.  Personaly, I\'m happy that M:200 has been delayed.  I\'d really
like to see M:200 become the first release of 1998, with 1997 devoted
exclusively to M:0 support in JTAS, adventures, etc.

Of course, any one world, no matter how exotic or improbable its UPP and
stellar type, can be hand-waved into semi-credibility.  I think what
people (including myself) are objecting to is that (throughout the history
of Traveller) a good quarter or more of all worlds end up in this
category.  This rather strains the suspension of disbelief.

Most small cold worlds are going to be airless or at least have
unbreathable atmospheres (Titan is an example of the latter case).  Most
very hot worlds are going to be airless or at least have unbreathable
atmospheres (Mercury and Venus, respectively).  As I\'ll be discussing
tomorrow night, an N2/O2 atmosphere (codes 2-9) is *very* unstable;
without some mechanism to continuously replenish it, the O2 disappears in
a geological instant.  The only mechanism we currently know of (in theory
as well as in practice) that can maintain a breathable atmosphere is a
biosphere operating on the carbon/liquid-water/oxygen model; and that
model severely restricts the temperature range in which you\'ll get
breathable atmospheres.

The occasional \'special case\' world adds spice to a setting; if too many
worlds require special pleading, it becomes a bit comical.

    'body' => 'A few years ago, I called Steve Jackson Games\' old Illuminati BBS and
happened upon a text file called "Real Men, Real Roleplayers, Loonies
and Munchkins" which described all gamers as belonging to one of these
four groups, and detailed the various game behavior of each.

This wonderful document is available on the Web at: 

http://www-cui.darnstadt.gmd.de/~stenger/Personal/Rpg/Munchkin/

Included therein were behaviors in specific games -- GURPS, AD&D,
Villans and Vigilantes, Fantasy Hero, Champions, World of Darkness, etc
- -- and for specific genres -- fantasy, science fiction, superheroes,
etc. 

Ob Traveller: However, there are no entries for Traveller, a game that
is every bit as venerable as AD&D.... I think it\'s time to end this
sorry state of affairs and give Our Favorite Game the Real Men...
treatment.

To set the tone, here\'s my contribution:

General Opinion:

Real Men: Traveller is what Star Wars should have been, but isn\'t.
Real Roleplayers: Traveller is what reality should be, but isn\'t.
Loonies: Traveller is too serious for loonies.
Munchlins: Cool weapons and psionic powers, but the law level gets in
the way....


Favorite Character:

Real Men play Aslan mercenaries.
Real Roleplayers play Human Traders.
Loonies play Hiver Entertainers, Zhodani Rogues or chainsaw duellists.
Munchkins play psionic Ithklur Marines or Virus-infected Hiver Warbots;
whatever gets the most plusses.


Favorite Traveller Adventure/Product (CT)
Real Men: Mercenary (Book 4)
Real Roleplayers: Twilight\'s Peak
Loonies: "Chainsaw Combat In Traveller" (Space Gamer article)
Munchkins: SORAG (for the grossities)


Favorite Traveller character generation system:

Real Men like CT 
Real Roleplayers like MT
Loonies like TNE (for all the insane character mixes)
Munchkins like T4 for all the skill plusses

Criticisms, additions and other effluvia welcome!!

No one should be intimidated about posting TNE stuff.  I have posted numerous
TNE style posts to the TML, and no one has given me grief.  These have included
Ships in Fire Fusion & Steel, world write ups for the Refomration Coalition,
NPC write ups, and rules.  

A few people get upset about Virus, and we probably don\'t need another argument
about the viability of Virus.  But useful Virus NPCs or Virus organizations
would be really neat.  

I think the reason there is so little traffic on the TNE-RCES mailing list
is that people discuss things here.  That is where I prefer them personally.
All my Traveller in one big package.  :)  

So Chris, PLEASE post your stuff hear, I\'d love to read it and I am sure
others would too, and even if people don\'t use TNE rules, they can steal
ideas from your posts.

  and the site is on-line.  The second pass will be based on
  feedback received from those who visit the site.  There are
  some things missing:

        1.      Links to other pages - I\'m working on this; my
                intent is to put up links after (a) they\'ve been
                verified as working, and (b) they\'re verified as
                Traveller links.  If you know of links that
                aren\'t on the page, feel free to let me know
                about them - I\'ll check \'em out and add them as
                appropriate.

        2.      Reviews.  I\'ve only got the original T4 review;
                I need more.  I\'ll accept nonpositive reviews
                that avoid the use of emotionally loaded terms
                like "waste of money".  Say, rather, that "there
                is a strong indication that the asking price
                could be put to better use" or something like
                that - you know, the same kind of obfuscation
                that politicians do on a daily basis.  The
                reason for the change in heart has to do with
                one word - "resource".  The dictionary doesn\'t
                say anything about it being a synonym for
                "cheering section"; I\'d rather have honest but
                polite comments about shortcomings than lose
                credibility by only publishing rah-rah.

                Consider this an official call for reviews of
                all published Traveller products (T4) to date,
                including JTAS 25, but excluding T4 itself,
                which I already have a review for.

  I\'m also not perfectly satisfied with the feedback and Q&A
  pages.  If someone knows where I can get a perl-4 or shell
  script that can take the form and sendmail it to me,
  appropriately massaged, I will be very appreciative.  I\'m told
  that the Dragonfire server is a Pentium running Linux.  A set
  of man pages for sendmail would be acceptable; I\'m a good
  enough programmer to be able to do something with that.

  SUBMISSIONS!  I NEED SUBMISSIONS!  I don\'t pull stuff off the
  list because it generally takes several digests to get the
  whole thing, and I have a bad habit of losing files
  (organization on my part, not technical deficiencies - I
  refuse to tolerate those).  Not to mention that list stuff
  needs a lot of editing, and that means you have to review it.
  I also don\'t know how you feel about having me lift the stuff.
  On the rare occasions that I _do_ lift the stuff, I also write
  and ask permission. But it\'s lots better if you tell me "here,
  you can have this for FT". Remember, FT doesn\'t have or want
  exclusivity or final publication control.

What I\'d like to see is a set of charts, one for each difficulty,
of skill vs attribute showing % success.

A suggestion for SS/SF: When the number of 6\'s rolled exceeds the
number of 1\'s rolled by 2, Spectacular Failure.  When the number 
of 1\'s folled exceeds the number of 6\'s by the ordinal of the
task level (1 for easy, 2 for average, 3 for difficult, etc...)
Spectacular Success!

IMHO My reading is of the rule does not suggest it is broken in the way
you suggest.

I read thus
1. No weapon does more than 3D damage to a Human. (its a *big game* gun
after all)

2. Thus 6D reduces to 3D for a human target.

3. The unarmoured target takes the full 3D

4a. For a diplo armoured target 3D converts to 3 points damage (1 for
each die stopped but; blunt trauma)

4b. For a rigid armoured target - No damage

Here is where I lose my way a bit: What is the point of rigid armour
with an AV greater than 3 (excepting shotguns etc) if AV3 instantly
deflects all projectiles without harm to the wearer.

OK your shot!

Last I heard, the shuttle barely hits 6 G, and for less than 1 minute...

I KNOW FROM EXPERIENCE AND FLIGHT SCHOOL that the AVERAGE private pilot
will frequently do sustained 2 and 3 G turns, and that 4 G turns are no
problem (tight circles, on the 20 second range, in a Cessna, generate over
3 G) for short periods.

Jet Fighters can generate upwards of 12 G transient loads, but most wings
are designed for 10-11 G loading. Most military pilots are required to
function at 6 G\'s for short periods (transient loads). G-suits are standard
issue for jet-jockeys, but aren\'t needed for 6-G transient loads (T-33
orientation rides for CAP cadets pull 5-6 G maneuvers, and do NOT issue
G-suits).

Apollo-Saturn V missions generated 11 G for 5 minutes, without G-Suits.
Nobody could move, but nobody AFAIK passed out.

   This is a very clever and refined alternative to my somewhat
   unimaginative and brutal explanation for the Marine cutlass, which I
   posted here last year. My explanation was that the Marine cutlass was
   used for the same purposes for which the Japanese saber was used in
   WW2: the slaughter of prisoners and the discipline of troops
   (particularly mutinous navy crewmen in the Imperium, not Japan). I
   suppose these two alternatives can be used against each other or
   together, reflecting the referee\'s view of the Good/Evil Imperium.

Notes:  The Special Level used the same assumptions as the Standard Level
(See Below) only included a Broker/Trader as a crew member and worked with
a base of 9 passenger staterooms.  It is very plain to see how a 
Broker/Trader in the crew can make a difference between profit and 
bankruptcy. All figures represent one year of operation

Role-Play Off:

I did this as an example of what I was referring to for the THUDDD
economic considerations.  I think the Broker/Trader additional rules 
help make it more easy to judge the ships economic performance.

A few other notes.  I used the QSDS rules for the command crew and 
therefore one was required.  I also counted the Electronics crew as a 
sensor operator since that is what he will be doing.

Well, I guess that\'s it for now.  Any Questions?

<IMHO>
It is fairly well written, BUT IS NOT COMPATABLE WITH the older Hiver\'s Module.
As for the second half, The Ithklur seem to have been done after too much
Black Adder, Monty Python, and LSD... They seem to be done for humor value
only.

This Ithklur problem is most annoying to me because, for the most viscious
race known, having them running around in "San*klas" (the * is pronounced
as a \'ti\' click) hats, red, with white brinm and pompom, simply destroys
any verisimilitude for me. And my player group. Peter Newman seems to be
the sole "Ithklur Apologist" I know.

Back to Hivers: My players sat down, and found 17 direct contradictions
between the CT AM:Hivers and the TNE AM1:H&I about hivers alone. Ithklur
are merely a name under CT. There is enough to get a frim grip on hivers
under H&I, and enough for PC\'s, but they are subtly different from the race
of the same name under CT, including some biological data.

This constitutes an OPINION. I did not feel that you were attacking me, and
I can understand your opinion. I guess when I said \'simplicity\' I was
comparing T4 to TNE and to other games. I do feel that the game overall is
simple. yes, it has bugs and these are being worked out. But the fact that
so many people have ADDED to the rules to fill in those areas that they felt
were lacking shows that it is somewhat simple :) The problem with the task
system may in fact be that it is not detailed enough :)

I have a good friend named David A. Nelson who used to post ship designs
here frquently. he has all but stopped posting and is considering
unsubscribing because he feels that his preference for TNE will not be
tolerated.

Consider for a moment what a Marine has to learn in his training.  how to
operate Battle Dress, the maitence and use of weapons ranging from the Gauss
Rifle, to plasma weapons, up to tac missles.  How to sucessfully make a
meterotic re-entry, both in a drop capsule and using a re-entry kit.
Traditions and Regulations of the Naval Serivice.  I hardly think there
would be *time* to teach swordplay!

The Imperial Marines are the Imperium\'s "ugly solution."  Rather than a
smooth talking diplomat, or a 90,000 ton battleship making a quiet point by
just orbiting your world, when the Marines show up, the party is OVER. 

It seems that given the name, the IM are in fact the decendants of the
Solomani Marines, who are in turn the inheretors of the legacy of the USMC
and the Royal Marines.

I don\'t doubt that professional duelists would appear, I just don\'t think
the military establishment would look kindly on a noble who picked fights
and then sent young Marines to cover for him.

For a good look at how a dueling code and professional duelists might work,
read "Field of Dishonor" by David Weber, one of the Honor Harrington novels.

No, 6 damage - 3 armor = 3d damage done to the target.  the arguement is
wether the 3 dice stooped by the armor convert to blunt damage (I say no,

The reduction to 3d is done only after armor is applied.. thusly, a weapon
with a damge of 6, vs armour 2, would do 4d damage, reduced to 3d because of
blow-through.

        G-suited fighter pilots, with proper "g-straining" maneuvers, can
endure 9+G turns, while tracking hostile targets and figuring out how to get
at them, but those only last a few seconds. The shuttle crew goes through
about a minute and a half at around 3-4G, if memory serves. And volunteers
experienced more than either during rocket sled testing. \'Course, they

        Well, two comments on this:

        1. There\'s a TNE-RCES mailing list out there already, although
there\'s currently not much traffic on it.

        2. I REALLY hate the idea of splitting the TML again. Frankly, if
there are pinheads out there who will wet their pants because I happen to
discuss something in which they\'re not interested, let them wet their pants.
You don\'t hear CT-era campaigners griping about the Milieu 0 stuff, nor MT
campaigners whining about people\'s custom campaigns, nor the M0 folks
bitching about MT. Face it, folks, there\'s a wide variety of tastes out
there. I won\'t go into why I like TNE mechanics here, or how I, as a CS
master\'s student and working Air Force engineer came to grips with Virus, or
the idiocy of claiming TNE is any more violent than any other incarnation.
But if you close off a line of discussion because of your own narrowminded
preconceptions, well, I won\'t miss you.

        Can\'t we all just get along?

All excellent examples for use in Vehicle combat.  So we could expect 
overloaded Grav bikes...  However, none of these examples is even close 
to the time frame for Starship combat.  Starship combat turns are 20 or
30 MINUTES depending on whose system you use.  So a short combat lasts 
a couple of hours.  So 5G uncompensated can\'t be used during combat,
they couldn\'t act to attack, defend, or maneuver.  Locking in a pattern 
for a full half hour would IMO be stupid.  So what\'s the highest G
that people can stand for a full half hour and 1) be able to move 
effectively and 2) react quickly?

For some reason, issues of what system you use result in an inordinate
amount of flaming around here. You should have seen the CT/MTers go against
the TNEers about a year ago!

I commend you for the above and wholeheartedly agree.

No, that\'s not it. It\'s just that not much comes of the sort of conflict
we\'re discussing here. Usually ends up in an \'agreement to disagree.\' Or
resentment.

>I\'m not advocating belligerency, mind you, but you should state
>what you think.

What I think is one thing. The system I\'m using is another. Some folks
wouldn\'t like me taking up bandwidth with TNE stuff when they\'re more into
T4 and vice versa.

But as far as stating what I think, I\'m more than willing.

While on the subject, I will say that I think reverting to the CT rules as
the basis for a new game was a big mistake. TNE\'s mechanics are simply the
best, most realistic I\'ve ever come across. And the task system is par
excellence. It functions great and is only marginally more difficult to
learn and use than that of MT. And the results are far more realistic
roleplaying.

TNE\'s problem was the poor background material. The setting was unpopular,
a fact that never seemed to register with the game\'s authors.
Unfortunately, dislike of the setting sullied peoples\' opinions of the
entire game. Sort of like throwing the baby out with the bathwater.

I didn\'t like the RCES setting either, so I conducted a Regency campaign.

I\'ve been playing the game since 1980, so I played CT and thought it was
fine for the time. But having then played MT and TNE extensively (and I
mean EXTENSIVELY; not just a couple of times but for literally hundreds of
sessions), I found that over the years I matured as an RPGer and so did the
mechanics. Folks complained about the complexity of TNE, but I\'m no
gearhead and I didn\'t have a difficult time with the transition.

I considered shifting to T4, but after the five players I referee (not a
single one of them an engineer or scientist, mind you!) got hold of the new
rules, they gasped and threatened to lynch me if I forced it upon them. By
the time I had finished reading the rules, which suffered from an obvious
lack of playtesting or even a proper amount of thoughtful consideration, I
agreed with them.

>One thing that is true here on the TML--no matter how many people
>agree with you, there are always those who don\'t.

Or anywhere for that matter.

>But, that\'s not a negative to the TML.  It is one of the good things.

Only when it doesn\'t come down to outright flaming.

Not only am I (well I *was*) a sabre fencer, but I also used to routinely

</disclaimer>

First problem: Assuming Imperial standard armament development akin to what
we have in the 20th century, show me the unit that routinely kits its
troopers with shields in anything more than archaic full dress. I submit
that they don\'t. Shields are big, unweildy, and and detract from the amount
of ammunition or the weapons you can carry.

Second problem: Shields are a good equalizer, but no one is going to take on
a barbarian with long blade and shield if he has a pistol or small arm at
hand. If he *doesn\'t* have a firearm at hand, the fencer can *still* paste
the barbarian, by applying the advantage that fencing gives you, namely
speed and distance. The barbarian is always trying to get up close to you.
All you need to do is keep him at a distance.

While I will submit that hitting someone at the exteme range of your blade
makes for shallow and usually non-life threatening wounds, they hurt like
hell, throw off your opponents attacks, and hinder his movement. That is
usually good enough to allow for an opening to either escape or to do some
*real* damage once the opposing blade is taken care of.

Completely untrue. Your barbarian with his 7kg sword is swinging it a *lot*
slower than me with my 2.5 kilo sabre. As he swings, I slice the tendons in
his arm, he drops his heavy and now useless weapon and has to hide behind
his sheild.

I can now stand well out of the way of any clumsy shield punch (which is
most often an untrained desperation maneuver) and cut the leg tendons, the
head, or anyplace else that the shield can\'t cover. Also, my sabre moves a
hell of a lot faster than his shield, which means I can feint him out of his
shorts and hit anyplace I really choose.

With proper distance (which is the best parry) you needn\'t worry about this.
However, with modern alloys your example is still not valid, unless the
steel in the sabre is too brittle. A modern composite blade (akin to Toledo
steel) won\'t shatter like you suggest.

Again, this is irrelevant given the speed of my attack with the sabre. Your
star-faring barbarian and his nifty shield are still going to assume that I
am committed to one attack, when really I am waiting for my true target. In
fact if you can see me through your shield you might be at a disadvantage,
because you are convinced that there is *no way* I could alter my attack.

The Marines are far more than the descendents of your Imperial Noble\'s
lackeys. They were a corps of free men, trained and devoted to the service
of a government. The Marines are a unit, with esprit, not merely a
collection of professional bodyguards. The reason that they still train with
the cutlass is two-fold:

1) Tradition from ancient wet ship boarding actions.

2) It is still useful to use a long blade in Spaceship combat, because if
you crack a suit, you generally kill your man. However, to this end, light
strong blades are preferred to avoid rotational/angular momentum problems
with a huge windup from a heavy blade. Also you don\'t need to kill the man
*in* the suit with your blow...you just need to pop it, or slice a hose, or
open a wide gash in the fabric. Hence the sport fencing idea of *any hit is
a kill* holds literally.

At least that\'s my take on it Franklin... :)

I have seen estimates at 90% casualties. The Central American (spanish contacted) Indians 
numbered around 20 million, the north american (british and french contacted (primarily)) 
numbered an estimated 3-6 million. This IS one of the reasons there are more natives left in 
the southern areas. BTW, the Europeans did not initially know that they were the vector of 
the disease.

I always saw the Vargr as being like the plains Indians. In the beginning they could kick the 
merry hell out of the humans (read: europeans) but as the better organized humans gained 
strength, all the bravery and wishes of the vargr could save them from the flat face 
onslaught. The vargr are called raiders, and worse. But they were there first.

	In Terran history, there\'s a very good reason why shields and most
personal armour went the way of the dodo several TL\'s ago, and why swords
evolved (yes, I say, evolved) into cav sabres & rapiers.  It\'s very simple;
the armour of the time was useless against firearms.

	After gunpowder made shields, chainmail, plate, and so forth pretty
much useless on the battlefield at approximately TL-1 or 2 (since they
didn\'t affect your odds of getting wounded when shot any and just slowed
you down), the need for bloody great big phallic substit.., er, armour
cracking swords disappeared.  Therefore, Sir Lug with his big, utterly
lethal, and terribly slow two-handed sword suffered a massive disadvantage
when going up against Sir Swifty with his little rapier; Sir Swifty was a)
faster on his feet given that his balance was more optimal for movement
rather than counterbalancing ridiculously overweight, overlong swords, and
b) faster-handed since his weapon was lighter.  Quite simply, you don\'t
need a lot of kinetic energy to kill with a blade, and lighter swords are
more energy-efficient, therefore faster and therefore more effective given
unarmoured opponents.

	Cutting someone in two is every bit as lethal as slicing a carotid
or just jamming a foot of properly profiled, unhygienic blade though a
vital organ; thing is is that it takes longer to wind up, your opponent can
figure out what you\'re up to *ages* before you\'re going to do it (which is
the big wet sloppy tonsil-licker of death), and while you\'re using most of
your upper body strength to swing back your weapon in order to get plenty
of oomph into the swing, he\'s daintily snickering into his lace hankie and
extending his arm, and by extension his point, into the numerous soft and
vital portions of your anatomy that you\'ve exposed...

	In Trav, I would certainly expect shields to be encountered at some
point... on backward planets, where visiting Imperial Nobles would likely
be packing guns (since this isn\'t Sylea or the Imperial Court anymore) and
numerous henchmen with bigger guns.  Were people to start lugging shields
around in the Imperium again, as some sort of retro fashion statement,
those worried about them would just have to start packing guns to make them
obsolete again...  And let\'s face it... when up against PGMPs or FGMP\'s a
shield ain\'t worth squat.  I suspect that even if one could stop a round
from a gauss gun or large-cal firearm, your shield arm would probably
fracture, or if at best get real sore.

	And before I go back to work, I should also add that AFAIK real
broadswords and shields are considerably heavier than the recycled stop
signs and tarted-up rattan canes the SCA fighters pack.  This makes SCA
fighting somewhat dubious IMHO as a test-bed for the sort of comparison
you\'re making.

I disagree. You\'re chances of getting damaged are the same. I think what 
you meant to say is that "...having armor will increase the *possible 
amount* of damage inflicted" ;-)

You\'re quite correct, Ken, using CmdrX\'s example, with AV3 armour, 4D6 
with armour has a 33% chance to hurt less than 3D6 with armour.

But with your system, there is a chance (albeit a smaller chance) that 
6D6 damage will hurt less than 4D6 damage. Min damage is 4 at 4D6; min. 
damage is 3 at 6D6.

More importantly, at 4D6 or 5D6, min. damage is *greater than* min.

I\'m not familiar with their fixes, but here\'s what I would do. (Glenn 
Hoppe\'s "fix")

Perhaps I don\'t quite understand the rationale behind the max damage 
rule, but it seems to me that the easiest way to fix the problem is to 
*not* simply "ignore" damage beyond 3D6.

I think that for every die of damage "ignored", +1 should be added to the 
damage roll. Keep blunt trauma as written.

eg. Getting hit with 6D6 of damage without armour is actually 3D6+3; 4D6 
is 3D6+1.

In other words, if you wear AV3 armour and get hit with >= 6D6 damage, 
amount of damage rolled will be the same as if you were "butt nekkid".

For comparison, here is the damage inflicted, using standard T4 system, 
CmdrX\'s system, your system, and my system.

Actually, the bladed combat thread got me thinking about this, because it
reminded me of "The Forever War", where the troops are eventually reduced
to using (very special) spears and swords inside an energy dampening field.  

So: what fiction do you like for resource material?  I\'ve already obliquely
suggested "The Count of Monte Christo" just because I think you could
retell that story in a Traveller-Imperium setting easily and well.

What other movies, books, etc., do you connect up somehow with Traveller?
No defense is needed, of course; we all have our own ideas and visions.
Still, if there\'s something in particular that strikes you, let us know.

A few of mine, off the top of my head:

"The Forever War"
"Ender\'s Game"
"Armor" -- full (scout) battledress against big bugs
"Alien" -- the working (wo)man\'s side of Traveller
"Star Wars" -- just for the Imperium, Han Solo, and Jabba :)
               (but does anyone do the mystical thing with
                Jedi-like people in their game?)
"Outland"
"Bladerunner" -- yeah it\'s a bit dark, but so what?
"King David\'s Spaceship", "The Mote in God\'s Eye", etc. --
    so-so Co-Dominium stuff that you can lift pretty easily;
    same with most of the Known Space stories
"Deep Space Nine" and "Babylon 5" (but NOT the rest of ST) -- 
    good, semi-gritty, semi-clean view of hi TL societies.

Hmm. Too much video, not enough paper on that list.  I\'m sure there are a
zillion other classics I\'ve left out (I\'ve not mentioned Starship Troopers
or the Stainless Steel Rat books, but...).  What are some of yours,
especially ones the rest of us might not think of?

I hope IG takes this opportunity to revisit some of the published ship
designs and deck plans. I remember with chagrin some of the ridiculous
designs published in the past: starships whose illustrations, deck plans,
and dimensions from the design haven\'t the slightest resemblance to each
other; ships whose crew space exceed the designed space by 400%;
unstreamlined ships with wings; vanishing fuel storage; no raw material,
food, water, or replacement air storage; hatches and elevators in the
middle of hallways; doors that open into each other; lounges and mess halls
included in the deck plans but not mentioned in the design; volume-wasting
corridors that lead nowhere; doors that open into space; choke points at
critical ship areas; "small" staterooms the size of hotel suites; no
storage or maintenance space; no personal storage space; no toilets or
decontamination facilities; no facilities for passengers with children; no
offices, conference rooms or workrooms;  ... well I could go on and on. A
lot of the published deck plans seem like advertisements for loft-style
apartments, they look nice on the brochures but as soon as you walk inside
you notice how unlivable they are.

I have designed some deck plans which I feel are more useful, though my
draftsmanship isn\'t professional. It\'s not that difficult; I estimate only
50% of the volume for staterooms is actually private living space, 20% is
hallway and common area, 20% is life-support equipment and storage, 10% is
private storage space. A small stateroom is about the size of a pullman
cabin on a train, a large stateroom is about the size of a private dorm or
hostel suite. Most commercial lodging is actually for couples, so passenger
accomodations in my campaign combines two large staterooms into a
double-large stateroom, about the size of a small hotel suite, with a
double bed or bunk. Another important consideration is that, since
interstellar travel takes weeks, business travellers have access to office
and conference space so they can carry out their business en route.

For practical, space-efficient, designs check out deck plans for cruise
ships (available at tour companies). Several facilities on board cruise
ships should be available on starships, especially ones that carry
passengers, such as lounges, swimming pools, exercise rooms, libraries,
conference rooms, daycare centres, shops, casinos, restaurants, and luxury
staterooms.

	Greetings, fellow ex-fencer... I fenced ep=E9e for about 6 years (3
of them on the McGill fencing team) before law school ruined my schedule
for me :).  Did a bit of sabre, too.  Never fenced a SCAdian; just talked
shop with them.

	Good point; only modern example that I can think of are those
plastic shields that riot police carry; good against rocks, bottles, and so
forth, but I would suspect little good against much else...

	Indeed.  Assuming equal levels of physical fitness, the barbarian
will tire more quickly given the heavier weapon not to mention the weight
of the shield.  As far as range is going, it occurs to me that having the
shield arm out front, will a) affect his lunge somewhat from a balance
point of view, and b) slow down his recovery from a lunge, as he can\'t haul
himself back up into stance with his off arm.  Given that he\'s leading with
his unarmed arm, his effective distance/lethal radius while using the
shield will be lower than yours.  So the fencer, assuming a lack of
obstructions, will have a speed and mobility advantage.

	Then there\'s the effect on morale... and this is my ep=E9e bias
showing, but there are a lot of places where a mere four-cm deep puncture
wound can put you in intensive care or the morgue.  A punctured lung is
apparently a very unpleasant thing to suffer :).

	Assuming he\'s not using a weapon with a basket hilt, you can always
cut for his hand and make sure that he has to zip up his fur loincloth with
his teeth from then on...

	Well, here, let\'s not forget that actual cav sabres are a lot
heavier than fencing sabres, but still, I\'m not sure how useful a shield
would be against someone with good speed and point control once a shield
punch has been launched; sliding your point past it and into his juicy bits
should be easy, especially if the shield blocks his view of your point.
And then again, you\'ve got far more precise control of your point than he
has with something strapped to his forearm.  And the range of movement is
more restricted... of course, it is in close to his body, but yeah... I
wouldn\'t want to be using shield punches as a main offensive tactic; when
the opportunity presents itself, sure, but otherwise, ferget it.

	As well, let\'s not forget that the popular conception of a parry as
interposing your blade across the arc of his swing in order to block it is
somewhat limited... parries also include using leverage to deflect, not
block, the attack, which is often a more effective thing to do, especially
if your opponent\'s blade is much heavier and will therefore take more time
to recover from the attack.

	For non-fencers, look at the following diagram:

	      |
	0=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D+=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D-
	      |

               ^        ^   ^        ^
               | forte  |   | foible |


	Simply put, if I apply pressure upon the foible of his blade with
the forte of my blade, I will enjoy a significant mechanical advantage; I
will have better leverage with which to push his point off target.  In
order to effectively parry an attack you don\'t have to stop it cold, just
make sure it misses you.

	Therefore, the popular image of the barbarian\'s broadsword smashing
the noble\'s rapier might hold true if the noble were boneheaded and
unskilled; a better image might be of the noble noting the impending cut,
glancing at his watch, and rather than stupidly blocking it merely picking
the barbarian\'s point up with his blade, sweeping it somewhat off-target,
and then jamming his point through a tender portion of the barbarian\'s
anatomy.  This would be most effective against a downwards cut to the head
or shoulders (deflect sideways), or a high lateral cut (deflect over head).
Lower lateral cuts should just be dealt with by a) stop cuts/thrusts or b)
stepping out of the range of the swing and then feinting to the head...
shield comes up, and then things get real fun; if he blinds himself with
it, he deserves whatever is coming to him.  Or as you pointed out,
out-feint him; flick your point up and down several times and then go for
his sword arm as it swings back.

	Dammit... I am really getting the urge to suit up and go to town on
someone... trouble is, I doubt if I\'d fit into my gear anymore :(.

Send me the numbers, and if convinced that the percentages are reasonable 
(the Plain Jane sample seemed sound), I will number among the converted!

I don\'t know which direction you\'re thinking of going with that, but I 
suggest keeping it simple. Say, three sixes means SF. Or three sixes and 
a failed throw.

For SS, maybe If the roll is less than the number of dice thrown + skill 
level, then Succeed Spectacularly? This makes SS ridiculously easy at the 
low end, (A Good Thing, imho, a skilled person *should* succeed 
spectacularly when handed the routine.) It also ties the chance for 
spectacular success to skill level, and not purely "luck of the roll".

eg. A skill-1 person needs all ones at all degrees of difficulty for SS
    A skill-2 person can afford one "2".
    A skill-6 person needs to roll less than "8" for an easy task, or "9" 
for an average task... etc.

I\'ll look more deeply into your system. On the surface though, it seems 
perfeito.

   But it still has to pass muster on the "BS" factor.  The farther you
go out on the believability scale, the more likely it is that someone,
usually a player who knows practical astrophysics (in other words not an
expert by any means) will stand up and yell "bullsh*t!" as you are

   Also, it just plain makes it harder to describe a world when you have
to resort to all kinds of mental gymnastics to justify every anomalous
stat off the UWP.  Better that the system to generate stats for star
systems give me believable numbers, and if I want an "exception to the

Anders, that\'s because we were trained with the phrase, "i before e, except
after c", and we have trouble with exceptions.  Of course, there\'s always
"when 2 vowels go walking, the first does the talking", so "ei" is "erd"
and "ie" is "ird".  <g> Isn\'t English FUN?

   Sounds like they didn\'t fix that glitch that occured when the sector
stats were originally generated.  Problem with the software I
understand.  People have known about it for years--I know it was a point
of discussion among HIWG members when we talked about a project to
generate New Era/Imperial Era UWPs for all the worlds in the Imperium.

   I\'m not sure what advise to give you at this point.  Re-generating
the stellar data is one thing, but all the law levels as well?  I guess
that\'s is your only option.

Geez...tough question... I like all your resources...

In addition, I would add the following: (big IMHO\'s here)

1) Neuromancer/Count Zero/Mona Lisa Overdrive/Virtual Light/Burning Chrome
(I like cyberpunk fiction, especially William Gibson. Some people think it\'s
a character flaw.)

2) The Stainless Steel Rat books, especially the first story.

3) Modern techno-thrillers (Tom Clancy comes to mind, as well as Richard
Marcinko). I use this for military style ideas. (I run heavy military
games...lots of spies and specops types running around)

4) Ghost in the shell...Cyberpunk anime. Haven\'t seen it? rent it!! You\'ll
be glad you did. That is if you like that sort of thing.

5) Non-fiction resources. I try to read a lot of tech stuff, plus a steady
diet of Science and Nature (being a post-doc has some advantages). Guides to
phreaking/hacking/encrypting make for cool ideas for me. My PhD is in
Biochemistry, so I have a decent idea of what biotech is all about.

6) Non-period fiction: The characters in the Three Musketeers, Cyrano de
Bergerac, the Man in the Iron Mask, and other classic fiction transcend
genre and can be used extraordianrily well in Traveller.

7) Non-period history: I am interested in adapting some of my reading about
the cult of personality surrounding the Borgia anti-Popes (especially
Alexander 6) to Cleon I (Magnus).

That\'s a top of the head descriptor of what I use to generate
ideas...everything I see... :)

I applaud the elimination of the half dice, and the simplicity of your
solution. I also notice you\'ve opted for a 3:1 stat to skill ratio, which
just happens to be what I\'ve finally settled on for the D66 system - so
we\'re in perfect agreement there.

I still object to throwing and adding buckets of dice as the Difficulty
rises, but 7D for Impossible is certainly preferable to 10D or some of the
other suggestions that have been made (jokingly and seriously).

If I hadn\'t (sort of) solved the Task problem to my own satisfaction with
the D66 system, I would certainly use your system. And I think Marc could
do worse than adopt it for future editions of T4.

A suggestion for the Spectacular Success and Failure problem: for each task
roll, make sure two of the dice are distinct from the others, either a
different color, or rolled separately - make these the critical die: two
ones on these dice is a SpecSuccess, two sixes a SpecFailure.

That\'s just off the top of my head, but I doubt there\'s a simpler solution.

I\'d say KBv2.0 looks pretty good at first glance.

Well, I play it that way, too. Sure it has disadvantages, but there is
no better way of carrying cash from here to a system 4 parsecs away
instantly.

In my campaigns, I call them credit-crystals (\'cause the information is
saved on a holo-crystal). They are in several ways electronically
secured (code, fingerprint a.s.o). They come with an adapter. If
somebody pays you money, he plugs his card in your cardadapter and books
the amount directly on your card.

Disadvantages:
1) You better don\'t lose your card, or your money is gone.
2) All electronic securities can be cracked.

But I\'ll take that for comfortability.

        It\'s definitely NOT fun when you have to learn it from the beginning
as your third language, and you have no mind for languages like me...

        But thus just made me think.... hey, do we know what these guys at
Milieu Zero are speaking? IIRC, there was something called High Sylean
around, and I do not remember when and how Galanglic started to be the
official language of the Imperium. And, anyway, what are most of the worlds
talking? Modern Vilani? A mixture? (Certainly, the Geonee worlds speak
Irkonee <G>)
        Seems to me that, right after the Long Night, we can NOT safely
assume that there is a *main* language around. I see some worlds speaking
degenerated forms of Vilani mixed with Solomani languages, and all this
being confronted to the High Sylean brought by the new Imperial powers... in
a few centuries, it will all get mixed and we will have... ta-daaa....
Galactic! Ooops, sorry, Galanglic (in my heretic campaigns, English was
*not* a major language and Galactic is a mixture of Spanish and Vilani <G>)

Eluki Bes Shahar\'s Butterfly St. Syr trilogy:

_Hellflower_
_Darktraders_
_Archangel Blues_

The series is much fun and looks a *whole* lot like the Imperium.  This 
series focuses on the low-life smuggler fringe with a number of forays 
into the noble culture of the core.

David Trowbridge and Sherwood Smith\'s Exordium series:

_Phoenix in Flight_
_Ruler of Naught_
_A Prison Unsought_
_Rifter\'s Covenant_
and whatever the 5th book (unready by me so far) is called.

This series focuses primarily on war and noble with numberous forays into
life on the criminal fringe.  If anything, this series is even more like 
Traveller than the other one.


One interesting observation from reading both series.  Both of these series\'
of books are space opera-like fiction updated for the modern day.  There 
is an awareness of the potentials of modern and future computer technologies,
human-computer interfaces and lots of similar stuff unheard of in similar 
50s-70s fiction (and these two series are better written to boot).  

Both series have huge empires, interstellar nobility, ancient technologies
of vast power, aliens, and the second series even has psionics which have
a very Traveller feel.  The resemblance between either series and the 
Imperium is truly amazing.

Anyway, one fascinating similarity shared by both books is that sentient
computers are fully possible, they can even be made much more intelligent
than a human.  However, in both universes making such computers is
*highly* illegal (as in capital crimes with no appeal if the masses don\'t
rip you apart first).  The reason in both cases being that such machines
were once made and they attempted to take over the known galaxy and had to
be fought off with great loss of life.  This type of war would go a long
way towards explaining why computers aren\'t a whole lot better than they
are in the Traveller universe (btw, these wars seemed nothing like the
Virus).  

In any case, either of these settings (or a combination of both) can be
adopted as a general model for the Imperium, and can add in a whole host
of details. 

As a final note, a few other books to look at:

_Angel Station_ by Walter Jon Williams

_Eon_, _Eternity_ & _Legacy_ by Greg Bear

& of course, Gregory Benford\'s wonderful Galactic Core series

_In the Ocean of Night_
_Across the Sea of Suns_
_The Great Sky River_
_Tides of Light_
_Furious Gulf_
_Sailing Bright Eternity_

Non of these books have setting very much like the Imperium, but they have
nifty ideas which can easily be lifted.  These books are all wonderful
sources for ideas about just how alien humanity and human cultures can
become in a high tech setting (as well as all being great reads). 

Happy Reading-

But mone of them do so for 10 minutes (old turn length) much less 30

There are a number of things you can do "in-system" that won\'t work in
interstellar trade.

"Free transit"
	Any "bulk" cargo, especially one that there\'s no rush about
	delivering, can be stuck in a cargo pod (spaceproof box with a
	radar beacon and transponder). A tug will then boost the pod or
	a group of pods into a hohman transfer orbit for the other
	planet or satellite.  When it arrives at the other end (half an
	orbit later), another tug matches orbit, and then boosts the
	pod(s) into orbit around the destination.

	The course changes at each end are only a few km/sec, so it\'s a
	*very* cheap transport method. But it takes a lot of time. And
	you can only do it when the start and destination have the
	right relative positions (about once a local year for planet to
	planet transfers). As they move away from the ideal position,
	it takes more delta-v to inject the cargo into the transfer
	orbit. So the rates vary according to time of year.

	Hijacking is rarely a problem as there\'s no *legitimate* reason
	for a ship to match orbit with a cargo in transit. Sure, you
	can plot a jump, grab the pod and jump out. But that assumes
	the cargo is *worth* the trouble, and that you haven\'t grabbed
	a dummy pod set up to trap hijackers....

	For passengers, you just put a ship in transfer orbit and coast
	along.  In some places these trips are thought of as something
	"special", and there are large ships carrying thousands of
	passengers taking months to cross between planets. Most places,
	only the very broke will sign up, unless this is the best local
	tech can do.

Sails, solar and magnetic
	You can attach cargo pods to solar sails or magnetic sails with
	an autopilot. These are almost as cheap as free transit, and
	faster.  They\'re still kinda slow, but again, there\'s a *lot*
	of cargo where all that anybody cares about is that shipments
	arrive regularly, not how many loads are in transit at any
	given time. So rates are pretty steady regardless of the time
	of the local "year".

	Contrary to poular belief it *is* possible to "sail" a cargo
	*towards* the star. It\'s not even any real trick.

	Passengers vessels can use sails, but ahain, the trip length
	tends to count against it.

Constant boost ships
	For express cargos, and for passengers this is common when
	there\'s a reason for not doing a microjump. The ship boosts
	until halfway at constant g, then flips over and decelerates at
	the same rate.

	With thrusters it\'s an ok option. With a drive that requires
	reaction mass, it\'s *real* expensive unless the drive is *very*
	efficient.

Microjump
	We all know the rules and costs here.

Main use of constant boost will be in situations where it\'s possible to
cross the distance in less than a week, or where both ends of the trip
are inside the star\'s 100 diameter limit.

Unfortunately, figuring the orbits for "free transit" and the courses
for "sails" isn\'t simple, so unless someone writes a program for us,
we\'re kinda stuck. Besides, they are rather specialized. The only way a
PC ship would get involved would be as a tug, or as a hijack attempt,
and for those you can fudge the messy details.

	If you adapt the system that each skill choice is worth 3 levels of
skill but leave the experience system as it is you will have _also_
fixed the problems with it.  Since it will now take 3 times as many
rolls g(gaining 1 level at a time) to represent 1 level of skill the
experience system will no longer be _way_ too generous.  However if you
tripple the level used you may need to roll for each increse on 3d6 and
not 1d6.

	Consider a charecter with  Fast Talk at skill level 3 under the
standard system.  If he uses his Fast Talk he may get an experience
check.  Then he needs to roll a 3 or better on 1d6 and has a 66.7 %
chance of going up to skill level 4.  If he uses his Fast Talk again
next month he may get another check in it and will have a 50% chance of
going up to skill level 5.  If skill levels in generation are trippled
but each experience check is not then it will now take much longer to
rise in skill.  He will now have skill level 9 and 1 experience check
may gain him level 10, which is the same as level 3.33 under the
standard system. You will have cut the experience gain rate about 4
fold.

Hmmm..., I like it!  You might want to ask Scott Galliand about his

You will get credit for your creation.  Check it out at

I was trying to come up with this career on my own, but with everything
else going on (Workwise, netwise, and clanwise) it got left on the back
burner.  Looks like you beat me to the punch. Good show! :)

	You can try this at home, kiddies!  Take two yardsticks.  Have a
friend hold one pointing at your torso.  Take yours, and place yours
against his so that your forte and his foible are in contact.  Then move
his yardstick off to one side.  Let him try and use all the strength he
wants to...

But modern armies still teach marching drill don\'t they? Very few armies

The sword part could be a traditional thing and most armies like traditions.

    For the historical example, it was exactly this situation that prompted the
founding of American Express and its, at the time revolutionary, Travellers\'
Cheques.  The Credit Card came later, much later. ;)
    But I would assume in Mileu 0 that this is a Serious problem in the just
founded Imperium.  This has always been a problem throughout the history of
human commerce.  Part of the historic reason you have Factors, Agents and
Offices in foreign ports/lands is so that you have resources THERE. ;) Very
important when you\'re expensive merchant ship limps into port having been
mauled by a storm and needs expensive repairs.
    This OC brings up another problem that Mileu 0 is going to have.  The
medium of exchange.  Oh sure, you the Far Trader captain would prefer your TL2
customers to pay you in Credits, but... until you showed up they\'d never heard
of the Imperium before.  What are they going to pay you with to buy those fancy
weapons, tools and whatnots you\'re selling to them that you can get value for
back in the Imperium?  Reading up on the difficulties Spain and the other
European Colonial Powers had in getting Gold and other value out of their
colonies can be very revealing here. ;)

    Later on, past Mileu 0, I would think that the rising MegaCorporations
would step in to provide these highly profitable services.  Not just moving
money around but also guarenteeing monies held across Interstellar distances.
Mercenary Contracts come to mind in this regard, the Imperium it\'s self would
find these kinds of services too.  Thoughts?

    Actually I\'ve found that all the older classic adventure novels translate
wonderfully into the Traveller setting.  Ran the Prisoner of Zenda as a
campaign once back in my Classic Traveller days with the prelude of the Fifth
Frontier War as the backdrop and Zhodani agents having kidnapped the Duchess of
Mora and our one female player being her near identical twin!  Made for a WILD
run. <GRIN> Try translating the Three Musketeers sometime ;) or Treasure Island
(Asteroid!) or Around the World (Subsector) in 80 days or Hounds of the
Baskervilles!!! <GRIN>

Hmmm, looks like it begins with \'fo\' and ends with \'e\' and has either
2 or 3 letters between.
fondle
fondue
forage
forbye
force
forge
fosse
fovea

Of course, it must be \'fondue\' as you can obviously use your sword a
second way after all that hard fighting.

	The bat thing was a subtle in-group reference to a particularly
traumatic incident back during a Vampire campaign set in the UK.  A certain
extremely undead, insane, and unpleasant NPC was tormenting a human PC,
played by Ross... at one point he woke up Ross\'s character while
brandishing a cricket bat, and demanded that he teach him how to play
cricket.  Once outside, they flipped for who bowled first... the vampire
won.  He proceeded to assume his stance, wind up, drop the ball, pull a
hand grenade out of his pocket, pulled the pin, and lobbed it at Ross\'s
character.

	Needless to say the vamp enjoyed the game immensely, and carried a
cricket bat about wherever he went from then on.

	There\'s a lot of misconceptions floating around here. Those old
broadswords and two handers, etc, are NOT just giant lumps of cold iron! A
survey, for instance, of the known examples of Viking longswords, averages
them out to about 3 pounds each, considerably lighter than the cheapo
replicas you find all over the place. Also, they were well balanced.

	Ceremonial wepons and armor were heavy and cumbersome, but real
working swords weren\'t. The height of two-handed swordfighting technique
and construction occured in Elizabethan times, the province of the
Landsknecht (sp) Swiss merc\'s who would wade in with these huge light
things and chop people up from 4 1/2 feet away. Two handers were such a
big thing, that significant chunks of the fencing manuals of the day were
devoted to offensive and defensive techniques with two handed swords. 

	I have a catalog, which curse me, I can\'t find right now, from a
company called Museum Replicas, Ltd. (I think) which makes REAL swords.
(The sword Mel Gibson was flinging about in Braveheart may have been made
by them, at least they sell a close, if not exact replica) and it doesn\'t
weigh no 14 pounds!

What about the ocean bottom life centred around volcanic vents. I could
see that life could develop around these, and not need great amounts of
antifreeze in the water.

And even if the world was not volcanic, cold conditions does not
preclude the existance of life, the basic chemical reactions still take
place, but at a much slower rate. The early evolutionary period could
have been filled with organisms with incredibly slow metabolisms.

Natuarlly, the organisms that evolve faster metabolisms have an abundant
slow moving food source.

The limited abilities of computers in Traveller has always bugged me, as it
seems to still have too much of a 1970s "big-iron" feel to it.  OTOH, the
plot device you mention -- that computers\' abilities are limited by law and
custom rather than soley by technology -- is also central to "Dune" (thus
the Mentats), and could be used well here.  

It occurs to me that we currently live in a society with truly enormous
firepower, and yet individual citizens and corporations are strictly
limited in how big a bang they can legally make.  Maybe the same analogy
holds true for computers in an informational way: computers represent
informational "firepower", so, just as physical weapons are limited today,
in a future society informational power is similarly limited.  In fact this
_does_ happen today, with the US heavily restricting how powerful of a
computer you can export.  

And like any good game-rationalization, this opens up all kinds of cool
scenarios: consider the players getting tangled in a situation that is a
combination of "Hyperion" and "Neuromancer" and even "Tron" -- finding a
planets-spanning truly artificially intelligent computer system that has,
say, managed to gain not only clandestine citizenship but even control of a
small but powerful megacorp.  They might be contracted to discover who is
really at the head of this corp, or they might be contracted by the corp
and find this out as they go on, or they might be contracted to run an
Imperial Interdiction on the system (from within or without) for various
reasons, or, naturally, they might have to infiltrate and shut down the
computer system.  If you take this far enough, it could even resemble
"Paranoia". :)

Anyway, I think I know now how I\'ll explain the limitations on computers,
and why it is various government agents (Turing Commission folks :) ) come
sniffing around every time you try to do that odd little upgrade to your
ship\'s computer.

         No kidding?  What did you use to simulate your sabre?  And what

        15 years historical fencing (rapier, main gauche, cloak), kenjutsu,

two-handed sword)
        <Mike\'s diclaimer>
    
First problem: Assuming Imperial standard armament development akin to what
we have in the 20th century, show me the unit that routinely kits its
troopers with shields in anything more than archaic full dress. I submit
that they don\'t. Shields are big, unweildy, and and detract from the amount
of ammunition or the weapons you can carry.

        I agree completely.  Shields are handy for very specific modern
situations, like riot control.  Even assuming that one is making use of
advanced materials in the construction of a shield, to make it light enough
to use and carry effectively almost by definition makes it too light to stop
a modern projectile, much less a TL 12 laser.

Second problem: Shields are a good equalizer, but no one is going to take on
a barbarian with long blade and shield if he has a pistol or small arm at
hand. If he *doesn\'t* have a firearm at hand, the fencer can *still* paste
the barbarian, by applying the advantage that fencing gives you, namely
speed and distance. The barbarian is always trying to get up close to you.
All you need to do is keep him at a distance.

        If you have put this tactic to the test, then you either have the
very rare ability to run backwards as fast as you can run forwards, or you
have fought alarmingly slow opponents.  A good-sized shield, properly used,
will protect a fighter\'s torso and leading leg down to the knee.  A rushing
swordsman will move about one-and-a-half times faster forwards than his
opponent can move backwards, on the average.  This negates distance pretty
fast, and besides, unless the shield fighter is using a rather short weapon,
most broadswords have a length of three feet, giving a fencer at best only a
few inches advantage, plus whatever the length of his arm may yield.  In
short, keeping your opponent at a distance sounds great on paper, but it is
a lot harder in practise.  If you have a tactic that makes this routinely
possible I commend your skill and would really love to learn how to do it.
        I do agree though, that if I am confronted with a sword-wielding
barbarian while I carry a pistol, I would just shoot the guy in the foot and
walk away.

While I will submit that hitting someone at the exteme range of your blade
makes for shallow and usually non-life threatening wounds, they hurt like
hell, throw off your opponents attacks, and hinder his movement. That is
usually good enough to allow for an opening to either escape or to do some
*real* damage once the opposing blade is taken care of.

        Er, please define "extreme range of your blade".  Ideally, you want
to hit your target with the extreme four inches of your blade on slashing or
chopping attacks, because that is the surface area that yields the most
force on impact.  A sword works basically like a lever- the longer it is,
the more force can be generated at the ends.  Admittedly, a fencing sabre
would do far less damage with its extreme four inches than a broadsword,
because it has half (or less) than the broadsword\'s mass, leading to
comparatively superficial damage.  Note that I say comparatively- you can
still do a lot of damage with a fencing sabre if used with precision.

Your barbarian with his 7kg sword is swinging it a *lot*
slower than me with my 2.5 kilo sabre. As he swings, I slice the tendons in
his arm, he drops his heavy and now useless weapon and has to hide behind
his sheild.

        Er, no.  This is an overused fiction propagated by the Conan films.
The heaviest fighting blade I ever held was a fifteenth-century German
two-handed sword.  It was five-and-a-half feet long and weighed eleven
pounds. With the counterweight supplied by its pommel it was a surprisingly
fast weapon for its size.  Most broadswords of three feet length and a
three-inch wide blade weigh no more than three to four pounds.  My weapon of
choice, a four-foot hand-and-a-half, weighs only four pounds.  A cavalry
sabre weighs about two pounds, a fencing sabre much less.  Without doubt,
you would have a speed advantage over the broadsword, and targeting his
swordarm is a very smart tactic, but he will be moving a lot faster than you
have portrayed above.  If you are fast enough to duck out of the reach of
his swing and then dart back in to cut his arm, then he deserves his fate. 

I can now stand well out of the way of any clumsy shield punch (which is
most often an untrained desperation maneuver) and cut the leg tendons, the
head, or anyplace else that the shield can\'t cover. Also, my sabre moves a
hell of a lot faster than his shield, which means I can feint him out of his
shorts and hit anyplace I really choose.

        Can\'t argue there.  IF you can avoid being clobbered by his attack,
and IF your opponent is not foolish enough to expect that you would attack
his arm, and IF you hit the arm well enough to incapacticate it, and IF at
this point he doesn\'t decide to charge at you with the shield and flatten
you to the ground (don\'t knock desperation tactics- I\'ve seen them work more
often than you would think), then yes, he is doomed.

><SFX: broadsword shatters sabre>

With proper distance (which is the best parry) you needn\'t worry about this.
However, with modern alloys your example is still not valid, unless the
steel in the sabre is too brittle. A modern composite blade (akin to Toledo
steel) won\'t shatter like you suggest.

        Please explain "proper distance".  If you\'re too far back to be hit,
then your opponent has a problem with depth perception.  One has to assume
that your opponent wants to hit you, and will maneuver into striking range.
From there, you can either attack, duck, move back, or try to parry.  A
fencing sabre will not parry a broadsword.  The end result is that the
lighter blade gets slapped aside, or worse, it gets bent back and strikes
the wielder\'s body as well as the opponent\'s sword.  (I\'ve seen this happen
several times.)

Again, this is irrelevant given the speed of my attack with the sabre. Your
star-faring barbarian and his nifty shield are still going to assume that I
am committed to one attack, when really I am waiting for my true target. In
fact if you can see me through your shield you might be at a disadvantage,
because you are convinced that there is *no way* I could alter my attack.

        Only if the barbarian was really, really stupid.   It\'s common sense
to figure that someone wielding a very light, fast sword would have much
more control over his blows, leading to a lot of probes and feints.  I
submit, sir, that your analysis of this combat is far too simplistic.  From
my experience, a very skilled fencer could defeat a sword-and-shield
wielding opponent with a bit of luck, but between two opponents of equal
skill and dexterity, the barbarian has the advantages of a more powerful
weapon and better armor coverage versus the fencer\'s speed.  If the
barbarian is careful and observant and plays on his strengths, he will kill
the fencer.  

The Marines are far more than the descendents of your Imperial Noble\'s
lackeys. They were a corps of free men, trained and devoted to the service
of a government. The Marines are a unit, with esprit, not merely a
collection of professional bodyguards. The reason that they still train with
the cutlass is two-fold:

1) Tradition from ancient wet ship boarding actions.

2) It is still useful to use a long blade in Spaceship combat, because if
you crack a suit, you generally kill your man. However, to this end, light
strong blades are preferred to avoid rotational/angular momentum problems
with a huge windup from a heavy blade. Also you don\'t need to kill the man
*in* the suit with your blow...you just need to pop it, or slice a hose, or
open a wide gash in the fabric. Hence the sport fencing idea of *any hit is
a kill* holds literally.

        Plus the fact that there are lots of components on a starship that
don\'t hold up well to bullets or lasers.  Stray shots can damage consoles,
sever power conduits, and the like.  In one game I ran, the players boarded
a vessel with the intent of capturing it, but in the course of a brief
firefight on the bridge, managed to shoot many holes in the helm and
astrogation consoles, plus sever the data link to the ship\'s computer.

make sure it misses you.

	Therefore, the popular image of the barbarian\'s broadsword smashing
the noble\'s rapier might hold true if the noble were boneheaded and
unskilled; a better image might be of the noble noting the impending cut,
glancing at his watch, and rather than stupidly blocking it merely picking
the barbarian\'s point up with his blade, sweeping it somewhat off-target,
and then jamming his point through a tender portion of the barbarian\'s
anatomy.  This would be most effective against a downwards cut to the head
or shoulders (deflect sideways), or a high lateral cut (deflect over head).
Lower lateral cuts should just be dealt with by a) stop cuts/thrusts or b)
stepping out of the range of the swing and then feinting to the head...
shield comes up, and then things get real fun; if he blinds himself with
it, he deserves whatever is coming to him.  Or as you pointed out,
out-feint him; flick your point up and down several times and then go for
his sword arm as it swings back.

        Er, no, sir, that wouldn\'t work.  Your use of the riposte depends on
your opponent having a weapon of equal weight.  The broadsword would be two
to three times heavier, even though we\'re only talking about a pound for the
sabre and three pounds for the broadsword.  It makes a big difference.  Like
your earlier yardstick analogy, when the opponent attempts to press against
your parry, his stick will flex before it can generate enough force to drive
you back.  The same would happen with your sabre versus the broadsword- the
fencing sabre will flex before it can generate enough force to deflect the
broadsword\'s thrust significantly.  Trust me- I\'ve got the scars to prove it.

The point of Drill and Ceremony training is to teach disipline.  Marching in
formation is harder than it looks, and the relentless drilling teaches the
new soldier how to obey orders quickly.  We still march to the motor pool,
or to the airfield.  Marching in ranks in a great way to get hundreds (or
thousands) of men and their equipment from point A to point B with minimal
confusion.

In the US Military, only the Marine Corps actually teaches sword drill, and
then it isn\'t for combat, it is a ceremonial thing.  I doubt if most Marine
Officers or NCOs would be able to use their swords in combat.  IIRC, you
have to reach E-6 (Staff Sergeant) before you even carry a sword while in
dress uniform.

In my game, the first skill learned in the Marines isn\'t Long Blade, it\'s
Battle Dress, a much more useful skill.

Actually with training on the piste, I find that with a couple of years
experience, you are nearly as far backwards as forwards. Of course I haven\'t
tested this in any sort of "real combat", but according to theory, by moving
back and forth you constrain your opponent to straight line maneuvers. I
used to be pretty fast moving backward. I was certainly as fast as the
SCAdians I was playing with. They were often encumbered by the shield. That
may imply that they didn\'t know how to use it.

Granted, but if I cut the side of the shin. I am going to reduce the
low-tech fighters mobility drastically.

Distance is only part of the equation. I often found that displacing the
opponent\'s weapon also worked well, and that it was usually a good tactic to
displace and cut the weapon arm. By our rules that was a disable. In terms
of "Real Life", YMMV.

In my experience, people who are using big weapons like to get up close and
personal, far beyond the top third of the blade on striking the opponent.
This may be due to a lack of experience in handling the blade. I think
fencers have a better instinctive grasp of the distance concept.

I accept your correction.

As I said above, distance is only part of the equation. It is very possible
to control the opponent\'s blade by keeping yours in contact with it.

Well, desperation tactics do work pretty well sometimes. However, there is
no way that the broadswordsman can attack without leaving *something*
vulnerable. Most often (and again, I find it common when someone is relying
on a shield) this is the sword arm. Often it is the face as well, which
would really suck...

I suppose a clarification is in order. The sabre I am envisioning for my
thinking would be something akin to the USMC dress sabre...maybe a bit
heavier, with a basket hit. The blade would taper from  5 cm at the hilt to
3 cm at the tip (chisel pointed? maybe...). It would *certainly* be heavier
and stiffer than the average fencing sabre.

A light blade *can* parry a broadsword, applying it\'s force at the upper
third of the broadsword. A swift chop here takes the broadsword out of line.
If you are not afraid of contact, now would be the time to step in
corps-a-corps and shoulder the shield-bearer, knocking him off balance. If
you are afraid of contact, once the broadsword is out of line, chop wrist,
elbow, cheek or crown, as the target warrants.

I have to respectfully disagree. At this point I don\'t want to have the
conversation devolve into "can not/can too", but let me at least explain my
rationale.

First point: I am modeling the barbarian and his behavior from low-tech
Terra. I don\'t think that (IMHO) a barbarian (or hell, even a French
chevalier c.1100) is going to be  tarined or capable of handling the
fencer\'s speed or control of target. Thus I don\'t see how he could "figure
that...a very light fast sword would have much more control." I mean he is a
barbarian after all. If his planet has never had the need to develop light
weapons and no armor (ie no post-Italian Renaissance tech) how would he have
this experience? I submit he wouldn\'t. That\'s why I could beat even
experienced stickjocks, because I was playing against their inexperience of
what I was capable of. This idea of inexperience is an untestable
supposition, so if you disagree, I can\'t offer further logic to convince you.

Secondly, I don\'t assume the extremnely light fencing weapons, but instead a
more "Napoleonic" or "American Civil War" style sabre, not as light as you
might be thinking, but still far more agile than your average broadsword.
The combination of non-trivial wounding (to an exposed weapon arm) and the
weight to effectively displace the broadsword (at the upper third of the
blade) makes the sabre (and the fencer) the better choice in my opinion.

Anyhow, that was my thinking on the subject...

Re. bats
I believe Aslan nobles practice something very similiar to falconry
with large, predatory bats (with poisonous talons, no less), instead
of birds.  This tidbit turned up in an old issue of the J.T.A.S.

   Seems like you view the marines as His Majesty\'s special forces, and
   have a fairly high opinion of them. But (given Traveller\'s roots) it
   may be possible to compare them to the old US and royal marines from
   the age of sail, where they maintained discipline and order on board
   ships, in ports, and at bases. They may be essentially "cops with
   swords" (as opposed to truncheons, flashlights, or tranq spray). And
   I could see a nobleman or government servant might keep a few around
   for protection. Or I could see how Cleon might use them in place of
   regular troops to fight a particularly usavory little war that he
   wanted to keep out of the limelight. Skilled? Maybe not, but
   bloodthirsty! And /always/ faithful.

   Just an alternative way of looking at things.

Mike,

(please take this in the jovial spirit in which it is offered)

Did you want us to use a sport sabre against a broadsword? :)

Even if you wanted to use a sport weapon (and I reiterate that the weapons
Roderick and I are thinking of are heavier and have considerably less flex),
consider an epee. Barbarian comes in, makes a cut to the head or flank, you
sweep the *trailing* edge of the broadsword (ie in the direction the
barbarian is swinging), bringing yourself into prime parry. Now the
barbarian weapon is trapped outside, the shield is likewise held away *by
the barbarian\'s own weapon arm*, and you drive the point through the
barbarian\'s wide washboard stomach, pushing the case-hardened tip of your
weapon through his soft steel belly-plate.

The difference in weight is not as great as you are envisioning (at least in
what I would consider a "sabre"), so with physics on your side, you
shouldn\'t have a problem with your weapon bending.

I recall that the picture in Fighting Ships (sup 9) shows \'jump cables\'

Rob,

are you saying that Michael Chrichton is a woman? <g>

I\'ve played a few games with women in - IMO the lack of any females in our
current group (which alternates fantasy and Traveller) really means we are
missing something. We have a nasty tendancy to go for swords n guns too
quickly. I ran a game with a predominantly female group at Xmas (my wife,
mother and sister in law), and it tended to be more carefully thought out.
It actually went quite well, especially as it was the first time that
anyone had played a game, let alone T4 (1 to 6D difficulty variant)!

Anyway, digressing, any news on the meson/damper rules for your conversion
system yet? I\'ve just started playing with fighting ships to convert some
of the others out from it.

IG has asked that CORE re-write The Long Way Home into a 2-part adventure 
(each part being 64 pages).  Andy and David (the original authors of 
TLWH) are working on that now.  For those who have the book, the plan is 
to start the second adventure with the "Gateway" chapter.  Thus, from 
IG\'s schedule as posted on their site, we know when the second volume is 
coming out, as "Gateway" is the title - June of 1997.  As to when the 
first is coming out..probably in May.

Changes: TLWH was written to use the sector data provided in T4, which is 
now non-canon, so the new ones will use the correct sector data.  Also, 
since IG wants it in 2 parts, the first part will have to have some 
sub-plot resolution, while leaving the main plot hanging (much like Star 
Wars had some resolution, but left some things hanging to make you want 
to see the next movie).

I agree:  

The maintenance of order and loyalty aboard Imperial warships is one of
the primary missions of the Marines, but the analogy to the Marines aboard
warships during the Age-of-Sail isn\'t *quite* right, at least in my
opinion.  Aboard *those* ships, the Marines were there to keep the *crew*
(plebians and/or criminals) from rebelling against the *officers*.  I
suspect that the Emperor is much more worried about the loyalty of
often-aristocratic naval officers that about plain old mutiny, and that
commander of a ship\'s onboard Marines is also the ship\'s unofficial (?)
"political officer."

So what it seems has happened to ABD in the CT to T4 transition is that
when an opponent in ABD confronts the characters it\'s time to holster
those laser rifles and ACRs and head for the hills.  Likewise, should a
character manage to smuggle a suit of ABD aboard a transport ship,
once he puts on the armor, the crew needs to ask where he would like
to go and may they please stay aboard, cuz they\'re sure not going to do
much about it.  Of course, under the CT rules, it was just -8 to hit, so
eventually a skillful character with an ACR could take him out.

Now I know there are a lot of options for the crew aboard a ship.  This
scenario is not my point.  I\'m just wondering if I\'m the only one who sees
this as a huge upgrade in the armor value, and if people have come up
with solutions.

Given the the requirements for entry and promotion (emphasis on Int and
Soc), and the skill availible, it seems to make more sense that the Marines
are the best of the best.  

They are the Imperium\'s sole ground force, with the Imperial Army being made
up of units drawn from member worlds\' planetary forces.  The skill tables
reflect this, with multiple entries for Enviromental Combat, Camoflague, and
Battle Dress, among others.  Interstingly, there is only one entry for Blade
Combat (roll 6 under Career.)

If a noble needs a "brute squad", he\'s more likely to recruit it from the
planetary Army, which owes more directly to the noble.  Also, using the IM
against a world\'s population for anything short of open rebellion would
violate the "hands-off" policy.

In my campaign, you\'ll find Marines guarding the Imperial Embassy on every
world, along with their more traditional assignments onboard navy vessels.

Glen Grant said

*If the PC is not armored*, then they take the *highest* 3D of the full
number of dice. But, if they\'re flexible armor, the armor absorbs those
dice *before* damage is rolled.

This would ensure that wearing Flex does confer a real benefit compared to
not wearing armor at all - but if you\'re not lucky you might still take
more than 18 points.

How about limiting the maximum damage done by small arms fire to be 18 points regardless of the number of dice that are rolled.

i.e. 6D rolls are 6,2,4,5,2,2 for total of 21 points of which three are lost.

This seems a little severe maybe.

    Only if you get a court order, place a large calibur firearm to their heads
or otherwise use physical or other forms of violence. ;) You must understand
how Hollywood types work, they don\'t create anything, they are utterly bland,
unimaginative, politically biased and completely unoriginal.  They are
TERRIFIED of original ideas and try to chase people away who have them,
certainly they try very to make utterly certain that such people are not
allowed to make movies without the review and heavy editing of trusted higher
ups.
    FoEx one of the functions of Agents is to shop story ideas around for being
made into movies and unless you\'re Tom Clancy with the Hunt for Red October
they\'re going to take your story, reduce it to a page or so synopsis and then
sell that to be reworked by trusted Hollywood Hack writers who produce the same
shlock we\'ve all grow up with.  It must fit the political agenda of the moment
of the Director, producers, executives and such like and not depart too far
from the types these people have been comfortable with.
    FoEx one of the reasons why so much so much of called science fiction made
in the past, and even today, is really horror or gruesome body count films with
science fiction elements is because most of these folks neither understand
science fiction or trust it if they do.  There is a story, I have personal
reasons to know is true, about a bunch of NBC execs who had to have to have the
whole political and social edge of Star Trek explained to them a decade after
they cancelled the show for poor ratings.  BTW I rolled on the floor in
laughter when I found out that the year after they cancelled Star Trek NBC
switched to a demographic rating system and the executives found out that Star
Trek had the best demographics of any show on the air, and OC they had
cancelled it.
    What\'s been done to Starship Troopers is but one in a looong string of
examples of how Hollywood simply can not handle anything with respect, dignity
or even a hope of accuracy.  Consult an expert who knows what they\'re talking
about?  Now do you want they to change their opinions just because you have the
facts on your side?!

   Yes, I\'m very close to completing phase two; thanks to everyone who
   offered input. I should be posting the revised (and complete) rules
   this week. Some things to note:

   1) The damper rules I posted earlier were severely broken; the new
   rules should be a big improvement.

   2) I now have some ad hoc but reasonable rules for meson screens and
   repulsors.

   3) Many people seem unhappy with my armor conversion method.
   Unfortunately, I am unhappy with the alternatives, but in the spirit
   of "agreeing to disagree", I plan to post the alternatives together
   with my own recomendation.

   Enough advertising, I\'ll get to work making the tables now.

I\'ve got no problem with TNE on the list. Personally, the background
interests me. i\'d really like to know where the plot was going after all
the hints in the Regency Sourcebook and Survival Margin (IMO the best ever
MT supplement even if it was meant to be TNE!). I don\'t use the rules (too
complex for my style of play) but I haven\'t got a problem with seeing stuff
here. I\'d certainly prefer odd TNE articles to the interminal posts on T4\'s
tasks that we\'ve had over the last fifty odd digests. <g>

Anyway - whatever the practical viability of Virus - it took my breath away
when I first read SM and started to take in the scope of the devastation.

Is that the same thing? (I\'m not sure, Craig mentioned the source being in
FORTRAN, and the program I found has source in c.)

Marines knowing how to use Long Blades, I was trying to rationalize
something that has been a rule in Traveller since Classic Trav.

I agree the previous poster that Battle Dress is far more appropriate for
a far future star-faring cadre of drop troops.  However, Marc Miller (and
Co.) always mandated Long Blade.  With the publication of T4 and the
resultant creation of Mileau: Year Zero, he made mention of the nobles\'
/code duello/.  I was assuming that this code had been a Sylean tradition
for the requisite number of centuries (if not millenium; this custom might
even predate contact with the Vilani!).  

There are numerous customs and practices (military or otherwise) that
don\'t really serve a necessary function anymore; we just keep doing them
"because we\'ve *always* done them."

For example:

* The military salute originated as a way of showing that you were not
holding a weapon.

* Shaking hands originated as a way of mutually checking that neither
party had a dagger strapped to his forearm hidden by his sleeve.

* Bearing to the right-hand side of the road originated as keeping
oncoming strangers on your left flank, so as to ward off any attack with
your shield.  

Bearing in mind the military tendency to maintain traditions beyond any
rational duration, I felt it was an entirely reasonable premise that
Sylean Marines (later, Imperial Marines) would know Long Blade skill
because of their ancient traditions as bodyguards of the nobility.  

If there just happened to be good, rational reasons for this as well, so
much the better...  :-)

Comments on Franklin\'s T4 Barbarian Career:

Enlisment looks okay...

Injury: A possible max of +6 in modifiers for a UPP of 8?88??-? is a
little much. I like the consistency of no more than +5 worth of
modifiers on the Injury test that applies to all character careers...or
the 5- injury number is a little too low. Consider raising the injury
number to a 6 or a 7 and dropping the +DM for intelligence to +1. This
is both consistant and provides a chance for even Gonad the Barbarian
Ghod to fail an Injury roll.

Promotion: Why have a entry for a roll of 7 on the Benefits table
without the possibility of a Barbarian ever getting the +1 for making
Rank 5? For that matter, unless a Barbarian can learn Gambling skill,
why give an entry for a roll of 7 on the Cash table? 

I suggest either creating a basic rank table _or_ revising the cash
table to allow a Barbarian to muster out with _very small_ amounts of
cash for rolls of, say, 2-5 (Cr10-Cr50) and delete the benefit for a
roll of 7.

The skills tables look right....

I do like this, and I\'ll make some use of a modified version. Good work,
Franklin!

Perhaps ImpMarine training takes a great deal longer than we Terrans
think of as military training. Consider that Heinlein\'s Mobile Infantry
Basic took a _year_ to complete, and taught most of the skills you
mention above, as well as _knife-throwing_ and a lot of others.

That\'s the truth! Imperial Marine Grav APCs have no low-lethality
weapons, and Marines aren\'t used as peacekeepers. "Peace Makers" is more
like it....

Not to mention the reaction of senior military personnel to the problem
of duelling. I stole the basic Ordunnian duelling protocol in my game
from HH...it seems to work:)

With regards to my assertion about the relative strengths of the weapons,
I *own* a broadsword *and* and rapier (both from Museum Replica, about a

Reinhardt, the #2 man over there, the rule of thumb for the weight of a
sword is "a pound per foot"; thus, a typical AD&D "long sword" should
wiegh three to four pounds.  A rapier or other fencing weapon, with a
*much* smaller cross-section for the blade, wieghs about half to one-third
as much.  Admittedly, my example was, perhaps, *somewhat* tongue-in-cheek

Wow...I ran it about twenty times before I got a habitable planet, and
then it was one with a thin atmosphere. (Only .25 atm) OTOH runaway
greenhouse effects are quite common.

According to this program the universe is composed of Gas Giants, airless
rockballs blazingly hot and frigidly cold, and ... venus.

Granted, Terra _seems_ to be an anomaly, being essentially a twin planet
system, (as I remember my popular astronomy (some analog article by the
Great Doctor) Luna has kept earth from being a greenhouse by continually
stripping atmosphere off), but surely planets with atmospheres in the
habitable zone aren\'t THAT uncommon.

Now I gotta go dig up the references, and look at the code to see what\'s
going on.

no... but a couple of side notes:
1) Blades are particularly well suited to boarding actions in vaccum...
they can cut/poke/tear vacc suits quite well, and they are damned effective
at reducing arm function. (Ever get hit with rattan by an Oerthan? Hardest
hitters in the west... rases welts THROUGH armour)

2) Shields are pretty hard to use in hallways.

3) Shields do get in your way when swinging a sword... even your own shield
lowers your chances of hit (In t4, i\'d say only a -1 TN)

4) shields require about half as much training as a sword for effective use.

WRONG!!!! You\'ve merely been ignoring the subtle snubs of M0 by us CT fans.
And, personally, I couldn\'t care less about Eris\' campaign setting. I don\'t
mind the T4 rules discussions (even though I shall never use them again,
they are too broken, lest some MAJOR changes arise), but I thought I had
made it patently clear I am not interested in M0. I await M1000/M1100. The

players adequately. And there HAVE been complaints about FF&S/BL style

I work in the computer games industry, which in many ways these days is a
kissing-cousin to the movie industry.  I don\'t know that I agree with
Stephen _completely_, but what he says has the ring of truth.  

The best movie I know about the movie industry, btw, is "The Player."
Forget about the murder story and watch everything else.  Toooooo true.

[And now, quotes from my short time in the US movie industry, as an extra 
in Apocalypse Now:

Francis Ford Coppola: "Can you, you know, quack like a duck?"

My friend Kent, of the Playboy Bunnies: "Are those _real_?"

My one line in the movie, said to Martin Sheen, and left on the cutting
room floor: "Good morning."

Thank you, thank you very much... ]

interested in all incarnations of the game and would be disappointed if
the TNE people were run off. Besides I sort of like the plot idea, I just
wish the game system was more like CT. 

Now, time to get out of the light and back into the shadows.

To go out on a limb: There has been some work published that suggests that
far from being a rare and random event that the formation of amino acids from
primordial soup is almost inevitable, and that the amino acids will combine
into a replicating molecule every time.*  Therefore it follows that any
planet that has a primordial soup will evolve life to fit the enviroment. The
question remains, what kind of life? 

This theory is somewhat on the lunatic fringe and I have problems with it but
it has great Traveller potential.

As a side note: Examination of the Gaia Hypothosis and Dr. Margolin\'s work on
synergistic evolution seems to suggest that the the two processes are
concurrent (should that be hyphenated?). I.e. once life has been sparked it
begins to change the character of the planet\'s evolution and as the planet
evolves, life changes and adapts and so on and so on ad infinitum ad
nausea...

1.  _Cosmic Computer_, _Space Viking_, _Four Day Planet/Texas Planet_,
_Uller Uprising_, the collections _Empire_ and _Federation_, and the
"Fuzzy" books, all by H. Beam Piper.  You\'ve got to like an SF author
whose middle name is \'Beam\'!!!

2.  The Five Demon Princes novels by Jack Vance.  A true classic of the
genre.  Go read them.

3.  The Chanur series and Downbelow Station by C. J. Cherryh.

4.  _Protector_ by Larry Niven.  This book suggests to me what Yaskoydray
would be like.  IMHO, of course (I know lots of people don\'t like
Grandfather at all and would rather do without him...)

5.  The Foundation/Robots series from Isaac Asimov.

6.  _Space Cadet_ by RAH.

7.  The first Stainless Steel Rat book, by Harry Harrison.

8.  The (neverending) Dumarest of Terra series by E.C. Tubb.  This one
isn\'t necessarily the greatest read, but it has a large number of
Travelleresque touches, like Low Berths, Nobles, mostly Human-dominated
worlds, Slow Drug, etc.

I can keep going for a long time... :)

So post something!  Do a write up of a world, start a discussion on
political tension between the Duke of Regina and The Duchess of Mora, hold
forth on Sword World Military tactics..

NOBODY IS STOPPING YOU!

It seems to me, that you expecting the rest of us to cater to your
desires/needs.  Sorry, but it doesn\'t work that way.  As I pointed out
before, this list depends on its members for content.  You want something,
you write a post, and start the ball rolling.  If that ball don\'t roll, then
you\'re on your own.

Please don\'t take this as a flame, but I can\'t recall you doing much more
than complain.  Maybe you\'ve been brillant in some of the threads I don\'t
follow, but in my experience, you are known for complaining about what other
people are (or are not) doing than contributing to the list.

I initially tried to respond to TD #1020.  Can\'t tell if I
got onto the TML.  Please confirm receipt of this message.

Have just read my first copies of Traveller Digest...Neat Stuff

Have been a CT fan - player - referee since 1977.

Some thoughts on several of the flowing topics...

CANON --  I don\'t follow what the Pope says, so why should
I follow what the rule books say?  They\'re just guidelines.
Players and I have always had fun bending, molding, shaping
the rules to suit our vision of the universe.  Why should I
change now?  Our only limits are our imaginations.  Wasn\'t
there a famous Terran cadet that changed the "rules" to win
a Starfleet Exercise?  I guess I\'m just a space viking.

MOUSETRAPS -- that\'s what I think of the T4 refinements(?) to
weapons\' damage.  Keep the rules simple.  Emphasize role
playing.  Realism is for Wargamers (and I\'m one of those,
also).  IMO, the best combat system came out of Ashanti High
Lightning.  Roll to hit, roll to kill -- light, medium, heavy.
Quick and dirty, then move on to role playing.

FEMALE PCs -- the best _role_player_ I met and interacted
with was female.  Role playing was more important to her
than combat.  Most young male gamers tend towards the
"Drunk Grunt" syndrome.  I\'ve always discouraged this MO
and required finesse and quality role playing.  This lady\'s
player character eventually went on to form her own
mercenary company that built its own Billion Credit
Squadron....after five years of full weekend role
playing.  Okay, maybe I was a little to easy a referee.
But we focussed on having fun.  Besides, I want the PCs
to win and conquer space, not whimper in the corner.

As I recall, when I first started with CT, the group
I was with in North Dakota was 50/50 male to female.
Many gamers were husband and wife teams.  And because
of this, my wife even became involved in RPGing.

My wife would tell you that women in RPGames don\'t
get the respect they deserve.  They\'re either treated
as bimboes or playthings.  I think with a 50/50
mix the ladies kept me honest and on my toes.  Don\'t
piss the ladies off. 
 

800T MERC CRUISER -- In response to Wes Payne 
and the 800T Merc Cruiser.

We solved the cutter problem because we felt the
800T MC Broadsword design was too small for its own good.
We upgraded to a 1000T High Guard design using two 50T cutters,
adding two additional LSP modules for the cutters
and made them a side to side, slide-in//slide-out design.

Like Wes says,
you need to launch the cutters before a surface landing.
This is just good operating practice and smart to
provide the landing operation a HighGuard.  Proper 
mission planning is critical.  Launching the cutters
after just entering a system may be neccesary, if
not required.

BLADED WEAPONS in Traveller
My version of the Marine Sword is ceremonial at best.
A throwback to the flash of the Terran USMC and Royal
Marines.  Yet it took a rather morbid turn in its
history.  As more and more Solomani Forces made their
way across the galaxy, more and more Marines were
lost in combat.  Marines too wounded to be returned
space-side were given a coup d\'grace in the heart by
their bunk mate.  Their bodies were interned planet-side
and the sword was then return to Sol to be buried on
Terra near the Iwo Jima Memorial.  This shrine was
destroyed when the Third Imperium took Terra....We\'ll be back.

similar to Accrete, except that gives you Traveller UWPs.

	Well, I\'ve been messing around with Accrete a fair bit too, and
I\'ve been getting a fair number of habitable planets.  I\'ve been saving the
more interesting systems.  I can send you some if you like.


	Trouble with Accrete is, it doesn\'t allow you any sort of input
into the starting parameters of the system; you can\'t tell it to take a
blue supergiant, say, with a habitable earth-sized planet around a
superjovian, and take that ball and run with it.  And there\'s no graphic
output; schematics would be nice...

	It\'s pretty trippy, though: Accrete has been around for a long
time; first version IIRC was run on some primitve mini by Carl Sagan and
some other guy, and took ages to run by modern standards... whereas my
68LC040 Mac just rips through it.

This is a nice lead-in to a question I\'d like to see the group discuss:
Would you have any interest in a hypothetical online Traveller game?  And
if so, what does "online Traveller game" mean to you?  What would you
expect, want to see, want to avoid seeing, etc.?

Actually that theory has been discounted. It turns out that the
gravitational attraction of the moon isn\'t strong enough to remove
that much atmosphere in only a few billion years.

Earth is a rarity because it has just the right atmosphere, mass
and distance from its primary to become "class M".

You bet I\'m interested. I\'ve been refereeing CT/MT for about 15 years
(off and on) but haven\'t been a player in a while. "Online" for me
would mean email, since I don\'t have the time to sit for hours logged

Weeeell, not quite. A couple months ago I worked with the developer of
Accrete and asked him to allow some input. He sent me a zipped file of
version 3.0 which allows the physical aspect of the main world to be
keyed in (I think). I have yet to unzip it though but I\'ll be happy to
send the file to anyone who wants to play with it.

Alpher/Solomani Rim:  Crashland City News Service

  The results of the recent THUDDD shipbuilding contest recently stirred up
controversy within the ranks of local shipbuilding concern Custom Built
Wreckage, a source within the company reported early this week.
  "We were forced to look hard at our operations and company hierarchy,"
company vice president Palmer Eldritch said.  Of particular concern were
the comments of one critic, who was reported to have said "no self
respecting pilot would buy a ship from a company named \'Crash\'."  The
comment was "very disturbing," Mr Eldritch told the CCNS.  "Needless to
say, there will be some changes in the future."
  One such change, which was announced earlier this week, is to the
company\'s name, which will be known from today on as Maximum Burn IG. 
  Following the announcement, Dictator-for-Life and Company President
Grabow Freem called a press conference wherein he decried the changes, and
announced that any future alterations to the company\'s philosophy, logo,
name, or corporate structure would take place "over my dead body!".
  Funeral services for Mr Freem are expected to be held next week.

  The Viper is a light, fast landing craft designed to carry two squads of
marines or mercenaries into hot or cold drop zones from orbit.  It carries
a single, 4 Std ATV or G-Carrier and 16 troops, 2 squad leaders and their
equipment.  The vehicle bay opens to the rear of the craft so the vehicles
can be released without launching the Viper from its carrier.
  The ship uses Contragrav units in addition to its Thruster drives in
order to get the maximum possible accelleration under planetary assault
conditions.  Its wings are designed to fold close to the fuselage of the
ship for easy storage within a docking ring or hangar.

   The history of Terra from 1130 to 1202 is detailed in Traveller
Chronicle #11 (the sector stats are in TTC #10).  Back issues of
Traveller Chronicle are available from Sword of the Knight Publications
(http://members.aol.com:80/swrdknght/sok.htm).  Someone in History of
the Imperium Working Group (HIWG) detailed the post-Collapse Vland
sector, but so far as I know it never made it to print.  As for
Capital....

   It is at the center of the so-called "Black Curtain".  GDW never
published exactly what happened there, but a select few of us know what
they had in mind (at least back in 1992).

   True holocaust.  Time is measured in terms of what happened before,
and what happens after.  Civilizations are transformed--some collapse
under the pressure, and new ones are created.

   When we look at the Holocaust (the real one), we see many parallels. 
Many unique ethnic communities (most Jews, some not) across Europe were
uprooted destroyed by the Nazis.  Those individuals that survived the
Death camps were transformed by their experience.  Ultimately many of
the surviving European Jews immigrated to the Holy Land, where they
created a new society which incorporated all their different cultural
backgrounds and influences.  The result was of course Israel.

   Anyone trying to claim the Reformation Coalition is the Israel of the
New Era will be subject to a lecture from my virtually Jewish (my wife
will testify to this) Italian mother-in-law.

Location table. Glad you find it useful.

I recently realized that the table is rather more detailed than  is
entirely necessary. For game purposes, being hit in one part of the leg or
another is unlikely to make much difference. As someone suggested (many
months ago), why not just reduce things down to a few general locations,
such as "Leg". This leaves us with a location roll of a single D6! The new
simplified version follows.

I\'ve noticed that during the heat of battle, there is a tendency to forget
to roll for hit location, or ignore it as unnecessary detail that slows
down the game. But I think location is important, especially in terms of
armor - some characters forget to wear their helmets, some only wear armor
vests, etc.

If I ever get my own campaign off the ground, I\'m going to make hit
location part of the \'to hit\' roll: I just add a third die to my D66 Task
Roll system, for a D666 (!). The first two dice are the \'to hit\' roll, the
third die is the location.

Referees should excercise a lot of discretion with this table (or the
detailed version), especially when adding damage per round for internal
wounds, artery hits, etc. This extra damage can all too easily and quickly
kill your PCs. It depends on what kind of game you want to play.
Swashbuckling, StarWars-esque gamers would do well to avoid using hit
location entirely - it tends toward the gruesome and deadly. Realist
referees who want players to sensibly keep their helmets on and heads down
should definitely use a hit location system such as this. I\'m definitely in
the second camp - I feel that a sense of \'real\' mortal danger adds greatly
to the excitement of a firefight.

Referees might want to add sub-tables for more specific locations. For
instance, even a Minor Wound to the Head/neck might call for a roll on a
"Head/Neck Table", to ascertain if the hit impairs the PC\'s vision. But if
you want this level of detail, you might as well use the original long
version of the Hit Location table.

Without further ado, 1D Hit Location...

Roll one die for location. A specially colored die is suggested, so that
the roll to hit and the location roll can be made simultaneously.

A Spectacular Success on the roll to hit allows the attacking player to
select the location, at referee\'s discretion.

Then roll damage, reducing dice if location is armored.

If no stats are reduced to zero by the hit, see "Superficial" for any
secondary effects of the wound.

If 1 stat is reduced to 0, see "Minor" wound effect. Minor Wound effects
such as fractures (Frac) and impaired organs (Impd) are temporary and will
heal completely with proper medical attention.

If 2 stats are reduced to 0, see "Major" wound effect. Even with proper
medical attention, Major Wound effects can result in the character being
permanently impaired, depending on med facility Tech Level.

When rolling damage, any roll of two sixes is a Critical Hit, even if no
stats are reduced to 0. At the referee\'s discretion, any large amount of
damage may be considered a Critical Hit, whether two sixes are rolled or
not.

Generally, effects are cumulative: if a Major Wound is received,
Superficial and Minor effects are also applied.

Most hits are received on the side nearest the attacker. When needed, roll
1D or Right (1-3) or Left (3-6).

Where two effects are listed (such as "Frac/Impd"), the referee should
select the most appropriate. Obviously, higher damage implies more serious
effects.

Secondary Wound Effects:

   #p/r = character receives additional points of damage per subsequent
round, until medical attention is received. At referee\'s discretion, extra
damage might cease before character dies.
   Fall = Might not be automatic (see Stopping Power, below). Might incur
extra damage, usually 1pt, depending on situation.
   Drop Items = At referee\'s discretion, a Difficult test of Dexterity may
be called for. Failure causes character to drop items carried. Note that
many firearms are designed to make them difficult to drop.
   Stun = Stunned characters cannot attack or move for 1 round, longer in
the case of more serious wounds. Might require rest to recover fully.
   Frac = Fracture. Referee may decide on specific bone fractured.
   Impd = Impaired function (see above).
   Heart = Heart injury causes additional damage. Usually accompanied by
fractured ribs.
   Artery = Major artery hit, causes additional damage.
   Amp  = Potential amputation; if large amount of damage received in a
single hit, amputation might occur, at referee\'s discretion. If so,
character receives further 1 to 3 pts damage per subsequent round until
medical attention received. Energy weapon hits do not incur extra damage,
as the wound is automatically cauterized.
   Lung = Lung puncture, causes additional damage. Usually accompanied by
fractured ribs.
   Throat = Throat wound impairs breathing, causes additional damage.
   Intl = Internal organ hit, causes additional damage.
   Conc = Cerebral concussion. Either mild, causing headaches, or serious,
causing migraines, dizzyness, seizures, etc. Severity increases if
character loses consciousness.
   Brain = At referee\'s discretion, effects may include partial or total
paralysis, coma, speech impairment, blindness, personality change,
seizures, etc, depending on amount of damage taken and swiftness of medical
attention.
   Spine = Almost always causes paralysis. Extent and severity to be
determined by referee.

For hits from automatic fire, shotguns, or explosives, it is generally
assumed that the rolled hit location is for the most serious of a group of
wounds (which are not rolled).

If the "Stopping Power" house rule* is being used, head and leg hits incur
a negative DM when character rolls to remain standing. Any roll of two ones
is a Spectacular "Success" - in which case the character not only remains
standing, but is not immediately aware that he or she has been hit,
regardless of the amount of injury sustained!

[*House rule: Stopping Power: Any weapon (except lasers) rated at 5D damage
automatically knocks a character prone. Weapons rated at 2D-4D damage:
defender must roll vs. Dex. when hit, even if armor absorbs all the
damage.]

House rule: Skill Assignment: A character may choose to divide combat skill
levels between the roll to hit and the location roll, instead of applying
all levels to the roll to hit. Thus, a PC with Pistol 4 may choose to have
a +2 DM to hit, and a +2 or -2 DM to the location roll, raising it to aim
high (for more critical locations) or lowering it to aim low (to knock
down, or to mimimize damage). Skills Assignment is generally not possible
beyond the weapon\'s effective range. The Skill Assignment rule does not
necessarily replace the T4 "Aimed Shots" rule.

heavier swords also had points, so a Barbarian would not be totally

That\'s actually not a bad assessment, though it neglects the effects of an
ecosphere on moderating planetary environment.  For a recent statistical
analysis of the occurence of habitable planets, check Martyn J. Fogg\'s
article from a few years back (1994-5?) in Journal of the British
Interplanetary Society.

That\'s an old theory from the 1950\'s, no longer considered valid.  The
latest gee-whiz thought about the Moon is that it aided the development
of life by creating large tides, thus replenishing tidepools where early
life was getting started.  (Solar tides alone are about 1/3 of the effect,
though, IIRC -- maybe the Moon just helped move things along).

I\'d say Harry\'s a real monster! ;->

Ok, comments...a flat 3 seems a little too high, but it has the benefit of
being simple.  

Alternative ideas

1.  Rather than write down skill levels just directly add three to
    skill experience total each time you gain that skill.  Simpler
    than a multiplication at the end.
    
2.  4/3/2/1-1-1 First level of skill is worth 4, second is worth 3,
    etc.  Boosts low levels, but keeps top end from blowing out the
    scale.  Mid level PC\'s match up pretty well with your scale.  It
    also models learning curve better than a flat 3.

3.  Aptitudes for each skill (you knew I had to throw this one in
    didn\'t you ;->).  First time a skill is gained roll 2d6 and
    write the number down next to skill name, this is your Skill
    Aptitude.  Each time a skill level is gained roll a 1d6, add it
    and your Skill Aptitude to your total experience for that skill.
    Your Target Number is Attribute + (Skill\'s Experience)/5,dn.
    The division need only be done and written on the Character
    Sheet after character generation, and when a player gains
    experience in that skill.  Example:
    
      Skill     Aptitude  Total/5=Sk pts
    Melee Combat  _7_     __37_    _7_
    
    This method gives you an average increase of 10.5 experience
    points (2.1 + Attribute) on each skill gain.  This is less than
    your 3, but with the randomness built in there is a range from
    low averages about 5 to high averages around 15 (or 1 to 3) for
    each increase.
    
With the last method (or a modification of it) we can setup an experience
system where PC\'s in play can gain several experience points before
increaseing their target number..if Jo has a 37, then she needs to gain 3
more points before her Skill number goes up from 7 to 8.

Glenn, I like it!  I\'ll be using this...or something *like* this. 

Now, how about a radical idea...use a 1d10 for the Location? That way you
won\'t have to worry about a different color die.  There\'s a perfectly good

I haven\'t been participating in this thread because I don\'t know *beans*
about the subject...so I don\'t have a comment, but I do have a question...

The use of broadsword and shield in individual combat died out and was
replaced by rapier and main gauche style combat...right?  Why?

If a sword and shield fighter is so much better than a rapier armed
fighter, why did the change take place?  Was it the pistol and musket?  Was
it improvements in metallurgy allowing thin thrusting weapons that would
stand up to the slashing broadswords?  Was it simply a change in style..it
became "old fashioned" to tote that big shield around?

The odds for different hit locations only really make sense if you
consider each shot "aimed" for the opponent\'s chest (hence the 67%
chance of hitting the trunk or head/neck region).

=46or hit locations struck without such intent to aim for the chest (as
with explosions and some animal attacks), a different table might be
required... something along the lines of 1=3DL.Leg, 2=3DR.Leg, 3=3DL.Arm,
4=3DR.Arm, 5=3DChest, and 6=3DHead.

Just MHO.

I have always considered the T4 experience system broken, and Glenn 
knows this.  I do intend to shift my attention towards making a 
better xp system after I get this task system bugged out.

To answer your statement above, I have always, no matter what task 
system I used, intended to fix the way characters receive experience.

That is an interesting idea.  It\'s going to be a bear to figure out

Not true.  If we keep blunt trauma as written, then a butt nekkid 
character (being hit by a 6 D6 weapon) will take 3 D6 damage.  A 
character in flex AV3 armor, though, will take 3 D6 + 3 damage.

Now, why are you saying that a character in armor should take more 
damage than a butt nekkid character?

I was impressed with the ideas and scope in TNE.  It was incredibly 
detailed, and I like a lot of detail in my game.

I just can\'t agree with you about the mechanics.  I always think of 
TNE as great idea/bad execution.  

Take the combat system, for instance.  The gradual effect that recoil 
has on a shot or a burst of weapon fire during a round was ingenious. 
 The problem is that they just didn\'t make it too playable.  A 
negative DM, based on your strength and the weapon\'s recoil factor, 
was a great idea.  It was just hard to keep up with all those DMs.

I like the fact that each bullet was rolled for to see if it hit, but 
keeping up with all of those recoil DMs was a nightmare.  And, you 
had to figure it for each weapon the PC used because it might have 
been different.

Then you make a few hit, and for each one, you have to roll on the 
hit location chart.  

The combat round took a long time to play.

I liked the thoughts put into TNE.  I just wish they would have done 
it differently.  It seemed to me the mechanics were clunky.

I\'m glad Traveller has returned to more simple role playing.

No problem there.  3D is the max damage rule.

That\'s correct.  First you check for armor.  Dam - AV.  That is, 
against a person with no armor, 6D - 0 = 6D.

So, the damage to the human character is 6D, but we can\'t break the 
max damage rule, so it\'s reduced to 3D.

> 3. The unarmoured target takes the full 3D

See how this is arrived at above.

> 4a. For a diplo armoured target 3D converts to 3 points damage (1 for
> each die stopped but; blunt trauma)

No.  Penetration is calculated by subtracting armor AV from weapon\'s 
damage.  In your big game rifle example above, this would be:

	6D - 3D = 3D.

This doesn\'t break the 3D max rule, so we are OK.  Damage to 
character is 3D.

> 4b. For a rigid armoured target - No damage

So, under how you are reading it, a big game rifle (6D damage) vs 
rigid AV 3 armor will do no damage?

No.   This will do 3D damage, but no additional blunt trauma damage 
because it is rigid.

> Here is where I lose my way a bit: What is the point of rigid armour
> with an AV greater than 3 (excepting shotguns etc) if AV3 instantly

This is where you are making your mistake.  Let\'s take a big game 
rifle and Flex AV4 armor.  Under the rules as written, you\'d take:

	6D damage - 4 armor value = 2D damage to character.  This does not 
break the max damage rule.  Since it is flex armor, we add one point 
of damage for each die the armor absorbed.  The armor absorbed 4 die 
of damage (the remining two die penetrated the armor and did damage 
to the character).  That means the character takes 2D + 4 points of 
damage.

> OK your shot!

Now that you are reading the rule correctly, let\'s look at two 
characters--one armored, one not.

			Big game rifle vs flex AV 3 armor.

As written, this would be 3D + 3 damage.

			Big game rifle vs no armor.

Because of the max damage rule, the character would only take 3D 
damage.

My fix is to consider blunt trauma damage and not allow it to break 
the max damage rule.

In other words, if the character is already taking 3D damage due to 
no or low armor value, blunt trauma damage is just dropped.

If the damage pentrating the armor is below the 3D mark, then blunt 
trauma damage is figured.

Do you follow me on this?

Well, I didn\'t want to change too drastically from T4.  It was 
obvious to me that Marc is looking to fix the T4 system, so I wanted 
KBv2.0 to resemble that system--not be a totally new concept that he 
wouldn\'t look at.

Thanks.  If we don\'t discover any bugs, I hope he\'ll consider taking a look at
it.

Another good idea.  I\'m being hit with several for the SS/SF

Good idea.  I need to think about an experience system fix while

Actually, KBv1.1 ended up meaning about the same to the target number 
as attributes, so if you look at it that way, KBv1.1 was on a 1:1 
ratio--the skill level was adjusted up and the attribute was adjusted 
down so that they would meet in the middle.  

			Stat-7; Skill-2
			Target Number is 8.

		Stat contributes 4 points to that;  Skill contributes 4 points to 
		that.  In this way, KBv1.1 has both skills and stats contributing 
		about the same to the target number--50%.

In KBv2.0, skills are definitely more dominate than attributes, but 
not by much.

		Stat-7;  Skill-2
		Target Number is 13.

		Stat contributes 7 points of that;  Skill contributes 6 points of 
		that.  This is just about 50% contribution also, but the spread 
		gets much larger at the higher skill levels.

I agree that it needs to be simple, but the method you propose will 
have the chance of SS going up the harder the difficulty.  That 
doesn\'t make sense to me.  I need SS to stay even or go down whereas 
SF needs to stay even or go up.

I haven\'t seen anybody propose (3 X skill) + stat yet.   Also, I 
haven\'t seen anybody talk about starting at 2D and moving up.

As far as starting at 1D, then you\'d have to change all the codes to 
1-6D.  Our target numbers are too high for this.

I tried (2 x skill) + stat, using the 1-6D difficulty codes, but I 
had a problem at the lower end.  Stat-7, Skill-2 characters were 
making Average rolls at 100% and a high percentage on Difficult 
throws.

I knew that wouldn\' do, so I worked with 3 x skill and used the 2-7D 
codes.

The percentages come out good, albeit high level skill is really 
rewarded at the high end.

Marc\'s been talking about putting some type of limit on how many 
skills a character can get.  I don\'t know how yet--maybe the old 
Int+Edu ceiling.  He also said that he would like to try to "fix" 
character generation to where it was not so easy to raise skills to 
level 9 during character generation.

If he can fix this, the high end won\'t be as bad with this system.

As far as changing the title of the Difficult category, I have no 
opinion on that.  Whatever they call them is fine with me.


> Ok, 3 times skill level...simple enough, but 3 is high for a flat rate.

It seems a little high, but look at how many dice you are throwing.  
This actually does two things.  One, it boosts the target number up 
far enough to where we can get good percentages using those dice, and 
two, it does increase the value of skills.

I don\'t care what all the attribute people say.  Skill is more 
important than attribute.  Experience, training, and skill education 
are what improves a person along with natural ability.

I see natural ability as staying somewhat constant, whereas skill is 
increased with practice and learning.

I actually played around with aptitude.  I dropped it for two 
reasons.  One, it is just not in the Traveller rules now and never 
has been.  It\'s a totally new concept, and I think it would be a hard 
sell for Marc.

Second, in my method of using aptitude, I still had the 
(pilot-4/dex-6) vs (pilot-1/dex-10) problem.

Here\'s what I tried.  Instead of using the flat 3 multiplier for 
skills, aptitude for each skill would be chosen.  These would range 
from 0-6--a 0 meaning absolutely no aptitude, and a 6 meaning the 
utmost aptitude.

The difficulty codes stay the same, but the target number calculation 
becomes:

	aptitude + skill + attribute = target number

Can we ask why?  For me it was ideal as a single book of 100 pages.

While nigh on 30 pages more sound goodin theory, if you consider
that the margins of TLWH were very tight, I struggle to imagine
there being very much new material.

Is this simply a way of making more money from the adventure?

     Classic fencing stance is right side forward holding the sword
pointing at the enemy with the left hand back for balance. This is because
the fencers\' sword is their primary defense and that has to be closest to
the enemy. To do a thrust they must either lunge their entire body forward.
     Boradsword fighters (generally) stand with the left side forward and
the right side back. This keeps their primary defense (their shield)
closest to the enemy. To do a thrust/strike they just have to swing rather
than move their body closer or further away.
     That is why fencers get confused initially fighting broadsword and why
broadsword fighters get confused fencing. (ever see a broadsworder throw a
snap-shot with an epee? Ouch!) It only takes a month or two to train out of
it though, so I wouldn\'t over emphasise it.

>With regards to my assertion about the relative strengths of the weapons,

>2) Shields are pretty hard to use in hallways.
     I beg to differ. A hallway isn\'t that much different from a bridge
battle. (Because of the lack of fighters we do a lot of narrow bridge
battles in Ireland :-) It all depends on what sort of action you are
trying. For example at Estrella (the afore mentioned war) I was in this
totally amazing shield wall. Duchess Elena had one row of shields kneeling.
Then a second row standing between them overlapping half-way. Like scale
armour. We withstood five Outland charges and only lost about one or two
people to their twelve per charge.
     So, if you want to hold a position, sheilds are pefrect in a hallway.
You need pole-arm backup, though. You can\'t kill much if you are in a
shield wall. The traveller equivalent of pole-arms would be ranged weapons,
ie. rifles. Place your vanguard of tri-tanium shields in front and have
your snipers shoot around and over them. Developing this:
     Consider a high tec shield. Make it from some high armour value but
light material. A scutum (Roman Refrigerator Door) is probably the best.
Mount a micro-camera and simple inertial relay on the outer surface. That
way if the shieldtroop blinds themself physically the computer can
compenstate by projecting a virtual view onto their heads-up helmet array.
Line the edges so that they can _lock_ with neighbouring shields on user
command. Possibly also with hullmetal walls and floors too. Late imperial
shields might have grav-compensation (like FGMPs) so extra armour-weight
can be carried or else to withstand extra enemy force.
     Then add loopholes. Second rank "pikemen" lock their ACRs into the
loopholes, standing or kneeling. If they are on battle-feed their heads-up
can show them a picture, with target, through the shields the same as the
troopers. They can then fire at will through their defense at the enemy
with very good cover.
     I can\'t think of a better way to take a corridor!

>3) Shields do get in your way when swinging a sword...
     It depends on what you are doing and what sort of sword you use. If
you are using a scutum like war-shield, sure it is rather a challange to
fight around. Also if you are 1-1 with someone they can use your shield for
their defense (I\'ve done this, hee hee).
     However if you have a tourney shield, like a small heater, italian
half-round, round shield or (god forbid) a buckler, there should be little
trouble. I use an italian half-round (bunny round) and I can\'t think of any
shot that I would do substantially differently if I wasn\'t using a shield.
I\'d probably bring my sword position much further forward to pick up some
defense. But then my offense would suffer accordingly.

>4) shields require about half as much training as a sword for effective
use.
I might quibble and say 1/3 :-). However it is an important point that most
people miss: you need training in a shield to use a shield effectively.
Like in AD&D I\'m the only ref I know that makes people take a proficiency
in shield! I\'d probably do the same in Traveller if the subject ever came
up.

Ok, here\'s where we get into the important details. It makes a *major*
difference which *direction* the g-forces are in. Pilots are taking
"vertical" g loads. That is, "down" is from their head towards their
feet.

Astronauts are taking *transverse* g-loads. That is, "down", is from
their chest to their back. 

You can take a *lot* more transverse Gs than vertical ones. 12 g is
about the limit for vertical *80* is the limit for transverse (from
rocket sled tests). 40 tranverse Gs for a short period won\'t do much
worse than give you black eyes. 

Note that "fighters" in *space* will be pulling transverse Gs, not
vertical.

the question: Is the Max.Damage rule race-related? Which races will fit into
the 3D, and which will go to 4D? Will some race qualify for a 2D max.? As a
preliminary thought, I think that maybe Droyne/Chirpers will go for 4D, but
that most of the major races will reasonably be 3D (Aslan, Vargr, most
humans). But, what about Hivers? I do not know much about them, but maybe
their symmetric configuration makes them less prone to receive serious
wounds (several "copies" of important internal organs), and *maybe* they
would be candidates for a 2D max. Dmg Rule.

One thought occurs to me: Wouldn\'t it be possible, using today\'s technology,
to make some sort of light-weight armor sleve/gaultlet that would protect a
swordfighter from a fencing weapon? How about future materials technology?
How much would a crystal-iron gauntlet and greave weigh?

       I agree 100%. I\'ve got SM in july and I am still recovering from the

Rebellion period <g>.

        I do not use TNE rules, either, but like the background, and see
absolutely no reason to vinculate both things. The TNE background, and, for
that matter, any canon/noncanon Milieu, is just background, and you can use
it with whatever rules you like. Even though my favorite Milieu is The
Rebellion (old MT ref...), I am also interested in all the other
backgrounds. But, even if you are not interested in more than one Milieu, it
would always easier to use material from another TRAVELLER Milieu than from
Star Wars, right?

        I am not personally very much interested in the Task system threads,
either, but I like to know that there are people thinking and discussing
hard on that matter, so that if I need to make a decision on the issue, I
can go through past digests and find something useful. And the same applies
to almost every Traveller thread that one is not interested on at the moment.

You did well.  I never did find a humanly habitable planet running that

        Thanks. In order to keep the variety you suggest, I think that it
would be better to relate the humanity/nonhumanity of the minor races to the
humanity/nonhumanity of the major race covered, either to balance all
supplementes or to distingush between human-oriented sourcebooks and
nonhuman-oriented ones.
        Anyway, four races seem too much for a book if you really want
detail. A 96-page book could be easily split in 48-24-24 for useful material
on a major and two minor races, but tha page count could drop too much with
more races involved. One possibility is to include the less important races
as a "colour addition", let\'s say for a page count of 46,23,23,4 or
soemthing similar.

        Of course I have to argue in favor of the Geonee here, but that
makes too much human races in the volume. Nevertheless, Milieu-zero seems to
be the most human-dominated of the Milieux, right? The Newts would be an

        Well, the Answerin are surrounded by Vilani, not Vargr. As for the
"new one", recall the Hhkar, in the middle of the Julian area.

        I would definitely argue for Vilani/ Suerrat&Geonee as a Milieu 0
background book, but, as an alternative, given that what IG currently plans
is Aslan/Vargr, I would suggest to keep the Vargr as an upcoming release and
publish TWO books featuring Vilani, Vargr, and the more M:0 relevant minor
races. After all, the Vargr are known since Ziru Sirka times, right?
        A proposal could be:

        VILANI / Geonee  / Newts / Bonus: Answerin
        VARGR  / Suerrat / Hhkar / Bonus: Brinn

        i.e. one major race plus two minor (one human, one nonhuman)
supplement, and one bonus (human first, nonhuman second).

>ASLAN (heralding Milieu:200, I\'d suppose) rings in those honor-bound

        Hmmmm.... in Milieu:200, the Geonee are just a group of absorbed
worlds, after the Pacification Campaigns, but their presence as an Imperial
race would certainly be significant rimward. Specially, as "fleeing
refugees" from Imperial occupation. The Gerontocracy of Ormine seems
interesting, although I am not sure they have been developed too much, but
who are the Ahetaowa? I would rather see here the Darrian, which have a 10%
of biological Aslan after the 600\'s. This makes theem not strictly M:200,
but makes the book more coherent. As for a Bonus, I would like to see a
write-up on the Zhodia colonies, those biologically human Aslan.
        I.e., ASLAN / Ormine / Darrian / Bonus: Zhodia colonies

>SOLOMANI provides information on them, whatever minor branch of humaniti

        The perfect place for a "Geeneric" article on Geneered races. And,
as a Bonus, what about some words on the Solomani-originated Sword Worlders?
        That is, SOLOMANI / Vegans / Geneered races/ Bonus: Sworld Worlders.

(Snip Hivers / K\'kree books: too soon to speak of them, right?)

>ZHODANI writes them up, plus the Darrians, and the Addaxur, and some 
>	new bunch.
        What about the Vlazhdumecta?. That would be instead of the Darrians
(which I prefer in the Aslan book). As for some new bunch, and as a bonus,
maybe it would be interesting to see something on a minor race splitting
from a major one different from humanity... let\'s say the
psionically-oriented, feared Roth Thokken, plus some words on the
Zhodani-influenced Vargr psionics.

        So: ZHODANI / Vlazhdumecta / Addaxur / Bonus: Roth Thokken

>DROYNE lays out the castes and structure, describes, presumably, some

        "Some Droyne/Chirper-connected offshoot of humaniti..." the Geonee
qualify quite well here, but I don\'t see them in the Droyne book. It would
be good to see the Chirpers as a minor race, with specific details of their
generation. After all, most characters do not know about their connection.
And, this will save space on the Droyne part to speak about the Ancients period.
        The Droyne are scattered all around, so it could be interesting to
put some also scattered, bizarre races with them, e.g. the Jigd-Il-Jagd
(warning: probable misspelling). As for humans, well...... I do not really
see any interesting minor human race fitting here. I would rather see, as a
bonus, details on the forgotten race whose Gaadaskikaduu ruins were shown in
Knightfall. IIRC, they were known as the "primordials".

        To summarize, a proposed plan would be:

        1. VILANI / Geonee  / Newts / Bonus: Answerin
        2. VARGR  / Suerrat / Hhkar / Bonus: Brinn
        3. ASLAN / Ormine / Darrian / Bonus: Zhodia colonies
        4. SOLOMANI / Vegans / Geneered races/ Bonus: Sworld Worlders
        5. ZHODANI / Vlazhdumecta / Addaxur / Bonus: Roth Thokken
        6. DROYNE / Chirpers / Jigd-Il-Jagd / Bonus: Primordials

        Maybe we could reach a consensus and forward it to IG before they
release that Aslan/Vargr book... ;-)

Alpher/Solomani Rim:  Crashland City News Service

  Local shipbuilder Maximum Burn IG announced the completion of its
first major new warship design today, the Tencendur-class Cruiser. 
The new cruiser is designed to carry light mercenary units or strike
teams into low-intensity combat areas.  It mounts an impressive
arsenal of weaponry and defenses, and can hold its own in ship-to-ship
actions.
  Design specs were released concurrently with the press announcement:

Vehicle Crew

Crew Quarters:	43 Small Staterooms (Crew, Squad Leaders, Vehicle and
Flight Crew)
			32 Bunks (Troops)

  The Tencendur Cruiser is built using the same hull design as the
Kestrel-class Cruiser (rolled out late last year by CBW, Inc) and
makes extensive use of automation to reduce crew complement.  Each of
the weapon batteries are controlled from the bridge by MFDs, but can
be locally controlled if necessary and if enough crew is available.
  Subordinate craft carried are two Viper-class Assault Landing Craft,
each with its own docking ring.  The Viper craft are designed to fit
into standard 50 Std docking rings, so if necessary, standard 50 Std
Modular Cutters can be used instead.  The docking rings are partially
open to the bottom to allow quick release of the dropships.  Each
dropship carries one military-type G-carrier or APC.
  The cargo hold is capable of carrying heavy military equipment and
other cargoes, such as ammunition and artillery.
  The ship is capable of providing orbital fire support for ground
units, using the missile battery and long-range sensors.  Its jamming
suite is capable of performing stand-off jamming operations and
providing ECM coverage for ground and space units in addition to
standard assault fire support missions.

  The Viper is a light, fast landing craft designed to carry two
squads of marines or mercenaries into hot or cold drop zones from
orbit.  It carries a single, 4 Std ATV or G-Carrier and 16 troops, 2
squad leaders and their equipment.  The vehicle bay opens to the rear
of the craft so the vehicles can be released without launching the
Viper from its carrier.
  The ship uses Contragrav units in addition to its Thruster drives in
order to get the maximum possible accelleration under planetary
assault conditions.  Its wings are designed to fold close to the
fuselage of the ship for easy storage within a docking ring or hangar.

    It all has to do with social class and structure. A noble was basically
someone who could field troops for their monarch. This was done differently
in different ages.
    In the Dark and Middle ages the nobles lead their troops personally
from their own lands. Peasants trooped around with shields, simple helmets,
and spears, axes and the like. The nobles went around with proper armour,
shields and swords. Consequently when it came to dues (al la Ivanhoe) that
is what they fought with.
    Later in the renaissance a noble was more likely to pay for troops with
their cash rather than raise and lead them personally. Peasants now trooped
around with pikes while officers and nobles discarded their armour due to
obselescence of gunpowder. In this era a noble\'s military prowess was more
tactics and face to face slogging. You also no longer displayed ones wealth
by having expensive armour but rather by having expensive clothes.
Consequently when duels were then fought the used the more courtly weapons
they were familiar with: rapier.

  If you put a Middle age broadsword and shield fighter against a
renaissance rapier and main gauche my bets would be on the broadsword and
shield. However there were very few social contexts in the renaissance
where you could comfortably lug around the appropriate middle age
equipment!

  If you trace further down history you find duels being fought with
pistols for a similar sequence of reasons.

  In a traveller setting the only weapon you can bear in polite society is
a sword. This is why duels are fought with swords. [In my own campaign
there are high-tech swords as well, like vibro-swords and light-sabres :-]

I believe the idea was that the average person will be more likely to buy 
a smaller, less-expensive adventure than a larger, $24 adventure.  Thus, 
splitting it into 2 parts, and having some resolution at the end of the 
first part.  If they want to go on and buy the second,great. If not, they 
still have a suitable adventure.

So sayeth Tim Brown.

The hints were given that planets that had a history at low tech (such
as Terra did, from 0 to 15 with examples kept in museums), were better
able to survive the collapse than others, because in many cases they had
written records they could bootstrap with, or use as fallback positions.

In my campaing, terra had formed the New Earth Union, a Tech 13 pocket
empire. (small pocket empire).

I strongly suspect that the same will have happened for Vland, and other
homeworlds where all tech levels were progressed through.

In some cases perhaps, but I think homeworlds have a much greater chance
of survival, and even recovery (to a small extent)

In my campiagn the Vegans were still kicking around, many of them
remebered the collapse (200yr lifespan), and have been able to recover
with remarkable speed. Unfortunately they are all smarting from the
centuries of injustice applied by humanity, this virus thing being the
final straw. 
Humanity can go to hell, the time of the Vegans is here.

Actually William, I was trying to point out (and poorly at that), that
it is ALL real background, and I would like to see it ALL supported one
way or the other.
I think this Mileu Zero stuff is really exiting, at the moment I have
the Imperial interests in one subsector being opposed by the Sustan
Republic, heres some library data on them.


Sustan Republic (-350 to 10) 
Hostile Interstellar Republic on the borders of the Third Imperium. 
The Sustan Republic was formed when the Sustan colony of the Perdash
Kingdom declared it\'s independence and formed itself into a Republic.
It\'s main effect was the overthrow of the Solomani aristocracy of the
world, and the establishment of an elected system of government with two
houses, (a house of congress and a senate), and governed by a President
who is elected every six years.
Sustan Republic policy has been shaped through it\'s history by the
perceived threat of foreign and domestic enemies. In it\'s earliest days
it lived in terror of being reabsorbed by the Perdash Kingdom. It\'s
campaign to ensure it\'s sovereignty was so successful it ended up
incorporating the worlds of the former kingdom into it\'s territory. This
policy has continued to this day, until the Republic takes up just over
four subsectors in territory, and continues to grow, very slowly.
The Republic firmly believes in central control, all worlds of the
Republic are representative democracies, electing a governor for a six
year term, who has control of most of the government of that world, but
not of any Republic facilities or  armed forces, (they do control the
police, and also have the ability to call on the local military
reserves, the National Guard).
The Republic is unique for two reasons. The first reason is that it is
the only other culture that the Imperium has met which has achieved
TL-12 by itself since the long night. The second is the Republic regards
any territory outside of a worlds 100 diameter limit as interstellar
territory, and therefore open to all travellers. It bases this on a
tradition that started in it\'s wars with the Perdash Kingdom, and the
fact that most ships make interstellar jumps at the 100 diameter limit.
It has even got some smaller nations on it\'s borders to adopt this
practice as well. Worlds that have not adopted this practice routinely
suffer "freedom of passage" demonstrations by the Republic Navy.
The Republic also believes in not sharing high technology across it\'s
borders to what they term unstable or oppressive governments. (There is
still a lot of paranoia about being taken over by foreign nationals).
The Republic has probably grown as large as is possible for a
centralised form of government. Much more growth is impossible without
the fragmentation of the state. The Republic and the Imperium only began
interacting about two years ago but in that time the Republic has grown
to view he  Imperium is viewed as the greatest threat to democracy and
freedom.
The Imperium views the Republic as a threat to it\'s continued expansion
into territories previously held by the rule of man. Diplomatic moves to
have the Republic voluntarily incorporated into the Third imperium is
met by fierce opposition. The main sticking point being the abolition of
the office of the president, the senate, the congress and the
reestablishment of the Nobility on all worlds of the Republic. Imperial
policy on the Republic is in flux at the moment. The Imperium has
problems on other borders, and can\'t yet afford a protracted military
campaign to incorporate the worlds of the Republic. That may change in
the near future. 


I have also ingnored canon, and made the Third imperium encompass 9
subsectors by year 10, and are being pressed on other (at the moment
vague) borders.

When my players read the data on the Republic, some of them asked "Hey,
why aren\'t we fighting for them?"

They were all Naval Officers, in a military campaign.

I guess memories of the Federation die hard sometimes.

It\'s all real Traveller, CT, MT, TNE, T4. (although I will guiltily
admit that I only played two versions without my own house rules, a free

Use a MT task system and it plays much, much better. The ship combat
system has potential, as long as they get rid of those hopelessly
uninformative ship descriptions, and fix the armor values so they
correspond to vehicles and personal armor.

Oops.  Thanks!  I just checked, and it\'s an 800-ton hull that needs the 32
ton drive (900-ton hull would need a 36-ton drive for J3, which IS on the
table).

You can use the 35-ton drive for J3 in an 800-ton hull, or you can
interpolate, or you can even double the stats for a 16-ton drive and it\'ll
be OK.

The semi-mythical Next Version of QSDS will include this fix (it\'ll probably
include a smaller table of drives - so that 500-dt J6, 600-dt J5, 700-dt J4,
800-dt J3, and 900-dt J3 all use the same drive (for a much shorter drive
table).

WOW!! now that\'s what I call numerical discrepancy.
Did you win?
If you did, you must be a Western Knight, or carried a Rattan FGMP.

	Hmm. Members of Wuanian leader class probably consider

	As far as I remember, the mere existence of a "master
	race" (uplifted humans) led to a mass hysteria and
	escalating violence. All Solomani boidroids were thought

Primitive muskets were sufficiently powerful that for armor to have a

Eventually, the required thickness of armor made armor too impratical
(too heavy for anything more than a breastplate and helmet).  In these
circumstances, a man armed with a slender blade could "shaving-nick" his
opponent to death <g>.

This is, of course, a very abbreviated explanation.

	The short answer is D:) All of the above. If you look at the
development of the sword, there is a progression, pretty much, from wide
heavy slashing swords to skinny lighter thrusting ones (in a manner of
speaking..single handed swords never weighed much more than a few pounds) 
as armor technology improved, mostly during the transition between
chainmail to plate. 

	Gunpowder pretty much started making heavy armor
obsolete, so people stopped carrying shields, pretty much, which led to
the wider use of thrusting swords, and the longsword evolved into the
rapier.

	Finally, fashion played a part in it, as well. Those wacky
Elizabethans were slaves to fashion, and sword styles and fencing styles
were part of that.

Accrete2 allows you to input the mass and luminosity of the star.. It also
seems overly fond of type E atmospheres and A hydrographics..  I did an
entire subsector and came up with two marginally habitle worlds.

That should read "An Tir Knight."  Easy mistake to make. :)

Ooof, now I\'m varying across two kingdoms (currently living in the West,
but once you\'ve lived in An Tir...), thousands of years, and several TLs on
this list...  (Trebuchet as spinal mount, anyone? :) )

ObTrav:  Do you have any King Arthur-like or El Dorado-like legends
populating the cultural background of, say Solomani space?  

Hmmm.  Anyone ever read any of Tim Powers\' books?  (_The Anubis Gates_, _On
Stranger Tides_, _The Stress of Her Regard_, _Expiration Date_)  For you
heretics out there, his take on things might be _very_ interesting, if for
nothing else than for a quasi-Cthuloid detour from your standard scenario.

OK, I\'ll jump in on this one too <G>  

There are currently several PBeM games going that I am aware of,
directly or peripherally.  There are also some IRC games going.

I am personally running a PBeM game, so is Paul Walker, Eris Reddoch,
Peter Miller, and Tim Reynolds.  There is also a game that Stuart was
playing in, but I don\'t know who is running that one.  The medium is
great, as long as you allow for the necessary assumption that games
progress slowly, however, it does allow for excellent character
development and a high level of detail.  I am participating in three
games other than the one I\'m running.  I must enjoy it <G>

IRC is another animal completely.  It is subject to the same vagaries
of player absenteeism as ftf games, and, depending on the server used,
the vagaries of the net.  Stuart, Allen Shock and J.D.Burdick are
running the three games I am aware of.  We use IG\'s server and the
game times are posted on IG\'s website.

In either case, if you are interested in starting or joining a game,
please email me your intentions.  I am working with IG to have a page
of games in progress and a waiting list for players who desire to join
a game and refs who are beginning a game and looking for players.  I
think there are alot more of us who would use this medium to play, if
we had the opportunity.  In my case it is because I work full time and
have two small children.  FTF opportunities are few and far between. 

Do you want me to go into what I feel is necessary to ensure a good
PBeM game?

70 of them in the last two days, mainly about the *&^%$%$=A3! task system)
that T4 has a reputation of being broken. I\'m sorry to say this, but it\'s
true over here in the UK too. At my local games club (approximately forty
players) I am one of only two who\'ve bought the rules. And I\'m the only
active ref - the other guy bought it thanks to memories of CT. Now, amongst
my group of five players, no one else has bought the rules thanks to the
rumours that they are broken.

Now, no offense to Marc or IG, but I have to agree - the present ruleset is
not really that good for someone new to traveller, or to someone who\'s only
played TNE. I find it okay, but I\'m playing a T4/MT/CT varient, and have
been playing Traveller since 1983. I would find it hard to recommend the
present rules, particularly with the errors in QSDS. The task system is too
easy, but adopting 1 to 6D seemed a quick enough fix. (I\'ll probably adopt
KBv2.0 sometime soon...).

So the gist of this is, no matter how fast the deluxe edition comes out for
those of us on the TML, it needs to be out there with the general game
buying public almost as fast, and it needs a big sticker on the front
saying "Revised and improved etc", and SOME BLURB ON THE BACK so newbies
(and oldies!) can get an idea of what it contains (something all the T4
supplements lack!).

It could also do with a task system fix, errata, QSDS revision, and a
background chapter covering core (M0) or the Marches (M100? onwards). Sort
of a \'rough guide to the Imperium\'. The Imperial encyclopedia in MT was
very useful for introducing new players ("here\'s your ship\'s computer\'s
library DB").

My game has always had VERY powerful BD, and that is the point.  If you
find yourself facing it... run.  However, sneaky characters can always
find a weak link in whatever they are facing. =20

Some examples:=20
Snappers-- a mid tech device that uses a very powerful battery, combined
with a small gear box and four sharp (monofilament) curved blades that
can be flipped in zero g towards unsuspecting armored opponents.  The
result is that if the snapper hits something it can get a hold of (arm,
leg, neck, weapon, etc.) it snaps shut around it.  Then the gear box
kicks in and starts to wind the blades shut. Anything caught in the
middle will be cut off, or at least punctured.  The chance to "hit" is
low, but if it hits, watch out. (I had one PC blow a hole in her own leg
trying to stop it)

Snagglewire =96 a hang grenade that explodes out with many wires that

the technology increases.

Acid Gun =96 Fires a stream of acid goop that not only sticks but congeal=

in nooks and cracks, dissolving the armors joints. =20

Limpet Mines =96 Nuff said.  But you have to get very close.=20

These are but a few of the ways my PC=92s and NPC=92s have fought BD.  Of
course the most effective way is your own BD, but that is difficult to
get, and too expensive to maintain.

I was working under the assumption that the maximum damge rule was related
to the mass of the target creature.  If there is more of it to hit, the
bullet isn\'t going to come blowing through with such ease.

It might make some sense that a creature which is hardier than the norm, or
has a robust set of internal organs, might have a lower max damge.  The
Hivers are a good example of this, the CT module made it clear that their
internal organs are well protected and have back-ups.

I\'m waiting to see what changes in combat come about in the Emperoer\'s
Arsenal book before I start working up my varient rules.

Now here are some subjects that I would really be interested in.  Can anybody
give me some ideas of what the Sword Worlds political and military structure is
a 1100?  What sort of expansion ambitions do they have?  What are they trying
to accomplish politically or militarily?

I have a few of my own ideas that I use in my CT era campaign, but I don\'t know
if they hold true to the actual history.  I would also be interested in any
other ideas or backgrounds of current or past campaigns.

Battle Dress has an armor value of 8.  A Laser rifle has a damage of 7.
does this mean that BD is invulnerable?  No.  What it means is that it takes
military-class weapons to defeat it.  Emperor\'s Aresenal should have these,
and I\'m working on my own designs as we speak.

Please remember that numerous airliners have been hijacked my one man
claiming to have a hand grenade.. Unless you keep weapons that are capable
of penetrating your own hull on-board, you will be in trouble when that BD
equipped person comes knocking.

Battle Dress is the ultimate expression of armored infantry.  It is the
pinnacle of weapons research, and is so carefully controlled by the Imperium
that the location of BD,A units is *classified*, you just aren\'t going to
run into these things everyday!

Complaining that Augmented BD is to tough is like complaining that Tiamat in
AD&D is too tough.  Both are supposed to be exceedingly hard to defeat.

What do you do to beat someone in BD,A?  Get ahold of a plasma rifle, or a
HEAP greande, or wait for him to take his helmet of and drop him with a
sniper.  Onboard ship, open all the airlocks and blow him out, crank the
grav plates up to 3G, or turn th inertial compensators off and fly an
evasion pattern.  Hell, just spray-paint his visor!

I would imagine the Imperium would have decent "high tech" shields as well.  
Like the SWAT shields, they would not be much good in a running battle, but if 
you are defending a position or trying to advance on a defended position, they 
could be useful additions to the regular armor.  And cheaper, too; why spend

That is very true, and I guess it depends on the style of broadswordwe\'re
talking about. Most of the ones from c400 to c1250 were mainly chop/smash
weapons, while after 1300 you begin to see the rise cut and thrust
longswords that taper to a very fine sharp point. They are almost
proto-rapiers at that point.

Point is well taken...glaives (as well as most polearms) are asskickers.
Unless of course I can get inside your blade distance...ahh advantages and

can go between "airing up." 

I\'ve tried to explain to him that:
1) the efficiency is the same but the higher TLs have reduced the size of the
equipment
2) submarines have more of a need to go longer between refreshing their CO2
exchangers than your typical commercial vessel

Can any of you tech-heads add anything that I missed? I\'ve thought of adding
that the air exchangers require certain chemicals that need to be restocked
periodically. I\'ve already explained filter cleaning to him (especially the
water issue which has been discussed here at length). I\'ve also told him that
the group could bring the ship in and have emergency air tanks installed
(once I work out the specs) along with the aforementioned chemical
refurbishments.
Any help would be appreciated.

The original ACCRETE, way back when (early 70s, I believe, perhaps earlier
than that) was in FORTRAN.  However, the thing\'s been through so many
ports, revisions, hacks, and general unregulated tinkering at this point
that there are probably hundreds of versions out there at this point,
following no consistent naming scheme.  So, my advice:  If you find a
variant you can use, and it seems to produce credible planetary data, be
happy.

That is the 64KCr question. Ask 15 historians and you\'ll get 15 answers. But
roughly, here is my answer.

There are several reasons to start moving toward lighter armor, but the
biggest impetus is gunpowder. The fact that wet-pack gunpowder makes all but
the heaviest (at the time) steel plates useless (and the armor too heavy to
wear or be carried by horseback effectively) means that you might as well
leave the armor home and run as fast as you can. Without Armor, now, the
bladed weapons become lighter and faster to match their faster opponents. 

Also with the rise of duelling, any hit determines a winner. You don\'t have
to murder your opponent, so causing a lethal wound is not always as
desirable as it was back when people wore armor. The blade should be lighter
and faster so as to add depth to your tactics (allowing feints and
second-intention attacks).

Finally, there were some profound metallurgical changes going on. The
evolution of swords started driving toward \'cut and thrust\' style even
before gunpowder was truly effective. A case-hardened tip on a sword could
punch through a breastplate. So once again, the armor was made
obsolete...might as well shed some of it and gain mobility which can be used
almost as well.

	Gunpowder: historically, armour went away real quick as soon as
firearms became relatively effective.  TL-2 armour does not add to your
survivability and subtracts from your mobility in a gunfight, and TL-2
shields are of no use.

	In fact, I\'d argue that shields against gunfire are a bad idea at
any TL.  Anyone here savvy enough to calculate what the kinetic energy from
a military rifle round would do to your shield arm?

	Then there are F&P GMP\'s.  Even assuming a shield that could stop
it, visualize ye interstellar barbarian lying there smoking from the
cauterized stumps of whatever wasn\'t directly\' shielded from the round..:)

	So, once shields and armour were obsolete, there was no need to lug
a bloody great big sword around.  As I\'ve pointed out, you don\'t need
massive amounts of strength to kill a person with a blade... and rapiers
require very little to wield.  So, the fast guys with better technique had
a major advantage, and broadswords, longswords, and big swords in general
went the way of the dodo (although the Scots kept on carrying them longer
than anyone else, out of sheer bloody-mindedness, I suspect).  Hence the
evolution of the rapier.  Cav sabers stayed heavier than duelling swords,
because of the somewhat wild & crazy circumstances in which they were used;
it\'s easier to cut down a fleeing peasant from the saddle with something
long and with a little weight (not too much).

How \'bout this?  The Marines have, over time, developed cutlass use into a
sort of martial art.  They train every recruit in cutlass skill as a form
of physical and mental development, a path to personal discipline and
control.  Some Marines consider this a bit flakey and outmoded, though
none would say this out loud, as a lot of the command staff take it *very*
seriously indeed.  Others become highly devoted to the art, and become
terrifyingly adept with the cutlass.

While normally the art is used in ritualized formal combat competitions,
akin to (though a bit more violent than) fencing or a karate tournament,
the skills taught are by design completely applicable to real combat
situations.

Whaddya think?

Here Here! The mixing of 1 Major w 2-3 minors is a great idea IMO. (I\'ve
always had problems in the past getting "any" Trav books in stores. I\'ve
found one place but they\'re a 45min drive away and only have T4. Old stuff is
impossible for me to find. Mail order doesn\'t work for me because I don\'t
like to buy anything w/o checking it out first.) I feel this combo would
appeal to those of you who have been fortunate enough to get the Majors in

non-American friends here on the TML agree (re scarcity of Trav material in
their homelands)?

Sure!  And also, what about non-PBeM, non-IRC games?  Any interest in

In my campaign the Imperium treats them the same way that the U.S.
treats Cuba. From the SW point of view, though, things are quite 
different. They view the Imperium as interfering with their affairs
and as owning several systems that rightfully belong to the SW.

One of my characters is the format Fleet Admiral of the Gram Navy.
He came up with a detailed history of his character, based on the
character generation process, but embellished it to include political
rivals, comrades-in-arms and the like. 

He and I worked together so that his history matches what\'s considered
"canon". He is also the only person in the group with partial knowledge
of the various naval fleets at the end of 1106. He strongly suspects,
based on the attitudes of the person who replaced him as head of the
Gram Navy, that the Sword Worlds is building up to a military conflict.

This makes for an interesting character to play, since he\'s 
travelling with a group of Imperial citizens through the Spinward 
Marches. He\'s not sure what will happen to him if war breaks out.

By the time I see a post, there\'s usually four or five good responses
already, but I\'m going to chime in on this one anyway.

Rapier/main gauche fencing didn\'t directly replace sword and shield.
Sword and shield was at one time the height of battlefield technology,
and a sword was a good personal defense weapon that could be carried
all the time. As armor developed, one handed swords became less effective
on the battlefield and were supplanted by heavier weapons.

Swords still hung around as personal, everyday defense weapons for the
upper classes, they just didn\'t have that much military usefulness for
a time. Gunpowder weapons developed to the point where full armor became
ineffective, so armor was reduced, then pretty much abandoned for
battlefield use. As armor decreased, swords regained some effectiveness.
Swords and fighting styles developed that could be used against unarmored
targets, such as throats and wrists, and to defend against same.

Gunpowder weapons continued to develop. Pistols became the primary personal
defense weapons, backed up by a sword, then by a big knife, then were
abandoned all together. Swords hung around in armies as symbols of rank,
and in cavalry units, but by the time machine guns appeared, battlefield
use of swords was pretty much history.

I think it\'s interesting to note that in WWI there were lots of fencing
style swords available for the troops in the trenches, but assault troops
were improvising shields and battleaxes out of boiler plate and shovels
for hand-to-hand combat. This suggests that in real life, if given a choice
between fencing with a long blade, expertly thrusting holes into your
enemy\'s vitals, or strapping some armor to one arm and hacking at your 
opponent with a big ugly piece of steel with the other, combat troops
adopted the old sword and shield approach. No one was screaming to be
issued sabers for trench fighting.

    'body' => '   Hi.

   There are two very interesting threads going on right now, old
   obsolete armor and battledress, that I can\'t help think are closely
   related. If plate armor went out of style with the introduction of
   firearms, wouldn\'t battledress go out of style with the introdution
   of cheap, accurate long-range automatic grenade launchers with HEAP
   (High Explosive Armor Piercing) ammunition at TL9-10? These things
   are cheap, man-portable, easy to use, and will absolutely splatter
   any fool in a Cr300,000 stormtrooper costume, not to mention TL5-6
   armored vehicles. I know this for a fact from personal "experience",
   playing and refereeing Traveller with Striker and AHL rules.

   I submit that battledress /is/ militarily obsolete, even before a
   world aquires the TL to first build it. (Auto GL\'s come in at ~TL8,
   BD at ~TL12.) Which raises the question, why do some units use it?
   Possibilities include:

   1) As a bulletproof testosterone supplement for troops assigned to
   slaughter TL6 natives, useful to conquistadors and and to mercantile
   interests out to build banana republics.

   2) As a fashionable and overpriced EVA suit, useful in a few very
   specialized situations.

   3) As a "James Bond" tool for small mobile units attacking small, but
   vital, targets behind enemy lines. (The BD communications suite and
   hosile environment protections will be particularly valuable here.
   Invulnerablility to very small arms doesn\'t hurt either.)

   4) As merchandise for salesmen who ply thousand-dollar vacuum
   cleaners and quarter-million-credit uniforms to foolish consumers and
   newbie player characters.

   5) As fancy old outfits for nobles engaged in pomp and circumstance.

   Whatever the reason, I\'d argue that battledress would NOT be used in
   standard military operations against a well (or even decently) armed
   foe. It\'s too expensive a way to decorate cannon fodder.

   (Someone pointed out that, in CT, a soldier with an ACR could take
   down an opponent in BD, but in Striker/AHL/MT, he stood no chance.
   Let me point out that, during a CT session using Striker rules, it
   was a player\'s use of an ACR\'s underslung grenade launcher that first
   pointed out to me the folly of battledress. 8^)

You came to the same conclusion I did! I was prepared to design a Solomani
Rim campaign based on the idea that Terra formed a pocket empire and named
it (with deference to the Old Earth Union that formed around Terra during
the Long Night), the New Earth Union.

After I started putting all my energy into my Regency campaign (still going
strong after 2.5 years, thank you!), I decided to recognize Harold Hale\'s
"Children of Earth" setting as canon for the Solomani Rim.

You may want to take a look at his setting. He did a really nice job. It
appears in several of the more recent issues of The Traveller Chronicle.

>I strongly suspect that the same will have happened for Vland, and other
>homeworlds where all tech levels were progressed through.

I agree. Though Vland does not benefit from the fortuitous astrography that
Terra does. Vland\'s near the Great Rift which protects it on one side, but
it\'s more or less smack dab in the middle of a large stellar main which
would have subject it to huge Viral onslaughts over the ensuing decades.

Yet, out of nostalgia, I set up a pocket empire at Vland, too! Just one
that\'s not too healthy.

Terra, as you can see from viewing a map of the Solomani Rim, benefits from
a large stellar void to coreward-trailing with only a few routes that a
ship of less than jump-3 capability could cross. This, I believe, would
reduce the onslaught of Virus and enable Terra to set up some form of
pocket empire.

You\'re on the same page with Harold. Check out Children of Earth. You\'ll
like it.

>Yeah, what happened to the K\'kree, the Aslan, or the frontiers of the
>Solomani Rim.

That\'s the subject for another story! I believe the story of the most
massive democratic stellar government to ever appear in the history of the
Perseus Arm of the Milky Way: The Fourth Imperium!!!

The K\'kree were, for all intensive purposes, wiped out. Only at the turn of
the millenium (ca. 2000, Cleon dating), did explorers finally discover
remote remnants of the race, long thought to be extinct, in the distant
trailing reaches of the stellar arm.

The Aslan Hierate largely recovered thanks to the filial charity of the
Ihatei prodigal sons who returned to rebuild it. Of course, by that time,
the Aslan race was so busy gobbling up the far spinward remnants of the
Zhodani Consulate, the recovery wasn\'t as fast as it could have been.

Not much.  Remember... the same energy that strikes your target is the

No, no, no... you\'ve misunderstood. As I said above, I suggest +1 should
be added to the damage roll for each die *ignored*. This is not the
blunt trauma, this is over-the-3D-limit extra damage from the holes
being riddled in the body.

In other words, there is no *max damage limit* there\'s a *maximum 3D6
rolled* limit.

So a butt nekkid character being hit by a 6D6 weapon takes 3d6+3 damage
(+3 from the 3 dice ignored) which is the same damage as a character in
flex AV3 armour...

I understand the rationale behind the max damage rule, I just think the
rule is too lenient. *Surely* bullets passing through the body and
_leaving holes_ cause some hardship, even if their kinetic energy isn\'t
absorbed.

   Assuming the shield stops the bullet, the kinetic energy of the
   bullet, after transfer to the shield, will be reduced by a factor of
   M/m (mass of shield / mass of bullet). So a 500 gram shield will
   reduce the KE of a 5 gram bullet by a factor of 100.

   To get a feel for what a factor of 100 in KE means in combat terms,
   it is the equivalent to slowing the bullet down to 1/10th its nominal
   velocity. So this "slow-equivalence" bullet will be what strikes the
   arm of the barbarian, except that its shock will be distributed
   along his entire fore-arm, and not concentrated in one bullet-sized
   part, so it will do even less damage.

   So if your shield can stop the bullet, you\'ll take almost no damage
   at all.

I think you\'ve raised some interesting points.  I can think of a couple of
others:  

- -  Powered battledress gives you all kinds of capabilities that you
wouldn\'t have otherwise.  So, even if you can take out someone in ABD with
a good RAM grenade, any units that go into battle without the life support,
speed, endurance, medication, sensors, etc., provided by ABD will get
vaporized real quick.  In this sense, ABD may also be analogous to our M1
tanks: they\'re heavy and can take out all kinds of things, but can also be
brewed up by a single well-aimed LAW fired by infantry.  So, you don\'t use
them in isolation, but with supporting infantry and Bradley FVs, etc.  In
the same way, ABD troops not be used singly for boarding actions, but would
fight in self-supporting squads along with lesser-armored Scouts, high
guard support (aka arty), and other supporting units.  Sure, a rebel might
be able to take out _one_ of these guys with an underslung RAM launcher,
but the building the rebel is hiding in will be a smoking crater when his
buddies and their support turn their firepower on it.  

- - Which leads me to the other possibility.  Maybe ABD _isn\'t_ like an M1
tank (though I like that thought).  Maybe the use of ABD is more like the
use of fighting lines and formations by the Napoleonic-era British fighting
the American colonial rebels.  Theirs was a good tactic that no longer made
sense.  If that\'s true, then perhaps some sort of lighter, cheaper armor
(like Star Wars stormtroopers) is in order.  Still gives you the sensors,
life-support, and protection against some weapons, etc., but its cheap and
versatile enough that you don\'t worry if some of the infantry wearing them
get mowed down by lasers.

Actually with training on the piste, I find that with a couple of years

tested this in any sort of "real combat", but according to theory, by moving
back and forth you constrain your opponent to straight line maneuvers. I
used to be pretty fast moving backward. I was certainly as fast as the
SCAdians I was playing with. They were often encumbered by the shield. That
may imply that they didn\'t know how to use it.

        Possibly.  Were they wearing armor as well?  Your thinking is valid,
from a sport fencing context, but in the many bouts I\'ve fought, the
exchanges are rarely so elegant.  When your opponent rushes you, he puts his
shoulder behind his shield and flat RUNS at you.  No careful maintaining of
stance and footwork, just a howling charge with a sword cocked back to
strike the moment the proper opening presents itself.  Distance closes very
fast, and your range of options shrink from eyeblink to eyeblink.  If it
were me behind the shield, I would rush at you and give you one of two
options- hit me or get flattened.  If you tried to hit me (face or leading
leg, because I\'m refusing my sword arm and pretty much everything else is
behind the shield) I\'d wait for you to commit and then take a swing at your
extended sword arm.
        The point is, I\'m charging at you more than anything to rattle you
and make you react.  I\'m giving you only a second or two to make the right
decision.  This is where life or death amounts to how much experience you have.

Granted, but if I cut the side of the shin. I am going to reduce the
low-tech fighters mobility drastically.

        A muscle cut, unless it\'s a hamstring (tough to hit from head on)
won\'t become drastic immediately.  But you\'re right, you take his leg at the
earliest opportunity.  Were it me, in the situation above, I\'d feint at the
barbarian\'s eyes as he began the charge, and when he raised his shield I\'d
duck low and left and nail his leg above the ankle.  If I\'m lucky his
counterswing will miss, otherwise I\'ll sprout a sword in my left shoulder.

Distance is only part of the equation. I often found that displacing the
opponent\'s weapon also worked well, and that it was usually a good tactic to
displace and cut the weapon arm. By our rules that was a disable. In terms
of "Real Life", YMMV.

        I can see that.  There is indeed an art to displacing the opponent\'s
weapon, but it\'s bloody hard if your weapon is much lighter.

In my experience, people who are using big weapons like to get up close and
personal, far beyond the top third of the blade on striking the opponent.
This may be due to a lack of experience in handling the blade. I think
fencers have a better instinctive grasp of the distance concept.

        Absolutely.  The fencer employs the art of the thrust, and he has to
maintain a critical distance wherein he can strike deep enough to hit the
vitals, but yet be able to swiftly draw the blade out of the body, lest it
become trapped when the opponent falls to the ground.  I think more
inexperienced swordfighters get close because their thinking doesn\'t extend
past their hands, as opposed to out at the tip of the blade, where it\'s
supposed to be.

>  If you are fast enough to duck out of the reach of

As I said above, distance is only part of the equation. It is very possible
to control the opponent\'s blade by keeping yours in contact with it.

        With blades of similar weight, I agree, or if a fencer has the nerve
to attempt blade control using the lower third of his blade (where there is
a stronger cross-section and less susceptibility to flexing).  If the
broadswordsman is foolish enough to play that game, he deserves what he
gets.  The proper method is keeping the sword cocked back by his head, out
of your reach until he is ready to strike.

Well, desperation tactics do work pretty well sometimes. However, there is
no way that the broadswordsman can attack without leaving *something*
vulnerable. Most often (and again, I find it common when someone is relying
on a shield) this is the sword arm. Often it is the face as well, which
would really suck...

        Putting out your opponent\'s eyes will seriously impede his
performance. ;)  You are correct- when you commit to an attack, you are
leaving yourself open, to some degree.  And again, you are right in that the
best target is the swordsman\'s outstretched arm.  The trouble is that this
arm is engaged in swinging a sharpened metal bar at your vital areas, which
has got to be of at least passing concern to you.  Hitting that arm does not
necessarily mean that it will stop it\'s swing.  What I\'m saying is that you
run a very real risk of getting hit simultaneously.  A lot depends on the
direction of his swing versus your position, etc.  (I wish were were in a
park somewhere with a couple of sticks so we could walk through this- I\'m
sure you know as well as I that there are some elements of fencing that is
much easier to simply DO than to explain!)

I suppose a clarification is in order. The sabre I am envisioning for my
thinking would be something akin to the USMC dress sabre...maybe a bit
heavier, with a basket hit. The blade would taper from  5 cm at the hilt to
3 cm at the tip (chisel pointed? maybe...). It would *certainly* be heavier
and stiffer than the average fencing sabre.

        That makes a world of difference.  Sorry about my confusion.  The
Mamluke saber that the Marines carry is a light Eastern-style horseman\'s
saber, a little too light for my tastes, but the fighting versions are
serviceable weapons, and as you said, a lot tougher than a sport fencing
blade.  What you have in mind is more like a European cavalry saber, with a
3-3.5cm blade width, slightly curved and tapering to a thrusting point.  The
historical ones had a gently tapering point and a very strong triangular
cross-section.  (There\'s a really gorgeous Confederate cavalry saber I found
in a local antique store, and the moment I can cough up $900, that sucker\'s
mine!)  Weight was around two pounds, plus or minus some ounces.  This is
based on an 1880\'s British Army pattern cavalry saber that a friend of mine
owns  (he found it at a Flea Market, of all things- I won\'t tell you how
much he paid for it, the lucky SOB).

A light blade *can* parry a broadsword, applying it\'s force at the upper
third of the broadsword. A swift chop here takes the broadsword out of line.
If you are not afraid of contact, now would be the time to step in
corps-a-corps and shoulder the shield-bearer, knocking him off balance. If
you are afraid of contact, once the broadsword is out of line, chop wrist,
elbow, cheek or crown, as the target warrants.

        That\'s providing that he holds it out for you to chop at.  Again, if
the broadswordsman has any training, he will hold the blade cocked back and
out of the way until he\'s ready to hit you with it.  All you as the opponent
are supposed to see is a big scarred shield, a bit of lower leg, and the
swordsman\'s beady-eyed glare peeking over the top of the shield.  You\'ve got
the right idea, though- go for his eyes or forehead.  When he raises his
shield, you crash into him  (when you\'re sparring, you\'d best dispel any
fear of contact!).  He\'ll either fall or backpedal, in which case you duck
and cut his legs.  Of course, even this plan can backfire if the guy behind
the shield is experienced.  I tried this once, made the guy raise his shield
and checked him.  He rocked back, enough to fool me that I\'d overbalanced
him, then when I ducked and went for his legs, he rocked back forward,
lowered the shield, and fell on me.  Literally.  Squashed me under that
heater shield like a bug. then just sort of started hacking at my legs.

>        Only if the barbarian was really, really stupid.   

I have to respectfully disagree. At this point I don\'t want to have the
conversation devolve into "can not/can too", but let me at least explain my
rationale.

First point: I am modeling the barbarian and his behavior from low-tech
Terra. I don\'t think that (IMHO) a barbarian (or hell, even a French
chevalier c.1100) is going to be  tarined or capable of handling the
fencer\'s speed or control of target.

        Hmmm.  I see your reasoning.  You have a good point there, one that
I had not considered.  Experience, of course, always plays a factor, and the
barbarian\'s lack of exposure to the sabre would give the canny fencer an
edge.  All the same, the fencer better end the fight quickly.  It won\'t take
long for the barbarian to put two and two together if he is at all skilled.

Secondly, I don\'t assume the extremnely light fencing weapons, but instead a
more "Napoleonic" or "American Civil War" style sabre, not as light as you
might be thinking, but still far more agile than your average broadsword.
The combination of non-trivial wounding (to an exposed weapon arm) and the
weight to effectively displace the broadsword (at the upper third of the
blade) makes the sabre (and the fencer) the better choice in my opinion.

        Take it from me, there is no such thing as a non-trivial wound!
From experience, the fighting sabers are more agile, but not by much.  It
does have the ability to displace the broadsword, as you have stated, but
the trained broadswordsman will give you precious little opportunity to do
it.  Both choices are perfectly valid (especially if you fill that other
hand of yours with a dagger), as the two blades themselves are fairly evenly
matched.  It\'s just with the shield, the broadswordsman has less to worry
about as far as defense goes.  The saber fencer has to take more risks and
work a lot harder to hit his opponent while avoiding getting hit in return.
Neither style is innately superior to the other- both have advantages and
disadvantages.
        To be honest with you- I\'d take the saber too.  I\'ve fought on both
sides of the equation, and it\'s just more challenging (and fun) to use the
saber.

Anyhow, that was my thinking on the subject...

        And I appreciate the chance for discussion!  Thanks.

Oh, I see.  You are, in effect, adding the blunt trauma damage even 
if the character has no armor.

I think that my rule is better.  You add blunt trauma as written.  
You just can\'t use blunt trauma to exceed the 3D6 max limit.

This is interesting.  My current campaign has characters with home worlds in
the Sword Worlds.  The SW independent fleets in this game have also been
gearing up, so to speak.  I have created a partial political background that
the PCs have no knowledge of yet.  It is my intention to get them involved in
this in one way or another.

Sounds interesting!  My players are travelling with an Imperial merchant
captain through the Marches.  They are slowly making their way back to the SW.

I would be interested in reading some of the background you have, if that is
possible.

	I\'m afraid I have to disagree with you here, Rob.  Y\'see, TL-2
armour is nothing but armour.  It\'s simply crude protection against trauma
inflicted by bladed or blunt weapons and some primitive projectile weapons.
Once projective weapons get powerful enough, wearing even the best
breastplate your TL can produce is useless as protection and will only slow
you down.

	Battledress, OTOH, is much, much more than just mere armour: it\'s
enhanced sensor and comm capable, self-camouflaging, capable of flight,
vacuum enabled, and has laser point defense and a powered exoskeleton
component that enhances the wearer\'s strength.  I think that these
capabilities are the real reason for battledress, and the armour merely
tacked on as an afterthought because the exoskeleton and Fusion+ systems
could support it.  Even without the armour, troops with these capabilities
would possess significant advantages; the sensor and comm capability alone
should prove utterly lethal; if suits in a unit share and integrate data
from all the suits\' sensors, that means that if one trooper sees a target
all of them know where it is.

	I see battledress not so much as an attempt to make troops
invulnerable as it is to drastically increase their tactical effectiveness
through the abovementioned capabilities, with the armouring as a bonus.
Even if you\'re up against a bunch of disgruntled pyramid investment scheme
victims with plasma guns (yeek), the mobility, command and communications,
and camouflage enhancements of battledress are still going to give you a
significant edge... and the fact that the armour will save you from
near-misses, shrapnel, small-arms fire, chemical weapons, and so forth
won\'t hurt either.

We\'ll have to see what military weapons look like in EA; it\'s possible
that TL-12 augmented battle dress is proof against TL-8 HEAP grenades.

Even if it isn\'t, it still provides some advantages. Consider battledress +
gauss rifle  vs  unarmoured  + grenade launcher. The gauss rifle has much
greater effective range than the grenade launcher - particularly since the
GL has relatively few shots while the gauss rifle is full-auto. If the two
soldiers are walking towards each other in open terrain, the guy with the GL
dies first.

Realistically, neither will be fighting in the open - neither has much chance
against grav tanks - but even in a urban environment, the BD-solider with
an automatic fire weapon will tend to get the first hit if they both stumble
on each other coming around a corner.

Alternatively, if the BD-soldier is also carrying a grenade launcher, the
BD-soldier can survive a near-miss - the unarmoured soldier can\'t. 

BD will also provide greater survivability against vehicle weapons (large
HE rounds, light cluster bombs, plasma gun near-misses...) 

BD lets you carry better sensors, comm equipment, and much greater weights
of ammunition.

Finally, high-TL BD will probably include some sort of built-in fire control,
using the suit\'s sensors to move the arms to aim carried weapons - making
the BD soldier as accurate as a computerized tank.

How useful it all is depends on price, in the end...

Well, I\'m not sure about other types of games, but when we did the PBeM
topic on the IRC a while ago, we covered a decent bit of the issues relating
to the referee.  I was going to work that up for a FAQ and try to get a
player FAQ too, but alas, they expect me to work at my job. (bummer)  If Suz
has the info from the IRC night (or maybe a log) it might be nice to post
it, and if not, I will try to find it on my computer at home.

Yeah and she\'s great at it too.

The use of broadsword and shield in individual combat died out and was
replaced by rapier and main gauche style combat...right?  Why?

        It boils down to the evolution of arms and armor.  The transition
from sword-and-shield to rapier was by no means direct or immediate, but
followed an evolution of warfare covering about 500 years.  Initially, (by
this I\'m talking as far back as Greece), swords were broad-bladed cutting
weapons, because forging techniques were not yet up to the challenge of
producing high-quality, tempered steel.  They had to be broad enough to
resist bending, and to be able to hold up under the punishment of repeated
blows.  The earliest forms of armor were shields of wood or hide, and later,
boiled leather armor, plus helmets.  The boiled leather was rather
restrictive mobility-wise, being thick and retty rigid, once the wax
hardened it.  To help turn aside a sword cut (and hopefully put a notch in
the offending blade, pieces of metal were often riveted to the hide armor.
        Then along came mail- linked rings of metal (or linked plates in
some cases)  which afforded better protection than leather and much more
mobility.  It was better against cuts, but vulnerable to thrusting weapons-
a good point could punch through the rings- so the shield remained a useful
addtion to a soldier\'s equippage.  At this point, the axe also became
favored as a weapon, because it\'s chisel-like blade shape fared better
against mail, at the cost of requiring greater skill to use effectively.
Swords became longer to accomodate fighting from horseback, and
double-edged, so that when one edge became notched or dulled after hammering
on a lot of armor, the wielder could switch to a sharper edge.  This was the
state of the art from 900-1100.  After 1100 comes the brigandine, a form of
armor that employed plates of steel sandwiched between two heavy layers of
fabric, and offered a hybridization between the flexibility of mail and the
effectiveness of plate steel.  From there we begin to see the evolution of
plate armor, beginning with steel greaves (shin protectors for horsemen),
and then growing in coverage until the late 1300\'s when we began to see the
first true suits of plate-and-chain harness.  By this point there was plate
steel covering nearly all of the fighter\'s body, with protection at the
joints and groin provided by mail.  Swords began to increase in length for
more chopping power, and develop a strong thrusting point, and the shield
began to be phased out.  The 1300\'s and early 1400\'s can be considered to be
the heyday of the suit of plate armor, as it increased in sophistication to
the point that it was impervious to the edge of a sword.  In response,
swords kept their length but began to taper to a needle like point with a
strong cross-section, for finding their way into the armor\'s gaps.  Also
crushing weapons like the axe and mace came into vogue, as well as the
polearm.  The Swiss and their deadly pike squares finally spelled the end of
the knight and the mounted charge, and gunpowder took away the vaunted
protection of full plate.  As guns became more common, armor became lighter
and lighter- why carry all that weight when some guy with a matchlock can
punch right through it?  Finally devolving into a heavy breastplate and helm
for heavy cavalry units.
        With armor on the decline, the need for heavy, armor-defeating
swords became unnecessary, and the needle-nosed thrusting swords of the late
1400\'s became slimmer and lighter still, eventually becoming the rapier. It
is important to note, however, that the weapons that men wore in public and
the ones they took to war were very different.  War swords were wider
(2-3cm), and were capable of cutting and thrusting with great speed and
power.  These war swords later became curved for horsemen, leading to the
cavalry sabers that persisted into the 1800\'s.

        During the late  Renaissance, it was considered a valid, if somewhat
risky tactic, to use your left hand to grab your opponent\'s rapier and trap
it.  To that end, heavy leather gauntlets were developed that had
tightly-woven squares of mail stitched over the left palm.  The idea was,
you could catch the enemy rapier\'s point in the mail and trap it, then close
your fingers over the blade while doing your best to ventilate your
opponent. I can\'t imagine that the glove would permit much manual dexterity,
however.
        A gauntlet covered with cerametal plates along the back of the hand
and forearm would make for an interesting defensive tool, but it would take
a good bit of dex to use competently.  Weight wouldn\'t be much more than a
kilo, I would think.

I don\'t recall what Andy was selling TLWH for, but I do know that the 
comparison wouldn\'t be very valid.  Andy made a very small print run 
(higher per unit cost), he sold only direct to the public (i.e., he 
got 100% of the purchase price), and he made a net loss.  IG is making 
large print runs (lower per unit cost), is selling 99% of their product 
through distributors (i.e., they get a small percentage of the final 
selling price), and is planning to make a profit.  

Same material, completely different business cases.

   Very good point. As much as I scoff at the "armor" of battledress, I
   must confess to being intrigued by the military capabilities offered
   by its mobility and sensors. Imagine powered troops that never get
   tired and can operate in all environments, all weather. Each
   individual has his own array of sensors with automatic, shoulder
   mounted, counter battery lasers. On his powered back he carries a VLS
   of RAM anti-personel and anti-armor missiles. Each grunt\'s weapons
   and sensors are linked to the others\' in an Aegis-like defense
   system. Each soldier is litterally blinded by all the information
   flowing into his goggles from his (and everyone else\'s) sensors; a
   special information processing skill needs to be learned to keep from
   getting bewildered by all this information; call this skill
   "battledress". Each battledress grunt is essentially an "officer"
   exercising "policy" decisions over his weapons, which fire themselves
   with blinding speed and deadly accuracy.

   These guys may even look like they\'re wearing plate armor because of
   all the electronic shielding they have to wear to avoid getting
   cooked by their own counter-battery centimeter radar! And as long as
   you are spending all this butter on your guns, you may as well tack
   on some armor too (if it doesn\'t cost too much more).

Here\'s a pointer to the FAQ that I use for my T4 PBeM.  I\'ve been running a
CT PBeM (Counter Genocide) for over a year and a half and am now
transitioning to using T4.

Here\'s an even simpler fix:  triple the amount of skills that are awarded

and every skill level is worth 1!

They have been de-valued.  Given that, an explanation of each of the

Let\'s use Pilot as the placeholder.  Any other skill (engineer,
chemist, programmer) can be substituted.

5    Principle Pilot   research                11-15

Skill level zero (used for T4 default skills) implies the equivalent
of reading a manual and playing the videogame.

Skill level one implies the equivalent of taking undergraduate
courses and having some initial on-the-job training.

Skill level two implies the equivalent of masters level courses and
having limited real world experience.

Skill level three implies the equivalent of doctorate level courses
and having solid experience in the work place.

Skill level four implies the equivalent of knowing a skill well
enough to get a job teaching it.

Skill level five implies the equivalent of knowing a skill well
enough to have done years of research in it.

Levels above 5 I don\'t think are worth defining IMO. They\'re simply
too nebulous.  Suffice it to say that players above level five are
very good and will routinely be able to perform staggering feats.

As a CT GM, I never rolled skill level one in normal situations.
That has been bumped up to level two in T4.

What think thou?

In my current PBeM, we had agreed that 1 Cr ~= $1.  But where could you get
"high living" for $900/month?  Not in this America.  I was trying to decide
if these numbers were bad or if my ratio was just bad.  

Here are some number from the Central Supply Catalog (CSC):

Desert Clothing - TL 1     100
Scuba Gear           6     300
Flex armor           6    1400

sleeping bag         5     200

2 sleeping bags = 1 month of ordinary living  :-)

Obviously, these numbers don\'t jive.  So, I\'m throwing out the numbers I
found in T4 for cost of living.  I\'d like to suggest these ranges.  Please
comment and suggest/correct them.

Monthly Costs

Starvation Level
  a bare minimum of food   50-150
  dismal lodging           100-250
Subsistance Level (I consider myself to be here)
  reasonable food          150-500
  acceptable lodging		250-500
Ordinary Level
  good food                500-1500
  good lodging             500-2000
High Living - 
  excellant food           1500-4000
  excellant accomodations  2000-5000

4000/month on food is about $45/meal.  I\'d say that\'s high living, but

adding restrictions on getting new levels.  That brings me to a question:

Are EDU levels absolute?

Let me explain.  Let\'s suppose (for the sake of argument) that we all agree
on the following scale:

EDU  Formal Training
5    Junior High School
7    Senior High School
9    Undergraduate
B    Graduate
D    Doctorate
F    Post-doctorate

IF this is true, would that imply that EVERYONE with an EDU of 9 has
completed their Undergraduate degree?

Here\'s why that\'s important:  If you\'re going to hand out lots of EDU, then
characters should have to pay for it in terms of years added to age.  You
can generate a character who\'s initial UPP has a C for EDU.  He\'s got a
grad degree at 18 years old? 

Here\'s what I\'m considering for a fix.  All characters start out with an
initial EDU of no MORE than 7 (a high school education); note that it could
be less.  If they go to college and complete it, then EDU = 9.   Graduate
school, then EDU = B.  And so on.

How would I cover a career that adds EDU +1?  It would be like going to
night school.  If you can get your EDU bumped up to 9, then you completed
the equivalent of a college degree.

Anybody else like this?

thereof) of this rulechange.]

This is really the best point, IMO.

Anyone else on this list work for the US Military?  If so, you\'ll recognize
these two words:

  situational awareness

For the rest of you civies, it\'s a fancy way of saying "I\'ve got lots of
information on the battlefield that\'s all around me."  It\'s tactical
information.  Those who have it win wars; those who don\'t don\'t.  BD would
be a perfect mechanism for providing constant situational awareness to the
foot soldier.  Imagine a grunt having all the information that his entire
military has readily available for him to pull, sort, filter, and organize.
 That\'s power.  That\'s why I\'d outfit *my* army with BD (if I could afford it).

Well, yeah...shields and axes are great for in close, capture-the-trench
style actions. Fencing is predicated on mobility...without that, you\'re
sunk. Plus any chimp can use an axe, so you don\'t have to worry about
training. But then again, given the trenches, why *would* you want to fence?
I\'d have just stuck (like 90+% of the fighters in the trenches) with
grenades and my rifle. A Lee-Enfield will still blow neat .303 holes through
boilerplate. Someone\'s dumb enough to close, that\'s what I have my bayonet
for...

You should read the book "Armor" by <Somebody> Steakly, I think.  It
describes in detail the adventures of a Scout in just such armor -- and the
Scouts were built for speed, not fast attack.  The Marines\' armor was
_really_ something.

You have a few good ideas here that I snipped, but let me throw my .02Cr:

BD is good for a couple of things. The sensor suite is pretty good, it has
great commo gear and it is pretty invulnerable to shell fragments, small
arms except Plasma guns and suchlike...

In terms of rebuttal, though, how about this idea:

Auto grenade launchers are spiff, but the ammo supply is a bitch. I mean the
average 30 mm grenade weighs in at about .35 kilos, right? So how many can
you carry? How many men are you going to detail to just carry the ammo for
the guy with the grenade launcher? Of course you could mount it on a vehicle
with a hopper, but that limits your mobility and your choice of terrain.

Underslung grenade launchers are good too, except that you have a limited
rate of fire, high recoil, and again, limited ammunition. You have to paste
everyone with the grenades before they can get a PGMP shot on you too.
Finally you have to kill all them before they get close enough for you to
start suffering collateral damage from the fragments.

So you are right...Battledress is not invulnerable. IMHO your best bet is a
squad automatic rocket launcher, tossing HEAP directly at the guys in BD.
But have you ever looked at the statistics on life expectency in combat for
the squad auto-gunner?

Just a few more ideas...

Well, I think a 96-page book split, say, 38-19-19-19 would provide more
than enough detail, while still allowing room for referee expansions.
Though, since IG wants to go hardcover, I was thinking of jumping to 128
pages, which would give you 50-25-25-25, the same level of detail as you
desire.

Re: the Answerin....  So?  They are in Vland sector, which is where much
of the interaction with the Vargr will take place.  To my mind, we\'re not
looking for races totally bounded by the major race in question, but for
those who would be naturally encountered "en route" to the homespace of
the major race.

I have to confess that I hate the Hhkar with a passion.  (And they\'re not
"canon" either, having appeared in Challenge in an article by a non-GDW
author.  You can use them if you like....  I don\'t).

A bit human-heavy to my mind: "true" aliens probably sell better.

But the Suerrat are nowhere near the Vargr!  They\'re way down in the
"bulge" formed by the curve of the Great Rift, in Ilelish, several sectors
away from the Vargr corsairs and such!

The Ahetaowa are plant-based Hierate-dwellers, detailed in a Challenge
article.  Yes, they might be a bit much after the Hresh....  As for the
Darrians, again, they fit much better into a Spinward Marches 1100-era
setting, so I\'d far rather put them with the Zhodani rather than muck
about with what looks to really be a Milieu-200-centric book.

And why do you need a write-up on the Zhodia colonies?  If the bulk of the
book is about the Aslan anyway, you just use that culture with human
inhabitants and, voila, Zhodians to an excellent first approximation.  At
most you need a couple of sidebars to talk about artificial dewclaws, etc.

I like many of your other thoughts, though I\'d keep the Roth Thokken as a
side mention in the Vargr volume.  As you can probably tell, I like to get
the rough outlines of a race published, but leave lots of room for
mysteries and offshoots that the referee can detail without fear of
"canon" violations.  You seem to be more of a completist.

This I like too, though I dislike the Primordials almost as much as the
Hhkar.  But Droyne + other widespread and weird races makes a nice volume.

A thought, while we\'re on the topic... what if IG published, for the
Milieu 0 to 200 period, a whole volume focusing purely on human minor
races?  They seem to be some of the most interesting political forces
around for the expanding Imperium to meet and understand, have always been
one of the most fascinating parts of Traveller to me, and are a feature
Traveller has that most other SFRPG\'s don\'t.

ISBA inaugurial dinner.
Authorised by Sir Jerami Djano, head of PR ISBA

In a glittering social event held in the Crystal City orbital complex
high above Sylea the newly formed ISBA held it\'s first formal
function.

Attended by a veritable who\'s who of both the Imperial shipbuilding
industry and Sylean high society, the event marked the formal
inception of the ISBA.

The keynote speakers included: Josphanoer Cailfor master of Ceremonies
and representative for Founder Ship Works; Vice-Consul Joshua Von
Brandili spokes person for FernZukunft Unbegrenzt of Altec
Confederation; Sir Ira Rimmer of The Bureau of Spacecraft Safety,
Heath, and Transit Standards

Josphanoer Cailfor spoke of the inception of the ISBA, its direction
and the need for its existance

  "If this is true what should we do to lead the way.? Well you have
   received the ISBA organizational idea, and have chosen your place.
   We must first and foremost organize ourselves. Too many design
   philosophies exist they must be brought together. Second as the
   Imperium grows a common representation of business information must
   be created so that decisions can be made by all quickly and
   accurately. Finally we must be sure that the we are properly
   represented with the Imperium."

Joshua Von Brandili spoke on the great romance and adventure that is
space and the need for reliable and dependable vessels to conquer it

  "Tonight, you stand on the docks, as young adventurers venture into
  the
   heavens. May they return in glory and put their arms on your
   shoulders because you build a ship for him to go thither and back."

Ira Rimmer (representative of the Imperial Bureau of Spacecraft
Safety, Heath, and Transit Standards) spoke of the need for proper
regulation and accountablity within the industry and the need for a
joint approach in working out these regulations

  "...competition has shown that many designers will modify whatever
  they
   can to squeese a little extra cargo space or a little more profit
   into their ship. Sometimes with disastrous results. Would any ship
   carry a separate astrogator if some regulation did not demand it?
   What of convertible fuel tanks that are inherently dangerous? I
   challenge you all to step away from your supposedly enlightened
   facades and answer these rhetorical questions honestly. Yes,
   someone must be a watchdog."

  "With the formation of the Imperial Starship Builders Association,
  we
   of this conference have a valuable opportunity to further this
   mission as never before known in the history of manned spaceflight.
   We can work together and mold these regulations into a better and
   brighter whole, and to this end I am personally devoted."


The highlight of the gathering was however without doubt, the 
arrival of His Serene Highness, Emperor Cleon himself. The Emperor
spoke of the need for the new Imperium to face the challanges of the
new frontiers, both physical and spiritual, to boldly embrace the new
technologies that are now being developed; and above all to work to
ensure the future of the great Imperium. To quote his own words:

  "And that frontier presents problems that will inevitably stand in
  our
   way. We can solve each of the physical problems, but what continues
   to trouble me is the fact that each of us here is human. Our empire
   must, if it is to survive, embrace each intelligence that resides
   in it, and if necessary make special provision to bring each
   intelligence to its greatest possible level of achievement..."

  "...Our empire must be eclectic and cosmopolitan, embracing everyone
   it meets, absorbing them under an umbrella that protects and
   enhances them. The safety and security that we create will give us
   and our children\'s children the opportunity to live out our lives
   in peace and prosperity."

  "Remember that both the Ziru Sirka and the Rule of Man collapsed
  from
   their own shortcomings. We must not allow that to happen again."

  "I thank you all for being here tonight, and although I must leave,
  ask
   you to embrace this philosophy of empire and make it a reality."

The Emperor also took the opportunity to announce the appointment of
Duchess Zhunette Rosale Cardell as his offical liason with the ISBA.

In response to the Emperor\'s challange, the ISBA has announced several
new initatives: firstly the online information service currently in
the process of being set up will be open to the general public.
Secondly, the ISBA is currently looking into the possibility of
endowing a chair of Naval Architecture at one of the Imperium\'s
leading academic institutions. Thirdly the THUDDD design project is to
be centralised and formalised; and strict confromance to the relevant
astrospace regulations will be a requirement of all future designs.
Finally, the ISBA has undertaken to do all within it\'s power to ensure
that it\'s membership is as diverse as is possible. To that end the
ISBA is intending to hold high level talks with those within the
industry who have choosen to remain outside it\'s structure with the
intent of working through outstanding problems.

*****Role-Playing off*****************

Well this sums up the first dinner of the ISBA I think over all it 
went pretty good, except for a few ISP that I had.  As the message 
implies there will very soon be a separate ISBA mailing list.  This 
will be open to all who are intrested in the ISBA ideas.  This will 
prevented us from takeing over the main list.  Though you will hear 
from us every once in awhile.  If I am not mistaken THUDD will also 
be handle via this list.

Instructions will follow about the ISBA mailing list from Paul 
shortly

The main thing I would like to do is thank the following people.

CmdrX for helping get this off the ground

Paul Walker for providing the ISBA mailing list

Andrew Vallance for his supper writting skills, believe me I didnt do 
                            the press release this time.

JD Burdick for his speech and his 40 parsec travelle to the meeting

Brian Howard who in just a few seconds knew what I wanted to do and 
                        came up with Rimmer,  the man we will all 
                        love to hate.

Finally a special thanks to Marc Miller for playing the Emperor who 
else good do it : )

Thats it for now

Doesn\'t this assume that all worlds in the Imperium work just like 20th 
Century Earth? Maybe different societies teach people at different rates. 
(It\'s a standard of the Heinlein juveniles that 15-year-olds know 
advanced calc, for example...) 

I always figured EDU measured how much factual knowledge you have about 
the universe, whether you got that at a university, being apprenticed 
into the technocratic priesthood at age 12, or whatever.

IIRC, they didn\'t have any. Or rather, because they were bordered by
the Zhodani Consulate on one side, Zho or Imperial client worlds on all
the others (except one side), and the Darrians on the last their 
"ambitions" were basically a pipe dream. Although the Darrians weren\'t
aggressive at all, they *did* have that pesky solar flare inducer which
scared the bejeebers out of the Sworld Worlders and even made the Zhos
AND the Imperium oh so polite.

Although not all the worlds nearby were "client states", keep in mind
that the systems of the Sworld Worlds controlled their own navies.
There wasn\'t a permanent overall command structure in place which had
permanent control. All the political infighting made it very difficult
to use all the fleets in a concerted effort. Even during the Fifth
Frontier War, SW fleets were used by the Zhos in a diversionary attack
on the Lanth subsector while the mainline Zhos went on a blitzkrieg for
Rhylanor via Regina. It almost worked...

Of course, in combat, there ain\'t no trophy for second place.

As a matter of fact, DGP described and illustrated a small shield that
was specifically designed for use with the Imperial Marine Scout version
of battledress...one of the few things DGP put out that I was
disappointed in.

As far as a normal person.
It\'s the conversion of Gravitional potential energy to Kinetic energy that
will do the damage.
When the PC/NPC hits the ground, the BD may come to a halt relatively
intact, but the poor sap inside will try to keep moving through the BD.
Hence he will take damage just like those without armor (maybe 1D less, to
take into account some of the padding).

Lighter, cheaper armor indeed!  Do you too hear the sound of Imperial
Marines running screaming from the briefing room upon hearing that Battle
Dress will be replaced by the armor that didn\'t really work against a
single laser blast in three movies?

Next up:  Replacing armor on Sylean fighters with the fine armor used on
Imperial TIE Fighters!   <g>

Reminds me of one of my favourite Japanimation movies... Madox: Metal
Skin Panic.  I like powered armour that I can put on autopilot to
shoot down hostile Apaches while I\'m out taking a leak (or something
like that :)

Which brings up another point... what about heavier infantry armour
such as the traditional Anime/Heinlein powersuit in Traveller?  I know
Traveller has been around since before the now-too-common use of
powered armour in animation and books, but has there ever been any
official GDW (et al) information or background regarding their use in
the Traveller Universe(tm)?

bases!

T4\'s definition of Education is "...amount of schooling."

Acknowledging this, EDU cannot be absolute.  The more a character
learns, the higher his or her EDU should become.  The problem, of
course, is that some skills are linked to Education...

If a game system uses skills, the inclusion of an EDU statistic should
be used simply to cover skills that aren\'t covered by the game system,
of for defaulting to skills not posessed by the character.  By very
definition, characters with high skills should also have high EDU,
since EDU defines the character\'s education (ie: the skills and
knowledge s/he posesses).

Only one prob, for animals max dice is weight/50kg
By "official" standards, Geonee, Droyne and their fellow runts are the most damage 
resistant races around.
Note: Droyne weigh between 25-50kg, Max dice 1D
K\'kree weigh 550 kg, max dice 11D
Thus it is easier to kill a K\'kree with a big game rifle than a droyne (and don\'t hand me any

I don\'t think a high EDU equals formal education.  To illustrate, according
to the T4 rulebook, Biology skill is governed by INT and/or EDU.  It
further states that EDU is important for Biology due to the vast amount of
detail a person is required to memorize, e.g. what separates this species
from that species, how does a liver work, how does a orgainism\'s excretion
process work.  That\'s all data that someone can read in a textbook.  You
don\'t need to have a MS in Biology to understand theory and apply it on a
limited basis.  Think of all the Audubon Societies in the States - people
with specific knowledge of the environment and nature, yet not necessarily
college educated.

Or let\'s say I make a successful Biology/EDU skill role in recognizing a
tree-like H\'resh alien.  I\'ve got Biology-1 and EDU A.  I make the skill
role not due to my skill from college but mostly due to the knowledge
gleaned from all those Year Zero Discovery Channel Programs on the
tree-like H\'Resh I watched that are reflected in my general EDU background.

In my campaigns, someone with a high EDU may have gone to graduate
school...or may be person with a high INT, low SO who couldn\'t afford
college but who still had an "insaitable curiosity" and is constantly
reading biology texts (or whatever).

IMHO, that gives one more flexibility when roleplaying.

Because 3f armor (flexible armor rating 3) is *not intended* for use
against 6D weapons, that\'s why. If you are hit by a 2D weapon, you\'re
laughing. But if you get hit with a 6D weapon, kinetic energy is absorbed
by the armor, which gives you one heck of a nasty bruise. If you had been
nekkid, that extra kinetic energy would have been wasted, because the
rounds would\'ve pierced right through you. Hence, no bruise. You would\'ve
taken less damage.

I think it makes perfect sense that being naked is preferable to wearing
flex armor ***against weapons with a higher penetration than the armor was
intended to protect against***.

You\'re forgetting is that the maximum damage rule isn\'t some arbitary
magical law intended to keep characters alive; it\'s based on simple
physics: if a bullet passes through you, your body only absorbs some of its
kinetic energy, the rest will be lost. You\'re also forgetting that 3f armor
isn\'t intended to be used against weapons with a damage of 6D.

  The defeat of the British Army on the battlefield in the Revolutionary
War was carried out by American troops (Continental Line) trained in the
exact tactics the British used.  With the aid of French troops and the
French Navy (Americans were lucky this period was one where the French
Navy could fight on fairly equal terms with the British due to innovations
in warship design and construction), General Washington was able to meet
the British army on the battlefield on fairly equal terms, at least in
the later years of the war.  

  Contrary to popular myth, American militia units were fairly worthless
in combat terms - their real role was tarring and feathering those still
trying to be loyal to George III.  This kept the British from controlling
areas that their army had marched through, and denied victory in much the
same way Vietnamese irregulars denied large parts of the coutryside to
American troops through their "work" with the people. 

  Sorry to bring this up - I like your other ideas about the function of
Battledress as a mobility enhancer and support.  Years of teaching the
American History Survey course has made me sensitive to popular myths
about history and the need to correct them.

  I might add one other point - modern infantry armor, esp. flak jackets,
are not primarily designed to stop enemy infantry weapos.  Rather, they
are designed to shied the soldier from the major killer on the modern
battlefield:  artillery, in particular the low-velocity fragments from
exploding shells that accounted for a high percentage of deaths in the
World Wars and Korea.  Perhaps Battledress is designed to enhance the
survivability of troops in the face of bombardment.

Nope!  The problem (and I get the impression from the Virus flame wars of
fall 96 that this is common) is that you assume that Virus is just a little
program sitting out there waiting to trash someone\'s machine.  That is
simply not true. Virus is a living sentient organism.  It was viable early
in the CT setting (based on Survival Margin) and took the form of carefully
controlled, sub-intelligent Deyo chips in the Transponder of EVERY SHIP
LEGALLY operating within the Imperium.  Therefore when the semi intelligent
destroyer Virus was released from Lucan\'s labs, it had breeding ground in
EVERY SHIP LEGALLY operating within the Imperium.

>Bearing in mind the fact that Virus was TL15+ or

Not necessarily.  IIRC, all the controls that were availabe and in place
were destroyed when Dulinor raided the Research Station.  As I recall, Virus
was not yet viable as a weapon when Dulinor raided and therefore was only
controlable in a lab situation.  Well, Dulinor\'s happy fleet entered and
destroyed the lab releasing Virus in the fray.

Maybe not in your home brew universe, but Virus is a plot device of the
Official Universe.  Even still, you have to remember that IF you use the
standard Imperial transponder, Virus already has a buddy to talk to that
understands at the very least how to interface with your computer if not how
to run your computer.  Also, you have to realize that no simple virus
protection software is going to stop Virus (note the difference in caps).
Virus is sentient and knows what it is doing (one of the things programmed
into it was how to breed and it breeds more Virus that already knows how to
breed).  Rather than consider a students prank virus program attacking your
virus protection system, consider a VERY experienced programmer/systems
administrator attacking the same virus protection system.  At first, it
might have some trouble, but unless the attack was returned (the virus
software tried to eliminate Virus on the sending system) it would be still
alive, and since it is sentient, it would learn a little bit more about the
next time.

Just a couple suggestions before this single message degenerates into yet
another Virus flame war...

1. To those of you who just hate Virus for whatever reason, that\'s OK by me,
I mentioned above that things might work differently for neil in his
universe, and if you don\'t want Virus in yours, that\'s fine, but don\'t have
a hissy fit because I (or any one else) talks about it here.

2. To those who DO want to enter the conversation, do it politely and kindly
and remember 3 things:

       A. NO ONE (period) has the experience to accurately describe what a
silicon life form will be capeable of.

       B. NO ONE (and I don\'t care how much experience you have with
computers) has the experience with TL8 or TL9 (or maybe even 10) computers
to accurately tell what computers will be like in the TL15/16/17 Imperium.

       C.  Before you try to make any major assertions about why Virus just
can\'t work, do everyone a favor and read the source material.  This includes
Survival Margin, TNE Main Book, and Vampire Fleets (Regency Sourcebook
couldn\'t hurt).  Anyone who has not read at the very least Survival Margin
and the TNE book has absolutely NO business discussing the validity of Virus.

Thank you for your time and sorry for the rant. :)

Subs *could* do this, in theory, but I\'m unaware of any sub that\'s ever
done so in real life.  Subs use CO2-cracking and scrubbing/filtering to
(re)create breathable air...and a boomer can easily stay submerged, a
totally closed system, for six months at a time.

As I stated before, my BD is more powerful than most of the suits I have
seen in Traveller.  While Auto GL\'s can do damage, they have to hit the
fast moving stealthy trooper, and get past the auto defenses (Auto
detect grenade, blow claymore type explosive in general direction, say
goodby to pesky grenade, missile, etc. as well as any unarmored troops
in close proximity)
Needless to say, this style of armor is rare, used only in extreme
measures, and without any unarmored friendly troops in the area)

Not only would a mixture of words occur but so would a drift from the
standard *meaning* of words. A short story from a book called "The Long
Night" is a perfect example.

The pilot/owner of a small starship (equivalent to an Imperial scout)
looking for trading opportunities came across a planet and ran up
against the local equivalent of Air Force interceptors. They asked him
if he and his crew were "friends coming to do business." When he
emphatically replied in the affirmative, they promptly shot him down.
It seems that the word "friends" became the local equivalent of
"pirates" and "doing business" meant looting and plundering.

Yes, he did.  I must have run it 100 times before I got a habitable planet.

This is true. ;->  Of course, I was looking for *humanly* habitable
planets.

So, I wrote my own program that creates systems. It generates Stars
(including stellar type, class and subclass), including binary and trinary
systems, and all the planets (both inner system and outer system), but it
doesn\'t do moons.

To make the systems more human friendly, I added in some
biological-homostatis stuff. Now, It\'s too generous in creating habitable
planets. You almost always get at least 1 planet and sometimes 2 or 3 in
every system. ;-> When I get a chance I\'ve got to tone down the temperture
moderation, make the run-away icebox and greenhouse more likely, and take
tidal locking into account (yeah, I should have done that already, but I
didn\'t think I\'d be getting habitable planets that close :).

I haven\'t released this yet, because it\'s *really* rough, but I have been
using it to generate systems in a couple of my games already. My next task,
after toning down the homostatis a little, is to allow user input of the
system type, and the classes of stars.

Gentleman, pick up your dice and do a quick role play with your alter

outline above.  I would like to see a brief description of the fight.=20
No cheating.  You can pick any system, just give us a warning to what it
is.

I have done several of these with different stats and skill levels
(about 12 years ago when we were developing my current House Traveller

will try and find the box and share.

Whoa, whoa, wait a minute. From previous posts re: max dice, I took it
that the higher the max. number of dice a critter took, the *easier*
it is to blow it away (it\'s taking more damage).

A short Chirper with hollow bird bones has much less body mass than a
K\'kree. Because of the inherent weakness in its body structure (as
opposed to a K\'kree), the max dice should be higher than that of a
K\'kree to reflect how much easier it is to take the little sucker.

At least this appears to be the effect. Am I missing something?

I have already instituted a similar system. You have articulated much

"Voodoo Planet" goes between "Plague Ship" and "Postmarked the Stars".
It\'s short, so it was usually found as half of an Ace Double.

Other useful Norton:

"Storm Over Warlock"/"Ordeal in Otherwhere"
"???? Janus"/"Victory on Janus"
"Night of Masks"
"The Zero Stone"/"Uncharted Stars"

In the US this is "The Legion of Space" and usually also contains the
short novel "The Cometeers". BTW, I bet Calos would turn pale if he got
a report like this:

	"All they have are a few oddly bent chunks of wire, too flimsy
to pick a lock, I gave them back, and as I lefty one of them was
muttering something about \'AKKA\'?"

(all the Jack Williamson fans in earshot *cringe* :-)

Well, the round is going to weigh under an ounce. Call it 25 grams.
Muzzle velocity? Call it 1500 m/sec. That gives us a momentum of 37.5
kg m/sec. So, the momentun transfer is equivalent to getting hit by
37.5 kg at 1 m/s. That\'s *not* going to break your arm, not with it
spread acros the entire forearm. It\'ll be *less* impact than a good,
solid blow from a mace. 

On the other hand a military round *does* take some stopping. Last time
we went plinking, a friend stupidly fired his SKS at a terget rest only
rated for .22. By sheer luck, he hit a support. The support was mild
steel, 1/8" wide by about an inch thick. The round took out 3/4" of it...
And that wasn\'t an "armor piercing" round!

Of course, it wouldn\'t dig a hole that deep in a steel *plate*, but it
does get the point across.

Here\'s the way it was explained to me...

A good fighter with a rapier can beat a good fighter with sword and shield.
A good fighter with an epee can beat a good fighter with a rapier.
But a good fighter with an epee *loses* to a good fighter with sword & shield.

Weapon\'s "superiority" isn\'t transitive.

There\'s supposedly even a historical "proof", involving a French
nobleman who challenged a Scandanavian "noble". The Frenchman brought
his fancy new epee. The Scandanavian brought broadsword & shield. The
Scandanavian lost some blood. They buried the Frenchman. :-)

I think the best system was in MT, living costs equalled SOC x Cr250
per month; conspicious consumption, largess, higher quality clothes
food, quarters etc. being required to maintain your SOC level. If you
didn\'t spend enough on your upkeep, your SOC dropped; or if you spent
enough it went up. This put average living costs between Cr1500 and
Cr 2250 per month.

I also seem to remember a quote from sometime in the late 70\'s or
early 80\'s which gave a rough "exchange" rate of 1cr = $0.50 US.

Also bear in mind that the average income for Earth Circa 1990 is
only around US$100 per month (ie average living costs for US and
say Bangladesh are going to a little different).

Any rules, ideas or anything similar that anyone would care to share.

One thing I\'ve always like about Droyne is their wonderful role-play
potential.  Sure, 4 of the Castes (Worker, Warrior, Drone, and Technician)
are hopeless as PC\'s (always needing a leader around to tell you what to
do would be a bit of a problem), Leaders are still sort of limited and not
good at independent action, but Sports practically have PC written all over
them.  Weasely, renegade, Sport thieves/conmen has been used as NPCs and 
PCs more than once.  How have other folks faired with them?

We really need a book with more cultural info, descriptions of city life, 
what some of the more interesting Droyne worlds are like...

I do have a few rule suggestions.  

1) To adapt Droyne to MT, TNE, or T4 they need an Education score, rolling
all EDU skills vs. INT simply doesn\'t work for me.  While giving them an
EDU of 1D6 would work this means all the char gen tables must be
redesigned.  Since Droyne are educated throughout their lives we could
simply say that their EDU always equals their INT, since all Droyne are
given training and education commensurate with their level of intelligence
(ie the smart ones are given more education). 

2) For the t4 Aging rules, Drones, Warriors, Workers and Technicians get
+3 (ie worse) to all aging rolls.  They also start aging at 20.  Sports
and leaders age at the same rate as humans. 
   
3) Use the tables listed in the CT Droyne Alien book and simply give the 
little critters 1 skill/year + 1 upon Casting and 1/Distinction (as well 
as the 6 pts in Background and Common skills everyone gets.

So any other thoughts on playing Droyne?

Excellent source for a pre-jump tech civilization that\'s spread through

"Between Planets"
	A swampy Venus, with "dragons" as natives. Also good stuff

"Red Planet"
	Mars as a "thin" atmosphere planet, natives are tripedal.
"Farmer in the Sky"
	Ganymede as a Terraformed moon of a gas giant, more
	interplanetary Travel. Some side effects of terraforming, and
        an interesting "Ancient" artifact.
"Time for the Stars"

> 7.  The first Stainless Steel Rat book, by Harry Harrison.

The "Deathworld" books by Harrison.

If you can find a copy, "Battle on Mercury" by Erik van Lhin is a
rather good 1950s sf juvenile set on *Mercury*. This is the pre-flyby
Mercury with one face always to the sun. It details the planet ok, and
has some *different* aliens. So you get a *weird* planet, and weird
natives, all in one book.

Also, "Trouble on Titan" by Alan E Nourse is ok for non-terraformed gas
giant moons. Nice touches like a jet plane that uses O2 as fuel and
burns it with the methane atmosphere.

Actually, people on horsback originally bore to the left-hand side of the 
road, so as to be able to draw their swords to meet an attack from 
someone approaching from the other direction.

The reason why in Europe people drive on the right-hand side of the road

Why they do so in the US? I don\'t know.

I know for a fact that the RN\'s Trafalger Batch II do and so do the Vanguards,

	I personally like the idea of automatic shotguns with short
barrels; say a 25-round drum, full-auto with a barrel about 12" long, and
you\'ve got one nasty weapon that probably won\'t blow holes in the hull, and
due to a minor exploitation of the T4 rules, will do 8 dice to the primary
target when firing full auto.  Of course, it\'s not much use against
BattleDress, but an unarmoured target will be turned into a big puddle of
strawberry jam...

His development stuff is pretty rough right now. He told me he was

your message to him. When he gets it cleaned up, I\'ll post it to the
TML, if he agrees to it (which he probably will).

The defense for this was to grab your opponets rapier and do the same. This
is the basis for the sword exchange in the last act of "Hamlet". Otherwise,

  I like this idea. Maybe we could rewrite the charter for Xboat...? It

Well, there are goodf points and bad points about this proposed 
schedule: 
1. it fits the Millieux rather well so that\'s a pro!
2. The combinations are appealing (+)
however,
3. the first 4 books would mainly focus those races where there\'s 
already a lot of material, which could easily be reprinted.(-)
4. Considereing the speed of releases, we won\'t see the lesser 
developed races (Zhos, Droyne, K\'Kree, Hivers) before 2-3 years have 
gone by! (-)  
5. The Vilani aren\'t a truly Alien race, just a branch of humanity, 
so those newbies that we\'re trying to pull in might feel cheated if 
they get a human race in an Alien module.
 
- ->         1. VILANI / Geonee  / Newts / Bonus: Answerin 
- ->         2. VARGR  / Suerrat / Hhkar / Bonus: Brinn
- ->         3. ASLAN / Ormine / Darrian / Bonus: Zhodia colonies
- ->         4. SOLOMANI / Vegans / Geneered races/ Bonus: Sworld Worlders
- ->         5. ZHODANI / Vlazhdumecta / Addaxur / Bonus: Roth Thokken
- ->         6. DROYNE / Chirpers / Jigd-Il-Jagd / Bonus: Primordials
- -> 
My fave order would rather be:
2/5/3/6/4/1
This order is dictated by the publication order of the milieux and 
the amount of info already available! 

- ->         Maybe we could reach a consensus and forward it to IG before they
- -> release that Aslan/Vargr book... ;-)
I would very much hope so...  
BTW: Who says that the millieux will be published in historical 
order? If they aren\'t there could be another schedule for those books 
because of that too! Maybe we should ask IG to push M:1100 or 1000 
directly after M:200. That way, we would see the Zho- Alien Book 
earlier!
I was a bit disappointed that M: 200 got pushed back to next year, 
because i always felt that the great strenght of the Milieu concept 
was CHOICE! The more Milieux there are the more players will have a 
choice of what M: to use! Supplement and adventures could support the 
older M: even if a newer one has already been published!

This problem was fixed, and later errata released by GDW beefed up plasma
weapons so that if you were hit, you died, and even better, if you were

I couldn\'t agree more! I also felt that, although the pictures on the

one has to offer so that people see it, and the best place to do this

A good idea, and one that merits consideration! I didn\'t even have to 
be extensive info, just maybe 2-4 pages of the most basic background 
info, what the imperium is and how it works. Kind of like "An 
Introduction to Traveller" in the olden days! That would explain lots 
to new players and be of much help to those who don\'t want to sink 
more money into a new game than absolutely necessary at first (Don\'t

I had a couple of PC\'s role play a group of Droyne a few years ago. 
There is one thought about that experience.  Most people seem to view

BUT you still have to do all this to stop them 
The poor guy in Diplo is going through hell
The argument about paint though is sort of like trying to slip a knife between the plates on 
Maximilian Plate Armour. So who is going to volunteer? Sure it is possible BUT all he has 
to do is swing his weapon. ou have to do a called shot and get really close
And as far as using a blow torch, lessee, range 1m?
Incidentally these same types of agruments were used against troops wearing helmets 
during WWI. They noticed that, after troops started wearing helmets, head injuries 
increased precipitously. Some said look how dangerous those things are! What they initially 
failed to check was the fact that the number of head _deaths_ had dropped by roughly the 
same amount. Same goes for BP vests. injuries to the torso rise. With the weapons of the 
future, armour prevents your very expensively trained soldiers from dying. BD protects 
near 100% against small arms, fragmentation and plasma splash.
Personally, between being shredded by collateral damage and running the risk of being 
attacked by some loony with a blowtorch, I will risk the blowtorch

   Several people have expressed the opinion that swords are more
   useful than guns for shipboard combat due to the delicate nature of
   starship interiors. I have heard variants of this position taken
   since 1978, way back in "pre-imperial" times.

   But I remain sceptical. If swords are so useful for ship combat in
   Traveller, why don\'t modern day marines use them (for other than
   ceremonial purposes) on board modern warships? Everything I\'ve read
   about the interiors of Traveller merchant ships leads me to believe
   that they are at least as durable (indeed, even more so) than the
   interiors of modern naval escorts.

   Perhaps one of our resident marines would be kind enough to enlighten
   us as to the (unclassified, of course) theory of modern naval
   shipboard combat. Thanks in advance!

   Because wagoneers sat on the left side of their benches, so they
   could hold the reins in their right hand while they worked the hand
   brake with their left. As they jockeyed around one another on those
   narrow muddy roads, they liked to keep each other on their left sides
   so they could better see the relative positions of their wagons.

It\'s a question of tactics.  As someone else pointed out, the true advantage
to BD is the increased information flow coming into the soldier.  Picture
for a momment what the average Marine sees as he moves in his BDA.

He probably has a weapons status screen, telling him how many rounds he has
avalible, wether the safty is activated, and possibly what type of round is
loaded for heavier weapons.  He also may have a locator beacon, which allows
him to tell where his buddies are, even in poor visability conditions.

When fired upon, the radar controlling the point-defence laser will most
likely provide a visual "trail" of the projectile\'s flight path, making it
easier for the soldier to immediately return fire.  This information would
probably be shared among members of the fire team, so that instantly all
four Marines are aware of the threat, and can execute an Immediate Action
drill for the contact.  If a Marine is hit and wounded, medical sensors will
note the sudden change in the body\'s vital signs, and dump stabilizing
medication into the blood stream, try to isolate the area where armor was
penetrated, and start screaming for a corpsman on a special reserved radio
frequency.

The squad leader in this senario will be able to monitor the status and
location of all his men, and will be aware of the tactical situation within
seconds.  It even be that he can "look through their eyes" by mean of a
small camera mounted on the helmet.  The Sergeant can then easily call for
additional forces, artillery or ortillery, air support, or manuver his own
squad to defeat the threat.

The important advantage BDA equipped troopers have is the "action cycle" is,
for them, very short.  The improved abilty to process information at all
levels allow for quick and deceisive action in times that leave their
unaugmented brethern still trying to figure out where in the hell the
shooting is coming from.

Battle Dress is the best way to give life to Patton\'s belief that the job of
the Army is too close with the enemy and destoy him by a combination of
speed, shock, and maneuver.

I disagree again. Education is *not* equivalent to learned skills. =
Skills are *not* just application of learned knowledge.

To use some real world examples, there are very talented and skilled =
people (carpenters, farmers, taxi drivers, martial artists) living in =
the third world who haven\'t had a lick of schooling.

And there are well educated people who appear on _Jeopardy_ who =
couldn\'t even change a tire.

Here\'s my definition, and the distinction I make between skills and =
education:

A skill is the _practical_ application of *experience* and knowledge. =
You can\'t just learn a skill by reading a book. Oh, you might get a =
basic understanding, but a prerequisite to aquiring skill-1 is =
actually *trying* to accomplish tasks requiring the skill. Multiple =
times. And ideally under the direction and supervision (or by =
"mimiking") someone with the skill.

Education is not *just* the body of general knowledge absorbed by a =
character, it also encompasses the ability to aquire and retain =
knowledge. This ability can be "trained", just as a body-builder can =
increase strength, a long-distance runner can increase his endurance, =
etc.

I\'ve known very *intelligent* people who seem to be quite na=EFve =
about what to me is common knowledge. I\'ve known smart people who =
have a devil of a time memorizing facts and details. I\'ve also known =
educated people who if given a problem requiring a modicum of =
Intelligence and problem-solving ability, seem to have trouble.

I think the difference between Intelligence, Education, and the =
learned body of skills is distinct.

I don\'t like the T4 definition, nor the way EDU points are handed out =
willy-nilly just by attending a few years of University. Education =
doesn\'t go hand-in-hand with just learned material. It\'s the =
*ability* to learn.

Just MHO of course.

   I\'m tellen ya, just shoot him with a RAM HEAP grenade. He\'ll be dead,
   and if you miss, your starship bulkheads will stop the rocket, no

This depends on exactly how Virus reproduces.  My guess is that it would not
have done well.  Yes, this does somewhat debunk the reports in the TNE
material that Other Areas of space were destroyed too, but, I think two
things should be remembered.  1) The TNE books were written from the
perspective of the Reformation Coalition, and to the best of their
knowledge, no one did survive except the Hiver.  The truth could be that no
one who survived wanted to come anywhere near the Imperial sector.  2)
Remember that anyone who travelled in Imperial space (with the possible
exception of invading fleets although a good arguement could be made that
they would have them too) had the Deyo chip Transponder.

All in all, given the facts, I don\'t find Virus unbelievable. (see below)

Right, I understood that, and this comment wasn\'t intended to go to you, but
to anyone who would choose to join in this thread.  You are welcome to your
opinion, and no one should try to remove that right from you.  I simple was
stating mine and as I said above, it is that I do not find Virus that
unbelievable based on what limited information we know about it.  A weak
analogy could be made to the discovery that the world was round.  No matter
how many or few people lived (and died) thinking it was flat, the fact was
that it was/is/will be round.  No matter how many people (players or
characters) don\'t like, don\'t understand, and don\'t believe Virus, it is
(for the present) here.  And I for one hope it doesn\'t leave.

Well, I do understand, and I can appreciate it because the same thing
happened to me with the Reformation Coalition Setting.  I have mentioned
before that I didn\'t have the privelege of playing Traveller at all during
CT, and I played only a little MT.  I finally got head over heals (and
really learned what Traveller was) during TNE.  To me, TNE is Traveller,
just as much as to some others, CT (or MT) IS Traveller.  Now, we are not
getting our favorites because we are at M0.  While here, I am running an M0
campaign. :)

Yeah, I wasn\'t really happy with all the rules, but the problem you

Anyway, My post repsponding to yours is not intended to be a Flame War
ignition switch, Its just that during the last Fame War, MANY MANY people
would give their take on why Virus WOULD NOT work only to announce later
that they didn\'t read Survival Margin (IMHO the best explanation of Virus
and its origins).  The problem was, as you said, that the nice pleasant
environment of the Imperium was destroyed, and rather than admit that they
were issed off about that, they attacked Virus (with only half knowledge).

THUDDD will shortly be in my court, (Roderick says, Finally), and I wanted
to make a few announcements first.

First, continue to send entries to Roderick until Saturday night when he
will get them all together and send them to me.  Once Roderick posts the
entries to the list, please send your votes to me at:

tiger@goldinc.com

Not to Roderick.  That\'s right, after the entries are in, I will be taking
over the voting for this THUDDD.  I plan (for now) to allow the voting for
two weeks, through the 23 of March, then we will take a week off, and I will
announce the next ship that is to be designed. (I have to work the 15th and
I doubt if I can get to tallying the votes before then).  If you haven\'t
sent your list of desired ships to me yet, this is the last call for them
(use the subject line "THUDDD overall voting").  Here are the rules for
voting for the regular entries:

1.  Each voting person can vote only once.

2.  No entrant is allowed to vote for his (or her) own entry.

3.  All votes MUST be sent directly to me at:  tiger@goldinc.com
      Any votes sent anywhere else WILL NOT be counted.

4.  All votes MUST get in before the deadline.  Late votes will be discarded.

5.  All votes MUST include the subject line "THUDDD Vote"  If this subject
line is not used, I will try to catch the vote, but if it gets left off, I
will not be held responsible.

6.  Vote for the top three designs in each catagory.  Only vote for three
ships, and use as few comments as possible.  Catagories include:

      Best Overall Design:
      Most Likely to Use in a Game:
      Closest to Design Paramaters:
      Cheapest Efficient Design:  (note, this is not the cheapest design)
      Most Interesting Design:

7.  I will give each ship voted for a 1, 2, or 3 respectively, and every
other ship will get a 4.  When the voting is done, the totals will be
computed and the winner of each catagory will be announced (total USP) and
the runners up (#\'s 2-5) will be listed (Ship class/name only).


I think that\'s it for now.

It\'s only 2.8% higher than it was on my detailed Hit Location Table. Here\'s
the relevant bit:

16       top of torso                  Throat 1p/r   Spine
15 15    neck                          Throat 1p/r   Spine

12 12    cranium/crown   Stuns 1 rd    Frac/Conc     Brain
11 11    cranium/ear     Stuns 1 rd    Frac/Conc     Brain 

I just collapsed all these locations down to "1 = Head/Neck".

I should have pointed out that the Quick Hit Location table is intended
mainly for ranged weapon attacks, and also most melee attacks. The
distribution is weighted towards the chest, and also there\'s a higher
chance of head hits than you\'d get in a random hit distribution.

If the chance of head/neck hits is too high for you, you can always make a
second roll on a table similar to the" relevant bit" quoted above.

But I wanted a quicker, simpler version of Hit Location, and whenever you
simplify you have to accept some loss of realism.

Thanks for the comments,

 Sable, on a bezant rayonn�, an annulet of the field.

 Alternatively: Sable, on a sun Or, an annulet of the field.

 ROTFL!  But, stacking charges is quite all right.  You don\'t
 run into trouble [IN SCA HERALDRY] until the fourth layer
 (i.e., field, a on b on c), and there is at least one way of
 blazoning it that has everything on a single layer (see my
 other message on this thread).  Besides, other jurisdictions
 may have different rules.

 One of these days I _have_ to finish up my article on Vilani
 jewel-heraldry.

I disagree.  The a character in T4 has more skills than a CT 
charcter, but each skill level for each skill is still about the 
same.

I think that CT characters always had too few skills, and the T4 gen 
system fixed that.

But, Medical-3 in CT equals the same amount of skill that Medical-3 
means in T4.

Well, the problem you will have with this fix is the skill level not 
meaning anything problem.

You know, the Pilot-4/Dex-6 vs Pilot-1/Dex-10 problem.

Attrubutes are still much more important than skills under your 
simpler fix, and I\'m against that.

This is why you must have some sort of multiplier to use with the 
skill level--to make it more important to the target number.

Have you read To Die in Italbar by Roger Zelazny?  (Read Isle of the Dead first, if 
you want the story to go in chronological order, although each stands perfectly on its 
own.)  To Die in Italbar is one of my favorite Zelazny stories, and concerns ... I guess 
you could say, the goddess of pestilence.

Do the Zhodani see their front yard, then, as lying to coreward and spinward?  I\'ll bet 
that there are societies out there that we don\'t know anything about.  Are those core

In light of our recent discussion of the uselessness of shields, will there still be an 
escutcheon in the 47th century?  Are Imperial arms so heavily influenced by Solomani 
tradition that they\'ll be in the form of a shield?  What was Vilani heraldry like, and 
will it have an influence here?

What are the arms of Zhunastu? of Sylea? of the Sylean Federation?  How are they 
combined into the Imperial arms, if at all?  Why or why not?

You might want a gold field with a black ring and black disk rayony -- I\'m thinking of 
the flag on the cover of Rebellion Sourcebook.  Maybe the colors are only reversed on 
flags and military insignia?

I don\'t think that you get to be dynastic leader of a star-spanning empire by being a 
nice guy.  Being a good guy probably hurts more than it helps, too.  On the other hand, 
you don\'t have to be the embodiment of evil like the Emperor or his henchman Darth 
Vader.  Most of us on the list have probably been playing for a long time, and see Cleon 
from the perspective of the 1100s, and from the fringes of the Imperium.  That\'s plenty 
of time and space to whitewash everything about him.  

During Cleon\'s lifetime, he certainly did what he could to control information about 
himself to present a noble image on which a long-lasting political entity could be 
based.  This probably included liquidation, intimidation, and marginalization of those 
who still supported the Sylean Federation.  I have yet to read Milieu Zero, but when I 
do I\'ll start posting my own take on it.

Some traditions, I suspect, have purposes beyond merely being traditions.  Training in 
cutlass sets the Marine apart -- in his own mind -- from the other services and from 
civilians.  In that way it builds morale.  As either Loren or Marc pointed out in an 
editorial in JTAS some years ago (I\'ll get the citation if you want it):  The U.S. army 
still gives bayonet training, and the bayonet hasn\'t had serious military application 
since WWI.  Nevertheless, the physical and mental training associated with the weapon 
build individual and group morale.  

Is the blade now -- and will it be in the future -- the best tradition to achieve morale 
objectives?  Maybe, or maybe not.

   -Rob

Sure Rob.  Having spent 9 years in the military, (4 Navy, 5 Marine) I
have a unique perspective on that question.  In General, the US Navy
doesn=92t have to worry too much about boarders (in fact the last time, I
think, the Navy sent away boarding parties was during WWII to capture
U-505). During my time off the coast of Beirut we did have a series of
drills to practice our repel boarders skills.  The scenario was a series
of small boats and aircraft attacking/landing on the USS Independence at
the same time. Both the Marines and MAA (Masters At Arms, i.e. ships
troops) participated.  One squad of Marines was tasked to be the
Terrorist  (With red shirts and large letters spelling out Terrorist).=20
The weapons of choice for the Marines ended up being the shotgun with
pistols, For the Navy it turned out to be the billy club.  Several
Marines ended up in the hospital, and further drills were canceled.=20
What it did show is that in the very small confines on board ship the
combat tended to be very close, with the troops towards the rear unable
to do anything but watch.

Hope that helps. I do not think that ANY Marine would ever think to use
a sword in combat.  Only for show, and dress. Unless you consiter the
K-BAR a short sword.

	Well, *I* think that the UPP, chargen, and task systems are kinda
busted in the area of schooling.  Education gives you skills, not some
undefined "educatedness".  This treatment of education as a stat is poorly
concieved, and IMHO severly broken, as it is a poor mapping of human
capabilities.  Here\'s an example of why:

	I have 1 year of nursery school, 1 year of kindergarten, 6 years of
grade school, 5 years of high school, 2 years of CEGEP (junior college to
our US friends) and 6.5 years of university education (BA and an BCL and
LLB in progress) under my belt, giving me an EDU of, let\'s say for
argument\'s sake, B.

	Thus, were I to somehow acquire a level of, say, Astrogation, my
target number for an average roll would be 13.

	However, aside from a stats course I took in my undergrad, I have
not taken any hard science or mathematics courses since high school; I
studied anthropophagy, sociology, and psychology in CEGEP, anthropophagy in
my BA, and have been studying law for 3.5 years.  This, I submit, has
absolutely diddley/squat to do with astrogation, and should not be factored
into my roll.

	Indeed, my having learned about various social sciences and the law
should only be taken into account when making rolls based on psych, soc,
anthro, or law.  However, my having been to school and learned about them
is already represented on my character sheet in the skills section, so why
should it also be reflected in the stats section and recalculated in the
roll?

	I submit that a better modelling of how education enhances a
person\'s capabilities is simply to put what the character learns into the
skill side of the sheet, and roll skills based on intelligence (or other
mental stats) plus those education-acquired skills.

	IMHO, StoryTeller models the mental aspects of humans much better;
it has three mental stats called Intelligence, Perception, and Wits (which
measures quick reaction in urgent/high pressure situations), and any of
these can be rolled in conjunction with the skills classified as
"Knowledges", which are acquired via education (they can be rolled with any
other skills too).  So, a Perception+Sensors roll could be required to
notice subtly anomalous readings, an Intelligence+Sensors roll to determine
that they\'re emanating from a stealthed Zhodani DD, and a Wits+Tactics roll
to determine what to do about it.

	I think that these are a pretty good reflection of how people
think, personally, much more so than T4\'s INT and EDU stats...

I always thought it originated with the US Cavalry in the 1800s making
it easier for mounted troops to fire carbines from horseback. If a
horse soldier is right-handed, it\'s much easier to shoot towards his

i noticed you haven\'t tried to convert the PGMP or FGMP yet.... i\'ve been
working on them plus some more armor like the original combat armour
they used to have and sort of style like the storm trooper stuff...

Boidroids?  Are these the kind that are also given to Gentile children,
were made from vegetable foodstuffs (during the metallo-crisis), and were
commonly named after old cowboys?

If so, then these are the same as those that used to be called (wait for it)
Roy, the soy goy toy boidroid. 

Whew.

The only person funnier than me is Cowboy Wally (if you don\'t know, don\'t

This could be well illustrated in a wargame (like Striker, maybe).  Normally, in a 
two-player game, each player knows almost everything about the location of his and his 
opponent\'s units, as well as their status (in this context -- small unit 
actions -- remaining ammunition, fatigue, morale, wounds, mobility, etc.).  Most games 
try to recreate the fog of war by hiding this information to some extent (dummy 
counters, e.g.).  We could enhance this effect to reflect the real advantage of BD by 
revising the communications rules in Striker.  For example, as to every BD-equipped 
unit, the player knows everything -- actual location, all units in line of sight, 
status, etc.  As to non-BD units, the player knows only what is reported by 
communications every turn during a communications phase -- and that communication would 
have to go via a chain of command, turn by turn:

Turn One:
Non-BD private is hit.  He yells for help.
BD private is hit.  His BD calls for help.

Turn Two:
Non-BD corporal (fire team leader) radios to squad or platoon for help.
BD ambulance moves to pick up BD private.

Turn Three:
Non-BD platoon leader directs ambulance to pick up private.
BD ambulance picks up BD private.

Turn Four:
Non-BD ambulance moves to pick up private.
BD private is in transit to aid station.

Etc.  This needs some playtesting, but the effects of almost immediate ortillery versus 
ortillery delayed several turns should be devastating.

I\'ve never been in the military, but I\'ll take a stab at some issues raised here:

I think that in general we\'re just talking about the bridge and engineering when we\'re 
considering collateral damage in shipboard combat.  The bulkheads hold up fairly well 
(we have breaching rules in Snapshot, I think, and elsewhere), and who cares if your 
internal spaces have a few holes?  The bridge and engineering department have 
instruments, notably computers, sensors, and regulatory equipment, that can be easily 
destroyed or at least damaged by small arms fire, and even more so by explosives and 
energy weapons.  This is true on ships today, I would think.  You shoot the sonar panel 
on a submarine, and you\'re blind until it\'s fixed --

and that\'s why we start worrying about collateral damage more in starship combat than on 
the high seas of the 20th Century CE.  If you\'re in jumpspace and weapons fire damages 
the controls of the jump grid, you\'re dead.  No one can save you.  Even if you\'re in a 
star system, you may be a week (i.e., a micro-jump) from rescue -- and you may not be in 
a star system with any rescue capability, anyway.

These are issues to consider when you\'re trying to capture a ship.  Let\'s consider the 
contexts of ship capture:  You\'ve either blasted a ship in space combat so that it has 
neither maneuver nor weapons and are putting on a prize crew (following High Guard 
rules, e.g.), or you\'re hijacking it (or running a mutiny).

The prize crew -- whether pirates or marines -- wants to avoid further internal damage 
if you can, but only to preserve the value of what you\'ve captured.  You probably have 
support craft nearby to take you off if you can\'t do enough repairs to take the prize 
home.  Defenders here probably don\'t mind any more collateral damage -- they\'re trying 
to make the capture as expensive as possible for the enemy.  Pirates may just be going 
after the cargo, and won\'t worry about damage to the ship\'s controls.  This scenario 
generally occurs in a star system -- at a gas giant, a main world, or in between.  If 
the world has rescue capability, damage to the ship is of less concern.

If you\'re a hijacker, you definitely want to avoid (or at least minimize) collateral 
damage.  Your own survival depends on the survival of the ship and its systems -- 
leaving aside your profit motive for the moment.  Hijack attempts may take place after 
jump, or during gas giant refuelling, or in orbit around a low-tech world, when no local 
vessels can come to the rescue.  In each of these cases, the hijackers want to conclude 
the hijack with a ship that they can use with a minimum of field repairs.  

If you\'re defending a hijack, you\'re in the same boat as the hijackers -- loss of your 
computer or life support can kill you (and your passengers, depending on the type of 
ship).  

Mutineers face the same issues as hijackers.  

I would be interested in the official view.  I wonder if the various marines of the 
world publish this kind of doctrine on web pages yet?

That can\'t be right.  Education level is the amount of schooling that sticks.  Look, 
e.g., at the rules for college and the academies.  You have to roll for an increase in 
education, even though you did all four years.

Any idea what they do with their mechanical, industrial, and (especially)
biological waste?  Do they recycle their waste water?  Six months as a
closed system is a _long_ time (and isn\'t the record something like two
years?).

As for Traveller, I\'d be willing to bet that some combination of the
computers, jump drives, and power plant consume a small but important
amount of oxygen (consume as in not give it back in the form of any
oxidized compound), OR put out something like excess nitrogen or excess
ozone that isn\'t easily crackable with commercial filters, thus reducing
the effectiveness of scrubbers.  This consumption or production is probably
just accepted and ignored by ship designers since it\'s been that way
forever, and since airing out isn\'t generally that big of a deal.  Probably
you could by better scrubbers, but the cost and maintenance doubles for
each additional, say, 10% increase in efficiency.  

Hand-waving mode off. :)

Yep, combine their size with their Psi abilities and you\'ve one

a raid on a Virus-laden computer onboard an crashed Droyne warship.
Aside from providing the only deckplan ever published for a Droyne
ship (AFAIK), it provided a few details into how Droyne actually
work in combat. Unfortunately, the adventure didn\'t go far enough
in taking into account their Telepathy ability to provide an
undetecable/unjammable taccom system.

Another great 2300AD adventure is "Rotten to the Core". It, of course,
deals with cybertech and netrunning but not overwhelmingly so. It could
be run on most relatively hi-tech worlds.

For that matter, use the external views of ships from "Ships of the
French Arm" and redesign their capabilities to fit T4. For anyone
running TNE, look to the Space Opera starship supplements for
quick-and-dirty designs. And I absolutely *love* some of the vehicle
external views from Battletech.

Don\'t pass on *any* sci-fi/futuristic military RPG supplements w/o
looking thru them for usable material/illustrations. Good places to
look are discount/half-price book stores.

  Well, here is my second draft on converting High Guard ships to a T4
  universal ship profile. This features new rules for nuclear dampers
  (severely broken in the previous rules) as well as rules for meson
  screens and repulsors. There is also some discussion of the armor
  conversion rules, with more alternative systems proposed.

  Converting from High Guard USP\'s to the new USP\'s in Marc Miller\'s
  Traveller.
  
TONS    ----
  
  The T4 tonnage is the same as the HG tonnage. Take the Tonnage USP
  value directly from the HG USP.
  
  For the hull type, use the following table to go from the HG
  configuration USP to the T4 USP:
  
  HG USP          T4 USP
  ----          ----
  1               Needle/AF
  2               Wedge/AF
  3               Cylinder/SL
  4               Box/SL
  5               Shere/SL
  6               Dome/SL
  7               Close Structure/No SL
  8               Planetoid/No SL
  9               Planetoid/No SL
  
VOLUME  ----
  
  Volume is equal to tonnage times 14. V = 14 * T.
  
COST IN MCR     ----
  
  Same for T4 as in HG.
  
CREW    ----
  
  Same for T4 as in HG.
  
PASSENGERS HIGH/MEDIUM  ----
  
  Same for T4 as in HG.
  
PASSENGERS LOW  ----
  
  Same for T4 as in HG.
  
CARGO   ----
  
  Should be listed in tons; same for T4 as in HG.  If you list it in
  cubic meters instead, then multiply the HG USP for cargo by 14 to get
  the T4 USP.
  
CONTROLS        ----
  
  For starships, Mil Std/Bridge. For small craft, Mil Std or Mil
  Std/Bridge if you include a small craft bridge. If the HG computer USP
  is A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H or J, then add "/fib" to the T4 USP.
  
TECH LEVEL      ----
  
  Same for T4 as in HG.
  
SIZE RATING     ----
  
  Use the table below to convert from the HG USP size rating to the T4
  USP:
  
  HG size USP     T4 size USP
  ----     ----
  0               7
  1-9             8
  A-J             9
  K-Q             10
  Q-X             11
  Y               12
  
JUMP RATING     ----
  
  Same for T4 as in HG.
  
G RATING THRUSTER PLATES
  
  Same for T4 as in HG.
  
POWER PLANT RATING
  
  Same for T4 as in HG. To get the power plant rating in MW, multiply
  the power-plant USP by the ship\'s tonnage, and multiply that by 2.5.
  Power in MW = 2.5 * Tonnage * PP.
  
FIRE CONTROL RATING and SENSOR RATINGS
  
  I suggest getting these from the HG "computer" USP using the following
  table:
  
  HG computer USP T4 fire control USP     T4 Sensor USP\'s

ARMOR   ----
  
  I show below three schemes for converting HG armor values to those
  of T4. Scheme \'A\' is my recommended, simple, arbitrary scheme. It\'s
  biggest weakness is that it can lead to abusively powerful small
  craft designs. It works well for small ships with small armor values,
  big ships with high armor values, and medium sized ships with medium
  sized armor values.

  Scheme \'B\' is my interpolation of an "official" (but
  nonsensical) conversion detailed in Striker, which relates HG armor
  values to a single hull thickness. It works well for ships in the range
  of 500 - 2000 tons. 

  Scheme \'C\' is based on Wildstar\'s take on the 
  official conversion, which he explained here 6 months ago; here I did 
  not interpolate between the points. It works well for ships around 
  100,000 displacement tons.

  Below is a scheme based on equalizing the displacement of
  the armor in both HG and T4. It is the most "realistic" scheme (as
  if "realistic" meant anything in this context) since it is based
  on physical and geometrical principles. Unfortunately, the
  equation giving the relation between the HG and T4 USP\'s is a real
  monster. Here it is for HG armor factors equal to 15 or less:

      T4 = 4.7*(M*14*1000000/3.14*3/4)^(1/3)/3*(HG+1)/100

  where \'M\' is the ship\'s displacement in tons, \'HG\' is the High Guard
  armor USP rating. \'T4\' is the armor rated as centimeter\'s thickness of
  hard steel. After using this equation, take \'T4\' and go to the USD
  table in the back of "Starships", look up the USD value, and then
  multiply that value by 10. (And people wonder why I find the new
  ship-design rules so complicated!)

  Obviously, the above formulation is not amenable to a simple
  look-up table, but I did my best.

  To use the lookup table below, find the column for the hull
  tonnage closest to your ship\'s tonnage. Go down the column till
  you match your ship\'s HG armor rating (in the leftmost column).
  The number that you are referencing is the T4 armor value.

Ken, I don\'t see the difference... The value of each skill level is 
reduced by a third using his fix. So your Pilot-4/Dex-6 vs Pilot-1/Dex-10 
would become Pilot-1.3333/Dex-6 vs Pilot-0.33333/Dex-10. :-) Basically, 
he\'s redefining the value of skills: Beginner is Pilot-3, Professional is 
Pilot-9, Expert is Pilot-18...

Multiply the value by 3, or take 3x as many skill levels, and the result 
is the same. *IF* the extra skill levels are *not* used to raise 
attributes.

I do think the "simpler fix" *won\'t* work well for another reason: One 
could take level-1 in a whackload of skills and avoid an unskilled 
penalty in too many areas.

Which brings me to another point I\'ve been meaning to ask: How does 
KBv2.0 handle unskilled task rolls?

Though I haven\'t done the analysis, it seems to me quite a steep curve to 
divide the attribute by 2, since the die progression starts at 2D and 
ends at 7D.

Shoot, I don\'t expect unskilled characters to have the proverbial 
snowballs hope at Impossible levels (7D) but geez louise, I\'d need an 
attribute of 10 to even have a chance at a Difficult task!

One Idea: Make target roll straight Attribute (as with Skill-0) but 
increase the chance of Spectacular Failure.

I think if I attempted a task that I had no familiarity in, my chances to 
really foul things up should be higher, n\'est-ce pas?

So, forex, if SF is 3 sixes, make it 2 sixes for the unskilled.

Hey, maybe JOT won\'t be as bad! Sure JOT can be applied to the roll 
(without multiplying by three) but the chance of SF will remain as 
unskilled...

According to diction, Education is "a development of knowledge, skill,
ability, or character by teaching, training, study, or experience."
In RPGs, however, a stat such as "Wisdom" or "Education" is often
introduced to cover all of the countless "skills" (including various
areas of knowledge) that are frequently excluded from a roleplaying
system to keep things simple (nobody want\'s a tome the size of a phone
book dedicated to skills & knowledge :)

Sure they have.  It might not involve a brick schoolhouse or someone
with a teaching degree, but it is a form of "schooling", nonetheless.
It is a rare individual, indeed, that becomes a skilled carpenter or
farmer without being instructed by or exposed to *someone* or
*something* that already possesses such knowledge.

There\'s a big difference between those that do not know how to change
a tire and people that can\'t (physically not strong enough) or won\'t
(pompous individuals above such menial tasks).

The concept of changing a tire (raise vehicle up, remove fasteners, re
& re wheel, replace fasteners, lower vehicle) isn\'t at all difficult
for most of the population to conceptualize when confronted with a
flat tire.  Yet it is still knowledge that could translate into a
Traveller skill rating.  RPGs simplify this by lumping such "skills"
into the character\'s EDU stat.  This is how I would handle the EDU
stat in a RPG; not as a bonus to specific "skills", but as a form of
"Jack of all Trades".

The acquisition of "skills" in Traveller has always assumed both
theory _and_ practical experience.  I hope you are not saying that
someone with Medical-3 possesses no real (theoretical only) knowledge
of medicine save for what their EDU rating represents !?!

I wholeheartedly agree!  But by insisting that a RPG have both INT &
EDU stats, as well as a host of "skills", can disbalance things.  By
including an EDU stat to represent a character\'s "ability to learn",
one might ask, "Where are the statistics for Endurance, Agility,
Speed, Perception, Charisma, Willpower, etc.?"

True.  But if you examine Real Life(tm) closely, every bit of
knowledge that we possess or could possess could be defined as its own
"skill" with its own rating.  There would be no Education Rating as
such (except as you define as "the ability to learn and retain
knowledge").

> I think the difference between Intelligence, Education, and the
> learned body of skills is distinct.

I again agree.  But only as their definitions might specifically apply
to Real Life(tm).  In a roleplaying game, the breakdown of a
character\'s intellect into three different areas isn\'t really
necessary... IMHO.

As it should be, but I\'ve never considered EDU to be that relevant in
my game.  Is this kind of detail really necessary in a RPG which does
not bother to differentiate between Dexterity & Agility or Strength &
Endurance?

Of course :)

Droyne warriors should get a lot more respect than they do.  The Droyne
have, after all, been "civilized" so long that a "technician" caste has
evolved, just to invent, build, and maintain complicated tools.  Perhaps
the Droyne have been making and using "high-tech" weapons for so long that
the "warrior" caste has a *literally instinctive aptitude* for small unit
tactics, fire-fights, and so forth.  I think the "Moties," from "The Mote
in God\'s Eye," could serve as a moderately good model for Droyne (at least
regarding caste specialization and adaptation to hundreds of thousands of
years of technological civilization).

If the data gathered by all of the sensors in, say, a squad, were combined
and checked against one another by a "tactical computer," interesting
things would become possible. Suppose, for example, that soldier "A" can\'t
see a potential target, because there\'s a wall in his way.  Soldiers "B" 
and "C", however, can see this target. The tactical computer "paints" a
translucent, "greyed-out" picture of this hidden target for soldier "C,"
using data from "A" and "B" (corrected for distance, and the angle from
which it is being "viewed"). This image would be "painted" right onto the
inner surface of the suit\'s visor.  Soldier "C" could then blast through
that wall with his FGMP-14, without waiting to be consciously informed of
the target\'s presence by "A" or "B".  Likewise, the tactical computer
could "tint" the images of potential targets, to indicate whether they\'re
in range or not...the possibilites are endless.

I can\'t argue with you. Your example and description of the StoryTeller 
system does sound like a well thought-out system, and it seems superior 
to Traveller\'s INT and EDU.

Y\'know, I just might adapt such a system to my Traveller campaign... I 
can see it now, 3 physical stats: STR, DEX, CON; and 3 mental stats: 
INT(Mental Strength), WIT(Mental Quickness), PER(Mental Stamina). I like 
the symmetry...

A 7.62mm hunting rabbits?  Now *that\'s* sporting! A 22 (5.??), is overkill
for a rabbit. A 7.62 is built to kill man-sized targets at *long* ranges.

Concerning the effect of hitting a body with a big, fast round...doesn\'t
this have to do with hydrostatic shock or something?  The bullet passing
through at high speed sends off a shockwave in the body..right? For a small
animal it would simply blow it apart.  As far as the 7.62mm and the rabbit,
I\'m sure *most* of the energy stayed with the bullet after it had passed
though, and expended itself knocking a hole through a tree or something.

I agree with you here.

If there is going to be an EDU attribute, it should measure how well, how
quickly, and how much a PC can learn things in an
EDUCATIONAL environment.  In my games, EDU is a character\'s
"book-learning, book-using" ability, it\'s his aptitude for
scholarship.  INT is the "street-learning, experience-using" ability of a
PC.

I keep going back to TNE and trying to use it.  <sigh> The mechanics are

I think you\'re rating the skills too high...too soon. ;->

Here\'s what I think:

Level 0 - You saw somebody do it once, and if you\'re lucky you won\'t
          hurt yourself trying.

Level 1 - Novice apprentice or beginning student after a few months
          of study.

Level 2 - Advanced apprentice or student after a couple years of
          study.

Level 3 - Journeyman, BS/BA graduate, Medical Student.

Level 4 - Journeyman nearing Master status, a Professional with
          on-the-job experience, someone with an advanced education
          like a Masters or even PhD, or a practicing MD.

Level 5 - A Master of a craft, an Expert in a field, or a medical
          specialist with the training and experience to back it up.

Level 6 - A Grand Master, a leading authority in the field, or a
          Guru.

Level 7 - Yoda, Steven Hawking or Michael Jordan.

Level 8 - "...in the beginning..."

I disagree with your definition.  I know plenty of people who have a piece
of paper that says they have a college degree who don\'t have any
measureable skills (at least as far as I can tell).  :-)  

I still think your EDU measures how much schooling you have, not how many
skills you have.

This is a good point and one I didn\'t consider.  I don\'t have a good answer
for it, other than to make an exception for a player who can define the
culture of his homeworld as such.

I might be willing to agree with this, but then why does T4 define like this:

  "measures amount of schooling"

I suppose you could allow a variety of places *where* the schooling took
place (ie technocratic priesthoods), but I don\'t think you can change the
fact that it\'s formal schooling.

Uh, but T4 defines EDU as a measure of schooling.  Ooops.  Given that
definition, EDU *must* equal formal education.  One could dicker about how
and where that education takes place (ie, tradition college vs personal
tutor), but it\'s still schooling.

Does that dork with the rest of your arguments?

I think the key word here is "limited".  How many companies hire biologists
who are "self taught"?  Or chemists, or engineers, or geologists, or
historians, etc.  Not many.  You _can_ read this stuff in a textbook, but
it\'s not the same, IMO.

I hear what you\'re saying, but I don\'t see how they prove that EDU is not
absolute.

I really like this idea.  For food, entertainment, clothes, and lodging my
wife and I spend around $800.  Therefor my SS = 3.2.  Ouch.  That seems low.

>I also seem to remember a quote from sometime in the late 70\'s or

Ah, ok, if this is true, my SS = 6.4.  I\'d say that\'s about right.  

In my game, 1Cr ~= $1.  Therefore your cost of living per month would need
to be SOC x $500.

Let\'s see how that compares with the chart I published earlier.  The cost
of living for a knight (SS=B) is 11x500 = 5500 Cr/month.  The range that I
published earlier for \'high living\' was from 3500 to 9000 Cr/month.  That
matches well.  The lower end would be for folks who don\'t get out as much
and upper end would be just the opposite.

Thanks for the idea.  I think I\'ll use it.

Uh, this logic isn\'t very.  Logical that is.  

Question: What\'s the difference between taking skill 1 and multiplying it
by 3 and have having skill 3 and not multiplying by anything.

Answer: Nothing.  They\'re the same.

[hint: try it with a calculator.  you get the same answer.]

It is right.

sticks.  

I disagree.  I took plenty of classes that I don\'t remember squat about.
But I still have my degree, don\'t I.  So if EDU is absolute, I\'ve acquired
EDU 9 (or whatever a BS is) whether I can remember it or not.

Uh, check the rules again, friend.  It says "the graduate also add (sic) +1
to his EDU per year for the full term..."  No rolling required.

I might be willing to go along with this, Eris, but I have a few problems.
By reading just your defns, one would have to be level 4 (or at least 3)
before I\'d consider him to be useful.  Are you going to book a flight on a
starship liner if you knew the pilot was only level 2?  Not me. 

So how do we solve this?  To me, it assumes that characters should have
several (say 4 or 5) skills were they reach level 3/4.  That\'s hard to do
unless you allow the player to choose exactly which skills he recieves.
Then he could pick the same ones again and again.  But I personally *like*
the randomness element of character generation.  

So how do you run generation?  How many skills does your character have
that are at least level 3 (and how old are you)?

   Wrong.  Taxes are a form of Pestilence known to bring on Famine
(particularly in one\'s wallet).  The American Revolution was a War
fought in part over Taxes, and most countries see fit to tax you heavily
when you die (Inheritance Tax on Death).

   Does that clear it up?

I know what you mean...and I know what James means, too, and I think either
way (a multiplier or more skills) *could* work.  To make "more skills" work
you\'d have to have each skill be gained several times...this *would*
devalue any individual point.  With 3 times as many points to spread over
the limited choices in CharGen you\'d have lots of skills up in the 6-9
range...just like using a multiple. Maybe!

Well, I favor using an average multiplier of around 2, instead of your 3,
(actually 10.5/2), *and* having 50% more skills.  How do you like that!

I use 4/4 in my homebrew:  

 PHYSICAL: 

    STRENGTH  (lifting, hitting, power)

    CONSTITUTION (endurance, areobic conditioning, recovery)

    AGLILITY (balance, speed, sure-footedness)

    DEXTERITY (hand-eye cooridnation, fine-muscle control)
    
 MENTAL:
 
    INTELLEGENCE (learning/using skills and knowledges from

    EDUCATION (learning/using skills and knowledges academicly, from
               books..or their equivilent, scholarship..I often call
               it SCH for scholarship)
    
    CHARISMA (social skills, leadership, empathy)
    
    WILL (stubborness, stick-to-it-ness, willpower, mental toughness)
    
PSI would be the ninth, but I don\'t normally include it in my games.
 
Social Class, is generated seperately.  It has it\'s place in CharGen and
game play, but never as an Attribute in a Task attempt.

I pretty much settled on this set *years* ago, and except for trying to
actually use a new system I always end up going back to them.

Laser blast? It didn\'t even stand up to rocks slung by 1m tall ewoks, rocks
with an impact velocity (judging by their steeply parabolic trajectory) of
about walking speed. You may be interested to know that an "elite"
stormtrooper in the Star Wars RPG rolls 2 dice for attributes and wears
armor which stops 1 die from energy weapons. For comparison, a starting
player character can roll 3 dice for attributes, and a blaster pistol does
4 dice damage. A troop of girl guides could romp on these guys.

I disagree with these characterizations. My understanding was that all
attributes were natural, untrained ability, not the amount of training you
have (that\'s what skills are). Therefore, the Education attribute is one\'s
natural, untrained ability to learn. This is not the same as intelligence;
someone with a learning disability could still be very intelligent, someone
with low intelligence but high education would have a knack for doing
things right even though she or he may be illiterate. Also, combining the
two would make Intelligence too powerful an attribute and unbalance the
game.

I don\'t think the stat is poorly conceived, unless you think it means how
much training or \'schooling\' you have had. Perhaps it is only poorly named.
True, the rules do define education as "amount of schooling", but I
considered this an effect rather than a cause. College increases one\'s
Education not by requiring you to memorize stuff, but by exposing you to an
environment which allows those with a natural love of learning to encounter
knowledge and experiences which would be very difficult to find anywhere
else. People without such a love of learning will only learn \'skills\'. This
explains why an 18-year old can roll an \'education\' of 12, and why someone
can go through 6 years of college and graduate school without increasing
their \'education\' at all. I also think it is plausible that the same
Education attribute gets added to both History and Robotics tasks; no, you
don\'t learn about robotics in history class, but someone with a natural
love of learning will get more out of their history or robotics class than
those who only care \'will this be on the exam?\'.

I don\'t agree that the Edu attribute is broken. However, the rules do have
a few problems; getting +1 Edu practically every 2 years of graduate school
is unreasonable and unbalances the game. I suggest reducing the target
number for honors to 5-. The task system published in the rules overvalues
attributes to such an extent skills are practically worthless. I suggest
using one of Kenneth Bearden\'s (sp?) task systems. I don\'t suggest
abolishing the Education attribute.

   One of the many off color jokes told by Terran Republic Marines is,
"so, do you want to see my cutlass?"  at which point he pulls it out of
his pants.  The full humor of this joke is lost when it is told by a
female Marine, for obvious reasons, though they have been known to
resort to creative props from time to time.  One of the creative props
used is a 5.3mm gauss pistol, which isn\'t funny, though it doesn\'t get
the point across.

   In the Terran Republic setting, Marines are not ship\'s troops, that
duty goes to a new branch of the Navy called Naval Security.  Both the
Marines and Naval Security forces fight in close quarters however, so
they have need of close quarters weapons.

   Marines and Naval Security troops are issued three types of weapons,
though they have been known to carry more on their own initative
(various martial arts weapons, piano wire, longer edged weapons, etc.). 

   Their primary armament is a firearm.  This consists of a gauss
carbine, gauss submachine gun, automatic shotgun, or in particularly
tight quarters, a gauss pistol.  Plasma rifles are rarely issued, except
in cases where enemy troops in battledress are expected.  

   The secondary armament is a grenade.  The type(s) of grenade issued
depend upon the mission.  Standard urban combat operations call for the
use of HE grenades to clear rooms, blow open locked doors, etc. 
"Flash-Bang" grenades, sonic grenades, and tranq grenades are used on
capture missions or for anti-terrorism operations where hostages are
involved.

   The final armament type is an edged weapon for hand-to-hand
fighting.  The edged weapon of choice is the dagger, though some troops
have been known to carry bayonets which can double both as a dagger or
as the "pointy end" when mounted on a gauss carbine, turning it into a
thrusting weapon.  

- ----

   Swords are simply not commonly carried because their bulk would be a
hinderance in tight quarters and because of what\'s known as "Indiana
Jones syndrome" (the scene in the first of the triology where Indy is
confronted by a sword welding bad guy).  Fighting with swords is nice
until you come up against an enemy that has no problem pulling out a
pistol and shooting you before you get into range of your bladed
weapon.  Pistols become the close in fighting weapon of choice probably
about the time of the Thirty Years War, even though long bladed weapons
continued to be carried for sometime.  Initially, this is because you
have to have *something* to kill the enemy with after you shoot off the
half dozen single shot pistols you are carrying (battlefield reloading
of early musket pistols during a melee is not advisable).  This would
also apply on board a wooden ship.  Boarding parties used their pistols
(unless they were trying to silently interdict the crew), then their
knives and swords, and then if necessary whatever else might be at hand
including improvised clubs, even fists, and teeth.

   Long-edged weapons look great on a TV or movie screen (ask the
Klingons) but they have little practical value in the Age of Smith &
Wesson, Ruger, H&K, Glock, etc.  Now if you want to give your soldiers
the ability to deflect bullets or energy rounds with their long edged
weapons (a la a Star Wars light saber) then you might want to bring such
weapons back.

Harold

    This just gave me a thought.  The First Imperium expected to be around for
a long time, and was actually.  The Third Imperium expected to be around for a
long time too, and 1,100+ years is a pretty long run too.  What I\'m thinking
here is that this plenty long enough of a time for terraformation projects to
get started, and finished, on a slew of marginal planets.  Not to mention
ecological transformation or engineering projects.
    So what exactly is going to be involved in doing this?  We\'ve got all these
hard science types on the list so...

    What worlds would be candidates for terraformation?

    What would be required to terraform such worlds?

    What techiques and technologies would be developed/used?

    What time frame are we talking about?

    What kind of costs?

    So, what questions have I missed?  An important point here to consider, the
limitations of jump drive.  You can export only so many people so far to your
frontier, it takes a long time to move any serious distance in Traveller.
Therefore the ability to create internal frontiers by taking otherwise useless
rocks and turning them into habitable worlds... would be a very useful thing
indeed.

    Thoughts?  Comments??  Flames???

	You think that\'s low?  By that standard, i.e. disposable income for
luxuries and entertainment, I\'ve got a SOC of maybe 0.2 :).

	Actually, I think that the number of credits of disposable
income/month per level of SOC ought to be exponential; Cleon, with his SOC

of some SOC-1 plebe...

	Hmm... interesting.  I really do think that StoryTeller does a
better job of mapping human traits onto the character sheet, so to speak.
It does the traditional Strength, Dexterity, and Stamina thing for physical
stats, has Appearance, Manipulation, and Charisma for social stats, and
mental stats are dealt with above.  I like the social stats; visualise a
sleazy noble using Manipulation + leadership to get his troops to charge,
whereas a more heroic one would use Charisma...

	As far as the rest of the system goes, well, it has its pros and
cons.  I\'m of the opinion that the task system is superior to T4\'s and very
flexible; you roll (stat+skill)d10\'s against a difficulty number set by
either rules (such as 8 [+/- various modifiers] to hit with a .45) or ref
fiat (horking a lugie into a spittoon 40\' away while conducting a symphony
and coding a virus in C++ on a laptop with your toes should be good for a
10).  The more d10s you roll equal to or higher than the difficulty number,
the more "successes" you get the better you do (I would require at least 15
successes on an extended series of rolls on the horking/conducting/coding
stunt).  10s may be re-rolled to add successes, and 1\'s cancel successes;
more 1\'s than successes get you a spectacular failure of magnitude
determined by the number of 1\'s you rolled...

	And that\'s basically the task system.  Combat rules are badly
broken but fixable.

	I like your PER stat.  It could be applied in the following
fashion: each level of PER gets you an hour\'s effective attention span
before DM\'s start piling on; thus, someone with a PER of 9 under normal
circumstances is good for 9 hours work on a task before he/she starts to
get fuzzy and lose their edge.

	Actually, I just got this idea for a 12-stat UPP: STR, DEX, AGL,
END for physical stats, APP, MAN, CHA, SOC for social stats, and INT,
PERCEP, WIT, PERSEV for mental...  I think that it really makes sense and
covers all the bases.  Of course, you\'d have to tweak the damage rules a
bit, but I think that it\'s doable.

  True, and not. The "recoil" that a shooter feels is lessened from the

Just a few thoughts:

Shields: The traditional shield fell out of use because melee ceased to
be a major factor in warfare, if your not in close combat why carry one?
against missile weapons sheilds always were of limited use because one
just couldn\'t get it in the way in time. Also the shield is a weapon
which requires a good deal of skill to use. Shields held on in the form
of the targe or buckler until the 18th century (Spanish sword and buckler
men were a major factor in the defeat of the swiss pike blocks).

Modern riot shields are intended against low velocity missiles (rocks and
bottles) that you can see coming, not bullets which you can\'t; and they
also rely on closely packed formations to be effective. Notice how many
riot police drop their shields when moving into melee.

Swords: Why do the marines receive training in cutlass? I can give a number
of good reasons.
1  Tradition: it builds espirt du corp
2  Safety: the cutlass is part of the dress uniform and it looks bad if a
   marine cuts their fingers off when drawing one to return a salute
3  Fitness: swinging a cutlass is great for improving dexterity, stamina
   and building upper body strength (HMS Temeraire, the RN physical fitness
   school uses cutlass drill for exactly this purpose)
4  Ceremony: cutlass drill is intergral to various marine ceremony, thus all
   marine recruits are taught certain basic moves such as present arms, how
   to salute with one etc.
5  Recruiting: marine display units regularly appear at local pagents and
   other events giving stunning displays of precision cutlass drill,
   essentially for recruiting purposes.
6  Combat use: there will be rare occassions when marines will be in melee
   combat, the cutlass is a good melee weapon and a modern combat rifle
   is a precision intrument and suffers accordingly if you hit someone over
   the head with it! Also note that a modern bullpup rifle doesn\'t make a
   good bayonet platform (they\'re short and teribly unbalanced).

Which is better, the broadsword or rapier? Depends on the level of training
the weilder has. A rapier, with its advantages of speed and manueverability
probably has the edge over the heavy slashing broadsword; but it does require
the user to be very well trained to take advantage of this. The training
costs are what make the rapier the less attractive weapon. A poorly trained
swordsman with a rapier will be defeated by a swordsman with the same degree
of training with a broadsword; however in the hands of an expert its a very
different story.

I am in complete agreement with Eris\' skill definitions.  In fact, 
because of the multiplier, KBv2.0 (and for that matter, KBv1.1) works 
best when skills don\'t reach too much over level 8.

The system is really not designed with higher skill levels in mind.

Actually, it goes...

Physical: Strength, Dexterity, Stamina
Mental: Perception, Intelligence, Wits
Social: Charisma, Manipulation*, Appearance

* ie: cunning or "social stealth" (muah-ah-ah-ahh!)

The system works great, just like Rod explained (adding a skill\'s
level with what ever stat most closely represents the way the skill is
being used).  One problem, however... stats and skills only range from
1 to 5 in WhiteWolf\'s Storyteller system (ie: not a lot of room to
differentiate between characters).

Gotcha.  I would agrue agains redefining the skill levels, then.  
They\'ve been the same value in CT and MT through to T4.  Why change 
that?

CharGen is easier fixed to not provide so many skills for a 
character.  For one quick thought, simply apply a roll for skill each 
year.  Copy the rolls in the CT/MT 1 year method CharGen systems.  
This will provide a good character with a lot of skills--but not too 
many that are too high.

Another good point.

The way it is handled in T4, with half attribute, is how I was 
planning to handle it.  Of course, this is much more stringent than 
the T4 system because of the change in difficulty codes, but I don\'t 
see that as a negative.  It should be hard to accomplish a task that 
you need a skill for but don\'t have.

Some GMs may want a less stringent system for unskilled throws.  I\'d 
suggest just using the attribute as is without halving it.  I didn\'t 
run numbers, but I\'d guess that this would turn out about the same as 
the T4 system is now.

True.  Maybe the whole attribute would be best.  To be honest, I\'ve 
been focussing on KBv2.0.  I haven\'t even figured out the best way to 
roll SS and SF yet.  This is another issue that needs to be tackled 
after I\'m convinced that KBv2.0 is a good system.

So far, so good.  Nobody\'s pointed out any major bugs.  I think the 
system is going to run nicely.  I plan on posting some numbers soon 
for the TML to analyze.  If anybody can tear apart or approve a 
system, it\'s the TML.

Perhaps I should have used the words "limited to a maximum of 15".
That would probably explain my point a little better.  Oops :)

According to Traveller\'s own definition, the more knowledge we
consume, the higher our education level will become (whether or not it
takes place in a school shouldn\'t matter) .  With Anagathics or other
longevity drugs, it should be easily possible to exceed a maximum EDU
rating of 15 during his or her lifetime, based on Traveller\'s own,
albeit vague, definition.

I was talking in game terms :)  A Traveller character with a piece of
paper and no measurable skills would be simply that... a Traveller
character with a piece of paper and no measurable skills :)

They actually might have some skills that could be put on a character
sheet, however, including Forgery (note from Mommy), Bribery (how much
for an A?), Computer (simply "click-click-click" change this D- to a
B+), Intrusion (I think I can fit Cocraine\'s theory of warp drive
under my left armpit), etc.

many
> skills you have.

You\'ve lost me.  I\'ve been to school were I learned skills.  Each year
I progressed, I learned more skills (of course, it was a technical
institute, but that shouldn\'t make any difference).

Perhaps part of the problem defining Education might stem from the
fact that we normally associate "Knowledge" as academic knowledge with
little use for "hands-on" experience (ie: Law, History, Meteorology,
etc.).  We don\'t attend law school to acquire the _skill_ of Law,
although we describe a talented lawyer as a "skillful" individual.

"Skills", on the other hand, are easier to define as abilities we
learn which require us to use that skill in a physical manner (ie:
driving, climbing, swimming).  We don\'t take lessons to gain the
_knowledge_ of swimming, although we can say later that we "know" how
to swim.

Unfortunately, Traveller defines both skills & knowledge as
one-in-the-same and puts them all on the Skills Cluster List.

Look at it this way. Billies (and swords/knives) are *quiet*. That
makes a difference. And in close quarters you are a lot less likely to
nail the wrong person.

South American soccer games have started *wars* (Between Uruguay and
Paraguay, as I recall). And there have been referees who bought surplus
military vehicles and parked them on the sidelines as a sort of
"moveable bunker" to wait out ugly crowds. In one case, the vehicle was
a *tank*. Crowd gets upset at call, ref dives in and closes the hatch.
If they calm down he comes out, if they don\'t, he drives home...

Americans don\'t realize just *how* seriously the rest of the world
views soccer.

The "shelter" costs are the kicker. $120/month is a bit more than a
single person gets as max benefit on foodstamps. So that\'s considered
to be "reasonable" food. 

Now take a look around and see what kind of lodging you get for 180 a
month *unsubsidized*. I know people who are only paying 180/month for
rent. But the *rest* of the rent is coming from one or more rent
assistance programs. 

As a yardstick, remember the handy rule of thumb: To compare a "daily"
rental with a "monthly", multiply the daily by 10. (This is a real
guideline, the difference has to do with the higher overhead and risk
of short term rentals)

So 180/month is equvialent to 18/day. Not exactly decent housing...

That\'s "subsistence" living. High living is equally bollixed. 600/month
for food is 20/day. Sorry, but a single meal at a *good" restaurant can
run that much, if not more.

And the accomodations prices are even more out of line. 300/month
equals 30/day. That\'s a pretty *cheap* hotel room. 

The hotel comparison is useful since more of us have experience with
"fancy" hotel rooms than with fancy apartments.

But since the BD in my campaign has "jump jets", it\'s going to be damn hard

This reminds me of an Army reserve briefing I heard about (obviously from a
friend in the army reserve).
An army medic was telling the new recruits what to expect if they were hit
by a 7.62mm round.

He started by poining to his lower arm.
"If you get hit here, you\'ll lose this much of you arm, but you will live!"
At this point he indicates from the elbow down.
He then points at the upper arm.
"If you get hit here, you\'ll lose this much, but you will live, maybe!"
Indicating from the shoulder down.
He then points to the chest.
"If you get hit here, we can\'t help you, your dead!"

Now.. I am not saying this is true, but I am having trouble believing in
this "blow through" rule, if the round has enough energy and mass, and hits
in the right place, I can see that it would easily powderise bone and sever
limbs.
This rule just seems to be a convenient way of reducing the deadliness of
combat.
I don\'t thimk this should be done, if the players want to risk combat, thay
should face ALL of the risks, including a very quick and ignominious (does
that word exist?) death.

Yes and no.  My friend, who was in the Corps after your time, discovered on a
trip to Somalia (I think) that there\'s a quaint custom called "Piracy Watch."
You stand out on the deck in a vest and helmet, carrying a shotgun, and make
sure the local "pirates" don\'t board and try to steal crates off your ship.  He
actually came under fire while doing this -- someone ashore was working a
machine gun -- but the ship didn\'t shoot back.  (He kept waiting for the light
to go on...)  Apparently it happens all the time wherever this was, and
apparently these loons have actually boarded USN ships and stolen stuff, too.

I\'m not sure where this happened.

	Yeah... that\'s one thing that I dislike about it; low resolution.
This is one area where Trav does it better.  At one point I was bashing
around the idea of an alternate version where stats are on a 1-10 scale and
you just roll d20\'s instead of d10\'s.

	OTOH, given the frequent use of resisted rolls, i.e. characters
rolling their (stat+skill) die pools against one another, the lack of
resolution might actually speed things up a little by eliminating
rollathons.

The best worlds would be thin atmosphere or Ice ball worlds with 1G. As we
have learned here on Terra, it\'s a lot easier to add to the gases to the
atmosphere than to remove them. Though we seem to be really good at
destroying ozone.

>    What would be required to terraform such worlds?
Time and cheap space flight, orbital labs and reliable robots. Orbital
construction and engineering.

>    What techiques and technologies would be developed/used?
- -Giant space mirrors to focus sunlight to melt polar ice caps. This is easy,
you could build them with Bubble gum and Aqua-net.
- -Ice mining ships to transport huge iceburgs from other planets rings and
drop them on the planet to be terraformed. These could be fairly small but
would need a massive manuver drive. If the iceburg is large enough, it will
collapse from its own weight. Smaller ones would need some help from the
mirrors.
- -Genetically engineered biota. Something like lichen to convert CO2 to
oxygen. Of course, on an airless world, you would have to wait until there
was some sort of atmosphere to convert. If the world has no CO2, then perhaps
a slime mold or paramecium type of bacteria could do the job, but its going
to take a lot of them.
Order of business could be something like-
1.Find world not to far from primary, with thin CO2 atmosphere and ice caps.
2.Build solar mirrors and begin to melt ice caps.
3.Send ships to a nearby ringed planet and move iceburgs to impact orbits.
4.Wait for dust to settle.
5.Continue to wait for dust to settle.
6.Remember what happened to the dinosaurs?
7.Dust settles (hooray)
8.Depending on what is in the air,besides dust, drop the biota. There may be
some standing water, if the iceburg was large enough, but more likely there
will be pockets of atmosphere in low lying areas. 
9.Send down the robots to monitor the biota and replace or reengineer the
ones that aren\'t working.
10.Wait until there\'s an atmosphere.
11.Move in.

This is a basic scenario. There may be a layer of permafrost or trapped water
beneath the crust that blows out when it gets warm enough. Or perhaps this
layer could be mined. Remember, this is a planet, and anything can and will
go wrong.

What is the future of Traveller?  A good rulebook is essential for 
the spread of the game.  I have notice a dramatic increased in the 
quality of recent products.  However, without a quality basic 
rulebook the future for T4 is limited.

My recommendation is fix the things that need to be fixed in the 
rules (this mailing list has talked long and hard about them) and 
print them in the Deluxe Hardback, but then print the Deluxe in 
softcover as the new basic rulebook for the masses (positive 
thinking).  If IG doesn\'t want to call it Deluxe version call it

James, it looks like you\'re arguing both sides.  ;-> 

First you say, you "don\'t remember squat", but then "I\'ve acquired EDU 9." 
Well, the way T4 is currently set up, your EDU 9 adds to your skill in,
biology , geology, physics, astronomy, history, socialogy, etc, etc,
etc...about which you say you remember squat. Your Target Number is at
least 9 in all these fields!  Boo! Hiss!

Your degree doesn\'t mean you *know* anything except how to get a degree. 
You *should* have acquired some skills and knowledges, and we assume you
did when we see your degree, but it doesn\'t prove you actually did.  There
really are many uncredentialed people with as much (if not more)
skill/knowledge as the credentialed.  

As I see it, if EDU measures anything it must be the ability to do the
things that get you those credentials.  Charitabily, I say that means you
have an increasing capacity to learn and use those skills/knowledges that
have a scholarly basis.

I won\'t have EDU be a measure of "years of school" in one of my games,
period.  What I *might* do is pull it out of the Attribute pool, make it a
secondary characteristic that measures the number of background skills a PC
begins with.

Also pistols for Quarterdeck watches, but the rest primarily carry
shotguns.  In fact you can substitute a shotgun for the pistol as far as
the Quarterdeck watch is concerned.

A word of warning, during a security alert if you hear someone yell get out
of the way, hug the bulkhead.  They are authorized to knock you down with
the butt of the gun, meaning you wake up in sickbay, in trouble for not
getting out of the way (thankfully this never happened to me, but they
about ran me over a time or two).

[James, the level descriptions I posted are for standard T4 type PC\'s.  In
my games you\'d have to double (roughly) each level to make it fit the
description.]

T4 Level 3\'s are the mainstay of society.  Level 2\'s are competent for the
easy and average task, but not who you want for the hard ones.  You\'d want
a 4 for *your* doctor, and a 5 for *your* surgery, I suspect.  ;->

Me neither!  She might be Level 3 (although 4 is more likely), and there
are probably 2\'s in the crew that are developing their skills toward 3. 
These are the folks that "sit the chair" during routine flight, and "sit
second" during lifts, landings, and jumps.

> several (say 4 or 5) skills were they reach level 3/4. 

Just checked 9 characters currently in my PBEM\'s for level 3/4\'s...I had to
do some figuring to bring them down to T4 levels, but one would have 6
(oldest), one had 1 (youngest), the rest had 3 or 4. The character I\'m
playing in Paul Walker\'s game has 2 (Pilot 6 and Astrogation 4).  The way I
run things my player\'s skill points are actually in the range of 6 to 12
for things at which they are competent.

I like random selection too, but only for *some* of the skills..some are
required and some are automatic, depending on what career the PC is
pursuing.

I give more Background Skills than T4 allows.  I don\'t raise EDU in the
Academies/Colleges/Schools, instead the characters get more skills, and
they can select some of those. Nobody takes courses completely at random
while in school...well, almost nobody!  <g>

During the 1st term of a career the PC earns *6* skill increases, but 4 or
5 of them are predetermined for the particular career, the other 1 or 2 are
random.  During the 2nd term there is another suite of 6 skills, usually 3
required skills, rest random.  My reasoning, is that their employer
(service) will require them to learn certain things..consider it basic
training and service schools.  The PC might not be very *good* at all the
"service/career" skills, but they will have had basic training in them.

Third term and on, the number of skills drops to the standard 1/year with
more random selection.  They also get promotion skills, chances at
specialty schools missions, and crosstraining, and random "pick a skill"
chances.  (I\'m still *creating* all this, and it\'s becoming much more like
CT Advanced CharGen only with many more skills. <g>)

See, I already subscribe to your "more skills" theory.  Probably about 1/3
more skill gains for the average PC than in T4 at
Mustering out ages.

Also remember, I\'m also using my Aptitude method where you go up in skill
points by from .6 to 3.6 per increase.  You have to because the Target
Numbers are much higher than standard T4 (I\'m already using 1/2/3/4/5/6/7d6
difficulty levels).  PC\'s become competent at TN\'s of 13 or so, and with an
average Attribute of 8 (roll 3 keep 2) that means they need 5 or 6 skill
points.

Actually, T4 says (pg 19, col 2, 2nd para) that "...The graduate also add +1
to his EDU per year for the full term, and ages by the same amount of years.
For example, a college graduate adds +4 to his EDU and ages 4 years..."

No rolls for this.  Getting Honors (and an additional +1 EDU) does require a
roll and getting through college requires rolls, but if one graduates, one
gets the +4 to one\'s EDU... I agree, though, that EDU should only reflect
education that "stuck"...

The group\'s been wrestling with the critical success/failure issue as well.
We\'re trying the following:  Using the Auto/2D ... 7D from KBv2.0, the task
fails spectacularly if the number of 6s equals or exceeds the character\'s
skill level.  This allows a higher skill level to decrease the likelihood of
a spectacular failure - which is counterbalanced by the increasing numbers
of dice thrown in attempting more difficult tasks.

We\'re still using the stock "minimum possible score with the dice thrown"
rule for spectacular success - it makes such success harder at higher levels
without ever making it impossible.  A character who wants to finesse an easy
task (vs. doing it on autopilot and not rolling) may elect to roll the 2D6
for it to see whether he/she spectacularly succeeds - incurring the chance
to spectacularly fail, too!

Any suggestions on tying skill level to spectacular success?

Didn\'t the bad guys in Outland use shotguns? I seem to recall that one of
\'em got blown through the side of a greenhouse... Anyway, when I saw the
movie, I thought a shotgun\'d be an ideal weapon for just these reasons - v.
good against soft, squishy targets and *safe* against ship structures!

One of my players raised the same point.  John Average has STR, END, and DEX
= 7.  I shoot him from 10 feet away with my cP003.  John may be hurt, but,
without using a called shot or acheiving a spectacular success, there seems
to be no way for me to simply kill, or even knock him out, with a single
bullet.  Assuming all sixes for damage and assuming only 3D are absorbed by
his body (he\'s naked, you know...), END, STR, and DEX will each only be
driven down to 1...  If not shot again, and quickly, he\'ll feebly stagger
away from the fight to bandaid himself; he\'ll be rarin\' to go again the next
day!  Because spectacular success often implies the target\'s head is blown
off, does the chance for that success reflect adequately the likelihood of a
quick-kill? Even a called shot at DM-5 only makes the kill more likely - not
at all certain...

I\'ve wondered abit as well about ammo types, including armor-piercing ammo,
hollow-point bullets, etc., and their relationship to how much damage a
target can absorb.  Comments?

Tx!

	During Vietnam, in the Philippines such "piracy" was a problem.
The tactic was to have a few men with clubs standing at watch.  Also, they
had a large fire-hose available for when a wave of looters would hit the
ship <g>.  hard to reflect that in Traveller... :)

As I understand it, what is called "T4 Deluxe" will become the standard 
rulebook for T4.  Those of us who place an advanced order through the 
internet will get it first.  It will be signed and numbered, and the 
print run will just be enough to fill the advanced orders.

Then, at some future time, they\'ll make another print run (also 
hardbound, but not signed and numbered) and sell them through the 
standard channels.

It\'ll be the same book.  The difference is that those who pre-order get a 
signed and numbered edition, and get them some time before others will.

So, by the end of this year (dunno when exactly, just saying that as a 
conservative estimate) the "standard" T4 rule book will be what we\'re 
calling "T4 Deluxe".  

As for what the difference between what we already have and "T4 Deluxe" 
will be, I don\'t know.  Only Marc knows.  From what we\'ve seen, he\'s 
apparently revising the task system.  Ummm...any other hints anyone has 
noticed?

Maybe Marc will let us know what he has been doing, sometime soon. :)

Absolutely.  The main rulebook is the foundation.  The present T4 
rulebook has some cracks.  "T4 Deluxe" will provide a much better 
foundation, since as someone else said, it will truly be "Marc Miller\'s 
Traveller."

Seems like that\'s what they\'re doing.  Except for the part about printing 
it in softbound.  They want the main book - and certain other key books 
along the way, like the Aliens Hardbound volumes - to be done in 
hardbound only.

And when the point-defence laser mounted on my BD stops your grenade(s)
after 2 meters of flight, and my point-defence radar immediately give me a
visable flight path back to the launch point, information that the other
three members of my fire team have instant access to, what are you going to
do then?

Also, I\'ve got a sensor suite that will detect your goon either by IR or
contour mapping.. I may fire first with a hand-held gauss machine gun or
plasma weapon!  Not to mention that since I\'m already in a sealed
enviroment, I have no problem with punching holes in the hull.

In reality, the path a bullet takes throught the body determines how badly
the target is hurt.  A difference in entry a little as 5mm can mean the
difference between sudden death and a "flesh wound" causing lttle more than
pain and inconvience.

Out in the real world, people have taken .45 pistol rounds to the head, at
point-blank range, and walked away.  On the other hand, a LAPD officer once
took a .22 pistol round in the foot, and died of shock within 10 minutes.
Weird things happen when you start throwing bits of lead into human (or
other) bodies.

My fix is that ANY to hit roll that suceeds by 5 is automatically a 2x
damage hit, any that makes it by 9 is automatically a 3x damge.  This
simulates the random chance of putting a round into a vital organ.

Traveller does not have a gritty, realistic combat system.  I prefer it this
way.  For Traveller, I want something that is accurate, yet allows the
characters to stand a good chance of living.

Do any of your references detail moon accretion?  When I downloaded the original
Accrete to tweak it, I noticed the moon construction step was empty -- no moons
constructed.  For that manner, does anyone else out there have any references
they can point me to that detail accretion (including moons) so I can rewrite
my version of the software?

My copy of the program has the same problem/feature as the original.  It likes
to build extremely high-pressure worlds.  The only UWP atm code I found to fit
those excessively high pressure was E (from MT\'s World Builder\'s book).  The
common A hydrographics is also caused by my computation method for the hyd code:
I\'m counting ice as part of the hydrograhpics (should I/shouldn\'t I?).

The rewrite I\'ve done to it allow you to include mass/luminosity of the primary
and UWP of the main world (so you can build systems that have a habitable
main world).  I\'m going to look at the program again and tweak some things on
it this weekend and upload it onto my web page this week.

Ah, yes.  Bayonet training.  I was in the infantry, and well remember the
bayonet.  All two days of it.  After running the bayonet course at Ft.
Benning, I was never even issued one again for field problems in my regular
units.  I would doubt that I even have Spear-0.  The whole point of the
training was to instill a killer instinct in us, and to give the Drill
Sergeants a good laugh during pugil stick competition as we beat each other
into camoflagued pulp.

>Is the blade now -- and will it be in the future -- the best tradition to

>objectives?  Maybe, or maybe not. 

For the Imperial Marines, I think this function would be replaced by jump
training.  In today\'s US Army, airborne training is seen as more of a morale
booster than a serious military activity (unless you plan on going Ranger or
Special forces.)  For the IM, being jump trained is the mark of distiction
over the "mud-huggers" of the various planetary armies.  Imagine the pride
and elation felt by the Marine trainee after her first sucessful jump,
knowing that she has done something that most people will never do, and many
people couldn\'t.  That\'s where the Marine pride and esprit d\'corps is going
to come from.  IMNSHO.

The Marine Cutlass might be taken up asa hobby, by some, but outside
ceremonial use, I see no realistic place for it in a TL12 military force.

(Side note and plug:  If you want to see military discipline at it\'s best,
and you\'re ever in Washington D.C., go see the USMC Silent Drill Team.
These guys are unreal.)

Again, I think that (aside from the fact that surgery isn\'t additive
on medicine, it\'s really different in a lot of ways) the trick is to
write the tasks themselves better.  Base the Difficulty Levels of
your skills on the task at hand, and use some minimum skill as a
baseline.  Then up the diff-level for folks with lower skills, not
just adjust the target number.
 
This is the key, IMO.  If a task is rated as Easy for some reason,
apparently it is Easy for all people with any skill at all, all that
differs is the target number.  Bzzzzt.  Wrong answer.  If it\'s Easy
for the Skill 4 guy that Task, not just the target number should
chnage.  So the skill 1 guy doesn\'t face an Easy task, he faces a
Formidable Task.

In reality, the Navy held the upper hand for many reasons.  They knew
the ship and could flank the Marines (a large ship is a maze).  The
clubs were preferred(not hitting friendly troops, etc...) but I think
that the best reason was that the Navy could beat up on the Marines;-).
If we had been using real bullets, they probably would have gone with
shotguns & pistols.

I suspect Vilani heraldry had its origins the same place Solomani heraldry
did - low TL battlefield identification.  Painting a pretty picture on a
shield works well so I suspect the Vilani will have thought of it as well.

That said, they probably have a completely different set of rules regarding
what is acceptable on a coat and what isn\'t.

I am not a doctor, but I have been around combat more then once.  I do
not buy the blow through rule and don=92t use it.  Here=92s why:=20
1)  Most bullets will start to tumble after impact, unless they go
through something with low mass. This creates more damage.
2)  IF the bullet hits a bone, it has a very good chance to ricochet and
do more damage.  I saw a guy get hit in the left thigh and have the
bullet come out his right shoulder.  Very messy.
3)  Most people just drop when they get hit.  I mean drop.  Not looking
around, not reaching for the chest, etc.  After they figure out what
happens, if they are still alive, then they start to do the dance.=20
4)  A very few will get hit in a non-vital area and not realize it for
awhile.  But that is the exception, and tends to happen with more
civilian type weapons. =20
5)  My combat system uses a combination of weapon damage dice and hit
location damage to figure out what happens.  You can get hit in the
chest with a .22 and not realize it, or you could get a critical wound.
Very random. Just like real life.

I have had to come up with hit location charts and damage for some other
races. But most of the time my standard seems to work fine.

Buy the way, why was anyone hunting rabbits with 7.62???!!! I don=92t hun=
t
any more, but when I did I used a .22.  The kinder and gentler way to
kill:-).

I could just see the to hit location chart now:
1- critical
2- critical
3- critical
etc...=20

Well once you go active, your location would triangulated by passive
sensors, the  disposable remote controlled MRL would lay down a barrage of
multiple warheads, using variable fight surfaces, that overwhelm your PD
laser, and at least give a HE/HEAT headache. By the by, your PD would have
to be active to get a counter battery location, being active constantly
means constantly dead.

Well using Black Hole and ECM will reduce your resolution of my possible
position by several factors. My "Horned Toad" heavy grav tank is not
impressed by your gauss popgun or your plasma weapon paint remover. But
then you bring out .......

Sure Joe,=20
I don=92t mind. While I was in the Navy (Fighter Weapons Systems, flight
deck troubleshooting, FATC, etc..) I was able to work closely with the
Marines.  (Beirut, Grenada, etc=85)   Impressive, thinks I. Let me look
into the possibilities of joining.  I found out that the Marines are the
only branch that makes EVERYONE go to boot camp.  Most of the branches
will allow some cross over with little difficulty. Some will allow you
to keep your rank, or you may have to take a one step reduction.  The
higher up you go, the more difficult it is.  However, because I had some
skills (can=92t say what ;-)) that the Marines were looking for, The
Commandant Himself (everyone stand up and sing the Marine Hymn) handed
me the waver.  He only took away two of my stripes and made me go to
infantry school and NCO school!

I was told that I was the only active duty Marine that had not gone to
boot camp. Some Marines did not like that very much at the time, but I
feel that I proved to be a outstanding Marine. (Graduated first in both
schools, went to war, etc=85)=20

If you have any more questions, fire=85 err, no=85 ask away.=20

 Your ratio is bad.  For most places that I\'m aware of, a better
 ratio would be Cr1 = US$2; where the cost of living is high,
 use Cr1 = US$2.50 to US$3; where unusually low, use Cr1=US$1.50
 or Cr1=UK�1.

 No, they look pretty good to me - if you assume that your ratio
 is off.  I\'m also assuming that these aren\'t the "toy" versions
 - i.e., the sleeping bag is durable material, down-filled,
 thermal-lined, suitable for anything from Baffin Island to the
 Sahara; the backpack is tough canvas, not urban-bookbag-easy-rip
 nylon; the desert clothing is rugged and includes good boots,
 possibly steel-toe; and so on. I could see a lot of this stuff
 going higher, even with the higher ratio I gave above.

 I think that that\'s a little high - I don\'t think I could eat
 three meals a day that each cost $45.  The most expensive
 breakfast, for example, that I\'ve seen was a prix-fixe brunch
 buffet for only about $25-30 per person.  And that was a _lot_
 of food.  I\'m in greater NYC.  Lunch will probably top out at
 the $45/person figure, for a "power lunch" with a business
 associate or a client.  Dinner could go higher, but except at
 the snob-appeal places, probably won\'t go much above $55/person.

 I\'m pretty much at the subsistence level (mostly out of
 choice, rather than necessity), but I rarely cook for myself -
 if I did so more often (like "normal" frequency), I could
 _easily_ cut my food expenses in half.  And I\'d be eating
 better, too. I\'m just lazy.  A family of four, at ordinary
 level, could spend 800/month on food, including dining out
 (diner, or Giuseppe\'s, not Lutece or "21") once or twice per
 week.  Again, NYC area figures.

	Here is two "Corsair" ships. The first one is based on the
	Corsair found in "MegaTraveller Imperial Encyclopedia", and the
	second one is TL-12 version of the Ueknou-class Vargr corsair.

Average density: 0.87 ton/m3, the ship will float on water.
Notes: Unable to land on planets with atmosphere. No MFD\'s, 6x 95 MJ

Corsair: The name "Corsair" generally refers to an armed ship, used by
pirates and privateers to raid merchant spacecraft. Most corsairs are
manufactured from a mixed collection of salvaged components, and new
spare parts are continuously being taken from destroyed ships.

Because of their mixed construction, corsairs are usually unstreamlined,
and can not operate from planets with atmosphere. Thus they may require
either support ships or bases.

A corsair ship is "Partly new, partly old, partly bought, partly
stolen".

The Vargr corsair is an armed vessel equipped with extra accommodations
for ship\'s troops. This ship is a TL-12 predecessor of the later TL-14
Ueknou-class Vargr corsair.

The 121 MJ remote laser turrets are powered to ROF 100. Lasers can be
fired as two separate MFD-controlled turrets, or as one MFD-controlled
twin battery, while the other MFD is used to control missiles

Well, this would mean that your STR shouldn\'t go up during character
creation (through, say, weight-training), since that would reflect
TRAINING in the statistic.  Instead, you should gain a \'weigh-trained\'
skill or something.

I\'ve always read it that INT reflects your ability to reason, and EDU
reflects how much you know.  I\'ve known lots of people far cleverer than I
who know less, and I\'ve known lots of people who know more than I, but who
aren\'t as clever.  <Shrug>  I\'ve also known people who know lots who have
little or no formal schooling.

Um, if you can\'t remember it, why does it do you any good?  If I have a
piece of paper from a weight training school that says I can lift 400 lbs,
it doesn\'t mean I have a STR of B.  Only if I actually CAN lift 400 lbs
would it count.

Likewise, having gone through school and gotten a degree only gives you
pts. of EDU if you remember the information that you were taught.

The description of EDU as "Amount of schooling" is a holdover from Classic
Traveller, where the stats weren\'t being used actively as part of the
skill system.

MegaTraveller, like T4, uses EDU to resolve skill rolls.  It says,
"Education indicates level of accumulated knowledge gained in formal and
informal settings."  Much clearer, IMHO.

My point is this:  If you are trying to solve a tricky Physics problem
(EDU related physics use), having a piece of paper doesn\'t allow you to
solve that problem more easily.  If the skill system were based on this
idea it would be even more broken than it is :)  On the other hand, if you
have "accumulated knowledge gained in formal and informal settings", you
ought to solve the problem more easily.

It\'s as simple as that.

Well, this comes from the fact that EDU is being used to track ALL
KNOWLEDGE.  As someone else pointed out, my having a BS in physics
shouldn\'t help my Law skill roll, but under T4 it does.  EDU reflects not
only your knowledge in specific skill areas, but your overall erudition
and general knowledge.  Someone who has gone to college has (presumeably)
been exposed to a wider range of information (and information sources),
and has (presumeably) been exposed to a learning-positive environment for
several years.  The +1 EDU per year reflects that \'learning-enriched\'
environment.

IMHO, of course.

Another great 2300AD adventure is "Rotten to the Core."
Do not pass on *any* sci-fi or futuristic military RPG supplements without 
looking through them for usable material/illustrations.  Good places to 
look are discount/half-price bookstores.

So I reply:
Much of the GDW 2300AD stuff is translatable to Traveller(tm). I have used

Personally I think it\'s not necessary to halve the attribute for untrained
skill use, just using a skill of zero works fine. I think the reason the
attribute was halved in the original T4 task rules was that skills were so
insignificant that reducing the attribute was the only way to reduce a
character\'s chance of succeeding. This is not true with your task system.
Also, just using a skill of zero means there is no extra advantage in
taking lots of skills at level 1, so the minimaxers will be less likely to
do this.

comments?

Astronomy (Sciences Cluster) Edu or Int
The study of space phenomena such as stars, planets, asteroids, gas clouds,
and black holes. This skill also covers knowledge of the properties of
J-space, the alternate spacial dimension used for faster-than-light travel.
Edu is the base characteristic for analysing or predicting the behavior of
familiar space events. Int should be used when testing new theories or
unknown phenomena.

Planetology (Sciences Cluster) Edu
This skill replaces Geology in the T4 rules. It is the study of the
physical properties of planets; covering geology, hydrology, atmospherics,
tides, weather, earthquakes, mining, and magnetic fields. It does not cover
life forms or societies on planets. Edu is the base characteristic for
nearly all planetology tasks.

Xenobiology (Sciences Cluster) Edu
The study of alien (to the character) life forms. This skill can be used to
identify the probable dangers, behavior, psychology, and living
requirements of new alien species. Note that gene engineered variants or
offshoots of a species do not count as "alien". Characters attempting to
use Medical, Biology, Psychology, First Aid, or other such skills on an
alien life form use the lower of their Xenobiology and other applied skill.
An intelligent alien using such a skill on a human would also use the lower
of its Xenobiology and applied skill. Edu is the base characteristic for
nearly all Xenobiology tasks.

Assuming that this is the first hit in combat, John Average takes takes 18
points to one stat! This knocks him out. The remaining 11 points are
distributed to the other characteristics as a group of 5, and a group of 6.
So at best JA is at a UPP around 012xxx, at worst 003xxx, unconsious, and
or seriously wounded. (T4 rules p57, rh column, para 4)

Alternatively, a normal hit will dish out 3.5, 3.5, 3.5 points distributed
by the wounded PC\'s player. Now, this is surviveable. But to have this
distribution, the player has to have survived a hit already. If this is the
case, they are still likely to be KO\'d. Else, a first hit will dish out
10.5 points to Mr JA on a single state, and it\'s UPP 047xxx, and lights out
time.

We always got local currency (in Imp Creds) by selling the cargo.

Or, in the rare occasions that a surplus was generated we would use =
bearer bonds from a major bank and deposit them into a local banks and =

In fact at one point we had about 10 MCr spread across several worlds =
and spent a few months travelling about to pick it all up again.

Well, I play it that way, too. Sure it has disadvantages, but there is
no better way of carrying cash from here to a system 4 parsecs away
instantly.

In my campaigns, I call them credit-crystals (\'cause the information is
saved on a holo-crystal). They are in several ways electronically
secured (code, fingerprint a.s.o). They come with an adapter. If
somebody pays you money, he plugs his card in your cardadapter and books
the amount directly on your card.

Disadvantages:
1) You better don\'t lose your card, or your money is gone.
2) All electronic securities can be cracked.

But I\'ll take that for comfortability.

That\'s $900-1200 for food bought over the counter (not at restaurants). Is
that so unreasonable? And a rent of $450-600 per month for a nice place 
to stay. Too little? It seems pretty much right if you convert dollars to
Danish kroner.

Unless you insist that all these items must be of the same quality all these
prices are within the proper range of costs in Denmark. Some are high and
some are low, but they are all possible.

Yes, if your idea of high living means that all meals must be taken at fancy
restaurants.

The problem with that is that the steps are all wrong. The difference in
expenses between SOC 1 and SOC 2 are 100% while the difference between SOC
10 and 11 is a mere 10%. IMO the reverse would be more plausible. In the
integrated Traveller economic system that I\'m working on I differentiate
between minimum expenses to keep up appearances for a given SS and average
expenses for that SS thus:

If EDU measures the amount of schooling one has, then the character\'s
initial EDU rating would logically measure the amount of schooling he has
had *before* starting a career (or getting advanced education, or whatever).

Am I missing something or are people not reading the rules?  You get 1 EDU
for *every* year in college/grad school.  No rolling involved.  It\'s free.

That\'s part of what I don\'t like and why I started this discussion in the
first place.  It\'s easier to get EDU than you think.  Way too easy in my
opinion.  And EDU affects way too many skills for it to be so free.

I see what you\'re saying.  And here is my answer to this, if one assumes
EDU is absolute:  You can\'t get any higher than F, but F represents the
highest level piece of paper the Imperium gives out (post-doctoral work, or
whatever they call it).

Yeah, but there are lots of places where that piece of paper would get him
a job and allow him to start learning new skills.  And learning those
skills would not mean his EDU would go up.

Well, in your case you were adding skill levels.  When you completed your
degree, your EDU went up to reflect the amount of schooling you\'ve had.
That work?

ROFLOL!!!!  Read on.

In many fields of learning, this is _exactly_ right.  Once you prove you
can get the piece of paper, the company you go to work for trains you the
way they want you to think.

In my opinion, getting a degree proves you have learned how to learn.  YOu
may or may not have also acquired several skills.

Given that, it doesn\'t really bother me that my EDU affects all the
different skill areas you mentioned above.  Why not?  Even if I don\'t
remember squat about them, I have learned how to learn, so when I need the
skill, I can quickly relearn what I need to know.

So I think EDU does measure the amount of schooling one has.

LOTS of good.  I have a degree in Electrical Engineering.  There are
*hundreds* of jobs that I could get simply by walking in and proving that I
have that piece of paper.  Not all may be EE related and not all may be as
high paying as my current salary, but they are sure out there. 

Heck, my current job is in Systems Engineering.  Did I take any SE classes
as an undergrad?  Nope.  Am I performing systems engineering now?  Yep.
How do you explain that?  1) my piece of paper got me in the front door.
2) college increased my ability to learn, so I can learn new skills that
have _nothing_ to do with my degree.

That make sense?  EDU is absolute.  It measures how much schooling one has.
 And I infer that it proves that someone has learned how to learn.

>My point is this:  If you are trying to solve a tricky Physics problem

>solve that problem more easily.  

Sure it does, if you accept my inferance above.  Remember, the other
assumption about getting a degree is that you are now a well-rounded
person, able to learn and understand stuff in lots of different areas (as
opposed to a technical school, where you only learn about one area).

I never claimed Edu, Str, or any other characteristic shouldn\'t go up
during character generation, only that Edu should not go up automatically
just because you sat in a classroom for a year. On the contrary, I
suggested keeping the roll to increase Edu if you get honors.

Unfortunately, I rolled a Spectacular Failure in pasting my house rules for
advanced education to my mailer and a big chunk of text got deleted. My
apologies, even I couldn\'t understand what got posted. Basically, my house
rule is to ignore the automatic +1 Edu per year of education and only
increase Edu if you make an Honors roll. There was some blather about
reducing the Honors target number and adding DMs, but this is of less
importance.

   Vegans are omnivores.  The original CT write-up indicated this to be
the case, as does the updated and expanded version I did for the New

P.S.  Vegans were originally desert dwellers that did most of their
hunting and gathering at night.  Because of this, they can see well into
the infrared portion of the spectrum.

Well, I\'ve been lurking for about a month now, and really
enjoying the traffic on this list.  I\'m one of those new
players y\'all were talking about a couple of days ago, and
I have a few questions - mostly relating to alphabet soup.

Basically, I\'ve been playing around with QSDS, SSDS, and 
the VDS in CSC (see what I mean?), and I have a list of 
questions a yard long, but they basically boil down to 
this:  will there be an expanded version of SSDS and VDS
sometime?  I haven\'t played Traveller since 2 games in 
1980, so I don\'t have the benefit of the experience most
of you have in knowing exactly what all of those little
gadget in the design sequence do.  What I could use is 
something along the line of GURPS Vehicles, with a little
more explanation.

Also, are there any errata for VDS and SSDS?  I have 
QSDS 1.5.

Well, that\'s it for now.  Thanks for listening/reading.

My thinking has changed to this after recent posts on this matter.  I 
agree.  

But, one thing to think about--there should be a difference between a 
0 level skill and no skill.

Half attribute is too much of a penalty for this system, but there 
should be some sort of bonus to having a 0 level skill, especially if 
it is not a default skill.

This needs some more thought.

Kenneth.

That\'s absolutely great!  As far as I know, you\'ll be the first to 
use it in a game.  I haven\'t even implemented it yet.

I\'m anxious to hear how it goes.  Please keep me informed.

Very interesting idea.  I\'m going to run some numbers on this.

I think that you will find that rolling all ones on the number of 
dice used in KBv2.0 will be too hard to achieve.  It doesn\'t give the 
players a good enough chance (read:  balanced with SF) to make SS.  I 
don\'t have the exact numbers in front of me, but I know that many of 
the SS chances using this system, with the number of dice rolled, is 
less than 1%.  In my book, that\'s way too hard.

> Any suggestions on tying skill level to spectacular success?

Not yet.  I\'m still tinkering.  I\'ll be addressing that soon.

Thanks for trying it out.  Let me know how it turns out.

If only the first hit in combat is taken on a single stat (typical T4 idiot

this from happening with a lethal round. What is wrong with this picture?

Jujitsu or something similar *will* work. The basic idea is to get your

They\'ve got to be in the "habitable zone" of the star, or close enough
that you can fudge things by playing with things like greenhouse effect.

>     What would be required to terraform such worlds?

Depends on the world. Also depends on how "permanent" you want the
change to be. For example, at TL12-15 you *could* give Luna a
breathable atmosphere. It\'d take a 100 or so years of "soft crashing"
comets onto it, and a lot of biological stuff to change the resulting
atmosphere to a breathable one. But it\'s *doable*. The trick is that
unless you import a new comet every decade or so, your atmosphere will
slowly go away. Best guess is that without "maintenance" you\'d get 3-20
thousand years worth of breathability.

>     What techiques and technologies would be developed/used?

Again, it depends on what is "wrong" with the planet. In some cases,
you just need to seed it with tailored bacteria/algae/etc and wait
until they make the atmosphere breathable.

In other cases, you\'ll need to "import" atmosphere or water. That takes
a lot of "nudged comets". 

Or you may be fudging with the temperature of the planet by making the
atmosphere or surface more or less aborbent or reflective.

They aren\'t going to be changing the *mass* of planets at even TL16. So
you are going to be dealing with surface temp, atmospheric mass,
atmospheric composition, and hydro percentage. And there are already
lots of books and articles on how that sort of thing could be done. No
need for new *science*, just engineering.

>     What time frame are we talking about?

Best case would be a planet that was ok except for the lack of native
life. That means the atmosphere would be nitrogen and CO2, with traces
of other things. And the seas would likely be full of organics that
hadn\'t quite made it to life. So with the right sort of "seeding, you\'d
be able to breathe the air in a matter of decades. But it\'d take
centuries to get a decent ecology going. Especially since the oxygen in
the air would be reacting with exposed rock and causing some massive
erosion (followed by "tectonic adjustments" ie earthquakes)

Worst case would be an airless, waterless, rock at the edge of the
habitable zone. You\'d have to import all the water and air (by crashing
comets onto it). This will take a long time as there\'s a maximum rate
at which you can bombard it. Any faster and the heat from the impacxts
will drive off gasses faster than you add them. It might only take a
few decades to nudge the right number of comets into the right orbits.
But it\'ll take centuries for them all to arrive.

They be astronomical. Bad pun, but true.

Remember, you *can\'t* relieve population pressure by exporting people.
But it\'s good to have a place to send the folks who are "unhappy". So
as you note "frontiers" are good things to have. 

I fully expect some of them to be penal colonies. Dump the prisoners
there with life support and instructions. Send them supplies and
otherwise ignore them. :-)

Slight problem here. First you have to assume the bullets are magnetic (last
I checked, neither lead nor depleted uranium were), second, if you reverse
the polarity on the magnet, the bullets will be drawn toward the south pole
of the magnet rather than the north pole. End result - you\'re still shot.

That\'s something that was on everyone\'s mind here in Athens this
last summer with the Olympic Football matches here in town. But 
the teams and their supporters were the friendliest, liveliest bunch 
of folks I\'ve had the pleasure of sharing a downtown victory cele-
bration with! Between watching some fantastic matches and 
partying downtown after, I wish every Olympic football final and
semi-s could be held here.

And of course, watching the US Women\'s bring home the gold
was a hoot as well <g>.

Well, IIRC, this is a predefined number.  That is when you actually design
the animal, you figure the average weight and roll 1D6 per 50 lbs. (or
whatever the rate is) to get the actual number of damage points available to
the animal.  I don\'t think I made sense.  Hmmm, maybe an example...

If the rule is 1D6/50 lbs, then what I am saying is that...

If you had an animal that weighed 25 lbs on average, you would roll 1D6
during creation for the damage number for that animal.  If I rolled a 4, the
damage would be 4 that is after 4 hits the animal is dead.  So...

for an animal that weighed 230 lbs on average, I roll 2, 5, 3, 2, 6, for
total damage points of 18.

Does that make sense?  Is that even close to what was being discussed?

GDW adopted a similar thing in all their games (first wound of the day and
you lose your next action), which gave rise to the ".22 alarm clock" in one
Twilight 2000 game I was in (a .22 pistol did just enough damage to annoy
someone, and healing was within a few hours (!)).  No grounds in reality,
mind you, but a humorous twisting of the rules...

Consider their homogeneity. Of all the major races, the K\'kree are the most
homogeneous. From the base castes to the highest steppelords, you would
have nearly a complete void of variation in computer systems. What easier
target would there be for Virus to penetrate and destroy in a rapid and
devastatingly complete fashion.

I disagree. The _return_ of this race to the fold, perhaps after a nearly
millenium-long diaspora deep to trailing, would make for an exciting story.
I love the K\'kree race as much as anybody. Who wouldn\'t love such a herd of
furry xenophobes?! <g>  But I\'m not willing to hysterically grip my CT
K\'kree Alien Module for dear life and let it get in the way of telling a
good story.

Thing of the conflict involved when the K\'kree try to move back into their
traditional territory, perhaps colonized now by Vargr and humans. This is
the stuff of campaigns.

All of us are entitled to governing our campaigns and ultimately guiding
history as we please in Traveller, but I guarantee you, if stasis is what
you love, your campaign\'s gonna get boring right quick!

        Yup. A Hardcover with one major race and three equally detailed
minor ones seems good, I agree. I didn\'t notice IG\'s mind was already made
up on this point, but it seems so... they are announcing the Alien Hardback
1, or something like that.

        Well, what I proposed was to release that two books almost together,
as resource books, but I have to agree that the pairing Vargr/Suerrat is
forced. As for Answerin, they will pair fairly well both with Vilani or
Vargr. So, under my POV, what would be better to release first would be
those two major races (Vilani & Vargr, a-la-DGP <g>), two key minor human
races (Geonee & Suerrat), two minor non-human races (I suggested Hhkar &
Newts, but could be any other), and two "bonuses". The problem is that,
somewhere, the pairings need to be a bit "forced" in order to cover them
all, and the same will happen with the one major+3 minor per book scheme.
The Geonee & the Suerrat would pair very nicely for a M:0 sourcebook, but
this pairing will make any "Alien" book heavily human-oriented.

        I will applaud this idea. Geonee & Suerrat + some other races
(Answerin, plus others, specially some brand-new one). Although this will
wreak havoc with the "Major race per book" idea, it seems to be a good way
to solve all the pairing problems.
        To summarize, I would personally be happy to see a couple of books
covering Vilani (because they ARE the background in M:0), Vargr (becasue
they are around there), Suerrat (because M:0 is when they are important) and
Geonee (for obvious reasons <g>), with some other races to add value. I like
the idea of a "Major race per book", but would not object (as a special
exception) a "Minor Human Races" book. (In fact, I want to work in it!!! ;-) ).

        That\'s a point. The truth is, the Aslan book could be made totally
Milieu-specific, and the Darrian just do not fit in the Milieu, but, also,
the Aslan are very important in the Spinward Marches area later, so an Aslan
book with details way after year 200 would be useful for M:1100 players, and
there are lots of them around, right?. If Milieu:200 gets it\'s own book, it
would be enough for the history and background, so maybe the Aslan book
could be a bit more general.

        Not really. I just wanted to say which minor/races I thought were
deserving a detailed write-up so far. There would always be little-detailed
races you can develop, but I like the detail of the Traveller universe - you
can call it *canon* - to grow over time. I would like more details on races
we have herad of for years, together with brand-new races with little detail.

        Yes. And such a book would be totally Milieu-unspecific.

        Yes, and that\'s the reason to propose them to be paired, for

        I strongly disagree about placing (1) last. About the milieux order,
the Vilani are the key for M:0 as background, and the Geonee and Suerrat are
very important for this Milieu. Anyway, it seems that IG prefers not to
explicitly cover the Vilani at the point.

I missed the issue of halving one\'s attribute the first time around but I
agree with Richard - the 3x multiplier for skill weighs heavily enough now
that simply having skill = 0 provides a simple, systematic penalty for
knowing nothing (or little...)

That would also explain the character who, by rolling boxcars during
chargen, winds up with an 18-yr old 2ndry school graduate with EDU = C...
I\'ve known a few people who IRL qualify for this, but most (certainly not
2.8% (=1/36) of \'em!) don\'t have their BAs or BSs by their 18th birthday!
Then again, getting degreed would certainly add SOMEthing to one\'s EDU, even
if not 4 (for BS/BA).  Possibly 1 for the degree and cast 1D6 <= years spent
before flunking out to get 1 if no degree...  I think advanced education and
honors should retain their adds to EDU - they imply hard, concentrated, work
- - above and beyond the sort of "coasting" many do to get BA/BS...

Arghh!!!  Sometimes one gets so focused on a point one forgets pesky little
things like THE RULES!  Even with average rolls 3D6 = 10.5 which may well
zero out the hit attribute.  From a play point-of-view, I now (humbly) see
no problem, but I still wonder about first-shot out-and-out kills...  

BTW - Citing chapter and verse as Dom did - especially in the case of a
rules brain-fart - is very helpful - Tx!

You should read about the War of the Cricket Match: the Royal Navy vs. the
Navy of Zanzibar 
If I remember well, the war lasted a whole 12 minutes, after a fleet of RN
Dreadnoughts sunk the only monitor of the ZN, and started shelling the
palace
of the Sultan...
And all this because the fleet headed to Z to see a Cricket match, and the
Z Sultan got nervous...

C.T.\'s "Book 8: Robots," however, says that the K\'kree make wide use of
"master/slave" robot systems, since this kind of thing goes well with
fondness for herds and hierarchies.  I admit this is really stretching,
but couldn\'t it be argued that this reflects a general K\'kree aptitude for
computer networking?  This MIGHT give them an edge, when the time came to
fight off the Virus.  On the other hand, it\'s hard to believe the K\'kree
had much experience with fighting off Viruses - their computers might be
widely (and elegantly) networked, but also "immunologically inept," which
would make the K\'kree EVEN MORE vulnerable to Viral attack.  Yes, K\'kree
military systems on the borders (PARTICULARLY the border with the Hiver
Federation) would be "hardened" against mundane viruses, but K\'kree
society is pretty placid and law-abiding, and technical knowledge is
probably rigidly controlled (no "schoolboy prank" and "thrill-seeking
hacker" viruses among the K\'kree), so the average civilian K\'kree system
administrator probably wouldn\'t recognize a virus (or a Virus) until
Really Bad Things began to happen.

Geez...and to think that I started this message trying to defend the
K\'kree!

TNE increased the difficulty level of the task by one if the character had
no applicable skills (in this case, no skill 0 skills, either).  Thoughts
about how well this\'d work in T4?

I can see an entire warrior-ritual growing from this innocent statement:  

...As John and Marie, locked and loaded, awaiting the inevitable attack by
the Vargr pirates, he turned to her, extending his blood blade - "Will you
shed your blood or shall I?"  As he crossed her palm, drawing the merest
line of blood, together they recited their warrior\'s creed (insert something
appropriate here...)

I would throw a bowl of Cheetos at whoever tried this stunt in one of MY
games!

Ah, yes, the dread RAPWWPOOOLT\'T\'TWLEWTATTE.

Long have I loathed him. With awed fear I watch the free space on my
Hard Drive crumble in his wake. The eater of time, forcing hundreds to
delete useless files.

I have been fortunate to avoid PAPUSP, but every now and then SPMAB
intrudes in my domain. (Does anyone else get stupid SPURS ticket info
every now and then?) I think the dread RAPWWPOOOLT\'T\'TWLEWTATTE is the
worst for me, since my software automatically decodes and downloads the
attachments in a separate folder (thinking them useful -- if I *asked*
for an attachment, they would be).

SPMAB can be instantly deleted and ignored, the dread
RAPWWPOOOLT\'T\'TWLEWTATTE, mangler of digests, corruptor of lists, spawn
of windoze, eater of space and time... is far more insidious.

*SPIT* to even _think_ the name of the Progenitor of dread
RAPWWPOOOLT\'T\'TWLEWTATTE causes the bile to rise in my throat. Only by
saying the name backwards three times can I avoid the evil curse...
Setagllib, Setagllib, Setagllib ;-)

I don\'t know what is worse, the foolish and arrogant programmers who
assume that everyone uses WINMAIL and therefore the default setting
should send the <expletive deleted> encoded <expletive deleted>
winmail.dat files, or the foolish and ingnorant users who aren\'t
considerate enough to learn how to turn that marvellous option off.

Well from the reply I got from IG sales it appears that T4 Deluxe may be

Joe, could you clarify with IG if the Deluxe books will be signed or not,
and by who?.  Was the statement in the IG newsletter about signing just an
off the cuff idea or something definate?.  Either someone at IG has got
their wires crossed or Virus is having a laugh.

Mind you, Marc could be sweating cobs over the prospect of signing another
load of books.  There\'s just enough time to suffer an unfortunate wrist

That\'s good to hear.  Hardback books say quality, they protect the pages
from damage much better, and shouldn\'t cost a great deal more.  Look at the
hardback Star Wars books, the game might not be to everyone\'s taste (it is
to mine) but the hardcovers look great and feel substantial.  I remember
that the Traveller Book came with a dust jacket, any chance that IG could
include one with the Deluxe edition.

I like this general view of EDU that seems to be condensing out of this 
discussion. I think we should consider the problem of aging as it relates
to either side, though....Whether you believe that EDU is the ability to 
learn and retain information, or if you believe that it represents years of
education, shouldn\'t it decrease w/ age just like INT does now? In fact,
given the example that keeps creeping up of "not remembering anything
I was taught in college", shouldn\'t we start rolling for EDU losses each 
5-year span after getting out of school rather than wait for age 30 or 35? <g>

Favorite T4 Pre-Combat activity

Real Men: Weapons check.
Real Roleplayers: Give rousing speech to crew over the intercom about
bravery, valour, and the glory fo the Third Imperium.
Real Loonies: Limber up and a little pepper with their whiffle bats.
Munchkins: stabbing selves in pinkies with their penknives.


     Anyone tried to pull that in *my* game wouldn\'t pull it off.  Period.

No referee worth the title would EVER allow this to take place. Stabbing
oine\'s self with a "very small" knife and taking a high velocity round in the
chest do not compare obviously in damage, sheer physical and mental
shock, blood loss, etc.

Anyone who would allow a rules lawyer in the group to use the letter of the 
rule in this fashion to run roughshod over the spirit of the rule and get 
away with it, isn\'t in control of his or her game in the first place.

If we agree that EDU is *just* the ability to learn and retain
information, then 2-3 year olds would be the "peak" and it\'s all
downhill from there. Start rolling those EDU losses 5 years after
*birth*. ;-)

If EDU is a mix of "the ability to learn" and "the stuff learned", as
one ages the ability to learn diminishes, and the stuff learned
(hopefully) increases. eg. "You learn something new every day." Thus no
need for EDU aging rolls. They cancel each other out. :-)

The problem still being that, as the current Traveller rules go, this
"accumulated knowledge" (ie: EDU) is used as the controlling attribute
for skills such as Physics.  The definitions of the other five (six)
stats are much better defined.

In other words, the role of the Education statistic for skills such as
Physics is far too powerful (based on its definition) than, say, the
Intelligence statistic for a skill such as Investigation.

Actually, I disagree with this statement (oddly :)  I tend to believe
that every individual is exposed to the same "amount" of information
perceived through their senses over their lifetimes as anyone else.
We can break down this knowledge into to major categories: useful
knowledge (practical knowledge taught in schools or viewed watching
Bill Nye) and useless knowledge (eg: David Letterman\'s "Stupid Human
Tricks").  It is all knowledge, albeit, most of it Cliff Claven-style
trivia, but it is still knowledge, nonetheless :)

HOW we chose WHAT we learn... now that could be considered EDUcation.

Not really, and here\'s why.

If we define an EDU rating of 15 (F) as being the equivalent of a
post-doctorate degree, people in the Traveller universe (with access
to longevity drugs) can _easily_ live long enough to acquire
additional post-doctorate degrees in other totally-unrelated fields.
Now the individual has multiple pieces of paper (which we will assume
means that the character DOES possess those skills).  Even without
Anagathics, multiple doctorates are still possible.  What is such a
character\'s EDU rating now? :)

Not if his/her EDU rating is already max\'ed out at 15.  According to
Traveller\'s definition, the character possesses all of the knowledge
his/her humanoid brain can hold at that point.  Yet, the character is
still allowed to improve his/her skills (partially representing new
knowledge) as well as simply experience life.  Remember how Bud Bundy
coached his sister Kelly for that sports trivia game?  Every sports
fact he managed to cram into her brain meant that some other knowledge
ended up being dislodged (like Al\'s existence).  As the Traveller
definition of EDU currently stands, we all have the potential to
become Kelly Bundys :)

While it is true that I learned other things that many would not
consider linked to my chosen career path at that moment of my life,
and that these tidbits of knowledge translate into my EDU stat, I
still don\'t see how this "definition" becomes the dominating factor in
determining my overall skill rating in "Survey" or "Robotics".

Why isn\'t EDU (as it is definded) the controlling attribute for
"Mechanics"?  Just because one is an academic course and one is a
trade course shouldn\'t make a difference (ie: carpenters that spend
two years in school and four-to-six years in their apprenticeship
should, by definition, have high EDU ratings, just like someone that
spent a similar amount of time at a university).  Otherwise, doctors
(with their high medical school EDUs) will always appear more skilled
in their field than an electrician (with the same amount of training)
in his/her field.

My solution: leave EDU "as is" and substitute it for the character\'s
general knowledge when necessary (ie: anything not listed on his or
her character sheet as a "skill").  It should also be used as an
indicator as to how easily a character learns.  It should not be used
as a controlling attribute for skills (it\'s definition as either "an
ability to learn" or "accumulated general knowledge" makes it too
powerful a stat to be used as a controlling attribute for skills such
as History, Archaeology, etc.).  Additionally, it should not be handed
out willy-nilly for every few years spent in school.

The only other solution would be to change the definition of Education
to something that would be *as* influential to a character\'s overall
"Law" skill rating as Intelligence is to that character\'s "Sensors"
skill rating.

If you believe it\'s an ability to retain information, I\'d agree.  But if it
measure years of education (as I do), then no.  The number of years that
you\'ve spent in school do not change simply because you\'re getting older.  :-)

Well, I\'ll forward the change I\'m going to use.  I suspect it won\'t be
particularly popular on this list.  Lots of folks argued that EDU was not
absolute, but no one really was able to convince me otherwise.

EDU

Education measure the amount of schooling that one has.  It is not a
measure of the number of skills that one has.  It implies that one
has learned how to learn.

Education is absolute.  Here\'s that absolute scale:

EDU  Formal Training
- ----  ----
5    Junior High School
7    Senior High School
9    Undergraduate
B    Graduate
D    Doctorate
F    Post-doctorate

Whenever a character completes the next level of advanced education,
his EDU is automatically raised to match.  For example, graduating
from graduate school the first time grants a graduate degree and an
EDU of B.  

If a character is generated with an EDU of 9, for example, then that
character will NOT increase his EDU by attending college.

Advanced education also grants skills.  If a character does not
receive as many EDU points as he would under T4 rules, he will get
additional skills.  Characters are also allowed to choose exactly
which skills they receives in college.

    'body' => 'I am not quite as vexed as many people on the list are about FS, but I do
have some rather catty comments.  I am going to assume this was a snapshot
of the state of affairs on or about year 0.  For what it is worth, I am
making things in Milieu 0 canon for my game, and am planning on adapting
everything else to fit.  (Good job, Joe, et. al.  While it does not quite
fit the FS map, the reasons for that are fair, and the background is good
grist for the mill.)

1.  Vland has a population of 3000 people?  This is the trading partner
that the new Imperium is so desperate to court?  Perhaps I miscounted, but
Vland has only a small fraction of the industrial output of Sylea, and at
such a lower tech level that it seems to be a "good fit" only for political
reasons.  The new Imperium seems a bit too practical to make that kind of
alliance without good economic reason.

2.  The entire Vilani sphere is very far away from the core of the
Imperium, and it is a hell of a trip for some rather disappointing worlds.
To fix this, boost the populations to something near that of the new
Imperium.  Imagine the worries at working with a world with population very
near your own, with a longer Imperial tradition, but with a tech disadvantage.

3.  I heartily approve of the 3rd Imperium being only 20 member worlds in
Y0.  This is a good size.  I would have liked some other worlds within the
early Empire being potential competition to Sylea - at least one other
world should have an A population, as otherwise, the 30 billion on Sylea
are just overwhelming.

I will be adding Shudusham back into the Imperium, as otherwise, some M0
history makes little sense.

4.  I do like the idea of a game in the "rapid expansion" phase of the
Imperium.  Adds tremendously to the player\'s desires to move quickly.  My
calculations indicate a double every 25 years works out about right.

5.  It seems that the other Imperial worlds near Sylea are not terribly
impressive - too many of them have tremendously low populations for worlds
that have been part of a federation for up to 650 years.  This is related
to item 3 - what political force generated by any of the other worlds in
the SF could possibly have bothered Sylea.

6.  I am going to have to assume that a fair number of other worlds have
been contacted, and their stats known - if for no other reason than that
the Syleans en route to Vland would have had to stop thirty some odd times
en route.  In order to explain the lack of such contact, I am assuming that
official policy was to pick uninhabited worlds as fueling stops en route,
as the contact was too tenuous to defend easily.  Further, they have been
exploring so far primarily for political reasons.  Only after Y0 did they
really start to explore in earnest for purposes of contacting everyone and
co-opting them.

7.  Substantial trade should occurring across the Imperial boundaries.  I
do not yet have a good idea how much as yet.

Given the bug in the FS data (law=gov), I am going to need to print new
maps anyway.  As long as I am fixing the data, I am going to use the
following rules:

A: No world with a population greater than zero will have a population of
less than ten million, unless it is an active colony, busily dying off, or
has other special circumstances.  Very, very few worlds should be in this
state.

B: In Y0, the map in FS represents those worlds that are "in the Imperium."
 Of the 19 worlds listen in the core sector, about 10 are considered
important, and the other ten are unhappy.  Likewise, only Vland itself has
a defense agreement, with another 5 or so of the 25 listed being considered
part of the defense border, but not really well defended.  Scouts have hit
the borders of Core, but have explored very, very few of the interior
worlds, and the ongoing wars are not helping.  Traders are comfortable with
the Silk Road to Vland and the subsector Sylea is in, but not much beyond.
This discomfort is what Clean wants to change with his new fighter
technology.  Scouts have made many contacts in the Sylea subsector, but
have mostly restricted themselves to observing beyond the borders in the
rest of Core.

C:  By Y20, the Empire has explored every world in the Sylea subsector, has
hit the four border of the Core subsector, and has on the order of 20
worlds in Core, 5 in Vland that it is committed to defending.  It has
roughly 10 more that it claims in Core and 20 more in Vland.  these outer
worlds have occasional fleet presence, but these outer worlds feel
tremendously under-represented.  Scouts have explored a number of worlds in
the surrounding subsectors to Sylea, and have made contact with a fair
number.  Further, traders routinely go along the Silk Road to Vland, and in
each of the subsectors surrounding Sylea, though they only visit a small
fraction of the worlds there.

D: They plan on having roughly three out of sixteen Core subsectors as
loyal members with permanent presence by Y40, as well as the entire 25
worlds known in Vland.  They hope to have roughly two more subsectors that
they claim completely, but which they have not really finished exploring
and making part of the Imperium.

Realistically, they will likely have roughly 35 central worlds scattered
through the three subsectors, and 30 outer worlds that they have contacted
and signed on.  They likely have between 30 and 100 contact missions going
on and perhaps 300 survey missions.

Traders visit the entire Core sector, though they only visit a small
fraction of the worlds there.  They certainly would like to contact every
world in Core by this time, but that target is unrealistic, and will likely
take a while longer.  A quick survey of them all might be possible, if the
heavy increase in Scout funding happens in Y16 like planned.

They are willing to claim the entire Core sector as theirs, and will try to
back the claim up, but they will really only do so in the chosen
subsectors.  I am thinking currently of the ones containing the remnants of
the Interstellar Confederacy and the Chanestin Kingdom.  Given the jump
three tech, they both may have to be moved closer, but I have not had a
chance to really do routes on the maps.

E: Y60 will bring perhaps 65 central worlds, and perhaps 60 more outer
worlds.  Between 60 and 200 contact missions will be taking place in Core,
with the first real expansions from Vland.  The Silk Road will begin to
look more like a main.

E: There is roughly one high pop, high tech world per subsector.  Sylea
wants to court those, but is deathly afraid of them at the same time.  They
would much rather nibble all of the easy worlds that they get for free, and
which would be cowed by a 90KT cruiser than risk serious problems with the
big worlds.  They are aware that the big ones are the only ones that really
matter.

Does anyone have any of the First Survey data scanned yet?  I am already
going to have to fix the law level data, and I would rather not have to
retype it as well.

web site, but I wanted to influence the people who I know are working on
such things now.

Yet another economic analysis for T4:  Per capita income, tech level
differences, and implications for fleets.

This one, I am happy enough with that anyone may reproduce it as long as
they let me know how it works out.

First, a few definitions.

What is a credit?

The credit is an imperial currency with a known, given value.  This value
is set by fiat, and is assumed not to vary over the imperium.  Military
pensions are paid in credits, and Imperial taxes are levied in credits.
Though we have no information on the topic, I have assumed that Imperial
taxes were a fraction of GPP, and likely a flat scale.  That later might be
my moneterist tendencies coming out.  If this is the case, then every world
is going to have to have regular conversions from any local currencies to
credits, and I expect a mercantile Empire would prefer payments in minted
on Sylea credits.

This has one obvious implication: on a world with lower production per
capita, people earn fewer credits.  The Imperium, based on the CSC prices,
constant payments, and other things, has made the credit a flat currency
across the various planets.  Assume the people of a given world have more
stuff to sell.  Either they will make more _valuable_ credits, or they will
make a greater number of credits _of the same value_.  TNE, if I recall
correctly, assumed that one needed to convert local to Imperial credits
when one hit the starport.  This makes it easy to understand all of the
price lists which did not change with tech level, but makes for a playing
nightmare.  Before buying anything, one had to convert local money into
Imperial money.

TCS, on the other hand, assumed a GNP valued in standard Imperial credits.
The credit stays flat, and local people are paid in Imperial credits.
Goods will vary in price, as will services.

I have tried both, and discovered that the standard credit made life
easier.  No money conversions on landing, but prices altered according to a
single number listed in the UPP.  (At least, in my UPPs.)  I would usually
try to come up with an expanded UPP listing the market sectors as divided
into Industry, Manufacturing, Agricultural, Resources, and Luxuries.  Each
number ranges from 0 to several hundred percent, and describes what goods
of that type cost relative to Sylea.

Under either system, the amount one has to shift from the listed values can
be worked out on a per-planet basis.

Before tackling those larger issues, lets look at the per capita income of
a person on a planet.  How much money does one person have?

To make life easier, lets start with the reference world.  I am still not
sure whether we would be better off scaling everything to Sylea, or to the
so-called Average world, but if we just come up with raw percentages of
GNP, we should not be too far off.

I intend to divide the world up by Social Standing first.  Other influences
seem to be less important than that.

Lacking anything better, I want to examine a real economy.  Traveller
referees may deviate from this model, but they should likely not deviate
too far from some real world example without good reason.  The data which
follows is derived mainly from the United States 1995 Census.  I am not
claiming any special status for the US, only that the data is easily
available online.  (See
http://www.census.gov/ftp/pub/prod/2/pop/p60/p60-193.pdf and the other
documents available on the census department\'s web site.)

From the above report, we see that in the US, quintiles of income per
household are:
		income/household
top 20		110K
high 20		52K
middle 20	34K
low 20		20K
bottom 20	8K

A different view comes from the incomes at the quintile breakpoints:
A household above	percent of the people earns
20			14K
50			34K
80			65K
95			113K

Table 12, p.48 indicates:
this	percent of the people earn less than
4	5K
12	10K
21	15K
29	20K
37	25K
44	30K
51	35K
57	40K
63	45K
68	50K
76	60K
85	75K
93	100K

A third view comes from the distribution of pre-tax income
If you are in	quintile, you earned this fraction of all earned money
top 20		49
high 20		23
middle 20	15
low 20		9
bottom 20	4

As a rough summary, therefore, we would not be terribly mislead with the
following distribution:  Please note: these are derived from the above, not
generated from the original datasets, thus may have a distinct bias from
data abuse.
A household	percent of the
above		others earns
4		5K
10		8K
12		10K
20		14K
21		15K
29		20K
30		20K
37		25K
44		30K
50		34K
51		35K
57		40K
63		45K
68		50K
70		52K
76		60K
80		65K
85		75K
93		100K
95		113K

Let me digress for a moment.  The above discusses household income.  It is
worth noting that, while the median household income in 1995 was $35K, the
per capita worker income was $26K.  Further, the per capita income was
$17K, as there are a number of people who do not qualify as workers.  While
any of these standards could work, I am going to keep working with
household income, as there is somewhat more information about households
than individual citizens.  Once we get it standardized into percentiles, it
is likely an acceptable approximation to individual income.

For what it is worth, the data is fairly linear up until about the 80th
percentile.  All points are within reasonable error bars up until the 85th
percentile, and it looks nicely asymptotic as it nears a hundred percent.
(I would hope that the data slopes up near the top, as there is no income
level per household on data scaled like this that hits a hundred percent.
There are, after all, five hundred people with fortunes greater than 330
million.)  With only two data points above that, it is hard to draw a
useful conclusion about what the terribly wealthy are doing.  The Mark I
Eyeball says that the 90% number should be something like 80K, instead of
100.  Social engineers claim this is evidence of clear separation of income
classes.  I will use this to justify fiddling above the 85th percentile

I am going to assume that the Traveller Social Standing as generated for a
character is representative of the population at large.  Further, because
of the generation rules, Social Standing does not alter often.  This does
not mean that 3 in 36 people is noble, only that 3 in 36 people spend money
on the same order as knights and barons.

The distribution of population per social standing is:
SS	Partition in 36	Percentile	Median %	Rough US equiv.
2	1		3		2		~4K
3	2		6		6		7K
4	3		8		13		10K
5	4		11		22		15K
6	5		14		35		24K
7	6		17		50		34K
8	5		14		65		46K
9	4		11		78		62K
10	3		8		87		77K
11	2		6		94		100K
12	1		3		98		130K

Neither SS2 nor SS12 corresponds to a sampled income level in the 1995
Census.  To cover that, I assumed that the low end was dropping at roughly
a third per step, while the high end had started to go wildly off the
scale.  Changing either of those numbers to suit the campaign is sensible,
and there are likely better sources of data for these extreme cases.  It
should be noted that at both of these levels of income, there are strong
incentives to misreport income.  It is also likely that social forces
decrease the likelihood of marriage if those proposing it do not make
enough to survive, flattening the curve near SS 1 and SS 2 for family incomes.

Weasel words aside, the household income numbers should not be a bad guide
to how income divides up across social standing levels.

Normalized to the SS7 income, real world numbers should produce something
like:
SS	Income as compared to SS for an industrial TL8 nation
2	12%
3	21%
4	29%
5	44%
6	70%
7	100%
8	135%
9	182%
10	226%
11	294%
12	382%

At this point, if we create a conversion for Sylean SS7 to 1995 America, we
can likely compute the appropriate income levels for the reasonable social
standings.  It is quite possible that Traveller has a flatter income model,
or a broader one, than the USA in 1995.  Sylea is in the midst of a boom,
while 1995 America still had some trouble spots from the recent recession.

An alternative version derived from European numbers in the days of feudal
aristocracy with a decent middle class indicate:
SS	Income as compared to SS for an industrial feudal nation
2	10%
3	20%
4	30%
5	50%
6	70%
7	100%
8	135%
9	180%
10	245%
11	330%
12	450%

The primary difference comes from the strength of the middle class.  In
feudal europe prior to the significant urbanization and rise of the middle
class, the numbers look very, very different.  By some estimates, a single
knight required the output of roughly a hundred peasants.  Further,
peasants were roughly 95-99% of the population.  This indicates income
tiers roughly like
SS	Income as compared to SS for an agrarian feudal nation.
2	50%
3	55%
4	65%
5	75%
6	85%
7	100%
8	115%
9	130%
10	150%
11	1000%
12	10000%

Of these various models, the Imperium is closest to the present day US,
arguably with an added boost at the highest social standings.

Many functionaries in the Imperium of executive levels have added social
standing.  This might explain the larger than expected number of people who
have been knighted in the Third Imperium.

Digression on the number of nobles needed in the Imperium:

It is worth noting that in the present day U.K., (according to a UK
almanack), there are approximately a few thousand nobles out of several
million residents.  Fiddling with the numbers a bit, and correcting for the
number of nobles required under a system that uses them at executive levels
leads to an estimate of between a hundredth of a percent and three tenths
of a percent of the population should hold noble rank of some kind.  By far
the vast majority are going to be knights and barons.

This does indicate perhaps a hundred million knights out there.  Are they
_all_ in those nine orders mentioned in the rulebook?  I would be rather
surprised if they had all met the Emperor, or been in any way personally
recognized by him.

This also leads to perhaps a million potential moot members on Sylea alone.

This leads to a clear problem - the above numbers assumed that something
like 6% of the populace has SS11 and SS12.

We could easily fix this problem by either stating that ten percent of the
people in the empire are in some way related to a noble, and thus share
some social status (a clear break with things written in T4), or we state
that characters are cut from "sterner cloth", and thus that the incidence
of high SS is higher among player characters and those they encounter than
in the general populace.

I prefer to assume, breaking canon, that of a family with SS12, there are
likely only a fraction that possess the title, and that the rest share the
lifestyle, but not the noble rank.  If the rank is Baron or above, they
well might hold lesser ranks, but they still live and work at a higher
level.  A player with an SS of 12 is living like a Baron, spending like a
Baron, likely has relatives who are Barons, and is probably kind of annoyed
that they personally have not been ennobled, or if he has, then he is a
Knight.

Further, the many jobs whose holders have the rank because they are in the
job can also use up some of those extra titles.  They might or might not
even make the registry, as the office holds the title, rather than the
individual.  This has serious enough social implications that I have to
think about it.

End of digression

Now, can this be converted easily to credits?

From the T4 rulebook, converted to yearly figures, room and board only, per
person.

Starvation Level: 1200 Cr
Subsistance Level: 3600 Cr
Ordinary Level: 4800 Cr
High Living: 10800 Cr

Working under the assumption that room and board are between half and two
thirds of what someone spends, we get total income levels of

Starvation Level: 1800-2400 Cr
Subsistance Level: 4800-7200 Cr
Ordinary Level: 7200-9600 Cr
High Living: 16200-21600 Cr

SS 2-3 lives near starvation, SS 4-5 at subsistance, 6-8 at ordinary, and
9+ lives at high living if the above numbers are valid.

Having the upper third of the populace at high living seems a bit much to
me, but perhaps is reasonable.  How many members of the modern middle class
have bought imported luxury sedans that they really cannot afford in order
to look higher status than they are?

Second data point:

Star passage: 8000-10000Cr.  By the above numbers, we are talking roughly a
years wages of a middle class family per person each way.  To me, this
seems high.  The image we usually used was of the trip to the border of the
imperium being roughly equivalent to the trip to California before the
trans continental railroad, or the ocean voyage to the new world around
1600-1700.  These all were voyages of months duration, and represented a
complete pulling up of stakes.

By these numbers, I am starting to think that this is the right image for a
single trip of two jumps!

Third data point:
A 20 year pension: 10KCr.  This fits in reasonably well.  Someone who is a
twenty year veteran is likely only 38, and has a high middle class income.
This encourages him/her to support the system rather firmly, without
putting him too far above the rest of the society.

Fourth data point:
Tramp starships exist.  They cost in the millions of credits.  If this is
true, then 7K as the PCGNP seems right out.  Given how much those ships
cost, _nobody_ with even a small interest in such a thing could ever be
poor, or even less than rich.  Alternatively, free traders are rarely going
to be owned by individuals or small groups.  Consider, the Forbes 500
starts at $300 million, so the wealthiest 500 people in America would have
some difficulty affording a yacht, and if they did, then it would represent
a significant fraction of the family wealth.

Fifth data point:
A TAS membership is worth something like 48KCr/year at a minimum, and thus
the lifestyle of the TAS member should be somewhere near that of a wealthy
knight or below average baron.

Expanding from the standard world to the rest of the Imperium.

There are two major hurdles: tech level and trade codes.

What does tech level mean?

In the cargo chapter, we are presented with a conversion of 10% per tech
level.  This has always seemed ridiculously unreasonable, as there are so
many things that one would want to do with higher tech goods that one
should likely pay whatever you have to get them.  I would be willing to
live with this if it were a multiplicative factor, but a simple additive
factor does not fly.

As a simple example, imagine how much PG&E would pay for a 1000MW fusion
reactor that can be fueled for years on a hundred gallon tank of non
radioactive stuff.  We are only tech 8, and that is a tech 12 toy.  This
implies that the tech 8 world would only pay about 5/3 more than the tech
12 people would.  If this is the case, then we have significantly
undervalued technology.

Giving it a fair value would mean that the only trade worth doing is that
between roughly technically compatible neighbors, as a significant tech
difference would make anything the low tech worlds had just not worth the
effort to transport.

I cannot see a tech level difference being worth less than a 20% difference
in general, though I could live with 10%.  Make sure they are multiplied,
though, so that the result is symmetric, in that selling from tech 12 to
11, and then 11 to 10 is pretty much the same as selling from 12 to 10.
Since the tech 10 world would have some trouble scraping the money
together, many merchants will give it a miss.

To figure out the selling price, multiply or divide by (1.1)^difference
depending on which way they are going.

Multiplicative adjustment factors to GNP by tech level:

10%/TL
Difference	Factor
- -4		0.7
- -3		0.75
- -2		0.8
- -1		0.9
0		1
1		1.1
2		1.2
3		1.3
4		1.5
5		1.6
6		1.7
7		1.9
8		2.1

2		1.4
3		1.7
4		2.1
5		2.5
6		3.0
7		3.6
8		4.3

I ruled that an industrial trade code was worth two tech levels of
production.  Non industrial was the same in the opposite direction.  The
world is assumed to have a standard level of production at everything else.

Ag/Non Ag has the same effect, but for agricultural goods only.

Rich and poor, I assumed referred to luxuries, which I assumed were only
half as important as industry.  A rich world gets one tech level\'s worth of
price boost, while a poor one is treated as the next level down.  This fits
with the idea that a trade code represents how the world has divided the
available workers and resources, and how efficient it has been at making
use of them.

Corollaries:
Many worlds have excess labor and productive capacity.  If they spend that
capacity on industry, then they will be an industrial world, while if they
spend it on luxury goods, then they are a rich world.

Worlds that do not have enough workers or resources applied to industry are
considered non industrial.  This might be by choice - on a rich world with
a lot of technology, they might choose to sell much of what they make, and
not produce as much as they could.

Lots of industry usually leads to higher tech.  Once they get higher tech,
they must decide what fraction of their factories to upgrade, and whether
to continue using the excess capacity for industry.  Most societies will,
but if they decide to relax and rest on their laurels, they may well
decided to become a friendly rich world.

It is even possible for them to pauper themselves.  If they have too many
of their technicians working in the steel mills, and not enough in the
consumer electronics, then the world might well become poor.

Thus, going from Sylea to a nearby tech 8 world would have 4 tech levels of
difference, so 10Kcr of goods from there would sell for 14,650.  Were Sylea
rich as well, it would be 16KCr.

A few questions:

Anyone have some idea on just how big the Imperial fleet should be?  Or
what kind of merchant tonnage runs through Sylea?  I note the information
that wildstar did for 1100 on the Missouri web site, but I was not certain
of the model.  TCS?

Starships appear to cost on the order of 0.1-2.0MCr/dT.  Fleets are
maintained by taxes on the governed.  From the looks of things, reasonable
taxes come out to 1-3KCr/person, and so each fifty million credit patrol
boat represents the tax output of 25,000 people.  Clearly, this should be
expressed as maintenance costs, crew costs, and so on, but this is not a
bad ballpark.

Sylea has an annual tax budget of 60TCr by this reckoning, leaving them
with the money for roughly a 20TCr military force.  Likewise, the merchant
tonnage going through should likely be on the same order, though I am
willing to listen to any arguments someone has, especially if they can find
references for cost of fleets vs. cost of merchant tonnage.

Any comments?

Hmmm.  There seems to be some miscommunication.

I just spoke with Tim, and he said that it is a certainty that all of the 
T4 Deluxe Edition hardbacks which are pre-ordered per IG\'s instructions 
WILL be gold embossed, numbered, and signed by Marc Miller.  He 
emphasized that Marc is aware and supportive of this, and plans to do 
it.  He also said that as soon as the books come back from the printer, 
he (Tim) will be making the arrangements for that.  So, it is absolutely 
certain that they will be signed, regardless of any miscommunication 
between Tim and the folks at IG/Beverly Hills.

As to time frame, I was told that they\'re /hoping/ to have them done for 
May, but (and here I quote Tim Brown) "with all the cool things Marc 
wants to do with the book, I can\'t say for sure that we\'ll have them out 
in May."  When pressed for further details on what specific "cool things" 
he was referring to, Tim said I\'d have to wait until Marc makes an 
announcement about that.

In other news, Emperor\'s Arsenal and the Referee Screen are coming along 
fine, and Tim said they\'ll be shipping by the end of this week.  Those 
who ordered direct can expect \'em in their mailboxes in the next week or 
so (depending on where in the world you are<G>).

Bearing to the left brings your sword arm to bear on them, much more useful

Swords are good for shredding vac suits, and don\'t leave holes in the ship.

<< In T4, mention is made of the nobles\' /code duello/.  If a noble were in a

Not necessarily.  If the planet is too close, you could add a sunshield at
the Lagrange point between the planet and star, as Martyn Fogg\'s Venus
proposal does (it blocks about a quarter of the incident sunlight, I
believe).  The other advantage is that the shield provides a _lot_ of
space for solar panels....

If the planet is too far out, add solettas (reflective mirrors in orbit)
to reflect otherwise "wasted" sunlight onto the surface.  Several Mars
proposals published in JBIS follow this tack.

Again, it depends on what you consider "true" terraforming -- must the
planet itself be maintainable, or can outside elements contribute: sun
shields, solettas, the occasional comet to replenish atmosphere, etc.

We also haven\'t touched on rotation rate.  Much of the 10,000-year period
Fogg\'s Venus proposal entails is taken up with "spinning up" the planet
using a planetary-scale network of cables to make it into a giant motor.
It\'s humorous, though it sounds workable to ignorant ol\' me, at least.
But it requires an expenditure of resources, money, and time that is
unlikely for cultures with FTL travel.  Planets that rotate too slow for
sustainable biospheres are likely to be bypassed, I suspect.  Planets that
rotate too fast just get more frequent nightlife.  :-)

That\'s close to what the rest of us know too.  :-)  We know from that
picture that they\'re shortish and furry.  We know from CT Library Data
that they claim "major race" status, but based on expanding from their
home world using STL colony vessels, not (as the Vilani insist is
necessary) using jump drive.  Later (MT? HIWG?) material indicated that
they are at least partially arboreal, have Ilelish as their homeworld, and
lauched a major rebellion against the Imperium (the Ilelish Revolt).  As
punishment, the sector capital was moved to Dlan and the equatorial
jungles of Ilelish itself were nuked into oblivion.  Kinda harsh, but
that\'s the Imperium for you....  Marc Miller evidently has in mind that
they may be major antagonists to the Imperium in Milieu Zero
(Consolidation Wars, anyone?), though the homeworld data in the
(admittedly buggy) First Survey is kind of disappointing on that hand.

I\'ve been wanting to detail them for a while, somewhat in the style of
Carlos\' Geonee.  Anybody else game?  New TML thread for those tired of
task systems?

Marc, is this along the lines of what you\'ve been thinking?

Alien Book I: Vargr
	Details on the race plus minor offshoots (Roth Thokken, etc.),
written from a "far-future" (post-1200) vantage point but focusing primary
detail on the Milieu Zero period.  Ensure enough "chrome" gets given that
the Vargr don\'t come across as simply pooches on their hind legs (even if
they are!).  Additional detail on nearby minor but non-human races: Brinn,
Tahavi, possibly Hhkar (though they don\'t fit M0), or a new one.  128pp
book, hardcover. 

Alien Book II: The Races of Man
	Another Milieu 0 product.  Discussion of the theory of the
Ancients, overview of Humaniti and homeworlds.  Factors of success in
evolution, survival, galactic politics.  Major Humans\' (Vilani, Zhodani,
Solomani) biology, culture, and history.  Lesser but significant detail on
three upper-tier minor races (Syleans, Geonee, Suerrat).  Coverage of a
few more minor and less-widespread minor human races (Darrians, Answerin,
Thaggeshi, Cafadans, Acheron, Floriani, etc.).  Make sure we get some
weird ones to help the book sell on strange biology as well as to pure
cultural nuts.  A nod to Solomani geneering could take a sidebar or two
(Wuans, Imperial Jonkereen, etc.). Basically, aim this book as a must-have
Traveller volume plus a useful resource for anyone in any system who wants
to run an sf campaign involving "aliens" who are really variant humans. 
128 pp, maybe more (192?) if authors, publicists, bean-counters all agree.

Alien Book III: Aslan
	A lead product for 1998/9, supporting Milieu: 200 -- The Aslan
Border Wars.  Narrative viewpoint is debatable -- do we want to include
"the secret" of Aslan "minorship", or leave that for long-term fans?  Even
leaving that aside, point of authorship could range as late as the 1100\'s,
maybe even touching on the ihatei invasion of the Spinward Marches. 
Again, spruce up the aliens so they are _not_ simply upright lions: 
acknowledge the Turkish source of the race name, dispel any C.S. Lewis
thoughts, and chrome these guys up.  Include sidebars on Aslan-cultural
humans, human-cultural Aslan, Zodia colonies, etc.  Detail nearby minor
races: Virushi, Ahetaowa, Ormine, perhaps a few newcomers.  128pp hardcover.

From here one, since we don\'t know the Milieu publishing schedule, things
get a bit more complex.  On the other hand, we\'ve already done the
traditional "biggies."  So how about:

Alien Book IV: Wards of the Imperium
	Multiple-milieu support.  Emphasize Droyne (and Chirpers) for
major section, since new game buyers of First Survey will be wondering who
the heck they are.  Fill the rest with species like the Jgd-Il-Jagd,
Githiashio, Crenduthaar, Dandelions, etc. -- all the CT aliens we can get
a hold of, to bring them back in print.  A super-Aliens-Archive.

Alien Book V: Trailing Strangers
	Weird aliens are harder to sell -- Loren Wiseman has, IIRC,
commented on the disappointing sales of the original CT Alien Modules for
these folks.  So bundle together the K\'kree, everybody\'s favorite militant
vegetarians, and the Hivers, untrustworthy manipulators.  Maybe take the
book to 192 pp. if the author(s) feel cramped.  Significant detail on
K\'kree contact in Gateway Sector, around the time of the Psionics
Suppressions?  Good detail on K\'kree-Hiver Wars, too. Include  K\'kree
subject races, like the Girug\'kagh (sp?) and others, and multiple Hiver
clients, like the Ithklur, Za\'tachk, and Gurvin.  Get some of the Keith
Brothers\' short-story work on the K\'kree (particularly the "interview"
published in JTAS) to add chrome and color.  Get similar stuff to make the
Hivers a more "real" presence.

That\'s an interesting conclusion. So, by logical extension, as Virus
penetrated the Two Thousand Worlds\' outer defenses, it would actually
_accelerate_ as it encountered less-hardened computer networks.

Yeah, I think the K\'kree would be in big trouble.

If there\'s one race whose computer systems would be _less_ likely easy prey
for Virus, it would be those of the Vargr. From subsector to subsector,
system to system, heck sometimes even world to world, the natural Vargr
propensity for internecine competition would result in more compatibility
problems than today\'s information systems professional could even dream of!
Virus might encounter an unpleasant bout of indigestion trying to eat up
Vargr computer systems. It would at least slow it down.

	Unfortunately, this analogy, and this problem does not hold up.
In an utterly isolated system (ie: little green men came down and offered
to sell PG&E a 1000MW fusion generator, the prices would be astronomical.
But, to make it a little more down-to-earth, so to speak, selling modern
autos to primitive countries here on earth.  If Ford were the only one
making and selling cars, then no problem, the tech will be valued quite
highly, considering the tech level difference.

BUT, when Ford AND Toyota AND GM AND Hyundai AND Suzuki all are around to
sell the high tech, then the law of supply and demand intervenes. Whenever
you have multiple suppliers of the same tech, the price will go down. The
Imperium operates in an environment where there have always been many
suppliers of a given technology (except, apparently fusion+ ;-) so the
differences in tech level won\'t be as marked. The differences in
SUPPORTING those TL-12 items on a TL-8 world...well, that\'s another story
entirely!

You are right and the lifting of the visor that originates the salute was to confirm the identity

Well, the original scenario was shipboard, but I wouldn\'t put it past some
PCs to try and set up a MRL in the corridor.  I could always have just one
PD radar active at any one time, and have it share info with the other sets
in the fire team.  It might even be possible to automatically "hand-off" the
job to a different suit at random intervals.  Once I\'m launched on, I still
have the classic infantry option of diving for cover.  Unless you start
getting into guided missles or drone vehicles, my basically man sized
Marines can go to ground.  If you do sic drone missles and the like on me,
then I\'m forcing you to expend a lot of firepower on small targets.

Infantry do not fight tanks.  At least not fairly..  I doubt that the
Marines expect a squad to try to take out a TL11-12 AFV without some serious
assitance.  But then again, if the opposition has that kind of firepower,
you\'re getting outside the mission envelope for the IM anyway.  The Marines
are a striking force, best used in situations where they have surprise.  For
long term, heavy fighting, you bring in the Army.

Makes perfect sense.  I also suspect that Vargr planetary governments are
probably a lot less dependent on elaborate bureaucracies (and computer
networks that almost always go with them) than, say, Imperial ones are. 
Bureaucracies flourish when power is transferred smoothly, peacefully, and
predictably, and this just doesn\'t sound very Vargr to me.  Yes, the Vargr
have lots of computers, and use them when there are no real alternatives
(plotting courses for starships), but I doubt the average Vargr has
anything like a Social Security Number, and when a police officer on a
Vargr world asks for your "papers," he might mean just that!  Shortly
after a Viral attack, Vargr administrators would have plenty of trouble to
cope with, but they wouldn\'t be staring (in shell-shocked horror) at blank
computer terminal screens, wondering which end of the pencil to put in
the sharpener...

Sorry, but I\'ve always been wary of any state founded to support a single
religion, too much potential for abuse.

You two are wisely ignoring an even greater Evil:  Clueless Idiots Who
Attach Gigantic Files You Have No Interest In To Their Posts!  Many the
morning I have sat in silent horror as my mail program attempts to swallow
an attachment roughly the length of the Mississippi.. with trembling fingers
I try to open the file only to find that it\'s in a format I can\'t read, or
for a later version of Excel...  The pain!, the pain!

In desperation, I scan for a website that such frippery could be banished
to, but invariably the sender has no clue as to how to set one up.. will
this madness never end!

Um, okay, but I must have missed the link.  Where can I get it?

And can you tell me what it does (if anything) in terms of planetary
geography?  Does anyone have a _good_ generator for detailed maps of
terrestrial planets?  I\'m working on one in my spare time, but...

Thanks.

That dodge goes back to CT.  The answer has always been: the small knife
wound and the ACR round you take next turn both come off a single stat
because the two are the first hits in different combats (AKA the
Anti-Munchkin rule).

	However, due to K\'kree racial superiority, they very rarely make their

mention the fact that they don\'t use the Deyo chip transponders (check out 
Survival Margin for the tragic consequences of not using this technology) -

As a practitioner of Jiu-Jitsu, I must comment. I weigh around
145 lbs. I\'ve thrown people weighing around 240 lbs. It\'s a lot of
work and it ain\'t graceful.

However, in a fight I wouldn\'t use a throw, because it takes too
long against someone that size. Besides, I\'d need to get at least
one arm around (for a hip throw) the waist and that may not be
possible if the opponent is wearing battle dress.

There are many other moves I could use. Most involve ensuring that
the foe is off balance first and then rapidly moving his legs out
from under him. No throws are required and these moves are fast
and sneaky.

Now, giving the distracting kick to the groin, that\'s another matter.

This is a fine point, but I feel it is a misconception, and here\'s why.

In this corner we have Joe Traveller, with UPP 777777.  He\'s a recent
college graduate with a skill of Physics-3. 

In the other corner we have Cleon Shugilli, with a UPP of 7777F7, a PhD in
Archeology.  He has a skill of Physics-3 as well due to the fact that a
cute girl he wanted to date was a physics major.

Now, we take Joe and Cleon to the world of Rutabega-3 in the Windhorn
sector.  They are each asked to plot the tragectory of an asteroid with a
particular mass, velocity, and position, given full information about the
star system.

We decide that, for the Rutabega system, this is an Average task,
requiring a roll of 2D.

Joe\'s target number is 10.  Cleon\'s is 18.  Why is Cleon\'s higher?
Because his EDU is higher.  Both people are given the same resources, the
same amount of time, and the same environments.  Both will probably
succeed, but Cleon is much more likely to give us the right answer.

Now, are we to assume that Cleon has a higher target number for solving
this orbital mechanics problem because his degree gives him a foot in the
door?  I don\'t see how.

Is Cleon\'s higher target number a result of the fact that he has learned
how to learn more effectively than Joe?  Maybe, because maybe he is able
to leaf through the books and reaquire skills and information he needs to
successfully solve the problem more quickly. 

However, I would argue that it\'s because his store of knowledge about the
topic is greater.  Cleon\'s higher EDU suggests to me that his knowledge
about Physics is greater than Joe\'s, even though they are equally
skilled.  That is how the skill system works, IMHO.

What this implies, to me, is that skill levels are in fact not absolute.
Two people with Electronics-2 might both be able to swap out the Deteronic
Frombotzer on my Air Raft, but the one with EDU C will know more about
Deteronic Frombotzers in general and will be able to accomplish the task
more quickly, efficiently, and safely than someone with EDU 4.

Finally, EDU, as presented by the T4 rulebook, CANNOT simply be a count of
how many years you have been in school.  Here\'s why.

Able Traveller, a cousin of Joe, has a UPP of 777777.  He attends College.
He receives +4 EDU, one for each year, leaving him with a UPP of 7777B7.
He has a BS or BA.

His twin brother, Baker Traveller, has a UPP of 777747.  He attends the
same university and also gains +4 in EDU, leaving him with a UPP of
777787.  Both students, Able and Baker, have spent the same amount of time
in school, both are college graduates with BS or BAs.  They have different
EDUs.

Their sister, Callie, has a UPP of 777777, but she does really well in
school and graduates with honors.  She has a final UPP of 7777C7.

EDU is not a linear measure of how many years you have attended school or
what sort of degree you have.  The best option is that it reflects how
much you have learned from both formal and informal sources.

This makes a lot more sense and, frankly, I\'d have to agree with you.  I

I don\'t think that\'s true, or, if it\'s technically true, it\'s materially misleading. 

It\'s technically true to the extent that nobles after year zero are defined as the upper 
strata of Imperial society, holding ranks granted by the Emperor and owing fealty to the 
Emperor and his or her successors.  Before that empire and that emporer, there were no 
nobles who fit that definition.

It\'s misleading, however, because it suggests that prior to the Third Imperium, there 
were no nobles and no noble customs and usages (the quoted line above was a response to 
comments about the code duello).  For example, the Vilani had nobles:  "Certain of the 
old Vilani noble families have maintained more of the old culture..."  Supp. 11, Library 
Date N-Z, at 30.  

After the Interstellar Wars, Solomani officers became military governors of large pieces 
of the Ziru Sirka. I and others have argued on this list that those military governors 
assumed hereditary powers in the face of the weakness and eventual collapse of the Rule 
of Man -- that is, they grabbed what they could while the grabbing was good.  In the 
1776 years between the collapse of the Rule of Man and the formation of the Third 
Imperium, this largely self-made nobility provided whatever stability and defense there 
was.  When Cleon formed the Imperium, he had to co-opt this pre-existing nobility by 
affirming its traditional rights.

N.B.:  I haven\'t read Milieu: Zero yet, so the above may not be canon.

Well, in martial arts, there are lots of "breaking techniques", which
would a good fighter allow, to hit *through* the armory. That\'s just a
matter of Ki, as a proper m-artist would say.

I myself thought about introducing a martial-Arts skilltable for
traveller.

Any suggestions?

        Yes, and I think that when someone first asked why the Vilani
weren\'t described in the races section of T4, the official (?) answer was:
because the players *are* Vilani.

>	BTW.... whats a Suerrat?  I\'ve seen the picture in

        Minor human race from Ilelish, IIRC. Covered with hair. They started
interstellar travel with generational ships. I think there are some
references around there, e.g. under the word "Major Race" (or maybe "minor")
in MT\'s Imperial Encyclopedia. I don\'t know if they were treated in detail
somewhere...
        Btw, in the page of the MT\'s Imperial Encyclopedia where the Suerrat
are cited, there is a nice illo of a human minor race. I always assumed that
it was from the Loeskalth (eliminated by the Vilani), who were treated in
the same page, but, now that I stop to think about it... could they be
Suerrat? Has anybody considered that illo?

        Carlos.

        Looks good. Departs totally from the Human/nonhuman mixture, but
maybe that\'s also a good thing.In the minor offshoots, recall the Urzaeng...
I have had several Urzaeng PCs and still haven\'t seen a good write-up on them.
        About the far future vantage point, I personally prefer the old DGP
style: pretend the articles are written by people of the approprate eras,
and published, so that you can handle them to the players if you like.

        Clearly too much. Maybe it would be better to split this one in two
or more hardbacks, the first being purely M:0 with the Vilani, Geonee and
Suerrat. Call this "Human Book I" instead of "Alien" <g>. About the Syleans,
are they a minor race? I thought they were just a nation, with no biological
differences!. They are racially vilani with a small Solomani component, right?
        Reserve the Zhodani (with the Vlazhdumecta!) and make Human Book II
Solomani (but, then, where have the Vegans gone? <g>). Time to reconsider it
all.

        Once the period 1100 is included, I must insist the Darrian fit here
quite well, instead of in a Human volume.

        (snip good sketch)
        A Hivers/K\'kree joint book would be a good one if sales on
individual races are low, yes, but making it 192 pp would discourage most
buyers. And this one should really be multi-Millieu. 
        Evil thought: create Vargr/K\'kree wars to boost interest. Far
colonies of those "red vargr" to Trailing...

	I would not put it past players to try and do _*ANYTHING*_,
especially if it involves large-caliber weapons and high explosives.  In
fact the more destruction that is likely to result, the more probable they
are to try it.

I\'d bet yes. 

You don\'t *throw* the person. You get them to make a move expecting you
to resist, and instead, you *help* them. The classic example is someone
trying to push you over. You wait for the push, and instead of pushing
back, you *pull*. So you go over in a *controlled* fall, and the other
guy goes over in an out-of-control fall. 

Again, you don\'t use *your* strength except to provide *tiny* bits of
guidance to the opponent\'s strength. And you don\'t *resist*, you
*assist*. 

Thus the weight of the BD is *irrelevant*, as you aren\'t moving it. You
are letting the *wearer* move it, and just nudging it a bit at
strategic moments. You just get him to place *himself* off balance, and
then help... :-)

F.  If you were to get a Doctorate and then a second, what would we call
you?  Dr. Dr. Lindsay?  No, you\'d still be just Dr. Lindsay and your EDU
would not go up.

No, no, no.  At any EDU level.  Learning skills is NOT the definition of

No, no, no, again.  Reread the definition of EDU.  EDU is NOT defined as
the amount of knowledge a brain can hold.

Given that you\'re choosing to redefine EDU, most of your remaining
arguments don\'t make sense.  I suppose it might be best to table this
discussion and simply agree that we disagree on what EDU is.

This reminds me of the way I explained the difference between INT and
WIS to D&D players (lo, these many years ago).

INT says "That\'s a dragon"
WIS says "Hope it didn\'t see you!"

So, in Traveller, I\'d have INT be the "native cunning" bit, and EDU be
"accumulated knowledge". Therefore, INT would let you figure out things
you *didn\'t* know, whereas EDU is the chance that you *do* know
something about it.

Most of my rep for "hard science" here on the list is based on my EDU.
But I don\'t have any "degrees", just a high school diploma. But I also
read *voraciously*, and could probably successfully "challenge" larhe
parts of any undergrad science curriculum I chose to take. 

My ability to *apply* all the things I know is INT based. 

Note that the "life expereince credits" you can get at many colleges
for *relevant* experience in the real world, shows that EDU *is* based
on "what sticks", not merely what you\'ve been exposed to.

The trick with graduate degrees is that in most cases a lot of the
stuff *had* to have stuck, or you\'d never have finished the program.

At the very least, you need the ability to know where to look for info
you can\'t recall (a skill much like "rules lawyering", except applied
in a socially acceptable manner :-)

parsecs it is from the Darrian\'s star to Vland, the Aslan "capital",
Zhdant, Core, and Sylea.

I want to figure out if the "odd" flare activity would be seen from
those places before or after their explorers got near the Darrians. 

The activity *would* be noticed by any decent observatory looking in
the right direction at the right time. So that, along with all the
evidence of "Grandfather\'s War" laying around would make that area a

But that\'s the whole *point* of most "Oriental martial arts". You

through the lists (I have about fifteen to go until I catch up), however   
I noticed someone asking what happened to the Aslan as a result of Virus.

[Biographical Note: I have read the source material]

I wrote an article, with character generation rules and some background   
for alien races in TNE for Valkyrie magazine in about 1994 (I\'d have to   
check the exact publication date). Here\'s what I wrote about the Aslan:

*** Note. These are my opinions drawn from my campaign, and are not   
intended as a match for a flame war (but if you really, badly want to   
have a flame war, there isn\'t a lot I can do to stop you except point you   
to places where you can get dialysis to let the bile out safely). ***

<quote>
Aslan fared better than most against Virus, although they did not escape   
unscathed. The Virus crossed the border from Imperial space into Solomani   
space as if it wasn\'t there - their computer systems were so alike in   
many ways. But the Aslan Hierate was split up into thousands of clans,   
each with their own computer systems, codes and procedures - and each   
with their own enclaves on Kusyu, the Aslan homeworld. The virus crossed   
the last eight parsecs to the Aslan/Solomani border in three months. It   
took four months to cross the one parsec to Kusyu, where it almost   
dead-ended.
Now, almost seventy years later, Virus still ravages Kusyu and the   
subsectors immediately around it, but the rest of the Hierate remains   
relatively Virus-free. All Aslan know that the sacrifice of their   
homeworld bought them enough time to save the rest of the Hierate by   
instituting anti-Virus measures. Those measures, coupled with the   
enormous diversity in computer systems, managed to stop the spread of the   
Virus almost dead. But at a terrible, terrible price.
Treatment of captured Virus strains vary from clan to clan: some isolate   
and study it; most destroy it along with the infected system; and some,   
mostly in Reaver\'s Deep and Daibei, have \'befriended\' certain strains   
(albiet in secrecy) and are working with them to build new civilisations   
in that border area.
Aslan treatment of Imperial remnants is another matter, however. Most   
Aslan view the Virus as a made thing - a weapon made by Imperials and   
released without thought. The fact that Virus was not designed to be used   
against the Aslan doesn\'t matter - they regard all remnant Imperials as   
culpable.
Because Aslan honour views attacks on an unsuspecting enemy as cowardly,   
most Imperial remnants found by Aslan are revived before being spaced or   
hung. Some clans view the Imperials as being without any honour, however,   
and some remnants are blown up with their ships, never having been   
revived.
In Aslan society, the first son is groomed to take over from his Father   
as head of the clan. All the other sons (called Ihatei - literally   
\'second son\') are expected to leave home and make a new home and clan of   
their own. This has been the basis of Aslan expansion for hundreds of   
years and has barely changed in all that time.
In the past, the majority of the Ihatei struck out Coreward and Trailing   
(towards the Imperium) - indeed, the Emperor Strephon had an honour guard   
of Aslan. Now, although there is some expansion into Daibei and towards   
the Regency, almost all Ihatei have turned their faces Spinward and   
Rimward, expanding away from the Virus.
<end quote>

Interestingly, as we played on in this campaign, one of the main Aslan   
male PCs refused to believe that Virus existed on the grounds that he   
couldn\'t see it, touch it, hunt it or kill it. At one point, he all but   
accused the females of having made it up!

I think this would also be the case within the Aslan worlds to an extent.
The different clans would use their own systems, but they would be able to
interact with the clans nearest them (the females would see to that).  So as
you said about the Vargr, it may not (and probably didn\'t) stop Virus, but
"it would at least slow it down."

This combination (of Vargr and Aslan computer differences) as well as the
Great Rift IMHO are what saved the Spinward Marches.  I mean, the Vargr had
invaded well into the Corridor sector, and Virus would have to have gotten
past them to get to the Marches.  Either that, or go through the rift or
around the Aslan route, and I don\'t see either of the second two happening
nearly as fast (if at all).  So in a very real sense, Norris owes that
precious little flame of his to the Vargr diversity and compatibility issues.

	Well, IMHO this is just a further example of why the whole edu stat
ought to be ditched; we have three positions:

1) EDU = objective years of schooling.  IMHO, this is a really wierd stat
to use with knowledge-based rolls, since 18 years of art school will not
teach how to refibrillate a frombotzer, calculate an asteroid trajectory,
etc.  Conceptually, it\'s really inelegant; Amount of time you spend in the
education system does not, IMHO, have a direct effect on your
problem-solving abaility.

2) EDU = fuzzy "how much you know": IMHO, suffers from the same problem as
the above, really; you aren\'t using your entire store of knowledge when
dealing with a given problem; my store of knowledge of amateur astronomy is
going to be of zero use to me when I\'ll be trying to tell my clients
whether to sue or not, and my knowledge of sailor\'s knots useless for
finding Hale-Bopp.

3) EDU = fuzzy "how well you learn": OK, so how does ability to learn help
you apply a skill you\'ve already learned in an practical situation?  This
definition ought to apply in gaining skills through experience, not the
task system.

	I think that a far better way of modelling how education works is
that you put the skills that it gives you in the skills section of the
charsheet, and use them with the INT skill.  Have stat increases from
higher education terms go to INT or SOC, and perhaps have more mental stats
to reflect different aspect sof cognition.

	As it is, the existence of this whole thread and debate is just
evidence of EDU being extremely problematic.  Are we having the same
problems with SOC, STR, or INT?  No, because they make sense.  EDU doesn\'t.

I think it would, but I think it would make the K\'Kree very vulnerable
to attack by the Virus.  Once one Master got taken over, suddenly the
Virus would control dozens of other robots. This would probably lead to
more Puppeteer Virus strains in K\'Kree space.  

Since K\'Kree space is so far away from Imperial space, by the time
Virus got there, it might have evolved away from the simple suicider
Virus strains, into the more interesting strains, like Doomslayers.
This would lessen the direct impact of the Virus, but it would create a
more subtle deadlier enemy.  The Virus might keep the K\'Kree somewhat
intact to use them for its purposes.  The K\'Kree might even go along
with some of this.  AFter all Virus doesn\'t eat MEAT. (or anything else
for that matter.)

Notes

     Catullus Aerospace presents its first quasi-military starship. The
\'Greek Fire\' class Mercenary Cruiser is designed to meet the needs of the
Imperial contracted mercenary group or corporate security organisation. We
would also be delighted to assist any planetary governments in discussing
how a contingent of \'Greek Fire\' class ships could assist in fulfilling
their local security and rapid military deployment requirements.
     Armed with 4 of the latest, and most powerful yet, Sylea Industry
approved heavy laser turrets, alongside 4 standard heavy missile turrets, a
\'Greek Fire\' class starship is your company\'s ace in the hole for that hot
drop into hostile territory. You need no longer hope that a decent
percentage of your lightly armed shuttles, or temperamental drop capsules,
arrive safely. Now the fire support for your elite shock troops can come
with them all in one package.
     With these advanced weapons systems and the provision of 4 of the
recently released \'Guard\' type sandcasters, your \'Greek Fire\' starships can
also be used for anti-pirate operations such as base attacks or
neutralisation and boarding operations. The advanced communications suite
also allows its use as an orbital support and command platform, or even for
control of an orbit against a non-military opponent.
     Each \'Greek Fire\' ship is capable of carring up to 40 troops. This
includes provision for a planning room for the troop and shared large
quarters for every two soldiers. This means that your troops arrive in prime
condition and preperation for the upcoming battle. Support facilities
include a full medical bay allowing for immediate treatment in safe
conditions of any casualties.
     Separate large staterooms are provided for the Captain and First
Officer of the ship. All other crew are accomodated two to a large stateroom. 
     For wilderness operation, or in a hostile location, fuel scoops have
been provided which will fill the ships\' fuel tanks in a single hour, giving
you maximum flexibility. The scooped fuel can then be refined in 10 hours.
     Two Modular Cutters are provided to increase the flexibility of the
Mercenary Cruiser. These allow the despatch of negotiation teams, orbital
surveillance of multiple locations, and rapid dropoff and pickup
capabilities. Details of these modular cutters are shown below.

Modular Cutter: The Modular Cutter is a multi-purpose cargo vehicle which
can be fitted with a variety of 30-ton (420 m3) modules. The outer shell of
the cutter\'s mid part open as a large cargo hatch, and a module is attached
to the cutter\'s spine between the cockpit and engine. The cargo hold has
lighter armor that the rest of the cutter (AV 20, Armor 10), but counts as
normal armor (AV 40, Armor 20) when a cargo module is carried internally.
The cutter has build-in fuel scoops which are used only when a fuel module
is or flexible 30 DT fuel bladder is fitted in the cargo hold. The external
dimensions of cargo modules are 4.60 x 25.26 m.

In my campaign I assume that a sufficiently high level of Brawling
(like 3+) qualifies as knowledge in some form of martial arts.
This implementation is simple and doesn\'t require a separate skill.

Tell me about it.  On my train trips to work I have to read two Pratchetts

Yeah, like the GSV "Size Isn\'t Everything" (which is over 80km long), or

I was one of those people :-(.

People tried to help me, and, for some time, the problem faded, only to
return at embarrasing and in-opportune moments.  I consulted secret,
Ancient texts, which promised much, but always said "for some reason, this
doesn\'t always work" in the small print.  I thought I was going to have to
construct my own private universe to hide in, never communicating with the
outside again... until I discovered Eudora.

Now I no longer suffer from "=" at the end of each line, or attachments
longer than my messages.  I\'m not a WINMAIL.DAT, I\'m a free man!

Remember, "throwing" someone in Jujitsu or aikido does not mean lifting
them up and launching them somewhere else, but taking their balance and
"helping" them to meet the ground.  However, it works best against someone
with *low* reflexes and poor balance and I think a battle dress equipped
marine would be anything but.

Given the right circumstances, it *might* (although I\'m pretty doubtful) be
possible for a martial artist to throw our BD equipped friend, but they
certainly aren\'t going to be able to keep them pinned on the floor with any
wrist locks ;-).

Thanks, since I copied some of the stuff  from your page, and I got

   Wow, what brought this spate of simplistic political analysis to a
   mailing list devoted to Traveller?

   Definitely not, but the death rate due to violence in Israel is lower
   than in the US. As far as relations with other countries go, in the
   last 30 years, Israel has gone to war fewer times than the US has.

   Israel has Arab citizens (those Arabs who live in Israel proper, not
   those who live in the "occupied territories" of the West Bank and
   Gaza.)  And I\'m not sure what restrictions you would advocate that a
   democracy should place on its religious citizens.

   Apology accepted, but surely you are aware that the majority in the
   Knesset is non-religious. Israel was founded to support a
   racial/ethnic group, just like the nation states of Europe and Asia
   (and, for that matter, the Americas to some extant). All states have
   potential for abuse.

   Other than Pysadie/Aramis, I\'ve never had to deal with governments of
   type D or E; they are simply too rare and have never come up in my
   campaign. I dealt with Pysadie/Aramis pretty much along the lines
   detailed by "The Traveller Adventure."  My only quandary came up when
   the players had fled the planet (they were being held their after
   inadvertently becoming priests of the local religion).  The Pysadians
   tried to get them extradited to return to captivity. Normally the
   Imperium will send criminals back to a planet to stand trial, and I
   had to think of a reason why it would not do that in this case.  My
   ultimate reason was that the jury at the extradition just decided not
   to convict because they found the law silly, so the players did not
   become fugitives simply for fleeing Pysadi. Obviously, they could
   never return to Pysadi again, or they would be found guilty of
   fleeing and punished.

>----
>The new ASASA Huscarle class assault cruiser is the first design to come out
>of the ASASA shipyards following the recent acquisition of Cygnus Jump
>Systems Pty and Far Horizons Shipbuilding Ltd.  This new design is intended
>to transport and support a company sized body of troops in potentially
>opposed operations, and should prove ideal for use by corporate or mercenary
>teams.
>The Huscarle has been built around a standard 1000 ton spherical hull,
>exclusively using QSDS compatible components to allow repairs to be made
>quickly and easily at any class A or B starport, without having to carry on
>board hard to obtain custom parts.
>An ASASA (formerly Cygnus Jump Systems) CJS-30/2 jump drive gives the
>Huscarle a range of 2 parsecs; the 200 tons of jump fuel carried internally
>(in collapsible dismountable tanks for maximum flexibility) is sufficient
>for a single maximum range jump. In system maneuvering, utilising four ASASA
>"Merlin X" gravitic thrusters, can be performed at a sustained acceleration
>of 2g.
>The Huscarle is fully streamlined permitting atmospheric operations and is
>capable of wilderness refueling from gas giants or suitable bodies of water;
>the onboard ASASA HP-24 fuel purification plant is capable of processing a
>full fuel load in 21 hours.
>1210 MW of onboard power is provided by a coupled system of three ASASA
>Prometheus series fusion reactors.  10.3 tons of L-Hyd fuel tankage is
>dedicated to the reactors, allowing 290 days of continuous operation at
>maximum output.
>Controls, sensors and communications (full details of the systems provided
>are available on request) are the highest specification QSDS compatible
>systems that can be fitted into a hull of this size.
>The standard weapons systems provided on the Huscarle are 10 ASASA "Archer
>III" missile barbettes and two ASASA "Vindicator II" laser batteries; these
>systems are capable of operating in ship-to-ship, ortillery and close ground
>support modes.  Bridge workstations, allowing remote weapon operation, are
>of course fitted as standard.
>A 16 bed state of the art sickbay is included to provide medical facilities;
>facilities for two medics are included as part of the standard crew
>complement in addition to any that may be part of the troop detachment.
>The ship\'s Captain is accommodated in a large stateroom, the remaining crew
>being supplied with small staterooms.
>Many designs currently available for the role only allow maximum of around
>40 troops to be carried.  ASASA consider this to be too small except in
>highly specialised situations and therefore the Huscarle offers acommodation
>for a total of 150 troops: 8 small staterooms for officers and/or senior
>NCO\'s and 142 bunks for the troopers.
>Once in jump space the 200 tons of (now empty) jump fuel tankage can be
>collapsed, providing an additional 150 tons of space for the troops to use
>whislt preparing for their mission.
>200 tons of hangarage/cargo hold and a vehicle workshop is provided for the
>company\'s equipment and vehicles.

>     Ce Acatl Corporation is very proud to announce its entry for the second
>THUDDD design competition.  The "Horus" class Mercenary Cruiser uses
>state-of-the-art technology, coupled with CAC\'s century of small-warship
>design experience, to deliver maximum flexibility and firepower in a small
>troop insertion starship.
>     The emphasis in our Horus design is on survivability.  A Merc Cruiser
>is not normally deployed into a system unless space superiority has already
>been established; the class\'s small size, weak armaments, and operational
>profile make any other use very risky.  The major threats to an MC are:
>     * Lurking System Defense Boats (SDBs),
>     * Deep-meson sites on the highest tech worlds, and
>     * Small-unit fire during opposed landings.
>
>     We\'ve taken each of these into account in our Horus design.  A powerful
>meson gun, coupled with twin dual-laser turrets, will make any SDB think
>twice before tangling with a Horus.  The meson gun is also ideal as an
>orbital artillery ("ortillery") weapon for suppressing defending forces
>during ground assaults, or as counterbattery fire against deep meson sites.
>     Defensively, the Horus really shines.  Quad sandcasters, a nuclear
>damper, and a meson screen, lasers, and hull armor protect the ship against
>all major categories of space weaponry.
>     Because we know that a tired, unhappy soldier is an ineffective
>soldier, the Horus features the roomiest crew and troop quarters ever
>available on a ship in this or any similar class.  The troop quarters are
>highly reconfigurable, allowing modular reuse of unused quarters space as
>additional storage area, training rooms, or shop space.
>     It is a sad fact of life that the troops and crew aboard a Merc Cruiser
>are subject to serious injuries, often far from the nearest hospital. That\'s
>why our Horus MC provides a four-bed sickbay for on-the-spot treatment, plus
>a large emergency low-berth capacity (more than half the standard crew
>level!) for stabilizing those patients whose injuries can only be treated at
>a hospital.
>      In keeping with Ce Acatl\'s commitment to Open Standards, the Horus is
>not delivered with the two 50-ton cutters which it can carry.  We feel that
>other manufacturers produce better 50-ton assault cutter designs than we
>could produce on our own...and when you\'re going into combat, you want the
>very best.  Our sales department will happily assist Horus purchasers in
>obtaining appropriate cutters on a third-party basis, should this be=
> desired.
>     Finally, the Horus is designed with maintainability in mind.  Every
>system on board is built from standard, off-the-shelf components readily
>available throughout Sylean space (and beyond).  We don\'t want our customers
>postponing critical operations for weeks just because the nearest phase
>diode junction that will fit the thruster coils is five parsecs away. With
>the Horus, spare parts are usually only as far away as the nearest starport.
>This use of standard components also accounts for the attractive base price
>we can offer on the Horus.
>     The Horus Mercenary Cruiser:  Reliable, powerful, flexible...and
>inexpensive. Don\'t start your next operation without one!

>Designer\'s notes:
>
>     The vehicle shop is intended as a combined shop for engineering,
>vehicle maintenance, and so forth.  I used the vehicle shop stats as that\'s
>the larger of the two shops described.
>     Cargo space is obviously low; that\'s why I describe the troop quarters
>as modular and configurable.  If your mercs are willing to double-bunk or
>whatever, then more power to them; you can buy back some space that way.
>Similarly, the 10 large staterooms are there because I didn\'t expect that
>the upper tier of command staff would be willing to sleep in anything
>smaller; if your crew feel differently, there\'s a bit more room as well.
>     The ship doesn\'t have missiles for several reasons:
>     * With space so tight, the last thing we need is another
>       consumable to lug around.
>     * In my mind, a merc cruiser should be operationally self-
>       sufficient; you can run out of missiles, but (with scooping)
>       you can\'t run out of power.
>     * There wasn\'t enough room for MFDs without sacrificing something
>       else.
>
>     Finally, needless to say, this puppy is 200 tons bigger than the
>classic Happy Fun Ball, and a different shape as well.  Given its
>configuration, my working name for it was "The Ball Popper." :)

>     In response to the recent Imperial RFP, "Armed Paramilitary Transport
>(Light)", Aurelian Industries submits the following tender:
>     Gladius-class Light Paramilitary Transport
>     This vessel is designed to transport a small force (up to 47 troops)
>into a potentially-hostile landing zone, either directly or via the carried
>30-ton Ship\'s Boat.  The vessel is armed with an array of missile and laser
>weapons, allowing the ship to support a landing operation, defend a landing
>zone from approaching ground or aerospace forces, or even destroy light to
>moderate space defenses.  This vessel is also quite suitable as a
>exploration ship, allowing a group of trained scouts or observers to get
>into a dangerous area without needless risk.
>     The Gladius features a 10-ton minmal hangar deck for any vehicles used
>by the platoon, which doubles as a centralized meeting room for the troops
>and crew.  There is also a machine shop to aid in the repair of the unit\'s
>vehicles, weapons or equipment after action, as well as a fully-equipped
>2-bed sickbay.  There are also five low berths to aid in getting seriously
>wounded troops to a proper hospital, or for securely transporting important
>prisoners.  In addition, there is more than 11 tons of cargo space available
>for carrying additional supplies.  To aid in long-range expeditions, the
>ship is equipped with fuel scoops, and carries an on-board fuel purifier
>capable of processing 10 tons of fuel per hour, enough to fully process the
>total fuel allotment (jump and power plant) in about 13 hours.

It seems, then, that there are two uses for EDU.  The former, accumulated

its all over.

	Something thatI\'m arguing,though,is even after K\'kree computers 
are compromiseed, the effects would be less. Referring back to Book 8 
(which I don\'t have in front of me, so bear with me) is that the K\'kree 
make extensive use of dumbots, and don\'t like handing any real power over 
to computers.

	There is an analogy between 1990s autos and K\'kree starships. 
When you get down to it, there is quite a bit of computing power in your 
1997 auto. But does that mean some enterprising hacker can designa virus 
to take over your car? NO! Beacsue it simply isn\'t wired that way.

	However, once the Hivers get their act together, and start 
chasing out all the Virus-infested, computer-heavy Hiver warships, I 
think quite a few might migrate towards the 2000 Worlds.

	Oh, TBW - the comment about the K\'kreegoing along with the Virus? 
I don\'t think so - the K\'kree are some of the biggest bigots in 
Traveller.They don\'t take orders from ANYBODY.

the premise that the Vargr were susceptible to Virus. His c.1200 data
indicates that the Vargr nation-states in Windhorn, Provence, Tuglikki, and a
good chunk of Gvurrdon were steam-rolled by Virus due to a Vargr neglect of
infrastructure. I don\'t know what he background he used to develop this and
whether or not it\'s canon. I tend to agree with this assessment based on the
limited materials I\'ve had to read about them.

The "fierce competitiveness" mentioned, although true, doesn\'t stike me as an
automatic guarantee of slowing up Virus. IMO, this could definitely be said
about the Aslan. The Vargr though (generalizing) primarily raid.
Infrastructure is secondary. Vargr raiding is well known. The Vargr also tend
to be slightly lower in TL on avg than the Imperium. I\'ve interpreted this to
mean less sophisticated systems (or the ability to maintain them) and thus
easier to crack.

No, no.  This was not my point about getting the foot in the door.  You
mis-represented what I said.  It does not apply here.

This is how I thought it would apply.

This is not a bad idea, and one that I had not thought about.  But here\'s
my problem with it:  if my degree is in History and I have Physics 2, why
should it influence my physics tasks if my "store of knowledge about the
topic is greater"?

I\'ve read through your example, and again you did not honor what I have
stated.  Using my house rule, everyone who leaves college leaves it with
the same _absolute_ EDU value.  No matter what level you started at, if you
hung in and got the degree, your EDU would go to a certain level.  

So this example does not accurately represent my point of view.

As NonIn are the flip side of In I\'d say give the In two levels for

This is just a thought, but has IG (or Marc) made any plans to upgrade The
Traveller Adventure for T4 and re-release it?  I don\'t have the adventure
and I\'ve heard it is one of the best, and I would like to be able to get it.

I would say that the Imperium won\'t handle extradition per se, but that upon joining the 
Imperium, member states become signatories to mutual and reciprocal extradition treaties 
with all other member states.  So when your PCs landed on Regina, the Reginan 
authorities, having previously been preserved with a request for extradition from 
Pysadi, would have arrested the PCs and held an extradition hearing in conformity with 
Reginan law.  The result of that hearing may have been a decision not to extradite, 
which would have solved your problem.  The order denying extradition would trump any 
requests for extradition served on other member states, but the PCs might be subjected 
to multiple extradition hearings (every time they went to another Imperial world) at 
which they would have to present the Reginan court\'s order.

The Imperium\'s role might be to carry the order by xboat network throughout the Imperium 
(or at least the Imperial part of the Spinward Marches).  If extradition is granted, 
the requesting government must provide transport (which could be as simple as low berths 
and a guard), or pay the extraditing government for transport.  If neither government 
can handle transport (that would be a very rare case), the Imperium might help.

That doesn\'t support my point that there was a noble class in the Ziru Sirka -- it just 
refers to noble families of Vilani ancestry in the Third Imperium.  I didn\'t read my 
post critically before I sent it.  I apologize.  

I\'ll look at my sources again tonight.  Vilani society had a rigid caste system, so I

Yes, Banks is \'dark\' in ways all the goth-techno-cyberwannabe authors
these days could never dream of.  And if you pay attention, the moral and
ethical questions he sets up are just as intriguing as the plot itself.  I
can\'t think of a better source of inspiration for a challenging
roleplaying campaign, even if you just copy his \'feel\' without any
particular events crossing over.

Yeah, the Culture\'s taste in ship names is one of the best things in
\'Consider Phlebas\' and \'Use of Weapons\' (both are must-reads, btw).  My
favorite is the name given a scout cruiser converted into a battleship at
the start of open hostilities after a long-simmering period of tension: 
The GSV "No More Mr. Nice Guy." :)  The pirate vessel "Clear Air
Turbulence" (not a Culture ship) is also rather nice.

At this point, and to the best of my knowledge, there are no plans to 
re-release The Traveller Adventure.  Let us get through this year\'s

I follow your argument, but it depends on how much you let the players get
away with. I rationalise the high damage on a first hit as coming from
system shock etc. I wouldn\'t allow the rule to be abused as described in
your description. And I\'d probably give them blood poisoning to teach them
a lesson.

I also randomly allocate the later damage when I\'m running a game. I like
gun fights to be lethal. If the players are stupid enough to get into
one....

Another way to up the lethality is to adopt a rule I recall reading about
being in a very early CT edition, namely if a characteristic drops to zero
you have to roll 10+ on 2D to survive (I would allow medical/first aid to
mod the roll). I\'m not certain if the rule existed - none of my copies of
CT have it, but it was mentioned in a very old White Dwarf.

The point I was trying to make was that the combat system, if played with
the spirit I believe is behind it, is lethal.

Roughing it, using just CT Supplement 8, Library Data (dimensions for
sectors are width (spinward to trailing, subsectors are 8pc across), then
height (coreward to spinward, subsectors are 10pc across), gives:

To Vland, 3-1/2 x 1/2 sectors or so is 112 x 20 pc or 113.8pc (371 ly)
To Kusyu, 1-3/4 x 4 sectors, about, is 56 x 160 pc or 169.5pc (553 ly)
To Zhdant, -3 x -1-1/2 sectors yields -96 x -60 pc or 113.2pc (369 ly)
To Sylea (Capital/Core), 4-1/4 x 3/4 = 136 x 30 pc or 139.3pc (454 ly)

If these figures are accurate to within, say, about a subsector (10pc),
then we will have observation dates within 30 years or so of being
correct, enough for basic historical planning.
 
> I want to figure out if the "odd" flare activity would be seen from

The Maghiz occured in -924, says Alien Module 8.  So we can calculate
dates of observation, in chronological order, as:

	Zhdant (-924 + 369) = -555
	Vland  (-924 + 371) = -553
	Sylea  (-924 + 454) = -470
	Kusyu  (-924 + 553) = -371

For what it\'s worth, the Zhodani Consulate reached its "current"
(1100\'s) size circa -1000, the Sword Worlds were colonized beginning in
- -399, Zhodani first contact with the Darrians (canonically) was in -187,
Imperial Scouts contacted Darrian (canonically) in +148, and Aslan arrived
at Darrian in +585.

But only if the flare were recognized as artificial -- and only if,
amongst the mountains of data produced by astronomy on such a large scale,
somebody took notice.  Recall, the Maghiz was not a supernova: Darrian
itself was not vaporized by the disaster, only scorched.  :-)  Darrian\'s
star, Tarnis, is a G1 V with a far M1 companion (disagreements on whether
it\'s M1 VI or M1D -- either seems unlikely) -- but, in short, not much
worth noticing from hundreds of light years away, in the midst of the Long
Night (or, in the case of the Aslan, their post-Syoisuis cultural reform
period leading up to the Great Conclave).

But that limits the use of the supplement in non-Milieu-Zero settings...
which means you either frustrate buyers or get non-"canonical" campaign
histories (horrors! :-).  I think the period description ought to go in
some Milieu 0 supplement (an adventure?) -- the Alien Book should
specifically support the current Milieu, but allow for use elsewhere.

I think IG would be hard-pressed to sell two hardback volumes about
humans, fascinating as they might be to the die-hard Traveller collector
types....  So I think splitting it is a lousy move, both in marketing and
financially.  Think how much you save on space from the more similar
biologies!  And 192 pages is a lot, after all....  I think it would work.

> About the Syleans, are they a minor race? I thought they were just a
> nation, with no biological differences!. They are racially vilani with a

Aha!  One of my pet pieces of information.  CT Supplement 5, Lightning
Class Cruisers, strongly implies the existence of several minor branches
of humaniti, some of which we\'ve never heard of yet.  (Of course, that may
because these itsy-bitsy tidbits are no longer considered "canonical," but
I\'m feeling difficult these days).  To wit, we know about ships with tail
numbers and names 6328 Vilani High Lightning, 6351 Geonee High Lightning,
6365 Suerrat High Lightning.  In the same pattern, thus suggesting to me
the same meaning (human races existing under Imperial leadership), we have
6326 Azhanti High Lightning (duh), 6327 Sylean High Lightning, 6350 Fiorin
High Lightning, 6357 Acheron High Lightning, 6366 Ilurian High Lightning,
and 6372 Luriani High Lightning.

So, the overzealous mind like mine might conclude, first, that the
Syuleans are indeed a human minor race (the multi-bureaux area centered on
Sylea in the Ziru Sirka implies the presence of a much-coveted industrial
and customer base to be shared -- and note that 6365 is Suerrat, not
Ilelish, so it\'s race rather than world name), second, that we still don\'t
know about the minor humans known as the Acheron, Azhanti, Fiorin,
Ilurians, and Luriani.

I have some notes about the Acheron of my own design: they\'re of Neanderthal
heritage (CT Library Data implies not all minor human races are of Homo
sapiens: some are merely Homo).  They spent centuries living underground
after the Final War, and, due to their F-type primary, still live a
primarily underground and noctural existence.  I was going to write them
into the adventure I had planned for Chris Cox\'s "Feast of the Voyagers"
image contest, but, well, you see, I\'m directing this play....  (Anyone
here in the Houston area who likes Shakespeare?  Check out web site
http://www.rice.edu/BakerShakespeare -- plug, plug!).

The Syleans certainly had extensive Vilani influence (viz. those bureaux),
and many Solomani must have settled there as well for the world to be a
late capital of the Rule of Man.  Sylea is Earthlike enough that there
probably aren\'t immense biological differences... but maybe, for example,
the cutlass training and code duello of Milieu Zero are relics of a more
formal, Renaissance-honor-type Sylean culture that the "invaders" adopted?

And, hey, the Azhanti, Fiorin, Ilurians, and Luriani are still up for
grabs!  I\'ve been mulling over good "niches" for them -- fur-covered
arctic dweller, for example, maybe a herd/caste dominated type like
something between the Droyne and K\'kree... this is the sort of thing, to
me, that would sell a "Races of Man" type Alien Book.

Why?  They\'re humans, after all.  And the Aslan in the Confederation would
seem to be moving closer to human norms of behavior rather than vice versa.
What if I "insisted" that human-culture Aslan be included in the humans
volume?  It would make about as much sense.

Heck, I\'m not writing these things, nor am I employed by IG as staff
(though I _am_ jobhunting... do you guys allow telecommuting? :-)...
so, sure, while we\'re just dreaming, or fulminating, or sh*t-kicking, or
whatever we\'d like to call it: our imaginary versions of these books
(which might or might not resemble the final product at all) can contain 
whatever you want. Just remember that I do hate those guys....  <chuckle>

There\'s not a big price jump from 128 to 192, if I remember my print
buying correctly (more than that kills you, though).  Especially if
they\'re going hardcover anyway, I figure the space is worth it _if_it\'s_
needed_.  We\'re not looking for filler here, and CT\'s original Alien
Modules for K\'kree and Hivers were 40 and 48 pages, respectively.  So 128
is certainly practical: I was just being flexible.  Though not as flexible
as those pesky Hivers can be... damn those tentacles....

I like it!  I\'ve found myself wondering what\'s up coreward of the rift
that splits the K\'kree from the Vargr, then splits in turn to create a
sector-size (or more) island up in, ahem, "Kring Noor" sector....

It depends largely on the industrial capacity of the country in question,
and what the production cost of the high tech goodies are.  I am theorizing
that high tech things are fairly cheap for high tech people, affordable a
tech level or two down, and virtually unobtainable much below that.  This
can be argued, and I will try to show the assumptions that lead to it.

I believe that this is the situation in much of the Third Imperium, or
should be.  I like the play opportunities offered by the present system
more, as it is worth the player\'s time to sell to low tech planets, but I
have not yet found a reason why this would be the case.  If you see
otherwise, explain, as I would prefer to play in a place where players sell
to the low tech people regularly.

In most cases, though, most of those primitive countries are not more than
a tech level or two back.  Much of the Traveller charts are predicated on a
just unbelievable amount of tech difference.  It is my understanding,
subject to new data, that by the time you reach a really primitive country,
such as any group of aborigines or non tech South American Indians, that
the high tech goods they have are mostly those disposed of as not very
useful by the high tech countries.  One has to have a reasonably large
amount of local low tech industry to produce enough stuff to interest a
high tech culture.

Consider a hypothetical country that has not updated their tech base, so
that their tech is still two tech levels back, such as the parts of the
former USSR where they had concentrated all industry on military gear,
leaving the underlying infrastructure lacking.  Alternatively, a Liberian
house mate when I was getting my MS in math claimed that major parts of the
Liberian tech base were still fifties era, and swamped.  This likely puts
them behind by a tech level or two.  I understand that India has chosen to
boost the tech of certain parts of the economy and country to completely
modern standards, at the cost of leaving other parts essentially unimproved
from turn of the century tech.  This would be three or four tech levels
difference.  (I do not have enough data for those to feel really comfortable.)

We agree on this, as a monopoly pretty much always charges what the market

Yes and no.  Whether there are many manufacturers or few is not as
important as how hard that tech is to make, and how much the manufacturer
has to get for it.

Car companies must make on the order of 10K for a cheap runabout in the US.
 They can make cars that actually sell for $7, but they would rather not.
A family of US minimum wage workers could afford such a thing on their
$19000/yr combined salary, if they can amortize it over enough time.

A TL6 population has many members who can afford such a thing.  While the
entire population cannot afford runabouts, most members of the middle class
can.  A ship can make a lot of money trading with people like this, as they
do have enough industry to make trade goods, without having so much tech
that they are uninterested.  This seems closer to how most high tech-low
tech trade in Traveller claims to be, and I hold that this is really only
sensible for a 1-2 tech level difference.

These "nearly technologically competitive" planets can do quite well, as
the goods they produce are likely good enough for many purposes.  If chips
are expensive to ship, for example, one can likely use labor in almost any
partly industrialized country to assemble sealed hard drives and
motherboards into working, tested computers.  The local industry might not
be up to building a Pentium/PPC fab plant, but it certainly can build
cases, cables, PC boards, and so on.

The TL4 culture is a completely different story. I would be surprised if
the archetypical family in the TL4 area making $2 a day could afford such a
car?  It would be useful as all hell to them, despite difficulty
maintaining it and fueling it, but they do not have the money to buy it in
the first place.  If there is someone at TL4 whose income is derived from
several hundred such low wage workers wanted this cheap car, though, they
could afford it.

If someone who can afford it does so, and then uses it up to the point
where they no longer care, they might well sell it to the low wage workers
at a price the low wage workers can afford.  The original wealthy owner is
getting some return for something which is nearly valueless to them, and
which might well give them more cash in the long run.

Therefore, on this very low tech world, new high tech goods will be
expensive.  How expensive is the crux of the matter.

Only if the multiple suppliers brings the price down to where an individual
can afford it.  I can easily see a one or two tech level difference being
worth only 20-50%, and that being taken as profit.

There are two cases.  The first case assumes that high tech worlds produce
so much stuff that selling all that the low tech worlds want is a no
brainer, and the other case assumes that it is hard to make goods, and so
if they sell some stuff to a low tech world, then they are not selling to a
high tech one.

The first case means that high tech worlds produce so much stuff there is
no lack of supply.  The biggest lack is how much money the low tech worlds
have to buy the stuff.  Under these circumstances, prices on low tech
worlds will fall, as the manufacturers really want to sell all the stuff
they can make.  There is, however, a fly in the ointment.  

The amount of money a high tech world has to spend is proportionally to
just how good its industry is.  If industry gets really, really efficient
as tech goes up, then the high tech worlds will find it pretty cheap to
produce those goods.  On the other hand, they know that a high tech world
has lots of stuff to pay for the goods with.  A low tech world will not be
nearly as efficient, and so will not have a whole lot of cash.  They will
need the output of dozens of workers to get the equivalent of one high tech
worker.  It can work out if the high tech worker can produce lots and lots
of stuff, as then one high tech worker can _produce_ the stuff needed by
dozens of low tech workers.

There are two corollaries: high tech people make a lot of money compared to
low tech ones, and high tech goods are very, very inexpensive, so the low
tech folks can afford them anyway.  It looks like T4 has gone this way as
far as power goes.

The second case is not as interesting:  if high tech worlds do not produce
very much, then they are going to want to sell to high tech markets.  They
have the money, and the re likely not going to want to export.  Prices will
go up, and high tech worlds can pay marginally more than low tech ones.

True, true.  Many a game has come out of trying to keep a high tech item
running without a support system.  Wonderful game fodder.

Click!

So if I\'m following your train of thought correctly, the EDU ladder is
as rigid as is the SOC ladder (I don\'t think I like where this is
going :)

According to what I think you\'re saying, it is the attainment of the
_post-doctorate_ that gives a character an EDU rating of F, and not
necessarily the knowledge and skills gained along the way (these
appear as "skills").  While this might simplify things, I think it
greatly misrepresents the role of "Education" in Traveller (and RPGs
in general).

By using the mere possession of a diploma to represent a specific
character statistic, how can you explain its association with skills
such as "Survey" and "Robotics" (and its non-association with other
skills such as "Acting" or "Streetwise")?  Since the current task
system uses "stat plus skill", EDU is _far_ too powerful for the
definition you give.  Even if we use Kenneth\'s KBv2.0 system, the
problem doesn\'t go away (although it becomes less severe).

Oh, and "Dr. Lindsay", I kinda like that!  Of course, I used to work
with engines, suspension, and oil, as opposed to muscles, ligaments,
and plasma.  But still, if those damn deities didn\'t insist on
re-engineering my patients every year... (you think a doctor has to
memorize a lot of info :)

Exactly WHO\'s definition? :)

Traveller: "...amount of schooling" [you define schooling on a fixed
scale, with pre-school at one end and a post-doctorate degree at the
other; I define it simply as "exposure to knowledge"; we both agree
that the term "schooling" can mean any classroom-like environment]

Big Thick Dictionary: "the knowledge, skill, ability, or character
gained through teaching, training, study, or experience; the study of
the methods, principles, and problems of teaching and learning"

Lotsa RPG\'ers: "the natural ability to learn; most general knowledge
not represented by skills (on the character sheet)"


By putting a maximum limit on EDU regarding the first definition, you
are telling me that at one point in my schooling, my EDU rating will
max out and additional schooling would be futile (for the purpose of
raising my EDU).

Regarding the second definition, you cannot put a maximum limit on EDU
by it\'s very wording-- everything you experience increases your
Education :)

The third definition, while not official, is perhaps the best, since
it creates the least amount of confusion and explains why many RPGs
have skills _and_ a statistic representing "Education" or Wisdom".  Of
course, this definition means that the EDU rating has no upward limit
(except for how long you can live).

Regardless of which definition used, this _still_ does not explain why
the EDU stat is used as the controlling attribute for skills such as
"Law" or "History" (or more to the point, _both_).  As I stated below,
the other stats work much better with the skills associated with them;
the problem I have boils down to those linked to EDU.  I\'ve watched
players generating characters in the past, who have screamed out with
glee upon rolling box-cars for their EDU rating.  EDU does, if you
check, have the ability to become the controlling attribute for up to
forty (40) skills!  That is VERY powerful, indeed (_too_ powerful
based on a piece of paper)!  :)

I might be redefining EDU, but only because the current definition is
weak and doesn\'t explain its association with certain (and only
certain) skills.  I originally thought _your_ arguments weren\'t making
any sense, until it clicked that you might be talking about the actual
"diploma" received from a post-doctorate, and not some form of
esoteric knowledge incapable of being defined as a "Skill".

Here\'s MY definition one last time...

"EDUcation (as it applies to RPGs such as Traveller) represents the
character\'s natural ability to learn.  It also represents all
knowledge, skills, and abilities gained throughout the character\'s
lifetime that DO NOT specifically manifest themselves as knowledge,
skills, or abilities on that character\'s character sheet."

=46urthermore, the accumulation of specific groups of skill levels (eg:
Medical-3, Biology-3, & Perception-1) can be used to symbolize a
specific degree or diploma possessed by the individual (eg: 1st-year
Medical student).

   Two nits to pick:

   (1) Neadertals were (probably) H. sapiens.  This has recently come
   into doubt in some circles though.

   (2) Neanderthals lived 30-100 thousand years ago, long after the
   ancients had come and gone. This is much more certain.

   I recommend H. erectus as an alternative.  Erectus died out about 100

Yes, good thought.  MT handled it that way too.  

Maybe we could do it this way:

		If you don\'t have a skill, and the GM will let you try, you roll at 
one level higher.

		If you have a 0 level skill, either default or a skill that has 
been reduced due to modifiers, you can roll just using your 
attribute.

I like that.  I think it will work.  Since MT used this type of 
system, I was thinking about implementing it in KBv2.0.  Your post 
cinched it.

Kenneth.

KBv2.0 is the new task system that I\'ve developed for T4.  It was 
designed to fix some of the things that people did not like in 
KBv1.1 (which, in turn, was designed to fix the problems with the T4 
task system as written in the book).

There were two things that people did not like about KBv1.1.  It 
required some awkward math during the game (double one thing, halve 
another, and add them together) and used the 1/2 die common to T4.

KBv2.0 was designed with several goals in mind, but two of them were 
to fix these two problems with KBv1.1.



What is KBv2.0?

It\'s a simple task fix for T4.  Here\'s three steps to using KBv2.0.

			1)  Experience Score (skill x 3)
			Go through your character sheet, multiply all you skill levels 
			by 3, and record this next to the skill.  This is called your 
			character\'s experience score.  (You might want to record it in the 
			area where you list the character\'s skill\'s base characteristic, 
			if you put that on you char sheets.)  This calculation will only 
			have to be done once unless your character goes up a level.

			
			2)  Target Number Calculation (Experience + Attribute).
			In T4, you calculate your target number for task throws by adding 
			skill and attribute together.  In KBv2.0, you add your character\'s 
			experience score and his attribute together to arrive at the 
			target number.


			3)  Difficulty Codes.
			Change the amount of dice thrown--the difficulty codes--to what is 
			listed here.

			Easy			Auto/2D
			Average			3D
			Difficult		4D
			Formidable		5D
			Staggering		6D
			Impossible		7D



Where can you find KBv2.0?  Well, right here on the TML, of course.

I\'ve sent the system to Marc for his comments.  It is my hope that he 
adopts it for the revised edition of T4, but I haven\'t heard back 
from him yet.

Kenneth.

	I can attest from personal experience that a chain mail glove
would prove invaluable, since after you grab your opponents sword
they have a tendency to yank it back.  This can result in cutting
your fingers to the bone (and what a bloody mess..).

	The computer game XCOM has an ability similar to this.  The soldiers are
wearing helmets that connect to a tactical display system.  If one soldier 
can see a target, all others can attempt to fire upon it even if it\'s out
of
visual range.  This is useful when you run into aliens with very heavy
armor,
you can engage them before they have much firing accuracy themselves.

Well, the first time you do it, someone politely tells you, and often gives
you instructions on how to switch it off.  You comply, and all is well.

Then someone else tells you that you\'ve started attaching winmail.dat\'s
again, and politely asks you to turn them off.  You scratch your head,
double-check the settings and wonder why it\'s started up again.  You then
send test messages to friends, asking if they can see any attachments,
binaries, winmail.dat\'s or anything else.  "No", they all reply.  OK, all
must be well.

So you send a message to another list, where someone politely asks you to
stop sending attachments.  At this point (after hoovering up the hair
you\'ve just pulled out), you do a little research on the web, read through
the sections on how to get rid of winmail.dat and find the following note
at the end:

"Note: Either of these methods should work for most users, but sometimes
nothing seems to work - yet another brilliant design strategy by Microsoft.
If you plan to be sending lots of internet email, you should seriously
consider using a mail program more suited to the task, such as Eudora. "

After re-plastering the wall, (where you\'ve been hitting it with your
head), you download Eudor Light 3.0 and breathe a long sigh of relief.
Surely all must be well now.

Then, and this is an optional extra reserved for only the *most* foolish
and ignorant, you send a message to a mailing list saying that all is well,
and cut and paste a couple of lines of a winmail.dat onto the end as a sort
of "joke".  Boy do you feel foolish and sheepish (and other embarrasing
\'ish\'es) for doing that when people tell you that their mail reader
interpreted it as an attachment :-(.


Anyway, try to be nice to those people that send winmail.dat\'s at the end
of their messages for the first couple of times.  Point them to
http://www.creativelement.com/win95ann for instructions on how to turn the
settings off.  If they still persist, then, and only then, haul out the
relativistic rocks.


Cheers,
Liam

be a pro at something (a good ballpark level, anyway)...

For clarity:

(Automatic)
Easy
Average
Difficult
Formidable
Staggering
Impossible
(NOTpossible (impossible was taken :-)

Now, take a task that you wan to be a "professional" one.  Is this
something that somebody with no skill would have no chance at all of
doing (the task is time-limited, so studying up isn\'t an option)?
If no, set the no-skill level at Notpossible.  Reduce the Difficulty Level
by 1 for each skill level (count skill-0).

So:

Skill   Task Diff.
Level   Level
- ----   ----
none    Not possible
0       Impossible
1       Staggering
2       Formidable
3       Difficult
4       Average
5       Easy
6+      Automatic (?)

The roll would be made (under current T4, say) at Attribute+skill.

I guess a professional would be 4 in this scheme, 3 would be
somebody in training to be a professional.  This gives a benchmark
task level for a given skill vs. people at large.

To use this, you need only think about the level at which somebody
with no training would see the task at hand.  In the society of
traveller, computers would be such a part of life that some
operation involving doing a literature search would be easy for
everybody (call the general populace of a sufficiently high-tech
world to be minimum skill-0).  So, to set the task for a computer
search (listed skill is Computer):

Skill   Task Diff.
Level   Level
- ----   ----
none    Difficult
0       Average
1       Easy
2+      Automatic

Bump it up or down based on how tricky the search is.

This works regardless of the system you choose to use, BTW, and even
seems to work for T4 as is.  It also helps me think of task levels
on the fly----"How hard for somebody with no skill is this?"

Excuuuuse Me? Neither of my shields, are recycled stop signs, One of
them is 14 pounds, down from 16lbs. the other is 12lbs, and covers a
much smaller area.
My swords weigh in at 2 1/2 to 3lbs.
both of my steel hand & 1/2\'s weigh about that much.

Yup, not to mention the arm that is hanging out there in range, ( I HATE
taking arms but if that is all the target I have... ).

Uh I gotta mention a coupla things here...
A broadsword is an evolved club, most of its attacks are a hacking
motion.
A Rapier is an evloved knife, use it like a 4\' knife...
( this is an over simplification, of course but gets the idea accross ).

Whoa; Wait a minuite... 7kg?????

NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO

That\'s, lessee, uh, 15lbs. I do not know of any sword, unless a VERY heavy
Zwiehander, ( I know that\'s misspelled but my sourceses are not here).
that weighs THAT much, and that would NOT be used with a shield.
Mine weigh in at about 2 1/2 to 3 lbs.
Ask yourself... would you like to swing something like that fro even
five minuites, I have seen longer fights 15 to 20 min.
I do not remember picking up ANY sabre that is in the 5 lb range, would
defete its purpose, really... :-)

Ok now, yes if the shield use is clumsy - then you probably have a
novice on your hands, most of us use hooks and presses as a follow up to
the block, so it is not so easy for the opponet to notice... :-)
Well remember he is not going to stand in one place for you to run
around him, if he does he is again a novice. On the feint...
If he is a novice he probably wouldn\'t even notice, some one who has
seen this weapon and even has handled one has a better idea fo what you
can do so you might be able to fake him out of his shorts...
Know what I do when that happens?
Move!
Not neccessarly away, why? When you can avoid it moving into it... :-)
Now Mr. Barbarian is probably not in his shorts...
A sabre weiging in at 1 1/2 to 2lbs, and sharp to boot is going to have
a problem getting through the armor, sabres and especially Rapiers where
not designed for use against armor - the rapier was the renessance
gentileman\'s side arm and was to be used against non armored opponets,
for the most part they where not wepons of war, Yes they where carried
by officers, and is like the .45 M1911 A1, in the modern times.

Proper distance? As soon as I notice that my opponet wants distance
where do you think I want to be? As a friend of mine used to say, " if
you can count the holes in his visor you are to far away..." :-)
Worked for him...
What do you mean by "modern composite blade"? Chrom Moly steel for

Excuuuuuuuse Me...
Uh I can remember the night I fought one of our better fighters and took
him out and he said, "Nice fake!" and I said "Hungh?" ( one of my witter
nights. :-) ), I did not fake.
I had, but had not noticed I was doing it...
So the point of this is EVEN with Broadswords we use fakes, fients, and
misdirection, I try never to be convinced that an attack cannot be
altered, there are some points that physics will not allow the change
with out weakining the blow to much.

Ah here ist is I KNEW I\'d foamed at the mouth for a reason...

I\'LL HIT you while you are spending the time in a useless exercise, if
it is not a threat I WILL swing.
Blinds himself with what the shield, I have a friend who is uh
Vertically challenged, who takes great delight in hiding behind your
shield and trying to rip you kidneys out...
I KNOW shes back there some where so I try to hit her in the back of the
head... There IS a technique to do this. ;-)
I also use the deflection parry, as well as a direct blow to the
opponets sword, both techniques are usefull...

I have seen the problems that fencers and kendo folks have dealing with
the foreign concept of that counter, uh board on the arm, both on their
arm and more to the point, on the opponet, the biggest problem seems to
be getting the sword back out in a way that makes it usefull.

Xcuse me? see rant above about broadswords being evloved clubs, you do
not Lunge with one - useless move, which only will result in your
exposure to your opponet, You WANT the shield in front and your sword
arm back in order for it to have the power neccessary to penitrate
armor...
Yessss you can\'t throw a blow through your own shield, you can however
start your blow from behind your shield and move it as the blow passes
through, this does two things, usually the opponet does not see it start
so he has less time to react to it, and keeps you covered longer.
We have tracked sword tips at about 200 - 250 miles an hour... You will
have a speed and mobility advantage, smaller that you think.

If Mr. Noble is going to take the time to look at his watch He IS DOA.
that is PERIOD.
unless of course it is a hidden lazer pistole... :-)

Mr. Barbarian has a mad on for some reason and he is not going to wait
for Mr. Noble to get ready, and if you look away from your opponet you
deserve what you get...
Ok here is another thing: Mr. Barbarian has spent his life with his
sword, axe, mace and the other implments of destruction, that is what he
does it is his life, he is going to have a d***** good idea fo what cam
and can\'t be done with weapons...
He also is used to his armor, it will not bother him at all.
AND for my next point... :-)
The rapier and the sabre did not become popular due to them being the
most devistating weapon on the block, the dieing out of armor was mostly
to blame, and that was caused by several reasons:
1) economic, Armor is EXPENSIVE, for what it costs to put an armored man
in the field you could feild 20 equiped with muskets.
2) Firearms... Armorers found that you could make armor that was proof
against arrows, or bullets, but not both and be practicle.
( even more expensive... )
I haven\'t even gone into the other weapon forms such as pole arms...

But even dumbots are capable of being used by the virus.  Maybe each
dumbot won\'t be a independent creature, but they are stilled controlled
by a master bot which is sentient.  So instead of a dozen different
janitorial robots chasing you around your house, you have 12 perfectly
coordinated robots acting with one mind chasing you. Seems a bit nastier.

I like the idea, that the Virus acts a bit differently because of the
different computer systems.  

Another difference between Imperial and K\'Kree space, is that the
Imperials put computers in everything, from elevators to airrafts.  I
got the feeling that the K\'Kree didn\'t bother automating so much of
their systems.  Is this right?, if so, it will help your point that the
effects of the Collapse are less.  

So here is how I see it. Virus hits the 2K Worlds, it easily takes over
most of the robots it encounters, due to their interconnectivaty and
the K\'Kree\'s low level of sophestication.  The Virus can also can
infect many devices like ships, but can not take over complete control,
because the K\'Kree haven\'t bothered to automate their ships. (Much like
the RC does in 1200)   Virus would probably be able to destroy or
shutdown the part that it does infect, but not suicide and take out
lots of K\'Kree with in.  The virus infected ship won\'t be able to blow
itself up, or dive into the planet\'s surface, just burn out the
motherboard of the main computer.   

This would result in, a general lowering of technology, because lots of
devices had key components burn themselves out, but the Virus wasn\'t
able to cause massive amounts of carnage like it did everywhere else. 
Also don\'t the K\'Kree live on planets where they don\'t need massive
life support systems.  So the K\'Kree would be left at a lower technolgy
level, but mostly intact.  There would also be large numbers of packs
of killer robots running around on these planets.  
In space there would be very few Vampire ships, only the occasionally
ship which the Virus was able to infect every system.  You might get
ships, where different systems are controlled by different Virus
strains, and they have to cooperate to operate the ship.  Their orders
would be carried back and forth by robots or captive K\'Kree slaves.  

I don\'t think the K\'Kree would be able to maintain a interstellar
government, but would break up into lots of smaller planetary governments.  

How do the K\'Kree treat their minor races, are they allowed to own
ships, colonize the planets K\'Kree don\'t like, do they use more automation?

What do you think of that?

Why towards the 2000 worlds instead of somewhere else, I\'d think they
would migrate away from the Federation, in any direction.  Its not a
bad idea, I just wanted more of a reason.

Yeah, after I sent that in, I was thinking about this, you are right, I

Borg, resistance is futile, you will be assimilated and eat grass"  :)

I have never heard of anyone punching a fist, foot or head though a piece 
of steel.  I seen bricks and wood broken, but when the brick is part of a

worry about martial arts attacks unless the attacker were wearing battle

What I used is the map in Survival Margin (SM) on page 85. The Virus
stopped with help of Domain of Deneb to create a buffer zone. AS I
decided at one time that Thoengling Empire was Imperial friendly
welcomed the help from Deneb. Zhodani and the Empire did also pressure
Thirz Empire (a Zhodani friendly state) and Society of Equals to end
their disputes so that a firmer border could be established against
the Virus.

The Vargr lack of coordination a cooperation in large groups was the
main reason for the collapse of most of Vargr space. One thing that
did help, when the Virus was finaly brought to a halt was the
information structure in vargr space. As most compueters are
incompatible, information is exchanged in print or microfilm.

	What I think is that the stat is fundamentally misconceived.
Basically,character systems are about mapping human attributes and
abilities onto paper.  Some aspects of being a human are innate, basic to
being a human being, whereas others are acquired culturally (i.e. learned).

	Now, what is the education process that this EDU stat is supposed
to represent? People go to school or through another learning process, and
acquire skills and knowledges.  In a system like T4, this can be reflected
extremely well through... adding skills to the character.  Education as an
attribute, being used to compound skills acquired by education in a task
roll, really strikes me as not making much sense.  The basic problem
solving process, so far as I conceive of it, involves using intelligence to
apply acquired skills and knowledges to the situation.  Two individuals of
equal intelligence and equal skill/knowledge on a topic ought to, IMHO,
have the same target number, irrespective of numbers of years of
schooling...

	I think that the next time I run a Traveller campaign, I\'m going to
mess with the attributes, and try and come up with something a little bit
more conceptually elegant.

I do own FS, as well as every other T4 supplement, so I am not trying to
deny anyone fair profit from the maps, I just want to get maps more suited

I also am planning on writing some auto scavengers to go through the data
and generate new law levels as well as eliminating many of the worlds with
reasonable tech and populations between 1 and 1 million people.  I just do
not think those are long term stable, and thus should be placed carefully.

Clearly, these changes are not canon, but I want to have a set of numbers

for sticking too long to the borders given in FS.  They liked the M0
borders a bit more.

You have a good point.  My top three adventures were:

1.  The Traveller adventure was one of the most detail rich and interesting
adventures I ran.

2.  Knightfall was by far the best organized and easiest to run adventure I
saw in any Traveller incarnation.  The nugget/flow chart approach is very
slick, and a variant should be in the back of every designer\'s mind.

3.  Twilight\'s peak.  Yes, it is hokey in some ways (specifically, any
Ancient adventure is going to be a bit hokey.  I and my players still love
them.), and it is short compared with the other two, but it has a lot of
playability that many other Traveller adventures did not have.  After going
away from it, the players spent months trying to unravel the various loose
ends this one brought up, like what, exactly, the various villains were up
to, and why the various hints to the Octagon still existed.  Also, were
they going to make a profit off the anti matter battery (nobody in three
groups has managed it), and the two stepping disks (all three found a way
to turn those into great wealth)...

I like that.  IN worlds are resource poor because their industries are
gobbling the local resources at a tremendous rate.  This might justify
shuttling resources in on a starship, which is rarely profitable.  NI
worlds are not using local resources as fast as they can be dug up, so
there is a surplus which might be to a player\'s benefit.

In the same vein - in my new and improved sector maps, I am making up trade
codes based entirely on allocations of people, and ignoring the UPP.
(except, of course, for WA, DE, VA, BA, and so on.)  Might it make sense,
then, to create a new trade code, such as "RE" for resource rich and "NR"
for resource poor.  These worlds would give bonuses/minuses for resources,
and perhaps would affect the IN/NI ratings, or at least would indicate
whether or not there was thriving trade in resources.

I understand that Pocket Empires is going to have an expanded UWP that
includes the ratings of the individual planet in various area, including
resources.  I expect it is going to look a lot like the expanded tech level
UWP.  Perhaps this could be somehow related.  I am looking forward to this
supplement.

Thank you for the reply.  This is fun - the many positive and negative
comments have made me rethink major parts of what I wrote.  The unexamined

	There is no mass, cost or power requirement for fuel tankage, other than
the (obvious) volume and mass of the fuel itself. Thus, 1,400 cubic meters
of liquid hydrogen masses 100 tonnes and requires 1,400 cubic meters of
volume.

One thing always bothered me about this scenario:
Why did the Octagon Society build their shelter right on top of an Ancient
site?  I suppose it could be coincidental, but it seems very unlikely.

Hello Eric, on 11 Mar you said:

   Well, it may not be mentioned explicitly, but standard Fuel tankage is 
free, takes no power, no surface area and has no mass. It is assumed to be 
included in the internal structure. The volume will, of course, be the 
amount of fuel you want to store. The mass, when loaded, is the mass of the 
fuel. 

Hope that helps,
James Dempsey.

	A lot of "breaking techniques" are for demonstration.  Grappling
and throwing styles were applied against people who were well armoured in
the past.  Striking styles had other methods of dealing with armoured
opponents (weapons, anyone?).

	Paranoia Press had a martial arts skill that they published in the
Scouts and Assassins book, as well as one or two others.  Someone should
post it for feedback.

	Assembly of hi-tech goods is only a rather minor export of 
undeveloped countries in the modern world.  Most of the clothing, shoes, 
toys, and other such consumer goods that we use every day are produced in 
very poor and low-tech countries like China, Egypt, and India.  The 
production of textiles, for instance, is low-tech and very labor 
intensive.  Low-tech worlds in the Imperium will likely produce similar 
goods.

	No, they can\'t afford a car, but they can and will spend money on 
Coke.  A woman I know from Uzbekistan was telling just the other day how 
they flew a plane-load of coke into her village and people were spending 
a weeks wages for a six-pack.

	I think this is where you\'ve made your mistake.  Individuals will 
not be the principle customers of off-world trade.  Corporations and 
governments will.  Any world with a decent financial system will 
recognize the economic sense of buying things that will pay back their 
purchase price many times over in increased efficiency.  Communication, 
transportation, power generation, machine tools, etc. will all be very 
attractive purchases. Anyone who can scrape the money together will want 
to invest in these goods.

	I\'m not sure I understand your point here.  Hi-tech worlds will 
sell their output to whoever can pay the most.  Logically, the people 
that will pay the most will be those who can put those goods to the best 
use.  For many TL-12 goods, the largest market will be Sylea itself.  
This does not mean that low-tech worlds will not be a market for these 
goods, even if only a small market.
	The other question I believe you are raising is whether low-tech 
worlds will have something the Imperial traders want in return for their 
goods.  Raw materials are an obvious option, but if the world lacks even 
these, then some trade development may be in order.  Explain to the 
local business people that investing in the shoe factory the plans and 
parts to which you would be happy to sell them on credit would allow them 
produce a good marketable on Sylea.  With something worth trading, they 
could buy hi-tech Sylean goods which you would also be happy to sell 
them, all assuming of course, that they sign a 10-year exclusive trade 
contract with you.

By Jove, I think he\'s got it! ;->

I use INT as a PC\'s raw intellegence, perception and quickwitedness. I use
EDU as a different mode of intellegence...the PC\'s scholarly abilities, the
ability to handle the sort of skills you learn in a school or from a book. 
(I\'d be happy to change the name from EDU to REAsoning or SCHolarship.)  I
add WILL..for willpower, and CHArisma for a PC\'s social intellegence.

	My mail reader & operating system (Netscape 3.0 under Windows 95) was
so confused over whether or not it was an attachment that it would not
let me read the rest of the digest, could not open it, could not save
it, would not let me delete it & generally gave me grief. :(  If anyone
is willing could someone please delete those lines & send me Digest

the same unreadable form.

What size of a relativistic 0.1 c rock do you think we need to use to

1- Travelling : As the contragrav lifters technology exists, and require
only MW, it is easy for starships to land on planets. The fuel enxpenditure
can be very small.

2- Trading : As for travelling, orbital bases don\'t reduces costs, instead
they add some handling of cargos.

3- Observation : this is the only point i see, because the atmosphere of
the planet doesn\'t interfere (or less) with the detections devices, the
resolution and precision of observation should be better from orbital
stations than from the ground of planets.

4- Military defenses : Orbital stations have more weak points than ground
bases. They will do easy targets, they are easy to detect and no very
bulky. This will cost much more money to have the same defensive
effectiveness than a ground base. Some big installations would be harder to
build. May be the observation aspects would be interesting. But small
drones or satellites could do the job.

5- Research : Except the observation point, orbital stations won\'t be very
usfull. They might be expensive to build and would be quite static. A
converted spaceship or starship would be more flexible and easier to build.

6- Living : Life support is expensive, food would require to be imported,
space farming would be more expensive. Enclosed life would be harder to
support for people, there would be more possibilites for hobby (sports ans
so on), so the effective volme would be reduced. 


Does anyone have any opinion on this subject ?

TITLE	      : SENSOR RULES FOR TRAVELLER
By	      : Roger Myhre


PURPOSE
- ----
To simplify the sensor rules in Traveller. Not that I feel it is =
necessary, but due to the fact that many people have difficulties with =
dealing with how the rules are written. As an old sensor operator from =
the Royal Norwegian Navy, I can say that the rules presented in BL is a =
very simplified model of the real thing. I will try to make the things a =
bit more realistic, but not more difficult to use.

Some may react to how easy there is to detect things in with these rules,=
 but consider this. Where do you hide in space? As on a planet there are =
no clouds to hide the IR signature behind. Neither is there a horizon to =
duck under.  Just a wast stretch of nothingness.


CONVERSIONS
- ----
DIFFICULTY MODIFIERS
As the rules are meant to be used with several types incarnation to =
Traveller, I will use a generic system that should fit into MT task =
system and the TNE task system. As I haven\'t studied the T4 system too =
well I think you\'ll have to tweak the system a bit to make it fit. CT I =
have never used or owned so I don\'t know how the system will fare there.

Generally when there is positive numbers it will make the task simpler =
and vice versa. In TNE add the modifier to the asset before the roll. In =
MT it is a straight DM with a max of eight in either positive or negative=
 numbers. In T4 positive numbers are added to the skill before the roll, =
and negative numbers subtracted.

DIFFICULTY LEVEL
In all types of Traveller the difficulty is at Difficult level. In MT =
that is a target number of 11. In TNE it is asset times one. And in T4 it=
 is 2.5D against asset.


PROCEDURES
- ----
DECLARATION PHASE
All units declare if they will go active or passive this turn. They do =
also declare what kind of sensors they will be using if any. If there is =
several players combating each other this is done secretly. Before any =
units can be targeted they have to be detected. As BL assumes everyone is=
 sort of detected, but not properly pin pointed and identified. That\'s =
why we use the green blobs at the start of the BL game.

DM CALCULATION
The scanning unit adds up his DMs. The defending unit add up his. The =
defending DMs are then subtracted from the attacking players (or added if=
 the defender got positive DMs)

ACTIVE SENSOR SCANS
Determine the rangeband of the sensor the target are in. Find the =
signature DM from the defending craft and add them up (or subtract)
Example: An active sensor tries to detect a bogey at medium range. This =
gives a DM of +5. The defending craft is a 200 ton SL needle crafts with =
EMM. This gives a defending DM of 0. (0+1+0-1). This gives the attacking =
scanning unit a DM of 5.

ACTIVE SENSOR AGAINST JAMMING
The procedure is the same as the procedure above, but subtract the Jammer=
 DM. To improve the chances of jamming the jamming player may roll a =
difficult task. On a success the jammer may add an additional -2. =
Additional modification is the TL difference. This modification is added =
or subtracted from the jamming task roll.

PASSIVE SCANNING AGAINST ACTIVE SENSOR
Add the active sensor DM to the passive sensor DM and add 5.
Example: An active sensor got a short range of 5 while a passive sensor =
got a short range of 3. The units are 15 hexes apart. This is at Extreme =
range for the passive sensor, which gives a -10. A range of 15 is medium =
range of the active sensor which is a strength of 0. Adding these two =
numbers together gives a DM of -10. Then the special DM of plus 5 is =
added giving a total of -5.

Sensing against jamming sources uses the same procedure, just invert the =
jamming table. Short range is a signal strength of 15 and so on.

PASSIVE SENSOR AGAINST IR SIGNATURE.
Add the passive sensor DM to the crafts IR signature. Remember to modify =
the IR signature depending on Acceleration, direction and so on.

PASSIVE EMS SCANNING
If the passive sensor is an EMS sensor use the signature that gives the =
best detection chance. All other scans just gives supplemental =
information that can help identify the craft.

DENSITOMETER SCANS
=46ind the gravity signature of the scanned craft. This signature is the =
signature strength of the first hex (the hex the craft occupy). The DM is=
 halved for every hex from the scanned unit to the scanning unit. Round =
to nearest whole number. When you reach 1 the next hex it will be 0. From=
 there on double the numbers from -1. Detection is considered automatic =
far as the numbers are 2 or more in the gravity signature.

Example. A 2430ton craft has a signature of 49 at the adjacent it is 25 =
and then 13 and then 7, 4, 2, 1, 0 at the eighth hex.

Streamlining affects the signature as following: USL +3, AF and SL +0 EMM=
 gives -1

IR SIGNATURE
IR signature is from the crafts powerplant and maneuver drive. The =
signature of the powerplant is calculated like this: square root of MW =
output divided on 10. Round to nearest whole number. It is then adjusted =
according to drive. Heplar and Fusion rocket =3D2 per G of acceleration =
when the plume is facing the scanning unit. 1 per two G when away. From =
the side there is 1 per G. Thrusters gives +1 if facing scanning unit. =
EMM gives -2. Running at minimum power gives additional -5

DENSITOMETER SENSING
This will only give general direction (+/-5 degrees) and approximate =
movement direction. Range for fire resolution must be acquired with other=
 sensors. The signature is calculated like this: Square root of weight of=
 craft + 2 if using G compensators + 2 per G if using Thrusters. Round to=
 nearest whole number. Detection is considered to be automatic if the =
gravity signature is 2 or more. A task roll is necessary if the signature=
 drops below 2 or if there is a planet in the same direction or close to =
the craft.

UCP LISTING
- ----
WHY?
So that there are no need to calculate all the data for each time a =
starship encounter is taking place.

=46ORMAT
It should be placed in a box at the top of the sheet/page where the UCP =
is listed.
Example:
RCS   IR         Gravitic  Target size DM
 +3   3(2-1-1/2)    32      See below

This example is a ship with Heplar drive. The IR section list the =
Powerplant IR signature outside the parenthesis, and the drive signature =
inside the parenthesis. The format is as following: Aft, Side and then =
Front per acceleration gee. So if the craft is scanned from behind while =
it accelerates 2gee the scanning unit gets a modification of 7 (3+4).

Target size DM is handled as the rules states in the different Traveller =
version.

ADVANCED RULES
- ----
2 TYPES OF JAMMIING
There is basically ways to jam a sensor. Sensor degration and deception. =
The first is rather simple. Basically there is only to send out enough =
noice to blanket out the screen of the opponent. The draw back with this =
is that the enemy knows that he\'s being jammed and can change frequencies=
 or elect to home in on the noise. Deception jamming is far more =
difficult. It requires the jamming unit to know what kind of a sensor the=
 opponent is using , frequencies, procedures and so on. The main goal =
with deception jamming is to make the opponent believe that the enemy =
comes from another direction. Or diverts interceptor, missiles or laser =
fire against fictive target.
A unit that is targeted by a director beam can feed the beem false =
information making the targetting sensor believing that the target is =
following a certain course.=20

PROCEDURE
Use the rules mentioned above for noise jamming. For deception jamming =
the jamming player states which unit will do the jamming. If the unit has=
 several jammers each jammer may jam a seperate target. The jamming =
player then states which target he wish to jam and what kind of effect he=
 wants to have. And where he wants the false echos to appear on the map. =
However this should be within the same hex arc as the jamming unit of the=
 target.

The Jamming player then rolls a difficult opposed task according to the =
respective Traveller rules. A success allows the player to place 4 false =
targets on the map. To keep up with the jamming for the next turn a new =
task must be rolled. This time the difficulty is routine/average. On a =
failure 2 false targets are removed from play. On a spectacular failure =
all false targets by that unit is removed. The clue is that the opposing =
player must not know what is the real targets or false targets.=20

=46alse targets may be moved on the board for each movement phase. There =
are no limits to how they move or maneuver, but if the movements are too =
obvious (ie accelerating incredebly fast or turns on a dime) the opponent=
 may guess that the targets are false.
The best way to defend against this type of jamming is to "detect" the =
false tracks with a passive sensor. they will not be tricked by deception=
 jamming, as the false tracks are not visible in the visual spectrum or =
the IR spectrum. However the defending player may only try to detect one =
false target a turn per passive sensor.

MASKING MISSILES
Deception jamming may be used to mask missile attacks. Four false =
missiles may follow a few in to a target to increase their survivability =
when attacking a starship. The target that must defend against these =
missiles before they hit, must prior to firing any anti missiles weapons,=
 state which targets he fires at.

        Maybe. And maybe IG should check the TML on it. I would like to

book I am citing in the article about Geonee biology <g>.

        It\'s a theory, but it seems more probable that the Syleans PRETEND

        HEY!. Ooops, sorry, but it does not work. I don\'t recall the exact
dates, but the Neanderthal were on Earth around -150,000 and -50,000 or
something like that. Definitively, there were NO neanderthals around here on
- -300,000, so there is NO WAY the Ancients could took a bunch of them to the

        Yes, right. It\'s merely aesthetics: IMHO, the Darrian-Aslan is a

        Well, as long as this TML thread goes on and IG/Marc is reading it,
good ideas could be worth the posting. And you could be writing this things,
after all.. there are several publishers around there. I also have a job
that is not RPG, but I will eventually finish a Geonee sourcebook (even if

        I think I\'ve already heard something about Vargr/K\'kree wars in the

(Trimmed again)									        ----Speaking as a Wargamer the advantages
of orbital stations for planetary defence are the following:-1/You have
a lot less chance of collateral damage if your defences are in space and
thus away from the civilian cities on the ground.2/It makes the civvies
who pay the taxes that pay your wages feel safer(Therefore they don`t
grumble too much when you up military spending).3/You do indeed have a
better observation horizon than you would have if you were based on a
planet.4/If the stations crew is raised from the planet "below" they
will fight harder than normal to protect their friends and family on the
planet.5/It lets COACC annoy the Navy by having forces in space(and
inter-service rivalry IS the lifeblood of the military).

Nothing\'s wrong with _biology_ -- that won\'t change within historical
time.  But I suspect your players would gripe strongly if you tried to
hand them a millenium-old text on Geonee culture, society, government, and
history.  That\'s the part that gets out of date, and which an "early"
author deprives us of for "later" eras.

Possibly.  But I think having them be a minor race is more interesting. :-)

I\'ve now been thoroughly informed that the Acheron couldn\'t be of Neanderthal
descent.  I\'ll go flake some flint in penance.  And research Homo erectus
while I\'m at it.

But Darrians are a natural to include there, since they\'re a "classic" and
already have published info (re: cheap reprint opportunity).

You can either build a military base away from civilian area

They would feel as safe as if the base were away from their area. And they

Drones can do job cheaper. Imagine 10 or 20 drones driven by Maser or Laser
commo. Doesn\'t seems to bad. Those drones could be dispached around the
planet and even far away from orbits.

You know, I finally found a solution to this problem, let them do it.  I
no longer ask things like "are you *sure* you want to fire your auto GL at

I just let them, and chuckle at the results.

Lost a whole campaign in this fashion (it was getting too silly anyway).

Of course, you need to have spare characters available ahead of time, to
prevent play from slowing down.

	Nasty surface weather conditions, Type A hyd planets, Balkanized
planets at war with each other, nasty D and E type governments who want to
prevent all contact by traders with the general populace. How about a
planetary population that decided to put all the dirty polluting industry
in orbit, so they could enjoy thir planet? How about a really nasty,

lanthanum ore

	True, to a point. All you really have to do is drop it, so to

	Here is where you actually break down. Yes, observations from
orbit are much clearer than from surface based observatories, but stations
in the outer portions of the planetary system are even better. An orbital
observatory in Pluto\'s orbit, for example would be even better.

	IF you\'re defending against threats coming from outside. Threats
originating on-planet, however have that gravity well disadvantage, and a
station large enough to have the CCI personell onboard rather than a
comm-link away, will be more efficient.

	Why? Why use a perfectly good starship, and turn it into a
station? All you need is essentially, a hull, a powerplant and life
support. This way you can hang all sorts of things off the hull that you
don\'t need to worry about acceleration forces, unbalancing the system,
etc.

	Ahh, now you\'re thinking in TL-7 terms. This ain\'t the 20th
century, Bubba, it\'s the 31st!! Why couldn\'t you build a 20-30 km long
habitat? All you need is the materials, and any culture that has mastered
spaceflight as well as the third imperium has (I mean, look...a common
mode of transprtation, the air raft, has the capability of reaching
orbit!) easily has the capability to do this. Hell, as Gerry O\'Neill
pointed out many years ago, even at TL-7/8 it is not technology so much as
political will preventing us from doing this. 

	Space is _cheap_ in space, especially given that you have
essentially unlimited energy.

	At this point, an orbital facility starts looking less like a
space station than a city in terms of support. Look at any large modern
city...Paris for instance. Does Paris grow all it\'s food? _Any_ of it\'s
food?? What about waste disposal?  Transport? How does the food get into
Paris...in trucks.

	 Where does your water come from? Great hulking treatment plants
I\'ll wager. Finally, at the rate we\'re going, we ARE going to have to
start importing air to some of our big cities (Chewed on the air in
Athens, or Mexico City lately? Air can be generated...remember we have
lots of cheap energy...get Oxygen out of rocks.

Which would result in many campaigns becoming "The Fugitive" for minor
infractions such as property damage, possession of illegal firearms (i.e.
automatic weapons) and other such sillinessess.  In the Imperium that we
are using this is conveniently not the case.  The Imperium will only
extradite or prosecute criminals for;

Murder
Uncompensated property damage over Cr 500
Damage to a world\'s economic capability
Damage to a world\'s ecological stability
Possession of certain forbidden items (Nukes, Biological weapons, BeeGees
	recordings) which they deem excessively destructive.
Doing anything nasty or forbidden on or in an Imperial Facility
	(Navy/Scout base, Imperial Museum, etc.)
Entering Red Zones

Basically, the idea is to not spend a lot of Imperial time and money
chasing down kids on joyrides.  This will not prevent individual worlds
from entering into individual extradition treaties with other Imperial
member worlds, but that falls under the category of "internal affairs" as
far as the Imperium is concerned.

And who, in their right mind, would enter into an extradition treaty with
a truly fanatic religous dictatorship like Pysadi? 

I mean, really the idea is to prevent "The Fugitive" campaigns when the
boys find it necessary to break one of their number out of jail, right?
and what\'s a museum display case or two really worth anyway?

Yes, and then its either large and immobile (one good nuke...) or mobile
but too small to be effective.  An orbital station can be large, mobile,
well-supplied, and well-defended.  This also means that the orbital station
acts as a forward base, so any attacker will have to attend to it first
(find it, assess it, neutralize it) before going on to the rest of the
planet.  This could cost you the station itself, but its sacrifice could
delay things enough to give you a better sense of the enemy\'s strength and
tactics, potentially saving you the planet.

Some drone "bases" are going to be useful, no doubt.  But I would not bet
the defense of my planet on these as "hard points" -- an orbital station is
a citadel which the enemy simply cannot ignore if they wish to take the
planet.


One other remark: Not all orbital stations should be in close orbit around
a planet.  Some would no doubt be hidden near gas giants and even in the
cometary shield.  Putting a strong defensive base out there may cost you a
bit of time getting back in-system, but it gives you a _very_ strong base
that is either far forward or behind the enemy, either of which is good for
defending the planet.

On an Armored opponent I think the best thing would be to keep her or him
off his/her feet (I\'m just gonna use \'her\' from now on - you know what I
mean).

When I took Jiu-jitsu we incorporated a lot of \'street techniques\' (we
were in the south side of Chicago after all) which means when you\'re
throwing someone you look for a convenient brick wall or steel fence to
use as a "backdrop".  

The technique I imagine using on a BD opponent is
putting my right ankle behind her right ankle (from facing positions) and
pushing upwards on the chin.  At that point something metallic and pointy
would be helpful as an aiming point.

note; no lifting or balancing the opponent on your hip, there\'s plenty of
techniques that just knock people down that work really well vs. two
legged opponents and don\'t require you to be able to bench press 200 lbs.

But how many people are really going to go up
against a BD opponent with their hands?

   I checked up on my faulty memory; one out of three ain\'t so good. 
   The human species which lived at the same time as Homo erectus were
   H. heidelbergensis, H. ergaster, and, of course, H. sapiens; other as
   yet unknown species are also possible and maybe even probable.  Homo
   rudolfensis, it turns out, died off 1.5 million years ago, and so is
   not fodder for ancient transport. I was /way/ off base about afarensis,
   which was not a human species at all, but an australopithecene. The
   famous "Lucy" skeleton was an A. afarensis; her kind died out over
   three million years ago.

   I always wondered about that too. I figure that the guy who founded
   the society (I forget his name), who came back as a "changed man"
   from being stranded on Beck\'s World, had some sort of "conversion"
   to a devotion to the ancients, and built some of his octogons over
   ancient sites which he somehow knew about from his stay on Beck\'s
   World.

   I\'d be interested in any insights Marc could give.

I\'m not conviced that the surface weather is a problem for travelling,
providing that you have high technology (Imaging EMS, and so on). The
electonically compensated flight control might be very easy in all the
weather types. 
You could have dedicated grounded startports which are un connected to the
balkanized government. And if the balkanized government don\'t want to have
a ground base, i don\'t know why they would want an orbital base. And if you
don\'t care about their opinion, i don\'t know what you\'ll do with you
orbital base.

I wouldn\'t want to have my cargo dropped with parachutes or other antigrav
thing. Even though, you don\'t need au orbital station to do this dropping.
Usually you have to dock your ship, open the cargo hatch and carry out all
the containers. I don\'t have seen many rocket assisted droppable contaners
carried by freighter.

That\'s why mutiple dispatched sensor drones can do better job than a single
orbital station. 
And much cheaper

Techically, with the Contragrav techno, the gravity well has no effect on
such vehicles.

Because you could use this starship to make observations anywhere, in the
system and out of the system too.

With contragrav, transportation is not the problem. But grav vehicle are
expensive 5 to 10 time more expensive than a high speed truck. I think that
any civilation would take the simplier (and so cheaper) way live and
produce materials. this is a question of efficiency. People use technology
when they really need it, ie: i wouldn\'t buy a VCR if i don\'t want to watch
vidio tapes. And i wouldn\'t buy one if my girl friend already have one.

I totally disagree with _cheap_. Have you seen the price of the life

base.

Sure, you would have some huge open deck, protected by special glasses,
which would cost much more money than ground facilites.
And food is cheaper if you have it near from you (where it is produced). In
Paris food and flats are expensive... I personnaly live in Paris because
i\'ve no choice for the moment.

I agree with you, but this seems to be not reasonnable. Usually, when
people spend more money, it\'s because they want to have 
     - more fun or
     - more efficiency
I\'m not sure that orbital station is in either of this cases.

But OTOH, if the virtual orbital station people spend tremendous amount of
money to build a orbital sation, _I_ will have more fun. That\'s why i\'ve
several TL10 100.000Dt orbital satitions in my RCES campaign. The trouble
is that i cannot explain to my players why it\'s more interesting than
ground bases. The only reason I\'ve seen is _FUN_.

I have lots of difficulties to understand why orbital stations are interesting 

1- Travelling : As the contragrav lifters technology exists, and require
only MW, it is easy for starships to land on planets. The fuel enxpenditure
can be very small.

        This is partially true.  The starships that wish to land on a planet
must be streamlined, else they cannot make a stable reentry.  It\'s one thing
to be able to use contragravity to manage your velocity, but if the ship
isn\'t aerodynamic, it\'s going to tumble (or worse).  For large bulk
freighters and warships, this kind of modification can get expensive, I
believe.  (I\'m not much of a shipbuilder myself.)
        Also consider the problems associated with ship repair- it is a lot
easier (and less expensive) to perform large scale repairs/overhaul in
zero-g (course, if you drop your wrench, you can\'t very well go after it).
There is also less risk to fragile biospheres- consider the possibility of a
40,000 ton ore freighter inbound to your home planet, squawking on the GUARD
channel about a pirate attack.  Their avionics are out, maneuver control
portside is not responding, and their computer is damaged.  Would you feel
better having this ship attempt an orbital insertion or an atmospheric landing?
        Yet another option is security.  On more repressive worlds (for
those of you with long memories, think of a global Soviet Union), forcing
all travel to come through one or more orbital stations provides a choke
point to allow for careful screening/searches/extorting bribes from all
travellers coming and going.  Even on less repressive worlds, station
customs checks are a way of insuring that harmful plant or animal life (we
won\'t even get into bacteria) don\'t make it into their planet\'s environment,
and allows a chance to screen for wanted criminals, enemy agents, etc. 

2- Trading : As for travelling, orbital bases don\'t reduces costs, instead
they add some handling of cargos.

        What about cargoes that are simply passing through?  It would be
simpler to park them in orbit awaiting transfer than to take up valuable
real estate planetside.  Think of an orbital distribution hub- a company
pays to have cargoes transported to a central system, Regina, for instance,
and from there distributes the cargo to customers in other systems.  Again,
cargoes might also require inspection for harmful organisms, which would be
easier to do in orbit.  
        Also consider manufacturing concerns.  Some goods, like industrial
crystals or even chemical refineries, can be made with much more quality in
zero-g.  It seems that it would be cheaper to do the work in orbit, as
opposed to maintaining null fields planetside.

3- Observation : this is the only point i see, because the atmosphere of
the planet doesn\'t interfere (or less) with the detections devices, the
resolution and precision of observation should be better from orbital
stations than from the ground of planets.

        Quite right.  Think Hubble.  Sensors can see a lot farther without
atmospheric distortions.

4- Military defenses : Orbital stations have more weak points than ground
bases. They will do easy targets, they are easy to detect and no very
bulky. This will cost much more money to have the same defensive
effectiveness than a ground base. Some big installations would be harder to
build. May be the observation aspects would be interesting. But small
drones or satellites could do the job.

        I have to disagree a bit here.  Orbital bases are not any more
vulnerable than ground bases.  If an enemy fleet has enough firepower to
overcome a number of orbital stations, they have the capability to bombard a
ground installation just as well.  The advantages of orbitals are longer
detection ranges (as you pointed out above), longer effective range with
their weapons (they can reach out farther, and energy weapons don\'t have to
worry about atmospheric attenuation), and the ability to deny orbital
superiority to an attacking force.  A fleet cannot enter orbit and begin
assault drops with a number of well-armed stations sitting there.  The
stations have to be taken care of first, and that at the very least buys
time for the planet.  And orbital stations aren\'t necessarily pushovers-
imagine taking a small asteroid, tunnelling out an installation inside, and
setting it in high orbit.  They could have a few hundred feet of nickel-iron
for armor, and enough mass that they couldn\'t just be "nudged" out of position.

5- Research : Except the observation point, orbital stations won\'t be very
usfull. They might be expensive to build and would be quite static. A
converted spaceship or starship would be more flexible and easier to build.

        A converted ship would be an interesting idea for cash-strapped
frontier worlds... (Hey, all you incredible gearheads out there- how would
you make this work?  Turn a 10,000 ton broken-down ore hauler into a
serviceable orbital station?)  With respect to the research angle, who knows
what could be discovered up there in orbit?  That\'s why it\'s called
research.  New manufacturing processes, new industry, new medical procedures
(would surgery be easier or harder in zero-g?)- the list goes on and on.

6- Living : Life support is expensive, food would require to be imported,
space farming would be more expensive. Enclosed life would be harder to
support for people, there would be more possibilites for hobby (sports ans
so on), so the effective volme would be reduced. 

        I see stations more for the sake of commerce/academics/defense
rather than long-term living quarters.  There would be lots of transient
berths for stopovers, but the amount of permanent residents would be small,
and as you said earlier, with contragrav, shuttles could ferry foodstuffs on
a monthly basis.  Entertainment and hobby facilities would probably vary
according to the wealth/tech level of the system- perhaps employees do an
"orbital rotation" for a month or so, getting what amounts to overtime as
incentive for having a little less fun in the off hours.
        I\'m sure you\'ve gathered by now that I have a lot of fun using
orbitals in my campaigns.  It makes for a good amount of variety, and offers
challenges to players that they wouldn\'t have planetside.  (Hint: PGMP-14\'s
do NOT go well with station corridors.  This campaign will explosively
decompress in five seconds...)

When we were having the Six Flags over Sylea debate several months ago,

Sylea, and he said that Sylea was the home of a human minor race.  He
can correct me if I am wrong.

In my point of view, Orbital bases would be easy target. If they can move,
it will be a snail speed or  they were spaceships! ground facilities can
have defensive devices too (dampers, sandcasters and so on).

You\'ve misunderood my opinion. The drones are sensor drones only. This is
to correct the observation weakness of the ground facility. the defensive
and attecking force would be grounded.

Ah, I agree with you. I haven\'t thought about it. This is a point of

   I can think of only one good reason why orbital stations would be
   /common/. (There are lots of different reasons why they may be here
   or there.)  You need them to get cargoes and passengers off of and
   onto starships that do not have streamlining and cannot land on
   planets. Such starships are fairly common in the Traveller universe,
   due to their relatively low cost.  An orbital port need be little
   more than a waiting area for passengers, with lots of docking
   facilities for whatever kind of vessel that needs to interface with
   the local orbital shuttle buses. It may also include shops, cafes,
   and viewing ports, depending on its elegance. It will probably
   include some fairly sophisticated cargo-handling gear as well, but it
   needs very little in the way of life support. I can\'t imagine that
   anyone would /live/ in such a place; it would be like living in a bus
   station.

This is exactly how I use EDU.  When the task being attempted is a
"short"
or "quick" task, I base the roll on INT.  When it takes a slow
application
of "books" and formulas or examining things over time, I ask them to use
EDU.  When the task is mostly a personal action, I ask the player to use
SOC.  

For example:
	To notice as they\'re walking down the street a possible good deal:
		Difficult: INT/Trader
	To evaluate the merchandise to see if it\'s worth buying:
		Routine: EDU/Trader
	To bargin the seller even further down on the price:
		Opposed: SOC/Trader vs SOC/Broker

You can\'t mask a city or a large ground installation well enough to deter
attacks, and sandcasters and dampers won\'t do much against those 0.1c rocks
people keep talking about -- that\'s why deadfall ordinance is so useful.
OTOH, you could put a very low albedo asteroid in a high eccentric orbit
around a planet, making it _very_ difficult to find.  Planetary space is
*HUGE* when compared to the surface area of a planet.  An invading force
would not know (outside of significant espionage, which has its own
hazards) whether such an orbital base exists, how many of them there are,
what its/their armaments are, etc.  This uncertainty will signficantly slow
an invader, and make him use some of his precious resources trying to find
and defend against such stealthed bases.  This makes life much more
difficult for him than if he can do a quick mapping of a planet and nuke
anything that looks threatening.

Right, and once I\'ve detonated a dozen or so high-yield X-ray nukes in your
planet\'s near space, thus effectively frying your sensor drones, your
ground-based defenses are nearly blind.  The phrase "sitting duck" seems
entirely appropriate.  You need to defend your own high guard position, or
someone will use it against you.

It would seem so, yes, but Virus didn\'t _only_ invade computer systems and
make them attack their owners. Virus launched full arsenals of nuclear
weapons from space to planetary systems. Virus engaged in orbital
bombardments with meson and particle weapons.

Most of the initial strains of Virus were mostly "Suicider" strains that
wanted nothing more than to destroy themselves and in the most
spectacularly violent fashion possible. Usually this entailed crashing the
starship one infested into the nearest large object, usually a world. As we
all know, K\'kree ships are notoriously large due to the fact that K\'kree
are, by nature, claustrophobic. Imagine the size of K\'kree naval vessels!
Now imagine a fleet of those crashing into inhabited worlds. Ouch.

A lack of civil defense also plays against the K\'kree. This is a race that
would be completely adverse to traditional "bomb shelters" or bunkers to
hide in during an orbital attack. They couldn\'t stand the confinement.
Attacks of a nuclear (or perhaps asteroids dropped from orbit) would be
particularly harmful to a race that refuses to sequester itself in
shelters. After the attack was over, the radioactive fallout and nuclear
winter would be devastating as well.

>The virus infected ship won\'t be able to blow

Not true. Computers in Traveller, regardless of whether or not they are of
K\'kree origin, control ship functions. The K\'kree do not employ automation
for everyday tasks like the other races, but for their ships they would be
more likely to employ every facet of automation they could.

Because of the K\'kree caste system, there is a shortage of trained
personnel in technical areas. Only _some_ male wellborn and nobles would
have any training whatsoever in the use of ship technology. When perhaps 90
percent of your population is by default, untechnical, doesn\'t it follow
that systems of major import would be even _more_ automated? Either that,
or K\'kree ships are more likely to misjump than those of any of the other
major races.

Someone else pointed out that some ships are not capable of landing.  I
will point out that if all traffic to a particular world must pass through
the starport then imports can (in theory) be controlled more closely,
off-planet traffic reduced (what will American airspace be like in even
2100AD? crowded for sure), and hazardous or sensitive cargo can be
processed in relative isolation (from on planet hazards or
vulnerabilities).

What if the cargo is never meant to reach the surface? I think that much
of the cargo for a particular system *must* pass through the starport, but
is in fact destined for planets or asteroids other thanthe mainworld or
places in orbit around the main.

You also are using both sides of an argument here; in the first section
you imply how easy it is to get things up and down, in the second that it
adds significantly to the cost. you can\'t use both (well you can, but I\'m
not gonna let you get away with it without mentioning it!).

Now you\'re speaking of military reasons.  The reason for an orbital
starport is economic, not military.  Planets do not expect to be attacked,
kinda like New York City, they do things that are idiotic from a military
point of view (big central power plants for ex.) but quite efficient or
profitable from an economic point of view.  No one expects the power plant
or the city to be attacked.  Most starports are likewise civilian/economic
installations, not military.  Similar military installations may be built
to defend such facilities however.

Spaceships and starships are less efficient and more expensive to build
than orbital facilities.

Again, you say how easy it is to move materials from planet to surface,
then complain about how expensive it is to import food...take a rhetoric
class. 

Life support is cheap...provided it is done on a large scale.  Closed loop
ecosystems are mature technology at TL10 (I\'m estimating here) and are
quite effective at recycling a population\'s waste and providing normal
foodstuffs (better than that general purpose glop stuff).  This is not
practical for a starship, but as another poster pointed out, space is free
- - its just the container that costs money.

       Starships must be streamlined to be able to go into an atmosphere. If
you were to have got a B or A starport without orbital facilities, most big
cargo freighters would have to use a small fleet of subcraft carried by
themselves, or spend large amounts of time making their subcraft travel from
orbit to surface and back, and again, and again... and that IS costly.
        In my games, atmosphere is the main reason for orbital stations.
        House Rule: As a norm, an A-B starport has orbital facilities if the
world hast atmosphere 2+. If not, then it has only surface facilities.

        Yes, although this would not justify an orbital station alone,
that\'s true.

        Think of their value as military *bases* when the defenses are the
starships. If you\'ve got your naval base on the surface, and all your
military ships have to go to the surface to be repaired, etc, it is going to
be very time-consuming (it takes hours to go from orbit to surface), and
time is very valuable from the military viewpoint. Also, imagine your SDB is
damaged and cannot enter the atmosphee, or land... you better have some
orbital facilities, or you lose a couple hundred MCr.
        Not to speak of large military starships that cannot enter the
atmosphere.
        OTOH, orbital stations have an advantage of their own when it takes
to defense: laser batteries must be out of the atmosphere to be effective.
And small drones or satellites are much easier to trick woth EMS packages
than a whole orbital station.

>5- Research : Except the observation point, orbital stations won\'t be very
>usfull. They might be expensive to build and would be quite static. A

        Yes, but if you are a small corporation, maybe you cannot afford to
put your own small research facility out there, but you can *rent* some
space on the local orbital station (this is called increasing returns to
scale in economics: here, you can save the initial fixed costs).

        Yes, orbital stations *are* expensive to maintain. In my games, they
are large-scale projects that can only be afforded by governments or large
corporations.

        If you build a ground base for defense against space attacks, you
want to defend key places, like large cities. If you build the base away
from civilian area, once the attacking starships are over the city, and far
away from your horizon line, the base is useless. So it must be near the
area you want to defend, which implies severe collateral damage. From a
stationary orbit, if the bad guys go into the atmosphere, they are easy
objectives for you (unles they are exactly in the line between you and the
surface objective: careful then, if you miss them you might destroy your own
people down there).

        There is a psychological effect on having some defenses \'up there\'.
It is more impressive: a politician could easily \'sell\' the idea.

        The same Advanced Active EMS packages that would make the drones
useless would be ineffective against a full station with actual people onboard.
        But that\'s a good point. Drones are useful, right, but they must
report somewhere, and would need some orders in actual combat. If you give
them orders from an orbital station instead of from surface, you save time
(0.1 seconds can be very important in combat) and reduce the atmosphere
interferences.

COACC= Close Orbit and Airspace Control Command, i.e. the Air Force and the
space fighters.

        I see lots of reasons for orbital stations, but agree that their
usefulness cannot be taken as granted. Rather, each system would be
considered individually. You cannot argue about the navy if there is no
naval base, you have no trade reasons if the planet has no atmosphere, you
cannot have large funds with less than 100 million people, and, certainly,
TL plays a role.

Vargr-K\'kree conflicts, with some descendants of Vilani refugees from the

	Personally, I found it inconceivable that the K\'kree haven\'t met the Vargr 
by 1100. As well, I\'m convinced that when they did encounter them (a Major 
carniverous race), they would certainly have at least a small war.

	My VERY basic timeline for the area (which I\'m flushing out in more 
detail, to be posted later)

- -400	K\'kree discover jump 4 (TL 13)
- -250	K\'kree finally put J-4 into active use
- -240	K\'kree jump across the Lesser Rift and discover a comparitively large 
Vargr state
	(comprising the approx. same area as the 1100 K\'kree colonies)
- -240 to present	K\'kree quickly conquer the area, but are faced with the 
problem of what to 		do with all these Vargr subjects. The neighboring 
Vargr states don\'t come
		to their neighbors aid, which confounds the K\'kree.

between that time period at the CT era, the K\'kree colonies are frequently 
raided by Vargr corsairs. The K\'kree realize that their lines of supply are 
just too long to even attempt to finish off the Vargr extents, so content 
themselves with frequent bombing raids on the neighboring Vargr worlds. 
This effectively prevents any organized Vargr interstellar states from f  
orming within 2-3 subsectors of the K\'kree colonies, and thus explains the 
apparent \'rift\' between the Vargr and K\'kree on the maps.

	Well, thats the campaign I\'m working on in a nutshell. There\'s more, but I 
really should be working on my history paper of the National Progressive 
Party of Canda, 1900-1925, which was due yesterday, so I\'ll leave that for 
another day.

I presumed that they were paid to do so by a group of Droyne acting at the
behest of either Yaskroday or the Renegade Children.  Whichever knew of it
wanted to reactivate the base, but feared automatic scanners.

(I have them still fighting away in pocket universes.  It is not a very
noticeable war, but it does let me explain away any astronomical gaffes.)

By putting a human structure there that would someday radiate energy, they
could someday sneak in and use it.  They might have already, or perhaps
they got plastered before they got to it.  It is even possible that they
are going to get to it "real soon", as soon as political pressures change.

I suspect they figured that no human could ever get past the unobtainium
vault door with the psionic combination. :)

Ok, I agree with this.  But I still have one problem with it.  Suppose this

How would you relate that high EDU to situtation #2?

This is *always* going to be a problem with apps that attempt to be all
things to everyone.  Both Netscape and MSIE started out as web browsers,
and they were (and are) reasonably good ones.  However, both now purport
to be mail and Usenet clients as well (along with a junk-drawer of other
functions), and both are truly horrible at those jobs.

The Unix culture, in which the Net was born, values small, simple tools
that do one job very well, and also work well with one another, using the
OS as glue.  This is still the best philosophy, IMHO.  Get Eudora or
Pegasus for email, any of a dozen news clients for Usenet, and let
Netscape or MSIE handle web browsing.  You\'ll be far happier, trust me.

Yes, but...

* Travelling up and down through the atmosphere is both time-consuming and
dangerous.  CG won\'t protect you from turbulent winds, great big birdlike
things, TL-11 Stingers fired by rebels in the outback, airborne plagues...
Any starship captain given the choice (and having no other considerations
than efficiency and safety) would far prefer to stay up in the nice clean
safe vacuum.

* Similarly, ships are dangerous to a planet.  A piloting error (or
terrorist) could send a thousand-dton ship slamming into your capital\'s
downtown, ruining your whole day.  As a result, a lot of worlds will
discourage, hyper-regulate, or outright ban privately-operated ships from
entering the atmosphere.

But (as I mentioned on IRC last week) any halfway rational planetary
government is going to want to quarantine cargos for at least a few days,
and an orbital port is by far the best place to do that.  Also, an orbital
point makes a lovely \'chokepoint\' to make sure that everybody pays all
relevant import/export taxes, port fees, and so forth.

Stations intended primarily for this purpose will likely be separate from
the highport(s), in more distant orbits.  There\'ll be a lot of physical
and electromagnetic dirt around a highport.

Until meson guns come along, no ground-based weapon can effectively fire
against a space-based threat.  You need an orbital fortress to engage the
enemy up there.  You\'d actually have a networked defense in depth, mixing
near-orbit fortresses, scattered smaller weapon and observation platforms,
and mobile SDBs.

What about zero-g research (and manufacturing, for that matter)?  What
about cheap limitless vacuum?

Yes, nobody would live in space *just* to live in space.  People living in
orbital habitats would be station staff, related business personnel, and
their dependents.

Ignoring Ki and it\'s simularity with the \'force\', psionics, and motivational
instruction:

  It\'s one thing to break wooden boards along the grain, or breaking britle
  bricks, it\'s another thing to punch through armor.  Martial arts "breaking
  techniques" have their limits, and it\'s based on how well your body parts
  compress -vs- another material fracturing.  The skill in breaking things
  is apply the necessary force with a body part in a sufficiently rigid
  configurion that you don\'t break any bones.

Well thought out reply!  I am softening my stance on just how much profit
is to be made from a low tech trade.  I still think the gradient is too
shallow between low and high tech, though.  Here follows the grungy details.

>>[Scott Ellsworth (me) said]

Oh, very true.  I agree with you that this is the kind of goods that a low
tech world will be able to export in quantity.  My argument was that to the
extent that a world\'s native produced industrial products are good enough,
it can make money in trade with a higher tech planet, but if the produced
goods are not, then you are not going to sell a heck of a lot.

Hand carved wood is hand carved wood at any TL, but the profit margin is
fairly low on handcrafts.  You are better off selling automobiles than
objects d\'art, but you can only do that if your industry is somewhat close,
so that you can import the vital parts, and use local manufacture for the
rest.  I expect this is a TL difference of no more than two levels.

Anything that is labor intensive can be done on a low tech planet
profitably for a time; eventually, it is more cost effective for a high
tech planet to make something roboticly than to use low tech labor.

What I was trying, and failing, to say was: after five or six tech levels,
there is very little a low tech labor intensive culture can do that the
high tech one is willing to pay to have shipped.  What happens when the
cloth used for those clothes requires zero G to make and a laser and a
computer to sew?  The high tech folks must decide between finishing the job
where they are and exporting the zero G production facility.  Entire
governments would be beggared by the support structure needed for a zero G
facility to create and sew TL12 cloth.

I can see this.  A weeks wages for a six pack seems like a perfect example
of how a tramp can make money off a low tech trade.  If the natives make
enough in a week, then that is a tremendous profit for the importer.  If,
on the other hand, they make very little in a week, then the importer might
as well have stayed home selling it over the counter.  From the sound of
things, this one made a profit for the importer, at the cost of sucking a
_lot_ of wealth out of that village.

Sorry, I was unclear.  I was commenting on two aspects: market size, and
value of the goods from the low tech planet.  Whether it is a major
corporation or a government that buys the imported goods, they still cannot
afford many of them.  The low tech world might be willing to give lots for
the goods, but if they do not have much to give, there is little incentive
for off world trade with the major players.  Minor players, like a tramp
freighter, would still be interested.  More on this later.

You were quite correct, though, that I was overemphasizing individuals.

[good examples of what government/industry wants]
>Anyone who can scrape the money together will want 
>to invest in these goods.

Agreed, completely.  I think those governments will want the goods so much
that the profit will not be a mere 50% for five tech levels.  It will be
orders of magnitude, and if it is not, then the tramp freighter will likely
stay home.

This would make the import/export trade for a low tech planet pretty
minimal by the high tech standards.

Because I was terribly unclear.  Apologies - let me try it again.

I see two reasons why merchants sell goods on a low tech world.

1.  The high tech world makes so much that their market is saturated.  The
fluff off the top is enough to satisfy the small industrial demand of the
low tech worlds.  Most sales take place on Sylea and the other high
pop/high tech worlds, and a very small amount is exported.  This small
amount beggars the low tech worlds around it, but the amount they are
paying is still pretty trivial by high tech standards.

In essence, even the poorest person at TL12 probably has enough wealth to
make a significant impact on a TL5 world.

2.  The low tech world produces something close to what the high tech one
does.  In that case, a merchant has to decide whether to sell on Sylea, or
ship it to the nearby low tech world.  Because the lower tech world
produces similar amounts of wealth to the high tech one, they can afford
the products, and bidding will be lively.

Clearly, both of these happen, the question is at what point selling to a
world goes from a sound business decision to a desperation attempt to find
a very small market that someone else has not found.  Or an attempt to
become Lord Kalvan.  My bet is that the changeover happens when the TL
difference is greater than three.

I would argue the point - the people who can pay the most are going to be
those with the money to spend.  Even though a 1000MW generator might
revolutionize the industry of a TL6 world, and thus a whole government
might want to put in a bid, if a Sylean native wants one for his air car
and can pay for it in a month\'s wages, the low tech guys might be in trouble.

We both agree that the TL6 government would work hard to match that Sylean.
 I believe that means that the pocket change of the Sylean is something
that you need a government for at TL6, while the current rules would
indicate that the difference in GNP between Sylea and a TL6 world with
similar pop is only 50%.

Sorry, I was vague.  We agree that there will be a market, I just think it
will be too small to be viable for anyone but a tramp freighter.  I also
think that a decent profit by the tramp freighter will mean they are
interacting with large planetary governments once you get past a few tech
levels difference.

I was trying to raise it, but more by extension.  I suspect that much raw
materials transfer takes place because traders want to put something in the
holds after selling off the one fusion plant the planet will be able to
afford this decade.

>[business development example - convince locals to buy a factory, and then
sell them the part, while selling the output to Sylea.]

Very good example - this is what my merchant characters are trying to do.
I think this is exactly the correct model for a planet only 1-3 tech levels
behind.

If the planet is 6-8 tech levels behind, then you essentially have to bring
in the plant yourself.  The locals just cannot afford it.  They can provide
labor, raw materials, and noble titles to the offworlders, and I suspect
this is what many of the merchants on Sylea are very interested in.

I suspect "extermination" would adequately sum up the K\'kree response to
subjugated Vargr - yes, given modern biochemistry, the carnivorous Vargr
could give up eating natural meat, but I think the K\'kree would *never*
try to turn the Vargr into a "subject species" - those big curved teeth
would just be too darn *creepy* at a visceral level.  I envision the
K\'kree using nasty tailored viruses - orbital bombardment would leave the
planets uninhabitable, and vast extermination camps would be too time
consuming and labor intensive.

I have this strange image of a group of Vargr guerillas initiating new
members into their organization with a gruesome "feast," with a captured
K\'kree officer or administrator as the guest of honor, roasting on a great
big spit (the ultimate loyalty-sealing atrocity).

Well, _Milieu 0_ states on p44 about the population diversity of Sylea: "Of
these
[14 billion people], 80% are primarily racial Vilani, 11% are Solomani, 6%
are native
Syleans, and [3% other]." Later, on p89 it goes into the history of Sylea and 
states "By the time the Vilani arrived around Year -8000, the Syleans had
reached
a technological level currently classified as TL2" and further states about the
natives being pushed off onto reservations, etc. So I think the "canon" has 
finally fired: minor race <g>.

 Hey, don\'t knock it - of such things is the All-Holy Background
 made! :)

 Actually, from what I understand, some warrior rituals among
 the Polynesian islanders developed from beliefs similar to this
 - that warriors who failed to propitiate the gods seemingly
 died more often, and quicker, than those who remembered to
 perform the rituals.  Quite likely, it\'s all just psychological
 gobbledygook - but it\'s been suggested that the rituals may
 have a calming or mind-focussing effect, which turns the
 superstition into reality.

 Now, however indirectly, even a nascent Third Imperium is going
 to be carrying around the emotional baggage of an 11,000-year-
 old Vilani empire, plus that of myriad local cultures.  I would
 think that such an Imperium would be wise to not mess (for the
 most part) with a sophont\'s religious beliefs; and as long as
 the rituals neither put the sophont or his comrades-in-arms at
 risk, nor have clear negative impact on their ability to
 execute their duties, there would be a hands-off policy.

 Remember: An RPG is about "real" people, and real people have
 quirks, eccentricities, emotional baggage, and so on.  A
 universe full of such people is _not_ going to be drily
 rational, or conformant to one particular culture\'s ideals.
 This makes the SF universe of Traveller _more_ SF and _less_
 Fantasy - a good thing, IMO.

But as a waypoint for all the cargo in an entire system, they can serve as a

gas giant refuelling plants, lunar factories, etc. The upstation makes a 
conveinient refuelling and cargo loading point that lets your crew get a little
R&R without worrying about them wandering off from starcity and getting
in trouble <g>

One word:  "OTISVILLE!!!?"

Oh okay, since you referred to it:

"What kind of music you got here?"
"Why, we have BOTH kinds: Country *and* Western."

ObTrav:  If a TL7 or 8 psycho-tyrannical leader wouldn\'t blink at nuking a
competing country, would a Colonel Ifaddauq (you figure it out) on a, say,

Why, oh WHY do people persist in this \'tin can in space\' view of orbital
stations, or that no one would want to live in orbit stuff???

Look at Trin...how many billions and billions of people were living
happily in \'orbit\' (at least until Virus came along and wasted \'em)

Why NOT huge L5 colonies or ramshackle, sprawling \'anchored\' starship
towns, like some of the houseboat neighborhoods/shanty towns we have in
various port cities, or melted planetoid balls, or giant Borg-ish
city/ships, or hell...didn\'t James Blish send Pittsburg off into space at
one point???(Cities in Flight).

Larry Niven described making a really
really BIG planetoid hull this way: find a big nickel iron meteorite,
drill a hole through the core, fill it with water, weld the ends shut with
your giant, gossamer mylar solar mirror. Start it spinning at a slow rate,
and rotisserie it for a while in the focus of your solar mirror.
Eventually the whole thing is hot enough to melt, and the by now highly
pressurized steam poofs it out into a huge bubble of nickel iron, probably
blowing out one end or something in the process.

Patch the holes and you could conceivably have several cubic miles of
space inside a nice secure hull.

Yes there are numerous holes in both the theory and the hull, but
!#@$!#!@, it Traveller is a game of imagination!!! We can\'t possibly
imagine what life is going to be like in the year 0 of the Third Imperium,
so why do we persist so in saying what is/isn\'t possible or desirable,
based on 20th century thinking!

Why are we constricting ourselves to such a cramped view, when looking out
you could see the glorious diversity that makes Travelller so much fun,
just by looking up, and _IMAGINING_!!!

Go read something like _Nova_, or by Samuel R. Delaney, or _Riding the
Torch_ or _Child of Fortune_ by Norman Spinrad to name just a few
examples. They portray a future radically unlike the present, but so
immediately understandable that you think you\'re there. 

Sometimes, I think, we get so embroiled in tiny little details about such
trivial things that we forget the scope of what we\'re immersing ourselves
in...10,000 worlds, trillions of people, human, alien, in between, humanly
alien and alienish humans, starship gypsies and worn down dirt farmers...

...Ancient sites, Vilani ruins, continent-sized arcologies, sylvan
paradises, brutal hellholes, floating crystal cities, deep sea domes,
Belter hangouts, disreputable downports, universities 7000 years old, star
empires a man\'s lifetime old, and yes, dammit, orbital habitats! 

/RANT OFF

Think about it, folks...stop worrying aboout how many rivets you\'re using,
step back and just daydream about it...

That feeling of wonder feels GOOD don\'t it ;-)

Not to mention that the Vargr, having descended from genetically engineered
Terran canines, probably cannot properly digest much in the way of
vegetable matter, making the point moot.

In short, they\'d starve first!

Let\'s see. Major race dietary types:

Human: omnivorous
Aslan: carnivorous
Vargr: carnivorous
Droyne: carnivorous(?)
Hivers: omnivorous(?)

The K\'kree don\'t have many friends, do they?

Anyone ever conduct that great William H. Keith campaign in the fourth

about the G\'naak.

preliminary design work myself, but abandoned it when work got too hectic.
A few overall observations follow, with more detailed comments on each
design.

1) All of these designs are compromised to one degree or another compared
to the CT Happy Fun Ball.  Most designers opted for a reduction in jump
capability - you\'ll notice that there are only two ships with J3 (one M3,
the other M2) - the rest are J2.  Most are M2 as well, thought there are
some J2 M3 designs.  Is this reasonable?  Well, in an environment where J3
is the best technology around (like in Milue 0), J2 is probably good
enough for a "cheap mercenary ship" that is not expected to be a
front-line combat vessal.  It\'s notable that the J3 design is one of the
most expensive as well.  However, I like the J3 personally - it gives much
greater operational flexibility, plus the capacity to jump in at J2 and
still have fuel to jump away. 

  The other compromise has to do with small craft.  No one has more small
craft than the Happy Fun Ball - most have much less.  At the extreme is
the one design that has no small craft beyond some air rafts.  Frankly,
any strategy that involves insertion of troops using the main ship is a
poor one - the ship is a lot more expensive than the cutters that land the
troops, and the ship can land as a last-ditch effort anyway. 

2) There was wide variation in the way the "cabable of ship to ship
combat" specification was met.  Only one contestant included a detailed
threat analysis - lots of points for that in my book.  I\'m not sure I
fully buy the arguement for meson screens - that\'s TL12, and most places a
mercenary cruiser would be visiting in Milue 0 aren\'t that high tech - but
it would be nice insurance.

  Most of these ships are better armed than the Happy Fun Ball (which had
four missile and four laser turrets).  I especially like the idea of
having a meson gun - no missiles to run out of, and it gives a nice level
of battlefield support.  Costly, though, and needs a fair amount of crew
at this TL.  For what it\'s worth, I planned to put a meson gun in my
design, so I do like the idea overall.

3) Overall, I like almost all the entries - great job, everyone!  detailed

  This a very nice mid-range design that is perhaps the closest in spirit
to the Happy Fun Ball.  There are two small craft, offensive weaponry is
limited to missiles and lasers, and a nice number of troops are carried.
A well balanced, capable design, with nothing odd or quirky.

  A nice design, though rather expensive (and you don\'t even get J3).  It
would be worth it for the designer to run this trough QSDS - you could
duplicate the ship fairly closely, and probably bring the cost down with
the extra discount.  The extra space is the 900T hull is put to good use
for the two Modular Cutters.  The meson screens and nuclear dampers are a
nice touch, and the other weaponry is standard - missile and laser.
Overall, a nice design, but expensive for what you get.

  This design is hard to get a handle on, since it seems that many of the
components are not specified above - where are all those troops living, if
they are not listed as crew or as high/mid/low passengers?  The
collapsable tank idea is a nice one for getting extra room for the troops
in jump - good place to play grav ball.  I would have prefered it if the 
cost of the small craft were included, as well as crew for them and so on
- - the cost of this design is low as a result.  Two 50t Modular cutters
would fit the hanger specified.  The lack of dedicated defensive armament 
is a problem, given what others have said about their designs, though the 
Happy Fun Ball had nothing in this line, so we\'ll let that go.

  I don\'t have my copy of the rules, but I\'m pretty sure this is not a
pooka QSDS design - launch ports are not specified separatly from hull
space.  For 20T small craft hangers, you need 40 tons of space, so 200
tons of hanger gets you 5 hanger doors, not 10 (and no extra 50T door
either).  I\'ll be happpy to change my views if someone can point me to the
section of the rules that allows this as a QSDS design (I\'m sure it\'s
legal under SSDS).

  Overall: delivers lots of troops, but at a high price and little
protection.

  This is a very nice design - very close to what I would have submitted,
thogh I would have tried for J3.  The rational for weaponry and defensive
systems given below is very well done - extra points for including it!

  Overall, nicely done.  The price is low since the small craft are not
included in the price - add another 56MCr to make things fair.

  This minimal design is not much cheaper than its larger competitors, and
it gives away a lot of performance.  With a single ship\'s boat, there is
no redundancy in troop transport, aside from bringing the ship itself in.
This design might appeal to those who are cash strapped, but although it
mounts a nice mix of weaponry and defensive systems, I think it\'s marginal
for the intended mission.

  This a warship with some troops on it, not a mercenary cruiser.  High
cost, and troops have to ride down in grave vehicles rather than shuttles.
Interesting example of the high end, but not practical.

  A very capable design in terms of performance (the only J3 M3 ship in
the bunch).  For the cost, however, you get limited weaponry and you have
to deliver troops by G-carrier rather than shuttle.  The two fighters are
a nice touch.  Despite some flaws, one of my favorites.

  Not bad for a cheap design, and it has J3.  Underarmed for ship to ship
combat, especially with only 3 armor (though that may be a misprint for
30).  No small craft.  Rather weak overall.


  No clear winner in my book, though it looks to me like the really cheap
designs are not capable.  Overall, I liked the Horus and the Condottieri
best in terms of performance and presentation, and the Cobra gets an
honorary mention for J3 M3 performance.  The Heracules is worth re-doing
as a QSDS design - that would make it cheap enough to be competitive.

	Well, let\'s not forget to pound an ash stake through his heart
(hitting such a small target might prove difficult though) and stuffing his
mouth full of garlic, before we either immerse the coffin in running water
or bury it at midnight at a crossroads...  either way, we\'d still want to
not just sprinkle but douse the remains with holy water, and stuff a
consecrated Host down the front of his shorts...

	The problem is is that my players don\'t just get homicidal, they

	Hm.  Still have a problem with it; scholarship, IMHO, consists of
skills; reading, writing, research, use of certain analyses, all of which
a) are learned and not innate and therefore best treated as skills, not
attributes.  Me, I\'d use Intelligence, Perception, Wits, and Perseverance
(aka Willpower), and have all the academic skills, both the general
scholarship ones and the specific disciplines, such as physics or
archaeology, as skills...

that triggered it.  In summary, I asserted that nobody lives in space just
to live in space; people will live in space because they work there.

After much pondering, I\'m going to stand by my statements.  On the whole,
with the exception of a few percent of the population, peoples residences
follow their jobs.  Often, a region will have a few base industries (like
aerospace, entertainment, and information processing [banking, software,
investing] in Los Angeles, where I live), plus a huge cluster of support
businesses for the people in those industries (shopping malls, grocery
stores, restaurants, home builders and sellers, movie theaters, and so
forth).  In general, the base industries produce the bulk of exports,
bringing in the bulk of money from outside the area, which then gets sent
out of the area again by the peripheral businesses.

For example, I work in software.  My company sells products to (say) a
trading house on Wall Street, moving money from NY to LA.  The company
pays me with that money.  I spend part of that money on a book, which a
local book retailer has purchased from a publishing house in NY.
Publishing is a base industry in NY.

The \'anchor\' industries of a space colony (or an inhospitable planet) are
going to be different from those of an Earthlike world, in general. 
They\'re not going to be based on (say) agriculture or the like; they\'ll
also not likely be based on anything you can easily, cleanly do on a
planet (like (say)  software development, or light manufacturing, or
whatever), because the additional costs of maintaining all your workers in
a place where air costs money are going to be an effective tax on your
production.  As a result, space colonies will (in the main) be built
around economic backbones that are best done in space:  heavy (polluting)
manufacturing, solar energy production, zero-gee or vacuum manufacturing,
tourism, or whatever.

This is not to say that such colonies won\'t be big; a thriving factory
cylinder might have a million or more people, maybe 10% actually in
primary manufacturing jobs, another 90% in the auxilliary businesses,
government, and the like.  But those 10% who are *using* the fact they\'re
in space are the reason the other 90% are there.

martial arts (read: oriental) are just the same as any other type of unarmed combat
There is no need for tables and charts to check to see if you scream KEEE-YA just right.
I have no training whatsoever in hand to hand but I used to spar with a friend who was 
some colour of belt (2 or 3 up from the start colour, it\'s been 5 years)
My unorthodox methods were hard for him to counter (read: no plan, just attack). And I 
have flipped several people who had taken martial arts training because they expected 
everything to work just so.
If you want a breakdown of brawling, why not breakdown every other skill.
Just call brawling whatever you want, and budda bing budda boom, you have alternate 
rules.
BTW, the deadliest form of hand to hand would most likely be commando training (various 
countries)

The Octagon Society was, I think, much more than is suggested in Twilight\'s Peak, but 
just what remains obscure.  We know the following:  Doon, who founded the OS, was 
stranded on Beck\'s World (then called Frisini) for some ten years before rescue.  As a 
result of his ordeal, he commenced practically a religious crusade to build shelters 
throughout the Spinward Marches for stranded spacefarers.  This was in 342.  Over the 
next hundred and some years, octagon shelters were built in virtually every system in 
Regina, Lanth, and Aramis subsectors.  Embezzelement of funds -- the OS was a charitable 
organization, relying on donations to fund its projects -- led to collapse of the OS and 
its dissolution in 499.

Was the OS a cover for people who were searching for Ancient site throughout the Marches 
without Imperial permits?  Did someone find the Ancient site on Fulacin, and decide to 
construct the shelter on top of it to permit exploitation without anyone knowing about 
it? Were they embezzling funds to finance that or other excavations? 

After the conclusion of Twilight\'s Peak, there is likely to be substantial renewed 
interest in the Octagon Society, as people everywhere start looking for Ancient sites 
under the the octagon shelters.

First, thanks for the kind words on my Horus design...and I agree, adding
MCr 56 is a reasonable way to factor in two 50-ton cutters, not included
in my base design cost.

However, the actual reason I\'m writing is this bit, about one of the other
entries:

That middle sentence contains my nominee for "most accurate typo on the
TML, 1997." :)

Up to a point, I agree.  However, there will be systems where the most
hosptible location for people to live will be in orbit. Besides, once a
generation or two have been born, grown old and died in orbit you may have
a breed of man that *prefers* living in orbital Tubes...let\'s call them
Tubers. <g>
 
Yes, things will be different for the Tubers.  Air won\'t be free, it\'ll
have to be produced, but the energy to do it is almost free.  If there are
astriod belts, resources will be plentiful. They will be able to make sure
the environment is santitized, clean and controlled.  Why would these
Tubers *want* to get down onto the dirty, unclean muck of a planet.

It could have been an innocent blunder -- probably was -- but it could have been avoided

Olga was at least arguably related to science fiction.

In the Traveller universe the individuals that the Ancients took from Earth
300,000 years ago (which I have dubbed Homo Antiquitus - Ancient Man) were 
Homo Sapiens, regardless of what science may conclude about things in the 
Real World (tm). This is evident from the fact that Solomani, Vilani, 
Zhodani, Darrians and numerous other human races are interfertile 300,000
years later (Though that dosen\'t necesarily mean that _all_ minor human 
races are interfertile). If a Solomani is interfertile with 300,000 year
divergent descendants of Homo Antiquitus like the Darrians and the Vilani
then surely he would be interfertile with Homo Antiquitus too.

And this apply even if someone proves conclusively that in reality our
great^10,000-grandfather wasn\'t Homo Sap. In the Traveller universe he was.

Hee! Hee!

Seriously though, I don\'t think the costs would be all that bad for a
culture that already *lived* in space.  That sort of culture would be used
to processing iceballs, asteroids, even small moons.  They might not be too
interested in terraforming a world when it\'s so much easier to live in
space.  

If some flatlanders wanted to *hire* the job done, that might be a
different story.  Move some rocks around, erect a few sun-screens or
mirrors, drop some taylored microbes and sell plots to dumb flatlanders
that want to buy a piece of dirt. ;->

1. Generic names are capitalized (_Homo_), and specific names are
always lower case (_sapiens_), a minor nit :-)

2. There is no reason why modern _Homo_sapiens_ might not be able to
breed with a _Homo_erectus_ if one came along.  The problem with
species attribution in paleontology is that we can\'t really use the
"if they can produce fertile offsping they\'re the same species
test."  In addition, speciation can be allowed on geographic, or
even preferencial basis----a given critter _could_ breed with
another, but never choses to, or can\'t because they live someplace
that doesn\'t allow them to meet.

No, it proves that we were interfertile with _H.erectus_.  Actually,
this isn\'t surprising, really.  If we were able to breed with any
other species, it would be one that follows or preceedes us since at some 
point there was a _H.erectus/H.sapiens(archaic)_ walking around.

Breeding with an australopithicene would be more dicey, but who
knows, look how close we are to _Pan_troglodytes_ (chimpanzee)...

increase of thruster prices by a factor 14, affected the economic realities

out that the thruster-equipped ship can deliver cargo at the cost of approx.
Cr900 per ton while the HEPlaR-equipped ship, _despite_ the larger power
plant, increased fuel consumption and smaller cargo space, can still deliver
freight for approx. Cr850 per ton.

So while thruster plates certainly give a military advantage it is not
commercially superior to HEPlaR. I haven\'t designed any larger ships, but I
don\'t see why the figures should be different for larger ships; the freight
charges will be lower, but they will remain in proportion.

BTW, about fuel prices: I\'ve assumed that both ships have a 3T capacity fuel
purifier plant and buy unrefined fuel rather than pay the exorbitant prices
for refined fuel.

I don\'t like it because it seems fairly contrived.  A PC should be able to
start with whatever they roll.  Education is not a measure of school-time,
but a measure of certain problem solving/knowledge application skills. 
Like this:

INT is deductive logic.  Solving the problem at hand...
EDU is inductive logic.  Fitting things into known paradigms...

Each one is about half of the standard IQ or achievement tests (SAT, GRE,
LSAT, GMAT)...


My suggestion is that a PC be given the following options for each YEAR of
college or graduate school:

1.  +1 EDU
2.  +1 INT
3.  1 roll on the college table.
4.  1 choice of his "major" field of study.

With the REQUIREMENT that s/he take at least 2 years of the "major" course.
 That aughta put EDU bonuses back into line...

    'body' => 'Nicolas LeJeune (nlejeune@suresnes.marben.fr) had some interesting and
well-thought-out questions about the need for orbital starports given that
Traveller has contra-grav, high-acceleration starships, and since a high
port has more expensive life-support, storage, and he claims is harder to
defend.

Interstellar passengers and cargo are not all going to a single
destination, but to hundreds of cities, factories, and locations around the
planet. This means a ground facility will not be more efficient; in fact it
will be less since bulk cargos are more difficult to handle on the ground.
Passengers will still have to arrange transportation to their final
destination, and a ground port has significantly less traffic capacity than
an orbital station because it is on a plane. An orbital station has an
order of magnitude more space for arriving, departing, taxiing, and in
transit ships than a ground port.

The quickest ground transport will be sub-orbital flights, which can be
taken directly from an orbital station. From a ground station passengers
and cargo will have to disembark, transfer to a sub-orbital craft, then go
back up again. Very inefficient. The same is true in reverse for boarding;
it will be much faster to take a local shuttle to an orbital station that
to a ground stations and then back into space again. If you\'re travelling
in space, orbit is a much more convenient meeting point than the ground.

While it is true a high-acceleration contra-grav airframe craft can dock at
a ground station just as easily as an orbital station, what about all the
ships that don\'t fall into that category? They will be far better served by
an orbital station. Top-end craft are no better served by a ground station,
in fact they may be worse served because of the traffic control problem.
Starships without all that high-performance engineering will be more cost
effective, and will work just as well as the more expensive ships at an
orbital facility. That gives orbital facilites the advantage for commerce.

Why do you think handling bulk cargos is more expensive in orbit? Cargo is
going to have to be handled and distributed to its final destination
whether in orbit or on the ground, but orbit has zero-g and a lot more room
for handling. I would think ground handling would be more expensive. "High
speed trucks" are not going to be able to transport cargo planet-wide from
any starport, ground or orbital.

Why do you think an orbital station would be more expensive? Construction
cost would probably be cheaper, especially if the material is also from
space. And the land cost is considerably less. The examples you give are
ground-to-ground transport; a starport is for interplanetary transport.

Orbital stations are also much more secure. Ground stations are much more
vulnerable to trespassers, stowaways, weather, earthquakes, riots, and
local interference. A ground station can\'t move if there is a
disadvantageous change in government or travel patterns. An orbital station
can. Ground stations can also be constrained by problems like zoning laws,
urban spread, and geography, which orbital stations do not have. Also, a
large number of ships will just be passing through. If they need to stop
for mail, refined fuel, or repairs this will be a lot of unnecessary
planetary landings and takeoffs.

As for military defense; we both agree that high-performance contra-grav
ships, which the military can certainly afford, can attack a ground base as
easily as an orbital base, so there is no difference there. Why do you
think an orbital station is such an "easy target"? Since the ground station
is going to be much larger and spread out, I would think it is a much
easier target. A ground station is just as vulnerable to bombardment, meson
guns, missiles, and nuclear weapons, but cannot use sandcasters, stealth
design, or EM absorbent coating to protect itself. Another difference is
the collateral damage during an attack. A starport will be a top-priority
target for any invasion. Where would you want the first strike on your
system to be; right by your capitol or out in space? An orbital station
would also be able to respond faster because of its traffic-control
advantage. Active ships can also be put on \'picket duty\' in space much
easier than on the ground.

Certainly living expenses will be higher in space than on the ground, but
do you think all starport employees live in the starport? Not likely. And
remember with high-acceleration contra-grav it is no cheaper to commute to
the ground than to space, and will probably take longer. You\'re not going
to have farms in either orbital or ground starports, unless you are talking
space colonies, and again the construction cost for things of this size
will be much greater on the ground than in space.

In fact, I would ask why would starships even bother to land on the ground?
In my campaign, most ground ports are just a bunch of offices, barracks for
workers, and storage depots. Passengers and cargo arrive at the orbital
port and leave by shuttle directly to the destination factory or city.
There is not a single \'ground port\', but hundreds of landing pads all over
the planet.

There\'s a little bit more \'bout that. I myself train ninjutsu in an

Depends, if somebody has learned a martial SPORT (with rules and certain
techniques for certain situations) or a real martial art. Latter you
don\'t find so easy.

It\'s not that easy. I.e. in Ninjutsu, you normally learn TAIJUTSU
(weaponless fight, with boxing, throwing, strangling, right movement,
distance, timing and many more things in it)
Then you learn how to use weapons, and in fact, if your taijutsu is good
enough, everything can become a weapon.

But how would you express this as skills in traveller terms?

Are you referring to the practical difficulty involved in mating with someome
that has been dust for umpteen millenia, or are you saying that such a test,
even if it was possible, would be invalid? In the second case you\'ll have
to explain why. In the first, who knows? There may still be some Homo

I\'m sorry, but I don\'t see how you can even argue about wether or not two
individuals are of the same species without involving the definition of
being of the same species. If we can\'t use the aforementioned test (at
least theoretically) what\'s the point of using the word?

(And proves it without applying the test, btw.) So dosen\'t that mean that we
are the same species as _H.antiquitus_ still?

But we wouldn\'t be able to breed with the species preceding or following us
since the definition of different species is that they can\'t breed (well,
produce fertile offspring, actually). I must be missing some part of your
argument here.

Close, but not close enough to even produce infertile progeny, much less
fertile.

I disagree with you. If it\'s easy, it\'s not free. Today, you can easily
hire a truck to carry some cargo from town to town, you\'ll have to get
fuel, to hire a driver... Even if the fuel is quite cheap, the personnel
has to be payed. And even if you use automated vehicles, you have to buy or
hire them.

But i agree that sometime, you have no choice (unslreamlined starship,
living cargo for risk of infection...)

can\'t; ie cats carnivore, dog omnivore. 
So it is _possible_ for Vargr to live as K\'kree subjects, but don\'t expect 
them to enjoy it. Maybe such Vargr would suffer from psychological 
complaints because of their repressed puppy-nature.

My ( Newcomer ) sincere apology to all subcribers for my recent posting.
I should not subcribe the list and do posting immediately. Maybe,
lurking is the best alternative to understand the right behaviour of a

I am also sorry for those systems crashed, resulted from my recent
posting.

However, I strongly belief that all Internet Travellers deserve a right
to know this beautiful place - Borneo Paradise.  Where would I post it
on ?

Please reply this message to my personal email account

The venerable Cmdr X (Go Navy!) suggested in his IRC class that such
ships (equipped with only thruster plates) have to land tail down in
gravity wells.  (Though this might get us into the far-too-recent
direction-of-thrust argument).  CG also makes skimming for fuel far
easier, I\'d think....

    'body' => 'Hi,

someone on the list mentioned the illo in the MT encylopedia on the page 
which has the minor race article mentioning the Suerrat. They thought it 
was an illo of Suerrats - sorry, it\'s an illo of the various castes of 
K\'Kree (from the article on the facing page).

More on the Suerrat. The Megatraveller Journal 3, in it\'s article on the 
Jonkereen, states that the Jonkereen were geneered to colonize a desert 
world the Suerrat were trying to colonize, about 550. The Suerrat were 
agressively trying to colonize the free world left in the Imperium, and 
the Jonkereen was seen as a way of slaping them down, without provoking a 
military response. One odd thing about this is that Iielish was toasted 
about 400, so the Suerrat being allowed to even attempt more colonization 
is strange - but there may actuall be an answer to this in First Survey 
(I promise I won\'t start on FS!).

In first survey, worlds with non-villani names do not have a full stop 
after their name. This is true of Iielish, with it\'s poor tech level for 
a starfaring race, but also true for a lot of worlds around Iielish, some 
of which are TL-11/12. The Suerrat may have colonized their area in the 
distant past (Long Night? Pre 1st Imperium?), and exhausted the 
resources, or will, of Iielish in doing so. The Iiellish Revolt would 
have been organized by Suerrat nationalist on Iiellish, but some of the 
advanced colony worlds may have been neutral, or opposed the revolt. 
While Iielish was nuked at the end of the revolt, there would have been a 
large enough grouping of loyal Suerrat planets to continue Suerrat 
expansion into the Imperium.

I agree with you about imagining 
BUT I remember an 30\'s american movie which story was supposed to take
place in 80\'s. They\'ve stated that every body would have a personnal plane
and would got to work by air. Seem to be wrong. 

Today\'s The small personnal planes are 50\'s techno. The prices of such
devices aren\'t reduced because we are able to build the F117 or the space
shuttle. Such simple planes are expensive, even if it\'s an old technology.
How many of you have one?

TNE stated that a TL6 car cost around 5000Cr. An enclosed Air Raft for 4
passenger is about 270 000 Cr!!! It\'s exacly the same problem of plane.
It\'s not because the technology exists that normal being can buy it (even
on a high TL world). 
My players own 53% of 85MCr starship (they\'ve lot of chance). But they have
no money to buy an air raft. They could only get a crosscountry wheeld
vehicle. Air raft has many advantages, but this is not the reason to offer
it to the players

In the \'Cost of living in T4\' article, James Garriss stated that cost of
life was around 2500Cr for normal living. I\'m not sure that even a starship
pilot could own a private Air raft. How many people own a 400 000$ car.
Only very rich people could. 

Today\'s transportation companies don\'t use plane because it\'s fun, they use
it because they have no choice. This is an expensive way to carry cargo.
Sea ships and trains are always largely in use because it is cheaper.

Personnally, the realism and rationnalism of situations (technology,
economics, combat system, culture...) is very important for me and my
player. That\'s why i\'m a gearhead and i want to know how a jump drive
works... Traveller is more science than fiction for me. Star Wars is more
fiction than science. That doesn\'t mean that i dislike it, not at all!

I like the concept of orbital bases, because it\'s more fun to dock in a
space station than in a middle of a town. Sure! All I need is to for some
argument of viability of orbital stations. Many of you have given some that
I didn\'t suspected.

That\'s why the Traveller Mailing List is! No?

I was just wondering if anyone have any information about Gravitics (G

connected to the Graviton 

As Lasers radiates photons, does Gravitics devices radiates gravitons and
how (which way...)?
Could this radiations be dangerous or detectable (by densitometers for
example)


By the way, can an orbital station without ContraGrav easily sustain
position on orbit with only 0.05G of propulsion for corrections?

Yes, the Syleans are a minor race. I wonder how many people on Sylea are true

The Imperium rules the spaces between the stars. Each world is responsible
for its own laws and enforcement. To a great extent, if someone can get past
the "state line" he or she gets away. The problem is (1) remembering never to
come back to that place again, (2) not ending up there by mistake, or (3) not
getting taken there by someone else (bounty hunters?).

The Imperium gets involved when it gets crossed.

    'body' => ' Firstly, thanks to Mark Clark <clarkm@OIT.EDU> for saying nice things
about NVNA\'s latest offering. I can feel my ego (and their share price)
inflating already :) As for the rest:

"Greek Fire" and "Heracules" [and "Condottieri"]:
	Each of these three designs attempted to duplicate the good old
"Happy Fun ball", albiet with differing hull configurations and weapons
loadouts. All limit their range to an adequete jump-2 in order to squeeze
in those small craft (with redundency), extensive support facilities, and
lots of cargo space. As Mark said, the Heracules really needs a redesign
using QSDS. Otherwise, they\'re all pretty balanced.

"Warrior" and "Gladius"
	These two went for a minimalist design philosophy, sacrificing
size and redundant landing capability for a decreased cost. IMHO the
Gladius tries to do a little too much on the small hull (though I\'m
mystified as to where all the space went). The Warrior, OTOH, does it
right, managing to squeeze in J-3 performance _and_ enough cargo space
(though it seems to be missing power-plant fuel. Whoops!). Despite it\'s
bugs, and not quite meeting the specification, I rated this design highly
- - it makes a great "pocket merc cruiser" for those who can\'t or won\'t go
for the bigger vessels.

"Huscarle"
	An interesting design, but its troop capacity is a little larger
than called for, and is gained at the cost of cargo and vehicle space.
OTOH, it shows just what you can do if you\'re willing to pack them in like
sardines.
	IMHO, this one makes a good transport for cartingbulk troops and
their toys around, but I wouldn\'t want to make an opposed landing in it.

"Horus" and "Dawn Eagle"
	Merc-cruisers with meson guns! Heavy fire support whenever you
need it, whereever you need it! Problem is, it costs - the Horus has next
to no cargo capacity, and must store its carried vehicles in the cutters.
As for the Dawn Eagle, I think Mark was correct in describing it as "a
warship with some troops on it"; it\'s very capable, but has no backup
landing craft and is a tad expensive (the meson screen, maybe?). OTOH,
given its performance, the Imperial Navy may be interested in it.
	Other than that, I thought both these toys were very cool :)

"Cobra"
	This one was interesting - A large, high performance vessel which
carries a ton of troops, and their air support too. Problems are the lack
of cargo space and the necessity of mounting landing operations in
G-carriers, but other than that I thought it was pretty cool.

 So, anyone else want to stick their thruster-plate in?

I dare to disagree, loose leafs need higher quality paper, and are

20 km at .1c is enough to turn the whole *planet* inside out. Let\'s not

20 km is 4.2e12 meters^3. Times 5.5 density for rock gives 2.3e13

Think *big*. If the base is hollowed out of an asteroid that was nudged
into a convenient orbit, it\'s going to take quite a bit to bother it. 
I won\'t recap the long arguments about "orbital forts" from last year. 

And if nothing else, given the way most civilian politicians seem to
think about such things, having it in orbit is good, because if it
*does* get blasted, it won\'t affect the planet\'s ecosphere noticeably.
Blasting a ground base tends to mess things up even if it\'s in the
middle of nowhere.

The planet *can* hire "bounty hunters". But the way the "unwritten
laws" regarding such work, the bounty hunters can\'t break local laws
without getting in trouble. If they manage a "snatch" in space or in a
port\'s extrality without inconveniencing bystanders, they may be
allowed to get away with it, if they can deliver the prisoners without
any fuss. 

The trick is doing the snatch without bothering bystanders, and keeping
control of the prisoners *without* excessive force (drugging etc are
frowned on) until you reach the planet they are wanted on. 

Meanwhile, their friends are allowed to try to liberate them, subject
to similar restrictions. 

So it\'s generally not worth the trouble as the bounty hunters want
*lots* of money. And the limitations keep things "civilized" if they
do happen. 

These same "unwritten laws" deal with the occasional "private war"
(feud), interplanetary espionage, and the like. The Imperium allows
them only because there are cultures that have to have at least the
*appearance* of a change to "right" some types of "wrong".

But it\'s not *insignificant*. Also, there are ships that *can\'t* land,
or can only do so with difficulty. And the bigger the ship, the more
reasons to make it that way.

Extra handling means more people get to make a profit. Only the
consumers will complain. :-)

Again, given that some ships (especially the "bulk" carriers) *cannot*
land then it definitely *is* cheaper to have a station instead of
having to send up enough shuttles to load/unload the ship RIGHT NOW. 

And if orbital stations exist, it\'s cheaper to build ships that *don\'t*
land than ones that do.

You also *want* orbiting comm sats and weather sats, as well as things
like resource mapping and observation. Once you get to the point where
you can easily have a manned presence in space, it makes more sense to
base such out of an orbital station and use "tenders" to service the
satellites.

Hardly. They will be *less* expensive than a ship, as they don\'t need a
manuever drive. And many sorts of research (more technological than
scientific) are likely to require more "room". Astronomers and the like
would want their instruments isolated from whatever people are living
in. First, to avoid the unavoidable leakages of gasses which would
interfere with observations, second, to avoid *vibrations*. So they
might live on the station and have a tight radio link to the scope,
which only gets visited once a week/month to have film cartridges
changed. (And woe to the pilot who gets far enough off his flight path
to fly *through* the observing field of the scope!)

Since a station will have artificial gravity in the living areas (by
spinning them if nothing else), most of the problems with "farming" are
minor. Life support *can\'t* be that expensive, or ships would be
impractical. 

As for "importing" food, most people eat imported food *now*. And don\'t
even realize it. How much of *your* food is produced within 100 miles
of where you live? Probably more than is true for me, given the
relative sizes of France and the US.

Since part of your argument is that it is *cheap* to get from the
surface to orbit, that *kills* the arguments that claim building a
station is expensive. Ditto for the ones about living there being
expensive. You merely need to reprocess air, and do at least *some*
processing of water and sewage. You no more grow your own food than
Paris or New York City do.

It\'s possible. The trick is figuring out what the locals are using to
*buy* the hi-tech stuff with. They *are* bartering for it. 

Consider: either they are trading straight across (like Pepsi Cola
trading X liters of Pepsi for Y liters of vodka), or they are paying
for it with currency. But where did they *get* the currency? By selling
some local product for it.

Thus, it\'s best to look at interstellar trade between planets of
different tech levels as being barter. So the question on each side is
what do they have that is worth something to the other side.

Expect for "arts and crafts" the *only* things a low-tech produces that
are worth anything to a high tech are raw materials. Food, fiber,
lumber, other plant products (spices, drug precursors, etc). Ditto for
animal products. And mineral products will be ores, semi-refined
metals, and stones ranging from gems to fancy building stones. 

Manufactured goods from low tech countries tend to be pretty rare.
Mostly clothing and a bit of furniture.

Luckily, the bigger the tech level difference the fewer high tech items
the low tech culture wants/needs. Drugs and medical items, yes. But the
other types of "expensive" items are not as high volume. Transportation
will be in demand, but more demand will be for trucks than cars, and
more for buses than cars as well.

Strangely, cars sell for a lot less in South America. Several hundred
dollars will do. That\'s why they have plants in Brazil producing *new*
VW "Bugs".

Depends on *where* the high tech goods are produced. The Brazilian
factory can produce a new car for a thousand or so because they don\'t
have to pay workers $20/hr. (Why do you think so much clothing
production and "assembly" type work is done in "poor" countries)

Until we get *real* automation (or "faber" type technology) this will
be a factor. Then, the prices will hit a minimum.

Well, I\'ve always been fond of the traditions of the Patrol, as set
forth by Heinlein in "Space Cadet". One tradition is that they have 4
names that are called at all formal musterings. We only know what two
of them did. John Rivera went in to negotiate with officials in his
native city during a rebellion. He left orders that the city was to be
nuked on schedule if he didn\'t return. The officials held him hostage.
The orders were carried out. 

The other one of The Four about whom we have any info is Erza
Dahlquist. He died preventing a mutiny from succeding. His story is
told in "The Long Watch".

BTW, "The Long Watch" originally appeared in American Legion magazine!
Some day I\'m going to try tracking it down in the local used magazine
store.

Not necessarily. I can lay back a mile or so and punch holes in ABD
with an "anti-material rifle". .50 cal to 20 mm slug at a high velocity
will ruin your day. The laser can\'t detontate it, as it\'s a solid slug
(though it may have a penetrator dart core). It can\'t vaporize it, as
you don\'t have *that* kind of power available. So it hits and punches a
hole in you.

Mind you, it\'s best to do this from behind *heavy* cover and as part of
a co-ordinated assualt (ie multiple fire teams from multiple directions).

ps. I find a PD laser on BD *really* unlikely. It can\'t have all that
much power, so it\'s only good for prematurely detonating some types of
rounds. And the claymore/explosive coating idea isn\'t any better.
There\'s not enough surface to make that tactic workable. If you use
enough to be sure of knocking something out, you just made yourself
vulnerable to a shot from *near* the same direction. Attack from 4
seperate directions and the stuff will all have been used. so it\'s just
not a useful tactic.

For an *excellent* treatment of this sort of thing, check out Mercedes
Lackey\'s "Storm Rising". It\'s fantasy, but has an incident that\'s an
*excellent model for this. A military commander is "cut off" and
managed to get winter quarters (for a *nasty* winter) set up.

An officer approaches the commander because most of his sub-unit
bellong to a particular shamanistic religion and they want permission
to set up a sweat lodge in a corner of the barracks. The commander
merely makes sure that it won\'t take up too much space, and says that
any extended spirit quests will require using leave time. And throws in
a joke about ketting one\'s spirit go for a walk if there\'s to much snow
to do it in the body.

Yep. And if a culture gets a high tech level but keeps things like
"simple" religions, then you *are* going to have scenes like the one I
describe above.

Different cultural "views" are a *good* thing for giving the game some
flavor. There are human cultures right here on earth that are *more*
alien than anything presented so far in traveller.

Think of it more like an international airport. It\'s surrounded by
warehouses *and* hotels. 

The hotels are for crews that want to get off the ship while "in port".
For business people who "flew in" for a conference with the local
branch. For people working at the port who find it easier to live there
than commute. Etc.

Consider: At lower tech levels it\'s expensive enough to get to/from the
station that you\'d really like to minimize "unecessary" trips to the
ground. So low tech stations *will* have living quaters, and the
staff/crew will trade off, rather like the blue & gold crews on an
SSBN. And you want *good* living quarters and food/etc so they are
happy. 

At high tech levels it\'s *cheap*, but it\'s still cheaper to not make
runs back and forth. So what you lose in folks commuting, you\'ll gain
back in "tourists". The snob types who take a shuttle up to eat in the
restaurant so they can say "Oh yes, as I said to Charles last night up
in the \'Starview Lounge\'..."

BTW, it\'s *much* easier to trust the life support gear if the engineers
and their families are living on the station. Gives them that extra
reason to do the job right.

Oh yeah, if zero-g sex is at all good, expect *lots* of honeymooners in
the zero-g section of the hotel!

intelligent interstellat government is going to want to develop worlds and
systems closer to it\'s core then farther away.  The communications difficulties
inherient in Jump Drive mandate this really.
    Thinking on it in fact I wonder if a lot of those questionable worlds that
made no sense in the Hard Times Era weren\'t really Terraformation candidates.

    <SIGH> You\'ve got years so all you need to do is identify the appropriate
bergs and then NUDGE them into Holiman low energy transfer orbits.  I might
take the berg years to intercept the planet\'s orbit at the appropriate point...
but you HAVE decades.  Oh and why wouldn\'t you break the berg up on approach
into little fragments so you don\'t have huge impact, just lots of tiny ones
that don\'t seriously effect the planet.  The ones that burn up in the
atmosphere eventually percipitate out as rain and the ones that don\'t burn up
are in managable chunks on the ground.

    Nope, I think the MegaCorps could do it as a long term investment.  In fact
it would be in the Imperium\'s interest to encourage them.  I could easily see a
MegaCorp getting real interested in doing this if it had free and clear title
to the Terraformed world for say two or three centuries after the place was
certified as habitable.  The MegaCorp gets a real sweet deal too, not only do
they get to sell pieces of the planet at prime prices, they get to essentially
create a captive market and growing market, and as the putative goverment, they
get to pocket the taxes they collect!

- ---- PRESS RELEASE ----

  Mekhuriim industries is pleased to announce the public release of the
Kerzakhi class mercenary cruisers.

  Originally designed to meet the MIL-86725-R12 specification in the call
for designs issued by the Imperial Marine Corps, the Kerzakhi has been
redesigned for public use by licenced mercenary companies and corporate
security forces.

  When designing the Kerzakhi class, the special projects group at
Mekhuriim set several design goals:
  - The ability to deliver and deploy a complete light company of
    lift infantry and their support equipment.
  - High survivability in ground and space operations
  - Significant orbital bombardment and troop support abilities.
  - Atmospheric entry and landing.
  Every starship design is an exercise in compromises - and the Kerzakhi
is no exception. In order to meet their design goals, the design team
reduced the operational range of the ship, from the 3 parsec standard
of most mercenary cruisers to a more modest 2 parsec range. While some would
consider this a serious flaw in the ship\'s design, the team at Mekhuriim
believe that the Kerzahki class is a superior design, capable of superb
performance in its operational theatre. Studies into the possibilities
of supplmentary drop-tanks for longer ranges is being examined.

  The Kerzahki class may have a shorter range than most mercenary cruisers,
and its maneuver performance is the standard 2-Gs, but in most other
respects it is the equal or better to any design.
  To improve survivability, the Kerzakhi has an extremely durable armor
belt that exceeds even many imperial warships. The hull and structural
integretity of the ship have been reinforced to support over 20Gs of
acceleration - allowing the ship to absorb damage that would destroy ships
twice its size. The Kerzakhi mounts an impressive array of defensive systems:
twin ablative sand dispensers can provide anti-laser protection, a
single nuclear damper projector mounted on the bow can intercept nuclear
missiles, and the entire ship is protected with a meson decay field. To round
off the protective features of the ship, the Kerzakhi mounts a Shirgu QR-782
active EMS jammer array and the entire hull is equiped with EMM radiators and
other stealth features. When painted with BlackHole (tm) hull coating, the
Kerzakhi has impressive stealth performance, an important feature for ships
performing convert and/or surprise troop actions.
  While the Kerzakhi is not intended to be deployed in a space-combat arena,
the ship mounts a sizeable weapons grid. The primary long-range weapons are twin 
laser arrays mounted on the dorsal and ventral surfaces. The ship\'s missile 
batteries, while intended for orbital bombardment, can be loaded with standard
detonation laser missiles for space combat. The ship also mounts the new 
Milidyne RJ-720 1000Mj meson particle projector, which has extremely short range
but can inflict incredible damage upon ships without meson decay fields.
  The weaponry of the Kerzakhi was designed for orbital support missions, and
it meets the challenge extremely well. The meson projector, which some people
argue is nearly useless in space combat due to it\'s range, can perform surgical
meson strikes from orbit upon ground-based hard targets. The two missile batteries
can be loaded with orbital bombardment projectiles with a various number of
warheads, including FASCAM, MIRV-HEAP, and even (with proper permits) nuclear.
The Kerzahki\'s nuclear damper projector has sufficient range to perform
strategic damper support for troops on the surface, protecting the ground
forces from nuclear warheads and performing cleanups upon fallout zones.
  The primary purpose of the Kerzakhi is to deploy a light company (two 
platoons) of lift infantry into a planetary theatre. The Kerzahki typically
carries 86 troops, organized as follows:

                               +----+

  The complete order of battle includes 3 officers, 11 NCOs, 33 troopers,
14 vehicle crewmembers, 9 fighter pilots, and 9 dropship crewmembers. In
this configuration, the Kerzakhi carries 5 Maarmadin class assault landers
(2 landers equiped with Rish class APCs, 2 landers equiped with Rish
class APCs and Ishkiansus class recon sleds, and 1 lander equiped with
Kimbamgir class C3 command sled) and 10 Khuugli class strike fighters. This
arrangement allows the entire company to deploy as one unit and provides
ample air support for the ground troops. The strike fighter can also be
deployed in space to supplement the mothership\'s offensive weaponry.
  The small craft are all carried in the huge central hangar. Slips are
provided for 15 ten ton craft, and a hangar is also provided. The hangar
is intended to be used for weapon refitting and repairs, but it is possible
for the hangar to be used to hold an additional craft. Automated systems
can move a ship from it\'s slip to the hangar to be prepared for a drop.
  When outfitted in the above fashion, a squadron of two Kerzakhi class ships 
can transport an entire full company of lift infantry and their equipment.
  While the above order of battle is considered to be typical, it is possible
to outfit the ship\'s troops in other fashions.
  One common change is to assign one platoon to the jump capsules and
replace their APCs with Grav Tanks for additional firepower.
  Another possibility is do dispence with the flight wing altogether,
and add another platoon of troops. Note that in this configuration, the
Kerzakhi must either enter near orbit or land on the target world, as the
APCs contra-grav drives cannot operate in deep space. In this configuration,
a great deal of the flight deck is unused (over 50%). Extra space can be used 
stores.
  Recently, the ISS Radelagimdii was outfitted to carry an entire reinforced
company of grav tanks ( 25 Ghardak class grav tanks and crew ).
  The Kerzakhi is tight design, with even cubic meter of the ship in use. Space
is at a premium, so the majority of the crew and troops sleep in bunks. To
provide recreation for these individuals, there are 7 recreation/ready rooms
in the ship (1 for ship\'s crew, 1 for A Sectio, 1 for B Section, 1 for C Section,
1 for D Section, 1 for Fighter Squadron, 1 for Dropship Squadron). The ship has
a modest 8-bed medical bay, and engineering shops are available for ship and
small craft repair.

  Mekhuriim believes that the Kerzakhi class will be a fine addition to the
Mekhuriim fleet. Large order discounts available!

- ---- Design Notes ----
  First of all - sorry for the long post. But it sure is fun.
  For those who wish to know, I got the jump capsule stats from
Classic Traveller\'s Striker, which says that a capsule launcher is
1 std (14m3) and each ready capsule is .5 std (7m3).
  I took a bit of liberty in the layout of the hangar deck - I built
this as 15 10-ton docking rings (the slips) and 1 10-ton hangar. I
envision a huge room with ships hanging from racks, moved into place to
be worked upon and launched. I paid for all of the launch ports, but in
my mind there would be only 1 larger than normal port. I\'d allow 2, maybe
3 ships launch/land at a time. But technically, they\'re just 15 10-ton
rings.
  The price listed doesn\'t include small craft - I\'m not sure if the ships
in starships include their small craft in their price or not. If you include
the small craft, well, it goes up a bit :) The price with vehicles is
1343.235 MCr. The majority of the price increase is the fighters.

design I\'ve had percolating since I saw Star Wars last week: visualize a
handgun about 18" long, only 6" of which are actually barrel, with a laser
sight hanging off one side, a telescopic sight on the top, a bulge under
the barrel for the gyro comp, and a big box magazine forwards of the
pistolgrip.  Note the damage rating for HE rounds.

News Item, Sylean Gauss Enthusiasts Weekly, Year 0 Day 72

	"It was with some trepidation that this reporter ventured aboard
the Famille Spofulam conglomerate\'s orbital HQ to attend Famille Spofulam
Armaments\'  introduction of their new DH-1 "Blaster" gauss pistol.
Fortunately, the press buffet was up to Famille Spofulam\'s usual
megalomaniacal standards, which did much to allay my fears.

	After the wreckage of the buffet was cleared away, we were ushered
into a gleaming, spotless, hi-tech pistol range where Hengabar Spofulam
himself, the notorious CEO of the Famille Spofulam group awaited us, the
crisp lines of his business suit somewhat spoiled by an improbably large
holster strapped to his hip.

	A holovid presentation on the weapon followed.  The DH-1 Blaster
shows a typical Famille Spofulam lack of subtlety about its design; the
ridiculously huge dart, a full 15 mm X 75 mm and better suited to a VRF
gauss support weapon than a handgun, weighs a massive 7.06 grams.  The
rounds are so large, in fact, that they have to be carried in a large box
magazine mounted forwards of the triggerguard, which contains a mere eight
rounds.  The Blaster itself is ungainly; it is over 46 cm long, and weighs
a truly massive 4.2 kilograms.  And lovers of sleek, light, streamlined
gauss weapons will be horrified at the Blaster\'s aesthetics; a dull matte
black anodized finish does little to conceal the sheer ugliness of an
oversized weapon with a box magazine, a laser dot sight, an optic sight,
and an underbarrel gyro recoil compensator hanging off it.  It looks like
the sort of weapon the villains in bad tri-dee flicks carry.

	However, a brief demonstration of its capabilities proved that
there was a certain method to the usual Spofulam madness at work here.
After the presentation, the lights were raised back to normal, and a
curtain rose at the far end of the range.  It revealed a large melon,
perched precariously atop what appeared to be a plaster bust of notorious
industrialist Sir Arameth Gridlore.  Bracing the weapon with both hands,
and taking careful aim, Mr. Spofulam squeezed off a single round.  It was
then that the reason for the weapon\'s name became apparent; a 7-gram, 15mm
HE round travelling at 1,500 m/s makes for a truly impressive detonation
upon impact, especially when it impacts a plaster bust square between the
eyes.  White plaster dust and large fragments of the bust flew everywhere,
and the melon, riddled with fragments, crashed to the floor and shattered.

	Mr. Spofulam peered downrange, and muttered "Missed, dammit!""

The definition of species _is_not_ that they can breed and produce
fertile offspring, that is my point.  It\'s goofy, I know, but it\'s
true.

The real point of my post was that _Homo_erectus_ was named under
these naming conventions, so the fact that it has a different
species designation doesn\'t tell us a damn thing about how well we
could breed with it.  That make more sense?

No, due to the way species are named, it isn\'t.  You could have a
different species with two sufficiently different sub-populations if
they never bred simply because they never had the chance.  Odd, huh?

That\'s the trick, that isn\'t really the definition.  If we applied
that test, there would be many fewer species than we list now.
Also, you\'d have to use some kind of sub-species designation to
describe what critter you\'re talking about.
 
There are extant animals that are in 2 species even though they can
breed due to geographic isolation (breeding is possible in the lab,
but never happens in nature).

Well this isn\'t _quite_ true.  The reasons more people don\'t buy and fly
airplanes is not because the airframe technology hasn\'t kept up, or because
they\'re so expensive.  At least in the US, you can buy or make an airplane
for less than the cost of a car -- I have a friend who has just hand-built
a non-metallic carbon-fiber composite airplane for very little money
(hardly 1950s technology!).  The bottlenecks come in with training,
licensing, airport fees, and other forms of governmental and corporate
regulation.  Further, with the advent of a successful highway system, the
need for more complex and potentially dangerous local air traffic has been
markedly reduced.

But air rafts are *much* more powerful and versatile than we give them
credit.  Owning one would be something like owning a corporate jet, not a
fancy car.  You need to include in your campaign some more limited form of
enclosed air raft. I can\'t imagine that an enclosed air raft that has a
more limited range and cannot achieve orbit would need to cost so much;
surely on medium to high TL worlds there are local-travel air rafts that
cost more in the range of 5KCr to 10KCr.

It\'s expensive, but it\'s *much* faster than it is more expensive -- and
that can often make the difference.  Sea freight and even rail are
_painfully_ slow compared to air freight, and yet are not that much lower
in cost.

You also have to remember that a pilot has no cost of living.  Or rather
that he is given room and board in addition to his salary, so the lowest
paid pilot gets room and board plus 6,000Cr.

Try this on for size.  Why did cities grow up here in America?  One reason
was for the convenience of living in a city.  The population went with where
the work was, and there was (to some extent) a push by the Government to
move people into the cities.  Now, however, the rich move to the suburbs,
and the really rich move to estates in the country.

Apply that same to Orbital Facilities.  Immagine if you will that the
Government (or some private institution) decides to build an Orbital
Faciliy.  The reason doesn\'t really matter (it even doesn\'t matter if it is
an accurate assumption made by the builder, just that it is built).  This
may be the crux of your arguement, but I would remind you about the many
times Governments and Institutions have done something expecting a certain
result and not ending up with that result.  Lest use for this example an
observation facility built in medium orbit for governmental/scientific research.

Now we have an orbital facility with housing for a few scientists and the
tech heads that work on the equipment (both life support and the scientific
equipment).  Lets say that the Government sets up a six month tour of duty
for these guys.  Now, these scientists (or more likely the techies) are
married and are not really anxious to spend all this time away from home.
So the Government has a few options.
   1) Shuttle the people back and forth more often, or
   2) make room for the families on the orbital facility.

What will be cheapest in the long run?  Probably more room for families.  So
the families areas are added on.  Well, now you have not only scientists and
techies, but also housewives (and househusbands) and kids.  The kids will
need schooling, so add a school and teachers.  The housekeepers will want to
cook and clean and will need a place to buy the needed items, so add stores
and store employees.

As the place continues to grow, it would be similar to a city.  When it
became more normal to have people living on the station, it would become
something of a novelty.  Really the only problem is why the station was
built in the first place, and given government/business/institution\'s
seeming enjoyment of doing things without enough thought, or doing things
with one goal and not being able to accomplish that goal, even that problem
isn\'t a great one.

The semi-mythical Next Version of QSDS will include hulls that don\'t have
contra-grav built into them.  But most will still include CG Lifters.  Why?

> They also include such things as G-comp, etc, buty far and away the biggest
> thing as far as cost and energy consumption is the contra-grav, which

Here\'s my take on it, and the assumptions that were used to drive the QSDS
hull designs.

1) Thrust Plate maneuver drives provide thrust along a given axis; although
   the technology is radically different from other types of maneuver
   drives, the type of thrust produced and what you can do with that thrust,
   is the same as any other maneuver drive.
   
   In particular, Thrust Plates do NOT nullify gravity\'s effect on the ship,
   and cannot provide full thrust vectored in any direction.  Just like
   the other maneuver drives, the thrust plates must vector their thrust by
   a gimballed mounting, or by differential thrust.
   

2) Traveller starships typically have deckplans that are laid out in
   complete disregard for the axis of thrust of the ship.  Particularly for
   small civilian designs (such as the PCs typically have).  While I won\'t
   go into the philosphical question of wether Far Future engineers would
   actually do this, the fact remains that the bulk of the published
   deckplans have the decks parallel to the line of thrust of the ship.

   Even if such a ship were to land on it\'s drives (and most Traveller ships
   don\'t appear to be able to do so), the ship\'s gravity and local vertical
   would be 90 degrees away from the planet\'s gravity and local vertical.

3) In addition, Traveller starships (of just about any maneuver drive
   technology) regularly land on and take off from worlds where the surface
   gravity is greater than the ship\'s maneuver drive rating.  Most small
   commercial vessels have 1G drives, and many worlds of size 8+ will have
   surface gravities in excess of 1G.

4) Traveller starships seem to be able to pull cool maneuvers like we\'ve
   seen in the Star Wars movies (particularly in the new Special Edition
   where we see a lot more of the smooth, slow landings and take-offs).

I believe (and I designed QSDS in this belief) that the standard Imperial
solution to all of these problems is to include contra-gravity in all ship
hulls that are intended for planetary landing.


PLANETOID ships are created from hollowed-out planetoids (asteroids).  They
may not skim for fuel, and may not land on any world.  Attempting either
operation will likely destroy the hull.

UNSTREAMLINED ships are built witout regard for atmospheric effects.  Such
ships are generally built at orbital facilities, and are not usually
intended for plantary landings, and have no contra-gravity systems.
UNSTREAMLINED ships may not skim for fuel.  Unstreamlined ships may land on
airless worlds (atmosphere \'trace\' or less) if they are equipped with
contra-grav.  Unstreamlined ships witout CG may not land on any world
without risk, unless the designer specifically allows for planetary
landings, and the ship\'s maneuver rating is greater than the planet\'s
surface gravity.

STREAMLINED ships have all projections faired over, and have an
aerodynamically "clean" exterior.  Streamlined ships are generally designed
with planetary landings in mind, and are usually eqiupped with CG Lifters.
STREAMLINED ships may skim for fuel and may land on any world (regardless of
atmosphere), if they are equipped with contra-grav.  Streamlined ships without
contra-grav may skim for fuel (but risk damage on a skimming mishap), and may
safely land on worlds where the ship\'s maneuver rating is greater than the
world\'s surface gravity, if specifically provided for by the designer.

AIRFRAME ships are designed with aerodynamic lifting and control surfaces,
so that the ship can fly through an atmosphere.  Airframe ships are
generally designed with planetary landings in mind, and are usually equipped
with contra-grav.
AIRFRAME ships may skim for fuel and may safely land on any world (regardless
of atmosphere), if they are equipped with contra-grav.  Airframe ships without
contra-grav may skim for fuel (but risk damage on a skimming mishap), and
may safely land on worlds with an atmosphere (\'thin\' or better) regardless
of maneuver drive performance.

Attempting an unsafe operation (that is, one that\'s not listed as safe above)
is a risky and dangerous thing to do.  The referee should call for task rolls
appropriate to the situation (landing an unstreamlined ship in a standard
atmosphere on a calm, clear summer day is easier than trying to bring it down
safely through a hurricane).  Apply common-sense when assesing the results of
a failed roll - severe damage to the ship, injuries to the occupants, or even
destruction of the ship are possible.

Skimming for fuel is a routine operation for ships with contra-grav.  The
referee should generate tasks as appropriate, but usually the worst-case is
that the ship aborts the skimming run.  Ships without contra-grav are at
risk during skimming.  Although the chance of a mishap is the same, the
consequences of a failed run can be more severe.  It is much harder to abort
a bad run, and the ship may suffer damage or even destruction before it is
clear of the gas giant\'s atmosphere.

over this part.  If you have, here\'s a reason why I don\'t believe their
explanation.

In the starship operators\' book, DGP\'s writers proposed that thrust-plate
maneuver drives were capable of vectoring their thrust in any direction,
without having to be gimballed, though thrust in other directions was at
lower efficency.  In addition, they postulated that the drives could be
over-powered by up to 1000% (yes, ten times) for at least long enough to
land the ship.

This raises several questions.  Aside from the obvious question of where the
maneuver drive is going to get the power (most Traveller ships don\'t have
power plants capable of this kind of output), there are questions of how long
the plates can keep it up.  But the most important question has to do with
combat: in Traveller, evasion is based on the ship\'s maneuver rating and
G-complensation.  A ship evades by making short burns by the ship\'s main
drive, so that the ship is Somewhere Else (if only by a few meters) by the
time a shot aimed at it actually arrives.

With DGP\'s version of the thrust-plates, any ship with a 1G drive could
easily evade at 10Gs (or more likely the limit of it\'s G-compensation).
This would allow a 1G fat trader to evade shots as easily as a 6G destroyer
(since G-compensation is the limiting factor for how much thrust can be used
for evasion).

Trying to plug this whole opens up the possibility of other problems.
Instead of doing that, I came to the conclusion that most Traveller
starships have contra-gravity lifters installed.

True enough, 300k years back is archaic sapiens, unless you buy the
indonesian find that claims to be ~30k for an erectus.

0.3MYA could be neandertal as well (maybe), and the oldest (other
than that new paper at 0.03MYA) erectus is ~0.4MYA, so it\'s
up for grabs.  Regardless, I be modern humans could have sucessful
offspring with any of the above if they chose to try :-)

Great!  BTW: the increase of thruster prices is to bring QSDS into line with
SSDS; it was an error on my part that there were so low in the first place
(one of those cubic-meter to displacement-ton conversion errors).

To try and avoid that, I\'m going more carefully with QSDS 2.x, doing all my
calculations in cubic meters (converting to dtons for output only), and
cross-checking the results with QSDS 1.5.

Actually, that\'s pretty good!  There\'s also a trade-off in transit time,
particularly to and from worlds in "deep" gravity wells (large stars, where
the 100-diameter limit is significantly outside the main world\'s orbit). 
With reasonable HEPlaR fuel volumes, the transit from the jump point to the
world (which can be many AUs) can take longer than the jump took.

I like having the designer have to make a trade-off like this.

That makes a LOT of sense, and I\'d recommend it to THUDDD for their
economic calculations.  It makes absolutely no sense to skim for fuel at a
gas giant (particularly if you\'ve got a HEPlaR m-drive), but it makes a lot
of sense to buy unrefined fuel and refine it yourself.

	Actually, what I have in mind for my mini-campaign is that after 
the K\'kree quickly conquered this corner of K\'kree space, they started 
exterminating the populations of a couple of worlds. This IMMEDIATELY 
brought revolts in all of the other conquered Vargr worlds that were very 
messy to put down. So thiss made them rather wary of this route.

	As well, even if they did exterminate them, they didn\'t have 
anyone else to settle these planets. So the K\'kree are involved in a 
rather unsuccessful attempt at winning the "hearts and minds" of their 
Vargr subjects (and having about as much success as the Americans did in 
Vietnam).

hehehe. I\'ll have to keep that one in mind...

actually, though, If I remember my V&V book, the Vargr mostly eat raw 
meat. But the idea is still good.

	Well, I don\'t think this is entirely true. If you look at the 
ingredients of your average dog food, actual meat or meat by-products are 
in the minority. AS well, if you start highly processing food, I\'m sure 
the Vargr could survive on an all-vegetarian diet.

	Would it be tasty? Ahhh, now thats a different question.

	Well, I figured that Imperial humans (I\'m not to sure of the

This is the reason that I included a cheaper stripped down variant of the
ship with my design.  However, it seems that my entry became mangled.  The
stripped down version was missing along with the ship\'s description and some
random thoughts.  My design\'s USD was also subjected to some reformatting
that oddly included replacing dt, my preferred abbreviation for displacement
ton, with Sdt.  BTW Guy Garrnett\'s recommended abbreviation for displacement
ton is Std. Personally I don\'t care for Std because it\'s a common
abbreviation for "standard" by itself.

It seems that I also made a few mistakes with the design, most notable being
the jump drive.  It seems that I installed a Jump 3 drive instead of a Jump 2
drive as I intended, Doh!  I think I will just leave the ship with a Jump 3
drive even though it carries only 2 parsecs of fuel.  Anyways, the corrected,
and complete, ship is online (http://users.aol.com/ogerdude/mercru.htm).

Since, the ship is capable of making planet fall and has facilities for grav
vehicles I didn\'t see any reason to have yet a third way to land troops. 
From a role playing point of view I think it\'s better to have a ship near
that action that just hanging around in orbit.  Anyone remember the CT
adventure "Broadsword," despite the ship being unstreamlined much of the
adventure deals with the ship down on the planet.

Actually, Brazil stopped producing VW Beetles (called Fuscas) in circa
1988, iirc. They still make them in Mexico, tho\'.

As you note below though, it *still* is much more expensive for a
corresponding "average" Brazilian family to afford a brand new car,
since wages are still much lower.

However, since the gap between the poor and the wealthy is so high
(there is virtually no middle class) Auto dealers can still do a brisk
business selling to the elite.

That\'s not the only reason Brazilian cars are so much cheaper. Brazilian
automotive laws are a lot more "lax" than corresponding North American
laws.

About 10 years ago when I was in Brazil, I learned that over 200
modifications had to be made to a car Brazil exports to North America,
the "Fox" (aka Voyage), in order for it to meet American laws. (Side
running lights, for example)

Let me state first off that I am not wedded to the basic 6 stats, I just
like them better than most sets of similar size.  SOC is still the one that
I am most likely to demote, as I like every stat to be good when high, and
bad when low, and there are times where low SOC is better than high SOC.

I make two assumptions about EDU to make the present system work.

1.  There are no stats that are entirely inborn at TL12.  Thus, even though
reasoning and ability to organize are both presently inborn skills, over
the next few centuries, they will find a way to make someone a better
scholar.  Pureed cloned PhD brain, perhaps.  Perhaps special memory training.

2.  The parts of understanding a "thinking" task are how well you reason,
and how many things you know that might apply to the problem.  Skill
implies domain knowledge, INT implies general reasoning ability, and EDU
implies knowing related facts, how to search your references, how to adjust
for the personality of someone else\'s newsgroup posting, and knowing of the
existence of obscure sources of information that you can use.

As a result, the EDU you get in college is a tremendous boost.  Worth more
than the skills, in many ways, as it _does_ help you in lots of different
ways.  (As a result, I have toned down how much of it you get in college.)
I presume that all characters in Traveller have had a basic reference desk
dumped into their heads if they have a high EDU.  They still do not have
the skill to apply the information, but they do know lots and lots of
details, or how to get those details with the references they have.

>How would you relate that high EDU to [the trading situation]?

The guy who got lots of EDU has many, many facts in his head.  Without
specific trader skill, he has little idea how to apply any of these
factoids.  Raw reasoning might help, but this particular task demands
domain knowledge.

If he has some domain knowledge, he has been taught how to use the data in
his head and in his hand computer properly.  Assume at least a
Trader/Broker-1.

By getting the high EDU in grad school, he had his ability to understand
complicated relationships between data improved.  This lets him draw better
conclusions from the factoids he has.  For an EDU-7, this might be a
newspaper article he read in the financial section.  For an EDU-15, it
might be the week he happened to spend wandering through a trade library on
Sylea.  Why?  Because he was writing accounting software, and happened to
need an obscure face.  While getting it, he stumbled on a lot of general
information about the goods in question, and remembers the general
information, and how to get more.

Not perfect, I know, but it justifies EDU.  I like the idea of splitting
intellect and ability to organize facts in a useful way.  I have met people
who can do one but not the other often enough.

	Allright, I\'ve just about had enough. This is a Traveller digest, 
not comp.os.os2, or alt.nuke.bill.gates.with.1c.rocks, or whatever else.

	I understand the problems people are having with MS Mail - 
especially as I had some of those same problems. But when this comes up, 
is you could calmly tell the person with the winmail.dat attachments how 
to solve the problem, and then move on to REAL discussions. Like why is 
it that M0 and FS still haven\'t shown up in Canda?!?!?!?!

	Oh, I\'m not picking on you Eris. There have been WAY too many of 
these kinds of messages filling up my mail box, and they really have no 
place on the TML.

It\'s a slang term for an old method of forcibly removing someone from a
country or planet by first changing their gender by feeding them huge
amounts of estrogen.  The desire to watch a lot of old Tom Cruise movies is
often an odd side-effect of this barbaric treatment.

You could probably just as easily use the system from AMBER Diceless

course that system doesn\'t use dice--our intrepid GM would have to
_decide_ what happens off the cuff.

My personal favorite system is the Albedo Anthropomorphics RPG (like
traveller, but all vargr/aslan).  The stats there are Strength,
Endurance, Manual Dex, Coordination, Reason, Intuition, Drive and
Stability.  Education is merely the sum of your formal training.

Face it, the reason we have the EDU stat is that Mark Miller and company
designed this system in the 70\'s and it seemed a good idea then.
EDU/SOC would let you have a foppish baronial fool who fail all of his
classes or comes from a backward planet (high SOC, low EDU) or a very
smart hobo (high EDU, low SOC).  However it does seem to assume that
Education is a very formal affair.

The armor rating listed for the Warrior may be a misunderstanding on my
part of the scale to be used in the THUDD entries. Per Starships, in SSDS
the numerical armor rating is converted to the USP rating code. The Warrior
has a numerical armor value of 80 which converts to a USP rating of 3. (An
USP armor rating of 30 would correspond to a armor numerical value of
15,000+ or 36,270 m^3 of armor on an 8,400 m^3 ship. Did I miss a
redefinition of armor rating or is this a difference between the QSDS and
SSDS designs?

I would normally agree with Mark\'s general comment "I especially like the
idea of having a meson gun - no missiles to run out of, ...." I debated
between missiles and a meson gun or similar weapon. In the end, my decision
to include missiles was based on a desire to include a non-line-of-sight
weapon in the ship\'s inventory to provide ground support. This is a
significant advantage both from orbit (when the ship is over the other side
of the planet) and on the ground to fire at an enemy over the ridge.
Constraining a fire support ship to remain at a fixed geosynchronous
position limits its combat options.

Mark did hit on the design goal of the Warrior, cheap (I hate to use the
word "expendable" in front of the troops.) It is intended to land the
troops near the front lines, provide close-in fire support and a mobile
strong point with quarters, hot meals, and medical care (hence the "small"
airframe design), and be ready to transport the entire company off planet
on short notice. I did toy with a "battlerider" design in which the carrier
would remain in orbit while non-starship riders containing the troop\'s
quarters, some weapons, etc. would land on the planet. I still have some
questions about such designs in T4.

Please keep the comments coming. I feel my merc cruiser design is far from
optimum and plan to revise it as new ideas develop. Maybe we should
consider another THUDD cycle after we have gone through all of the ship
types to take advantage of the suggestions and comments.

	The statement that most interstellar governments are going to 
want to colonize the worlds closest to their homeworld first is very 
true. That leads me to oneof my very small personal beefs with Traveller 
background:

	When looking at a map of the 1st Imperium, why is it the Vilani 
got all the way to the Solomani Rim Sector, but only explored half of 
Corridor, which was RIGHT NEXT DOOR?!?!?



	Well, has anyone ever though of any logical explanation for this 
very bizarre pattern of Vilani settlement?

   Sometimes, certainly. More often not, though.  Usually, transport in
   even a 1G non-starship will be extremely fast (and quite cheap and
   safe to boot), and should make for no problems going to or from

	They are H. sapiens, specifically Homo sapiens neanderthalensis.
The argument is whether or not they were a side branch or on the direct
lineage to modern H. sapiens sapiens.

	Neanderthals lived between 40-120,000 years ago.  There has been
some arguement over "classic" neanderthals versus "progressive"
neanderthals (which have been reclassified as just archaic H.sapiens, and
in some cases as H. sapiens sapiens.

	H. erectus died out about 300,000 years ago.  H. heidelbergensis
was a name for a regional form of H. erectus.  H. rudolfensis was a name
for a *much* earlier form.

	Archaic Homo sapiens is a good call for a form 300,000 years ago.
The literature pretty much agrees on this, although you get into regional
debates 100,000-200,000 in Africa and Asia concerning the next form.

	But who cares <g>.

	Laterish!

   I would not be too quick to make that assumption, as the world data

	Zoology and paleontology/physical anthopology use different

	Yes, we are.  We are just a different sub-species, based on
anatomical differences (changes in robusticity, cranial capacity, shoulder
morphology, frontal lobes and speech areas.

	Again, paleontology/physical anthropology uses a different set of
criteria for determination of species.  The hominid form seen over the
last 300,000 years or so has been one species, which has included a
variety of different sub-species.  We probably could interbreed with
earlier H. erectus, although we have classified them as a different
species.  Some researchers (Wolpoff? Stringer?  I can\'t remember.)  put
forth one species designation for all hominid forms from 1.5 mya to today.

Um, dude, we\'re aiming at Microsoft, here.  What\'s your point?  Are you
really so squeamish that you balk at reducing Terra to glowing vapor and
drifting rubble to nail Mr. Bill?

  Gee, and I thought some of the other designs were excessive!  This is
really a warship with some troops aboard, as I commented about an earlier
design.  With vehicles, it\'s by far the most expensive, and still offers
only J2 M2.  I think the armor and especially the Meson Screen are way
over the top for the design criteria.  On the other hand, if i could
afford it, as a player character it\'s the design I\'d like to be in in a
fight.  Overall, interesting, but too expensive.

Ooooh, Interesting.  Modular, flexible, upgradable.

Perhaps the next THUDD list of designs could include an Imperial Marine
Assault Transport of say, 10,000 tons; this would allow a jump tender with
spinal mopunt and defensive weapons and 4-6 "drop Ships" (I hate that
term) or "Landers" of 1000 to 3000 tons and a bunch of 20dt gunships for
escort and fire support.

The thing is, that (for ex) 2000 ton landing ship could either carry an
assault force of 100 Marines behind big armor and heavy weapons or a
resupply force of 200 marines behind light armor and sand, or 1800 tons of
supplies behind no armor or a mobile field hospital with big red crosses
or a support boat with a meson gun and a bunch of guided missiles, 
sensors and jamming suite, another with...well, you get the idea - modular
multipurpose landers for Marine units (or reg. army - we\'ll let them have
em too).

And, to make us logicians more excited yet, the tender can carry any mix
of these modules, any mix at all.  No more shall the freighters with
supplies be back in the fleet train when they are needed over the planet
*right now*, they will be part of the primary assault package, right in
there with the best defended units.    

Neat idea, no Douglas you can\'t have one.

Peninsula, you\'ll probably sink SFO and I\'ll be out of a job!

My thoughts exactly.  I strongly suspect that interstellar colonization
projects using "slow" multi-generation "space arks" would often end up
producing "space gypsies" - if you\'ve spent you\'ve spent your entire life
aboard a clean, comfortable starship (and so did your parents, and their
parents) why would you want to expose yourself (and your children, and
their children), to the surface of a planet, where it\'s often either too
cold or too hot, water falls from the sky and gets everything wet, and the
food grows in nasty dirt with bugs and worms in it?  Everything you need
is out there in space.

Thanks.

Post this on the list for me. Feel free to hack it apart.

       Merchant Prince  v 1.0

In the spirit of Trillion Credit Squadron(TCS), Merchant Prince(MP) is a 
challenge to design a subsector wide merchant company. TCS promotes the 
creation of battle fleets for wargame style combat. MP promotes trade 
and roleplaying. The goal is to setup a subsector wide company to 
support the trading needs of a subsector. This is a rough idea which 
could use the help of the Traveller list. Here are the basic rules:

	1)  Select Traveller Era.  This provides the setting for the 
company. The differences between CT, MT, TNE, and T4 provide a varitity 
of different companies. In MT armored traders would be common during the 
rebellion. In TNE a RCSS merchant would use parts from different traders 
to make a single ship.

	2) Select a Subsector of Operation.  Merchant prince is a local 
trading company. They service many worlds but trade on a sector scale.

	3) Ship Design.  Each would be prince has a trillion credits for 
ship construction. Ship size should be limited to 1000 tons or less. 
There are a number of ship classes need for a successful business.
		Small craft: under 100 tons, for in-system transport of 
goods.
		Traders: to move goods.
		Liners: to move people.
		System defense boats: including patrol cruisers and 
escorts. These vessels are need to safe guard against piracy.
		Raiders:  to disrupt a rival company\'s shipping. 
		Speculative Trader: ships used to locate new trade 
routes.

	4)  Select a Major Race. A merchant prince must decide who works 
in the company. Vargar traders might prefer raiding. A Zhodani trader on 
the border of imperial space has to over come distrust to succeed.

	5)  Establish Trade Routes. How does you company service the 
subsector trading needs?

	6)  Evaluation. Put two companies in the same subsector and 
compete for trade. Roleplay a ship captain serving the company.

	7)  Benefit.  Once you have an established company you have a 
great tool for use in roleplaying.   

(Plus a quick addendum he sent me today. I was supposed to post this 
yesterday, but I got kaswamped with a ton of stuff, and it got put 
off \'till today. Bruce)

Here are some items for the merchant prince idea:

Ship Type - smuggler: a trader modified to conceal contraband goods
Evaluation -  system customs authority vs smugglers or pirates

If spherical, the ship would be 140 meters in diameter.  Try getting that
to sit on a landing pad.  Sure, with CG it would be fine, but if the CG
went out it would likely sink pretty deep into the ground.  Also, I would
imagine that actually building such a ship would be *much* easier in
orbit. 

If we assume that most of the Imperium\'s main trade routes are serviced by
large bulk carriers then orbital docks are necessary, in addition to
highly useful for customs and quarantine purposes.

Notes on this chart:

There are two things to remember, as a GM, when using this system.  
First, whenever Spectacular Failure is figured into these numbers, 
they will come down--significantly at the high end.

For example, in KBv1.1, we used the standard T4 method of rolling 
SF--that is SF occurrs whenever two 6\'s are rolled.

This brought down rolls for Impossible tasks by close to 20%.  If we 
were to use that system here, there would be over a 50% chance that 
SF will be rolled on an Impossible task.  That means that 
over half of all tasks attempted in the Impossible category 
would result in spectacular failure, and the highest 
percentage chance for success would be below 50%.  Clearly, that is 
too high, so we must choose another system.

But the point is that, since we are rolling so many dice, the SF 
percentage (once we nail it down) will reduce the percentage of 
success on this chart--especially at the high end.

Another thing to consider is that this system was designed to 
accomodate skill levels of 0-8 or so.  From my poll, it seems that 
most agree that level 8 is an incredible number.

I believe that the CharGen system in T4 is somewhat broken in that 
characters are able to obtain level 9 skills and above--straight out 
of CharGen.

It is also my belief that Marc realizes this problem and is 
attempting to fix that in the revised edition of T4.

Given this, I have designed KBv2.0 for skill levels 0-8.

Check out Eris\' definition of each skill level.  I agree 100% with 
the value Eris has assigned to each skill level.

Any comments are welcome.

That\'s funny, I thought it was the barbaric punishment of forcing the

to KBv1.1.

Both the KB task systems are skill based, and they reward high skill 
level as indicated here.  The T4 task system is attribute based, 
which rewards a high attribute.

There are two problems with an attribute based system.  One is that, 
if you have a high attribute, with an attribute based system, you are 
good in a multitude of tasks.  For instance, if you have a high Dex, 
your character is awesome in shooting a gun, piloting a starship, 
wearing Battle Dress, dancing, riding a horse, driving an air/raft, 
picking a lock, or throwing a dagger.  

All of these are widely varied types of tasks.  I believe that a 
skill based system is a better approach to the task system because it 
allows a character to be good at one of these tasks (because he has a 
high skill level) and not be so good at a different task.

For instance, I think that it is highly possible for a person to be 
very good at driving a car but horrible at dancing.  Skill based 
systems fix this, and that\'s why both the KB systems are skill based.

The second problem with attribute based systems is that they do not 
give enough credence to a character\'s expertise.

This comparison of a character with Pilot-4, Dex-6 to a character 
with Pilot-1 and Dex-10 is a bit worn out, but it is still a good 
example of what I\'m talking about.  For those of you who haven\'t seen 
this explanation, I\'ll repeat it here.

If you use an attribute based system (that is, the attribute is 
weighted more than the skills are in calculating the target number), 
you end up with this problem:

	In T4, your target number for the Pilot-4 character is 10 while your 
target number for the Pilot-1 character is 11--giving him a better 
chance at piloting the ship than the person with much more skill.

Attribute does count for something, and this is true in both the KB 
task systems, but when comparing a skill level 4 character to a skill 
level 1 character, there should be no comparision.  Skill level 4 is 
expert.  Skill level 1 is beginner.

Attributes count, but training and experience count for more.

In CharGen, skill based systems put the emphasis on skill, not 
attributes, like it should be.

With an attribute based system, someone with a level 5 skill is 
someone to cock your eyebrow at.  In a skill based system, someone 
with a level 5 skill is someone to be feared.  



OK, one more character to compare:




Bill the Beginner			Stat-12
							Skill-1


			KBv2.0				KBv1.1				T4
			(TN 15)				(TN 8)				(TN 13)
Easy		100%				94.444%				100%
Average		95.37%				72.222%				100%
Difficult	66.435%				42.593%				96.296%
Formidable	30.517%				25.926%				83.796%
Staggering	9.6472%				5.4012%				62.191%
Impossible	2.2087%				0.7202%				44.367%


The problem with the T4 task system is glaring here--the 
percentages are way too high at the high end.  If you have 
noticed, the KBv2.0 system gives a little higher percentages than 
the KBv1.1 system on most of these examples.  I like this.  I 
always felt that KBv1.1 was a little severe, but there was no easy 
way to fix it.  KBv2.0 gives percentages that are not too high but 
are a little more forgiving than KBv1.1.

After all, we want to make it challanging for our players, but we 
like to see them succeed too.

Also notice that, although KBv2.0 is a skill based system, the 
attribute plays a big part in the target number.  In this example,
Bill will have to reach skill level 4 before his skill will contribute
as much to his success as his natural ability.

Given this, I think that KBv2.0 gives a good balance in the skill vs
attribute debate.



Any comments or further examples about KBv2.0 are welcomed.



Now, it is time to work on a SS/SF system.

	This is a pretty strong statement.  It is certainly not true in 
many cases today and based on the Traveller background, I don\'t think it 
is true in M:0 either.  If this is true, then the economic justification 
for empire takes a serious blow.  Given the rapidly expanding economy of 
M:0 and the many new opportunities for investment, I think the cost of 
capital (interest rate) will be fairly high.  This implies that 
production technologies which replace capital with labor will be 
favored.  This will be further reinforced by all the clamoring hordes on 
low-tech worlds which want hi-tech goods and will be willing to work for 
far less than the citizens of hi-tech worlds.
	Transport costs will be a moderating factor here, since 
high-bulk, low value cargoes will not be worth transporting.  Note that 
the "canonical" 1000Cr/ton freight cost is much too high.  It is possible 
to design shipping systems that can move carge at less than 500Cr/ton.

	This will only happen if 3I capital markets are very screwed up.  
Given the large communication lags, this is actually likely.  
Nevertheless, an enterprising investor would recognize the tremendous 
gains to the TL6 world of having that powerplant and loan them the money 
- -- assuming of course, that they have something to pay him back with.  
Natural resources, land, whatever.
	I think you overestimate the GNP gains from tech advances when 
you suggest that any Sylean could outbid an entire TL6 government.  
However, if you assume that, it actually makes my above scenario even 
more likely since it increases the available pool of lendors.

	One thing to do is to look at the GNP per capita growth in this 
century, which spans several tech levels.  The U.S. would actually be a 
poor example since it had a great deal of underutilized natural resources 
to fuel growth.  Take a look at a European country, like Germany, 
Britain, or France.  This should give a rough estimate of GNP growth per 
tech level.

	Certainly.  This also has historical analogues in 19th and early 
20th century economic colonialism.  Oil companies in the Mid-East, United 
Fruit in Central America, etc.  Note that no matter how many TLs behind a 
world is, it can probably still produce useable agricultural exports.
	Lastly, low-tech worlds may trade with mid-tech worlds which trade
with hi-tech worlds.  (Example:  Brazil exports automobiles to Sub-Saharan
Africa.) This does not even mean that low-tech worlds are getting
second-hand goods. The fact that the LT world has exports that _somebody_
values means that their local currency will be convertible into "hard" 
currency.  If the volume of trade is not sufficient to maintain a currency
market then merchants may have to make all the trades themselves. 
Example: Our intrepid free traders sell a Fusion+ unit to LT world and get
local currency in return. They use this currency to buy somethig from LT
world, food, raw materials, consumer goods, etc.  which would not interest
a Sylean, but which is valued on a MT world.  They sell their goods to the
MT world and buy something from them that is valued on Sylea, assembled
hi-tech goods, refined materials, simple consumer goods, etc.  They take
these goods to Sylea where they sell them for Imperial Credits which they
use to buy Fusion+ units....  Voila!  The Invisible Hand (in the form of
the players) has triumphed and a triangular trade is born.

	You\'re not the first person to suggest that making landings in 
g-carriers rather than shuttles is somehow a disadvantage.  I must 
confess that this makes no sense to me.  From my perspective making your 
landing in grav APCs is a _good_ thing since the troops are in several 
armored vehicles rather than one or two unarmored shuttles.  And once you 
hit the ground you can start shooting rather than having to go through 
that vulnerable unloading phase.
	Would someone care to explain to me what I\'ve missed?

Pestilence.

\'Use of Weapons\' was the first book in a long time that I got to the end,

  Looks like it - the QSDS hull list gives the numerical armor rating, not
the USP code.  If your ship has an armor of 80, well, that\'s pretty well
armored by QSDS standards - most hulls have on 10 or 20 armor, and the max
is 60 (for an 800T sphere, by the way).  I\'d call it over-armored by the
standards of the CT Happy Fun Ball.

  Well, Meson guns can fire _through_ planets, so no need to be in geo
orbit.  You just need local forward observers to guide onto target.  Meson
guns are inhibited by screens, but since Mercenary cruisers are not likely
to take on TL12 opponents, that\'s not a big issue.

  Nice concept, but I\'m just uncomfortable with something that expensive
on the ground.  The big money is in the hull, drives, powerplant, and
electronics - why put that in harms way?   Better to shuttle the troops
down in something less expensive, and keep the ship upstairs where it
might be safer (though I\'d be willing to entertain arguements about that).

  This is really what the CT Happy Fun Ball is all about - those modular
cutters could carry some additional modules as compared to the ones in
Starships, including living quarters and such.

  Sounds good to me - I for one would like to chat more about what exactly
the weaponry a mercenary cruiser should have.  Comments, anyone?

  Nice idea, but it would leave us QSDS users out in the cold.  How about
a budget thing, along Trillion Credit Squadron lines, with so much money
and so many troops to deliver, and one could then put a group of ships
together.  I\'d prefer to put this off, though - THUDDD still has plety of
classic ships to redesign.

This is an *excellent* idea. In fact, something similar (but somewhat
smaller in scope) was suggested in gdw-beta a while ago - a competetion to
design the cheapest way to haul (say) 10,000 T/week between two systems.

In fact, I would suggest starting out with something smaller on that sort
of scale, rather than a whole subsector...for either case, we\'d need
good rules for upkeep costs, crew salaries, how much vacation your
crew *really* needs, how much maintenance your jump drive *really* needs,
and of course realistic quantities of goods and prices. Also rules for
frequencies of disasters (major or minor misjumps, piracy, engine failure) so
one can evaluate how cost-effective things like backup fuel tanks and
weapons are...) 

This would help to answer questions like the cost-effectiveness of space 
stations for cargo transhipment...and the cost-effectiveness of some of
the really exotic designs proposed on gdw-beta, like container ships, or
jump-drive-only ships, and transhipment stations at the 100-diameter limit...

For cargo transhipment, there\'s no particular need for a space station, even
for unstreamlined ships. It\'s not like the cargo hauler has to wait around
a long time for a shuttle - cargo haulers are big and take weeks to travel,
shuttles are small and take hours; when a jump-but-not-landing-capable
shuttles will leave from and return directly to the planet. (Think of a
big, busy modern port like Hong Kong. Most big container ships can\'t dock
right at a wharf - due to lack of wharf space and (to a lesser extent) depth
of water. Container ships in Hong Kong anchor out in the harbour and are
unloaded by barges. Building a space station to unload cargo makes as much
sense as building a giant floating platform in the middle of Hong Kong harbour
would - not much.)

For manufacturing/industry/lifestyle - power is cheap in a space station,
but it\'s just as cheap on the ground; fusion (let alone fusion+) is much
cheaper than solar power. Resources are plentiful in the asteroid belt,
but it\'s cheap to transport them down to the ground - much cheaper than
doing construction in zero-G and vacuum.

The technological assumptions of the Traveller universe - extremely
cheap power, and extremely cheap access to orbit with reactionless drives - 
are about the worst possible case for space stations, except for really
specialized cases like (small) research stations, sensor platforms, and
weapons platforms.

In my view of the world, one of the primary advantages of a meson gun is
that it *is* an indirect-fire (non-LOS) weapon.  The same trick that lets
meson guns fire through armor, or from buried deep sites on a planet,
allows them to fire through bunkers, mountains, or even a significant
chunk of a planet...perhaps *all* of one, based on some canon statements
about deep-meson sites. 

Meson guns are also the ideal space/ground interface weapon for another
reason.  Lasers get badly diffused by any significant stretch of
atmosphere; PA guns of the space type (N-PAWS) can\'t fire effectively in
atmosphere, and of the atmospheric type (C-PAWS) can\'t fire effectively in
space.  Missiles take time to reach the target, give warning of their
approach, and can be shot down by point-defense systems.  Only meson guns
allow instantenous attacks, counterable by only one high-tech defensive
technology (not widely deployed in typical lowish-tech mercenary
environments), and unaffected by atmosphere between you and the target. 

Additionally and uniquely, meson guns are non-LOS and can fire through
solid materials to hit their target.  That\'s why deep meson sites are the
ideal planetary defense, and ship-born meson guns the ideal planetary
attack weapon.

Except, perhaps, for near-c rocks.

I have a copy but I don\'t own the rights, so I can\'t legally photocopy it.
Roger Sanger (rodge@cyberspace.com), current owner of the DGP material,
would be the guy. He\'s apparently trying to get approval from IG to put all
the old stuff on CD ROM, so if they ever stop quibbling, you may eventually
be able to get a copy of the MTJ #4 campaign setting on CD.

It\'s really great. Happens in Gateway sector, a remote sector right between
the 3rd Imperium and the Two Thousand Worlds.

I\'d plan to conduct a campaign there after my epic Regency mercenary
campaign if I wasn\'t already committed to do something in the Solomani Rim
first! (Love those Terra-based campaigns!)

first was the Ridcully Far Trader which was a late design and so didn\'t get
voted on, but i am still interested in anybodies comments on it, so that i
can improve the design or fix  any problems in my understanding of how QSDS

As for Voting i\'m going to abstain on voting on design comps untill i feel
confident on what im doing.

	Well, I was basically aiming for something that\'d be the Gauss
equivalent of a .50 cal Desert Eagle with the 14" barrel, with a laser
sight and scope for good measure; something so ludicrously over the top

	Yes, FFS! The weapons designed system has long been recognized to
be very broken at the extreme ends of the scale, and as usual for a FSH
design, this one\'s off the deep end ;-)

	I took a quick hack at designing this in 3G3, (btw I HIGHLY
recommend this one...I bought the Adobe Acrobat version with the
spreadsheets...$12.00, and I had the stuff in my hands almost
instantly...If I could have ALL my gaming supplements in this fashion I
could have my library at home and here at work. I REALLY want that
Traveller CD IG\'s rumored to be working on.) and ended up with an even
heavier weapon, at 7.5 kg, over double the barrel length, at 37 cm.

I haven\'t played with a Gauss design in quite a while (my last effort ws a
TL-15 Aslan specialty weapon, based on the thing that the alien had in
Predator)

 BTW Greg Porter has an illuminating discussion of railguns (what he
calls gauss weapons) in 3G3, in the part called \'Past the limits\'
where he talks about the design of a railgun to put a 1m diameter round
into orbit, needing 119,000 G of acceleration.

0 to 1500 m/s in a distance of .15 m is roughly 10,000 gee of
acceleration.

this is an absurd gun by ANY stretch of the imagination, and a worthy (?)
addition to the FSH catalog.

It\'s a part of the conversion that\'s missing from SSDS.  The T4 "basic"
starship combat system wants starship armor values that are equal to the
SSDS conversion chart value TIMES TEN.  QSDS pre-computes this for you; in
SSDS the relevant sentance is missing, unfortunately.

The correct computation is:
1) Convert SSDS armor value to USP using the table
2) Multiply by 10 to produce the final Armor rating.

Example: The Warrior has a SSDS armor value of 80, which converts to a USP
         rating of 3 (by the table).  Multiply by 10, for a final rating of
         30.  This is the value you put in the final USP listing for Armor.

In the T4 "basic" starship combat system, a ship with an armor value of 3
won\'t last very long at all - even a thin-skinned Free Trader has AV 10.

I was talking with a fellow Traveller player last night about the recent
orbital facility argument occuring on the TML and he came up with the same
beef.

Can you imagine trying to service a 500,000-ton Tigress-class dreadnaught
at a planetary facility! Talk about a total eclipse of the sun!

Though a half-million-ton ship is an extreme case, the same could be said
for just about every type of ship of 50,000 tons and up. It would be a
serious cause of danger to all other starship, spaceship and air traffic
when just _one_ of these behemoths tried to land or just hover for service
on a planet.

And that\'s just the air-traffic control nightmare!

What about the cost of streamlining all these ships. When you\'re talking
50,000-ton plus, you\'re talking millions, if not billions of credits to
streamline the ship. This would cause a major political stir for a large
interstellar governing body to try to justify the fiscal impact of
constructing of a large fleet of streamlined ships when they could have
saved billions of credits by building an orbital facility.

So, at the very least, orbital naval installations are justified since most
ships beyond 50,000 tons are of military nature.

I think enough arguments have been made for other advantages gleaned from
orbital facilities, so I won\'t rehash old ground.

Either way, you could have Neanderthals as a minor race since they evolved
out of the same archaic Homo sapiens we did.  I would expect Neanderthals,
Homo Erectus, and various other odd genus Homo variants (like the Suerrat)
to be quite common among the minor human races.  Having them all look just
like modern Homo sapiens is the only answer which seems silly to me. 

The fun thing is that almost all of the could probably interbreed, you
could get some pretty strange looking kids on some worlds.  I would
imagine that a few of them would be too different to interbreed
(especially the ones geneered by the Ancients). These variants might well
be considered much more alien by folks in the Imperium, since they are
clearly not human.

There are several reasons why you might want to use shuttles instead of APCs. 
The most important is that a shuttle is probably thicker skinned than most
APCs.

You could use both, however, to create some new landing tactics.  An operation
that this type of ship/unit would be used for would primarily be a quick strike
and leave type mission.  You want to get in close to your target area as soon
as possible.  Use the APCs/ACVs to secure an area, then unload additional men
and equipment from the shuttles.

The second reason is that you might not want to wait until you are in orbit to
start your mission.  You could use the shuttles as soon as you leave jump
space.  Your grav APCs/ACVs would be useless until you were in orbit.  The
mercenary cruiser, generally slower than the cutters, would follow along behind
and provide support when it arrived in orbit.  You could still unload the
APCs/ACVs from the cutters when they arrived in orbit if you wanted to use the
above tactic.

Fighter support would also be a big plus for any type of quick strike mission.

Question: Can someone please provide a reason why fusion drives are not
standard for military ships? =20

Fusion Drives seem to offer greater max g for evasion ("Pilot, give me a
8 second 15 g burn so the beams will miss") and lower power/space
requirements (I think, don=92t have the source materials to check).  Sure=

they are dangerous around planets and population centers, but this is
the military.  They don=92t care about that, or the cost of maintenance,

today -- it is not safe, or cheap, to build nuclear powered ships.  But
for tactical or strategic reasons many were built.   And only one (I
think) nuclear powered merchant ship ever built!

I apologize if this has been rehashed over and over.  But I have an old
race that is being reincarnated and all of their ships are fusion drive=85
do I need to change them, or are the ships just more effective.=20

Also I have always described to my players that one of the reasons Earth
was able to defeat 1I (in addition to research, better jump drives, etc)
was the Imperiums use of thruster Vs fusion. The old comfortable
imperium keep using the "safe" and more "effective" thrusters while the
Terrens went all out. Out maneuvered, out jumped, out gunned, etc.=20

Consonant shift in the next few thousand years will elide the "x" following an initial

PRESS RELEASE FROM MICROSOFT, LIC:

Bill hault-Gates LXVII announced today that Microsoft, LIC, the well-known diversified 
conglomerate, had completed the acquisition of all asteroids in every star system in Sol 
subsector.  "We\'ve been concerned about those asteroids for almost 3,000 years, since 
the company\'s ancient history, when my eponymous great-ancestor was still limiting the 
company to making computers and controlling all computer networks.  Since our 
diversification into all areas of commerce, government, and religion, and our extensive 
development off-world throughout known space, we have been steadily acquiring all 
asteroids that could potentially intersect with Terra -- sometimes at the rate of one 
rock at a time.  We\'re ready to breathe a great sigh of relief that we now have them 
all."

hault-Gates would neither confirm nor deny rumors that Microsoft was negotiating with 
the Imperial government to purchase Luna.

	Well, let me run the FF&S numbers here... P.102 sez:

1) Length of barrel in cm=Muzzle velocity in m/s divided by (100*tech level
modifier).  Here the tech level modifier is 1.

	15=MV/100, therefore 1500=MV unless I\'m gravely mistaken.

	Now that you mention it, it does seem kinda scarily high...

	Why thank you, I think :).

	It occurs to me that we can quickly and easily test the
Lb=V/100*TLm formula using the DH-1:  We know that the projectile weighs
7.06 grams.  All we need to know is the amount of energy required to
accelerate that projectile to those speeds, do the appropriate math, and
then see whether it equals the 7,942 joules FF&S says is required.

	At this point I am kicking myself for packing up all my non-school
books for my impending move.  Can somebody else do this?

And now for my rebuttle :)

But first, let me thank Dr. Clark for his evaluation - all of his points are valid, and I
appreciate his comments. I never mind criticism, as long as it\'s polite and professional.

The main concern he seems to present is cost - and I agree (how can I not) that the
design is rather expensive. It should be obvious that I placed cost at the bottom
of my priorities - I figure there would be some people who could afford such a
ship, and would appreciate its features - just as there are some people who would
want the cheapest design.

An analysis of the cost shows two major cost factors: MFDs and Small Craft. The 
small craft, of course, can be purchased separately. But the fighters are rather
expensive. Replace them with the standard 10-ton light fighter, and you save
a deal of money.

Now for the MFDs...11 of them. (6 for missile batteries, 2 for lasers, 2 for sandcasters, 1 for
nuclear damper). This adds up to almost 300MCr. However, except for the missile batteries,
I feel all of these MFDs are neccessary. 

The missile batteries, of course, take a lot of MFDs...but I wanted a design that could
saturate a LZ with orbital bombardment (thus the high number of missiles), and
what\'s the point of having all those missiles if you can\'t control them all (thus, the
MFDs).

The meson screen and armor were added solely for survivability - both were quite
inexpensive in the grand scheme of things. 

I wanted a ship that could truly deliver a fully equipped troop unit - command staff,
support personnel, troops, vehicles, etc...into a hot LZ and survive. Without reguard
to cost :) I think this design does it.

Once again, Dr. Clark, thanks for your comments. I\'m playing around with a
another design with fewer MFDs (and thus fewer batteries)...it appears the
cost will be around 600MCr without vehicles...still pricey...

WARNING!!WARNING!!WARNING!!WARNING!!WARNING!!WARNING!!WARNING!!WARNING!!
Part or all of the above paragraph is incorrect or faulty

Starship Operators Manual Vol. 1, 
Page 3 Section Titled "Pushing the Drive Limits:"
....."The plates may be overdriven by up to 40% for extended periods of
time(days) with few harmful effects if the overage is done skillfully."
    "On the other hand, overdriving the plates by 400%(as in the case of a
1G ship trying to do a lateral hover at takeoff or landing) takes the
utmost care, and can only be done for brief periods of time(under 5
minutes). While overdriving the plates at such extreme levels, the engineer
must pay very close attention to the drives to make sure no overloads
develop or warning lights appear."

Well 400% does not equal 1000%, 5 minutes does not make for a space combat
turn either.

Micro evading is another crock of underthough feldercarb. 

If has been stated that ship can microevade and that will render the fire
control solution less useful, but the sensors can read the hull numbers of
the same ship(micro evading). It was explained that the sensors software
could perform this feat of magic, well who says that the fire control
computer can not use the same stabilization software. 

Again the unaswered question what is the resolution of sensors or can they
not only read the hull numbers of micro evading ship but scan down to
examine the molecular structure?

I\'ve been casually following the EDU posts semi regularly and this is the
best explanation I\'ve heard yet.

One thought, Marc, is that you have the closeness of EDU to A (or beyond)
work as a modifier for the number of years spent in College (if attended).
ForEx:  John Brainy has just been rolled up with an EDU of 9.  Is it really
going to take him the same 4 years to get a degree as it does for Betsy
Normal who has an EDU 7?  I would think not.  John may spend 2 or 3 years
instead.

Thanks for the kind words. My submission reflects the problems of waiting
until just before the deadline to finish the entry paperwork. (I  usually
work best under pressure!) The power-plant fuel was included in the volume
allocation on my spreadsheet; it was not summed with the jump fuel in the
USP.  I need to redo my design spreadsheet to automatically format the
THUDD entry.

I think I may have blown the weapons entries as well. Late at night, the
design sequence in Starships was a little less than clear on how to
formulate the entries for a laser battery--the terms penetration and damage
seemed to be used interchangeably. If this was covered before, maybe
someone could e-mail me a short description directly. (Too much travel to
keep up with the traveller list!)

I\'ve scanned the other entries and am picking up a lot of good ideas and
different approaches. I\'ll be posting my comments. It would be very
interesting to have a play off between the designs to evaluate the
different design philosophies, maybe at some games con. The battles should
go fairly quickly. A scenario for the merc cruisers might be to have two
mercenary teams attempt to secure a crash site, ancient artifact, or some
other feature on an otherwise empty planet. Each side would know the other
was coming and would roll 1D6 to see what day they arrived. First they
would have to search for the other ship and team to avoid an ambush, then
land their own troops and try to set their own ambush. Play-offs between
the other ship types would also be interesting. Any other ideas?

  This is a very nicely balanced design that comes very close to the CT
Happy Fun Ball.  It carries two mod cutters for troop delivery, as well as
plenty of cargo space for modules and gear.  The weaponry is about right
as well - superior to standard merchant ships, esp. when backed up by
military sensors.  The troop space is also generous - one can carry twice
as many soldiers at a pinch.  The only limitation is the J2 M2
performance, not a big issue in Milue 0.  The price is right, as well.
Very nicely done.

  In light of what other designs have done, you might consider replacing
the missiles with a meson gun and adding some screens - cargo space is
plenty to play around with.

see how this year goes.  Hope you don\'t expect too much.

1074 Attended Flight School at 22

Letter to Parents, 1074-020
Father, Mother:  Flight school!  Never thought I would
voluntarily take even more schooling.  4 years of this and I will
finally be an Ensign in the Navy!  Hope I did not dissappoint you
with my lacklustre performance in the Academy, but my heart was
not in it.  That has all changed.  One day maybe I will be an
Admiral.

Letter to Parents, 1077-300
Father, Mother:  Hope you will come to the ceremonies.  Flight
school was outstanding.  Even picked up a few skills this
time...I will have to take you around in a ship\'s boat one day.

1078 Joined Navy at 26 as Ensign - term 1

Letter to Parents, 1079-015
Father, Mother:  Sorry you did not make it.  I have just been
promoted to Sublieutenant after my first year.  I am more than
glad that I went through the academy after I have seen what the
NCO\'s go through.  Duty is not always easy though.  I have found
a good woman and will be married later this year.

Letter to Parents, 1081-350
Father, Mother:  It has been a few busy years.  I was wounded
this year during a siege and won a purple heart, my first
"decoration".  Gave me a limp that will probably last a lifetime.
I must be doing okay, they are certainly teaching me a lot, even
giving me "special" assignments.  Of course, I cannot talk about
them here.

1082 - 30 - term 2

Letter to Parents, 1084-100
Mother:  My regrets and sympothies.  Relatively quiet shore duty
at last.  Last year was hectic, with my involvement in the Fourth
Frontier War (another purple heart, and an MCUF).  Also won me a
promotion to Lieutenant.  Sending me on training next year.

1086 - 34 - term 3

Journal, 1087-117
During patrol encountered supposedly off course Imperial Navy
Ship.  They are not as cowardly as we are led to believe.
Handled situation well enough to garner promotion to Lt.
Commander and impress superiors.  Will be sent to intelligence
school for a year - Captain thinks I am leader material.

1090 - 38 - term 4

Journal, 1090-280
Successful strike duty, another MCUF, and promotion to Commander.
Will spend next year on patrol.

Journal, 1093-050
On patrol this year.  Spent last year in frozen watch, which
makes me a year younger than I am.

1094 - 42 - term 5

Journal, 1094-250
Unpleasant strike against the Darrian Confederation, although
small enough to only require the Gram fleet; awarded MCUF and
promotion to Captain.  Executing captives is never pleasant.
Captain Zahn seemed to enjoy it too much; questioned my
loyalties.  Next year will be Naval Atache as an Admiral\'s aide.
Hopefully, Admiral Hasselmann whom I admire as best in the
Confederacy.

Journal, 1096-299
Another year as Naval Atache, complete with promotion to
Commodore.  Fleet Admiral Hasselmann was impressive, and has
taken me as understudy.

1098 - 46 - term 6

Journal, 1098-195
Civil war on Joyeuse; we are ordered not to intervene by the
Confederate government.

Journal, 1099-017
Fleet Admiral Hasselmann retired, the Navy will not see a man
like him for generations to come.  Gunther von Strucker has taken
Fleet Admiral\'s post; an unpleasant man.  Clings to outdated
emotions and prejudices.  Hopefully it will not impede my
advances.

Journal, 1099-210
Fleet Admiral von Strucker is pushing to quash the Joyeuse civil
war under the pretext it is gaining system wide support on both
sides.  He claims it will one day threaten peace among the
Confederacy.  He sees it as no more than an opportunity to
further his career and attempt to build a Confederate fleet under
his control.

Journal, 1100-050
von Strucker is leaving service to go into politics.  The
position will be open next year and it will be between me and his
puppet Zahn.  At least Hasselmann still has influcence with the
Admiralty.

Journal, 1100-217
Heidi ran off with that imbecile Zahn.  He can have her;
ungrateful woman.

Incident Report, 1100-271
I regret that while on duty and in view of men serving under
myself and another officer (Commodore Zahn), I did in fact strike
that officer.  I would claim personal greivances, political
differences, and officer competitiveness as reasons, not excuses.
There is no excuse for such a loss of control, especially in
front of subordinates.

Navy Martial Review Board, 1100-303
Commodore Nj=94rdinskiold:  All charges in relation to Incident
Report 1100271-5 have been summarily dropped.  The Report will be
filed with your record, and note that suspension may follow a
further Incident of this nature.


Journal, 1101-300
After 4 years of endless, grueling, mostly boring patrol,
promoted to Fleet Admiral.  Admiralty really could not pass me
over because of a highly publicized and quickly defused meeting
with a small Imperical fleet.  Zahn, doing routine shore duty, is
furious.  Heidi is apologetic and simpering now that I am
Admiral; they are made for each other. von Strucker is trying to
mark me as an Imperial sympathizer.

1102 - 50 - term 7

Journal, 1102-010
Finally, the fleet is mine.  Only four years until mandatory
retirement, I must start grooming a successor. Hasselmann taught
me well and is now a good friend.

Captain\'s Log, 1103-099
Wounded during patrol; encountered rogue Imperial cruiser
harassing a local merchant vessel.  Impounded ship and delivered
crew to nearest Imperial Navy base.

Journal, 1103-099
Returned Imperial crew under heavy suspicion.  Many are furious I
did not deal with them myself, but I believed they were not my
jurisdiction.  I would expect same treatment from Imperial
commanders (would they reciprocate?).

Classified Letter from Gram Department of Foreign Relations, 1103-
231
It is the expresed concern of this government that the Imperial
Cruiser (Log date 1103-099) should have been destroyed with the
full crew complement aboard.  We regret that unofficially the
Empire is accusing the SW fleet of piracy and trickery by
returning their crew but not their vessel.

Journal, 1104-020
Hmph.  52 and they think they can train me something.

Letter to Confederate Admiralty, 1105-300
Gentlemen:  Attached is my recommendation for my replacement.  I
have trained Bjorn Eriksson following the respected teachings of
Fleet Admiral Hasselmann and believe he will be an effective,
loyal, and commanding leader of our Confederate Fleet.  I regret
retirement, but it is time to pass leadership on to younger, more
energetic men.

Letter from Confederate Admiralty, 1105-330
Yuri:  It is with our most expressed regret that you must retire
after 28 years of loyal service to the Fleet.  Thank you for your
recommendation for your successor, but, unfortunately we have
already decided upon Commodore Wolfgang Zahn with his unswerving
fealty to our glorious Confederacy.  Our best wishes for your
future.

1106 - 54 retired

Letter to Retired Fleet Admiral Karl Hasselmann, 1106-10
Karl, my friend:  I regret I am tired of endless political
yabbering.  Zahn is a bumbling fool, and I do not know how he
made it to Admiral (other than under von Strucker\'s
manipulating); I hear he had Bjorn transferred to Narsil out of
fear for him.  I hope our Navy does not suffer too much of a
setback.  I fear I have made too many enemies in the government
with my position on Empire/Sword relations.  I think there is
much potential with Empire, but nobody listens.  So I now go to
see what it is really like.  Perhaps I will return one year and
make my waves in the government.

	Fusion drive ships cannot carry many g-turns of fuel.  The 
numbers listed in FF&S are actually too generous by a decimal point. This 
makes fusion significantly worse than heplar.
	Heplar is significantly worse than t-plates because it requires 
fuel and is actually more expensive when all is considered.
	As far as reaction drives offering greater evasion possibilities, 
the max g\'s that a ship can handle is more determined by its structural

	If we start citing the literature, we are all going to come up
with different dates.  There are a bunch of sites and materials with dates
that are contenious, at *best*.  Late Pleistocene hominid evolution is in
flux, and neanderthal development and classification is a *nightmare* in
particular.  Just go to an AAPA (or ECAE) meeting and watch the fights...
<g>.  The dates of 140,000 - 40,000 years ago are safe but old.  There are
several sites that may push this back, but researchers are still arguing
morphology and dating techniques.


	Laterish!

I believe what he is saying is that since we can\'t test it we won\'t know
for sure.

However the question of temporal speciesation can be problematic.  For
example it would be fair to say that you are the same species as your
mother was (No Mr Spock remarks please), and that your mother is the
same species as _her_ mother (your grandmother) and that your
grandmother was the same species as her mother (your great-grandmother)
but if we continue this sort of logic long enough (ten  or twenty
million years for instance) you will find a lemur like monkey as your
direct ancestor.  Now every generation in this link to your lemur
ancestor has involved two individuals of the same species but trying to
suggest that you and the lemur are the same species is a reductio ab
absurdo. Paleontologists use this sort of reasoning to point out that we
cannot _know_ when two populations become two different species.  

If we take the definition of species literally two groups that cannot
interbreed are not the same species.  Unless someone on the list has
invented a time machine & is not sharing with me nobody on the list is
going to be able to breed with any Imperial Romans but they are
obviously of the same species (Homo sapiens) as most of the readers of
this list.

Well either of these interpretations could be correct or it is

How are we going to know this one unless someone clones an

Has it ever been _established_ that human beings and chimpanzees cannot
interbreed ?  Just because we have not seen it happen does not mean that
it _cannot_ happen.  Until the recent development of artificial
fertilization techniques any such experimentation would have to have
been done the old fashioned way.  I do not think that sexually molesting
a chimpanzee would be a very good idea given their strength & I don\'t
know enough about chimpanzee behavior to know if they would consent to
sex.  I think that the results of such an experiment would be
interesting to know but any such experimentation would be _very_
controversial and arguably unethical.  I guess this is just more proof
that those darn Solomani are too hasty & rash :)

The table in the Gauss desing is wrong. If you use the battery design (as
you would do for lasers or even Mass drivers) you would have 0.046 kg for
the battery weight.

I\'ve checked the receiver weight, comparing to the HPG table at chapter 8
of FFS. It\'s exactly the same value. That is to say that the receiver is
TOTALY a HPG of 15885J.

I\'ve changed my mind about the battery weight when I talked to Antti
Lahtinen about the weapons on his web site. As Gauss weapons are the next
generation of slug weapons, it has to be more efficient and usable than ETC
weapons. But the batteries are too heavy to be used esaily. 

IMHO, If you can build an ETC rifle which has the same size, same weight,
I\'m sure you could do more damage. So Gauss weapons are not an improovement.


And about the remarks on the barrel length. I think it\'s not broken since
Gauss weapon are a positive evolution of ETC weapons. 
Gauss weapon are lighter, more silencious, more efficient (shorter) than
their damage equivalent in ETC technology. That\'s the point.

    'body' => 'Several TNE rules questions than severly bothered me... :-(

1- Can anybody explain me why the Concussion/Burst is so efficient! 

Example : My character STR 10 and CON 7 (Head 14, Chest 51, others 38). Now
a regular HE grenade C3 B15 explodes at 1m from him (he wears a body sleeves).

Assuming aromour doesn\'t protect from concussion. Taking average values he
would suffer 3D6 = 11 damage point spread over the body (2 in the head, 2
in chest 1 in arms and legs, 2 in abdomen and 1 where you want). Concussion
does litle scratch!

Now the burst! In the primary burst area, the average number of hits he\'ll
get is (3*3.5+3*1+4*0)=1.35, let\'s use 2 hits. The damge value for each is
DV2. Assuming th AV is 1, each hits does 1D6+1 damage point. So let\'s say
1hit un the  leg and 1 in the abdomen. Average damage points in 4 and 5

So The result is somthing like that
AV1 - average        /    AV0 - average 
head  : 2            /    2
chest : 2            /    2
arms  : 1 each       /    1
legs  : 1 and 5      /    8
abdo. : 5            /    8

At 1 meter , a grenade only scratch you. 

Now a small gauss pistol does 3D6 damage with 2-2-2. So a round of fire
would do 5*1D6+2 damage. Somthing like
AV1 - average  /  AV0 - average 
chest : 5      /     11  
legs  : 6      /     10
abdo. : 6      /     11

Seems gauss pistol is more efficient than a grenade exploding at 1meter
from you!!!

Now if you use a DV5 semi auto rifle, grenades looks like fireworks!!!

Related point : Solid armour such battldress should protect from concussion...
why not using the vehicle pentration (PV+2D6, compared to AV)?

Does anyone have an alternate rule?
What is T4 system?


2- Passenger inside vehicle damage. 

TNE rules stated that for a hit on vehicle in a location of a passenger,
this passenger would suffer of 1D6 hits doing 1D6 damage (DV1!!) even with
a PAW attack!!!. How the passenger personnal armour affect this value which
is ridiculously small. The passenger would never get killed from the blast,
which is totaly unrealistic. 

For space ship combat, it\'s the opposit. If crew member is hit, he\'s
dead!!!. But the spaceship combat uses the same rating as vehicle combat.
Lasers and PAWs works exactly the same in both systems...

Does anyone have an arternate rule?
What is T4 system?

    I suspect what the original poster was refering to was an update of some
type of the tables that originally appeared in the original Journal\'s for
Classic Traveller.  I\'ve been thinking of doing the same thing myself, I\'m just
not intimately acquainted enough with the T4 combat rules to do it right...

    I\'m not surprised by this at all, any serious study of the Martial Arts
requires a year or two to master the basic techniques before you\'re really
ready to learn how to use them in combat.  In most of the Arts I\'ve studied the
actual fighting part is something they start teaching you after you\'ve gotten
your Black Belt, allowing you to master the basics before moving on to the
advanced techniques.  In the three Martial Arts I\'ve studied each time I\'ve
reached Black Belt my teachers make it very clear that this is not an end, but
rather a new begining.  One of them even compared getting your Black Belt to
getting your Driver\'s License.  You\'ve met the minimum qualifications to drive
on city streets, you are not ready for the Indy 500. ;)

    That\'s one way, but there are two major reasons.  One OC is color and flare
it can put into a game, the other is that a trained and experienced Martial
Artist can wipe the floor up with a Brawler and not break a sweat.  There
should be rules to reflect this.  BTW by "trained" I mean a Martial Artist with
at least five years of continuous study, ten or more would be more usual.

> BTW, the deadliest form of hand to hand would most likely be commando
> training (various countries)
    Depends on WHO is using the training.  A soldier with a couple of years of
service and combat under his belt...  or a fresh youngster just out of
training?  BTW Commando Training evolved out of encounters the British had with
Asian Martial Artists durring the Colonial Period.  All of the moves can pretty
much be traced back to this or that Martial Art from which they were swiped.
The advantage of this is that Commando Trainin in HtH is very good at it\'s
focus of killing quickly.  The downside is that the Commando doesn\'t have the
broad range of techniques and skills an experienced Martial Artist has.

    Just out of curiousity, have you ever sparred with a Senior Black Belt?
Third Dan or above?

	often that I would like to make an official Traveller question.

	So, once again: When we are designing starships and vehicles,
	should we use Contragravity [CG] lifters or Antigravity [AG]
	thrusters ?

 Why I want to make this question?

	T4 was supposed to use "grav thrusters that can provide both
	lift and thrust". Since contragravity lifters can\'t provide
	thrust, I assumed that T4 used antigravity thrusters.

	Presently it seems that some designers use CG while other use
	AG. However, because of their basic principles these systems are
	mutually exclusive and do not easily fit into the same universe.

 What are the differences between CG and AG?

	Contragravity generates a spherical field where gravitional
	attraction is nullified. CG vehicles can be used as lighter-than-
	air (or lighter-than-anything) vehicles, and require separate
	thruster engine to move around.

	Antigravity thruster is direct thrust engine that pushes against
	local gravity field. AG vehicles may use part of their thrust
	for hovering (like a helicopter), and use remaining thrust for
	acceleration.

 What is the final effect on vehicle design?

 Using Contra Gravity:

	Large vehicles may float with the same power usage in 1G and
	100G gravity fields.

	CG gravity nullifier makes perpetual motion power plants
	possible.

	Grav vehicles require separate thrusters to move around. (For
	example, a grav belt needs propellers in atmosphere and rockets
	in vacuum.)

	Grav belts cause very interesting secondary effects. (Everything
	within CG field is effectively weightless. If a character is
	using a grav belt to hover above a lake and the CG field
	touches the surface of water, the pressure of surrounding water
	pushes the weightless water upwards and the whole CG field will
	soon be filled with water.)

 Using Antigravity:

	Most existing starships have only 1G antigravity thruster, and
	will not be able to hover on 100G gravity field.

	Airframed atmospheric grav vehicles (Speeders) may take off and
	land vertically using AG thrust, and fly on very high speed using
	wings for lift and AG for thrust.

	Grav vehicles can operate in water, atmosphere, and vacuum
	without any problems.

 End of question. Waiting for answers.

It\'s called _FF&S_.  The small arms design sequences in FF&S become
increasingly broken the farther away from center you get.  "Center" seems to
be approximately an M-16 rifle.

FF&S is NOT the official weapon design system for T4; Greg Porter\'s 3G3 is;
and if you\'re at all interested in such stuff, I can\'t recommend 3G3 highly
enough.

> Put me down in the "space stations aren\'t much use" category.

In my own campaigns, all Class A and Class B starports have space station
components; most other worlds do not have space stations unless there is
a separate reason.  The initial reason for having a station at Class A and
Class B ports is so that these starports can construct and repair
unstreamlined ships (required by definition for Class A and B ports).

If some kind of station already exists (and is crewed, and has regular
shuttle runs to the ground), then it begins to make sense to use the station
for other things.  Since it\'s there, it becomes a convenient place to stash
cargo and freight, and an easy way for passengers to transfer from ship to
shuttle.

> For cargo transhipment, there\'s no particular need for a space station, even

> a long time for a shuttle

True, BUT a large bulk hauler may well have 5,000 tons of inbound cargo,
destined for a half-dozen or more different points on the planet; add to
that 5,000 tons of outgoing cargo, all coming from a half-dozen or more
other points on the planet.

Now you have about a dozen shuttles swarming around the bulk hauler, which
has to unload in a carefully orchestrated sequence (you can\'t just park
cargo containers in the vacuum, it\'ll damage many kinds of cargo), depending
on the order in which things were loaded.  If one shuttle is late, then
everyone else\'s schedule is thrown off.  Then you have to load cargoes
(again in sequence).  Oh yes - while all of that is going on, you have to get
fuel; either by hiring someone with a shuttle to bring it to you, or by
using your own shuttles to go get it.

Compare to the convenience, and more importantly speed (time is money - save
twelve hours at every stop, and you can make an extra roundtrip a year) of
docking to a station, opening the cargo hatches to a (pressurized,
automated) cargo handling system, and offloading everything to the station,
where your freight agent, the customs people, and the consignees can sort it
out later.  While this is going on, the station is pumping fuel into your
tanks, and your purifier can get to work on it while cargo is being loaded. 
Then you load your outbound cargo (already collected, grouped
for your destinations, and with all the paperwork done by the freight agent)
and get the heck out of there.

A space station doesn\'t help the small ships (and anything under 1000 tons
is definitely small), but for the big haulers, having a station in orbit
helps you make good use of that expensive starship.  In my campaigns, PCs
usually ignore the orbital port, unless they have to go there for some
reason.

But even with Traveller technology, it\'s more expensive to produce Zero-G
and Vacuum on the ground than it is to use the naturally-occurring Zero-G
and vacuum in space.  It\'s quite likely that many Far Future industrial
processes will require one or both.

Huh?  Who said?  This _doesn\'t_ make any sense, and is certainly not
required (though it\'s the most common use of the system).

I\'ve played several campaigns where we decided that the players would be
active-duty military.  The character generation system was then used to
create the character\'s prior history.  For example, one player would be the
First Officer, so he and the referee would decide what the appropriate navy
rank should be, and the player would enlist in the Navy and run the
character generation system until he achieved the appropriate rank.

The referee may ocassional alter a die roll, or may require the players to
choose certain options (it\'s a little un-believable when the entire crew of
a scoutship are pilots, and no engineers).

Huh?  Again, what do you mean?  What sort of support are you looking for? 
The entire current game universe was created using just the tools available
in the game.  One of the first things I did with Traveller was create my
own subector, and finally an entire sector, for my own game universe.

As I recall from the maps included with the various alien supplements (both
GDW and DGP), the rifts widen slightly, and extend for as far as anyone has
explored.

If I remember correctly, yes.

I believe the rifts are supposed to be a gap between spiral arms of the
galaxy, and probably extend for farther than you\'d want to travel.
Corridor is suppoed to be the only easy crossing of the rifts in
explored space, which puts the Imperium in a strategically-important spot.

> Does the Atlas of the Imperium offer a definitive answer?

No.  It covers approximately the same area as the map in Supplement 11.

At one point (a LONG time ago), I\'d photocopied all of the pages to the
Atlas, colored all of the star hexes to match their allegiance, and taped
them all together into a BIG map and hung it on the wall.  Very
interesting!

=B7 In my view of the world, one of the primary advantages of a meson gun

=B7 that it *is* an indirect-fire (non-LOS) weapon.  The same trick that

=B7 Additionally and uniquely, meson guns are non-LOS and can fire throug=
h
=B7 solid materials to hit their target.  That\'s why deep meson sites are
the
=B7 ideal planetary defense, and ship-born meson guns the ideal planetary
=B7 attack weapon.


While I like the Meson gun concept for its abilities (fire "through"
stuff) I have to ask about the Rate of Fire.  How often can a Meson gun
fire? As an old arty guy there is often a need for more than "one" tube.
Multiple targets, suppression fire, heck, sometimes you just need to
boost morale with a show of force. Unless you have a dozen meson gun
tubes up in space, I would not count on much fire support. My
understanding is that they have a slow (every twenty minutes?) ROF.

Missiles are not as capable, but do offer the multiple strike and area
effect that I would be looking for. But they are expensive and take up
too much space.

So what is the ideal weapon for supporting troops on the ground? Lets
look at the ships today to see what type of support they offer ground
troops.  Very little. Most have one or two small cannons. That is why
the old BB=92s came out of retirement in the 80=92s.  Fire support from m=
any
(big, medium and small) tubes. Today much of the support comes from the
air.  Helos, close support aircraft, etc=85 But they take a lot of suppor=
t
and cost too much. What are they dropping? Big dumb bombs (contrary to
popular belief, most weapons dropped are not "smart").=20

In Traveller I would design some type of guided dead fall ordnance and
let gravity do the work for me. Take a 1000 lb bomb, put some fins on
it, and a little seeker on the nose and push a thousand out the hanger.

I know that if I was a grunt on the ground I would care less if the
weapon can fire through walls, or can evade detection. What I want is
for the dug in troops in front of me to go away. Now.  One shot is not
going to do it.=20

I agree whole heartedly.

I=92m currently working on my PhD.  While this may give
me a "Book" learning level (EDU) of  14 (not counting
any Grammar School) I may not be able to work Physics,
Computer Programming, or even pick my nose.

I have met several PhD=92s that claim they can do anything
now that they have their PhD, but have gotten the biggest
shock, literally, when they tried to work on an electrical
system in a house.

Let=92s settle this once and for all.  EDU level like, SOC
level means little in the accomplishment of a skill.  They
are just records of how long an individual has been
associated with a particular social organization.

EDU =96 the learning system

SOC =96 the nobility system

I think your reply illustrates the original point: what about
*non*-military characters?  These have typically been given the short end
of the stick.  Traders and Scouts are very cool (Scouts still my favorite),
but there should be more: scientist, spy, maybe priest or even dilettante.
And as much as possible, these should be able to create varied characters
that are just as playable as the military ones.  As it is now, sometimes it
feels like we have an old D&D game filled with fighters.  Where are our mages?

Another question for the list :


Roderick Darroch Elliott let me thinking about the difference between
Gyroscopic compensator and Inertial compensator.

The FFS book stated that Inertial compensator is a flexible arm connected
to a backpack which is able to absorb recoil.

What about the Gyroscopic compensator?
How it looks like?

Thanks in advance

I saw a lot of the Colonies being set up during the Nth Interstellar War 
between the First Imperium and the Terran Confederation. They were 
insurance policies against the Terran losing. I made one up for TNE that 
was colonized by Ramship. They went about 300 parsecs rimward from Terra 
- - just to be sure the Imperium couldn\'t reach them. Unfortunately religious 
fanatics took over the ship when they were awoken out of cold sleep for their 
5 year stint at crew duty. Most of the colonists were marooned on a harsh but 
habitable planet. The Fanatics went on to the destination, a Earthlike world, 
and in a few generation blew themselves back to the stone age. 

The one thing I really liked about my setting was the first words of \'The 
Prayer of the Founders\' - \'They fled from Villainy\' (Villani gettit?)

I remember reading somewhere that Grandfather deliberately left the 
psionic map where the Zhodani would get it, to get them to waste 
their resources. Grandfather an Impie dog? Looks like it.

	That\'s one of the things I like best about TNE...at last you
didn\'t have a bunch of PC\'s who were ALL
ex-squids/grunts/gyrenes/scoutscum. Various CT supplements did have varied
career paths (Citizens of the Imperium, IIRC), but TNE had a huge list,
pages of them all with generation sequence...hell you could be a
bricklayer if you really wanted to (well, they called it construction
worker ;-) 

	One of the better TNE ideas that didn\'t make it into T4.

On my pistol page you\'ll find the stats for the beast, a pistol designed to
fire 12.7mm Browning MG ammo.  The muzzle blast can blow things off the
firing table, and it requires a massive wrist brace to prevent crippling
injury, but one of these monstors was actually built.. Check it out at:

Where does it say you can\'t play active duty military?  I\'m currently
setting up a campaign with the characters being the officers and crew of the
INV Coronation (BB-216), a Regal class 90,000 ton battleship.  We\'re doing
Ars Magica style troupe playing; everyone will have several PCs, from the
bridge cre down to a squad of Marines.

Well, you do have the world generation system.  What else do you need?
Traveller has its offcial backround (the Third Imperium); if you want to do
something different, go for it.

Dig up the Traveller alien module (7?) about them, the DGP module solomani
and Aslan (aka Rats and Cats), The issue of The Traveller Digest that
featured Earth (16?), and you have quite a bit of source material.

>1- Can anybody explain me why the Concussion/Burst is so efficient! 

<Demostration of damage by grenade and gauss pistol snipped>

Most people\'s experience with hand grenades is limited to the obscenities
used in film and TV.  These pocket nukes explode in a giant ball of flame
and throw full grown men 5 or 6 meters.  Right. 

In truth, grenades aren\'t that effective.. their main advantage is that they
are silent, area-effect weapons.  Most grenades contain about 500g of high
explosive, wrapped in a segmented copper or steel wire sheath.  When a
grenade explodes, this sheath becomes shrapnel.  Unfortuantly, these bits of
metal are ballistic jokes, and shed much of their velocity in a meter or
two.  The concussive force from the explosion really won\'t do more than stun
you and make your ears ring unless you are within about a meter of the
device when it detonates, and then you\'ll also be facing the shrapnel at its
most potent.

A gauss pistol, or any other slug thrower, is projecting an aerodynamic,
heavy bullet at high velocity into your body.  Once there, the bullet
tumbles, causing a wound cavity to form as tissue is pushed aside or torn by
the round\'s passage.  If a bone is hit by a round with some energy
remaining, odds are that the bone will shatter.

So why use grenades?  They make great party gifts for the guys you want to
overrun.  Toss a few frags in their general direction, along with a smoke
grenade, and the bad guys will be forced to take cover while your assult
team starts to move.  Grenades are great at clearing rooms and bunkers also.

Just out of curiosity, but why were they travelling by ramjet?  Granted,
300 parsecs without stopping for maintenance would be pretty hard on a
ship\'s jump drive, but at 2/parsecs per week (a reasonable average,
assuming the colony ships were capable of 3 parsec jumps, but sometimes
had to take detours, breaks for repairs, and so forth), it would only be a
3-year mission, instead of a 300-year one.  With three jump drives aboard,
you wouldn\'t have to use any one of them for more than a year.  Colony
ships with lots of redundant systems would have no trouble making this
journey (of course, a while ago, I tried to argue for a jump-capable,
ramscoop-refuelled colony ship intended to go to the *Large Magellanic
Cloud*, a mere *50 kiloparsecs* away, so I may put a little too much faith
in robust engineering, redundancy, and on-board maintenance...just a quick
disclaimer).

Ah,.. that explains it!

Nice precognitive work there, Glenn.

As a technical writer, I\'m paid to ferret out grammatical and spelling
errors in printed work much to the irritation of Cisco\'s engineering staff!
So you\'ll have to forgive my editor\'s eye.

So, in the far future, will certain characteristics of gangsta rap and
ebonics also make it into Galanglic? Such as "ask" = "ax"?

As in: "Ax me if I care?" <g>

Best,

A gyrocompensator is a set of six small gyroscopes inside the weapon.  When
powered up the tend to keep the weapon pointed in the same direction. this
helps keep you on target despite recoil.  The problem is when you have to
suddenly change targets.. the gyros will fight that move too..

Well, T4 has three direct military careers (Army, Navy, Marines)and the
following other options:  Merchant, Scout, Entertainer, Noble, Rogue,
Scholar, and Agent.  Agent can be defined as anything from reporter to
bounty-hunter, depended on how you direct your skills.

Let\'s take one of your requests, the priest.  Scholar immediately comes to
mind, with Science cluster skills spent on History, Philosophy, and
Psychology.  Some level of Instruction would be appropriate, as would
Diplomacy and maybe Bureaucracy, to deal with the upper levels of the church.

Now let\'s take another look.. maybe you want a more flamboyant, evangelical
type.. perhaps Entertainer would fit.  A few levels of Performance and
Fast-talk, combined with a little Acting, and you\'ve got a roof-raising
preacher-man, on his way to the next pressure-tent revival, can I get an AMEN!?

	My take on gyroscopic compensators is that they do not actually
reduce recoil, they just keep the barrel from kicking upwards...  From what
I understand, on firearms the axis of thrust from the recoil is not
perfectly in line with the axis of resistance holding the gun in place
(i.e. the shooter\'s arm):


Recoil	---->[(((((((((((]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]
				    [[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[]_
                                        |   (__)   (__\\
                                         \\----(__)  \\  \\______________
                                               (___) \\-
<----Resistance from shooter\'s arm (__)  \\_____________
                                                 \\_____\\

	From what I understand, the lever effect this has is why a gun
kicks upward when fired.

	My take on gyroscopic compensators is that they\'re housed under the
barrel on a gun, and when firing, briefly engage a gyroscope, so that
motion at an angle to the axis of recoil will be dampened by the
compensator.  Thus, the gun stays much more level when being fired; the
shooter still has to brace against backward recoil, but doesn\'t have to
worry about keeping the gun pointed, and a small amount of the recoil, the
amount that would go towards kicking the barrel up out of line, is absorbed
by the gyroscope.

	Then again I could be totally out to lunch.

(pay no attention to the man behind the curtain!)

I have seen the thread on orbital space stations and am quite impressed with 
the ideas/flames/etc... regarfing these obriting centres of comerce.

But I submit to you another type of station,

The Deep Space Station.

Most of you on the TML, almost all ISBA, and I think every regualr I talk to 
on IRC knows the story behind "Planet X".  That being that is not even a 
planet at all (thus the "X")  Its a station that exists in deep space one Pc 
coreward of Sylea.

Why do such a thing?  many reasons.

1.  It can link 2 or more \'mains\' meaning more Free Traders(or any J-1 
ships) can make more trade and profit in more areas of the sector.

2. They act as a refuling and repair stop between those mains for the J-1 
ships

3. Because of 1. and 2. they can be very lucrative to the owner, especialy 
when it comes to repairs and refuling.

4. Strategic Importance.  The Station could be a garison base for patroling 
the main(s) from pirates and such.

Those are the pros, but deep space stations do have cons.

1. Being in deep space, everything has to be imported from the outside. 
 This is usualy handled by trade and cargo carriers.

2. To run a station, you need to make a LOT of money.  Stations are not 
usualy self sufficent (see point 1). The station needs to sell something and 
turn a profit to  take some of that profit to pay for upkeep and keep the 
populace/workers happy.

3. You better damn well have it well defended, because in deep space its 
just you and your station against the raiders.  You cant call back to the 
planet below  or in orbit #2 for help.

4. If you build it, they may or may not come.  If you advertise, its a 
better chance, if its a link between mains, even better, if you offer lots 
of goods and services, increase your chances more still.  This is a mechant 
prince game, you got to wheel and deal to keep your station floating.

Well, just some thunks on why to build deep space stations...oh I almost 
forgot the prime reason why to buid one:

If the maps change, it  don\'t matter,  you were never a charted planet 
anyhoo, just put it in a location where it\'s a blank hex! :)

Enjoy!

I agree with the color aspect, but not with the comparison of brawling and
martial arts.  In theory, the two individuals with these skills have spent
the same number of hours training and practicing, as well as actually
*doing* their various moves and countermoves.  They should be equal, in
balance, in terms of their skills and therefore their ability to hit and
do damage.

Brawling is simply a different means of combat.

Now, I do not object to making the two different, but still balanced.
Perhaps the brawler has an easier "to hit" task than an equivalent martial
artist, but the MA can do more damage.

Perhaps one aspect of your picture is that a martial artist with less
than, say, a level 5 skill cannot really use that skill effectively.

In fact I can see one possibility; Brawling is a skill which is
proportional in its effectiveness to the skill level; an increase of one
in the skill level translates directly into an increase in damage and
likelyhood of hitting.  Martial arts, on the other hand, starts out with a
severe handicap; level 1 MA does very little damage and has an extreme to
hit task, but as the level increases, the incremental increase in skill
translates to a jump in effectiveness such that at (for example) level 5
the brawler and the M. artist are on equal terms, but at level 10 the MA
is superior, and at level 1 the brawler is superior.  This would relfect
the need for a much bigger time investment for martial artists.   

In general though, equal skill levels should represent equal time and
skill in the different skills represented.

Yeah, I went back and looked over these after I posted (I know, shoulda
been before :) ).  I like your characterisation of the priest -- I\'ll have
to give that a try.  Even with the additional careers in T4 though,
Traveller still feels awfully militaristically-focused.  That may be my CT
days showing through, or it may just be in the nature of the game-universe,
but it seems to me there\'s some additional dimensionality given to the
military-relevant skills and the situations for which these skills are
useful.  

Maybe we just need to expand our repetiore of adventure ideas to include
those that _need_ a scholar, noble, or priest.  Could be interesting.

  By expensive I meant expensive for the mission it was designed for.
Your design is nice, and would work well as a ship in combat with other
front-line craft.  However, one could buy two of the other designs for the
price of yours, and have much more flexibility.  I think the rational that
a mercenary cruiser would not _routinely_ engage in combat, and so needs
only defend itself against minor threats, is reasonable.

  Again, I like the design as a combat ship - I\'m sure it would kick ass
vs. the other contestants.

  Probably a good idea - I don\'t think the difference in capability would
make much difference in the sort of mission these ships are designed for.

  Good point - I had forgotten MFDs were so expensive.  That\'s part of the
reason I like the meson gun option - lots of firepower, instant time on
target, no ammunition worries.

  Good idea - I\'d be interested to hear from some folks who run space

  You are very welcome - one of the things I like about THUDDD is the
chance to compare my ideas with that of others - my own designs are
improving as a result.

  As for this contest, my ideal ship (a combination of the entries) would
have a meson gun, some lasers and sandcasters, some screening, two 50T mod
cutters, some fighters (2 to 4), small staterooms for the troops, and a
fair amount of cargo space - at least 60 tons.  To get that within the
1000T hull range you\'d need to go J2 M2, I think - J3 just takes up too
much space.

  One thing i am going to do is to design a 400T TL10 SDB as an opponent -
that should give some idea of what a mercenary cruiser should be able to
fight against.

I know about the Schalli living on Vras.

I always figured the reason lay in the apportionment of space to the
bureaux, and the conduct of the Consolidation Wars.

One portion of the Vilani tripartite government stayed close to home, and
either didn\'t meet any minor races or didn\'t have to extend to absorb them
- -- so the space around Vland was heavily developed as per your model. 
Another met several alien species and extended into new markets, taking
them up into what is "now" the Vargr Extents and as far as Antares.  The
last bureau, in my mind, met the bulk of the human minor races (Suerrat,
Geonee, Syleans, whoever else) and thus was forced to extend further and
faster in order to incorporate all of them into the Ziru Sirka.

Had cultural rigidity not set in to prevent even further expansion,
development, and conquest, Terra might have suffered the same.  As it was,
the "thinness" of the Vilani expansion rimward assisted in the Terran
victory and occupation.  I view those territories as sparsely occupied,
basically long trade routes connecting pleasant colonized worlds and
homeworlds of subject races, but with little development in-between:
again, the primary reason for the rapid and extensive advance was to bring
outliers into the fold, not mainly for reasons of commercial development.

"Ax me sup" was a typical commo squawck in Terran Confederation days.  It meant, "I\'m 
ready to give you electronic information if you\'re ready to receive."  "Hella rad" is 
often seen next to the old Terran radiation danger symbol at Solomani installations,

legend in Vilani and Galanglic that says, "Danger--radiation".

It\'s nice to find someone else who likes LeGuin.  She\'s really thought the process 
through.  Traveller fans should follow the changes to interstellar society after the 
development of instantaneous communication (the ansible).  Before the ansible, 
information travelled like in traveller -- at the speed of ships.  There was a period of 
dislocation and turmoil as ansibles were shipped around the galaxy on ships.

So all those Marines and soldiers who snuffed grenades with their bodies on the beaches

    'body' => 'Every Adventure Begins and Ends at a Starport
	Every adventure begins and ends at a starport. Starports are the means by
which the citizens of every modern society begin their individual journeys to
the stars. These complex constructions provide all of the facilities and
services necessary to support, repair, maintain, and service the starships
that carry interstellar passengers and freight. They are the central
crossroads that all interstellar traffic must pass through. It stands to
reason, then, that interstellar travellers naturally gravitate to
starports... to meet starships and crew, to buy and sell cargoes, and to
begin and end their adventures.
	Starports offer two opportunities for adventure. Travellers can board a ship
and travel to the next world, or they can follow the concourse to the main
gate and move out to explore the world they are on. In both cases, there is
an infinity of opportunities for adventure.
	Beginning Adventures. An adventure can start anywhere, but for convenience
and for continuity, a starting point must be assigned. That assignment says
that an adventure begins at a starport. When characters enter a starport,
their intent is to find adventure. The details of that adventure may not
become clear until later, but the adventure clearly begins at the starport.
	Ending Adventures. Likewise, the details, the climax and even the payoff for
adventures may take place anywhere, but every adventurer knows in his or her
heart that its not over until they reach the starport.
	The Endless Cycle. So, at the very moment that an adventure ends, a new one
begins. The endless cycle in Traveller is the end of an old adventure and the
beginning of a new one; each builds on the previous, and the cycle never ends
until the characters stop going to the starport.

 THE SITUATION INSYSTEM
	A star system is composed of a primary star and one or more stellar
companions. Orbiting these stars are a variety of planets, planetoid belts,
and gas giants. Orbiting planets and gas giants are a variety of satellites.
But the focus is one world... the mainworld... which is the overall best
planet or satellite in the system.
	The mainworld has a starport which, for all practical purposes, is the
destination of interstellar traffic entering the system. Starports vary in
their capabilities and facilities, depending on the details of the world
itself.

CLASSIFICATION OF STARPORTS
	Starports are classified by their location and by their capabilities.

Location
	A starport may be located on a world surface, or it may be in orbit above
the world.
	Down. A starport may be located on a world surface. If so, the starport is
most frequently referred to by the world name followed by the word Down.
Thus, Sylea Down is the main world surface starport for the world of Sylea.
	Why a surface port? Landing close to the market is convenient for all
concerned. If the environment is at all tolerable, then life support and
labor costs are minimized.
	Highport. A starport may be located in orbit above a world. If so, it is
most frequently referred to by the world name followed by Highport. Thus,
Sylea Highport is the main orbital starport for Sylea. A highport maintains
scheduled links by shuttle with the world surface (if there is no surface
starport, then with an air transport hub).
	Why a highport? Many very large ships never land on a world surface; the
cargo they carry is off-loaded in orbit and shuttled down. Some worlds are
naturally inhospitable (bad surface weather, a water world, fluid oceans, or
perhaps government type D or E) and ship owners prefer not to risk their
equipment venturing down to the surface.
	Spaceports. There is typically one major starport in a star system. Other
facilities, especially those on smaller, less important worlds in a system,
are called spaceports. They are established primarily to foster in-system
travel.
	Good spaceports are often established in support of farming projects, mining
projects, or small colonies.

Starport Type
	Starport type is based on a simple letter classification system (ranging
from A to E) which details their basic facilities.
	A. Excellent quality facility with refined and unrefined fuel available on
site. Facilities include capability to perform annual overhaul and new ship
construction (QSDS certified designs). A naval base may be present. A scout
base is usually not present. A surface installation is present. A highport
may be present (generally if the world atmosphere is 2+).
	B. Good quality starport with refined and unrefined fuel available on site.
Facilities include capability to perform annual overhaul and new spacecraft
construction (QSDS certified designs). A naval base may be present. A scout
base may be present. A surface installation is present. A highport may be
present (generally if the world atmosphere is 2+).
	C. Routine quality starport with unrefined fuel available on site.
Facilities include some capability for repair (primarily replacement of
QSDS-certified parts). A naval base is usually not present. A scout base may
be present. A surface installation is present. A highport is usually not
present.
	D. Poor quality starport with unrefined fuel available on site or close by.
It has no repair or construction facilities. A naval base is not present. A
scout base may be present. A surface installation is present. A highport is
not present.
	E. Frontier starport. With no facilities, the installation is little more
than a flat expanse of bedrock and a sign. This designation effectively means
there is no starport.

Spaceports
	Worlds other than the mainworld in a system may also have spaceports.
	F. Routine quality spaceport with unrefined fuel available on site and minor
repair facilities. A system defense field may be present. A military base may
be present. A surface installation is present. There is no highport. This
designation is a poor cousin to starport type B.
	G. Poor quality installation with unrefined fuel available nearby. No repair
facilities are available. A system defense field may be present. A military
base may be present. A surface installation is present. There is no highport.
This designation is a poor cousin to starport type C.
	H. Primitive quality installation with no facilities beyond a beacon
identifying the location. Unrefined fuel may be available nearby. This is a
surface installation; there is no highport. A system defense field may be
present. A military base may be present. This designation is a poor cousin to
starport type D.
	Y. No spaceport. This designation is the equivalent to starport type E.

THE ELEMENTS OF THE STARPORT
	A starport at its simplest is a bare spot of bedrock capable of supporting a
ship which wants to land. The remaining elements of a starport are added
later to support and maintain the traffic that passes through the port.

The Basic Elements
	Each starport is characterized by a few basic elements. Without them, the
starport is not really a starport.
	The Beacon. The location of the starport is broadcast throughout the system
from a central beacon. At its simplest, the beacon puts out a continuous tone
which allows ships to home on its position. In more complex systems, the
beacon provides range and position information for ships in the system,
traffic control information on sister frequencies.
	The Landing Pad. Starships approach from beyond the atmosphere. When
starships set down, most make use of their lifters in order to make a smooth,
relatively slow approach along designated approach corridors. To deal with
ships  with disabled lifters, or for ships which use lifting surfaces, the
landing pad includes long, broad runways.
	For highports, this a designated holding area.
	Traffic Control Facility. Space traffic controllers provide basic
information to ships within the system, vectoring them safely in their
approaches or departures. The traffic control facilities are located at the
starport. In some systems, an auxiliary control facility is located in an
outer orbit.

The Terminal
	The starport terminal houses the basic services for passengers and freight.
	The Concourse. Passenger services are handled at the concourse. Ticketing,
baggage check, and final boarding all take place at this facility.
	Freight Docks. Freight (materials carried by ships for a fee) is loaded and
unloaded at the freight docks. Speculative cargoes are held until sold at the
exchange.
	Customs and Immigration. Applicable laws concerning the people and goods
moving to the world are enforced by Customs and Immigration.
	The Exchange. Speculative cargo is bought and sold at the Exchange. A
variety of brokers handle the transactions and make the process=20
	Accommodations. Passengers passing through the starport can stay overnight
at the starport hotel, buy meals at a variety of restaurants, purchase basic
goods and souvenirs at the shops, and pass time at theaters or entertainment
complexes. The level of accommodation available varies widely.
	Data Terminals. Information is available about the world, its products and
services, and recreation at a variety of data terminals. On some worlds, the
data terminal may be a computer; on others, they may be staff people with
prodigious memories; on yet others, they may be librarians).
	Message Center. Access to communications, including physical mail,
electronic mail, telephone, and video is generally available at the message
center.
	Emergency Medical. Suitable facilities are provided for emergency medical
treatment. The medical staff has the training and experience to deal with a
wide variety of medical emergencies.

Peripheral Facilities
	Situated around the edges of the starport are a variety of associated
activities and facilities.
	Starport Defense Establishment (SDE). In addition to security personnel (who
function as police), a starport may have an SDE (with a military function).
The SDE is established to defend the starport against organized assault, and
its equipment may include troops, fighter craft, missile defenses, and
artillery. The SDE, to maintain its independence from the the local world, is
often a mercenary force specifically created for the job.
	Since an SDE is rarely larger than absolutely necessary, it is possible to
gauge the local perceived threats to a starport by observing the size and
equipment of the LDE.
	Scout Base. The scout service (whether of the Imperium or of some other
interstellar community) may maintain a port facility for the support and
maintenance of its vessels (including those vessels which it may have out on
loan to detached duty scouts). It is possible that the world on which a scout
base is located is not a member of the  interstellar community which the
scout service serves.
	Many scout bases make the information they have accumulated available
outside of their service (including maps, charts, and world surveys).
	Naval Base. The Navy (whether of the Imperium or of some other interstellar
community) may maintain a port facility for the support and maintenance of
its vessels. The base includes administration sections, warehouse for
provisions and resupply, and some security personnel.
	The continuing interest of naval personnel in their career area makes naval
bases favorite stopovers for veterans (even of other navies).
	Sometimes a specific naval base may be considerably more extensive than the
typical installation. Their facilities and equipment come to dominate the
starport rather than complement it.
	System Defense Field. The interplanetary defense forces of a system may
maintain a facility for the support of their vessels (system defense boats)
as they rotate off station from the outer reaches of the systems. The field
has a minimum of facilities (provisions are trucked in when needed; repair
trucks call as required).
	Shipyard. Ships are built at shipyards. For ships of moderate size which
will be streamlined and capable of landing on worlds, construction often
takes place on world surfaces at starport shipyards.
	Most shipyards specialize in the construction of a specific assembly (which
local industry has shown itself capable of producing) such as jump drives,
avionics, detectors, or even stateroom modules. Other components are
purchased from other shipyards and imported as part of the QSDS-certified
parts system.
	Warehouses on-site store components until they are ready for assembly. Ships
themselves are constucted in open-air bays (or in enclosed assembly
structures if the local environment requires).
	Repair Facility. Minor repairs to ships are often accomplished on the
landing pad. More complex or extensive repairs require that the ships be
moved to the repair bays at the edge of the starport. Support installations
near the bays house the instrumentation and equipment necessary for repairs.
	Transport Hub. The starport is usually integrated into the global
transportation net, and arriving passengers transfer from the terminal to the
transport hubs. Depending on the world, the hubs may support sea or undersea
transport, air transport, or ground rail transport. In addition, personal
vehicle rental may be available.
	Industry. Many industrial processes are best carried out in zero-G and/or
vacuum. What better place for such operations than adjacent to a major
orbital transportation center? Industrial modules attached to the Highport
create products or commodities which benefit from immediate access to the
ships calling at the port. Some factories have long-term supply contracts
with the highport itself.

Organization
	A starport has an organizational structure which includes a leader and a
mission; the details of each starport are different, although they are
generally variations on a basic theme.
	The Port Authority. Regardless of the local government in power at the
starport, the governing authority for the facility is the Port Authority.
Financed by a variety of charges and levies on passengers, cargo, and ships,
the Authority uses its money to build and maintain its facilities, and to
provide variety of services. Like starports, Port Authorities vary widely in
structure and approach to their responsibilities. Some are strong corporate
organizations devoted to the pursuit of profit; others are non-profit
organizations which view their responsibilities more as services to the
citizenry; yet others consider themselves a quasi-official arm of local
government.
	The Port Warden. The person in complete charge of the starport is the Port
Warden. Appointed by the Port Authority, the Warden is the chief executive
officer for the facility, and wields great, but not unlimited power.
	The Mission of the Starport. The starport, as an organization, is committed
to a mission (although that mission may not be clearly or publicly stated).
Typical missions are:
		To efficiently provide facilities and services necessary to accommodate
interplanetary and interstellar traffic for this world.
		To produce a maximum of income for the organization which operates this
starport.
		To insulate this world, to the maximum extent possible, from outside
influences.
		To meet the minimum requirements for maintaining interstellar trade.
	Regulation Enforcement. The police and security arm of the Port Authority
has the responsibility of protecting the orderly operation of the starport
and of enforcing its regulations. It consists of enforcers and emergency
techs.
	The typical enforcer carries out the role of helpful police officer, often
assisting passengers in mundane tasks. Behind the scenes, however, a
stronger, better armed force stands ready to back them up if necessary.
	Emergency techs provide basic services such as paramedical response, rescue
operations, and fire fighting. Emergency tech stations are situated
throughout the starport, providing the ability to make a quick response
anywhere within the starport=92s boundaries.

Each Starport Is Unique
	Starports vary widely due to the circumstances and environment in which they
exist. When the differences in world size, atmosphere, and hydrographics are
coupled with population and technological levels, government, and trade
classifications, it becomes clear that each starport is an individual
facility.

UNOFFICIAL FACILITIES
	Not all facilities at a starport come under the jurisdiction of the Port
Authority.
	The Scout Lounge. Those who conduct surveys of star systems and who
continually venture out into unexplored or under-explored space are a special
type of people. After long periods of time alone or with their fellow crew,
they naturally gravitate to others of their kind... to share stories and
experiences which may help them survive. The typical starport has a Scout
Lounge for this type of people.
	The Scout Lounge is usually operates as a semi-private club; theoretically
anyone can use its services, but in practice it is only patronized
comfortably by scouts (and those with an affinity for scouts).
	The Hiring Hall. Crew members looking for work gather at the hiring hall.
Ships calling at the starport look first to the hiring hall when they need
new or replacement crew. Because of ship schedules which must be met, it is
possible for a crew person to be hired and off world within a few hours
notice.
	The Lone Star. Many starports have a recreation facility which welcomes and
serves all comers. At its tables, people meet and enjoy light music or video,
conversation, and meals. To many the Lone Star is an opportunity to meet
others on a casual basis, to develop acquaintances, and even grow them into
friendships.
	The Traveller=92s Aid Society. Some individuals make travel their primary
vocation. If they are able, they join the Traveller=92s Aid Society, which
provides facilities to its members. The Traveller=92s Aid Society is a joint
operation of several large hotel chains, which provide the facilities within
or adjacent to their own hotels and restaurants.
	Members join by depositing a large sum of money as annuity, with the
proceeds paying for the benefits they receive.
	Startown. Although starports are often established near large cities, the
community which springs up at the gates to the starport has come to be called
(generically) Startown. This community is the home of many of the starport
employees and houses many stores, restaurants, and bars that serve those who
want to wander outside of the starport=92s boundaries.

UNDERSTANDING STARPORTS
	The key to understanding a starport is a continuing awareness of its
purpose. Starports exist to foster traffic, and thus trade, between the
stars. Governments may attempt to control or suppress the activities of
starports, but when they do, they naturally suppress the benefits of trade
and commerce for their worlds. The natural state of starports is to flourish;
if the starport=92s world has resource which can be profitably marketed to
other worlds, the starport generate economic benefit.
	Extra-Territoriality. In order to foster interstellar traffic, starports are
extra-territorial. Just as embassies are treated as if they are the territory
of their owning nations, starports are treated like they are off-world space.
Passengers and crew alike are allowed to leave their starships and wander
freely (subject to security and safety restrictions) throughout a starport.
Goods are not subject to customs or taxes until they leave a starport. The
laws of the world do not apply to until a traveller leaves the starport.
	Law and Order. There must be some law and order within a starport, and the
means of achieving that order is the local Starport Regulations. Established
by the Port Authority, these regulations define in detail what behaviors are
permitted and prohibited. For most people, ordinary behavior is sufficient to
stay within the regulations. Strange requirements are typically posted
clearly.
	Ship Construction and Repair. Starships and spacecraft require an extensive
system of construction and repair sites, and the overhead of designing and
maintaining the many parts which go into ships can be overwhelming.
Consequently, many starports subscribe to the QSDS (Quality Ship Design
Scheme): a set of standard component specifications which are manufactured on
worlds with the appropriate tech level and industrial capacity, but which can
be assembled and maintained at any starport of the appropriate type,
regardless of local tech level or industrial capacity.
	Money. Ultimately, every starport must make money if it is to remain in
operation. Starports cannot give their services away, but most find a way to
hide those charges away from the consuming public. Restaurant charges include
a surcharge; starship lines pay a portion of their ticket price and freight
charges to the starport. Since all of this is concealed from the typical
passenger, the impression is that the starport is a free facility.

STARPORT AMBIENCE
	The ambience of the starport is of prime importance. When travellers arrive
at a starport the atmosphere and the condition of the facilities create an
impression that will stay with them for a long time. This impression (and the
elaboration of this impression) develops over time.
	The appearance of a starport may range from modern or new to old and
decayed.
	The staff of a starport may be respectful and attentive, or rude and
obnoxious.
	Officials may be straightforward and honest, or they may be corrupt and
self-serving.=09

MANY DIFFERENT STARPORTS
	Starports vary in the way their provide their services. Major influences on
them include the world trade classifications, the elements of the UWP, and
other less clear factors.
	Water World. With land at a premium, starships land in the water (perhaps
sheltered by natural or artificial islands) and are serviced by boats.
	Asteroid Belt. Ships dock in the microgravity of an asteroid.
	Storms. If a world has an exceptionally turbulent atmosphere, most traffic
may choose to call at the highport and shuttle down on craft specifically
engineered for local conditions.

THE STARPORT VISIT
	A ship entering a star system leaves jump space approximately 100 stellar
diameters out (typically at interplanetary range). The approach to the
starport takes perhaps a day, during which the appropriate radio contact and
identification procedure completed.
	At the world, the ship completes a landing maneuver while in voice and data
contact with the local space traffic controller.
	Once at the surface, the ship settles into its assigned landing bay.=20

Because it\'s out there.

Ok, so now I\'m being nitpicky, but just as a fun fact to know and tell, the
hominids that were H. sapiens 300k years ago did not look like the humans
that run around cluttering up the Earth in our present. About 40-60kya, of
course anthropologists can\'t give us an exact date, anatomically modern
(a.m.) H. sapiens started popping up all over the globe and archaic H.
sapiens started to disappear. The characteristic features of this new
organism were almost entirely in the skull. The occipital bun (the point in
the back) of the skull vanished, as did the protruding jaws (except in some
football players-cheap shot, but I was a football player, so what the hell) ;)
The features were more that of what had previously been premature H.
sapiens. There haven\'t been many convincing theories to explain the abrupt
change in skull characteristics other than possibly a reduced reliance on
needing to chew and tear extremely tough food or leather for tools and the
recession of the glaciers, radically altering what they had to eat. The
occipital bun and strong protruding jaw exist in primates and our
ancestors, with powerful jaw muscles connecting in the back of the skull
kind of like an anchoring point. As we developed into what we like to call
civilization, it is theorized that there was less need for the ability to
eat unprepared, scavenged food that would require such strong jaw muscles.
It\'s a bit weak, but it\'s all they  have last I heard. You could go that or
if you wanted to be really adventurous you could play around with
explanations by people like Zechariah Sitchin or Will Bramley (but not Von
Daniken *blech*).
Archaic H. sapiens and a.m. H. sapiens (enough periods for you?) were by
all indications completely interfertile and the archaics shared many
features with what we now call classic Neandertals, which, it would seem,
were a very strongly glacially adapted subspecies that probably melded its
way back into the main sapiens populations with the recession of the
Pleistocene glaciations. 
An interesting divergence off this would be, are there still human
subspecies that have the archaic look, and how would that affect their
cultural growth? What they eat and how civilization developed for them.
Always someway to link it back to traveller. :)
