Well, as fair as I can see, this thread is pretty analogous to the two
schools of character generation;
a) You generate all the stats, a la CT, and the fun part is creating a life
story about thos stats, or
b) You roleplay through the life (the fun part) and assign stats along the
way. (Often used for TNE).

Just as both of the above are equally valid, so both ways of creating worlds
are valid. I have feeling we\'re going to see the same arguments stated and
restated on both sides without reaching a conclusion. Don\'t worry about it,
there\'s really no conclusion that needs to be drawn.

	Hi, Thad!
	Well, any doctrine discussion I have ever read indicates they are
supposed to be ambushing the Big Boys in places like the Gas Giant during
fueling ops.  No number of 400dton SDB\'s are going to worry a Tigress, or
even an Atlantic;  even encumbered by a gravity well.  So the design seems
contradictory to the mission doctrines I have read.  Really, the SDB ought
to have at least a bay weapon to worry a cruiser.

	Yeah, I suppose this is a good job for small ones...  treat them
as non-jump Patrol Cruisers.

	Hmmm...  I dunno if I can accept that...  even with TCS rules, any
world big enough for a class B port ought to be able to build a DesRon per
decade, even if they are frugal about defense spending.

	Which is most likely the case, now that you say it.  Light patrol
SDB\'s that you don\'t mind being out in the open, and the bigger attack
ships that you keep hidden.  Yeah, that would make some sense.

	See what happened to the light attack craft (which are basically SDBs) in
Honor Harringtons universe when they run into the starships. Either they
successfully run away or they die, in large numbers.

ACQ. And two adventures; one you\'ve seen before mangled by IG in Missions
of State which is now restored to its full non-IG\'d version, the you won\'t
have seen unless you\'ve played any of our tournaments. The adventures
should be usable with any version of Traveller. The TML said it wanted LBB
style adventures packed with deckplans, maps and plot, so we\'ll watch the
sales of these with interest.

How many we have ready depends on how smoothly the layout etc goes. I would
bet on three, not four releases.

This problem has been around since Book 6: Scouts. Basically, the CT method
of generating mainworlds doesn\'t match the real world parameters for
generating star systems.

The best solution I found was to start with the mainworld and work
backwards, filling in the details and fleshing out the rest of the system
from that. Even then, you frequently get lots of anomalies that need
hand-tweaking.

Try this URL - I suspect that it is the correct CD but you may want to

That\'s why us "old-timers" are so useful. Before the microcomputer
revolution, it was pretty much a *given* that you were going to wind up
doing some financial programming at least part of the time. So we were
*required* to take accounting.

Introduce double-entry bookkeeping and the kinmgdom\'s "bean counters"
will love you. The folks who fudged their books won\'t be as happy. 

Heck introducing "positional notation" may be a major revolution. And
the abacus goes well with that breakthrough.

That\'s a good argument.  I agree that Vilani law and legal institutions
will be preserved on many worlds of the Imperium as matters of local
law.  I don\'t, however, think that Imperial law itself will be devoid of
Vilani law.  After the fall of the Ziru Sirka, the Solomani were
overwhelmed trying to manage the huge empire that they\'d conquered. 
They would have tended to leave in place institutions that worked and
were not security problems.  Vilani laws and legal institutions in
general would not have been security problems.  The Solomani-dominated
Rule of Man would have kept a lot of the Vilani laws and legal
institutions because it didn\'t have the resources to reshape millenia of
legal habits, nor did it have the political will for or interest in
radical transformation of the Ziru Sirka

Vilani society is so tradition-bound that it would certainly keep
extensive records of how legal problems were solved in the past.  That
would give it something of a common law flavor.  On the other hand,
Vilani society doesn\'t tend to solve problems by appeals to authority
and application of force.  Instead it relies on mediation, and, to some
extent, deference to experts.  That gives it a very different flavor
from the common law.  What implications does that have for the nature of
Vilani legal institutions?

Here is my quick list of sources of law within Imperial borders:

Imperial edicts;
Imperial administrative codes implementing edicts;
Imperial administrative codes promulgated and used by the bureaucracies
without authorization of the Emperor (that\'s not illegal in my Traveller
Universe);
Imperial traditions (which include some pre-existing Vilani law);
Patents of nobility (which may confer lawmaking power on nobles);
Manorial law (Noble-made law within fiefs);
Treaties (membership agreements?) between the Imperium and its member
states;
Treaties between the Imperium and foreign states;
Treaties between local worlds and foreign states (to the extent not
pre-empted by Imperial treaties);
Various sources of local law.

In my Traveller universe, by 1100, all of the major states (Imperium,
Zhodani Consulate, Aslan Hierate, Solomani Confederation, Hive, Two
Thousand Worlds) have treaties with and official recognition of each
other, even if they don\'t really interact (like the Aslan and the
K\'Kree).  There are a few conventions of diplomatic conduct agreed upon
by all of the major and minor players, such as extrality of embassies.  

Some treaties are nothing more than a statement of mutual recognition
and an agreement to exchange ambassadors.  Some involve agreements to
consult on issues of mutual importance (like border zones).  Some are
trade agreements, which can take many forms.

Law skill indicates that the character can approach legal problems in a
legal way.  A character trained in one legal system can work within it
to achieve results.  In another legal system, that character will face a
more difficult (but not necessarily impossible) task.  An analogy can be
drawn to mech or elec skill.  Someone who acquired mech skill on a TL 7
world will have some difficulties in figuring out how mechanical things
work at TL 11.  If the character acquired law skill in legal system #1,
he or she will have to learn new specific information to achieve results
in legal system #2.  Nevertheless, he or she still knows in general how
to get things done according to law, such as how to marshall and
organize facts, the importance of finding information and likely places
to start looking, etc.  

That is to say, a character with law skill can think like a lawyer, and
to a large extent, lawyers from all legal systems tend to think in
broadly similar ways.  The more alien the legal system (and, presumably,
the more alien the culture), the more difficult it is to think like a
local lawyer.  That tends to be true for other communications skills,

What in the world was I thinking?  AR3 = Droyne and Hivers -
hardly party town material.  It does sound appropriate for

of them:

First, it was suggested that the data be made more "Traveller" and less
"GURPS" like. Or perhaps a hybrid of the two. I\'m going to stay clear of
that, because this _is_ a GURPS program - even if it is GURPS Traveller.
Thus, I\'m commited to displaying the format in a fashion that matches the
First In data. As far as rearranging some of the columns, that would proved
to be rather difficult, the way it is coded. See the system is
object-oriented, and each "Planet" object has an aggregate "Population"
object...when I print a listing line, the Planet object dumps its text,
followed by the Population object. Thus, I can\'t easily place the Starport
(in the Population object) in front of the Diameter (in the Planet object).
Now you may feel this was a dumb way to do it - but it works great from a
programmer\'s standpoint (IMHO).

However, the suggestion that I provided a alternative, standard CT output is
an excellent one. I had intended on building a CT converter into the
program - but have not started on it yet. This would be a good thing - so I
belive that\'s what I\'ll do - have two output formats, CT/MT/TNE/T4 and GT.

And it was also suggested that codifying the data is annoying - I partially
agree. However, it is the easiest way to provide a large amount of data in a
small amount of space. For those out there with old line printers, I\'m
committed to keeping the listing to a maxmum of 80 characters wide.

However, it should be stated that this is merely the listing output of the
program. The software also has a detailed output, which lists much more
information, in a easier to read (headings, plenty of space, etc) format.

Any more ideas, send them this way!

Adaptec makes some software that can be used for this.  I\'ve used it to
convert a couple of my favorite records to CD-R.  I\'ve not tried it with
tapes yet, as I don\'t have a tape deck at the moment.  However, the Guide
will probably be one of the first things I convert once I correct that
little problem, although I might put it on Minidisk instead.

I just checked the web page and clicked on the \'Radio Collection\' link out
of curiosity.  They\'ve got two other Guide CD\'s that look to be available,
and a Fawlty Towers CD.  Fawlty Towers had a Radio version?

I\'ve no idea what the story is with the other two Guide CD\'s but it says
they normally ship within 48 hours.

     Silicon is chemically related to carbon, but there are
important differences. Although the pure element has important
uses as in semiconductor technology, it is never found free in nature,
and it is always an energy-intensive process to extract it.
     While carbon atoms combine with hydrogen or oxygen with
approximately the same ease, silicon has a strong prefernce for
combination with oxygen. Although silanes analogous to the
hydrocarbons can be made, they are (unfortunately for speculative
xenologists) unstable and not found in nature, since they react
with water to form silicon dioxide and hydrogen. (not to mention
burning in oxygen)
     Silicon dioxide, also called silica, forms the basis for the
rock, the most common solid material. Unlike carbon dioxide,
which does not combine with itself and remains gaseous, silicon
dioxide molecules readily combine with each other.
     The highly stable and high-melting chains, sheets, and 3d
networks formed by silicon dioxide create the large, complex
family of silicate minerals which are the primary rock formers
eveywhere. The basic unit of silicate minerals is a tetrahedron
with a silicon atom surrounded by 4 oxygen atoms, each free to
combine with another silicon, or some other variety of atom.
There is also a less common high pressure form. The variety of
atoms that can fit into the fundamental silicate network gives
them a variety second only to the complexities of organic
chemistry. The silicates have a more continuous range of
compositions and are harder to work with, but high-tech materials
science includes a wide variety of special purpose ceramics and
derivatives.
   Although pure silicon dioxide is important in industry (a
source of silicon for semiconductors to name only one), it is not
especially common in this form. Silica is usually mixed or
compounded with something else. Silica bearing mixtures are as
common as ordinary rock, and mostly about as valuable.
Commercial-grade deposits are found where natural separation and
concentration process work, mostly on cooler planets with with
significant water, carbon dioxide, and weather.
     Also unlike carbon dioxide, silica is almost insoluble in
water. It does forms an extremely dilute solution of silicic
acid; (mostly H4SiO4). The solubility is enhanced in hot alkaline
solutions. As soon as it becomes concentrated, however, the
silicon tetrahedra start to recombine by eliminating water
molecule between them. There are terrestrial organisms (such as
some plankton and sponges) which incorporate dissolved silica
into their skeletons, and besides the fact that such skeletons
are brittle, inflexible, and heavy if they are dense, there is no
fundamental reason higher forms of life can\'t do the same.

If the life is the result of a separate evolutionary pattern then things
like diseases are not a problem. I\'ve always held the view that except on
Vargr worlds, which might have some other Terran species transplanted by the
Ancients, bacteriological and viral pathogens do not present much of a
hazard. I sort of handwave the unsuitability of food in such an environment.
Strictly speaking if the bacteria can\'t attack you then the animals and
plants shouldn\'t be safely digestible either. At various times I\'ve used the
"such food is specially processed" excuse or the "genetically tailored
symbiotic in the offworlders intestine" excuse. Pretty lame but better than
wiping out the PC\'s every time they land on a new planet with some horrible
disease they can\'t possibly have an immunity to.

I may have a possible answer to this.  I do not own the  CDs  but
do own the following:

- - A set  of  6  cassettes  containg  all  12  original  broadcast
  episodes (both series) ... 30min each episode.

- - A double LP record containing series 1 (upto but not  including
  "The Restaurant At The End Of  The  Universe")  completely  re-

- - A single  cassette  of  "The  Restaurant  At  The  End  Of  The
  Universe" completely  re-recorded  with  superior  effects  and
  music ... with some minor plot alterations and tweaks.

(I don\'t know if series 2 was ever re-recorded ... I hope  so  as
the re-recorded series 1 is genuinely much better.)

So, when buying THHGTTG the first question is  what  version  are
you actually getting.  I *suspect* that the two cheaper  listings
are for the re-recorded series 1  (parts 1 and 2)  and  the  more
expensive listing is for the complete  original  broadcast  (both
series) ... but I could be wrong.

corespond to "greenhorns" and "old-timers".

the position of a few inner planets.

Any chance we could define our own format for the output? Alternatively if you
output in spreadsheet acceptable format then we could create our own "style
sheets" to rearrange data into personally preferred formats. In fact you could
include a few default ones with the app for different uses (e.g. CT UWP, scout
oriented, merchant oriented, military oriented).

I also noticed that your average planet size is around 3500 miles whereas I
calculated that the average should be at least 4100 miles (Based on 52% 2d6-4
and 48% 2d6-2 for the primary star). This implies that there are a quite a few
life zone planets in your list orbiting M class secondary & tertiary stars. 
Is this true?

Does this mean that the Imperium as a whole lives on uninhabitable
worlds?

No, I just think it means that the the survey data is bad. The program
used to create the Second Survey data suffered some clear problems with
random number generation (cf. Mark Gelina\'s artcle on collapsing worlds
in Challenge 76) The Spinward Marches has more of it\'s population on
\'habitable\' worlds than any other sector, by almost 15%. (The lowest is
Magyar, with only 22% of it\'s population living on such worlds.)

This means that the Spinward Marches data was tweaked extensively by
hand, as opposed to the rest of the Imperium, which was generated by
the somewhat flawed world generation system.

     Since water is more abundant than many elements and forms an
important part of many compounds, discussion of the various
minerals is incomplete without mentioning hydroxide minerals. 
     Hydroxide compounds may be treated as the reaction product
of an oxide with water. Silicic acid, already mentioned, and
carbonic acid, formed when carbon dioxide dissolves in water, are
examples. These are only found in an excess of water, but many
other hydroxides are insoluble minerals. Elements which combine
with more than one oxygen may have partial hydroxides; the
silicates again as an example. Other minerals are much more
abundant, but since they are closely related to the oxides and
water is prevalent on planets interesting to humans, I mention
them earlier than their abundance merits.
     Hydroxides are low temperature minerals (as minerals go,
that is), and ice works as a source of water for them. Water may
be driven off from them by heating, so they are probably rare in
the inner zone. On the other hand, water does dissolve in molten
rock, so few planets are entirely without hydroxide minerals in
their interior. With high tech levels, a closed environment, and
tight water discipline, enough water to support a human colony
can be extracted from quite barren rockballs. It may be still be
cheaper to import it, though.

I\'m using PE in pre-M:0. Economic capacity depends a lot on
population, and there are entire worlds with less population than
NYC or LA. Such places may easily have a fine spaceport, but I
can\'t quite see the municipal budget running to DesRons. A few

Could you define what you mean by "ageless society, like 
the Droyne"?  According to AM5... with the exception of 
a VERY few powerful individuals, Droyne are short lived 
creatures.   They are fully mature at 13 and start to show 
the effects of aging at 20.  Leaders and Sports show 
less severe ageing effects, but even they rarely survive 
into their 50s.  In addition, Droyne who are "less efficient" 
due to aging commit voluntary suicide.

This is an ideal discussion for the Traveller-Culture list; feel
free to post it there.

I would expect that Vilani law would focus more on research of
precedent, and where precedent couldn\'t answer the question, a
mediation panel would be convened to decide it, with due
consideration given related case law. Law libraries would,
naturally, be _very_ complete, and once technology gets to a high
enough level, linked together. The question before the house
becomes "What is the composition of the mediation panel?" This
can be answered several ways, ranging from a joint panel composed
of members of all parties to the dispute to a panel composed of
specifically-trained "historical researchers" to a panel composed
of individuals selected on a basis similar to Aslan earleatrises

Actually, it\'s worse than that.  Remember the Hi-Pop worlds effect?  Over
90% of the Imperial population live on a comparative handful of worlds.

This may well be the cause of the differences you noted between sectors -
the smallness of the samples of hi-pop worlds in each sector could lead to
considerable variations in the statistics.

This is correct.  I was looking into this last night.  You could possibly
do the same thing with _fighters_, as long as you are prepared to pay for
decent computers.

Oh, and there seems to be a typo in Sup 9 - the missile and laser factors
in the SDB\'s USP seem to be reversed, although that doesn\'t actually affect
the situation we\'re discussing.

> The Sup 9 cruisers are all let down by their low armour factors and the

Yes, I was appalled when I realised how badly a high-jump factor
compromised these designs.  I tried to build a better design myself, and
found myself having to make ugly compromises all over the place.  The
hardest part was to convince myself not to reduce the jump capability to
J-3.  If you do that, of course, you can slap on decent amounts of armour,
and the SDBs will die all over the place.  There are other ways to free
tonnage for armour, but they have their own costs.  

You can also play silly sentients with your secondary weapons -
sandcasters, lasers and so on - to optimise them against lots of small
batteries, rather than a few big ones.

Anyway, the Sup 9 designs turned out to not be quite as sub-optimal as I
had thought  I think they need to be munchkinised a little, though.

Thing is: really \'proper battleships\' are likely to be battleriders -
non-jump capable, about 10kt, and with a spinal mount!  At this point there
is no difference at all between monitors (big SDBs) and battleships.

Bigger jump-capable battleships have many of the same problems as cruisers,
except that their greater displacement gives them a bit more scope for
fudging the problem.  This happens because the tonnage-based systems take
up a smaller percentage of their displacement, basically.  You can slap
more armour on them.

True.

I suggest that you try to recreate Sup 9 designs using HG2, then adjust
as you see fit.  The problem I\'ve run into the couple of times I tried
this is that crew sizes seem a bit low in Sup 9 designs, compared to
what I come up with using HG2.  I\'m using a kludged spreadsheet, so I
may be off on this, but this could be an issue (fewer crew means fewer
staterooms, thus more room for military features).

I haven\'t tried designing battleriders using HG2 (AuricTech Shipyards is
firmly committed to the design and production of expensive jump-drive
ships), but I would think that a battlerider with a capital ship spinal
mount would need to be in the 30-50 kdton range (assuming agility of 6,
and appropriate secondary mounts).

I might try to design a battlerider (using HG2) with a TIGRESS-class
spinal mount, just for the experience.  If I can pull it off, I\'ll post
it.

I rather expect the parties concerned would not be on the panel, rather that
it would be composed of mediator/counselors, experts on the matters at hand,
and legal research experts.  And possibly psychological people in the case
of family law.  After 3 divorces it seems obvious to me that this would be
the most graceful and orderly (hence, the most Vilani) way to do things.

The XBoat list kinda died quite awhile ago.  Right now, there\'s the 
\'mainstream\' list (this one, btw) where they talk CT/MT/T4, the TNE list, the 
\'Gearhead\' list where they talk Traveller technology, the \'Deckring\' list 
where they talk about starship plans & such, and prolly a couple others.  
Inactive lists I know of are the 4th Imperium list, and the HIWG list, which 
seems to be rather inactive at the moment.

AT GTL 12, a grav belt seems sensible, giving sustained slow-speed flight. 
Alternatively, just some contragrav to reduce apparent gravity to .01 G or
some such.

I think Exoskeleton would be more appropriate.

Robots is probably slightly easier, but Vehicles isn\'t that bad if you work
through it step by step and create a spreadsheet as you go.  The first
draft will be time consuming, but the subsequent iterations get easy. I was
scared off by Vehicles for a long time but just recently tried it again
using this approach and had not too much trouble.  I\'m still not a
gearhead, but I can play one on TV now.

BTW; the Scout Expedition Dress in First In may be pretty close to what you
want.  ST 30, DR only 40-60, plenty of weight for tools instead of sensors.

Actually, there are convincing arguments that there had been attempts
before Gutenburg. The thing is, printing presses are prety useless
*unless* you have invented *paper*. Otherwise you are stuck with
expensive and scarce items such as vellum.

My wife & I will be going to Aussiecon. She\'s never played Traveller before (but
has done other RPG\'s). I\'m mainly a CT/MT fan. We\'re from Sydney too - from
Faulconbridge in the Blue Mountains. We\'ll be driving down with some friends in
a very full car and staying near the convention at The Terrace.

<Interesting Factoid> One of the other hotels near the convention is called the
Enterprize (sic). We almost stayed there; just for the yuk value of saying
things like "I\'m going back to the Enterprize now for drinks" and an excuse to
wear our Starfleet uniforms. Then we found out how bad the hotel was and tried
elsewhere.

Here is a challange for the gearheads out there.

I am thrashing an idea of \'Roughnecks in Space" campaign, based on a mobile
contruction ship. What I am looking for is ideas for a GTL12 Civilian Power
Suit , designed for :

High powered tools , eg plasma cutters.
Ability to handle Industrial accidents (exploding buildings, near misses
with said plasma cutter)
Jump packs (for high mobility on high rises and for saftey)
Small range sensors (radar, heat/cold, sonar, structural stress detectors)
Control systems (for Jump packs, demolitions,tools,sensors)

The system would be controlled by civilian style controls (I envision that
Vac suit would be the controlling skill).

Envision Patlabor, with industrial mecha using controls like bulldozers, to
minimalise the new skills needed to use the equipment, and
millitary/parramillitary mecha using more advanced controls.

Hints on how this was made (Gurps Mecha/Vehicals II or Robots) as I get
lost easily in the vehical construction systems.

(with apologies to Thad Coons, whose \'Planetology 101\' series was an
inspiration for these posts) :-

Atmospheres can be divided by pressure and composition.
i. Pressure
The pressure of a gas is equivalent to the force its component molecules
impart to the walls of its container. This is a function of the kinetic
and potential energy of the molecules (in a gravitational field), which
is a function of temperature.

The following expression can be derived :-

	Py = Po.exp(-ngy/8312T), where

- - Py is the gas pressure at height y ;
- - Po the pressure at some reference point (e.g. sea level);
- - n the average molecular mass of the gas mixture (e.g. air is
approximately 79% nitrogen [N2=28], 21% oxygen [O2=32], so n=28.84);
- - g acceleration due to gravity; and
- - T the absolute temperature in Kelvin (Tk = Tc + 273.15 if Tc is in
celsius degrees, Tk kelvin).

There are several units of pressure measurement.
The two units from the S.I. system are the pascal (Pa) and the bar.
	One pascal is equal to one newton of force applied to an area of one
square metre. It\'s a pretty small unit. Most pressures are quantified in
terms of kilo- or megapascals.
	One bar is equivalent to one standard atmosphere (atm) of pressure.
	This is equal to 101.3 kPa, 760mmHg or Torr, or 14.5 psi. The latter
two measurements are sometimes encountered in physiology or industry and
variously refer to the force exerted by a column of mercury of the given
height, or pounds force per square inch in \'Imperial\' units.

In Traveller, atmospheres are divided up in the following manner based
on pressure (the following pressures are in atmospheres) :-

	  Traveller   \'First In\' / G:Space
Trace 	   < 0.09
Very thin  < 0.42	< 0.5
Thin       < 0.70	< 0.8
Standard   < 1.49	< 1.2
Dense      < 2.49 	< 1.5
Very dense > 2.5	>= 1.5
			superdense (e.g. Venus) > 10??

A \'high-pressure nervous syndrome\' has been described. It appears to be
a function purely of ambient pressure rather than the gas mix. Symptoms
and signs include tremors, drowsiness and decreased alpha activity on
the electroencephalogram [EEG] (consistent with drowsiness!).

ii. Composition
The chemical makeup of a planet\'s atmosphere is a complex function of
the energy delivered by the primary, the planet\'s gravity and geology,
the compounds available on the planet and their properties, and the
activity of native life (if any).
	The velocity of gas molecules is a function of temperature which
depends predominantly on the energy provided by the local star. If the
gas molecules can break free of the planet\'s gravitational pull, they
will be lost.
	Classically, gases obey Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics ; that is, the
molecules of a given mass of gas have a range of velocities - a speed
distribution.
	Temperature is an index of the most probable velocity and the standard
deviation of the distribution. Colder gas molecules are more closely
clustered around the most probable velocity with a smaller standard
deviation than the same gas at a higher temperature. 
	For a given gas, the most probable velocity is equal to :-
	v (m/sec) = sqrt(20373T/n),
 
where T is absolute temperature and n molecular mass of
gas concerned (H2 = 2, O2 = 32, etc.)
	So at 288K (25°C) : velocity of an oxygen molecule = 387 m/sec,
velocity of a hydrogen molecule = 1548 m/sec

	Escape Velocity (m/sec) = sqrt(2 * G * R),

where G is surface gravity (1G=10ms-2), R radius in metres.
Surface gravity can be determined as per the world generation rules
you are using. It is a function of planetary mass and size.

E.g. For the earth, escape velocity = sqrt(2 X 1 X 6.4 X 10^6) = 3578
m/sec.

Hydrogen has largely escaped Earth\'s atmosphere because it can reach an
altitude where it can get enough of a thermal \'boost\' to exceed escape
velocity. What hydrogen remains makes up most of the highest layers of
the atmosphere - the exosphere (above 600km altitude) where pressures
are on the order of 10^(-30) atm - rarefied stuff.

	Compounds available are restricted generally to those from the \'Cosmic
Top 30\' list of elements. This still gives us a lot of room to move in
:-
H2, He, N2, O2, F2, Cl2, Ne, Ar and compounds of B, C, Si, P and S.

* Some definitions :-
	* Melting point :- the temperature at which a substance changes state
from solid to liquid (typically at one atmosphere ambient pressure).
	* Boiling point :- the temperature at which a substance changes state
from liquid to gas (typically at one atmosphere pressure).
	* Critical temperature :- the temperature at or above which a gas
cannot be returned to a liquid state.
	* Partial pressure :- the overall pressure exerted by a gas mixture is
the sum of the pressures exerted by the components of the mixture. Each
of these pressures is a \'partial pressure\' and is proportional to the
number of gas molecules present. All partial pressures are quoted at 20
degrees Celsius unless otherwise noted.
	* Ideal gas :- one that obeys the ideal gas law :-

Pressure X Volume = number of molecules X absolute temperature X
constant

	Real gases obey a slightly modified (van deWaal\'s law) version of the
ideal gas law (molecules have finite size and exert attractive forces on
each other).
	* (Saturated) Vapour pressure :- the pressure exerted by the gaseous
component of a substance in equilibrium with its liquid component at a
given temperature. For example, consider water :-

Temp(C)  -10  0   5   10  15   20   25   30   37  50   75    100  200
SVP(mmHg) 2   4.6 6.5 9.2 12.8 17.5 23.8 31.8 47  92.5 289.1 760  11200

It can be seen that boiling point is attained when vapour pressure
equals atmospheric.

Note that the vapour pressure of water at 37 degrees is 47mmHg (0.06
atm). So at this ambient pressure or lower, a person\'s body fluids will
begin to boil.
Some form of pressure suit is therefore required for survival in
atmospheres rated \'trace\' or less.

Vapour pressure curves (pressure vs temperature) are the same general
shape (roughly exponential) but obviously vary greatly between
substances.

	* Humidity : Absolute humidity is the amount of water vapour per unit
mass or volume of air at a given temperature. Relative humidity is the
ratio of the amount of water vapour present to the amount of water
vapour present at saturation for a given temperature, and is the
quantity weather reporters talk about.

	Recall that living things will change the atmosphere at first from
photosynthesis or its local equivalent, and perhaps later with
agriculture and industrial activity.

* In Traveller terms :-
The list of atmospheres given above refer to those that contain oxygen
plus other (inert) gases. Dense/high, thin/low and ellipsoid subtypes
could have a similar composition.
	Exotic, corrosive and insidious atmospheres must be made up largely of
less benign substances (the subject of subsequent posts).

** Oxygen
Data : Formula O2, molecular weight 32, melts at -219C, boils at -183C,
critical temperature -118.35C.

This highly reactive substance is essential to the survival of most
species found in Charted Space ; not very surprising, given that oxygen
is the third most common element in the universe!

Production is typically the result of photosynthesis - the conversion of
carbon dioxide to sugars. Extreme volcanic activity can liberate oxygen
from silicon and other oxides which make up most of the mass of rocky
(and more dense) planets.

Oxygen is unlikely to be present in an atmosphere in amounts in excess
of 0.26 atmospheres as it will cause dry vegetation to ignite and burn
at this level. Beyond 0.30 atmospheres partial pressure, typical
carbon-based life will readily combust if exposed to flame.

Human oxygen requirements average 0.21 atmospheres pressure ; some
groups have adapted to pressures as low as 0.11 atm (equivalent to an
elevation of 5500m on Earth - where the highest permanent settlements
are).
	A compressor is therefore a minimal requirement for atmospheres rated
\'very thin\' or less.

* Lack of oxygen (hypoxia)
1. Nastiness
	The human body has negligible oxygen stores breathing 0.21 atm air,
some 450mL in an adult. Resting oxygen consumption is 250mL/minute, so
this supply will last roughly two minutes.
	Reserves can be increased a factor of seven by breathing 1.0 atm oxygen
and \'washing out\' all the nitrogen from the lungs.
	The effects of sudden pressure drops (on a non-acclimated person, if
acclimation is possible) :-

Effect			Oxygen Pressure (atm)	Altitude equivalent(m) 
Lose consciousness in
5 minutes			0.09			6100
2 minutes			0.08			7500
1 minute			0.07			8000
20 seconds			0.03			13700
(air mix - 21% oxygen)
Lose consciousness in
5 minutes			0.1			~14000
20 seconds			0.07			~17000
(breathing 100% oxygen) 

Breathing inert gas mixtures that don\'t contain oxygen will cause
unconsciousness in 20-30 seconds. Without oxygen (\'hypoxic hypoxia\'),
death follows from brain anoxia within 4 to 5 minutes of the onset of
unconsciousness.

2. Mountain sickness
This is a pathological adaptation to altitude.
(very likely with atmospheres rated \'thin\' - adaptation is possible
during the week of jump). Most people will pass a lot of urine for the
first two to three days, some will notice that they are hyperventilating
[The depth of ventilation *doubles* with every 0.007 atm fall in the
partial pressure of oxygen!]., and that\'s about it.

Onset is 8-24hr after arrival, and acute mountain sickness lasts 4-8
days.

Symptoms and signs include :-
impaired judgement, drowsiness, dulled pain sensibility, irritability,
excitement, disorientation, headache, anorexia, nausea, vomitting,
tachycardia and hypertension.

Severe cases of mountain sickness lead to potentially lethal flooding of
the lungs and brain swelling - pulmonary and cerebral oedema. This is
much more likely with vigorous activity or rapid \'decompression\'.

3. Features of chronic adaptation.
The main physiological changes seen are an increased red cell mass (to
maximise oxygen carrying capacity), enlarged hearts (blood is more
viscous, so it\'s harder to pump around) and chests (more work of
breathing being done - relative hyperventilation compared to
\'low-landers\').

* Oxygen excess (hyperoxia)
1. Up to 1 atm pressure
Used routinely in medicine with appropriate precautions, oxygen is a
very useful drug. It is not without its side-effects, however :-
- - drying of mouth, nose and lungs
- - reduced lung capacity ; at one atmosphere absolute pressure, 100%
oxygen will cause decreased lung volume within eight hours in previously
healthy volunteers.
	Marked diminution (15-20%) in vital capacity (lung volume) is evident
within 24 hours from absorption atelectasis (all oxygen removed from
alveoli, which therefore collapse).
- - chest pain - occurs within six to eight hours of 1.0 atm therapy.
Usually dull and associated with inspiration.
- - Within 48 hours, histological if not frank clinical evidence of
pulmonary oedema (lung flooding with inflammatory fluid) is present.
- - Premature infants are at especial risk of also developing retrolental
fibroplasia of the lens of the eye from ingrowth of blood vessels, if
exposed to 100% O2 for this length of time.

2. Hyperbaric
- - High partial pressures of oxygen leads to central nervous system
stimulation, which culminates in fitting. 
	Warning symptoms include :-
nausea and vomitting, muscle twitching, anxiety, vertigo, respiratory
changes or altered level of consciousness, sweating or behavioural
changes, and visual or auditory changes.
- - The likelihood of fitting is a function of partial pressure and
duration of exposure. Increased uptake (e.g. exercise) is another
important consideration.
- - At a partial pressure of oxygen of 4 atmospheres, fitting will occur
within 30 minutes in 50% of people. The dose response-curve rises
steeply beyond this. 
- - Hyperbaric chambers typically run with oxygen partial pressures in the
neighbourhood of 3 atmospheres. Exposure should be limited to less than
5 hours with O2 less than 3 atm pressure. Symptoms are uncommon with 5
minute air breaks for every 45 mins O2 (incidence less than 0.2%).

**Ozone
Data : Formula O3, molecular weight 48, melts at -193C, boils at -111C.

A much more reactive species than O2, ozone is commonly found in the
upper regions of standard atmospheres, where it helps attenuate stellar
ultraviolet radiation.

It is typically produced when O2 absorbs ultraviolet light or electrical
energy ; atomic oxygen (O) is formed which then combines with other O2
molecules to form ozone.

Ozone is a potent antimicrobial, and readily causes lung damage like 1.0
atm oxygen (lung inflammation and pulmonary oedema).

Level	Comments
80	Average level required to obtain \'good air quality\' index
160	Average level required to obtain \'standard air quality\' index
200	Abnormal lung function possible following 8 hours of exposure 
240	Abnormal lung function following 1 hour of exposure
400	Increased incidence of asthma attacks, etc. with any exposure
800	Increased risk for those with cardiorespiratory disease
1000	Healthy persons at risk. Minimise exertion, avoid any exposure.
1200	Premature death of ill and elderly. 

Ozone level is expressed in microg/m3 air at 1 atm and 25C ;
a level of 80 microg/m3 air is equal to a partial pressure of 3.1 X
10(-5)atm.

Lung function abnormalities at levels of 200 microg/m3 can persist for a
week or more.

either

d. Assume that even 80-column printers tend to have a condensed font
   (or graphics print mode) and go with 132 columns.

or

e. two page output - put system data (eg stars, gas giants, planets, bases)
   one page 1 and people data (eg population, government, trade) on page 2
   (or any other grouping by logic or program convienience) then people
   with 80 column printer can tape the two pages together.

   Oh and go with 72-77 columns so that it can be emailed and quoted.

   For data layouts like this multi-line text is a bit confusing.

I checked with the BBC via http://www.bbcshop.com/bbc_shop/

They used to do a CD set for about GBP40 (say 38) which had both series.

Now they do two CD sets - one for the first series and one for the second
- - each priced at GBP14.

Note that the CDs are the same as the audio tapes but different to the LP
(which is the same as the originally broadcast version). None of these are
the same as the video (although this is the same as the transmitted TV
version) and all are different to the books (unless you have the audio
tapes of the books - which are like the books but edited). The original
scripts might be the same as the broadcast version but I wouldn\'t bet on it.

Depending on the secondary weapons, it can be a lot smaller than you think.

Also, when firing Meson guns, you need large numbers of weapons to get the
"to hit" rolls. You don\'t need the extra damage rolls (and even a factor T
doesn\'t give many) you just need a large number of criticals rolled (the
armour reduction alone makes victims a sitting duck for small ships with a
decent computer).

The (IIRC) J-Meson is a pretty good choice in large numbers.

You\'re HERE?!  There\'s actually another Traveller player that I don\'t have

	Hi, Kiri, and welcome to the list. There are a number of us here

Fit?  I haven\'t seen much effort to fit around here, and that is the best
part.  We fight and call each other names and argue and sing ing the shower
and annoy each other half to death... that\'s why I love this list, just like
a family to me!

Welcome, Kiri, I hope you feel at home as well.  Stop by the Classic
Traveller Resurgence pages sometime.  Join in the fun.  Come chat in IRC at
#traveller on Undernet.  We\'re harmless, really (give or take a few near C
rocks).  We just wear BattleDress to be fashionable!

Subject: Auroral Lights On Io Reveal Secrets Of Jovian Moon\'s
         Atmosphere

<snip>
Last October, a team of American and Taiwanese space scientists
reported their discovery in images taken by the Galileo
spacecraft of colorful auroral emissions from Io during eclipse
by Jupiter. In tomorrow\'s issue (Aug. 6) of Science, they publish
results from an in-depth study of those images.

The tenuous atmosphere of Jupiter\'s moon Io partially collapses
in the darkness of the giant planet\'s shadow, they now find. At
the same time, bright blue glows emanating from stealthy volcanic
plumes grow even brighter.

<snip>
Io\'s aurorae, like those on Earth, are caused by the impact of
electrons on atmospheric gasses. Io is bathed by a swarm of charged
particles that are trapped by Jupiter\'s magnetic field, similar to
the Van Allen radiation belts surrounding our own planet.

In addition, a powerful electric current flows from Io to the poles
of Jupiter, caused by an enormous electrical potential some 400,000
volts generated by the motion of the jovian magnetic field past Io.
When these electrons collide with the gasses in Io\'s atmosphere, they
set off a dazzling light show of red, green and blue emissions bright
enough to be visible to the naked eye. The red and green glows may be
caused by neutral oxygen and sodium atoms, respectively. The bright
blue emissions are probably due to sulfur dioxide vented from volcanoes
on the moon\'s surface. Some of these plumes are invisible in daylight,
owing to a lack of entrained dust particles, and can only be seen
during eclipse, he added. The currents cause the gasses to light
up, much the same as the glows from florescent lamps.

Io\'s eerie glow dims noticeably with time as the satellite lingers in
Jupiter\'s shadow. The likely explanation, concludes the international
team of scientists that analyzed the pictures, is a partial collapse of
the moon\'s atmosphere during eclipse. Some of Io\'s patchy atmosphere is
derived from sulfur dioxide ice on the surface of the satellite that is
warmed by the Sun and sublimes (evaporates). This component probably
begins to recondense in the absence of sunlight during eclipse. More
surprisingly, the blue glows associated with volcanic plumes appear to
intensify while Io is in darkness. This may indicate that some of the
current flow between Io and Jupiter is conducted through the interior of
Io, particularly during periods when the atmospheric conductivity is low.

After someone (sorry I don\'t remember who) posted the web address of
Fantasy En\'Counter "www.fanen.com" (a german stockist of the encyclopedia) I just had
to spend my carefully saved pennies and get a copy.

So after a couple of e-mails and a fax, followed by a six day wait, I\'ve finally got my
copy, and a free TNE t-shirt.

The service I have received from Fantasy En\'Counter, especially Holger Willert, who was
very quick to respond to my e-mail, puts several of the \'F\'LGSs that I have visited in
England to shame.

If you can spare the 250 DM and desire a copy, Fantasy En\'Counter get my recommendation.

First impressions of the book...  well worth it.

I got into Traveller via the much maligned T4, so my knowledge of the alien races has
been restricted to the Aliens Archive, and more recently GT:AR1, so the encyclopedia
will substantially broaden my knowledge.  All I have to do now is find the time to read
it.

Sorry, if you consider this a waste of bandwidth, but I got so excited when it arrived
yesterday, I just had to let you all know.

    'body' => '5. Magnesium
     This is the most abundant of the metals. Magnesium belongs
to the chemically reactive alkaline earth family, and like
silicon, it is not found free in nature. It is an important
industrial metal because it is lightweight, and fairly easy to
separate from its compounds. On the downside, the pure metal is
not very strong. 
     Magnesium does not naturally combine with hydrogen. It
combines quite well with oxygen forming the oxide MgO. (TL 5-6
photography uses it for flashbulbs). The hydroxide Mg(OH)2
(brucite) occurs in hydrothermal deposits, since it is mostly
insoluble in water; but it reacts too well with acids for there
to be much of it. (Milk of magnesia is a suspension of magnesium
hydroxide)
     Even the oxide is chemically reactive. Nearly all of it is
found in combination with silica as the minerals enstatite
(Mg2SiO6, 2 units MgO, 2 units SiO2), and forsterite (Mg2SiO4, 2
units MgO, 1 unit SiO2). There is in fact slightly more magnesium
than silicon, more than enough to combine with all of it as
enstatite, but not enough to saturate it as forsterite. These
minerals tie up nearly all of both elements.
     Magnesium silicates are common throughout the solar system.
They are not especially abundant on the earth\'s continental crust
for reasons partly to be discussed later. One reason is that they
are (slowly) attacked by water. First, they are converted to
hydroxide minerals such as serpentine and talc, and then the
magnesium dissolves, leaving silica behind.  There is an
inexhaustible supply of magnesium dissolved in seawater, so there
is no need to go to space looking for it. (Seawater is already
the major commercial source, weathering can replace it faster
than human industry can extract it, and there\'s a whole planet
full of it.)  In vacuum, dry, or high temperature environments,
the magnesium silicates remain stable.

I have just had to re-assure a panicked fan that GURPS Traveller is only
TEMPORARILY out of print, because the first printing sold out before we
could get the 2nd edition back from the printers. He went to the web page
and saw that it was no longer available for order -- this is because we
have _none_ at the warehouse, although there are some in the distribution
chain still, I imagine)..

For some reason, Traveller fans are a little gunshy of the words "out of
print" -- dunno why...:  )

The printer assures us that the 2nd edition will be delivered in early
September, and you can order it then. The hardback edition, however, is
gone, except for whatever happens to be in the distributors\' warehouses --
we have none left here in Austin.

Its your program.  Sometimes you just have to put your foot down.  

One other thing you need to take into account ... when you get this 
licensed with SJG (which you need to do before you can distribute 
it), they are going to have the final say on what the output looks like.  
Does it pass their muster?  I would stick to their format first and then 
give an optional printout that is more than 80 columns.

Been there, done that.  :)  This one was worked up from a design in MT\'s
Fighting Ships (with bugs fixed) which had its silhouette used in Battle

(Islands Cluster Defence Bulletin)

ZUFLUCHT, 30 Jan 5636

With the conclusion of the recent naval review held by the Imperium in
the nearby Tobia/Tobia system, much new intelligence on Imperial naval
capabilities have come to light.  In particular, the Bulletin may now
release for the first time detailed information on the Imperial Navy\'s
ultramodern GALLANT-class battle rider.

  [adapted from FSOTSI, p. 34]

  The Gallant-class battle rider is perhaps the most powerful in the
  Imperial service.  Mounting the most energetic spinal meson weapon
  available, backed up by an amazing array of secondary weapons, and
  packaged in the most maneuverable, heavily armored and defensively
  screened hull that Imperial technology can build, battle riders of
  this class are meant to defeat the best ships the enemy can field.

Oops. It\'s "tholins", not "tholens"; Dave\'s name must have subconsciously
confused me.

If you\'re looking for references, do a search on tholins at
http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abstract_service.html
(NASA\'s electronic abstract service of pretty much all papers published
in astronomy in the last zillion years) for "tholins".

- - from The Economy of Nature by Robert E. Ricklefs

Ricklefs also notes that, generally, terrestrial communities have no more
than 3 trophic levels (plants, primary consumers, secondary consumers, and
tertiary consumers). Some carnivores may occasionaly act as quaternary or
even higher consumers, but they must get the bulk of their diet at the
tertiary level or lower. Aquatic communities may be deeper, with 1 or even
two more levels than is typical for terrestrial communities.

Kozlovski\'s rule (that each trophic level has about 10% of the biomass of
the next lower level) has been mentioned, and it is a good rule of thumb.
Somebody asked about "cold-blooded" animals vs "warm-blooded" animals with
regard to this rule. According to Recklefs, the "ecological efficiency"
generally varies between 5% and 20%, with "warm-blooded" animals tending
towards the lower values and "cold-blooded" animals tending towards the
higher values. There are, of course, many factors that influence ecological
efficiencies, but this should give a good range for realistic numbers.

I picked it up last week, and have either been too busy or ill to really
get into it in depth.

My first impression was that I hated the minor races presented.  Seriously
ick.  With all the great minors mention through the years, why these
kludges?  The space would have been better used on the Ael Yael, the
Githsanko, or the Jgd-ll-Jaq.

There are also some changes to the K\'Kree timeline, mostly surronding the
War against the G\'naak, but I\'ll have to sit down and cross check to really
nail it down.

So far, I give it a three out of five.

 in one case (Junidy), "roughly half" (according to the Traveller Adventure)

inhabitable, thank you. You may find or determine IYTU that this is the case
elsewhere as well...

According to my CRC "bible" there\'s not just "atm" there\'s also
"atm(tech)". The later has the rather interesting definition of "1
kg-force per cm^2". Thus making it 9.8 newtons per cm^2. 

I can see why it exists. It\'s a *very* convenient unit for a lot of
things, and within a percent or two of the "std. atm.".

Should "Critcal pressure" be in the list? It\'s the pressure required to

It can also take much longer. For example, Robert Heinlein and his wife
lived in Colorado Springs (~1600 m) for a number of years before they
finally *had* to move to lower altitudes. His wife just couldn\'t handle
the altitude on a *long term* basis.

And I\'ve heard of other cases. So I assume there\'s a spectrum of
adaptability here. Some can adapt. Some can partially adapt, and handle
the lowered pressure for varying periods before they need to return to
higher pressurers. And some can\'t adapt at all (those being the ones
you described).

If you can find some info on the population percentage breakdown for
various periods before folks start having problems, it\'d be *very*
useful. 

Picture a character who can handle the low pressure for a couple of
weeks to a month. He takes a trip to a low pressure planet to make a
quick business deal. Then gets not only stranded, but cut off from the
port. He\'s got days to a few weeks before he\'s in *real* trouble. And
the rest of the party may have others who are susceptible, but don\'t
know it yet. :-)

Also, there are *limits* to how adapted you can get. Most "lowlanders"
*cannot* adapt to 2000+ meter altitudes well enough to have children at
those altitudes. That was a big problem for the Spanish in the Andes.
They had to keep the women at lower altitudes.

Expect worlds with thin atmospheres and that were settled by Solomani
to have a disproportionate number of Tibetan/Andean Indian type people.
This is because *they* can survive pregnancy at low pressures without
massive medical intervention.

> * Oxygen excess (hyperoxia)

Looks like we *can* have those planets with atmospheres only
breathable/usable at high altitudes merely by having high pressure and
"normal" percentages of oxygen. Only problem will be explaining why
everything doesn\'t burn at the lower altitudes.

Ozone is also *damned* reactive. It won\'t last long without *continual*
replenishment. That pretty much means that any planet with more than
"trace" an\\mounts at ground level has other *real* problems. Like
*nasty* levels of UV.

It\'s also somewhat important biologically. You see, this "unimportant"

North of you in San Rafael, I play GURPS Traveller.  I am also going to be

to the system.  Check out www.con-quest.com or drop me an email.

Traveller: The New Error, to some) bit the dust. Its original
charter was "Traveller discussion, and \'Traveller\' means \'Classic
Traveller Only\'".  This list, the Traveller Mailing List, has
always been all Traveller versions.  Welcome aboard.

>Thanks to Jeff Zeitlin for telling me about the lists!

¡De nada, chica!  Always glad to point a fellow Traveller fan in
the right direction!

No, the lists are independently operated, and maintain their own
subscription databases.  Traveller-Culture is my baby, hosted at
OneList.  Its mission is to develop source material for cultures
that would be encountered in a Traveller campaign; right now, our
focus is on the Vilani; eventually there will also be work done
on the other major races and societies, and probably some of the
interesting minors as well.

There are several other lists; checking my website, I see that I
have listings for eight other mailing lists (including
Traveller-Culture, but not including the Traveller Mailing List),
focussing on various "specialty" topics, including (but not
limited to) specific eras, technical development, and starship
design.

This list, however, is _the_ Traveller Mailing List - the central
meeting-place, if you like.

Well, to some extent, you\'re correct - but remember that the
Vilani don\'t have the same kind of background as Terran cultures
- - even given the diversity of culture that we have.  Vland was an
entirely different kind of environment, and the general consensus
seems to be that cooperation and consensus rather than
competition was a primary motivating factor in their development
- - because it was necessary for even minimal survival. So, with
that in mind, surely it\'s reasonable for the involved parties to
be at least heavily involved with the "solution committee".

I don\'t know if anyone has pointed out (I\'m a bit behind in the posts)
that you get interesting effects if using a single flywheel to power
moving vehicles - especially the first time you try and turn a corner.

Even though I use GT I generally start with UWP/UPP data, but I never
present it to my players. A UPP is a great way to list the attributes for
hundreds of worlds in a Survey Document, and maybe a Scout or an
Astro-Cartographer might use them, but the run of the mill spacer will look
up plain language information in his pocket-size hand computer.

Tatooine? I am loving these science threads, thanks for all the wonderful
ideas everyone! How about some steller physics and orbital ballistics to go
with these juicy First In threads? Scout type adventures have always been my
fave, although merchant runs a close second. Mercenary games are OK.

Does anyone know what the official Zhod color is? I\'m still working on that
Spinward Marches page and doing the political sections now. How about the
Sword Worlds? I am also looking for any other sybols in canon, except the 3I
sun. I have alot of those. Heraldric devices, subsector/sector/world crests,
etc. Thanks!

     As already mentioned, carbon dioxide dissolves in water to
form carbonic acid. Many oxides are alkaline (releasing OH- ions)
when dissolved in water. These will react with carbonic acid to
form carbonate minerals. Many carbonate minerals are only
slightly soluble in water. The result is that on planets with
liquid water and carbon dioxide atmosphere, silicate rocks will
be weathered and release the more soluble alkali metals. These
will then combine with carbonic acid and form slightly soluble
carbonate minerals. As these precipitate from the seas and form
solid minerals, they extract carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
A great deal of the magnesium in the earth\'s crust, for instance,
is found in magnesium-bearing carbonates.
    Most of the carbonates are (as minerals go) soft, low-
temperature materials that release carbon dioxide when heated.
Like water, Carbon dioxide (and monoxide, formed by conversion of
methane) dissolves in molten rock, so some carbonate minerals
should be found in most planets. They will probably be scattered
throughout the crust of worlds that have never had liquid water
and not form extensive deposits as they do on earth, and they
will most likely disappear from the surface of the hot worlds of
inner systems.

Also Rethe is only 2 in size for the main world, is the entire population
always assumed to be on the main world? What about orbital colonies,
belters, sattalite colonies, research stations, etc.? And if a world is
Industral, that is why the air is bad and there is goo in the water, but
once it was nice. Maybe. Civ-burn is something that could be discussed on
this list, hint, hint. Then too, there is the possibility of genetic
manipulation, like in the case of the Jonkeeren(sp?), dolphins, etc. They
could have as different an idea of "comfortable environment" as any aliens.
Maybe even more, if the environment they are adapted to is unlikely to spawn
life. Just thoughts.

I\'ll do that, Colin.  I\'m reminded fondly of the days when I had the
Spinward Marches map on the wall of my dorm room as a poster...  When I was
playing last, Strephon and Iolanthe were still in charge (in fact, my first
ever character, Countess Julissa Myal di Baris, who went through the Scouts
in that little ol\' FASA "Scouts & Assassins" book, still has one of
Strephon\'s Imperial Warrants hidden about her somewhere... prolly tucked up
in her garter belt, along with that sweet little gun of hers.)

Our old campaign had much of the feel of Space Opera about it.

I just got off the phone with my friend in San Jose and he was telling me
about *his* old characters.  Maybe I\'ll talk him into joining us sometime...

Jiss wore Battle Dress when it suited her, but she also had a few really
entertaining dresses that she wore when she had to make an appearance in
Court-- or get information out of some recalcitrant official type.  I don\'t
know what I\'ll wear when I come to the party...

I played back when we used "Scouts and Assassins" because Book 6 hadn\'t come
out yet.  I still remember when we were all shocked by the oft-ignored rule

I use no more skills than INT & EDU.

And they\'ll get my copy of S&A from me when they pry my cold dead fingers off it.  Maybe.

    'body' => 'Since we\'ve got a HG2 thread going, I might take the opportunity to float
some ideas about how the Imperial Navy looked during the Civil War period
(including First & Second Frontier Wars).

All this is speculation for MTU, but comments/critiques are welcome, or
rather actively solicited.

So, the last major war the Imperium fought before the (First) Frontier War
was the Ilelish Revolt in the early 400s (MT Imperial Encyclopedia).  It
seems likely then, that the Imperial fleet may have been getting a bit
elderly, having been on peacetime budgets for a long time.   There would
have been R&D going on, and some new ships built, but probably there would
have been a lot of making do with what they already had.

On the other hand, the reserve fleets were probably pretty tough at this
time.  By 589, the Imperium had had TL 13 for a long time, and probably
would have had a fair few TL 14 worlds scattered around (MT Referee\'s
Companion).  (I\'m ignoring the presence of TL 13 and 14 worlds in Milieu 0
material here.)  The TL 14 worlds are the equivalent of the TL 16 worlds
that are around in Milieu 1100 - the cutting edge, rather than the
mainstream.

The result of this mature TL 13 technology would be that both the regular
and reserve fleets would tend to be using TL 13 gear, although the
regulars\' stuff would be newer.  The regulars would also have a little TL
14, while the reservists would also have a fair bit of TL 11 and 12.  (But
probably not much 10 - J1 is too limiting when it comes to strategic
movement.)  Note:  I\'m assuming that the reserve fleets use a fair amount
of hand-me-down, ex-regular gear.

There is a mention that new dreadnoughts were built during the Second
Frontier War, helping turn the balance in favour of the Imperium (GT Behind
The Claw).  These would, presumably, be TL 14 ships, more advanced than
what the Zhodani possessed.  I\'m not sure what TL the Zhodani would have -
it could either be 12, or a less mature 13.  The latter is possible, given
that the Imperium was on the brink of TL 14 (MT Referee\'s Companion).

The other question is doctrine - battleships vs battleriders.  There
doesn\'t seem to be direct evidence, but there are mentions of battleships
in a couple of places, and none of battleriders.  I suspect that the
Imperium would tend to favour battleships over battleriders at this point. 

The end result of all this is that fighters and SDBs would be more valuable
in this period than in Milieu 1100.  Essentially, this is because under
HG2, TL 13 missiles are as efficient as TL 15 ones, while TL 13 armour is
less efficient than TL 15 armour.  The "Cruiser problem" applies - it is
difficult to both armour a ship to withstand mass missile assaults and to
maintain a decent level of mobility.  This would tend to make the Civil
War/Early Frontier Wars period a good one for the fighter jock wannabes, or
else encourage a great deal of strategic immobility amongst battlefleets. 
Or both.

I am about to start implementing support for \'First In\' in my World Builder
Deluxe  program. I have been trying to decide how to input the base world
data that the program will use to generate the final detailed world and the
best way I have decided is to use the original CT/MT/T4 UWP code.

There is far too much original published information on Sectors to ignore
original UWPs and I am sure most GMs would prefer to use something they are
familiar with.

Anyone who uses my WBD program will be familiar with the Extended World
Profile (EWP) and Extended System Profile (ESP) which details all the
information generated by the WBH rules in a coded format. I think a modified
version of these for the \'First In\' rules would be the best way to present
the data proposed by Andy.

I must admit that I find the \'First In\' world generation rules to be a
little light on information and still prefer WBH rules. However, the system
generation rules are superior to MT.

IMO,  you were *right* about that!  The referee is *always* right. A rule is only a rule if the ref says it is, and the way a rule works is the way the ref says it works, no matter what!

I\'ve always wondered why it wasn\'t Dex+Int+Edu? There are a lot of physical skills that rely on Dex.

The trouble is that humans were also transplanted by the Ancients so any
system with humans could have human pathogens as well.

IMTU, human pathogens were pretty well distributed throughout all Imperial
space during the Interstellar wars, and cross-contamination has not been an
issue for milennia.

If everyone else is making suggestions, I have a few more: Include the year
the data is for, and an identifier for which sector the star is in. This
makes it possible to programmatically measure distances and make maps of
the sector data.

My suggestion is a 3-digit rimward/trailing offset from Core. So all
systems in Core have sector 00 00. Vland is -01-01, Old Expanses is 01 02.

>The problem is, I\'ve run out of space...

Well, you could go to a multi-line format with separate rows for different
data formats. Use an identifier for what format the row is. For example, if
A is astrographic data and P is political data, a system circa IY1100 in
Core sector (00 00), hex 1300 could start with:

A 1100 00 00 1300 ...
P 1100 00 00 1300 ...

This leaves lots of room for expansion, and can be made compatible with
different systems. For example, Classic Traveller UWPs could start with T,
GURPS data with G, and so on.

I\'m checking out the online resources for getting old stuff.  Never let
ex-boyfriends who are also gamers pack their own bags while you\'re at work
when you decide to throw them out.

I thought I had some Traveller rules left, I went thru the boxes today and
found out I have nothing at all.  But I think I know where I can get some
stuff locally.

You have to understand, Jeff mentioned this list on another list that he and
I are both on, and all of a sudden I thought...

"Damn, I really *miss* that game!  People still play?!?!"

Then it crossed my mind that while it had made sense ten years ago to stop
gaming so I could concentrate on writing my novel and doing my master\'s
thesis, the thesis is long done and the novel is nearly so and it might be
nice to get out and play with the other kids some.

I think a lot of us ignored death during generation.  It tends to be
counter-productive.

That makes sense to me, too.

In our old games, most everyone was old because they were all wealthy and on
anagathics.  Then again, we were playing a more "space opera" type of
campaign.  Think 3 Musketeers in Space.  Julissa really did have an Imperial
Warrant and eventually Empress Iolanthe gave her a necklace.  We never did
find out if there was anything more to the necklace other than coming from
Iolanthe (which was enough, of course!) and being very pretty.

That way, the GURPS interface is unchanged. Those of us who want/need
something different dump c or d to a text file and run it through
Perl or some other utility to extract and reformat it the way we want

based on _Fifth Frontier War_, the Zho\'s use blue.  I see them as a blue

The Sword Worlds use black on green, the Confederation logo is three swords

  {
    'body' => '7. Iron
     Iron is only slightly less abundant than silicon and
magnesium.  It is by far the most important industrial metal. The
earth has plenty of iron, and only the most highly concentrated
deposits have been exploited. For example, today ore containing
1% copper is considered a real find. An ore containing only 10%
iron is worthless. Iron can also be found in elemental form in
asteroid belts as a result of planetary formation processes (to
be discussed later) that concentrate it.
     Unlike the other elements so far considered, iron has two
stable ionic forms, Fe+2, and Fe+3. This produces two distinct
oxides: FeO, (Ferrous oxide,  wuestite), and Fe2O3 (Ferric oxide,
hematite). There is also a compound of these, Fe3O4 (magnetite).
These last two compounds are the principal forms found in the
earth\'s crust. Iron and the ferrous compounds are more stable in
vaccuum, dry, and low oxygen environments. On the earth\'s
surface, the generally reddish colored ferric compounds
predominate.
     Iron hydroxides and partial hydroxides are also known. Iron
rust, which only forms in the presence of both water and oxygen,
is a mixture of these. Ferric hydroxide is thought to be
responsible for the pronounced reddish color of Mars. These
compounds are barely soluble at all; more than silica, but less
than magnesium.
     From a cosmic point of view, the most important forms of
iron are the silicate minerals ferrosilite (Fe2Si2O6, 2 units
FeO, 2 units SiO2) and fayalite (Fe2SiO4, 2 units FeO, 1 unit
SiO2). It is actually quite difficult to separate magnesium and
iron silicates. Forsterite (the principal magnesium silicate) and
fayalite (the principal iron silicate) mix with each other in all
proportions, and the light greenish ferromagnesian silicate
mineral olivine is the result.
     Although there is not enough magnesium to saturate the
combining capacity of silicon, it turns out that inclusion of
ferrous oxide makes up the difference, so that the greatest share
of all three elements becomes tied up in olivine and related
minerals. This accounts for why these are the principal
components of stony meteorites and probably planetary mantles,
including the earth\'s. Other materials combine better with
silicon than iron does, so that there is a little iron left over.
Away from the earth\'s crust, most of the surplus is in the
form of ferrous oxide.
     Iron silicates are weathered by water in somewhat similar
fashion to magnesium silicates, so olivine does not last long
(geologically speaking) where there is plenty of water. There is
a ferrous carbonate (FeCO3) which can be found in older
sedimentary deposits, but the ferric ion created in an oxygen
atmosphere and carbonate make an awkward combination. Hematite is
more stable.

True; but this could be an "accident" of terrestrial life. There
are actually several varieties of chlorophyll, each responding
best to a different wavelength of light. AFAIK some other
metallic ion or even some entirely different kind of coupound
could serve the same function, given the appropriate biochemistry
and cellular machinery.
In different biologies, magnesium could easily play some different but
still vital role.  Such an abundant element is bound to find some use.

Many volcanoe are semi-permanent - either always there or recurring in the
same place, at least over the baseline of a few years that we know have (eg
Loki, which dominates the total heat flow, and Pele, where the plumes often
are, and Kanehekili, which Voyager didn\'t see but has been there consistently
in ground-based images since. There is a subclass of hot transient events
that only last a few weeks as well.

I like using the death during generation as a forced mustering out inspired
by the rule in Twilight 2000. Of course theirs is the beginning of WWW3, but
any event could be used from as personal as an accident to your person, to
the start of whichever Frontier War is coming up in YTU.

If you are going to bother with that, it may be a good idea to divide up the

to type.

It looks like one with the pommel at the top, pointing straight down, with
two others crossing the first below the hilt, right? Does it matter which
side the other two have their hilt on? We are not talking Darrian
Confederation, are we? This deals with "late 3I history" as in the campaign
I never got to finish playing. huh? My arbiter\'s weanie brother threw out

Most assuredly! I am just stating my page, and it has an overview of a
mildly heretical sector far from canon space, a page on life in that sector,
and a page on gravitics, which my roomie wrote. Still working on a Spinward
Marches map and some other goodies. Right now it is at:
http://www.sierratel.com/aum/BZAT/index.html
And the gravitics:
http://www.sierratel.com/aum/imtu_grav.html

This will all get much more organized soon. ;)

Bless you, for sticking to the truth path of Canon.

For any interested, I have a little .zip file that has my efforts with the
SWC logo (three versions, one with the name in proper Icelandic), and a
real cheap Zhodani logo that I will play with later.

I have a question that is for a different game, but it does have some 
relevancy to Traveller.

When a large foreign body enters the atmosphere of a planet, such as Earth, 
what are the effects other than the impact, seismic, and dust cloud are 
there?  What I\'m looking for is a natural way of disrupting electronics for 
a period of not less than 48-72 hours but retaining the chance that they 
will come online again.

I was thinking of some sort of meteor or cometary body entering the 
atmosphere and the temperatures encountered causing some sort of natural 
EMP or similar pulse.  I want to disrupt the technology for at least 
several days, not completely destroy it.

Or would a good old fashioned solar flare of Biblical proportions be better?

ObTrav:  The party in on a TL7-8 world when this occurs.  As their 
equipment is not effected, everyone from the government to the mob wants 
them to carry out a few \'deniable\' missions.  Or...the players have 
foreknowledge of this event happening and plan to use it to \'liberate\' some 
item or make a quick profit selling functional equipment at grossly 
increased prices.

Check the Interstellar Travel and the (very short) Trade and Commerce rules
on (IIRC) pp. 120-122. The Misjump rules should look much more like CT than
1/e did, and the trade stuff should parallel Far Trader.

Have bay weapons been corrected (in the design appendix) so that they are
consistently internal: i.e., no additional surface area, all spaces
internal, etc.?

There should be some corrections to the starship and spacecraft design
specifics (e.g., reducing the number of maneuver modules on the modular
cutter from 16 to 12), but nothing outrageous.

Most of the remaining changes should reflect existing errata, together with
some minor adjustments to the design system that David Pulver recommended.

Thanks,

Chris

One suggestion: since GURPS Starports 0,I-V directly correspond to
Trav starports X,E-A, go ahead and use Trav single-letter starport
codes--everyone is familiar with them and it\'ll save you a column
or two.

Yes.

I\'m building a First In site which will (hopefully) include a whole slew of 
world-
building material.  I\'d be happy to give your material a prominent place.

That\'s the thing to find out. Is it a second *printing* or a second *edition*.  A second printing is usually the same as first, sometimes with with errata fixes added. A second edition usually has rewritten sections and adds or drops sections.

I\'m guessing this is really a second printing with just the known errata added.

All this CT talk prompted me to pull out my old black box again last
night.  The books have twenty year old folded sheets of paper with
notes and all kinds of notes scribbled in them on the nice wide
margins.  I\'ve got a binder *somewhere* with systems, maps, ships,
deckplans, NPC\'s and notes for the TU I ran my games in..<sigh>.

Let\'s see, I know I had some notes about the "death roll"...ah, yes!
Here\'s how I handled it...

The player had three options:

(1) the character had been seriously injured and immediately takes
1d6 points spread, at their option, across their physical/mental
attributes, and then continues with character generation.  Example:
Lt Cmdr Joe Generio (777777, rank 3) takes 4 points of injury, and
ends up at (656777, rank 3).

(2) the character had committed a major faux pas, regulation
violation, or been caught in a crime, and takes 1d6 points spread,
at their option, across Soc and their rank, and then continues with
generation.  Example:  Lt Cmdr Joe Generio (777777, rank 3) takes 4
points of faux pas, and ends up as CPO Joe Generio (777776, rank 0).

(3) the character is forced out of his service immediately and
begins play at this point.  It\'s almost the same as failing the
Reenlist roll, except it comes *before* you get a chance at rolls
for Commission, Promotion or Skill that term, and you *don\'t* get a
Mustering Out benefit for that term.  You do have to make an aging
roll, if required, for that term.

Dang!  I *like* that. ;->

That makes sense if you are tying a characteristic to a skill, but
that wasn\'t really done much in CT.  In fact, in CT the
characteristic wasn\'t used very much at all, outside of combat and
injury resolution.  Looking over the books now, I\'m surprised how
few characteristic DM\'s there were, I didn\'t *like* that very much,
and as per the rules, added DM\'s left and right. ;->

They are calling it a second edition, presumably because the rules on trade
and travel and ship construction system are being slightly reworked as
Chris Thrash mentioned to fix some problems that have shown up.  However,
it is basically an errata fix.  My sense is that it is much closer to a
reprinting than to a new edition.  Personally, I\'d call it 1st Edition,
Revised.

Yes but it all takes time that I could be spending on something more creative.

So when we are talking about a new program that could possibly generate player
handouts with negligible effort on my part, I ask for it.

I also find that reading textual descriptions suggests adventure possibilities,
whereas my mind seems to go into a different mode when converting codes to
english.

Do a little bit of B, C and D:
have options for the save as command: An 80 column CT/MT/TNE, an 80 Collumn
GT Specific stuff, and a 120 or 160 column "Combined"; the average
laserprinter can do 2 columns in 7-8 pt at 80 Chars wide in a monospaced PS
or TT font Small, but readable; If all the data is available in separate
80-col output files, it can be printed as two larger pages...

I always did do the \'short term\' thing, even with CT.  If they were using LBB1 or Supplement 4 to make a character, they got out 2 years into the term.  If they were using Mercenary, Merchant Prince, High Guard, or Scouts, they get out at the end of the year they blew the roll in.  If they rolled snake eyes, they also got to roll on my \'major oops\' table.

Don\'t use the resources at cyburban; I haven\'t been updating that
site.  Use http://come.to/FreelanceTraveller instead, or
http://www.downport.com/freelancetraveller/Default.htm. If, for
whatever reason, both of those are inaccessible (Downport\'s
moving as I write this), I _think_ there\'s still a current copy

As far as the TravTech info, I probably need to update that, and
I don\'t have current info. Write to owner-trav-tech@qrc.com; that
should get you a human being with correct info.

MT, sure! But we were talking about CT. ;-J  However, I don\'t think the Int+Edu limit is actually *in* CT...at least, I really don\'t remember it being in my LBB\'s. There was a seven term limit, though, IIRC.

Fe+2 is a potential source of reduced species for the origin

(I have actually published on this... :-) and exposure of
hydrothermal fluids to rocks with Fe+2 in the (at high temperture

It depends on size.  If it large enough you can boil the oceans
and sterilize the planet.  However, I don\'t know of any EMP
wave that would disrupt electronics.

>Or would a good old fashioned solar flare of Biblical proportions be better?

It will disrupt long distance radio traffic (as I remember right,
you can\'t bounce radio waves off of the ionosphere anymore and
so you are restricted to line of sight?).

But how many characters had massive numbers of skills with the original LBBs?  \'Monster\' characters started appearing with Mercenary & High Guard, where, instead of getting 1 skill per term, you could get 1 to 6 skills per *YEAR*.

If its any help, based on modern occurrences, I suspect that a really large
flare would have the potential to disrupt/fry unshielded or insufficiently
shielded communications satellites and even directly impact some unshielded
electronics on the planets surface.     It seems to me that I remember of
such an effect occurring either in Canada or New England a few years back.
Does anyone on the list recall hearing about the effects of such events on
communications in higher latitudes?  I know that I can recall that keeping
track of solar weather and predicting solar flares has been a priority of
late with the powers that be.

    I always used the character death rule in CT. I figured that\'s the rule, 
and it made reenlistment a serious decision for Scouts and Belters.   
Besides, rolling up Traveller characters is a lot of fun and killing them off 
in generation is a good excuse to roll some more. Since I made characters use 
the scores they rolled, first time, the character death rule was one way to 
dump a guy with bad stats.   Well, I switched to short terms with MT and T4, 
but found that it really is just like making a second reelinst roll.   I do 
like the T5 draft rule that makes the roll an "Injury" roll, with a chance to 
negatively affect the character\'s ability scores, and if he is injured too 
much he then must leave the service.

Mora is the capital of the Spinward Marches, right? They must have some sort
of crest. I now have The Sword Worlds and Regina\'s symbols by canon, I made
one for Dist. 268 based on the 3I sunburst, and one for the Five Sisters
consisting of five scattered stars. Any other sub-sector, world, system,
polity crests, logos, etc. are still welcome. Just e-mail them at your

The Imperium breaks down to 7 territories nicely
along Domain lines with Supply Centers at:
Deneb, Vland, Capital, and Antares.

The Vargr and Aslan can break along separate empires/clans.

Forces:
The basis for having a distinction between Fleet and Army
forces, as in the standard game, goes away in Traveller.
However, it could be paralleled with high-jump navies
able to span some of the rifts via J4+ routes.  This would
presume that lower Jump navies are essentially large,
less-mobile forces, unable to span the rifts without being
\'convoyed\'.

Ultimately, I\'m not sure a division of force types in necessary
or warranted, but I lean towards it.  Having a distinction does
make the presence of rifts meaningful.

being in my LBB\'s. There was a seven term limit, though, IIRC.

LBBs?  \'Monster\' characters started appearing with Mercenary & High Guard,
where, instead of getting 1 skill per term, you could get 1 to 6 skills per
*YEAR*.

Right... and that was pretty much how we played, and pretty soon after that,
no one would make up any characters outside of Mercenary, High Guard, or S &
A.  Because you\'d get too old (for the number of skills you\'d get) rolling
up with "Citizens of the Imperium".  Which I thought a bummer.  I had a few
characters (like Countess Julissa) that really probably should never have
been in the military.  Given her Soc, Julissa would prolly have
realistically been in the Navy if she\'d gone in at all, but Julissa didn\'t
have a very Naval temperament, so we had her in the Scouts.  (Black sheep of
a verra distinguished family, she was.  Along with a twin sister she had
that was an NPC, and none too nice...)


Well, it all worked out because they basically paid her not to come home,
until things got bad (I believe this was the Fifth Frontier War that broke
out) and she and her embarrassing friends became heroes...

But it\'s all in the house rules for each campaign.  Things weren\'t easy for
us in that campaign, even with the huge skill numbers; the ref\'s NPC\'s and
such were equally ungodly, and you couldn\'t DO anything in that game unless
you had the skill without a horrendous mod.

Someone on here said they liked the death during generation option.  Not me.
We ignored it until the mustering out tables came into play that you could
use at that point.  That was fun because it\'d give you a bit of history,
like a dishonorable discharge or whatever, that you could use to help make
up your character\'s story if you didn\'t already have one in mind.

I have never heard of a "Goth code", what is that? I am a moderate Goth with
a Neo-Primative bent and a dash of Arcadian. The Trav code is at:

http://downport.com/eaglestone/imtu.html

I believe I am doing the code right, though I have noticed not all folks use
the same format.

Due to extaordinary discussion on the Trav culture list, I am becoming more
pro-Vilani every day.

It\'s something I never even thought of, but I noticed in TNE.  Thing is, it almost makes *sense*.  Thing is, I\'ve never figured out how some things in MT work yet, mostly because I didn\'t bother *playing* them, or gave up on them too soon.  Ship design, for example.  I never did figure out how to design a ship with those rules by the flowchart.  And character combat.  It seemed a lot like Striker with a couple extra steps for damage applications, so I stuck with CT.

Very much like an \'oops\' table, except I let the player choose which option they wanted. That way they could fit the event into their character concept. If they couldn\'t (or didn\'t want to) choose, I\'d roll/choose for them.

>All 3 of the above options are doable, IMNSFBHO.

Yeah, they worked. I pretty much put my CT books away when I started using my own home-brew in the early 80\'s. I bought MT when it first came out, liked the task system idea, hated dividing by 5 all the time, the mistakes and the Rebellion, so I went back to my own system. Then I stopped all together for a while, though I still picked up the occasional TW2K or T2300 book, so I missed some good things from DGP. 

When I got back into rpging TNE was just coming out and I *liked* the system, although me being me, I started tinkering immediately. ;->  I had high hopes for the setting at first too, but I didn\'t care for the direction GDW eventually took it. Setting wise, my AKUS MOBY game is where *I* took it instead.

The Sworld Worlds have always had a fractious history, having had a number 
of governments during their history (and occasionally having no single 
intersteller government).  Losing wars often results in a "reorganization". 
:)  The government that enters the FFW dates back to the 800s.

Was trying to illustrate the change in thought in the changeover to MT.
BTW, I just scanned Supp4 and Book 1, LBB\'s and cannot find the Int+Edu
Limit, nor in Bks 4,5, 6, or 7; _Book 8:Robots_ does contain the limit: For
Robots!.

Hmm... I think I\'ll drop the skill limit for Biologicals... haven\'t checked
the Alien modules... my back won\'t take the crate slinging needed to get to
them...

And yes, I\'ve been playing and running trav since the LBB days... I still
prefer the integration of MT... even tho it is little more than strikerized
CT with the DGP task system.

Couple of questions:  When do you need the characters to come in?  What\'s
the traffic volume like in this game?  How much rules does the player need
to know (GT is my main system.  I\'m familiar with CT, but really don\'t know
MT at all...)?  How much do we need to know about the setting (I don\'t
really know Reaver\'s Deep.  I mostly play in the Spinward Marches...)?

Actually, I\'ve lived here almost 5 years... but the first 3.5 were with an
ex-husband who deplored gaming, anime, my doll collection, science fiction,
and my writing.  I am not sure why I stayed married to the guy as long as I
did...  ::shrug::

I went to DunDraCon this year with Bay Area Animation Society.  If you saw
any anime there, you may have also seen me hanging out.

Nice to meet you!!!

     This chemical relative of oxygen acts like it in many ways,
but unlike it in many others.
     The native element is not particularly common in the cosmos,
but it is found under certain conditions; the earth has huge
deposits in various places. Unlike oxygen, it has a tendency to
form rings and chains. Unfortunately for the speculative
xenobiologist, it does not have the rich branching possibilites
or the stability of carbon chemistry and it is much less common. 
Sulfur may not replace carbon\'s role in life, but it may supplement
it.
     Sulfur forms a volatile compound with hydrogen, H2S,
analogous to water, H2O. In a huge excess of hydrogen as in most
of the universe, this should be its normal form,  On very small
bodies, this is lost with the other volatiles. Much like ammonia,
hydrogen sulfide is not stable in an oxygen atmosphere. Oxygen
claims the hydrogen and leaves free sulfur.
     That is, it does if oxygen is scarce. Sulfur forms two
principal oxides, Sulfur dioxide SO2, and sulfur trioxide SO3.
These are among the heaviest of the gaseous compounds, and may
remain on a planet when the more abundant lighter gases are lost
(such as on Io). It is tricky to make a biosphere out of these;
not so much because they are chemically unsuitable, but because
at the temperatures and pressures where they may remain liquid
solvents, a planet is more likely to keep the more abundant
volatiles, especially water.
     The sulfur oxides dissolve in water to form sulfurous acid,
H2SO3, and sulfuric acid, H2SO4. Sulfur dioxide is more soluble
in water, but in an oxygen atmosphere, sulfurous acid and it
compounds are readily oxidized to sulfuric acid and its
compounds.

I was thinking even more barren than that: something like Luna or
Mercury.  Tatooine has traces of water in the atmosphere and an
open, not a closed, environment. On a world where you have to
process half a ton or more of rock for every liter of water,
going outdoors without a mask and exhaling is a felony even if it
isn\'t suicide.

I don\'t know if canon addresses the subject. I\'m extrapolating the need for
cryogenic coolant for superconductors from the TL7 or so version.
IMTU noble gas recovery would make sense for anything than does
frontier refueling and sports PAWs or meson guns. For other ships
with fuel refining ability, I\'d call it optional equipment: some
do, some don\'t.

From MT Imperial Encyclopedia:

Earliest Sword World settlement: -399
First interstellar government in region - Sacnoth Dominate - formed: -186
Breakup of Sacnoth Dominate: -102
Various squabbling states: -102 to end of First Frontier War (around 700
years!)
Second Dominate formed (centred on Sacnoth): 604 (approx)
Breakup of Second Dominate, formation of Gram Coalition: 698
Breakup of Gram Coalition, formation of Trilateral Alliance: 788
Breakup of Trilateral Alliance: 848
Formation of "present day" Sword Worlds Confederation: 852

The Border Worlds Confederation was formed from Sword Worlds at the end of
the Fifth Frontier War.  While it\'s obviously an Imperial creation, it is
also "yet another Sword Worlds government".

Even more interesting though, is the fact that some Imperial worlds were
originally settled by Sword Worlders.  Documented cases include Margesi and
Garda-Vilis/Tanoose.  Off the top of my head I\'m not certain if it is
stated explicitly that Vilis was too, but that\'s the assumption I make.  (I
think it is stated somewhere.)

Not all "Sword Worlds" are part of the Sword Worlds Confederation.  The
Confederation itself is extremely loose, and it would be worthwhile looking
at creating symbols for each of the major worlds, as these symbols might be
used as prominently as the Confederation ones in most cases, including on
military uniforms and vehicles.

For the Frontier War that occurs during the original Spinward Marches
campaign, yes.

Luckily, Keven, I do.  The procedure uses a D10.  You roll the D10, and
if your roll is less than or equal to the current term number, The War
breaks out.  In T2K ver 2.2, you then got one additional term (as the
war lasted about 4 years), with military characters getting double their
normal skills (due to using their skills under combat conditions).

Were I to use these rules (I figure that the mustering-out rules handle
this well enough), I would handle the War roll like this:  If I\'m
running a campaign set during the War (whichever one fits your milieu),
then the characters (if military) either are invalided out (take an
injury, and get out) or remain in the service for the duration of the
war (this obviously works best for a military campaign).  If the
campaign is set either before or after the war, then just use standard
rules.

    'body' => '9. Sulfides, sulfates, and planetary formation.
     Sulfur combines with metallic elements like oxygen does, but
not as well. Magnesium and silicon, for instance, prefer the
oxide so much that sulfur is excluded. Iron forms a couple of
sulfides, mostly FeS (triolite), but also FeS2, iron pyrite,
"fool\'s gold". The presence of hydrogen complicates this a
little.  Given equal amounts of oxygen and sulfur, the
combination H2O + FeS would be preferred to H2S and FeO. But
amounts are nowhere near equal. The preference is slight enough
that overall, sulfur combines with more than its fair share of
the iron not absorbed by silicates, but oxygen gets most of it.
     Enough of the building blocks have been discussed that it is
time to pause and present a somewhat speculative but chemically
plausible scenario for the formation of rocky planets. The
starting point is mineral grains coated with ices. These collide,
melting the surfaces, and stick together, forming larger and
larger grains and lumps. At a certain size, the heat produced by
collisions begins boiling off some of the ices, concentrating the
minerals. When larger asteroid-sized lumps collide, they boil off
more volatiiles and begin to melt the minerals as well. Under
these conditions, methane and ammonia begin to react with water
to form hydrogen, nitrogen gas, and carbon monoxide.
     Sulfur comes into play because ferrous sulfide does not mix
well with molten silicates and forms a separate phase, like oil
and water. In the meantime, ferrous oxide reacts with the excess
hydrogen and the carbon monoxide to give water, carbon dioxide
and free iron, which then concentrates in the sulfide phase.
Above a certain size and temperature, gravity begins to
concentrate the much denser and lower-melting iron and sulfide in
the center, so that moons and planets develop a thick
ferromagnesian silicate mantle and a smaller iron-iron sulfide
core. The remains of failed and shattered moonlets and asteroids
in the asteroid belt rain meteorites down to the earth that show
this process frozen at various stages.
     Few chemical separations are complete, and small amounts of
ferrous sulfide remain in the mantle and crust. The trapped and
dissolved water assures that some gets converted back to ferrous
oxide and hydrogen sulfide, which gets released to the surface by
volcanoes, along with water, carbon monoxide and dioxide,
nitrogen, sulfur dioxide, and a few other volatiles. It is
thought that such a mixture of volcanic-type gases (probably
richer in hydrogen 4+ billion years ago) formed earth\'s early
atmosphere, and that similar mixtures are typical of the early
stages of planetary formation. Although this seems to be the
general picture, planetary astronomers and geologists seldom
summarize and simplify it like this. They do vigorously debate
the details, relative importance, and timing of the various
events and processes involved.
    For planets with water and carbon dioxide but little free
oxygen, there is no reason organic sulfide chemistry cannot form
a basis for metabolism and life. For many "primitive" and
anaerobic bacteria on earth, it does. There are various hints
that terrestrial life may have begun with sulfur chemistry and
shifted later to an oxygen base. Once such a shift is well
underway, sulfur begins to concentrate in the crust as sulfates
begin to replace sulfur and sulfides.
     Sulfuric acid, already mentioned, is even more effective at
combining with alkaline metallic hydroxides than carbonic acid
is. Only the lesser abundance of sulfur keeps it from dominating
mineral composition. Magnesium forms a sulfate MgSO4, epsomite,
AKA epsom salt. Ferrous sulfates are also known, but the same
conditions that work for sulfates work against the ferrous state
of iron, so they are not really abundant. Ferric sulfates have
the same problems as carbonates, and again the oxides are
preferred.

Personally, I hated the T4 and TNE\'s approach (too much emphasis on the

have enough influence (I think MT\'s stat DMs were +1 if an applicable stat
was 5-9, +2 if A-D and +3 if F?). 

So I\'ve just been using the MT system re-jigged as per below. Those with
average stats have a slightly reduced bonus and those with higher a much
better bonus). If more than was stat is applicable then I\'ve averaged the DM
(rounded up if positive, rounded down if negative eg. 0.5 becomes +1, -0.5
becomes -1).


Stat Value	Task DM
1	-3
2-3	-2
4-5	-1
6-8	-
9-A	+1

I think you can jam the local sensors (except possibly the Mk. 1
Eyeball), especially if you\'re at a higher tech level.  A more elegant
approach is to convince the sensor that it\'s just seeing the same thing
it was seeing before you flew by -- empty space.  This would entail
messing with the communications between the sensor\'s inputs and its
computer outputs.  

You can also knock a hole in their coverage area by sabotaging or
otherwise taking out a sensor that covers some part of the sky.  Of
course, there will some redundancy, so you may have to take out several
sensors or the whole grid to achieve this, and there goes secrecy.

Bribery-3 will get you a lot of advantages, too, of course.

That\'s off the top of my head.  The bottom line is that, under ordinary
circumstances, you can\'t sneak a ship onto a high-tech high-pop world
that does extensive official monitoring without doing something out of
the ordinary.

I haven\'t yet analyzed your sector-by-sector analysis, but I\'m not sure
the survey data is bad.  It could be that the more recently settled
sectors still have their populations primarily on habitable worlds, and
haven\'t yet spread to the worlds that are more difficult to live on. 
This would make sense in the Spinward Marches, where, as you point out,
some 90% of the population lives on less than half the worlds.  What do
we know about settlement patterns that would help us analyze your
sector-by-sector table in this light?

Cool, I like this alot, at least as a start. I\'m thinking that some skills
are more dependent on attributes, some more on skill, some may be balanced.
As a guideline, I would say the more technical a skill is (martial arts,
nuclear physics, computer prog., etc.) , the more it would rely on the
training, Whereas the more instinctual abilities (climbing, swimming,
brawling), would lean towards the attributes. Just thinking.

How about buying surplus?  When the Marines upgrade from TL 15 BD to TL
15.01 BD, it probably transfers some of the older stuff to colonial
forces, but there may be BD units in such bad condition that they are no
longer suitable for military applications.  However, they may still be
perfectly serviceable (or able to be made so for a few KCr) for civilian
applications like yours.  This could give an interesting flavor to your
setting.  Maybe only some percentage of the power suits are actually
ex-Marine BD.  Maybe some are of non-Imperial origin.  Maybe some, of
whatever origin, were scavenged from battlefields after a war.

I\'m not sure that canon sets out an official Zhodani color.  The
Imperium, as we recall, doesn\'t have an official color because some
species can\'t see some colors.  The Zhodani Consulate, as another big
and old empire, has probably had the same experience with other species
as citizens and come to the same conclusion.  

For the Sword Worlds, I always use red, white, and blue, reflecting both
their French and Scandinavian roots (except for a few folks there who
continue to prefer yellow crosses on blue fields).  The particular
patterns in which those colors occur (crosses, stripes, etc.) vary from
world to world (ok, they vary depending on my mood when I\'m painting

Doug is using the colors of the counters in the Fifth Frontier War
game.  I\'m not sure that\'s a good source.  For example, the military
convention for tactical mapping used to be (maybe still is) that your
own forces were drawn in red ink, and the enemy\'s in blue -- which is
the 5FW game from the Imperial player\'s perspective.  

On the other hand, the logos on the counters match canon texts (Imperial
starburst), even if the canon texts post-date the game (the Zhodani
triple-circle thing got picked up in MT).

You\'re right, but I still like the idea of convoys and stuff.  I\'ll have
to think about it.  Your rift/lower jump navies idea might work out
well.

In my Traveller universe, Asgard has many historical and religious sites
held in great reverence by the Sword Worlders, as they date back to
early SW settlement of the region. It is a source of great and ongoing
discomfort that the Imperium owns Asgard -- but on the other hand, at
least Joyeuse and Gram aren\'t going to war over the treatment of
pilgrims to Asgard by whichever of them was occupying it at any given
time.

So I made a house rule for Fifth Frontier War that the Sword Worlds\'
initial advance into the Imperium has to include the liberation of
Asgard, and it has to be jointly and equally occupied by forces from
Joyeuse and Gram, or by Zhodani without any SW forces present.  (As if
the SW didn\'t have enough handicaps in that game.)

I suspect William will say, "None." ;->

Now, *I* have some problems with MT, but I\'ll admit they are mostly
errata based.  See, I bought one of the first boxed sets of MT so I
got the most errata\'ed Traveller there was, and it "turned me right
off."

Otherwise, my problems are I don\'t like having to divide
characteristics by 5 all the time, the difficulty levels aren\'t
intuitive to me, and I think the combat system is overly
complicated.

Say, what are the full characteristic used for in MT anyway?  Well,
other than recording wounds, that is.  

Why not just divide the characteristics by 5 when it is generated
and just use *that*  and be done with it?

It\'s not in *my* copy of CT.  I have the original edition of the

it anyway.

Yeah, same here.  I think Skills should be a little more important
than Attributes, say 60/40, or saying it another way if Skills range
from 0 to 6 (with a very rare 7 or 8) then Characteristics should
range from 0 to 4 (with a very rare 5).

My preferred approach has been to inflate the number of skill levels
you get. IOW, if Attributes range from 2 to 15 then Skills should
range from 3 to 25, and then boost the numbers needed for the Task
Difficulties.  That\'s what KB\'s methods did, too.

Although, the more I tinker, the more I think something close to
MT\'s approach might be easier to implement overall.  I think it
could be implemented with the fewest changes and maintain 
compatibility to the whole body of CT/MT work.

Pretty cold, I\'m afraid.  ;-\\ The stat range is still *too* broad,
given the number of skill levels the CT/MT/TNE/T4/T5 allow.  Shoot,
Michael, that\'s still the same as a *1* to *9* spread!  And it\'s
going to wreak the Task Difficulty levels.

1.  How about something that produces a FUDGE like range, like
(Stat-7)/2, round toward 0.  Almost everyone will be -1 to +1 (range
of 3, with skills ranging from 0 to 6).

2.  OTOH, I think STAT/3, dn at Chargen time and don\'t use *ever*
use the whole STAT would be simpler.  You get the 0 to 4 with a rare
5 that I think fits with 0 to 6+ skills.

I guess STAT/4 might be okay as a compromise, too, but if used, I\'d
change the Task Difficulty levels to 3/6/9/12/15/18/21...I\'d do that
with /5, anyway. <g>

     Method  Method
Stat  One     Two     STAT/4
 2    -2       0        0
 3    -2       1        0
 4    -1       1        1
 5    -1       1        1
 6     0       2        1
 7     0       2        1
 8     0       2        2
 9    +1       3        2
10    +1       3        2
11    +2       3        2
12    +2       4        3
13    +3       4        3
14    +3       4        3
15    +4       5        3

Now, about the Task System...<g>...the thing that bugs me about MT\'s
system is that it starts at 3 and *then* goes by 4\'s.  If the
average value from a Stat is one more than in MT, then the task
levels could start at 4 and go by 4\'s as in...

 4+ Easy
 8+ Routine
12+ Difficult
16+ Formidable
20+ Staggering*
24+ Hopeless*
28+ Impossible!*

*Staggering is what MT called Impossible, Hopeless, really is
hopeless, and Impossible *really* is. <g>

The question may arise, "What about Injuries?"  Well, personally,
I\'m for going to a FUDGE style Wound Track based on STR+END as in...

DR=(STR+END)
           Light    Major                 Near
 Scratch   Wound    Wound  Incapacitated  Death
   DR      DR*2     DR*3       DR*4       DR*5
  O O O    O  O       O          O          O

Example: Str 7(2), End 8(2)
DR=(2+2)=4
           Light    Major                 Near
 Scratch   Wound    Wound  Incapacitated  Death
  1 - 4    5 - 8    9 - 12    13 - 16      17+
  O O O     O O       O          O          O
  
Light Wound:  All Tasks 1 level harder until healed.  Routine task
(END) to remain on your feet.

Major Wound:  All Tasks 2 levels harder until healed.  Formidable
task (END) to remain standing.  Routine task (END) to remain
conscious. May die without treatment.

Incapacitated:  All Tasks 3 levels harder until healed.  Impossible
to remain standing.  Formidable task (END) to remain conscious.
Will die without treatment.

Near Death: Unconscious and near death, or dead (GM option).

It has problems.  The article Bruce mentions (in Challenge 77 actually) 
includes the results of a study of the second survey data that shows that 
certain UPPs (excluding the starport and TL) are repeated too often.  For 
example, of Zarushagar\'s 495 worlds, 76 (15%) have UPPs of n100433-n or 
n100434-n.

 Yes. It was a late CT addition in response to Mercenary and High Guard. Eris 
is one of us OTFs who considered the Traveller Book a "new" edition...

 As for skills being attached to certain characteristics, it\'s a mechanic 
that has been all the rage for quite a while. I\'m a little tired of it in 
most of its published forms, however. MegaT was actually revolutionary in 
that its Task system recognized that a skill will mix with _different_ 
characteristics based on the task at hand. Unfortunately, it was more akin to 
the first Russian Revolution than to the American, as it was supplanted and 
quickly forgotten by the fixed pairing mechanics used by T:2k, Ars Magica, 
Cyberpunk, Star Wars, AD&D, Alternity, ad nauseum...

From memory GT was first printed in Sept 98, there was a second printing
earlier this year; so I guess they are selling fairly well.

which works for me, since my players think they\'re getting

I also use a house rule which says that a character can have
no more total skill levels than his INT+EDU+Terms, and
in no more skills than his INT+Terms.

I allow a related (included) skill to be increased seperately 
from it\'s major skill, and any points of the related skill, proir to 
it\'s own increases, do not count towards the skill points total.

E.G

Karoll has Pilot-3, which gives him Ship\'s Boat-2. He went on 
a Ship\'s Boat training course and became Ship\'s Boat-3.
For purposes of determining skill levels used, his Ship\'s Boat
Skill is only 1 (2 were \'given\' from the Pilot-3 skill)

Works for us!

Well, another "interesting" factoid is that (as I recall) the basic
structure of chlorophyll (the organo-metallic phoryphin(sp) that makes
it all work) is *very* similar to the "heme" backbone of hemoglobin and
the active portions of the other respiratory pigments.

Actually, both inkjet and laser printers can print something in excess
of 255 columns readably IN LANDSCAPE MODE. More if they can handle
legal sized paper (8.5" x 14").

And for folks with wide carriage dot matrix printers, there is fanfold
paper available in "landscape legal" format. I used to have several
boxes of i. They were essentially free from someone who worked at a
bank that\'d switched to laser printers. 

BTW, if you ever stumble across one of those old "workhorse" wide
carriage dot-matrix printers at a swap meet, consider buying it.
Ribbons are generally still available cheaply, and they they are *the*
single best thing ever built for cranking out page after page of
program listings or subsector data tables.

Also, since most nebulae have had recent supernovae in the vicinity,
they are rather "enriched" in short halflife radio-isotopes. Thus, as
the "snowballs" and "dustballs" getr bigger, it gets harder to radiate
the heat generated by radioactive decay. This provides a more or less
*continuous* source of heat for allowing larger bodies to
differentiate. 

Radio-isotope heating is *still* a major source of Earth\'s intenal
heat. Currently the big contributor is K40 (Potassium 40). So in the
"early days" (5 billion years ago) most planetismals must have been
*sizzling*. 

Does anyone have even *ballpark* figures for the likely abundance of
radioisotopes in the early stages of system formation?

   Aluminum, like magnesium and silicon, is chemically far too
reactive to be found as the free metal, and it is always an
energy-intensive process to extract it. This lightweight
industrial metal is used extensively where light weight is an
important design criterion.
   Much like magnesium and silicon, aluminum combines with oxygen
so well that it excludes practically everything else. There are
various forms of the oxide (Al2O3, or alumina). One of them,
corundum, forms a basis for several of the precious gemstones and
is one of the harder minerals (a distant second to diamond on the
usual scale). Aluminum also forms a hydroxide Al(OH)3, which is
poorly soluble in water, and a partial hydroxide AlO(OH). These
are the principal components of bauxite, the preferred ore for
aluminum.
   The pure aluminum silicate Al2SiO5 sillimanite is fairly
uncommon. The vast majority of alluminum in the cosmos is found
substituting for silicon in the huge subclass of silicates called
the aluminosilicates. Other metallic ions, including magnesium
and iron, are usually incorporated into these minerals to make
the ionic charges balance. On the earth, one of the chief
components of soil is clay, which is chiefly impure hydrated
aluminum silicates.
   Aluminum hydroxide may be either alkaline or acid, depending
on conditions, but generally speaking it is difficult to form and
no more soluble than silica. Depending on local conditions,
either silica or alumina may be extracted from rocks and
recrystallized elsewhere.

	I don\'t know how you use skill levels, but I wouldn\'t want
	a player, even with Int = 15, to have a default skill level
	of 5 in everything related to Int.  Being an old LBB fart, I
	have a list of all skills, with required and advantagous
	stats for each (along with the associated bonuses/penalties).
	Just like the combat skills.  I also have a list of 
	"unskilled" penalties which depend on experience.  For 
	example, ex-army have small penalties for weapon use while
	ex-navy have small penalties for most shipboard skill use.

I assume this means *transmission:reception* range, i.e., how far away one
of these little radios can be from another one of these little radios and
still be heard.

I also assume that a broadcast from a more powerful transmitter (say a
1,000 km ranged transmitter) could be picked up and heard by these little
radios at a longer range.

Does this sound correct so far?

Now the important bit (at least for the purposes of my game). If these PCs
with their little radios talk to each other with them, is it possible for a
large receiver (like a listening post or a satellite) to pick up their
transmissions even if it is far outside the little radios\' 10 km listed
range?

It\'s one of those things I thought I understood pretty well but that, on
futher thinking, realized I didn\'t understand at all. If someone could
explain this to me in terms that your average 12-year-old could comprehend,
I would greatly appreciate it. :-)

        Correct again.  "Range" is a function of the *transmitter*, not the
reciever.  So, a 10km range transmitter can be heard by any reciever on the
same freq within 10km.  A 1000km range transmitter is heard by every
reciever on the same freq within 1000km, regardless of the range of the
recievers transmitter.

        A good rule of thumb (barring atmospheric Weird Sh!t) is that a good
electronic warfare operator will localize the transmitter at 3 times its
transmission range.  Once he\'s got it isolated from the background noise, he
can, with a big enough "ear", eavesdrop it.

I don\'t know what the books actually assume but I would guess the following:

A 1 km radio generates a certain amount of radio energy.
As you get further away from it the signal strength decreases
(inverse square law).
At 1 km, this signal is just about detectable with the sort of receiver
that you expect it to be matched to - in this case, probably a 1km receiver.

The problem is - what is the correctly matched receiver?

My guess would be that a 1,000km transmitter needs a 1,000km receiver
to work at 1,000km.

A 1 km receiver should be able to detect a 1,000km transmitter at some
range greater than 1km but less than 1,000km.

Hmmm,

Assume a 1 km transmitter has a signal strength of 1 and can be
received at 1km distance, with a signal strength of "r".

At 1,000km, the signal strength would be r/1,000,000

Assume that the 1,000km transmitter generates a signal of 1,000,
at 1,000 km the signal strength would be r/1,000.
So a 1,000km receiver can pick up a signal of r/1,000.

Sounds good, so far.

A 1,000km transmitter has a signal strength of:

	1,000 r at 1km
	   10 r at 10km
	r/10    at 100km
	r/1,000 at 1,000km

On the scale suggested:

A 10km transmitter transmits with a signal of 10.
A 10km receiver can pick up a signal strength of r/10

So a 1,000km transmitter can be heard by a 10km receiver at 100km.
Similarly, a 10km transmitter can be heard by a 1,000km receiver at 100km.

There\'s a formula there somewhere...

If the transmitter and receiver have ranges "T" and "R"

The range at which they work together is:

	sqrt( T * R )

This being "by inspection" - that famous method of mathematical proof meaning
"the answer looks right but I don\'t know how to formally derive it"

Yes, maybe.

It depends on how much radio noise there is around. For example, my phone
at home has a range of 300m. If you put it on a space probe and pointed a
large
radio telescope at it, you could probably pick it up halfway across the
solar system. If it was in the middle of a large city and there were many
other
such phones on the same frequency, you might have problems at just 1km.

Yes, with your (real world) definition.

In Traveller (eg T4) the 1,000,000km receiver is bigger than the 1,000km one.

I suspect that the difference is that the Traveller sensor ranges are
designed for space, with little interference, whereas real world ranges
are intended to indicate the distance at which two transmitters won\'t
interfere (ie 10km from one 10km transmitter and 20km from another
means that you can hear the first, 5km from one and 10km from the
other and you get noticable interference)

Yes the basic porphyrin structure surrounding the metal complex is
similar in a number of molecules, only some of the side chains vary. The
immediate protein neighborhood is also very similar, although the rest
of the molecule is considerably different.

There are a number of metals that can fit into the porphyrin \'cage\' and
work catalytically. Cu, Co, and Cr have all been used in the laboratory,
and Cu and (IIRC) Co are used by various organisms. Obviously, from the
spread of that same basic struture throughout life on the planet, the
porphyrin/metal complex is very old.

Well, two issues involved in signal reception are signal strength and
antenna length (on both the transmitter and the receiver).  As others on
the list have discussed signal strength, I\'ll talk about antenna length.

A transmitter with a nominal range of 10 km (with its standard antenna)
can improve on this with a more efficient antenna.  Ideally, the length
of an antenna is based on the broadcast frequency.  IIRC, the length of
a quarter-wave antenna (in feet) is 234 divided by the frequency in
megaHertz.  Thus, for the AM broadcast to which I am currently listening
(1150 AM, WJBO in Baton Rouge) we get a quarter-wave antenna length of
234/1.15 = 203.48 feet.  A fixed-site broadcast facility (such as the
WJBO radio station mentioned above) would probably have a half-wave or
full-wave antenna (406.96 feet or 813.92 feet, respectively).  Deviation
from these ratios leads to a less-efficient wave propagation, and thus
less range.  Those of you who have worked with US Army vehicle-mounted
radios will recall that, at the base of the vehicle whip antenna, there
is an antenna matching unit.  This works to adjust the effective length
of the antenna to match the frequency range.

The significance of all this, as it relates to short-range radios
receiving long-range broadcasts (or vice-versa), is that most small
radios have fixed-length antennae, which will neither broadcast nor
receive any given frequency as well as an antenna of ideal length for
the frequency.  OTOH, a receiver with a large antenna of ideal length
can receive a given broadcast at greater range than the nominal range of
the transmitter.  I can only make a WAG at quantifying this, but a
factor of three (suggested in another post) sounds reasonable.  You can
adjust this up or down, depending on the exact nature of the receiver in
question (referee\'s choice).

I know exactly how you feel - their service was superb when I ordered 18

It\'s also cheaper to buy them like this rather than second hand in the UK.

Hyphen\'s Traveller site (the big link page) has a pointer to a mirror for
the software in Australia.

I can\'t remember his URL but I did link it from BITS at

Sounds like you have access to canonical information about the Sword Worlds
that I haven\'t seen. AFAIK the Sword World language has elements from
Scandinavian, German, and Vilani languages, but the French is news to me.
Where did you get that information?

And from Alan Bradley:

_Regency Sourcebook, p. 41 says that Vilis was colonized from Gungnir in 240
and _Spinward Marches Campaign_, p. 19 that Garda-Vilis was settled from
Vilis in 290. The latter, at least, is not the entire truth, since
_Broadsword_, p. 6 states that Garda-Vilis was colonized in -121 under
the name Tanoose (IMTU _Danuuz_ is the name of a sword owned by a legendary
Vilani hero).

Cunnonic while originally settled by Darrians have been part of one Sword
World polity or another from some unspecified time before 300 until 1084.
In other words, it\'s been a Sword World planet for 700+ years and only a
Darrian planet for the last 35...

A good analogy might be a tighter NATO, or a looser Warsaw Pact.  The
various worlds are seperate entities, but show a (mostly) combined face to
the other states in the region.

I found the limit too severe and the implication that a stupid, uneducated
barbarian warrior was unable to learn combat skills of questionable
validity, so I had a house rule that allowed STR+DEX physical skill levels
and INT+EDU mental skill levels. I then divided the skill list into three
categories: physical, practical, and mental. Practical skills were things
like \'mechanic\' and could be charged against either limit according to 
choice.

    'body' => 'Due to the recent discussions about the Imperial Marines and the
Imperial Army, I decided to post my thoughts on the nature of the
Imperial Army.  This could be the basis for a sidebar in the eventual
G:T Ground Forces book.

<<begin paper>>

The Imperial Army in the Third Imperium

The Third Imperium (hereafter "3I") has four basic assets with which to
project its power and influence by force of arms: the Imperial Navy
(hereafter "IN"); the Imperial Marines (hereafter "IM"); the Imperial
Interstellar Scout Service (hereafter "IISS"); and the Imperial Army
(hereafter "IA").  Of these four assets, two (the IM and the IA) are
designed to seize and hold terrain.  Despite this similarity in mission,
there are a number of differences between the IM and the IA; these are
the subject of this paper.

One of the key differences between the IA and the IM is the scale of the
two forces.  While Marine commanders speak of deployable regiments, IA
commanders concern themselves with the deployment of numbered Field
Armies and Corps.  As an example of the difference between the two, at
the beginning of the Fifth Frontier War, there were as many Field Armies
(each of which had 500 times the combat power of a single regiment) as
Marine Regiments in the affected area of the Spinward Marches.  While
some historians refer to all IA units as "local" or "colonial" forces,
this ignores the fact that all Regular Field Armies and Corps are
equipped to a technological standard at or near the Imperial maximum. 
Obviously, local forces, locally armed, could not achieve this level of
equipment.  It is only due to the Imperial nature of these units that
such a level of equipment can be achieved.

However, while the 3I equips and trains the Regular forces, most units
answer to the various subsector Dukes during peacetime.  On average,
each subsector in the Spinward Marches commands one or two Field Armies,
plus one or two independent Corps, all of which are equipped at or near
Imperial maximum techological levels.  In practice, these units are not
distributed evenly, and subsectors with little external threats might
only have one independent Corps, often broken down into its component
divisions.  Of course, during wartime, all Regular units can be employed
at the Sector/Domain commander\'s discretion.  

In addition to the numbered Field Armies and Corps of the subsector
duchies, one can find the sector General Headquarters ("GHQ") forces. 
In the Spinward Marches just prior to the Fifth Frontier War, these
included eight divisions, four independent brigades, and four
independent regiments.  Three of the four independent regiments
available to IA GHQ were jump troop regiments, with forced-entry
capabilities similar to those of IM regiments.  Like the IM, employment
of GHQ forces is an explicit statement of the Emperor\'s intent.  Unlike
the IM, however, not all GHQ units are immediately available for
deployment.  On average, half to two-thirds of GHQ divisions are
employed in long-term pacification or garrison missions.  On the other
hand, the independent brigades and regiments are usually available for
deployment in support of Imperial objectives.  In general, IA GHQ forces
(if available) can be employed in a manner similar to that of IM units. 
Normally, IA GHQ jump units would be preferred over IM units in cases
where IA Corps or numbered Field Armies will relieve the forced-entry
units in direct combat.  However, this preference is not always
practical; if such is the case, then IM units will be employed to secure
initial landing zones for follow-on IA forces.

This brings us to the third difference between IM and IA forces:  the IA
is multi-tiered.  At the top of the chain of command, one finds Sector
GHQ.  This parallels the sector-level commands of the IN, the IM, and
the IISS.  The GHQ forces (mentioned above) answer directly to the IA
GHQ, in much the same way that IM and IN forces answer to their sector
headquarters.  In wartime, the IA GHQ also assumes command of the
subsector-level numbered Field Armies and Corps within the affected
sector/domain (thus enabling GHQ to deploy these forces outside their
home subsector).  The third tier consists of planetary forces available
for off-world deployment.  These fall under Imperial command only in
wartime, and are equipped to local standards.  Also included in this
tier are numbered colonial units, which are generally comprised of
reservists, equipped to local standards.  The fourth tier consists of
planetary ground, wet-navy, and aerospace forces.  These forces exist
primarily to defend their respective home worlds, and do not normally
fall under IA command.

One similarity between IM and IA units is their high "tooth-to-tail"
ratio.  Unlike some armies in Terra\'s 20th century, which sometimes had
at least two support soldiers for each combat soldier, about 90% of the
personnel in Imperial regiments are combat troops.  Most maintenance
above operator-level is performed by civilian contractors.  Contract
workers also provide the majority of administrative and logistical
support for IM and IA units, particularly in garrison.  During off-world
operations, the IN provides most of the logistical support for ground
forces, using a combination of naval auxiliary vessels and civilian
shipping.

Notes:

1.  Most of the information in this paper comes from the GDW game _Fifth
Frontier War_, either directly or by implication.  Troop unit numbers
come directly from FFW, as does the distinction between Regular and
colonial units.  The existence of Sector GHQ is used as a means of
explaining the ability of the FFW player to move units without regard to
home subsector.  Sector GHQ also explains the presence of several small
units (division and below), which can easily be transported by batrons
and crurons as "rapid-deployment" forces.

2.  The multiple tier system is intended to reflect the existence of
deployable colonial forces.  The subsector level of the chain of command
parallels the naval chain of command.

3.  The comments about the high tooth-to-tail ratio in IA and IM units
are derived from the unit order of battle holdings in _Striker II_. 
References to civilian contract workers performing most service support
tasks are influenced by Heinlein\'s _Starship Troopers_, and reflect the
fact that only combat power affects transport requirements in FFW.

4.  My statement that the IN provides logistical support to ground
combat units applies primarily to situations where local contracts are
impractical, due to recent arrival of the ground force, hostility of the
local population, scarcity of local labor or resources, or insufficient
local tech level.  Since the IN controls space, it is logical to
conclude that the IN would have primary responsibility for shipment of
cargoes.  This parallels the experiences of US forces in the Pacific in
World War II.

Not always so - a receiver with a higher sensitivity may be better able
to reject noise or interference, and thus be able to give an acceptable
reception at a greater distance than a less sensitive receiver, given
the same transmitter.

This is an oversimplification.

Note: A 10km range portable radio will tend to be a line-of-sight
transmitter; unless the EW team is within line-of-sight they will not be
able to intercept the transmissions.

The BITS website at http://www.bits.org.uk/ has had some minor, but useful
changes:

- - The non-frames version has been modified to point at the index page.

I\'ve put a clickable link through to the index page (normally accessed by
clicking on the BITS logo on the menus). I\'d appreciate it if any
\'non-frame capable\' people will check and see if it works for me
(dom@cybergoths.u-net.com). It isn\'t as elegant as the frame version, but
it if it works it should be worth it...

- - The menu bar has been rebuilt as a table.

I\'ve just upgraded to Adobe GoLive 4 from PageMill 3, and have tried out
its layout function to try and resolve the ongoing alignment issue with the
menus. Finally, they should be aligned centrally! It may be minor to the
site\'s visitors but it has been bugging me for 6 months!

Note: if you can\'t see all the menus down to the disclaimers, click on the
BITS logo for the index.

with 3 centres. Then you have a basis for the game as a longer term thing -
each major race (bar the Droyne) is represented. If the outcome matched
canon, the Vilani would collapse under pressure and be absorbed by the
Solomani....

I like the Transrift idea - remember the Imperium is squeezed to just over
40 parsecs in width by the rifts Coreward of Diaspora.

The Imperium forms from the rich supply centres between the Vilani and the
Solomani. ;-)

No one has pointed it out yet. The units the original URL pointed at are
aimed at static applications. Most units I\'ve seen designs for intended for
transport use seem to have two contra-rotating wheels. The intent is to
cancel out the two forces...

Anyway, this has kind of died as a thread so I\'ll mention why the
flycylinder arrangement more safe than the flywheel (disk arrangement):
Quite simply, the geometry is inherently safer. A wheel/disk will fail in a
bursting mode (especially in overspeed), but if designed correctly a
cylinder will bend first, allowing a crash management system to be used.
This results in a slower release of energy (LNLL have done some really nice
test work bursting wheels if you\'re interested).

Believe me, the noise of a flywheel grinding to a halt from 40,000+ rpm is
really impressive. I watched a unit in a test slow to rest in a couple of
seconds - around 30Mj in <10 secs. There was a big deep rumble, and a cloud
of smoke as the carbon composite distintegrated and expanded, blowing out
the vacuum seals and vapourising the oil in the back up vacuum pumps. After
the test, the wreckage was surprisingly intact. This was a test unit, so
had some inherent weaknesses (where the instruments went in).

Absolutely - I wasn\'t very impressed with David Pulver\'s previous attempts
ay minor races, and the latest were just lousy.

The big difficulty with the K\'Kree was that a lot of the G\'naak stuff was
published by DGP.... The entire Gateway module would have been ignored
thanks to Mr Sanger.

I\'ve only just started on it but would break it in two - the minors getting
1 to 2 out of 10, the majors getting 7-8.

YMMV

Sounds like you have access to canonical information about the
Sword Worlds 
that I haven\'t seen. AFAIK the Sword World language has elements
from 
Scandinavian, German, and Vilani languages, but the French is
news to me. 
Where did you get that information?

I extrapolated from the name of the world Joyeuse ("happy" in
French).  I\'m not aware of any other canonical support for the
idea of French settlement of the Sword Worlds.

Actually I thought Vilani were culturally rather homogeneous.  Of course

I suppose so.  In most cases.

I don\'t recall much about Vilani family structure, but I\'ve noticed that
divorces and other family restructurings bring out the worst in even the
calmest folks.  You get people who ordinarily wouldn\'t say a harsh word to
an abusive stranger on the street saying the nastiest stuff to people that
they used to love... and I have to wonder, if Vilani have the same biology
we do, would that also be different?

But perhaps they don\'t have the same family structure that we do and these
things don\'t happen, or at least not much.

How heterogeneous are Vilani physical types?  Do they have the same variety
of looks that Solomani do (skin color, eye shape, hair texture?)

I can\'t recall and I\'m getting new books so please forgive me if these are
idiot questions.  In the TU where I used to play there was very little done
with Vilani/Solomani politics and it was assumed that the two mixed freely
and that most of the old Vilani and Solomani cultures were being assimilated
into a broader Imperial culture...

This is VERY impressive.

I speak Japanese, though not fluently.

Kyoto-ben or any other Kansai dialect is much more different from
Tokyo-ben/Standard Japanese than a southern drawl is from American Standard
English (what we used to call Anglic imtu).

It\'s more like Cockney than a southern drawl.  I used to have a boyfriend
from Osaka and he taught me to do it... it knocks the socks off the Japanese
when I do it right.

My honey is from Nagoya and his dialect is extremely challenging...

Don\'t look at *ME*, I just called it the PRB, just like it was in the early 70\'s, last time I was there.  Even socialism costs money.  <grin>

(Feel free to smack me around if I\'m reposting FAQ info.)
The names of the Sword Worlds come from famous real and fantasy swords, as
follows:

Dyrnwyn:    Prydain Cycle (Lloyd Alexander)
Excalibur:  Arthurian Legend
Tyrfing:    Arthurian Legend
Sting:      Lord of the Rings (Tolkien)
Biter:      Lord of the Rings (Tolkien)
Beater:     Lord of the Rings (Tolkien)
Orcrist:    Lord of the Rings (Tolkien)
Narsil:     Lord of the Rings (Tolkien)
Anduril:    Lord of the Rings (Tolkien)
Durendal:   Song of Roland (myth)
Sacnoth:    The Fortress Unvanquishable, Save for Sacnoth, by Lord Dunsany
Hrunting:   Beowulf (myth)
Tizon:      Legend of El Cid (myth)
Colada:     Legend of El Cid (myth)
Joyeuse:    Belonged to Charlemagne
Gram:       Belonged to Siegfried, hero of part one of the Nibelungen-Lied
Mjolnir:    Thor\'s Hammer
Gungnir:    Odin\'s Spear

Iron, Bronze, Steel, and Mithril were the materials heroic swords were made
of, of course.

Couldn\'t find anything on Hofud or Enos, unfortunately.  Can anyone else
fill in the gaps?

Here\'s where I found most of this info...

    'body' => '11. Calcium and sodium.
     Calcium belongs to the same chemical family as magnesium,
but is more reactive. Sodium is the most common of the very
reactive alkali metals. Both of these combine well with oxygen,
and even their oxides are chemically active. Their oxides,
hydroxides, and carbonates are generically known known as soda and
lime. Sodium compounds are more soluble in water, so sodium
concentrates in the oceans. Calcium carbonate is less soluble in
water, and forms the very common mineral calcite in the earth\'s crust.
Calcium, more than magnesium, is responsible for removing carbon dioxide
from the atmosphere. Most of the magnesium extracted by weathering
from the magnesium silicates is found in combination with calcium
as calcium-magnesium carbonate, dolomite. There is also plenty of
calcium sulfate (gypsum). These minerals in some combination make up 
the important sedimetary rock limestone.
     Silicon dioxide forms a glass, but pure silica glass is viscous, high
melting, and hard to work with. With the addition of sodium and
calcium compounds, (usually the carbonates) it becomes much easier 
to work, and ordinary glass is essentially sodium-calcium silicate. 
Another reason these two elements are considered together is that 
they are found together as the natural companions of aluminum in
aluminosilicate rocks, their primary source. These are slowly
weathered by water, more rapidly by acid water, to form the
calcium and sodium hydroxides, carbonates, and sulfates; clay 
minerals; and silica.
    These various silica-rich minerals are less dense than the
than the much more abundant ferromagnesian silicates discussed
earlier. Generally speaking, they have higher melting points as
well and are the first to solidify. The final major component of
rocky planets is a thin mostly aluminosilicate crust.
     About 60% of the earth\'s crust is composed of the feldspars
(chiefly calcium and sodium aluminosilicates) and 12% silica
minerals. The more complex aluminosilicates, ferromagnesian
silicates, and calcium-magnesium carbonates and sulfates account
for most of the rest. On earth, oceanic crust is thin and richer
in the ferrogmagnesian silicates. Continental crust is thicker
and richer in the silica minerals and aluminosilicates.
   The difference in these minerals affects volcanic activity
dramatically. Volcanoes in the thin oceanic crust have
comparatively frequent, gentle eruptions of flowing lava that
forms dark colored, dense, basalt rock, rich in olivine and 
related ferromagnesian silicates. The midoceanic ridges and Hawaiian
islands are typical of this type of volcanic activity. 
   In contrast, volcanoes in the thicker continental crust have
less frequent but more violent eruptions of viscous lava that
flows poorly and cools rapidly to form light colored rocks rich
in feldspar minerals and quartz, a form of silica. The eruption
of Mount St. Helens and more recently Pinatubo are typical of
this type of activity. This kind of magma is less likely to
surface and erupt at all; it may slowly cool and crystallize
beneath the surface to form granite and related rocks.

I was going to mention something along the lines of reactions
involving FeS as a supply of ammonia, a concept that I
encountered in some of my recent browsing, but I decided I didn\'t
know what I was talking about. I\'ll have to take a look at your
publications. Even if photosynthesis is today the dominant method
of reducing CO2 to carbohydrates, it looks far too complex to be the
original method used by life. I\'d as soon believe the Wright brothers
invented the Space shuttle.

			I don\'t know how you use skill levels, but I
wouldn\'t want
			a player, even with Int = 15, to have a default
skill level
			of 5 in everything related to Int.  Being an old LBB
fart, I
			have a list of all skills, with required and
advantagous
			stats for each (along with the associated
bonuses/penalties).
			Just like the combat skills.  I also have a list of 
			"unskilled" penalties which depend on experience.
For 
			example, ex-army have small penalties for weapon use
while
			ex-navy have small penalties for most shipboard
skill use.

Peez


Actually that\'s a damn good point. A default of \'5\' is waaaaaaay too
excessive. However I took the edge off this by making it cost 2 stat points
for each point above 12 (which means I guess 15 is really 18 in total cost,
but still listed as 15 \'cause it\'s just too close to TSR for my liking) and
given that almost every skill (again IMTU) has two applicable stats, in
order to get the +5 both stats would have to be 15 (or one at 15 and the
other at 14 or 15), as the DM is averaged. 

Also, this is substantially reduced if the character is unskilled in that
skill. I totally forget what DMs MT had applied to using a skill when
unskilled, so I applied a DM of -3 if it seemed feasible that a Traveller
might know something about it. For example most people in the US would be
aware of Miranda rights from a steady diet of \'cop\' shows even though most
people would not have Legal-0+. However Grog the caveman would have no
knowledge about driving a car whereas a 12 year old from western modern
culture would probably get the DM as he/she would have a rough idea how it
all works (hell a 12 year old from an Aussie farm can probably A) drive one
and B) most heavy machinery short of tracked; Aussie, Aussie, Aussie, Oi,
Oi, Oi!)

So in short, Johnny Genius with an Int of 15 does not get a DM of +5 unless
Int is the only applicable stat or if he happens to have the skill\'s other
applicable stat at around 14 or 15. And if JG happened to be applying his
mighty brain gift to a skill he didn\'t have a skill level in, then he\'d
still only have the equivalent of level 2 once the DM of -3 is applied. 

However, be that as it may, Derrick & Charles C\'s versions seemed a lot more
feasible and less boat rocky, so I\'ll probably go with one of those.

Hey Peez, if you have a detailed electronic list of your task DMs based on a
Traveller\'s former career, I\'d love to seem \'em.

Thanks for the input peoples.

Unfortunately, a (time-limited) survey of the medical and physiological
literature reveals that no-one has done the research required to do such
a breakdown (predominantly small case studies). There is a huge amount
of inter-individual variation in the time course of illness, and
predictive variables are few (listed in the original post). Ginny
Heinlein represents an interesting \'outlier\' on the far right hand side
of the population distribution.

Pregnancy is a good example of a physiological stressor. Ventilatory
requirements and cardiac output are increased as pregnancy progresses.
One could generalise to any condition where cardiorespiratory function
may not be up to the task of maintaining tissue oxygenation at
altitude/hypobaric pressures.

Yep, this is a BIG problem. How can we produce free oxygen without
invoking massive atmospheric electrical activity or violent geology, in
the absence of life?

Maybe at the lower altitudes there is nothing to burn - it\'s desert. The
\'aerial plankton\' in the dense, super-humid lower altitude air produces
the oxygen, relying on a stream of detritus from the life at higher
elevations for nutrients(?).

A very nasty double barreled taint - toxic amounts of ozone plus high UV
A/B flux.

"Trace" amounts may be all that\'s needed for a world to score a
\'tainted\' rating - low-grade lung toxicity is inconvenient.

Sources of replenishment :- electrical storms? biological activity?

    'body' => '* Taints
Many worlds in Traveller have tainted atmospheres, which contain oxygen
and some other substances that may inconvenience residents and visitors.
The following points may be of interest to world builders.

The following broad categories of taints were included in "First In" and
the "World Builder\'s Handbook" :-

Halogens (chlorine/fluorine)
Sulphur and nitrogen compounds
Hyperoxic and hypoxic atmospheres
Carbon dioxide
Inert gases
Disease/allergens - biological pathogens
Pollutants

The limits to, and effects of, oxygen concentration were discussed in
the previous post.
	Carbon dioxide is an excellent greenhouse gas and more than 0.2 atm
would eventually lead to a Venus style runaway. I will discuss it with
other carbon compounds, halogens and sulphur compounds later. 

Particulate materials are of interest. The following generalisations can
be made :-

\'Diameter\'	Fate
5+ micrometres  95% trapped by nasopharynx
1-5 micrometres sediment in small airways (terminal and
		respiratory bronchioles)
< 0.1 microm    diffuse into alveoli

Only 30% of 0.5 micrometre particles remain in the lung during normal
resting breathing (the rest are exhaled).
	Clearance of retained particles is via two mechanisms : uptake
by tissue macrophages and the \'mucociliary elevator\' - an adult human
produces about 40-50cc of mucus a day from the respiratory tree ;
usually this is swallowed.

Inhalation of particulates can have a range of effects, e.g. :-
- - cough, wheeze, shortness of breath, bronchospasm (asthma) ;
- - pneumonia, pneumonitis, fibrosis (scarring) of the lung from chronic
irritation and inflammation ; some rare cancers.

Particle concentration	Effect
75 microg/m3		Typical rural atmosphere
260			Typical urban atmosphere, TL 6-8
375			Mild hazard in susceptible individuals
625			Moderate hazard in susceptible individuals
875			Moderate hazard in otherwise healthy people
1000			Severe hazard, all persons
[mcg/m3 air at 1 atm and 25C]

* An alternate taint classification might look like this :-

1. Chemical
	Inert gases - simple asphyxiants (reduce oxygen levels ; recall
the effects of hypoxia!) e.g. \'noble gases\', nitrogen
	Irritant gases - cause injury to respiratory tract e.g. ozone
	Chemical asphyxiants - inhibit cellular respiration e.g. carbon
monoxide
2. Particulates
	Non-biological :- volcanic, metal (and metal salt) dusts, asbestos and
other silicates
	Biological :- pollens, spores, virions, decomposing or \'waste\' matter
e.g. bagasse from sugar cane processing, hay
3. Radiation
	high background count : cosmic/gamma/UV
	also falls into particulates category (e.g. post nuclear weapons
detonation)


* The \'Noble\' Gases
So named because of their lack of reactivity, these elements may be
present in large amounts in planetary atmospheres.

Data
Element	mp	bp	MW	crit temp
Helium	-270	-269	4	-268 (helium 4)
Neon	-249	-246	20.2
Argon	-189	-186	40
Krypton	-157	-152	83.8
Xenon	-112	-108	131.3
Radon	-71	-62	222
[melting and boiling points at 1 atm, in degrees celsius]

- - Helium
The second most abundant element in the universe, helium is usually
found in significant amounts only in the atmospheres of subgiant
or gas giant worlds due to its low molecular weight (helium makes up
0.00052% of Earth\'s atmosphere).
	It may be found dissolved in hydrocarbons or similar non-polar
solvents on less massive worlds. The primary supply of helium on Earth
is that dissolved in the gas and oil fields of the American Mid-West.
	Helium\'s main uses are in cryogenics, as a lifting gas for
balloons and airships, and in medicine and diving as a poorly soluble
gas that has better flow characteristics than nitrogen or oxygen,
reducing airway resistance and hence the work of breathing. It is also
used in lung function testing and in circulatory assist devices (the
intra-aortic balloon pump).

- - Neon and Krypton
Neon is the fifth most abundant element in the universe.
Neon and krypton are used primarily to generate red and orange light
respectively in the presence of electrical current (signage and lasers).

- - Argon and Xenon
Argon is 15th in the \'top thirty\'.
Argon is used in diving to prevent oxygen or other gas toxicity with
deep dives ; argon is a general anaesthetic in amounts in excess of 7
atmospheres pressure, and will cause intoxication above 5 atmospheres
pressure.
	Like some of the other elements in this group, argon is used in lamps
and lasers.

Xenon is out of the \'top thirty\' but is included for completeness. Xenon
will cause general anaesthesia in amounts of 0.7 atm or greater (with
intoxication above 0.6 atm), and has been used clinically for the former
purpose.
	Xenon and krypton will form compounds with fluorine under certain
extreme conditions. Xenon hexafluoroplatinate (XePtF6) is an example of
one of the more stable compounds.

- - Radon
Is produced by the decay of radium 226, and contributes in a small way
to background radiation (the estimated average contribution by radon in
the continental US is 2-3 picocuries per litre of air - about one
one-millionth the amount produced by a smoke detector).
	Minerals on Earthlike worlds typically have heavy nuclide contents on
the order of one part in 1-10 million ; high metal content worlds could
have much more.
	So radon levels are determined by the radium content of soils, rocks,
building materials formed from these and ground water. There is
currently some controversy about radon levels and carcinogenesis in th
epidemiology literature.


* Nitrogen
Data : Formula N2, molecular weight 28, melts at -210C, boils at -196C,
critical temperature -147C, \'inert gas\'.

Compounds of nitrogen are relatively difficult to form. Much of the
nitrogen found on Earthlike worlds is in the atmosphere or in the upper
layers of the crust.
	On iceball worlds, nitrogen may become an prominent element of the
local geology e.g. the geysers of Neptune\'s moon, Triton.

Nitrogen has some applications in cryogenics. Compounds of nitrogen are
important as they are incorporated into amino acids and nucleotides,
apart from their myriad industrial applications.

N2 will cause \'nitrogen narcosis\' or \'rapture of the deep\' with levels
in excess of 3-4 atm pressure. The initial symptoms are similar to low
level ethanol intoxication, with the eventual onset of general
anaesthesia with levels of 10 atm or more.

Some compounds that may be present as atmospheric taints include :-

i. Nitrous oxide (N2O)
Data : mp -91C, bp -88C, \'inert gas\'
Produced industrially by heating ammonium nitrate under pressure,
nitrous is relatively reactive, forming higher oxides of nitrogen.
Therefore ongoing synthesis is required, be it by biological or
geological processes.
	Acutely, N2O has a calmative effect at levels of 0.25-0.5 atm, similar
to moderate ethanol intake. Above 0.6 atm, it has good pain relieving
properties. General anaesthesia occurs in 50% of subjects at levels of
1.12 atm.
	Chronic exposure leads to anaemia via inhibition of synthesis of the
amino acid methionine. Inhibition of the activity of vitamin B12 can
cause degeneration of the spinal cord, leading to spasticity and
paralysis which is irreversible without nerve regeneration technology.

ii. Nitric oxide (NO)
Data mp -164C, bp -152C.
Could be grouped in both \'irritant\' and \'chemical asphyxiant\' classes.

This compound is a very reactive species and mediates vasodilatation and
neurotransmission in most Earthly life. Like N2O, some process must
exist to maintain its ambient levels if it is to be a sustained taint.

Primary toxicity is via binding to sulphur and iron atoms, causing
derangements to protein function, especially in the cells of the lung
and heart.
	Oxygen transport is impaired via the oxidation of iron in haemoglobin
(needs to be Fe2+ -> changed to Fe3+, which can\'t bind oxygen).

It is used therapeutically in some refractory cases of pulmonary
hypertension and other lung disorders. The dosage ranges from 0.06 to 80
parts per million inhaled [1 atm pressure, 25C].

Reversible lung injury is likely with sustained exposure (>8 hours) in
excess of 25ppm.

iii. Other oxides of nitrogen
NO2, N2O3, N2O4
All of these compounds are gases or have significant vapour pressures
over -50C. They are all powerful lung irritants, causing inflammation,
and bronchospasm. Death is typically due to ventilatory failure.
	\'Silo-filler\'s disease\' was a syndrome of cough, bronchospasm and
eventual collapse noted in the early days of grain silo use. Stored
grains release some of their nitrogen content as nitrogen oxides.
	There were a number of anaesthetic related deaths and injuries
following the use of a nitrous oxide supply that had been contaminated
with these compounds in a British hospital in the 1960s.

Concentration	Effect
6-10		statutory limits for occupational exposure (8 hours/24)
50-150		airway inflammation - cough, shortness of breath in all
		persons exposed
350		50% of subjects exposed will die*
560-940		lethal dose to 100% of subjects exposed*	
[concentration measured in mg/m3 air at 1 atm and 25 C ; * - estimated!]

iv. Ammonia (NH3)
One of the most common compounds in the universe!
Data mp -78C, bp -33C, critical temperature 127C.
An irritant gas at the appropriate temperature ranges.
[Concentrations below are in parts per million at 1 atm and 25C]

ppm	Effect
25-50	Odor threshold. Occupational exposure limit 50 ppm
100	Eye irritation
500	immediate danger to life/health
1000	caustic effects on respiratory tract
2500	death within 30 mins possible
30000	death within 5 minutes possible 

v. Hydrazine (N2H4)
Data mp 1C, bp 114C.
Hydrazine is a rocket fuel, most commonly used in satellites\' "station
keeping" propulsion systems. It is also used as a cleaning agent and in
the synthesis of rubber and some pharmaceuticals and agricultural
chemicals.
	Hydrazine\'s flash point (the minimum temperature of a liquid or solid
at which it gives off enough vapour to form an ignitable mixture with
air) is 38C (it burns with a violet flame - for the visually oriented
ref).
	It causes marked lung, skin bone marrow and liver toxicity with
exposure, and is also a potent carcinogen in animals and probably in
man.
	The occupational exposure limit to hydrazine is 0.03ppm in air over a 2
hour period, or 0.1ppm via skin contact over an 8 hour period.

Try Food Not Bombs in People\'s Park, they\'re free. The place
kitty-cornered from Noah\'s on Telegraph is fairly cheap, as is the Indian
fast food place on Shattuck near University. And then there\'s a Chinese
place on University between Shattuck and the college, I forget the name,
that serves a lunch twice the size of God, with tea and fortune cookies,
for under five bucks. 
	Of course, a lot of my East Bay g-punx pals would get "free" food
by table-diving the leftovers of people\'s eight-dollar lunches.

ObTrav: Any standard fast-food restaurants in your Traveller universe? My
preferred characters\' dining spot is Arg\'s Groat Burger, a Vargr-owned and
loosely-based franchise (with widely varying menus based on local tastes
and law levels) which I first invented for an illustration for an article
on food in Traveller I did for a fanzine. Arg\'s soon became a running gag,
especially stumbling across empty Arg\'s styrene containers while looking
for some misplaced device in a closet...

published system (MT didn\'t allow for enough differentiation between high

die thing, KBv2.2 involved too many calculations).

Wow...  never thought o\'that.  Our characters were either eating high on the

I like the idea of the menu varying by law level.  Did you ever see some of
the menus in the later Arduin gamebooks?  Gross, but funny.  Of course as
much as I like Vargr I have to remember that low law levels could be
problematic for them... "3-6" is still a common menu item in parts of China
today and some people may not be too particular about whether the "3-6"
walked on 4 legs or 2.

(The word for dog sounds like the word for nine in Cantonese, so "3-6" is a
code word for eating dog... it\'s now illegal, but people go to Kowloon to do
it anyway.  My ex from HK used to occasionally look at the neighborhood
strays rather oddly.)

3-5 = +1
6-8 = +2

12-14 = +4
15-17 = +6 (note: K\'Kree can get this high on Str, and Aslan, Vargr,

Seriously, tho, there are several bits of striker missing from MT,

also included armor volume.

    'topic' => 'Atmospheres #3 : Carbon compounds, allergens, pathogens, &c.(long)',
    'body' => 'The enormous variety of possible carbon compounds offers some
interesting taints for the creative world builder.

* Carbon dioxide (CO2)
Data :- mp -57C (at 5.5 atm), bp -78C (turns from solid to gas at this
temperature at 1 atm pressure), critical temperature 31C. A \'simple
asphyxiant\'.

Given the abundance of carbon and oxygen in the universe, there is going
to be a lot of CO2 around - or opportunities for its formation.

On Earth, the carbon dioxide produced by living things is variously
dissolved in the oceans (it is one of the most water soluble gases),
converted by plants into sugars or locked up in the form of mineral
carbonates. The atmosphere now contains an average of 340ppm CO2, up
from 280ppm in the 1850s.

It is conjectured that atmospheric CO2 levels were much higher early in
the Earth\'s history. The advent of photosynthesis and oxidative
(aerobic) respiration changed all that.

Carbon dioxide is a potent greenhouse gas, trapping solar infrared
radiation within the atmosphere. In one climatological model (exploring
the \'frozen pre-Cambrian Earth\' theory), it was calculated that CO2
levels of 0.15 atm would have been sufficient to melt ice sheets
covering the entire globe.  

So worlds with atmospheres containing large amounts of CO2 will either
be \'pre-\' or \'post-aerobic\' in the main. There may be intriguing worlds
where the high levels of CO2 are enough to act as a powerful stimulus to
plant growth - then the plants produce enough oxygen to incinerate
themselves, and the cycle starts anew.

Other transient sources of CO2 may include warming or agitation of a
body of water [or other solvent] - leading to a violent outgassing e.g.
the lakes in Cameroon where several nearby villages had their
populations asphyxiated.

- - Toxicity
Carbon dioxide is one of the waste products of the oxidation of sugars,
proteins and fats. While the human body lacks oxygen stores, the
solubility of CO2 and its rate of production enables the accumulation of
the equivalent of three litres of gas (1 atm pressure, 25 C) per
kilogram of tissue.
	Carbon dioxide reacts with water to form carbonic acid ; this is mostly
temporarily converted to bicarbonate to limit the adverse effects of
increased acidity on cellular function.
	The only way to eliminate carbon dioxide is to breathe it out.
	So an increase in the blood (tissue) levels of carbon dioxide is a
powerful stimulus to ventilation.
	The minute volume doubles (product of respiratory rate and tidal
volume) for each 0.03 atm increment in the partial pressure of CO2. 	
Breathing gas mixtures high in CO2 \'flattens out\' the tissue to lung
pressure gradient, leading to retention of the gas.
	Eventually the ability of the body to limit the increase in acidity is
lost ; this results initially in a rise in blood pressure and cardiac
output (in a futile attempt to deliver more CO2 to the lung for
elimination). The worsening acidosis depresses heart and brain function,
leading ultimately to unconsciousness and death from cardiovascular
collapse.
	
Initial symptoms include headache, dizziness, shortness of
breath, muscular weakness, drowsiness or agitation, ringing in the ears
and an acid taste in the mouth or a burning sensation in the nose, mouth
and throat.
	Gas mixtures containing more than 0.06 atm of CO2 cannot be breathed
for more than five to ten minutes - collapse ensues from respiratory
muscle fatigue.
	General anaesthesia ensues from the inhalation of 0.15 atm CO2.	
	Death will ensue in a few hours with levels above 0.25 atm.        


* Carbon monoxide (CO)
Data mp -205, bp -190. A potent chemical asphyxiant.

The most obvious source for CO is the incomplete combustion of organic
material e.g. cigarette smoke (1%), automotive exhausts (10% CO by
volume) and \'coal gas\' and house fires (up to 20% CO).

Carbon monoxide may also be produced by the hepatic metabolism of
dichloromethane (methylene chloride, CH2Cl2), or the decomposition of
phosgene (COCl2) in water (e.g. the moist air in one\'s lung).
Physiologically, CO is produced by the degradation of the porphyrin ring
of haemoglobin, mediated by the enzyme haem oxidase.
	Perhaps some lifeforms could produce CO as a defensive or offensive
mechanism.
	Like nitric oxide, carbon monoxide has also been found to be a
neurotransmitter substance. This may explain some of the
neuropsychiatric sequelae seen in some survivors of carbon monoxide
poisoning.

- - Toxicity
CO has great affinity for Fe2+ and binds avidly to haemoglobin (240X
better than O2) rendering it useless for oxygen carriage. Reduction in
the oxygen carrying capacity of blood is profound :-

Inspired concentration	%carboxyhaemoglobin (COHb)
0.01%			14
0.05%			44
0.1%			60

	Firefighters not using face masks and engaged in strenuous activity can
have COHb levels of 75% in less than 1 minute.
	Interestingly, severity of poisoning doesn\'t correlate with the level
of carboxyhaemoglobin. Tissue load is obviously very important, but
cannot be measured in living organisms.
	Mild intoxication is usual with COHb over 20% ; severe symptoms and
signs are usually evident with COHb above 50%
	The heart and brain, being the most metabolically active tissues, are
first to suffer the effects of hypoxia.
	Headache, drowsiness, confusion are early symptoms, with the eventual
onset of coma. Heart muscle commonly infarcts (dies) in the face of
decreased oxygen supply and increased work (reflexes lead initially to
hyperventilation and increased cardiac output in an attempt to get more
oxygen to the tissues!).

The first line treatment is using high concentrations of oxygen to
displace CO off haemoglobin (exploiting the law of Mass Action).

Roughly, the half life of COHb is :-
3-5 hours in air
30-120 minutes with 1.0 atm oxygen
20-30 minutes with hyperbaric oxygen


* Methane and the Hydrocarbons
Data
Substance	mp	bp	crit temp	flash point
Methane (CH4) 	-183C	-162C	-82.25C		-188C
Butane (C4H10)	-138.4C	-0.5C	153.2C		-60 C
Pentane (C5H12)	-130C	36.1C	?		-49 C

	Melting and boiling points increase with increasing chain length.
Compounds less than 5 carbons long are gases at 15 °C ; compounds less
than 16 carbons long are liquids at this temperature.
	Hydrocarbons are common compounds. Significant deposits may be found on
worlds in the outer zone of a star system (e.g. Titan with its tholin
deposits and ethane lakes) or in certain rock formations of Earthlike
worlds.	
	In oxygen based ecospheres, methane is a product of the anaerobic (no
oxygen) decomposition of organic material. It is the main compound found
in natural gas and has a wide range of industrial uses.
	Apart from the fire hazard associated with these compounds, the smaller
hydrocarbons are simple asphyxiants.

Occupational health and safety limits :- 
Compound	Occupational exposure limit	
Methane		1000ppm - 8 hour
Butane		800ppm - 8 hour
Pentane		610ppm for 15 minutes

At levels ranging from 5 to 10X the above limits, general anaesthesia
ensues. The hydrocarbons as a group are irritant to the heart and
readily provoke abnormal rhythmicity. They are also corrosive to lung
and gut tissue.


* Halogenated Hydrocarbons
Substitution of halides (chlorine, fluorine, bromine, iodine) for
hydrogen leads to compounds with varying physical properties but similar
toxicological problems.

Some Methyl Halides
Compound	Formula		mp	bp	Exposure limits
chloromethane	CH3Cl		-97	-24.2	100ppm/8 hours
dichloromethane	CH2Cl2		-95.1	39.8	250ppm/8 hours
chloroform	CHCl3		-63.5	61.2	2ppm/hour
carbon 		CCl4		-23	76.7	2ppm/hour
tetrachloride

bromomethane	CH3Br		-93	3.56	zero

iodomethane	CH3I		-66.5	42.4	2ppm/day (contact)

Exposure limits are those set by U.S. federal regulatory agencies.

Methyl halides are produced by various bacteria and algae in order to
limit competition.

Toxicity is via the production of methyl and halogen radicals which
indiscriminately bind to various intracellular sites.
	Liver, kidney and central nervous system toxicity predominates.
Symptoms include : nausea, vomitting, headache, sensory disturbances,
abdominal pain and eventual anaesthesia, then death.
	Dichloromethane has also been mentioned above due to its transformation
to carbon monoxide.

Chloroform
The odour threshold in man is 400ppm.
Concentrations of 0.47 atm cause general anaesthesia.

Carbon tetrachloride
Odor threshold (lower): 21.4 ppm
Concentrations on the order of 1000 to 1500 ppm are sufficient to
cause symptoms if exposure continues for several hours.

Bromomethane
Fatal poisoning has always resulted from exposure to relatively high
concentrations of methyl bromide vapors (from 8,600 to 60,000ppm). 
Nonfatal poisoning has resulted from exposure to concentrations as
low as 100-500 ppm.

* Alcohols
Data :-		mp	bp
Methanol	-98	65
Ethanol		-114	78
Hexanol		-45	157
Octanol		-15	195

Everyone is familar with the effects of ethanol (C2H5OH) in one way or
another.
	Methanol (CH3OH) is toxic, leading to blindness, liver and kidney
toxicity.
	Alcohols with chain lengths > 6 are potent inhalational anaesthetic
agents, just like the hydrocarbons, and exhibit similar toxicity.

* Cyanides
Data
Hydrogen cyanide (HCN) mp -14, bp 26
Cyanogen (C2N2) mp -27, bp -20

Cyanide salts are used widely in metallurgy and the electronics
industry. They may also be encountered in stone fruits and some other
plants e.g. cassava. 
Chronic low level exposure may lead to a contact dermatitis.
Hydrogen cyanide is readily liberated when acids (and water) react with
cyanide salts.

Occupational exposure limit :-
5 mg(CN)/m3 air/10 minutes

Lethal ingested dose is typically 200mg cyanide for an adult human.

The cyanide ion has a great affinity for Fe3+. The reactive centres of
the cytochrome enzymes that drive aerobic respiration contain Fe3+.
Cyanide prevents cells from utilising oxygen. This leads to accumulation
of lactic acid, as anaerobic catabolic pathways are used in an attempt
to maintain cellular homeostasis. Acidosis leads to the problems
mentioned above in the discussion of carbon dioxide toxicity.
	Cardiovascular and central nervous system collapse ensue within
minutes. Fitting is common initially.

Treatment aims to displace cyanide from the cytochrome iron atoms by
reducing haemoglobin\'s iron (Fe2+ -> Fe3+) to mop up cyanide and to
enhance the activity of the liver rhodanese system which converts
cyanide to the slightly less toxic thiocyanate.  

* Carbon disulphide (CS2)
Data mp -111.5C, bp 46.5C, critical temp 280C, flash point -30C

This substance is a potent pesticide and is used as a solvent and
intermediate for the synthesis of various chemicals. It reacts
explosively with most oxidants.

It is a potent neurotoxin, causing depressed levels of consciousness and
ultimately anaesthesia.
	In chronic low level poisoning, the effect on the nervous system is one
of central and peripheral damage which may be permanent if the damage
has been severe.

Recommended exposure limit to this compound in air:
1 ppm/10 hours ; Ceiling Limit 10 ppm/15 minutes every 10 hours

* Biological materials
This is a big group made up of :-
- - macromolecules - typically borne in water droplets
- - gametes - pollen, spores
- - organisms - viral particles and bacteria, small parasites
- - detritus - decomposing matter
[combinations of the above]

Entry into the aerodigestive tract is a function of size (as per any
particulate material).

Detection of intruders by the immune system may lead to appropriate or
inappropriate responses.

i. Appropriate
- - Identification - antibodies or complement proteins are bound to the
foreign substance
- - Confinement - capillaries become leaky, causing localised oedema which
slows egress from the tissue ; proteins are released into the
circulation to limit the access of the intruder to various resources
e.g. transferrin levels increase, leading to a decreased availability of
iron.
- - Mobilisation - phagocytic cells multiply and move into the area ;
fever is produced which enhances immune cell function.
- - Elimination - the intruder is either eaten or destroyed by the immune
cells. Sometimes this is not achievable and the intruder is confined but
at the cost of ongoing inflammation - e.g. tuberculosis and parasite
infections.

ii. Inappropriate
* Tolerance - the immune system is fooled into ignoring the intruder.
* Immunosuppression e.g. HIV infection
* Anaphylaxis - antibody release leads to inappropriate activation of
signalling cells called mast cells. 
	Mediators released from the mast cells cause blood vessels to dilate
and become \'leaky\' and contraction of the muscle lining the larger
airways in the lung.
	Tissue swelling, bronchoconstriction and marked reduction in blood
pressure ensue which can be fatal within minutes.  
* Allergy - similar mechanism to anaphylaxis but on a much less
threatening scale.

I would say, using modern military comms as a basis, that portable
radios would NOT be line of sight. Battlefield man-pack radios require
that the user be able to operate it without having to change facing...
(keep your eyes towards the enemy!). Radio comms at section- battallion
strength will most definitely be omni directional, with limited frequency
range
to negate the necessity of Antenna Matching Tuning units (TUAAMs IIRC)
It is when these signals get \'patched\' onto a backbone signal network.
or it\'s feeders, (SCRA Centrals in UK Mil speak) that line of sight comms
comes in. Moving people and vehicles just could not have the reflectorised
antenna pointing at the optimum direction constantly. Imagine having an old
portable telly with the loop arial on top. Imagine fiddling with it until
you get a
good picture - brings back memories? Now pick it up, and walk around with
it!
what\'s your picture like now?)

Fixed installations provide LOS, mobile use OmniDirectional.

From an EW point of view, (using MT task as a guide)
                           Omni-D   LOS  Power   DF on Target?
Manpack                 yes      no      low        formidable
Vehicle                    yes      no       med      difficult
SCRA Cent              yes     yes     high       routine
Trunk Comms           No      yes     high       formidable

As you can see, SCRA Centrals have a very limited lifespan on the
battlefield. (Lucky me, being in my ERV at a Trunk node!!!)

Things might change at higher tech levels, but I would personally stick
with the premis made before, even at TL13+ for manpack, maybe not
for vehicle mounted mobile installations.

They\'re still here.  Every year, we get a new influx of teenagers who\'ve
run away from home and seem to assume that it\'s still 1967 and they can
come out to the Haight and someone will feed and clothe them while they
live lives of utter freedom.  ha.  what happens is within a year most of
them are living in the park as drug addicts.  For a very long time couldn\'t
walk down Haight without being aggressively panhandled every five steps.

ObTrav: A world of region has gained a reputation as the place to be for
slackers.  A group of young people have scraped up the fares for the PC\'s
to transport them to this place.  Upon arrival, they find that the party
ended years ago, and demand free transport back home.  If the PCs refuse,
they learn later that one of the kids has a very powerful parent...

Virtually identical to a system I came up with, with one exception - why
the jump from +4 to +6?

I\'ve actually rewritten the rules to stay on the Traveller scale of 1-15~
but give a GURPS-like method of skill handling (that is, each skill has a
unique number - rolling over that number on 2D indicates failure).

I\'ve got a one-page summary of the rules...if anyone wants to see it I\'d be
happy to post.  If you want to check out the whole thing (it\'s still alpha,
of course, be gentle) it at http://home.austin.rr.com/darkbox/one.htm .

I don\'t think he meant that they wouldn\'t be omni-directional.
Just that there is no ionosphere or other atmospheric effects
to help you communicate with someone over the horizon (ie masked
by the curvature of the planet.)

The idea is that 10km on the Moon would require either a satellite
relay or a tall antenae, so a listening station 30km away wouldn\'t
be able to hear you.

Still, they could probably use a satellite in orbit to evesdrop,
which comes back to the question of can a satellite, in orbit 100km
up, listen in on a communication between two 10km radios?

Line of sight in terms of the signal to antenna path being unobstructed,
not having to aim the signal.

Using the venerated AN/PRC-77, we could lose signal by going into a shallow
depression.

	There is certainly a lot to be said for a simple,

	On the other hand, players do not have to check every DM

     I mention this metal chiefly for its industrial uses and to

planetary cores as well. It combines with oxygen rather poorly
and not much better with anything else. It is used in coinage (although,
oddly enough, not in the US 5 cent pieces) and it makes a fine
catalyst for various chemical reactions.
     This association with iron means that it turns up in iron-
bearing silicate rocks, but the resistance to oxidation means
that it tends to stay there. It is far less abundant in the crust
than in extraterrestrial sources. 
     Prospectors in the asteroid belts (belters) are mostly looking for the
relatively scarce iron asteroids, and more for their nickel content than
for their iron.  The industrial demand for nickel may fuel more competition
and spark more conflicts between mining corporations such as Sternmental

Thanks for the addition. Most of the heat up to the point of boiling off
volatiles should be generated by collisions, but for melting minerals, it
might be a little iffy. For larger sized bodies, radioactive heating should
be significant and assist in core formation.  I think I recall the subject

"Giving the Sword Worlders a Fighting Chance!"

I feel that GTL9 is much to broad in G:T.  It is used to encompas 3
traveller tech levels 9-11.
GTL9 seems much to primative to represent the old traveller tech levels of
10 and 11, as can bee seen when making a ship with GT9.  GT9 ships are
abysmaly slow and the power plants are very large and clunky.  to me this
does not give the Classic Traveller feel, especialy for the Sword Worlders
who played a part in the 5th Frontier War.  They had to have better ships
than what GTL9 can give.

Therefore IMTU I have implemented some changes to the TL structure.  I
believe that this was suggested previously.  I wish to give him thanks for
the suggestion.  (Rob Prior, was that you? <G>)

Below is the TL scale I use IMGTU
TTL     GTL           Effect
8            8               Use GTL8
9            Early 9     Use GTL9
10          Mid 9       GTL9 Components with GTL10 Fusion Power
11          Late 9       As Mid 9 above, but add special reactionless
thruster 
12          10             Use GTL10
etc.. as normal

In the special reactionless thruster, what I did was double the weight of
the thrusters used at GTL10 and kept the power requirement the same. this
fits nicely between the thrusters used at TL9 and 10 on the chart in
Vehicles.  I realize that \'inventing\' my own thruster this way will get me
branded as a heritic.  Now I have blasphemed against Traveller and GURPS!
(I wonder what Eris will say to that <WEG>)

I have a big list of modules using this system currently in text.  I will
be posting these to my website, along with some Sword World ships.  If you
can\'t wait for the web posting, email me and I\'ll send you the list.

BTW, this will work very nicely with those of you who have M:0 campaigns
using G:T as well as Sword World campaigns. <G>

get the basic lighting on the model, but you don\'t actually get any cast
shadows where you should.  Obviously this increases render time, but it\'s
worth it in the realism department.

Hm.  I\'d use:
TTL 8-9: use GTL 8.
TTL 9-11: use GTL 9; add TL10 fusion at mid-9, TL10 reactionless at late-9.
TTL 12-14: use GTL 10.  X-lasers available at mid-10.
TTL 15-17: use GTL 11 (early).

\'Advanced\' materials are not available until late in a given TL.

This gives materials and available technology which is closer to what appears in Traveller -- no antimatter and force screens at TTL 14, for example, armor effectiveness is closer to traveller, etc.

Well, Comrade, mine is even OLDER, MORE obsolete revolutionary hardware

I\'ll try it too!

I also have the book software (which I haven\'t played with in ages) so
if the 2.0 and 1.3 versions of the book are compatible files, I can
resize it for a \'classic\' Newton.

Surface wave? Or does this require an atmosphere?

I think you are confusing line-of-sight, which means that you need to be
able to draw an unbroken straight line between the transmitting and
receiving antennae, with directional, which means that the transmitter
does not radiate the signal equally in all directions.

A typical light portable radio with a `10km\' design range will probably
be omnidirectional (most likely with a simple whip antenna) but line-of-
sight (can\'t transmit to someone on the other side of a hill).

Wow, how many sectors worth of data are you thinking of printing?

Hmmm, number of parsec hexes in a 2D galaxy is approx 500 million, and say a
quarter of that contain stars, so 125 million lines at 66 lines per page, say 2
million pages. OK maybe I do need one of them :-0

Don\'t forget that each star in a widely spaced multiple star system can have its
own set of planets - out to one third minimum star separation. This gives you
multiple hab zones to play with, and potentially multiple main worlds. 

This makes for an interesting adventure setting. If there are settlements and/or
resources in the different planetary systems of the different stars in a single
system, then commerce between them is interesting. The systems are in radio
communication range (though with several hours time lag). 

Using jump-1 ships is potentially the fastest way to travel between them - and
gives a viable use for j-1 ships. However, the planets of each star in the
system will tend to lie in the same plane, so jump masking between them may be
severe. Therefore local high G ships may be as likely to work these routes.

There are all sorts of political, military and commercial possibilities of such
a system. It is not quite the same as two systems one parsec apart, travel times
are likely to be similar, but there is direct communication between them. 

It is a bit like having outposts in the outer system of a single star, but with
the possibility of a high pop and resulting high commerce between them.

AFAIK canon makes no mention of commerce in such systems?

Beyond interesting, downright intriguing. Could both systems share the same
farport?

Wouldn\'t the planets of both stars being on the same plane increase the
chance of erratic orbits? Is it possible the orbital planes could be
perpendicular? Would the outer planets orbit both stars?

If any questions I ask are better answered with a diagram, I give all TML\'rs
permission to send me GIF, PICT, or JPEG files to demonstrate their point. I
can see how orbital ballistics could require diagrams. ;)

Besides, the last images sent to me from this list were awesome!

    If you are in Northern Virginia and haven\'t been to the Game Parlour in 
Chantilly VA, go there at once.  They have excellent facilities and products. 
 I believe there is at least one guy who runs a GURPS Traveller game there 
(or did until recently).  They have a good notice board for finding players 
or referees.   (I just had to move out of Viriginia.).  There are several 
places on the Web where you can find places to advertise for players or find 
games in your area,  I\'d suggest the following site to get you started:

        http://roleplaygames.miningco.com/msub4.htm?pid=2759&cob=home

    This is the Mining Company\'s list of Weblinks for "finding a game" and 
can lead to some good leads.

I have updated several sections, and now also have a selection of deck
plans. These are PDF (Acrobat Reader version 4 is required) files drawn at
25mm, so they can be output at the correct size for figures. They also have
1 yard hexes on them for GURPS. I consider these deck plans much better then
the published ones, as several things I saw as flaws have been corrected.
The Safari ship turned out especially nice, IMHO. They were done in Adobe
Illustrator 8.01 if anyone wants the originals.

I have also included a PDF of all the characters I made for Gen Con. There
is a party of 8 100-point crewmembers of a free trader, and 4 alternate
characters in case any female gamers showed up (one did). The character
sheets are a combination of the Classic Traveller TAS form and the GURPS
character sheet. I hope you like it. It was done in Excel 2000 if anyone
wants the original files. The backgrounds are as true to the Spinward
Marches, and the Aramis subsector background as I could make them.

My games went very well at Gen Con. The first one was a bit slow at the end,
as the group did not react very quickly to a time-intensive threat that was
building, so I had to change the story a bit to avoid the entire party
dying. I don\'t think you should kill off the whole party when players pay to
get into your game. The other two went great! Thanks to any of the list who
played, especially the guy with the wrist brace who knew way too much about
Traveller to be healthy, sorry I forgot your name. In general, almost
everyone at the games played or at least read a lot about Traveller. I was
VERY happy with the quality of players there. I hope they liked my games.

There is also a PDF of the Imperial calendar and some other stuff.

Actually, the Vilani _are_ culturally homogeneous, at least in
comparison to present-day Earth - the "diversity" I was referring
to was _ours_, here on Earth - and many of the basic facts of
life on Vland (biochemically difficult if not hostile), their
cultural development probably won\'t resemble _any_ of Earths
divers cultures.  As far as pure-Vilani worlds, there probably
aren\'t any, though most people would think of Vland itself that
way.  Just like on Earth - there aren\'t really any countries that
are "pure" ethnically or culturally any more - but we still think
of some of them as though they are.



I continued:

Again, that would likely be a cultural issue - even courtship and
marriage (or the Vilani social equivalent) is likely to be a long
process involving a lot of consensus-building, because, again,
the cooperative ethic is so heavily ingrained.  It\'s far less
likely that the kinds of social incompatibilities that lead to
divorce in the United States (and there are countries which have
_much_ lower divorce rates) will arise in Vilani culture.

>But perhaps they don\'t have the same family structure that we do and these

... and probably not with the same level of animosity as is
commonly portrayed in U.S. culture.

>How heterogeneous are Vilani physical types?  Do they have the same variety

Not as much variety as we have, but some.  Most people today, if
they saw a Vilani, would probably think of a Polynesian, possibly
with African blood.

These are _not_ idiot questions, and if you can make up _answers_
to questions like these (and I\'ll bet you can!), you definitely
should be working with us on the Traveller Cultural Developement
List (Traveller-Culture).

You\'re BOTH parsing it wrong - it\'s (Free People)\'s Republic of
Berzerkley, not Free (People\'s Republic) of Berzerkley.

Although I understand that they\'re not so flamingly liberal
anymore...  Oh well... Another picturesque cultural image bites

Speaking of not responding, Someone (Eris I believe), posted a query on
Vilani stature as opposed to another race (I can\'t recall who). It came to
my mailbox, and I deleted it thinking it probably got posted here, but I
don\'t see it yet. Sorry, but someone might want to repost that.

And you don\'t vary the Task Difficulty numbers? (ie 3, 7, 11, 15, 19)

Good question.  Didn\'t someone do a TML roster...once upon a time? It might be time to update it.

You must have missed the Great KPFA war...  KPFA, the nation\'s oldest
public-radio station, recently suffered a bewildering series of lock-outs,
on-air protests (including one that ended with the DJ being physically
dragged from the booth while still broadcasting!), sit-ins, and marches
that attracted anybody in Berkeley with an ax to grind along with The Naked
Guy{1}.

Just when we think they\'ve calmed down.. of course, Berkeley is the home of
the Lawrence National Nuclear Labs, where most of our nuclear weapons were
designed!  Thus, the cosmic karma is maintained, dude.

[1] The Naked Guy is an ex-UC Berkeley student who lost several court cases
in which he demanded the right to attend classes nude.  He still wanders
around naked.  They\'ve given up arresting him.  He seems to enjoy it.

In the Mark - Segui system, there is one inhabitable world circling
each star and the two stars orbit a common point with ~450AU
separating them.  Mark is a TL9, spacefaring, world with Jump 1
technology now (Jump 2 is high tech in this area).  Mark had
contacted and planted colonies on the mainworld of Segui even before
they developed Jump 1.

Segui has an indigious Vargr population currently at late TL4.  The
Vargr and humans have been "dealing" with each other for several
generations now and the two societies have been pretty well
integrated.

The relationship between the two is basically one where Segui
provides raw materials and agricultural products to Mark and Mark
supplies higher tech manufactured good to Segui.  In this
*particular* case the relationship is fairly even-handed, due to the
policies of Mark\'s government.

I\'m thinking the PC\'s will work out from this system as a base of
operation.  Of course, *they* may decide to go elsewhere. ;->

Um.. nuclear weapons are designed at Lawrence Livermore National Laboritories, which are (surprise) located in Livermore.  Lawrence Berkeley Lab doesn\'t do nuclear weapons research.

Nah! Twert, me.  However...

...the question was Vilani and Genoee are both supposed to have been
planted on dense atmosphere, 1.3g worlds, yet Vilani are only stocky
while Genoee are much more dwarf-like.

The answer is, "the Ancients dood it!"

IMO, if all the non-Solomani were transplanted 300+ kyears ago then
there should be some Erectus here, Neanderthal there, and who knows
what all all over, out there.  Especially, seeing as the Ancients
liked to tinker...ex, Vargr.

Hee!  Hee!  It\'s perfectly okay with me.  In certain regions,
pirates are an unpleasant fact of life, IMTU.  In other regions, the
practice is *very* unhealthy, and so isn\'t common. 

The debates, and debators, can rage all they want, but MTU, is MTU,
so I basically ignore them when they start up.  The same goes for
Virus, lesbian Aslan, and near-c rocks.  ;->

Planetary systems without gas giants are pretty rare using First In rules. The
stars would have to be relatively close for it to be likely there are no gas
giants (i.e. less than three to four times the "snow line" distance).

There should be a gravity neutral (Lagrange) point at the centre of mass of the
two stars. So you could pop a far port (or two) in there. With two competing
population centres and governments, would they want to share? Also it is likely
to be a very long haul back to either main world. I can see them both setting up
their own starports, perhaps with closer (trojan) far ports for intra system
trade.

I assume they would all form out of the same accretion disk on system/planetary
formation. So I would expect them to all be roughly in the same plane. 

First In already has the concept of "Forbidden zones" so that there are no
planets in gravitationally unstable positions. First In planets can only exist
at up to one third minimum star separation. So you would need two Suns at at
least 3 AU separation to have two potential Earths in the same system and
probably much further.

Stars orbitting each other tend to follow eccentric eliptical orbits. So the
minimum separation and the maximum separation are likely to be quite different.
First In maximum separation averages twice the minimum separation. Though the
variance is large. This sweeps out a huge portion of space where planets cannot
exist.

>Would the outer planets orbit both stars?

Unlikely. There is another "Forbidden zone" out to three times the maximum star
separation, which is likely to be very far indeed. (Someone, Bruce Mac?, posted
that current theories say four to ten times maximum separation). So stars would
need to be very close to share outer planets, and then the situation we started
with wont exist.

This may not be the brightest question that I have ever asked, but what
exactly IS a Lagrange point?  I put one in orbit around Shiratori, a planet
in my novel, and now I\'m wondering if I have to give Shiratori a moon of
about the same size as ours.  I needed it to put a station in.

BTW on the rare occasion when I did run Traveller, I actually set it in the
universe I write in, not the Imperium, for while I love the Imperium, I
wanted to hack some things out in my own universe...

Warning: P***** stuff ahead!!

I\'ve done some basic economic analysis on ethically challenged 
merchants, and IMO they can both survive and make a profit *if* they
can find access to underpatrolled shipping lanes. This is even 
without stealing ships - a lifeboat, even sold at 20% of market value,
is still over MCr2, and then there are vacc suits, cargo, spare parts,
ship\'s safes, etc.

The problem is finding these underpatrolled shipping lanes. Pirate
prey almost needs to consent to be a target, by travelling into
outer systems, unaligned frontier worlds, and other places where
military presences are either absent or spread too thin. Systems
undergoing an economic boom might also be a target - there may
be traffic worth hunting there, but it hasn\'t been there long enough
for the system government to establish a solid defense net.

I think I figured that a pirate could survive on less than six subbie
merchants or shuttlecraft per year, even if none of these ships
provided unexpected big scores (like a shipment of gems or
illegal weapons). The pirate will have to change his hunting grounds
frequently, though - one destroyer escort flotilla can spoil the hunting
over a very large chunk of a star system if the pirate gets too annoying.

Of course, another problem the pirate has is if he\'s stealing six
shuttlecraft per year, he\'s worth the price of that many shuttlecraft
to catch. You can hire quite a few mercenaries/bounty hunters
for that kind of creds.

Nobody said being a pirate was easy...

Yes, if the two stars are *very* close...well under 1 AU.  In cases
like that, you combine the stats of each and put your planets in
orbit around the two star\'s center of mass.

I haven\'t really done any economic analysis, but that\'s my take on
it too.  

It\'s quite possible that a merchant finding himself in a situation
like this might drop a shuttle, or a couple containers of cargo,
while running for a jump point.  The *convention* might be for the
thief to take this tribute and let the ship go.  The conventions of
a TU could be very different from those of 20th century Earth.

I think piracy would be more likely in poor and low tech systems
that are fueling wayponts along routes.  Poor systems wouldn\'t have
the resources to finance adaquate system patrols and low tech systems
wouldn\'t have the technology to do so.

Obviously, if these systems were in a strong Empire there could be
Naval patrols.  Patrols would be rare (or nonexistant) in
underdeveloped areas and outside established polities.

Thus comes the contradiction.  Sure, poor areas can\'t afford system patrol
boats, but why should they have to?  The system is poor.  There\'s nothing
to steal.  Why would honest merchants come to such a place, unless it was
some sort of prearranged meeting (which sounds kind of suspicious)?  Even
under those circumstances, it would be nearly impossible for pirates to
know that there was a fat merchant ship in a backwater system unless they
had some kind of intelligence...

One of the other problems of pirate ops - due to the lack of any 
interstellar communications faster than ships, it\'s hard to get 
intelligence to a pirate in time for him to do anything about it.

Of course, other people have these communication lag problems
as well. If the captain of the _Argos Ascendant_ has to arrange 
a rendezvous with the captain of the _Mighty Joe_ to transfer 
a highly valuable smuggled cargo, the message has to get from
one to the other. If an agent with pirate contacts overhears the 
message, he may have time to get a corsair hidden there 
beforehand.

As for poor or low-tech worlds having little to steal, I agree (to a point).
Thus being a pirate is more challenging than simply jumping to any
world with a certain UPP and lying in wait, which is as it should be - 
_Citizens of the Imperium_ gives some pretty tough numbers for
Pirate success & survival, if I recall correctly.

My view of the formation of rocky (terrestrial) planets is that it occurs
too close to the star for ices to still exist, so the grains are (mostly)
solid minerals. This is usually cited as the distinction between
rocky-planet formation and gas giants, which form out in the edge
where enough ice is available for accretion to happen rapidly.

IMTU you have to pass through systems, you can\'t jump to empty
hexes.  So, if ships from System A wants to trade with System E
several parsecs away, they may have to pass through Systems B, C and
D to get there.  If these systems are poor, then the ships may only
stop in order to refuel, not to trade.  They might refuel at lonely
gas giants or backwater clearings.  Of course, having some kind of
intelligence would be, more or less, required to know where and when
to lie in wait.  ;->

Sorry for taking the private, but "Mistress Tiamat."  Just curious, is this
in an AD&D game or a r/l title you use amongst close friends??

Well live and learn!  This list is truly educational :^)

I must admit, the majority of Goth-gamers (I\'m not a Goth, but Goth
friendly... with many such friends) I know are into AD&D or the various
White Wolf products in majority, not heard of any into sci-fi other than a
few who play cyber-punk like games??

Don\'t I feel a bit of a goose.  Heheheheh.

This was off topic so I wanted to send it private.  I am truly curious to
the "Mistress" part as I know a handful of Goths locally that play fantasy
games and use titles such as "Mistress" and "Master" in r/l and I was
seeking to find how common this is (it would have been my next question
depending on the answer -- I also know non-gamers that use these titles to).

So now it\'s public, can anyone else answer this question also?

  {
    'body' => '11. Conclusion.
     At the beginning, I also promised a summary of how small
differences in solar system composition could produce radical
differences in the character of planets.  Even though prediction is
risky and I could well be overlooking some important effect, here are 
some possibilities.
     In Sol system, abundances of magnesium, iron, and silicon in
particular are so nearly balanced that differences of only a few
percent can make a significant difference in the size and
composition of the core, mantle, and crust of planets.
     Larger size, thick crusts, thick mantle, and less volcanic
activity all mean slower cooling, so volcanic activity should
last longer. Smaller size, thin crusts, thin mantle, and more
volcanic activity mean faster cooling. Smaller cores may mean 
weaker planetary magnetic fields.
   In magnesium rich system, magnesium should tend to displace
iron from the ferromagnesian silicates, and may produce larger
cores and more free iron in the system. In magnesium poor
systems, mantle composition will shift to include more iron, at
the expense of the cores, and may also mean more free silica, which would
concentrate in the crust.  Iron rich systems may put excess iron
in the cores rather than than displace magnesium; iron poor systems
ought take it from the cores first. These differences will prabably show up
in the asteroid belt as well. Silicon rich systems should have thicker
mantles and crusts. Silicate and aluminosilicate crusts are good
insulators, so perhaps less volcanic activity, more violent when it does
occur. Volcanic activity might be concentrated in hot spots or cracks,
with less mobility of tectonic plates. Silicon poor systems
should force more iron to the core, with a thinner mantle and
crust. These would have more but gentler tectonic activty, with
more and more mobile tectonic plates.
     High sulfur means probably more of it remaining in the crust
and mantle. Life should still be possible, but the planet may be
inhospitable to humans. Low sulfur may mean life has a harder
time getting started.  Aluminum-rich systems ought to have thicker
crusts; there isn\'t enough of it to affect the mantle much.
Aluminum-poor systems can be expected to have thin crusts, much
like those that are silicon-poor, and will probably see more
natural calcium and sodium silicates.
     Differences in calcium and sodium will have their most
visible effects in the composition of the sedimentary class of
rocks, and in the composition and salt balance of oceans.
Terrestrial life is highly sensitive to the balance of salts in
body fluids, which in most cases is rather similar to that in
terrestrial seawater. On a world with different mineral
proportions, terran transplants (including humans) could fare
very poorly except in limited areas. 

   These top fifteen elements pretty much control the composition and 
character of planets in this neigborhood of the galaxy; the 
remainder add variety and detail. There may be other regions 
that are richer in the heavier metallic elements; certainly some
are poorer in the rock formers. But this is as far as I had 
planned to go in this series, and I will save discussion of other 
elements for perhaps a later time.

It\'s also generated by geological processes. The less oxygen and
more hydrogen in the environment, the less CO2 and more CO you
find. It appears in volcanic gases and may be quite a bit more
common on geologically young worlds.

The halogens are not abundant enough to form much of these in
nature. Unlike several of these compounds, the halogenated
hydrocarbons are thermodynamically stable, at least in the
absence of oxygen. It may be that their salts with alkali metals
are more stable, but anything bacteria can make, higher life
forms can concievably make as well.

>Cyanide

     Two more that have to be continually generated by some
industrial, biological, or geological process. Of these, cyanide
looks like the better bet, and again, in nature it will appear
mostly on worlds without much free oxygen.

Hmmm. This figure presents some problems for the early earth,
Some studies suggest a CO2 pressure of 10 atm for the time when
the first large-scale deposits of carbonate minerals started
appearing, and there would have already been liquid water. Water
vapor is a greenhouse gas as well, so their combined effect
couldn\'t keep average earth temperatures above....whatever
water\'s boiling point is at whatever pressure the atmosphere was.
Maybe the sun was cooler back then?

Also concentrated in giant and subgiants planets. This monatomic
gas has a higher atomic weight but lower molecular weight than
the diatomic nitrogen and oxygen. For earth-size and smaller or
hotter planets, it tends to leak away. Argon is the most abundant
of the noble gases in earth\'s atmosphere, the heavier krypton
next, and neon third IIRC.

Or industrial ones. This last is true of all the nitrogen oxides;
otherwise earth\'s nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere would not be stable.
The nitrogen oxides dissolve well in water and may there be
trapped as nitrate minerals (salts of nitric acid HNO3) or in
organisms. Industrial pollution by NOx gets cleaned up by natural
processes, if ever infernal combustion engines and the like stop
generating them.

>iv. Ammonia (NH3)

Not where there\'s free oxygen around <G>. This is also found more
in gas giants and subgiants, since it tends to get oxidized to N2
and H2O in the planetary formation process. For worlds larger and
cooler than earth, significant amounts may remain dissolved in
water.

>v. Hydrazine (N2H4)

Hydrazine is another of those substances like ozone, hyrdogen
peroxide, and the nitrogen oxides that will have to be
continually generated by some process to remain in an atmosphere
in significant quantity.

Yes.  IIRC the young Sun is believed to have been about 30% less
luminous than it is now.  Main sequence stars tend to brighten slowly
with time.  (That effect isn\'t accounted for in any system-generation
ruleset I know of, including First In -- the implications would tend to
make Earthlike worlds even *more* rare. . .)

 Very nice, though you missed the big one:  The Safari Ship and both Traders
are the same displacement (200 tons).  Look at the real estate covered by
all three sets of deckplans and try to convince yourself that these are all
the same volume...

>The Safari ship turned out especially nice, IMHO.

 I agree. The Safari ship has always appealed to me, and yours is a very
nice rendition.

Oh, I agree on the trojan ports, I see trojan points as an early site for
development. My thought was not that the Lagrange Highport would be in
competition between the two systems for other trade, but that it might be
built to facilitate trade between the two systems.

If the systems had formed seperately and "caught" each-other, could the

Ah!  Virus!  Of course!  (Been a while since I\'ve played T:NE.)

I once wrote an adventure whereby Virus found a way to transmit itself
using long chemical compound chains that it would release into the air.
When a non-infected ship\'s sensors scanned the airborne molecules and tried
to analyze them, there was a chance the Virus sequence would infect the
computer...

Needless to say, all my players decided to switch to AD&D instead :)

No offense, but that\'s just a *bit* of a stretch for me.  Especially since 
long-chain molecules would tend to sink in air and hit the ground eventually. 
 The sheer *length* needed of the chain involved would make them almost 
visible to the naked eye  Remember, Virus is pretty big.  In small machines, 
it rarely developes, but stays in \'egg\' form.

Well, I suspect that many Goths are also into B&D and that might account for
it. Myself, well I used a title before I began gaming, and I am not exactly
Goth either, although many take me to be so. I have some strong similarities
I guess. I\'m only into (mild) B, and no D. Neither S nor M. But then my
title is neither Master nor Mistress. Just in case anyone really gives a
rip, here it is:

Benyamene\' Ze\'Abe Akella
Son of the Right Hand
Ravenous Wolf
Patriarch of Clan Hendricks
Warder of the Sacred Herb
High Epopt of the Brotherhood for the Abolition of Temporal/Spatial Reality
and the Unification of the Shekinah

I think that covers it.

    Not really, back in the old days a city in a bad area (i.e. a desert)
could become rich & powerful, if it was on a trade route, but in Traveller,
there can be a poor system between two rich systems & if it has a gas giant,
it could become a refueling spot for merchant shipping.  Remember, Free
Traders are Jump-1.  And, if say an Agricultural World was Jump-2 from an
Industrial World & a Poor World was between them, a Free Trader could go
from the Ag World to the Pr World to the In World, stopping only at the Poor
World to refuel.  And, as the 3I would patrol the Ag & In Worlds, but not
the Pr World, as the Ag & In worlds provide taxes.  And, until the Merchants
bitch about the pirates, the IN will not partol the Pr world.
    Just my take on it.

    If Pirate A, who has Jump-3, knows that Free Trader A, who has Jump-1,
is going to be going to System E from System A & is planing to go via,
Systems B,C, & D, he might wait at System C to ambush Free Trader A, as he
would be there a week ahead of Free Trader A, he will have the drop on him.
If it is a Far Trader, then System D.  But, it is workable, in certain
areas, but not all.

Yes indeed, this is the way I see it working in many cases. And don\'t forget
that historically many pirates or privateers were actually subsidized by
governments to prey on the ships of other countries.

    Thank you.  Or at the very least, no looked at too closely by that
nations customs service.  I.e. given a place where they could sell their
booty at full market value.

I was recently in Xishuangbanna, way in southern China, and saw a
skinned, beheaded dog hanging in a noodle shop, alongside the ducks and
chickens, ready to have strips carved off and put into your noodle
dish.  There seemed no question of legality.

Another Traveller player in Berkeley?  Let\'s take this Berkeley thing to

Keven, while I agree with you that this is a _highly_ implausible means
of Virus propagation (even in comparison with all the canonical
highly-implausible means of propagation), I must salute a referee who
could sell this method to the group\'s players.

The mainland and HK have different laws, even since the takeover.  The Brits
were no way no how going to permit the Chinese to eat dogs.  Especially not
considering that some of the more racist Brits maintained it was
cannibalism.

Luna, Mars, Titan, Highports at the various trojan points, oribital research
stations around Pluto, etc. The type of star(s) would give some indication
as to what one would find, and major features could be displayed like the
bases and ports and GGs were, around the central steller position as if in
orbit. Perhaps binary and trinary systems could display the smaller stars on
top of the larger. The only problem would be if a system had two identical
size stars. Just thinking. Any opinions?

I can see it now, a 10,000 dT transport ship comes out of jump at the
oort cloud of a star system. The cargo bay doors open and thousands of 
spheres with tentacles begin dropping out and scatter in all directions.
Each sphere finds a rock and attaches itself with its tentacles. Once
attached, the rocks begin moving toward the inner system.

As a native St. Louisan, I always figured that White Castle would
eventually become an interstellar franchise.  Gotta _love_ those Whitey
One-Bites!  (Except for those maladjusted beings who _hate_ "sliders"
with an equal passion....)

For those of you from the Deep South, imagine Krystalburgers, but with
dill pickles in lieu of mustard.  (%#&*!^@ barbarians down here....)

The CO2 pressure for a runaway greenhouse depends on how
much energy the planet recieves from the star.  Its hard to
keep liquid water on Mars, let along a runaway greenhouse,
in the early solar system at any reasonable CO2 pressure.

However, the 10 atm estimate for the early Earth is only
one, and not the currently most favored one.  Other estimates
range as low as a few percent.  The most common number I\'ve
seen is 0.2 atm.

>Maybe the sun was cooler back then?

It was.  25% cooler.

I missed The Naked Guy (tm) when I went by during the protests.  (That\'s
not a complaint.)

Actually, the naked people (there are more than just TNG) did pretty
well in court.  The city usually couldn\'t get a conviction out of a
Berkeley jury.  Eventually the city downgraded the offense from
misdemeanor to infraction, so the cops could just write a ticket, and
there was no jury trial right.  I don\'t know if that\'s led to any
convictions, but I don\'t seek the naked people anymore.

There\'s surely an Ob Traveller in there somewhere.

That didn\'t stop the pirates of the 16th-18th centuries.  They would
figure out where a merchant ship should be going at a certain time of
year and attack it.  Can that be translated to space?  Or maybe I should
not add anymore gasoline to this frequently-restarted fire.

    'body' => '* Sulphur
Sulphur compounds mainly appear in atmospheres from volcanism and
industrial activity. On some unusual worlds they may be substitutes for
water or otherwise figure prominently in local geology e.g. Io.

Data
Compound	mp	bp
SO2		-73	-10
SO3		17/30	45	mp for alpha and beta form given
H2S		-83	-62
SO2F2		-120	-52
SOF2		-110	-30
SF6		-51*	-63

* - sublimes ; estimated melting point is at an ambient pressure of 10
atm.

- - Sulphur oxides 
These are strong irritant gases, forming sulphurous and sulphuric acid
on combination with water.

SO2 levels	Effect
mcg/m3
80
365		Typical urban atmosphere
800		Mild hazard in susceptible persons
1600		Moderate hazard in susceptible persons
2100		Moderate hazard, everyone
2620		Severe hazard, everyone

- - H2S
Hydrogen sulphide is a chemical asphyxiant, binding avidly to
respiratory cytochromes. It is more potent than cyanide.

ppm	Effect
0.002	Odour threshold : \'rotten-egg smell\'
10-15	occupational exposure limit
100-150	nose/eye irritation
250-500	sore throat, cough, chest tightness, pulmonary oedema
500-1000 headache, confusion, cyanosis, convulsions
>1000	death

Treatment of poisoning is currently unsatisfactory. Antidotes for
cyanide are ineffective.

The fluorine compounds of sulphur are simple asphyxiants. SF6, sulphur
hexafluoride, is very poorly soluble in water and has been used in
respiratory physiology research. The occupational limit for SF6
exposure is 1000ppm.

* Phosphorus
Data
PF3	-160	-95
PF5	-92	-85
PH3	-133	-88

Phosphine (PH3) is used as a fumigant and pesticide and as a dopant in
the semiconductor industry.
	The adult lethal dose by ingestion is 1.5g (PH3 in salt form).
	Occupational exposure level 0.3ppm
	Maximum concentration tolerated 100-190ppm for one hour.
	Levels above 2000ppm are lethal within 5-10 minutes.
Toxicity acutely is to the liver and heart. Chronic low level exposure
leads to liver disease (yellow degeneration of the liver) and gradual
breakdown of the lower jaw bone (\'phossy jaw\').

The fluorophosphates are simple asphyxiants.

* Halogens
i. Chlorine (Cl2)
MW 70.9, mp -101C, bp -35C, critical temperature 144C

This green-yellow gas is as reactive as oxygen and could be an important
part of an alternate biochemistry. It is unlikely to be found in
significant amounts in an atmosphere without biological regeneration.

Industrially, it is a very important chemical, being used in the
synthesis of a wide variety of substances. Hypochlorite (HClO-)
solutions are commonly used as bleaches.

Chlorine is a powerful irritant gas.
Initially irritation of the eyes, nose and throat are the dominant
symptoms. With further exposure, nausea and vomitting ensue, with the
eventual onset of permanent eye damage, pulmonary oedema, laryngeal
spasm and respiratory arrest. 

Statutory exposure limits :-
Occupational : 1 ppm
Ceiling : 3mg/m3 air

- - Hydrogen chloride (HCl)
Data : mp -114C, bp -85C, critical temperature 51.4C

Dissolved in water, this is hydrochloric acid. It is therefore a strong
irritant to eyes and mucous membranes.

Occupational limits to exposure : 5 ppm
Ceiling limit : 100ppm

ii. Fluorine (F2)
Data
Compound	mp	bp	Occupational exposure limit
F2		-220	-188	1 ppm
HF		-83	-19	3 ppm
OF2		-224	-145	0.05 ppm

Fluorine is extremely reactive, and will not be encountered in its
elemental state in nature under most conditions.
	HF is hydrofluoric acid or hydrogen fluoride ; OF2 is oxygen difluoride
or fluorine oxide. HF is much more stable than OF2 (the latter is almost
as reactive as F2).
	From the exposure standpoint, fluorine and its compounds are very
similar to chlorine.
	Fluoride salts are potent poisons to Earthly life ; the lethal dose of
sodium fluoride (NaF) in man is 5-10mg/kg.

* Miscellaneous
These two compounds might be present as unusual taints :-
Compound	mp	bp
Arsine	(AsH3)	-116	-57
Diborane (B2H6)	-165.5	-92.5

Arsine is used in the semiconductor industry as a dopant. Like most
arsenic compounds, it is highly toxic.
	Levels of 25-50ppm will be fatal within 30 minutes, 250 ppm within a
minute.
	Occupational levels for all arsenic compounds are about 0.01mg/m3 air
(just under 0.01ppm).

Diborane is used in the manufacture of semiconductors and organoboron
compounds. It is *very* reactive and will combine explosively with most
oxidising agents (diborane is a good rocket fuel).

Low level lung toxicity will ensue at the occupational ceiling levels of
0.1ppm, similar to that seen with ozone.

Arsine and diborane exposures have similar clinical effects to the
halogens and their compounds ; they are potent irritant gases.

Compounds of selenium, germanium and antimony behave like arsenic (as
one might expect from the Periodic Table).

* Metal Fume Fever
A name applied to a syndrome produced by the inhalation of metals or
metal salts. Dusts of zinc, copper, magnesium, cadmium, nickel,
aluminium, chromium, manganese, beryllium, silver and vanadium can lead
to the following symptoms :-
	fever, chills, drooling, headache, cough, shortness of breath.
	This can progress to an overwhelming acute lung inflammation, which is
rapidly fatal, especially in the cases of beryllium, cadmium and nickel.
	Low level, long term exposure can lead to a variety of other pathology
:-
	beryllium - chronic lung inflammation
	manganese - a syndrome like Parkinson\'s disease
	chromium - recurrent ulceration of the skin and mucous membranes, which
often gets infected.
	cadmium - kidney and liver failure
	silver - argyrism (a slate-grey discolouration of the skin)
	aluminium - degeneration of the central nervous system
	copper - deposition of copper salts in the eyes and liver with eventual
liver failure.

Dose levels are roughly similar to those described generally for
particulates.
	The mainstay of treatment (apart from prevention) is administration of
chelating agents and usual supportive care (remember Airway, Breathing,
Circulation). 

* Closing Remarks and Exotic, Corrosive and Insidious Atmospheres
Many of the compounds described in this series of posts represent
distinct fire hazards in the presence of oxygen, or in their own right
(strong oxidisers like chlorine, fluorine and fluorine oxide) :-

H2S, AsH3, B2H6, N2O, N2H4, CO, and the hydrocarbons and alcohols.

However, it\'s certainly possible that they could be present in \'tainted\'
atmospheres, given the potency of some of the compounds.

Let\'s look at three more unusual atmosphere types :-
i. Exotic - defined as a gas mix where \'an oxygen supply is required but
no protective suit is necessary\'.
	So the basic requirements are a hypoxic gas mix (less than 0.01 atm
oxygen) and a temperature and pressure range where sealed clothing isn\'t
needed. There is no need for a separate \'low oxygen\' taint : all such
worlds have \'exotic\' atmospheres by definition.
	Irritant or chemical asphyxiant gases can only be present at very low
levels.	

ii. Corrosive - temperature or gas mix necessitates protective clothing.
	This category combines temperature extremes with high levels of
irritant or chemical asphyxiant gases.  

iii. Insidious - extreme conditions will defeat portable protective
measures within 2-12 hours. As per (ii), but worse. Hydrogen is offered
as the prototypical insidious atmosphere gas via its diffusion
properties and subsequent explosion/fire risk. Other substances that
react readily with oxygen are good candidates as well.

* Summary
Inert : N2, noble gases, N2O, CO2, hydrocarbons, alcohols
Irritant : O3, NO and higher oxides, NH3, N2H4, Cl2, HCl, HF, F2, F2O,
CS2, SO2, B2H6
Chemical asphyxiant : NO, CO, cyanides, H2S
Other toxic effects : radon, N2O, CO2, CS2, PH3, AsH3

My Cr 0.02 :-
1. The higher atmospheric pressure on Shiwonee (Vland\'s surface
atmospheric pressure is ~1.0) :- work of breathing is harder, so more
muscle mass is required to move air in and out - the Geonee will be
\'stockier\'.
1a. The higher pressure in itself could lead to a decrease in stature
(it\'s a more extreme environment compared to human normal, which will
lead to decreased vertical growth velocity - inferring from
anthropometric studies done on mountain dwellers).
2. The same process that leads to Great Danes and Dachshunds existing on
the same planet : selective breeding.

Well, in the US Civil Air Patrol, I\'ve encountered this problem. The VHF
aircraft radios (nominal range ~1000km w/los) can pick up the VHF handhelds
(nominal range 10km) if there is LOS within about 100km... From a glider
(using a handheld), we could only hit another handheld from about 10km, but
aircraft could pick us up about 100km, and we could pick them up about the
same.

Simple rule of thumb taught to us was "For each two orders of magnitude
difference in nominal comm range, increase the effective range by one
magnitude"... It isn\'t *quite* right, but VHF Aircraft radios in the
115-140 frequencies (MHz, IIRC) are Line of Sight.

What we did to keep in tough with ground teams some 200-400km distant was
put a plane up (Highbird), and have highbird relay... on one excercise,
with LOS, at 20 km, we couldn\'t hit each other, but highbird could read us
both and peg both of our handhelds, and would relay. We could physically
see the other ground team (using powerful bioncs... spotted the van..) but
had to have relay.

IMTU, I\'m a little more strict...
I use watts/(maxRng^2) as the min signal strength.
Eff Signal strength is watts/(range^2) for signal at a given range.
Det a signal is routine at min signal strength, locking it in is difficult.
Shift up one diffmod per order of magnitue lower (EG, if MSS is 100w, and
ess is  10w, that is one order of magnitude lower, and an ess of 2w is two
lower.) and down one difmod per order of magnitude higher.

While it is slightly inaccurate, I simply use the wattage of the radio-set
as the wattage; since I use it for both, and the losses should be similar,
it is close enough for quick figures....

note that it is often easy to detect a signal, but hard to tune a weak
signal in  clear enough that you can understand the conversation.

\'Sliders\' were my fave \'road food\' on those winter trips between Salt Lake 
City and Laramie, Wyoming.  While you *CAN* find them in Cleveland (just off 
of the W 117th Street exit on I-90), it seems that Toledo has *yet* to be 
properly civilised.

On the plus side, there\'s a ****pile of drive-through Chinese restaurants 
here in Toledo, which Cleveland sadly lacks.  My favorite dtC?  Magic Wok, of 
course.

>Surface wave? Or does this require an atmosphere?

All radio is *technically* line of sight. Some important bits:

1) certain bands of radio bounce off of the upper atmosphere, giving a
"Bounceback Circle" based upon clear LOS to the atmospheric layer at which
they bounce and the resultant angle of bounce. Not always circular (due to
local LOS problems), and sometimes has holes... AM and Ham both tend to
have some bounceback.

2) Certain frequencies bounce off of the surface (generally), espacially
HAM frequencies and shortwave.

3) Many modern constuction materials are merely translucent to radio
frequencies, not transparent...

4) some frequencies are abosorbed by some surfaces, and not by others.

5) all transmissions produce "Harmonics"... recievers tuned to 1/4th, 1/2,
1/8th, etc, the transmission pick up a fraction of the signal proportionate
to the harmonic fraction.

6) All a radio is is "vibration in a metal object" being turned into data
carriers, sound, &/or video. Strong enough signals create physical
vibrations; weaker ones merely electric energy.

Combine 2&1, and a cooperative atmosphere, and you get people in south
america picking up BBC from london on the Shortwave.

combine all four (and a few others) and you find out why people too close
to certain stations who broadcast from atop a skyscraper can\'t pick it up,
but people just a little further pick it up on their beds... and the whole
state can pick it up on their radios. (The building blocks the LOS when you
get close enough... metal building frames block much RF. A strong enough
signal on a harmonic frequency to a metal object at the correct angles will
vibrate.... AM is easy to pick up this way. AM bounces back down, and
sometimes bounces up again. Hand radios are far more sensitive than
bedsprings... by several orders of magnitude.)

I increase them by 1 (now), and have added "Stagering" difficulty between
"Formidable" and "Nigh Impossible", and upped the DM limit to +12. So diffs
are:
4,8,12,16,20,24. Note that Nigh Impossible (I used to call it "Ridiculous"
before T4) needs MAX DM\'s and a max die roll to succeed.

I haven\'t really done any economic analysis, but that\'s my take on
it too.

It\'s quite possible that a merchant finding himself in a situation
like this might drop a shuttle, or a couple containers of cargo,
while running for a jump point.  The *convention* might be for the
thief to take this tribute and let the ship go.  The conventions of
a TU could be very different from those of 20th century Earth.

- ----This would also make sense for ships in universes which use actual
thrust to mass ratios, dropping cargo would improve this ratio while also

I think piracy would be more likely in poor and low tech systems
that are fueling wayponts along routes.  Poor systems wouldn\'t have
the resources to finance adaquate system patrols and low tech systems
wouldn\'t have the technology to do so.

Obviously, if these systems were in a strong Empire there could be
Naval patrols.  Patrols would be rare (or nonexistant) in
underdeveloped areas and outside established polities.

My Cr 0.02 :-
1. The higher atmospheric pressure on Shiwonee (Vland\'s surface
atmospheric pressure is ~1.0) :- work of breathing is harder, so more
muscle mass is required to move air in and out - the Geonee will be
\'stockier\'.
You use Your arms and legs to assist in moving air in and out of Your
lungs - funny thing to imagine...Yet actually the partial pressure of
oxygen would be higher (given the same composition of atmoshere) which
should lead to lower respiraion requierments...that doesn\'t take the
necessarity for in/exhaling, ok!
1a. The higher pressure in itself could lead to a decrease in stature
(it\'s a more extreme environment compared to human normal, which will
lead to decreased vertical growth velocity - inferring from
anthropometric studies done on mountain dwellers).
Sounds funny but the Vland environs are also quite hard with no local
lifestock to be readily consumable.
2. The same process that leads to Great Danes and Dachshunds existing
on the same planet : selective breeding.
Another \'Ancient intervention\' then? Doesn\'t please me much.
[3. Artistic or narrative license.]
That\'s always the last ditch, ain\'t it?
Guess I\'ll turn to possibility 3. - my problem is the large amount of
biologists in my group...

Allow me please to introduce myself,
my name is Dave Shayne, I\'ve been a trav. aficionado
since the lbb days.

I am deeply gratefull that I stumbled accross TML.
Not only have I found the last few days worth of the digest informative,
it\'s also oneheckuvahoot.

I\'ll start off by saying that while I own significant parts of CT, MT, TNE,
and T4 I only just found out about GT. Is it worth plunking down a couple
hundred creds?
Not that it really matters, I\'ll have to get it just for the sake of
completeness anyway.

I do have a question that some among you may be able to help me out with. I
am planning on putting together an alternate universe traveller campaign and
want to evolve the setting from scratch using a model based on the PE book
from T4.

But I need info on stellar evolution. If I recall my college astro 101
course brighter stars burn faster.
But I don\'t know how fast this is. IE Sol is a main sequence yellow dwarf,
It will eventually balloon into a red giant, How long does this take, What
is the life cycle of Blue giants, etc.

I\'m reasonably bright so I can usually bugger out technical stuff but if
there is a good non-technical treatment out there I\'d like to know it.

By the way, I live in Ypsi, MI. If there\'s anybody on this list running a
game here or in A2 I\'d be interested in playing. And if I ever get my Pocket
Galaxy together I\'d definitely like to spring it on an apreciative audience.

The traveller stuff I\'ve found on line is going a long way toward justifying
my having a modem in my computer. (For the longest time I didn\'t.)

Looking forward to the fun.

        Hi, Matt.
        Yes, it is.  However, the request was for an explanation a 12-year
old could get his head around.

        A monsterous one.  It fails to disucss about two years worth of
technical and practical savvy, starting with antenna design and wave
propagation, through to the effects of atmospherics and electronic warfare.
However, the original poster requested the reply be kept simple.

        Incorrect on both points, based on current day technology.  Further,
the most obvious piece of kit in the TL12+ EW inventory would be EW drones;
CG-lifted, chamelion skinned, with COMM-4 and SENSOR-4.   Sit and listen,
pick up a signal, move a few times to triangulate, home in on transmitter,
designate with a laser and call in an MRL strike.  Repeat.  Put a dozen of
them out in the FEB and you\'ll have LOS on somebody\'s transmitter.  =)

The question is:

If I\'m going to use a Traveller rules set, AND I own just about
everything ever published by GDW for Traveller, will the GURPS stuff be
useful to me?

Or, is the GURPS stuff just repetitive information I already own using a

        That\'s pretty much how my TNEC milieu works...  most "piracy" is in
fact "privateering".  Corp vs Corp skirmishes through deniable assets.  It
keeps the UN from sending a Peace Keeping fleet to the area.  In fact, most
Privateers are paid by the ton of kill...  they just flare the hull and
didi-mau.  
        The border areas, where there are a lot of "unofficial" colonies
starving for goods, are a different story.  A routine trick is for a
bonafide pirate to nail a ship while it is coming out of a gas giant gravity
well in a more established area.  Board, prize crew it, push the captured
out in a lifeboat or escape pod and then take the ship  and its cargo to a
border area and sell the lot where folks will turn a blind eye.

rough guess, Sol is about 5,000,000,000 years old.
The red giant bit comes in another 5,000,000,000 years (lifetime about 10^10).

With a stellar scale of:

	O B A F G K

Sol is type G.

Type Ks glow for 10^11 - 10^12 years (or approximately "forever")

Blue giants are (IIRC) type O, and I seem to recall an estimate of
60 million years for one example.

If you mean "how long does the red dwarf stage last?" I\'d guess
at a couple of millions years at most.

...

What I ought to do is go home and look this up properly.
Trouble is, if I leave now, someone might notice. ;-)

Ah, my players weren\'t that into it anyway.  They wanted a fantasy
campaign, but I\'d just bought T:NE and I was bound and determined to play
Traveller again :)

None of my players had any previous Traveller experience, and recoiled in
horror when I started describing Virus.  Then I threw this nasty, nasty way
for Virus to propagate itself behind the Claw (for that was the intention
of this strain of Virus, it knew that the Marches were more or less
untainted) and they decided they didn\'t like this universe any more :)

A Lagrange point is a point where the gravitational attraction of two
massive objects cancel each other.  The Earth and Moon have five L-points,
but the ones we\'re interested in are L-4 and L-5.  The points are 60
degrees ahead of and behind the Moon along it\'s orbit.  Put something in
those points, and they\'ll stay there forever. It works something like this:

     0 <--Moon
              * <--L-5  

     *
    *** <--Planet
    *** 
     *

So you will need a large is moon.

Naw, with the expansion of the terran Confederation into space, the
Army/Air Force Exchange service went with them.  So every world of the old
Vilani Imperium soon had little road side AAFES snack bars selling gut
grenades and greasy fries.

By the time of the Third Imperium, Aafes is a four-star chain of resturants.

We know the Vilani can interbreed with Solomani at least; it\'s highly
likely they can with other human races.  We also know that the Vilani
went to some pains to wipe out other human cultures and make them all
culturally Vilani; the Consolidation Wars and the fate of the... umm,
but that\'s an adventure spoiler.

So it\'s possible one reason Vilani aren\'t so Geonee-like is that they
actually have more "minor human race" genes than Vilani genes blended
into the Vilani gene pool.

On the other hand, what about all those Chirpers that hang around the
Geonee?  As I recall, the Geonee society requires Chirpers to approve
of marriages (from TD)...maybe the work of the Great Old One goes on....

What? Woah. Somebody better go revise the electrical engineering texts I used
to study then. 

Radio waves are electromagnetic radiatation, specifically relatively
low-frequency EM radiation. Antennas work by being more... ugh, what\'s the
word... conductive? Susceptible? Anyway, EM radiation moves more easily
through metal (or anything conductive) than it does through air, so when
subjected to am EM field, a small current (voltage? ugh. I have to admit - I
got a really bad mark in the antennas & waveguides course) is induced in the
antenna, which can be amplified, etc.

I have trouble imagining radio waves inducing physical motion in anything,
unless of course the radio waves induce a current, which in turn induces a
magnetic field, which could cause some motion. But otherwise, sticking
something next to a powerful radio broadcast antenna is just likely to make it
hot, not move. The same thing is true of other low-frequence EM devices, like
radar for example. Ask some of the people on the list who have worked on ships
with big radar arrays. Walk in front of them and you won\'t notice a thing,
well, except for your flesh cooking off of your bones. Althugh those sorts of
installations usually use something closer to microwaves, as opposed to radio
waves. (Where\'s my spectrum chart when I need it?)

Well, I\'ve never heard of bed springs picking up radio signals, but if you say
it\'s true, I won\'t debate it. The only possible explanation I can think of is
the I mentioned above - radio induces current, whiich in turn induces a
magnetic field. You mention bedsprings, which is interesting, because they
have that nice spiral shape, just like you find in a wire-wound
electromagnet... I imagine that if you have a bed which is just one long wire
wound into a number of coils (a lot of beds really are just one wire!) then
there\'s a nice long piece of metal for the current to flow through and all
those little coils will no doubt compress & stretch as the current flows
through them. 

But radio waves are not "just vibrations in metal".

There are several reviews of GURPS Traveller on RPG.Net (www.rpg.net).
They are, for the most part, positive.  Rather than review it, I\'ll give
you a rundown of what it contains.  The first 80~ pages are a crash-course
in the history and culture of the Third Imperium, mostly in the same format
as the old "library data" suppliments.  The next 25~ pages deal with
characters, and include character templates for just about every character
type available in CT or MT.  The next 20~ pages deal with equipment and
supplies that are common in the Traveller Universe.  Statistics are
included for about 20 of the most common vehicles found in Traveller
(200-ton Free Trader, 100-ton Scout/Courier, the Air Raft, etc) and
deckplans included for a few.  A modular starship design system is
included.  This system is fully compatible with GURPS Vehicles, and you\'ll
want that book if you intend to deviate from the standard hulls and modules
given here.  Finally, a system is presented whereby starship combat can be
resolved in boardgame style on  a hex grid.  I haven\'t played this
particular game (and, shockingly, there is no example combat) so I can\'t
comment on how well it works.

I personally would have paid full price just for the 80 pages of collated
Traveller info (and would have paid MUCH MORE for it when I was a CT ref).

That\'s a tough one.  I bought GURPS Traveller because I\'ve got
MustbuyeverythingwiththewordTravelleronthecoveritis.  But it IS a good book
- - much better (in my opinion) than T:NE or T4.  It feels like Classic
Traveller using the GURPS engine - and the match feels very right.  It
really depends on whether or not you want to use the GURPS roleplaying engine.

Or you may just want to wait for T5 - it\'s SUPPOSED to be out before the
end of the year.

Ahem, sorry about that :-).  

First, let me say welcome to all the recent listees.  I don\'t think we\'ve
had this many sign-ons in a while (though I don\'t know about lurkers, of
course).  Just so not too much of the obscure references "in humor" (or
alledged "in humor")  flies past you, here are a few pointers: 

1. The commercial viability of pirates is a major pool of gasoline you do
not want to dip your wick into.  Trust me. 

2. Virus is worse.  People have issued death threats over Virus, I\'m not
kidding. 

3. BBQ\'ed K\'Kree seems to be innordinately popular with this group,
probably because the Centaurs are seen as majorly evil (they _have_
genocided a few races for the sin of eating meat, but let he who hasn\'t
sinned throw the first near-C rock, I say :-). 

4. Which brings us to near-C rocks.  The problem here is the immense
amounts of thrust afforded a Traveller ship.  It can thrust continuously
for a month, meaning that even a 1g launch can get to appreciable
percentages of light-speed.  At that velocity, impacting a planet causes
the planet to go bye-bye.  Of course, you can accelerate a chunk of rock
the same way and do the same thing, making it even easier. 

5. I have no idea at all about the Lesbian Aslan (aka female Aslan in
comfy shoes).  Some folks around here are just strange... 

Well, I think that\'s it for "dangerous topics".  We\'ve also had
immense debates about "what is a feudal technocracy?", the characteristics
of various peices of military equipment and lots of other junk I can\'t
remember, but they\'re either distant past or not that important.

Don\'t get me wrong, most of the time the list is very pleasant, and the
folks here have IMMENSE ammounts of knowledge to share (e.g., Robert
O\'Connor for bio, Leonard Erikson for engineering and natural science,
Hans Rencke (sp?) for economics and Traveller history, etc....).

But as you\'ll see in the coming days (cuz #1 is flaring up again and it\'s
impossible to stop it) some people are quite serious about their fantasies
of little spacemen in 57th century. :-) 

Oh, one last thing, don\'t mention former list members Clif (with one f) or
Leroy Guatney (heh heh heh!  Oh wait, wasn\'t I supposed to be dispelling
inside references?  Oh well...).  

Welcome aboard!

Yes, if you want to run the Traveller world setting with the GURPS rules
system.

There is some new information--but a lot of said new information is
considered highly alarming, non-canon and generally a Bad Thing on the
order of a Virus-infected pirate attached to a near-C rock transported by
jump missile.

Basically, if you just want to run old-school Traveller, you\'re better off
using your old Traveller stuff. If you want to use the GURPS rules set to
run games in the Traveller universe, then GURPS Traveller is a quite
comprehensive way to do so (though, to be honest, they\'re still finishing
it in parts.) The old Traveller LBB\'s, BCB\'s (big colorful books), deck
plans, secret decoder ring and Sergei hault-Oberlindes action figure are
all still good...

You send enough of your crew over to the prize to man it, and (assuming

That one arose from the 3:1 ratio of femal to male Aslan.  Some of us

Of _course_ they do! How _else_ are you going to show off that gorgeous
electric orange and green polka-dot jumpsuit with the tasteful tartan
trimmings? Of course the fur is dyed with irridescent purple and yellow
stripes to match, and to top it off the strobe lights in the hat just
_make_ the whole thing hang together perfectly.

Yeesh...no fashion sense at _all_...just like the _rest_ of the naked

There is significant debate about _how_ different H. neandetalensis and
H. sapiens truly were, tied into what exactly happened to H.
neandertalensis: were they displaced, out competed, or simply merged?

I can\'t remember where I saw it, but within the last month I saw an
article discussing genetic similarity of Neandertal man with modern H.
sap.

There are no other members of the Homo genus, so we\'re not sure, but
there are a number of other genera with quite fertile interspecies
crosses.

Foex: Canis latrans (coyote), Canis lupus (gray wolf), and Canis
familiaris (everything from Rottweilers to chihuahuas) are all quite
happily interfertile yet recognized as different species.

In fact there are serious suggestions that the Red wolf (Canis rufus)
may not be a separate species at all, but a hybrid wolf/coyote.

	It\'s time to draw attention to my ignorance of Lagrange 
	points.  O.K., I know that a Lagrange point is a point 
	where the gravity of two masses cancels out, but with my
	feeble understanding of physics I can only imagine one
	such point: directly between the masses (half-way if the 
	masses are equal).  Can somebody sort me out?

        <Translated from a message sent by a Vargr named Goghuez>
        Actually, that\'s a common problem with Humans.  They seem to presume
because thier pets have no fashion requirements that anything that evolved
from them doesn\'t either.  Of course, they forget all the monkeys they keep
in zoos as pets when they do that.
        There\'s a joke amongst some less racially sensitve Vargr that runs
along the lines that the only difference between a Baboon and a Human is
that the Baboon has figured out there\'s nothing on the rack that\'ll make him
look any good, so why bother?  Of course, I frown on that sort of thing.
        Another very good reason that the Chosen Ones *do* wear clothing is
very straight forward.  When you are proud warrior race, as we are, you
learn the value of covering anything you do not wish damaged in armor.  By
the time a culture becomes a star-faring one, technology allows clothing and
light armor to be virtually indistinguishable.  Which is just as well,
because I *hate* literally getting my tail shot off in a nightclub by a
jealous boyfriend.
        Oh, and by the way...   I wouldn\'t be caught dead in a had with
strobe lights...  that was out of fashion last year.  It\'s soft red and rust
phosphorescent inset panels in cuffs, collars and hat brims that are all the
rage on Lair right now....

	For me, the society in "Deathworld II" by Harry Harrison fits
	this nicely.  It is a feudal society with each faction holding

There was a scene in one of the TSR Buck Rogers books where an \'computer
personality\'  (someone who had his personality digitized and ran as a
program) decided to make a more permanent backup of himself.

He used a laser drill to carve a binary representation of his code into a
slab of bedrock.  The idea was that if in the future someone scanned the
carvings into a computer, his program would be brought \'back to life\'.

There was also an article in either Discovery or Nat. Geo. that covers the
discovery of a possible Neand/Cro hybrid skeleton. Of course many scientists
are contesting this.

A near C rock has a devastating effect against a planet, right? So, surely a
pebble will have a devastating effect on a near C rock. Put a really tiny
thruster  and a really tiny computer/radio receiver on pebbles and scatter
them around a planet, so you can hopefully put a few of them in the path of
near C rocks if you detect them coming in. The problem of course is
detecting them, responding in time, and will the resulting shower of near C
shrapnel be significantly less deadly than the near C rock?

My contention would be that while it would be theoretically possible to
accelerate a mass to near-C, it would be almost impossible to HIT anything
with it.  You\'ve got a planet hurtling around a star which is hurtling
around the galactic core.  How are you going to hit something like that
with an object that must be constantly accelerated (possibly for years)
before it gets to the desired velocity?

Oh, God, here we go...

Of course jump torps exist.  They mass about 100 tons and are made out of
old scout courier ships refitted with autopilots.  It just takes a fairly
hefty ship to consider them as torpedoes. ;)

You don\'t have to hit anything.  Just choose a decent size rock and as you
approach C it\'s mass will increase to such an extent that just passing
through the solar system will probably cause some orbital realignment to
occur.  Not instantly fatal, but damn annoying to have to move your
civilization to a new world every time some enemy shifts your planet out of
the life zone.

      1) They let you do interesting stuff, like fly around in planetary
systems without worrying about fuel or taking months to get there.
      2) They have been around since at least MT, and canon says the OTU
uses them.
   B) Are bad because
      1) They violate multiple principles of physics, (most especially
conservation of energy) which turns them into perpetual motion machines
that let you do things like launch near-c rocks. 

II) HEPlaR 
   A) is good because:
      1) It doesn\'t break as many physical laws as badly as T-Plates do.
   B) is bad because:
      1) You have to carry a lot of extra reaction mass and you are
severely limited in your ability to move around the system.

No rehash of these points is required. What I would like to know is if any
heretic has worked out what kind of power requirements contragrav and
T-plates would require if they *didn\'t* violate conservation of energy?
Never mind what they do to General Relativity.

You are undoubtedly more familiar with the subject than I am, and no, I
don\'t have any specific references. As I said, this was speculative. It
appears reasonable to believe that even stars begin as I suggested. In that
case, the process runs away, and the initial core material is quickly
melted and then vaporized and mixed well with the rest of the stellar
hydrogen. Gas giants start similarly but run out of material before they
reach stellar size. 
   The chondrules found in meteorites suggest that small bodies (sand grain
to marble size) developed from interstellar material _before_ the protosun
ignited, were heated to the melting point of the minerals, then cooled
(rapidly) and began accumulating again into larger bodies. This second
stage (in the inner system) of accretion would then proceed as you
indicate.

Contragrav has a minimum power requirement of (velocity relative to anchor mass) * (thrust), where velocity is in meters/second and thrust is in newtons, and both are vector quantites.  Its power requirements can be negative.

Thruster plates either have the same power requirements as contragravity (in which case an \'anchor mass\' must be defined) or have a power requirement of 3x10^8 watts/newton (in which case its simply a total conversion reaction drive).

Not really.At near C that big rock has a hugantous mass; a little
pebble\'s going to make a cloud of vapor in the very front of this Near C
rock that\'s still heading toward your planet.

Nope, just as bad, in fact.

The ten rules of AAFES:

1.  All AAFES establishments are staffed by either dependants from some
country where the US Army passed through twenty years ago, or the road cast
of Pink Flamingos.  In either case, they will speak a language you cannot
identify.

2. AAFES stocks absolutely nothing of any use to an active duty soldier.

3. AAFES management thinks a sale on snow tires at Ft. Hood, TX in August
is a good idea.

4. The roach-coaches and snack bars are run by single families.  All of
whom tend to be from obscure SE Asian hill tribes who speak a language that
Ft. Meade couldn\'t decipher.

5. The gut-grenade (Cheeseburger with everything) *must* include jalapenos.

6. All roach coach personal who aren\'t SE Asian are retired Sergeants-Major
who will invariably address you as "general".

7. AAFES sells seven different brands of gun cleaning equipment, none of
which can be used on the M-16 series rifles.

8. AAFES has the most efficient spy network in existence.  No matter how
secret your deployment, they manage to jack up the price of cigarettes and
other comfort items just before your chain of command alerts you to the
impending move.

9. At any given time, in any exchange, over half the people will be
non-military personnel shopping on a friend\'s authorization.

10. The clothing store has DI for every organization in the Army.  Except,
of course, for the one you\'ve just been PCS\'d to.

If you plan a Merchant Campaign go and buy Far Trader now, do not pass go,
do not collect 200 currency units.... it is the best new Traveller book in
a while and massively expands mercenary campaigns.
First In looks good and is an expanded scouts - if you have Bk 6 / WBH it
may not be necessary.

GT rules - new stuff (GURPS rules) and old stuff (background)
BtC covers the Marches in 1120 in the alternative timeline
Star mercs is an updated mercenary.
GT AR1 and AR2 duplicate older CT material with a few twists.

In order of new usefulness...

1st ..... Far Trader
First In
BtC (reference for entire Marches)
Last.... Star mercs/AR1/AR2

The AR books are nice, but the David Pulver minor races are lousy......

All this IMO, and all the books so far have been better than the average IG
issue.

Oh, as a separate issue, you can define T-plates as having a fuel requirement of 1 ton H2 per 10,000 newtons (1 ton) per year, in which case they don\'t violate conservation of energy or momentum, though they are direct matter->energy converters.  This means a typical scout ship (mass 500 tons, thrust 1,000 tons) needs 1000 tons H2/year, or 20 tons/week, which is no worse than jump fuel for a week.

	Just a quick note about the potential for viability of
	hybrids between species.  Most biologists use the
	\'biological species concept\' to define species: a species
	is a group of organisms that does or can potentially
	interbreed successfully.  This definition is widely useful
	when looking at extant (non-extinct) vertebrates, but has
	big problems when applied to plants, clonal animals,
	bacteria, etc. (organisms that tend to hybridize easily, 
	or which do not interbreed at all).  It also has big
	problems when applied to extinct species, about who\'s
	breeding habits we know little.  And then there are
	\'chronospecies.\'  As a \'species\' evolves, it slowly changes
	until it\'s members can no longer hybridize with their
	ancestors.  How long does this take?  How different would
	the two \'chronospecies\' look?  What do we call the 
	intermediate forms that may have been able to hybridize,
	perhaps with reduced success?  When paleontologists and
	anthropologists name closely-related species that are no 
	longer with us, it is based on differences in physical
	structures that seem to be as big as those of extant
	species (the degree of difference that is required to
	earn separate species status varies from taxon to taxon).
	Thus, these species distinctions may not live up to the 
	\'biological species concept.\'

Well as I understand planet formation (i.e. dimly) planets beyond the "snow
line" enter a runaway accretion process hence forming gas giants. The "snow
line" is the distance at which water ice can form in a developing system.

>Can a planet orbit two stars and still be in a habitable zone?

Very close together stars, yes.

If the stars are at moderate separation and of vastly different stellar types
then it is possible for a planet to be in two life zones at once. e.g. planet
orbiting a dim M class companion star which in turn is orbiting a bright F class
star. Seasons would be interesting. The eccentricity of the stars orbits would
have to be unusually low for this to happen too.

Actually, I\'d say _First In_ supercedes those two books in terms of pure
planetary gearheadness and scientific accuracy.

I sat down to play with the system a few day ago, and eneded up scrapping
most of my Lunion work (again) because the system is so elegant and simple
to use.

Be warned, you *will* have to fudge numbers to get results that resemble

I\'m not too sure about that, and as far as I know we don\'t have any

Of course, but in the case of the transplanted races Ancient
tinkering is an OTU given.  Any technology that could change
proto-wolves into bipedal, sentient creatures with opposable thumbs,
could do strange and awesome things to any sub-specie of Homo...and
probably did.

Si, gut!  Me likey!

Seriously, I could go for *that* scale. At least, I could remember it without doing mental gyrations..something the original MT scale required of me. Okay, it\'s a personal shortcoming, but I really did have a problem remembering 3,7,11,15,19. It was just so non-intuitive...for me.

BTW, I notice no one told me what the full characteristic is used for in MT..other than wounds and injuries. Could it be that the full characteristic isn\'t really used for anything else in MT? And if that\'s true...

Um...I can\'t think of much that you wouldn\'t have.

This is what\'s out (I think), my comparision to previous Trav.
material and my rating...

Star Mercs

 Covers part of B4, I wasn\'t impressed, but I\'m not big on Merc
 campaigns so I\'m not the best one to comment.  
 "C+", and I\'m being kind.

Far Trader 

 This covers Merchant Prince + some extra stuff that should be
 useful in a merchant campaign.  I like a lot of the supporting
 stuff in Far Trader, Certificates for various crew positions and
 sample Ship\'s Articles come to mind.  There is a trade system in
 Far Trader that is more complicated than anything Trav so far...I
 can\'t say better or worse because I\'m not using it.  I\'m using an
 expanded CT Trade and Speculation Table of my own design.  
 "A", I might be overrating this one, because I like merchant games
 so much.

First In 
 Covers B6+World Builder\'s Handbook (or GS+GC, I\'m told).  Like me,
 you\'ll probably be more comfortable with B6+WBH than First In. Plus
 tweeks, of course.  ;->
 "A-", mainly because it generates GURPS worlds not Traveller ones
 (stat wise) and I\'m more comfortable with the GDW+DGP combo, but
 for those without B6+WBH it\'s a *must* buy.

Aliens I & II 
 Covers various alien races books.  The minor species haven\'t been
 too useful for me, or as someone else said "inspiring", and some
 details for the major species have been dropped or changed. 
 "C",  just didn\'t do it for me.

Behind the Claw
 This is the Spinward Marches book for GURPS.  If I was playing in
 *that* TU, it would be very useful.  No UWP\'s, and for *me* that\'s
 a big negative, also some changes to the old SM background, but I
 don\'t play in that TU either, so that doesn\'t bother me.
 "B", for me because I appreciate all the work and can use the world
 details in MTU and if I was playing in the GTU it would get an
 "A-", drat those missing UWP\'s!
 
Coming up..

Starports 
 Hum, the closest is that JTAS article so probably lots of good
 stuff here.  From the beta files I\'ve seen, I have high hopes.
 It gets a provisional "A", but we\'ll see.

?Starships?  
 This is supposed to be the GURPS:  Starship Operator\'s Manual.  I
 haven\'t seen the beta yet, so it\'s a ways off.  It\'ll have to be
 *very* good to match SOM.

There\'s also an ImpNavy and ImpArmy/Marines in the pipe, I think.

>Or, is the GURPS stuff just repetitive information I already own

Pretty much.

Solar sails are supposed (AFAIK)to work by harnessing the minute impact

massive surface area.  I\'ve heard talk of using lasers to give a solar craft
a good starting shove out of a solar system.  I can accept all of this.

......

Except, if photons exert pressure, than they must have mass, albeit very
minutely.  Photons travel @C so there mass at rest (I you could stop one)
must be even smaller and amplified by there tremendous velocity.  If this is
true, then the true limiting speed should be fat above the speed of light,
as photons must be traveling at a speed where their mass has increased to
the point where there is no more energy to provide acceleration.

So:
If the true limiting speed is greater than C what is it?

Do photons not have mass and photonic pressure is some other phenomenon of
some energy being converted to kinetic energy?

If C is the true limiting speed, and photons do have mass, why are we not
killed by incredibly massive photons?

Is this one of the particle/wave duality phenomena?  Can photons travel at
high velocity as waves and impact as particles with only slight mass? And if
so, how do we exploit this phenomenon for regular matter?

Please feel free to expose my ignorance.

1/5th (round down) of your stat can be used as a DM towards task rolls.

0-4 = 0
5-9 = +1
10-14 = +2
15+ = +3

The direct fire task uses Weapon skill + Dex + movement DM.

So a person with a dex of 10 and has handgun-2 has a +4 DM to hit his

You are confusing "beamed" vs "omindirectional" antennas. Simple rod
antennas tend to be omnidirectional. Multi-element dipoles tend to
concentrate the signal along one axis. And when you get to short enough
wavelengths, "dish" antennas act like searchlights.

But none of this affects the "line of sight" nature of radio. The
antennas have to do with *aiming*. But "line of sight" refers to the
need to have a clear signal path between the trasmitter and receiver.

The trick is that EM waves tend to "wrap around" obstacles with a size
"near" their wavelengths. That\'s why broadcast AM with wavelengths in
the kilometer range can be heard even with buildings between you and
the transmitter. Even with (some) hills between you and it.

Also, these "lower" frequencies tend to bounce off the ionosphere,
giving them the ability to be received worldwide. 

But as the wavelengths get shorter (FM & TV) the wavelengths get small
enough that they start *reflecting* off of buildings and terrain. Which
leads to "ghosts" on TV (same signal arriving by paths of differing
lengths), and to "dead zones". 

One thing that helps FM radio a bit is that signals that *graze* the
edge of an obstacle will refract around it a bit. So signals that skim
the top of a ridgeline will refract a bit into the valley on ther other
side. But only a bit. 

So unless you are using *long* wavelengths, you really do need line of
sight between the transmitter and receiver.

Depends a lot on wavelength. The shorter the wavelength, the quicker
the wave *quits* following the curvature of the surface. And rugged
terrain will just make things worse.

That depends a lot on their mass and age. 

For example, there\'s a class of star known as a "contact binary". Two
stars are orbiting so close that their photospheres are probably in
contact! 

A planet could orbit such stars and be habitable. I\'m just not sure
that planets are *likely* in such a system.

You also get things like white dwarfs orbiting more normal stars.
Again, a habitable zone exists, but it\'s not certain that there could
be any planets to *be* in that zone.

I\'d *love* to see what would happen if he was given a moderately free

relativity break down for lightspeed, the mass of a massless particle at
lightspeed is 0/0 (a particle with no rest mass can _only_ move at the speed
of light; a particle with rest mass can only move less than c.  A particle
with imaginary rest mass can only move faster than c).

Apologies for not replying sooner, Doug. I get the digest form and
completely missed your question during my skimming.

I believe (and I\'m no expert) that some of the larger volcanoes may
indeed be "permanent", if such a word can be used in relation to
Io\'s surface.

The point about imaginary rest mass was only for completeness; assuming a tachyon existed, it would have imaginary rest mass.  No known particles move faster than light.

It\'s been far too long! How is everything going, well I hope!

Anyway, being a reabid collector these days I\'ve bought most of the
GURPS stuff (not to mention, it\'s the OTHER system I game in). I\'d have
to say grab Far Trader and First In if you can. They\'re GURPS but the
merchant information in Far Trader is what we should have seen in T4!
You just have to tweak them to fit the Trav engine. THe same goes for
First In and system, planet design. Come to think of it YOU ARE the guy
I\'d like to see tweak the GURPS oriented stuff for use in the Trsv
engine, just let me know what your doing!

It got dissolved as it was produced by radio-isotope decay in the
surrounding rocks. After all an alpha particle is just a doubly ionized
helium atom.

While it\'s not a gas at normal temperatures, N2O5 deserves at least
*some* mention. It combines rapidly with water to produce concentrated
nitric acid.

N2O5 + H2O -> 2 HNO3

LaGrange points are named after the astronomer who worked out their
existence (from theory!). 

The usual sort of setup is a primary (planet or star) with a smaller
secondary (moon or planet) orbiting it. The secondary body has to be a
*lot* smaller. I vaguely recal a 15:1 or 25:1 figure being tossed
around. The earth-moon system fits, as does the Sol-Jupiter. 

There are 5 Lagrange points in such a system. They are points where the
gravitational *and "centrifugal"* forces balance out such that a body
*much* smaller than the secondary can remain in a fixed relationship
with both the primary and secondary. (Ie, you put it there and it\'ll
stay, with the relative angles of the primary and secondary being
constant) 

First, you draw a straight line thru the center of both bodies and
extending a fair ways past the orbit of the secondary (on both sides of
the primary). L1, L2, and L3 are all on this line.

L1 is between the primary and the secondary, but a *lot* closer to the
secondary body. It is *not* the point at which the gravity of the two
"cancels". 

L2 is roughly the same distance from the secondary, but on the side
*opposite* the primary. 

L3 is on the far side of the primary from the secondary, and a but
farther away from the primary. 

If anyone has guidelines for calculating the exact positions of L1,L2,
and L3 I\'d appreciate getting copies.

L1, L2, and L3 are only stable *along* the line. Drift a little bit
sideways, and the forces will push you in the same direction you are
drifting. Sort of like balancing a ball on the top of a hill. Oops. 

Still, they are usefull for some limited purposes 

L4 and L5 are 60 degrees ahead and behind the secondary, in the same
orbit. Thus, each forms an equilateral triangle with the primary and
secondary being the other two corners.

These are also referred to as "trojan points" because of the trojan
asteroids which were discovered in Jupiter\'s L4 & L5 points.

These *are* long term stable. As long as you don\'t drift *too* far from
the point, forces tend to push you back towards it. 

Note that Trojan points are a *long* ways from the primary *or* the
secondary. Especially if you are talking about planetary or stellar
trojan points.

Yep. As the cloud of dust & gas contracts, the random motions turn into
a spin, and collisions regularize the results into a fairly broad disk.
This explains why planets are in (more or less) the same plane, *and*
why why the tend to rotate in the same direction.

Oddities, such as Venus rotating backwards, Uranus having an axial tilt
that is almost in the plane of it\'s orbit, and Pluto\'s odd iunclination
can be explained as the results of a few *big* collisions late in the
process.

The other "retrograde" (moving backwards) objects are pretty obviously
random small asteroids captured more recently.

> Can a planet orbit two stars and still be in a habitable zone?

Only if the stars are close to each other. And even then I\'d have to do
a lot of checking of luminosity vs distance before I\'d say yes.

Shawn, that was my point! I know *1/5* of the characteristic is used for tasks, and during character generation some secondary stats are composed of sums of various characteristics, but where, in play, is the *full* characteristic value used?

It gets used in rolls that aren\'t tasks. For example, I often require my players
to do an intelligence check. That\'s simply a 2D roll, with success being the Int
value or less.

If you\'re backward compatible with the older Traveller adventures, you\'ll need
the full characteristics for many of the rolls in those books.

The full value of Int and of Educ gets used to determine the maximum skills a
character may have.

The full value of characteristics is used in modifier definitions. For examples,
look at the Enlistment modifiers in CharGen, or the Strength modifier used in
the Broadsword weapon.

They also get used, if I recall correctly, to calculate the distances characters
may jump, either horizontally or vertically.

Kenneth,

I also have just about everthing published for Traveller since \'78 and
I\'ve found most of the GURPS material about 50% useful. "First In" is
very marginally useful (Book 6 - Scouts covers most of it) but
"Far Traders" blows the socks of anything previously published for
Traveller merchants (IMO).

The mercenary supplement has some very nice detail for military/para-
military campaigns and the basic Traveller book is very useful for
converting characters to GURPS.

All in all, if you\'re going to buy only one GT book to supplement your
Traveller collection, go with "Far Traders".

Just my thoughts...

	In fact, that\'s the concept behind a "link budget" beloved of comm
planners, especially satellite comm planners. Simply add together a
bunch of factors representing transmitter signal power, antenna gain,
space loss (range), atmosphere loss, receiver antenna gain, receiver
noise, and receiver sensitivity. If the result is above the minimum
S/N ... you\'re good to go.

just such an expansion for DSR ...

When I was researching alternative respiratory pigments, I recall that
there was *specific* mention of cyanide radicas *not* bonding to
hemerythin. 

So not only do we have a "taint", we have a *known* means of making the

That\'s because Lagrange points *aren\'t* where *gravity* cancels out.
They are where gravity AND INERTIAL forces balance. Remember, the

Heck, as human, I can tell you that I don\'t find that comment

	OK, it\'s not *cancel* out. You\'re right, there\'s only one such
point, the (IIRC) L1 point. Rather, it\'s points of stability in an
orbit. Folks feel free to correct me where I stray (especially with
the numbering). 

	Lagrange points are named after the (French?) mathematician
Lagrange, who calculated stable points in a limited three-body
system, where one body is much much smaller than the other two (m3 <<
m1, m2). For simplicity, I\'m going to call the bodies Sun, Earth, and
Satellite. Earth is orbiting Sun. Those points are:

	L1. At this point, Satellite is in a circular path between Sun and
Earth, and its ANGULAR rate (how long it takes to go around Sun) is
the same as the rate of Earth, so it stays between them. That is,
both Earth and Satellite take the same amount of time to complete an
orbit. Now, this means that Satellite is moving SLOWER than it would
in a simple two-body system (Satellite orbiting Sun without Earth
around). However, the difference between the gravitational pull of
Sun and Earth is *just* enough to counteract the tendency to fall
towards Sun in an elliptical orbit. Arrows show motion:

            Sun


            Sat -->


            Earth -->


	L2. At this point, Satellite is in a circular path on the *opposite*
side of Sun from Earth, and its ANGULAR rate is the same as Earth
again, so it stays exactly opposite. However, it further out than
Earth, which means it\'s going faster than a circular orbit. Here, the
gravitational pull of Earth _adds_ to the pull of Sun, and
counteracts the tendency to move out in an elliptical orbit.

         <-- Sat


             Sun


             Earth -->

	L3. At this point, Satellite is in a circular path, on the opposite
side of *Earth* from sun. Here again, it\'s moving faster than a
"normal" orbit, but the addition of Earth and Sun\'s gravity keep it
from moving outward

             Sun


             Earth -->


             Sat -->

	L4 and L5. These are the famous "Trojan" points. They\'re in the same
orbit as Earth, but 60 degrees ahead or behind. This one I\'m having
trouble explaining in words; maybe I\'ll try and draw a graphic.

	Stability: Note that only the L1, L4 and L5 points are
"stable"--that is, if an object in one of them is subject to a
disturbance that would cause it to move out of the point, there would
be a tendency for them to drift back in. L2 and L3 and "unstable"--if
they\'re perfectly in the point, they\'ll stay, but the slightest
disturbance will magnify and they\'ll come shooting out. Think of
trying to balance a bowling ball on a needle. If you get it *just*
*right*, great, but a micron of offcenter, and it tumbles.

Of course, unlike the other topics listed above, the last-named item is
anything _but_ controversial among TMLers (as C**f could attest, were he
still around).  I think that there would be near-unanimity that one
should take extreme care not to annoy Ms. Ditzjammer Spofulam....

Speaking of whom, we haven\'t heard much recently from Famile
Spofulam....

Eris,

physical stats are used to base physical actions on...

Throwing for height is directly proportional to strength score
Jumping for height and distance...
etc etc

mental stats, to limit skills

social to differentiate the range more (not 1= oik, 2 =middle class oik,
3=noble!)
Hope this answers your question. (I actually read and understood this
question before I answered,
which is quite good for me!) Maybe I should be a \'Rules expert\' and not a

Still isnt goanna work, Eris.

The traffic that pirates would prey on would belong to systems A and E.
They would therefore either lend resources and otherwise co-operate with
systems B, C and D to ensure local security, or send in their Marines to
establish a local government that will secure peace and good order in those
systems.

The other alternative is that worlds B,C and D would tax through traffic,
in order to afford system defenses. These alternatives have the byproduct
of making worlds B,C and D protected from raiders attacking the worlds
themselves.

The final alternative is that worlds A and E would not care that their
ships, cargos and crews are getting attacked. I would submit that this isnt
likely, if the route between A and E is of any importance whatsoever. A
really, really tiny fraction of a big world\'s GWP provides a lot of security.

Thanks for asking.  I\'m doing very well.  I had a little brush with death a
few months ago.  Buddy of my on a jet ski decided to use me as an NPC in a
James Bond movie.  He was following too close, and when I slowed down to hit a
wave, he jumped right over me--jet ski and all.

I fractured three vertibrae, but I was damn lucky.  The Big Guy upstairs was
looking out for me.  Doc said if I had been hit an inch to the left, the
impact would have severed my spine.

But today, I\'m up and walking with nothing to show for the accident except
some persistant swelling.

On the other end of things, the movie is coming along.  The project has really
grown.  I\'ve gone from this small movie to a budget with six figures.  We\'ll
be shooting this fall.

Thanks for the vote of confidence, but I\'m way too busy with the film to start
tweaking things.  That\'s why I was looking at using just one Trav system, as
is, if I\'m going to play that as my next campaign.

I\'ve gotten a bit spoiled by WEG\'s Star Wars mechanics.  They\'re the best I\'ve
ever seen in any game.  I wish Trav\'s was something that elegant.

So...that brings up the point...what about T5?

I\'ve been out of it for a while (a year and a half).  What is Marc going to do
with T5?

This is the way it looks like it works to me.

1)
Stars begin their lives at the hot (ie bluer, ie B stage)
or at least toward the blue end of the spectrum.
as a given star ages it slowly cools down, moving toward the red, or M end.

2)
The stars initial mass will determine how quickly this occurs, and has a
great bearing on weather the end star product is a black hole, nuetron star,
or brown dwarf.

Given those two axioms, and I\'ve thought about it a good deal but I don\'t
really have any info to back up statement 1. And science without data is
like twinkies without the cream (or K\'Kree without sauce?)
It may look good but it\'s dry and tasteless.

So am I making a fool of myself if I try to pawn something based on this as

It sounds as though the next version of Traveller is at least a year away
from production.  That gives GURPS Traveller a two year head start on
whatever is to come.  And what is it that we can expect from the next
version of "real" Traveller?  Well, look for a new milieu (time period) to
be introduced.  Sounds like it will be 200 years beyond M0, in a time of
rapid expansion for the Third Imperium.  This will be an interesting era to
adventure in, but it adds yet another time frame to take into consideration
when learning about the game.  Although this will be the initial era
supported by the new edition,  look for support material for the other eras
(with the exception of the alternate time-line of GT) to follow within six
months.

One more thing.  I have heard rumors that there will be a totally new set of
mechanics for "T5".   Not just a revamped or corrected version of T4, but a
new system.  It seems that the system will be modern, generic and very
detailed.  Marc might have spilled the news at GenCon.  Anyone heard?

Well, if you\'re going to talk about Vulcan, forge ahead.  It\'s beginning

The ten rules of AAFES:

1.  All AAFES establishments are staffed by either dependants from some
country where the US Army passed through twenty years ago, or the road cast
of Pink Flamingos.  In either case, they will speak a language you cannot
identify.

2. AAFES stocks absolutely nothing of any use to an active duty soldier.

3. AAFES management thinks a sale on snow tires at Ft. Hood, TX in August
is a good idea.

4. The roach-coaches and snack bars are run by single families.  All of
whom tend to be from obscure SE Asian hill tribes who speak a language that
Ft. Meade couldn\'t decipher.

5. The gut-grenade (Cheeseburger with everything) *must* include jalapenos.

6. All roach coach personal who aren\'t SE Asian are retired Sergeants-Major
who will invariably address you as "general".

7. AAFES sells seven different brands of gun cleaning equipment, none of
which can be used on the M-16 series rifles.

8. AAFES has the most efficient spy network in existence.  No matter how
secret your deployment, they manage to jack up the price of cigarettes and
other comfort items just before your chain of command alerts you to the
impending move.

9. At any given time, in any exchange, over half the people will be
non-military personnel shopping on a friend\'s authorization.

10. The clothing store has DI for every organization in the Army.  Except,
of course, for the one you\'ve just been PCS\'d to.

A sample:
   By late IY (Imperial Year) -30,  Cleon was developing serious plans for
a new wave of expansion, and was finding the outdated information from the
first and second empires worse than useless, and that from the several
centuries of Sylean expansion haphazard and incomplete. A series of
meetings with existing scout agencies late that year convinced him that an
entirely new approach was needed. He started a new agency with the mission
of starting over from scratch early in -29 and funded it at first by
dismantling the older agencies with conflicting missions and values, and
transferring their useful assets to the new service. 
   The smallest ship-portable fusion reactors available at TL-11 made small
ships overpowered and bulky. The scout-courier of the time, which was much
less common then than it later became, was 110 tons instead of the 100 that
later became standard. An extended 120 ton version with extended life
support of up to three months was the smallest vessel used for exploration.
    The first missions were quiet reconnaisance. The very first of these
were to simply go to the existing borders and scan the nearest neighbors
from a parsec away. These were partly training missions, but Cleon hoped to
get useful information from them. His scout commander was less sanguine
about that part. Before the first wave of scouts returned, Cleon was
appalled to find learn his his intended program was in serious jeopardy
because the mapping sensors on most scout craft were not adequate for even
good detection of gas giants in neighboring systems.  Veteran scouts agreed
that one of the hazards of the scout service was that scouts usually went
to uncharted systems blind and ignorant of what was really there, but  this
could not be helped, because to provide adequate sensors would triple the
cost of a small scout, and larger ones were too expensive.  Cleon muttered
something about being the Federation being millicredit savvy and megacredit
stupid, and immediately ordered half a dozen of the older variety of
extended scout retrofitted with upgraded sensors.
   This measure won him the instant approval of the scouts, except for
those who had to man the new vessels. The additional sensor gear reduced
the 4 staterooms, adequate for the crew of four and two passengers for the
usual courier hop, to 3, which turned the usual recon mission of several
months into a recipe for claustrophobia. In spite of these hardships, the
measure was considered a resounding success. The second wave of explorers
brought back survey data of unprecedented quality on neigboring systems.

H2S will have to be generated by geological, biological, or
industrial processes on worlds with breathable oxygen. It gets
oxidized to SO2 on those.

SO2 and SO3 disssolve in water. Industrial and geolocial
processes make lots of SO2 on earth. They make the rain acid, but
the acid rain gets them out of the atmosphere. All you have to do 
to solve the problem is to shut down smokestack industry and 
volcanoes...

Once again, not under conditions humans would find habitable in
the first place. The relative scarcity of both arsenic and boron
and the fact that both will react with water, let alone oxygen,
argues aginst them.

Geologically young planets with an atmosphere but no free oxygen may
commonly sport deadly taints (to Humaniti) such as CO, H2S, HCN,
halogenated hydrocarbons, and the like.  But one man\'s poison may
well be another being\'s meat (or essential nutrient, if you
prefer)

Of course, if *I* were a pir^H^H^H Ethically Challenged Merchant on a
poor(ish), low trade world, I\'d simply set up a dummy company, order some
high value / low volume goods, get a delivery date, and wait for a nice,
juicy targ^H^H^H friendly local delivery merchant vessel to Jump in.

Just my MCr20 (if all goes to plan... ahar matey\'s! We\'ll make \'em walk the
spacelock, Ahar!)

Ahem...

This is, of course, purely hypothetical, and for edutainment use only,
honestly officer...

Of course I have valid shipping dockets for all these laser damaged cargo
crates, I just don\'t have them *with* me.

    OK, lets say System A & E are Pop 9 & TL 11 worlds.  They would each
have 120 SDBs each.  So they have 3 extra worlds to protect.  So System A
places 20 SDBs on System B & 10 SDBs on System C.  System E places 20 SDBs
on System D & 10 SDBs on System C.  Leaving 90 SDBs in their home systems.
Now, 20 SDBs are able to handle a single pirate, but then they really have
nothing to do & well, bribery is a way of life.  I.e. the Pirates can bribe
the crews of the SDBs.

    And, then you have the advent of Smuggling on Systems B, C, & D.  And
the Pirates turn from preying on the Merchants to helping the Merchants get
cargo\'s through Systems B, C, & D.

    Yes, if you are talking about Patrol Cruisers & SDBs.  But, you are
forgeting that Pirates will not constantly strike every ship that goes past
them.  They will strike everyso often.  They are a minor drain on the ecnomy
of a system, & they could be bribing the right people to keep this from
happening.

This is where things usually start going "will too", "won\'t"...but
let\'s be different and NOT! ;->

So, I\'ll agree with you.  It won\'t work...long term or often, and
maybe not at all in the mature 3I. However, IMTU, it will work a few
times before the screws tighten, and it may work again at some
future point when the screws loosen.

Might I point out that, IMTU, System A and E, and some of the
intervening systems are likely in different polities and some of
those polities might have *no* interest in protecting merchant ships
belonging to other factions.  Might prefer that merchant ships from
other polities have problems, but not want to directly provoke a
war.  Might turn a blind eye to certain activities by certain
parties... as long as they mind their manners at home.

Now that....that will be awesome...if they come up with a good set of

Oooh Yippee, something I can apply my expensive student loan to...

H. neandertalensis is nowadays (unless everyone has changed their minds
again in the last five years) classed as H. sapiens neanderthalensis, ie a
subspecies of archaic Hom. Sap. There is probably a little H.S.N (amongst
others) in all of us. H. Erectus was out of the picture by c 300 ky BP.  Of
course, the ancients may have tinkered with the root stock to create
\'modern\' Hom. Sap., and taken some of the modified variety to seed the stars
(though this argument on the origins of Hom. Sap. would probably not have
been graded to well <g>)

Erwin, my point is that the *full* characteristic isn\'t really used
much in MT during play.  I know there are a few places they come up,
but mighty few.

Nope, that\'s a house rule, right?  You *could* do the same thing
as a MT Task using the INT/5 value, and I seem to remember that
Characteristic only tasks for things like this using the X/5 value
are described.

Sorry, still not part of MT itself.  I can understand having them
there if you\'re playing TNE or T4 where they are used a lot, or CT
were there isn\'t the MT Task System.  If you\'re using MT, though,
shouldn\'t you be converting the mechanics in those other system
adventures into MT Tasks before you start play?

These are both during character generation, not *in play*, I don\'t
think the number of skill levels decrease if INT or EDU decrease
while playing the game.  And while they *are* used in CharGen,
enlistment rolls as you mention, I\'ve often wondered why not make
all of CharGen Task based too.  Then you would roll an Enlistment
Task. Something like...

  To Enlist in the Army.
  Routine. Dex, End.

>or the Strength modifier used in the Broadsword weapon.

I\'ll give you that one, *but* it just says you halve pen (or is it
dam) if STR is less than 10.  That sentance could just as easily
have said "if STR/5 is less than 2", couldn\'t it?  Or if STR only
ranged from 0 to 4, just "if STR < 2."

Yes, secondary stats that are calculated during character
generation, not during play.  Or do you modify them if the
characteristics change due to wounds or injury?  Do the rules say
you are supposed to?

I know I\'m being picky here, but it seems to me that the 2d6
characteristic could easily be dumped entirely.  It seems that it
is really only there because "it\'s always been there."  

A lot of us think that using a whole 2d6, plus up to 3 more, (2 to
15) like in TNE and T4 gives the Characteristic too much weight.  A
lot of us think a smaller range of values, say 0 to 3, 4, 5
(whatever) works better.  The folks that designed MT, obviously
thought Characteristics should *normally* be used as if they were 0
to 3.

Why is it that Characteristics couldn\'t simply *be* some smaller
range of values that are used throughout character generation *and*
play?  As much as I don\'t like the d3, why not just roll 2d3-2 for
the Characteristic and be done with it?

While I do not own TNE, I do have the most recent version of T:2K (ver
2.2), which uses the same skill resolution system.  Under T:2K 2.2
rules, a Veteran NPC will have assets in his/her/its (hereafter h/h/i)
field of specialization of 13 (plus or minus ref fudging).  This means
that the NPC will usually succeed on tasks of Average difficulty (since
a natural 20 is always a failure, success is not guaranteed), often
succeed on Difficult tasks (asset straight up gives a 65% chance of
success), etc.  Since most tasks faced by PCs are rated as Difficult or
higher, this seems appropriate for a PC in h/h/i fields of expertise.

With T4, the situation is similar.  A veteran NPC should have an asset
in h/h/i fields of expertise of 10 or 11 (attribute of 7, plus skill
level 3 or 4).  An Average task is a 2.5D roll (average of 10.5 roll),
thus leading to very near a 50% chance of success on an Average task (T4
apparently assumes that most tasks are no worse than Average in
difficulty, as opposed to TNE\'s assumption that most tasks are Difficult
or higher).

Frankly, I don\'t believe that these rolls give too much weight to
attributes.  After all, in T4, finding a skill level of 4 or higher is
fairly rare (assuming that one does not allow total choice of skills
gained during a given turn).

Of course, YMMV, as may YTU.

Because MT and T4 both have tried to keep the 1-15 scale found in CT. 
This requires that attributes are arranged on a 1-15 scale (to remain
recognizable from CT), and limits the possible level of standardization.

The most obvious reason is backwards compatability, \'tho admittedly that 
could be dodged with a small paragraph somewhere in the rulebook.

Other than than, my non-mathematically-inclined intuition tells me that 2D6 
generates a nice bell-curve, something that smaller-range systems might not 
do as well. 2D3-2 would work for this, I suppose, except ...

Last, but not least, D3\'s are stupid and I will never use any system that 
requires me to use them except on Very Rare occasions (of which character 
generation is not).  This point is non-negotiable.

Let\'s talk PC\'s...average Attribute is 6 (2d6-1) and ranges from 1
to 13.  In my experience the number of skill levels, even in a
specialty, isn\'t more than 5 or 6.

Ok, we\'ve got 13, but is that 12+1 or 7+6?  I contend that 12+1 is
unbalanced toward the Attribute.  Being unbalanced this way means
that asset could, during Character Generation turn into 12+6=18, and
the Attribute part is *still* 2/3\'s of the asset.

Here\'s what I mean by too much emphasis on Attribute.

TNE
Joe Generio, highly experienced pilot:  Attrib = 6, Medical = 6,
asset of 12

Barb Beginner, beginning pilot:  Attribute 11, Medical = 1, asset of
12

IMO, it\'s not reasonable for a very experienced MD to have the same
odds as the "brash young med student."  I know everyone doesn\'t
agree, but I think experience and skill should count for more.  The
same thing happens with T4, particularly with Education based
skills.

MT
Joe Generio, highly experienced pilot:  Attrib = (7/5), Medic = 3,
2d6+4 (average 11)

Barb Beginner, beginning pilot:  Attrib = (12/5), Medic = 1, 2d6+3
(avg 10)

IMO, this is better.  The more experienced, PC has better odds, not
a lot better, but better.

See, what I\'m talking about isn\'t the quantity of the asset...it\'s
how it is composed.

Yes, but you\'re making my point.  ;-> If the *highest* skill level
you are likely to see is 4, and the *average* Attribute is 7 then
the Attribute has almost twice as weight in the roll as the Skill.

I don\'t expect to convince anyone about this.  This is an old
argument, it ranks right up there with all the others we\'ve been
joking about,  ;-> so, I\'m not going to give anyone a strenuous
debate about it.  It just struck me as interesting that MT ends up
weighting the Characteristic as 0 to 3 after that /5 and the Skills
as 0 to 3 (or so), which I like, and wondered why not just set the
Characteristic to 0 to 3 (or so) and be done with it.

 Whoo hoo!  This is the best news I\'ve heard yet about T5; I hope it\'s 
true.  Now that it\'s safely out of print, I\'d like to say this out in the 
open:  T4\'s game mechanics SUCKED!  They were absolutely god-awful terrible 
and even before the game was out of print I had abandoned them completely.  
The thought that T5 was going to keep this basic framework, no matter how 
modified, made me seriously skeptical about the system.  Now that I know 
there\'s at least a chance that Marc is going to do the right thing and drop 
that turkey I\'ll allow myself to become a little enthused.  I\'d really like 
a Traveller game system that I can actually use right out of the box 
without having to re-write significant portions of it.

<grin> Folks that have been here for a while probably remember me
being one of the biggest opponents of the d3 around here so I was,
at least, half joking.  So, I\'m not tied to d3s, it could even be a
distribution system like, "Roll 3d6 and distribute the points among
the 6 Attributes with a maximum of 6 in any Attribute."

What I\'m more interested in is that the Characteristic range and the
Skill range be about the same.  Boosting the Skill range to 0 to 15
to match the Attribute of 1 to 15 is likely to be more of a problem
than going the other direction.

So, generate the Characteristic with a...
 
2d6/5 if Skills will range from 0 to 4, 
2d6/3 if Skills will range from 0 to 6,
2d6/2 if Skills will range from 0 to 8

...and let *that* be the Characteristic.  Use *that* number in all
other calculation.

Well, like I wrote to Blackice, this debate can go around and round
generating a lot of heat, but very little light...just like those
others we\'ve been joking about, so maybe it\'s better not to pursue
it any further.

This puts another nail in the coffin of Zeta 2 (the world from G:T

	Unless we postulate that Zeta 2 is unusually low in oxygen content.

They therefore make useful trace components for exotic, corrosive or
insidious atmospheres, produced by local biology or geology. Optionally,
they represent hazardous materials that could be encountered by
speculative traders or other adventurers.

Makes for an interesting bit of chrome, doesn\'t it?

On Earth, hemerythrin is present in the blood of all sipunculid worms,
some polychaetes and a brachiopod (Lingula sp.) It\'s about three times

 This brings to mind an old Marathon weapon mod that used exploding Bobs as 
the ammo for the Missile Launcher. The ROF did indeed suck, but the results 
were still spectacular, and the image of high-velocity exploding civilians 
killing Phfor in large quantities is really something...

Oooh Yippee, something I can apply my expensive student loan to...
H. neandertalensis is nowadays (unless everyone has changed their minds
again in the last five years) classed as H. sapiens neanderthalensis,
ie a subspecies of archaic Hom. Sap. 
There is probably a little H.S.N(amongst others) in all of us. H.
Erectus was out of the picture by c 300 ky BP.
Of course, the ancients may have tinkered with the root stock to create
\'modern\' Hom. Sap., and taken some of the modified variety to seed the
stars
(though this argument on the origins of Hom. Sap. would probably not
have been graded to well <g>)

Matt (BA Archaeology)

Is there any genetical evidence? Ok, I guess it could be a little bit
difficult to get that fraggin\' DNA out of those bones but did anybody
try yet...just kiddin\'!
From the molecular biological point of view I have difficulties relying
on classifications based on mere morphological details... for this
could probably mean that H.aspiens neanderthalensis didn\'t become
extinct but "diluted" into the H. sapiens genepool.
Doesn\'t solve my evolutionary adaption problem concerning Geonee and
Vilani, though.
Guess I have to change my canon a bit giving Shiwonee an additional 0.2

I saw "some random TV program" on this a few weeks ago.  It said that there
had been tests done on DNA recovered from Neanderthal remains, looking for
common genes.  Basically their results put neanderthals as more similar to
modern humans than gorillas and chimpanzees, but still different enough to
suggest they were another species.  I\'m not claiming that this is the last
word on the matter, of course.

The other question is, how widespread were neanderthals?  Most of the
remains that have been found seem to have been in Europe, the Middle East
and North Africa, at a time when "humans" were scattered all over the
place.  (I wrote "humans" because I\'m not sure if I meant H. erectus,
archaic H. sapiens or what.)  

Anyway, what kind of "humans" could have been around during the Ancients
period?  I\'m a little vague on this stuff.  What would you have found in
different areas, like, say, Africa, India, China, Europe, etc.  As far as
I\'m aware no traces have been found of human occupation of Australia/New
Guinea (a single landmass at this time) this far back.  What about the
Americas?

The other thing that intrigues me is the "popular culture" representations
of prehistoric humans.  "Cavemen", of course, really only existed in
certain climates, while most "stone age", pre-agricultural modern humans
lived quite differently.

Canonically they do, and they tend to lean towards dramatic,
brightly-colored items.  It\'s never made much sense to me that they
would wear clothes in the temperatures they\'re used to.  Their fur
should be enough insulation for comfort, and the fur itself gives lots
of opportunities for decoration with bright objects or dyes.

Don\'t you kids today study any history?  Didi-mau is Vietnamese for "run
away fast" or something to that effect.  A prize crew is the crew sent
from the capturing ship to the captured vessel (the prize) to bring it
back to a friendly port.  (The prize crew is to be distinguished from
the boarding party.  The boarding party\'s job is to take the ship from
its crew.  The prize crew takes the ship home.  There may be overlap
between the members of the boarding party and the prize crew.  Surviving
members of the captured vessel\'s crew may or may not be pressed into the
service of the prize crew.)

Wonderful.  I heard of a local teenager who called himself Sir <something or
other>, derived from his AD&D game character, until his friends got sick of
it (his title) and refused to play along.

I too know B&D, S&M (referred to in the scene as the catch-all "BDSM")
"players," but very few of these people are RPG\'ers.  Just the number of
Goths using that title from gaming back-grounds got me curious... and yes, I
also found many Goths into the BDSM scene in Brisbane, so perhaps there is a
crossover?

    I would have to say that not all BDSMers are into Goth, but alot of them
are into RPGs.  At least that is how it seems from a couple of gamming
groups I am in.  *weg*  And, before you ask, yes, I am in to BDSM, as a Dom,
Amber, my wife, is a sub.
    BDSM is not just a modern fad, but something that has been going on for
a while.  And, as for many of the Goths into BDSM, they are not safe & sane,
as I have seen a couple tie up their subs with barbed wire.  Now, that is
not safe, as it can draw blood & leave marks, or sane, as who really wants
to be tied up with barbed wire.
    And, if you think I have said too much, ignore this post.

In general, a qualified yes to both parts...

The GT setting is close to the CT and MT settings, but has many subtle and
sometimes quite profound (yet still subtle) differences. Some good stuf
(Especially GT:FT) if you want to do rules conversions (FT needs little
conversion, just the task difficulties for the various rolls).

But, for the most part, if you have CT and/or MT, much will be elaborations
and interpretations of what you have.
<IMHO Mode=true>
And, it would seem, a notatable fraction of us disagree with various parts
of the GT Interpretation... so be warned... it is a wonderful
interpretation, I just disagree with MUCH of it, and others varying
ammounts.

Actually, all electric alternating current is "Metal vibration", or more
accurately, vibration of electrons through a medium... at high enough rf
induced current into a non-grounded object, you can get physical
vibrations, by a combination of energy induced heating, magnetism,
myoelasticism, and other effects I don\'t recall the mechanics nor names of.
It is kind of odd to walk by a radio tower and hear the station coming
through on one\'s orthodontic mouthpiece... AM works, FM didn\'t.  RF induces
electron motion. literally motin within the metal. An imprecisce term, mea
culpa, but accurate (if easily misunderstood and overly literal).

You forgot Cannibilani vs Vegibilani... Were/Are vilani canibalistic, if
so, how much, and whas it ritual only or as a means of recovery of rare

and since it is canon that the vilani were deposited on vland by the
anchients, how much did the anchients do to provide such traces in local
critters?

The lagrange points are basically  laid out like so

     2
   4 M 5
     1
     P

     3

basic rule of thumb for orbits: the further out, the slower your speed for
stable orbit. the further in, the faster your orbital velocity for stable
orbit.

L1: would orbit in less time, generally, but is slowed by the moon\'s gravity.
	The slower orbital  velocity also means reduced centrifugal forces,
countered by the moon\'s gravity.
L2: would take longer to orbit, but is held in place by the combined
centripital  gravitational forces of the pair, which allowes it the higher
orbital spped to keep the relationship; this point also is "dragged" along
by the moon.
L3: that point where combined centripital forces hold an object by tidal
action. I don\'t QUITE grok why, but it works.
L4/L5: these are on nearly identical orbits to the moon. they are at the
point where the moon\'s gravity is strong enough to hold them to the same
speed. It is my understanding that the leading one is slightly in, and the
trailing slightly out, but I am not positive by any means.

The reason that other locations *don\'t* work is that the orbital periods
and gravity effects will not be constants.

Also note that planet-moon-lagrangePoint relationships correlate to
sun-planet-trojan relationships. IIRC, the numbering there is different.

also, combined gravitational forces tend to pull objects near L1, L2, L4
and L5 into the points.

Also, IIRC, the actual relationship of the L4/5 points in terms of degrees
off is determined by the relationship of mass of the planet and moon, and
their orbital distance.

I may be wrong about this, but I thought I read somewhere that it was
illegal in China to eat dogs (a backwards image thing??), but it is also one
of those laws that is not pursued by the officials/police.

ObTrav:  I\'m assuming that there are many, many such laws on multiple
continents on multiple worlds throughout the galaxy in many TU\'s.  I recall
my players being so damned annoyed that a given law was only prosecuted
against off-worlders and not the locals!  :^)

something like

Ge = Gr/(V^2)
 Ge is Effective G\'s of accelleration
 Gr is G rating for a given power.
 V is velocity (in what units, I\'m not certain.)

Note that the conversion of energy to thrust in T-plates seems a little TOO
efficient...

E=M*(V^2)
Energy = energy
M = Mass
V = Velocity.
again, I don\'t recall exactly which units are used.

But, to accelerate a body to as desired velocity, energy input is:
Ei= (Vd^2) * M *(1/Eff)
Ev= (Vd^2) * M
Ei= energy input
Ev = energy of vehicle after acceleration to Vd
Vd = velocity desired
M = mass
Eff = Efficiency of conversion (expressed as a fraction)
(again, I don\'t know specific units to be used, but I do recall scientific
notation is very useful for these, and they will be the same as above)
eg: Mass 1000, Desired velocity 400, Eff 0.2 (20%)
	Ei=1000*400*400*(1/0.2)
	  =1E3 * 4E2 * 4E2 *(10/2)
	Ei=1.6E8 * 5E0
	Ei=8E8
	Ev=1.6E8

One can get around the lack of "Equal and opposite reaction" by simply
assuming gravitic drives accelerate you by using the existing megamassive
bodies (in relation to the object accellerated) by pushing off their
gravity wells... and the "Equal and opposite reaction" is miniscule
accellerations to the planets, moons, stars, other ships, etc., in the
system. This gives rise to the limit on how far out they will work, and
explains also the basis for the proposed 1000AU  limit on T-plates... they
need a certain minimum gravity well to push off.

Strength is used for determining maximum weight per encumberance level
Int+Edu is used for skill limit.
Soc * Cr250 is minimum expenditures to maintain apparent Soc.
PSR is used as psi-point maximum (MT and CT both use PSR to power
abilities, for the TNE/GT crowds, in a points per use basis, which recovers
slowly.)
above are official

IMTG, I use the following additional ones:
End: number of rounds of melee before fatigue accrues. Number of hours
before respiratory difficulty induced fatigue from one "Step" of atmosphere
difference.
Int: words per combat round while doing other things.
Dex: number of loose items carryable in the hands. Maximum number of
holsters/sheaths/etc one can wear comfortably.
Det (Determination, = End+Int): (stat is official, useage mine) number of
insults before the vargr MUST go for your throat.

And I do base these all upon Current Stats, and the same with all DM\'s. I
make players refigure DM\'s after combat, when the adrenaline (or racial
equivalent) wears off, and they have to figure stat damage anyway.

several reasons:
1) Tradition
2) 1-15 is more expressive than 0-4 for characterization
3) the mods to att is CT/MT CGen are on the 1 skill level = 1 att point.
4) The att/x, with default x=5, allows for EASY tweaking of "Epicallity"...
Att/6 or att/7 for the really "Stats are useless, skill rules all", att/(3
or 4) for the "Space Opera" mode. Att/2 for the starwars mode.

More to the point, photons have momentum but no rest mass.

Photons have energy. For all practical purposes, you can calculate
a mass from E=mc^2 and use this for your calculations, so
momentum = mv = (E/c^2)c = E/c = hf/c (IIRC)

(h is Planck\'s constant, c is the speed of light in vacuum and f is the
 frequency of the photon)

Since the "c" term is constant, if the photon loses momentum it
loses energy and reduces its frequency.

For the solar sail calculation, just use p = E/c for the laser beam and assume
some efficency percentages to determine how powerful your laser is to get
1G or
whatever acceleration.

Hmmm, this must breakdown somewhere or the acceleration is constant for a
constant
energy input...well as the sail goes faster, the photons hitting it are red
shifted
and thus have less momentum but some effect should happen before relativistic
velocities, so please comment if you spot the mistake.

Hey, those two great astronomers (H<??> and Russell) drew up the
HR diagram of stellar evolution, that\'s what everyone thought the data
showed.

However...

Stars begin as a gas cloud (would be bluish, but there\'s no fusion)
collapse into a star whose colour depends on their mass, shine for a
very long (or extremely long) time during which their energy output
(and thus colour) is more or less constant (if anything moving towards
the Blue end) and then when the fuel runs out, expands rapidly to
a red giant and then goes "bang", "pop" or "sigh" depending on mass.

So a yellow dwarf has never been a blue dwarf and will never be a red dwarf.
All become a red giant and some become a white dwarf and then a black dwarf.

I\'m not quite feeling in touch with reality at the moment, so when the
real astronomers on this list stop crying/laughing/observing, they\'ll
probably post a correction.

At least not until the government releases info on the 300,000 year

This is false.  Photons have mass, but no rest mass.  The equations of
special relativity break down for lightspeed, the mass of a massless
particle at lightspeed is 0/0 (a particle with no rest mass can _only_ move
at the speed of light; a particle with rest mass can only move less than c.
A particle with imaginary rest mass can only move faster than c).

Also space is not a vacuum, though close, which from what I\'ve heard means
that light is actually travelling a little slower than c which is the speed
of light in a vacuum.

Who needs a star trigger, just drop a reasonable near-c rock (whoops I said

My contention would be that while it would be theoretically possible to
accelerate a mass to near-C, it would be almost impossible to HIT anything
with it.  You\'ve got a planet hurtling around a star which is hurtling
around the galactic core.  How are you going to hit something like that
with an object that must be constantly accelerated (possibly for years)
before it gets to the desired velocity?

Oh, God, here we go...

Badman

Here we go indeed, if at TL8 we could plot a trajectory for a space probe
(one of the Voyagers actually) so that it comes over the ice cap of Neptune
within 1 second of its planned encounter hitting a rock with the technology
available later - no problem.

After all we Terrans have always been good at hitting things from a
distance, friends, enemies, we don\'t discriminate wel will hit anyone.

Well as I understand planet formation (i.e. dimly) planets beyond the "snow
line" enter a runaway accretion process hence forming gas giants. The "snow
line" is the distance at which water ice can form in a developing system.

>Can a planet orbit two stars and still be in a habitable zone?

Very close together stars, yes.

If the stars are at moderate separation and of vastly different stellar types
then it is possible for a planet to be in two life zones at once. e.g. planet
orbiting a dim M class companion star which in turn is orbiting a bright F class
star. Seasons would be interesting. The eccentricity of the stars orbits would
have to be unusually low for this to happen too.

Where does this put the so called hot gas giants apparently being discovered
in inner orbits? Is there a theory about their formation?

Have you taken a look at the Fuzion rule system?  It\'s a free "generic"
game engine that combines the "best" of the Hero and the Interlock game
engines.

In Fuzion, stats and skills both fall in the same range:
0   = Challenged
1-2 = Everyday
3-4 = Competent
5-6 = Heroic
7-8 = Incredible
9-10= Legendary
11+ = Superheroic

Task resolution is Stat + Skill + 3D6 vs a target difficulty number (or
an opponents Stat + Skill + 3D6 for contested skills).

It\'s not a perfect system, but to me it feels more like Traveller than
GURPS ever will (note: I\'m not trying to insult GURPS here - I do play
GURPS in a modern-day campaign; however, to me, it\'s just too rules-heavy
for Traveller.  And, it\'s not metric....).  I\'m currently writing a 
Traveller plug-in for Fuzion (but, it\'s slow going, due to Real Life (tm)
intruding on my gaming time).

And, Fuzion is free!  You can take a look at it at:

GURPS Traveller mentions a fast-food chain that supposedly has a location
in each and every starport in the Imperium -- and some outside it as well:
Astroburger. Its menu and general style resembles that of a certain chain
found on late 20th-century Terra that is represented by a pair of golden
arches... I of course use it in my own G:T campaign, and the players are
starting to get the idea that Astroburger is everywhere... (latest adventure,
total planetary population is just over 600, and even there, they found an
Astroburger...)

	To drag a real life example into this argument; there was an article in
Time/Newsweek about about a month or so ago describing the modern day
pirates on the south seas around singapore, and how there have been more
than 50 (?) attacks this year alone.  Sorry this is from fading memory.
But is is apparently a serious problem. 
	So to translate this into a Traveller universe we would need: A border
region where the powers that be may argue about who is to patrol where,
a number of low tech systems desperate for modern high tech goods, and a
one or two heavily trafficked ports: Say the spinward main in the
Spinward marches. 
	The other difference is most modern cargo vessels are not armed. So a
group of thugs in a zodiac with a heavy machine gun can capture a full
sized vessel and steal what they want. But the modern vessels are not
armed because the insurance companies will not pay for cargo damaged in

True. One must arbitrarily pick a range for characteristic values. In MT, it\'s
0-15. One could make the argument, as you seem to, that the real range of
characteristics is 0-3, and you\'d be right.

If one simply (and, of course, simple is exactly what it wouldn\'t be) altered
the MT rules so that all characteristics are expressed as a range from 0 to 3,
then everything would be consistent.

On the other hand, I would find it cumbersome to know that, during CharGen, I
got "one-fifth" of a Strength point, bringing it to 1.2. Decimal attribute
values would be the norm with characters.

This means that in tasks, it wouldn\'t be as simple as Skill+Characteristic.
You\'d have to drop the decimal. Am I nitpicking? Probably. However, the only
beef my players have with the MT task system is that a characteristic of 14 is
worth just as much as a characteristic of 10. If these characteristics are
rewritten as 2.8 and 2.0, respectively, the problem remains. The 0.8 is worth
nothing.

As a referee, I prefer to spend my time working on the creative side of
adventures and the TU. The less time I spend rolling up characters and changing
rules, the better. This means that I use Traveller materials from all sorts of
places extensively, especially my collection of CT stuff.

One nice thing about the MT Characteristic range is that my CT Supplements 1, 4,
and 13 port very easily into MT. I can also run my CT adventures without having
to convert their "tasks". 

But that\'s just my opinion. YMMV.

I could be mistaken, but I\'ve never come across a task in MT that a player can
use to see if his character notices something. I\'m not talking about the use of
Recon skill here; characters may nor may not notice ordinary events going on
around them. I usually make people do the Int check (above) for that.

Yes, it\'s a house rule. However, it works very nicely because of the
characteristic range I mentioned.

I disagree. I play that rule hard (IMTU, of course). If a character takes a
temporary or permanent hit to Intelligence (as can happen from Aging Effects or
some combat damage), and if that character is maxed out in skills, then I
require the player to drop skills appropriately.

Similarly, if a player rolls to get a skill using collected ATs, but that new
skill would push the skill total over the limit, then the player has to decide
whether the character gets the skill at all, and if so, which other skill to
lower accordingly.

These happen in play.

You could do this, but you\'d be altering the probabilities of success from the

No, these are generated during play, because the gravity of the world affects
the numbers.

Yes, I modify them if the characteristics change for any reason at all. It seems
logical to me that, if you\'re wounded, you may not be able to jump as high.

Speaking of wounds, changing characteristics to one-fifth their CT value would
require changing the wounding system. For example, my character takes 2 hits.
After the combat session, I apply 2D as two individual hits to my
characteristics (each hit being one die).

Now, if my characteristics range from 0 to 3, I now have to divide my dice by 5
as well, keeping track of fractions. Or multiply my characteristics by 5, apply
the dice, and then divide by 5.

Both ways seem too complicated.

The 2D system for characteristics is definitely a port from CT rules, no
question. Whether or not it should be abandoned is where we disagree.

Personally, I like the 2D system because (unlike the D&D game I play) it gives
you a bell probability curve. The rules aren\'t kidding when they say that the
average character is 777777 at age 18. 

As a player, one knows that the chances of meeting a CCC777 character are
slight, so if there are a lot of those encountered suddenly, then something\'s
up.

Compare that with the flatter probability curve of using 0-3 values.

Hey, it\'s only a game. If "a lot" of people think that, then they can introduce
house rules. I\'m just saying why the MT rules work well IMTU. If they don\'t work
well for somebody else, then that person should use different rules.

Would you like a bucketload of salt with those results? I\'d be _really_
skeptical of someone claiming to get enough intact DNA from Neandertal remains
to do anything that detailed. We have bones that are what, 80,000-40,000 years
old? Not very conducive for DNA preservation, even in the teeth.

Well, this gets into the anthropologically sticky argument between the
\'out-of-Africa\' folk and the \'evolved-everywhere\' folk. One side has it that
successive waves of emigration of human species from Africa displaced earlier
populations. This is butressed by the \'Eve mitochondria\' studies, and the fact
that we are pretty homogenous, genetically, usually markers of a small
population that expanded. 

On the other hand, we have anatomically modern humans appearing all over the
place far _earlier_ than the aforementioned Eve studies can predict, and in
places that were possibly geographically isolated, leading to the theory that
modern humans arose spontaneously from scattered populations of more archaic
populations. 

On the gripping hand, of course, none of the anthropologists involved are
thinking seriously about Ancient, umm, _interference_, which is too bad, as it
_does_ explain things quite neatly.

Human occupation of the western hemisphere is reliably dated to only about
20-30ky ago. There is some highly disputed evidence placing human occupation
of South America back that far which would imply (given the \'got here via the
Bering Straight\' route) that human occupation of North America occurred much
earlier. Still, no one\'s claiming earlier dates than about 70ky ago, well
within the \'modern\' period.

Of course, _all_ of this is sheer speculation because we have, at best, about
15-20 pieces of the 1000 piece puzzle in front of us, and some of the pieces
look like they might be close to fitting, but that\'s about it.

For all we know, there _were_ succesive waves of emigration by human and
human-like species out of Africa...after all we have reliable evidence of H.
erectus out to the in China and Maylasia. In fact we have better fossil
evidence of H. erectus there than we do in Africa, IIRC. Throughout the period
of H. erectus (1.6mya - ~250kya) periodic glaciations occured, surely this
opened land bridges to large areas of the world.

Could they have gotten as far as North America? Quite possibly. Obviously,
though, they didn\'t leave any fossil traces that we have found yet.

When the Ancients arrived on the scene, they found a species of primate that
was clearly sentient, made and used stone tools, was learning to talk, and
most importantly, used fire. That, more than the making of tools, is the key
to humanity\'s evolution. 

We have many examples of tool-making and use in a number of species, other
primates, sea otters, crows, parrots, but the one thing that first
distinguished us (and still does) was the use of fire.

That\'s what got Gramps interested in us. We were so malleable still, but had
made the crucial evolutionary leap that put us on the track to higher
intelligence. Fire needs acute temporal senses (you have to make sure you keep
it going..it runs out of fuel, you need to have more on hand before it runs
out.), significant knowledge of using tools (even the simplest means of making
a fire, banging two rocks together, is surprisingly sophisticated). It take a
lot of sophistication to make the conceptual leap from fire=natural disaster
to fire=tool. There is evidence that H. erectus poulations in China had been
using fire for a _long_ time, meaning it had _first_ been used a lot earlier. 

This implies, to me at least, that despite the differences in brain size, the
greater part of the intellectual development of humans, and likely a lot of
the physical development, too, occured in the H. hablis - H. erectus
transition, and that evolution since then has been to a large extent,
incidental; that H. erectus, genetically, was probably very similar to us. 

The biggest differences between H. erectus and us are height, skull and jaw
structure and brain size. the first two are related to long-term changes in
our diet, the transition from a \'nuts and seeds\' diet to a more varied one,
but primarily based on softer foods. 

Brain size may be related to the exploding use of technology. As more
technology is learned to need finer control, more memory, and a way of passing
information along: speech. This would support the multiple origin theory,
since the same factors were driving the evolution of a widespread species,
it\'s not surprising that what evolved was pretty much the same.

The development of speech probably drove brain size evolution more than
anything else, as well as the transition from the robust jaws of H. erectus to
the far more gracile jaws of modern humans. In fact the development of speech
may have driven our dietary change too. Smaller teeth and jaws make much more
varied speech but a diet of hard seeds and nuts more difficult. We may have
_had_ to invent hunting and farming so we could keep talking to each other ;-)

Any _real_ anthropologist on the list is free, of course to jump in and mangle
this with those inconvienent facts that always seem to wreck my theories :-)

A "mere" thousand km long accelerator operating at around 1 million g
(actually fairly low accel for such things) can boost a projectile up
to around 1% of c in the blink of an eye. 

And from 100 (or was it 1000?) AU it\'s take about 90 days to reach a
planet at 1 AU. Planetary orbits are *very* predictable.

So the mass of a photon is just an artifact of relativistic movement? It
doesn\'t have any mass, but it effects other bodies as if it did?

I found a text talking about solar sails that seems to express this.
http://caliban.physics.utoronto.ca/neufeld/sailing.txt

So does relativistic travel distort space-time to produce this effect?

And if a particle with no rest mass can only move at the speed of light,
then why does light move slower through non-vacuums, and really slow through
Bose-Einstein condensates ?  If photons are truly massless particles, it
would seem impossible to slow down light, unless you could change a photon
from massless to a highly energetic, low mass particle.

Actually, acceleration _is_ constant for constant input (in the case of a solar sail, input isn\'t constant due to redshifting).  You can convert energy into momentum with a conversion constant of c -- but this is a \'perfect\' reaction engine, not a reactionless effect.

Didi-mau? Ex-squeeze me?

Some of my brothers in the US Army brought "Didi-mau" home with them, they learned it from men who had been to Vietnam, it means something
like "Get out of there". The soldiers learned it so they could yell it at
Vietnamese soldiers and civilians and kept it themselves as a slang term.

A prize crew is a crew placed on a captured ship so you can bring it home
as a prize of war (or a prize of piracy, if there isn\'t a war on). To "prize 
crew" something would be to put a minimum crew aboard a captured
ship so you could send it back to base, or (if you are a pirate) off to
a place where it can be sold.

In the official Traveller universe, it may be hard to find a place where
stolen ships can be sold, due to difficulties in changing or forging useful 
transponder signals. A ship stealing operation needs official
connections (to illegitemately get replacement real transponders), an 
unusual amount of technical expertise (to create fakes of these supposedly
unforgeable transponders), or the ability to get the ships across the
Imperial border and to a neutral (or even semi-hostile) state that
doesn\'t know or doesn\'t care that the ship is stolen from that big,
well-armed Imperium next door.

IMTU, the difficulty of selling a stolen ship is one reason pirates are
likely to steal cargo and valuables but leave the ship behind.

As I understand it, its because light can\'t actually go in a perfectly straight line in a non-vacuum -- a refractor effectively increases the length of the path for electromagnetic radiation.

BTW, from my understanding Vargr don\'t like garish clothes (strobe

Not yet, but Tenalphi/Lunion has a Moon in a decaying orbit that has *just*
reached the Roche Limit.  (This is why a garden planet has no people on it!)

One of the side effects is increased vulcanism.  Ever hear of basaltic

So the light is still travelling at C, but the route it takes causes it to
cross a much shorter linear distance in a given time, effectively making it
appear slower when measured linearly?

From what I read, I thought that Bose-Einstein condensates work by actually
"cooling" the particles and such.  The following link has a good explanation

Sorry, but it isn\'t that simple. Kinetic energy requires a reference
frame. So does momentum. And in any frame you pick (the ship doesn\'t
count because it is *changing* velocity) you\'ll find that the energy
required for a velocity change depends on the velocity you already
have. So it takes *more* energy the faster you go. KE = .5*M*V^2. It\'s
that V-squared that\'s the killer.

Reaction drives get around this by imparting energy to reaction mass,
and having that mass start out at rest with respect to the ship. Thus,
if they\'ve got an exhaust velocity of 1 km/sec, they always pay the
energy cost of accelerating the reaction mass to 1 km/sec, rather than
the cost of accelerating the ship from 1 km/sec to 2 km/sec (2^2 - 1^2
= 3) or the cost of accelerating from 2 km/sec to 3 km/sec (3^2 - 2^2 =
5).

It depends on just *how* efficient your drive is. The higher the Isp,
the less fuel you need to achieve the same total velocity change.

The problem is that because theuy don\'t use reaction mass, T=Plates
*have* to "create" the ships kinetic energy by pushing or pulling on
*something*. That gives you a reference frame to "balance" the enery in.

Alas, it also means that it takes *four* times as much energy to go
from 1 km/sec to 2 km/sec as it does to go from 0 to 1 km/sec. 

In short, the energy budget is exponential with velocity. I can dig out
the equations we worked out for distance and velocity based on a given
time at a constant *energy* expenditure.

It might be practical for getting to/from jump points. But you\'d be
sitting ducks for anyone with a decent reaction drive.

S\'Truth!  Younger, less developed races have trouble processing the dashing

Well, the T4.1 / T5 playtest draft I have seems to be very much a fixed and
updated T4.

I disagree with your opinion on T4; I believe the execution was flawed,
rather than the concept. The manuals were badly playtested, poorly laid out
but it did have the distinction of having one of the fastest and most
effective combat systems in a Traveller game, plus a skill system that
works with the T4.1 fixes (which are actually on the T4 refs screen).

The main work Marc has issued seems to be revisions to skills, character
generation and some concepts for expanding combat. He may of course have
been using a small top secret group to try another complete system, but I
got the impression that the evolution route was the way it was going.

You will note the fuel requirement.  If you convert a ton of hydrogen into energy, you can get one ton-year of thrust.  This is a simple reaction engine which happens to have lightspeed exhaust.

This is one of the ones that stuck in the Army.  Soldiers who weren\'t born

That is a wad of good points. Yes, I think piracy would be difficult when
deep inside the "mature" 3I, or any other polity with a decent fleet. And
piracy is likely a sporadic affair even at the edges. And I have not read
any canon indicating privateering is at all sponsered by any polity other
than perhaps the Doggy Domains. Which I believe is a very fitting contrast
between uplifted predator/chasers and omnivore hunter/gatherers like
humaniti. And I doubt that this would be the main source of income for
anyone. Ethically challenged merchants indeed, and perhaps even a merc
company that chances on a juicy target, or even a Naval Patrol.

I\'ll have to agree and disagree here.  I think T4 had some of the best ideas for
Traveller yet...but like Dom says, the execution was poor.  The good ideas were
not well thought out, and the playtesters should have been shot.

On the other hand, T4.1 (or T5 as some say), is just a patch for a system with
bugs.  Marc\'s fixes seemed like fixes to me, and it made me angry that he was
intent on publishing more shoddy work when he could really put the time into it
and come up with a fantastic system.

So, like Trent, I was never that excited about T4.1/T5.

Bottom line is:  I\'d like to see the fantasitc universe that Traveller has be
coupled with a mechanics system that is just as fantastic (and accepted as
playable by veteran role players right out of the box).

As I look at the systems for my next campaign, I\'m leaning towards Classic
Trav...although the system is a bit outdated (naturally) without a task system.

I just want something easy, playable, and something that won\'t take a lot of
time away from the game to Gamemaster.

I\'m currently designing the "Running Chef" class 10 dton ship\'s boat,
and I need some input.

Would gut truck food be considered Normal or Meager rations?  While they
seem to fall in the Meager category, I would think that they would have
to be better than combat rations, or they wouldn\'t sell.  That leaves me
as either defining them as Meager, with combat rations being equivalent
to Emergency rations; or defining combat rations as Meager, and roach
coach food being Normal rations.

I\'m leaning toward the first option.... :-P

Photons have *zero* rest mass. And they *always* travel at c. But they
also have *momentum* that is proportional to the wavelength of the
photon. The two are linked via Planck\'s constant. 

And the sail gets *twice* the momentum of each photon. That\'s because
it doesn\'t *absorb* them (which would give it the just the momentum),
it *reflects* them. 

You start with a sail with momentum X and an incoming photon with
momentum Y. You end with the photon heading in the opposite direction
(ideal case) and with the same momentum *but in the opposite
direction*. That makes the photon\'s *new* momentum -Y. And obviously,
the difference bettwen +Y and -Y (2Y) must have been deposited in the
sail if things are going to balance. So the sail winds up with X+2Y.

Photonic "pressure" is due to thier momentum.

The trick has to do with division by zero. 

I won\'t go into the full argument, but suffice it to say that 0 divided
by 0 can be argued as allowing *any* value as an answer. That\'s *why*
the operation is "indeterminate".

"current mass" = "rest mass"/tau

At c, tau is equal to zero. And the "rest mass" of photons is zero. QED.

Or to put it another way:

"current mass" * tau = "rest mass"

"current mass" * 0 = 0

Therefore *any* value of "current mass" is perfectly legal.

Heck, go for it!

As I recall, hemerythin based blood is pale pink in one oxidation
state. But I can\'t recall which, nor what color the other state is. And
we *do* need to know. After all, we have to be able to tell the players
what color(s) the natives bleed.

You won\'t have to convince me. I have had the same thoughts, and for more
systems than Trav. The Storyteller system, AD&D NWP\'s, Twilight 2K, etc. I
don\'t think the best solution is to shrink the range though. As I said in an
earlier post, I think that some skills may favor attributes, even to that
degree, and others may stress training even more than your solution. Though
not by much, your solution relies heavily on the training.

I think I\'ll fiddle some numbers today, see if I can do a CT patch for this.
I had a rough one for Storyteller somewhere, but it relied on die rolling
conventions not covered in CT.

Nope. Stars do *not* evolve that way. I don\'t have any of my textbooks
handy, so I can only describe things roughly. 

A star *does* tend to move somewhat on the H-R diagram\'s "color" axis
as it moves into the "main sequence". But not that much. 

Starts start out "black" and and as they heat up, they\'d move from
class M on up *towards* Blue. but only the largest ever get there. Most
never even get out of M. 

This is at first from mere heat of compression as the gas cloud
contracts. At some point fusion begins and the star will expand back
out from photon pressure. It\'ll brighten and move up the scale some as
it settles down towards its eventual position on the "main sequence".

This position is determined *solely* by mass. The more massive, the
hotter (and "bluer") the star.

Eventually, it\'ll run out of hydrogen in the core. G\\For the lowest
mass stars, that\'s the end. They\'ll brighten for a bit from
compression heating as they contract. And eventually, they\'ll be a
small "white dwarf", cooling slowly over trillions of years.

As I recall, the universe hasn\'t existed long enough for any of these
stars to run ourt of hydrogen. Remember, low mass stars burn their fuel
more slowly.

Somewhat more massive stars will collapse like this, but in the
process, the core will get hot and dense enough to fuse helium. And
likely also start some hydrogen fusion in layers above *that*. This
causes the outer layers of the start to ballon *way* out. So much so
that the star, regardless of its former class is now "red". A "Red
giant". 

Eventually the helium will run out. And we get another collapse in the
core. If the star is massive enough, this will start fusing some other
element (oxygen?), and likewise trigger helium fusion and ydrogen
fusion in "shells" farther out from the core.

If the star isn\'t massive enough, it collapses into a white dwarf. 

For increasing stellar masses, the scenario repeats, with heavier and
heavier elements bein fused in the core. Until you get a star that has
iron as the next available "fuel". 

Iron (Fe56) can only be fused (or fissioned!) with *great* dificulty.
And worse, doing so *uses* energy, rather than produces it. So, instead
of the new reactions acting as a spring to cushion the collapse, they
*accelerate* the collapse by tying up energy in producing heavier
elements. This probably produces the "neutrino flash" that precedes the
supernova explosion by many minutes.

So we get a *rapid*, complete core collapse. Possibly down *past*
degenerate matter. And then the layers just above the core, which still
contain fusible elements impact on the new "solid" core. And the heat
and pressure fuses the elements in big buurst. But there\'s still more
matter falling in, with *enormous* inertia. Eventually, enough pressure
builds to overcome the inertia of the infalling material, and the
overlying layers are blasted away from the core and into interstellar
space. On the way they pretty much wipe out anything else in the
system. 

And the core either cools into a white dwarf, or, if massive enough,
becomes a neutron star. Or maybe even a black hole.

> The stars initial mass will determine how quickly this occurs, and has a
> great bearing on weather the end star product is a black hole, nuetron star,
> or brown dwarf.

Actually, the end points are (in order of starting masss of star):

1. black hole
2. neutron star
3. white dwarf
4. "black" dwarf

Brown dwarves are bodies that were never massive enough to *start*
fusion. A "black dwarf" is a white dwarf that has finally radiated away
all it\'s remaining thermal energy. Which will take some trillions of
years.

Ugh.  Don\'t walk, but run away from Games of Berkeley.

Get a car, bus or taxi to take you to Ian\'s Games in Vallejo.  Ian\'s has
the best game store in N. California that I have been able to find.
Regular 15-20% discount off of _everything_, huge RPG stock, very friendly
and knowledgeable owner, nothing is shrinkwrapped (#$@)%(*#@$% Gamescape!)
and has quite a bit of out of print material.  He also has an weekly email
reminder letting you know what new products have arrived.  The _only_
drawback is that he is only open a few days a week.  Call and find out the
hours.  You won\'t regret it.

That was my thought, beads & bones & bits o\' ribbon. Other than armor, I
would imagine they would avoid excessive clothing. Anybody with body hair
knows that fabric friction can cause ingrown hairs, itchy skin, etc. I
always get this on the tops of my legs were the denim from my jeans chaffs.

Actually, contrary to popular belief, canids are _not_ color-blind at
all. They have fewer cones, so their color perception is muted, hence
the generally brighter colors in the Vargr palette, but they defintiely
see and distinguish colors.

Human-chosen colors must be drab and almost monochromatic to a Vargr.

Hmmm, my friends were more into my title than I was. I guess they liked the

culture might not think was my problem. Come to think of it, I forgot a

Many crossovers. This is why it is silly for "spokespeople" to say they
speak for such & such group. Generalizations are just that. And you might be
surprised how many RPGers are into B, D, S, and/or M. Though they may not be
a large portion of the Travellers. I imagine AD&D, Paranoia, Storyteller,
etc. would be more in that area.

ObTrav: What "scenes" are in the 3I, SW, etc.? I suppose the Z. Cons. have
none of that, and the Aslan may find the idea quite alien.

Hey! As a former "dependent" I resent these slurs. 

Of course, my experience was limited to the facilities at Fairchild AFB
in the 60s and early 70s. And this was as "dependents of retired
personnel". So we lived in Spokane, but visited the base to get stuff
cheap. 

The food in the cafeteria in the back of the exchange was pretty good.
We *really* kicked ourselves when, after watching a movie at the base
theater and commenting on "Darn, it\'s to late to hit the exchange for a
snack" someone piped up and told us there was a small 24 hr snack bar
down on the flight line.  It turned out to be pretty good. And we\'d
been ignorant of its existence for years. <sigh>

OBTrav: visiting the port facilities to get a stuff that\'s either too
expensive or just plain nort available locally can have it\'s drawbacks
if it\'s a military facility. 

Things like getting caught in an unscheduled alert. Or wishing you had
hearing protection as they test the main engines of some of the "ready"
vehicles on the flight line. Which is only a mile or so from the BX &
Commissary. Trust me, if they are even "merely" as loud as B-52s a mile
is only enough distance to prevent *immediate* hearing damage. You sure
as hell can\'t talk until you get inside the well sound-proofed
buildings. 

And then there\'s the slight miscalculation of dropping in on a supply
run on payday. And watching as the "real" dependents (ie the ones for
active duty personnel) try to buy a month\'s worth of food all at once!

Not so minor detail. With space based telescopes, *amateur* astronomers
will be not only detecting gas giants, but likely plotting orbits of
even Earth sized worlds from 10-20 parsecs.

The only reason that stars a single parsec outside the "borders"
aren\'t mapped to the point of having most planetary sizes and orbits
plotted correctly will be if the astronomers in the 3-5 parsec radius
of them *inside( the borders were complete and total incompetents.

The proper thing for those scouts to be sent off to do is deploy
large, flimsy dish antennas (at least a hundred meters or more across)
to listen for evidence of civilization in the systems.. 

"Jumping blind" isn\'t going to happen anywhere *near* a star with space
based observatories.

Certainly, that\'s what we do in sonar. If you make all the terms in
decibels, then it becomes a simple sum to determine whether or not the
signal should get detected. Should work fine for RF. Better, in fact,
because the environment doesn\'t affect RF as much as sonar.

I was hoping that the request wasn\'t literal. Maybe I should rephrase:
Given the same transmitter, some receivers will be able to pick up the
signal further away than others.

The trouble is, the original poster was probably after correct
information. Given the `generic 10km\' transmitter; I could probably
knock up a receiver able to pick up the signal from across the car park;
but with 0.0% chance of getting usable reception at 10km. Conversely,
the sneaky-beakies at Cheltenham will be able to build a receiver that
will sense the same signal at orbital ranges.

A better simple answer is: Matched receivers and transmitters achieve
the range listed in the rulebooks; a receiver you build out of simple
spares will not achieve that range; a highly sophisticated receiver will
exceed that range.

We won\'t even start on `on the same frequency\'; which ignores modulation
types and coding.

Are you telling me that the cruddy little handset Tx/Rx units you can
buy are going to get a signal through a hill? We\'ve already had one
poster with experience of the US Army\'s set (PRC-77, IIRC) which drops
out if you go into a fold in the ground.

In the meantime, the enemy COMSEC team with it\'s neutrino sensor and

I agree.  Although, perversely, I am fond of the hotdogs some roach coaches
serve, they are in fact dangerous to health and sanity.  (Ouch, this
conversation is making me hungry.  I want something really disgusting and
overprocessed.  That is scary!)

I\'ve got some of the workup for a human minor race, but then I
made the "mistake" of asking for permission to finish it off and
share it - which was denied, more\'s the pity (but I _do_
understand why). So, while I haven\'t discarded my work, it\'s been

Well the Hitler ^h^h^h^h^h History Channel is showing a program about
our Neanderthal cousins tonight (12 Aug 99), at 8:00 and 12:00 PM EDST. 
Those who are interested in this topic may want to watch.

Hey, in 6 1/2 years at Ft. Bragg, I\'ve eaten my share of gut truck
food.  It\'s _still_ better than MREs.  If I classify roach coach food as
Deadly, then I have to classify field rations as "Lethal within 20
meters", and, while that sums up the _attitude_ troops have toward MREs,
it is not technically (completely) accurate.

I think that, based on a re-reading of FF&S2, I\'ll go with combat
rations being Emergency quality, and AAFES gut truck food being Meager
rations.  (Any deficiencies in the entrees is offset by the sale of
pogey-bait.)

I have drill this weekend, but I\'ll be posting the AAFES starship and
"Running Chef" ship\'s launch early next week.  My premise for this
design is that an AAFES starship is designed to provide shoppette and
roach coach service for a division, leading to a requirement for 3
shoppette modular cutters, and 9 "Running Chefs", give or take a
couple.  As a quasi-military auxiliary ship, the AAFES starship is
lightly armed, but unarmored.

Noted -- I\'m the author/compiler.

Actually, I think of GT: Starships as more like Traders and Gunboats, with
some Book 2/High Guard stuff thrown in. SOM is Forbidden Canon for GT
authors, but I\'m trying to cover some of the same ground from GDW sources.

The book isn\'t due out until next year, but (new job permitting) I intend
to submit the draft well in advance, to allow plenty of time for playtesting.

I agree. I found the core T4 system to be excellant. My biggest grip was
always the skills vs stats argument, but that seems to have been fixed
with the "Its Harder Than I Thought" (IHTIT) rule. With the IHTIT rule, the
system works wonderfully. For me T4 was able to recapture the simplicity
of CT and add in the smooth playability of MT.

Where T4 always fell down was in production and Travellers traditional
competing design systems. Hopefully with IG out of the picture and
adequate production checking this should not be a problem. I for one
really hope T5 is a product improved T4.

And BTW, I\'ve found that with a little work, the playtest versions of T5
mechanics do work well as a generic system. I\'ve managed to produce
a T5 magic system (as yet untested) for fantasy games and the
mechanics also worked well in a modern conspiracy game I ran.

From Ouzo:
The key question is how fast the stripes move in your tartan.  More than
about 30 cm per Imperial standard hour is pretentious.  Of all the tartans
available, I prefer the Imperial Vargr Marine Tartan, whose predominant
colour is maroon.  Of course, it is inappropriate to wear green headgear
with that, unless you are a Commando veteran.

...and that darn d3 at Difficult?  So, shoot me!  Having that *1* d3
in the task system just twists my shorts.

BTW, would you review the IHTIT rule for me?  I remember the
discussion starting, heck I remember being involved in it, but I
think I missed the final result due to internet static.

I guess, I\'m one of the weird people that liked the concept of
adding 1 more die for each level of difficulty.  I even made myself
several d3\'s, and though I didn\'t *like* them, I was prepared to use
them.  However...

  1.5 Easy
  2.0 Average,
  2.5 Difficult
  3.0 Formidable
  3.5 Staggering
  4.0 Impossible

...made Formidable tasks easy and Impossible tasks anything *but*
impossible for a lot of PC\'s !  <sigh>

The last I saw Marc\'s revision for T4.1/T5 was...

 1   Easy
 2   Average
 2.5 Difficult
 3   Formidable
 4   Staggering
 5   Impossible
 ?6? Hopeless  (I can\'t remember if Marc added this one or not)

...darn that lonely d3. It\'s just *so*...jarring, inelegant <sigh>

Combat-wise, I would have liked the stats to be more GURPS like, as
in 2d+2, and on the same scale from personal to ship, but it did
work and it wasn\'t overly complicated.

Technical Skills being Medicine, Melee Cbt., etc., Common (I don\'t like the

Whern I speak of game mechanics I\'m talking four things: 1) character 
generation, 2) task resolution, 3) personal combat, 4) vehicle (in this 
case space) combat.
	The T4 character generation system I rather liked, as it made 
characters from various careers more balanced skill-wise than CT/MT.  Plus, 
I know that this is one of the areas Marc has put a lot of effort into, so 
I\'m confident it will be good in T5.  
	The T4 task resolution system I hated.  The UTF as per the Ref Screen 
I like (simplified MT), and it is the basis of the format I currently use, 
but the actual mechanics I always hated, and still do.  I think it is too 
heavily weighted in favor of attributes (someone else mentioned the "It\'s 
Harder Than I Thought" rule which I don\'t know -- what is it?).  I hate the 
stupid half-die (especially since it shows up on Difficult Tasks -- the 
most frequent ones!).  Last I knew there was no effective system for 
Spectacular Successes and Failures.  If some variation of this system is 
presented in T5 I won\'t use it -- I\'ll substitute my house system.  
	The Personal Combat system is quick, but I don\'t like some of the 
specifics such as Melee Combat not being an Opposed Task, the Range rule 
(counting range bands to make a + DM), the Autofire rule (it\'s harder to 
hit, but you do more damage -- this doesn\'t feel right to me at all), etc.  
I also don\'t like the fact that the rules are never clearly written out in 
a flowsheet format -- I have to dig through the text to find each rule.  I 
much prefer the AHL system, which I think is just as fast, and as of now 
that\'s what I\'ll continue to use (slightly updated).
	The Space Combat system in T4 was ridiculous, obviously tacked on at 
the last minute, and I doubt anyone out there actually uses it.  And I 
don\'t recall there even being a Vehicle Combat system (possibly in CSC?).

Thus IMO the T4 system comes up drastically short in 3 out of 4 major 
areas.  Presumably at least one of these (Space Combat) will be fixed, but 
that still leaves 2 major systems that I dislike enough that, without major 
changes,  I already know I won\'t use them as written.  What\'s more, I\'ll 
replace them essentially with rules from previous editions of the same 
game.  Does it make sense that as the game system grows and evolves that I 
find it worse and less usable?  The goal of T5 should be to bring everyone 
together under one set of rules, and the way to do this is to create rules 
that are really good from the ground up, not to slap quick-fixes over a 
flawed and unpopular rules system, which will just lead to everyone 
continuing to use their own house rules (and spell doom for the game 
commercially, as well).
	We have to assume that T5 will be the last chance for Traveller as a 
rules system, and if it\'s to stand a chance of success it has to be the 
best possible set of rules -- not only to appeal to fans but to draw new 
interest as well (did Anyone play T4 who wasn\'t already a fan?).  That 
means intuitive rules that work right out of the box and aren\'t going to 
require fixes and revisions for years to come, if ever.  I\'m not sure if 
this is possible (at least while maintaining a semblance of the original 
game), but I am sure that some tweaked revision of the clunky flaw-ridden 
T4 system isn\'t going to cut it.

That\'s the end of my little rant.  I allowed myself to be so strident and 
dramatic because I\'m leaving town tomorrow for about a week, and therefore 
won\'t have to deal with any aftermath of my post.

Later,

Trent

You aren\'t the only one to think that, unfortunately those that
write *official* Traveller systems seem to prefer it to all
alternatives. <g> Personally, I call that level Hopeless.  

>2   Easy

I think that\'s the scale Ken\'s KBv2 used, with the addition of 7 for
Hopeless/Impossible.  There *is* a problem with using whole d6
steps, you know.  It means you have to get an average of 3.5 more
skill levels to step up one Difficulty level, and that\'s awfully
steep with the normal skill ranges in any of the systems.

I actually knew that about brown/black dwarfs

my copy

I meant to post this sometime ago ...

In the UK we have resumed arming civilian shipping to prevent piracy.

The ships in question are intended to transport nuclear waste between
Japan and UK for reprocessing. They have ben fitted with 30mm cannon
so that the company doesn\'t have to pay for a Royal Navy escort.

 Ayup. Now showing in dubbed format on the Food Channel (for those of you 
with Cable Everything), and in its original form on Japanese language 
stations (in the SFBA at least).

I\'m just not sure which way to go with the ship exterior: a "castle" (as the 
show is supposedly in one), or something resembling a Pokeball (hmmm, a 
converted Tigress...)

That\'s my understanding too. The propagation of light through something
other than a perfect vacuum involves each photon interacting with the
atoms in the medium, whilst it\'s interacting, it isn\'t moving at "c".
It still moves at "c" in the periods between interactions.
In Bose Einstein Condensates, I think the photons are almost permanently
interacting.

I was going through my collection and I came apon a little something I
had completely forgotten about. A while back I wrote to Seeker to ask
for a catalogue and a sample. They sent me this :-

	Salurian Industries Orbital Service Module

which was to be included in the Gateway module which got brought out
by DGP and turned into the Mega Traveller Journal 4. The Service
Module never made it to the DGP product.

It\'s a single A4 sheet with deck plans on one side and an original MT
design by Philip Athans on the other.

My question is, has anyone else got one ?

Thanks

Whern I speak of game mechanics I\'m talking four things: 1) character
generation, 2) task resolution, 3) personal combat, 4) vehicle (in this
case space) combat.
	The T4 character generation system I rather liked, as it made
characters from various careers more balanced skill-wise than CT/MT.  Plus,
I know that this is one of the areas Marc has put a lot of effort into, so
I\'m confident it will be good in T5.
	The T4 task resolution system I hated.  The UTF as per the Ref Screen
I like (simplified MT), and it is the basis of the format I currently use,
but the actual mechanics I always hated, and still do.  I think it is too
heavily weighted in favor of attributes (someone else mentioned the "It\'s
Harder Than I Thought" rule which I don\'t know -- what is it?).  I hate the
stupid half-die (especially since it shows up on Difficult Tasks -- the
most frequent ones!).  Last I knew there was no effective system for
Spectacular Successes and Failures.  If some variation of this system is
presented in T5 I won\'t use it -- I\'ll substitute my house system.
	The Personal Combat system is quick, but I don\'t like some of the
specifics such as Melee Combat not being an Opposed Task, the Range rule
(counting range bands to make a + DM), the Autofire rule (it\'s harder to
hit, but you do more damage -- this doesn\'t feel right to me at all), etc.
I also don\'t like the fact that the rules are never clearly written out in
a flowsheet format -- I have to dig through the text to find each rule.  I
much prefer the AHL system, which I think is just as fast, and as of now
that\'s what I\'ll continue to use (slightly updated).
	The Space Combat system in T4 was ridiculous, obviously tacked on at
the last minute, and I doubt anyone out there actually uses it.  And I
don\'t recall there even being a Vehicle Combat system (possibly in CSC?).

Thus IMO the T4 system comes up drastically short in 3 out of 4 major
areas.  Presumably at least one of these (Space Combat) will be fixed, but
that still leaves 2 major systems that I dislike enough that, without major
changes,  I already know I won\'t use them as written.  What\'s more, I\'ll
replace them essentially with rules from previous editions of the same
game.  Does it make sense that as the game system grows and evolves that I
find it worse and less usable?  The goal of T5 should be to bring everyone
together under one set of rules, and the way to do this is to create rules
that are really good from the ground up, not to slap quick-fixes over a
flawed and unpopular rules system, which will just lead to everyone
continuing to use their own house rules (and spell doom for the game
commercially, as well).
	We have to assume that T5 will be the last chance for Traveller as a
rules system, and if it\'s to stand a chance of success it has to be the
best possible set of rules -- not only to appeal to fans but to draw new
interest as well (did Anyone play T4 who wasn\'t already a fan?).  That
means intuitive rules that work right out of the box and aren\'t going to
require fixes and revisions for years to come, if ever.  I\'m not sure if
this is possible (at least while maintaining a semblance of the original
game), but I am sure that some tweaked revision of the clunky flaw-ridden
T4 system isn\'t going to cut it.

That\'s the end of my little rant.  I allowed myself to be so strident and
dramatic because I\'m leaving town tomorrow for about a week, and therefore
won\'t have to deal with any aftermath of my post.

Later,

Trent

Well I\'ve run and played every edition of Traveller up to TNE, then came T4
and in our part of the Universe all the Traveller games came to a crashing
halt. I am now back to running a TNE game. Our group found T4 badly put
together, and rather than being a resurrection of a classic game it seemed
to bring back all the old inconsistancies together with a task system that
made my players ill.

I have looked at GT but don\'t really like the system, and as my TNE game is
set in the Banners sector the information supplied was largely unusable.

Perhaps the new edition Dark Conspiracy could be used as this seems to have
been derived from the old GDW house rules system?

d10 heresy?  Never!  I had some youngsters (okay, I was the oldest in my
20\'s when they were in their late teens - early twenties) in my campaign who
were typical males of the time... whenever there were encounters in bars
with members of the opposite sex, they always needed to know what they
looked like ("Is this chick a babe?"), so what easier way to determine than
with the oldest scale in the world for such things, the old "scale of 1 to
10 with 10 being the best" and what better tool to use than a good old d10?
:^)

However, with the establishment of the scale, it was only fair that they had
such a rating, but who wanted to be fair anyway... it was an NPC rule ;^)

Nope.  I don\'t think you said to much, I appreciate your openness and
honesty on the subject.  It is rather off-topic for this sort of list I
suppose, but I still appreciate the reply, though yours and my info tallies
differently on Goths into BDSM/RPG\'s, but I suspect regional/scene
differences at play here?

ObTrav:  Is there as many references to "late 20th-century Vland" or even
"mid 25th-century Rhylanor" or whatever in all of the T-variations as there
are to "late 20th-century Terra" or even "pre-20th century Terra?"  Just
that I tend to recall things (people/places/locations/equipment) in
adventures/magazines/library data (the scout\'s "poni" springing quickly to
mind) being named or modelled mostly on "late-20th century" Terran
people/places/locations/equipment or even on "pre-20th century" Terran
people/places/locations/equipment.  I do recall some non-Terran references,
but the alleged (remember, I still haven\'t gotten my old stuff back, so I
can\'t confirm) Terran references just seem to out number them??

Okay, I had Pepsi being the favoured taste to non-Terran Imperials in my old
campaign (even created an advertisement flier) which caused it to take off
in the Imperium leaving Coke-Cola in the wayside... but in game, no-one knew
the origin of the drink and most believed (due to it\'s popularity) that it
was a pre-Terran invention.

Did it mention that this stuff releases *airborne* neurotoxins? After
learning the hard way, researchers are now studying it with stronger
precautions than AIDS labs use. Not *quite* up to "Ebola" standards. 

But unlike AIDS, ebola, and other well known "scare" diseases, this
stuff is *hardy*. The spores survive things like 30 minute immersions
in bleach!

The more paranoid part of my mind wantsto know if this is the way
things started in "The War Against the Chtorr"....

Well, considering how some *other* cultures have "channeled" such
desires, the Zho could quite easily have it in their culture. After
all, for one thing they\'d be able to tell the difference between the
sickos and the "normal" freaks. 

I\'m not sure what could be done with the S&M side of things other than
being an odd pastime. But D&S has interesting possibilities in a
telepathic society. Sub-ordinates that you *know* are 100% loyal, and
you also know where their limits are. And if they are telepathic, it
gets even more interesting. 

All the advantages of the typical "brainwashed slave", but with *none*
of the disadvantages. 

For the Aslan, I can see the males channeling things into the
equivalent of the "manhood tests" and the like of various Terran
cultures. 

The Vargr won\'t even notice. After all, their culture pretty much
incorporates a lot of the dominance and submission stuff found in
packs. So anything even *remotely* related would just be considered a
"minor quirk". :-)

I\'ll refrain from mentioning some of the more "interesting" things you
can do with high tech.

Actually, we are just about ready to deploy some drones that will do
this sort of job and *not* be detectable via CG or neutrino emissions.
They are basicly a small solar powered sailplane. 

They don\'t move very fast, but the entire upper surface is solar cells.
They are intended to climb to some ridiculous altitude (50-100k feet?)
and just laze around. They\'ll be so high that they won\'t have dropped
dangerously overnight, and then they can climb back to peak altitude
during the day. 

They should make *excellent platforms for various sorts of passive
sensors, including COM-INT gear. They relay their readings to
satellites or to ground stations. Either way, they are *so* far up that
they can use line of sight signals with little fear of interception. 

Also, due to their very construction, they wind up being *very*
stealthy. Much of the structure is either transparent to radar, absorbs
radar, or just doesn\'t return a decent signal. 

So you deploy a bunch of these over an area and get to listen to
tactical comms in real time.

Much as I hate to say it, the Raw chip described as part of the OXYGEN
project in Scientific American looks like it could make Virus a lot
more plausible. I still don\'t buy most of the methods of infection
given in the rules, but this sort of architecture *could be more easily
subverted than most. 

On the other hand, what system crackers, virus wriers and the like will
do with hardware like this, system security will *have* to get a lot
better. 

OXYGEN looks like a good model to steal for Traveller personal
"computers". I especially like the way the hardware is *so*
generalized, and rather than "configure" it, you "program" it. 

Example: The Handy21 hand unit is a computer, a tv, a radio, a pager, a
cell phone, etc. The receiver stage is essentially a wideband
"scanner". It looks at 10 MHz "slices" of spectrum and you run programs
that extract the relevant signals. 

Can you *imagine* what PCs could *do* with that sort of tech on a low
tech world? Just change the program a little and your "legal to posses"
"cell phone" is monitoring the local miltary and police bands. :-)

I have never understood why some enjoy pain in a situation that is supposed
to be pleasureable.  I myself abhor pain and will go to great lengths to
avoid any.  :)))

Which is why I have absolutely no understanding of the pain thing in sex.
I\'m completely baffled by it.  I lost one girlfriend years ago because I
flatly refused to use a whip on her.  Thought she was dodgy.  :)))

I never really had too much of a problem with the half die. Sure it does
stick out like a sore thumb a bit, AFAIK it really ain\'t that bad.

> BTW, would you review the IHTIT rule for me?  I remember the

The IHTIT rule is neat and simple. If your skill isn\'t equal to the number
of (whole) dice being rolled, then the level of difficulty increases by two.
Thus when your skill 1 dex 15 med student decides to try brain surgery
they all of a sudden find that their lack of skill makes things a whole lot
harder. The only modifier is that JoT can be used to "bump up" a skill
for the purposes of avoiding the IHTIT rule (ie your skill 1, dex 15 med
student can avoid the penalty if they have sufficent JoT skill to bring
their skill up to the requisite level, but you\'re still only skill 1 when
making the roll).

The down side of the IHTIT rule is that it makes the half dice rather
more neccessary (otherwise skill 2 characters get hit on a difficult
task). Still you can get around this by making the IHTIT rule kick in
when the number of dice exceeds skill by more than 1.

However in my games I still use my orignal system. I don\'t rate tasks as
average, difficult, formidable etc, just by the number of dice to be rolled.
Thus a player gets told its a 2d or 2.5d or 3d task etc. And the IHTIT gives
a penalty equal to the number of skill levels short the character is. Thus
a skill 1 character attempting a 5d task gets it bumped up by four levels
(making it a 9d task). Its a little more complex than the T5 version, but
over the two years or so I\'ve been running T4/5, I\'ve found the extra level
of complexity doesn\'t slow play down.

Some say it\'s (endorphins) akin to an addictive drug, I don\'t accept pain
either, so I honestly cannot say... but people *do* get "high" from it,

Not a problem for me: IMTU, T-Plates do conserve momentum (and
obey it\'s corollary, Newton\'s 3rd), by (somehow) exerting an
equal and opposite force through the gravitational field on the
bodies that create it; e.g. planets, & stars. These are so much
more massive that the effect on their motion is negligible. The
drive appears to be reactionless, since it requires no reaction
mass, but there is a reaction that appears elsewhere.

I worked on the problem a little. I can live with a
handwave that T-plates are limited to the designed G or thrust
rating at velocities below 100 km/s*G-rating (unless I dropped a
decimal somewhere) but that they use less power than FFS2 gives 
them. Above that velocity, their power consumption has a constant 
maximum value, but the G or thrust rating is inversely 
proportional to the velocity.

But that only covers *kinetic* energy. Conservation of
gravitational potential energy at constant power requires a
combination of: mass of the body exerting the gravitational force
on the ship, distance from that body, thrust, and rate of ascent.
All these are a bit difficult to calculate on the fly...I thought
of trying to do some tables.

     Well, yes, but there\'s a limit to what even a PEMS-15
Science grade sensor (at 200,000 MCr!) can detect at a range of a 
subsector plus. There was enough competition for observing time
on the UofS big dish that charting systems 20+ parsecs outside
the border had slipped down the priority list. Sylea had fought
naval battles two subsectors away within living memory, and the
new wave of advance recon was expected to be that far in a year
or two. Scouts had operated as far as the neighboring sectors.
     The planned MO for advance Recon missions was to do a quick
first look at a several worlds at a time with craft no larger
than necessary, smaller than was ordinarily used for first survey
work. Each of these would jump into the outsystem of a star and
spend a week: refueling, getting a good system map (all the
planets and major moons), making observations of the surrounding
systems (so the next recon team out that way could go a parsec or
few further), and looking at planets in the life zone from a few
AU or so away to get a rough classification of physical data and
any observable population or TL. It would then go onto the next.
    After the data was returned and analyzed, follow-up survey
missions would take a closer look at anything interesting,
threatening, or close enough to the Federation border.
     The very first missions were intended to work the kinks out
of this new Recon MO, train a new group of scout recruits close
to home, and most of all set up for the follow-up surveys, rather
than find anything that wasn\'t already known.  Cleon hoped for
more, but technical astronomy wasn\'t one of his skill areas: his
scouts knew what to expect that close to home.
    When a gung-ho team of recruits at Sylea decided try using
typical scout mapping gear (PEMS-13) to check out the nearest two
parsecs, they found they couldn\'t detect several gas giants they
*knew* were there. So they checked the published data from the
UofS big dish, and were really shocked. Their instructors
shrugged their findings off as only to be expected, but Cleon
heard about it and made his own inquiries, which resulted in
giving PEMS-13.5 gear to advance Recon craft.
    The idea of bringing observation satellites and leaving them
to look deeper was tried, but within the first year Recon
abandoned the concept as mostly not worth the trouble and
expense. [At least, in my TU it did]

    That would violate S, S, & C.  Hell, I will not punish my subbie when I
have had one beer.  And, if a drug is around that intensifies pain, well
could it not be used for torture?

    Well, remote control vibes are here, but what about a set of remote grav
restraints?  I.e. your subbie is walking along, you hit the remote & she is
spread eagle, floating in mid-air, & you can have your wicked way with her.
    Of what about a collar that tells you the physical condition of your
subbie?  How much pain she is feeling, how much pleasure, that sort of
thing.
    And, what about a computer game based upon BDSM?

Actually...no. It requires more than casual contact with the organism in the
water (not a virus, BTW, but a protozoan... a _big_ difference), as only
people handling the infected, sick fish were getting sick. Also the organism
has to be in just the right stage of it\'s life cycle for it to be infectious,
and it\'s an astonishingly complex life cycles (something like 6 or 8 stages,
IIRC..I can\'t find that issue right now)

OTOH, it points out avenues of research into Alzheimers (and many other
diseases with an unknown cause) that to my knowledge, haven\'t even been
_considered_ let alone investigated. With all our advances in cellular biology
and genetic engineering, basic microbiology has become a sadly neglected
field. If no one\'s looking for these things you\'re not going to find them.

If these guys hadn\'t been good enough to notice the symptoms in themselves,
we\'d still be going along thinking that those few pathogenic protozoa only
cause intestinal woes, like giardia and amebic dysentery.

obTrav: Critters like this can obviously readily infect members of other
species. The people on a newly colonized planet sowly start realizing that
they\'re getting forgetful, irritable, and just feeling run-down. The med
scanners find no evidence of bacterial or viral infection, no obvious
metabolic imbalance stands out, and using filter masks dosn\'t improve matters...

Yep.

A study in the medical journal The Lancet says the microorganism
causes a range of neurological and cognitive problems in humans.
Pfisteria has been responsible for massive fish kills in North Carolina
and the tributaries of Maryland\'s Chesapeake Bay. The authors of
the report studied 24 fishermen, recreational boaters and others who
had been exposed to the Pfisteria toxin during a fish kill on the
Pocomoke River in Maryland.

Not only were the brain scans of the fishermen abnormal, so were the
results of some cognitive tests. 

For example, the fishermen in the study were asked to identify the
colors of type printed in a list of words, while ignoring the words
themselves. They had a harder time with the test than people who had
not been exposed to pfisteria. 

The good news is that three to six months after the fishermen stopped
working in pfisteria-infested waters, their brain functions went back
to normal.

Combine this with the rules for BioWarfare Agents posted on the TML a
couple years back, and you\'ve got nasty, nasty stuff.

Larry Niven had a great device called the tasp.  It\'s a device that
stimulates the pleasure center of the brain -- remotely.  A common game
is to hang out in a public place and tasp random people for a fraction
of a second, but it has other applications, and is quite addictive.  

The precursor to the tasp was the wire.  It was an electrode implanted
in the brain that stimulated the pleasure center.  Addicts were called
wireheads.

were typical males of the time... whenever there were encounters in bars
with members of the opposite sex, they always needed to know what they
looked like ("Is this chick a babe?"), so what easier way to determine than
with the oldest scale in the world for such things, the old "scale of 1 to
10 with 10 being the best" and what better tool to use than a good old d10?
:^)
>
Actually, I used to ask that same question about *male* NPC\'s when I started
playing.  (First of all, Countess Julissa had voracious appetites.  And
second of all, I was a 16-year-old girl.  Some things are universal.)

We used the same scale on NPC\'s of both genders, depending upon who was
asking.  At one point I did have a lesbian character.  No, she wasn\'t an
Aslan.

>However, with the establishment of the scale, it was only fair that they
had such a rating, but who wanted to be fair anyway... it was an NPC rule
;^)
>
As far as PC\'s were concerned, most of us had such a good image of our
character (and not all of us had gorgeous characters) that the ref basically
said we looked like what we said we did.  "Ryder Hook" was ruggedly
handsome, "Ian Cameron" was military-clean-cut cute, the computer guy whose
name I have forgotten was average looking and so forth.  Countess Julissa
was a babe because she was that kind of character (think Emma Peel in
space).  Other female characters I had were rather plainer, because that\'s
the sort of people *they* were.

Of course there was also Gwendi.  Gwendi, the naval officer, who was always
prim and proper and brilliant and true.  Gwendi was our gunner.  I rolled
her up because we needed one.  She got this personality largely because she
never picked up any skills that indicated anything other than that sort of
temperament:  no Streetwise, etc.  We also had one of those character life
events generators and basically nothing very interesting had ever happened
to her.  She ended up being a lot like Misa Hayase/Lisa Hayes in
Macross/Robotech, but that had not come out yet.  This is the kind of girl
that I always loathed when I was in school: the one that was never thought
weird and never rebelled about anything.

The only interesting thing about her seemed to be that she liked to shoot
things.  (This was also the only aspect of my personality that came
through -- I am a lady by Heinlein\'s definition among others, but I am not
very "ladylike".)

I did not know that my ref had a thing about Navy girls and that "nice and
prim and proper" would be so popular.

I got rather bored with Gwendi, but the PC\'s chased her like she was a cat
in heat.  Two PC\'s and the ref\'s favorite NPC were always after her.

I discovered (because I was REALLY bored with playing Miss Goody Two Shoes)
that this character could NOT die.  Finally the only way I got to retire her
was that I let the ref\'s favorite character marry her (they made me role
play the wedding including speaking her vows to this guy) and then get her
pregnant.

Whew!  For some reason, even though I said she was an ordinary-looking girl,
they all gave her a babe rating of 11.

They even gave her a Zhodani identical twin-- Adlikliepr!!!  But I didn\'t
have to play the Zhodani, thank goodness.  I still think that would have
been a plot point better suited to Julissa, who had been a Scout and was an
excellent spy...

Endorphins are a naturally occuring body chemical and the effect is not
addictive.  Addiction occurs because drugs destroy the body\'s ability to
produce endorphins and more and more drugs are needed to maintain a normal
state, let alone the drugged state.  BDSM is not like that-- it\'s more like
a "runner\'s high".

I am not in any way submissive (they call me Mistress Tiamat for a reason)
but I do have some slight masochistic tendencies.

I also have abnormal endorphin production under certain kinds of situations;
the two may be related.  For instance, studies have shown that people who
like to eat hot peppers produce endorphins in response to the pain they
receive from the capsaicin, and those who don\'t like them, don\'t do that.  I
love to eat hot peppers, too, though I don\'t care for jalapenos-- I prefer
serranos or habaneros.  And after surgery, they had to put me on a pain
medication schedule because my blood pressure was rising in response to the
physical trauma of "pain" but I didn\'t *feel* "pain" so I didn\'t ask for any
drugs.

But if I get a toothache, I\'m as miserable as anyone else.

ObTrav:  In the TU, are there designer drugs that create this kind of state
in people?

Possibly even designer drugs that can be slipped to people, like roofies,
that will make them accept and crave and even enjoy pain that not only is
well past their limits but well past safety?  Pain that will basically kill
them while they die with a smile on their face?

Tracing the source of that stuff would be quite an adventure, esp. if you
had a rich Patron whose little sister had died in such a situation...

Not really. You could do like I did. Assuming there\'s a college or
university near you that has Astronomy/Astrophysics courses, ask at the
bookstore to find out what text the "intro" courses are using. If you
get *really* lucky, you\'ll be able to pick up a used text that was sold
back at the end of the term.

My "Intro to Space Science" was invaluable (when I had it handy). I
really should get a newer book. But learning calculus so I can *use*

That\'s something you\'d have to look up, but as I recall, it\'s less than

Again, you\'ll need to look it up. They are theoretical for obvious
reasons. But Sol is in there somewhere. I\'m pretty that everyone agrees
that sol will never get close to being a supernova, but *will* go thru
red giant phase.

One of them is the Chandreshekar(sp) limit. About 1.44 solar masses. I
*think* that\'s the limit for turning into a neutron star. 

Please keep in mind that my references are mostly in storage and I\'m
doing this from *memory* (fortunately, I\'ve got the sort of memory
thast retains the "gist" if not all the details. Very handy for exams)

One of my "back burner" projects for *years* has been a star generation
program that would take a mass as an input and giving you the history
of a star of that mass. 

It\'d wind up as a "subroutine" in a bigger stellar generation program.
The way I look at it is this:

1. pick stellar mass randomly. This requires atable/formula giving "normal
   distribution" for stellar masses. And possibly several tables as it
   may vary according to what part of the galaxy you are in.

2. pick age of star. Again, this needs a table with the proper
   "distribution" function. Also may need a table of how composition of
   initial nebula varies with age. Oldest stars would be virtually 100%
   H/He. Younger stars will have increasing percentages of "metals" (ie
   heavier elements).

3. Use something like Accrete plus a stellar evolution simulator to
   "quickly" create the system from the initial nebula and age it to
   the present. This potentially includes red giant phase, supernovas,
   novas, and even "secondary" planetary system formation after a
   supernova. Yes, they\'ve found strong evidence for the formation of
   new planets from the remenants of a supernova!

4. for the *really* ambitious, you simulate the *galaxy* this way,
   except you don\'t bother with details except for stars that either
   wind up in the map area at the time of the game or passed near stars
   that wound up in it. For example, if a star that wound up in the
   game area had been near a star that went supernova at the time it
   went supernova, that requires special handling.

It\'d take a lot of computer time, even now, but I think the end result
might be worth it. Especially if you have something such as "million
year old remants of an alien base". You\'ll know *what* stars were near
that planet back then. Many will still be nearby. Others won\'t. 

One dodge to speed things up is to to *not* generate the planetary
systems until *after* you\'ve determined which stars are going to be "on
the map". You\'ll still want to generate systems for "distant" stars
that used to be close. Just to see which ones might have had
civilizations that left artifacts. 

And won\'t *that* frost the players once they find the final clue that
tells them that the "Forerunner" artifacts are from a cvilzation that
if it still exists would take *years* of jumps to get to.

According to the SA article, it lives in "brackish water". That pretty
much limits it to estuaries. Lakes are still fairly safe.

Pardon my French, but this is a great fucking rule!

I\'ve pretty much decided to use a CT based game (combat) combined with the MT task system,
so the IHTIT rule won\'t apply to my game.  But, I\'d use it if I was running a T4 game with
the rules as written, or even Marc\'s T4.1 patch.

The IHTIT rule wouldn\'t work well with the KB2.0 task system, but it sure as heck fixes some
of the things that KB2.0 fixes in T4.

As most of you know, my peeve is game mechanics, and I have to applaud whoever came up with
that one.

Sorry for the delay in replying to this but my inbox has be horrendous
lately and I missed it. THe main comment I wanted to throw you way was
in reference to "Forbidden Canon". My understanding of the DGP stuff and
reprints in general was that the ideas and concepts involved were open
game, as long as qoutes and direct wording lifts were nt done. If theis
is wrong, please correct me, or maybe this was just in reference to MM
Traveller material and GURPS has more restricitons. However, if my
interpretation is correct then a new SOP can be written, it just can be
a direct reprint fo the DGP material. Humm, I\'d really like to see this
cleared up since SOP was a neat idea, as was some fo the other DGP
material and it would be BAD (IMHO) to let the CONCEPTS die, \'specially
if we didn\'t have to!

Consider. You\'ve got near absolute loyalty (and you *know* "how
absolute" it is), and someone who is has a brain but is *willingly*
devoting it to what they *know* (assuming both are telepaths) you\'d
want done. 

So you don\'t have "blind obedience", you have *informed* obedience, but
depending on the situation and strength of the "bond" you may still
have the "willing to die for you if necessary" attitude as well. 

That\'s one *powerful* combo.

The K\'kree are another likely case of having D/s be "invisible, simply
because the "herd" culture is so hierarchical to begin with.

No more so that the "classic" SF weapon usually called a "neuronic
whip". Basicly fires a beam that triggers the pain nerves. May have
been invented as a "non-lethal weapon" but quickly banned in most
places due to the *tremendous* abuse potential. 

The "orgasm inducer" could have a similar history. It\'d definitely
*stop* a suspect. But there might be addiction problems. Almost as bad
as a tasp.

Don\'t think of it as "pain" think of it as "strong sensations". Heck,
for some of us there actually *is* a range where you might feel"pain"
but we just feel a "strong sensation". Not necessarily pleasnt or
unpleasant. increase the stimulus further and then it would be painful.

Sort of like itching. It doesn;t necessaily *hurt*. 

Also, if you skirt the edges between "pain/non-pain" you can trick your
body into producing *lots* of endorphins. Which gets you "high". It\'s
*exactly* the same thing as a "runner\'s high". And induce in
practically the same way. By pushing your body to the edge and keeping
it there.

We are just less likely to damage ourselves. :-)

It\'s been done in several stories. In fact, I suggest checking out Elf

possiblities.

There are several. Want some?

ISTR a sci-fi story that used some high-tech psychoactive in conjunction
with VR. Then there is the Draud and Tasp from Niven. Simple Zero-Gee has
always been a fantasy of mine, probably most folks for that matter. No
pinned limbs, no extremities falling asleep from circulatory impediments.

- ----



TRAVELLER     KENNETHS TWEAKS



TWEAK 1:  CAMPAIGNS BASE RULES

CT Rules Set:  The base set of rules for this Traveller campaign is the
CT version.  Items from MT and T4 will be taken to modify the set.
(Very sparingly, a mechanic may be modified from TNE).



TWEAK 2:  COMBAT RULES

CT Combat:  Use CT combat system (except for armor mods).

Combat Rounds:  Use a six second combat round.

Kinetic Energy Rule:  Use the KE rule from pg. 57 of T4.

Marginal Success:  Adapted from pg. 70 of MT.  If a hit is made on exact
count, damage is cut in half (drop fractions).

Exceptional Success:  Use the MT rule from pg. 71.



TWEAK 3:  ARMOR

Armor Value:  Use AVs from the T4 and MT versions.  As in T4, a number
of damage dice equal to the AV is subtracted from the damage dice.  The
amount left over is rolled as damage vs. the character.

Armor Type:  Use the Rigid/Flexible rule from pg. 57 of T4.



TWEAK 4:  HIT LOCATION

Hit Location Chart:  Use the hit location chart on pg. 84 of MTJ4.



TWEAK 5:  MOVEMENT

T4 Movement:  Use the T4 movement definitions starting on pg. 52 of T4.

Range Bands:  Range bands represent 15 meters (not 25 meters), as stated
in MT.



TWEAK 6:  MULTIPLE ACTIONS

Actions:  Each character is allowed to move and act in each round.  (1
action and 1 move action).

Multiple Actions:  Characters may attempt more than one action in a
single round (only one move action is allowed per round), but each
action attempted in the round incurs a penalty.  The more actions that
are attempted, the bigger the penalty to all actions taken during the
round.

+4 penalty to all actions in the round.

Penalty is cumulative for each additional action attempted.



TWEAK 7:  INITIATIVE

Initiative:  Combat will be instantaneous, not simultaneous, and
initiative will be thrown using a T4/Snapshot hybrid.

 1D + End + Dex

Leadership skill modifies the throw for the individual.  Leadership
skill can apply to the entire PC group (as noted on pg. 52 of T4) if the
character with the skill is taking an actual leadership role in the
encounter.



TWEAK 8:  TASK SYSTEM

MT Task System:  When a task system is called for during the game, use
the MT system.

Snake Eyes:  Snake Eyes constitutes a Fumble, as per the MT rules.

Marginal Success:  Success on the task throw by exact count constitutes
a marginal success, as per the MT rules.

Exceptional Success/Failure:  This is covered in the MT task system
rules.



TWEAK 9:  SKILLS

Default Skills:  Default skills, as covered in both MT and CT, are
level-0 skills.  No bonus or penalty applies when using these skills.

No Skill?  Some skills cannot be used without training.  Others can be
used, but used at a penalty.  If (A) a character does not have a skill,
(B) can attempt the skill throw without having the skill, and (C) does
not have a default skill that applies, the character may attempt a throw
on the skill with a penalty.

 -5 penalty on skill attempt



TWEAK 10:  MEDICAL TREATMENT

Medical Treatment:  Follow the rules listed on pg. 32 of TD13.



TWEAK 11:  COMBAT POOLS

T4 Pools:  Use the T4 Tactics, Str, Dex, and End Pools as listed and
modified on pg. 60 of T4.

Hey all,

I know these game mechanics discussions are a never ending topic
\'done-to-death\', but its a subject near and dear to me.  Up \'til lately, it
was merely a theoretical issue for me since I wasn\'t running a Traveller
game.  That and my tendency to lurk vs. post kept me out of such discussions
in the past.  I am currently in serious thought about starting a new Trav
campaign, however.  My last Trav game was over ten years ago.  So I\'m game.
:)

I\'ve seen several different systems from other games mentioned in use on
this list with TUs of some kind.  Remember when GT was just another set of
common enthusiast house rules?  I am putting serious thought to using
Shadowrun (SR3) rules for a M:0 (er, M:20?) campaign.  [Me quickly dons
Rating 9 heresy armor.  :]  There are a lot reasons for this, the primary of
which is that I ran a successful SR campaign for several years with the same
group of players.  Thus, everyone is already comfortable with these rules,
but they have little to no experience with any of the existing Trav rules.

I have barely ever heard mention of SR on this list, but if there is anyone
here who is familiar with this game, I would be interested in any informed
opinions on this idea.  I\'d also like to mention that I think game rules are
largely a matter of taste.  Given any group of players, some rule systems
will be inherently superior to others due to quality design, but I do not
believe in some absolute, global scale of superiority.  One size does not
fit all.

It also seems to me that SR is something of an acquired taste.  I have heard
from some RPGers in general that SR has a cool universe, but they dislike
the mechanics.  (I have heard the same thing said of many games, Traveller
being no exception).  Although we (my players and I) have some house-rules
patches for a few things that really do annoy us, on the whole I find the
basic SR task resolution system to be powerful, flexible, and fairly slick
all around.  I believe 80%-90% of the complexity overhead of Shadowrun (and
it can be quite complex) is created by advanced character development in
cyber/bioware and magic, neither of which will be relevant in MTU.

In relation to the T5 speculation: I would personally be much more
interested in a completely new \'modern\' system that still captured the
general CT feel.  IMHO, this is possible.  My interest in T4.x, or a T5
derived from such, is limited to source ideas for my SR implementation.  For
example, T4 kind of dipped its toes in the shallow end of \'dice pools\' with
the Tactics skill.  SR makes extensive use of dice pools, so the idea of a
Tactics Pool fits right into the existing SR mechanics.

Anyway, if there is any interest on the list for suggestions, criticisms,
questions, or the results of my \'SRT\' implementation, please let me know.

Ordinarily, I would answer something like this off the list -- to avoid
mispeaking myself, or being mistaken for an official representative of SJ
Games (which I am not). But I think this is of enough general interest to
justify an attempt to respond. Mr. Miller or Mr. Wiseman will please
correct *my* misperceptions, if they are listening.

As I understand it, when Marc Miller sold SJ Games the license to produce
GURPS Traveller material, he (and they, I believe) contacted the current
holder of the DGP copyrights to see if he would participate in the deal.
That individual wanted an inordinately high fee for the material, and
therefore the license specifically excludes anything produced by DGP. Other
former Traveller licenses are still under discussion.

The original license from GDW to DGP included the provision that all
concepts and proper names created by DGP would be available to future GDW
products; the text itself, however, belongs to DGP. This relationship has
been inherited by FarFutures and the current DGP copyright holder.

SJ Games, on the other hand, is understandably leery about legal
complications in its licensed products. Their guidance to freelance GT
authors (including me) is to avoid any material or concept originally
appearing in DGP products.

The GT freelancers therefore refer to DGP as the "Forbidden Canon". Our
solution generally has been to work diligently to find a GDW precedent for
any key concept that was elaborated in DGP material. If none can be found,
we attempt to find a solution that, while not referring to DGP material, at
least does not invalidate it.

There are four basic problems with this --

(1) The licensing difficulties described above.

(2) I was not hired to do a reprint of Starship Operator\'s Manual. I have a
different set of criteria to meet:

http://www.io.com/~thrash/starship.html

(3) Some of the "neat ideas" in SOM are not compatible with GURPS
(especially GURPS Vehicles) and the GURPS Traveller material printed to
date. I have an obligation to support what has already been printed for GT.

(4) As Eris mentioned, it would in fact be *very* difficult to improve on
the original; to a certain extent, I am disinclined to try. However, just
as Far Trader was not a word-for-word rehash of Merchant Prince, nor First
In a copy of Scouts or WBH, I intend to produce a sourcebook on starships
in GT that is useful in its own right. It will necessarily overlap SOM in
many areas, but the approach will not be the same.

GT: Starships is actually a collaborative effort: I invite anyone
interested in contributing to read through the website above. The project
is on hiatus right now (while I get settled into my new assignment) but
should pick up again in September.

ARRGH!!!

The \'helpful\' person on my company\'s helpdesk just deleted all my bookmarks
while poking around my harddrive with Timbuktu.

Would some kind soul please resend me Dan\'s URL so I can start rebuilding
all the Traveller bookmarks it took me a FREAKING THREE YEARS to collect?

Dang! What a Friday the 13th this has been!

Basicly fires a beam that triggers the pain nerves. May have been invented

It was very effective.  However, a number of supervillains wanted to date
this character later, which was a problem, and then they really got mad when
they found out that the tall, willowy Asian in the black spandex and lace
was actually a slender *man*...

And where might one get *that*? ;)

Seriously, though, I think the SR rules set should work well for M:0, I like
the Comp rules, and some of the vehicle stuff would be great. Like the
silloette(sp) rules. Maybe that isn\'t even the term used, it\'s been a while.
They pioneered (AFAIK) the "target per die" system Storyteller uses, and the
Condition Monitor too. How about d12\'s though? They give a greater range
without going too crazy (ie: d20\'s). Oh, and thecybernetics rules too! Joy!

Methinks I might get some SR books, as my SR arbiter took his away. :(

That\'d be fun to watch, but I don\'t think you can use Corndog because it\'s
not a natural ingredient.  I\'m pret\'sure that they always begin with a

Battle Corn would be amusing, though judging it would kill me dead (I\'m

I wasn\'t completely up on the current debate. Stated like this the \'Out

Actually, since that\'s _exactly_ how mtDNA works, yes, that\'s what their
research means. Also, there have been other studies recently, notably on
patrilineal DNA that seem to give _similar_ although not identical
results. This is the big kicker for the \'Out of Africa\' theory, and
sticking point of the \'Evolved Everywhere\' theory. Any transmissible
trait linked to a single gender displays this behavior. The
geneaologists got this idea _immediately_ as patrilineal family names
behave in exactly this fashion. Were we to have practiced _strict_
patrilineality, ie: we only ever get our fathers name, we would almost
all be named either Smith or Li, and the genetic clock on mtDNA goes
back a lot farther than name registries.

What this means in the light of the various theories is of course, the
muddle in the middle...it means that the last wave out of Africa
contributed a lot to our DNA. This of course doesn\'t mean that our
ancestors went out and kicked ass all over the earlier humans, but that
they moved rather fast and interbred everywhere. Eve and her daughters
must have been pretty good looking ;-)

This mean that H. erectus is probably just a subspecies of H. sap under
the skin? This has _direct_ bearing on the very topic, meaning that if
the Ancients _did_ come down and scoop up a pile of H. erectus
populations, then scattered them about, they all _did_ evolve into h.
sapiens (vilanis, zhodani, etc, etc, etc)

And given we were then in need of yelling like crazy, since this was
when we\'d left the saftey of the trees and moved out onto the savannah,
it _was_ advantageous to be able to say "HEY HEY HEY There\'s a Lion over
THERE", even if it was only so that we guaranteed slower running humans
scattering to tempt the lion more than ourselves. <Wilderness mantra: \'I

Has anyone noticed that Ken Bearden has reappeared and all of a sudden the
T4 task system is back on the discussion list ;-)

Although it\'s nice to have him back...

Well, in my part of the universe the advent of TNE resulted in a dearth of
Traveller combined with a regression to MT.

They are. And the pictures are lousy scans by the look of them.

The oversized nature of the Empress Marava is why I created the
Prince Teriadeven class merchant - which is a set of 200 ton deckplans
that match the classic Far Trader stats.... and has the SAME SHAPE
as the Empress Marava - just in a smaller package.

I missed that one.  It any good?


Well, yes and no.  I\'d have to give it a mediocre vote.  But its a small
book so you won\'t spend too much time in it.  Of course, tis assumes you can
find a copy.  Good luck.

 There are two printed solutions that require no rewrite of the
class: Use the plans from Guilded Lily (the last TNE book) which
are a true 200 tons, or use the classic plans (Traders & Gunboats,
etc.) but with the understanding that the grid scale is 1.0m instead
of 1.5m. This means that it takes FOUR grid squares to make a ton
instead of two
 Seeker actually paid attention to the deckplans when rendering
them to their 1" format, and made adjustments accordingly...

    'body' => 'In the interest of completeness, here is a heavily modified RPG system
based on Classic Traveller that I came up with.  The full version is on my
web page at http://home.austin.rr.com/darkbox/one.htm .

This is a point-based, skill-driven role-playing system designed to be
played with two six-sided dice. Players typically have 35 Stat points and
35 Skill points with which to build their characters.

Characters are defined by five Stats: Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence,
Health, and Speed. The players can split up their 35 Stat points between
these however they see fit, though the Stats must fall inside the human
range of 2 to 12. The character also has one more Stat, Hit Points, which
is equal to (Health * 3).

Now Skills may be purchased. The Skill chart is at the bottom of the page.
If a Skill is listed under a Stat it means there is a base to start from
equal to (Stat / 3), discarding any fraction.  The player must pay one
character point to buy a skill at base level.  Example:  a character has an
Intelligence of 9, and so would have a base of 3 in Gunnery.  He must pay
one Skill point to raise his Gunnery from 0 to 3 before he can purchase
additional levels.

Extra levels may now be bought by spending Skill points. Base+1 costs one
point. Base+2 costs two points, and so on. However, remember that all
levels must be paid for. Jumping straight from Base to Base+5 costs 15
points, because Bases +1 through +4 must also be paid for. There is no
limit to how high Skills can get (unless the GM decides to set one).

Tasks are resolved by rolling dice against Skills (or Stats if no Skills
apply), with any modifiers that the GM feels appropriate.  Rolling equal to
or below your modified Skill on two six-sided dice indicates success.
Rolling above your Skill results in failure, as does a natural roll of 12
(no matter what your skill). Combat simply consists of lots of task
resolutions for combat skills. The Speed Stat controls when characters do
things. Each combat "turn" consists of twelve one-second "segments", and
each character may act only in segments that correspond to their Speed, as
show on the Segment Chart below. A character may perform as many actions as
the number in the chart indicates. Characters may move in their segment or
they may take up to two actions, one with each hand. If they do choose to
take two actions, each will be at a -2 penalty.

As mentioned above, characters have (Health * 3) Hit Points. Since this
results in the same possible damage range as Classic Traveller (3 to 36),
the Classic Traveller weapon damages can be used.

As the lead flies and the swords swing, characters will become wounded.
Once a character loses their Health in Hit Points, they drop to wounded
status and have an additional -2 penalty to all actions. When a character
loses (Health * 2) Hit Points, they fall unconscious. And if they are then
hurt further until they lose (Health * 3) in Hit Points, they die. Example:
A character has Health 7. They have 21 Hit Points, but once 7 are gone they
become wounded. When 14 are gone, they fall unconscious. And when all 21
are gone, they die.

We\'re pleased to announce that the BITS website http://www.bits.org.uk/ has
a new free supplement in Acrobat format. If you go to the Archive page, and
look in the Rules section of the Acrobat area, you will find MayDay M4.1.

The author, Sean Bayan Schoonmayer, has developed these starship combat
rules to replace the flawed set released in T4. The rules use the Classic
Traveller game \'Mayday\' for their inspiration, and are written to be
compatible with both T4 and the T4.1 playtest draft. The system relies on
Bruce Alan Macintosh\'s Definitive Sensor Rules, and the T4 version of Fire,
Fusion and Steel (FFS2) to provide the core design system.

We hope you enjoy this and hope to bring you more material soon!

Its very rare.  Made from an enchanted metal known as \'unobtainium\', which
only Initiated Game Masters can create.  ;)

Ironically, IMTU I\'m exploring the idea that despite the increasing
sophistication of \'intelligent\' devices, reliance on networked data systems
is reduced in many cases.  I can easily see some hi-pop, TL 12+ worlds
having worldnets resembling SR\'s Matrix, but we\'re talking a handful of
worlds in any sector.

Hah!  Too easy.  A target number of 9 or 10 should be induce sweaty palms
and hand tremors when rolling the dice.  :P  Remember, SR tests are
open-ended d6 rolls, which allows for no upper limit on target numbers.
This does have that odd \'7\' flat-spot on the probablity curve (a target
number of 7 is essentially indentical to a 6) as an artifact of the die
rolling convention.  This, IMHO, falls far lower on the Ugly Scale than
T4.x\'s \'half-die\' concept.

> Oh, and the cybernetics rules too! Joy!

Hmm.  I\'m an old skool CT guy at heart - I do think injecting some elements
of SR gameplay can liven up traditional Traveller themes (Megacorp activity,
in particular, translates quite well to the TU), but heavy cyber will
suppressed tech in MTU.  Still, there bound to be shadow labs out there
somewhere, cranking out some outrageous super-duper covert types for the
Impies and the Bureaus.

> Methinks I might get some SR books, as my SR arbiter took his away. :(
> BZA

If you like the game, but do not have a copy of the rules, I can highly
recommend the new 3rd Edition book!

Fusion Propulsion Engine Experiment</FONT></H2></center>

<FONT SIZE=4>The Gasdynamic Mirror, or GDM, is an example of a magnetic mirror-based fusion propulsion system. Its design is relatively simple, primarily consisting of a long slender solenoid surrounding a vacuum chamber that contains the plasma. The bulk of the fusion plasma is confined by magnetic fields generated by a series of toroidal-shaped magnets in the central section of the device. Stronger end magnets called mirror magnets prevent the plasma from escaping too quickly out the ends. (See
the first plasma photo at the bottom of the page.) Theoretically, it has been shown that the geometry of the GDM should be effective in preventing the major causes of instability known to plague classical fusion mirror machines. A major instability inherent in short, fat mirror machines is the MHD or "flute" instability. This instability is a result of excessive curvature in the magnetic field lines. In the GDM this instability is eliminated by the long slender geometry of the device. The high-plasma density in the device, which produces a shorter plasma ion mean free path, helps reduce to a large extent the consequences of another type of instability called the loss cone microinstability which has also plagued many mirror machines in the past.

<center><FONT SIZE=3>GDM experiment as of March 5, 1999.</FONT></center><P>


The purpose of the Gasdynamic Mirror Fusion Propulsion Experiment is to confirm the feasibility of the concept and to demonstrate many of the operational characteristics of a full-sized engine. This will be accomplished with a small-scale experiment which should determine if a plasma can be confined within the desired physical configuration and still remain stable. The experiment is designed to be very flexible and has been constructed so the placement of the magnets and the length of the device can be changed easily and quickly to accommodate a wide range of experimental objectives. If experiments continue to confirm that the concept shows promise, the device will be lengthened and the plasma temperatures raised to the threshold where fusion reactions should begin to take place. <P>

<center><FONT SIZE=3>An artist&#146s rendering of the completed GDM experiment.</FONT></center><P>


On October 23, 1998, first plasma was achieved in the GDM Fusion Propulsion experiment. The plasma was produced during a test of the plasma injector system. The purpose of the plasma injector is to introduce a gas into the GDM and heat it until it becomes a plasma. The injector operates by using a microwave antenna operating at 2.45 GHz to induce Electron Cyclotron Resonance Heating (ECRH) of the gas. As the hot electrons stream out of the injector in response to imposed magnetic fields, they create an electric field which drags the ions along through a process called ambipolar diffusion. It is the process of ambipolar diffusion which raises the ions to the high temperatures required. This effect requires that the magnetic fields produced by the solenoid magnets be present. For this test these magnets were not installed, so the the ions remained in a cold state.<P>

My point was that the Seeker plans already count the A2 as a 400 tonner,
which fits the size of the d/p\'s. At least in MTU the A2 has mover to a
400 ton ship and rather than concider it an up graded Free Trader, it\'s
really an up-graded Fat Trader/

It\'s been a *long* time since I studied any of this, so I might be
outdated, but my understanding is that size of babies, particularly
baby\'s heads is thought to have had something to do with how we
evolved.  IOW, small uterus + big heads = very low survival rate.
That might have been "Eve\'s" special mutation that made her line so
successful..a wider birth canal.

IMTU, humaniti is pretty homoginized in the region the PC\'s are in,
but there\'s no telling what might be a jump or two beyond the
explored stars.  If I was playing in a more traditional TU, I think
I\'d give the various "races" some nice big visible differences.

Whatever floats your boat, man.  :)  Still, hitting a target number of 9
(extreme range with an unmodified firearm, for example) will be easier on a
d12 than rolling a 6 and then a 3 or better with d6.  Target numbers seldom
get any higher than 12 anyway.  Besides, my players already have skads of
d6, I\'m not gonna ask them to go out and buy 30 d12s.  :P  Or even, more
realistically (I hope), a dozen of them.

3rd Edition SR has quite a number of small but far reaching tweaks that
further polishes the game.  Melee combat still sucks of course (but not
quite as badly), just about everything else works really well.

The answer is: maybe. The GURPS sourcebooks such as First In and
Behind The Claw tend to go into a lot more detail than their equivalent
LBBs from CT. On the other hand, they are written with GURPS players
first and foremost in their minds (or so I assume, anyway). The G:T
main rulebook you can safely ignore, since you aren\'t going to be
using GURPS to begin with.

Have access to it, although I\'m not likely to be using it much.  The GURPS

Marc knows about this, as he knows about all of the GURPS projects.
Sounds like I have or don\'t need almost all of the sources you mention,
and a kind gentleman here in the States has offered to run off the Digest

The reason for all of the Terran references stems from the Rule of Man,
during which the Solomani of Terra brought their culture to the rest of 
known space, in much the same way as the culture of the United States of 
20th-Century Terra spread around the world once communication technology 
reached TL6 or thereabouts. And the reason that 20th-Century Terra in
particular is so often used is that many Solomani historians look back
upon that era as the Golden Age of Human Culture, the pinnacle of human
cultural evolution, the...

I considered writing a character based on TNG into a story at one

That\'s what they keep saying, but there\'s a bunch of spinal grade

Nope.  But then, I\'m a piracy advocate.  <grin>  Fact is, my fave area of space, Reavers\' Deep, even has a couple planets that used to be havens, plus 1 current wide open freeport.

I tend to assume most worlds have a fairly basic network, even if it relies
on imported gear.  Anything above an E class starport is likely to have a
few satellites around it, and if a C class or better port, definitely will.
 This gives you a basic backbone.  I usually assume some centralised
processing power at the starport - equivalent, at least, to a starship\'s
computers (or if I\'m really really pushed, a cutter\'s - but that blows up
my last \'at least\').  This will often allow some kind of "Library Data" to
be available, plus some communications.

I add more capabilities as population and technology increase.

The end result is usually a fairly sparse, minimalist network, even though
the individual components are usually far more powerful than anything that
exist on Earth today.  Can such a network be hacked?  Well, duh!  This just
means that financial and other secure communications have to be dealt with
in different ways.  On relatively low-pop worlds, that means a lot more
face-to-face transactions, which is usually fine, given that I assume that
populations tend to cluster around a small number of population centres,
with a "big", essentially unpopulated, outback in most cases.

Megacorps, governments, and other major institutions often have their own
"secure" networks, as required.

I tend to view the whole "cyberpunk" thing as being a result of social
immaturity, at least from the viewpoint of the 3I.  The Imperium operates,
largely, on mature technology, where any social impacts occurred long ago,
and little is considered particularly gee-whiz.  As such, people who use
cyberjunk, apart from \'normal\' prostheses, are generally considered nerds,
if sometimes dangerous ones.  After all, very little can\'t be achieved by
non-invasive means - there\'s slow drug, and combat drug, and night vision
gear, armour, wrist computers, and so on.  So a cyborg doesn\'t have any
real advantage over a properly prepared normal, and is really only someone
wandering around saying "look at me - I\'m a dangerous idiot".

Are there advantages to covertly equipping people with "stuff"?  Of course.
 Most of the time, however, I suspect that it would tend to be "Stainless
Steel Rat" type gear - itself, of course, pretty serious.  Now I think of
it, I was using that kind of stuff in campaigns pretty much from the
beginning, along with "power-holsters" - quick draw gear lifted from the
"Deathworld" books.

For Net/hacker stuff, see above.

I\'ve always been intrigued by the possibility of running a scenario where
the 3I runs into a "cyberpunk" world.  The image of a massively powerful
"Big Iron" interstellar state colliding with a bunch of smart barbarians is
kind of appealing.  The Imperial Marines hits the mean streets....

Last time I looked, IHTIT is slated to become official in T5. The thing I really
like about IHTIT is that it makes low skill/high stat characters good a
basic tasks, but when you need to do something out of the ordinary, the
high skill characters really come into their own. To me it better represents
reality than any fixed weighting of skill vs stats ever could. Its also so
elegant in its simplicity. How many dice am I rolling, does my skill equal
that? if not roll two more dice, is what I rolled less than my skill and stat?
I\'ve played using this for quite awhile now and it really is fast

The initial idea was mine, but it had a different level of prerequisite skill for
each taskm (making if rather unweildy). Marc took that idea and made the
prerequiste skill level equal to the number of dice (a stroke of sheer brillance,
which really makes the system work) and replaced my variable penalty with
a fixed penalty of two levels.

 Of *course* it\'s a great rule: *Marc* came up with it.

And it really kills off most of my remaining problems the T5 task system.
Except for that half-die -- I might use that, maybe not. But I\'m sure as
heck going to get the book when it finally appears.  The playtest chapters
Marc has been circulating look terrific. He\'s too enamoured with his little
index cards, but otherwise the rules rock.

Well, I *assumed* if one were to use a die with twice the range, one would

Well, that\'s some damn fine work, Andrew.  Kudos to you and Marc.

This is the type of thing that is possible with game mechanics--simple ideas, easy to implement,
but detailed in their representation and elegant with respect to logic.

The reason I like this rule so much is the same reason I cringe when I see that single half die in
the T4.1 task system.  That\'s just lazy work.  If the designers of T5 put their heads to it, and
sprinkle in little inspiration, they could come up with a task system worthy of the Traveller
name.

I admire well thought out game mechanics.  I can\'t stand anything less.

But, the IHTIT rule is pure brilliance.

Kenneth.

	Hi, Trent!
	You\'ve got it right on the nose here.  A very good friend of mine
runs his own gaming company and spent a good deal of time on
game-mechanics design when developing thier system.  Without a bell-curve,
and preferably a *substantial* one, it becomes too easy for a player to
pile DM+1\'s on top of each other to make up for not having invested in a
skill or stat.

I really like this system -- simple, elegant, and captures the feel of CT
pretty well.

By way of reality check, I have to say that Intelligence has very little to
do with actually flying a helicopter -- it is almost purely an exercise in
Dexterity. [I\'m a rated helicopter pilot.] The Intelligence-related
functions would fit well under Navigation, anyway.

By way of suggestions:

(1) Navigation has always seemed to me an exercise in mathematics and
visualization (Intelligence), while Social Engineering (if I understand
what you mean by it) is more nebulous and hard to specify. I\'d say switch
them on the chart.

(2) Remember that while CT had no science skills, it did have an Education
statistic instead. Suggest you add at least a generic "Science" skill.

	1) Random character generation. (Some people won\'t like this. :} )  You
draw cards.
	2) Your stat determines the size of the dice you roll (4, 6, 8, 12, 20).
	3) You normally reroll the dice and add the extra when  you roll the
maximum on a die. 
	
	This gives you helpless incompetents (D4 stat, 1 skill, would roll 1D4 ),
talented amateurs (D12 stat, 1 skill who would roll 1d12), good talented
professionals (D12 stat, 4 skill roll 4 D12) or anything in between.  If
you have a D4 for the stat, you are NEVER going to be as good as the man

Subject: Re: Trade or Sell

Once upon a time, when D&D was still new, just about everyone at GDW
made
aphotocopy of the basic D&D books because they were not yet available
in
evnough volume for everyone to have their own copy.

Once the sets became available, we all went out and bought them and
discarded
the photocopies... which were just inferior.

If someone makes a photocopy for his or her own use, that is called
fair use,
as long as it\'s not the whole product, and as long as its not for
resale.
That includes copying someone else\'s copy of the product.

That is especially true if the product itself is not currently
available (ie
CT or Mt, probably not for T4).

When someone starts photocopying multtiple copies for others, then it
gets to
be infringement.

Personally, if you want a specific work which isn\'t in print and you
can get
a photocopy, I think that\'s OK.

Hey, I\'m just repeating what I\'ve read. My guess is that either the
cells are transparent to radar (possible, not likely) or they *absorb*
radar (possible, and *much* more likely).

You\'re looking at it from the wrong side. Yes, mtDNA stops when one doesn\'t
have a daughter. But you had a mother. And she had a mother. And *she* had
a mother. And so on. Same with everybody else. Go back far enough, and the
lines will converge.

Or an assistant...

The late G. Harry Stine, in his book _Halfway to Anywhere_, reveled the
existence of the Three Dolphin Club, whose members has had sex in zero-g.
The club got it\'s name from the fact that dolphins mate in threes, one
male, one female, one helper.

According to the book, there are several members of the of the shuttle
program "qualified" to wear the pin after "unscheduled experiments" on at
least seven flights.

Yep.  A bunch of our DNA seems to have been just catching a ride.  However, 
traits that are expressed are those that were reproductively beneficial.  
Those traits are retained.  Evolution works on the phenotype -- the genotype 
is the transport system.  When the Ancients did the scoop, I think they got a 
pretty homogenous bunch and when those critters were deposited, they evolved 
to meet their environments.  The traits that were more reproductively 
beneficial in each environment were retained by those critters.

Yep.  What I\'m not sure of is why it is assumed that it was the last wave of 
migrants that contributed so much to our genetic makeup.  Maybe our genetic 
makeup is a compilation of DNA from all the waves.  The interbreeding all 
over the place seems pretty accurate to me -- that\'s kinda what is intended 
in the theory.

Ooh... I was hoping no one was going to notice that because I\'m out on a limb 
now.  But yes, that\'s what I think and I\'m not alone on that limb.  It gets 
political here.  Species are named arbitrarily by traits that separate them 
from each other.  H. erectus and H. sapiens are pretty damn similar at the 
skeleton.  Sure there are differences, but the differences are pretty small 
when compared to the differences that equate to species division in other 
critters.  Subspecies seems a more appropriated division to me.

[I am not picking a fight.  I am not picking a fight.  I am not picking a

The whole Savanna dweller thing is up for debate right now.  Current 
paleoecology studies indicate that the change from forest to grassland took, 
oh, about as long as the whole Australopithecine to Homo change.  It wasn\'t a 
rapid thing.  A. ramidus, held by some to be the earliest found human 
ancestor, was a forest dweller, based on skeletal interpretation.  A. 
africanus could easily have been a bi-environmental kinda critter, equally 
adapted to vertical tree climbing as vertical terrestrial posture.  Reaching 
the Homo mark, they were pretty on the ground, but that\'s way late in the 
Miocene and it still wasn\'t the savanna of textbook paleo stuff.

But in essence, you\'re probably right because that\'s when the critters had 
probably been standing upright long enough for all that physiology to have 
happened to allow for lion hollering\'.  Ya know, chimps in their call signals 
are pretty good at that too, and we\'re not sure that they don\'t communicate 
simple abstractions in time/space either.  But that is a debate for another 
time..

So now I\'m going to tell you all who I am.  Monkey Girl here is a graduate 
from CU-Colorado Springs in Anthropology.  My emphasis was Physical 
Anthropology, and I basically have an undergraduate degree in Biology too, 
except I opted not to take Organic Chemistry and Physics.  Human evolution 
and mammalian studies were my thing for a long time.  Origins of bipedality 
is my hobby horse.  Then I found archaeology, my world tilted a little on 
it\'s axis, and I left it all behind - about 2 months ago.  That\'s me, and 
hopefully what I\'ve been saying about human origins has sounded totally like 
a lot of crap.

Thanks.
Sherry.

Sounds good to me.  IIRC, the Tarsus box went into some detail about this
lo-pop\'s simple-but-effective comm network.  The kind of net I was refering
to was a full bore VR, Johnny Mnemonic kind of thing.  Which might be
another example of your tech growing phases - a sohpisticated TL15 world
might find such a construct rather silly.  :)  Also, any net that can be
built, can be hacked.  Which is why I see a reduced reliance on nets by
hi-tech military and megacorp organizations.  At some point, the benefits
may not outweigh the risks.  Without FTL comm, management structures have to
be decentralized anyway.

Hehehe.  I agree completely!  Most applications for chrome in a cyber genre
game are replaced at higher techs with far less invasive techniques.  Drugs,
gene therapy, clone organs - the list goes on.  The first - and last - valid
cyber application I see in use by anyone in the 3I is neural interfaces of
some kind.  Above a certain tech level (TL11?) they wouldn\'t be visible
(induction or possibly a very short range transmiter).  You\'d still be the
definition of a 3I uber-geek by having one though.  Probably a highly paid
uber-geek, though!  :P

Even within Shadowrun, cybertech is slowly being replaced by bioware.  I can
imagine a TL15 black lab that performs mods of a totally non-cyber nature.
Not only can you get custom designed \'improved\' organs, glands, etc., I can
see really cutting edge tech body scultpuring via DNA programming.  How
about Niven\'s RNA skill training?

Those are good examples.  Haven\'t read "Deathworld" (recommendations?
author?).  I can see a lot of very specialized uses of neural links (besides
computer nerds, that is :), such as battledress, \'smartguns\', ect.  A link
with a memory module, and the capability of recording everything you see and
hear, could be a useful intel application at some tech levels (the old
\'human camera\' trick).

I\'m considering a campaign set in the M:0 Wilds, beyond the expanding
imperial fringe.  I can easily imagine a semi-retrograde (TL10?) hi-pop
world falling into \'perverse\' technological practices.  :)

Hmm.  I\'ve seen the poly-count/skill level thing before, that\'s becoming
popular with some designers.  The new fantasy RPG Larry Elmore is publishing
uses this (I can\'t remember its name, Sovereign somthingorother).  That game
has an interesting mechanic for spellcasting: if your first roll doesn\'t
make the target number, you can try again the next round and add the result
to your last roll, and so on.  So you eventually get the spell off, but it
may take way longer than you wanted.  This mechanism could be applied to
other things besides spellcasting.  I\'ve looked Deadlands over, but was
mainly interested in the background rather than the mechanics.  Sigh..., Yet
Another Game System - I sometimes wonder if I shouldn\'t just buy the whole
game store ("yes, you can help me - I\'ll take one of everything").

I kinda like SR\'s dynamic between dice counts and target numbers.  Makes
skill defaulting descisions interesting.  :)  In the case of skill limits on
success (as you mentioned), SR has this simply due to the fact that a
character with a rating 3 skill will never get more than 3 successes, etc.

Also, my players won\'t be enthusiastic about random chargen.  They\'re
inveterate character-smiths, the lot of \'em.  Not mini-maxers per se, but
they like to carefully model their character ideas and will want more
control that randomized systems provide.  Another reason why I\'m not
considering the CT-based rulesets.  Actually, one reason I like SR as a GM,
is that although it is technically a point based chargen system, it doesn\'t
have that zero-sum feel I get from Hero and GURPS.  The Priority Table is a
thing of beauty...  :P

Points taken.  Just for reference, here\'s how I assigned all of the skills:

· Any skill that requires extensive schooling automatically defaults to No
Base.
· Hand-to-hand combat skills default to Dexterity.
· Missile combat skills default to Intelligence.
· Vehicles that can be navigated by sight default to Dexterity. (So you\'re
right, I\'ve screwed up on some of the vehicle skills :)
· Vehicles that require computer operation or are not navigated by sight
default to Intelligence.

The term "social engineering" comes from Bruce Sterling\'s bok, The Hacker
Crackdown.  It\'s a catchall "fooling other people" skill.

Great site! Those are some fantastic gaming props you got going there. I
have been collecting some flotsam to build some Traveller props, like
Starports, ruins, crash sites, etc. Anyone have any pointers? 25mm scale
seems very popular, but what about larger scenes? City panorama type stuff.

I was also wondering where one might buy game pieces online. Some of what I
want may not all be at the same place, I was looking for:

Monopoly houses/hotels (or similar)
Hex tiles (bathroom kind, ceramic would be fine, other?, *not* Grox Blox)
Stratego type markers, featureless is fine. Or not, I\'ll paste/paint over.
Inexpensive (ie: plastic, not pewter/lead) Figures, Sci-Fi & Fantasy.
Unmarked polyhedra, any size, material, #sides, for many uses. (dice only 1)
Other Odds & Ends, you can probably see my interests, eh?

I have a Risk/Dark Tower/Diplomacy type game I\'ve been working on, any help
will be greatly appreciated. Thanks.

Perhaps.  But doing so makes almost all combat skills default to Dexterity.
 I had them default to Intelligence for the sake of play balance.

Perhaps we could handle it another way.  Classic Traveller assigns positive
DMs to melee combat for Strength, and positive DMs to missile combat for
Dexterity.  Perhaps I could have all melee weapon skills default to
Strength, all missile weapon skills default to Dexterity, and all tech
skills to Intelligence.  That way all three of the main Stats give some
sort of skill advantage.  What do you think?

Most theories make the "hot gas giants" out at the normal outer part of their
stellar systems and then shuffle them in to their current orbits, either
through
graviational billiards with other planets, or through slower tidal drags from
the protoplanetary disk of material orbiting the star.

Agreed, I *DON\'T* do drugs (period), and alcohol is a definite no no in
play.  But something that enhances feelings, gets the subbie into that
"sub-space" faster or more pleasurable would be SSC if the submissive seeks
it out (though I don\'t agree with r/l drugs and alcohol being taken by a
submissive before play either... they need to be aware of the world about
them and their senses as much as a Dominant does)

Hmm, I\'ll have to take another look at Tarsus.

I was assuming that you were talking about a Johnny Mnemonic thing.  Such a
thing would partly be a result of population density, and not purely of
technology.  Or in other words it would be a social construct.  In fact it
would differ entirely between societies.  Imagine a Zhodani Net.  No
security!  (Unless it\'s military, of course.)

Military organisations, at least, will absolutely require effective
communications networks.

It might even be possible to do this non-invasively too.  The problem would

I tend to assume a fair capacity for body sculpturing, following Poul
Anderson\'s "Flandry" series, among others.

Bioware would probably be harder to detect than "chrome".  It also has a
long history in the kind of space opera-ish stuff which Traveller draws
from, so it\'s probably pretty OK.  

(If anyone has a problem with me saying that Traveller is a space opera
game,  please let me know:  I will call various Emperors, Cutlass-wielding
Marines and Talking Dogs to my defence, assuming they can take the time off
from their various galaxy spanning wars....  OK, it\'s at the real science
end of the scale, and we can call it "Hard SF" if we want, but at heart
it\'s deeply silly.  And so am I.)

The OTU is carefully set up, of course, to ensure that Bioware is a rare
thing, firmly under the referee\'s control, as it should be.  Kind of like
Psionics, or any other potential advantages for PCs.

There are IIRC, three "Deathworld" books, by Harry Harrison.  They\'re
actually pretty average, but are very Travellerish.  I may even reread them
myself, now that I\'ve thought about them.  The titles are very imaginative
- - "Deathworld", "Deathworld II", etc.

I\'ve used permutations of the first idea a few times, although not with
Minor Races - over time, clothing will change to reflect climate.

Plot ideas:  If you really want to make a big deal of the naked part,
religious missionaries start denouncing the "immoral" natives.  Either the
natives run the missionaries out of town on a rail, or the missionaries, or
their local converts, start using more forceful means to spread "morality".

Alternatively, the locals tend to avoid unnecessary possessions in general,
so the naked thing is just a side effect.  That doesn\'t mean that they\'re
low tech, though.  When whoever it is that\'s pushing the "primitives"
around goes too far, the "savages" start pulling out the Gauss Rifles.... 
The local "big man" turns out to have been an S-3 scout.

Oh, and light skinned populations might need some method of protecting
themselves from sunburn/skin cancer.  Possibilities include:
hi-tech sunscreens, produced by genetically engineered plants, 
similar sunscreens, mixed with body paints,
precursor substances to melanin, or something like that.

So your "Naked People" could have any skin colour you like, including
flourescent green.

Which I believe is from endorphins?  I was subject to similar effects placed
upon me from runs/marches in the army, but never analised it (and never
liked it much either, it was a job).  The same woman quoted above worked for
the US Defence department and quoted such things as you mentioned (from
various sporting aspects; long distant swimmers, marathon runners, distance
runners, etc.), she was quite into it and needed it analised, so she did.

This is very much a "YMMV" thing.  With someone you love who craves such
things as "natural," you would be denying them an outlet (it\'s not always
sexual either) which could place strain upon a relationship.  It also works
the other way, "being forced to hurt someone you love" can place strain upon
the relationship if you don\'t like doing it.  Then there is the "I couldn\'t
comprehend doing such a thing to my wife/girlfriend/lover until I did, and
saw what she got out of it and man..."

There is no simple answer to such things, but you either do or don\'t do it,
but you never know until you do if you are going to like it... weird huh?

They are called "hot" because they are much closer to their stars than
Mercury is to Sol. They are very unlikely to have satellites as stable
orbits would probably be inside the Roche limit (the distance at which
tidal forces will tear a "natural" satellite apart). 

And since just about all theories have them moving in from the outer
system, the odds of any useful planets farther out is pretty unlikely.

As for skimming, *I* wouldn\'t try it. They are *much* more massive than
Jupiter. And being so close to their stars, you\'ll already be hotter
than hell *before* you have to deal with friction heating from the
skimming run. 

It\'s the sort of thing you do only if death is the alternative.

Running a freeport is a very unhealthy business in or near the 3I. Piracy
is a crime against the state in the Imperium - it was set up to ensure the
safety of commerce, after all. Note that the Imperium has Vargr client
states, and these presumably know their continued existance relies on them
doing the right thing vis a vis freeports supporting corsairs preying on
the Imperium. There is also the possibility of the Reinsurers Association
passing the hat around and getting some thugs to find the operation\'s base
and take it out of business (hey ! There\'s an adventure hook).

Even if you ignoring the mechanics of grand theft starship (fraud,
hijacking or barratry are far more profitable ways of turning a dishonest
credit than using an exceedingly expensive, very noticeable, very fragile
asset like an armed starship), you still have the problems of getting the
bits to the freeport without being noticed.

Armed action has the problem that you are almost always under heavy time
pressure - hours or less. If you had a week in a deserted system, yes you
could strip just about anything out of a ship. It\'s a different proposition
if you have between minutes and hours until the cavalry arrives (this is
part of why I postulate piracy is viable in the Outsystem, away from
mainworlds. They can see you with that Sens 14 mil-spec PEMS, but it will
still take them days to get to you ... needless to say, traders who trade
in the Outsystems are heavily armed with the proceeds from the higher
freight rates that hold in unsafe outsystems).

Action with the active co-operation of the crew is much easier - you
\'misjump\' somewhere safe (providing plausible deniability for the crew),
and go for it.

If your freeport is in a State that doesnt care (pretty rare within the
reach of an IN task force IMO), then you dont have a problem. If it does
care, if just to provide plausible deniability, then you are going to need
to smuggle the stolen parts in, then \'rebadge\' them for re-export to the
Extents.

The obvious counter for the Imperium is to severly regulate (and thus
require scads of paperwork for) export of starships and starship parts to
the Vargr Extents (1). RICO type laws could make smuggling a
high-concequence operation (the point was made that this is an open
invitation to the Imperial Bureaucracy to fake the evidence in order to
sieze the ship. My reply to this is "And ? There are reasons for that
dropoff in trade between states, and for the existance of Interface Lines").

In short, stealing stuff as valuable and important as starships isnt easy.
Nor is getting rid of it afterwards.

Ian Whitchurch

(1) I dont see it as unreasonable for starship parts to be held in a bonded
warehouse until the receipt is countersigned by the Issuing Authority on
the part\'s origin world. It\'s only about 3 months to Mora from the border,
and at Imperial interest rates of about 3% that means the opportunity cost
of holding them there will be about 5% when all is said and done. Of
course, if you have the right connections, you dont have to go through this
rigamarole. After all, we dont want the wrong people trading with our Vargr
Friends, do we ?

Goodness gravy.  You came near to describing the game I am currently running.


Durima (1205 Corridor) at year -20.  No Imperium, only wilds, pocket empires
and "frontier justice before the Dawn".

My game focuses on a high tech world (TTL 12/GTL10) that survived the Long
Night and became insular and xenophobic.  As centuries rolled by, xenophobia
slowly started to dwindle and a small percentage of the population started
thinking about interstellar travel.  The current Duriman political thought is
that by travelling to other systems, Durima can "plunder" the resources of the
weaker worlds around them, similiar to how first world nations exploit third
world nations on Earth.  By returning to space travel, they have enountered
other pocket empires (including the Freeboots Empire) and are becoming
entangled in interstellar politics. 

When it comes to technology, neural interface induction fields exist IMTU,
however there is no Matrix-like "more real than real" net.  The human brain
instinctivly knows the difference between "real" and "simulated" sensory data,
despite the fact that it is extremely lifelike.  Think of the difference
between seeing a dinosaur in Jurassic Park and seeing a dinosaur in your
living
room.  Two totally different sensations.

Neural induction field technology is also extremely widespread.  The average
citizen "watches" TV and interacts with their computer via the induction
fields.  The percentage of people that can really manipulate a computer or
device without relying on a neural interface is as widespread as people in the
20th century who can replace their hard drive or reinstall their operating
system without help.  Most citizens are totally dependant on the technology,
and nobody needs a interface jack surgically implanted into their skulls and
wired into their nervous system.

The technology for cyberware exists, however there is very rarely ever a need
to use it.  As mentioned before, there are few reasons to get a cybernetic eye
that can let you see in the infrared spectrum when you can simply put on a
pair
of IR goggles.  Seriously improved biotechnology exists, but is severely
limited by social factors rather than technological ones.

On the whole, my game tends to focus on espionage between corporate/noble
houses or deep space Scouts/Navy.  If anyone is interested I plan on running a
Scout oriented game session set in this background during Con-Quest \'99 (in
the
Bay Area).  Check out www.con-quest.com for more info.

Though I think these theories are generally thought to be "tenative".
Nobody seems to feel that whe have a real good handle on how those
planets were formed.

One interesting thing about H. Sapiens Sapiens vs almost all other primates
(Exceptions include Japanese Macaques, and "Elephant Monkeys") is that only
a very few have  downward facing nostrils (Most primate species have
forward facing nostrils)... The ones with downward pointing nostrils also
have a thicker subcutaneous fat layer, and a tendancy towards extensive
swimming &/or wading behaviors...

This adaptation pattern says one more environment that was definitely
adapted to prior to H Erectus (Whose nasal structure is claimed to be much
like modern H Sapiens): Water.

Further evidence: Human infants instinctually swim if placed in water
within hours of birth... surfacing to breath. I tend to think of early Homo
___ as being semi-aquatic... walkers who tended to spend lots of time
foraging swamps, rivers, and lakes.

    Of course, BDSM, is about sexual acts, & it all depends upon who you are
with.  If someone else was to whip Amber, I would curb-stomp him.  But, when
I do it, there is nothing she will not do in return for me.

    Which means that pain-sl*ts, enjoy the pain because it brings pleasure

    Correct, when I was 22 yo, my GF was a professional Domme, & once she
took me into work & I talked to professional Dommes & subbies.  They trained
me to whip a subbie the right way, one that causes pain, without damage.  I
had a good education there, to be a Dom.  And, I found out my GF, while a
Domme, was also a very good little subbie.  *weg*

Weren\'t several of the books released with individual names initially? I\'ve
one called _Homeworld_ in the stacks of books I\'ve had to put away because
of decorating, and I\'m sure it says that it\'s part of the Deathworld
trilogy...

The hero in the first book is an engineer (hurrah!) in the ruling classes
(boo! hiss!) who gets involved in the resistance against the state?

If I remember correctly, the Robert Westall novel \'FutureTrack 5\' is in a
similar background (character is from priviliged background in a world
controlled by the state - he ends up a rebel and slumming it).

FLGS stands for "Friendly Local Gaming Store".  You know, the one out there
in the big room with the ceiling that\'s sometimes blue and sometimes black
with little while lights? :)

SJ Games has always encouraged people to buy from their local gaming stores
instead of direct from them.  Warehouse 23 is supposed to be a weapon of
last resort.

According to Book 2, a 200-ton ship would take about 12 months to build.

This is IMTU:

The registration number is in four parts.

1. Vehicle Clasification
2. Sector/Subsector Code
3. Year of Registry
4. Unique identifier

For example, a free trader registered in the Regina system in 1088 might
have the following registry:

A-SMRE-1088-4257

This assumes that no single subsector in the Imperium will register more
than 9999 ships in a single year.

didn\'t pose the question as well as I would have liked.  I was talking about
a range of possibilities.   Any looting of a ship is going to take time,
doesn\'t matter if its transferring cargo or stripping out valuable
components.  The rule of thumb if you are in a hurry in such circumstances
is you don\'t take easily traceable items, and you concentrate on small, hard
to trace, items with a high ratio of value to bulk/mass.

I see a spectrum of criminal activity and reasons for it.  Thus we could
have thefts that are incidental to the original crime from "...pull the z
crystals while you\'re at Ralfie I got a buddy who buys them no questions
asked we\'ll split the take no reason to tell the boss..." to organized high
speed strippers "...ok, get to work me hearties, we got three hour on the
safe side, so lets rip the guts out of this baby and haul butt..." all the
way to "...hop to it me buckos, just patch the damage and jump her out of
here, we can strip what we want back at the \'roid".  It might be as simple
as stealing items with enough universality that they could function as
spares/replacement parts or as complicated as dealing with fence with
political connections and a place to sell where no one cares how hot the
merchandise is.  To give some modern examples of such direct trade, luxury
cars get ripped off all the time in Houston which turn up in the Middle
East.  SUVs get swiped anywhere in the southwest US and turn up in Belize.
Big luxury power boats get swiped in South Florida and turn up in South
America.   Just try to get any of these items back through "official
channels".

Regarding attempts by the Impies to stop piracy on its margins, if the risk
is low and the profit high, ....well lets put it this way,  ....they are

Human evolution has _always_ been more political than not. Except in Kansas,

The same thing happens in any field of study that depends solely on fossilized
remains for classification. If you\'ve gotten anywhere near the
paleontologists, I\'m sure you\'ve smelt the napalm from _their_ flamefests :-)
From their bones, paleontologists would probably classify a chihuahua and a
great dane as different species at the very least, and it would make sense if
they had 4 complete dog skeletons and a handful of other bones to go on.

If you want to see what neural links could do to a society, read Nova by
Samuel R. Delany. It is and it isn\'t Travellerish, but it is a stunning look
at a avery advanced future. In it, neural jacks change the entire concept of
\'work\' for the human race.

That question has been debated may times, most of the debate comes down to
\'Are they more like Ford Explorers, 747\'s or oil tankers?\' so the estimate
runs between a few weeks to several months or more. The truth is, we haven\'t a
clue. Gravitic technology changes things a LOT, as does having made starships
for a millenia or so. They may be more like cars for all we know, but likely
not. That is tied to starship production rates, which is _another_ damn can of
worms someone opened a long time ago; they\'ve wriggled to the far corners of
the universe by now. All that we have are rules from Trillion Credit Squadron,
which gives military ship production rates during wartime, and estimates from
_current_ production rates of various things.

The size of the yard makes a difference, certainly, but a big yard  will be
just as slow as a small one if they\'re not set up to make them. Auto, aircraft
and ship assembly facilities are quite specialized.
 
This is, alas, one case where it\'s left mostly up to the referee.

> 2) What kind of format do starship registration codes take? All
> numbers? How many digits?

Another things that\'s open to debate. Oldest canon on the books (literally, ON
the books ;-) states that the registration is the ships class (Free Trader)
and the ships name (Beowulf) as in \'Mayday Mayday! This is Free Trader
Beowulf! We are under attack...\'

Realistically, an unique identifier for each ship (as passed in the
transponder codes) will be lengthy, but likely for human use only a subset, a
name plus a \'tail number\' will be common eg: \'This is Beowulf FT3465E,
requesting Highport Control clearance for docking at hangar
three-seven-niner-zed. Over\'

Another one left mostly up to the referee.

 I have heard this too, but was unsure where, so I haven\'t mentioned it yet.
Glad to see someone shares a part of reality with me. ;)

Further, I heard that this semi-aquatic nature probably evolved from the
habitat being flooded, the bipedal aspect raising the "intakes" above the
surface of the water. And the vocal chords had something to do with
volutarily holding ones breath. The flooding also explains hair loss, as the
article I read this in said something about other hairless (nearly) mammals
were all semi-aquatic at some point in their evolution. ISTR there weren\'t
many species that fit that bill either

Aye aye! And I love the examples you gave, but even though I am the one who
started this (sorta, with help), and I came down firmly in the Pro-piracy
camp (as in believing it happens, not being one), I think I should clarify
my position.

By the end of your thread, you have implied a strong possibility of piracy
as a vocation. I doubt this is viable anywhere *in* the 3I, or even most of
the borders. Vagyr Extents are another story, but otherwise I see piracy
mainly as a crime of opportunity, not a career choice.

A mercenary company heads out to Jump point after completing their
assignment on a TL8 world. Coming in is a Fartrader with light armament (to
the Merc. POV), and somehow the Merc. Captain determines the cargo as
valuable. Extremely. No Naval vessels nearby. Out of range of the sensors of
the primary world. Gee, Captain, I don\'t even see a moniter sat, can we take
her? Please?

Just thinking.

That\'s a *different* Harrison trilogy. He\'s written a *lot* of books. 

The "hero" in all three "Deathworld" books is a guy named Jason dinAlt.

My dog\'s hair is lying the same way, but she simply keeps her
spine/limbs in different directions _most_ of the itme :-)

I saw in one of my wife\'s embryology books that hair swirl patterns
on babies are used to diagnose certain congenital defects.

I would be willing to put my archive directories from those games

	From a personal point of view I agree. It\'s also psychological. The
inward focus of the Cyberpunk vs the outward expansion focus of the 3I.
I can imagine a future of the 3I where the borders have all been closed,
and everyone begins to display the unhealthy tendencies of the
Cyberpunks

	They never developed the jump drive, but are TL 11/14 (or higher). This
would be a nasty scenario. And if they could import their Network
functionality off planet, it may well be a repeat of the Solomani system
vs 1I.

One, wouldn\'t WE be subspecies of erectus/ergaster? ;-)

Regardless of semantics--actually, a lot of systematics IS just
semantics. The problem that was pointed out is that a simple
definition of "species" is really impossible if you are not limited
to extant forms. Fact is that we\'re forced to deal with most species
being long dead, so fossils are gonna be the source of differences.

I agree (being a lumper myself, I guess) that many things have been
labeled as different that shouldn\'t be. The ole error bar of
individual variation makes that pretty likely using bones alone.

In paleontology the species labels have as much use as simple labels
as they do for attempts to explain relatedness as far as I can
see--in other words useful when talking to others, you say "A. boisei,"
and I have a picture in my head of the critter. Where it stands in
the scheme of things is a whole nother ball-o-wax. Same is true for
erectus. Regardless of how he relates to H. sapiens, I know what
rough kind of critter is being talked about.

Hell, the same specimen could well get a different label for each
species definition. H. erectus is can be distinguished by bones,
it\'s a species. If H. erectus could interbreed successfully with H.
sapiens (if it were possible to actually test) then it ISN\'T a
species break, etc.

Good book!  And, not-Travellerish is how I\'d describe it.

How about the new Solar Queen books from Norton and co-writers? Are they worth

  Especially if you can get RAFM\'s TNE ships then the ERTL (IIRC) Space:
1999 Moonbase Alpha model can make for a small port - the Eagle pads are
about the right size for a Type S lead mini (or even a Beachball!), and 
you can have real fun with doing up stats for the half-dozen included
Eagles in ~1:1200 scale, and then get 15mm mini\'s and the larger (~7"?)
Eagle model too!

  25mm isn\'t too badly supported either - you can still find RAFM / TNE
stuff, and Stone Mountain Miniatures has a figure line that\'s true 25mm 
dead-ringers for Zho\'s - and includes "Warbots"!

This is one of my first experiments with _First In_, and I like the results.

Rolling orbital placements, I did have to fiddle with the innermost orbit
and Bode constant to get a world solidly in the habital zone.  Imagine my
surprise when I got two worlds in the zone!

My only stumbling blocks using _FI_ to detail worlds was figuring out how
to do fourth roots on my calculator and getting the book to lie flat.  The
latter was solved by a quick trip to Kinkos for a chop job and page
protectors, the former by experimentation.

One thing I really liked was the Social Parameters.. they really helped me
envision the world\'s society.. in Wardn\'s case, we have a very open,
tolerant, non-aggressive people.  Police on Wardn would probably be armed
with net guns, slippery spray and the like, and carrying a deadly weapon,
or aggressive behavior would be met with utter horror.

Projecting further, I can now justify Wardn being listed as independent in
_Behind The Claw_.  Wardn is an open world, free for anyone to visit.  The
Sword Worlds conquered it once, and the entire population held a sit down
strike.  Since a neutral world can be an asset, the Imperium has decided
that Wardn isn\'t worth incorporating.. yet.

*Grin* ..it just struck me.. this could be a world full of hippies!  The
ultimate bastion of Political Correctness!  A clever (sadistic) Referee
could have immense fun with this aspect of the culture.

They aren\'t necessarily more massive than jupiter; many of the ones found
so far are, but that\'s a selection effect (big planets are easier to find).
There should be about as many low-mass (Saturn or below) close-in
gas giants. Those would be skimmable in theory, but in practice, the
1000K temperatures in their atmospheres would strain a ship\'s ability
to radiate away waste heat. (Unless the ship had excess radiator
capacity - one might allow ships with some class of IR masking (EMM in
TNE, Advanced Masking in FF2, or its GURPS equivalent) to have a
chance of surviving.

Nope, you\'re thinking of the same author\'s "To the Stars" trilogy
- - Homeworld, Wheelworld, Starworld.  Hero Jan Kulozhik.  

"Deathworld" I never knew if any of the books were released with
other titles (Deathworld, Deathworld II, Deathworld III; I have
the combined mass paper edition). Hero Jason dinAlt.

    So, Doug, my man, what you are saying is the Ditzie is a junkie?  Come
on.  Lets have a reality check, I have a 10 yo niece I take care of one
weekend out of the month, and she is hyper-intelligent & she does not talk
like this.  And, if Ditzie has a speech problem, they would have gotten her
treatment by now.

Yep! THe author has allowed certain authorized writers to continue the
adventures. Haven\'t read all of them yet, but the first couple
non-Norton books have been pretty good. I feel they are very much in the
Traveller vein. Most of the differences are in technology, but even the
hyperdrive they use has started to act more like jump in the newer
series. 

The Freetrader vs. Corperate traders theme has some interesting
possiblities. Of course it is more acute in the Norton universe where
scouts and freetraders "sell" the information on newly explored worlds,
and there is government sponsored monopolies of trade that can be
purchased. I\'ve lifted a couple of these ideas into MTU.

Humm, does this sound like I\'m a bit of a fan? ;*>

Sure are!  New to me anyway, _Derelict For Trade_ and _Mind For
Trade_, Andre Norton and Sherwood Smith.  There\'s a third one too,
but it wasn\'t in the bookstore and I don\'t have it\'s name.  The
backcover blurb on _Derelict..._ sounded really good.

Heck, it soundedjust like the sort of thing I\'d through at a ship of

I hadn\'t heard of this Sherwood Smith fellow, so I was a little
leary of plonking down six bucks a pop.  However, I think I\'ll get
the Derelict one tomorrow and see what I think.

    Ah, a fellow heritic.  Look, I have read her families stuff & while they
maybe strange, is that the only gimic they have for her?  The speech paterns
of a 4 year old?  I have a 4 yo little daughter & she talks like Ditize, now
if Ditzie was a 4 yo, it would make sense, but Jesse\'s fine picture of her,
has her at about 10 yo, +/- 2 years.

There are a couple of canonical examples of ship\'s registry numbers; the
Beowulf\'s is one of these. Unfortunately, none of them are in the same format.

In GT: Far Trader, therefore, we said that ship\'s registries (a document,
like an ID for a ship) are issued by individual worlds rather than the
Imperium itself. The format varies from world to world, but the type of
information -- including some form of registration number -- is specified
by Imperial regulations. This parallels the process for individual
identification documents, as outlined in GT.

[In other words: it\'s up to the GM, just as others have said.]

I think the order that the new ones were writen in is "Redline the
Stars", "derilict for Trade" and "Mind for Trade". The first book is a
bit slower thatn the Norton novels but has a neat plot to use on
players. The second book has some nice stuff too, including a darn good
discription of a trade startion/space habitat. Haven\'t read the third
yet. I think books 2 and 3 are more closely related to each other than
to 1, so if you can get those 2 it shouldn\'t spoil the first for you too
much!

It\'s supposed to be a *joke*, this mighty interstellar corporation, and the

We could of course, be sternly realistic about it, since science fiction
has never featured pre-teen girls who were smarter than the norm, and spoke

Ditzie a junkie?  Guess that makes everyone whose ever popped caffeine

Greetings from Whanga,

Everyone has kindly informed me where I should be purchasing my Trav
materials, and their advice is correct.  However, where I live, there is no
"Friendly Local Gaming Store".  There is a gas station about 20 miles from
my house.  There is even a place to buy groceries about 40 miles away.  But
the nearest FLGS is over four hours drive, one way.

This is why I ask about online outlets.  There must be other people in
similar (NI, Ag, E-class) backwaters as myself.  The internet (and
UPS/FedEx) is my main source for purchasing items other than groceries or
gasoline.  I don\'t even have a choice for my ISP (small independant local
telco w/ old equipment)-- I had to go into business (a co-op, of sorts) with
other locals just to create our own ISP!  Not even the ubiquitous AOL can be
had out here (this is a feature, not a bug, btw).  So I just dropped $85 at
Warehouse 23 and another $50 at Titangames.com.

Other areas of interests have their own stores --  both real(tm) retail
stores and virtual(tm) website mail order stores.  I make my living
recording and producing digital audio.  There must be fifty online sites
where I can buy (at wholesale discount $$) various and sundry products for
my studio, from $3k tube microphones to .99-cent RCA adapters, to LVD RAIDs.
Hell, I have done my part for the e-commerce market: I\'ve nearly gone
through five figures in a week upgrading my DAW, all online.  But for RPGs,
there isn\'t a lot to actually purchase online -- a lot of resources and
information, but not much I can get with a Visa card and have shipped to me.

SJ Games has a reasonable online pricing policy (to protect their FLGS), but
it is also an unnecessary penalty for those of us out here in the sticks (or
mountains or swamps or ice-caps) who happen to enjoy a rousing game of
Traveller now and then.

I wish there were game dealers out there who would put up a website, list
the products they have (or can get), and have a credit card form right there
for me to use.  If any FLGS wanted to provide shipping out to Whanga, I\'d be
a customer.  And I think many other Whangoids would, as well.

    'body' => 'Before \'First In\', Traveller planetary generation often created
small worlds with substantial atmospheres.
	Could these be explained as incomplete terraforming efforts (in
the Imperial campaign, by either the Ancients <least preferable 
option>, the First Imperium, the Rule of Man or the 3I)?
	I recall that Leonard Erickson noted in a discussion on
gravitic construction a month or two ago that a body the size and
mass of Earth\'s moon *could* support an Earth standard atmosphere
for a couple of million years or so, time enough for humanity to
florish and eventually become extinct on the world.
	The tech level scales in \'First In\' are the first that I\'ve
seen that make limited Vilani or ROM terraforming possible (much more
likely than the \'traditional\' sequences).

TTL	First In			MT
8	crude ecoremediation		early weather control*
9	limited terraforming (slight change to atmo/hydro?)
12	ecosystem reconstruction	\'major terraforming\'**
14	ecopoiesis [biosphere construction]
15	\'radical terraforming\'		\'complex terraforming\'

* common to both scales
** refined weather control tech common to both scales

	Given that the First Imperium lasted for over 10 millenia, I
would have thought that population and resource pressures [only a
small fraction of the matter and energy of a solar system is
exploitable at TTLs 9-11] may have been sufficient for the Ziru Sirka
to try limited terraforming, or build large artificial habitats on or
around otherwise hostile worlds (especially those systems on jump
mains, given the jump-2 limit).
	The ROM only lasted a few centuries. In the early days of the
Terran expansion into space, some experimentation with terraforming
or ecological engineering must have occurred ; but the incentive to
do so was probably less than that of the ZS. 
	[This ignores the crash programs in the Interstellar Wars 
period where bolt holes were being constructed to preserve the
proto-Solomani in the event of the Terran Confederation being
\'steamrollered\' by the First Imperium.]
	In the 3I era, worlds low in population but high in TL and
starport rating could be \'construction\' sites, or worlds that
became marginal during the Long Night that were being \'eco-remediated\'
with TTL 13-15 techniques.

UWP X6B0000-0
	Zeta 2 is a harsh, if not hellish, world by human standards.
The average surface temperature is 40 degrees Celsius. The atmosphere is
a thick yellow-orange soup of nitrogen, sulphur and fluorine compounds,
with surface atmospheric pressure a crushing eight times that of Terra
or Vland.
	The Zeta system is very unusual in that the abundance of
fluorine and sulphur are far above the average for Charted Space.
The relative excess of fluorine over oxygen is so marked on Zeta 2
that hydrogen fluoride plays the role that water does on more
"human friendly" worlds. Sixty percent of the world\'s surface is
covered with [relatively shallow] oceans of HF.
	The crust and mantle of the planet is predominantly made
up of silicon fluoride, hydroxyapatites, flurosilicates, 
thiosilicates and metal sulphates. Volcanism and plate tectonics are
present, but to a lesser extent than most rocky-metallic worlds due to
a lack of iron in the planet\'s mantle.
 	Due to this and the accelerated rate of erosion driven by the
corrosive properties of the atmosphere and abundant liquid HF, Zeta 2\'s
land surface is largely flat, scored by gullies and ancient riverbeds,
and punctuated with the odd chain of rolling hills or the very
infrequent tectonically or volcano-driven mountain chain.
	These aspects of Zeta 2\'s peculiar geology and
\'hydrology\' seized the interest of the research division of the Railen
Institute, a think tank set up by some of the "second-tier" mining
companies of the Spinward Marches.
	Much to the surprise of the research teams that have surveyed
the planet, life exists in these harsh conditions. Even more
surprising is that intelligence has independently arisen on Zeta 2.
	Lifeforms here are biochemically based on silicone polymers
dissolved in hydrogen fluoride. Metabolic processes depend on the
transformation of sulphur compounds for energy and play an important
part in the cycling of sulphur between atmosphere, biosphere, ocean
and rock.
	Zetan ecology is based on on two broad groups of producers.
The first exploit the temperature gradient between the atmosphere and
the deeper layers of soil. The larger \'temperate\' varieties with their
irregular conical forms bear a passing resemblance to the nests of
certain Earthly species of ants and termites.
	The second type relies on an analog of photosynthesis, with
a blue-green magnesium based pigment capturing wavelengths in the near
infrared, and resemble horsetails.
	Zeta 2\'s high surface atmospheric pressure has led to the
development of \'superhumid\' biomes, where HF partial pressures can
reach a standard atmosphere in certain \'tropical\' areas.
	These locales of superhumidity have been variously termed
\'steam jungles\', \'steam sponges\', \'steam reefs\' and \'steam caves\' by
the Railen Institute researchers.
	Steam jungles look much like a tropical rain forest, with large
numbers of producers and consumers forming multiple layered habitats.
Here, the \'conoid\' producers sport radiator vanes and panels to limit
their heat absorption, covered with a fine network of circulatory
vessels to enhance heat transfer. These vanes also serve a respiratory
and feeding function in some species (gas exchange and trapping aerial
plankton - or unwary larger animals).
	Steam sponges are based in nutrient rich areas. Producer 
density is very high, with loss of the floor-mid-levels-canopy
differentiation of the steam forest. (a banyan tree with a higher 
density of trunks?).
	Steam reefs are similar to coral reefs, dominated by short
area producers and a diverse range of \'aerial plankton\'.
	Steam caves are an oddity. Based in low valleys, sink holes and
cavern systems, the humidity levels are so high that the walls are 
covered with vibrant communities of producers and consumers, the latter
often building slime towers or webs into the central space.
	The closest terrestrial equivalent might be a sewer pipe or an
animal gut.
	Very large animals are found only in the oceans. On land, no
consumers bigger than a kilogram have been found ; insect-like forms
dominate.
	The Viji are the intelligent natives of Zeta 2. Their
ancestors were creatures similar to the bees or wasps of Earth. \'Each\'
Viji is actually a hive made up of millions of tiny (0.1g) winged
insect-like creatures that communicate to each other with a 
combination of pheromones and weak electric currents.
	Each creature retains some small part of the knowledge and memories of
the whole. Viji live either in underground burrows, steam caves, or in
the surface parts of the larger conoids.
	Reproduction is hormonally regulated by a caste of \'controllers\'
which ensures that the hive has enough members to maintain
sentience. New Viji are formed either by parthenogenesis or \'sexually\'
by coalescence of swarms.
	The entire \'hive\' takes flight every few days, gathering plant
and animal matter on which to feed. 
	It has been estimated that only a few thousand Viji exist,
their technological advancement limited to the hunter-gatherer
stage. (There is no evidence of large communities or agricultural
activity on Zeta 2).
	Considerable interest in the Viji has been expressed by the
financiers of the Railen Institute, given their suitability to certain
hostile environment surveying applications and mesoscale device
fabrication.
	The system is currently [as of 1116] being reviewed by the IISS with a
view to Red Zoning it to protect these peculiar sophonts.

Constructive criticism welcome.

Brr... a bit cold for love-ins? (281K is the average maximum
temperature in the \'temperate\' zone, from G:Space/\'First In\'). Things
might not be too bad in the \'tropics\' there (\'Earth normal\' climate

Yes! They\'re a little more adult in writing style and I enjoyed them a lot.

I didn\'t want to say so explicitly in the book, but this seems
to me to be a very reasonable handwave to "explain" all those
worlds with oxynitrogen atmospheres in the OTU.

I can imagine a lot of Vilani colonies working across centuries to
improve local conditions.  Admittedly the Vilani weren\'t terribly
good at bioscience, but that would just have slowed them down,
it wouldn\'t have stopped them.  They were certainly good at large-
scale physical engineering, and they tended to take a very long
view.  Major terraforming at GTL 9 takes a long time, but the First
Imperium *had* a long time.

Certainly true.  The First In rules assume that no terraforming has
taken place, so if a world is to have a breathable atmosphere it must
be such that it can retain one over very long periods.  It has to be
large enough, naturally warm enough (but not too warm), have native
life forms, and so on.  If there\'s been an interstellar civilization around
for thousands of years, it makes sense to assume that many marginal
worlds have been made habitable.

We\'ve now got a better understanding of what might be involved in
terraforming than did the authors of Classic Traveller (or the WBH,
for that matter).  It looks a lot more practical, if you have interstellar-
level technology and a lot of time to work.

  IIRC, Titan Games carries both new & used (I assume that you purchased 
the latter from them?); they will order just about anything currently in
the distribution system, and their standard discount on new items is 30%
off MSRP. Even if you have some strange urge to order Games Workshop figs
with extra Big Spiky Bitz I imagine that they would supply those too at 
below GW mail-order prices.

What are these formats? In context, could they be explained as regional or

Well, I can think of at least two reasons why this thread has not
attracted the same attention as p****y:

1.  The topic of unorthodox Terran sexual practices has not been the
subject of interminable debates, with both sides quoting canon and logic
(as supports the poster\'s position).

2.  It wouldn\'t surprise me if some posters in this thread had a
voyeuristic interest in the subject.

Of these two suggested reasons, I suspect that Reason #1 is more
important.  I leave to the student any calculations concerning the
relative interests of the average Traveller player....

I figure that any discussion of the nature of Traveller player is
on-topic....

I suppose that you would have to get into the psychology of the crime of
piracy and what kind of support structure is available. To use an historical
example Port Royal in the Caribbean, functioned as a safe haven for years.
What I suggest is that if the perceived risk is low and the profit margin
high people with a criminal bend will drift into it looking for that one big
score and stay in it until their luck runs out.


I suspect that no criminal ever really expects to get caught.  We had a
troopie back when the 3rd Armored Cav was in El Paso who robbed a
convenience store at lunch one fine day.  He was very surpassed when they
came and arrested him.  Should not have been, he robbed the store wearing
his uniform.  We were the only unit on post wearing black berets and wide
cav belts with big brass belt buckles.  Since his name tag was on his chest
when he did the deed he was even easier to find.

Like another respondent wrote, I too see piracy
mainly as a crime of opportunity especially at the "able spaceman level",
not a career choice, but crime is a slippery path that is much easier to go
down than to come back up especially if you are, like most criminals, not
very bright or hooked on drugs.

The brains behind a really clever operation, one step or more removed from
the nitty gritty, are the real career criminals and their risk is far lower.

    No, but make her speak less like a 4 year old & more like a 10 year old.
To be honest, she should grow & change.  I.e. her speech patterns should
change as she gets older.

    In a way, yes, if you cannot get through the day without it.  Maybe she
could talk fast.  Hell, if she is wired on caffeine, she could still have a
distinctive speech patern, without sounding like a 4 yo.

Yep.  That\'s the idea.

Here\'s a quick plot outline, using stuff from various recent threads:

Some nasty little individual has managed to hack the computers on an
Imperial ship, downloading a lot too much information about jump drives. 
The PCs must recover the data before the locals work out what they\'ve got.

Locations:  New Berkeley, Equitorial Republic.  The hacker starts of hiding
in the neighbourhood run by the Naked People.  The players stick out like
sore thumbs, especially since the NPs use *very* obvious
cyber-enhancements!  The PCs probably won\'t get into a shootout here,
unless they\'re dumb, but will have a hard time getting the information they
need.  

This will lead them to the New Berkeley campus of the Equitorial
University.  This place, amongst other things is one of the big infotech
centres of the world.  It is also the location of significant military
research centres, and a Psi Institute, if you feel like it.  There\'s also a
regular ongoing level of student unrest (why not?). 

So the PCs get to get caught up in some unrest (teargas, anyone?), have to
duck high tech security, and generally have a frustrating time.  But of
course, what they\'re looking for isn\'t all there, and they have to go on to
the next location.....

Vargrtown!  Use lots of "Chinatown" cliches here.  If PCs can\'t get into
trouble here, they caught the wrong bus, and are somewhere else.....

By naked eye (glasses adjusted, not terrific vision) I can resolve
a sub-1 meter object a mile away (1600m or so) and clearly make out 1.5m
tall 4-5m long cars (see the windows, tires, etc, which are 0.5m or
so parts).  If we apply the same criteria to sailing ships (60m long,
45m tall sails as a random guess) then the distance should be 20-30 times
further, or 20-30 miles (30-45 km).

The distance to the horizon is a distinct problem, however.
At sea level you can only see 4-5 miles before small objects drop
below the curvature.  From 350 feet (~105 meters) altitude at
one particular point I stand at and look out to sea a lot
(the top gate to my family place in Marin County, California...)
you can see around 20 miles (nearly, but not quite, to the Farrallon
islands offshore).

There are tables of horizon distance versus planet size out
there somewhere, I remember seeing them.

They aren\'t necessarily more massive than jupiter; many of the ones found
so far are, but that\'s a selection effect (big planets are easier to find).
There should be about as many low-mass (Saturn or below) close-in
gas giants. Those would be skimmable in theory, but in practice, the
1000K temperatures in their atmospheres would strain a ship\'s ability
to radiate away waste heat. (Unless the ship had excess radiator
capacity - one might allow ships with some class of IR masking (EMM in
TNE, Advanced Masking in FF2, or its GURPS equivalent) to have a
chance of surviving.

I think that the ships with the better radiators would be at a disadvantage
here. If the outside temperature is hotter than the radiators they will tend
to work in reverse and conduct all that heat into the interior of the ship.

This is basically what happened to the Motie ships in the Mote in Gods Eye
when their ships reentered normal space inside a red giant star. Their super
expanding langston field became a very efficient collector of energy.

Eris

Believe it or not the table of horizon distances was in the basic TNE rule
book, don\'t know how accurate they are though.

Also for tall ships the sighting distance can be greater due to the mark 1
sensor sitting near the top of each mast. On some ships this could place the
sailor above low fogs, canon smoke etc which would allow the early canon
some chance of indirect fire, though their effective ranges are quite short.

There are a *lot* of factors involved. First off, the distance to the
horizon is determined by the curvature of the planet. Therefore it
depends on the size of the planet. It also depens on how far above the
"average surface" you are. And finally, the atmosphere bends light so
that you can see a little bit *around* the curve of the planet. This
depends (for gaming purposes) on the density/thickness of the
atmosphere. 

For a quick & dirty answer, ignoring atmospheric refraction...

The horizon is the point at which your line of sight is *tangent* to
the surface of the (assumed perfect) sphere. That means that your line
of sight forms a *right angle* with a line running to the center of the
sphere that that point. 

This means we\'ve got a right triangle to work with. One side is the
radius of the planet. Another is the distance from your eyes to the
horizon (straight line, not measured around the curve). we know 2 of
the sides, so we can get the third via Pythagoras\'s theorem: a^2+b^2=c^2.

In our case:

a = radius of planet
b = distance to horizon.
c = radius of planet plus observer\'s altitude

r^2 + d^2 = (r+a)^2
r^2 + d^2 = r^2 + 2ra + a^2
d^2 = 2ra + a^2

Let\'s try a world with an 8000 km radius, and a 2 meter altitude.

d^2 = 2*8e6*2 + 2^2
d^2 = 32,000,004
d = 5657 m

> My swag is 5 to 10 km. How far off am I?

Looks like you are fairly close.

You can also try this:

The distance *along* the curvature of the planet is:

Angle between line R and line R+A is arccos((r+a)/r). So the distance
along the curvature is (2*pi*r)/(arcos((r+a)/r)/360). This assumes you
are using degrees. If you are using radians, then replace 360 with 2*pi.

Given the abundance of flurine required to have the HF, I can\'t quite
see how any sulphate/sulfide compounds can survive? Id expect them to
long ago have been converted to metal fluorides and sulfur difluoride.

Still not sure this would work, give all the fluorine around.

IR-based photosynthesis? I can see that for working with sy\\ulfur
compounds, but not for dealing with all the fluorides.

The red zoning could be nearly self-enforcing, given what that
environment could do to a ship. :-)

Or they could be like the culture in the last story in Eric Frank
Russell\'s "The Great Explosion". A whole world based on mutual
obligations and passive resistance. Their "motto":

In other words, freedom consists of being able to say no.

If a bunch of villians get on to my free trader whilst it is in port.
(By bribing security, having friends in the crew or just being downright
 sneaky)
Then, for little outlay they could fly off in a starship and sell it.

I can see the cost/benefit here.

On the other hand, if they are going to use a 100MCr ship to raid me in
space, then I have to ask the simple question - why don\'t they just sell
the pirate ship?

If they are going to use a cheaper ship (eg a 100 year old free trader)
then sooner or later they will meet something with enough guns and
a lucky shot that gives them the sort of bad day that you just don\'t
recover from.

Thinks...

I know the arguement against KKMs, but what about an anti-piracy missile?

The APM would be short ranged, very high G, designed to cripple an
attacker of up to 1,000dt in a single shot and capable of being mounted
in a standard turret. It further needs to be able to hit its target
in less time than the target can respond - say 1 second.

Is this possible?

Approximate generic formula for distance to a flat horizon for a standing
adult human varying by world size:

(3220000 * U)^0.5 metres

Where U is the World Size digit.

A more complete formula is:

(See the attached diagram)

d=(h^2 + 2hr)^0.5

Where:
d = distance to horizon
h = observer\'s height above ground
r = planetary radius

Make sure all units are the same!



We had to figure this out when a couple of my characters wanted to know of
they could send a line of sight microwave transmission to the planetary
downport by climbing a nearby mountain (turned out the mountain was about
10km too short!)

Are you saying that the first free trader registered in the Regina System 
in 1088 would be A-SMRE-1088-0001 and the first scout registered in
the Regina System in 1088 would be S-SMRE-1088-0001 ? 

I like this idea, but would (1) extend the Vehicle Classification to two
positions and (2) declare that the Unique identifier are not used in
any particular order - as they are "pre-assigned" in blocks to the
subsector shipyards several years in advance of the year that they
represent and (3) 9000 series numbers are reserved for military
vessels.

"Ooh ooh Cap\'n Cap\'n  They have this nifty new missile out, the Dragonfire
APM, means anti-piracy missile! Supposed to be one shot crippler up to 1000dt!
We should get some of these, that way we can stop knocking off these dinky far

"Yaar, _anti_ piracy missile! Ho ho ho! That\'s a laugh and a half, me hearties!!"

Why yes, it\'ll make a _very_ fine _piracy_-missile, too, and certainly make
that odd spur of the moment property redistribution much easier.

Actually, the ideal anti-boarding missile, which is what you mean, I think,
wouldn\'t go in the missile turret. The moment it moved they\'d be shot by the
opposing ship. What you want is something that sits like a limpet on the ships
hull so it isn\'t noticed until it\'s fired, which is, of course, too late.
Stick a bunch of these
on the hull in different facings and you\'ld be set.

Basic, number-one reason that pyrates exist is in _every_ ship design I\'ve
ever seen: they are _all_ armed. 

Period. 

The only one that isn\'t is the x-boat. In fact, when I first posted the
designs for my Yugobox cheapo free trader, I got all sorts of flak for putting
up an under-armored, un-gunned ship.

Spending lots of hard-earned cash on lasers and missiles, having to deadhead a
gunner along everywhere you go, and sacrificing cargo space for a turret and
it\'s requisite power, mfd etc etc is economically stupid, unless it\'s needed.

The way it was described to me (after I blew it the first time), was that
indeed it was meant as a joke.  She\'s this hyper-intelligent, very young
girl with a speech impediment, almost no restraint whatsover :), and she
happens to be the chief R&D designer for a company that makes some SERIOUS
hardware.  And she was on "something", but I can\'t remember what it was

	As has already been pointed out, the aquatic ape theory is
	not taken seriously by evolutionary biologists.  It amounts
	to a "just so" story: with a little effort we can always come
	up with ways to make our observations fit a theory.  Humans
	actually evolved partly underground, with only our heads 
	above.  The \'naked mole rat\' is a subterranian mammal that,
	like us, has little hair (our head retained hair as it stayed 
	above ground).  Research has shown that children feel better
	when they are hugged, because they still retain their ancestral
	discomfort with being out of the soil in free air.  Mud baths
	still improve human skin health.  When people are afraid, our
	natural reaction is to lay down close to the ground and hide.

Well, for a reasonably designed radiator, probably not.  However, any 
radiator has to operate at a temperature higher than the surrounding
medium, so radiators designed for emissions masking (which presumably
run fairly cool) would be less effective than normal radiators.

  Cost of market entry isn\'t an issue? Surely the economics of sustaining

I just moved to closer to the Bay Area, so I am trying to find any game

I\'m still catching up on three days at drill, so, if somebody else
answered this, sorry for wasting your time....

_Homeworld_ is, IIRC, part of the "To The Stars" trilogy, which, like
"Deathworld", was written by Harry Harrison.

To be honest, I was surprised by the postings on the topic. The stereo-type
of gamers is usually fat/skinny comp/sci/tech male caucasian nerd. Kiri is
obviously *not* male. There are quite a few folks on the list in science or
technology fields, thank goodness. Their input is invaluable in this type of
game, as opposed to AD&D and such.Although someone did mention AD&D

Anyway, to depart the "offensive" topic, how many on the list believe they
diverge from the stereo-type? Myself, well, I am a country boy, have a
three-mile driveway,I got good grades in school until I read a laymans
explanation of Einsteins Theory of Special and General Relativity. I am a
landscaper, caucasian, male, thirty years old, and have been gaming since I
was fifteen or so. I am an only child, raised by my Grandparents. My aunt
calls me a "second generation hippy" as psychologically I am more like a
Baby-boomer than Gen X.

Funny...here in Louisiana, our ceiling is often gray and leaky.  Hasn\'t

In real terms, I\'d say normally not unless you were trying to use it in very
specific cirsumstances.

(I\'m going to have to use TNE rules as a basis, because they\'re the ones
with the best-defined quantitative values that I own. Apologies to those of
you who prefer other systems - the same general arguments apply.)

If a pirate believes you are dead in the water and is closing to board
without opening fire, then perhaps. If you can get a 50 MT blast nuke to
within fifty metres of a ship, you can punch through AV-668 (In TNE terms;
about ten times as thick as the armour on a Midu Agashaam DD or a
Chrysanthemum DE). I think that\'s the only way you\'re likely to get a
one-shot cripple on a 1000dT ship, although KKMs might also work. I\'ll get
back to you on that.

To get it there fast enough is the hard part. Let\'s say a second is too fast
for pirate gunners to respond, acquire and return fire on manual control.
(We better hope they don\'t have an automatic CIWS system).  Now, even using
HEPlaR, probably the most high-powered missile propellent in the rules, I\'ve
never been able to generate more than a 30G missile. In one second, that
missile can cover 150 metres. And that\'s assuming the turret is pointing
right at him.

It\'s a pretty difficult system to emply, but far be it from me to say it
could never work.

Perhaps we should form a seperate, less stringent "Game Geek" mailing list.
I am not offended by this content, although I read the list to get Traveller
ideas, not alternative lifestyle info. I too would like this moved off-list,
as I have failed to bring it into a Trav vein. I tried.

But I would subscribe to such a list, and perhaps there we could discuss
other game topics that won\'t fit in this or other existant lists. Or is
there a list out there already? I am thinking "Adults only", although not
just because of sexual content. I think there are many topics (ie: sex,
narcotics, violence, crime, etc.) that should preclude a younger audience,
and although I like kids, I am not one, so there is a limit on "shared
interests".

I would also like to see such a list be somewhat generic concerning game
system. Possible topics to discuss:

Game Session Dynamics: How many arbiters in your game? Do you use a team
leader to call out actions? How many folks does it take for a good game?
What are the rules of ettiquette? How should one handle Munchkins?

Lifestyles of the Bored and Geeky: A study in gaming furniture, costumes,
props, and Gaming Conventions. Demographics of gamers, recipes for munchies,
book reviews, etc.

Help & Humour: Tips, jokes, product alerts, recent events of interest,
personal gaming anecdotes, etc. Of course this is an area that might justify
cross-posting.

Contacts & Personals: "I live "here", can you game with me?" I see alot of
this on the TML, and it always bums me. I get all excited and hopeful, then
I find out the poster is in Florida or something. PBEM I know nothing about,
and won\'t post queries here, as I have to many that are not Traveller
oriented, and are probably "basics". I won\'t waste your time.

Any other ideas? Anyone agree we could use a less specific Gamers List?

Stones Throw Shipyards announce the launch of their new range of Space
Interceptor Missiles. Designed to the highest standards to give you outstanding
performance at a price that will blow you away.

The models presented below represent the cutting edge of missile technology. We
are confident that this is a price/performance package you will not be able to
beat.

The very latest models are only available directly from us. All other models are
manufactured under licence by local shipyards. See your local starport hardware
agent for our nearest facility or second source manufacturer in your sector.

In the unlikely event that the missiles here fail to match you requirements, we
also supply custom missiles made to order.

New Missiles

Standard GURPS Traveller Space Interceptor Missiles (SIMs) are 6 cubic feet, 300
lbs. They cost 32 KCr for the GTL10 version and 22 KCr for the GTL 12 version.
They are also multi-role and can be used in atmosphere as well as in space.

There are design errors in their construction, but the thing that causes the
most mass, space and cost is the streamlining, for atmosphere use. Though of
course the real reason for their design is to match established traveller canon.

Using GURPS Vehicles it is possible to construct cheaper, faster and smaller
single-role Space Interceptor Missiles for GT, that cannot be used in
atmosphere. All the following designs are currently for space only missiles.

TL8 Space Interceptor Missiles:

0.5G Missile, 475 lb, 7.4 cf, Cr 24,350.
Powered range 20,000 miles, Maximum terminal velocity 11 miles per second.

TL9 Space Interceptor Missiles:

2.0G Missile, 475 lb, 7.3 cf, Cr 44,300.
Powered range 81,000 miles, Maximum terminal velocity 45 miles per second.

TL10 Space Interceptor Missiles:

10.0G Missile, 200 lb, 3.0 cf, Cr 9,000.
Powered range 365,000 miles, Maximum terminal velocity 200 miles per second.

TL11 Space Interceptor Missiles:

21.0G Missile, 180 lb, 3.0 cf, Cr 13,000.
Powered range 850,000 miles, Maximum terminal velocity 475 miles per second.

TL12 Space Interceptor Missiles:

22.0G Missile, 170 lb, 3.0 cf, Cr 13,000.
Powered range 900,000 miles, Maximum terminal velocity 500 miles per second.

TL13 Space Interceptor Missiles:

100.0G Missile, 125 lb, 1.8 cf, Cr 61,000.
Powered range 1,800,000 miles, Maximum terminal velocity 1,500 miles per second.

Design Notes:

All designed using Gurps Vehicles, with GT restrictions applied, using
appropriate TL components. They are stealthed, laser guided, use Thruster Plates
& rechargeable batteries.

Uses minimum armor, one hit and they are toast anyway.

Uses medium frame regardless of G rating. I assume there is an upper limit to
how much acceleration a frame can take, but I cannot find any reference to it.

All are designed with a small amount of vectored thrust (usually one G) for high
speed manouverability and the remainder as non-vectored thrust. This saves a lot
of weight, and volume.

    'topic' => 'Cheaper GT Fuel Tanks',
    'body' => 'The standard GURPS Traveller fuel tanks are "ultralight self-sealing". These are
very expensive though relatively light. The assumption from GURPS Space is that
the light weight of the tanks offsets their costs by reducing the need for very
expensive thrusters. 

Unfortunately this is not true. It may be true at GTL9, but at GTL 10 the
thrusters are so powerful that is much cheaper to use standard tanks and have
extra thruster modules.

Ultralight self-sealing tanks are a fifth the weight, cost ten times as much and
are less safe than a standard tank. Figures for one DT of the various tanks are
(including fuel mass):

Tank type                Mass sTons  Cost MCr  Fire Risk  Use For 

Ultralight Self-Sealing     1.13       0.167      +1      TL9- craft
Standard                    1.80       0.017      -2      Commercial craft
Standard Self-Sealing       2.63       0.033      -3      Military craft

Using standard tanks make a significant difference to published designs. It
reduces their price tag considerably and increases the profitability of
commercial craft substantially. So if you are going to use this modification you
may need to adjust the shipping rates to compensate.

The most extreme example of the effect of this change is the 800 DT oiler in
GURPS Far Trader. Using a standard tank reduces the cost an 800 DT Oiler from
113 MCr to less than 30 MCr, with the same performance (i.e. more thrusters) and
only a 1% reduction in tankage.

Well,  ...the traditional point of entry into such a career was to sneak up
on your first victim in dugout canoes swarm on board and put every one who
doesn\'t immediately surrender to the sword.  That\'s how they did it in the
Caribbean in the late 16th, 17th and 18th centuries.  In the Indian Ocean
and the South China Sea they sneak up on unsuspecting commercial vessels in
the shipping lanes in power boats in the dead of the night.  The pirates
then swarm on board, put any one who resists to "the sword", bust open the
safe, steal everything portable of value, and disappear over the side.  The
technology over time changes but the MO is nearly the same.

Regarding sustaining the effort, if you have a safe base to operate from, an
infrastructure to dispose of the loot, a plentiful supply of victims and a
ready manpower pool to replace losses due to attrition you are in pirate
heaven.

How about a real twist, pirates working the border who specialize in ripping
off smugglers.  They show the signature of a patrol vessel or even a
"unmarked patrol vessel" and tell the victim to heave to.  They either board
without a fight or put the victim out of commission at close range where
close sensor scrutiny or even sight alone might unmask them.   If they get
on board without being unmasked they might even "impound" the cargo, order
the vessel to proceed to some specified port and make a clean get away.
Even if the victim figures the ruse out who is he going to complain to.

Lest you think the above is to far fetched to be played, I based it on real
life.  The actual case in the late 60\'s early 70\'s ran like this.  Mob
connected cigarette smugglers would fill their vans at the factory in North
Carolina.  It was legal to buy "in bulk" just illegal by the laws of the
neighboring state to run the cigs over the state line untaxed by that state.
As they were tooling down the interstate on their way to New York City and
other points metropolitan in Yankee land, along would come an "unmarked
patrol car"  which would pull them over as ATF.  The smugglers would pull
over, surrender and ultimately find themselves kicked loose on a back
country road victims of "the Dixie Mafia".  The feds got wind of what was
going on when things escalated, bodies started showing up and the rip off
artists turned out to be connected to white power types.

possible answers:

Because a) they can only sell the ship once, b) its probably got a "bad

I agree that the discussions of our personal lives and such do not belong on
the list.  There are things about me that I am just not ready to tell this
many strangers, which is why I\'ve said as little about my own practice as I
have.  I\'m already scared that I have frightened people off!

But what about the discussions of practices people might be into in the game
world-- are those offensive too?

narcotics, violence, crime, etc.) that should preclude a younger audience,

>
A discussion group for HANDLING such topics in games would be very cool -- I
can still remember discussions I had with guys in the 80\'s about "how to get
chicks to play games with you."

It was amazing to me that they hadn\'t realized that women were turned off to
the games (and to them) by events such as having female characters get raped
when captured, slavery of the Gorean variety in fantasy games, "rolling for
pregnancy" (I am sorry, but a culture that has effective technology, be it
scientific or magickal, is going to find a way to tackle this problem) and
other undignified things that frequently happened to female characters.

A common line I used:  "I don\'t care how realistic it is-- do you play these
games to experience reality?  Women have to deal with enough of this crap in
real life!"

Nor are a few of the other people on this list.  I am mostly white and pass

not a big gearhead.  I write SF stories and I loved playing CT in the early
80\'s.  Our campaign had a very space opera-ish feel.  I also once ran a
campaign using CT rules set in the universe that I write in.

Amen!  I am not into that stuff except very casually and I need the advice.

Actually I can\'t stand games like AD&D because I am an occultist; I did a
lot of graduate work in history of science/occult, which if you go back
prior to the Enlightenment are really the same thing.  If I were going to
play a fantasy game it would have to be a more realistic game system in
terms of the magickal arts.  Chaosium\'s system was a good approximation of
what actually happens in spellcasting, though there were additions in
Runequest, CoC and Stormbringer that were pure fantasy.

I\'m definitely urban wildlife.  I grew up in West Virginia but I loathed it
and I\'ve been moving steadily west since I got to be an adult.  Eventually
I\'ll probably stay put... either here, or in Tokyo.  SF and Tokyo are my two
favorite cities in the world.

I speak Japanese rather badly and I am quite active in anime fandom, where
depending upon my whim I am most often addressed as Mistress Tiamat or
kiri-chan.  Don\'t ask me why Mistress Tiamat, that is what started the whole
bdsm thread, for which I apologize to those who were offended!

You sure it\'s not that Traveller is "Yanks in Space (tm)" with a right to
bear weapons being fundamental.. but if you put all those weapons on a ship
someone is bound to use them... oh!  QED <grin, duck and run>

Spofulam Yards is the other big arm, run by Ditzie\'s Uncle Hengebar,

Ironically, all of this explains _why_ there\'s pirates (nice circular logic there).  If every ship is armed, some of them will start using those armaments. While being a pirate full-time is probably a good way to wind up dead (and probably not very smart even in the short run), if your fairly heavily armed trader comes across a weaker ship doing wilderness refueling in some back end of nowhere system, some people are going to be tempted.  Call it the starship equivalent of a mugging.

I wonder how useful Q-ships would be to the \'local constabulary\' types. If
the majority of pirate attacks are indeed opportunity strikes against
lightly-armed freighters, then occasional well-publicised Q-ship stings
(where the \'lightly armed freighter\' turns out to be a discreetly armed
gunboat) would introduce rather more hesitancy into the minds of easily
tempted captains.

Get hit by a 360lb man who runs 40 yards in a bit under 8 seconds and ask
me that.

BTW: Why do they call it Aussie Rules Football when from what I\'ve seen on

at least get a drink?

Interesting. I usually give the military a separate system.

I think he just meant that the runs wouldn\'t be perfectly sequential, since
blocks of numbers would be allocated to individual shipyards rather than
entire worlds.

I don\'t play Rugby any more, but that\'s what happens. (Okay, at school the

Ah.  Since most subsectors won\'t have that many active shipyards, I can see
this.

Bear in mind, most people tempted to piracy probably aren\'t terribly bright, and probably _do_ get caught, sooner or later (this is true of muggers as well).  Its probably just as effective as an anti-piracy measure to use a small stealthed gunship (which probably isn\'t going to be detected at any significant range by the sensors on a typical pirate ship) which spends a couple weeks idling in some lightly-patrolled area and then jumps to another one -- and if it sees a pirate, it blows the hell out of said pirate (if it can) or notes identifying information (if it\'s too far away).

Again, there is no "Imperial" view on these things.  On some planents such 
things would be abhorrent, in others common place.  THis is precisely the

No, it\'s because their mommies won\'t let them play *hockey*.

ObTrav:  Can you imagine hockey being played on a frozen hydrogen lake?  
Scarey, especially if you slip and fall on your cooling fins.  The heat sinks 
would tend to sublimate the frozen hydrogen with the force of a grenade...

If you\'re looking for the range at which you can see a target above ground
level, I think you add one more term to that equation so that it becomes 

d=(h1^2 + h2^2 + 2hr)^0.5

where h1 is the height of the observer and h2 is the height of the target. 
That looks right, but I\'m not a brilliant math person, so feel free to
correct as necessary.

Personally, those kinda details bore the hell out of me.  I\'m *MUCH* more 
interested in what kind of Traveller you play.

IIRC, Marc was saying something like, R-rated stuff doesn\'t really belong in 
Traveller, so he wasn\'t going to publish it that way, but he wasn\'t gonna 
tell a GM how to run their game, *unlike* Gary Gygax.  <grin>  I\'m sure 
*somebody* can correct me if I\'m mitaken here.

In Eris\' \'Akus Moby Treasure Hunt\' PBEM, they have a thing refered to as a \'fight bar\', where vargr go to hang out to do dominance fights and such.  My character, Kuzov, got suckered into a fight and had a *world* of fun.

Prob is, the food wasn\'t that great, and the beer kinda sucked.  <ducking>

Well, you can always shut the radiators down; and ships without radiators
will be at a significant disadvantage too; spend long enough in the giant
atmosphere (eg, long enough to skim) and you\'ll come to equilibrium with
it, which means your ship will be 1000 K (especially since you\'re bringing all
that nice hot hydrogen inside.)

Also - there\'s an implicit assumption in T4 that radiators at TL12+ are
working at around 2000K[1], through some Miracle Material (tm); so they\'d
still work inside a hot gas giant, if you had enough surface area to
compensate for reduced efficiency.

Bruce
[1] Please, please don\'t debate the realism or thermodynamic balance of this -
it was done to death on TTL[2]. The short summary is that (1) Radiating waste
heat at high temperature makes thermodynamic sense, and (2) If you want
Travelleresque million-dTon battleships with terawatt power plants, you need
radiators that are Pretty Damn Good.

Running cool helps somewhat with radiating waste heat, but so does
dumping all your waste heat into the one panel facing away from the
(single) enemy ship, which requires running extra-hot; I\'ve generally assumed
that emissions-masked radiators emphasize flexability above all else,
which helps a lot with dealing with unexpected situations, like skimming
out of a 1000-degree atmosphere.

Masking also explicitly includes the plumbing for cooling the hull, which is
a handy thing in the aforesaid unexpected sitguation.

I\'m not sure how to interpret this. The relevant number isn\'t so much "powered

as endurance; how many space-combat turns can it accelerate at 10G for?

Maneuverability is key for missiles, especially impact missiles, as they have

The Rugby Codes in Australia (Leauge and Union) are starting to wear more
armour (mainly cloth/padding helmets for the scrums and sholder pads).
Being less protected has led to the banning of some ugly tackling (head
high and spear [slamminghead head first into the ground]) but the tackling
tends to be more intense because the person with the ball is the only valid
person to be tackled, so it it not uncommon for defenders to gang up from 3
directions to get a guy. In a Union ruck and mall, it is not uncommon to
get kicked and scraped as defenders and attackers both pile over the top of
each other, using their feet to rip the ball aout of the maul.

The drinking comes afterwards, and if you are playing Rugby Leauge , it
never stops......
The Victorians call it football, the civilised part of the nations calls it
Aussie Rules. Ironicly, the game evolve from cricket, as it was developed
as a training method for cricketers during winter (hence it being played in
ovals).

>ObTrav: Those minor little cultural differences that can trip PCs up on

Gaelic and Australian football are strangly similar, given they play on
different fields, use different goals, and use different balls. Ireland and
Australia now play tests with a bastardisation of both rules to some
success.

Maybe OB: Characters form a sporting troop, who travel the mains in an
attempt to win prize money from different sports codes (al la the leauge /
union crossover). Elete sportspeople seem to be able to play different
sports extramly well (Alan Border , former Australian Cricket Captian
started his carreer playing baseball, That US sportsman who plays both
perfessional football and baseball and Micheal Jorden playing
golf/basketball/baseball). The chalange could be for the part to hit the
planet, try to adapt to local conditions and rules, and maybe try to do a
scam in the process (or bet on the outcome). They may be on perfomance
drugs banned on some worlds, they may have diretary problems (Shane Warne
in the Subcontenant getting an airlift of baked beans) or may perform
illegal actions on the field they may not know about.

Well there is good news.  Being from Kansas, I was horrified at the decision  
(I really didn\'t think they would be stupid enough to do it).  But the 
humiliation this has brought Kansas has unified the state like I\'ve never 
seen (This was really the first time creationism has reared it\'s ugly head 
here).  It looks like now the BOE will be disbanded and the state 
constitution changed. Polls are running about 2/3rds in agreeing that it was 
a stupid thing to do. Most local school boards are condemning the decision as 
well.  
I too, after this, believe that man can convince himself of almost any idiocy 
with little or no empirical evidence needed...  But hopefully we can overcome 
it too....

- -
- - FROM: Vince Stricherz, 205-543-2580, vinces@u.washington.edu
- -
- - FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: Aug. 16, 1999
- -
- - New spacecraft propulsion method could be out of this solar system
- -
- - It sounds like a "droid" straight out of Star Wars. That\'s not a coincidence
- - because a new propulsion system dubbed M2P2 can greatly boost spacecraft
- - speeds, perhaps to 10 times the velocity of the space shuttle, University of
- - Washington scientists believe.
- -
- - NASA\'s Institute for Advanced Concepts last week awarded a two-year,
- - $500,000 grant to a UW team headed by geophysicist Robert Winglee to
- - continue research on Mini-Magnetospheric Plasma Propulsion. If laboratory
- - work and tests in space succeed, he hopes in 10 years to launch an
- - M2P2-equipped spacecraft that would become the first from Earth to
- - leave the Solar System.
- -
- - That would be quite a feat, considering the craft would have to overtake
- - Voyager I, launched in 1977 and now about 6.8 billion miles away but still
- - within the solar system.
- -
- - Winglee, an associate geophysics professor, has been working on M2P2 the
- - last nine months with geophysics professor George Parks and John Slough,
- - a research associate professor of aeronautics and astronautics. They are
- - developing a prototype and are preparing for tests in the UW\'s Redmond
- - Plasma Physics Laboratory.
- -
- - Their system would use a plasma chamber about the size of a large pickle
- - jar, perhaps 10 inches by 10 inches, attached to a spacecraft. Solar cells
- - and solenoid coils would power the creation of a dense magnetized plasma,
- - or ionized gas, that would inflate an electromagnetic field 10 to 12 miles
- - in radius around the spacecraft. The field would interact with and be
- - dragged by the solar wind.
- -
- - Creating the field would be akin to raising a giant sail and harnessing the
- - solar wind, which moves at 780,000 to 1.8 million miles an hour -- or
- - "here to Washington, D.C., in 10 seconds," Winglee said. There is enough
- - power in the solar wind to move a 300-pound spacecraft at speeds up to
- - 180,000 miles per hour or 4.3 million miles a day. By contrast, the space
- - shuttle travels at about 18,000 miles per hour or 430,000 miles a day.
- -
- - At such speeds, an M2P2-equipped spacecraft launched today could
- - overtake Voyager I within eight years, despite Voyager\'s 22-year head
- - start.
- -
- - The idea for M2P2 grew from the study of plasma jets forming around
- - young stars, and was formalized in a $75,000 startup grant from the
- - NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts.
- -
- - The system has built-in advantages over solar sails, which are very large,
- - thin sheets of reflective material such as Mylar that can turn sunlight
- - into a propelling force. Solar sails are typically many times larger than
- - the spacecraft they propel and must be deployed mechanically. The M2P2
- - plasma chamber is far lighter and less bulky than sails. Just a few
- - kilowatts of power would support the magnetic field and only about
- - 100 pounds of additional propellant would be required. Adding the device
- - to a spacecraft might cost $1 million, but it would provide substantial
- - cost savings for the overall mission and would provide easier access to
- - the planets and beyond, Winglee said.
- -
- - M2P2 could be a major advancement in space travel, but it might be too
- - tame for two generations that have grown up with science-fiction
- - adventures such as Star Trek and Star Wars.
- -
- - "It\'s amazing how many people say, \'That\'s not fast enough,\'" Winglee said.
- - "People want to go to warp drive so they can get to the next solar system."
- -
- - However, Star Trek\'s warp drive and the hyperdrive propulsion from Star
- - Wars, both of which can exceed light speed (186,000 miles per second in
- - a vacuum), are not possible under the current understanding of the laws
- - of physics.
- -
- - For now, at least, plasma propulsion could prove to be the best option
- - to the science fiction propulsion systems. If tests on M2P2 succeed,
- - Winglee expects the system\'s first use in space will come on a mission
- - NASA already will have scheduled.
- -
- - "If it works, we\'ll have some real fun then," he said.

On both sides of every argument.  Intellectual honesty be damned, my dogma
is my own and I will keep it, no matter what the evidence to the contrary.
I doubt that it is only a human trait, however.  At least one species older
than humans displayed the very same behavior.

Sounds exactly like the response to the Solomani Hypothesis.

"We hold these truths to be self evident..."  Some things are just so
obviously right that they must be wrong.  This is Finals week for the Summer
semester, so I know what I\'m talking about.  It\'s the easy questions, the
"gimmies", that I get wrong. :-)

Hey, they *told* you that customers didn\'t go to a fight bar for the
food or drink.  <g>

The idea is that someone insults a waitbeing...or vice versa...a
fight breaks out and everyone joins in a nice big free for all.  No
one is seriously hurt, usually, lots of pent up aggression is worked
out, and the locals consider it great fun. 

Okay, Keven don\'t read this...

Keven\'s PC was manuevered to be in that fight bar so he could be
discretely searched and...um...other stuff.  The Black Marble, local
intell outfit, suspected him of being a mule in a spy ring.

  Something tells me that you don\'t buy into pirates having small cruisers

Ahhh, the old Subbie with a couple of fighters in the hold trick.
(or, for the really evil - a bay Meson Gun plus batteries)

I always felt this worked better against organised pirates than
opportunistic ones.

It also has the side "benefit" of encouraging enemy raiders to destroy
merchants rather than capturing them, thus reducing their ability to
resupply from the captives.

YMMV.  Niven also thought of this.  Do you do rishathra?

Some related thoughts:

Consider the panet relationship from the Julian Protectorate
(summarized, with source references, in the material for the
Julian Protectorate in JimV\'s Galactic - with Amdukan sector) -
who\'s to say that it might not go just a little farther...

"That Document" still exists, but will _not_ be posted to the
list, nor to Freelance Traveller. Interested parties can surely
figure out how to obtain it...

Speaking of rishathra, wouldn\'t it be accurate to apply that term
to the appropriate interaction between members of _any_ two
different human races, as well as between human and non-human?
So, a Vilani and a Solomani - which is clearly not an uncommon
occurrence...

Indeed, but I was really talking that "sci-fi" thing... not the sci-fact
that can mire a game down.  The thing about sci-fi is how it may sound
technical and even feasible, but like anti-grav, it just ain\'t real (at this

Ditzie was around way before Jesse started drawing. I always saw her as

I do computerised data analysis looking for anomolous events for a living.
I can see lots of chunky contingency fees for very little actual work in
this one. I\'ll even ignore the issue that a TL8 world can easily spot
everything and it\'s dog within 100 diameters (Bruce, we could use the
Hubble to track a stray beer can at or about the 100 diameter limit, right ?).

What happens in this scenario is that as soon as the Far Trader comes out
of jump is it radios and/or laser comms the planet to say "We\'re here and
looking to sell X". They are merchants. It\'s what they do.

If they get jumped by the Merc Cruiser, then their people on the planet go
(a) where did our ship go and (b) gosh, I wonder if their suspicious
disappearence has anything to do with that Merc Cruiser that left (1).

Now, by their very line of business, mercenaries tend to collect enemies.
At the very least, the side the mercenaries were shooting at weeks ago may
be inclined to assist in asking questions designed, in the end, to get the
Imperial Navy to do what their side failed in in that recent unfortunate
dust-up.

Piracy is possible. It just happens to people who consent to take the risks
of living or trading well away from mainworlds.

Ms Ditzammer Spofulam is the Executive Vice-President of Famile Spofulam,
reporting directly to the venerable Hengabar Spofulam.

Famile Spofulam has a number of nominally independant divisions, including
Toys and Games, Starships and High Energy Solutions. Ditzie was attached to
the Legal Department in Compliance, but has been steadily climbing the
corporate ladder. I wouldnt be surprised to see Hengabar accept a promotion
to Board Chairman or something ...

Ditzie is somewhat a favorite of Hengabar. Other children include
Winifreda, and a couple of cousins are coming out of the woodwork. Rumours
that Famile Spofulam engage in dangerous IQ-boosting experiments and
miscellaneous genetic engineering will be met with the full resources of
FS\' Legal Department (aka Leeeeegals).

FS have upheld the Imperial tradition of robust competition, especially
where Gridlore Technologies ("Gridlore. Maximising total cost of ownership
whilst minimising achievement of mission objectives") and X-tek ("X-tek.
Where 49 megajoules is considered a point defense laser") are concerned.

I used the old 15 mm official Traveller white metal miniatures (the 5x boxed

sake, I\'ve been collecting the Star Wars Micro Machines for the same

    Perhaps the Solomani Hypothesis was widely accepted during the Second

Surely 1G is enough to flip the missile\'s heading around so that it can
use its full thrust to evade.

IIRC Gurps charges a heavy penalty for making all the thrust vectored.

Alas, it\'s no longer that simple. Because we no longer have the line
tangent to the surface at one end of the site line. Instead, *if*
there\'s a tangent to the surface, it\'s somewhere *between* the target
and the observer. 

If I have some spare time, I\'ll see what I can come up with, but it\'s
gonna be *messy*. 

I *think* that in *some* cases, what you do is use the original formula
once for each observer, and then *add* the distances. A diagram would
make it clear *why*. But for now, trust me.

Seriously, they have to wear all that stuff because people were getting
*killed* (or at least long term/permanently injured). 

Try playing American football *without* that "armor" and you won\'t have
players for long. Those guys "play" *way* too seriously.

Skating doesn\'t work on other frozen liquids. Part of the lack of
friction is due to the *pressure* of the blades melting the ice, which
lubricates things nicely. This "presure melting" only works becuase
water is one of a *very* few compounds that expand when freezing. 

What you\'d get on frozen gases is the leaking heat from your footgear
creating a layer of gas. Alas, this layer will be a lot less useful.
Since it\'s not created by pressure, "leaning" won\'t change the amount
and location of the friction. I suspect that you wouldn\'t be able to
get blades to "bite" properly.

    Yes actually and really killed.    Around the turn of the century the 
number of fatalities in college football in America was so high that there 
was a serious push to outlaw it.    In response Presiedent Theodore Roosevelt 
set up a commision which among other things suggested the adoption of the 
forward pass as an official part of the rules, which got the game off the 
ground and into the air and avoided mass tackles.  It was also about then 
that more protective equipment was adopted.

Ignoring refraction, I think it is true for all cases.

For any observer of a given height (H), you can draw a tangent to the
circle that meets the observer at that height. This determines
the observer\'s horizon distance (D) for objects at 0 altitude.

Do the same for a second observer (height h) to get their horizon
distance (d).

If you draw the picture: when the first observer is distance D from
a point on the circle and the second observer is a distance d,
then both can see that point and since their line of sight is
tangential to the circle at that point (and there is only one tangent)
then they can look adoringly in to each other\'s eyes (or radar dishes
or image intensifieres or whatever).

I was never a geek or a nerd from the standard viewpoint.  I was pure
working class, dropped out of school before high school to work, read and
became self taught for the most part, hence my deplorable math... no
interest, no learning.

Family unit consisted of mum and dad, and three siblings.  Joined the
Australian army in the artillery with 105\'s, managed to cross to the Light
Horse, QMI (Queensland Mounted Infantry) in M113\'s.  Was into sex,
not-drugs, and alcohol (okay, alcohol is a legal drug, I\'m a non-smoker and
"don\'t do drugs), but I was pretty straight in the head, which lead to me
becoming a relationship councillor in the field (which again is why I asked
about the title/Goth/RPG\'er thing and am truly sorry the thread got out of
hand, but it was a, shall we say, "Professional curiosity" that lead me to
ask).

Game related activities stem from the family unit as a child (Ludo,
Scrabble, Monopoly, etc.), continued as a teen, went on into adult hood with
it (those same games, which, except for Ludo, I still have in the house and
play regularly with family members), only the list of games has expanded
since (Pictionary, Space Crusade, Hero Quest, Robo Rally, Scatagories, not
to mention trivia games coming out of my ears and some other 50-odd games I
shan\'t mention -- though no-one I currently know plays Squad Leader...).
However, the family (I\'m married, 4-children) love swimming, BBQ\'s,
partying, sports, etc.

Discovered Traveller in my 20\'s(?) and played it until MT killed it in the
eyes of my group who turned to AD&D... which I followed and we became award
winning gamers at local (Aussie) Cons.  I enjoy computer games of course, to
unwind... and am currently somewhere in the middle(?) of Fallout2 after
enjoying the original Fallout some months ago.  Both games I can\'t recommend
highly enough for light entertainment with a touch of thinking.

Is that what you meant??

Lessee, I\'m 45 years old. High school graduate the first time around.
Service, then married. Worked to get my First Class Machinist ticket and
raise the familly.

Started gaming in the mid \'70s, mostly war games with some D&D thrown
in. Then I found Traveller and started GM\'ing.

Wound up stopping most gaming activities in the mid-80\'s when we got
into the SCA. Went that route for a number of years then stopped
altogether to go back to school. 

Current status: I\'m a Reliability Engineer specializing in rotating
equipment for an oil refiner in NJ. Three kids, two in the Marine Corp.
one a senior in high school. Now that I\'ve settled well into my current
job I find that I have some free time again, so I re-started the gaming.
I do have to say that catching a copy of T4 and then this list helped
light the spark. Biggest problem (as always ) is finding the players.

    I\'m 34 years old, married with two young children.  I\'ve a PhD in 
Classical languages and have just moved back to my home town to teach Latin 
at the high school I graduated from.  I started playing Traveller in the 
early 80\'s, and GM\'ed CT and MT (among many other things) off and on through 
about 1990.  I GM\'ed a T4 campaign when it came out, but switched to AD&D to 
find more players (hoping to convert them eventually).  Since I\'ve moved I 
have had to get players all over again, so I reluctantly am starting a new 
AD&D game, with Traveller back on the far horizon (after moving so many times 
in the last ten years, I think I\'m finally settled down, real house, real 
yard, near family and friends).  I supposed I was a geeky kind of guy   of 
sorts in High school, when they vote you most studious I guess that says it 
all, although I seem to remember sending more time on RPG\'s than school work. 
 I also was an eagle scout and have always striven to be a real 
straight-arrow square.

        Well, I can host such a list.  Call it "GamerCentral", maybe.
Anyone who would be interested in the list as it was described, e-mail me
directly.  If I get 10+ interested parties, I\'ll set it up and announce it.

With the discussion recently about Andre Norton\'s Solar Queen series, I 
thought I\'d bring up Elizabeth Moon.

I\'m in the middle of her "Heris Serrano" series (Sporting Chance, Hunting 
Party, Winning Colors). Good stuff, especially for a Traveller game!

While not exactly Traveller space tech, there\'s a lot here you could adapt. 
For example, in the first book, there\'s a good description of the ship\'s 
hydroponic system and recycling system. The book I\'m reading now (Winning 
Colors) has some great space battles (although the jump system is not quite 
the same as Traveller\'s system, there are a lot of items on sensors, 
missiles, beam weapons, etc. that you could probably make use of). 

In addition, you can get ideas on how to play Noble characters from these 
books. There are some screamingly funny scenes about decorating a spaceship. 
An invasion by roaches. A lot of stuff about what rich nobles do with their 
spare time (whole planets devoted to raising horses, hunting, etc.).

Good stuff. She has also written a second series placed in the same universe, 
the "Esmay Suiza" series. So far there are only two volumes out, Once a Hero 
and Rules of Engagement (still only in hardcover) with at least a third being 
written.

All are from (in the US at least) Baen Books.

It isn\'t impossible (say, a naval mutiny), but it would be pretty rare, and a patrol ship would respond by jumping out and informing the navy that there\'s a warship playing pirate in the area.  The big problem with piracy with military ships is that they have no cargo space to speak of.

Hm?  There\'s probably ways of recognizing ships later, but I wouldn\'t expect pirate identification to be all that easy.

It\'s possible, but requires a fairly heavy missile.  You\'d also need to give
it real sensors, since the standard GT missiles are theoretically
operator-guided (aiii...don\'t think about that one too hard).

        I think a more accurate statement is that it does not have much of a
kill-radius...  the "blast" will injure you at several meters even from a
"small" grenade.

Well, I was thinking more along the lines of a merchant with bay cargo
doors....which open to reveal a fifty-ton missile bay, but yeah, the
principle\'s the same.

Actually, the real benefit is against opportunity \'muggers\', because rather
than thinking "Hey, an unarmed merchant - easy pickings! Can we take her,
captain? Please?" the crew starts to think "Uhhh.....maybe this is that
Q-ship we heard about in the bar at the last port - the one that whacked the
Merc Cruiser last month..."

Once people start to consider that, then effectively every single freighter
in the operating area looks like a Q-ship ESPECIALLY the ones which look
really harmless. (Well, a Q-ship\'s going to want to look harmless, isn\'t
it?)

An \'organised crime\' pirate whose life is piracy would probably attack
anyway and take their (actually quite good - the Navy is far from
everywhere) chances. It\'s the muggers who\'ll be put off since they don\'t
lose anything by walking away.

The half-lethality zone of an \'average\' grenade is somewhere in the vicinity
of six metres. Without shrapnel it\'s closer to one or two.

However, as you say, injuries may be caused at a rather greater distance.

That\'s exactly what I meant. And you mentioned "curiosity", another issue I
was addressing. Sometimes when our gaming group gets together, we take out
our characters and stay in "gaming mode" until we can\'t see straight, put
our stuff away and go home. Other times we play a little, chat a little,
thrash out a ship or castle or something, talk about books we\'ve read, etc.
I signed up to the TML for the first reason; Gaming discussion, nothing but.

However I *am* interested in a lot of other games than Traveller, and some
are not even RPGs. Gaming is a recreation that blends into other recreations
as well, and my thought was for a mailing list that was less formal. I do
not want to change this list, I like it as is. Well, if anything it could be
more structured. I don\'t like seeing "Digest xxx" in the subject line, I
like to know what the post is about. I believe that is in the mailing list
rules, but it is often ignored. I have also seen posts that failed to cut
out the parts of the previous post that did not clarify the response. You
will note that I snip large chunks, having left only five words from your
post, and those being perfect set-up for my little diatribe.

Well, I am behind in reading this wonderful list, so I will finish with a
big thank you to all those Uber-geeks on this list that have posted such
fantastic data, opinions, thoughts, and queries on topics like:

Xenobiology 101: This has been my favorite. Juicy organic bits, yum!

Orbital Ballistics: My weakest point most likely, probably due to my poor
math skills. (You\'re not alone, Roc)

Book Reviews: Still waiting for First In and Far Trader, they should get
here in a couple days. Fiction reviews have been nice too.

Economics in the Third Imperium: Until this list I had not even wondered
about wich J-drive would be most economical, now I know J-2 is the most cost
effective, barring sparse steller regions.

Vilani Culture: I never liked the Vilani until I started reading the Trav
Cultures list. Some good stuff has popped up on this list too.

And many miscellaneous topics that have popped up here and there. Again,
thanks!

Try SJG\'s "High Tech" supplement. Some WWII weaponry in there.
I believe the GURPS website also has a huge weapon writeup under

    'body' => 'Just an FYI from NASA; seems the Galileo probe is getting a little
toasted...



             Galileo Europa Mission Status
                     August 16, 1999     

     NASA\'s Galileo spacecraft survived an unexpected whopper 
dose of radiation -- the strongest it has experienced since its 
closest-ever approach to Jupiter in 1995 -- before completing the 
third in a series of flybys of Jupiter\'s moon Callisto.

     The radiation bombardment occurred as Galileo headed toward 
its Callisto encounter, when the spacecraft flew within 452,000 
kilometers (281,000 miles) of Jupiter\'s cloud tops at 3:59 a.m. 
Pacific Daylight Time on Thursday, August 12.  

     "We anticipated the spacecraft\'s star scanner would detect 
about 300 to 400 pulse counts of radiation, so imagine our 
surprise when the instruments showed Galileo had flown through 
1,400 pulse counts!" said Galileo Project Manager Jim Erickson.  
"Then again, that\'s why we\'re exploring Jupiter and its moons -- 
to discover these unusual phenomena."

     The cause of the outburst is unknown, but several factors 
may have played a role.  First, at the time the spacecraft was 
near its close approach to Jupiter and its high radiation 
environment.  Second, it was also near a "plasma sheet," 
crossing, an area brimming with charged particles trapped in a 
thin disc that rotates with Jupiter\'s magnetic field.  In 
addition, it took place one week after the largest heat output 
since 1986 from Jupiter\'s volcanic moon Io.  The Io heat output 
was measured by ground-based infrared telescopes and may coincide 
with an increase in volcanic activity.

     The radiation level endured by Galileo during this flyby was 
many times higher than the levels engineers expect the spacecraft 
will encounter during its flybys of Jupiter\'s volcanic moon Io in 
October and November.

     "This was a great dress rehearsal for the Io encounters," 
said Erickson.  "We\'ve been wondering how the spacecraft might 
hold up when it gets close to Io.  This latest brush with 
radiation makes us think that the odds of survival may be fairly 
good."

     The radiation exposure did have its tense moments.  It 
appears the radiation triggered four spacecraft faults, but all 
of them were handled correctly by onboard software.  The 
radiation apparently triggered a computer reset of the non-
spinning portion of the spacecraft three times -- on Thursday, 
August 12 at 6:07 a.m. PDT, at 10:29 a.m. PDT, and at 5 p.m. PDT.  
Because the onboard tape recorder was in use during the first 
reset, the recording was disrupted temporarily.  This resulted in 
the loss of a few observations -- one from the instruments that 
study magnetic fields and charged particles and two by the near 
infrared mapping spectrometer. 

     The radiation apparently caused one other anomaly at 8:21 
a.m. PDT on August 12, when a spin detector, used as a backup 
monitor of the spacecraft\'s spin rate, experienced a hardware 
glitch.  Onboard fault protection software disabled the faulty 
detector.

     After Galileo passed beyond the high radiation zone and 
corrected its faults, the spacecraft went on to fly by Callisto 
at an altitude of 2,299 kilometers (1,429 miles) on Saturday, 
August 14, at 1:31 a.m. PDT.  The flyby included experiments 
involving changes in the spacecraft\'s signal as it passed behind 
Callisto (as seen from Earth).  During that period, Galileo\'s 
radio signal was weakened by Callisto\'s tenuous atmosphere.  By 
studying these changes, scientists can learn more about the 
structure of the atmosphere.

ObTrav:  Gas giant skimming can be more exciting if a crew must
coincide their skimming with avoiding such a charged particle
"disk" mentioned in the 4th paragraph above. Failure to do so
could result in damage equivalent to a low-level PAWS hit.

Or sensitive, unshielded equipment (like in a sickbay?) could
malfunction at an inopportune time due to exposure.

IMTU, the 3I doesn\'t care about marriage, period. It doesn\'t formally
recognize the state, other than as a legal contract engaged in through
local laws. It will only enforce marriage laws in so far as they are
handled by extradition procedures for breach of contract or criminal
clauses. Individual worlds vary.

Imperial law simply states that, unless becomeing a permanent resident, no
local government may punish an imperial citizen for any marriage contract
which is valid at source and being adhered to. However, permanent residence
may make the individuals subject to manditory dissolution in order to take
local citizenship.

Still IMTU, Earth: Interspecies marriage forbidden by law, which will be
enforced by the marine garrisons. Same gender, just fine. Earth is rabidly
ZPG.
Ploygamy and Polyandry, by consent of all involved.

Not too far away (forget which world, need to check the details in my
notes) is a world where same sex is forbidden (and punishable by
mutilation), but species issues never were covered by the laws, and so are
allowed to occur... provided both are members of the local religion. Non
members are forbidden to wed, too.

No, not really.  Maybe equivalent to a radiation hit.  Any antiship weapon in traveller would turn Galileo into shrapnel with one hit.

Generally speaking, the most radiation-sensitive component onboard a spaceship is the crew, though random computer errors from radiation could also be a problem.

>49? Ahhh, ya wusses....<g>

So, a 49Mj Laser isn\'t good enough for yeh eh?  You want to toast bigger
and badder things at close range eh?  Okay....

Hows about this! (for GURPS:Traveller)

3750Mj Rapid fire 100ton PAW Bay TL12

RoF=1/2(gives +10 to hit)
Dmg= 5d x 1150
1/2D Range= 1hex
Max range = 3Hex
437.5 tons and 23.6Mcr

Using the G:T ship combat rules, if this is used at PD ranges there is a
+20 to hit (+10 for the RoF, +10 for PD fire)  Factor in the ships fire
control computer (another +10) add +30 to twice gunners skill and then
subtract 39.  Lets say the skill is 15.  Roll is 21 on 3d to hit a size
\'0\' object at PD range (gets better as biger things are thown against
it!).  Average dammage is 17,250 points.
So if you are defending your ship from kamakaze fighters or Scouts(don\'t
laugh, this is very possible in G:T, and very deadly!), this is the toy
for you.

I know, this may not even be enough for some of you.  I guess I\'ll just
have to make the obscenely hyperactive firing Meson Spinal! ;->

This note is to confirm that BITS will be running three tournaments at
GenCon Uk 99.

The three tournaments are:
	1. Delta 3 Is Down (Thu, slot 6, 3-7pm)
	2. Return of the Space Dogs (Sat, slot 14, 3-7pm)
	3. Fun! (Sun, slot 17, 10am-2pm)

All the tournaments are being written with dual T4/GURPS stats, but we
haven\'t yet decided for certain whether we run some tables with each rule
system. Certainly we\'re not intending to run any one
tournament as solely GURPS or T4 unless all the players are happy with it
(or we can only find referees who know one or other system).

The RPGA have finally added the tournaments to their website (linked off
the BITS site via the Travelling page or http://rpga.ukonline.co.uk/ ) and
also included the scope to pre-book to play.

Hoping to see you there!

    To tell the truth, I do have some.  I think that Galanglic and Vilani in

Vilani in the 3rd Imperium, all as different from one another as say English

contact between worlds would make for huge differences in vocabulary and 
especially pronunciation.  (Note that on Earth  Vulgar Latin became French, 
Italian, Spanish etc.  in just a few centuries while the various communities 
were still in contact and had Church Latin as a "objective standard" to 
preserve the old speech--imagine the scope of change when speech communities

Wouldn\'t audio recordings and such help to mitigate the normal drift in
usage and pronunciations that would normally happen.  I would think that
worlds where technology had collapsed below the level to support this during
the long night would show a remarkable amount of change.

I was reading somewhere, a couple of weeks ago, how television and radio is
supposedly flattening out accents across the US.  It seems that in worlds
with recording & broadcasting, recorded movies, news, instructional tapes,
etc would slow down the rate of change in the verbal languages, the same way
that printing presses and dictionaries more solidified written languages.

    Sound change is very subtle andvery often the old pronunciation is 
completely intelligble (but two changes back might not be).    Audio 
recordings would actually in some cases would accelerate drift since it would 
spread a new pronunciation much more quickly across a planet (much as mass 
media does indeed level accents across the US and has helped keep American, 
British and Australian English more or less mutually intelligble).  

    Suppose the US and Australia were on separate planets.  As long as we 
continued to trade mass media recordings, these recordings would act to level 
out some of the pronunciation changes in the respective "Englishes".  
however, if contact were lost, 200 year old recordings of Frank Sinatra 
records and presidential addresses would have little impact on the language 
as a whole.  And, say in part of America we stopped pronouncing the letter 
"B"  if it became somehow fashionable, then local recordings would facilitate 
that change across the country quite quickly, with no corresponding change in 
Australia.   

        Dave Nelson

    P.S. If you ask why one particular sound change happens and others don\'t, 
you\'re asking a good question.   Individual changes can be explained  "it\'s 
easier to say tithemi than thithemi"  is called dissimilation of the th, but 
there is no satisfactory catch all theory that can predict what changes will 
or will not occur.

/DISCLAIMER I am NOT a linguist of any sort!

However, since language changes in a larger population are rarely
monolithic (else we\'d all be, like, speaking grotty val-speak, doodz!)
wouldn\'t the rapid spread of media actually would work against rapid
fundamental changes in language (like not pronouncing \'B\', _not_ like
sticking \'cyber\' in front of every possible noun in the language) simply
because there is more than one center of change? Thus it would act like
a negative feedback, stabilizing the language?

_Slang_, as opposed to fundamental changes in the language that make one
speaker unintelligible to another, otoh, will spread rapidly...and given
the nature of slang, vanish just as fast.

Oops, the TL10 missile should have been a 9G missile at that size.
Must have put the TL number in there - wishful thinking.

All were designed for one hour endurance -  Three combat turns.
Except for the TL13 missile which was only for two turns, as it would be way
outside comms range by that time.
Gurps fuel cells are very good at energy storage. A TL10 20 lb cell can store
100 kwh.

I figured that powered range gave you an idea of the amount of dodging the
missile could do given the range of the target.

The point of using 3 cubic foot (or less) missiles is that this is a smaller
size band in Gurps. Therefore the missile is harder to detect & hit. So less
chance of it being detected until it is too late.

>(Has anyone designed any G:T missiles with fusion power, by the way? Using
>the stock rules - which make it too easy to penetrate point defence fire,
>making KKMs practical - they should be Certain Death for just about anyone...)

The problem is there is a minimum mass and cost for a Gurps fusion reactor (1
ton and 200 KCr). So that would be one mother of a missile. You would see it
coming, and it would be much easier to hit.

>Maneuverability is key for missiles, especially impact missiles, as they have

There is a 50% mass, cost, and volume penalty for using vectored thrust.

There must be a limit to how fast the thruster can be rotated. I suspect
sideways thrust in space can actually turn the missile faster than the thruster
can rotate. Therefore I figured that keeping most thrust unvectored and using
vectored thrust to swivel actually made for controlled instability and therefore
made it more manouverable. Convenient I know! However I think missile dodge is
academic.

There is little chance of a missile being detected until it is within PDF range,
at which point it cannot dodge under GT rules (ramming craft cannot dodge). If
your missile has more than 6G thrust then it can stay outside laser range until
the final ramming run.

Your vectored dodge at long range is worth a lot less than the +10 bonus PDF
fire and no dodge bonus the target gets in any case.

A missile that is spotted at long range, and is drawing laser fire is one less
laser shooting at you. A weapon can only shoot at one target per turn.

For _most_ platforms, including Win9x, Internet Explorer and
Netscape (and I believe Opera as well - don\'t know about other
browsers) will accept the IP address in place of the domain name,
so you can point your browser at http://207.124.43.105/ to get to
downport.com, and you can add on the rest of a downport URI
normally, e.g., Freelance Traveller will be found at
http://207.124.43.105/freelancetraveller/Default.htm.

Bog.  80 joules is considered sufficient for half lethality?  Not unless its really well aimed.  That\'s equivalent to a .22 short round, or being kicked by someone fairly strong.  Sure, it can kill, but it isn\'t exactly 50% lethal.  From looking at explosives safety stuff, LD50 should probably be 2-4 yards * (pounds TNT)^1/3; direct overpressure won\'t kill beyond about 1.5 yards * Q^1/3.

You\'re missing the point. There\'s no energy value for "half lethality".
80-Joules in the correct body area (head, torso, upper abdomen) will almost
always kill or incapacitate. The fity-fifty chance is the chance of that
energy being sucessfully delivered. From a hand grenade, that\'s mainly by
fragmentation, which has nothing to do with overpressure. The calculation
for a grenade is as follows:

Obtain a number of fragments (from your Big Book Of Grenades).
Obtain the textbook value for exposed surface (from your Big Book Of
Military Facts).
Pick a radius.
Calculate the surface area of a sphere at that radius.
Divide area of body by area of sphere, and multiply by number of fragments.
That\'s the number of fragments that will probably hit the body.
Find the radius which equates to 0.5 fragments to the 80-Joule Zone.
Affirm that the fragments still have 80-J of kinetic energy at this point
(they almost always will for something like a grenade.)

    Yes, to a certain degree this is true, if and only if there is a 
concerted effort to maintain a standard pronunciation.  It is just as likely 
that a sound change will be spread rapidly by such a media.   If the 
broadcasters adopted a new pronunciation it would make change that much more 
rapid.   This is the tricky part:  would the standardized media adopt sound 
changes?  The answer is of course they would.   The nature of sound change is 
such that many of the changes are not perceived as changes by the persons 
speaking them.
      For example, there are, at least in American English, two distinct ways 
of pronouncing the TH sound, although we do not perceive them as being 
different, because we write them the same way, e.g., the TH in "thin" and the 
TH in "then" differ  in whether they are accompanied by a vibration of vocal 
cords ("voicing").  If the broadcasters in question began pronouncing them 
identically the audience might think "it sounded a little funny" but wouldn\'t 
be able to say "that\'s wrong".  This small change might trigger  further 
changes in vowel sounds which followed, causing a serious change in 
pronunciation.  
    Because the change took place in a broadcast context then the change 
would end up being more wide spread.   There is no reason to believe that the 
"broadcast media class" are any less vulnerable to idiosyncratic sound change 
than any other class.   The pronunciation of, say, Lowell Thomas has little 
impact on how Dan Rather pronounces his words, rather he is influenced by his 
parents and the peers of his teenage years.  
    I suppose there may be a few totalitarian Vilani-centric worlds in the 
Long Night that may have demanded exacting pronunciation drills with 
shock-treatment feedback linked to First Imperium computer records. That is 
what it would take to  preserve Ancient Vilani as the everyday speech 
absolutely unchanged, but it seems far fetched.   
    A  formal written language can stay stable for quite some time, and can 
be preserved indefinitely, but a living everyday spoken language is 
inexorably bound to undergo sound change,  it is impossible to stop.   
Contact between speaking groups is the factor which determines whether sound 
change leads to unintelligibility or not.

Assuming that SJG want to carry them, and there is a demand, I would hope so.

RealisticalIy would guestimate them at SJG mid-October (GenCon is 2-5 Sept

My fleet in Steve Higginbotham\'s TNE/TCS campaign used 13.5 m^3
fusion rocket powered missiles for heavy antiship missiles and
much lighter KKM\'s for close in and anti-missile-missile use...
Expensive, but gave you 8/40+ performance with multiple 500kt
det laser warheads, even with penetration aids and SIM/FIM.

[This is some of the design and campaign stuff I mentioned posting
after Cynthia brought up archives of that campaign and others.
I haven\'t found my archives of Steve\'s earlier Old Islands/TCS
campaign, unfortunately, that was a lot of fun too... The first
set should be up on the web somewhere within the week.]

A friend, sometimes coworker of mine and old-time Traveller player,
Dr Frank Crary, is working on the plasma physics instruments on
Galileo and has been pretty open that they all think the last few
orbits are a suicide mission; they\'re baking the spacecraft well
past its rated radiation lifetime.

I suggest followups to Usenet (sci.space.science).

Y\'all are thinking too much.  You don\'t need an anti-starship
missile at 150m.  You don\'t even need optical sights for a
30+m long target at 150m.

Take the ground weapon (cannon, rocket launcher, mortar)
design rules.  Figure out what sized weapons are needed to
either HEAP or KEAP (APFSDSCI or better, depending on your
TL obviously) penetrate a pirate ship hull at close range.
Figure out how to deliver say 50 of those rounds in 2-3
seconds, which turns out to be terribly easy.  I usually
use a MRL battery, automortar, or medium caliber multibarrel
ETC autocannons firing KEAP ammo, under shoot-through fiberglass
covers and with battery power.  Bonus points if your weapons
have enough pen to poke through the far side of well armored
military or pirate opponents, the air leaks out twice as fast
then, and you do more damage in between the walls...  And the
weapons may come in useful on the ground, too... ;-)

And in most cases they have the advantage of not needing a working power system. As in, 

"Cap\'n, they\'re dead in space, no power sig a\'tal."

"Aye, close to boarding!"

"500, 400, 300..."

"What\'s \'zat? Damn. it ta..."

"Boom!"

"Hisssss!"

Hee! Hee!  

Of course, if the pirate survives your sneak punch he will then *really* kill the impudent merchant and every man-jack aboard her.  You might want to call \'em "Suicide Cannon."

Again, only to a point.  I\'m a kid of the 50\'s.  We had radio, tv, phonograph records, etc.  But I still have a noticable accent that gets mistaken (around here anyways) as \'hillbilly\'.  It\'s not.  It\'s pure High Plains Western, except that 22 years living \'back East\' makes me talk a bit faster.  It comes out a *lot* more when I\'m dead tired.

And I did ask... and again, I love the result (being able to put an image to

You lucky bastard... I\'ve been married for some 20+ years now, and I lost my
SL players just after I got married (no, the missus didn\'t shoot them, they
changed locations).  Again, not a common game system in my local, not even

SL can be used to good effect in conjunction with Traveller.  Back in the

SL to resolve the big battles that the players got themselves into.  I used

Sulphates are problematic. The sulphur fluorides (SF2, SF5, SF6) are
going to be significant components of the atmosphere. Some sort of
regenerative process will be necessary for sulphates and sulphides to
survive at all. ?upwelling from the core ; ?biological activity

It will be easier to ditch fluorine altogether and use water as a
solvent, with energy production coming from the transformation of
sulphur compounds. The atmosphere can be like that of Venus, loaded with
sulphuric acid.

I really don\'t know how to preserve the \'Beyond The Claw\' description.

With the discussion of the Andre Norton Solar Queen series recently, I 
thought I\'d toss out the titles that have most influenced my Traveller games 
over the years. Unfortunately, not too many of these are in print right now, 
but if you haunt enough second hand bookstores you should score some (if not 
all):

Central Control Series:
Star Rangers (a.ka. The Last Planet)
Star Guard
(good for games set whent the Imperium is in decline...)

Dipple Series
Catseye
Judgment on Janus (also in Janus series)
Night of Masks
Forerunner Foray (also in Forerunner series)

Forerunner/Shan Lantee Series
Storm Over Warlock
Ordeal in Otherwhere
Forerunner Foray (also in Dipple series)
Forerunner
Forerunner: The Second Venture
(I used these to add additional "ancient" races to MTU plus to give a 
archaeological bent to some of the adventures)

Free Trader Series (a.k.a. Moon Magic Series or Moon Singer Series)
Moon of Three Rings
Exiles of the Stars
Flight in Yiktor
Dare to Go A-Hunting
(good for oddball Trader games)

Hosteen Storm Series
The Beast master
Lord of Thunder

Janus Series
Judgment on Janus (also in Dipple Series)
Victory on Janus

Jern Murdock Series
The Zero Stone
Uncharted Stars
(I once ran a early Traveller game based on these...about 1978???)

Pax/Astra Series
The Stars are Ours!
Star Born
(as with Star Rangers, good for declining Imperium scenarios)

Ross Murdock/Time War Series
The Time Traders
Galactic Derelict
The Defiant Agents
Key Out of Tiime
Firehand (with P.M Griffin)

Solar Queen Series:
Sargasso of Space

For old GURPS players like myself, the Template system in GT is a bit weak,
as us old hands can tweek the system till it sings (like my favourage,
Eidetic Memory and Language Tallent and you can speak 6 languages for
bugger all points).

But IMHO, you loose one of the benifits of Traveller, a history of the
character. (My current character in GT is fleshed out, I have a strong
history for him, but I perfer to play like that, as it also gives the GM
hooks to use).

However, if you design micro templates, say 10 to 20 points worth of
advantages / disadvantages and skills to represent different periods of a
persons life outside of his/her career. Points are allocated to be added to
any skill allready held.

This allows a new GURPS Traveller charater to have some idea on what he/she
did before travelling, and give some skills not normally available to the
templates (this is of cause mainly designed for non millitary characters,
but some may be used for millitary characters , like unemploed)

Quirks cole be spent to explain some of these packages.

eg :

Reserve Army (not pointed in any way, just showing my point)

Reserve Rank
Duty (Activation 6+)
Drive (Any/TL)
Gun(Any/TL)
Sovour Faire (Millitary)
Unarmed Combat

Characters who serve in non millitary careers may join their planetary
reserve militia, or may serve 1 term drafted , yada yada

Unemployed

Social Stigma (Unwashed pleb)
Wealth (-1 or -2)
Aclohilism or addiction (choice of 2 of the above)
Souvoir Faire (begging)
Bard (story Telling)
Survival (Urban/Rural)

Characters who find themselves falling through the gap.

Rebel/Insurgent

Enemy (Occupier 6+)
Paranoid
Reputation (Terrorist and/or freedom fighter)
Gun(Any) (no TL disadvantage, due to arms smuggling)
Demolitions
Survival (Urban/rural)

University scholarship

Social Standing +1
Any 3 Science or Sport Skills (must take all three skills from 1 choice)
Contact - University Professor (6+)
Enemy (rival university)

I will flesh these out in the next 2 days and let you know what comes of
it.

I wasn\'t aware there was a 5th book to this series.  Is it new?  I\'ve always
loved her Time Traders Series.  When I was younger I used to read a lot of
Norton, but as I got older, a lot of her books started sounding pendantic
and whiney;  Bad, EVIL technology versus sweet, innocent, GOOD cat
critters...or Beaver..or what-not.  :)  Suffice it to say I eventually got
rid of most of my Norton collection with a few exceptions.  The Gamma
World-esque "Breed to Come" is still a good read.  The aforementioned "Star
Guard" and "The Last Planet" are pretty good as well.  I also lean towards
her Crystal Gryphon novels (for purely personal reasons).

IMTU, regional accents are common.  Somebody from, say, Efate, for instance, 
has slightly different pronunciation and *definitely* different slang than 
somebody from Warinir in Daibei.  One of the players in my PBEM has a 
*definite* \'Marches\' accent that comes out when he\'s excited.

And no, Session 1 guys, he\'s not with *YOU*, he\'s in the 2nd Session.  They 
just haven\'t met him yet.  <grin>

For the reactor and the sensors required, they are so big you may as well design
them using the modular ship design system.

GTL10 Thunderbolt class shuttle.

2DT
cockpit bridge
1 manouver drive (100 tons thrust, short term access, partially vectored)
appropriate software

Statistics: Emass 14.8, LMass 14.8, Cost MCr 2.8, HP 900, Hull Size Modifier:+5
Performance: Accel 6.76 Gs (6.76 Gs empty), Jump 0, Air Speed  0 mph

A radically stealthed version costs 1.0 MCr more and does 6.49 Gs.

Endurance: 1 year.
Can be launched from the outsystem at a target insystem, by which time it is
going so fast, the target has no time to react.

This is dangerously close to near-c-rock territory.

Short term access maintenance space maeans this ship can also be used as a fast
shuttle. In this case a full space dock is required for maintenance purposes.

    'body' => 'OK, I\'m gearing up to start my campaign.  I\'m going to start off with a
bang (literally) and have the characters involved in a ship-to-ship
combat as well as personal combat on the deck of the ship they are in.

So, I\'m going to alternate between types of combat...let\'s see what
happened to the ship...OK...Now let\'s see what was going on inside the
ship while that was happening.

I\'m using CT rules for personal combat (pretty much), but I haven\'t
decided on a starship combat system (I\'ll probably go with CT rules too,
adding a sensor throw to the mix).

So, here\'s my question...

For personal combat, I\'m using a 5 second round (like MT and T4, cutting
the standard CT 15 second round by 2/3).

What I want to do is cut the starship combat system down to a similar
time scale.  For instance, CT uses a 1000 second combat round.  I would
cut this down to a 5 second round also, but I would also cut the range a
ship could travel by 200 to keep things on the same scale.

What I\'m trying to figure out is...

How fast can a starship weapon fire?

How long does it take a starship scale laser to recharge and be ready to
go after a shot?  Can missile launchers fire every 5 seconds?

CT starship combat rules allow for a starship class weapon to fire twice
in the 1000 second round.  That\'s once every 500 seconds.

I\'m assuming that system is somewhat abstract, and any damage involved
is the result of several shots that may have missed the target
ship--with a few getting lucky and doing damage.  We make the to hit
throw once, but that throw is representing several times the gunner
fired the weapon during that 16 and a half minutes (the 1000 second
turn).

So, given that, is it do-able to have a starship combat round at 5
second intervals?

Thoughts?

Kenneth.

Let\'s get our terminolgy right. We are talking about inter*species*
coupling. 

Niven\'s rishathra, on the other hand, actually *is* "interracial", or
at least involves *closely* related species. Or it did until Ch\'mee got
involved. :-)

As I note above, rishathra normally involved different "races". They
were all members of genus homo. If offspring were possible, then it\'d
involve "races" (sub-species). If offspring are not possible, then they
are different species. 

*True* aliens are less related to us than we are to redwood trees. But
given known human proclivities, that won\'t stop people from *trying*.
Succes will depend *strongly* on various biological factors
(pheromones, instinctual triggers for various behaviors, etc). 

Vargr are "merely" a different species. They are humans are both
*mammals*, and that\'s *far* closer than even Aslan.

They\'ve been using *liquid* hydrogen since the mid 60s. Most of the big
brown tank attached to the Space Shuttle at launch contains liquid
hydrogen (it\'s either 2/3rds or 4/5ths). 

Solid hydrogen would be a problem. Perhaps it\'s a slurry?

Galactic Derelict would be a great starting point for a "coming out of

travel, have it "preserved" somehow. Then run the players thru the rest
of the events. :-)

I think there\'s even *more* Norton SF (as opposed to fantasy), but with
my library mostly in storage I can\'t check.

Other "old" SF that could be useful.

Heinlein:
"Space Cadet" has a *lot* of useful "ship background" stuff in the
section between leaving the Academy, and landing on Venus. It\'s
somewhat "low tech" for Traveller, but still useful. 

"Citizen of the Galaxy" is good for a *different* culture (the
Sargony(sp)) and for the stuff while Thorby is with the Free Traders.
Especially the "silent auction". Yes, it *is* possible to barter with
natives when neither side speaks a common language.

Now for some *real* old stuff. These were originally part of the
Winston line of SF juveniles. Many of these wound up in paperback, and
others can be found at library sales or SF conventions (these are the
ones with the rocket symbol on the spine, and the neat endpapers).

"Battle on Mercury": by Eric Van Lhin (almost certainly a pen name).
This one is so so, but if you ever find a copy cheap, grab it. It\'s one
of the few SF novels set on the old "one face"-style Mercury. And
unlike the others, it deals with "Dayside", "Twilight Zone", and
"Nightside" fairly well. It also has some *interesting* aliens. These
almost make up for the so-so plotting.

"Mystery of the Third Mine": Robert W. Lowndes.
Another one that may not be easy to find (if you do, drop me a line, I
want a copy!) As I recall from reading it *many* years ago, it\'s a not
too bad story involving asteroid mining.

"Trouble on Titan": Alan E Nourse. Worth reading for the environmental
details. Sure, they are mostly wrong now. But that doesn\'t meanb you
can\'t set up a planet where they are right. :-)
Contains the interesting concept of a jet plane that flies in a methane
atmosphere. The jets suck in the methane and spray oxygen into the
combustion chamber. Which would work!

"Stadium Beyond the Stars": Milton Lesser
If I recall correctly, this deals with an interstellar Olympics.
Including some of the hassles of *trying* to compensate for folks from
planets with different gravities. 

A book *not* in the above "series" is "Scavengers of Space" by Alan E.
Nourse. It\'s another asteroid mining story. And one of the few to
realize that asteroids will be far apart, and that an asteroid that is
near you one day will by millions of miles away a few months later.
There\'s also a *lovely* fight on board a giant mobile ore processing
ship. 

If I had my library out, I could list *hundreds* of other books But
finding a store that has a decent selection of SF and then browsing
thru the stuff by Poul Anderson, and by A. Bertram Chandler would be a
start.

Actually, while she *did* have technological "bad guys" in a lot of
stories, she *did* mostly avoid the "technology is bad" trap. She did
recognize that misused tech can be a real problem.

A couple of others I just recalled that may or may not go over well:

"Star Man\'s Son" (aka "Daybreak 2250 AD"). It\'s set in a (very) post
atomic war future. It\'d be nice to for a few ideas on during the Long
Night on planets that got nuked.

"Star Gate" Good story, but not much stuff useful to Traveller in it,
except possibly for the idea of the "Star Lords" essentially taking
over a planet.

"Sea Siege" is *really* dated. But it is a good "as things fall apart"
story. Might be useful for a "start of the Long Night" scenario. It has
both pro *and* anti-tech. Basicly, the characters know that t was
(mis)use of high tech that *caused* the mess. But most of them also
realize that the high tech gear they still have is a big part of what\'s
keeping them alive. 

It\'s also good for some nice "monsters".

Sounds like a good idea.

It sounds like it just has to be junked. 

Personally, if I want a fluorine atmosphere world, I\'ll just go and
swipe Niffleheim. Note that Piper did *not* invent Niffleheim. A
professional astronomer did (and he "invented" Uller as well). It\'s
just that Piper and two other authors were handed the description and
asked to write stories involving both worlds. Then all three stories
were bundled together with the astronomer\'s description of the worlds
and sold as a 3in1 "novel".

*One* Niffleheim in a galaxy, or at least the "local" part of it, is
acceptable. Multiples aren\'t.

This design uses \'standard\' G:T module rules,  where the power is part of
the module.
When you get right down to it, there is more power systems than weapon.  A
\'classic\' design would prolly put all 100dt for the weapon, and think
about dt for power systems later.

This particular design uses 90dt for just the fusion power slice!  The
actual weapon is only  a little more than 3dt.

To satisfy curiosity, I went ahead to make the weapon a full 100dt.  The
power requirement is huge.

120,000Mj PAW-12
Weapon: 100dt
Power (for RoF 1/2): 2880dt 
Dmg=5d x 6510  1/2d=5hex  Max=15hex

GT would consider this a spinal mount (nearly 3000dt).

BTW, the to hit bonus for RoF 1/2 is +9 not +10 as previously mentioned.

    I think the number of different accents would be staggering.   I imagine 
there would be an easily recognizeable "Core Sylean Dialect" which would act 
as the standard dialect, but there would be hundreds of variations, perhaps 
with a few widespread ones. If a certain region had high levels of

Last I talked to Pournelle, he mentioned another Jannisaries novel in the
works.  He at first said the story line would be advanced a few years until
I pointed out that he left the last novel as a cliff-hanger.  He said he\'d
have to think about it.  A bit later I asked about the novel\'s status and he
said it had fallen somewhat on his list of priorities.  (Sequel to Space
Viking being another one that he may never get around to writing).

With lasers, I seem to recal that the assumption was more like several

Maybe.

> Thoughts?

I think you are getting *too* detailed. Even at the velocities
involved, due to the *distances* involved only lasers will have moved
significantly. And at most combat ranges they\'ll *still* be fired and
hit/miss in the same "turn". Though at longer ranges (over 2.5 light
seconds = over 750,000 km) the light waves *telling* you that you git
or missed won\'t get there until the next turn. 

In fact, that might be a good rule of thumb. The *minimum* turn length
ought to be long enough for light to go to extreme range and back. And
unless extreme range is a lot farther than I think it is, I
*personally* think that\'s *still* too short.

Sorry, wrong on *both* counts. It\'s *not* pronounced "your anus" nor is
it Latin.

I just happen to have an article (from this month\'s Astronomy) on how
to pronounce the names of various things.

Uranus is pronunounced "YER\'n-us" according to the article. I\'d have
written it "YER-uhn-us" but you get the idea. And since it\'s the name of
a Greek God, no, the pronunciation *isn\'t* allowed to shift.

I recommend the article.

	Doesn\'t LBB 2 use 10 minute (600 second) rounds?  Anyways, at
	1G a ship will change it\'s velocity by 50 m/s in 5 seconds.  At
	50 m/s the ship will move 250 m in 5 seconds.  Substantial
	changes in range will take quite a few rounds.

	I allow starship lasers to fire once every 6 seconds at point
	blank range (under 1,000 m).

	The CT combat rules specify that a launcher can only 
	effectively fire one missile every 10 minutes.  Presumably, 
	this includes time to acquire the target, track it, download
	data to the missile, launch the missile, cycle the next 
	missile, etc.  Because this process is known to use only one
	missile, it\'s hard to argue that more have been launched 
	(unless each "one" missile is actually a bunch of smaller 
	missiles).

	Ideally, if each space combat "shot" represents a larger 
	number of shots (most of which miss), then the chance of
	success for each of the larger number of shots should be
	lower.  For example, if the probability of getting a hit 
	with one regular "shot" is 0.42 (roll 8+ on 2D), I would 
	go for a probability of hitting for each of 100 shots of 
	about 0.01 (gives a 0.58 chance of getting no hits).  This
	is difficult to do on 2D, as the lowest probability that 
	can be generated is about 0.03.

>So, given that, is it do-able to have a starship combat round at 5

	Yes, but it will tend to be slow, and you might want to use
	an extra D for to hit rolls (say, roll a 6 on 1D to get a
	chance to roll 2D to hit the other ship).

>Thoughts?

	Go for it!  I have thought about getting my players involved
	in such a scenario, but the chance has not come up.

Actually it is atomic hydrogen. Just plain old H not H2. Let it get warmer
than 4 degrees Kelvin and it will recombine into H2 while heating it\'s self
and the liquid helium that it is suspended in to about +2000 (I seem to
remember 4000 Kelvin but I\'m not certain).

As a fuel it would be expensive (helium ain\'t cheep) and dangerous (if it
gets warmer than 4 K it\'s going to get REALLY hot REALLY fast).

Me, I a my M2P3 magneto-plasma sail drive intra-solar/extra-solar probes.
But for boosting atomic hydrogen might be hard to beat, at least as rockets
go.

"Mission of Gravity" is technically flawed in world design, but the

"Cycle of Fire" (?) talks about a world and her large moon, both of

another and eventually destroy themselves.

bang (literally) and have the characters involved in a ship-to-ship
combat as well as personal combat on the deck of the ship they are in.

So, I\'m going to alternate between types of combat...let\'s see what
happened to the ship...OK...Now let\'s see what was going on inside the
ship while that was happening.

I\'m using CT rules for personal combat (pretty much), but I haven\'t
decided on a starship combat system (I\'ll probably go with CT rules too,
adding a sensor throw to the mix).

So, here\'s my question...

For personal combat, I\'m using a 5 second round (like MT and T4, cutting
the standard CT 15 second round by 2/3).

What I want to do is cut the starship combat system down to a similar
time scale.  For instance, CT uses a 1000 second combat round.  I would
cut this down to a 5 second round also, but I would also cut the range a
ship could travel by 200 to keep things on the same scale.

What I\'m trying to figure out is...

How fast can a starship weapon fire?

How long does it take a starship scale laser to recharge and be ready to
go after a shot?  Can missile launchers fire every 5 seconds?

CT starship combat rules allow for a starship class weapon to fire twice
in the 1000 second round.  That\'s once every 500 seconds.

I\'m assuming that system is somewhat abstract, and any damage involved
is the result of several shots that may have missed the target
ship--with a few getting lucky and doing damage.  We make the to hit
throw once, but that throw is representing several times the gunner
fired the weapon during that 16 and a half minutes (the 1000 second
turn).

So, given that, is it do-able to have a starship combat round at 5
second intervals?

Thoughts?

It\'s easy to tell about Scout and Naval bases, and LBB Sup 3 has some

example, Zhondani Naval bases usually include Naval and Marine forces

But, that same source doesn\'t state whether an Imperial Naval base

My assumption...

Since there is no standard labeling symbol for the hex maps, I\'m

Well, the following information derives from my copy of _Fifth Frontier
War_:

The Imperial portion of the map in FFW includes about 4 1/2 subsectors. 
To garrison this region, the maximum number of Imperial Army units is
approximately 8 Field Armies, 6 Independent Corps, 8 divisions, 4
independent brigades, and 4 independent regiments.  (I say
"approximately" because I purchased this copy used, and I don\'t have the
Imperial setup chart.)

These forces are used to garrison the following subsectors:  Vilis,
Jewell, Regina, Lanth, and parts of Rhylanor and Aramis.

I count eleven garrisonable High-Population worlds, and three non-HiPop
subsector capitals in this area.  I would think that all of these worlds
would have garrisons of some sort.  Other worlds would be garrisoned in
accordance with their relative importance (ref\'s call).

Hope this helps....

This was my thought, now, what regions have the best chance of a
trans-steller accent? I would doubt the Spinward Marches, as they are a
border zone. How about Corrider? It is a border zone, but it also is the
only way "Behind the Claw", so I imagine some mighty concentrated traffic.

I would also imagine that Spacers (as opposed to grounders) would have a
more cosmopolitan accent.

	In keeping with the "governing the space between the worlds"

I always assumed that due to the way the Imperium works, the Fleets were the
big thing, and each world will have its own army (unlike the Zho\'s, where
the only Army is under Consular command). That would account for the vast
majority of ground troops in Imperial space.

As far as Imperial Army units went, I figured that they\'d be fairly
self-mobile, attached to fleets and covering a subsector or larger area.
When a conflict blew up, the IN Fleet would secure the area and the Imperial
Marines would perform the initial beachhead operations with meteoric drops
and assault shuttles. If the conflict required extensive
pacification/peacekeeping, then the Army units would follow up, in big
lumbering noncombatant troop transports. This saves your highly specialist
Marines for doing what they\'re best at - space and orbital assaults.

Well, that\'s what I figured, anyhows.

Mmmm. Nice. :-)

>What I\'m trying to figure out is...


I know you\'re using CT systems, and that\'s cool. To provide another
perspective, here are the TNE numbers. I bring these up because TNE is
pretty definite about exactly how mnay shots are going off in what time,
etc. Use or ignore as you wish.

>How fast can a starship weapon fire?


Depends. The baseline energy weapon fires at around once per three minutes
(180 seconds). This gets 10 shots off in a half-hour BL turn. Weapons may be
designed to fire faster (consuming more power), firing at ROF 50 (once every
36 seconds), ROF 100 (every 18 seconds), ROF 200 (every 9 seconds), ROF 400
(every 4.5 seconds) or for the fastest PD lasers, ROF 800 (every 2.25
seconds).

Missiles are usually a lot slower, due to the fact they weigh a couple tons
each and have to be loaded into a launch tube mechanically.

>How long does it take a starship scale laser to recharge and be ready to
>go after a shot?  Can missile launchers fire every 5 seconds?


Lasers take the times listed above to recharge (constant power input
spinning up an HPG or capacitor bank).

Autoloaded launchers under FFS take about five minutes to recycle and load a
new missile. I always presumed this accounts for powering up the missile,
electronic bootup, nav system alignment etc.

Same idea; FFS gives you one hit roll for that time, but the weapon may have
fired up to 600-odd shots. (It\'s just that the chances of each one hitting
are damn low at a few hundred thousand kilometres, so you spray and pray).
The faster you fire, the better hit-roll bonuses you get.

Of course, if you\'re closing to boarding ranges, the whole dynamic changes,
since each shot has a good chance of hitting the target. At real close
ranges, I\'d agree that kind of turn would be appropriate.

To followup on my recently posted list of reading suggestions...

Jory Earl (j-man@iname.com) asked about "Firehand" with P.M. Griffin. My book 
collection is home, I\'m at work, but I think it\'s around 3-5 years old. It 
was the first of these collaborative efforts to come out (before any of the 
Solar Queen followups). From what I\'ve heard, they are working on another 
book...called something like "Time War" or "Mind War". Not sure of a 
publication date.

(BTW, Jory, it\'s "Diespamer"...as in what I wish those folks who so kindly 
send me all those porn links would do...die spamer...)

Leonard Erickson (shadow@) had a few questions/comments...

Thanks for the note about "Ordeal in Otherwhere", I\'ve modified my list...

I agree on "Galactic Derelict". For those of you who have not read the 
series, "Time Trader" takes place on Earth, during the "present/near future" 
when we are still in the Cold War with the USSR. Part of that war extends 
into time travel. Agents are sent into the past, and part of their adventure 
involves discovering wrecked spaceships. "Galactic Derelict" has the 
characters (some old, some new for the book) discover a fully operational 
starship that they try to bring into the future (their present). However, the 
engines are activated and they are sent on a trip where they have to learn 
the controls, learn how to refuel, figure out what stuff in the lockers is 
edible, etc. A good book. "Defiant Agents" and "Key Out of Time" take place 
several years later when humans have copied the alien technology and are 
travelling on their own. "Firehand" is probably most directly a sequel to 
"Time Traders" and the title refers to an incident in that book.

As for Leonard\'s other suggestions...I\'ve used a lot of Robert A. Heinlein, 
Jerry Pournelle, Larry Niven, Andre Norton, Poul Anderson (a lot of his 
stuff!), Hal Clement...the list can go on for quite a while! Someday when I 
have some of that Free Time that people wish they had more of I\'ll put up a 
web page and one of the resources will be books that I\'ve read that would 
help in a SF RPG campaign!

The Winston "juvie" SF collection! Man, I\'ve got about 3/4 of them, and they 
are hard to find in good condition (I\'ve got a few without dust jackets that 
you might want Leonard, contact me and I\'ll forward titles to you ). "Battle 
on Mercury", "Eric Van Lhin" was a pen name that Lester Del Rey used (usually 
by himself, but once he wrote a book with Frederic Pohl and they used that 
name together). Lester Del Rey also wrote the "Philip St. John" books 
("Rocket Jockey" and "Rockets to Nowhere") that appeared in the Winston SF 
Series. I\'ve never been able to locate a copy of "Mystery of the Third Mine" 
or "Stadium Beyond the Stars". "Trouble on Titan" I agree is excellent. 

In addition to Nourse\'s "Scavengers in Space", I would also recommend several 
other of his books. He wrote a "Doctor to the Stars" series of short stories. 
I\'ll have to dig up all the titles that I\'ve used by him and I\'ll post that 
later...Murray Leinster (I\'m reminding myself) also wrote some "Doctor to the 
Stars" style stories that would work, and of course there\'s James Whites 
"Sector General/Star Surgeon" series (still going strong after what...50 odd 
years?????). See, I told you I could go on and on with book suggestions!

The problem with this approach is that it invalidates the canon relating
to the Fifth Frontier War.  As I look through TNS entries for that
period, there are numerous references to Imperial Army forces.  Further,
there is a distinction in the FFW board game between regular and
colonial forces.

Of course, YTUMV, but I prefer to work, as much as possible, within the
framework of canon.

But today, many of the people on Television are taught and coached in
pronunciation, diction and such.  With the bleeding of info-tainment I can
see allot more newscasters and such getting the dialog coaches that the
entertainment industry uses.  It is common for people to be taught what is
thought of as a neutral accent to make there speaking more broadly
understandable.

I was also thinking of the more automated aspects of education.  I work for
a school district with a pretty significant investment in technology and I
always see Teachers trying to offload there duties and re always hungry for
software to do the actual teaching.  The demand for software to test, drill,
and instruct in areas like spelling and such is very high and I constantly
get asked questions about voice recognition software for pronunciation and
such.  I could easily see a future where the average child learns most of
his spoken vocabulary and diction from automated systems and recorded
voices.  I think that this type of education would tend to standardize
speech and build in resistance to drift.

If this type of material was traded between worlds before the long night, it
might have allowed many of the worlds to keep very close to the same speech
patterns.  I would also think that this type of technology would be brought
into a world after the 3I recontacted worlds that had slipped from high tech
as part of the uplift process.

    The problem is that Uranus is not a Latin word.  It is a Greek word which 
has been transliterated into Latin by modern folk.   The Greek spelling is 
"Ouranos" and the accent is on the LAST syllable (syllable accents are marke 
din Greek writing).  So the authentic pronunciation in Greek would be 
"oo-ran-OS".
Neither Latin nor English likes a final syllable accent so it has to shift to 
one of the other syllables.   I was under the impression at first that the 
middle syllable was long, which would compell it to carry the accent in 
Latin, but have checked and the Greek does show a short a.  SO, your article 
is correct in one sense, a strict Latin pronunciation would be "OO-ran-us".
    As to English,  "Yer-AN-us" and "YER \'anus" are arbitrary choices. The 
first shifts the accent   one place from its original(as so is closer to 
Greek), the second shifts it two places (and so is closer to Latin).  Notice 
that the "Y" sound on the intitial syllable is just an idiosyncratic piece of 
English pronunciation, not found  in Greek or Latin.  "Yer-AN-us" of course 
was the prefered pronunciation unitl there were too many jokes about it.

    I have a similar attitude, but figure that the Imperial Army is just a 
call up of planetary armies which serve in exchange for training and

    The trouble is that people don\'t by and large learn their speech patterns 
from school.  They learn from a) mothers  b) teen aged peers.   Neither of 
these sources are likely to be overwhelmed by automated systems, especially 
since the amount of sound change in one single generation is slight enough 
that most people would say "I can\'t hear the difference"  or "What\'s the big 
deal".  It takes about a century of really big societal chaos (e.g.  5th to 
6th century Gaul) or several centruies of slow change to mark a complete 
shift in intelligiblity.   In any case the depth of disruption and loss of 
contact over the immense period of the Long Night would unavoidbly cause the 
emergence of thousands of new langauges across Imperial Space developing out 
of Anglic and Vilani.  I would even surmise that varieties of Galanglic would 
arise during the period between the Rebellion and the New Era which would 
call for some difficulties in communication, although not to the point of one 
language per world.
    If you needed to wave away language change in the Long Night, you would 
have to postulate automated diction machines that children were plugged into 
during the first two years of life, since it is during these two years that 
we learn to recognize the sounds that belong to our language or do not.  This 
is why the vast majoity of non-native English speakers never correctly 
pronounce the TH sound, to their ears it sounds like a strange "Z" or "D" 
sound.   Likewise English speakers do not recognize the German u, umlaut as a 
separate sound, it seems like an OO sound.

IMTU:

The Imperial Army is the combined Armies of the subsectors.  Each Subsector
raises an Army from the member worlds, and gets Imperial aid to fund and
equip this force to TL14-15 standards.

The main mission of this force is to defend the subsector, and maintain
stability.  Due to the logistical nightmare of moving even a single
division, all but the largest offensive actions are undertaken by the Navy
and Marines.

Each world has it\'s own army, separate from the Imperial forces, along with
it\'s Imperial commitment.

If you\'re interested, I can send you an extended write-up I did on the
subject.

Yes, it was H. Beam Piper and Michael Kirkland (sp) who wrote that book.  I
believe the Cycle of Fire reference may be to "Fire Time" by Poul Anderson,
with the lion-headed Centaur people?

I\'m curious did he mention anything about the Falkenberg\'s Legion/ Sparta
series?   I\'m a big fan of those books and thought the foundation of the
Spartan hegemony would be very interesting and very Traveller (especially T4
or TNE) approriate.
- ----

I didn\'t ask because I\'ve never read the series.  You could ask him
yourself, he does respond to emails when his busy schedule permits.  He runs
a website known as "Chaos Manor"

Here is the URL :

Here is some info from his current projects :

MAMELUKES by Jerry Pournelle

Working title for the fourth book in the Janissaries series. Jim Baen hates
the title and it will probably have an entirely different title. Introduces
new character and lots of new conflicts. About 45,000 words done and
polished. My current project.


and :

SPARTAN HEGEMONY by Jerry Pournelle, possibly alone. The next volume in the
Sparta series.

FALKENBERG ON KENNICOTT (project title; working title not selected). John
Christian Falkenberg\'s romance and brief marriage to Grace; takes place
after the WEST OF HONOR sequence in Falkenberg\'s Legion. Falkenberg is
posted to, and takes command of,  the CoDominium 42nd Line Marines.

"Cycle of Fire" (?) talks about a world and her large moon, both of 
which are inhabited by different species which make contact with one 
another and eventually destroy themselves.

Close...but that\'s not Clement\'s book you\'re describing! That is a book by H. 
Beam Piper, called "First Cycle" (finished by Michael Kurland). 

Clement did write a book called "Cycle of Fire", but the plot was quite 
different. It involved a planet where a human had crashlanded and was trying 
to survive and return to civilization and a mystery involving the inhabitants 
of said planet...

Both great books, BTW! Clement, for those who are interested, in undergoing a 
bit of a revivial right now. NESFA Press (the small press "arm" of the New 
England SF Association) is publishing a three volume set of his stuff. The 
first volume, "Trio for Sliderule and Typewriter" is out and has "Ice World", 
"Needle" and "Close to Critical" in it. The second volume, to be called 
"Music of Many Spheres" will contain short stories by Clement. The third 
volume, "Variations on a Theme by Sir Isaac Newton" will contain all the 
"Mesklin" novels and short stories (e.g., "Mission of Gravity").

Volume 2 is scheduled for "late 1999" and Volume 3 is "planned but not yet 
started".
